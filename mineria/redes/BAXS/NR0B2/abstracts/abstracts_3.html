This study reports the crystal structure of HTA from Leptospira interrogans determined at 2.2A resolution using selenomethionyl single-wavelength anomalous diffraction method. HTA is modular and consists of two structurally distinct domains--a core alpha/beta domain containing the catalytic site and a helical bundle called the lid domain. Overall, the structure fold belongs to alpha/beta hydrolase superfamily with the characteristic 'catalytic triad' residues in the active site. Detailed structure analysis showed that the catalytic histidine and serine are both present in two conformations, which may be involved in the catalytic mechanism for acetyl transfer.
Multiple steps, including the migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), are involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. To discover genes which are involved in these steps, we screened mutant mouse lines established by the exchangeable gene trap method utilizing X-gal staining during their embryonic development. One of these lines showed strong reporter gene expression in the vitelline vessels of yolk sacs at embryonic day (E) 12.5. The trap vector was inserted into the fifth intron of alpha/beta hydrolase domain containing 2 (Abhd2) gene which was shown to be expressed in vascular and non-vascular SMCs of adult mice. Although homozygous mutant mice were apparently normal, enhanced SMC migration in the explants SMCs culture and marked intimal hyperplasia after cuff placement were observed in homozygous mice in comparison with wild-type mice. Our results show that Abhd2 is involved in SMC migration and neointimal thickening on vascular SMCs.
We have demonstrated that the 80 kDa POP Tc80 (prolyl oligopeptidase of Trypanosoma cruzi) is involved in the process of cell invasion, since specific inhibitors block parasite entry into non-phagocytic mammalian host cells. In contrast with other POPs, POP Tc80 is capable of hydrolysing large substrates, such as fibronectin and native collagen. In this study, we present the cloning of the POPTc80 gene, whose deduced amino acid sequence shares considerable identity with other members of the POP family, mainly within its C-terminal portion that forms the catalytic domain. Southern-blot analysis indicated that POPTc80 is present as a single copy in the genome of the parasite. These results are consistent with mapping of POPTc80 to a single chromosome. The active recombinant protein (rPOP Tc80) displayed kinetic properties comparable with those of the native enzyme. Novel inhibitors were assayed with rPOP Tc80, and the most efficient ones presented values of inhibition coefficient Ki &lt; or = 1.52 nM. Infective parasites treated with these specific POP Tc80 inhibitors attached to the surface of mammalian host cells, but were incapable of infecting them. Structural modelling of POP Tc80, based on the crystallized porcine POP, suggested that POP Tc80 is composed of an alpha/beta-hydrolase domain containing the catalytic triad Ser548-Asp631-His667 and a seven-bladed beta-propeller non-catalytic domain. Docking analysis suggests that triple-helical collagen access to the catalytic site of POP Tc80 occurs in the vicinity of the interface between the two domains.
Mutations in the gene encoding comparative gene identification 58 (CGI-58), also known as α β hydrolase domain-containing 5 (ABHD5), cause neutral lipid storage disorder with ichthyosis (NLSDI). This inborn error in metabolism is characterized by ectopic accumulation of triacylglycerols (TAG) within cytoplasmic lipid droplets in multiple cell types. Studies over the past decade have clearly demonstrated that CGI-58 is a potent regulator of TAG hydrolysis in the disease-relevant cell types. However, despite the reproducible genetic link between CGI-58 mutations and TAG storage, the molecular mechanisms by which CGI-58 regulates TAG hydrolysis are still incompletely understood. It is clear that CGI-58 can regulate TAG hydrolysis by activating the major TAG hydrolase adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), yet CGI-58 can also regulate lipid metabolism via mechanisms that do not involve ATGL. This review highlights recent progress made in defining the physiologic and biochemical function of CGI-58, and its broader role in energy homeostasis. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Recent Advances in Lipid Droplet Biology edited by Rosalind Coleman and Matthijs Hesselink.
Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a member of the intracellular serine/threonine phosphatases. Innate immune cell activation triggered by pathogen-associated molecular patterns is mediated by various protein kinases, and PP2A plays a counter-regulatory role by deactivating these kinases. In this study, we generated a conditional knockout of the α isoform of the catalytic subunit of PP2A (PP2ACα). After crossing with myeloid-specific cre-expressing mice, effective gene knockout was achieved in various myeloid cells. The myeloid-specific knockout mice (lyM-PP2Afl/fl) showed higher mortality in response to endotoxin challenge and bacterial infection. Upon LPS challenge, serum levels of TNF-α, KC, IL-6, and IL-10 were significantly increased in lyM-PP2Afl/fl mice, and increased phosphorylation was observed in MAPK pathways (p38, ERK, JNK) and the NF-κB pathway (IKKα/β, NF-κB p65) in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from knockout mice. Heightened NF-κB activation was not associated with degradation of IκBα; instead, enhanced phosphorylation of the NF-κB p65 subunit and p38 phosphorylation-mediated TNF-α mRNA stabilization appear to contribute to the increased TNF-α expression. In addition, increased IL-10 expression appears to be due to PP2ACα-knockout-induced IKKα/β hyperactivation. Microarray experiments indicated that the Toll/IL-1R domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β/ TNFR-associated factor 3 pathway was highly upregulated in LPS-treated PP2ACα-knockout BMDMs, and knockout BMDMs had elevated IFN-α/β production compared with control BMDMs. Serum IFN-β levels from PP2ACα-knockout mice treated with LPS were also greater than those in controls. Thus, we demonstrate that PP2A plays an important role in regulating inflammation and survival in the setting of septic insult by targeting MyD88- and Toll/IL-1R domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β-dependent pathways.
Despite great progress in identifying and deorphanizing members of the human metabolic serine hydrolase (mSH) family, the fundamental role of numerous enzymes in this large protein class has remained unclear. One recently found mSH is α/β-hydrolase domain containing 12 (ABHD12) enzyme, whose natural substrate in vivo appears to be the lysophospholipid lysophosphatidylserine (LPS). In vitro, ABHD12 together with monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) and ABHD6 hydrolyzes also monoacylglycerols (MAGs) such as the primary endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG). Traditional approaches for determining 2-AG hydrolase activity are rather laborious, and often utilize unnatural substrates. Here, we describe a sensitive fluorescent assay of ABHD12 activity in a 96-well-plate format that allows simultaneous testing of inhibitor activities of up to 40 compounds in a single assay. The method utilizes lysates of HEK293 cells transiently overexpressing human ABHD12 as the enzymatic source, and kinetically monitors glycerol liberated in the hydrolysis of 1(3)-AG, the preferred MAG substrate of this enzyme. Glycerol output is coupled to an enzymatic cascade generating the fluorescent end-product resorufin. This methodology has helped to identify the first class of inhibitors showing selectivity for ABHD12 over the other mSHs.
The α/β-hydrolase domain-containing 6 (ABHD6) enzyme is a newly found serine hydrolase whose substrate profile resembles that of monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), the major 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) hydrolase in the brain. Here, we describe a sensitive fluorescent assay of ABHD6 activity in a 96-well-plate format that allows parallel testing of inhibitor activities of up to 40 compounds in a single assay. The method utilizes lysates of HEK293 cells transiently overexpressing human ABHD6 as the enzymatic source, and kinetically monitors glycerol liberated in the hydrolysis of 1(3)-AG, the preferred arachidonoyl glycerol isomer. Glycerol output is coupled to an enzymatic cascade generating the fluorescent end-product resorufin. The approach has major benefits compared to laborious traditional mass spectrometric methods and liquid scintillation-based assays, or approaches using unnatural substrates.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) particles closely mimic human very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) to evade humoral immunity and to facilitate cell entry. However, the principles that govern HCV association with VLDL components are poorly defined. Using an siRNA screen, we identified ABHD5 (α/β hydrolase domain containing protein 5, also known as CGI-58) as a new host factor promoting both virus assembly and release. ABHD5 associated with lipid droplets and triggered their hydrolysis. Importantly, ABHD5 Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome mutants responsible for a rare lipid storage disorder in humans were mislocalised, and unable to consume lipid droplets or support HCV production. Additional ABHD5 mutagenesis revealed a novel tribasic motif that does not influence subcellular localization but determines both ABHD5 lipolytic and proviral properties. These results indicate that HCV taps into the lipid droplet triglyceride reservoir usurping ABHD5 lipase cofactor function. They also suggest that the resulting lipid flux, normally devoted to VLDL synthesis, also participates in the assembly and release of the HCV lipo-viro-particle. Altogether, our study provides the first association between the Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome protein and an infectious disease and sheds light on the hepatic manifestations of this rare genetic disorder as well as on HCV morphogenesis.
Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome (CDS) is an autosomal recessive disorder, characterized by intracellular accumulation of lipid droplets in most tissues. It is very difficult to find a correlation between the phenotypic and genotypic features due to the occurrence of novel ABHD5 [ α/β hydrolase domain-containing protein-5; originally called CGI-58 (comparative gene identification-58)] mutations and the fact that there are only a few cases in the literature. The protein encoded by this gene is a cofactor for adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), which promotes the catabolism of stored fat. The clinical phenotype involves multiple organs and systems. Ichthyosis, nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma and cytoplasmic accumulation of lipid droplets in granulocytes (Jordans' bodies) are always present. Peripheral blood smear is an easy method for diagnosing CDS; its use can also avoid unnecessary further testing. Herein, we report a patient with a homozygous mutation in ABHD5 that has never previously been described. Moreover, the case was diagnosed as Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome with only a peripheral blood smear.
Abhydrolase domain containing 5 gene (ABHD5), also known as comparative gene identification 58 (CGI-58), is a member of the α/β-hydrolase family as a protein cofactor of ATGL stimulating its triacylglycerol hydrolase activity. In this study, we aim to characterize the expression and variations of ABHD5 and to study their functions in chicken fat metabolism. We compared the ABHD5 expression level in various tissues and under different nutrition conditions, identified the variations of ABHD5, and associated them with production traits in an F2 resource population of chickens. Overexpression analysis with two different genotypes and siRNA interfering analysis of ABHD5 were performed in chicken preadipocytes. Chicken ABDH5 was expressed widely and most predominantly in adipose tissue. Five SNPs of the ABHD5 gene were identified and genotyped in the F2 resource population. The c.490C &gt; T SNP was associated with subcutaneous fat thickness (P &lt; 0.01), carcass weight (P &lt; 0.05), body weight (P &lt; 0.05), shank diameter (P &lt; 0.05), and shank length (P &lt; 0.05). The c.423T &gt; C SNP was also associated with chicken body weight (P &lt; 0.05) and shank diameter (P &lt; 0.05). In chicken preadipocytes, overexpression of wild type ABDH5 did not affect the mRNA level of ATGL (adipose triglyceride lipase) but markedly decreased (P &lt; 0.05) the TG (triglyceride) content of the cell, whereas overexpression of mutation type ABHD5 did not affect either ATGL expression or TG content of the cell. The expression of ATGL and TG content of the cell were decreased (P &lt; 0.05) after ABHD5 knockdown in preadipocytes. The mRNA level of ABHD5 was regulated by both feeding and fasting, and by consumption of a high fat diet. It was increased greatly by fasting (P &lt; 0.05) and was returned to control levels after re-feeding in the adipose tissues, and down-regulated in abdominal fat (P &lt; 0.05) and the liver (P &lt; 0.01) of chickens with a high fat diet. These results suggest that expression and variations of ABHD5 may affect fat metabolism through regulating the activity of ATGL in chickens. 
Sebaceous carcinoma (SC) is a relatively uncommon malignant epithelial neoplasm with a predilection for the periocular region. The diagnosis of SC can be difficult to make at initial presentation, as it can clinically and histopathologically resemble other common benign and malignant epithelial lesions. A diagnosis of SC is made by confirmation of sebaceous differentiation of neoplastic cells, which can often be accomplished by conventional microscopic findings; however, its recognition may be sometimes difficult and requires ancillary studies such as immunohistochemistry (IHC). Many studies have evaluated the role of IHC as a potential technique to differentiate SC from its mimics; however, most of these studies have used a limited panel of antibodies with variable results. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of IHC in the diagnosis of SC and to provide some guidelines for interpretation in the diagnosis of these neoplasms. We studied 27 cases of SC with a broad panel of IHC markers using a tissue microarray technique. We also studied 21 control cases of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and 22 control cases of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Representative tissue cores were taken and processed from each case, and the tissue microarrays were stained by standard methods using antibodies to EMA, CK7, Ber-EP4, Factor XIIIA, androgen receptor, p53, adipophilin, progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1), squalene synthase (SQS), and alpha/beta hydrolase domain-containing protein 5 (ABHD5). Our studies show that EMA was expressed in all cases of SC, CK7 was expressed in 24 of 27 cases, Ber-EP4 was expressed in 7 of 27 cases, Factor XIIIA was negative in all cases, androgen receptor was expressed in 9 of 27 cases, P53 was expressed in 12 of 27 cases, adipophilin was expressed in all cases, PGRMC1 was expressed in 22 of 27 cases, SQS was expressed in 11 of 27 cases, and ABHD5 was expressed in 9 of 27 cases. EMA was negative in all cases of BCC, CK7 was expressed in 6 of 21 cases, Ber-EP4 was expressed in 21 of 21 cases, Factor XIIIA was negative in all cases, androgen receptor was expressed in 3 of 21 cases, P53 was expressed in 4 of 21 cases, adipophilin, PGRMC1, SQS, and ABHD5 were negative in all cases of BCC. Similarly, EMA was expressed in 16 of 22 cases of SCC, CK7 was expressed in 2 of 22 cases, Ber-EP4, Factor XIIIA, and androgen receptor were negative in all cases, P53 was expressed in 3 of 22 cases, adipophilin, PGRMC1, SQS, and ABHD5 were negative in all cases of SCC. Our study indicates that adipophilin represents a sensitive and reliable marker for the diagnosis of SC and can be of help in separating this tumor from some of its mimics. Additionally, inclusion of various epithelial markers in the panel will be of help if adequately used. Other antibodies against the PAT family of lipid droplet-associated proteins including PGRMC1, SQS, and ABHD5 were not as sensitive as adipophilin for identifying sebaceous differentiation and may therefore not be as useful for differential diagnosis as adipophilin. 
The endocannabinoid system remains an attractive molecular target for pharmacological intervention due to its roles in the central nervous system in learning, thinking, emotional function, regulation of food intake or pain sensation, as well as in the peripheral nervous system, where it modulates the action of cardiovascular, immune, metabolic or reproductive function. α/β hydrolase domain containing 6 (ABHD6)--an enzyme forming part of the endocannabinoid system--is a newly discovered post-genomic protein acting as a 2-AG (2-arachidonoylglycerol) serine hydrolase. We have recently reported a series of 1,2,5-thiadiazole carbamates as potent and selective ABHD6 inhibitors. Here, we present comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and molecular dynamics studies of these compounds. First, we performed a homology modeling study of ABHD6 based on the assumption that the catalytic triad of ABHD6 comprises Ser148-His306-Asp 278 and the oxyanion hole is formed by Met149 and Phe80. A total of 42 compounds was docked to the homology model using the Glide module from the Schrödinger suite of software and the selected docking poses were used for CoMFA alignment. A model with the following statistics was obtained: R(2) = 0.98, Q(2) = 0.55. In order to study the molecular interactions of the inhibitors with ABHD6 in detail, molecular dynamics was performed with the Desmond program. It was found that, during the simulations, the hydrogen bond between the inhibitor carbonyl group and the main chain of Phe80 is weakened, whereas a new hydrogen bond with the side chain of Ser148 is formed, facilitating the possible formation of a covalent bond. Graphical Abstract Left-right: Docking pose of 1 in the binding pocket of α/β hydrolase domain containing 6 (ABHD6) selected for molecular alignment; CoMFA steric and electrostatic contour fields; changes in potential energy of the complex during simulations for the complex of 6 and ABHD6.
This article describes our systematic approach to exploring the utility of the 1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-one scaffold in the development of ABHD6 inhibitors. Compound 3-(3-aminobenzyl)-5-methoxy-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2(3H)-one (JZP-169, 52) was identified as a potent inhibitor of hABHD6, with an IC₅₀ value of 216 nM. This compound at 10 μM concentration did not inhibit any other endocannabinoid hydrolases, such as FAAH, MAGL and ABHD12, or bind to the cannabinoid receptors (CB₁ and CB₂). Moreover, in competitive activity-based protein profiling (ABPP), compound 52 (JZP-169) at 10 μM selectively targeted ABHD6 of the serine hydrolases of mouse brain membrane proteome. Reversibility studies indicated that compound 52 inhibited hABHD6 in an irreversible manner. Finally, homology modelling and molecular docking studies were used to gain insights into the binding of compound 52 to the active site of hABHD6.
How cancer cells shift metabolism to aerobic glycolysis is largely unknown. Here, we show that deficiency of α/β-hydrolase domain-containing 5 (Abhd5), an intracellular lipolytic activator that is also known as comparative gene identification 58 (CGI-58), promotes this metabolic shift and enhances malignancies of colorectal carcinomas (CRCs). Silencing of Abhd5 in normal fibroblasts induces malignant transformation. Intestine-specific knockout of Abhd5 in Apc(Min/+) mice robustly increases tumorigenesis and malignant transformation of adenomatous polyps. In colon cancer cells, Abhd5 deficiency induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition by suppressing the AMPKα-p53 pathway, which is attributable to increased aerobic glycolysis. In human CRCs, Abhd5 expression falls substantially and correlates negatively with malignant features. Our findings link Abhd5 to CRC pathogenesis and suggest that cancer cells develop aerobic glycolysis by suppressing Abhd5-mediated intracellular lipolysis. 
Patatin is a non-specific plant lipase and the eponymous member of a broad class of serine hydrolases termed the patatin-like phospholipase domain containing proteins (PNPLAs). Certain PNPLA family members can be inhibited by organophosphorus (OP) compounds. Currently, no structural data are available on the modes of interaction between the PNPLAs and OP compounds or their native substrates. To this end, we present the crystal structure of patatin-17 (pat17) in its native state as well as following inhibition with methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate (MAFP) and inhibition/aging with diisopropylphosphorofluoridate (DFP). The native pat17 structure revealed the existence of two portals (portal1 and portal2) that lead to its active-site chamber. The DFP-inhibited enzyme underwent the aging process with the negatively charged phosphoryl oxygen, resulting from the loss of an isopropyl group, being within hydrogen-binding distance to the oxyanion hole. The MAFP-inhibited pat17 structure showed that MAFP did not age following its interaction with the nucleophilic serine residue (Ser77) of pat17 since its O-methyl group was intact. The MAFP moiety is oriented with its phosphoryl oxygen in close proximity to the oxyanion hole of pat17 and its O-methyl group located farther away from the oxyanion hole of pat17 relative to the DFP-bound state. The orientation of the alkoxy oxygens within the two OP compounds suggests a role for the oxyanion hole in stabilizing the emerging negative charge on the oxygen during the aging reaction. The arachidonic acid side chain of MAFP could be contained within portals 1 or 2. Comparisons of pat17 in the native, inhibited, and aged states showed no significant global conformational changes with respect to their Cα backbones, consistent with observations from other α/β hydrolases such as group VIIA phospholipase A2. 
Probenecid, a widely used uricosuric agent, is mainly metabolized to probenecid acyl glucuronide (PRAG), which is considered a causal substance of severe allergic or anaphylactoid reactions. PRAG can be hydrolyzed (deglucuronidated) to probenecid. The purpose of this study was to identify enzymes responsible for probenecid acyl glucuronidation and PRAG deglucuronidation in human livers and to examine the effect of deglucuronidation in PRAG formation. In human liver homogenates (HLHs), the intrinsic clearance (CLint) of PRAG deglucuronidation was much greater (497-fold) than that of probenecid acyl glucuronidation. Evaluation of PRAG formation by recombinant UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isoforms and an inhibition study using HLHs as an enzyme source demonstrated that multiple UGT isoforms, including UGT1A1, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7, catalyzed probenecid acyl glucuronidation. We found that recombinant α/β hydrolase domain containing 10 (ABHD10) substantially catalyzed PRAG deglucuronidation activity, whereas carboxylesterases did not. Similar inhibitory patterns by chemicals between HLHs and recombinant ABHD10 supported the major contribution of ABHD10 to PRAG deglucuronidation in human liver. Interestingly, it was demonstrated that the CLint value of probenecid acyl glucuronidation in HLHs was increased by 1.7-fold in the presence of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, which potently inhibited ABHD10 activity. In conclusion, we found that PRAG deglucuronidation catalyzed by ABHD10 suppressively regulates PRAG formation via multiple UGT enzymes in human liver. The balance of activities by these enzymes is important for the formation of PRAG, which may be associated with the adverse reactions observed after probenecid administration.
α/β-hydrolase domain-containing protein 5 (ABHD5) plays an important role in the triacylglycerols (TAG) hydrolysis. Indeed, ABHD5 is the co-activator of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), that catalyses the initial step of TAG hydrolysis. Mutations in ABHD5 gene are associated with the onset of Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome (CDS), a rare autosomal recessive lipid storage disorder, characterized by non-bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (NCIE), hepatomegaly and liver steatosis.
We describe here a 5-years-old Brazilian child who presented with NCIE at birth and diffuse micro and macro-vesicular steatosis on liver biopsy since she was 2 years old. Molecular analysis of coding sequence and putative 5' regulatory region of ABHD5 gene was performed. A homozygous novel deletion, affecting the promoter region and the exon 1, was identified, confirming the suspected diagnosis of CDS for this patient. RT-PCR analysis showed that the genomic rearrangement completely abolished the ABHD5 gene expression in the patient, while only a partial loss of expression was detected in her parents. This is the first report describing the identification of a large deletion encompassing the promoter region of ABHD5 gene. The total loss of ABHD5 expression may explain the early onset of CDS and the severe liver involvement. After molecular diagnosis, the patient started a special diet, poor in fatty acids with medium chain triglycerides (MCT), and showed hepatic and dermatologic improvement in spite of severe molecular defect.
This case report extends the spectrum of disease-causing ABHD5 mutations in CDS providing evidence for a novel pathogenic mechanism for this rare disorder. Moreover, our preliminary data show that early diagnosis and prompt treatment of neutral lipid accumulation might be useful for CD patients.
The brown alga, Nemacystus decipiens ("ito-mozuku" in Japanese), is one of the major edible seaweeds, cultivated principally in Okinawa, Japan. N. decipiens is also a significant source of fucoidan, which has various physiological activities. To facilitate brown algal studies, we decoded the ~154 Mbp draft genome of N. decipiens Onna-1 strain. The genome is estimated to contain 15,156 protein-coding genes, ~78% of which are substantiated by corresponding mRNAs. Mitochondrial genes analysis showed a close relationship between N. decipiens and Cladosiphon okamuranus. Comparisons with the C. okamuranus and Ectocarpus siliculosus genomes identified a set of N. decipiens-specific genes. Gene ontology annotation showed more than half of these are classified as molecular function, enzymatic activity, and/or biological process. Extracellular matrix analysis revealed domains shared among three brown algae. Characterization of genes that encode enzymes involved in the biosynthetic pathway for sulfated fucan showed two sets of genes fused in the genome. One is a fusion of L-fucokinase and GDP-fucose pyrophosphorylase genes, a feature shared with C. okamuranus. Another fusion is between an ST-domain-containing gene and an alpha/beta hydrolase gene. Although the function of fused genes should be examined in future, these results suggest that N. decipiens is another promising source of fucoidan.
ABHD12 is a membrane-bound hydrolytic enzyme that acts on the lysophosphatidylserine (lyso-PS) and lysophosphatidylinositol (lyso-PI) classes of immunomodulatory lipids. Human and mouse genetic studies point to a key role for the ABHD12-(lyso)-PS/PI pathway in regulating (neuro)immunological functions in both the central nervous system and periphery. Selective inhibitors of ABHD12 would offer valuable pharmacological probes to complement genetic models of ABHD12-regulated (lyso)-PS/PI metabolism and signaling. Here, we provide a detailed description of the discovery and activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) guided optimization of reversible thiourea inhibitors of ABHD12 that culminated in the identification of DO264 as a potent, selective, and in vivo active ABHD12 inhibitor. We also show that DO264, but not a structurally related inactive control probe (S)-DO271, augments inflammatory cytokine production from human THP-1 macrophage cells. The in vitro and in vivo properties of DO264 designate this compound as a suitable chemical probe for studying the biological functions of ABHD12-(lyso)-PS/PI pathways.
Lindane degrading root epiphytic bacteria were isolated from wetland plant Acorus calamus. Bacterial strain A3 identified as Achromobacter sp. A3, showed maximum degradation potential of 88.7 ± 1.24% for 50 mg l-1 lindane. Lindane biodegradation was followed by decrease in pH as well as increase in concentration of chloride ions in the culture medium. Lindane degradation potential of Achromobacter sp. A3 was also studied at different concentrations of lindane. Maximum degradation was at 10 mg l-1 followed by 50 mg l-1 and 100 mg l-1 lindane. Also, lindane induced proteins were studied using SDS-PAGE. The induced proteins were identified as alpha/beta hydrolase fold-3 domain-containing protein, involved in lindane hydrolysis and extracellular solute-binding family protein having role in transmembrane transport of lindane for utilization of lindane by bacteria. The appearance of unique polypeptides in lane corresponding to media supplemented with lindane showed that the exposure of bacterial cells to lindane has resulted in regulative expression of certain proteins. So far as known, this is the first report to isolate and study lindane degrading root epiphytic bacteria from A. calamus.
The genetic regulation of lipolytic enzyme is closely related to carcass quality traits through deposition of intramuscular fat (marbling) in beef cattle breeds. The α/β hydrolase domain containing 5 (ABHD5) is an accelerating factor of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), which plays a key role in triglyceride metabolism. In this study, we determined that bovine ABHD5 gene was highly expressed in adult bovine adipose tissue. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in bovine ABHD5 regulation, we cloned and characterized the promoter region of ABHD5. Applying 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA end analysis (RACE), we identified transcriptional start site (TSS) found in the predicted CpG island within promoter region of ABHD5 gene. Using the recombinant dual fluorescent reporter vectors, the fragment of -109/+307 was identified as proximal minimum core promoter region of ABHD5 in bovine intramuscular adipocytes. Site directed mutagenesis and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) confirmed the role of two transcription factors, namely Ectopic viral integration site-1 (Evi1) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPα), in the regulation of ABHD5 gene. Taken together these findings we can conclude that ABHD5 gene regulated by Evi1 and C/EBPα could be used as potential marker in marker assisted selection for the improvement of Qinchuan cattle breed for carcass quality traits.
Mutations in the genes coding for patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 1 (PNPLA1) and α/β-hydrolase domain-containing 5 (ABHD5), also known as comparative gene identification 58, are causative for ichthyosis, a severe skin barrier disorder. Individuals with mutations in either of these genes show a defect in epidermal ω-O-acylceramide (AcylCer) biosynthesis, suggesting that PNPLA1 and ABHD5 act in the same metabolic pathway. In this report, we identified ABHD5 as a coactivator of PNPLA1 that stimulates the esterification of ω-hydroxy ceramides with linoleic acid for AcylCer biosynthesis. ABHD5 interacts with PNPLA1 and recruits the enzyme to its putative triacylglycerol substrate onto cytosolic lipid droplets. Conversely, alleles of ABHD5 carrying point mutations associated with ichthyosis in humans failed to accelerate PNPLA1-mediated AcylCer biosynthesis. Our findings establish an important biochemical function of ABHD5 in interacting with PNPLA1 to synthesize crucial epidermal lipids, emphasizing the significance of these proteins in the formation of a functional skin permeability barrier.
α/β-Hydrolase domain-containing 6 (ABHD6) contributes to the hydrolysis of the major endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) in the central nervous system (CNS) and in the periphery. ABHD6 blockade has been proposed as novel strategy to treat multiple sclerosis (MS), based on the observation that the inhibitor WWL70 exerts protective anti-inflammatory effects in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). According to recent data, WWL70 exhibits off-target anti-inflammatory activity in microglial cells and the potential of ABHD6 as drug target in MS remains controversial. Here we further investigated the role of ABHD6 during autoimmune demyelination by comparing the efficacy of two novel inhibitors with different CNS permeability in vivo. Preventive treatment with the systemically active inhibitor KT182 ameliorated the neurological signs of EAE during the time-course of disease. By contrast, administration of the peripherally restricted compound KT203 was ineffective in attenuating EAE symptomatology. Both inhibitors failed to improve corticospinal tract conduction latency and to attenuate inflammation at EAE recovery phase, despite being equally active at targeting brain ABHD6. Chronic administration of KT182 was associated to a partial loss of brain CB1 receptor coupling ability, suggesting the engagement of CB1 receptor-mediated mechanisms during the EAE disease progression. In cultured neurons, KT182 attenuated NMDA-stimulated excitotoxicity and mitochondrial calcium overload. However, these protective effects were not attributable to ABHD6, as they were not mimicked by the alternative inhibitors KT203, KT195 and WWL70. These results indicate that ABHD6 blockade exerts only modest therapeutic effects against autoimmune demyelination and call into question its utility as novel drug target in MS.
The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is considered to be an endogenous protective system in various neurodegenerative diseases. Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) is a neurodegenerative disease in which the role of the ECS has not been studied yet. Most of the endocannabinoid enzymes are serine hydrolases, which can be studied using activity-based protein profiling (ABPP). Here, we report the serine hydrolase activity in brain proteomes of a NPC mouse model as measured by ABPP. Two ABPP methods are used: a gel-based method and a chemical proteomics method. The activities of the following endocannabinoid enzymes were quantified: diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL) α, α/β-hydrolase domain-containing protein 4, α/β-hydrolase domain-containing protein 6, α/β-hydrolase domain-containing protein 12, fatty acid amide hydrolase, and monoacylglycerol lipase. Using the gel-based method, two bands were observed for DAGL α. Only the upper band corresponding to this enzyme was significantly decreased in the NPC mouse model. Chemical proteomics showed that three lysosomal serine hydrolase activities (retinoid-inducible serine carboxypeptidase, cathepsin A, and palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1) were increased in Niemann-Pick C1 protein knockout mouse brain compared to wild-type brain, whereas no difference in endocannabinoid hydrolase activity was observed. We conclude that these targets might be interesting therapeutic targets for future validation studies.
PLIN2 (Perilipin-2) is a protein that can anchor on the membrane of lipid droplets (LDs), playing a vital role in the early formation of LDs and in the regulation of LD metabolism in many types of cells. However, little research has been conducted in cattle adipocytes. In the present study, we found that the expression of PLIN2 mRNA peaks at Day 2 during cattle adipocyte differentiation (p &lt; 0.01), but PLIN2 protein levels maintain high abundance until Day 4 and then decrease sharply. We first built an interaction model using PyMOL. The results of a pull-down assay indicated that bovine PLIN2 and CGI-58 (ABHD5, &amp;alpha;/&amp;beta; hydrolase domain-containing protein 5) had an interaction relationship. Furthermore, Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation-Flow Cytometry (BiFC-FC) was used to explore the function of the PLIN2-CGI-58 interaction. Interestingly, we found that different combined models had different levels of fluorescence intensity; specifically, PLIN2-VN173+CGI-58-VC155 expressed in bovine adipocytes exhibited the highest level of fluorescence intensity. Our findings elucidate the PLIN2 expression pattern in cattle adipocytes, the protein structure and the function of protein⁻protein interactions (PPI) as well as highlight the characteristics of bovine PLIN2 during the early formation and accumulation of lipid droplets.
Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) is a serine hydrolase that plays an important role in the degradation of the endocannabinoid neurotransmitter 2-arachidonoylglycerol, which is implicated in many physiological processes. Beyond the possible utilization of MAGL inhibitors as anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, and anticancer agents, their application has encountered obstacles due to the unwanted effects caused by the irreversible inhibition of this enzyme. The possible application of reversible MAGL inhibitors has only recently been explored, mainly due to the deficiency of known compounds possessing efficient reversible inhibitory activities. In this work, we report a new series of reversible MAGL inhibitors. Among them, compound 26 showed to be a potent MAGL inhibitor (IC50 = 0.51 μM, Ki = 412 nM) with a good selectivity versus fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), α/β-hydrolase domain-containing 6 (ABHD6), and 12 (ABHD12). Interestingly, this compound also possesses antiproliferative activities against two different cancer cell lines and relieves the neuropathic hypersensitivity induced in vivo by oxaliplatin.
Patients with metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) have a poorer prognosis than patients with organ-confined tumors. We strove to uncover the proteome signature of primary PCa and associated lymph node metastases (LNMs) in order to identify proteins that may indicate or potentially promote metastases formation. We performed a proteomic comparative profiling of PCa tissue from radical prostatectomy (RPE) of patients without nodal metastases or relapse at the time of surgical resection (n=5) to PCa tissue from RPE of patients who suffered from nodal relapse (n=5). For the latter group, we also included patient-matched tissue of the nodal metastases. All samples were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. We identified and quantified more than 1200 proteins by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry with subsequent label-free quantification. An increase of ribosomal or proteasomal proteins in LNM (compared to corresponding PCa) became apparent, while extracellular matrix components rather decreased. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) corroborated accumulation of poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase 1 and N-myc-downstream-regulated-gene 3, alpha/beta hydrolase domain-containing protein 11, and protein phosphatase slingshot homolog 3 in LNM. These findings strengthen the present interest in examining PARP inhibitors for the treatment of aggressive PCa. IHC also corroborated increased abundance of retinol dehydrogenase 11 in metastasized primary PCa compared to organ-confined PCa. Generally, metastasizing primary tumors were characterized by an enrichment of proteins involved in cellular lipid metabolic processes with concomitant decrease of cell adhesion proteins. This study highlights the usefulness of a combined proteomic-IHC approach to explore novel aspects in tumor biology. Our initial results open novel opportunities for follow-up studies.
Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) is the key-enzyme for the release of fatty acids (FAs) from triacylglycerol (TG) stores during intracellular lipolysis producing FAs used for energy production. There is growing evidence that the products and intermediates from lipolytic breakdown during the FA mobilization process also have fundamental regulatory functions affecting cell signaling, gene expression, metabolism, cell growth, cell death, and lipotoxicity. Regulation of ATGL is therefore vital for maintaining a defined balance between lipid storage and mobilization. This review addresses the regulation of ATGL activity at the post-translational level with special emphasis on protein-mediated interaction at the site of hydrolytic action, namely to the lipid droplet.
Bioactive N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) are ethanolamides of long-chain fatty acids, including palmitoylethanolamide, oleoylethanolamide and anandamide. In animal tissues, NAEs are biosynthesized from membrane phospholipids. The classical "transacylation-phosphodiesterase" pathway proceeds via N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE), which involves the actions of two enzymes, NAPE-generating Ca2+-dependent N-acyltransferase (Ca-NAT) and NAPE-hydrolyzing phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD). Recent identification of Ca-NAT as Ɛ isoform of cytosolic phospholipase A2 enabled the further molecular biological approaches toward this enzyme. In addition, Ca2+-independent NAPE formation was shown to occur by N-acyltransferase activity of a group of proteins named phospholipase A/acyltransferases (PLAAT)-1-5. The analysis of NAPE-PLD-deficient mice confirmed that NAEs can be produced through multi-step pathways bypassing NAPE-PLD. The NAPE-PLD-independent pathways involved three members of the glycerophosphodiesterase (GDE) family (GDE1, GDE4 and GDE7) as well as α/β-hydrolase domain-containing protein (ABHD)4. In this review article, we will focus on recent progress made and latest insights in the enzymes involved in NAE synthesis and their further characterization.
N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) is a member of the N-myc downstream regulated gene family which belongs to the alpha/beta hydrolase superfamily. Earlier studies have shown its association with inhibition of tumor metastasis. However, its function in malignant tumors is not fully enunciated. Recently there was increasing evidence that NDRG1 is involved in stress responses. In the current study, we examined the expression of NDRG1 and its correlation with clinicopathological factors and microvessel density (MVD) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using immunohistochemistry (IHC). NDRG1 expression in NSCLC (71/115, 61.7%) was higher than that in normal lung tissues (32/115, 27.8%) (p &lt; 0.05). NDRG1 expression in NSCLC cells was found in cytoplasm (63/115, 54.8%), nuclear (24/115, 20.9%) and cell membrane (13/115, 11.3%). NDRG1 expression in NSCLC with advanced T stages (T2-4) (63/84, 75.0%) was significantly higher than that with T1 stage (8/31, 25.8%) (P &lt; 0.05). No other clinicopathological factors including lymph node metastasis were found to be associated with NDRG1 expression (p &gt; 0.05). Moreover increased NDRG1 expression was associated with lower MVD in NSCLC (P &lt; 0.05). MVD in adenocarcinoma (33.4 ± 8.4/HP) was significantly higher than that in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (19.3 ± 8.1/HP) (P &lt; 0.05). No other clinicopathological factors were associated with MVD in NSCLC (p &gt; 0.05). The present findings indicate an increase of NDRG1 expression with the progress of tumour extent which may be due to unbalanced tumor oxygenation on account of poor vascularization in NSCLC.
Listeriosis can lead to potentially lethal pulmonary complications in newborns and immune compromised patients, characterized by extensive permeability edema. Listeriolysin (LLO), the main virulence factor of Listeria monocytogenes, induces a dose-dependent hyperpermeability in monolayers of human lung microvascular endothelial cells in vitro. The permeability increasing activity of LLO, which is accompanied by an increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, RhoA activation and myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, can be completely inhibited by the protein kinase C (PKC) alpha/beta inhibitor GO6976, indicating a crucial role for PKC in the induction of barrier dysfunction. The TNF-derived TIP peptide, which mimics the lectin-like domain of the cytokine, blunts LLO-induced hyperpermeability in vitro, upon inhibiting LLO-induced protein kinase C-alpha activation, ROS generation and MLC phosphorylation and upon restoring the RhoA/Rac 1 balance. These results indicate that the lectin-like domain of TNF has a potential therapeutic value in protecting from LLO-induced pulmonary endothelial hyperpermeability.
There is growing evidence that increased expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the lungs of patients is a key event in the pathogenesis of lung diseases. In this study, we investigated the involvement of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), IkappaB kinase alpha/beta (IKKalpha/beta), and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathways in thrombin-induced COX-2 expression in human lung fibroblasts (WI-38). Treatment of WI-38 cells with thrombin caused increased COX-2 expression in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Treatment of WI-38 cells with PD 98059 (2-[2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl]-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one, a MEK inhibitor) inhibited thrombin-induced COX-2 expression and COX-2-luciferase activity. Stimulation of cells with thrombin caused an increase in ERK phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner. In addition, treatment of WI-38 cells with Bay 117082, an IkappaB phosphorylation inhibitor, and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), an NF-kappaB inhibitor, inhibited thrombin-induced COX-2 expression. The thrombin-induced increase in COX-2-luciferase activity was also blocked by the dominant negative IkappaBalpha mutant (IkappaBalphaM). Treatment of WI-38 cells with thrombin induced IKKalpha/beta and IkappaBalpha phosphorylation, IkappaBalpha degradation, and kappaB-luciferase activity. The thrombin-mediated increases in IKKalpha/beta phosphorylation and kappaB-luciferase activity were inhibited by PD 98059. Taken together, these results suggest that the ERK-dependent IKKalpha/beta/NF-kappaB signaling pathway plays an important role in thrombin-induced COX-2 expression in human lung fibroblasts.
Mucous hypersecretion is a serious feature of chronic airway diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis. Although mucins are produced via activation of an EGF receptor (EGFR) signaling cascade, the mechanisms leading to exaggerated mucin production in mucous hypersecretory diseases are unknown. Because expression of ICAM-1 and of the ICAM-1 ligand fibrinogen is increased in the airways of subjects with mucous hypersecretory diseases, we hypothesized that fibrinogen binding to ICAM-1 could increase EGFR-dependent mucin production in human airway (NCI-H292) epithelial cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that an ICAM-1 neutralizing antibody and an ICAM-1(8-22) peptide that binds fibrinogen decreased mucin production induced by the EGFR ligand transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha dose-dependently. Exogenous fibrinogen and a fibrinogen(117-133) peptide that binds ICAM-1 rescued mucin production in cells treated with the ICAM-1(8-22) peptide. Surprisingly, the ICAM-1(8-22) peptide increased EGFR phosphotyrosine and phospho-ERK1/2 in cells treated with TGF-alpha. The ICAM-1(8-22) peptide-induced increases in EGFR phosphotyrosine and phospho-ERK1/2 were prevented by exogenous fibrinogen, by the fibrinogen(117-133) peptide, and by selective inhibitors of phospholipase C (PLC), protein kinase C (PKC)-alpha/beta, and metalloproteases. These results suggest that fibrinogen binding to ICAM-1 promotes mucin production by decreasing TGF-alpha-induced EGFR and ERK1/2 activation and that the fibrinogen-ICAM-1-dependent decrease in EGFR and ERK1/2 activation occurs via inhibition of an early positive feedback pathway involving PLC- and PKC-alpha/beta-dependent metalloprotease activation and subsequent metalloprotease-dependent EGFR reactivation.
Breakdown of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is accomplished by the concerted action of several proteases, including the urokinase plasminogen-activator (uPA) system and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which is crucial for cancer invasion and metastasis. Several reports have shown that the levels of IL-1 beta and MMPs in plasma of the patients with lung cancer are significantly elevated and link to the invasion of tumor cells. Therefore, we investigated whether IL-1 beta-induced expression of uPA participated in lung cancer progression. In this study, IL-1 beta significantly induced uPA expression and activity via PKC alpha-dependent JNK1/2 and NIK cascades, linking to IKK alpha/beta activation, p65 translocation and transcription activity, using pharmacological inhibitors and transfection with dominant negative mutants and siRNAs. IL-1 beta-induced uPA protein and mRNA expression in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, which was inhibited by pretreatment with the inhibitors of JNK1/2 (SP600125), PKC (Ro31-8220, Gö6976), or NF-kappaB (helenalin), and transfection with dominant negative mutants of PKC alpha, NIK, and IKK beta, and siRNAs of JNK1/2 and p65. IL-1 beta stimulated PKC alpha translocation to plasma membrane leading to phosphorylation of JNK1/2, which was attenuated by PKC inhibitors and transfection with shRNAs of JNK1/2, but not by helenalin. In addition, IL-1beta stimulated p65 phosphorylation and translocation into nucleus concomitant with I kappaB alpha phosphorylation and I kappaB alpha degradation, which was mediated via activation of PKC alpha-dependent JNK1/2-NIK/IKK beta cascade. These results demonstrated that in A549 cells, activation of p50/p65 heterodimer through sequential activation of PKC alpha-JNK-NIK-IKK beta-NF-kappaB was required for IL-1 beta-induced uPA expression associated with migration of tumor cells.
N-myc downstream-regulated genes 1 and 3 (NDRG1 and NDRG3) are members of the alpha/beta hydrolase superfamily. Phylogenetic analysis of the family demonstrated that human NDRG1 and 3 belong to a subfamily. The mapping and gene expression patterns of these genes represent one step toward further investigation into their possible roles in the chicken (Gallus gallus). To map these genes in the chicken chromosome, a 6000 rads chicken-hamster radiation hybrid panel (ChickRH6) was used. Primers were designed according to the published human sequences for amplification of those two genes. We compared the corresponding human mRNA sequences with the predicted coding sequences of the chicken NDRG1 and 3 genes and found that the assembled contigs shared a high percentage of similarity with the human genes. PCR of samples from ChickRH6 revealed that the locations of NDRG1 and 3 are linked to the markers MYC (58 cRs away, LOD score 4.52) and SEQ0265 (10 cRs away, LOD score 17.81), respectively. This result adds two new markers to the chicken RH map, and it reinforces that the RH technique is indeed a powerful tool for mapping genes due to its rapidity, precision, convenience, and reproducibility. In addition, we detected the gene expression and distribution of chicken NDRG1 and 3 in seven tissues, including heart, liver, spleen, lung, muscle, brain, and thymus, by RT-PCR, and found that NDRG1 is relatively ubiquitously expressed in all the tested tissues and highly expressed in heart and liver, whereas NDRG3 is high in heart, muscle, and brain.
Macrophages display different phenotypes that can switch in response to their micro-environment. In our earlier study (Chiang, C. S., Liu, W. C. and Jung, S. M., 2005. Compartmental responses after thoracic irradiation of mice: strain differences. Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 62:862) on radiation-induced cytokine expression in lung lavage samples, there was a suggestion that the procedures used to harvest lung macrophages affected the profiles they expressed. To further explore this issue, we examined gene expression by cell populations, mainly macrophages, isolated by lavage from lung and peritoneal cavity following either in vivo or in vitro stimulation with LPS, IFN-gamma or irradiation. We found that expression of mRNA for tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1 alpha/beta and IL-6 varied several fold depending on whether the assay was performed on cells immediately after isolation or after in vitro manipulation. The relative level of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) to arginase I (Arg I), which is frequently used as index of the M1 versus M2 functional macrophage phenotype, also varied. LPS stimulation in vivo was able to change the profile from Arg I expression to one where the iNOS pathway became dominant, but was unable to do this in vitro. This contrasts with the ability of IFN-gamma to generate an iNOS-dominant pathway in vitro, but not in vivo. This study cautions that the expression of inflammatory cytokines and the iNOS to Arg I ratio, which is often used as an index of their functional capacity, varies with the experimental conditions.
We have cloned 3 novel murine cDNAs encoding proteins containing an alpha/beta hydrolase fold; a catalytic domain found in a very wide range of enzymes. These proteins belong to the prosite UPF0017 uncharacterized protein family and we have named them lung alpha/beta hydrolase 1, 2, and 3 (LABH) since they were cloned from lung cDNA. All have 9 coding exons, encoding 412, 425, and 411 residue proteins respectively (46-48 kDa); LABH1 being closely related to LABH3 having 45% identity. All 3 proteins have a single predicted amino-terminus transmembrane domain. An alignment of family members from different phyla enabled the identification of the LABH1 catalytic triad as Ser211, Asp337, and His366. mRNA expression levels of LABH1 and 3 were highest in liver and LABH2 highest in testis. These findings suggest that the LABH proteins consist of a novel family of membrane bound enzymes whose function has yet to be determined.
The airway epithelial cell of the lower respiratory tract is the primary host target cell for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. To estimate whether infected epithelial cells contribute to the inflammatory host response observed during the acute infection phase we analyzed the cell surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1, CD54) on human bronchial epithelial cells (A549) following RSV infection and cytokine priming. The epithelial cells constitutively expressed ICAM-1. The ICAM-1 surface expression was significantly up-regulated up to 72 h post RSV infection. In addition, cytokine priming with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-gammma (IFN-gamma), or interleukin-1 alpha/beta (IL-1alpha/beta) induced an enhanced ICAM-1 expression on noninfected as well as on RSV-infected epithelial cells. As early as 24 h post RSV infection and cytokine priming, respectively, the maximum of ICAM-1-expressing cells was observed. In contrast, the maximal ICAM-1 up-regulation per cell was measured 24 h later, e.g., after 48 h of culture. Cytokine priming with IL-3, IL-6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) did not lead to a significant increase of ICAM-1 expression either on RSV-infected or on noninfected A549 cells up to 72 h of culture time. Performed signal transduction experiments, e.g. [alpha-32P]GTP-binding blot analysis, revealed that low-molecular-weight GTP-binding proteins possess an enhanced GTP-binding capacity in RSV-infected A549 cells.
NSF and SNAPs (soluble NSF attachment proteins), originally identified as cytosolic components of intracellular vesicular transport mechanisms, have recently been implicated in Ca(2+)-triggered neurotransmitter release from synaptic terminals. Here, we have investigated the temporal and spatial expression pattern of the rodent NSF and SNAP genes. A single transcript of 4.5 kb is highly expressed in rat brain, whereas only minor amounts of NSF mRNA are found in liver, kidney, heart, lung and skeletal muscle. In situ hybridisation revealed NSF transcripts as early as embryonic day 10 preferentially in the nervous system of mouse embryos. In the adult brain NSF is widely expressed with particularly high levels in the hippocampus. An identical expression profile was observed for alpha/beta-SNAP. Our data are consistent with a central function of NSF and SNAPs in neurotransmission.
The Hyal-1 locus, which we have previously described and mapped to mouse chromosome 9, influences the serum levels and molecular weight forms of hyaluronidase. We have also shown that the growth of two transplantable tumors, the 3LL carcinoma and the B16F10 melanoma, is influenced by the alleles at Hyal-1, in that the tumors develop more slowly in congenic B6.C-Hyal-1a (also called HW23) mice than in the parental Hyal-1b C57BL/6 mice. Here we present evidence that tumor development is stimulated and mortality is accelerated in B6.C-Hyal-1a mice grafted with 3LL carcinoma cells when treated with alpha/beta interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) or with IFN-beta, whereas in IFN-treated C57BL/6 mice 3LL tumor growth is inhibited. Likewise, in B6.C-Hyal-1a mice grafted with B16F10 melanoma cells, IFN-alpha/beta treatment results in stimulation of tumor growth, whereas in IFN-treated C57BL/6 mice tumor growth, whereas in IFN-treated C57BL/6 mice tumor growth is inhibited and mortality delayed. Thus, IFN-alpha/beta treatment of B6.C-Hyal-1a mice results in stimulation of tumor development and sometimes in accelerated mortality. This is the opposite of the usually described effect of IFN treatment in mice, which is inhibition of tumor development and delayed mortality, as was indeed observed in the C57BL/6 mice in the present experiments. These results provide the first indication that host genes can up- or down-regulate the antitumor activity of IFN and that, on some genetic backgrounds, IFN treatment enhances rather than inhibits tumor development. This may help to explain the apparent discordance between mouse model studies, which hitherto have consistently reported inhibition of tumor formation by IFN, and the clinical trials, in which only a limited percentage of individuals show tumor regression while others have no beneficial effect or even have progression of disease in spite of the IFN treatment.
The effects of Dox (Dox), paclitaxel (Taxol), and serum starvation on the regulation of XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis), Bcl-2 phosphorylation, and apoptosis were evaluated in human H460 non-small cell lung cancer cells. Protein kinases that responded to these treatments as prosurvival elements in signal transduction were identified by simultaneously screening phosphorylation of protein kinases in H460 cells cultured in serum-free medium or treated with Dox. We demonstrated that Dox and Taxol induced apoptosis through down-regulation of XIAP and phosphorylation of Bcl-2 in a concentration-dependent manner without changing expression of Bcl-xL in H460 cells. These effects were paralleled by activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase protein. We identified that serum starvation and Dox reduced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK), protein kinase C (PKC) alpha/beta and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase. The MEK-specific inhibitor U0126 or PKC inhibitor staurosporine (STP) also down-regulated XIAP expression and induced apoptosis. Thus, our data suggest that apoptosis and down-regulation of XIAP induced by Dox exposure or serum starvation may be mediated through inactivation of the MEK/ERK and PKCalpha/beta pathways. In support of this we demonstrated that the cytotoxic effects of Dox when combined with U0126 or STP were enhanced, i.e., synergistic cytotoxic activities were demonstrated. The synergistic interaction of U0126 or STP with Dox was sequence- and concentration-dependent.
Ku70 protein, cooperating with Ku80 and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), is involved in DNA double-strand break (DNA DSB) repair and V(D)J recombination. Recent studies have revealed increased ionizing radiosensitivity in Ku70-deficient cells. The presented study, using a human squamous cell lung carcinoma cell line, demonstrated that introduction of an antisense Ku70 nucleic acid made the cells more radio- and chemosensitive than the parental cells. Ku70 protein expression was suppressed in the cells with antisense Ku70 construct when compared to the wild-type cells. A relatively small but statistically significant increase in radiosensitivity of the cells was achieved by the introduction of the antisense Ku70. The increased radiosensitivity in vitro was accompanied by an approximately two-fold increase in alpha and alpha/beta values in a linear-quadratic model. The antisense Ku70 increased the chemosensitivity of the cells to some DNA-damaging agents such as bleomycin and methyl methanesulfonate, but not to cisplatin, mitomycin C, and paclitaxel. This system provides us with partial suppression of Ku70, and will be a useful experimental model for investigating the physiological roles of the DNA DSB repair gene.
Secretory leucoprotease inhibitor (SLPI) is a non-glycosylated protein produced by epithelial cells, macrophages, and neutrophils and was initially identified as a serine protease inhibitor of the neutrophil proteases elastase and cathepsin G. In addition to its antiprotease activity, SLPI has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory properties including down-regulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in monocytes, inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by IgG immune complexes in a rat model of acute lung injury, and prevention of human immunodeficiency virus infectivity in monocytic cells via as yet unidentified mechanisms. In this report we have shown that SLPI prevents LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation by inhibiting degradation of IkappaBalpha without affecting the LPS-induced phosphorylation and ubiquitination of IkappaBalpha. We have also demonstrated that SLPI prevents LPS-induced interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase and IkappaBbeta degradation. In addition, we have demonstrated that oxidized SLPI, a variant of SLPI that has diminished antiprotease activity, cannot prevent LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation or Inhibitor kappaB alpha/beta degradation indicating that the anti-inflammatory effect of SLPI on the LPS-signaling pathway is dependent on its antiprotease activity. These results suggest that SLPI may be inhibiting proteasomal degradation of NF-kappaB regulatory proteins, an effect that is dependent on the antiprotease activity of SLPI.
Mitochondria-targeted human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (mt-hOgg1) and aconitase-2 (Aco-2) each reduce oxidant-induced alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) apoptosis, but it is unclear whether protection occurs by preventing AEC mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage. Using quantitative PCR-based measurements of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA damage, mtDNA damage was preferentially noted in AEC after exposure to oxidative stress (e.g. amosite asbestos (5-25 μg/cm(2)) or H2O2 (100-250 μM)) for 24 h. Overexpression of wild-type mt-hOgg1 or mt-long α/β 317-323 hOgg1 mutant incapable of DNA repair (mt-hOgg1-Mut) each blocked A549 cell oxidant-induced mtDNA damage, mitochondrial p53 translocation, and intrinsic apoptosis as assessed by DNA fragmentation and cleaved caspase-9. In contrast, compared with controls, knockdown of Ogg1 (using Ogg1 shRNA in A549 cells or primary alveolar type 2 cells from ogg1(-/-) mice) augmented mtDNA lesions and intrinsic apoptosis at base line, and these effects were increased further after exposure to oxidative stress. Notably, overexpression of Aco-2 reduced oxidant-induced mtDNA lesions, mitochondrial p53 translocation, and apoptosis, whereas siRNA for Aco-2 (siAco-2) enhanced mtDNA damage, mitochondrial p53 translocation, and apoptosis. Finally, siAco-2 attenuated the protective effects of mt-hOgg1-Mut but not wild-type mt-hOgg1 against oxidant-induced mtDNA damage and apoptosis. Collectively, these data demonstrate a novel role for mt-hOgg1 and Aco-2 in preserving AEC mtDNA integrity, thereby preventing oxidant-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, p53 mitochondrial translocation, and intrinsic apoptosis. Furthermore, mt-hOgg1 chaperoning of Aco-2 in preventing oxidant-mediated mtDNA damage and apoptosis may afford an innovative target for the molecular events underlying oxidant-induced toxicity.
Mechanical unloading of failing hearts can trigger functional recovery but results in progressive atrophy and possibly detrimental adaptation. In an unbiased approach, we examined the dynamic effects of unloading duration on molecular markers indicative of myocardial damage, hypothesizing that potential recovery may be improved by optimized unloading time.
Heterotopically transplanted normal rat hearts were harvested at 3, 8, 15, 30, and 60 days. Forty-seven genes were analyzed using TaqMan-based microarray, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry.
In parallel with marked atrophy (22% to 64% volume loss at 3 respectively 60 days), expression of myosin heavy-chain isoforms (MHC-α/-β) was characteristically switched in a time-dependent manner. Genes involved in tissue remodeling (FGF-2, CTGF, TGFb, IGF-1) were increasingly upregulated with duration of unloading. A distinct pattern was observed for genes involved in generation of contractile force; an indiscriminate early downregulation was followed by a new steady-state below normal. For pro-apoptotic transcripts bax, bnip-3, and cCasp-6 and -9 mRNA levels demonstrated a slight increase up to 30 days unloading with pronunciation at 60 days. Findings regarding cell death were confirmed on the protein level. Proteasome activity indicated early increase of protein degradation but decreased below baseline in unloaded hearts at 60 days.
We identified incrementally increased apoptosis after myocardial unloading of the normal rat heart, which is exacerbated at late time points (60 days) and inversely related to loss of myocardial mass. Our findings suggest an irreversible detrimental effect of long-term unloading on myocardium that may be precluded by partial reloading and amenable to molecular therapeutic intervention.
Mucolipidosis III gamma (ML III gamma) is a slowly progressive disorder characterized by childhood onset of radiographic evidence of mild to moderate dysostosis multiplex; joint stiffness and pain initially in the shoulders, hips, and fingers; and gradual mild coarsening of facial features. Cardiorespiratory complications (restrictive lung disease, thickening and insufficiency of the mitral and aortic valves, left ventricular hypertrophy) can be significant. A few affected individuals have mild cognitive impairment. Because ML III gamma has only recently been distinguished from the more common ML III alpha/beta, previously published descriptions of ML III may have inadvertently included both of these disorders. Thus, much is to yet be learned about the specific manifestations and natural history of ML III gamma.
In ML III gamma the activity of nearly all lysosomal hydrolases is up to tenfold higher in plasma and other body fluids than in normal controls because of inadequate targeting to lysosomes. ML III gamma is caused by pathogenic variants in GNPTG, which encodes the gamma subunit of the enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucosamine: lysosomal hydrolase N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphotransferase. (Of note, the alpha and beta subunits of this enzyme are encoded by GNPTAB, pathogenic variants in which cause ML III alpha/beta.) Molecular genetic testing of GNPTG detects two pathogenic variants in more than 95% of individuals with ML III gamma.
Treatment of manifestations: Low-impact physical therapy is usually well tolerated. Carpal tunnel signs may require tendon release. In late childhood or early adolescence relief of hip pain becomes important; in older adolescents and adults bilateral hip replacement has been successful. Later in the disease course management focuses on relief of general bone pain associated with osteoporosis. In severe cases, when significant valvular dysfunction disrupts ventricular function, valve replacement should be seriously considered. Prevention of secondary complications: Because of concerns about airway management, surgical intervention should be undertaken only in tertiary care settings with pediatric anesthesiologists and intensivists. Persons with valvular involvement should be given antibiotic prophylaxis before minor and major surgical procedures (including dental procedures) to prevent bacterial endocarditis. Surveillance: Yearly outpatient clinic visits unless cardiac and/or respiratory monitoring need more frequent attention; annual orthopedic assessment; annual ophthalmology evaluation to monitor for corneal opacities and the possibility of adult-onset retinal degeneration; ERG for those with suspected retinal abnormalities; annual monitoring by echocardiogram for progressive valvular insufficiency; DEXA scan every five years to monitor for metabolic bone disease. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Stretching exercises because they are ineffective, painful, and may damage the surrounding joint capsule and adjacent tendons.
ML III gamma is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the pathogenic variants in the family are known.
Mucolipidosis alpha/beta (ML III alpha/beta; pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy), a slowly progressive disorder with clinical onset at approximately age three years, is characterized by slow growth rate and subnormal stature; radiographic evidence of mild to moderate dysostosis multiplex; joint stiffness and pain initially in the shoulders, hips, and fingers; gradual mild coarsening of facial features; and normal to mildly impaired cognitive development. If present, organomegaly is mild. Pain from osteoporosis that is clinically and radiologically apparent in childhood becomes more severe from adolescence. Cardiorespiratory complications (restrictive lung disease, thickening and insufficiency of the mitral and aortic valves, left and/or right ventricular hypertrophy) are common causes of death, typically in early to middle adulthood.
In ML III alpha/beta the activity of nearly all lysosomal hydrolases is up to tenfold higher in plasma and other body fluids than in normal controls because of inadequate targeting to lysosomes. Urinary excretion of oligosaccharides (OSs), a nonspecific finding, is often excessive. Significant deficiency (1%-10% of normal) of the activity of the enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucosamine: lysosomal hydrolase N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase (GNPTA), encoded by GNPTAB, confirms the diagnosis. Bidirectional sequencing of the entire GNPTAB coding region detects two pathogenic variants in more than 95% of individuals with ML III alpha/beta.
Treatment of manifestations: Low-impact physical therapy is usually well tolerated. Myringotomy tube placement may be indicated in the treatment of recurrent otitis media. Carpal tunnel signs may require tendon release. In late childhood or early adolescence symptomatic relief of hip pain may be initially accomplished with over-the-counter analgesics; in some older adolescents and adults with milder phenotypic variants, bilateral hip replacement has been successful. Later in the disease course management focuses on relief of general bone pain associated with osteoporosis, which has responded in a few individuals to scheduled intermittent IV administration of the bisphosphonate pamidronate. Prevention of secondary complications: Because of concerns about airway management, surgical intervention should be undertaken only in tertiary care settings with pediatric anesthesiologists and intensivists. Surveillance: Twice-yearly outpatient clinic visits for young children; annual routine follow-up visits after age six years unless bone pain, deteriorating ambulation, and/or cardiac and respiratory monitoring need more frequent attention.

Ku70 and Ku80 play an essential role in the DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway, i.e., nonhomologous DNA-end-joining (NHEJ). No accumulation mechanisms of Ku70 at DSBs have been clarified in detail, although the accumulation mechanism of Ku70 at DSBs plays key roles in regulating the NHEJ activity. Here, we show the essential domains for the accumulation and function of Ku70 at DSBs in living lung epithelial cells. Our results showed that EGFP-Ku70 accumulation at DSBs began immediately after irradiation. Our findings demonstrate that three domains of Ku70, i.e., the α/β, DNA-binding, and Ku80-binding domains, but not the SAP domain, are necessary for the accumulation at or recognition of DSBs in the early stage after irradiation. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that the leucine at amino acid 385 of Ku70 in the Ku80-binding domain, but not the three target amino acids for acetylation in the DNA-binding domain, is involved in the localization and accumulation of Ku70 at DSBs. Furthermore, accumulations of XRCC4 and XLF, but not that of Artemis, at DSBs are dependent on the presence of Ku70. These findings suggest that Artemis can work in not only the Ku-dependent repair process, but also the Ku-independent process at DSBs in living epithelial cells.
The appearance of highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses of the H5N1 subtype being able to infect humans and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic reveals the urgent need for new and efficient countermeasures against these viruses. The long-term efficacy of current antivirals is often limited, because of the emergence of drug-resistant virus mutants. A growing understanding of the virus-host interaction raises the possibility to explore alternative targets involved in the viral replication. In the present study we show that the proteasome inhibitor VL-01 leads to reduction of influenza virus replication in human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells (A549) as demonstrated with three different influenza virus strains, A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) (EC50 value of 1.7 μM), A/Regensburg/D6/09 (H1N1v) (EC50 value of 2.4 μM) and A/Mallard/Bavaria/1/2006 (H5N1) (EC50 value of 0.8 μM). In in vivo experiments we could demonstrate that VL-01-aerosol-treatment of BALB/c mice with 14.1 mg/kg results in no toxic side effects, reduced progeny virus titers in the lung (1.1 ± 0.3 log10 pfu) and enhanced survival of mice after infection with a 5-fold MLD50 of the human influenza A virus strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) up to 50%. Furthermore, treatment of mice with VL-01 reduced the cytokine release of IL-α/β, IL-6, MIP-1β, RANTES and TNF-α induced by LPS or highly pathogen avian H5N1 influenza A virus. The present data demonstrates an antiviral effect of VL-01 in vitro and in vivo and the ability to reduce influenza virus induced cytokines and chemokines.
We previously showed that thrombin induces interleukin (IL)-8/CXCL8 expression via the protein kinase C (PKC)α/c-Src-dependent IκB kinase α/β (IKKα/β)/NF-κB signaling pathway in human lung epithelial cells. In this study, we further investigated the roles of Rac1, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and Akt in thrombin-induced NF-κB activation and IL-8/CXCL8 expression. Thrombin-induced IL-8/CXCL8 release and IL-8/CXCL8-luciferase activity were attenuated by a PI3K inhibitor (LY294002), an Akt inhibitor (1-L-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol-2-((R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate)), and the dominant negative mutants of Rac1 (RacN17) and Akt (AktDN). Treatment of cells with thrombin caused activation of Rac and Akt. The thrombin-induced increase in Akt activation was inhibited by RacN17 and LY294002. Stimulation of cells with thrombin resulted in increases in IKKα/β activation and κB-luciferase activity; these effects were inhibited by RacN17, LY294002, an Akt inhibitor, and AktDN. Treatment of cells with thrombin induced Gβγ, p85α, and Rac1 complex formation in a time-dependent manner. These results imply that thrombin activates the Rac1/PI3K/Akt pathway through formation of the Gβγ, Rac1, and p85α complex to induce IKKα/β activation, NF-κB transactivation, and IL-8/CXCL8 expression in human lung epithelial cells.
Lung inflammation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of many respiratory diseases that are in need of new therapeutic strategies. Previously, we showed that inhibition of α/β-hydrolase domain 6 (ABHD6) decreased macrophage activation and exerted anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, we thought to assess the effects of ABHD6 inhibition in a mouse model of acute lung injury (ALI) induced by intratracheal administration of lipopolysaccharides. ABHD6 inhibition with N-methyl- N-{[3-(4-pyridinyl)phenyl]methyl}-carbamic acid 4'-(aminocarbonyl)(1,1'-biphenyl)-4-yl ester (WWL70) decreases most of the hallmarks of ALI, including neutrophil infiltration, cytokine secretion, and protein extravasation. mRNA expression of proinflammatory markers in the cells recovered in the bronchoalveolar lavage was also decreased. Interestingly, ABHD6 inhibition was more efficient than monoacylglycerol lipase inhibition by 4-nitrophenyl-4-[dibenzo(d)(14)dioxol-5-yl(hydroxy)methyl]piperidine-1-carboxylate. We also studied ABHD6 inhibition on primary alveolar macrophages and neutrophils to explore their potential implication in the effects of ABHD6 inhibition in vivo. Moreover, we quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry the levels of reported substrates of ABHD6 [ i.e., 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and lysophospholipids]. The potential implication of these lipid mediators in the effects of WWL70 was further investigated on primary alveolar macrophages. Taken together, these data support ABHD6 inhibition as an interesting anti-inflammatory strategy in acute lung inflammation and assess the possible contribution of 2-AG and lysophospholipids in the observed effects.-Bottemanne, P., Paquot, A., Ameraoui, H., Alhouayek, M., Muccioli, G. G. The α/β-hydrolase domain 6 inhibitor WWL70 decreases endotoxin-induced lung inflammation in mice, potential contribution of 2-arachidonoylglycerol, and lysoglycerophospholipids.
The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonizes the lungs of susceptible individuals by deploying virulence factors targeting host defenses. The secreted factor Cif (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator inhibitory factor) dysregulates the endocytic recycling of CFTR and thus reduces CFTR abundance in host epithelial membranes. We have postulated that the decrease in ion secretion mediated by Cif would slow mucociliary transport and decrease bacterial clearance from the lungs. To test this hypothesis, we explored the effects of Cif in cultured epithelia and in the lungs of mice. We developed a strategy to interpret the "hurricane-like" motions observed in reconstituted cultures and identified a Cif-mediated decrease in the velocity of mucus transport in vitro. Presence of Cif also increased the number of bacteria recovered at two time points in an acute mouse model of pneumonia caused by P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, recent work has demonstrated an inverse correlation between the airway concentrations of Cif and 15-epi-lipoxin A4, a proresolving lipid mediator important in host defense and the resolution of pathogen-initiated inflammation. Here, we observe elevated levels of 15-epi-lipoxin A4 in the lungs of mice infected with a strain of P. aeruginosa that expresses only an inactive form of cif compared with those mice infected with wild-type P. aeruginosa. Together these data support the inclusion of Cif on the list of virulence factors that assist P. aeruginosa in colonizing and damaging the airways of compromised patients. Furthermore, this study establishes techniques that enable our groups to explore the underlying mechanisms of Cif effects during respiratory infection.
Chi3l1 is induced by a variety of cancers where it portends a poor prognosis and plays a key role in the generation of metastasis. However, the mechanisms that Chi3l1 uses to mediate these responses and the pathways that control Chi3l1-induced tumor responses are poorly understood. We characterized the mechanisms that Chi3l1 uses to foster tumor progression and the ability of the RIG-like helicase (RLH) innate immune response to control Chi3l1 elaboration and pulmonary metastasis. Here we demonstrate that RLH activation inhibits tumor induction of Chi3l1 and the expression of receptor IL-13Rα2 and pulmonary metastasis while restoring NK cell accumulation and activation, augmenting the expression of IFN-α/β, chemerin and its receptor ChemR23, p-cofilin, LIMK2 and PTEN and inhibiting BRAF and NLRX1 in a MAVS-dependent manner. These studies demonstrate that Chi3l1 is a multifaceted immune stimulator of tumor progression and metastasis whose elaboration and tissue effects are abrogated by RLH innate immune responses.
Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) is a carcinogen in cigarette smoke. We found that B[a]P induced SIRT1 in human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cell. SIRT1 was overexpressed in the lung of B[a]P-exposed mice and in human lung cancer biopsies. SIRT1 up-regulated TNF-α and β-catenin and down-regulated the membrane fraction of E-cadherin. In addition, SIRT1 promoted invasion, migration and tumorigenesis of BEAS-2B cells in nude mice upon B[a]P exposure. Thus, SIRT1 is involved in B[a]P-induced transformation associated with activation of the TNF-α/β-catenin axis and is as a potential therapeutic target for lung cancer. 
Type I interferon (IFN-α/β or IFN-I) signals through two receptor subunits, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, to orchestrate sterile and infectious immunity. Cellular pathways that regulate IFNAR1 are often targeted by viruses to suppress the antiviral effects of IFN-I. Here we report that encephalitic flaviviruses, including tick-borne encephalitis virus and West Nile virus, antagonize IFN-I signaling by inhibiting IFNAR1 surface expression. Loss of IFNAR1 was associated with binding of the viral IFN-I antagonist, NS5, to prolidase (PEPD), a cellular dipeptidase implicated in primary immune deficiencies in humans. Prolidase was required for IFNAR1 maturation and accumulation, activation of IFNβ-stimulated gene induction, and IFN-I-dependent viral control. Human fibroblasts derived from patients with genetic prolidase deficiency exhibited decreased IFNAR1 surface expression and reduced IFNβ-stimulated signaling. Thus, by understanding flavivirus IFN-I antagonism, prolidase is revealed as a central regulator of IFN-I responses. 
Lysosomal phospholipase A2 (LPLA2) and lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) belong to a structurally uncharacterized family of key lipid-metabolizing enzymes responsible for lung surfactant catabolism and for reverse cholesterol transport, respectively. Whereas LPLA2 is predicted to underlie the development of drug-induced phospholipidosis, somatic mutations in LCAT cause fish eye disease and familial LCAT deficiency. Here we describe several high-resolution crystal structures of human LPLA2 and a low-resolution structure of LCAT that confirms its close structural relationship to LPLA2. Insertions in the α/β hydrolase core of LPLA2 form domains that are responsible for membrane interaction and binding the acyl chains and head groups of phospholipid substrates. The LCAT structure suggests the molecular basis underlying human disease for most of the known LCAT missense mutations, and paves the way for rational development of new therapeutics to treat LCAT deficiency, atherosclerosis and acute coronary syndrome. 
Intracellular ISG15 is an interferon (IFN)-α/β-inducible ubiquitin-like modifier which can covalently bind other proteins in a process called ISGylation; it is an effector of IFN-α/β-dependent antiviral immunity in mice. We previously published a study describing humans with inherited ISG15 deficiency but without unusually severe viral diseases. We showed that these patients were prone to mycobacterial disease and that human ISG15 was non-redundant as an extracellular IFN-γ-inducing molecule. We show here that ISG15-deficient patients also display unanticipated cellular, immunological and clinical signs of enhanced IFN-α/β immunity, reminiscent of the Mendelian autoinflammatory interferonopathies Aicardi-Goutières syndrome and spondyloenchondrodysplasia. We further show that an absence of intracellular ISG15 in the patients' cells prevents the accumulation of USP18, a potent negative regulator of IFN-α/β signalling, resulting in the enhancement and amplification of IFN-α/β responses. Human ISG15, therefore, is not only redundant for antiviral immunity, but is a key negative regulator of IFN-α/β immunity. In humans, intracellular ISG15 is IFN-α/β-inducible not to serve as a substrate for ISGylation-dependent antiviral immunity, but to ensure USP18-dependent regulation of IFN-α/β and prevention of IFN-α/β-dependent autoinflammation. 
We aimed to investigate whether vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) influences apolipoprotein M (ApoM) expression and pre-β-high-density lipoprotin (HDL) formation, and whether forkhead box A2 (Foxa2) and Nur77 are involved in this process.
We analyzed the serum VEGF concentrations of 264 adults who underwent a medical checkup and found that VEGF concentration was positively correlated with serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), and ApoB concentrations, but was negatively correlated with serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and ApoM concentrations. We further investigated the effects of VEGF on ApoM expression and pre-β-HDL formation, and the mechanisms responsible, in HepG2 cells and mouse primary hepatocytes. VEGF markedly downregulated ApoM expression and pre-β-HDL formation. At the same time, expression of Foxa2 was also inhibited, whereas expression of Nur77 was increased by treatment with VEGF. Furthermore, small interfering (si) RNA knockdown of Foxa2 made the downregulation of VEGF on ApoM expression and pre-β-HDL formation even more obvious. In addition, siRNA knockdown of Nur77 significantly compensated for the inhibitory effect of VEGF on Foxa2 expression, whereas the Nur77 agonist cytosporone B led to the downregulation of Foxa2 expression more significantly than VEGF. Moreover, overexpression of a Nur77 transgene in C57BL/6 mice resulted in decreased serum ApoM and pre-β-HDL levels, whereas si-Nur77-treated mice displayed upregulated serum ApoM and pre-β-HDL levels.
These results provide evidence that VEGF may first downregulate expression of Foxa2 by enhancing Nur77 activity and then decrease expression of ApoM and pre-β-HDL formation. Therefore, our study may be useful in understanding the critical effect of VEGF in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is one of the most frequent causes of abnormal liver dysfunction associated with synthesis and oxidation of fatty acids. Adiponectin receptors (AdipoR1/R2) and insulin receptor substrates (IRS-1/-2) are known as modulators of these fatty acid metabolisms in the liver; however, the regulatory roles of these receptors in the synthesis and oxidation of fatty acids are unclear in the liver of NASH. In this study, we examined the roles of hepatic AdipoR1/R2 and IRS-1/-2 in NASH using an animal model. After feeding a high-fat and high-cholesterol diet to obese fa/fa Zucker rats for 8 weeks, rats showed fatty liver spontaneously with inflammation and fibrosis that are characteristic of NASH. The expression levels of AdipoR1/R2 and IRS-2 were significantly decreased, whereas IRS-1 was significantly increased, in NASH. As a result of the decrease of AdipoR1/R2 expression, the messenger RNA expression levels of genes located downstream of AdipoR1/R2, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase α1/α2, which inhibits fatty acid synthesis, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α, which activates fatty acid oxidation, also decreased. Expression level of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c was found to be elevated, suggesting the up-regulation of IRS-1, and resulted in increased fatty acid synthesis. Furthermore, increase of forkhead box protein A2 expression was observed, which might be associated with the down-regulation of IRS-2, facilitating fatty acid oxidation. Taken together, increased synthesis and oxidation of fatty acids by up- or down-regulation of AdipoR or IRS may contribute to the progression of NASH. Thus, AdipoR and IRS might be crucially important regulators for the synthesis and oxidation of fatty acids in the liver of NASH.
Small heterodimer partner (SHP; NR0B2) is an atypical orphan nuclear receptor and acts as a coregulator of various nuclear receptors. Herein, we examined a novel cross talk between SHP and a forkhead transcription factor HNF3 (hepatocyte nuclear factor 3/Foxa. Transient transfection assay demonstrated that SHP inhibited the transcriptional activity of all three isoforms of HNF3, HNF3alpha, beta, and gamma. In vivo and in vitro protein interaction studies showed that SHP physically interacted with HNF3. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SHP significantly decreased the mRNA levels of glucose-6-phosphase (G6Pase), cholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) in HepG2 cells and rat primary hepatocytes. Moreover, the mRNA level of G6Pase was notably increased by down-regulation of SHP with small interfering RNA. Interestingly, HNF3 transactivity was still repressed by SHPDelta128-139 that fails to repress nuclear receptors. Mapping of interaction domain revealed that SHP interacted with forkhead DNA binding domain of HNF3alpha. Gel mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that SHP inhibits DNA binding of HNF3. These results suggest that SHP is involved in the regulation of G6Pase, CYP7A1, and PEPCK gene expression via novel mechanism of inhibition of HNF3 activity and expand the role of SHP as a coregulator of other family of transcription factors in addition to nuclear receptors.
Veratrum alkaloids and distal inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis have been studied for more than 30 years as potent teratogens capable of inducing cyclopia and other birth defects. Here, it is shown that these compounds specifically block the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway. These teratogens did not prevent the sterol modification of Shh during autoprocessing but rather inhibited the response of target tissues to Shh, possibly acting through the sterol sensing domain within the Patched protein regulator of Shh response.
MicroRNA-122 (miR-122) is a liver-specific microRNA whose expression is specifically turned on in the mouse liver during embryogenesis, thus it is expected to be involved in liver development. However, the role of miR-122 in liver development and its potential underlying mechanism remain unclear. Here, we show that the expression of miR-122 is closely correlated with four liver-enriched transcription factors (LETFs)-hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 1α, HNF3β, HNF4α, and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) α-in the livers of developing mouse embryos and in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines. Correspondingly, promoter analysis revealed that these LETFs are coordinately involved in the transcriptional regulation of miR-122, and three HNFs directly bind to the miR-122 promoter as transcriptional activators. Using a luciferase reporter system, we identified a group of miR-122 targets involved in proliferation and differentiation regulation. Among these targets, the most prominently repressed target was CUTL1, a transcriptional repressor of genes specifying terminal differentiation in multiple cell lineages, including hepatocytes. We show that CUTL1 expression is gradually silenced at the posttranscriptional level during mouse liver development. Overexpression and knockdown studies both showed that miR-122 repressed CUTL1 protein expression in HCC cell lines. Finally, we show that the stable restoration of miR-122 in HepG2 cells suppresses cellular proliferation and activates the expression of three hepatocyte functional genes, including the cholesterol-7α hydroxylase gene (CYP7A1), a known target of CUTL1 in hepatocytes.
Our study provides a model in which miR-122 functions as an effector of LETFs and contributes to liver development by regulating the balance between proliferation and differentiation of hepatocytes, at least by targeting CUTL1.
Forkhead transcription factor Foxa2 activates genes involved in hepatic lipid metabolism and is regulated by insulin. Activation of Foxa2 in the liver leads to increased oxidation and secretion of fatty acids in the form of triacylglycerols (TAGs), a process impaired in type 2 diabetes. Here, we demonstrate that Foxa2 is coactivated by PPARgamma coactivator beta (Pgc-1beta). Adenoviral expression of Foxa2 and Pgc-1beta in livers of ob/ob mice results in decreased hepatic TAG content and increased plasma TAG concentrations. In addition, the concerted action of Foxa2/Pgc-1beta activates genes in mitochondrial beta oxidation and enhances fatty acid metabolism. Furthermore, Foxa2/Pgc-1beta induce the expression of microsomal transfer protein, thereby increasing apoB-containing VLDL secretion. This process is inhibited by insulin through a Foxa2-dependent mechanism. These data demonstrate that Foxa2/Pgc-1beta regulate hepatic lipid homeostasis by affecting the clearance rate of fatty acids through oxidation and/or secretion of lipids in response to insulin.
Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) hydrolyses cholesteryl esters and triacylglycerols (TG) within lysosomes to mobilise NEFA and cholesterol. Since LAL-deficient (Lal (-/-) ) mice suffer from progressive loss of adipose tissue and severe accumulation of lipids in hepatic lysosomes, we hypothesised that LAL deficiency triggers alternative energy pathway(s).
We studied metabolic adaptations in Lal (-/-) mice.
Despite loss of adipose tissue, Lal (-/-) mice show enhanced glucose clearance during insulin and glucose tolerance tests and have increased uptake of [(3)H]2-deoxy-D-glucose into skeletal muscle compared with wild-type mice. In agreement, fasted Lal (-/-) mice exhibit reduced glucose and glycogen levels in skeletal muscle. We observed 84% decreased plasma leptin levels and significantly reduced hepatic ATP, glucose, glycogen and glutamine concentrations in fed Lal (-/-) mice. Markedly reduced hepatic acyl-CoA concentrations decrease the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) target genes. However, treatment of Lal (-/-) mice with the PPARα agonist fenofibrate further decreased plasma TG (and hepatic glucose and glycogen) concentrations in Lal (-/-) mice. Depletion of hepatic nuclear factor 4α and forkhead box protein a2 in fasted Lal (-/-) mice might be responsible for reduced expression of microsomal TG transfer protein, defective VLDL synthesis and drastically reduced plasma TG levels.
Our findings indicate that neither activation nor inactivation of PPARα per se but rather the availability of hepatic acyl-CoA concentrations regulates VLDL synthesis and subsequent metabolic adaptations in Lal (-/-) mice. We conclude that decreased plasma VLDL production enhances glucose uptake into skeletal muscle to compensate for the lack of energy supply.
Cellular metabolism is increasingly recognized as a controller of immune cell fate and function. MicroRNA-33 (miR-33) regulates cellular lipid metabolism and represses genes involved in cholesterol efflux, HDL biogenesis, and fatty acid oxidation. Here, we determined that miR-33-mediated disruption of the balance of aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation instructs macrophage inflammatory polarization and shapes innate and adaptive immune responses. Macrophage-specific Mir33 deletion increased oxidative respiration, enhanced spare respiratory capacity, and induced an M2 macrophage polarization-associated gene profile. Furthermore, miR-33-mediated M2 polarization required miR-33 targeting of the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), but not cholesterol efflux. Notably, miR-33 inhibition increased macrophage expression of the retinoic acid-producing enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1, subfamily A2 (ALDH1A2) and retinal dehydrogenase activity both in vitro and in a mouse model. Consistent with the ability of retinoic acid to foster inducible Tregs, miR-33-depleted macrophages had an enhanced capacity to induce forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) expression in naive CD4(+) T cells. Finally, treatment of hypercholesterolemic mice with miR-33 inhibitors for 8 weeks resulted in accumulation of inflammation-suppressing M2 macrophages and FOXP3(+) Tregs in plaques and reduced atherosclerosis progression. Collectively, these results reveal that miR-33 regulates macrophage inflammation and demonstrate that miR-33 antagonism is atheroprotective, in part, by reducing plaque inflammation by promoting M2 macrophage polarization and Treg induction.
Characterization of the epigenome promises to yield the functional elements buried in the human genome sequence, thus helping to annotate non-coding DNA polymorphisms with regulatory functions. Here, we develop two novel strategies to combine epigenomic data with transcriptomic profiles in humans or mice to prioritize potential candidate SNPs associated with lipid levels by genome-wide association study (GWAS). First, after confirming that lipid-associated loci that are also expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in human livers are enriched for ENCODE regulatory marks in the human hepatocellular HepG2 cell line, we prioritize candidate SNPs based on the number of these marks that overlap the variant position. This method recognized the known SORT1 rs12740374 regulatory SNP associated with LDL-cholesterol, and highlighted candidate functional SNPs at 15 additional lipid loci. In the second strategy, we combine ENCODE chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) data and liver expression datasets from knockout mice lacking specific transcription factors. This approach identified SNPs in specific transcription factor binding sites that are located near target genes of these transcription factors. We show that FOXA2 transcription factor binding sites are enriched at lipid-associated loci and experimentally validate that alleles of one such proxy SNP located near the FOXA2 target gene BIRC5 show allelic differences in FOXA2-DNA binding and enhancer activity. These methods can be used to generate testable hypotheses for many non-coding SNPs associated with complex diseases or traits. 
The reprogramming of adult cells into pluripotent cells or directly into alternative adult cell types represents a great potential technology for regenerative medicine. In the present study, the potential of key developmental adipogenic, neurogenic and hepatogenic regulators to reprogram human fibroblasts into adipocytes, neurocytes and hepatocytes was investigated. The results demonstrated that direct reprogramming of octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4) and CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)β activated C/EBPα and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ expression, inducing the conversion of fibroblasts into adipocytes. Similarly, direct reprogramming of the transcription factors sex determining region-box 2, trans-acting T-cell specific transcription factor (GATA-3) and neurogenic differentiation 1 in fibroblasts may induce neurogenic differentiation through hemagglutinating virus of Japan envelope (HVJ-E) transfection. Moreover, hepatogenic differentiation was induced by combining the direct reprogramming of Oct4, GATA-3, hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 homeobox α and forkhead box protein A2 in fibroblasts. These results demonstrate that specific transcription factors and reprogramming factors are able to directly reprogram fibroblasts into adipogenic, neurogenic and hepatogenic differentiation lineages by HVJ-E transfection.
Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous, small non-coding RNAs which function as essential posttranscriptional modulators of gene expression tightly involved in a wide range of diseases, including the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, the present study was designed to investigate the expression levels and cellular roles of miR-200a in HCC. Methods: Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression levels of miR-200a in serums and cell lines. Bioinformation analysis, the luciferase reporter assay, qRT-PCR and western blotting were employed to validate Foxa2 as a direct target gene of miR-200a. Cell proliferation, migration and invasion were assessed to identify whether miR-200a could regulate the biological behaviors of HCC cells by targeting Foxa2. Results: In this study, a low level of miR-200a was observed in patients' serums and HCC cell lines. Overexpression of miR-200a in HCC cell lines reduced cell proliferation, migration and invasion. In addition, transcription factor forkhead box A2 (Foxa2) was identified as a novel target of miR-200a and downregulated at mRNA and protein levels in miR-200a overexpressed cells. Meanwhile, restoration of Foxa2 significantly reversed the tumor suppressive effects of miR-200a. Conclusions: These findings indicate that miR-200a regulates the proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells by targeting Foxa2, suggesting that miR-200a may function as a potential therapeutic molecular for the diagnosis and treatment of the liver cancer.
GLI-similar 3 (GLIS3), a member of the Krüppel-like zinc finger protein subfamily, is predominantly expressed in the pancreas, thyroid and kidney. Glis3 mRNA can be initially detected in mouse pancreas at embryonic day 11.5 and is largely restricted to β cells, pancreatic polypeptide-expressing cells, as well as ductal cells at later stage of pancreas development. Mutations in GLIS3 cause a neonatal diabetes syndrome, characterized by neonatal diabetes, congenital hypothyroidism and polycystic kidney. Importantly, genome-wide association studies showed that variations of GLIS3 are strongly associated with both type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in multiple populations. GLIS3 cooperates with pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1), v-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene family, protein A (MAFA), as well as neurogenic differentiation 1 (NEUROD1) and potently controls insulin gene transcription. GLIS3 also plays a role in β cell survival and likely in insulin secretion. Any perturbation of these functions may underlie all three forms of diabetes. GLIS3, synergistically with hepatocyte nuclear factor 6 (HNF6) and forkhead box A2 (FOXA2), controls fetal islet differentiation via transactivating neurogenin 3 (NGN3) and impairment of this function leads to neonatal diabetes. In addition, GLIS3 is also required for the compensatory β cell proliferation and mass expansion in response to insulin resistance, which if disrupted may predispose to T2D. The increasing understanding of the mechanisms of GLIS3 in β cell development, survival and function maintenance will provide new insights into disease pathogenesis and potential therapeutic target identification to combat diabetes.
Apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) is a key component of high density lipoproteins which possess anti-atherosclerotic and anti-inflammatory properties. Insulin is a crucial mediator of the glucose and lipid metabolism that has been implicated in atherosclerotic and inflammatory processes. Important mediators of insulin signaling such as Liver X Receptors (LXRs) and Forkhead Box A2 (FOXA2) are known to regulate apoA-I expression in liver. Forkhead Box O1 (FOXO1) is a well-known target of insulin signaling and a key mediator of oxidative stress response. Low doses of insulin were shown to activate apoA-I expression in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. However, the detailed mechanisms for these processes are still unknown. We studied the possible involvement of FOXO1, FOXA2, LXRα, and LXRβ transcription factors in the insulin-mediated regulation of apoA-I expression. Treatment of HepG2 cells with high doses of insulin (48 h, 100 nM) suppresses apoA-I gene expression. siRNAs against FOXO1, FOXA2, LXRβ, or LXRα abrogated this effect. FOXO1 forms a complex with LXRβ and insulin treatment impairs FOXO1/LXRβ complex binding to hepatic enhancer and triggers its nuclear export. Insulin as well as LXR ligand TO901317 enhance the interaction between FOXA2, LXRα, and hepatic enhancer. These data suggest that high doses of insulin downregulate apoA-I gene expression in HepG2 cells through redistribution of FOXO1/LXRβ complex, FOXA2, and LXRα on hepatic enhancer of apoA-I gene. J.

Despite being one of the most common neurological diseases, it is unknown whether there may be a genetic basis to temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Whole genome analyses were performed to test the hypothesis that temporal cortical gene expression differs between TLE patients with high vs. low baseline seizure frequency.
Baseline seizure frequency was used as a clinical measure of epileptogenicity. Twenty-four patients in high or low seizure frequency groups (median seizures/month) underwent anterior temporal lobectomy with amygdalohippocampectomy for intractable TLE. RNA was isolated from the lateral temporal cortex and submitted for expression analysis. Genes significantly associated with baseline seizure frequency on likelihood ratio test were identified based on &gt;0.90 area under the ROC curve, P value of &lt;0.05.
Expression levels of forty genes were significantly associated with baseline seizure frequency. Of the seven most significant, four have been linked to other neurologic diseases. Expression levels associated with high seizure frequency included low expression of Homeobox A10, Forkhead box A2, Lymphoblastic leukemia derived sequence 1, HGF activator, Kelch repeat and BTB (POZ) domain containing 11, Thanatos-associated protein domain containing 8 and Heparin sulfate (glucosamine) 3-O-sulfotransferase 3A1.
This study describes novel associations between forty known genes and a clinical marker of epileptogenicity, baseline seizure frequency. Four of the seven discussed have been previously related to other neurologic diseases. Future investigation of these genes could establish new biomarkers for predicting epileptogenicity, and could have significant implications for diagnosis and management of temporal lobe epilepsy, as well as epilepsy pathogenesis.
BACKGROUND Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are emerging as a new class of anti-cancer drugs that promote cancer cell apoptosis, and include suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA). The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of SAHA-induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer cell lines, DU145 and PC-3. MATERIAL AND METHODS Cell lines, DU145 and PC-3, were studied before and after treatment with SAHA. The effects of SAHA treatment on cell proliferation were studied using the MTT cell proliferation assay. Annexin-V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and propidium iodide (PI) staining were used to study the effects of SAHA treatment on cell apoptosis. Western blotting, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and short interfering (si)RNA assays were performed to study the effects of SAHA treatment on apoptotic and cell cycle proteins and the Akt/FOXO3a signaling pathway. RESULTS Treatment with SAHA inhibited cell proliferation in human prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and PC-3 cells in a dose-dependent way. Cell cycle analysis and Annexin-V FITC/PI staining showed that treatment with SAHA resulted in G2/M cell cycle arrest and increased cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent way. Also, treatment with SAHA reduced the protein expression levels cyclin B and cyclin A2 and promoted the activation of FOXO3a by inhibiting Akt activation. Western blotting, the siRNA assay, and qPCR showed that FOXO3a, the Bcl-2 family of proteins, survivin, and FasL were involved in SAHA-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells grown in vitro. CONCLUSIONS Treatment with SAHA promoted apoptosis via the Akt/FOXO3a signaling pathway in prostate cancer cells in vitro.
The prostanoid thromboxane (TX)A2 signals through the TPα and TPβ isoforms of T Prostanoid receptor (TP) that are transcriptionally regulated by distinct promoters termed Prm1 and Prm3, respectively, within the TBXA2R gene. We recently demonstrated that expression of TPα and TPβ is increased in PCa, differentially correlating with Gleason grade and with altered CpG methylation of the individual Prm1/Prm3 regions within the TBXA2R. The current study sought to localise the sites of CpG methylation within Prm1 and Prm3, and to identify the main transcription factors regulating TPβ expression through Prm3 in the prostate adenocarcinoma PC-3 and LNCaP cell lines. Bisulfite sequencing revealed extensive differences in the pattern and status of CpG methylation of the individual Prm1 and Prm3 regions that regulate TPα and TPβ expression, respectively, within the TBXA2R. More specifically, Prm1 is predominantly hypomethylated while Prm3 is hypermethylated across its entire sequence in PC-3 and LNCaP cells. Furthermore, the tumour suppressors FOXP1 and NKX3.1, strongly implicated in PCa development, were identified as key transcription factors regulating TPβ expression through Prm3 in both PCa cell lines. Specific siRNA-disruption of FOXP1 and NKX3.1 each coincided with up-regulated TPβ protein and mRNA expression, while genetic-reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses confirmed that both FOXP1 and NKX3.1 bind to cis‑elements within Prm3 to transcriptionally repress TPβ in the PCa lines. Collectively these data identify Prm3/TPβ as a bona fide target of FOXP1 and NKX3.1 regulation, providing a mechanistic basis, at least in part, for the highly significant upregulation of TPβ expression in PCa.
Decellularized tissues (DETs) have been attracting great attention as scaffolds for tissue-engineering approaches. Recently, some studies have reported that decellularized liver tissues (DLT) can provide an excellent environment for the hepatocytic differentiation of hepatic stem/progenitor cells that were already committed to the hepatocyte lineage. However, the effects of DLT on the hepatocytic differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSs) have not yet been established. Here we studied the hepatocytic differentiation of iPSs on DLT and decellularized heart tissues (DHT) in order to determine the tissue-specific effects of DETs on iPSs differentiation. Our results showed that DLTs led to higher gene expression levels of forkhead box A2 (a marker of endoderm) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α (master transcription factor to hepatocyte differentiation), alpha-fetoprotein (a marker of fetal hepatocyte,), and albumin (a marker of fetal and mature hepatocyte) of iPSs than on DHTs. Furthermore, gene expression levels of tyrosine aminotransferase (a marker of mature hepatocyte) were higher on DLT than that on DHT, and immunocytochemical analysis and ELISA assay showed that albumin secretion level of iPSs on DLT was higher than that on DHT. Our study demonstrated that the use of DLTs led to mature hepatocytic differentiation levels of iPSs compared to DHTs, which provides a better niche for iPSs cell engineering and enables the preparation of useful mature cells for regenerative therapy.
Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (iPAH) is characterized by obstructive hyperproliferation and apoptosis resistance of distal pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). T-type Ca2+ channel blockers have been shown to reduce experimental pulmonary hypertension, although the impact of T-type channel inhibition remains unexplored in PASMCs from iPAH patients. Here we show that T-type channels Cav3.1 and Cav3.2 are present in the lung and PASMCs from iPAH patients and control subjects. The blockade of T-type channels by the specific blocker, TTA-A2, prevents cell cycle progression and PASMCs growth. In iPAH cells, T-type channel signaling fails to activate phosphatase PP2A, leading to an increase in ERK1/2, P38 activation. Moreover, T-type channel signaling is redirected towards the activation of the kinase Akt1, leading to increased expression of the anti-apoptotic protein survivin, and a decrease in the pro-apoptotic mediator FoxO3A. Finally, in iPAH cells, Akt1 is no longer able to regulate caspase 9 activation, whereas T-type channel overexpression reverses PP2A defect in iPAH cells but reinforces the deleterious effects of Akt1 activation. Altogether, these data highlight T-type channel signaling as a strong trigger of the pathological phenotype of PASMCs from iPAH patients (hyper-proliferation/cells survival and apoptosis resistance), suggesting that both T-type channels and PP2A may be promising therapeutic targets for pulmonary hypertension.
When diabetes is associated with congenital malformations, without autoimmune antibodies, a genetic cause is suspected. Here, we aimed to identify a defective gene that led to diabetes.
We performed an exome analysis of an index case and his healthy parents.
The child presented with childhood-onset diabetes, congenital hypopituitarism, cardiac malformation, and anal atresia. A DNA analysis revealed a heterozygous de novo pathogenic variant in the developmental transcription factor, forkhead box A2 (FOXA2). The mutation resided in the DNA-binding domain, which is highly conserved among species. Tridimensional molecular dynamics simulation modeling predicted an altered interaction between the mutated protein and DNA.
A defect in the FOXA2 DNA-binding domain was associated with childhood-onset diabetes and multiple congenital anomalies, which reflected the pleiotropic nature of the gene. This report extends the recently described phenotype of neonatal hypoglycemia to later-onset diabetes. We suggest to include FOXA2 analysis for neonatal hypoglycemia and to implement a long-term follow-up, particularly for the risk of diabetes.
Hepatocyte-like cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells could be an important cell source for hepatocyte transplantation. The present study investigated the effect of retaining mTeSR1 medium during hepatic differentiation on hepatocyte-like cells in vitro.
Human embryonic stem cell line H1 were treated with activin A and bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) for definitive endoderm (DE) cell induction and subsequently treated with BMP2 and fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4) for early hepatic cell induction. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and fibroblast growth factor (KGF) were added for early hepatic cell expansion and then mixed with oncostatin-M for maturation. During DE induction, 0%, 25%, 50% and 75% concentrations of mTeSR1 medium were separately added for early hepatic induction and expansion. For optimization, the expression levels of SRY-related HMG-box 17 (SOX17) and forkhead box A2 (FOXA2) at day 4, alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) at day 15, and albumin (ALB) at day 25 were quantified in differentiated cells by qRT-PCR. The ALB-positive cell proportion was measured by flow cytometry. Functional tests including ALB secretion and indocyanine green (ICG) angiography uptake and release by ELISA, urea production by urea assay kit, and glycogen storage ability by periodic acid Schif reaction (PAS) staining were performed in the differentiated cells. The induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells were used to examine whether the optimized method was suitable for differentiating iPS cells. DE and hepatic markers were detected by immunostaining, and functional testing was performed as described above. Flow cytometry with an Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit and fluorescence microscopy with Hoechst 33258 were used to analyze apoptosis in differentiated cells derived from H1 cells.
All differentiated cells with retention of 0%, 25%, 50% and 75% mTeSR1 expressed SOX17, FOXA2, AFP, HNF4α, and ALB, while higher expression levels were observed in differentiated cells in the 0% and 25% groups. The flow cytometry results showed that the proportion of ALB-positive differentiated cells derived from H1 cells was higher in the 25% mTeSR1 group than in other groups. However, no significant difference in ALB secretion, urea production, ICG uptake and release and glycogen storage ability was detected between the 25% and 0% groups. The iPS cells could differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells with 25% mTeSR1 retention. The apoptosis ratio of differentiated cells was lower in the 25% mTeSR1 group than in the 0% mTeSR1 group.
Retaining 25% mTeSR1 medium during hepatic differentiation has been proposed to increase the percentage of ALB-positive cells and cell survival by decreasing cell apoptosis.
The present study aimed to identify the therapeutic role of the forkhead box M1 (FOXM1)‑associated pathway in triple‑negative breast cancer (TNBC). Using a Cancer Landscapes‑based analysis, a gene regulatory network model was constructed. The present results demonstrated that FOXM1 occupies a key position in gene networks and is a critical regulatory gene in breast cancer. Using breast carcinoma gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, it was identified that FOXM1 expression was increased in the basal‑like breast cancer subtype compared with other breast cancer subtypes. RNA‑sequencing analysis of MDA‑MB‑231 cells treated with 4 and 10 µl/ml Thiostrepton identified 662 and 5,888 significantly differentially expressed genes, respectively. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses demonstrated that FOXM1 was highly associated with multiple biological processes and was markedly associated with metabolic pathways in TNBC. The use of Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins provided a critical assessment and integration of protein‑protein interactions, and demonstrated the multiple important functions of FOXM1 in TNBC. Real‑time cell analysis, reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence staining were used to assess the anti‑tumor activity of Thiostrepton in TNBC cells in vitro. The present results identified that suppression of FOXM1 using Thiostrepton inhibited MDA‑MB‑231 cell proliferation and the expression of cell cycle‑associated genes, including cyclin A2, cyclin B2, checkpoint kinase 1, centrosomal protein 55 and polo like kinase 1. Immunofluorescence staining analysis demonstrated that vimentin, filamentous actin and zinc finger E‑box‑binding homeobox 1 were all decreased following treatment with Thiostrepton. Furthermore, a BALB/C nude mouse subcutaneous xenograft model was used to verify the function of FOXM1 in vivo. The present results demonstrated that FOXM1 inhibition significantly suppressed MDA‑MB‑231 cell tumorigenesis in vivo. Overall, the present results suggested that FOXM1 is a key gene that serves important roles in multiple biological processes in TNBC and that it may serve as a novel therapeutic target in TNBC.
Because of exposure to environmental pollutants, infectious agents, and genetic predisposition, companion animals develop respiratory illnesses similar to those in humans. Older dogs of smaller breeds develop canine infectious respiratory disease, chronic bronchitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with chronic lung infection, airway goblet cell hyperplasia and metaplasia, and mucus hypersecretion. Excessive mucus clogs airways, reduces gas exchanges, disables the mucociliary clearance, and reduces drug penetration. The Forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2) is a key transcriptional regulator that maintains airway mucus homeostasis. Prior studies have shown that FOXA2 expression is frequently depleted in diseased human airways. Unfortunately, FOXA2 depletion has not been examined in dogs. Our current study indicated that both single bacterial infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bordetella bronchiseptica and polymicrobial infection by viral/bacterial pathogens depleted FOXA2 in canine airways, resulting in goblet cell hyperplasia and metaplasia and excessive mucus production. Furthermore, P. aeruginosa virulence factor pyocyanin activated the antagonistic STAT6 and epidermal growth factor receptor signalling pathways to inhibit FOXA2. Unravelling the mechanism of FOXA2 inactivation will hasten the development of non-antibiotic therapeutics to improve mucociliary clearance of pathogens in canine airway.
Forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2) is a core transcription factor that controls cell differentiation and may have an important role in bone metabolism. However, the role of FOXA2 during osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) remains largely unknown. In this study, decreased expression of FOXA2 was observed during osteogenic differentiation of rat BMSCs (rBMSCs). FOXA2 knockdown significantly increased osteoblast-specific gene expression, the number of mineral deposits and alkaline phosphatase activity, whereas FOXA2 overexpression inhibited osteogenesis-specific activities. Moreover, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) signalling was upregulated following knockdown of FOXA2. The enhanced osteogenesis due to FOXA2 knockdown was partially rescued by an ERK inhibitor. Using a rat tibial defect model, a rBMSC sheet containing knocked down FOXA2 significantly improved bone healing. Collectively, these findings indicated that FOXA2 had an essential role in osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, partly by activation of the ERK signalling pathway.
Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) is produced by L cells in the intestine, and agonists of the GLP1 receptor are effective in the treatment of diabetes. Levels of GLP1 increase with numbers of L cells. Therefore, agents that increase numbers of L cell might be developed for treatment of diabetes. Ras homologue family member A (RhoA) signaling through Rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinases 1 and 2 (ROCK1 and ROCK2) controls cell differentiation, but it is not clear whether this pathway regulates enteroendocrine differentiation in the intestinal epithelium. We investigated the effects of Y-27632, an inhibitor of ROCK1 and ROCK2, on L-cell differentiation.
We collected intestinal tissues from GLU-Venus, GPR41-RFP, and Neurog3-RFP mice, in which the endocrine lineage is fluorescently labeled, for in vitro culture and histologic analysis. Small intestine organoids derived from these mice were cultured with Y-27632 and we measured percentages of L cells, expression of intestinal cell-specific markers, and secretion of GLP1 in medium. Mice were fed a normal chow or a high-fat diet and given Y-27632 or saline (control) and blood samples were collected for measurement of GLP1, insulin, and glucose.
Incubation of intestinal organoids with Y-27632 increased numbers of L cells and secretion of GLP1. These increases were associated with upregulated expression of genes encoding intestinal hormones, neurogenin 3, neurogenic differentiation factor 1, forkhead box A1 and A2, and additional markers of secretory cells. Mice fed the normal chow diet and given Y-27632 had increased numbers of L cells in intestinal tissues, increased plasma levels of GLP1 and insulin, and lower blood levels of glucose compared with mice fed the normal chow diet and given saline. In mice with insulin resistance induced by the high-fat diet, administration of Y-27632 increased secretion of GLP1 and glucose tolerance compared with administration of saline.
In mouse intestinal organoids, an inhibitor of RhoA signaling increased the differentiation of the secretory lineage and the development of enteroendocrine cells. Inhibitors of RhoA signaling or other strategies to increase numbers of L cells might be developed for treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes or for increasing glucose tolerance.
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are closely associated with the regulation of various biological processes and are involved in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases. However, to the best of our knowledge, the role of lncRNAs in ventilator‑induced lung injury (VILI) has yet to be evaluated. In the present study, high‑throughput sequencing was applied to investigate differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs (fold change &gt;2; false discovery rate &lt;0.05). Bioinformatics analysis was employed to predict the functions of differentially expressed lncRNAs. A total of 104 lncRNAs (74 upregulated and 30 downregulated) and 809 mRNAs (521 upregulated and 288 downregulated) were differentially expressed in lung tissues from the VILI group. Gene ontology analysis demonstrated that the differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs were mainly associated with biological functions, including apoptosis, angiogenesis, neutrophil chemotaxis and skeletal muscle cell differentiation. The top four enriched pathways were the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, P53 signaling pathway, neuroactive ligand‑receptor interaction and the forkhead box O signaling pathway. Several lncRNAs were predicted to serve a vital role in VILI. Subsequently, three lncRNAs [mitogen‑activated protein kinase kinase 3, opposite strand (Map2k3os), dynamin 3, opposite strand and abhydrolase domain containing 11, opposite strand] and three mRNAs (growth arrest and DNA damage‑inducible α, claudin 4 and thromboxane A2 receptor) were measured by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction, in order to confirm the veracity of RNA‑sequencing analysis. In addition, Map2k3os small interfering RNA transfection inhibited the expression of stretch‑induced cytokines [TNF‑α, interleukin (IL)‑1β and IL‑6] in MLE12 cells. In conclusion, the results of the present study provided a profile of differentially expressed lncRNAs in VILI. Several important lncRNAs may be involved in the pathological process of VILI, which may be useful to guide further investigation into the pathogenesis for this disease.
The mechanisms by which the liver fails in end-stage liver disease remain elusive. Disruption of the transcription factor network in hepatocytes has been suggested to mediate terminal liver failure in animals. However, this hypothesis remains unexplored in human subjects. To study the relevance of transcription factor expression in terminal stages of chronic liver failure in humans, we analyzed the expression of liver-enriched transcription factors (LETFs) hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)4α, HNF1α, forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (CEBP)α, and CEBPβ. We then selected downstream genes responsible for some hepatic functions (ornithine transcarbamylase [OTC], cytochrome P450 3A4 [CYP3A4], coagulation factor VII [F7], cadherin 1 [CDH1], phospho-ezrin (Thr567)/radixin (Thr564)/moesin (Thr558) [p-ERM], phospho-myosin light chain [p-MLC], low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 [LRP1]) in liver tissue from patients at different stages of decompensated liver function based upon Child-Pugh classification, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, and degree of inflammatory activity/fibrosis. We first examined differential expression of LETF and determined whether a relationship exists between transcript and protein expression, and liver function. We found HNF4α expression was down-regulated and correlated well with the extent of liver dysfunction (P = 0.001), stage of fibrosis (P = 0.0005), and serum levels of total bilirubin (P = 0.009; r = 0.35), albumin (P &lt; 0.001; r = 0.52), and prothrombin time activity (P = 0.002; r = 0.41). HNF4α expression also correlated with CYP3A4, OTC, and F7 as well as CDH1 RNA levels. The Rho/Rho-associated protein kinase pathways, which have been implicated in the regulation of HNF4α, were also differentially expressed, in concert with LRP1, a reported upstream regulator of RhoA function. Conclusion: HNF4α and other members of the LETFs appear to be important regulators of hepatocyte function in patients with chronic hepatic failure. (Hepatology Communications 2018;2:582-594).
miRNAs play important roles in gene regulation, and their dysregulation is associated with many diseases, including epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). In this study, we determined the expression and function of miR-590-3p in EOC. miR-590-3p levels were higher in high-grade carcinoma when compared with low-grade or tumors with low malignant potential. Interestingly, plasma levels of miR-590-3p were significantly higher in patients with EOC than in subjects with benign gynecologic disorders. Transient transfection of miR-590-3p mimics or stable transfection of mir-590 increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In vivo studies revealed that mir-590 accelerated tumor growth and metastasis. Using a cDNA microarray, we identified forkhead box A2 (FOXA2) and versican (VCAN) as top downregulated and upregulated genes by mir-590, respectively. miR-590-3p targeted FOXA2 3' UTR to suppress its expression. In addition, knockdown or knockout of FOXA2 enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Overexpression of FOXA2 decreased, whereas knockout of FOXA2 increased VCAN mRNA and protein levels, which was due to direct binding and regulation of the VCAN gene by FOXA2. Interrogation of the TCGA ovarian cancer database revealed a negative relationship between FOXA2 and VCAN mRNA levels in EOC tumors, and high FOXA2/low VCAN mRNA levels in tumors positively correlated with patient survival. Finally, overexpression of FOXA2 or silencing of VCAN reversed the effects of mir-590. These findings demonstrate that miR-590-3p promotes EOC development via a novel FOXA2-VCAN pathway.Significance: Low FOXA2/high VCAN levels mediate the tumor-promoting effects of miR-590-3p and negatively correlate with ovarian cancer survival.

Previous studies have shown that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure may have a protective effect on asthma by reducing airway hyper-responsiveness, airway inflammation and serum IgE levels. However, there are few studies investigating the effect of LPS on mucous secretion in asthma. In this study, we evaluate the relationship between LPS pre-treatment in infant mice and airway mucus hypersecretion in an OVA (ovalbumin)-induced asthma model, and further explore the mechanisms behind this effect.
Mice were pre-treated with LPS by intranasal instillation (i.n.) from the 3rd day of life for 10 consecutive days before the OVA-induced asthma model was established. In order to detect mucus secretion, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining was carried out, and the expression of Muc5ac was detected. The IL-13 levels in Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue were also detected. In vitro, the expression of Muc5ac mRNA and protein was quantified in IL-13-stimulated 16HBE cells with or without LPS pre-treatment. In addition, proteins in the JAK2/STAT6 pathway, transcription factors (forkhead box transcription factor A2 (FOXA2), activation protein-1(AP-1), NF-κB), and the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were also measured in vivo and in vitro.
LPS pre-treatment reduced mucus secretion, as demonstrated by decreased PAS staining and muc5ac expression. Further exploration of the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon revealed that LPS pre-treatment decreased the production of IL-13, IL-13 induced ROS synthesis was reduced, and the JAK2/STAT6 pathway was inhibited. Decreased stat6 increased transcription factor FOXA2, and the relatively increased FOXA2 further decreased the level of Muc5ac and mucous hypersecretion in OVA-induced asthma.
LPS pre-treatment ameliorated mucus hypersecretion in an OVA-induced asthma model by inhibition of IL-13 production and by further inhibiting the JAK2/STAT6 pathway and ROS activity, and up-regulating expression of FOXA2.
When differentiated in the presence of activin A in serum-free conditions, mouse embryonic stem cells efficiently generate an endoderm progenitor population defined by the coexpression of either Brachyury, Foxa2 and c-Kit, or c-Kit and Cxcr4. Specification of these progenitors with bone morphogenetic protein-4 in combination with basic fibroblast growth factor and activin A results in the development of hepatic populations highly enriched (45-70%) for cells that express the alpha-fetoprotein and albumin proteins. These cells also express transcripts of Afp, Alb1, Tat, Cps1, Cyp7a1 and Cyp3a11; they secrete albumin, store glycogen, show ultrastructural characteristics of mature hepatocytes, and are able to integrate into and proliferate in injured livers in vivo and mature into hepatocytes expressing dipeptidyl peptidase IV or fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase. Together, these findings establish a developmental pathway in embryonic stem cell differentiation cultures that leads to efficient generation of cells with an immature hepatocytic phenotype.
Lithocholic acid (LCA), the most toxic bile acid, induces cholestatic liver injury in rodents. We previously showed that LCA activates the oxidative stress-responsive nuclear factor (erythroid-2 like), factor 2 (Nrf2) in cultured liver cells, triggering adaptive responses that reduce cell injury. In this study, we determined whether Nrf2 protects the liver against LCA-induced toxicity in vivo.
Nrf2 disrupted (Nrf2(-/-) ) and wild-type mice were treated with LCA (125 mg·kg(-1) body weight) to induce liver injury. Levels of mRNA, protein and function of important Nrf2 target genes coupled with liver histology and injury biomarkers of mice were examined.
In 4 day LCA treatments, we observed a significantly higher hepatic induction of Nrf2 target, cytoprotective genes including thioredoxin reductase 1, glutamate cysteine ligase subunits, glutathione S-transferases, haeme oxygenase-1 and multidrug resistance-associated proteins 3 and 4 in the wild type as compared with the Nrf2(-/-) mice. Moreover, basal and LCA-induced hepatic glutathione and activities of glutathione S-transferases and thioredoxin reductases were higher in wild-type than in Nrf2(-/-) mice. This reduced production of cytoprotective genes against LCA toxicity rendered Nrf2(-/-) mice more susceptible to severe liver damage with the presence of multifocal liver necrosis, inflamed bile ducts and elevation of lipid peroxidation and liver injury biomarkers, such as alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase.
Nrf2 plays a crucial cytoprotective role against LCA-induced liver injury by orchestrating adaptive responses. The pharmacological potential of targeting liver Nrf2 in the management of cholestatic liver diseases is proposed.
We previously showed that hepatic expression of glutathione (GSH) synthetic enzymes and GSH levels fell 2 weeks after bile duct ligation (BDL) in mice. This correlated with a switch in nuclear anti-oxidant response element (ARE) binding activity from nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) to c-avian musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma (c-Maf)/V-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog G (MafG). Our current aims were to examine whether the switch in ARE binding activity from Nrf2 to Mafs is responsible for decreased expression of GSH synthetic enzymes and the outcome of blocking this switch. Huh7 cells treated with lithocholic acid (LCA) exhibited a similar pattern of change in GSH synthetic enzyme expression as BDL mice. Nuclear protein levels of Nrf2 fell at 20 hours after LCA treatment, whereas c-Maf and MafG remained persistently induced. These changes translated to ARE nuclear binding activity. Knockdown of c-Maf or MafG individually blunted the LCA-induced decrease in Nrf2 ARE binding and increased ARE-dependent promoter activity, whereas combined knockdown was more effective. Knockdown of c-Maf or MafG individually increased the expression of GSH synthetic enzymes and raised GSH levels, and combined knockdown exerted an additive effect. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) or S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) prevented the LCA-induced decrease in expression of GSH synthetic enzymes and promoter activity and prevented the increase in MafG and c-Maf levels. In vivo knockdown of the Maf genes protected against the decrease in GSH enzyme expression, GSH level, and liver injury after BDL.
Toxic bile acid induces a switch from Nrf2 to c-Maf/MafG ARE nuclear binding, which leads to decreased expression of GSH synthetic enzymes and GSH levels and contributes to liver injury during BDL. UDCA and SAMe treatment targets this switch.
Flavin-containing monooxygenase-3 (FMO3) catalyzes metabolic reactions similar to cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, however, most metabolites of FMO3 are considered non-toxic. Recent findings in our laboratory demonstrated Fmo3 gene induction following toxic acetaminophen (APAP) treatment in mice. The goal of this study was to evaluate Fmo3 gene expression in other diverse mouse models of hepatic oxidative stress and injury. Fmo3 gene regulation by Nrf2 was also investigated using Nrf2 knockout (Nrf2 KO) mice. In our studies, male C57BL/6J mice were treated with toxic doses of hepatotoxicants or underwent bile duct ligation (BDL, 10 days). Hepatotoxicants included APAP (400 mg/kg, 24-72 h), alpha-naphthyl isothiocyanate (ANIT; 50 mg/kg, 2-48 h), carbon tetrachloride (CCl4; 10 or 30 μL/kg, 24 and 48 h) and allyl alcohol (AlOH; 30 or 60 mg/kg, 6 and 24 h). Because oxidative stress activates nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), additional studies investigated Fmo3 gene regulation by Nrf2 using Nrf2 knockout (Nrf2 KO) mice. At appropriate time-points, blood and liver samples were collected for assessment of plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity, plasma and hepatic bile acid levels, as well as liver Fmo3 mRNA and protein expression. Fmo3 mRNA expression increased significantly by 43-fold at 12 h after ANIT treatment, and this increase translates to a 4-fold change in protein levels. BDL also increased Fmo3 mRNA expression by 1899-fold, but with no change in protein levels. Treatment of mice with CCl4 decreased liver Fmo3 gene expression, while no change in expression was detected with AlOH treatment. Nrf2 KO mice are more susceptible to APAP (400mg/kg, 72 h) treatment compared to their wild-type (WT) counterparts, which is evidenced by greater plasma ALT activity. The Fmo3 mRNA and protein expression increased in Nrf2 KO mice after APAP treatment. Collectively, not all hepatotoxicants that produce oxidative stress alter Fmo3 gene expression. Along with APAP, toxic ANIT treatment in mice markedly increased Fmo3 gene expression. While BDL increased the Fmo3 mRNA expression, the protein level did not change. The discrepancy with Fmo3 induction in cholestatic models, ANIT and BDL, is not entirely clear. Results from Nrf2 KO mice with APAP suggest that the transcriptional regulation of Fmo3 during liver injury may not involve Nrf2.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) rarely occurs in childhood. We describe a patient with new onset of pruritus at 8 months of age who at 17 months of age was found to have a 2.5 cm HCC. To delineate the possible genetic basis of this tumour, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) of the germline DNA and identified two novel predictably deleterious missense mutations in ABCB11, encoding bile salt export pump (BSEP), confirmed in the parental DNA as bi-allelic and inherited. Although inherited ABCB11 mutations have previously been linked to HCC in a small number of cases, the molecular mechanisms of hepatocellular carcinogenesis in ABCB11 disease are unknown. WES of the HCC tissue uncovered somatic driver mutations in the beta-catenin (CTNNB1) and nuclear-factor-erythroid-2-related-factor-2 (NFE2L2) genes. Moreover, clonality analysis predicted that the CTNNB1 mutation was clonal and occurred earlier during carcinogenesis, whereas the NFE2L2 mutation was acquired later. Interestingly, background liver parenchyma showed no inflammation or fibrosis and BSEP expression was preserved. This is the first study to identify somatic CTNNB1 and NFE2L2 mutations in early childhood arisen in the setting of inherited bi-allelic ABCB11 mutations. Rapid WES analysis expedited this child's diagnosis and treatment, and likely improved her prognosis.
AKR1C2, also referred to as the human bile acid binder and 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type III, is a multifunctional oxidoreductase able to stereoselectively reduce steroids as well as oxidize or reduce polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Previously, this same protein was also identified by its robust induction by phase II inducers in HT29 cells. In HepG2 cells, both AKR1C2 and AKR1C1 (97% sequence homology) were induced by phase II inducers but not the highly related AKR1C3 and AKR1C4 family members (84% sequence homology). We now report the initial characterization of the proximal promoter of AKR1C2 in HepG2 cell line and the identification of a potent enhancer-like element responsive to phase II inducers located approximately 5.5 kilobases upstream from the transcription start site. DNA sequence analysis of this enhancer element revealed that it contained a consensus antioxidant response element (ARE), which was confirmed by mutation analysis. Treatment with phase II inducers leads to increased accumulation of nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor (NRF) 2 in the nucleus, which was associated with increased binding to this ARE as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Transient transfection with Nrf2 increased the transcriptional activity of the ARE of AKR1C2 comparable with that observed with phase II inducers. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis also confirmed increased NRF2 binding to the ARE after induction by a phase II inducer. The AKR1C1 promoter also harbored this same ARE element in a highly homologous region, which was also bound by NRF2 in a ChiP analysis. No induction of the ARE of AKR1C2 was detected in Nrf2-/- fibroblasts. The regulation of AKR1C2 by this distal ARE suggests that AKR1C2 detoxifies products of reactive oxidant injury, which has important implications for both hormone and xenobiotic metabolism.
The Nrf2 (nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2) transcription factor regulates gene expression of the GCLC (glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit), which is a key enzyme in glutathione synthesis, and GSTs (glutathione S-transferases) via the ARE (antioxidant-response element). The Mrp2 (multidrug-resistance protein 2) pump mediates the excretion of GSH and GSSG excretion as well as endo- and xeno-biotics that are conjugated with GSH, glucuronate or sulphate. Considering that Mrp2 acts synergistically with these enzymes, we hypothesized that the regulation of Mrp2 gene expression is also dependent on Nrf2. Using BHA (butylated hydroxyanisole), which is a classical activator of the ARE-Nrf2 pathway, we observed an increase in the transcriptional activity of Mrp2, GCLC and Gsta1/Gsta2 genes in the mouse liver. A similar pattern of co-induction of Mrp2 and GCLC genes was also observed in mouse (Hepa 1-6) and human (HepG2) hepatoma cells treated with BHA, beta-NF (beta-naphthoflavone), 2,4,5-T (trichlorophenoxyacetic acid) or 2AAF (2-acetylaminofluorene), suggesting that these genes share common mechanism(s) of transcriptional activation in response to exposure to xenobiotics. To define the mechanism of Mrp2 gene induction, the 5'-flanking region of the mouse Mrp2 gene (2.0 kb) was isolated, and two ARE-like sequences were found: ARE-2 (-1391 to -1381) and ARE-1 (-95 to -85). Deletion analyses demonstrated that the proximal region (-185 to +99) contains the elements for the basal expression and xenobiotic-mediated induction of the Mrp2 gene. Gel-shift and supershift assays indicated that Nrf2-protein complexes bind ARE sequences of the Mrp2 promoter, preferentially to the ARE-1 sequence. Overexpression of Nrf2 increased ARE-1-mediated CAT (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) gene activity, while overexpression of mutant Nrf2 protein repressed the activity. Thus Nrf2 appears to regulate Mrp2 gene expression via an ARE element located at the proximal region of its promoter in response to exposure to xenobiotics.
The major function of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is to maintain bile acid and lipid homeostasis. Fxr-null mice, in which the levels of hepatic bile acid and lipid have been elevated, develop spontaneous liver tumors. We evaluated differences in hepatic bile acid and triglyceride concentrations, and in generation of oxidative stress between wild-type mice and Fxr-null mice. The hepatic levels of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8OHdG), thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) and hydroperoxides, oxidative stress-related genes, and nuclear factor (erythroid-2 like) factor 2 (Nrf2) protein in Fxr-null mice were significantly higher than those in wild-type mice. An increase in the hepatic bile acid concentration in Fxr-null mice fed a cholic acid (CA) diet resulted in an increase in the hepatic levels of hydroperoxides, TBARS and 8OHdG, whereas a decrease in the hepatic concentration in mice fed a diet containing ME3738 (22beta-methoxyolean-12-ene-3beta,24(4beta)-diol) resulted in a decrease in these oxidative stress marker levels. A good correlation was observed between the hepatic bile acid concentrations and the hepatic oxidative stress marker levels, although there was no significant correlation between the hepatic triglyceride concentrations and oxidative stress. The results show that oxidative stress is spontaneously enhanced in Fxr-null mice, which may be attributable to a continuously high level of hepatic bile acids.
Oxidative stress, causing necrotic and apoptotic cell death, is associated with bile acid toxicity. Using liver (HepG2, Hepa1c1c7, and primary human hepatocytes) and intestinal (C2bbe1, a Caco-2 subclone) cells, we demonstrated that toxic bile acids, such as lithocholic acid (LCA) and chenodeoxycholic acid, induced the nuclear factor (erythroid-2 like) factor 2 (Nrf2) target genes, especially the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis [glutamate cysteine ligase modulatory subunit (GCLM) and glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC)] and thioredoxin reductase 1. Nrf2 activation and induction of Nrf2 target genes were also evident in vivo in the liver of CD-1 mice treated 7 to 8 h or 4 days with LCA. Silencing of Nrf2 via small-interfering RNA suppressed basal and bile acid-induced mRNA levels of the above-mentioned genes. Consistent with this, overexpression of Nrf2 enhanced, but dominant-negative Nrf2 attenuated, Nrf2 target gene induction by bile acids. The activation of Nrf2-antioxidant responsive element (ARE) transcription machinery by bile acids was confirmed by increased nuclear accumulation of Nrf2, enhanced ARE-reporter activity, and increased Nrf2 binding to ARE. It is noteworthy that Nrf2 silencing increased cell susceptibility to LCA toxicity, as evidenced by reduced cell viability and increased necrosis and apoptosis. Concomitant with GCLC/GCLM induction, cellular GSH was significantly increased in bile acid-treated cells. Cotreatment with N-acetyl-l-cysteine, a GSH precursor, ameliorated LCA toxicity, whereas cotreatment with buthionine sulfoximine, a GSH synthesis blocker, exacerbated it. In summary, this study provides molecular evidence linking bile acid toxicity to oxidative stress. Nrf2 is centrally involved in counteracting such oxidative stress by enhancing adaptive antioxidative response, particularly GSH biosynthesis, and hence cell survival.
Bile acid transporters and the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf-2)-mediated adaptive response play important roles in the development of drug-induced liver injury (DILI). However, little is known about the contribution of the adaptive response to rifampicin (RFP)-induced cell injury. In this study, we found RFP decreased the survival rate of HepG2 cells and increased the levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (AKP), γ-glutamyl-transferase (γ-GT), total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), indirect bilirubin (IBIL), total bile acid (TBA) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the cell culture supernatants in both a concentration- and a time-dependent manner. RFP increased the expression levels of bile acid transporter proteins and mRNAs, such as bile salt export pump (BSEP), multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1), multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2), Na+/taurocholate cotransporter (NTCP), organic anion transporting protein 2 (OATP2), organic solute transporter β (OSTβ) and Nrf2. Following the transient knockdown of Nrf2 and treatment with RFP, the expression levels of the BSEP, MDR1, MRP2, NTCP, OATP2 and OSTβ proteins and mRNAs were decreased to different degrees. Moreover, the cell survival was decreased, whereas the LDH level in the cell culture supernatant was increased. Overexpression of the Nrf2 gene produced the opposite effects. Treatment with tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) increased the expression levels of the bile acid transporters and Nrf2, decreased the expression levels of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), and C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP), and inhibited RFP-induced oxidative stress. Moreover, TUDCA reduced cell apoptosis, increased cell survival and decreased the levels of LDH, ALT, AST, AKP, γ-GT, TBIL, DBIL, IBIL, TBA and ATP in the cell culture supernatant. Therefore, TUDCA alleviates RFP-induced injury in HepG2 cells by enhancing bile acid transporters expression and the Nrf2-mediated adaptive response.
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder, mainly characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Although the cause of PD remains elusive, mitochondrial dysfunction and severe oxidative stress are strongly implicated in the cell death that characterizes the disease. Under oxidative stress, the master regulator of cellular redox status, nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2), is responsible for activating the transcription of several cytoprotective enzymes, namely glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Nrf2 is a promising target to limit reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated damage in PD. Here, we show that tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) prevents both 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)- and α-synuclein-induced oxidative stress, through Nrf2 activation, in SH-SY5Y cells. Additionally, we used C57BL/6 male mice treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to elucidate the effect of TUDCA in this in vivo model of PD. In vivo, TUDCA treatment increases the expression of Nrf2, Nrf2 stabilizer DJ-1, and Nrf2 downstream target antioxidant enzymes HO-1 and GPx. Moreover, we found that TUDCA enhances GPx activity in the brain. Altogether, our results suggest that TUDCA is a promising agent to limit ROS-mediated damage, in different models of PD acting, at least in part, through modulation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Therefore, TUDCA should be considered a promising therapeutic agent to be implemented in PD.
Licorice (Glycyrrhizae radix), the root of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. (Leguminosae), is mainly used to moderate the characteristics of toxic herbs in Traditional Chinese Medicine, which could be partly interpreted as detoxification. However, the underlying mechanism is still not fully elucidated. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) plays a key role in the protection against toxic xenobiotics. In our previous research, we have identified that extracts from Glycyrrhiza uralensis induced the expression of Nrf2 nuclear protein and its downstream genes. This research aims to screen the most potent Nrf2 inducer isolated from Glycyrrhiza uralensis and examine its effect on Nrf2 signaling pathway and detoxification system.
Four compounds derived from Glycyrrhiza uralensis (glycyrrhetinic acid, liquiritigenin, isoliquiritigenin and liquiritin) were screened by ARE-luciferase reporter. The most potent ARE-luciferase inducer was chosen to further examine its effect on Nrf2 and detoxification genes in HepG2 cells. The role of Nrf2-dependent mechanism was tested by using Nrf2 knockout mice (Nrf2 KO) and Nrf2 wild-type mice (Nrf2 WT).
ARE-luciferase reporter assay showed these four compounds were all potent Nrf2 inducers, and isoliquiritigenin was the most potent inducer. Isoliquiritigenin significantly up-regulated the expression of Nrf2 and its downstream detoxification genes UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1), glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL), multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) and bile salt export pump (BSEP) in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, isoliquiritigenin showed Nrf2-dependent transactivation of UGT1A1, GCLC and MRP2.
Isoliquiritigenin, isolated from Glycyrrhiza uralensis, stimulates detoxification system via Nrf2 activation, which could be a potential protective mechanism of licorice.
We showed that chronic cholestatic liver injury induced the expression of c-Myc but suppressed that of glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL, composed of catalytic and modifier subunits GCLC and GCLM, respectively). This was associated with reduced nuclear antioxidant response element (ARE) binding by nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2). Here, we examined whether c-Myc is involved in this process.
Similar to bile duct ligation (BDL), lithocholic acid (LCA) treatment in vivo induced c-Myc but suppressed GCL subunits expression at day 14. Nrf2 expression and Nrf2 ARE binding fell markedly. However, Nrf2 heterodimerization with MafG was enhanced by LCA, which prompted us to examine whether LCA treatment in vivo altered proteins that bind to ARE using biotinylated ARE in pull-down assay followed by proteomics. LCA treatment enhanced c-Myc but lowered prohibitin 1 (PHB1) binding to ARE. This was a result of c-Myc-mediated induction of microRNA 27a/b (miR27a/b), which target both PHB1 and Nrf2 to reduce their expression. Knockdown of c-Myc or miR27a/b attenuated LCA-mediated suppression of Nrf2, PHB1, and GCL subunit expression, whereas overexpression of PHB1 protected against the fall in Nrf2 and GCL subunits. Both c-Myc and PHB1 directly interact with Nrf2 but c-Myc lowers Nrf2 binding to ARE while PHB1 enhances it.
This is the first work that shows how activation of this circuit in cholestatic liver injury inhibits GCL expression.
LCA feeding and BDL activate c-Myc-miR27a/b-PHB1 circuit, with the consequence of inhibiting Nrf2 expression and ARE binding, resulting in decreased reduced glutathione synthesis and antioxidant capacity.
To investigate if andrographolide impairs cholestatic liver injury. All rats were randomly divided into six groups-(1) control (n = 6), (2) control + 200 mg/kg andrographolide (n = 6), (3) alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT)-control (n = 6), (4) ANIT + 50 mg/kg andrographolide (n = 6), (5) ANIT + 100 mg/kg andrographolide (n = 6), and (6) ANIT + 200 mg/kg andrographolide (n = 6). We gavaged 50 mg/kg ANIT to mimic cholestatic liver injury in rats. Seven days after treatment, all the rats were killed. Serum biochemistry and hepatic histopathological assays were performed to evaluate liver injury. We observed that 200 mg/kg andrographolide significantly decreased the level of alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, γ-glutamyltranspeptidase, total bilirubin, and total bile acid in the blood. It also markedly decreased hepatic interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor α. Furthermore, 200 mg/kg andrographolide significantly decreased malondialdehyde but increased superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase. Moreover, 200 mg/kg andrographolide effectively increased the accumulation of sirtuin 1 and nuclear erythroid 2-related factor-2. It also attenuated the level of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B and cyclooxygenase-2. These data suggest that andrographolide may impair cholestatic liver injury via anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress.
Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors have beneficial effects in multiple liver diseases possibly through the reduction of oxidative stress and inflammatory response. However, these effects have not yet been examined in cholestatic liver dysfunction. Hence, this study aimed to explore the ability of vardenafil, a known phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, to repress lithocholic acid (LCA)-induced cholestatic liver injury and investigate the possible molecular pathways.
Male Swiss albino mice were treated with LCA (0.125 mg/g) twice daily for 7 days to induce cholestatic liver damage. Vardenafil was administered 3 days before and throughout the administration of LCA. Serum markers of hepatotoxicity and hepatic nitro-oxidative stress along with antioxidant parameters were measured, and the histopathology of liver tissues was assessed. The expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its target genes was examined using PCR. The activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) and the levels of inflammatory cytokines were determined. NLRP3 inflammasome and its components were studied by PCR and western blot.
LCA induced marked cholestatic liver damage as demonstrated by increased serum transaminases, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin, and bile acids. Examination of liver specimens confirmed the biochemical results. Nitro-oxidative stress parameters were significantly elevated along with reduced antioxidant capacity in hepatic tissue following LCA administration. LCA suppressed Nrf2 and its target genes and decreased the mRNA expression and binding capacity of Nrf2 as well as the mRNA expression of GCLm, GCLc, Nqo1, and HO-1. Additionally, LCA enhanced the activation of NF-κB, which was accompanied by elevations of inflammatory cytokines. Importantly, LCA induced the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. LCA increased the expression of NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, and IL-1β genes and proteins in hepatic tissue. The activities of IL-1β and caspase-1 were increased in the LCA group. Interestingly, vardenafil ameliorated LCA-induced hepatic injury and alleviated all biochemical, histopathological, and inflammatory parameters.
These data elucidated the effects of Nrf2 inhibition and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in LCA-induced liver injury. The hepatoprotective activity of vardenafil in LCA-induced cholestatic damage may result from the drug's ability to activate Nrf2 signaling and prevent the activation of NLRP3, which could suppress the inflammatory responses in hepatic tissue. Thus, vardenafil can be considered a novel anti-inflammatory remedy for cholestatic liver damage.
Pinelliae Rhizoma Praeparatum (PRP) as traditional Chinese medicine had been used for hepatic diseases in combinative forms. However, the effect of PRP was not clear when used alone. So to explore the hepatoprotective/hepatotoxin of PRP is necessary. The activities of PRP were investigated in acetaminophen-induced hepatic injury mice. Liver function markers, hepatic oxidative stress markers were evaluated. Bile acids metabolic transports and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) were detected. As a drug for the treatment of liver diseases, PRP slightly restored the parameters towards normal in model mice only in low dosage, and also had no antioxidant activity and regulate Nrf2. Cholestasis was significantly elevated in model mice when pretreatment with routine or high dosage of PRP, but had no effect on normal mice. Bile salt export pump (Bsep) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp2) in model mice were markedly increased when pretreatment with low dose PRP, but significantly decreased when pretreatment in routine or high dosage. Mrp3 was significantly induced in model mice after pretreatment of PRP. But the adjustment effect to bile acids transporters by PRP was not significant in normal mice. These results reveal that PRP has the different effects on bile acids transporter in hepatic injury mice, and therefore, the dosage of PRP need to be paid attention to when it is used in clinical hepatic injury.
Fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs) are lipid mediators with promising antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory properties that are formed in white adipose tissue (WAT) via de novo lipogenesis, but their biosynthetic enzymes are unknown. Using a combination of lipidomics in WAT, quantitative trait locus mapping, and correlation analyses in rat BXH/HXB recombinant inbred strains, as well as response to oxidative stress in murine models, we elucidated the potential pathway of biosynthesis of several FAHFAs. Comprehensive analysis of WAT samples identified ∼160 regioisomers, documenting the complexity of this lipid class. The linkage analysis highlighted several members of the nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2 (Nrf2)-mediated antioxidant defense system (Prdx6, Mgst1, Mgst3), lipid-handling proteins (Cd36, Scd6, Acnat1, Acnat2, Baat), and the family of flavin containing monooxygenases (Fmo) as the positional candidate genes. Transgenic expression of Nrf2 and deletion of Prdx6 genes resulted in reduction of palmitic acid ester of 9-hydroxystearic acid (9-PAHSA) and 11-PAHSA levels, while oxidative stress induced by an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis increased PAHSA levels nonspecifically. Our results indicate that the synthesis of FAHFAs via carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein-driven de novo lipogenesis depends on the adaptive antioxidant system and suggest that FAHFAs may link activity of this system with insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues.
Enhancer II (ENII) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the essential cis-elements for the transcriptional regulation of HBV gene expression. Its function is highly liver-specific, suggesting that liver-enriched transcriptional factors play critical roles in regulating the activity of ENII. In this report, a novel hepatocyte transcription factor, which binds specifically to the B1 region (AACGACCGACCTTGAG) within the major functional unit (B unit) of ENII, has been cloned from a human liver cDNA library by yeast one-hybrid screening, and demonstrated to trans-activate ENII via the B1 region. We named this factor hB1F, for human B1-binding factor. Amino acid analysis revealed this factor structurally belongs to nuclear receptor superfamily. Based on the sequence similarities, hB1F is characterized to be a novel human homolog of the orphan receptor fushi tarazu factor I (FTZ-F1). Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, a splicing isoform of hB1F (hB1F-2) was identified, which has an extra 46 amino acid residues in the A/B region. Examination of the tissue distribution has revealed an abundant 5.2-kilobase transcript of hB1F is present specifically in human pancreas and liver. Interestingly, an additional transcript of 3.8 kilobases was found to be present in hepatoma cells HepG2. Fluorescent in situ hybridization has mapped the gene locus of hB1F to the region q31-32.1 of human chromosome 1. Altogether, this study provides the first report that a novel human homolog of FTZ-F1 binds and regulates ENII of HBV. The potential roles of this FTZ-F1 homolog in tissue-specific gene regulation, in embryonic development, as well as in liver carcinogenesis are discussed.
Transgenic maize, Zea mays L., expressing the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) CrylAb toxin has been planted to extensive areas across the United States and several other countries, but no resistance has been documented in field populations oflepidopteran target pests. This article describes the first report of resistance alleles to commercially available Cry1Ab Bt maize in a Louisiana population of sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis (F.) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae). Two hundred thirteen two-parent isolines of D. saccharalis were screened for Cry1Ab resistance on Bt maize leaf tissue using an F2 screening technique. Larvae representing three isolines survived &gt;15 d on Bt tissue in the F2 generation. The second generation backcross progeny (B1F2) derived from isoline 52 completed larval development on Bt maize in the greenhouse. Segregation and resistance frequency analysis associated with isoline 52 suggested that Bt resistance is probably determined by a nearly completely recessive allele at a single locus. With this assumption, the estimated resistance allele frequency in this population is 0.0023, within a 95% confidence interval of 0.0003-0.0064.
Predicting the effects of climate warming and fire disturbance on forest aboveground biomass is a central task of studies in terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycle. The alteration of temperature, precipitation, and disturbance regimes induced by climate warming will affect the carbon dynamics of forest ecosystem. Boreal forest is an important forest type in China, the responses of which to climate warming and fire disturbance are increasingly obvious. In this study, we used a forest landscape model LANDIS PRO to simulate the effects of climate change on aboveground biomass of boreal forests in the Great Xing'an Mountains, and compared direct effects of climate warming and the effects of climate warming-induced fires on forest aboveground biomass. The results showed that the aboveground biomass in this area increased under climate warming scenarios and fire disturbance scenarios with increased intensity. Under the current climate and fire regime scenario, the aboveground biomass in this area was (97.14±5.78) t·hm-2, and the value would increase up to (97.93±5.83) t·hm-2 under the B1F2 scenario. Under the A2F3 scenario, aboveground biomass at landscape scale was relatively higher at the simulated periods of year 100-150 and year 150-200, and the value were (100.02±3.76) t·hm-2 and (110.56±4.08) t·hm-2, respectively. Compared to the current fire regime scenario, the predicted biomass at landscape scale was increased by (0.56±1.45) t·hm-2 under the CF2 scenario (fire intensity increased by 30%) at some simulated periods, and the aboveground biomass was reduced by (7.39±1.79) t·hm-2 in CF3 scenario (fire intensity increased by 230%) at the entire simulation period. There were significantly different responses between coniferous and broadleaved species under future climate warming scenarios, in that the simulated biomass for both Larix gmelinii and Betula platyphylla showed decreasing trend with climate change, whereas the simulated biomass for Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica, Picea koraiensis and Populus davidiana showed increasing trend at different degrees during the entire simulation period. There was a time lag for the direct effect of climate warming on biomass for coniferous and broadleaved species. The response time of coniferous species to climate warming was 25-30 years, which was longer than that for broadleaf species. The forest landscape in the Great Xing'an Mountains was sensitive to the interactive effect of climate warming (high CO2 emissions) and high intensity fire disturbance. Future climate warming and high intensity forest fire disturbance would significantly change the composition and structure of forest ecosystem.
预测森林地上生物量对气候变化和林火干扰的响应是陆地生态系统碳循环研究的重要内容,气温、降水等因素的改变和气候变暖导致林火干扰强度的变化将会影响森林生态系统的碳库动态.东北森林作为我国森林的重要组成部分,对气候变化和林火干扰的响应逐渐显现.本文运用LANDIS PRO模型,模拟气候变化对大兴安岭森林地上生物量的影响,并比较分析了气候变暖对森林地上生物量的直接影响与通过林火干扰强度改变所产生的影响.结果表明: 未来气候变暖和火干扰增强情景下,森林地上生物量增加;当前气候条件和火干扰下,研究区森林地上生物量为(97.14±5.78) t·hm-2;在B1F2预案下,森林地上生物量均值为(97.93±5.83) t·hm-2;在A2F3预案下,景观水平第100～150和150～200年模拟时期内的森林地上生物量均值较高,分别为(100.02±3.76)和(110.56±4.08) t·hm-2.与当前火干扰相比,CF2预案(当前火干扰增加30%)在一定时期使景观水平地上生物量增加(0.56±1.45) t·hm-2,CF3预案(当前火干扰增加230%)在整个模拟阶段使地上生物量减少(7.39±1.79) t·hm-2.针叶、阔叶树种对气候变暖的响应存在差异,兴安落叶松和白桦生物量随气候变暖表现为降低趋势,而樟子松、云杉和山杨的地上生物量则随气候变暖表现出不同程度的增加;气候变暖对针阔树种的直接影响具有时滞性,针叶树种响应时间比阔叶树种迟25～50年.研究区森林对高CO2排放情景下气候变暖和高强度火干扰的共同作用较为敏感,未来将明显改变研究区森林生态系统的树种组成和结构.
Cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in a pathway through which cholesterol is metabolized to bile acids. The gene encoding cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase, CYP7A, is expressed exclusively in the liver. Overexpression of CYP7A in hamsters results in a reduction of serum cholesterol levels, suggesting that the enzyme plays a central role in cholesterol homeostasis. Here, we report the identification of a hepatic-specific transcription factor that binds to the promoter of the human CYP7A gene. We designate this factor CPF, for CYP7A promoter binding factor. Mutation of the CPF binding site within the CYP7A promoter abolished hepatic-specific expression of the gene in transient transfection assays. A cDNA encoding CPF was cloned and identified as a human homolog of the Drosophila orphan nuclear receptor fushi tarazu F1 (Ftz-F1). Cotransfection of a CPF expression plasmid and a CYP7A reporter gene resulted in specific induction of CYP7A-directed transcription. These observations suggest that CPF is a key regulator of human CYP7A gene expression in the liver.
Hepatic cytochrome P450 cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, CYP7, is regulated in vivo at the protein and the mRNA level in response to multiple physiological factors, including liver cholesterol synthesis, bile acid feedback inhibition, and diurnal rhythm. In the present study we investigated whether the liver transcription factor DBP (albumin promoter D-site binding protein), which undergoes a striking diurnal rhythm in rat liver (DBP levels during evening/morning approximately 100:1), contributes to the diurnal regulation of CYP7 gene expression. DNase I footprinting analysis using bacterially expressed DBP and a cloned 5'-flanking DNA segment of the rat CYP7 gene revealed five distinct DBP-binding sites, designated A-E, distributed between nucleotides (nts) -41 and -295 relative to the CYP7 transcription start site. CYP7-directed gene transcription in HepG2 cells transfected with a 5'-CYP7 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase reporter was activated up to 12-fold upon cotransfection of a DBP expression vector, whereas an HNF-1 alpha expression vector did not stimulate CYP7 gene activity. 5'-Deletion analyses and site-specific mutagenesis revealed that this stimulating effect of DBP can in part be ascribed to its functional interaction with DBP binding sites B (nts -115/-125), C (nts -172/-195), and D (nts -214/-230). C/EBP beta (LAP), another liver-enriched basic-leucine zipper transcription factor, bound to these same sites but effected a more modest increase in CYP7-directed gene transcription (up to 3-4-fold) when expressed in HepG2 cells. Competition for CYP7 promoter-binding sites between C/EBP, which undergoes &lt; or = 2-fold diurnal change in rat liver, and the diurnally regulated DBP is proposed to determine the relative rates of basal versus diurnally regulated CYP7 gene transcription and thus may be a primary mechanism for setting the 3-6-fold amplitude that characterizes the circadian rhythm of liver CYP7 expression. Moreover, since DBP is first expressed in rat liver 3-4 weeks after birth, these findings may account for both the enhanced expression and the onset of the diurnal pattern of CYP7 enzyme levels at this stage of development.
The cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) plays a key role in reverse cholesterol transport in mediating the transfer of cholesteryl ester from HDL to atherogenic apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins (VLDL, IDL, and LDL). Variation in plasma CETP mass in both normolipidemic and dyslipidemic individuals may reflect differences in CETP gene expression. As the 5' flanking sequence up to 3.4 kb of the human CETP gene contributes to transcriptional activity and tissue-specific gene expression, we evaluated the role of the distal promoter region in the modulation of CETP gene expression. In transfection experiments in HepG2 cells, we presently demonstrate that an Alu repeat (-2,153/-2,414) acts as a repressive element, whereas a binding site for the orphan nuclear receptor CYP7A promoter binding factor (CPF), at position -1,042, facilitates activation of human CETP promoter activity. Cotransfection of liver receptor homolog, the mouse homologue of CPF in HEK293 cells that lack CPF, indicated that the -1,042 CPF site is sufficient to induce CPF-mediated activation of CETP promoter activity. Taken together, our results indicate that the distal-promoter region is a major component in the modulation of human CETP promoter activity, and that it may contribute to the liver-specific expression of the CETP gene.
To identify transcription factors (TFs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Lrh1 (also named Nr5a2) and its homologous genes in Lrh1-knockout pancreas of mice.
The RNA-Seq data GSE34030 were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, including 2 Lrh1 pancreas knockout samples and 2 wild type samples. All reads were processed through TopHat and Cufflinks package to calculate gene-expression level. Then, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified via non-parametric algorithm (NOISeq) methods in R package, of which the homology genes of Lrh1 were identified via BLASTN analysis. Furthermore, the TFs of Lrh1 and its homologous genes were selected based on TRANSFAC database. Additionally, the SNPs were analyzed via SAM tool to record the locations of mutant sites.
Total 15683 DEGs were identified, of which 23 was Lrh1 homology genes (3 up-regulated and 20 down-regulated). Fetoprotein TF (FTF) was the only TF of Lrh1 identified and the promoter-binding factor of FTF was CYP7A. The SNP annotations of Lrh1 homologous genes showed that 92% of the mutation sites were occurred in intron and upstream. Three SNPs of Lrh1 were located in intron, while 1819 SNPs of Phkb were located in intron and 1343 SNPs were located in the upstream region.
FTF combined with CYP7A might play an important role in Lrh1 regulated pancreas-specific transcriptional network. Furthermore, the SNPs analysis of Lrh1 and its homology genes provided the candidate mutant sites that might affect the Lrh1-related production and secretion of pancreatic fluid.
Cholesterol gallstone formation is a complex process and involves phase separation of cholesterol crystals from supersaturated bile. In most cases, cholesterol hypersecretion is considered the primary event in gallstone formation. The sterol is transported through the hepatocytic canalicular membrane by ABCG5-G8. Expression of this transport protein is regulated by transcription factor Liver X Receptor-alpha, which may be responsible for biliary hypersecretion. Hydrophobic bile salt pool, bile concentration, excess pronucleating mucin, and impaired gallbladder and intestinal motility are secondary phenomena in most cases but nevertheless may contribute to gallstone formation.
Hepatic stem cells (HSCs) are involved in repair of liver injury. Stem cells may have inhibitory effects on tumor cell growth and apoptosis. However, it is unknown whether HSCs regulate the biological functions of hepatocarcinoma cells, especially tumor cell growth and apoptosis. The present study was designed to determine the effects of hepatocytic precursor (stem-like) WB-F344 cells on the growth and apoptosis of hepatoma CBRH-7919 cells. Using a Transwell chamber culture system, we co-cultured WB-F344 cells and CBRH-7919 cells in serum-free conditioned medium at 3 different ratios: 1:1 (2 x 10(5): 2 x 10(5) cells/well), 1:5 (4 x 10(4): 2 x 10(5) cells/well), and 5:1 (2 x 10(5): 4 x 10(4) cells/well). We determined the effects of stem cells on tumor cells using in vivo xenograft assay in nude mice and determining gene expression by RT-PCR and Western blot analyses. With the increment proportion of the WB-F344 cells in the co-culture system, tumor formation was inhibited in nude mice. Moreover, down-regulation of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), Bcl-2, and c-Myc and upregulation of PTEN also occurred along with the inhibitory effects. Western blotting showed that the TGF-beta/Smad pathway played a prominent role in tumor inhibition, which may have been mediated by the cytokines released from the stem cells. In conclusion, hepatocytic precursor (stem-like) WB-F344 cells inhibit the tumorigenicity of hepatoma CBRH-7919 cells, and the effect is mediated by TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathway.
For hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a leading cause of cancer death world-wide, there is no effective therapy especially for the advanced stage of the disease. Thus, we started the investigations about a novel anti HCC approach based on the depletion of the transcription factor serum response factor (SRF) in HCC cell lines; SRF choice was based on its recently proposed contribution to HCC tissue development and on its important role in cell proliferation. SRF depletion, obtained by a siRNA (siSRF797), was studied in two HCC cell lines, i.e. HepG2 and JHH6 assigned to high and low hepatocytic differentiation grade on the base of the capacity to synthesize albumin. In the HCC cell lines examined, siSRF797 reduced both the mRNA and protein levels of SRF without inducing unspecific interferon response or cytotoxicity. Moreover, SRF depletion induced the reduction of S-phase cells and a decrease in cell number and vitality. Particularly in HepG2, cell growth impairment was paralleled by the decrease of the levels of the transcription factor E2F1 together with some of its regulated genes. In HepG2 but not in JHH6, SRF depletion was associated with apoptosis. Finally, in both HepG2 and JHH6, the combined administration of siSRF797 and bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor whose therapeutic potential for HCC is considered attractive, further reduced cell viability compared to either siSRF797 or bortezomib treatment alone. In conclusion, SRF depletion affects the expansion of the high and low differentiation grade HCC cells HepG2 and JHH6. These results can pave the way to understand the role of SRF in HCC development and possibly to identify novel anti HCC therapeutic strategies.
Hepatocytes are considered an exception of the paradigmatic inverse correlation between cell proliferation and terminal differentiation. In fact, hepatic vital functions are guaranteed by proliferating parenchymal cells during liver regeneration. However, a fine molecular characterization of the relationship between proliferation and differentiation in hepatocytes has been hampered by the lack of reliable in vivo or in vitro models.
The hepatocyte terminal differentiation program was characterized in the immortalized, untransformed and differentiated hepatocytic cell line MMH, using several techniques. Particularly, two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis combined to tandem mass spectrometry proteomic approach was used. Cell cycle and cell adhesion properties of MMH have been altered using either myc-overexpression and MEK1/2 inhibition or a constitutive active beta-catenin mutant, respectively.
The hepatocyte terminal differentiation program is stimulated by the exit from the cell cycle induced by cell-cell contact. Comparative proteomic analysis of proliferating versus quiescent hepatocytes validated the importance of contact inhibition, identifying 68 differently expressed gene products, representing 49 unique proteins. Notably, enzymes involved in important liver functions such as detoxification processes, lipid metabolism, iron and vitamin A storage and secretion, anti-inflammatory response and exocytosis were found significantly up-regulated in quiescent hepatocytes. Finally, we found that: (i) cell cycle arrest induced by MEK1/2 inhibition is not sufficient to induce hepatic product expression; (ii) constitutive activation of beta-catenin counteracts the contact inhibition-induced terminal differentiation.
The hepatocyte terminal differentiation program requires a quiescent state maintained by cell-cell contact through the E-cadherin/beta-catenin pathway, rather than the inhibition of proliferation.
Tissue factor/coagulation factor VII (fVII) complex formation on the surface of cancer cells plays important roles in cancer biology, such as cell migration and invasion, angiogenesis, and antiapoptotic effects. We recently found that various cancer cells ectopically synthesize fVII, resulting in activation of cell motility and invasion. Here, we characterized mechanisms of hepatic and ectopic fVII (FVII) gene expression to identify molecular targets enabling selective inhibition of the ectopic expression. Unlike hepatic expression, hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 binding to the promoter is not required for ectopic FVII expression, although Sp1 binding is essential. Furthermore, we found novel nuclear targets of basal hepatocytic and ectopic FVII expression. Notably, histone acetyltransferases p300 and cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein-binding protein (CBP) are exclusively recruited to the promoter region of the FVII gene specifically in breast cancer cells. We further show that curcumin, a dietary compound, can selectively inhibit ectopic fVII expression by targeting p300/CBP activity. These results suggest a strategy to inhibit ectopic fVII-induced tumor progression without impairment of the physiologic hemostatic process.
Hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) hold a great potential for therapeutic intervention for currently untreatable liver diseases. However, in human diseases molecular mechanisms involved in proliferation and differentiation of HPCs are poorly understood.
In the present study activated HPCs and their microenvironment (niche) were investigated in acute and chronic human liver disease by gene-expression analysis and immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence. Cryopreserved liver tissues were used from patients with parenchymal versus biliary diseases: acute necrotising hepatitis (AH), cirrhosis after hepatitis C infection, and primary biliary cirrhosis in order to study differentiation of HPCs towards hepatocytic versus biliary lineage. Keratin 7 positive HPCs/reactive ductules were captured by means of laser capture microdissection and gene-expression profiles were obtained by using a customized PCR array. Gene expression results were confirmed by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence double staining. In all disease groups, microdissected HPCs expressed progenitor cell markers such as KRT7, KRT19, NCAM, ABCG2, LIF, KIT, OCT4, CD44 and TERT. In AH, HPCs were most activated and showed a high expression of prominin-1 (CD133) and alpha-fetoprotein, and a strong activation of the Wnt pathway. In contrast to parenchymal diseases, HPCs in primary biliary cirrhosis (biliary differentiation) showed a high activation of Notch signalling.
A distinct pattern of HPC surface markers was found between acute and chronic liver diseases. Similar to what is known from animal experiments, strong evidence has been found signifying the role of Wnt signalling in proliferation of human HPCs whereas Notch signalling is involved in biliary differentiation. These pathways can be targeted in future therapies.
Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an endogenous factor that restrains hepatic insulin resistance in diet-induced steatosis. Reducing IL-10 expression increases proinflammatory activity in the steatotic liver and worsens insulin resistance. As the transcriptional coactivator proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) plays a central role in dysfunctional hepatocytic activity in diet-induced steatosis, we hypothesized that at least part of the action of PGC-1alpha could be mediated by reducing the transcription of the IL-10 gene. Here, we used immunoblotting, real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunocytochemistry, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to investigate the role of PGC-1alpha in the control of IL-10 expression in hepatic cells. First, we show that, in the intact steatotic liver, the expressions of IL-10 and PGC-1alpha are increased. Inhibiting PGC-1alpha expression by antisense oligonucleotide increases IL-10 expression and reduces the steatotic phenotype. In cultured hepatocytes, the treatment with saturated and unsaturated fatty acids increased IL-10 expression. This was accompanied by increased association of PGC-1alpha with c-Maf and p50-nuclear factor (NF) kappaB, 2 transcription factors known to modulate IL-10 expression. In addition, after fatty acid treatment, PGC-1alpha, c-Maf, and p50-NFkappaB migrate from the cytosol to the nuclei of hepatocytes and bind to the IL-10 promoter region. Inhibiting NFkappaB activation with salicylate reduces IL-10 expression and the association of PGC-1alpha with p50-NFkappaB. Thus, PGC-1alpha emerges as a potential transcriptional regulator of the inflammatory phenomenon taking place in the steatotic liver.
Myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD-2) binds Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide with high affinity and is essential for Toll-like receptor 4-dependent signal transduction. MD-2 has recently been recognized as a type II acute phase protein. Plasma concentrations of the soluble form of MD-2 increase markedly during the course of severe infections. Its production is regulated in hepatocytes and myeloid cells by interleukin-6 (IL-6) but not IL-1beta. In the present work we show that two transcription factors (TF), PU.1 and CAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta), participate in the activation of the human MD-2 gene in hepatocytic cells after stimulation with IL-6. PU.1 TF and proximal PU.1 binding sites in the MD-2 promoter were shown to be critical for the basal activity of the promoter as well as for IL-6-induced soluble MD-2 production. Deletions of proximal portions of the MD-2 promoter containing PU.1 and/or NF-IL-6 consensus binding sites as well as site-directed mutagenesis of these binding sites abrogated IL-6-dependent MD-2 gene activation. We show that the cooperation between C/EBPbeta and PU.1 is critical for the transcriptional activation of the MD-2 gene by IL-6. PU.1 was essentially known as a TF involved in the differentiation of myeloid precursor cells and the expression of surface receptors of the innate immunity. Herein, we show that it also participates in the regulation of an acute phase protein, MD-2, in nonmyeloid cells cooperatively with C/EBPbeta, a classical IL-6-inducible TF.
Adiponectin is believed to exert hepatoprotective effects and induces CXCL8, a chemokine that functions as a survival factor, in vascular cells. In the current study, it is demonstrated that adiponectin also induces CXCL8 expression in primary human hepatocytes but not in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. Knock down of the adiponectin receptor (AdipoR) 1 or AdipoR2 by small-interfering RNA indicates that AdipoR1 is involved in adiponectin-stimulated CXCL8 release. Adiponectin activates nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB in primary hepatocytes and pharmacological inhibition of NF-kappaB, the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/ERK2 reduces adiponectin-mediated CXCL8 secretion. Furthermore, adiponectin also activates STAT3 involved in interleukin (IL)-6 and leptin-mediated CXCL8 induction in primary hepatocytes. Inhibition of JAK2 by AG-490 does not abolish adiponectin-stimulated CXCL8, indicating that this kinase is not involved. Pretreatment of primary cells with "STAT3 Inhibitor VI," however, elevates hepatocytic CXCL8 secretion, demonstrating that STAT3 is a negative regulator of CXCL8 in these cells. In accordance with this assumption, IL-6, a well-characterized activator of STAT3, reduces hepatocytic CXCL8. Therefore, adiponectin-stimulated induction of CXCL8 seems to be tightly controlled in primary human hepatocytes, whereas neither NF-kappaB, STAT3, nor CXCL8 are influenced in hepatocytic cell lines. CXCL8 is a survival factor, and its upregulation by adiponectin may contribute to the hepatoprotective effects of this adipokine.
Transforming growth factor-beta / bone morphogenetic protein (TGFbeta/BMP) signaling has a gradient of effects on cell fate choice in the fetal mouse liver. The molecular mechanism to understand why adjacent cells develop into bile ducts or grow actively as hepatocytes in the ubiquitous presence of both TGFbeta ligands and receptors has been unknown. We hypothesized that microRNAs (miRNAs) might play a role in cell fate decisions in the liver. miRNA profiling during late fetal development in the mouse identified miR-23b cluster miRNAs comprising miR-23b, miR-27b, and miR-24-1 and miR-10a, miR-26a, and miR-30a as up-regulated. In situ hybridization of fetal liver at embryonic day 17.5 of gestation revealed miR-23b cluster expression only in fetal hepatocytes. A complementary (c)DNA microarray approach was used to identify genes with a reciprocal expression pattern to that of miR-23b cluster miRNAs. This approach identified Smads (mothers against decapentaplegic homolog), the key TGFbeta signaling molecules, as putative miR-23b cluster targets. Bioinformatic analysis identified multiple candidate target sites in the 3' UTRs (untranslated regions) of Smads 3, 4, and 5. Dual luciferase reporter assays confirmed down-regulation of constructs containing Smad 3, 4, or 5, 3' UTRs by a mixture of miR-23b cluster mimics. Knockdown of miR-23b miRNAs during hepatocytic differentiation of a fetal liver stem cell line, HBC-3, promoted expression of bile duct genes, in addition to Smads, in these cells. In contrast, ectopic expression of miR-23b mimics during bile duct differentiation of HBC-3 cells blocked the process.
Our data provide a model in which miR-23b miRNAs repress bile duct gene expression in fetal hepatocytes while promoting their growth by down-regulating Smads and consequently TGFbeta signaling. Concomitantly, low levels of the miR-23b miRNAs are needed in cholangiocytes to allow TGFbeta signaling and bile duct formation.
NF kappaB transcription factor regulates gene expression in response to extracellular stimuli such as TNF alpha. The genes regulated by NF kappaB encode for proteins which control cell growth and survival. Met is the tyrosine kinase receptor for hepatocyte growth factor, and it too promotes cell mitogenesis and survival. Previously, we showed that Met gene expression is regulated by TNF alpha. In this report, we identify and characterize a TNF alpha response element in the Met promoter. This element contains tandem C/EBP sites adjacent to an NF kappaB site. Binding of the NF kappaB p65 subunit and C/EBP beta to this element is induced by TNF alpha. To examine the interplay of NF kappaB and Met in vivo, we determined that Met mRNA and protein levels are reduced in the livers of p65-/- mice as compared to controls. In p65-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), Met induction by TNF alpha is abrogated while Met's basal gene expression is reduced by half as compared to controls. When overexpressed in p65-/- MEFs, Met confers resistance to TNF-alpha-mediated cell death. Conversely, expression of dominant negative Met in wild-type MEFs renders them sensitive to cell death induced by TNF alpha. A similar response following TNF alpha challenge was observed in hepatocytic cells treated with siRNA to knockdown endogenous Met. Together, these results indicate that the Met gene is a direct target of NF kappaB and that Met participates in NF kappaB-mediated cell survival.
It is still unclear how Interferon-alfa (IFN-alpha) acts on preventing the appearance of hepatocarcinogenesis. We have demonstrated that IFN-alpha2b induces hepatocytic transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta(1)) production and secretion by inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation through the activation of NADPH oxidase. This TGF-beta(1), alters antioxidant defences and induces programmed cell death. Since it was demonstrated that IFN-alpha induces apoptosis through the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), this study was aimed to assess the role of this kinase in the IFN-alpha2b-induced apoptosis in rat liver preneoplasia; and to further evaluate the participation of NADPH oxidase. p38 MAPK pathway was activated during the IFN-alpha2b-induced apoptosis in rat liver preneoplasia. This activation was accompanied with phosphorylation of different transcription factors, depending on the time of IFN-alpha2b stimulus. Our data suggest that NADPH oxidase is activated by IFN-alpha2b through p38 MAPK. p38 MAPK-induced activation of NADPH oxidase is accomplished by a two-step pathway: first, ROS-independent and second ROS- and TGF-beta(1)-dependent.
Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling involves both tumor-suppression and oncogenesis. TGF-beta activates the TGF-beta type I receptor (TbetaRI) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which differentially phosphorylate the mediator Smad3 to become COOH-terminally phosphorylated Smad3 (pSmad3C) and linker-phosphorylated Smad3 (pSmad3L). TbetaRI-dependent pSmad3C transmits a tumor-suppressive TGF-beta signal, while JNK-dependent pSmad3L promotes carcinogenesis in human chronic liver disorders. The aim of this study is to elucidate how SP600125, a JNK inhibitor, affected rat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development, while focusing on the domain-specific phosphorylation of Smad3. The rats received subcutaneous injections of either SP600125 or vehicle 11 times weekly together with 100 ppm N-diethylnitrosamine (DEN) administration for 56 days and were sacrificed in order to evaluate HCC development 28 days after the last DEN administration. The number of tumor nodules greater than 3 mm in diameter and the liver weight/body weight ratio were significantly lower in the SP600125-treated rats than those in the vehicle-treated rats (7.9 +/- 0.8 versus 17.7 +/- 0.9: P &lt; 0.001; 6.3 +/- 1.2 versus 7.1 +/- 0.2%: P &lt; 0.05). SP600125 significantly prolonged the median survival time in rats with DEN-induced HCC (113 versus 97 days: log-rank P = 0.0018). JNK/pSmad3L/c-Myc was enhanced in the rat hepatocytes exposed to DEN. However, TbetaRI/pSmad3C/p21(WAF1) was impaired as DEN-induced HCC developed and progressed. The specific inhibition of JNK activity by SP600125 suppressed pSmad3L/c-Myc in the damaged hepatocytes and enhanced pSmad3C/p21(WAF1), acting as a tumor suppressor in normal hepatocytes.
Administration of SP600125 to DEN-treated rats shifted hepatocytic Smad3-mediated signal from oncogenesis to tumor suppression, thus suggesting that JNK could be a therapeutic target of human HCC development and progression.
Lineage-priming is a molecular model of stem cell (SC) differentiation in which proliferating SCs express a subset of genes associated to the differentiation pathways to which they can commit. This concept has been developed for hematopoietic SCs, but has been poorly studied for other SC populations. Because the differentiation potential of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM MSCs) remains controversial, we have explored the theory of lineage-priming applied to these cells. We show that proliferating primary layers and clones of BM MSCs have precise priming to the osteoblastic (O), chondrocytic (C), adipocytic (A), and the vascular smooth muscle (V) lineages, but not to skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, hematopoietic, hepatocytic, or neural lineages. Priming was shown both at the mRNA (300 transcripts were evaluated) and the protein level. In particular, the master transactivator proteins PPARG, RUNX2, and SOX9 were coexpressed before differentiation induction in all cells from incipient clones. We further show that MSCs cultured in the presence of inducers differentiate into the lineages for which they are primed. Our data point out to a number of signaling pathways that might be activated in proliferating MSCs and would be responsible for the differentiation and proliferation potential of these cells. Our results extend the notion of lineage-priming and provide the molecular framework for inter-A, -O, -C, -V plasticity of BM MSCs. Our data highlight the use of BM MSCs for the cell therapy of skeletal or vascular disorders, but provide a word of caution about their use in other clinical indications.
Hepatitis B virus X (HBx) protein is suspected to participate in oncogenesis during chronic hepatitis B progression. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling involves both tumor suppression and oncogenesis. TGF-beta activates TGF-beta type I receptor (TbetaRI) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which differentially phosphorylate the mediator Smad3 to become C-terminally phosphorylated Smad3 (pSmad3C) and linker-phosphorylated Smad3 (pSmad3L). Reversible shifting of Smad3-mediated signaling between tumor suppression and oncogenesis in HBx-expressing hepatocytes indicated that TbetaRI-dependent pSmad3C transmitted a tumor-suppressive TGF-beta signal, while JNK-dependent pSmad3L promoted cell growth. We used immunostaining, immunoblotting, and in vitro kinase assay to compare pSmad3L- and pSmad3C-mediated signaling in biopsy specimens representing chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from 90 patients chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) with signaling in liver specimens from HBx transgenic mice. In proportion to plasma HBV DNA levels, early chronic hepatitis B specimens showed prominence of pSmad3L in hepatocytic nuclei. HBx-activated JNK/pSmad3L/c-Myc oncogenic pathway was enhanced, while the TbetaRI/pSmad3C/p21(WAF1) tumor-suppressive pathway was impaired as human and mouse HBx-associated hepatocarcinogenesis progressed. Of 28 patients with chronic hepatitis B who showed strong oncogenic pSmad3L signaling, six developed HCC within 12 years; only one of 32 patients showing little pSmad3L developed HCC. In contrast, seven of 30 patients with little Smad3C phosphorylation developed HCC, while no patient who retained hepatocytic tumor-suppressive pSmad3C developed HCC within 12 years.
HBx shifts hepatocytic TGF-beta signaling from the tumor-suppressive pSmad3C pathway to the oncogenic pSmad3L pathway in early carcinogenic process. Hepatocytic pSmad3L and pSmad3C assessment in HBV-infected liver specimens should prove clinically useful for predicting risk of HCC.
Hepatic oval cells are thought to represent facultative hepatic epithelial stem cells in liver in which damage inhibits hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration. The LE/6 hepatic stem cell line was derived from the liver of male Sprague-Dawley rats fed a choline-deficient diet containing 0.1% ethionine. They are histochemically characterized by their expression of hepatocytic (hepPar1), cholangiocytic cytokeratin (CK19), hepatic progenitor cell (OV-6), and hematopoietic stem cell (c-kit) markers. In this study, we transplanted LE/6 cells by subcutaneous injection into adult female nude mice, and examined their engraftment and differentiation potential in the subcutaneous microenvironment in vivo. Our results demonstrated that following subcutaneous transplantation, differentiation of LE/6 cells into mesenchymal tumor tissue (MTT) was associated with reduced E-cadherin expression, upregulation of E-cadherin repressor molecules (Snail proteins), and increased expression of vimentin and N-cadherin, all of these events are characteristic of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
Studies have shown monounsaturated oleic acid to be less toxic than palmitic acid and to prevent/attenuate palmitic acid hepatocites toxicity in steatosis models in vitro. However, to what degree these effects are mediated by steatosis extent is unknown.
We evaluated whether steatosis per se is associated with hepatocytes apoptosis and determined the role of oleic and palmitic acid, the most abundant fatty acids in western diets, on triglyceride accumulation and apoptosis in an in vitro model of steatosis induced in three hepatocytic cell lines (HepG2, HuH7, WRL68). The impact of incubation for 24 h with oleic (0.66 and 1.32 mM) and palmitic acid (0.33 and 0.66 mM), alone or combined (molar ratio 2 : 1) on steatosis, apoptosis, and insulin signalling, was evaluated.
Concurrent with PPARgamma and SREBP-1 gene activation, steatosis extent was larger when cells were treated with oleic than with palmitic acid; the latter fatty acid was associated with increased PPARalpha expression. Cell apoptosis was inversely proportional to steatosis deposition. Moreover, palmitic, but not oleic acid, impaired insulin signalling. Despite the higher amount of fat resulting from incubation of the two fatty acids combined, the apoptosis rate and impaired insulin signalling were lower than in cells treated with palmitic acid alone, indicating a protective effect of oleic acid.
Oleic acid is more steatogenic but less apoptotic than palmitic acid in hepatocityc cell cultures. These data may provide a biological basis for clinical findings on dietary patterns and pathogenetic models of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
The immunohistochemical investigation used 55 primary hepatic tumors (hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)--32, cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC)--23). Wide panels of such antibodies as hepatocytic marker (Hep Par--1) CK-8, CK-19, polyclonal CEA, CD10, alpha-fetoprotein, TTF-1 as well as proliferative features of HCC (Ki-67) including regulators of stage-to-stage transition through mitoses of tumor cells (cyclin-D1 and A, genes p53 and RB), unrestricted tumor cell mitosis (telomerases), and intercellular adhesion marker (beta-catenin) were employed for differential diagnosis of neoplasia. The most efficient marker HCC was Hep Par--l (sensitivity--100%, specificity--92%) while the sensitivity of CCC (CK-19) was 83% and specificity--78%. Of particular importance for differentiation between HCC and CCC were the nature of microcirculatory flow identifiable with the aid of CD31 and presence of pseudocapsule in HCC detected by means of calponin. CEA and CD10 played a part too while the remaining markers were either expressed very seldom (alpha-fetoprotein) or absent (TTF-1). Most nuclear antigens (Ki-67, cyclin-A, p53 and RB) were intensely expressed in poorly-differentiated HCC cells. Cyclin-D1 and mutated suppressor-gene p53 expression involved lowered overall and relapse-free survival.
During early to late-fetal liver development, bipotential hepatoblasts proliferate and differentiate into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. The prospero-related homeobox 1 gene (Prox1) is expressed in hepatoblasts, and the inactivation of Prox1 causes defective early liver development, in particular, faulty migration of fetal hepatoblasts. Prox1 binds to another hepatocyte-enriched transcription factor, liver receptor homolog 1 (Lrh1), and suppresses its transcriptional activity. However, the molecular mechanism by which Prox1 and Lrh1 regulate the characteristics of fetal hepatic cells remains unknown. We investigated the contribution of Prox1 and Lrh1 in early liver development. Embryonic day 13 liver-derived CD45-Ter119-Dlk+ cells were purified as fetal hepatic stem/progenitor cells, and formation of colonies derived from single cells was detected under low-density culture conditions. We found that overexpression of Prox1 using retrovirus infection induced migration and proliferation of fetal hepatic stem/progenitor cells. In contrast, overexpression of Lrh1 suppressed colony formation. Prox1 induced the long-term proliferation of fetal hepatic stem/progenitor cells, which exhibited both high proliferative activity and bipotency for differentiation. Prox1 up-regulated expression of cyclins D2, E1, and E2, whereas it suppressed expression of p16(ink4a), the cdk inhibitor. In addition, overexpression of Prox1 significantly inhibited the proximal promoter activity of p16(ink4a).
These results suggested that Prox1 and Lrh1 coordinately regulate development of hepatic stem/progenitor cells and that Prox1 induces fetal hepatocytic proliferation through the suppression of the promoter activity of p16(ink4a).
The c-Myc protein has been implicated in playing a pivotal role in regulating the expression of a large number of genes involved in many aspects of cellular function. Consistent with this view, embryos lacking the c-myc gene exhibit severe developmental defects and die before midgestation. Here, we show that Sox2Cre-mediated deletion of the conditional c-myc(flox) allele specifically in the epiblast (hence trophoectoderm and primitive endoderm structures are wild type) rescues the majority of developmental abnormalities previously characterized in c-myc knockout embryos, indicating that they are secondary defects and arise as a result of placental insufficiency. Epiblast-restricted c-Myc-null embryos appear morphologically normal and do not exhibit any obvious proliferation defects. Nonetheless, these embryos are severely anemic and die before E12. c-Myc-deficient embryos exhibit fetal liver hypoplasia, apoptosis of erythrocyte precursors and functionally defective definitive hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Specific deletion of c-myc(flox) in hemogenic or hepatocytic lineages validate the hematopoietic-specific requirement of c-Myc in the embryo proper and provide in vivo evidence to support a synergism between hematopoietic and liver development. Our results reveal for the first time that physiological levels of c-Myc are essential for cell survival and demonstrate that, in contrast to most other embryonic lineages, erythroblasts and hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells are particularly dependent on c-Myc function.
The scattered cell clusters that can differentiate into hepatocytes or biliary epithelial cells have been isolated from primary cultures of adult porcine livers. We have generated 11 clonal cell lines from this system and identified liver progenitor cells (LPCs) among the clonal lines. These clonal lines expressed c-kit, HNF-1, HNF-6, and/or CK19 mRNA. An immunocytochemical study of the clonal lines indicated that clonal line CL-11 expressed liver epithelial cell markers CK14, vimentin, CK18, and BD-1. The expression of albumin and alpha1-antitrypsin (alpha1-AT) mRNA was only upregulated in CL-11 among the clonal lines when they were grown as aggregates. Under these conditions, CL-11 also exhibited ammonia metabolic activity and several indicators that suggest hepatocytic differentiation, including the upregulation of liver-specific genes such as dipeptidyl peptidase IV, CYP1A1, and CYP3A4 mRNA, and the downregulation of biliary cell markers such as gamma-glutamyltrans-peptidase (GGT), CK19, and HNF6 mRNA. After culturing CL-11 in Matrigel, the expression of GGT and HNF6 mRNA was upregulated. These results indicate that CL-11 has dual potential: the ability to differentiate as hepatocytes or as bile duct cells. The isolation of scattered cells could provide a simple method to generate LPC lines from adult livers.
Cholangiolocellular carcinoma (CLC), a subtype of cholangiocellular carcinoma (CC), is thought to originate from the ductules/canals of Hering, where hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) are located. We investigated the clinicopathological features of 30 CLCs and their relationship to HPCs. We evaluated the expression of hepatocytic markers (hepatocyte paraffin-1, canalicular polyclonal carcinoembryonic antigen, and CD10), biliary/HPC markers (keratin [K]7, K19, and neural cell adhesion molecule), the adenosine triphosphate binding cassette transporters: multidrug resistance protein 1, multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP)1, MRP3, and breast cancer resistance protein, using immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. In addition, gene expression profiling of CLC was performed and compared with the profile of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with or without HPC features (K19 expression). In surrounding nontumoral tissue, K7-positive and K19-positive HPCs/ductular reaction were observed. More than 90% of the tumor was composed of CLC areas that showed small monotonous and/or anastomosing glands, strongly positive for K7 and K19. Especially at the tumor boundary, all cases showed a HCC-like trabecular area characterized by canalicular CD10/polyclonal carcinoembryonic antigen expression, and submembranous K7 expression, similar to intermediate hepatocytes. K7-positive/K19-positive HPCs were also seen. Out of 30 cases, 19 showed papillary and/or clear glandular formation with mucin production, representing CC areas. These three different areas showed transitional zones with each other. We observed an increased expression of MRP1, MRP3, and breast cancer resistance protein in the tumor. Electron microscopy findings in HCC-like trabecular areas confirmed the presence of HPCs and intermediate hepatocytes. HPC markers, K7, K19, prominin-1, receptor for stem cell factor c-kit, octamer-4 transcription factor, and leukemia inhibitory factor were upregulated (P &lt; 0.05), while albumin was downregulated in CLC (P = 0.007) toward K19-negative HCCs. Comparison of CLC with K19-positive HCCs indicated a high homology.
All these findings highly suggest a progenitor cell origin of CLC.
Protein Z (PZ), which regulates blood coagulation, is mainly synthesized in the liver. Its plasma level varies widely among individuals, and is highly sensitive to Warfarin. The mechanism for the basic transcription of the human PZ gene, however, has not been reported. The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanism of gene regulation for PZ by characterizing its 5'-flanking region.
A reporter gene assay using the human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, identified a minimal promoter region (site A) and two enhancer regions (sites B and C) in the PZ gene. DNase I footprinting and electromobility shift assays revealed binding of the liver-enriched transcriptional factor hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4alpha to site A, the ubiquitous transcriptional factor Sp1 to sites A and C, and an unidentified factor to site B. The co-transfection of an HNF-4alpha expression vector with reporter gene constructs to the non-hepatic cell line HeLa resulted in a significant increase of PZ promoter activity.
HNF-4alpha plays a crucial role in human PZ gene expression in hepatocytic cells, and Sp1 is also important. These findings provide the first step toward understanding the mechanisms of the varying plasma PZ levels in individuals under physiological and pathological conditions.
Oval cells have great potential for use in cell therapy to treat liver disease, however this cannot be achieved until the factors which govern their proliferation and differentiation are better understood. We describe a method to establish primary cultures of murine oval cells, and the derivation of two novel lines from these. Primary cultures from the livers of wildtype or TAT-GRE lacZ transgenic mice subjected to a choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented diet comprised up to 80% oval cells at day 7 based on A6 or CK19 staining. Cell lines were clonally derived, which underwent spontaneous immortalisation following prolonged maintenance in culture. Immunostaining and RT-PCR demonstrated they express hepatocytic and biliary markers and they were therefore termed "bipotential murine oval liver" (BMOL) cells. Under proliferating culture conditions, BMOL or BMOL-TAT cells abundantly expressed oval cell and biliary markers, whereas mature hepatocytic markers were upregulated when the growth conditions were changed to facilitate differentiation. Hepatic differentiation of BMOL-TAT cells could be traced by measuring the expression of their lacZ transgene, which is driven by a promoter element from tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT), a marker of adult hepatocytes. Interestingly, haematopoietic markers were upregulated in superconfluent cultures, indicating a possible multipotentiality. None of the cell lines grew in semi-solid agar, nor did they form tumours in nude mice, suggesting they are non-tumourigenic. These novel murine oval cell lines, together with a reliable method for isolation and culture of primary oval cells, will provide a useful tool for investigating the contribution of oval cells to liver regeneration.
Hepatocellular adenomas (HCA) with activated beta-catenin present a high risk of malignant transformation. To permit robust routine diagnosis to allow for HCA subtype classification, we searched new useful markers. We analyzed the expression of candidate genes by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction QRT-PCR followed by immunohistochemistry to validate their specificity and sensitivity according to hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1alpha) and beta-catenin mutations as well as inflammatory phenotype. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that FABP1 (liver fatty acid binding protein) and UGT2B7 were downregulated in HNF1alpha-inactivated HCA (P &lt;or= 0.0002); GLUL (glutamine synthetase) and GPR49 overexpression were associated with beta-catenin-activating mutations (P &lt;or= 0.0005), and SAA2 (serum amyloid A2) and CRP (C-reactive protein) were upregulated in inflammatory HCA (P = 0.0001). Immunohistochemistry validation confirmed that the absence of liver-fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) expression rightly indicated HNF1alpha mutation (100% sensitivity and specificity), the combination of glutamine synthetase overexpression and nuclear beta-catenin staining were excellent predictors of beta-catenin-activating mutation (85% sensitivity, 100% specificity), and SAA hepatocytic staining was ideal to classify inflammatory HCA (91% sensitivity and specificity). Finally, a series of 93 HCA was unambiguously classified using our 4 validated immunohistochemical markers. Importantly, new associations were revealed for inflammatory HCA defined by SAA staining with frequent hemorrhages (P = 0.003), telangiectatic phenotype (P &lt; 0.001), high body mass index, and alcohol intake (P &lt;or= 0.04). Previously described associations were confirmed and in particular the significant association between beta-catenin-activated HCA and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) at diagnosis or during follow-up (P &lt; 10(-5)).
We refined HCA classification and its phenotypic correlations, providing a routine test to classify hepatocellular adenomas using simple and robust immunohistochemistry.
The hepatoprotective effect of interleukin-6 (IL-6)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) has been well documented. However, reports on the role of IL-6/STAT3 in liver regeneration are conflicting probably due to the fact that the model of Stat3 knockout mice were complicated with obesity and fatty liver, which may cause some secondary effects on liver regeneration. To study the direct role of STAT3 and to circumvent the problems of obesity and fatty liver in liver regeneration, we generated conditional STAT3 knockout in the liver (L-Stat3(-/-)) using a transthyretin-driven Cre-lox method. The L-Stat3(-/-) mice were born with the expected Mendelian frequency and showed no obesity or other obvious phenotype. After partial hepatectomy, mortality in the L-Stat3(-/-) mice was significantly higher than the littermate Stat3(f/+) controls in the early time points (&lt;24 h). Hepatocyte DNA synthesis in the survived L-Stat3(-/-) mice slightly decreased as compared with Stat3(f/+) mice at 40 h after partial hepatectomy, whereas similar hepatocyte DNA synthesis was found at other time points and liver mass could be completely recovered in the L-Stat3(-/-) mice. In another model of liver regeneration induced by subcutaneous injection of carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)), hepatocyte DNA synthesis in the CCl(4)-treated L-Stat3(-/-) mice also decreased as compared with Stat3(f/+) mice at 40 h after injection but not at other time points. In addition, infiltration of neutrophils and monocyte increased in the liver of CCl(4)-treated L-Stat3(-/-) mice compared to wild-type mice. In conclusion, STAT3 is required for survival in the acute stage after 70% hepatectomy and plays a role in inflammatory reaction after hepatocyte necrosis. However, the hepatocytic STAT3 may have limited role in liver mass recovery although DNA synthesis may be impaired.
Many patients with chronic hepatitis caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection develop liver fibrosis with high risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the mechanism underling this process is unclear. Conversely, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) activates not only TGF-beta type I receptor (TbetaRI) but also c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which convert the mediator Smad3 into two distinctive phosphoisoforms: C-terminally phosphorylated Smad3 (pSmad3C) and linker-phosphorylated Smad3 (pSmad3L). Whereas the TbetaRI/pSmad3C pathway suppresses epithelial cell growth by upregulating p21(WAF1) transcription, JNK/pSmad3L-mediated signaling promotes extracellular matrix deposition, partly, by upregulating plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1). We studied the domain-specific Smad3 phosphorylation in biopsy specimens representing chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or HCC from 100 patients chronically infected with HCV, and correlated Smad3 phosphorylation with clinical course. As HCV-infected livers progressed from chronic hepatitis through cirrhosis to HCC, hepatocytic pSmad3L/PAI-1 increased with fibrotic stage and necroinflammatory grade, and pSmad3C/p21(WAF1) decreased. Of 14 patients with chronic hepatitis C with strong hepatocytic pSmad3L positivity, 8 developed HCC within 12 years; only 1 of 12 showing little pSmad3L positivity developed HCC. We further sought molecular mechanisms in vitro. JNK activation by the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta stimulated the pSmad3L/PAI-1 pathway in facilitating hepatocytic invasion, in the meantime reducing TGF-beta-dependent tumor-suppressive activity by the pSmad3C/p21(WAF1) pathway.
These results indicate that chronic inflammation associated with HCV infection shifts hepatocytic TGF-beta signaling from tumor-suppression to fibrogenesis, accelerating liver fibrosis and increasing risk for HCC.
Studies that compare tumor genotype with phenotype have provided the basis of a new histological/molecular classification of hepatocellular adenomas. Based on two molecular criteria (presence of a TCF1/HNF1 alpha or beta-catenin mutation), and an additional histological criterion (presence or absence of an inflammatory infiltrate), subgroups of hepatocellular adenoma can be defined and distinguished from focal nodular hyperplasia. Analysis of 96 hepatocellular adenomas performed by a French collaborative network showed that they can be divided into four broad subgroups: the first one is defined by the presence of mutations in TCF1 gene inactivating the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1 alpha); the second by the presence of beta-catenin activating mutations; the category without mutations of HNF1 alpha or beta-catenin is further divided into 2 subgroups depending on the presence or absence of inflammation. Therefore, the approach to the diagnosis of problematic benign hepatocytic nodules may be entering a new era directed by new molecular information. It is hoped that immunohistological tools will improve significantly diagnosis of liver biopsy in our ability to distinguish hepatocellular adenoma from focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), and to delineate clinically meaningful entities within each group to define the best clinical management. The optimal care of patients with a liver nodule will benefit from the recent knowledge coming from molecular biology and the combined expertise of hepatologists, pathologists, radiologists, and surgeons.
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, a major regulator of translation, is frequently activated in hepatocellular carcinomas. We investigated the effects of mTOR activation in the human HepaRG cells, which possess potent hepatocytic differentiation capability. Differentiation of HepaRG cells into functional and polarized hepatocyte-like cells correlated with a decrease in mTOR and Akt activities. Stable cell lines expressing an activated mutant of mTOR were generated. Sustained activation of mTOR impaired the hepatocytic differentiation capability of these cells as shown by impaired formation of bile canaliculi, absence of polarity, and reduced secretion of alpha1-antitrypsin. An inhibitor of mTOR, rapamycin, was able to revert this phenotype. Furthermore, increased mTOR activity in HepaRG cells resulted in their resistance to the antiproliferative effects of transforming growth factor-beta1. Profiling of polysome-bound transcripts indicated that activated mTOR specifically targeted genes posttranscriptionally regulated on hepatocytic differentiation. Three major biological networks targeted by activated mTOR were identified: (a) cell death associated with tumor necrosis factor superfamily members, IFNs and caspases; (b) lipid homeostasis associated with the transcription factors PPARalpha, PPARdelta, and retinoid X receptor beta; and (c) liver development associated with CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha and hepatic mitogens. In conclusion, increased mTOR activity conferred a preneoplastic phenotype to the HepaRG cells by altering the translation of genes vital for establishing normal hepatic energy homeostasis and moderating hepatocellular growth.
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is critical for the control of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the clinical setting and in model systems. TNF induces noncytopathic suppression and clearance of HBV in animal models, possibly through reduction of viral nucleocapsids, but the mechanism is not well described. Here, we demonstrate the molecular mechanism and broad host range for TNF action against HBV. We show that TNF rapidly blocks HBV replication by promoting destabilization of preexisting cytoplasmic viral nucleocapsids containing viral RNA and DNA, as well as empty nucleocapsids. TNF destabilized human HBV nucleocapsids in a variety of human hepatocytic cell lines and in primary rat hepatocytes and also destabilized duck HBV (DHBV) nucleocapsids in chicken hepatocytic cells. Lysates from TNF-treated uninfected cells also destabilized HBV nucleocapsids in vitro. Moreover, inhibition of DHBV DNA replication by TNF blocks nuclear accumulation of the viral transcription template, maintenance of which is essential for the establishment and maintenance of chronic infection. We show that TNF destabilization of HBV nucleocapsids does not involve ubiquitination or methylation of the viral core protein and is not mediated by the nitric oxide free radical arm of the TNF pathway. These results define a novel antiviral mechanism mediated by TNF against multiple types of HBVs in different species.
Oval cells are hepatocytic precursors that proliferate in late-stage cirrhosis and that give rise to a subset of human hepatocellular carcinomas. Although liver regeneration typically occurs through replication of existing hepatocytes, oval cells proliferate only when hepatocyte proliferation is inhibited. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a key inhibitory cytokine for hepatocytes, both in vitro and in vivo. Because TGF-beta levels are elevated in chronic liver injury when oval cells arise, we hypothesized that oval cells may be less responsive to the growth inhibitory effects of this cytokine. To examine TGF-beta signaling in vivo in oval cells, we analyzed livers of rats fed a choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet for phospho-Smad2. Phospho-Smad2 was detected in more than 80% of hepatocytes, but staining was substantially reduced in oval cells. Ki67 staining, in contrast, was significantly more common in oval cells than hepatocytes. To understand the inverse relationship between TGF-beta signaling and proliferation in oval cells and hepatocytes, we examined TGF-beta signaling in vitro. TGF-beta caused marked growth inhibition in primary hepatocytes and the AML12 hepatocyte cell line. Two oval cell lines, LE/2 and LE/6, were less responsive. The greater sensitivity of the hepatocytes to TGF-beta-induced growth inhibition may result from the absence of Smad6 in these cells.
Our results indicate that oval cells, both in vivo and in vitro, are less sensitive to TGF-beta-induced growth inhibition than hepatocytes. These findings further suggest an underlying mechanism for the proliferation of oval cells in an environment inhibitory to hepatocytic proliferation.
Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is involved in tumor progression/metastasis and activated in various cancers. Here we show that HIF-1alpha, which plays a major role in HIF-1 activation, is overexpressed in preneoplastic hepatocytic lesions from a very early stage during hepatocarcinogenesis in mice and man. Transcriptional targets of HIF-1, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, glut-1, c-met, and insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II), were also overexpressed in mouse lesions. Oxygen tension within the lesions was not different from that of the normal hepatic tissues, indicating that HIF-1alpha expression was independent of hypoxia. On the other hand, Akt, the pathway of which can up-regulate HIF-1alpha expression, was activated in the mouse lesions, whereas HIF-1alpha was markedly down-regulated in the mouse hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines after treatment with a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, LY294002, indicating that HIF-1alpha expression is dependent on PI3K/Akt signaling. Conversely, HIF-1alpha knockdown by short interfering RNA in the HCC cell line resulted in decreased expression of activated Akt together with the HIF-1 target genes, indicating that Akt activation is reversely dependent on HIF-1 activation. Treating the HCC cells with IGF-II or epidermal growth factor (EGF) up-regulated both phospho-Akt and HIF-1alpha, whereas inhibition of IGF-II or EGF signaling down-regulated them both, suggesting that IGF-II and EGF can, at least in part, mediate the activation of Akt and HIF-1alpha. However, Akt was not activated by IGF-II or EGF in the HIF-1alpha knockdown cells, indicating that expression of the HIF-1 target genes is necessary for the Akt activation. These findings suggest that the reciprocal activation of PI3K/Akt signaling and HIF-1alpha may be important in the progression of hepatocarcinogenesis.
Patients coinfected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have progressive liver disease that frequently leads to cirrhosis and death. We previously showed that hepatocytes exposed to HCV and HIV envelope proteins undergo apoptosis via an innocent-bystander mechanism as a result of the cell surface binding of these proteins, independent of direct viral infection. Here, we have defined the mechanism of this hepatocytic apoptosis. We observed enhanced signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 1 (STAT1) activation and phosphorylation after costimulation with HCV-E2 and HIV-gp120. Moreover, inhibitor studies indicated that Lyn kinase, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and protein kinase C delta might be involved in STAT1 phosphorylation. To elucidate the downstream STAT1-mediated signaling, we overexpressed wild-type STAT1 alpha and the C-terminal domain-deleted mutant STAT1 beta . STAT1 alpha overexpression increased cell apoptosis and Fas ligand expression, compared with STAT1 beta overexpression. STAT1 alpha also enhanced the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and caspase-3 activity. These studies indicate that the HCV/HIV envelope proteins cooperatively induce hepatocytic apoptosis by activating a novel downstream STAT1 signaling pathway.
To investigate whether Thy1 recognizes oval cells in the fetal liver and to characterize the cultured Thy1- selected cells from E14 rat livers.
Thy1 populations were analyzed by fluorescence activated cell sorter analysis. Thy1 positive cells were isolated using magnetic beads. Hepatic markers were detected by Western blotting, immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR.
The percentage of Thy1-positive cells decreased during early development of fetal rat liver (E13-E16). E14 fetal livers contained 7.8% Thy1 positive cells, of which 61% were positive for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and 25% expressed albumin. The Thy1+ population expressed oval cell markers c-Kit and CXCR4, liver enriched-transcription factors HNF1alpha and HNF6, hepatocytic markers albumin, AFP and cytokeratin 18, and biliary marker cytokeratin 19. Thy1- selected cells formed only mesenchymal colonies when plated on collagen and in serum-containing media. Thy1 selected cells were able to form hepatic colonies positive for HNF1alpha, HNF6, albumin, AFP, cytokeratin 18, cytokeratin 19 and glycogen, when grown on STO feeder layers in serum free-media.
Oval cells positive for Thy1 are present in early liver embryonic stages.
To investigate the hepatocytic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in co-cultures with fetal liver cells (FLC) and the possibility to expand differentiated hepatocytic cells.
MSCs were marked with green fluorescent protein (GFP) by retroviral gene transduction. Clonal marked MSCs were either cultured under liver stimulating conditions using fibronectin-coated culture dishes and medium supplemented with stem cell factor (SCF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF-4) alone, or in presence of freshly isolated FLC. Cells in co-cultures were harvested, and GFP+ or GFP- cells were separated using fluorescence activated cell sorting. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the liver specific markers cytokeratin-18 (CK-18), albumin, and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was performed in different cell populations.
Under the specified culture conditions, rat MSCs co-cultured with FLC expressed albumin, CK-18, and AFP-RNA over two weeks. At wk 3, MSCs lost hepatocytic gene expression, probably due to overgrowth of the cocultured FLC. FLC also showed a stable liver specific gene expression in the co-cultures and a very high growth potential.
The rat MSCs from bone marrow can differentiate hepatocytic cells in the presence of FLC in vitro and the presence of MSCs in co-cultures also provides a beneficial environment for expansion and differentiation of FLC.
The promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein has been described as a transcriptional repressor of the BTB-domain/zinc-finger family, and shown to regulate the expression of Hox genes during embryogenesis and the expression of cyclin A in the cell cycle progression. Here, a 45-kDa isoform of PLZF without a BTB domain was identified via yeast two-hybrid screening using the C-terminal region of ATP7B as bait in our determination of the biological roles of the Wilson disease protein outside of its copper-binding domain. Our immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the hepatocytic isoform of PLZF could specifically interact with the C-terminal region of ATP7B. The immunostaining of HepG2 cells revealed that the ATP7B and PLZF proteins were apparently colocalized into the trans-Golgi complexes. It was also determined that disruption of PLZF expression in the HepG2 cells affected an attenuation of ERK activity in a dose-dependent manner. The hepatocytic activities of ERK kinase were found to be enhanced as the result of PLZF or ATP7B expression, but this enhancement was abrogated by the deletion of the C-terminal region of ATP7B. Furthermore, a transgenic Drosophila strain that ectopically expressed the hepatocytic deltaBTB-PLZF exhibited phenotypic changes in eye and wing development, and these alterations were fully recovered as the result of ATP7B expression, indicating the obvious in vivo interaction between the two proteins. Those PLZF-induced abnormalities were attributed to the enhancement of ERK signaling, as was shown by phenotypic reversions with loss-of-function mutations in ERK signal transduction in Drosophila. These data suggest the existence of a mechanism that regulates ERK signaling via the C-terminus of ATP7B and the ATP7B-interacting hepatocytic PLZF.
Bile duct morphogenesis involves sequential induction of biliary specific gene expression, bilayer generation, cell proliferation, remodeling and apoptosis. HBC-3 cells are a model system to study differentiation of hepatoblasts along the hepatocytic or bile ductular lineage in vitro and in vivo. We used microarray to define molecular pathways during ductular differentiation in response to Matrigel. The temporal pattern of expression of marker genes induced was similar to that observed during bile duct formation in vivo. Notch, HNF1beta, Polycystic kidney disease 2, Bicaudal C 1 and beta-catenin were up regulated during the time course. Functional clustering analysis revealed significant up regulation of clusters of genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, ion transport, vacuoles, lytic vacuoles, pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes, transcription factors and negative regulators of the cell proliferation, while genes involved in the cell cycle were significantly down regulated. Notch signaling pathway was activated by treatment with Matrigel. In addition, TGFbeta/BMP signaling pathway members including the type I TGFbeta receptor and Smads 3, 4 and 5 were significantly up regulated, as were several TGFbeta/BMP responsive genes including Hey 1, a regulator of Notch pathway signaling. SMADS 3, 4 and 5 were present in the nuclear fraction of HBC-3 cells during ductular differentiation in vitro, but not during hepatocyte differentiation. SMAD 5 was preferentially expressed in hepatoblasts undergoing bile duct morphogenesis in the fetal liver, while the TGFbeta/BMP signaling antagonist chordin, was expressed throughout the liver suggesting a mechanism by which TGFbeta/BMP signaling is limited to hepatoblasts that contact portal mesenchyme in vivo.
During liver development, hepatocytes and biliary cells differentiate from common progenitors called hepatoblasts. The factors that control hepatoblast fate decision are unknown. Here we report that a gradient of activin/TGFbeta signaling controls hepatoblast differentiation. High activin/TGFbeta signaling is required near the portal vein for differentiation of biliary cells. The Onecut transcription factors HNF-6 and OC-2 inhibit activin/TGFbeta signaling in the parenchyma, and this allows normal hepatocyte differentiation. In the absence of Onecut factors, the shape of the activin/TGFbeta gradient is perturbed and the hepatoblasts differentiate into hybrid cells that display characteristics of both hepatocytes and biliary cells. Thus, a gradient of activin/TGFbeta signaling modulated by Onecut factors is required to segregate the hepatocytic and the biliary lineages.
In an attempt to discover cell markers for liver stem cells, a cDNA microarray analysis was carried out to compare the gene expression profiles between an adult liver stem cell line, Lig-8, and mature hepatocytes. Several genes in the categories of extracellular matrix, cell membrane, cell adhesion, transcription factor, signal molecule, transporter, and metabolic enzyme were shown to be differentially expressed in Lig-8 cells. Among them, epithelial membrane protein (EMP)-1 has been previously implicated with stem cell phenotypes. Antiserum to EMP-1 was produced to localize its expression. On monolayers of Lig-8 cells, EMP-1 was expressed along the intercellular border. In the liver harboring proliferating oval cells, the liver progenitors, EMP-1 was localized as ribbon bands, a staining pattern for epithelial junctions, all the way through bile duct epithelia, oval cell ductules, and into peri-hepatocytic regions. These peri-hepatocytic regions were proved to be bile canaliculi by co-localization of EMP-1 and dipeptidyl peptidase IV, an enzyme located on bile canaliculi. This report is the first to indicate EMP-1 to be a junctional protein in the liver.
The adiponectin receptors AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 have been identified to mediate the insulin-sensitizing effects of adiponectin. Although AdipoR2 was suggested to be the main receptor for this adipokine in hepatocytes, AdipoR1 protein is highly abundant in primary human hepatocytes and hepatocytic cell lines. Nuclear receptors are main regulators of lipid metabolism and activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha and gamma, retinoid X receptor (RXR), and liver X receptor (LXR) by specific ligands may influence AdipoR1 abundance. AdipoR1 protein is neither altered by RXR or LXR agonists nor by pioglitazone. In contrast, fenofibric acid reduces AdipoR1 whereas hepatotoxic troglitazone upregulates AdipoR1 protein in HepG2 cells. Taken together this work shows for the first time that AdipoR1 protein is expressed in human hepatocytes but that it is not a direct target gene of nuclear receptors. Elevated AdipoR1 induced by hepatotoxic troglitazone may indicate a role of this receptor in adiponectin-mediated beneficial effects in liver damage.
We investigated the mechanism of phenotypic plasticity of hepatocytes in a three-dimensional organoid culture system, in which hepatocytic spheroids were embedded within a collagen gel matrix. Hepatocytes expressed several bile duct markers including cytokeratin (CK) 19 soon after culture and underwent branching morphogenesis within the matrix in the presence of insulin and epidermal growth factor. Cultured hepatocytes did not express Delta-like, a specific marker for oval cells and hepatoblasts. Furthermore, hepatocytes isolated from c-kit mutant rats (Ws/Ws), which are defective in proliferation of oval cells, showed essentially the same phenotypic changes as those isolated from control rats. The bile duct-like differentiation of hepatocytes was associated with increased expression of Jagged1, Jagged2, Notch1, and several Notch target genes. CK19 expression and branching morphogenesis were inhibited by dexamethasone, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) inhibitor (PD98059), and a phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase inhibitor (LY294002). After being cultured for more than 3 weeks within the gels, hepatocytes transformed into ductular structures surrounded by basement membranes. Our results suggest that hepatocytes might have the potential to transdifferentiate into bile duct-like cells without acquiring a stem-like phenotype and that this is mediated through specific protein tyrosine phosphorylation pathways.
An emerging area of research has demonstrated that plasminogen functions in the acute-phase response to tissue injury, neoplastic growth or infection. We have previously shown that the acute-phase mediator, interleukin (IL)-6, increases circulating plasminogen levels via upregulation of plasminogen promoter activity. We also identified a putative IL-6 responsive element (nt -791 to -783; IL6-RE) in the plasminogen gene that is required for maximal stimulation of promoter activity by IL-6. For the present study, we investigated the transcription factors and signaling pathway mediating the response of the plasminogen gene to IL-6. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), a radiolabeled oligonucleotide IL6-RE probe formed specific complexes with nuclear proteins from untreated hepatocytic cells. The extent of complex formation was markedly increased using nuclear proteins from IL-6-treated cells. Complex formation was abolished by an oligonucleotide with the consensus CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) sequence. Furthermore, complexes were supershifted by antibodies to C/EBPbeta. Treatment of Hepa 1-6 cells with the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor, PD-98059, inhibited IL-6-stimulated plasminogen promoter activity. These results suggest that transcription factor C/EBPbeta and the MAPK pathway play key roles in the response of the plasminogen gene to IL-6, thus elucidating a major mechanism by which the plasminogen system is upregulated to perform its crucial functions in the acute-phase response.
To generate insulin-producing cells in the liver, recombinant adenovirus containing a constitutively active mutant of PDX1 (PDX1-VP16), designed to activate target genes without the need for protein partners, was prepared and administered intravenously to streptozotocin (STZ)-treated diabetic mice. The effects were compared with those of administering wild-type PDX1 (wt-PDX1) adenovirus. Administration of these adenoviruses at 2x10(8)pfu induced similar levels of PDX1 protein expression in the liver. While wt-PDX1 expression exerted small effects on blood glucose levels, treatment with PDX1-VP16 adenovirus efficiently induced insulin production in hepatocytes, resulting in reversal of STZ-induced hyperglycemia. The effects were sustained through day 40 when exogenous PDX1-VP16 protein expression was undetectable in the liver. Endogenous PDX1 protein came to be expressed in the liver, which is likely to be the mechanism underlying the sustained effects. On the other hand, albumin and transferrin expressions were observed in insulin-producing cells in the liver, suggesting preservation of hepatocytic functions. Thus, transient expression of an active mutant of PDX1 in the liver induced sustained PDX1 and insulin expressions without loss of hepatocytic function.
In previous work we showed that interferon alfa-2b (IFN-alpha2b) increases apoptosis on rat hepatic preneoplastic foci. The aim of this study was to determine if transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) was involved in the programmed cell death on the foci. Animals were divided into 6 groups: subjected to a 2-phase model (diethylnitrosamine plus 2-acetylaminofluorene) of preneoplasia development (group 1); treated with IFN-alpha2b during the 2 phases (group 2); treated with IFN-alpha2b during initiation with diethylnitrosamine (group 3); treated with IFN-alpha2b during 2-acetylaminofluorene administration (group 4); subjected only to an initiation stage (group 5); and treated with IFN-alpha2b during the initiation period (group 6). Serum TGF-beta1 levels were increased in IFN-alpha2b-treated rats. Immunohistochemical studies showed that IFN-alpha2b significantly increased the quantity of TGF-beta1-positive hepatocytes in groups 2 to 4. Phosphorylated-Smads-2/3 (p-Smads-2/3) proteins in liver nuclear extracts were significantly elevated. To determine the source of TGF-beta1, isolated hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and peritoneal macrophages from animals in groups 1 and 5 were cultured with or without IFN-alpha2b. IFN-alpha2b stimulus induced several-fold increases of TGF-beta1 secretion from hepatocytes. Neither Kupffer cells nor peritoneal macrophages secreted detectable TGF-beta1 levels when they were treated with IFN-alpha2b. IFN-alpha2b-stimulated cultured hepatocytes from preneoplastic livers showed enhanced apoptosis, measured by fluorescence microscopy and caspase-3 activity. They presented higher nuclear accumulation of p-Smads-2/3, indicating increased TGF-beta1 signaling. When anti-TGF-beta1 was added to the culture media, TGF-beta1 activation and apoptosis induced by IFN-alpha2b were blocked. In conclusion, IFN-alpha2b-induced production of TGF-beta1 by hepatocytes from preneoplastic liver is involved in the apoptotic elimination of altered hepatic foci.
Interferon-alpha5 (IFN-alpha5) is the main IFN-alpha subtype expressed in the liver. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with low IFN-alpha5 mRNA levels, possibly reflecting an escape mechanism of the virus. In this work, we sought to compare IFN-alpha2 and IFN-alpha5 with respect to activation of early cell signaling cascades and induction of antiviral genes in the human hepatoma HepG2 and Huh7 cell lines. We found that the Tyr701 phosphorylation kinetics of Stat1 mediated by IFN stimulation was higher when cells were incubated with IFN-alpha5 than when using IFN-alpha2. Similarly, Tyr(1054/1055) phosphorylation kinetics of Tyk2 were more intense after exposure to IFN-alpha5 than when using IFN-alpha2. Concomitantly, Tyr705 phosphorylation of Stat3 was higher after stimulation with IFN-alpha5 than with IFN-alpha2. In parallel to these findings, the mRNA levels of the antiviral IFN-inducible gene 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase were higher in cell samples treated with IFN-alpha5 than with IFN-alpha2. These findings suggest that interaction of IFN-alpha5 and IFN-alpha2 subtypes with IFN type I receptor occurs differently, and this affects the intensity of expression of antiviral genes. In conclusion, our data show that in hepatocytic cells, IFN-alpha5 induces stronger signaling and higher expression of antiviral genes than IFN-alpha2. These data warrant clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of IFN-alpha5 in chronic viral hepatitis.
Under certain experimental conditions, hepatocytes can arise in the pancreas. It has been suggested that the pancreas retains a source of hepatocyte progenitor cells. However, such cells have not been yet identified in the adult pancreas. We describe here the transdifferentiation of primary rat pancreatic exocrine cells into hepatocyte-like cells during 5 days of tissue culture in the presence of dexamethasone (DX). Using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemistry, it was observed that DX treatment induced albumin RNA and protein expression in the cells. Coexpression of albumin and amylase, and the absence of cell proliferation, demonstrated a direct transdifferentiation of acinar cells to hepatocytic cells. CCAAT enhancer-binding protein-ss protein, a liver-enriched transcription factor that is considered to be the master switch in pancreatohepatic transdifferentiation, and alpha-fetoprotein were markedly upregulated in the cells after treatment with DX. We compared transcriptional profiles of freshly isolated exocrine cells and DX-treated cells using oligonucleotide microarrays and found that multiple liver-specific genes are induced along with albumin, and that certain pancreatic genes are downregulated in the DX-treated cells. In conclusion, these observations support the notion of plasticity in the adult pancreas and that exocrine cells can be reprogrammed to transdifferentiate into other cell types such as hepatocytes.
Hepatic regeneration from toxic or surgical injury to the adult mammalian liver, endorses different cellular responses within the hepatic lineage. The molecular mechanisms determining commitment of a cell population at a specific lineage level to participate in liver repair as well as the fate of its progeny in the hostile environment created by the injury are not well defined. Based on the role of the Notch/Delta/Jagged system in cell fate specification and recent reports linking Notch signaling with normal bile duct formation in mouse and human liver, we examined the expression of Notch1, Notch2, Notch3, Delta1, Delta3, Jagged1, and Jagged2, and delta-like protein/preadipocyte factor 1/fetal antigen 1 (dlk) in four well-defined experimental rat models of liver injury and regeneration. Although Delta3 and Jagged2 were undetectable by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Northern blot, we observed the most significant up-regulation of all other transcripts in the 2-acetylaminofluorene-70% hepatectomy (AAF/PHx) model, in which liver mass is restored by proliferation and differentiation of transit-amplifying ductular (oval) cells. The most profound change was observed for dlk. Accordingly, immunohistochemical analyses in the AAF/PHx model showed a specific expression of dlk in atypical ductular structures composed of oval cells. Delta-like protein was not observed in proliferating hepatocytes or bile duct cells after partial hepatectomy or ligation of the common bile duct whereas clusters of dlk immunoreactive oval cells were found in both the retrorsine and the AAF/PHx models. Finally, we used dlk to isolate alpha-fetoprotein-positive cells from fetal and adult regenerating rat liver by a novel antibody panning technique.
Proliferation and differentiation of hepatic stem cell progenies (i.e., oval cells) sustain liver regeneration when the replicative and functional capacity of hepatocytes is impaired. The signaling pathways that control stem cell activation remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the involvement of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in oval cell-mediated liver regeneration induced by 2-acetylaminofluorene/partial hepatectomy (AAF/PH) protocol. Using OV1 as a marker for identification and sorting of oval cells, we established that both NF-kappaB and STAT3 were highly activated in the OV1(+) cell population. Three distinct subpopulations of oval cells were defined as OV1(low), OV1(medium), and OV1(high), based on the intensity of OV1 staining. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that they represent different stages of oval cell differentiation along hepatocyte lineage. OV1(low) cells displayed the least differentiated phenotype as judged by high expression of c-kit and lack of hepatocytic differentiation markers, whereas OV1(high) cells lost c-kit expression, were more proliferative, and acquired more mature hepatocytic phenotype. Notably, NF-kappaB was activated uniformly in all three subpopulations of oval cells. In contrast, phosphorylation of STAT3 was detected only in OV1(high) cells. In conclusion, transcriptional activity supported by NF-kappaB and STAT3 is required for oval cell activation, expansion, and differentiation. The differential induction of NF-kappaB and STAT3 point to a distinct role for these transcription factors at different stages of hepatic stem cell differentiation.
Gene therapy of liver diseases would benefit from systems allowing prolonged, regulable, and tissue-specific transgene expression. We attempted to produce a vector fulfilling these requirements.
We generated gutless adenoviral vectors containing a mifepristone (RU486)-inducible system for controlled and liver-specific expression of human interleukin-12 (hIL-12) (GL-Ad/RUhIL-12) and mouse IL-12 (mIL-12) (GL-Ad/RUmIL-12). The properties of these vectors were tested both in vitro and in vivo.
Infection of cells with GL-Ad/RUhIL-12 resulted in high level of hIL-12 expression in the presence of RU486 only in hepatocytic cells. In animals injected with GL-Ad/RUhIL-12, the administration of RU486 induced a transient rise of serum hIL-12 that peaked at 10 hours and completely disappeared by 72 hours. The peak value of hIL-12 was dependent on the doses of the vector and the inducer. High and sustained serum levels of hIL-12 could be attained by continuing administration of RU486 every 12 or 24 hours. Repetitive induction of hIL-12 could be obtained over, at least, a period of 48 weeks after a single injection of GL-Ad/RUhIL-12. Although the vector was detected in many tissues after systemic injection, transcription of the transgene was only found in the liver. Treatment of liver metastases with 5 x 10(8) infectious units of GL-Ad/RUmIL-12 plus RU846 resulted in complete tumor regression in all animals.
Gutless adenoviral vectors allow liver-specific and regulable transgene expression for prolonged periods of time. These vectors are promising tools for gene therapy of liver cancer and could also be useful for other forms of hepatic disease.
Interpatient heterogeneity of hepatocellular carcinoma has been in-depth addressed. Intrapatient heterogeneity is less known. Four clones were freshly isolated from an Edmondson grade I HCV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma. Biochemical approaches, functional assays and cytogenetics were used. Albumin inducibility was uncoupled from canonical cytokeratin profiles, suggesting pathological combinations of hepatospecific and biliary markers. Poor differentiation and TGFβ's proproliferative effect on all clones were observed. TGFβ, Interferon α and doxorubicin sensitivity levels were found highly heterogeneous. Progenitor and stem cells markers OV6 and EpCAM were mutually exclusively expressed. All clones were CD44+, while none expressed CD90, CD133, or CD117. Three clones displayed a liver progenitor OV6+ phenotype, and were susceptible to hepatocytic differentiation, among which one fibroblastoid clone displayed intrahepatic parenchymal engraftment capability. A fourth clone, the less motile, displayed a cancer stem cell EpCAM+ phenotype, was essentially β-catenin negative, and was as expected devoid of hepatocytic differentiation capability, yet the most sensitive to doxorubicin treatment. Cytogenetics evidenced in all clones a t(12;22)(p11;q11) translocation found in several myelodysplastic syndromes. All clones, that probably derive from EpCAM+ tumor cells, display aberrant E-cadherin cytosolic localization. Because of their diverse pathophysiolocal features, these freshly isolated, low population doubling-defined, HCC clones may provide novel opportunities to tackle HCC heterogeneity in a single patient background for therapy improvement purposes, especially regarding recently developed targeted strategies.
In response to viral infection, the host induces over 300 IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which are the central component of intracellular antiviral innate immunity. Inefficient induction of ISGs contributes to poor control and persistence of hepatitis C virus infection. Therefore, further understanding of the hepatocytic ISG regulation machinery will guide us to an improved management strategy against hepatitis C virus infection. In this study, comprehensive genome-wide, high-throughput cDNA screening for genes regulating ISG expression identified a tyrosine kinase nonreceptor 1 (TNK1) as a unique player in the ISG induction pathway. The immune-modulatory function of TNK1 has never been studied, and this study characterizes its significance in antiviral innate immunity. TNK1 is abundantly expressed in hepatocytes and maintains basal ISG expression. More importantly, TNK1 plays a critical role in type I IFN-mediated ISG induction. We discovered that the activated IFN receptor complex recruits TNK1 from the cytoplasm. TNK1 is then phosphorylated to enhance its kinase activity. The activated TNK1 potentiates JAK-STAT signaling through dual phosphorylation of STAT1 at tyrosine 701 and serine 727 amino acid positions. Our loss-of-function approach demonstrated that TNK1 governs a cluster of ISG expression that defines the TNK1 pathway effector genes. More importantly, TNK1 abundance is inversely correlated to viral replication efficiency and is also a determinant factor for the hepatocytic response to antiviral treatment. Taken together, our studies found a critical but unidentified integrated component of the IFN-JAK-STAT signaling cascade. 
Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, type I receptor (TβRI) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) phosphorylate Smad3 differentially to create 2 isoforms phosphorylated (p) at the COOH-terminus (C) or at the linker region (L) and regulate hepatocytic fibrocarcinogenesis. This study aimed to compare the differences between how hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection affected hepatocytic Smad3 phosphorylated isoforms before and after anti-viral therapy. To clarify the relationship between Smad3 phosphorylation and liver disease progression, we studied 10 random patients in each stage of HBV-related fibrotic liver disease (F1-4) and also 10 patients with HBV-associated HCC. To examine changes in phosphorylated Smad3 signalling before and after anti-HBV therapies, we chose 27 patients with chronic hepatitis B who underwent baseline and follow-up biopsies at 52 weeks from the start of nucleoside analogue treatments (Lamivudine 100 mg daily or Telbivudine 600 mg daily). Fibrosis stage, inflammatory activity and phosphorylated Smad3 positivity in the paired biopsy samples were compared. Hepatocytic pSmad3C signalling shifted to fibrocarcinogenic pSmad3L signalling as the livers progressed from chronic hepatitis B infection to HCC. After nucleoside analogue treatment, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and HBV-DNA levels in 27 patients with HBV-related chronic liver diseases were decreased dramatically. Decrease in HBV-DNA restored pSmad3C signalling in hepatocytes, while eliminating prior fibrocarcinogenic pSmad3L signalling. Oral nucleoside analogue therapies can suppress fibrosis and reduce HCC incidence by successfully reversing phosphorylated Smad3 signalling; even liver disease progressed to cirrhosis in chronic hepatitis B patients. 
The Notch signaling pathway is involved in liver development and regeneration. Here, we investigate the role of the 4 mammalian Notch paralogs in the regulation of hepatoblast proliferation and hepatocytic differentiation. Our model is based on bipotential mouse embryonic liver (BMEL) progenitors that can differentiate into hepatocytes or cholangiocytes in vitro and in vivo. BMEL cells were subjected to Notch antagonists or agonists. Blocking Notch activation with a γ-secretase inhibitor, at 50 μM for 48 h, reduced cell growth by 50%. S-phase entry was impaired, but no apoptosis was induced. A systematic paralog-specific strategy was set using lentiviral transduction with constitutively active forms of each Notch receptor along with inhibition of endogenous Notch signaling. This assay demonstrates that proliferation of BMEL cells requires Notch2 and Notch4 activity, resulting in significant down-regulation of p27(Kip1) and p57(Kip2) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. Conversely, Notch3-expressing cells proliferate less and express 3-fold higher levels of p57(Kip2). The Notch3 cells present a hepatocyte-like morphology, enhanced multinucleation, and a ploidy shift. Moreover, Notch3 activity is conducive to hepatocytic differentiation in vitro, while its paralogs impede this fate. Our study provides the first evidence of a functional diversity among the mammalian Notch homologues in the proliferation and hepatocytic-lineage commitment of liver progenitors.
In developing organs, epithelial tissue structures are mostly developed by the perinatal period. However, it is unknown whether epithelial cells are already functionally mature and whether they are fixed in their lineage. Here we show that epithelial cells alter their plasticity during postnatal development by examining the differentiation potential of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)(+) cholangiocytes (biliary epithelial cells) isolated from neonatal and adult mouse livers. We found that neonatal cholangiocytes isolated from 1-week-old liver converted into functional hepatocytes in the presence of oncostatin M and Matrigel®. In contrast, neither morphological changes nor expression of hepatocyte markers were induced in adult cholangiocytes. The transcription factors hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα), which are necessary for hepatocytic differentiation, were induced in neonatal cholangiocytes but not in adult cells, whereas grainyhead-like 2 (Grhl2) and hairy-enhance of slit 1 (Hes1), which are implicated in cholangiocyte differentiation, were continuously expressed in adult cells. Overexpression of C/EBPα and Grhl2 promoted and inhibited hepatocytic differentiation, respectively. Furthermore, adult cholangiocytes formed a monolayer with higher barrier function than neonatal ones did, suggesting that cholangiocytes are still in the process of epithelial maturation even after forming tubular structures during the neonatal period. Taken together, these results suggest that cholangiocytes lose plasticity to convert into hepatocytes during epithelial maturation. They lose competency to upregulate hepatocytic transcription factors and downregulate cholagiocytic ones under conditions inducing hepatocytic differentiation. Our results suggest that a molecular machinery augmenting epithelial integrity limits lineage plasticity of epithelial cells.
The liver, being the major site of iron storage, is particularly exposed to the toxic effects of iron. Transcription factor NRF2 is critical for protecting the liver against disease by activating the transcription of genes encoding detoxification/antioxidant enzymes. We aimed to determine if the NRF2 pathway plays a significant role in the protection against hepatic iron overload.
Wild-type and Nrf2(-/-) mouse primary hepatocytes were incubated with ferric ammonium citrate. Wild-type and Nrf2(-/-) mice were fed standard rodent chow or iron-rich diet for 2weeks, with or without daily injection of the antioxidant mito-TEMPOL.
In mouse hepatocytes, iron induced the nuclear translocation of NRF2 and the expression of cytoprotective genes in an NRF2-dependent manner. Moreover, Nrf2(-/-) hepatocytes were highly susceptible to iron-induced cell death. Wild-type and Nrf2(-/-) mice fed iron-rich diet accumulated similar amounts of iron in the liver and were equally able to increase the expression of hepatic hepcidin and ferritin. Nevertheless, in Nrf2-null mice the iron loading resulted in progressive liver injury, ranging from mild confluent necrosis to severe necroinflammatory lesions. Hepatocytic cell death was associated with gross ultrastructural damage to the mitochondria. Notably, liver injury was prevented in iron-fed animals that received mito-TEMPOL.
NRF2 protects the mouse liver against the toxicity of dietary iron overload by preventing hepatocytic cell death. We identify NRF2 as a potential modifier of liver disease in iron overload pathology and show the beneficial effect of the antioxidant mito-TEMPOL in a mouse model of dietary iron-induced liver injury.
Hepatoblasts, hepatic stem/progenitor cells in liver development, have a high proliferative potential and the ability to differentiate into both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. In regenerative medicine and drug screening for the treatment of severe liver diseases, human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived mature functional hepatocytes are considered to be a potentially good cell source. However, induction of proliferation of these cells is difficult ex vivo. To circumvent this problem, we generated hepatic progenitor-like cells from human iPS cells using serial cytokine treatments in vitro. Highly proliferative hepatic progenitor-like cells were purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using antibodies against CD13 and CD133 that are known cell surface markers of hepatic stem/progenitor cells in fetal and adult mouse livers. When the purified CD13(high)CD133(+) cells were cultured at a low density with feeder cells in the presence of suitable growth factors and signaling inhibitors (ALK inhibitor A-83-01 and ROCK inhibitor Y-27632), individual cells gave rise to relatively large colonies. These colonies consisted of two types of cells expressing hepatocytic marker genes (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α and α-fetoprotein) and a cholangiocytic marker gene (cytokeratin 7), and continued to proliferate over long periods of time. In a spheroid formation assay, these cells were found to express genes required for mature liver function, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes, and secrete albumin. When these cells were cultured in a suitable extracellular matrix gel, they eventually formed a cholangiocytic cyst-like structure with epithelial polarity, suggesting that human iPS cell-derived hepatic progenitor-like cells have a bipotent differentiation ability. Collectively these data indicate that this novel procedure using an in vitro expansion system is useful for not only liver regeneration but also for the determination of molecular mechanisms that regulate liver development. 
Recent studies have demonstrated direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into a range of somatic cell types, but to date stem or progenitor cells have only been reprogrammed for the blood and neuronal lineages. We previously reported generation of induced hepatocyte-like (iHep) cells by transduction of Gata4, Hnf1α, and Foxa3 in p19 Arf null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Here, we show that Hnf1β and Foxa3, liver organogenesis transcription factors, are sufficient to reprogram MEFs into induced hepatic stem cells (iHepSCs). iHepSCs can be stably expanded in vitro and possess the potential of bidirectional differentiation into both hepatocytic and cholangiocytic lineages. In the injured liver of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (Fah)-deficient mice, repopulating iHepSCs become hepatocyte-like cells. They also engraft as cholangiocytes into bile ducts of mice with DDC-induced bile ductular injury. Lineage conversion into bipotential expandable iHepSCs provides a strategy to enable efficient derivation of both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes for use in disease modeling and tissue engineering. 
Considerable progress has been made in developing antifibrotic agents and other strategies to treat liver fibrosis; however, significant long-term restoration of functional liver mass has not yet been achieved. Therefore, we investigated whether transplanted hepatic stem/progenitor cells can effectively repopulate the liver with advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis. Stem/progenitor cells derived from fetal livers or mature hepatocytes from DPPIV(+) F344 rats were transplanted into DPPIV(-) rats with thioacetamide (TAA)-induced fibrosis/cirrhosis; rats were sacrificed 1, 2, or 4 months later. Liver tissues were analyzed by histochemistry, hydroxyproline determination, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and immunohistochemistry. After chronic TAA administration, DPPIV(-) F344 rats exhibited progressive fibrosis, cirrhosis, and severe hepatocyte damage. Besides stellate cell activation, increased numbers of stem/progenitor cells (Dlk-1(+), AFP(+), CD133(+), Sox-9(+), FoxJ1(+)) were observed. In conjunction with partial hepatectomy (PH), transplanted stem/progenitor cells engrafted, proliferated competitively compared to host hepatocytes, differentiated into hepatocytic and biliary epithelial cells, and generated new liver mass with extensive long-term liver repopulation (40.8 ± 10.3%). Remarkably, more than 20% liver repopulation was achieved in the absence of PH, associated with reduced fibrogenic activity (e.g., expression of alpha smooth muscle actin, platelet-derived growth factor receptor β, desmin, vimentin, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1) and fibrosis (reduced collagen). Furthermore, hepatocytes can also replace liver mass with advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, but to a lesser extent than fetal liver stem/progenitor cells.
This study is a proof of principle demonstration that transplanted epithelial stem/progenitor cells can restore injured parenchyma in a liver environment with advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis and exhibit antifibrotic effects.
The sandwich-cultured hepatocyte (SCH) model has become an invaluable in vitro tool for studying hepatic drug transport, metabolism, biliary excretion and toxicity. The relevant expression of many hepatocyte-specific functions together with the in vivo-like morphology favor SCHs over other preclinical models for evaluating hepatobiliary drug disposition and drug-induced hepatotoxicity.
In this review, the authors highlight recommended procedures required for reproducibly culturing hepatocytes in sandwich configuration. It also provides an overview of the SCH model characteristics as a function of culture time. Lastly, the article presents a summary of the most prominent applications of the SCH model, including hepatic drug clearance prediction, drug-drug interaction potential and drug-induced hepatotoxicity.
When human (cryopreserved) hepatocytes are used to establish sandwich cultures, the model appears particularly valuable to quantitatively investigate clinically relevant mechanisms related to in vivo hepatobiliary drug disposition and hepatotoxicity. Nonetheless, the SCH model would largely benefit from better insight into the fundamental cell signaling mechanisms that are critical for long-term in vitro maintenance of the hepatocytic phenotype. Studies systematically exploring improved cell culture conditions (e.g., co-cultures or extracellular matrix modifications), as well as in vitro work identifying key transcription factors involved in hepatocyte differentiation are currently emerging.
To investigate how cholesterol induces hepatocytic steatosis, we investigated the effect of cholesterol on hepatic lipogenesis and the assembly and secretion of very-low-density lipoprotein-triglycerides (VLDL-TGs) in goose primary hepatocytes. We found that cholesterol at 20 μg/ml increased the concentrations of extracellular VLDL, intracellular cholesterol, and intracellular TGs, while cholesterol at 30 μg/ml had a reduced effect (p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, cholesterol at 20 μg/ml, but not at 10 or 30 μg/ml, increased the extracellular TG concentration. Cholesterol increased the fatty acid synthase (FAS) enzyme activity in a dose-dependent manner. Incubation with cholesterol increased the mRNA level of genes involved in lipogenesis, including sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), FAS, acetyl-CoA carboxylase-α (ACCα), and liver X receptors. The mRNA level of the acyl-CoA: diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) gene changed in response to cholesterol treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Similar to the regulation of extracellular VLDL and intracellular TG accumulation, the mRNA levels of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, forkhead box O1, and DGAT2 increased with treatment with 10 or 20 μg/ml of cholesterol, but decreased with treatment with 30 μg/ml of cholesterol (p &lt; 0.05). Cholesterol had no evident effect on the mRNA level of the apolipoprotein B gene. Incubation with cholesterol at 20 and 30 μg/ml increased the nuclear SREBP-1 protein level (p &lt; 0.05) and the binding affinity of the nuclear SREBP-1 to ACCα SRE probes. In conclusion, cholesterol not only activates the transcription of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis and TG accumulation, but also activates the transcription of genes involved in the assembly and secretion of VLDL-TG in goose primary hepatocytes.
We previously showed that mature hepatocytes could transdifferentiate into bile ductular cells when placed in a collagen-rich microenvironment. To explore the mechanism of transdifferentiation, we examined whether inflammatory cytokines affected the phenotype of hepatocytes in a three-dimensional culture system. Spheroidal aggregates of rat hepatocytes were embedded within a type I collagen gel matrix and cultured in the presence of various cytokines. In the control, hepatocytes gradually lost expression of albumin, tyrosine aminotransferase, and hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4α, while aberrantly expressed bile ductular markers, including cytokeratin 19 (CK 19) and spermatogenic immunoglobulin superfamily (SgIGSF). Among the cytokines examined, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibited expression of albumin and HNF-4α, both at mRNA and protein levels. After culturing for 2 weeks with TNF-α, hepatocytic spheroids were transformed into extensively branching tubular structures composed of CK 19- and SgIGSF-positive small cuboidal cells. These cells responded to secretin with an increase in secretion and expressed functional bile duct markers. TNF-α also induced the phosphorylation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and c-Jun, and the morphogenesis was inhibited by SP600125, a specific JNK inhibitor. Furthermore, in chronic rat liver injury induced by CCl(4) , ductular reaction in the centrilobular area demonstrated strong nuclear staining of phosphorylated c-Jun. Our results demonstrate that TNF-α promotes the ductular transdifferentiation of hepatocytes and suggest a role of TNF-α in the pathogenesis of ductular reaction.
We previously demonstrated that mature rat hepatocytes transdifferentiate to bile ductular cells when cultured in a three-dimensional collagen-rich matrix. Here, we show that the phenotype of transdifferentiated hepatocytes can be reversed by modulating culture conditions. Spheroidal aggregates of hepatocytes were cultured within a collagen gel matrix in the presence of serum and tumor necrosis factor-α. Spheroids transformed into ductular structures composed of small cuboidal cells, lost the expression of hepatocytic markers, whereas aberrantly expressed bile ductular markers. The transdifferentiated cells were then retrieved from the gels, plated on surfaces coated with a basement membrane-like material, and cultured in serum-free media. Cells spontaneously formed spheroidal aggregates and recovered hepatocytic phenotype. Dexamethasone (Dex), which suppressed the phosphorylation of ERK and Jun N-terminal kinase, facilitated the recovery, and the combination with interleukin-6 or oncostatin M resulted in the recovery of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 α protein expression and the typical hepatocytic morphology, and a decrease in the expression of bile ductular markers. A cDNA microarray analysis revealed that the hepatocyte-specific mRNA expression profile was recovered in these cells. Our results demonstrate that hepatocytes are able to recover their phenotypes following bile ductular transdifferentiation, suggesting that hepatocytic and bile ductular phenotypes may be mutually reversible.
Iron is an essential micronutrient for human beings but its overload induces various diseases of liver, the main body storage site for iron, such as liver fibrosis. Curcumin is a natural polyphenol derived from turmeric and has been used widely. Its pharmacological action has attracted great attention in recent years. The apoptosis of rat cultured hepatocytes was induced by FeNTA (ferric nitrilotriacetate)-induced Iron overload. The present study was to examine the effect of curcumin at low concentrations on FeNTA-induced apoptosis of hepatocytes and elucidate the underlying mechanisms.
After the incubation of hepatocytes with 100 µmol/L FeNTA in the presence or absence of 1 - 10 µmmol/L of curcumin, a series of analyses were performed, including the analyses of hepatocytic apoptosis, the expressions of proteins relating with the regulations of cell apoptosis, caspase-3 activity, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nuclear factor NF-κB activity.
Curcumin reduced the FeNTA-induced hepatocytic apoptosis by 46.65% and significantly down-regulated the protein levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. In contrast, it had no effect on the protein levels of Bax and Bad. The curcumin treatment reduced FeNTA-caused production of ROS and caspase-3 activity by 45.01% and 59.71% respectively. And the NF-κB activity was also inhibited.
Curcumin at low concentrations reduces iron overload-caused hepatocytic apoptosis and NF-κB activity, the key regulatory transcription factor for the inflammation-related gene expression in cultured hepatocyte.
Viral and cellular oncogenes are well known to enhance rRNA synthesis, leading to increased ribosome biogenesis and cell proliferation. Our study on the molecular underpinnings of the interaction between viral HBx and c-Myc, which is implicated in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, showed a marked increase in the biosynthesis of rRNA, ribosomes and protein in hepatoma cells. A profound alteration in the nucleolar morphology and biochemical content of these cells was also observed. Increased biosynthetic activity was associated with increased cell proliferation and transformation of immortalized human hepatocytes. Furthermore, inhibition of RNA polymerase III activity impaired the proliferative advantage of hepatoma cells and transformation of immortalized hepatocytes as effectively as cisplatin treatment. These findings were corroborated in a transgenic HBx-myc microenvironment, in which an elevated hepatic level of rRNA was associated with conspicuous morphological and biochemical changes in the hepatocytic nucleoli. Thus, HBx and c-Myc seem to work cooperatively to support ribosome biogenesis and cellular transformation.
Glycolipids have been shown to serve specialized functions in cell signalling, proliferation and differentiation processes, which are all important during liver regeneration. We previously generated beta-glucosidase 2 (GBA2) knockout mice that accumulate the glycolipid glucosylceramide in various tissues, including the liver. The present study addressed the role of GBA2-deficiency and subsequent glucosylceramide accumulation in liver regeneration.
Gba2 knockout and wild-type mice were subjected to two-third partial hepatectomy. Mice were sacrificed at different time points, blood was collected, and the remnant liver was removed. Glucosylceramide and ceramide were quantified using mass spectrometry from whole liver and isolated hepatocytes. Serum and hepatocytic supernatant of IL-6, TNF-α and TGF-β levels were measured using ELISA. Cell signalling proteins were analysed using immunoblots.
Regenerating liver after partial hepatectomy showed a significant increase of hepatic glucosylceramide in GBA2-deficient mice compared to controls. Accumulation of glucosylceramide was associated with a delay in liver regeneration and reduced serum levels of IL-6 and TNF-α. Furthermore, reduced IL-6 led to decreased expression of the phosphorylated form of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (P-STAT3).
We conclude that increased glucosylceramide affects cytokine- and growth factor-mediated signalling pathways during liver regeneration. Thus, the repression of IL-6/STAT3 signalling pathway seems to be one of the mechanisms for the delay of liver regeneration in GBA2-deficient mice.
Intrahepatic malignant tumours include hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC), cholangiocarcinomas (CC) and combined hepatocholangiocarcinomas (cHCC-CC), a group of rare and poorly characterized tumours that exhibit both biliary and hepatocytic differentiation. The aim of the study was to characterize the molecular pathways specifically associated with cHCC-CC pathogenesis. We performed a genome-wide transcriptional analysis of 20 histologically defined cHCC-CC and compared them with a series of typical HCC and of CC. Data were analysed by gene set enrichment and integrative genomics and results were further validated in situ by tissue microarray using an independent series of 152 tumours. We report that cHCC-CC exhibit stem/progenitor features, a down-regulation of the hepatocyte differentiation program and a commitment to the biliary lineage. TGFβ and Wnt/β-catenin were identified as the two major signalling pathways activated in cHCC-CC. A β-catenin signature distinct from that observed in well-differentiated HCC with mutant β-catenin was found in cHCC-CC. This signature was associated with microenvironment remodelling and TGFβ activation. Furthermore, integrative genomics revealed that cHCC-CC share characteristics of poorly differentiated HCC with stem cell traits and poor prognosis. The common traits displayed by CC, cHCC-CC and some HCC suggest that these tumours could originate from stem/progenitor cell(s) and raised the hypothesis of a potential continuum between intrahepatic CC, cHCC-CC and poorly differentiated HCC.
Recent studies suggested that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) retain a residual donor cell gene expression, which may impact their capacity to differentiate into cell of origin. Here, we addressed a contribution of a lineage stage-specific donor cell memory in modulating the functional properties of iPSCs. iPSCs were generated from hepatic lineage cells at an early (hepatoblast-derived, HB-iPSCs) and end stage (adult hepatocyte, AH-iPSCs) of hepatocyte differentiation as well as from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs-iPSCs) using a lentiviral vector encoding four pluripotency-inducing factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. All resulting iPSC lines acquired iPSCs phenotype as judged by the accepted criteria including morphology, expression of pluripotency markers, silencing of transducing factors, capacity of multilineage differentiation in teratoma assay, and normal diploid karyotype. However, HB-iPSCs were more efficient in directed differentiation toward hepatocytic lineage as compared to AH-iPSCs, MEF-iPSCs, or mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Extensive comparative transcriptome analyses of the early passage iPSCs, donor cells, and mESCs revealed that despite global similarities in gene expression patterns between generated iPSCs and mESCs, HB-iPSCs retained a transcriptional memory (seven upregulated and 17 downregulated genes) typical of the original cells. Continuous passaging of HB-iPSCs erased most of these differences including a superior capacity for hepatic redifferentiation. These results suggest that retention of lineage stage-specific donor memory in iPSCs may facilitate differentiation into donor cell type. The identified gene set may help to improve hepatic differentiation for therapeutic applications and contribute to the better understanding of liver development.
Progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) often leads to vascular invasion and intrahepatic metastasis, which correlate with recurrence after surgical treatment and poor prognosis. HCC may be an unusual cancer affected by continuous inflammation that can lead to consistent upregulation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). Chronic inflammation shifts hepatocytic TGF-beta signaling from the tumor-suppressive pSmad3C pathway to the oncogenic pSmad3L pathway. In this study, we investigated the functional roles of Smad3 and its phosphoisoforms in the progression of HCC.
Tumor tissue microarrays of samples from 272 HCC patients who underwent curative surgical resection were used to detect the expression of Smad3, Smad4, pSmad3C (S423/425), pSmad3L (T179), pSmad3L (S204), and pSmad3L (S213). Disease-specific death was defined as 1) tumor occupying more than 80% of the liver, 2) portal venous tumor thrombus (PVTT) proximal to the second bifurcation, 3) obstructive jaundice due to tumor, 4) distant metastases, or 5) variceal hemorrhage with PVTT proximal to the first bifurcation. At the time of analysis, tumor recurrence was detected in 184 (67.6%) patients, and 96 (35.3%) had died of HCC.
Nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of Smad3, and nuclear localization of Smad4 were observed in 18.0%, 9.9%, and 9.2% of HCCs, respectively. The rates of Smad3 phosphoisoform-immunoreactive HCC varied according to the location of phosphorylation: pSmad3C (S423/425) 8.1%, pSmad3L (T179) 2.6%, pSmad3L (S204) 2.2%, and pSmad3L (S213) 10.3%. Multivariate analyses revealed that pSmad3C (S423/425) (P=0.022) was an independent predictor of longer recurrence-free survival. pSmad3L (S213) (P=0.006), intrahepatic metastasis, multicentric occurrence, and liver cirrhosis were independent predictors of shorter recurrence-free survival. Cytoplasmic Smad3 (P=0.006), larger tumor size, and intrahepatic metastasis were independent predictors of shorter disease-specific survival. Only pSmad3L (S213) did not show an unfavorable influence on recurrence-free survival (P=0.331) on univariate analysis.
pSmad3C (S423/425), pSmad3L (S213), and Smad3 may be predictors of prognosis in HCC patients after curative hepatectomy. pSmad3C (S423/425) and pSmad3L (S213) may be used as immunohistochemical biomarkers to identify patients with a high risk of recurrence.
In the present study we have investigated the properties of a novel cell line (3A cells) obtained from the liver of 14.5 days post coitum (dpc) wild-type mouse embryo. 3A cells morphology was characterized by fluorescent localization of F-actin and β-catenin. The expression of specific genes and proteins essential to liver function in these cells was comparable or even more efficient then in the differentiated hepatocytic cell line MMH-D6. 3A cells also showed the capability to excrete molecules in extracellular spaces resembling functional bile canaliculi, glycogen storage activity and the ability to control retinol-binding protein 4 secretion in response to retinol deprivation. Their response to the exogenous stress stimulus induced by tunicamycin was analysed by PCR Pathway Array containing 84 genes involved in the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). 3A cells were shown to activate the UPR following a typical stressful event, indicating that this cellular model could be further exploited to investigate hepatic proteins secretion and specific reaction to different injuries.
Hyperbilirubinemia is common during critical illness and is associated with adverse outcome. Whether hyperbilirubinemia reflects intensive care unit (ICU) cholestasis is unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze hyperbilirubinemia in conjunction with serum bile acids (BAs) and the key steps in BA synthesis, transport, and regulation by nuclear receptors (NRs). Serum BA and bilirubin levels were determined in 130 ICU and 20 control patients. In liver biopsies messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of BA synthesis enzymes, BA transporters, and NRs was assessed. In a subset (40 ICU / 10 controls) immunohistochemical staining of the transporters and receptors together with a histological evaluation of cholestasis was performed. BA levels were much more elevated than bilirubin in ICU patients. Conjugated cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) were elevated, with an increased CA/CDCA ratio. Unconjugated BA did not differ between controls and patients. Despite elevated serum BA levels, CYP7A1 protein, the rate-limiting enzyme in BA synthesis, was not lowered in ICU patients. Also, protein expression of the apical bile salt export pump (BSEP) was decreased, whereas multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) 3 was strongly increased at the basolateral side. This reversal of BA transport toward the sinusoidal blood compartment is in line with the increased serum conjugated BA levels. Immunostaining showed marked down-regulation of nuclear farnesoid X receptor, retinoid X receptor alpha, constitutive androstane receptor, and pregnane X receptor nuclear protein levels.
Failure to inhibit BA synthesis, up-regulate canalicular BA export, and localize pivotal NR in the hepatocytic nuclei may indicate dysfunctional feedback regulation by increased BA levels. Alternatively, critical illness may result in maintained BA synthesis (CYP7A1), reversal of normal BA transport (BSEP/MRP3), and inhibition of the BA sensor (FXR/RXRα) to increase serum BA levels.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common primary malignant tumor of the liver, often associated with the dysregulation of transcriptional pathways involved in cell growth and differentiation. The hematopoietically expressed homeobox protein (Hhex) is an important transcription factor throughout liver development and is essential to liver bud formation and hepatoblast differentiation. Here, we report a relationship between Hhex expression and HCC. First, adenovirus-mediated Hhex delivery into the hepatoma cell line, Hepa1-6, resulted in decreased expression of several proto-oncogenes (c-Jun and Bcl2), increased expression of some tumor suppressor genes (P53 and Rb), and enhanced expression of a cluster of hepatocytic and bile ductular markers. Second, Hhex expression significantly attenuated Hepa1-6 tumorigenicity in nude mice. Third, we report a correlation between Hhex expression and the differentiation state of human HCC. In 24 cases of clinical specimens, there was a significant difference in Hhex expression between poorly differentiated HCC and well-differentiated HCC (P &lt; 0.001). Taken together, these results indicate that Hhex is a potential candidate molecular marker for HCC pathological evaluation, suggesting a need to evaluate Hhex as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) usually arises from hepatic fibrosis caused by chronic inflammation. In chronic liver damage, hepatic stellate cells undergo progressive activation to myofibroblasts (MFB), which are important extracellular-matrix-producing mesenchymal cells. Concomitantly, perturbation of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling by pro-inflammatory cytokines in the epithelial cells of the liver (hepatocytes) promotes both fibrogenesis and carcinogenesis (fibro-carcinogenesis). Insights into fibro-carcinogenic effects on chronically damaged hepatocytes have come from recent detailed analyses of the TGF-β signaling process. Smad proteins, which convey signals from TGF-β receptors to the nucleus, have intermediate linker regions between conserved Mad homology (MH) 1 and MH2 domains. TGF-β type I receptor and pro-inflammatory cytokine-activated kinases differentially phosphorylate Smad2 and Smad3 to create phosphoisoforms phosphorylated at the COOH-terminal, linker, or both (L/C) regions. After acute liver injury, TGF-β-mediated pSmad3C signaling terminates hepatocytic proliferation induced by the pro-inflammatory cytokine-mediated mitogenic pSmad3L pathway; TGF-β and pro-inflammatory cytokines synergistically enhance collagen synthesis by activated hepatic stellate cells via pSmad2L/C and pSmad3L/C pathways. During chronic liver disease progression, pre-neoplastic hepatocytes persistently affected by TGF-β together with pro-inflammatory cytokines come to exhibit the same carcinogenic (mitogenic) pSmad3L and fibrogenic pSmad2L/C signaling as do MFB, thereby accelerating liver fibrosis while increasing risk of HCC. This review of Smad phosphoisoform-mediated signals examines similarities and differences between epithelial and mesenchymal cells in acute and chronic liver injuries and considers Smad linker phosphorylation as a potential target for the chemoprevention of fibro-carcinogenesis.
rES (rhesus monkey embryonic stem) cells have similar characteristics to human ES (embryonic stem) cells, and might be useful as a substitute model for preclinical research. Before their clinical application, it is critical to understand the roles of factors that control the differentiation of ES cells into hepatocytes. Here, we analysed the effect of collagen gels on rES cells differentiation into hepatocytes by stepwise protocols. About 80% of DE (definitive endoderm) cells were generated from rES cells after being treated with activin A. The DE cells were then plated on to collagen gels or type I collagen-coated wells with growth factors to induce hepatocyte differentiation. In type I collagen systems, characteristics of immature hepatocytes were observed, including the expression of immature hepatic genes and the generation of 15±3% AFP (alpha fetoprotein)/CK (cytokeratin)18 double-positive cells. In collagen gel culture, differentiated cells exhibited typical hepatocyte morphology and expressed adult liver-specific genes. The mRNA expression of AFP (immature hepatic gene) was detected at day 11 but decreased at day 18. In contrast, mRNA expression of albumin (mature hepatic gene) was detected at day 11 and increased at day 18. Compared with type I collagen systems, significantly higher AFP/CK18 double-positive cells (68±7%) were produced in collagen gel culture. Furthermore, some differentiated cells acquired the hepatocytic function of glycogen storage. However, only immature hepatic genes were observed in collagen gel systems if growth factors were absent. Thus, collagen gels combined with hepatocyte-inducing growth factors efficiently promoted differentiation of hepatocytes from rES.
Under compromised biliary regeneration, transdifferentiation of hepatocytes into biliary epithelial cells (BEC) has been previously observed in rats, upon exposure to BEC-specific toxicant methylene dianiline (DAPM) followed by bile duct ligation (BDL), and in patients with chronic biliary liver disease. However, mechanisms promoting such transdifferentiation are not fully understood. In the present study, acquisition of biliary specific transcription factors by hepatocytes leading to reprogramming of BEC-specific cellular profile was investigated as a potential mechanism of transdifferentiation in two different models of compromised biliary regeneration in rats.
In addition to previously examined DAPM + BDL model, an experimental model resembling chronic biliary damage was established by repeated administration of DAPM. Hepatocyte to BEC transdifferentiation was tracked using dipetidyl dipeptidase IV (DDPIV) chimeric rats that normally carry DPPIV only in hepatocytes. Following DAPM treatment, ~20% BEC population turned DPPIV-positive, indicating that they are derived from DPPIV-positive hepatocytes. New ductules emerging after DAPM + BDL and repeated DAPM exposure expressed hepatocyte-associated transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 4α and biliary specific transcription factor HNF1β. In addition, periportal hepatocytes expressed biliary marker CK19 suggesting periportal hepatocytes as a potential source of transdifferentiating cells. Although TGFβ1 was induced, there was no considerable reduction in periportal HNF6 expression, as observed during embryonic biliary development.
Taken together, these findings indicate that gradual loss of HNF4α and acquisition of HNF1β by hepatocytes, as well as increase in TGFβ1 expression in periportal region, appear to be the underlying mechanisms of hepatocyte-to-BEC transdifferentiation.
Increasing evidence supports that modifications in the mitochondrial content, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity, and cell metabolism influence the fate of stem cells. However, the regulators involved in the crosstalk between mitochondria and stem cell fate remains poorly characterized. Here, we identified a transcriptional regulatory axis, composed of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) (a downstream effector of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, repressed during differentiation) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1α) (the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, induced during differentiation), coupling the loss of pluripotency and early commitment to differentiation, to the initiation of mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolic shift toward OXPHOS. PGC-1α induction during differentiation is required for both mitochondrial biogenesis and commitment to the hepatocytic lineage, and TCF7L2 repression is sufficient to increase PGC-1α expression, mitochondrial biogenesis and OXPHOS activity. We further demonstrate that OXPHOS activity is required for the differentiation toward the hepatocytic lineage, thus providing evidence that bi-directional interactions control stem cell differentiation and mitochondrial abundance and activity. Stem Cells 2017;35:2184-2197.
MYC activation at modest levels has been frequently found in hepatocellular carcinoma. However, its significance in hepatocarcinogenesis has remained obscure. Here we examined the role of Myc activation in mouse liver tumours induced by hepatocytic expression of myristoylated AKT (AKT) and/or mutant HRASV12 (HRAS) via transposon-mediated gene integration. AKT or HRAS alone required 5 months to induce liver tumours, whereas their combination generated hepatocellular carcinoma within 8 weeks. Co-introduction of AKT and HRAS induced lipid-laden preneoplastic cells that grew into nodules composed of tumour cells with or without intracytoplasmic lipid, with the latter being more proliferative and associated with spontaneous Myc expression. AKT/HRAS-induced tumorigenesis was almost completely abolished when MadMyc, a competitive Myc inhibitor, was expressed simultaneously. The Tet-On induction of MadMyc in preneoplastic cells significantly inhibited the progression of AKT/HRAS-induced tumours; its induction in transformed cells suppressed their proliferative activity with alterations in lipid metabolism and protein translation. Transposon-mediated Myc overexpression facilitated tumorigenesis by AKT or HRAS, and when it was co-introduced with AKT and HRAS, diffusely infiltrating tumours without lipid accumulation developed as early as 2 weeks. Examination of the dose-responses of Myc in the enhancement of AKT/HRAS-induced tumorigenesis revealed that a reduction to one-third retained enhancing effect but three-times greater introduction damped the process with increased apoptosis. Myc overexpression suppressed the mRNA expression of proteins involved in the synthesis of fatty acids, and when combined with HRAS introduction, it also suppressed the mRNA expression of proteins involved in their degradation. Finally, the MYC-positive human hepatocellular carcinoma was characterized by the cytoplasm devoid of lipid accumulation, prominent nucleoli and a higher proliferative activity. Our results demonstrate that in hepatocarcinogenesis induced by both activated AKT and HRAS, activation of endogenous Myc is an enhancing factor and adequate levels of Myc deregulation further facilitate the process with alterations in cellular metabolism.
Netrin-1, a multifunctional secreted protein, is up-regulated in cancer and inflammation. Netrin-1 blocks apoptosis induced by the prototypical dependence receptors deleted in colorectal carcinoma and uncoordinated phenotype-5. Although the unfolded protein response (UPR) triggers apoptosis on exposure to stress, it first attempts to restore endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis to foster cell survival. Importantly, UPR is implicated in chronic liver conditions including hepatic oncogenesis. Netrin-1's implication in cell survival on UPR in this context is unknown.
Isolation of translational complexes, determination of RNA secondary structures by selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation and primer extension/dimethyl sulfate, bicistronic constructs, as well as conventional cell biology and biochemistry approaches were used on in vitro-grown hepatocytic cells, wild-type, and netrin-1 transgenic mice.
HepaRG cells constitute a bona fide model for UPR studies in vitro through adequate activation of the 3 sensors of the UPR (protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK)), inositol requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α), and activated transcription factor 6 (ATF6). The netrin-1 messenger RNA 5'-end was shown to fold into a complex double pseudoknot and bear E-loop motifs, both of which are representative hallmarks of related internal ribosome entry site regions. Cap-independent translation of netrin 5' untranslated region-driven luciferase was observed on UPR in vitro. Unlike several structurally related oncogenic transcripts (l-myc, c-myc, c-myb), netrin-1 messenger RNA was selected for translation during UPR both in human hepatocytes and in mice livers. Depletion of netrin-1 during UPR induces apoptosis, leading to cell death through an uncoordinated phenotype-5A/C-mediated involvement of protein phosphatase 2A and death-associated protein kinase 1 in vitro and in netrin transgenic mice.
UPR-resistant, internal ribosome entry site-driven netrin-1 translation leads to the inhibition of uncoordinated phenotype-5/death-associated protein kinase 1-mediated apoptosis in the hepatic context during UPR, a hallmark of chronic liver disease.
α-1 Antitrypsin deficiency (A1ATD) can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma; however, not all patients are susceptible to severe liver disease. In A1ATD, a toxic gain-of-function mutation generates insoluble ATZ "globules" in hepatocytes, overwhelming protein clearance mechanisms. The relationship between bile acids and hepatocytic autophagy is less clear but may involve altered gene expression pathways. Based on previous findings that bile duct ligation (BDL) induces autophagy, we hypothesized that retained bile acids may have hepatoprotective effects in PiZZ transgenic mice, which model A1ATD. We performed BDL and partial BDL (pBDL) in PiZZ mice, followed by analysis of liver tissues. PiZZ liver subjected to BDL showed up to 50% clearance of ATZ globules, with increased expression of autophagy proteins. Analysis of transcription factors revealed significant changes. Surprisingly nuclear TFEB, a master regulator of autophagy, remained unchanged. pBDL confirmed that ATZ globule clearance was induced by localized stimuli rather than diet or systemic effects. Several genes involved in bile metabolism were overexpressed in globule-devoid hepatocytes, compared to globule-containing cells. Retained bile acids led to a dramatic reduction of ATZ globules, with enhanced hepatocyte regeneration and autophagy. These findings support investigation of synthetic bile acids as potential autophagy-enhancing agents.
The beneficial impact of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) on both acute and chronic liver diseases has been confirmed, although the molecular mechanisms behind it remain elusive. We aim to identify factors secreted by undifferentiated and hepatocytic differentiated MSC in vitro in order to delineate liver repair pathways potentially targeted by MSC.
Secreted factors were determined by protein arrays and related pathways identified by biomathematical analyses.
MSC from adipose tissue and bone marrow expressed a similar pattern of surface markers. After hepatocytic differentiation, CD54 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1, ICAM-1) increased and CD166 (activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule, ALCAM) decreased. MSC secreted different factors before and after differentiation. These comprised cytokines involved in innate immunity and growth factors regulating liver regeneration. Pathway analysis revealed cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, chemokine signalling pathways, the complement and coagulation cascades as well as the Januskinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor (NOD-like receptor) signalling pathways as relevant networks. Relationships to transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF1-α) signalling seemed also relevant.
MSC secreted proteins, which differed depending on cell source and degree of differentiation. The factors might address inflammatory and growth factor pathways as well as chemo-attraction and innate immunity. Since these are prone to dysregulation in most liver diseases, MSC release hepatotropic factors, potentially supporting liver regeneration.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is currently the most common chronic liver disease worldwide, characterized by excessive hepatic lipid accumulation without significant ethanol consumption. We have performed a screening for medicinal foods that inhibit hepatocytic lipid accumulation through activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is a critical regulator of the hepatic lipid metabolism.
We found that clove (Syzygium aromaticum), which is commonly used as a spice, markedly inhibits palmitate-inducible lipid accumulation in human HepG2 hepatocytes. Analyses of the clove extracts found that β-caryophyllene, an orally-active cannabinoid, is the principal suppressor of the lipid accumulation, and stimulates the phosphorylation of AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1). Our data also showed that β-caryophyllene prevents the translocation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) into the nucleus and forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) into the cytoplasm through AMPK signaling, and consequently, induces a significant downregulation of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and upregulation of adipose triglyceride lipase, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrated that the β-caryophyllene-induced activation of AMPK could be mediated by the cannabinoid type 2 receptor-dependent Ca2+ signaling pathway.
Our results suggest that β-caryophyllene has the potential efficacy in preventing and ameliorating nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and its associated metabolic disorders.
In the absence of an effective therapy against Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC), chemoprevention remains an important strategy to circumvent morbidity and mortality. Here, we examined chemopreventive potential of Acteoside (ACT), a plant derived phenylethanoid glycoside against an environmental and dietary carcinogen, diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced rat hepatocarcinogenesis. ACT treatment (0.1 and 0.3% supplemented with diet) started 2 weeks before DEN challenge and continued for 18 weeks thereafter, showed a remarkable chemopreventive activity. ACT treatment resulted in reduced HCC nodules. Histopathology showed progressive tissue damage, necrosis (5 weeks), hepatocytic injury (10 weeks), anisonucleosis with presence of prominent nucleoli, sinusidal dilations, and lymphomono nuclear inflammation (18 weeks). Biochemical analysis showed hepatocytic injury (raised ALT, p &lt; 0.001), inflammation [IL-6, IFN-γ (p &lt; 0.05), and TNF-α (p &lt; 0.001)], apoptosis [elevated Caspase-3 (p &lt; 0.001)]. ACT at 0.1 and 0.3% ameliorated DEN-induced pre-hepatocarcinogenic manifestations. Mechanistic studies of ACT chemoprevention was elucidated using Hep3B cells with an aim to develop an in vitro DEN-induced toxicity model. Hep3B was found to be a reliable and more sensitive towards DEN toxicity compared to HepG2 and HuH7 cells. ACT prevented DEN-induced cytotoxicity (p &lt; 0.001), DNA damage, and genotoxicity (micronuclei test, DNA ladder test, Hoechst staining, cell cycle analysis). ACT significantly (p &lt; 0.001) scavenged DEN-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and prevented mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) loss. Immunoblotting showed ACT treatment reversed DEN-induced NF-κB, Bax, Cytochrome C, Bcl-2, and Stat-3 levels. We conclude that chemoprotective effect of ACT is mediated by STAT-3 dependent regulation of oxidative stress and apoptosis and ACT has potential to be developed as a chemopreventive agent. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The increasing demand and hampered use of primary human hepatocytes for research purposes have urged scientists to search for alternative cell sources, such as immortalized hepatic cell lines. The aim of this study was to develop a human hepatic cell line using the combined overexpression of TERT and the cell cycle regulators cyclin D1 and mutant isoform CDK4R24C. Following transduction of adult human primary hepatocytes with the selected immortalization genes, cell growth was triggered and a cell line was established. When cultured under appropriate conditions, the cell line expressed several hepatocytic markers and liver-enriched transcription factors at the transcriptional and/or translational level, secreted liver-specific proteins and showed glycogen deposition. These results suggest that the immortalization strategy applied to primary human hepatocytes could generate a novel hepatic cell line that seems to retain some key hepatic characteristics. 
Cholesterol metabolism disorder in hepatocytes predicts a higher risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as critical players in cellular cholesterol metabolism, but their functions are not systematically clarified. Here, we have identified a novel lncRNA named lnc-HC negatively regulating cholesterol metabolism within hepatocytes through physical interaction with hnRNPA2B1. By further binding to the target messenger RNA of Cyp7a1 or Abca1, the lnc-HC-hnRNPA2B1 complex decreases expressions of the two genes that are implicated in cellular cholesterol excretion. lnc-HC knockdown can strongly recover the cholesterol disorder in vivo. In the upstream pathway, lnc-HC is up-regulated by high cholesterol by the transcription activator, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta.
These findings suggest a subtle feed-forward regulation of lnc-HC in cholesterol metabolism and define a novel line of evidence by which lncRNAs modulate the metabolic system at the post-transcriptional level. (Hepatology 2016;64:58-72).
The death rate from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increasing, and liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Most patients with HCC have underlying liver cirrhosis and compromised liver function, limiting treatment options. Cirrhosis is associated with cell dedifferentiation and expansion of hepatocholangiolar progenitor cells. We identified a microRNA signature associated with HCC and hepatocytic differentiation of progenitor cells. We further identified miR-148a as an inducer of hepatocytic differentiation that is down-regulated in HCC. MiR-148a-mimetic treatment in vivo suppressed tumor growth, reduced tumor malignancy and liver fibrosis, and prevented tumor development. These effects were associated with an increased differentiated phenotype and mediated by IκB kinase alpha/NUMB/NOTCH signaling.
miR-148a is an inhibitor of the IκB kinase alpha/NUMB/NOTCH pathway and an inducer of hepatocytic differentiation that when deregulated promotes HCC initiation and progression. Differentiation-targeted therapy may be a promising strategy to treat and prevent HCC.
Hepatic stem/progenitor cells, hepatoblasts, have a high proliferative ability and can differentiate into mature hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. Therefore, these cells are considered to be useful for regenerative medicine and drug screening for liver diseases. However, it is problem that in vitro maturation of hepatoblasts is insufficient in the present culture system. In this study, a novel regulator to induce hepatic differentiation was identified and the molecular function of this factor was examined in embryonic day 13 hepatoblast culture with maturation factor, oncostatin M and extracellular matrices. Overexpression of the basic helix-loop-helix type transcription factor, Mist1, induced expression of mature hepatocytic markers such as carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase1 and several cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes in this culture system. In contrast, Mist1 suppressed expression of cholangiocytic markers such as Sox9, Sox17, Ck19, and Grhl2. CYP3A metabolic activity was significantly induced by Mist1 in this hepatoblast culture. In addition, Mist1 induced liver-enriched transcription factors, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α and Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α, which are known to be involved in liver functions. These results suggest that Mist1 partially induces mature hepatocytic expression and function accompanied by the down-regulation of cholangiocytic markers. 
Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1beta (HNF-1B) is involved in the hepatobiliary specification of hepatoblasts to cholangiocytes during liver development, and is strongly expressed throughout adult biliary epithelium. The aim of this study was to examine the expression of HNF-1B in different pathologic subtypes of primary liver cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), and the relationship between HNF-1B expression, clinicopathological features and prognosis. We retrospectively investigated 2 cohorts of patients, including 183 HCCs and 69 ICCs. The expression of HNF-1B was examined by immunohistochemistry. We found that HNF-1B expression was associated with pathological subtype of primary tumor, and HNF-1B expression in HCC tissue may be associated with the change of phenotype on recurrence. The HNF-1B expression was positively correlated with biliary/HPC (hepatic progenitor cell) markers expression. Further, multivariable analysis showed that HNF-1B expression was an independent prognostic factor for both overall survival and disease-free survival of HCC patients. However, no correlation between HNF-1B expression and survival was found in ICC patients. In summary, HCC with high HNF-1B expression displayed biliary phenotype and tended to show poorer prognosis. HNF-1B-positive malignant cells could be bipotential cells and give rise to both hepatocytic and cholangiocytic lineages during tumorigenesis. 
Fetal hepatic stem/progenitor cells, hepatoblasts, are highly proliferative cells and the source of both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. In contrast, mature hepatocytes have a low proliferative potency and high metabolic functions. Cell proliferation is regulated by cell cycle-related molecules. However, the correlation between cell cycle regulation and hepatic maturation are still unknown. To address this issue, we revealed that the cell cycle inhibitor p57(Kip2) was expressed in the hepatoblasts and mesenchymal cells of fetal liver in a spatiotemporal manner. In addition, we found that hepatoblasts in p57(Kip2)-/- mice were highly proliferative and had deficient maturation compared with those in wild-type (WT) mice. However, there were no remarkable differences in the expression levels of cell cycle- and bipotency-related genes except for Ccnd2. Furthermore, p57(Kip2)-/- hepatoblasts could differentiate into mature hepatocytes in p57(Kip2)-/- and WT chimeric mice, suggesting that the intrinsic activity of p57(Kip2) does not simply regulate hepatoblast maturation. 
Human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs) have been touted as an ideal stem cell candidate, being ethically neutral, immunologically naïve, plentiful in origin, and retaining plasticity in its fetal stage. We hypothesized that by applying natural physiological signals of the developing liver, hAECs can be coaxed into becoming functional immunopermissive hepatocyte-like cells. These cells would have tremendous potential for allogenic cellular transplantation in the treatment of chronic liver insufficiency.
hAECs were obtained from term placentas and subjected to hepatic trans-differentiation. Hepatic differentiated cells were analyzed with immunophenotyping, electron microscopy, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction as well as characterized for hepatic metabolic function. In vivo efficacy was tested using intrasplenic transplantation into non-obese diabetic (NOD) Scid Gamma mice with thioacetamide-induced chronic liver failure and analyzed for engraftment and improvement in liver indices.
With hepatic differentiation, hAECs assumed a hepatocytic polygonal morphology with upregulation of transcription factors responsible for liver specification. These hepatic differentiated-hAECs (HD-AECs) demonstrated bile canaliculi formation, secreted albumin, eliminated indo-cyanine green, uptook low-density lipoprotein, and inducible CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 enzymatic activities. Transplantation of HD-AECs and de novo hAECs in mice model of cirrhosis showed successful in vivo engraftment and differentiation into functional hepatocytes positive for human-specific albumin. HD-AEC cells that had undergone hepatic differentiation showed the greatest improvement in albumin function while preserving human leukocyte antigen-G expression postdifferentiation.
hAECs were able to differentiate into functional hepatocyte-like cells both in vivo and in vitro. They showed therapeutic efficacy after transplantation in mice model of cirrhosis, offering an exciting source of cells for generation of functionally useful hepatocytes.
MicroRNA 122 (miR-122) is highly expressed in the liver where it influences diverse biological processes and pathways, including hepatitis C virus replication and metabolism of iron and cholesterol. It is processed from a long non-coding primary transcript (~7.5 kb) and the gene has two evolutionarily-conserved regions containing the pri-mir-122 promoter and pre-mir-122 hairpin region. Several groups reported that the widely-used hepatocytic cell line HepG2 had deficient expression of miR-122, previously ascribed to deletion of the pre-mir-122 stem-loop region. We aimed to characterise this deletion by direct sequencing of 6078 bp containing the pri-mir-122 promoter and pre-mir-122 stem-loop region in HepG2 and Huh-7, a control hepatocytic cell line reported to express miR-122, supported by sequence analysis of cloned genomic DNA. In contrast to previous findings, the entire sequence was present in both cell lines. Ten SNPs were heterozygous in HepG2 indicating that DNA was present in two copies. Three validation isolates of HepG2 were sequenced, showing identical genotype to the original in two, whereas the third was different. Investigation of promoter chromatin status by FAIRE showed that Huh-7 cells had 6.2 ± 0.19- and 2.7 ± 0.01- fold more accessible chromatin at the proximal (HNF4α-binding) and distal DR1 transcription factor sites, compared to HepG2 cells (p=0.03 and 0.001, respectively). This was substantiated by ENCODE genome annotations, which showed a DNAse I hypersensitive site in the pri-mir-122 promoter in Huh-7 that was absent in HepG2 cells. While the origin of the reported deletion is unclear, cell lines should be obtained from a reputable source and used at low passage number to avoid discrepant results. Deficiency of miR-122 expression in HepG2 cells may be related to a relative deficiency of accessible promoter chromatin in HepG2 versus Huh-7 cells. 
To investigate the relationship between the iron-metabolism-related gene expression profiles and efficacy of antiviral therapy in chronic hepatitis C patients.
The hepatic expression profile of iron-metabolism-related genes was analyzed and its association with virological response to pegylated-interferon plus ribavirin combination therapy was evaluated. A hundred patients with chronic hepatitis C (genotype1b, n = 50; genotype 2, n = 50) were enrolled and retrospectively analyzed. Liver biopsy samples were subjected to quantitative polymerase chain reaction for iron-metabolism-related genes and protein expression (Western blotting analysis) for ferroportin. As a control, normal liver tissue was obtained from 18 living donors of liver transplantation. Serum hepcidin level was measured by sensitive liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry.
Iron overload is associated with liver damage by increasing oxidative stress and hepatitis C virus (HCV) is reported to induce iron accumulation in hepatocytes in vivo. Conversely, iron administration suppresses HCV replication in vitro. Therefore, the association between HCV infection and iron metabolism remains unclear. Compared with controls, patients had significantly higher gene expression for transferrin, iron-regulatory proteins 1 and 2, divalent metal transporter 1, and ferroportin, but similar for transferrin receptors 1 and 2, and hepcidin. When the expression profiles were compared between sustained virological response (SVR) and non-SVR patients, the former showed significantly lower transcription and protein expression of hepcidin and ferroportin. Expression of hepcidin-regulating genes, BMPR1, BMPR2, and hemojuvelin, was significantly increased, whereas BMP2 was decreased in HCV-infected liver. BMPR2 and hemojuvelin expression was significantly lower in the SVR than non-SVR group. HCV infection affects the expression of iron-metabolism-related genes, leading to iron accumulation in hepatocytes.
Decreased expression of hepcidin and ferroportin in SVR patients indicates the importance of hepatocytic iron retention for viral response during pegylated-interferon plus ribavirin treatment.
Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a family of the major serine/threonine phosphatases in cells, regulates many aspects of physiological processes. However, isoform-specific substrates and the biological role of each specific member of the PP2A family remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated whether PP2A catalytic subunit Cα (PP2Acα) is involved in chronic hepatic injury and fibrosis. A hepatocyte-specific PP2Acα ablation mice model was established to examine the effect of PP2Acα on carbon tetrachloride- (CCl4-) induced chronic hepatic injury and fibrosis. Our results showed that PP2Acα knockout mice were less susceptible to chronic CCl4-induced liver injury as evidenced by lower levels of serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, decreased hepatocyte proliferation, and increased rate of apoptotic removal of the injured hepatocytes. PP2Acα knockout mice also displayed a lesser extent of liver fibrosis as a significant decrease in the proportion of α-smooth muscle actin-expressing cells and collagen deposition was observed in their liver tissues. Furthermore, the levels of serum TGF-β1 and hepatocytic Smad phosphorylation were reduced in the PP2Acα knockout mice. These data suggest that hepatocyte-specific ablation of PP2Acα protects against CCl4-induced chronic hepatic injury and fibrogenesis and the protective effect is mediated at least partially through the impaired TGF-β1/Smad signaling. 
Late fetal and adult livers are reported to contain bipotential liver stem/progenitor cells (LPCs), which share surface markers, including epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), with cholangiocytes and differentiate into both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. However, recent results do not necessarily support the idea that LPCs contribute significantly to cellular turnover and regeneration by supplying new hepatocytes. Here, we examined the colony-forming capability of EpCAM(+) cells isolated from mouse livers between E17 and 11 weeks of age. We found that the number of bipotential colonies was greatly reduced between 1 and 6 weeks, indicating that the number of LPCs decreases during postnatal development. Moreover, bipotential colonies derived from adult LPCs contained substantially fewer albumin(+) cells than those from neonatal LPCs. We further examined the differentiation potential of neonatal and adult LPCs by transplantation and found that neonatal cells differentiated into mature hepatocytes in recipient livers more frequently than adult LPCs. Since we previously reported that the transcription factor grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2) expressed in EpCAM(+) cells inhibits hepatocytic differentiation, we examined whether targets of GRHL2 might block hepatocytic differentiation. DNA and microRNA microarrays revealed that miR122, the expression of which correlates with hepatocytic differentiation, was greatly reduced in adult as compared with neonatal EpCAM(+) cells. Indeed, GRHL2 negatively regulates the promoter/enhancer activity of the Mir122 gene. Our results indicate that neonatal but not adult EpCAM(+) LPCs have great potential to produce albumin(+) hepatocytes. GRHL2 suppresses transcription of miR122 and thereby restricts the differentiation potential of adult LPCs.
Rodent cancer bioassays indicate that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) agonist, 2,3,7,8-tetracholorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), causes increases in both hepatocytic and cholangiocytic tumors. Effects of AHR activation have been evaluated on rodent hepatic stem cells (rHpSCs) versus their descendants, hepatoblasts (rHBs), two lineage stages of multipotent, hepatic precursors with overlapping but also distinct phenotypic traits. This was made possible by defining the first successful culture conditions for ex vivo maintenance of rHpScs consisting of a substratum of hyaluronans and Kubota's medium (KM), a serum-free medium designed for endodermal stem/progenitor cells. Supplementation of KM with leukemia inhibitory factor elicited lineage restriction to rHBs. Cultures were treated with various AHR agonists including TCDD, 6-formylindolo-[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ), and 3-3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) and then analyzed with a combination of immunocytochemistry, gene expression, and high-content image analysis. The AHR agonists increased proliferation of rHpSCs at concentrations producing a persistent AHR activation as indicated by induction of Cyp1a1. By contrast, treatment with TCDD resulted in a rapid loss of viability of rHBs, even though the culture conditions, in the absence of the agonists, were permissive for survival and expansion of rHBs. The effects were not observed with FICZ and at lower concentrations of DIM.
Our findings are consistent with a lineage-dependent mode of action for AHR agonists in rodent liver tumorigenesis through selective expansion of rHpSCs in combination with a toxicity-induced loss of viability of rHBs. These lineage-dependent effects correlate with increased frequency of liver tumors.
The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development increases as hepatitis virus C (HCV)-related liver diseases progress, especially in patients with active inflammation. Insight into hepatic carcinogenesis have emerged from recent detailed analyses of transforming growth factor-β and c-Jun-N-terminal kinase signaling processes directed by multiple phosphorylated (phospho)-isoforms of a Smad3 mediator. In the course of HCV-related chronic liver diseases, chronic inflammation and host genetic/epigenetic alterations additively shift the hepatocytic Smad3 phospho-isoform signaling from tumor suppression to carcinogenesis, increasing the risk of HCC. Chronic inflammation represents an early carcinogenic step that provides a nonmutagenic tumor-promoting stimulus. After undergoing successful antiviral therapy, patients with chronic hepatitis C could experience a lower risk of HCC as Smad3 phospho-isoform signaling reverses from potential carcinogenesis to tumor suppression. Even after HCV clearance, however, patients with cirrhosis could still develop HCC because of sustained, intense carcinogenic Smad3 phospho-isoform signaling that is possibly caused by genetic or epigenetic alterations. Smad3 phospho-isoforms should assist with evaluating the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing human HCC. 
Cholangiocytes are biliary epithelial cells, which, like hepatocytes, originate from hepatoblasts during embryonic development. In this study we investigated the potential of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to differentiate into cholangiocytes and we report a new approach, which drives differentiation of hESCs toward the cholangiocytic lineage using feeder-free and defined culture conditions. After differentiation into hepatic progenitors, hESCs were differentiated further into cholangiocytes using growth hormone, epidermal growth factor, interleukin-6, and then sodium taurocholate. These conditions also allowed us to generate cholangiocytes from HepaRG-derived hepatoblasts. hESC- and HepaRG-derived cholangiocyte-like cells expressed markers of cholangiocytes including cytokeratin 7 and osteopontin, and the transcription factors SOX9 and hepatocyte nuclear factor 6. The cells also displayed specific proteins important for cholangiocyte functions including cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, secretin receptor, and nuclear receptors. They formed primary cilia and also responded to hormonal stimulation by increase of intracellular Ca(2+) . We demonstrated by integrative genomics that the expression of genes, which signed hESC- or HepaRG-cholangiocytes, separates hepatocytic lineage from cholangiocyte lineage. When grown in a 3D matrix, cholangiocytes developed epithelial/apicobasal polarity and formed functional cysts and biliary ducts. In addition, we showed that cholangiocyte-like cells could also be generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach with stem/progenitor cells of diverse origins.
We have developed a robust and efficient method for differentiating pluripotent stem cells into cholangiocyte-like cells, which display structural and functional similarities to bile duct cells in normal liver. These cells will be useful for the in vitro study of the molecular mechanisms of bile duct development and have important potential for therapeutic strategies, including bioengineered liver approaches.
Excessive hepatic glucose production is a hallmark of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. The cAMP responsive transcription factor cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB), thought to be a key activator of the hepatic gluconeogenic gene regulation programme, has been suggested as a therapeutic target to reduce glucose output by the liver. Here, we test directly the requirement for hepatocytic CREB for the maintenance of glucose homeostasis.
We derived mice with a Creb (also known as Creb1) loxP allele for conditional, cell-type specific gene ablation. Hepatocyte-specific deletion of Creb was induced by injecting Creb (loxP/loxP) mice with Cre recombinase expression adeno-associated virus.
Strikingly, we found no difference in fed and fasted glucose levels, or in glucose, insulin and glucagon tolerance in mice fed a normal chow or a high-fat diet. In addition, mRNA levels of liver-specific genes, including several CREB target genes involved in gluconeogenesis, were not affected by CREB deficiency in the liver.
Our data show that CREB has no non-redundant functions in hepatic glucose metabolism, and is therefore not likely to be a useful target for the development of glucose-lowering drugs.
It has been shown that mature hepatocytes compensate tissue damages not only by proliferation and/or hypertrophy but also by conversion into cholangiocyte-like cells. We found that Sry HMG box protein 9-positive (Sox9(+)) epithelial cell adhesion molecule-negative (EpCAM(-)) hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α-positive (HNF4α(+)) biphenotypic cells showing hepatocytic morphology appeared near EpCAM(+) ductular structures in the livers of mice fed 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC)-containing diet. When Mx1-Cre:ROSA mice, which were injected with poly(I:C) to label mature hepatocytes, were fed with the DDC diet, we found LacZ(+)Sox9(+) cells near ductular structures. Although Sox9(+)EpCAM(-) cells adjacent to expanding ducts likely further converted into ductular cells, the incidence was rare. To know the cellular characteristics of Sox9(+)EpCAM(-) cells, we isolated them as GFP(+)EpCAM(-) cells from DDC-injured livers of Sox9-EGFP mice. Sox9(+)EpCAM(-) cells proliferated and could differentiate to functional hepatocytes in vitro. In addition, Sox9(+)EpCAM(-) cells formed cysts with a small central lumen in collagen gels containing Matrigel® without expressing EpCAM. These results suggest that Sox9(+)EpCAM(-) cells maintaining biphenotypic status can establish cholangiocyte-type polarity. Interestingly, we found that some of the Sox9(+) cells surrounded luminal spaces in DDC-injured liver while they expressed HNF4α. Taken together, we consider that in addition to converting to cholangiocyte-like cells, Sox9(+)EpCAM(-) cells provide luminal space near expanded ductular structures to prevent deterioration of the injuries and potentially supply new hepatocytes to repair damaged tissues. 
The molecular mechanisms which are responsible for restricting skeletal muscle gene expression to specific fiber types, either slow or fast twitch, are unknown. As a first step toward defining the components which direct slow-fiber-specific gene expression, we identified the sequence elements of the human troponin I slow upstream enhancer (USE) that bind muscle nuclear proteins. These include an E-box, a MEF2 element, and two other elements, USE B1 and USE C1. In vivo analysis of a mutation that disrupts USE B1 binding activity suggested that the USE B1 element is essential for high-level expression in slow-twitch muscles. This mutation does not, however, abolish slow-fiber specificity. A similar analysis indicated that the USE C1 element may play only a minor role. We report the cloning of a novel human USE B1 binding protein, MusTRD1 (muscle TFII-I repeat domain-containing protein 1), which is expressed predominantly in skeletal muscle. Significantly, MusTRD1 contains two repeat domains which show remarkable homology to the six repeat domains of the recently cloned transcription factor TFII-I. Furthermore, both TFII-I and MusTRD1 bind to similar but distinct sequences, which happen to conform with the initiator (Inr) consensus sequence. Given the roles of MEF2 and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins in muscle gene expression, the similarity of TFII-I and MusTRD1 is intriguing, as TFII-I is believed to coordinate the interaction of MADS-box proteins, bHLH proteins, and the general transcription machinery.
Neuron-specific expression of the GnRH gene is dependent on an upstream multicomponent enhancer. This enhancer is functional in a small population of GnRH-producing hypothalamic neurons which, through the secretion of GnRH, mediates central nervous system control of reproductive function. GnRH enhancer function requires activation by the GATA family of transcription factors that act through tandem consensus GATA-binding motifs, GATA-A and GATA-B. Here we show that two newly identified DNA-binding factors, termed GBF-A1/A2 and GBF-B1, bind the GnRH enhancer at sites overlapping the GATA factor-binding motifs. In vitro bindings of GATA, GBF-A1/A2, and GBF-B1 to the GnRH enhancer sequences are independent. Specific mutation of either the consensus GATA motif or the GBF-B1 site of GATA-B does not alter binding of the overlapping factor in vitro. Utilizing a GnRH-expressing neuronal cell line as a model system, we show by transient transfection that GBF-B1 is necessary for enhancer activity and independently activates the GnRH promoter. Transactivation of the GnRH enhancer in GT1 cells and in NIH 3T3 cells by GATA-4 is modulated by GBF-B1 binding, suggesting GBF-B1 interferes with GATA factor binding through a steric mechanism.
Among its plethora of activities as an inflammatory mediator, TNF-alpha has potent regulatory control on extracellular matrix production and degradation. Earlier studies have documented that TNF-alpha inhibits type I collagen gene (COL1A2) expression at the transcriptional level, but the characterization of the transcription factors involved has been elusive. In the present study, using transient cell transfection of human dermal fibroblasts with a battery of 5' end deletion/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene constructs, we have characterized the TNF-alpha response element of the COL1A2 promoter. The TNF-alpha response element was attributed to a specific region that comprises noncanonical activator protein-1 (AP-1) (CGAGTCA) and NF-kappa B (AGAGTTTCCC) binding sites. TNF-alpha effect was eliminated by a 2-bp substitution mutation in the NF-kappa B1 binding half site of the NF-kappa B cis element. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) showed that recombinant human NF-kappa B heterodimers as well as NF-kappa B1 and RelA homodimers, but not AP-1, were capable of binding this element. Further, EMSA with human fibroblast nuclear extracts demonstrated enhanced binding of a single, specific complex within 5 min of TNF-alpha stimulation, which reached a plateau by 1 h and was not affected by preincubation of cells with cycloheximide. Gel supershift assays identified the complex as the NF-kappa B (p50/p65) heterodimer, whereas Abs to nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) and Jun family members failed to recognize the complex. These data suggest that in fibroblasts TNF-alpha activates and initiates the nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B that binds a divergent NF-kappa B element and plays a critical role in the observed inhibition of alpha 2(I) collagen gene transcription.
The rat pyruvate kinase L (PKL) gene produces the L- and R-type isozymes by alternative transcription that is regulated in a tissue-specific manner. To investigate which DNA elements are involved in hepatocyte-specific expression of the L-type isozyme, we performed transient DNA transfer experiments with PKL/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fusion genes. We found three positive regulatory regions required for expression of the L-type isozyme in adult rat hepatocytes by functional analyses of a series of 5' and internal deletion constructs of the fusion genes. These regions, designated as PKL-I, PKL-II, and PKL-III, were located between nucleotides -76 and -94, -126 and -149, and -150 and -170, respectively. PKL-I showed enhancer-like activity alone, whereas PKL-II and PKL-III did not have any independent effect. Combinations of L-I + L-II and L-II + L-III, but not of L-I + L-III, showed synergistic enhancer activities when oriented in the same direction. The inclusion of all three elements oriented in the same direction had the maximum synergistic effect, indicating that these elements function as a unit. This unit enhanced expression from heterologous as well as homologous promoters in a manner that was independent of its orientation and position relative to the cap site. The activity of the unit was not detected in HeLa cells or K562 erythroleukemia cells, suggesting that this unit possessed cell-type specificity. PKL-I consists of a palindrome sequence 5'-CTGGTTATACTTTAACCAG-3', which contain a sequence homologous to the LF-B1-binding site. PKL-II contains the sequence 5'-TTCCTGGACTCTGGCCCCCAGTGT-3', which is similar to that of the LF-A1-binding site. PKL-III contains a palindrome sequence 5'-CCACGGGGCACTCCCGTGG-3', which include a sequence homologous to the binding site of the adenovirus major late transcription factor. Gel retardation assay indicated that the different trans-acting factors interacted with three elements and that the transacting protein bound to PKL-I was in fact LF-B1. However, the trans-acting factors bound to PKL-II and PKL-III were different from LF-A1 and major late transcription factor, respectively. Thus, we conclude that three cis-acting elements are very important for specific expression of the PKL gene in hepatocytes and that LF-B1 and two unknown factors bound to these elements interact with each other to cause a synergistic effect.
A segment of 1,022 base pairs (bp) of the 5'-flanking region of the human albumin gene, fused to a reporter gene, directs hepatoma-specific transcription. Three functionally distinct regions have been defined by deletion analysis: (i) a negative element located between bp -673 and -486, (ii) an enhancer essential for efficient albumin transcription located between bp -486 and -221, and (iii) a promoter spanning a region highly conserved throughout evolution. Protein-binding studies have demonstrated that a liver trans-acting factor which interacts with the enhancer region is the well-characterized transcription factor LF-B1, which binds to promoters of several liver-specific genes. A synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide containing the LF-B1-binding site is sufficient to act as a tissue-specific transcriptional enhancer when placed in front of the albumin promoter. The fact that the same binding site functions in both an enhancer and a promoter suggests that these two elements influence the initiation of transcription through similar mechanisms.
Expression of the liver-specific alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1AT) gene is extinguished in hepatoma/fibroblast hybrids. To define the mechanism of extinction, we identified DNA sequences involved in this process by transiently transfecting mutant alpha 1AT promoters into parental and hybrid cells. The wild-type alpha 1AT promoter (-554 to +44 bp) was highly expressed in rat hepatoma cells, but activity was 100-fold less in fibroblasts or cell hybrids. Mutations in this region failed to activate alpha 1AT expression in nonhepatic cells, but mutations in the binding site for liver factor B1 (LF-B1) reduced hepatic-specific expression greater than 100-fold. Furthermore, the hybrid cells failed to express LF-B1-binding activity and mRNA. This suggested that alpha 1AT extinction in hybrids might be an indirect, lack-of-activation phenotype mediated primarily through repression of LF-B1. To test this possibility, we stably transfected an LF-B1 expression cassette into parental and hybrid cells and monitored expression of transfected and endogenous alpha 1AT genes. Surprisingly, although constitutive LF-B1 expression could activate alpha 1AT-CAT transgenes in these cells, it neither prevented nor reversed extinction of the chromosomal alpha 1AT genes. We conclude that although extinction of the LF-B1 trans-activator accompanies alpha 1AT extinction in cell hybrids, it does not play a causal role in this process.
Previous work in transfected cell lines and in nuclear extracts has led to the identification of two cis-acting elements important for transcription of the human alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) gene, which bind to two liver specific trans-acting factors, LF-A1 and LF-B1. Mutations EM3 and PM1, which abolish the binding of LF-A1 and LF-B1 respectively, drastically reduce transcription activity of the A1AT gene in vitro and in cell culture. The same mutants have now been introduced in a larger DNA context and their effect has been tested in transgenic mice. A stretch of DNA was constructed which carries two transcriptional units: 18 kb of the human retinol binding protein (RBP) gene, driving the expression of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyl transferase, linked to 17.5 kb containing the entire A1AT coding sequence with additional 5' and 3' flanking sequences. Transcription from the RBP promoter was shown to predominate in liver, and could be used as an internal marker of 'active copy number'. Mutations in the A1AT gene promoter were introduced by homologous recombination in bacterial cells. The results show that base pair substitutions in the binding site for LF-A1 and LF-B1 drastically reduce transcription in non-hepatic adult tissues, yolk sac, and fetal liver, whereas only LF-B1 binding site mutations have a marked, albeit variable, effect in adult liver.
Human hepatitis B virus enhancer II B1 binding factor (hB1F  also known as NR5A2, LRH-1, FTF or CPF) is an orphan nuclear receptor and belongs to the fushi tarazu factor I (FTZ-F1) subfamily. It plays important roles in the transcriptional regulation of a number of genes involved in bile acid biosynthesis pathway, hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication and liver specific regulatory network. Like other nuclear receptors, hB1F is composed of modular functional domains. We characterized a domain in its hinge region that imposes a strong repression on the transcriptional activity of hB1F, which is important for the function of hB1F on regulating the activity of HBV enhancer II/core promoter. Mutations of the core residues in this domain abrogate the repression. Bioinformatic analysis reveals that the amino acid sequence of this region is highly conserved only among members of the FTZ-F1 subfamily. The repression is observed in five cell lines tested, while the degree of the repression varies greatly, which does not parallel with the expression level of the DEAD box protein of 130 kD (DP103), a potential interacting protein of a homologous domain in the steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1). Moreover, the repression is not affected by the silencing mediator for retinoic acid receptor and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT) and steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1). Collectively, these data suggest a novel regulatory mechanism for the transcriptional activity of hB1F.
Human hepatitis B virus enhancer II B1 binding factor (hB1F) was cloned and characterized as a novel member of the Ftz-F1 (NR5A) nuclear receptor subfamily. Although progresses have recently been made, its biological function remains largely unidentified. The aim of this study was to establish an hB1F transgenic mouse model to promote the functional study of hB1F.
Transgene fragments were microinjected into fertilized eggs of mice. The manipulated embryos were transferred into the oviducts of pseudopregnant female mice. The offsprings were identified by PCR and Southern blot analysis. Transgene expression was analyzed with RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Transgenic founder mice were used to establish transgenic mouse lineages. The F1 and F2 mice were identified by PCR analysis.
Seven mice were identified as carrying copies of transgene. RT-PCR and Western blotting results showed that the transgene was expressed in heart, liver, lung, kidney and stomach in one of the transgenic mouse lineages. Genetic analysis of the transgenic mice demonstrated that the transgene was integrated into the chromosome at a single site, and was transmitted stably.
In this study we established an hB1F transgenic mouse model, which will facilitate the investigation of the biological function of hB1F in vivo.
Airway epithelial cells synthesize proinflammatory molecules such as IL-8, GM-CSF, RANTES, and ICAM-1, the expression of which is increased in the airways of patients with asthma. We investigated the regulation of these NF-kappa B-dependent genes by the novel protein kinase C (PKC) isoform PKC delta in 16HBE14o- human airway epithelial cells, focusing on IL-8 expression. Transient transfection with the constitutively active catalytic subunit of PKC delta (PKC delta-CAT), and treatment with bryostatin 1, an activator of PKC delta, each increased transcription from the IL-8 promoter, whereas overexpression of PKC epsilon had minor effects. Expression of a dominant negative PKC delta mutant (PKC delta-KR) or pretreatment of cells with rottlerin, a chemical PKC delta inhibitor, attenuated TNF-alpha- and phorbol ester-induced transcription from the IL-8 promoter. Bryostatin 1 treatment increased IL-8 protein abundance in primary airway epithelial cells. Selective activation of PKC delta by bryostatin also activated NF-kappa B, as evidenced by p65 RelA and p50 NF-kappa B1 binding to DNA, NF-kappa B trans-activation, and I kappa B degradation. The sufficiency of PKC delta to induce NF-kappa B nuclear translocation and binding to DNA was confirmed in a 16HBE14o- cell line inducibly expressing PKC delta-CAT under the tet-off system. Deletion of the NF-kappa B response element severely attenuated PKC delta-induced IL-8 promoter activity. Finally, PKC delta-CAT induced transcription from the GM-CSF, RANTES, and ICAM-1 promoters. Together these data suggest that PKC delta plays a key role in the regulation of airway epithelial cell NF-kappa B-dependent gene expression.
NF-kappa B is a transcription factor whose nuclear residence is controlled by I kappa B family members. In the NF-kappa B-I kappa B autoregulatory loop, activated (nuclear) Rel A.NF-kappa B1 induces the resynthesis of I kappa B alpha recapturing nuclear Rel A back into the cytoplasm within 1 h of stimulation. In contrast, NF-kappa B1 subunits redistribute more slowly into the cytoplasm (from 6 to 12 h). Here we examine the role of inducible cytoplasmic BCL-3 expression in terminating nuclear NF-kappa B1. Although BCL-3 is a nuclear protein in B lymphocytes, surprisingly, BCL-3 is primarily a cytoplasmic protein in HepG2 cells. Cytoplasmic BCL-3 abundance is induced 6-12 h after tumor necrosis factor-alpha stimulation where it complexes with NF-kappa B1 homodimers. Moreover, BCL-3 mRNA and protein expression are induced by NF-kappa B-activating agents. Two observations are interpreted to indicate that bcl-3 is transactivated by NF-kappa B/Rel A: 1) expression of a dominant negative NF-kappa B inhibitor blocks tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced BCL-3 expression and 2) expression of constitutively active Rel A is sufficient to induce BCL-3 expression. In gene transfer studies, we identify two high affinity NF-kappa B-binding sites, kappa B1 (located at -872 to -861 nucleotides) and kappa B2 (-106 to -96 nucleotides), and although both bind with high affinity to Rel A, only kappa B2 is required for NF-kappa B-dependent induction of the native BCL-3 promoter. Down-regulation of BCL-3 induction results in prolonged, enhanced NF-kappa B1 binding and increased NF-kappa B-dependent transcription. Together, these data suggest the presence of an NF-kappa B-BCL-3 autoregulatory loop important in terminating NF-kappa B1 action and that individual NF-kappa B isoforms are actively terminated through coordinate induction of inhibitory I kappa B molecules to restore cellular homeostasis.
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) often carry out their functions through associations with adaptor proteins. We recently identified heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A2/B1 as an adaptor of the human HOTAIR lncRNA. hnRNP A2 and B1 are splice isoforms of the same gene. The spliced version of HOTAIR preferentially associates with the B1 isoform, which we hypothesize contributes to RNA-RNA matching between HOTAIR and transcripts of target genes in breast cancer. Here we used enhanced cross-linking immunoprecipitation (eCLIP) to map the direct interactions between A2/B1 and RNA in breast cancer cells. Despite differing by only twelve amino acids, the A2 and B1 splice isoforms associate preferentially with distinct populations of RNA in vivo. Through cellular fractionation experiments we characterize the pattern of RNA association in chromatin, nucleoplasm, and cytoplasm. We find that a majority of interactions occur on chromatin, even those that do not contribute to co-transcriptional splicing. A2/B1 binding site locations on multiple RNAs hint at a contribution to the regulation and function of lncRNAs. Surprisingly, the strongest A2/B1 binding site occurs in a retained intron of HOTAIR, which interrupts an RNA-RNA interaction hotspot. In vitro eCLIP experiments highlight additional exonic B1 binding sites in HOTAIR which also surround the RNA-RNA interaction hotspot. Interestingly, a version of HOTAIR with the intron retained is still capable of making RNA-RNA interactions in vitro through the hotspot region. Our data further characterize the multiple functions of a repurposed splicing factor with isoform-biased interactions, and highlight that the majority of these functions occur on chromatin-associated RNA.
Human Plexin-B1 is expressed in two truncated forms. The long form encodes a trans-membranal protein, while the short form, which is bound to the cell surface and partially secreted, possibly serves as a decoy receptor. Plexin receptors are trans-membrane proteins. The sema domain, found in the extracellular region, is common to all plexins, semaphorins, and the scatter factor receptors and is crucial for the biological activity and plexin receptor specificity. Semaphorin-4D/Plexin-B1 binding provides attractive and repulsive cues for the navigation of axonal growth cones, and new studies suggest that this system also plays a role in the regulation of the biological functions of endothelial cells, specifically in the control of angiogenesis. In a previous study, we have demonstrated the expression and possible role of Plexin-B1 in the mouse ovary. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that Plexin-B1 effects are mediated by Semaphorin-4D.
In vivo expression and localization of mouse ovarian Sema-4D were tested by immunohisto-chemistry. The role of Sema-4D in follicular development was examined by in vitro growth of preantral follicles in the presence or absence of Semaphorin-4D, with or without neutralizing antibodies against Plexin-B1. Follicular growth and steroid hormone secretion rates were tested.
Semaphorin-4D is expressed in the mouse ovary in vivo mostly in the granulosa cells and and its expression is modulated by PMSG and hCG. In the presence of Semaphorin-4D, in-vitro constant growth was observed as indicated by follicular diameter during the culture period and elevated steroid hormone secretion rates compared with control. These effects were abolished after addition of neutralizing antibodies against Plexin-B1.
In the ovarian follicle, the effect of Plexin-B1 is mediated by sema-4D.
The human hepatitis B virus enhancer II B1 binding factor (hB1F), which regulates the expression of hepatitis B virus genes, is identified as a nuclear receptor. It regulates several liver-specific genes and plays an important role in the bile acid biosynthesis pathway. A significantly optimized protocol has been worked out to prepare 15N and/or 13C-labeled hB1F ligand-binding domain in minimal medium with high yields for NMR studies. Under the various conditions optimized for the purification of His6-hB1F ligand-binding domain, the yield of the purified protein is estimated to be 25-30 mg from 0.5 L of M9 minimal media. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry data confirm the correctness of the primary sequence. Dynamic light scattering experiment proves that the protein exists as a monomeric form. In addition, the circular dichroism results show that the protein has a well-regulated secondary structure and a high alpha-helical content in ammonium bicarbonate buffer at 20 degrees C and pH 7.4. Finally, uniformly 15N-labeled protein is characterized by a TROSY-HSQC spectrum, and the dispersion of 15N-1H cross-peaks in the spectrum indicates the presence of well-ordered and properly folded protein as a monomer.
Ad4BP (or SF-1) is an essential transcriptional factor for steroidogenesis as well as for the development of the reproductive axis. We elucidated the structure of the human Ad4BP gene. The spliced variants of Ad4BP gene, ELP1 and ELP2 in mice, are unlikely to be present in humans since the analysis of the human gene revealed an in frame stop codon, 36-bp before the first ATG of Ad4BP. The promoter sequence of human Ad4BP, upstream of non-coding exon 1 was highly conserved, and E-box was also found to be essential for the transcription of human Ad4BP gene. During the process of the human Ad4BP gene cloning, we happened to obtain an Ad4BP-related gene, FTZ-F1beta which also belongs to the nuclear receptor family. We revealed cDNA structures of rat FTZ-F1beta, and found that rat has at least two types of FTZ-F1beta isoforms, which differ only by 21 amino acids length in the A/B domain. The tissue distributions of FTZ-F1beta in rat examined by RT-PCR, was found to be abundant in liver, pancreas, and gastrointestinal tracts. These results suggest that the physiological significance of FTZ-F1beta is different from that of Ad4BP.
Sterile castes are a defining criterion of eusociality; investigating their evolutionary origins can critically advance theory. In termites, the soldier caste is regarded as the first acquired permanently sterile caste. Previous studies showed that juvenile hormone (JH) is the primary factor inducing soldier differentiation, and treatment of workers with artificial JH can generate presoldier differentiation. It follows that a shift from a typical hemimetabolous JH response might be required for soldier formation during the course of termite evolution within the cockroach clade. To address this possibility, analysis of the role of JH and its signaling pathway was performed in the termite Zootermopsis nevadensis and compared with the wood roach Cryptocercus punctulatus, a member of the sister group of termites. Treatment with a JH analog (JHA) induced a nymphal molt in C. punctulatus RNA interference (RNAi) of JH receptor Methoprene tolerant (Met) was then performed, and it inhibited the presoldier molt in Z. nevadensis and the nymphal molt in C. punctulatus Knockdown of Met in both species inhibited expression of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E; the active form of ecdysone) synthesis genes. However, in Z. nevadensis, several 20E signaling genes were specifically inhibited by Met RNAi. Consequently, RNAi of these genes were performed in JHA-treated termite individuals. Knockdown of 20E signaling and nuclear receptor gene, Hormone receptor 39 (HR39/FTZ-F1β) resulted in newly molted individuals with normal worker phenotypes. This is the first report of the JH-Met signaling feature in termites and Cryptocercus JH-dependent molting activation is shared by both taxa and mediation between JH receptor and 20E signalings for soldier morphogenesis is specific to termites.
The orphan nuclear receptor hB1F (also known as NR5A2, LRH-1, FTF or CPF) plays important roles in regulating the expression of several cellular and viral genes actively involved in a wide range of biological processes such as the bile acid biosynthesis, liver specific gene regulatory network and hepatitis B virus replication. The activity of nuclear receptors is regulated by multiple mechanisms, including coactivation and corepression. In this study, it was found that the silencing mediator for retinoic acid receptor and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT) specifically represses the transcriptional activity of hB1F, on either GAL4 dependent reporter system or the hB1F-responsive HBV enhancer II/core promoter. The repression imposed by SMRT is observed in different cell lines. Interestingly, hB1F couldn  t interact with SMRT directly, as demonstrated by mammalian two-hybrid analysis or GST pull-down assay. Taken together, it can be concluded for the first time that the transcriptional activity of hB1F is regulated specifically by the corepressor SMRT via an indirect mechanism.
The protein-DNA interactions in the enhancer II (ENII) and core promoter regions of hepatitis B virus (HBV) were investigated by the ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (LMPCR) in vivo footprinting in HepG2.2.15 cell line. Major footprints are evident at the enhancer II and core promoter regions. In particular, proteins appear to interact with the sites for Sp1, C/EBP, HNF4, HNF3, HNF1 and hB1F, as well as the TATA-like element. It confirmed that these protein-DNA interactions defined in vitro play important roles in the regulation of 3.5 kb RNAs transcription of HBV in vivo. Notably, three novel sites nt 1774-1789, nt 1801-1818 and nt 1835-1843 were found to be protected or hypersensitive, indicating that they were also involved in protein-DNA interactions in vivo. Functional analysis using CAT reporter gene demonstrated that the site from nt 1801 to 1818 was important for the function of HBV core promoter.
Human B1F was cloned from a human liver cDNA library by yeast one-hybrid screening and characterized. It is a transcription factor which belongs to nuclear receptor superfamily. The cDNA segment 450-930 of human liver transcription factor hB1F was cloned into the pGEX-3X expression vector and was expressed in E.coli. The purified GST-fused hB1F, named GST-CS, were used to immunize mice to get polyclonal antibodies to hB1F. The antiserum showed specificity to hB1F after the purification by GST-Sepharose 4B. It can be used in further investigations of the structure and function of hB1F.
The human homologue of the Drosophila melanogaster orphan nuclear receptor fushi tarazu factor 1 (Ftz-F1), NR5A2 (hB1F), was initially identified as a regulatory factor that binds and activates enhancer II of hepatitis B virus. NR5A2 (hB1F) is expressed specifically in pancreas and liver, playing important roles in the regulation of several liver-specific genes. A detailed analysis on the genomic structure and promoter activity will greatly promote future studies on the function of the NR5A2 (hB1F) gene. In this report, a bacterial artificial chromosome clone and several phage clones covering the NR5A2 (hB1F) gene were isolated and the complete genomic sequence was obtained. Alignment of different cDNAs of the NR5A2 (hB1F) gene with the genomic sequence facilitated the delineation of its structural organization, which spans over 150 kb and consists of eight exons interrupted by seven introns. RT-PCR and 3'-RACE revealed that utilization of two polyadenylation signals results in the 3.8 and 5.2 kb transcripts that were observed previously. The transcription start site of the NR5A2 (hB1F) gene was mapped downstream of a canonical TATA box. An upstream fragment containing binding sites for several liver-specific and ubiquitous transcription factors exhibits hepatocyte-specific promoter activity. Transient transfections indicated that hepatocyte nuclear factors HNF1 and HNF3beta could activate NR5A2 (hB1F) promoter.
To analyze the tissue morphologic phenotype and liver gene expression profile of hB1F transgenic mice.
Transgene expression was analyzed with RT-PCR and Western blotting. For one of the transgenic mouse lines, tissue expression pattern of the transgene was also examined with immunochemical methods. Pathological analysis was used to examine the tissue morphologic phenotype of established transgenic mice. The liver gene expression profile of transgenic mice was analyzed with microchip, and some of the differentially expressed genes were verified with RT-PCR.
The expressions of hB1F were shown in livers from 6 of 7 transgenic mouse lines. The overexpression of hB1F transgene did not cause pathological changes. Expressions of three genes were up-regulated, while down-regulation was observed for 25 genes.
The overexpression of hB1F transgene may cause changes of gene expression profiles in the liver of transgenic mice.
Enhancer II (ENII) is one of the critical cis-elements in the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) genome for the hepatic viral gene transcription and DNA replication. The liver-specific activity of ENII is regulated by multiple liver-enriched transcription factors, including LRH-1/hB1F, HNF1, HNF3b, HNF4 and C/EBP. Knowledge on the interplay of these important factors is still limited. In this study, we demonstrate a functional synergism between the orphan nuclear receptor LRH-1/hB1F and the homeoprotein HNF1 in up-regulating the liver-specific activity of ENII. This synergism is sufficient for initiating the viral gene transcription and DNA replication in non-hepatic cells. We have defined the activation domains in hB1F and HNF1 that contribute to the synergism. We further show that hB1F and HNF1 can interact directly in vitro and have mapped the domains required for this interaction.
HepG2 and Huh7 cell lines are frequently used as models to study viral hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, they exhibit significantly different capacities in their ability to support hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication. To investigate the basis for this, transcription factor-binding motifs at the HBV core promoter (HBVCP) were tested in luciferase reporter constructs to identify the possible role of host factors. Among the transcription factors screened: PARP1, SP1, HNF4α, HNF3, hB1F and HNF1, deletion of the PARP1 binding motif abrogated transcriptional activity at the HBVCP in HepG2 but not Huh7 cells. Sequencing of the PARP1 gene revealed that HepG2 cells carried an Ala762 allele which has low ADP-ribosylation activity, which was shown to have increased PARP1 binding affinity to its cognate motif thus resulting in higher transcriptional activity. PARP1 inhibitors that are being developed as broad cancer therapeutics also target PARP1 ADP-ribosylation enzymatic function. Four PARP1 inhibitors: PJ-34, ABT888, AZD2281 and AG014699 were tested for their effect on HBV replication. All four small molecules effectively enhanced HBV replication in vitro, confirming the role of PARP1 in HBV replication and that alteration of ADP-ribosylation by mutation or drugs can affect HBV replication. Our data demonstrate that natural polymorphisms in the host affecting proteins such as PARP1 can have a significant effect on HBV replication. Hence, patients who are infected with HBV and are on clinical trials involving PARP1 inhibitors may be at risk from unintended side-effects such as exacerbation of HBV replication.
Human nuclear receptor hb1 f(nr5a2) was cloned and characterized as a novel member of the Ftz-F1 (nr5a) nuclear receptor subfamily,whose its biological function remained largely unidentified. The aim of this study was to establish transgenic mouse model that specifically expressed hB1F in the liver to faciliate the functional study of hB1F. hb1f cDNA was placed downstream of mouse albumin gene enhancer/promoter to construct a liver-specific hb1f expression vector. Transgene fragments were microinjected into fertilized eggs of mice. The manipulated embryos were transferred into the oviducts of pseudopregnant female mice. Four offspring were identified as carrying the transgenes by PCR,from which one was also verified by Southern blotting. RT-PCR and Western blotting results showed that the transgene was expressed in the liver of the transgenic mice. Transgenic founder mice were used to establish transgenic mouse lineages. The F1 mice were identified by PCR analysis. Genetic analysis of the transgenic mice demonstrated that the transgene had been integrated into the chromosome at a single site and could be stably transmitted.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) that negatively regulate gene expression have emerged as novel therapeutic tools for cancer treatment. In this study, we investigated the potential role of Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1), a novel oncogene, in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and examined the regulation of LRH-1 by miRNAs. We found that LRH-1 was highly overexpressed in NSCLC cell lines. Knockdown of LRH-1 by small interfering RNA significantly inhibited NSCLC cell growth and invasion. miR-376c directly targeted the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of LRH-1 and negatively regulated LRH-1 expression, as detected by dual-luciferase reporter assay, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. Further data showed that miR-376c expression was inversely correlated with LRH-1 expression in clinical cancer samples. Overexpression of miR-376c could inhibit NSCLC cell growth and invasion as well as Wnt signaling. In contrast, depletion of miR-376c exhibited the opposite effects. Moreover, these effects of miR-376c overexpression were partially abrogated by overexpression of LRH-1. Taken together, these results indicate that LRH-1 is involved in regulating the growth and invasion of NSCLC cells and that miR-376c inhibits NSCLC cell growth and invasion by targeting LRH-1, providing a novel insight into the potential for development of anti-cancer drugs for NSCLC.
MicroRNAs (miRs) have emerged as prospective tools for human cancer therapy, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) therapy. Previous studies have suggested that miR-381 functions as oncogenic or tumor-suppressive miRs in other cancer types. However, the role of miR-381 in HCC remains unknown. The present study investigated the expression and functional role of miR-381 in HCC. miR-381 expression was significantly decreased in HCC tissues and cell lines. miR-381 overexpression significantly inhibited HCC cell proliferation and colony formation, induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and suppressed cell invasion. Conversely, suppression of miR-381 showed the opposite effect in HCC cells. Bioinformatics analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assay results showed that miR-381 directly targeted the 3'-untranslated region of liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1), and quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis results showed that miR-381 negatively modulated LRH-1 expression. Data elucidated that miR-381 directly regulated HCC cell growth and invasion, as well as the Wnt signaling pathways, by targeting LRH-1. Clinical tissue detection data revealed an inverse correlation between miR-381 and LRH-1 expression in HCC tissues, further indicating the functional significance of miR-381-LRH-1 in regulating HCC tumorigenesis. The present study indicates that miR-381 may be a novel tumor suppressor that blocks HCC growth and invasion by targeting LRH-1. The results present novel insights into understanding the molecular mechanism underlying HCC tumorigenesis and provide a future direction to the development of therapeutic interventions for HCC. 
The first 3H-1,3-azaphospholo-pyridines 2a-c were synthesized as racemic mixtures in modest to medium yield by the reaction of N-(2-chloropyrid-3-yl)-trimethylacetimidoyl chloride 1 with RPLi2 (R = Ph, n-Bu, i-Bu), generated from RPH2 and BuLi in THF at -70 °C, and studied with respect to their suitability as ligands (L) in transition metal complexes. Reactions of 2a with group 6 metal(0) pentacarbonyls led to P-coordinated LM(CO)5 complexes 3a-5a (Cr, Mo, W) and the reaction of 2c with (norbornadiene)Mo(CO)4 surprisingly to 4c. [Rh(1,5-COD)Cl]2 and 2a,b, in metal/ligand ratio 1 : 1, furnished LRh(1,5-COD)Cl complexes 6a,b with P-coordination, 6b accompanied by a minor contamination by the bis-coordinated L[Rh(COD)Cl]2 complex 7b. Reactions of 2a,b with [(allyl)PdCl]2 proceeded in THF with dismutation of N-coordinated (allyl)PdCl and formed with 2a a labile crude product [(2a){(allyl)PdCl}1.2(PdCl2)0.8]·C4H8O, with the composition close to L[Pd(allyl)Cl]PdCl2 THF (8a·THF), which converted during crystallization to 9a, whereas 2b directly formed the N,N'-PdCl2-bridged bis[LPd(allyl)chloride] complex 9b. Conversion of 2b with equimolar amounts of Pd(CH3CN)2Cl2 in THF, or Na2PdCl4 in methanol, gave rise to the dimeric P,N-bridging complex 10b. Crystal structure analyses of 6a (rac), 9b·2CDCl3 (meso), 10b·4.5THF and 10b·2D6-acetone (rac) provided detailed structural information. 10b, but more efficiently complexes formed in situ from 2a,b and Pd2(DBA)3 or Pd(OAc)2, catalysed the arylamination of 2-bromopyridine with 2,4,6-trimethylaniline.
SUMO-modification of nuclear proteins has profound effects on gene expression. However, non-toxic chemical tools that modulate sumoylation in cells are lacking. Here, to identify small molecule sumoylation inhibitors we developed a cell-based screen that focused on the well-sumoylated substrate, human Liver Receptor Homolog-1 (hLRH-1, NR5A2). Our primary gene-expression screen assayed two SUMO-sensitive transcripts, APOC3 and MUC1, that are upregulated by SUMO-less hLRH-1 or by siUBC9 knockdown, respectively. A polyphenol, tannic acid (TA) emerged as a potent sumoylation inhibitor in vitro (IC50 = 12.8 µM) and in cells. TA also increased hLRH-1 occupancy on SUMO-sensitive transcripts. Most significantly, when tested in humanized mouse primary hepatocytes, TA inhibits hLRH-1 sumoylation and induces SUMO-sensitive genes, thereby recapitulating the effects of expressing SUMO-less hLRH-1 in mouse liver. Our findings underscore the benefits of phenotypic screening for targeting post-translational modifications, and illustrate the potential utility of TA for probing the cellular consequences of sumoylation. 
Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is one of the major causes of liver morbidity and mortality worldwide. Chronic alcohol consumption leads to development of liver pathogenesis encompassing steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and in extreme cases, hepatocellular carcinoma. Moreover, ALD may also associate with cholestasis. Emerging evidence now suggests that farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and bile acids also play important roles in ALD. In this review, we discuss the effects of alcohol consumption on FXR, bile acids and gut microbiome as well as their impacts on ALD. Moreover, we summarize the findings on FXR, FoxO3a (forkhead box-containing protein class O3a) and PPARα (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha) in regulation of autophagy-related gene transcription program and liver injury in response to alcohol exposure. 
The liver is the central organ involved in lipid metabolism. Dyslipidemia and its related disorders, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), obesity and other metabolic diseases, are of increasing public health concern due to their increasing prevalence in the population. Besides their well-characterized functions in cholesterol homoeostasis and nutrient absorption, bile acids are also important metabolic regulators and function as signaling hormones by activating specific nuclear receptors, G-protein coupled receptors, and multiple signaling pathways. Recent studies identified a new signaling pathway by which conjugated bile acids (CBA) activate the extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK1/2) and protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway via sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2). CBA-induced activation of S1PR2 is a key regulator of sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2) and hepatic gene expression. This review focuses on recent findings related to the role of bile acids/S1PR2-mediated signaling pathways in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism. 
Bile acids (BAs) are not only digestive surfactants but also important cell signaling molecules, which stimulate several signaling pathways to regulate some important biological processes. The bile-acid-activated nuclear receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), plays a pivotal role in regulating bile acid, lipid and glucose homeostasis as well as in regulating the inflammatory responses, barrier function and prevention of bacterial translocation in the intestinal tract. As expected, FXR is involved in the pathophysiology of a wide range of diseases of gastrointestinal tract, including inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer and type 2 diabetes. In this review, we discuss current knowledge of the roles of FXR in physiology of the digestive system and the related diseases. Better understanding of the roles of FXR in digestive system will accelerate the development of FXR ligands/modulators for the treatment of digestive system diseases. 
Phospholipids (PLs) are unusual signaling hormones sensed by the nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1), which has evolved a novel allosteric pathway to support appropriate interaction with co-regulators depending on ligand status. LRH-1 plays an important role in controlling lipid and cholesterol homeostasis and is a potential target for the treatment of metabolic and neoplastic diseases. Although the prospect of modulating LRH-1 via small molecules is exciting, the molecular mechanism linking PL structure to transcriptional co-regulator preference is unknown. Previous studies showed that binding to an activating PL ligand, such as dilauroylphosphatidylcholine, favors LRH-1's interaction with transcriptional co-activators to up-regulate gene expression. Both crystallographic and solution-based structural studies showed that dilauroylphosphatidylcholine binding drives unanticipated structural fluctuations outside of the canonical activation surface in an alternate activation function (AF) region, encompassing the β-sheet-H6 region of the protein. However, the mechanism by which dynamics in the alternate AF influences co-regulator selectivity remains elusive. Here, we pair x-ray crystallography with molecular modeling to identify an unexpected allosteric network that traverses the protein ligand binding pocket and links these two elements to dictate selectivity. We show that communication between the alternate AF region and classical AF2 is correlated with the strength of the co-regulator interaction. This work offers the first glimpse into the conformational dynamics that drive this unusual PL-mediated nuclear hormone receptor activation. 
The expression of aromatase (via CYP19 and the CYP19 PII promoter) and the orphan nuclear receptor family members, liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1) and steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) in cultured luteinized granulosa cells from women with endometriosis were investigated.
Luteinized granulosa cells from patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (16 patients with endometriosis and 28 controls) were examined for messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression of CYP19, CYP19 PII, LRH-1 and SF-1, determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Student's t-test, the Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman's rank correlation were used for statistical analysis.
The number of high quality embryos in the endometriosis group was significantly lower than in the control group. The mRNA expression levels of CYP19, CYP19 PII, LRH-1 and SF-1 in granulosa-lutein cells were decreased in women with endometriosis compared to the control group. The simultaneous down-regulation expression of LRH-1, SF-1 and CYP19 PII in endometriotic granulosa cells indicated their positive correlation.
Our results demonstrate aberrant expressions of SF-1 and LRH-1 in endometriotic granulosa-lutein cells. This finding may be helpful in understanding infertility associated with endometriosis and reduced P450 aromatase activity in endometriotic granulosa cells.
Expression of hepatic cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) is negatively regulated by orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP). In this study, we aimed to find whether thyroid hormone regulates SHP expression by modulating the transcriptional activities of liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1).
We injected thyroid hormone (triiodothyronine, T3) to C57BL/6J wild type. RNA was isolated from mouse liver and used for microarray analysis and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Human hepatoma cell and primary hepatocytes from mouse liver were used to confirm the effect of T3 in vitro. Promoter assay and electrophoretic mobility-shift assay (EMSA) were also performed using human hepatoma cell line.
Initial microarray results indicated that SHP expression is markedly decreased in livers of T3 treated mice. We confirmed that T3 repressed SHP expression in the liver of mice as well as in mouse primary hepatocytes and human hepatoma cells by real-time PCR analysis. LRH-1 increased the promoter activity of SHP; however, this increased activity was markedly decreased after thyroid hormone receptor β/retinoid X receptor α/T3 administration. EMSA revealed that T3 inhibits specific LRH-1 DNA binding.
We found that thyroid hormone regulates the expression of SHP mRNA through interference with the transcription factor, LRH-1.
POD-1/TCF21 may play a crucial role in adrenal and gonadal homeostasis and represses Sf-1/SF-1 expression in adrenocortical tumor cells. SF-1 and LRH-1 are members of the Fzt-F1 subfamily of nuclear receptors. LRH-1 is involved in several biological processes, and both LRH-1 and its repressor SHP are involved in many types of cancer. In order to assess whether POD-1 can regulate LRH-1 via the same mechanism that regulates SF-1, we analyzed the endogenous mRNA levels of POD-1, SHP, and LRH-1 in hepatocarcinoma and adrenocortical tumor cells using qRT-PCR. Hereafter, these tumor cells were transiently transfected with pCMVMycPod-1, and the effect of POD-1 overexpression on E-box elements in the LRH-1 and SHP promoter region were analyzed by ChIP assay. Also, Cyclin E1 protein expression was analyzed to detect cell cycle progression. We found that POD-1 overexpression significantly decreased SHP/SHP mRNA and protein levels through POD-1 binding to the E-box sequence in the SHP promoter. Decreased SHP expression affected LRH-1 regulation and increased Cyclin E1. These findings show that POD-1/TCF21 regulates SF-1 and LRH-1 by distinct mechanisms, contributing to the understanding of POD-1 involvement and its mechanisms of action in adrenal and liver tumorigenesis, which could lead to the discovery of relevant biomarkers.
The nuclear receptor LRH-1 (Liver Receptor Homolog-1, NR5A2) is a transcription factor that regulates gene expression programs critical for many aspects of metabolism and reproduction. Although LRH-1 is able to bind phospholipids, it is still considered an orphan nuclear receptor (NR) with an unknown regulatory hormone. Our prior cellular and structural studies demonstrated that the signaling phosphatidylinositols PI(4,5)P2 (PIP2) and PI(3,4,5)P3 (PIP3) bind and regulate SF-1 (Steroidogenic Factor-1, NR5A1), a close homolog of LRH-1. Here, we describe the crystal structure of human LRH-1 ligand binding domain (LBD) bound by PIP3 - the first phospholipid with a head group endogenous to mammals. We show that the phospholipid hormone binds LRH-1 with high affinity, stabilizing the receptor LBD. While the hydrophobic PIP3 tails (C16/C16) are buried inside the LRH-1 ligand binding pocket, the negatively charged PIP3 head group is presented on the receptor surface, similar to the phosphatidylinositol binding mode observed in the PIP3-SF-1 structure. Thus, data presented in this work reinforce our earlier findings demonstrating that signaling phosphatidylinositols regulate the NR5A receptors LRH-1 and SF-1. 
The purpose of this retrospective study was to assess the 5-year survival outcomes of cervical cancer patients who underwent an, open radical hysterectomy (ORH), robotic-assisted radical hysterectomy (RRH) or laparoscopic radical hysterectomy (LRH) for the treatment of their disease.
We conducted a review of all cervical cancer patients who were managed with an ORH, RRH or LRH.
Forty-nine patients were treated with LRH, 58 were managed via RRH and 39 patients underwent an ORH. The LRH (1.78 h) patients had a significantly shorter operative duration than the RRH (2.88 h) and ORH (2.39 h) subjects (p &lt; 0.001). Blood loss was the highest in the ORH (475 cc) group (RRH = 207 cc and LRH = 312 cc) (P &lt; 0.001). Moreover, the ORH (5.04 days) patients had a significantly longer hospital stay than the LRH (2.95 days) and RRH (2.50 day) subjects (P &lt; 0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a progression free survival (PFS) rate of 84.6% for the ORH group, 89.8% for the LRH group and 89.7% for the RRH patients (P = 0.271) at 60 months; overall survival was 92.3% for the ORH group, 95.9% for the LRH group and 96.6% for the RRH patients (P = 0.80).
The results from this study suggest that, irrespective of operative approach, patients who underwent a radical hysterectomy for early stage cervical cancer attained similar 5-year disease free and overall survival outcomes.
Liver receptor homologue 1 (LRH-1) is an orphan nuclear receptor that has been implicated in the progression of breast, pancreatic and colorectal cancer (CRC). To determine mechanisms underlying growth promotion by LRH-1 in CRC, we undertook global expression profiling following siRNA-mediated LRH-1 knockdown in HCT116 cells, which require LRH-1 for growth and in HT29 cells, in which LRH-1 does not regulate growth. Interestingly, expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 (CDKN1A) was regulated by LRH-1 in HCT116 cells. p21 regulation was not observed in HT29 cells, where p53 is mutated. p53 dependence for the regulation of p21 by LRH-1 was confirmed by p53 knockdown with siRNA, while LRH-1-regulation of p21 was not evident in HCT116 cells where p53 had been deleted. We demonstrate that LRH-1-mediated p21 regulation in HCT116 cells does not involve altered p53 protein or phosphorylation, and we show that LRH-1 inhibits p53 recruitment to the p21 promoter, likely through a mechanism involving chromatin remodelling. Our study suggests an important role for LRH-1 in the growth of CRC cells that retain wild-type p53. 
The expression and roles of MicroRNA-381 (miR-381) has been explored in several types of human cancers. However, its biological functions in colon cancer remain largely unknown. Quantitative real-time PCR assays were used to detect the expression of miR-381 in human colon cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. miR-381 antisense oligos and mimics were introduced into SW480 and HCT116 cells. Bioinformatic prediction analysis was performed to identify the potential targets of miR-381. Protein expression analysis, luciferase assays and rescue assays were used to confirm the substrate of miR-381. We found that miR-381 was significantly down-regulated in human colon cancer tissues, compared with adjacent normal tissues. Introduction of miR-381 antisense oligos into SW480 and HCT116 cells promoted cell proliferation and invasion. Besides, inhibition of miR-381 could also support tumor growth in the nude mice. Additionally, bioinformatic prediction suggested that the nuclear receptor liver receptor homologue 1 (LRH-1) is a target gene of miR-381. Thus, our data suggested that down-regulation of miR-381 plays an important role in the colon cancer progression. 
As an orphan member of the nuclear receptor family, liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1) controls a tremendous range of transcriptional programmes that are essential for metabolism and hormone synthesis. Our previous studies have shown that nuclear localization of the LRH-1 protein is mediated by two nuclear localization signals (NLSs) that are karyopherin/importin-dependent. It is unclear whether LRH-1 can be actively exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In the present study, we describe a nuclear export domain containing two leucine-rich motifs [named nuclear export signal (NES)1 and NES2] within the ligand-binding domain (LBD). Mutation of leucine residues in NES1 or NES2 abolished nuclear export, indicating that both NES1 and NES2 motifs are essential for full nuclear export activity. This NES-mediated nuclear export was insensitive to the chromosomal region maintenance 1 (CRM1) inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB) or to CRM1 knockdown. However, knockdown of calreticulin (CRT) prevented NES-mediated nuclear export. Furthermore, our data show that CRT interacts with LRH-1 and is involved in the nuclear export of LRH-1. With full-length LRH-1, mutation of NES1 led to perinuclear accumulation of the mutant protein. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that these perinuclear aggregates were co-localized with the centrosome marker, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), ubiquitin and heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), indicating that the mutant was misfolded and sequestered into aggresome-like structures via the autophagic clearance pathway. Our study demonstrates for the first time that LRH-1 has a CRT-dependent NES which is not only required for cytoplasmic trafficking, but also essential for correct protein folding to avoid misfolding-induced aggregation. 
Balance of labile methyl groups (choline, methionine, betaine, and folate) is important for normal liver function. Quantitatively, a significant use of labile methyl groups is in the production of phosphatidylcholines (PCs), which are ligands for the nuclear liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1). We studied the role of LRH-1 in methyl-pool homeostasis and determined its metabolic effects using the methionine and choline-deficient (MCD) diet, which depletes methyl groups and results in a deleterious decrease in the PC-to-phosphatidylethanolamine ratio. We found that MCD diet-fed, liver-specific LRH-1 knockout mice (Lrh-1(-/-) ) do not show the expected decreased methyl-pool and PC/phosphatidylethanolamine ratio and are resistant to the hepatitis and fibrosis normally induced by the diet. Adaptive responses observed in wild-type mice on the MCD diet were also observed in Lrh-1(-/-) mice on a normal diet. This includes reduced expression of the highly active glycine-n-methyltransferase and the biliary phospholipid floppase multidrug-resistance protein 2 (Mdr2/Abcb4), resulting in reduced consumption of methyl groups and biliary PC secretion. In vitro studies confirm that Gnmt and Mdr2 are primary LRH-1 target genes. Additional similarities between hepatic gene expression profiles in MCD diet-fed wild-type and untreated Lrh-1(-/-) mice suggest that methyl-pool deficiency decreases LRH-1 activity, and this was confirmed by in vitro functional results in cells maintained in MCD medium.
LRH-1 is a novel transcriptional regulator of methyl-pool balance; when the methyl-pool is depleted, decreased LRH-1 transactivation suppresses expression of key genes to minimize loss of labile methyl groups. (Hepatology 2016;63:95-106).
Steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) and liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily and are categorized as orphan receptors. In addition to other nuclear receptors, these play roles in various physiological phenomena by regulating the transcription of target genes. Both factors share very similar structures and exhibit common functions. Of these, the roles of SF-1 and LRH-1 in steroidogenesis are the most important, especially that of SF-1, which was originally discovered and named to reflect such roles. SF-1 and LRH-1 are essential for steroid hormone production in gonads and adrenal glands through the regulation of various steroidogenesis-related genes. As SF-1 is also necessary for the development of gonads and adrenal glands, it is also considered a master regulator of steroidogenesis. Recent studies have clearly demonstrated that LRH-1 also represents another master regulator of steroidogenesis, which similarly to SF-1, can induce differentiation of non-steroidogenic stem cells into steroidogenic cells. Here, we review the functions of both factors in these steroidogenesis-related phenomena. 
In the last decade, the study of human sperm anatomy, at molecular level, has revealed the presence of several nuclear protein receptors. In this work, we examined the expression profile and the ultrastructural localization of liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) in human spermatozoa. We evidenced the presence of the receptor by Western blotting and real time-RT-PCR. Furthermore, we used immunogold electron microscopy to investigate the sperm anatomical regions containing LRH-1. The receptor was mainly located in the sperm head, whereas its expression was reduced in the neck and across the tail. Interestingly, we observed the presence of LRH-1 in different stages of testicular germ cell development by immunohistochemistry. In somatic cells, it has been suggested that the LRH-1 pathway is tightly linked with estrogen signaling and the important role of estradiol has been widely studied in sperm cells. To assess the significance of LRH-1 in male gametes and to deepen understanding of the role of estrogens in these cells, we investigated important sperm features such as motility, survival and capacitation. Spermatozoa were treated with 10 nm estradiol and the inhibition of LRH-1 reversed the estradiol stimulatory action. From our data, we discovered that human spermatozoa can be considered a new site of expression for LRH-1, evidencing its role in sperm motility, survival and cholesterol efflux. Furthermore, we may presume that in spermatozoa the LRH-1 effects are closely integrated with the estrogen signaling, supporting LRH-1 as a downstream effector of the estradiol pathway on some sperm functions.
Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder that results in accumulation of copper in the liver as a consequence of mutations in the gene encoding the copper-transporting P-type ATPase (ATP7B). WD is a chronic liver disorder, and individuals with the disease present with a variety of complications, including steatosis, cholestasis, cirrhosis, and liver failure. Similar to patients with WD, Atp7b⁻/⁻ mice have markedly elevated levels of hepatic copper and liver pathology. Previous studies have demonstrated that replacement of zinc in the DNA-binding domain of the estrogen receptor (ER) with copper disrupts specific binding to DNA response elements. Here, we found decreased binding of the nuclear receptors FXR, RXR, HNF4α, and LRH-1 to promoter response elements and decreased mRNA expression of nuclear receptor target genes in Atp7b⁻/⁻ mice, as well as in adult and pediatric WD patients. Excessive hepatic copper has been described in progressive familial cholestasis (PFIC), and we found that similar to individuals with WD, patients with PFIC2 or PFIC3 who have clinically elevated hepatic copper levels exhibit impaired nuclear receptor activity. Together, these data demonstrate that copper-mediated nuclear receptor dysfunction disrupts liver function in WD and potentially in other disorders associated with increased hepatic copper levels.
Apolipoprotein M (ApoM) is predominantly located in the high-density lipoprotein in human plasma. It has been demonstrated that ApoM expression could be regulated by several crucial nuclear receptors that are involved in the bile acid metabolism. In the present study, by combining gene-silencing experiments, overexpression studies, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we showed that ApoM positively regulated liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) gene expression via direct binding to an LRH-1 promoter region (nucleotides -406/ -197). In addition, we investigated the effects of farnesoid X receptor agonist GW4064 on hepatic ApoM expression in vitro. In HepG2 cell cultures, both mRNA and protein levels of ApoM and LRH-1 were decreased in a time-dependent manner in the presence of 1 μM GW4064, and the inhibition effect was gradually attenuated after 24 hours. In conclusion, our findings present supportive evidence that ApoM is a regulator of human LRH-1 transcription, and further reveal the importance of ApoM as a critical regulator of bile acids metabolism. 
Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) is a nuclear receptor involved in various biological processes. This nuclear receptor has critical functions in embryonic development as well as in adult homeostasis. Although the physiological functions of LRH-1 in normal breast, pancreas, and intestine have been widely investigated, the dysregulation that occurs during pathological conditions is not well understood. LRH-1 has been implicated in pancreatic, breast, and gastrointestinal cancer, where it exerts its effect of initiation and progression by promoting cell proliferation and metastasis. In addition to mechanistic studies, LRH-1 agonists and antagonists are being explored. Identification and development of endogenous and synthetic ligands has been pursued using computational-based structural analysis. Through ligand identification and a thorough understanding of the pathological roles of LRH-1, new therapeutic avenues for cancer treatment based upon LRH-1 may be a desirable focus for further research. 
Oleanolic acid is abundantly distributed in Swertia mussotii Franch, a Chinese traditional herb for the treatment of jaundice. However, the hepatoprotective role of oleanolic acid in obstructive cholestasis and its underlying molecular mechanism are unclear.
Normal rats and bile duct-ligated (BDL) rats were given oleanolic acid and serum biochemistry, bile salts, and pro-inflammatory factors were measured, as well as the expression levels of liver bile acid synthesis and detoxification enzymes, membrane transporters, nuclear receptors, and transcriptional factors.
Oral administration of oleanolic acid at 100 mg/kg did not cause rat liver injury. However, it significantly reduced the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) on days 7 and 14, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and TNF-α on day 14, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and IL-1β on days 3, 7, and 14 in the BDL rats. Furthermore, the serum levels of total bile acid (TBA) and bile acids, including CDCA, CA, DCA, and Tα/βMCA were significantly reduced by oleanolic acid on day 3 in the BDL rats. In addition, the expression levels of detoxification enzymes Cyp3a, Ugt2b, Sult2a1, Gsta1-2, and Gstm1-3, membrane transporters Mrp3, Mrp4, Ostβ, Mdr1, Mdr2, and Bsep, nuclear receptors Pxr, Vdr, Hnf4α, Rxrα, Rarα, Lxr, and Lrh-1, and transcriptional factors Nrf2, Hnf3β, and Ahr were significantly increased in oleanolic acid-treated rats.
We demonstrated that the oral administration of oleanolic acid attenuates liver injury, inflammation, and cholestasis in BDL rats. The anti-cholestatic effect may be associated with the induction of hepatic detoxification enzymes and efflux transporters mediated by nuclear receptors and transcriptional factors.
Steroidogenic factor 1 (NR5A1/SF-1) mutations usually manifest in 46,XY individuals with variable degrees of disordered sex development and in 46,XX women with ovarian insufficiency. So far, there is no genotype-phenotype correlation. The broad spectrum of phenotype with NR5A1 mutations may be due to a second hit in a gene with similar function to NR5A1/SF-1. Liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1/NR5A2) might be a good candidate. We performed in vitro studies for the interplay between SF-1, LRH-1 and DAX-1, expression profiles in human steroidogenic tissues, and NR5A2 genetic studies in a cohort (11 patients, 8 relatives, 11 families) harboring heterozygote NR5A1/SF-1 mutations. LRH-1 isoforms transactivate the CYP17A1 and HSD3B2 promoters similarly to SF-1 and compensate for SF-1 deficiency. DAX-1 inhibits SF-1- and LRH-1-mediated transactivation. LRH-1 is found expressed in human adult and fetal adrenals and testes. However, no NR5A2/LRH-1 mutations were detected in 14 individuals with heterozygote NR5A1/SF-1 mutations. These findings demonstrate that in vitro LRH-1 can act like SF-1 and compensate for its deficiency. Expression of LRH-1 in fetal testis suggests a role in male gonadal development. However, as we found no NR5A2/LRH-1 mutations, the 'second genetic hit' in SF-1 patients explaining the broad phenotypic variability remains elusive.
Liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1) is a nuclear receptor involved in the repression of inflammatory processes in the hepatointestinal tract. Here we report that LRH-1 is expressed in macrophages and induced by the Th2 cytokine IL-13 via a mechanism involving STAT6. We show that loss-of-function of LRH-1 in macrophages impedes IL-13-induced macrophage polarization due to impaired generation of 15-HETE PPARγ ligands. The incapacity to generate 15-HETE metabolites is at least partially caused by the compromised regulation of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1. Mice with LRH-1-deficient macrophages are, furthermore, highly susceptible to gastrointestinal and systemic Candida albicans infection. Altogether, these results identify LRH-1 as a critical component of the anti-inflammatory and fungicidal response of alternatively activated macrophages that acts upstream from the IL-13-induced 15-HETE/PPARγ axis. 
Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) plays an important role in the onset and progression of many cancer types. However, the role of LRH-1 in osteosarcoma has not been well investigated. In this study, the critical role of LRH-1 in osteosarcoma cells was described. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis results revealed that LRH-1 was highly overexpressed in osteosarcoma cells. LRH-1 was knocked down by small interfering RNA (siRNA), and this phenomenon significantly inhibited osteosarcoma cell proliferation. Bioinformatics analysis results showed that LRH-1 contained putative binding sites of microRNA-451 (miR-451); this result was further validated through a dual-luciferase activity reporter assay. miR-451 was overexpressed in osteosarcoma cells through transfection of miR-451 mimics; miR-451 overexpression then significantly inhibited LRH-1 expression and cell proliferation. The loss of LRH-1 by siRNA or miR-451 mimics significantly impaired Wnt/β-catenin activity, leading to G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Results showed that LRH-1 is implicated in osteosarcoma. Therefore, miR-451-induced suppression of LRH-1 can be a novel therapy to treat osteosarcoma. 
Apolipoprotein M (ApoM) is a novel apolipoprotein that was discovered in 1999 and is bound primarily to high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) in the plasma. Multiple factors may influence its expression at both the post-transcriptional and the transcriptional levels both in vivo and ex vivo as follows: hepatocyte nuclear factor-1α, 4α (HNF-1α, 4α), liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1), forkhead box A2 (Foxa2) and platelet activating factor (PAF) upregulate its expression; liver X receptor (LXR), retinoid X receptor (RXR), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), small heterodimer partner (SHP) and the majority of cytokines downregulate its expression. However, mechanisms underlying these processes remain unknown. Structurally, there exists a characterized hydrophobic binding pocket within the apoM protein, which enables it to bind functional lipids such as Sphingosine-1-Phosphate (S1P). Functionally, it facilitates the formation of preβ-HDL and enhances an avalanche of atheroprotective effects exerted by HDL. Moreover, in patients with diabetes, the levels of plasma apoM may decrease, whereas the augmentation of apoM decreases plasma glucose levels and magnifies the secretion of insulin. This article offers a panorama of the progress made in the research regarding the characteristics of apoM, particularly the regulation of its expression and its functions. 
Factors that modulate cholesterol levels have major impacts on cardiovascular disease. Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) functions as a sterol transporter mediating intestinal cholesterol absorption and counter-balancing hepatobiliary cholesterol excretion. The liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1) had been shown to regulate genes involved in hepatic lipid metabolism and reverse cholesterol transport. To study whether human NPC1L1 gene is regulated transcriptionally by LRH-1, we have analyzed evolutionary conserved regions (ECRs) in HepG2 cells. One ECR was found to be responsive to the LRH-1. Through deletion studies, LRH-1 response element was identified and the binding of LRH-1 was demonstrated by EMSA and ChIP assays. When SREBP2, one of several transcription factors which had been shown to regulate NPC1L1 gene, was co-expressed with LRH-1, synergistic transcriptional activation resulted. In conclusion, we have identified LRH-1 response elements in NPC1L1 gene and propose that LRH-1 and SREBP may play important roles in regulating NPC1L1 gene.
Colorectal cancers (CRCs) account for nearly 10% of all cancer deaths in industrialized countries. Recent evidence points to a central role for the nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) in intestinal tumorigenesis. Interaction of LRH-1 with the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, highly active in a critical subpopulation of CRC cells, underscores the importance of elucidating LRH-1's role in this disease. Reduction of LRH-1 diminishes tumor burden in murine models of CRC; however, it is not known whether LRH-1 is required for tumorigenesis, for proliferation, or for both. In this work, we address this question through shRNA-mediated silencing of LRH-1 in established CRC cell lines. LRH-1 mRNA knockdown results in significantly impaired proliferation in a cell line highly expressing the receptor and more modest impairment in a cell line with moderate LRH-1 expression. Cell-cycle analysis shows prolongation of G0/G1 with LRH-1 silencing, consistent with LRH-1 cell-cycle influences in other tissues. Cluster analysis of microarray gene expression demonstrates significant genome wide alterations with major effects in cell-cycle regulation, signal transduction, bile acid and cholesterol metabolism, and control of apoptosis. This study demonstrates a critical proproliferative role for LRH-1 in established colon cancer cell lines. LRH-1 exerts its effects via multiple signaling networks. Our results suggest that selected CRC patients could benefit from LRH-1 inhibitors. 
Steroids are fundamental hormones that control a wide variety of physiological processes such as metabolism, immune functions, and sexual characteristics. Historically, steroid synthesis was considered a function restricted to the adrenals and the gonads. In the past 20 years, a significant number of studies have demonstrated that steroids could also be synthesized or metabolized by other organs. According to these studies, the intestine appears to be a major source of de novo produced glucocorticoids as well as a tissue capable of producing and metabolizing sex steroids. This finding is based on the detection of steroidogenic enzyme expression as well as the presence of bioactive steroids in both the rodent and human gut. Within the intestinal mucosa, the intestinal epithelial cell layer is one of the main cellular sources of steroids. Glucocorticoid synthesis regulation in the intestinal epithelial cells is unique in that it does not involve the classical positive regulator steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) but a closely related homolog, namely the liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1). This local production of immunoregulatory glucocorticoids contributes to intestinal homeostasis and has been linked to pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel diseases. Intestinal epithelial cells also possess the ability to metabolize sex steroids, notably estrogen; this mechanism may impact colorectal cancer development. In this review, we contextualize and discuss what is known about intestinal steroidogenesis and regulation as well as the key role these functions play both in physiological and pathological conditions.
Little is known of the early stages of human follicular development and the complex processes that regulate follicular growth. To identify genes of potential importance, we analysed follicle-related transcripts in five populations of isolated size-matched human preantral follicles by microarray analysis. Oocyte-specific genes were found to be the most abundant and differentially expressed transcripts and included germ cell transcription factors LHX8 and SOHLH2 which were significantly down-regulated during preantral follicle development. Differentially expressed genes also included transcription factors of NOTCH signalling, IGF2, orphan nuclear receptor LRH-1, and homeobox gene HOXA7, indicating potentially important regulatory roles for these genes during early human folliculogenesis. We also found that FSHR mRNA and protein were present in the earliest stages of preantral follicles, whereas LHR was absent. In conclusion, our data identify specific oocyte and somatic genes in small human follicles that impact early follicle growth, and provide foundation for further analysis of the signalling pathways involved in early human folliculogenesis. 
Bile acids (BAs) are traditionally considered as "physiological detergents" for emulsifying hydrophobic lipids and vitamins due to their amphipathic nature. But accumulating clinical and experimental evidence shows an association between disrupted BA homeostasis and various liver disease conditions including hepatitis infection, diabetes and cancer. Consequently, BA homeostasis regulation has become a field of heavy interest and investigation. After identification of the Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) as an endogenous receptor for BAs, several nuclear receptors (SHP, HNF4α, and LRH-1) were also found to be important in regulation of BA homeostasis. Some post-translational modifications of these nuclear receptors have been demonstrated, but their physiological significance is still elusive. Gut secrets FGF15/19 that can activate hepatic FGFR4 and its downstream signaling cascade, leading to repressed hepatic BA biosynthesis. However, the link between the activated kinases and these nuclear receptors is not fully elucidated. Here, we review the recent literature on signal crosstalk in BA homeostasis. 
The orphan nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1; NR5A2) is a potent regulator of cholesterol metabolism and bile acid homeostasis. Recently, LRH-1 has been shown to play an important role in intestinal inflammation and in the progression of estrogen receptor positive and negative breast cancers and pancreatic cancer. Structural studies have revealed that LRH-1 can bind phospholipids and the dietary phospholipid dilauroylphosphatidylcholine activates LRH-1 activity in rodents. Here we characterize the activity of a novel synthetic nonphospholipid small molecule repressor of LRH-1, SR1848 (6-[4-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazin-1-yl]-3-cyclohexyl-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione). In cotransfection studies, SR1848 reduced LRH-1-dependent expression of a reporter gene and in cells that endogenously express LRH-1 dose dependently reduced the expression of cyclin-D1 and -E1, resulting in inhibition of cell proliferation. The cellular effects of SR1848 treatment are recapitulated after transfection of cells with small-interfering RNA targeting LRH-1. Immunocytochemistry analysis shows that SR1848 induces rapid translocation of nuclear LRH-1 to the cytoplasm. Combined, these results suggest that SR1848 is a functional repressor of LRH-1 that impacts expression of genes involved in proliferation in LRH-1-expressing cancers. Thus, SR1848 represents a novel chemical scaffold for the development of therapies targeting malignancies driven by LRH-1. 
Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) is a nuclear receptor (NR) with diverse functions in development, differentiation and metabolism and has been extensively studied in the enterohepatic system. While initially described as an orphan NR, recent studies suggest that specific phospholipids act as endogenous LRH-1 ligands. Although binding of ligands may enhance its transcriptional activation, posttranslational modifications (PTMs) and binding of coregulators and other NRs have emerged as mechanisms to fine-tune the selective regulation of LRH-1 target genes. In this review article, we will discuss how LRH-1 is regulated by PTMs and binding of ligands and coregulators, and explain some metabolic consequences with a special focus on liver physiology. 
SF-1 and LRH-1 are transcription factors that belong to the NR5A family of nuclear receptors that both have an essential role during development. Recent studies at the genome-wide scale have enabled the characterization of the cistrome and transcriptome regulated by SF-1 and LRH-1 in different cell lines and tissues. Those studies have allowed us to make a significant leap forward in our understanding of the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of NR5A nuclear receptors in stem cells and cancer. 
Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1, NR5A2) is an orphan nuclear receptor that has an essential role in cancer progression, notably in breast cancer. Although its role in promoting cancer cell proliferation and migration is well documented, the molecular basis is not completely established. Here, we report that LRH-1 inhibition affects two- and three-dimensional cell proliferation of different types of breast cancer cells, including estrogen receptor α (ERα)-positive and triple-negative cells. This phenotype is accompanied by the upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CDKN1A (aka p21(CIP1/WAF1)) in a p53-independent manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis shows that LRH-1 cooperates with FOXA1 and binds directly to CDKN1A promoter and a distal regulatory region found at -62 kb from its transcriptional start sites, allowing repression of CDKN1A transcription. LRH-1 or FOXA1 depletion induces CDKN1A upregulation by removing histone deacetylase 2 from the promoter and distal regulatory elements and permitting histone acetylation in these regions. Analysis of breast cancer samples reveals that a high LRH-1 level is inversely correlated with CDKN1A expression in breast cancer patients and is associated with poor prognosis. This study reveals a novel mechanism of control of cell proliferation by LRH-1 regulating CDKN1A transcription in breast cancer cells, independent of ERα and p53 status. Targeting LRH-1 may provide an attractive prospect for treatment of tumors that are resistant to hormonal and targeted therapy. 
The development of atherosclerosis is countered by the reverse transport of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver for excretion. In this issue of Cell Metabolism, Stein et al. (2014) establish LRH-1 as an important regulator of reverse cholesterol transport and identify SUMOylation as a primary mode of LRH-1 regulation.
Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) is an antiatherogenic process in which excessive cholesterol from peripheral tissues is transported to the liver and finally excreted from the body via the bile. The nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1) drives expression of genes regulating RCT, and its activity can be modified by different posttranslational modifications. Here, we show that atherosclerosis-prone mice carrying a mutation that abolishes SUMOylation of LRH-1 on K289R develop less aortic plaques than control littermates when exposed to a high-cholesterol diet. The mechanism underlying this atheroprotection involves an increase in RCT and its associated hepatic genes and is secondary to a compromised interaction of LRH-1 K289R with the corepressor prospero homeobox protein 1 (PROX1). Our study reveals that the SUMOylation status of a single nuclear receptor lysine residue can impact the development of a complex metabolic disease such as atherosclerosis.
Retinoic acid (RA) and bile acids share common roles in regulating lipid homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. In addition, the receptor for RA (retinoid x receptor) is a permissive partner of the receptor for bile acids, farnesoid x receptor (FXR/NR1H4). Thus, RA can activate the FXR-mediated pathway as well. The current study was designed to understand the effect of all-trans RA on bile acid homeostasis. Mice were fed an all-trans RA-supplemented diet and the expression of 46 genes that participate in regulating bile acid homeostasis was studied. The data showed that all-trans RA has a profound effect in regulating genes involved in synthesis and transport of bile acids. All-trans RA treatment reduced the gene expression levels of Cyp7a1, Cyp8b1, and Akr1d1, which are involved in bile acid synthesis. All-trans RA also decreased the hepatic mRNA levels of Lrh-1 (Nr5a2) and Hnf4α (Nr2a1), which positively regulate the gene expression of Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1. Moreover, all-trans RA induced the gene expression levels of negative regulators of bile acid synthesis including hepatic Fgfr4, Fxr, and Shp (Nr0b2) as well as ileal Fgf15. All-trans RA also decreased the expression of Abcb11 and Slc51b, which have a role in bile acid transport. Consistently, all-trans RA reduced hepatic bile acid levels and the ratio of CA/CDCA, as demonstrated by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The data suggest that all-trans RA-induced SHP may contribute to the inhibition of CYP7A1 and CYP8B1, which in turn reduces bile acid synthesis and affects lipid absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. 
Immune tolerance breakdown during UC involves the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), a key factor in mucosal homoeostasis and the therapeutic target of 5-aminosalycilates, which expression is impaired during UC. Here we assess the impact of glucocorticoids (GCs) on PPARγ expression, focusing especially on extra-adrenal cortisol production by colonic epithelial cells (CECs).
Activation of PPARγ in the colon was evaluated using transgenic mice for the luciferase gene under PPAR control (peroxisome proliferator response element-luciferase mice). Protein and mRNA expression of PPARγ were evaluated with colon fragments and purified CEC from mice. Cortisol production and steroidogenic factor expression were quantified in human CEC of patients with UC and those of controls. Gene expression knockdown by short hairpin RNA in Caco-2 cells was used for functional studies.
GCs were able to raise luciferase activity in peroxisome proliferator response element-luciferase mice. In the mice colons and Caco-2 cells, PPARγ expression was increased either with GCs or with an inducer of steroidogenesis and then decreased after treatment with a steroidogenesis inhibitor. Cortisol production and steroidogenic factor expression, such as liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1), were decreased in CEC isolated from patients with UC, directly correlating with PPARγ impairment. Experiments on Caco-2 cells lacking LRH-1 expression confirmed that LRH-1 controls PPARγ expression by regulating GC synthesis in CEC.
These results demonstrate cortisol control of PPARγ expression in CEC, highlighting cortisol production deficiency in colonocytes as a key molecular event in the pathophysiology of UC.
Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) is a conserved member of the NR5A subfamily in vertebrates and a potential regulator of estrogen synthesis in the ovarian granulosa cells. An Lrh-1 homologue was obtained from the orange-spotted grouper Epinephelus coioides that contains the conserved structural features of NR5A and is phylogenetically closely related to NR5A2. The expression of the orange-spotted grouper Lrh-1 is tissue-specific with relatively higher levels in the liver and ovary. The immunoreactive signals for Lrh-1 and Cyp19a1a were present in the ovarian follicular cells and germ cells. In the ovarian follicular cells, Lrh-1 was present both in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and colocalized with Cyp19a1a. The expression levels of both increased during vitellogenesis whereas only Cyp19a1a dramatically decreased toward maturation when Lrh-1 was localized almost exclusively to the cytoplasm of the follicular cells. The orange-spotted grouper Lrh-1 could up-regulate cyp19a1a transcription in vitro via the two conserved Ftz-f1 sites in cyp19a1a promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the orange-spotted grouper Lrh-1 could bind cyp19a1a promoter in vivo with a higher abundance in the vitellogenic ovary, whereas the binding was dramatically decreased in the mature ovary. Taken together, the results of present study demonstrate that Lrh-1 plays an important role in up-regulating cyp19a1a gene in the ovarian follicular cells during vitellogenesis, and the sequestration of Lrh-1 to the cytoplasm may down-regulate cyp19a1a expression in the mature ovary. This mechanism for modifying transcriptional roles of the orange-spotted grouper Lrh-1 may shed new light on the regulation of Cyp19a1 expression in other vertebrates as well. 
Bile salts play crucial roles in allowing the gastrointestinal system to digest, transport and metabolize nutrients. They function as nutrient signaling hormones by activating specific nuclear receptors (FXR, PXR, Vitamin D) and G-protein coupled receptors [TGR5, sphingosine-1 phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2), muscarinic receptors]. Bile acids and insulin appear to collaborate in regulating the metabolism of nutrients in the liver. They both activate the AKT and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Bile acid induction of the FXR-α target gene, small heterodimer partner (SHP), is highly dependent on the activation PKCζ, a branch of the insulin signaling pathway. SHP is an important regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism in the liver. One might hypothesize that chronic low grade inflammation which is associated with insulin resistance, may inhibit bile acid signaling and disrupt lipid metabolism. The disruption of these signaling pathways may increase the risk of fatty liver and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Finally, conjugated bile acids appear to promote cholangiocarcinoma growth via the activation of S1PR2. 
Although molecular signatures based on transcript expression in breast cancer samples have provided new insights into breast cancer classification and prognosis, there are acknowledged limitations in current signatures. To provide rational, pathway-based signatures of disrupted physiology in cancer tissues that may be relevant to prognosis, this study has directly quantitated changed gene expression, between normal breast and cancer tissue, as a basis for signature development. The nuclear receptor (NR) family of transcription factors, and their coregulators, are fundamental regulators of every aspect of metazoan life, and were rigorously quantified in normal breast tissues and ERα positive and ERα negative breast cancers. Coregulator expression was highly correlated with that of selected NR in normal breast, particularly from postmenopausal women. These associations were markedly decreased in breast cancer, and the expression of the majority of coregulators was down-regulated in cancer tissues compared with normal. While in cancer the loss of NR-coregulator associations observed in normal breast was common, a small number of NR (Rev-ERBβ, GR, NOR1, LRH-1 and PGR) acquired new associations with coregulators in cancer tissues. Elevated expression of these NR in cancers was associated with poorer outcome in large clinical cohorts, as well as suggesting the activation of ERα -related, but ERα-independent, pathways in ERα negative cancers. In addition, the combined expression of small numbers of NR and coregulators in breast cancer was identified as a signature predicting outcome in ERα negative breast cancer patients, not linked to proliferation and with predictive power superior to existing signatures containing many more genes. These findings highlight the power of predictive signatures derived from the quantitative determination of altered gene expression between normal breast and breast cancers. Taken together, the findings of this study identify networks of NR-coregulator associations active in normal breast but disrupted in breast cancer, and moreover provide evidence that signatures based on NR networks disrupted in cancer can provide important prognostic information in breast cancer patients.
Chronic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress results in toxicity that contributes to multiple human disorders. We report a stress resolution pathway initiated by the nuclear receptor LRH-1 that is independent of known unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways. Like mice lacking primary UPR components, hepatic Lrh-1-null mice cannot resolve ER stress, despite a functional UPR. In response to ER stress, LRH-1 induces expression of the kinase Plk3, which phosphorylates and activates the transcription factor ATF2. Plk3-null mice also cannot resolve ER stress, and restoring Plk3 expression in Lrh-1-null cells rescues ER stress resolution. Reduced or heightened ATF2 activity also sensitizes or desensitizes cells to ER stress, respectively. LRH-1 agonist treatment increases ER stress resistance and decreases cell death. We conclude that LRH-1 initiates a novel pathway of ER stress resolution that is independent of the UPR, yet equivalently required. Targeting LRH-1 may be beneficial in human disorders associated with chronic ER stress. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01694.001. 
Pluripotent stem cells maintain their pluripotency and undifferentiated status through a network of transcription factors. Liver receptor homolog-1 (Lrh-1) is one of these, and regulates the expression of other important transcription factors such as Oct-3/4 and Nanog. In early embryo and embryonic stem (ES) cells, Lrh-1 is transcribed using a unique promoter. In this study, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of embryonic Lrh-1 using ES and embryonal carcinoma F9 cells. Reporter assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that Sox2 and Gabp proteins bind to the promoter region of embryonic Lrh-1, and are necessary for its activation. The Sox2 site showed strong promoter activity and affinity for protein binding. Upon differentiation into the parietal endoderm by retinoic acid and cAMP, Lrh-1 promoter activity and transcripts were markedly reduced within 24 h. At the same time, Sox2 and Gabp binding to the promoter region of Lrh-1 were decreased, followed by a reduction of their expression. These results indicate that embryonic Lrh-1 expression is regulated by both Sox2 and Gabp. Our study presents new insights into the transcription factor network of pluripotent stem cells.
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have both the ability to self-renew and to differentiate into various cell lineages. Retinoic acid (RA), a metabolite of Vitamin A, has a critical function in initiating lineage differentiation of ESCs through binding to the retinoic acid receptors. Additionally, the Wnt signaling pathway plays a role in pluripotency and differentiation, depending on the activation status of the canonical and noncanonical pathways. The activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, which requires the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and its interaction with Tcf1/Lef at Wnt response elements, is involved in ESC stemness maintenance. The noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway, through actions of Tcf3, can antagonize the canonical pathway. We show that RA activates the noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway, while concomitantly inhibiting the canonical pathway. RA increases the expression of ligands and receptors of the noncanonical Wnt pathway (Wnt 5a, 7a, Fzd2 and Fzd6), downstream signaling, and Tcf3 expression. RA reduces the phosphorylated β-catenin levels by fourfold, although total β-catenin levels do not change. We show that RA signaling increases the dissociation of Tcf1 and the association of Tcf3 at promoters of genes that regulate stemness (e.g., NR5A2, Lrh-1) or differentiation (e.g. Cyr61, Zic5). Knockdown of Tcf3 increases Lrh-1 transcript levels in mESCs and prevents the RA-associated, fourfold increase in Zic5, indicating that RA requires Tcf3 to effect changes in Zic5 levels. We demonstrate a novel role for RA in altering the activation of these two Wnt signaling pathways and show that Tcf3 mediates some actions of RA during differentiation.
Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) is an orphan nuclear receptor that belongs to the NR5A subgroup of nuclear receptors. LRH-1 induces key genes to regulate metabolic process, ovarian function, cancer cell proliferation, and steroidogenesis. In the breast, LRH-1 modulates and synergizes with endogenous estrogen signaling to promote breast cancer cell proliferation. We used small interfering RNA knockdown strategies to deplete LRH-1 in breast cancer cells and followed with microarray analysis to identify LRH-1-dependent mechanisms. We identified key genes involved in TGF-β signaling to be highly responsive to LRH-1 knockdown. This relationship was validated in 2 breast cancer cell lines overexpressing LRH-1 in vitro and in a novel transgenic mouse with targeted LRH-1 overexpression in mammary epithelial cells. Notably, TGF-β signaling was activated in LRH-1-overexpressing breast cancer cells and mouse mammary glands. Further analyses of mammary gross morphology revealed a significant reduction in mammary lateral budding after LRH-1 overexpression. These findings suggest that the altered mammary morphogenesis in LRH-1 transgenic animals is mediated via enhanced TGF-β expression. The regulation of TGF-β isoforms and SMAD2/3-mediated downstream signaling by LRH-1 also implicates a potential contribution of LRH-1 in breast cancer. Collectively, these data demonstrate that LRH-1 regulates TGF-β expression and downstream signaling in mouse mammary glands. 
Obesity is a global health problem that increases the risk of several common diseases. Liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1) has an important role in steroid hormone metabolism, which influences body weight. Whether LRH-1 gene deletion causes obesity is yet to be clarified. In this study using LRH-1 heterozygous knockout (LRH-1(+/-)) mice, we investigated the role of LRH-1 on body weight gain and glucose and lipid metabolism. LRH-1(+/-) mice showed mild but significant body weight gains compared with wild-type littermate mice after being fed a high-fat diet. We performed glucose tolerance tests and insulin tolerance tests and did not find any significant differences between wild-type and LRH-1(+/-) mice. To clarify how LRH-1 gene deletion affects body weight gain, we measured food intake, oxygen consumption, respiratory quotient, spontaneous activity and rectal temperature, and found no significant differences between wild-type and LRH-1(+/-) mice fed a normal diet and a high-fat diet. The results suggest that heterozygous gene deletion of LRH-1 causes body weight gains without any apparent worsening of glucose and lipid metabolism. Identifying the effects of LRH-1 on body weight will aid in understanding the pathogenesis of obesity. 
Tumor characteristics are decisive in the determination of treatment strategy for patients with breast cancer. Patients with estrogen receptor α (ERα)-positive breast cancer can benefit from long-term hormonal treatment. Nonetheless, the majority of patients will develop resistance to these therapies. Here, we investigated the role of the nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1, NR5A2) in antiestrogen-sensitive and -resistant breast cancer cells. We identified genome-wide LRH-1-binding sites using ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing), uncovering preferential binding to regions distal to transcriptional start sites. We further characterized these LRH-1-binding sites by integrating overlapping layers of specific chromatin marks, revealing that many LRH-1-binding sites are active and could be involved in long-range enhancer-promoter looping. Combined with transcriptome analysis of LRH-1-depleted cells, these results show that LRH-1 regulates specific subsets of genes involved in cell proliferation in antiestrogen-sensitive and antiestrogen-resistant breast cancer cells. Furthermore, the LRH-1 transcriptional program is highly associated with a signature of poor outcome and high-grade breast cancer tumors in vivo. Herein, we report the genome-wide location and molecular function of LRH-1 in breast cancer cells and reveal its therapeutic potential for the treatment of breast cancers, notably for tumors resistant to treatments currently used in therapies.
The significance and regulation of liver receptor homologue 1 (LRH-1, NR5A2), a tumour-promoting transcription factor in breast cancer cell lines, is unknown in clinical breast cancers. This study aims to determine LRH-1/NR5A2 expression in breast cancers and relationship with DNA methylation and tumour characteristics. In The Cancer Genome Atlas breast cancer cohort NR5A2 expression was positively associated with intragenic CpG island methylation (1.4-fold expression for fully methylated versus not fully methylated, p=0.01) and inversely associated with promoter CpG island methylation (0.6-fold expression for fully methylated versus not fully methylated, p=0.036). LRH-1 immunohistochemistry of 329 invasive carcinomas and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) was performed. Densely punctate/coarsely granular nuclear reactivity was significantly associated with high tumour grade (p&lt;0.005, p=0.033 in invasive carcinomas and DCIS respectively), negative estrogen receptor status (p=0.008, p=0.038 in overall cohort and invasive carcinomas, respectively), negative progesterone receptor status (p=0.003, p=0.013 in overall cohort and invasive carcinomas, respectively), HER2 amplification (overall cohort p=0.034) and non-luminal intrinsic subtype (p=0.018, p=0.038 in overall cohort and invasive carcinomas, respectively). These significant associations of LRH-1 protein expression with tumour phenotype suggest that LRH-1 is an important indicator of tumour biology in breast cancers and may be useful in risk stratification.
Deregulation of microRNA (miRNA) has been suggested as a critical event in colon cancer development and progression. Recent studies have suggested that miR-374b is a novel cancer-related miRNA involved in several cancer types. Thus far, very little is known about the role of miR-374b in colon cancer; therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate the potential role of miR-374b in colon cancer. Here, we showed that miR-374b expression was significantly downregulated in colon cancer tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-374b inhibited the proliferation and invasion of colon cancer cells, while miR-374b suppression promoted colon cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) was identified as a target of miR-374b in colon cancer cells. Both the mRNA and protein expression of LRH-1 were regulated by miR-374b. In addition, an inverse correlation between LRH-1 mRNA and miR-374b expression was evidenced in colon cancer specimens. Notably, overexpression of miR-374b also downregulated the Wnt signaling in colon cancer cells. Furthermore, restoration of LRH-1 expression significantly abolished the antitumor effect of miR-374b in colon cancer cells. These findings suggest that miR-374b inhibits colon cancer cell proliferation and invasion through downregulation of LRH-1 expression. Inhibiting LRH-1 by miR-374b may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of colon cancer.
Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that aberrant miRNAs were involved in carcinogenesis and tumor progression by regulating oncogenes or tumor suppressor expression. Dysregulation of miR-381 has been reported in different tumors. However, the clinical roles and underlying mechanism in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains to be elucidated. We found the expression of miR-381 was significantly downregulated in both NSCLC tissues and cell lines. Clinical analysis revealed the reduced miR-381 was obviously associated with advanced TNM stage and lymph node metastasis. Moreover, we disclosed that miR-381 was a novel independent prognostic marker for predicting 5-year survival of NSCLC patients. The ectopic overexpression of miR-381 inhibited cell migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo. Notably, miR-381 could modulate LRH-1 by directly binding to its 3'-UTR. In clinical samples of NSCLC, miR-381 inversely correlated with LRH-1 expression, which performed positive roles in NSCLC migration and invasion. Alteration of LRH-1 expression at least partially abolished the migration and invasion of miR-381 on NSCLC cells. Here, we identified LRH-1 as a functional target of miR-381 in NSCLC. In conclusion, our data indicated that miR-381 inhibited migration and invasion of NSCLC by targeting LRH-1, and may represent a novel potential therapeutic target and prognostic marker for NSCLC.
Nuclear receptors (NRs), which belong to a superfamily of transcription factors and consist of a total of 48 members in humans, govern the expression of genes involved in a board range of developmental, reproductive, metabolic and immunological programs. Given the significant importance of androgen receptor and a few known NRs in the progression of prostate cancer, we surveyed the expression profiles of the entire NR superfamily in three-dimensional cultured prostatospheroids derived from different prostate cancer cell lines and a tumor xenograft model of castration-resistant prostate cancer VCaP-CRPC by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Our results revealed that prostatospheroids and castration-relapse VCaP-CRPC xenografts, both contained enriched populations of prostate cancer stem/progenitor-like cells (PCSCs), displayed distinct expression patterns of NRs. Intriguingly, most of these differentially expressed NRs were orphan NRs and showed upregulation. Pairwise analysis identified five orphan NRs (including RORβ, TLX, COUP-TFII, NURR1 and LRH-1) that showed common upregulation in both mRNA and protein levels in the prostatospheroids and castration-relapse VCaP-CRPC xenografts, and overexpression of these orphan NRs could increase cancer stem cell marker expressions and enhance spheroid formation capacity in prostate cancer cells, suggesting that these orphan NRs might perform positive roles in the growth regulation of PCSCs and castration-resistant prostate cancer. Together, our NR expression dataset not only revealed the distinct physiologic status and regulatory roles governed by the networks of specific NRs but also some of these identified orphan NRs could be the potential therapeutic targets for PCSCs or castration-resistant prostate cancer.
Mutations in ATP8B1 or ATP11C (members of P4-type ATPases) cause progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 in human or intrahepatic cholestasis in mice. Transmembrane protein 30A (TMEM30A), a β-subunit, is essential for the function of ATP8B1 and ATP11C. However, its role in the etiology of cholestasis remains poorly understood. To investigate the function of TMEM30A in bile salt (BS) homeostasis, we developed Tmem30a liver-specific knockout (LKO) mice. Tmem30a LKO mice experienced hyperbilirubinemia, hypercholanemia, inflammatory infiltration, ductular proliferation, and liver fibrosis. The expression and membrane localization of ATP8B1 and ATP11C were significantly reduced in Tmem30a LKO mice, which correlated with the impaired expression and localization of BS transporters, such as OATP1A4, OATP1B2, NTCP, BSEP, and MRP2. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib partially restored total protein levels of BS transporters but not the localization of BS transporters in the membrane. Furthermore, the expression of nuclear receptors, including FXRα, RXRα, HNF4α, LRH-1, and SHP, was also down-regulated. A cholic acid-supplemented diet exacerbated the liver damage in Tmem30a LKO mice. TMEM30A deficiency led to intrahepatic cholestasis in mice by impairing the expression and localization of BS transporters and the expression of related nuclear receptors. Therefore, TMEM30A may be a novel genetic determinant of intrahepatic cholestasis.
The effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition by an antihypertensive drug, captopril, and milk casein-derived ACE-inhibiting bioactive tripeptide isoleucine-proline-proline (Ile-Pro-Pro), on local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and glucocorticoid production in the intestine were studied in the dextran sodium sulfate induced colitis in mice. Mice received water or 3% dextran sodium sulfate with or without either 15.7 mg/l captopril or 833 mg/l Ile-Pro-Pro for 7 days. Captopril and Ile-Pro-Pro were found to have distinct effects on local renin-angiotensin system and mRNA expression of glucocorticoid synthesis components in colon in vitro. Captopril reduced intestinal mRNA expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme, angiotensinogen and Cyp11b1, whereas Ile-Pro-Pro reduced angiotensin-converting enzyme protein shedding from colon. Neither captopril nor Ile-Pro-Pro changed the expression of glucocorticoid-synthesis driving transcription factor Lrh-1 expression or intestinal glucocorticoid production. Contrary to previous studies, captopril did not alleviate DSS-induced colitis. Furthermore, Ile-Pro-Pro was mildly pro-inflammatory as exhibited by increased pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels in colon. The nutritional component Ile-Pro-Pro had different effect on intestinal RAS and glucocorticoid (GC) synthesis pathway than ACE inhibitor captopril, which suggests that the bioactivity of Ile-Pro-Pro is not limited to inhibition of ACE.
An increasing number of studies have reported that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the malignant behavior of colon cancer cells through directly targeting multiple tumor suppressors or oncogenes. The expression and role of miR-136 has been reported in several types of human cancer. However, the role of miR-136 in colon cancer remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression and function of miR-136 in colon cancer and the potential underlying mechanism. Here, we found that miR-136 was decreased in colon cancer cell lines and tissues. Overexpression of miR-136 inhibited the proliferation and invasion in SW480 and HCT116 cell lines while suppression of miR-136 exhibited the opposite effect. Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) was identified as a direct target gene of miR-136. Notably, miR-136 overexpression suppressed LRH-1 expression as well as Wnt signaling in SW480 and HCT116 cell lines. The miR-136 expression level inversely correlated with LRH-1 mRNA expression in colon cancer specimens. Moreover, overexpression of LRH-1 partially reversed the miR-136-induced antitumor effect in SW480 and HCT116 cell lines. Taken together, these findings suggest that miR-136 functions as a negative regulator in colon cancer progression by targeting LRH-1 and that miR-136 downregulation contributes to high expression of LRH-1 and aberrant activation of Wnt signaling, leaving open the possibility that miR-136 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for colon cancer.
Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) is an orphan nuclear receptor that is critical for the growth and proliferation of cancer cells and other biological processes, including lipid transportation and metabolism, sexual determination and steroidogenesis. However, because homozygous lrh-1-/- mice die in utero, the regulatory mechanisms involved in embryonic development mediated by this receptor are poorly understood. In the present study, we performed transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-mediated loss-of-function assays, taking advantage of zebrafish external fertilization, to investigate the function of lrh-1. The digestive organs were affected by lrh-1 depletion as a result of cell-cycle arrest (at the checkpoint of G1 to S phase), but not cell apoptosis. Biochemical analysis revealed that LRH-1 augments the transcriptional activity of β-catenin 1 and 2 via physical interactions. Screening the specific ligand(s) sensed by LRH-1 during organogenesis revealed that phosphatidylcholine (PC), a potential ligand, is the upstream target of LRH-1 during endoderm development. These data provide evidence for the crosstalk between the PC/LRH-1 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways during the expansion growth of endoderm organs.
Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) is a nuclear receptor that plays an important role in the regulation of bile acid biosynthesis, cholesterol reverse transport, steroidogenesis, and exocrine pancreatic enzyme production. In the current study, previously published data from a genome wide analysis of LRH-1 binding in the liver were re-analyzed to identify new LRH-1 targets and propose new roles for LRH-1 in the liver. Superoxide dismutase 2 (Sod2) was identified, which contains putative LRH-1 binding sites in the proximal promoter. When hepatocytes were treated with the LRH-1 agonist RJW101, Sod2 expression was dramatically increased and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which was induced by a high concentration of palmitate, was significantly reduced. A LRH-1 binding site was mapped to -288/-283 in the Sod2 promoter, which increased Sod2 promoter activity in response to LRH-1 and its agonist. LRH-1 binding to this site was confirmed using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. These results suggest that Sod2 is a target gene of LRH-1, and that LRH-1 agonists can mediate a reduction in ROS production and oxidative stress driven by an excess of fatty acids, as exhibited in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
BACKGROUND In view of the important function of nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH 1) in various biological processes and the physiological changes accompanying unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion (USRA), our study was carried out to investigate the potential roles of LRH-1 in USRA. MATERIAL AND METHODS Thirty patients with URSA at early the early state of pregnancy were selected, and 30 patients with normal early pregnancy were also selected from Aug 2015 to Sep 2016 as a control group. The expression of LRH-1 protein in decidua and villi were detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis, and the expression of LRH-1 mRNA was detected by RT-PCR. The expression levels of CYP19 and P450scc were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis at mRNA and protein levels, respectively. RESULTS The levels of LRH-1, CYP19, and P450scc mRNA and protein in villi of the patients in the URSA group were significantly lower than in the control group. There were no significant differences between the URSA group and control group in the levels of LRH-1, CYP19, and P450scc mRNA and protein in villi in decidua. CONCLUSIONS URSA was related to the reduced expression level of LRH-1 in villous tissues but not in decidua, and expression of LRH-1 may be related to the expression of CYP19 and P450scc. We believe that the expression level of LRH-1 can be used as a marker in the early diagnosis of URSA, and the regulation of LRH-1 expression many lead to new URSA treatments.
Pancreatic cancers depend on driver molecules, oncogene proteins such as RAS. NR5A2 protein is a transcription factor and either activates or inhibits transcription through actions at hundreds of enhancers. It has unusual properties with effects appearing in multiple signaling networks. NR5A2 is a pluripotency reprogramming factor in the class nuclear receptor. Its controlling hormone is PIP3. Experiments suggest NR5A2 activation drives PDAC and inhibitors blunt cancer cell proliferation.
The aberrant expression of miR-30d has been reported in several types of human malignancies. However, its biological function in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains largely unknown. In this study, we identified that miR‑30d was significantly downregulated in CRC tissues compared to that observed in normal controls as detected by RT‑qPCR analysis. Downregulation of miR‑30d was significantly associated with aggressive clinicopathological parameters including tumor differentiation, invasive depth, TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and poor prognosis. Furthermore, functional analysis revealed that overexpression of miR‑30d significantly inhibited cell proliferation, caused cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, suppressed cell migration and invasion, induced cell apoptosis in vitro, and decreased tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model. Bioinformatic analysis and dual‑luciferase reporter assay revealed that liver receptor homologue‑1 (LRH‑1) is a direct target of miR‑30d in CRC cells. Rescue assay showed that LRH‑1 overexpression could restore the inhibitory effect of miR‑30d on CRC cells. In addition, miR‑30d overexpression suppressed the activation of key components of the Wnt/β‑catenin signaling pathway, β‑catenin, c‑Myc and cyclin D1, which contributed to the inhibition of CRC development. Thus, our findings suggest that miR‑30d functions as a tumor suppressor against CRC development and miR‑30d/LRH‑1/Wnt signaling may be novel potential targets for CRC treatment.
CD95/Fas ligand (FasL) is a cell death-promoting member of the tumor necrosis factor family with important functions in the regulation of T-cell homeostasis and cytotoxicity. In T cells, FasL expression is tightly regulated on a transcriptional level involving a complex set of different transcription factors. The orphan nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1/NR5a2) is involved in the regulation of development, lipid metabolism and proliferation and is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues. However, its expression in T lymphocytes has never been reported so far. Based on in silico analysis, we identified potential LRH-1 binding sites within the FASLG promoter. Here, we report that LRH-1 is expressed in primary and secondary lymphatic tissues, as well as in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. LRH-1 directly binds to its binding sites in the FASLG promoter, and thereby drives FASLG promoter activity. Mutations in the LRH-1 binding sites reduce FASLG promoter activity. Pharmacological inhibition of LRH-1 decreases activation-induced FasL mRNA expression, as well as FasL-mediated activation-induced T-cell apoptosis and T-cell cytotoxicity. In a mouse model of Concanavalin A-induced and FasL-mediated hepatitis pharmacological inhibition of LRH-1 resulted in decreased hepatic FasL expression and a significant reduction of liver damage. In summary, these data show for the first time LRH-1 expression in T cells, its role in FASLG transcription and the potential of pharmacological inhibition of LRH-1 in the treatment of FasL-mediated immunopathologies.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated gamma coactivator 1-α (PGC1α) regulates energy metabolism by directly interacting with transcription factors to modulate gene expression. Among the PGC1α binding partners is liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1; NR5A2), an orphan nuclear hormone receptor that controls lipid and glucose homeostasis. Although PGC1α is known to bind and activate LRH-1, mechanisms through which PGC1α changes LRH-1 conformation to drive transcription are unknown. Here, we used biochemical and structural methods to interrogate the LRH-1-PGC1α complex. Purified, full-length LRH-1, as well as isolated ligand binding domain, bound to PGC1α with higher affinity than to the coactivator, nuclear receptor coactivator-2 (Tif2), in coregulator peptide recruitment assays. We present the first crystal structure of the LRH-1-PGC1α complex, which depicts several hydrophobic contacts and a strong charge clamp at the interface between these partners. In molecular dynamics simulations, PGC1α induced correlated atomic motion throughout the entire LRH-1 activation function surface, which was dependent on charge-clamp formation. In contrast, Tif2 induced weaker signaling at the activation function surface than PGC1α but promoted allosteric signaling from the helix 6/β-sheet region of LRH-1 to the activation function surface. These studies are the first to probe mechanisms underlying the LRH-1-PGC1α interaction and may illuminate strategies for selective therapeutic targeting of PGC1α-dependent LRH-1 signaling pathways.
Hepatic steatosis is caused by metabolic imbalances that could be explained in part by an increase in de novo lipogenesis that results from increased sterol element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) activity. The nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1) is an important regulator of intermediary metabolism in the liver, but its role in regulating lipogenesis is not well understood. Here, we have assessed the contribution of LRH-1 SUMOylation to the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Mice expressing a SUMOylation-defective mutant of LRH-1 (LRH-1 K289R mice) developed NAFLD and early signs of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) when challenged with a lipogenic, high-fat, high-sucrose diet. Moreover, we observed that the LRH-1 K289R mutation induced the expression of oxysterol binding protein-like 3 (OSBPL3), enhanced SREBP-1 processing, and promoted de novo lipogenesis. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that ectopic expression of OSBPL3 facilitates SREBP-1 processing in WT mice, while silencing hepatic Osbpl3 reverses the lipogenic phenotype of LRH-1 K289R mice. These findings suggest that compromised SUMOylation of LRH-1 promotes the development of NAFLD under lipogenic conditions through regulation of OSBPL3.
NR5A2 (aka LRH-1) has been identified as a pancreatic cancer susceptibility gene with missing biological link. This study aims to demonstrate expression and potential role of NR5A2 in pancreatic cancer. NR5A2 expression was quantified in resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and the normal adjacent tissues of 134 patients by immunohistochemistry. The intensity and extent of NR5A2 staining was quantified and analyzed in association with overall survival (OS). The impact of NR5A2 knockdown on pancreatic cancer stem cell (CSC) properties and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers was examined in cancer cells using RT-PCR and Western Blot. NR5A2 was overexpressed in pancreatic tumors, the IHC-staining H score (mean ± SE) was 96.4 ± 8.3 in normal versus 137.9 ± 8.2 in tumor tissues (P &lt; 0.0001). Patients with a higher NR5A2 expression had a median survival time 18.4 months compared to 23.7 months for those with low IHC H scores (P = 0.019). The hazard ratio of death (95% confidence interval) was 1.60 (1.07-2.41) after adjusting for disease stage and tumor grade (P = 0.023). NR5A2 was highly expressed in pancreatic cancer sphere forming cells. NR5A2-inhibition by siRNA was associated with reduced sphere formation and decreased levels of CSCs markers NANOG, OCT4, LIN28B, and NOTCH1. NR5A2 knockdown also resulted in reduced expression of FGB, MMP2, MMP3, MMMP9, SNAIL, and TWIST, increased expression of epithelial markers E-cadherin and β-catenin, and a lower expression of mesenchymal marker Vimentin. Taken together, our findings suggest that NR5A2 could play a role in CSC stemness and EMT in pancreatic cancer, which may contribute to the worse clinical outcome.
Oct4 is a transcription factor required for maintaining pluripotency and self-renewal in stem cells. Prior to differentiation, Oct4 must be silenced to allow for the development of the three germ layers in the developing embryo. This fine-tuning is controlled by the nuclear receptors (NRs), liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) and germ cell nuclear factor (GCNF). Liver receptor homolog-1 is responsible for driving the expression of Oct4 where GCNF represses its expression upon differentiation. Both receptors bind to a DR0 motif located within the Oct4 promoter. Here, we present the first structure of mouse GCNF DNA-binding domain in complex with the Oct4 DR0. The overall structure revealed two molecules bound in a head-to-tail fashion on opposite sides of the DNA. Additionally, we solved the structure of the human LRH-1 DNA-binding domain bound to the same element. We explore the structural elements that govern Oct4 recognition by these two NRs.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are reportedly involved in gastric cancer development and progression. In particular, miR-219-5p has been reported to be a tumor-associated miRNA in human cancer. However, the role of miR-219-5p in gastric cancer remains unclear. In this study, we investigated for the first time the potential role and underlying mechanism of miR-219-5p in the proliferation, migration, and invasion of human gastric cancer cells. miR-219-5p was found to be markedly decreased in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines compared with adjacent tissues and normal gastric epithelial cells. miR-219-5p mimics or anti-miR-219-5p was transfected into gastric cancer cell lines to overexpress or suppress miR-219-5p expression, respectively. Results showed that miR-219-5p overexpression significantly decreased the proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric cancer cells. Conversely, miR-219-5p suppression demonstrated a completely opposite effect. Bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assays indicated that miR-219-5p targeted the 3'-untranslated region of the liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1), a well-characterized oncogene. Furthermore, miR-219-5p inhibited the mRNA and protein levels of LRH-1. LRH-1 mRNA expression was inversely correlated with miR-219-5p expression in gastric cancer tissues. miR-219-5p overexpression significantly decreased the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in gastric cancer cells. Additionally, LRH-1 restoration can markedly reverse miR-219-5p-mediated tumor suppressive effects. Our study suggests that miR-219-5p regulated the proliferation, migration, and invasion of human gastric cancer cells by suppressing LRH-1. miR-219-5p may be a potential target for gastric cancer therapy.
Liver receptor homolog 1 (NR5A2, LRH-1) is an orphan nuclear hormone receptor that regulates diverse biological processes, including metabolism, proliferation, and the resolution of endoplasmic reticulum stress. Although preclinical and cellular studies demonstrate that LRH-1 has great potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic diseases and cancer, development of LRH-1 modulators has been difficult. Recently, systematic modifications to one of the few known chemical scaffolds capable of activating LRH-1 failed to improve efficacy substantially. Moreover, mechanisms through which LRH-1 is activated by synthetic ligands are entirely unknown. Here, we use x-ray crystallography and other structural methods to explore conformational changes and receptor-ligand interactions associated with LRH-1 activation by a set of related agonists. Unlike phospholipid LRH-1 ligands, these agonists bind deep in the pocket and do not interact with residues near the mouth nor do they expand the pocket like phospholipids. Unexpectedly, two closely related agonists with similar efficacies (GSK8470 and RJW100) exhibit completely different binding modes. The dramatic repositioning is influenced by a differential ability to establish stable face-to-face π-π-stacking with the LRH-1 residue His-390, as well as by a novel polar interaction mediated by the RJW100 hydroxyl group. The differing binding modes result in distinct mechanisms of action for the two agonists. Finally, we identify a network of conserved water molecules near the ligand-binding site that are important for activation by both agonists. This work reveals a previously unappreciated complexity associated with LRH-1 agonist development and offers insights into rational design strategies.
The stepwise progression of common endoderm progenitors into differentiated liver and pancreas organs is regulated by a dynamic array of signals that are not well understood. The nuclear receptor subfamily 5, group A, member 2 gene nr5a2, also known as Liver receptor homolog-1 (Lrh-1) is expressed in several tissues including the developing liver and pancreas. Here, we interrogate the role of Nr5a2 at multiple developmental stages using genetic and chemical approaches and uncover novel pleiotropic requirements during zebrafish liver and pancreas development. Zygotic loss of nr5a2 in a targeted genetic null mutant disrupted the development of the exocrine pancreas and liver, while leaving the endocrine pancreas intact. Loss of nr5a2 abrogated exocrine pancreas markers such as trypsin, while pancreas progenitors marked by ptf1a or pdx1 remained unaffected, suggesting a role for Nr5a2 in regulating pancreatic acinar cell differentiation. In the developing liver, Nr5a2 regulates hepatic progenitor outgrowth and differentiation, as nr5a2 mutants exhibited reduced hepatoblast markers hnf4α and prox1 as well as differentiated hepatocyte marker fabp10a. Through the first in vivo use of Nr5a2 chemical antagonist Cpd3, the iterative requirement for Nr5a2 for exocrine pancreas and liver differentiation was temporally elucidated: chemical inhibition of Nr5a2 function during hepatopancreas progenitor specification was sufficient to disrupt exocrine pancreas formation and enhance the size of the embryonic liver, suggesting that Nr5a2 regulates hepatic vs. pancreatic progenitor fate choice. Chemical inhibition of Nr5a2 at a later time during pancreas and liver differentiation was sufficient to block the formation of mature acinar cells and hepatocytes. These findings define critical iterative and pleiotropic roles for Nr5a2 at distinct stages of pancreas and liver organogenesis, and provide novel perspectives for interpreting the role of Nr5a2 in disease.
Conventional efforts relying on high-throughput physical and virtual screening of large compound libraries have failed to yield high-efficiency chemical probes for many of the 48 human nuclear receptors. Here, we investigated whether disulfide-trapping, an approach new to nuclear receptors, would provide effective lead compounds targeting human liver receptor homolog 1 (hLRH-1, NR5A2). Despite the fact that hLRH-1 contains a large ligand binding pocket and binds phospholipids with high affinity, existing synthetic hLRH-1 ligands are of limited utility due to poor solubility, low efficacy or significant off-target effects. Using disulfide-trapping, we identified a lead compound that conjugates with remarkably high-efficiency to a native cysteine residue (Cys346) lining the hydrophobic cavity in the ligand binding domain of hLRH-1. Guided by computational modeling and cellular assays, the lead compound was elaborated into ligands PME8 and PME9 that bind hLRH-1 reversibly (no cysteine reactivity) and increase hLRH-1 activity in cells. When compared with the existing hLRH-1 synthetic agonist RJW100, both PME8 and PME9 showed comparable induction of the LRH-1 dependent target gene CYP24A1 in human HepG2 cells, beginning as early as 3 h after drug treatment. The induction is specific as siRNA-mediated knock-down of hLRH-1 renders both PME8 and PME9 ineffective. These data show that PME8 and PME9 are potent activators of hLRH-1 and suggest that with further development this lead series may yield useful chemical probes for manipulating LRH-1 activity in vivo. 
Various tumors develop addiction to glutamine to support uncontrolled cell proliferation. Here we identify the nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1) as a key regulator in the process of hepatic tumorigenesis through the coordination of a noncanonical glutamine pathway that is reliant on the mitochondrial and cytosolic transaminases glutamate pyruvate transaminase 2 (GPT2) and glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 1 (GOT1), which fuel anabolic metabolism. In particular, we show that gain and loss of function of hepatic LRH-1 modulate the expression and activity of mitochondrial glutaminase 2 (GLS2), the first and rate-limiting step of this pathway. Acute and chronic deletion of hepatic LRH-1 blunts the deamination of glutamine and reduces glutamine-dependent anaplerosis. The robust reduction in glutaminolysis and the limiting availability of α-ketoglutarate in turn inhibit mTORC1 signaling to eventually block cell growth and proliferation. Collectively, these studies highlight the importance of LRH-1 in coordinating glutamine-induced metabolism and signaling to promote hepatocellular carcinogenesis.
Nuclear receptors (NR) act as an integrated conduit for environmental and hormonal signals to govern genomic responses, which relate to cell fate decisions. We review how their integrated actions with each other, shared co-factors and other transcription factors are disrupted in cancer. Steroid hormone nuclear receptors are oncogenic drivers in breast and prostate cancer and blockade of signaling is a major therapeutic goal. By contrast to blockade of receptors, in other cancers enhanced receptor function is attractive, as illustrated initially with targeting of retinoic acid receptors in leukemia. In the post-genomic era large consortia, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas, have developed a remarkable volume of genomic data with which to examine multiple aspects of nuclear receptor status in a pan-cancer manner. Therefore to extend the review of NR function we have also undertaken bioinformatics analyses of NR expression in over 3000 tumors, spread across six different tumor types (bladder, breast, colon, head and neck, liver and prostate). Specifically, to ask how the NR expression was distorted (altered expression, mutation and CNV) we have applied bootstrapping approaches to simulate data for comparison, and also compared these NR findings to 12 other transcription factor families. Nuclear receptors were uniquely and uniformly downregulated across all six tumor types, more than predicted by chance. These approaches also revealed that each tumor type had a specific NR expression profile but these were most similar between breast and prostate cancer. Some NRs were down-regulated in at least five tumor types (e.g. NR3C2/MR and NR5A2/LRH-1)) whereas others were uniquely down-regulated in one tumor (e.g. NR1B3/RARG). The downregulation was not driven by copy number variation or mutation and epigenetic mechanisms maybe responsible for the altered nuclear receptor expression.
Through evolution, most of the living species have acquired a time keeping system to anticipate daily changes caused by the rotation of the Earth. In all of the systems this pacemaker is based on a molecular transcriptional/translational negative feedback loop able to generate rhythmic gene expression with a period close to 24 hours. Recent evidences suggest that post-transcriptional regulations activated mostly by systemic cues play a fundamental role in the process, fine tuning the time keeping system and linking it to animal physiology. Among these signals, we consider the role of lipid transport and metabolism regulated by SCP2. Mice harboring a deletion of the Scp2 locus present a modulated diurnal accumulation of lipids in the liver and a perturbed activation of several signaling pathways including PPARα, SREBP, LRH-1, TORC1 and its upstream regulators. This defect in signaling pathways activation feedbacks upon the clock by lengthening the circadian period of animals through post-translational regulation of core clock regulators, showing that rhythmic lipid transport is a major player in the establishment of rhythmic mRNA and protein expression landscape. 
What initiates the pubertal process in humans and other mammals is still unknown. We hypothesized that gene(s) taking roles in triggering human puberty may be identified by studying a cohort of idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH).
A cohort of IHH cases was studied based on autozygosity mapping coupled with whole exome sequencing.
Our studies revealed three independent families in which IHH/delayed puberty is associated with inactivating SRA1 variants. SRA1 was the first gene to be identified to function through its protein as well as noncoding functional ribonucleic acid products. These products act as co-regulators of nuclear receptors including sex steroid receptors as well as SF-1 and LRH-1, the master regulators of steroidogenesis. Functional studies with a mutant SRA1 construct showed a reduced co-activation of ligand-dependent activity of the estrogen receptor alpha, as assessed by luciferase reporter assay in HeLa cells.
Our findings strongly suggest that SRA1 gene function is required for initiation of puberty in humans. Furthermore, SRA1 with its alternative products and functionality may provide a potential explanation for the versatility and complexity of the pubertal process.
Liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1) plays a critical role in hepatic metabolism and disease. Here we show that LRH-1 protein stability is regulated by the cullin 4 (CUL4) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. We found that DNA damage-binding protein 2 (DDB2) directly interacts with LRH-1 and functions as a substrate recognition component of CUL4-DDB1 to promote LRH-1 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. In human hepatoma (HepG2) cells, we observed that protein levels of endogenous LRH-1 are increased by insulin without a change in mRNA levels of LRH-1. However, overexpression of DDB2 impaired the insulin-stimulated increase in LRH-1 levels. In addition, DDB2 overexpression decreased LRH-1 transcriptional activation and expression of target genes, such as glucokinase, whereas knockdown of DDB2 increased the expression of glucokinase. Finally, we demonstrated that DDB2 knockdown increases glucose uptake and intracellular levels of glucose-6-phosphate in HepG2 cells. Our study reveals a novel regulatory mechanism of LRH-1 activity and suggests a role for DDB2 in hepatic glucose metabolism.
Nuclear receptors are intracellular proteins that act as transcription factors. Proteins with classic nuclear receptor domain structure lacking identified signaling ligands are designated orphan nuclear receptors. Two of these, steroidogenic factor-1 (NR5A1, also known as SF-1) and liver receptor homolog-1 (NR5A2, also known as LRH-1), bind to the same DNA sequences, with different and nonoverlapping effects on targets. Endogenous regulation of both is achieved predominantly by cofactor interactions. SF-1 is expressed primarily in steroidogenic tissues, LRH-1 in tissues of endodermal origin and the gonads. Both receptors modulate cholesterol homeostasis, steroidogenesis, tissue-specific cell proliferation, and stem cell pluripotency. LRH-1 is essential for development beyond gastrulation and SF-1 for genesis of the adrenal, sexual differentiation, and Leydig cell function. Ovary-specific depletion of SF-1 disrupts follicle development, while LRH-1 depletion prevents ovulation, cumulus expansion, and luteinization. Uterine depletion of LRH-1 compromises decidualization and pregnancy. In humans, SF-1 is present in endometriotic tissue, where it regulates estrogen synthesis. SF-1 is underexpressed in ovarian cancer cells and overexpressed in Leydig cell tumors. In breast cancer cells, proliferation, migration and invasion, and chemotherapy resistance are regulated by LRH-1. In conclusion, the NR5A orphan nuclear receptors are nonredundant factors that are crucial regulators of a panoply of biological processes, across multiple reproductive tissues.
In this study, the effect of n-3 fatty acids (FA) [α-linolenic acid (ALA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)] on the intestinal bile acid (BA) uptake, hepatic BA synthesis, and enterohepatic bile acid transporters (BAT) was assessed in young and aged dyslipidemic rats. Dyslipidemia was induced in young and aged rats by feeding a high-fat (HF) diet. Experimental groups received diets containing canola oil (HF + CNO) and fish oil (HF + FO) as a source of ALA and EPA + DHA, respectively. After 60 days of feeding, intestinal BA uptake and expression of apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (Asbt), organic solute transporter-alpha/beta (Osta/b) messenger RNA (mRNA), and hepatic expression of Na+ taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (Ntcp), bile salt export pump (Bsep), cholesterol 7-α hydroxylase A1 (Cyp7a1), Farnesoid X receptor (Fxr), small heterodimer partner-1 (Shp), liver receptor homolog-1 (Lrh-1), and hepatic nuclear factor-4 alpha (Hnf4a) mRNA were measured. Hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity and total BA in serum, liver, and feces were assessed. The dyslipidemic HF group had: (1) increased intestinal BA uptake and Asbt and Osta/b mRNA expression, (2) increased BA in serum, (3) decreased hepatic expression of Ntcp, Bsep, and Cyp7a1 mRNA, (4) increased activity of HMG-CoA reductase, (5) increased hepatic expression of Fxr and Shp mRNA, (6) decreased hepatic expression of Lrh-1 and Hnf4a mRNA, and (7) decreased BA in feces, when compared to control, HF + CNO, and HF + FO groups. Immunostaining revealed increased expression of intestinal Asbt and hepatic Ntcp protein in the HF group when compared to control, HF + CNO, and HF + FO groups. n-3 FA abrogated dyslipidemia-induced changes in the intestinal uptake, hepatic synthesis, and enterohepatic transporters of BA in both young and aged rats. EPA + DHA was more effective than ALA in modulating dyslipidemia-induced changes.
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are devastating chronic immunopathologies of the intestinal mucosa, which are frequently treated by immunosuppressive glucocorticoids. Endogenous glucocorticoids are not only produced by the adrenal glands, but also by the intestinal epithelium. Local glucocorticoid synthesis critically contributes to the immune homeostasis of the intestinal mucosa. As defective intestinal glucocorticoid synthesis has been associated with the development of IBD, we investigated the expression of steroidogenic enzymes and the key transcriptional regulator Liver Receptor Homolog-1 (LRH-1/NR5A2) in ileal and colonic biopsies human pediatric IBD and control patients. Furthermore, the induction of steroidogenic enzymes and their transcriptional regulation by LRH-1 was investigated in a mouse model of experimental colitis. These analyses revealed that colitis-induced expression of steroidogenic enzymes in the murine colon is dependent on the presence of LRH-1, as intestinal deletion of LRH-1 strongly reduced their colitis-induced expression. Similarly, a strong correlation between the expression of LRH-1 and different steroidogenic enzymes was seen in intestinal biopsies of human pediatric patients. Importantly, reduced expression of hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 11B1 (HSD11B1) was observed in IBD patients compared to control patients, suggesting that defective local reactivation of glucocorticoids could contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD.
Altered expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) by environmental chemicals modulates the expression of xenobiotic biotransformation-related genes and may serve as therapeutic targets and novel biomarkers of exposure. The pregnane X receptor (PXR/NR1I2) is a critical xenobiotic-sensing nuclear receptor that regulates the expression of many drug-processing genes, and it has similar target-gene profiles and DNA-binding motifs with another xenobiotic-sensing nuclear receptor, namely, constitutive andronstrane receptor (CAR/Nr1i3). To test our hypothesis that lncRNAs are regulated by PXR in concert with protein-coding genes (PCGs) and to compare the PXR-targeted lncRNAs with CAR-targeted lncRNAs, RNA-Seq was performed from livers of adult male C57BL/6 mice treated with corn oil, the PXR agonist PCN, or the CAR agonist 1, 4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene (TCPOBOP). Among 125,680 known lncRNAs, 3843 were expressed in liver, and 193 were differentially regulated by PXR (among which 40% were also regulated by CAR). Most PXR- or CAR-regulated lncRNAs were mapped to the introns and 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of PCGs, as well as intergenic regions. Combining the RNA-Seq data with a published PXR chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing; cytochrome P450 (P450; ChIP-Seq) data set, we identified 774 expressed lncRNAs with direct PXR-DNA binding sites, and 26.8% of differentially expressed lncRNAs had changes in PXR-DNA binding after PCN exposure. De novo motif analysis identified colocalization of PXR with liver receptor homolog (LRH-1), which regulates bile acid synthesis after PCN exposure. There was limited overlap of PXR binding with an epigenetic mark for transcriptional activation (histone-H3K4-di-methylation, H3K4me2) but no overlap with epigenetic marks for transcriptional silencing [H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3) and DNA methylation]. Among differentially expressed lncRNAs, 264 were in proximity of PCGs, and the lncRNA-PCG pairs displayed a high coregulatory pattern by PXR and CAR activation. This study was among the first to demonstrate that lncRNAs are regulated by PXR and CAR activation and that they may be important regulators of PCGs involved in xenobiotic metabolism.
The role of small heterodimer partner (SHP) in regulation of xenobiotic detoxification remains elusive. Here, we uncover a critical role for SHP in circadian regulation of cytochromes P450 (CYPs) and drug-induced hepatotoxicity. Methods: The mRNA and protein levels of CYPs in the livers of wild-type and SHP-/- mice were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, respectively. Regulation of CYP by SHP was investigated using luciferase reporter, mobility shift, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and/or co-immunoprecipitation assays. Results: The circadian rhythmicities of xenobiotic-detoxifying CYP mRNAs and proteins were disrupted in SHP-deficient mice. Of note, SHP ablation up-regulated Cyp2c38 and Cyp2c39, whereas it down-regulated all other CYP genes. Moreover, SHP regulated the expression of CYP genes through different mechanisms. SHP repressed Lrh-1/Hnf4α to down-regulate Cyp2c38, E4bp4 to up-regulate Cyp2a5, Dec2/HNF1α axis to up-regulate Cyp1a2, Cyp2e1 and Cyp3a11, and Rev-erbα to up-regulate Cyp2b10, Cyp4a10 and Cyp4a14. Furthermore, SHP ablation sensitized mice to theophylline (or mitoxantrone)-induced toxicity. Higher level of toxicity was correlated with down-regulated metabolism and clearance of theophylline (or mitoxantrone). In contrast, SHP ablation blunted the circadian rhythmicity of acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity and alleviated the toxicity by down-regulating Cyp2e1-mediated metabolism and reducing formation of the toxic metabolite. Toxicity alleviation by SHP ablation was also observed for aflatoxin B1 due to reduced formation of the toxic epoxide metabolite. Conclusion: SHP participates in circadian regulation of CYP enzymes, thereby impacting xenobiotic metabolism and drug-induced hepatotoxicity.
The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the intestine is involved in the regulation of inflammation, apoptosis and tissue fibrosis in experimental models of colitis; the inhibition of local RAS by pharmacologic interventions has been claimed to prevent and alleviate colitis. In this study, we compared the benefits of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril, an angiotensin receptor blocker, losartan and their combination in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in mice by assessing the histopathological and macroscopic changes in the colon, and by measuring the expression of the pro-inflammatory interleukin 1beta (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnf-α) genes. We also examined the consequences of these interventions on colonic angiotensin-converting enzyme protein and its ectodomain shedding as well as gene expression of RAS components, Agt and Ace, and corticosterone synthesis and its components, Lrh-1 and Cyp11b1. Both enalapril and losartan alleviated colitis by reducing the inflammatory cell infiltrate in colon. In addition, enalapril downregulated the pro-inflammatory IL-1β expression whereas losartan treatment resulted in lower macroscopic scores, but the effects of the medications were not synergistic when the drugs were combined. ACE-ectodomain shedding was enhanced in the distal colon in DSS colitis. We found no evidence that ACE inhibition or angiotensin receptor blockade altered intestinal RAS or corticosterone synthesis. We conclude that some of the benefits of ACE inhibition and angiotensin receptor blockade might differ in the treatment of colitis, but their combination is unlikely to confer additional benefits.
The orphan nuclear receptor Liver Receptor Homologue-1 (LRH-1) is an emerging drug target for metabolic disorders. The most effective known LRH-1 modulators are phospholipids or synthetic hexahydropentalene compounds. While both classes have micromolar efficacy, they target different portions of the ligand binding pocket and activate LRH-1 through different mechanisms. Guided by crystallographic data, we combined aspects of both ligand classes into a single scaffold, resulting in the most potent and efficacious LRH-1 agonists to date.
Epithelial dysfunction and crypt destruction are defining features of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, current IBD therapies targeting epithelial dysfunction are lacking. The nuclear receptor LRH-1 (NR5A2) is expressed in intestinal epithelium and thought to contribute to epithelial renewal. Here we show that LRH-1 maintains intestinal epithelial health and protects against inflammatory damage. Knocking out LRH-1 in murine intestinal organoids reduces Notch signaling, increases crypt cell death, distorts the cellular composition of the epithelium, and weakens the epithelial barrier. Human LRH-1 (hLRH-1) rescues epithelial integrity and when overexpressed, mitigates inflammatory damage in murine and human intestinal organoids, including those derived from IBD patients. Finally, hLRH-1 greatly reduces disease severity in T-cell-mediated murine colitis. Together with the failure of a ligand-incompetent hLRH-1 mutant to protect against TNFα-damage, these findings provide compelling evidence that hLRH-1 mediates epithelial homeostasis and is an attractive target for intestinal disease.
Phosphoinositide membrane signaling is critical for normal physiology, playing well-known roles in diverse human pathologies. The basic mechanisms governing phosphoinositide signaling within the nucleus, however, have remained deeply enigmatic owing to their presence outside the nuclear membranes. Over 40% of nuclear phosphoinositides can exist in this non-membrane state, held soluble in the nucleoplasm by nuclear proteins that remain largely unidentified. Recently, two nuclear proteins responsible for solubilizing phosphoinositides were identified, steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1; NR5A1) and liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1; NR5A2), along with two enzymes that directly remodel these phosphoinositide/protein complexes, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN; MMAC) and inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK; ipk2). These new footholds now permit the assignment of physiological functions for nuclear phosphoinositides in human diseases, such as endometriosis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/steatohepatitis, glioblastoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The unique nature of nuclear phosphoinositide signaling affords extraordinary clinical opportunities for new biomarkers, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Thus, phosphoinositide biology within the nucleus may represent the next generation of low-hanging fruit for new drugs, not unlike what has occurred for membrane phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase drug development. This review connects recent basic science discoveries in nuclear phosphoinositide signaling to clinical pathologies, with the hope of inspiring development of new therapies.
The nuclear receptor Small Heterodimer Partner (SHP) is a transcriptional target and inhibitor of Liver Receptor Homolog 1 (LRH-1), the transcriptional regulator of intestinal glucocorticoid (GC) synthesis. The role of SHP in the regulation of intestinal GC synthesis and its impact on T cell-mediated anti-viral immune responses in the intestinal mucosa are currently not understood. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection promoted intestinal GC synthesis, which was enhanced in SHP-deficient mice. Intestinal GC suppressed the expansion and altered the activation of virus-specific T cells. In contrast, deletion of LRH-1 reduced intestinal GC synthesis and accelerated the expansion of cytotoxic T cells post LCMV infection. These findings show that virus-induced intestinal GC synthesis is controlled by LRH-1 and SHP, and that local steroidogenesis contributes to the maintenance of intestinal immune homeostasis. Thus, LRH-1-regulated intestinal GC synthesis could represent an interesting therapeutic target in the treatment of inflammatory disorders.
Liver receptor homologue 1 (LRH-1) is an orphan nuclear receptor that is highly expressed in a variety of cancer tissues, promotes tumor cell proliferation and metastasis, and is involved in the tumor cell cycle and apoptosis. The aim of the present study was to assess the association between the expression of LRH-1 and the prognosis of patients with colon cancer. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of LRH1 in 128 cases of colon cancer and adjacent tissues. The 5-year survival rate was obtained from telephone follow-up data, outpatient review and through access to medical records. Positive expression of LRH-1 was found in 108/128 colon cancer samples, compared with 17/128 normal tissues. Statistical analysis showed that positive LRH-1 expression was significantly associated with clinical pathological stage, depth of invasion and lymph node metastasis. The overall survival (OS) rate of patients with positive LRH-1 expression was significantly lower than that of patients with low expression. Multivariate analysis showed that LRH-1 expression could be used as an independent predictor of OS. In conclusion, the present findings suggest that LRH-1 may serve an important role in the development and progression of colon cancer, with potential value as a prognostic molecular marker that could be used to assist in the diagnosis and evaluation of colon cancer. LRH-1 may become a target for novel therapies for patients with colon cancer.
To explore potential therapeutic target is one of the areas of great interest in both clinical and basic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) studies. Nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1, NR5A2) is proved to play a positive role in several cancers including breast cancer, pancreatic cancer and intestinal cancer in recent years. However, the exact role of LRH-1 in the development and progression of HCC is not fully elucidated.
The LRH-1 expression level in HCC clinical samples was examined by immunohis-tochemistry (IHC). Stable LRH-1-suppressed HepG2 clones (HepG2LRH-1/-) were generated by transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and both in vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted.
We confirmed that LRH-1 showed an increased expression pattern in HCC clinical samples. Our in vitro and in vivo results indicated that suppression of LRH-1 in HepG2 significantly attenuated its proliferation rate and tumorigenic capacity. Gene expression microarray analysis indicated that LRH-1mostly regulated gene expression involved in cell cycle. In addition, our gain-of-function experiments indicated that ectopic expression of LRH-1 dramatically induced the mRNA and protein levels of c-myc and cyclin E1, while attenuating the expression of p21.
Our results suggest that LRH-1 might be a potential therapeutic target for clinical HCC treatment.
To explore the genetic relationships between LRH-1 (rs2816948), CYP19 (rs727479 and rs700518), and P450scc (rs4077582) as a potential mechanism behind unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortions in a Chinese Han population. A case-control study was used and featured two groups: Patients with unexplained recurrent miscarriage (n = 82, abortion group) and those who voluntary surrendered of a normal early pregnancy (n = 97, control group). Abortion villi samples were obtained from all patients. Genomic DNA was later extracted and sequenced, after which statistical analyses performed to assess the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms and unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortions. There were significant differences in the genotypic and allelic distribution (p &lt; .05) for CYP19 (rs727479) between the abortion and the control groups. There were no significant differences in the genotypic or allelic distributions (p &gt; .05) for either the LRH-1 (rs2816948) or CYP19 (rs700518). There were also significant genotypic differences (p &lt; .05) for P450scc (rs4077582), but no significant differences for its allelic distribution (p &gt; .05). There was a significant correlation between the occurrence of unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion and CYP19 (rs727479) single nucleotide polymorphisms.
摘要 本研究将探讨LRH-1（rs2816948）, CYP19（rs727479和rs700518）和P450scc（rs4077582）作为中国汉族人群原因不明的复发性自然流产的潜在机制之间的遗传关系。采用病例对照研究, 分为两组：原因不明的复发性流产患者（n = 82, 流产组）和自愿放弃正常早孕的患者（n = 97, 对照组）。从所有患者获得流产绒毛样品, 随后提取基因组DNA并测序, 之后进行统计分析以评估单核苷酸多态性与不明原因的复发性自然流产之间的关系。在流产和对照组之间, CYP19（rs727479）的基因型和等位基因分布（p &lt;.05）存在显著差异。对于LRH-1（rs2816948）或CYP19（rs700518）, 基因型或等位基因分布（p&gt; .05）没有显著差异。 P450scc（rs4077582）也存在显著的基因型差异（p &lt;.05）, 但其等位基因分布没有显著差异（p&gt; .05）。 不明原因复发性自然流产的发生与CYP19（rs727479）单核苷酸多态性之间存在显著相关性。.
Organic anion transporter 2 (OAT2/SLC22A7) is an uptake transporter that plays an important role in drug disposition. Here, we investigate a potential role of liver receptor homolog-1 (Lrh-1) in regulation of Oat2 and docetaxel pharmacokinetics. Hepatoma cells (Hepa1-6 and HepG2 cells) were transfected with Lrh-1/LRH-1 expression vector or siRNA. The relative mRNA and protein levels of Oat2/OAT2 in the cells or livers of Lrh-1hep-/- mice were determined by qPCR and Western blotting, respectively. Transcriptional regulation of Oat2/OAT2 by Lrh-1/LRH-1 was investigated using luciferase reporter, mobility shift, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed with wild-type (Lrh-1fl/fl) and Lrh-1hep-/- mice after intraperitoneal injection of docetaxel. Overexpression of Lrh-1 in Hepa1-6 cells led to significant increases in Oat2 mRNA and protein. Consistently, Lrh-1 knockdown caused decreases in Oat2 mRNA and protein, as well as reduced cellular uptake of PGE2, a prototypical substrate of Oat2. Similarly, an activation effect of LRH-1 on OAT2 expression was observed in HepG2 cells. In addition, the levels of Oat2 mRNA and protein were markedly reduced in Lrh-1hep-/- mice. Lrh-1/LRH-1 induced the transcription of Oat2/OAT2 in luciferase reporter assays. Truncation analysis revealed a potential Lrh-1 response element (-716- to -702-bp) in Oat2 promoter. Direct binding of Lrh-1 to this response element was confirmed by mobility shift and ChIP assays. Furthermore, systemic exposure of docetaxel was upregulated in Lrh-1hep-/- mice due to reduced hepatic uptake. In conclusion, Lrh-1 transcriptionally regulates Oat2, thereby impacting tissue uptake and pharmacokinetics of Oat2 substrates.
Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is due to the selective destruction of islet beta cells by immune cells. Current therapies focused on repressing the immune attack or stimulating beta cell regeneration still have limited clinical efficacy. Therefore, it is timely to identify innovative targets to dampen the immune process, while promoting beta cell survival and function. Liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1) is a nuclear receptor that represses inflammation in digestive organs, and protects pancreatic islets against apoptosis. Here, we show that BL001, a small LRH-1 agonist, impedes hyperglycemia progression and the immune-dependent inflammation of pancreas in murine models of T1DM, and beta cell apoptosis in islets of type 2 diabetic patients, while increasing beta cell mass and insulin secretion. Thus, we suggest that LRH-1 agonism favors a dialogue between immune and islet cells, which could be druggable to protect against diabetes mellitus.
Ovarian retinoid homeostasis plays an important role in the physiological function of the ovary. Retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) acts as the mediator for the systemic and intercellular transport of retinol and is heavily involved in cellular retinol influx, efflux, and exchange. However, the expression patterns and regulatory mechanisms of Rbp4 in the ovary remain unclear.
The expression pattern of ovarian Rbp4 was examined in immature mice during different developmental stages and in adult mice during different stages of the estrous cycle. The potential regulation and mechanisms of ovarian Rbp4 expression by estrogen and related gonadotropins in mouse ovaries were also investigated.
The present study demonstrated that the ovarian expression of Rbp4 remained constant before puberty and increased significantly in the peripubertal period. In adult female mice, the expression of Rbp4 increased at proestrus and peaked at estrus at both the mRNA and protein levels. The protein distribution of RBP4 was mainly localized in the granulosa cell and theca cell layer in follicles. In addition, the expression of Rbp4 was significantly induced by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) or FSH + luteinizing hormone (LH) in combination in immature mouse (3 weeks old) ovaries in vivo and in granulosa cells cultured in vitro, both at the mRNA and protein levels. In contrast, treatment with LH or 17β-estradiol did not exhibit any observable effects on ovarian Rbp4 expression. Transcription factors high-mobility group AT-hook 1 (HMGA1), steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1), and liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1) (which have been previously shown to be involved in activation of Rbp4 transcription), also responded to FSH stimulation. In addition, H-89, an inhibitor of protein kinase A (PKA), and the depletion of HMGA1, SF-1, and LRH-1 by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), resulted in a dramatic loss of the induction of Rbp4 expression by FSH at both the mRNA and protein levels.
These data indicate that the dynamic expression of Rbp4 is mainly regulated by FSH through the cAMP-PKA pathway, involving transcriptional factors HMGA1, SF-1, and LRH-1, in the mouse ovary during different stages of development and the estrous cycle.
The present study aimed to investigate the role of microRNA (miR)-219-5p in spinal cord injury (SCI) and to examine the underlying molecular mechanism. SCI rat and cell models were conducted in the current study, while reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to detect the level of miR-219-5p in the SCI mice and neurons. Bioinformatics analysis was applied to predict the target genes of miR-219-5p, and dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to verify the prediction. In addition, MTT assay and flow cytometry were conducted to determine the cell viability and cell apoptosis of the neurons, respectively. Western blot analysis was also performed to detect the expression of associated proteins. The study results demonstrated that miR-219-5p was highly expressed in SCI mice and neurons, and directly targets liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1). The neuron viability was significantly reduced by SCI, however, it was recovered upon transfection with an miR-219-5p inhibitor. Neuron apoptosis was notably induced by SCI and inhibited by miR-219-5p inhibition. The LRH-1/Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was also inhibited by SCI, while it was significantly enhanced by the miR-219-5p inhibitor. Furthermore, LRH-1 overexpression eliminated the effects of the miR-219-5p inhibitor on SCI. In conclusion, these data indicated that the miR-219-5p inhibitor served a protective role in SCI via regulating the LRH-1/Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
Excess lipid accumulation is an early signature of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Although liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1) (encoded by NR5A2) is suppressed in human NAFLD, evidence linking this phospholipid-bound nuclear receptor to hepatic lipid metabolism is lacking. Here, we report an essential role for LRH-1 in hepatic lipid storage and phospholipid composition based on an acute hepatic KO of LRH-1 in adult mice (LRH-1AAV8-Cre mice). Indeed, LRH-1-deficient hepatocytes exhibited large cytosolic lipid droplets and increased triglycerides (TGs). LRH-1-deficient mice fed high-fat diet displayed macrovesicular steatosis, liver injury, and glucose intolerance, all of which were reversed or improved by expressing wild-type human LRH-1. While hepatic lipid synthesis decreased and lipid export remained unchanged in mutants, elevated circulating free fatty acid helped explain the lipid imbalance in LRH-1AAV8-Cre mice. Lipidomic and genomic analyses revealed that loss of LRH-1 disrupts hepatic phospholipid composition, leading to lowered arachidonoyl (AA) phospholipids due to repression of Elovl5 and Fads2, two critical genes in AA biosynthesis. Our findings reveal a role for the phospholipid sensor LRH-1 in maintaining adequate pools of hepatic AA phospholipids, further supporting the idea that phospholipid diversity is an important contributor to healthy hepatic lipid storage.
Targeting of steroidogenic enzymes (e.g., abiraterone acetate targeting CYP17A1) has been developed as a novel therapeutic strategy against metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, resistance to steroidal inhibitors inevitably develops in patients, the mechanisms of which remain largely unknown. Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1, NR5A2) is a nuclear receptor, originally characterized as an important regulator of some liver-specific metabolic genes. Here, we report that LRH-1, which exhibited an increased expression pattern in high-grade prostate cancer and CRPC xenograft models, functions to promote de novo androgen biosynthesis via its direct transactivation of several key steroidogenic enzyme genes, elevating intratumoral androgen levels and reactivating AR signaling in CRPC xenografts as well as abiraterone-treated CRPC tumors. Pharmacologic inhibition of LRH-1 activity attenuated LRH-1-mediated androgen deprivation and anti-androgen resistance of prostate cancer cells. Our findings not only demonstrate the significant role of LRH-1 in the promotion of intratumoral androgen biosynthesis in CRPC via its direct transcriptional control of steroidogenesis, but also suggest targeting LRH-1 could be a potential therapeutic strategy for CRPC management.Significance: These findings not only demonstrate the significant role of the nuclear receptor LRH-1 in the promotion of intratumoral androgen biosynthesis in CRPC via its direct transcriptional control of steroidogenesis, but also suggest targeting LRH-1 could be a potential therapeutic strategy for CRPC management.

miR-1275 is one of the microRNAs (miRNAs) that are differentially expressed during follicular atresia in pig ovaries, as identified by a miRNA microarray assay in our previous study [1]. However, its functions in follicular atresia remain unknown. In this study, we showed that miR-1275 promotes early apoptosis of porcine granulosa cells (pGCs) and the initiation of follicular atresia, and inhibits E2 release and expression of CYP19A1, the key gene in E2 production. Bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assays revealed that liver receptor homolog (LRH)-1, not CYP19A1, is a direct functional target of miR-1275. In vitro overexpression and knockdown experiments showed that LRH-1 significantly repressed apoptosis and induced E2 secretion and CYP19A1 expression in pGCs. LRH-1, whose expression was regulated by miR-1275, prevented apoptosis in pGCs. Furthermore, luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that LRH-1 protein bound to the CYP19A1 promoter and increased its activity. Our findings suggest that miR-1275 attenuates LRH-1 expression by directly binding to its 3'UTR. This prevents the interaction of LRH-1 protein with the CYP19A1 promoter, represses E2 synthesis, promotes pGC apoptosis, and initiates follicular atresia in porcine ovaries.
Nuclear heme receptor reverse erythroblastosis virus (REV-ERB) α (a transcriptional repressor) is known to regulate cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and bile acid synthesis. However, the mechanism for REV-ERBα regulation of CYP7A1 remains elusive. Here, we investigate the role of LRH-1 in REV-ERBα regulation of CYP7A1 and cholesterol metabolism. We first characterized the tertiary amine N-(4-chloro-2-methylbenzyl)-N-(4-chlorobenzyl)-1-(5-nitrothiophen-2-yl)methanamine (GSK2945) as a highly specific Rev-erbα/REV-ERBα antagonist using cell-based assays and confirmed expression of Rev-erbα in mouse liver. GSK2945 treatment increased hepatic mouse cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1) level and lowered plasma cholesterol in wild-type mice. Likewise, the compound increased the expression and microsomal activity of Cyp7a1 in hypercholesterolemic mice. This coincided with reduced plasma and liver cholesterol and enhanced production of bile acids. Increased levels of Cyp7a1/CYP7A1 were also found in mouse and human primary hepatocytes after GSK2945 treatment. In these experiments, we observed parallel increases in Lrh-1/LRH-1 (a known hepatic activator of Cyp7a1/CYP7A1) mRNA and protein. Luciferase reporter, mobility shift, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that Lrh-1/LRH-1 was a direct Rev-erbα/REV-ERBα target gene. Furthermore, conditional deletion of Lrh-1 in the liver abrogated the regulatory effects of Rev-erbα on Cyp7a1 and cholesterol metabolism in mice. In conclusion, Rev-erbα regulates Cyp7a1 and cholesterol metabolism through its repression of the Lrh-1 receptor. Targeting the REV-ERBα/LRH-1 axis may represent a novel approach for management of cholesterol-related diseases.
We explored the function of microRNA-381 on osteosarcoma cell growth and anticancer mechanism for clinic treatment. MicroRNA-381 of osteosarcoma patients was decreased, microRNA-381 levels were more downregulated at stages III/IV than those at stage I/II in osteosarcoma patients. Downregulation of microRNA-381 using anti-microRNA-381 mimics increased cell proliferation, decreased LDH activity and apoptosis, and inhibited caspase‑3/9 activities, Bax/Bcl-2 and p53 protein expression in vitro osteosarcoma cells through upregulation of LRH-1/Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Overexpression of microRNA-381 using microRNA-381 mimics inhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis and increased LDH activity, caspase‑3/9 activities, expression of Bax/Bcl-2 and p53 protein in osteosarcoma of in vitro model through downregulation of LRH-1/Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Si‑LRH‑1 promoted the anticancer effects of microRNA-381 on osteosarcoma cell growth through Wnt/β‑catenin signaling pathway. Thus, our data suggested that microRNA-381 suppresses the proliferation of osteosarcoma cells through upregulation of LRH-1/Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
Fibrates are hypolipidemic drugs that act as activators of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). In both humans and rodents, females were reported to be less responsive to fibrates than males. Previous studies on fibrates and PPARα usually involved male mice, but little has been done in females. The present study aimed to provide the first comprehensive analysis of the effects of clofibrate (CLOF) and PPARα on bile acid (BA) homeostasis in female mice. Study in WT male mice showed that a 4-day CLOF treatment increased liver weight, bile flow, and biliary BA excretion, but decreased total BAs in both serum and liver. In contrast, WT female mice were less susceptible to these CLOF-mediated responses observed in males. In WT female mice, CLOF decreased total BAs in the liver, but had little effect on the mRNAs of hepatic BA-related genes. Next, a comparative analysis between WT and PPARα-null female mice showed that lack of PPARα in female mice decreased total BAs in serum, but had little effect on total BAs in liver or bile. However, lack of PPARα in female mice increased mRNAs of BA synthetic enzymes (Cyp7a1, Cyp8b1, Cyp27a1, and Cyp7b1) and transporters (Ntcp, Oatp1a1, Oatp1b2, and Mrp3). Furthermore, the increase of Cyp7a1 in PPARα-null female mice was associated with an increase in liver Fxr-Shp-Lrh-1 signaling. In conclusion, female mice are resistant to CLOF-mediated effects on BA metabolism observed in males, which could be attributed to PPARα-mediated suppression in females on genes involved in BA synthesis and transport.
Objective To investigate the molecular mechanisms of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) taking part in inflammatory response in Staphylococcus aureus (SA)-induced asthma. Methods We established the cell inflammatory response model through stimulating mouse RAW264.7 macrophages with SA. The TLR2, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K), nuclear factor κBp65 (NF-κBp65), phospho-NF-κBp65, beclin-1 and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B) were detected by Western blot analysis after treatment with TLR2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) and 3-methyladenine (3-MA), and the tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were determined by ELISA. In addition, the number of autolysosomes was observed by the laser scanning confocal microscope. Results SA-stimulated macrophages activated various signaling pathways including TLR2. TLR2 siRNA markedly repressed the expressions of PI3K, phospho-NF-κBp65, the autophagy protein beclin-1 and LC3B as well as the number of autolysosomes and the production of TNF- and IL-6. We also demonstrated that 3-MA had the same effect on autophagy and inflammation as TLR2 siRNA did. Conclusion TLR2 modulates SA-induced inflammatory response and autophagy in macrophages through PI3K signaling pathway.
Recent evidence from genetic, cell biology, and animal model studies has suggested a pivotal role of autophagy in mediating systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the genetic basis has not yet been thoroughly examined. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to identify additional susceptibility variants in autophagy-related genes along with their functional significance.
First, we performed a gene family-based genetic association analysis in SLE patients with the use of ImmunoChip arrays, and then we selected the most strongly associated polymorphisms for replication in additional cohorts. To identify regulatory clues, we analyzed publicly available blood expression quantitative trait locus data and Encyclopedia of DNA Elements data on transcription factor binding sites and cell type-specific differential expression. Functional effects were tested by luciferase reporter assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and differential gene expression assays.
In 14,474 samples, we observed that the rare Chinese variant rs933717T was associated with susceptibility to SLE (0.11% in cases versus 0.87% in controls; P = 2.36 × 10-10 , odds ratio 0.13). The rs933717 risk allele C correlated with increased MAP1LC3B expression; increased MAP1LC3B messenger RNA was observed in SLE patients and in lupus-prone mice. In reporter gene constructs, the risk allele increased luciferase activity up to 2.7-3.8-fold in both HEK 293T and Jurkat cell lines, and the binding of HEK 293T and Jurkat cell nuclear extracts to the risk allele was also increased.
We observed a likely genetic association between light chain 3B, a widely used marker for autophagy, and susceptibility to SLE.
Although silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are widely used in consumer and medical products, the mechanism by which AgNPs cause pulmonary damage is unclear. AgNPs are incorporated into cells and processed via the autophagy pathway. We examined the effects of AgNP exposure on autophagic flux and expression of transcription factor EB (TFEB) in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells. In cells exposed to citrate-coated 60-nm AgNPs, confocal laser microscopic examination showed a decrease in the LysoTracker fluorescence signal and an increase in that of Cyto-ID, indicating lysosomal pH alkalization and autophagosome formation, respectively. The proteins p62 and microtubule-associated protein light chain 3B-II (LC3B-II) are both degraded by autophagy, and their levels increased depending on AgNP dose. Furthermore, AgNP-induced increase in LC3B-II was not enhanced by treatment with the autophagic inhibitor bafilomycin A1. TFEB mRNA levels, and protein levels in cytosolic and nuclear fractions, were suppressed by exposure to AgNPs, suggesting transcriptional inhibition of TFEB expression. Overexpression of TFEB did not suppress AgNP-induced LC3B-II accumulation and cellular damage, indicating that impairment of autophagic flux and cellular damage by AgNPs might not be primarily caused by reduced TFEB expression. The present study suggests that AgNP-induced lysosomal dysfunction plays a principal role in the autophagic flux defect.
Female Wistar rats were treated with orally administered soy isoflavones at concentrations of 0, 25, 50, or 100mg/kg body weight from weaning until sexual maturity (3 mo.), and ovarian steroidogenesis was evaluated. After soy isoflavones were administered, a significant (P&lt;0.05) decrease (44%) in the serum estrodial levels of the high-dose (HD) group were observed. Cultured granulosa cells from the middle- (MD) and HD groups showed significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced (31%, 45%, respectively) in vitro estradiol secretion, and those from the HD group showed significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced progesterone (25%) secretion. Compared with the control group, the mRNA expression of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (Star), cytochromeP450 cholesterol side chain cleavage (Cyp11a1 and Cyp19a1), and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3b (Hsd3b) genes also decreased. Real-time quantitative PCR and Western blotting revealed a significant (P&lt;0.05) decrease in key transcription factor steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) expression in the HD group. The detection of DNA methylation using bisulfitesequencing PCR (BSP) suggested a significantly (P&lt;0.05) increased total methylation rate in the proximal SF-1 promoter in the HD group. Further studies showed that treatment with soy isoflavones can significantly (P&lt;0.05) increase the mRNA expression of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1 and DNMT3a. This study proved that soy isoflavone administration from weaning until sexual maturity could inhibit ovarian steroidogenesis, suggesting that SF-1 might play an important role in this effect. In addition, DNA methylation might play a role in the downregulation of SF-1 gene expression induced by soy isoflavones.
The production of insulin-producing β cells from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in vitro represents a promising strategy for a cell-based therapy for type 1 diabetes mellitus. To explore the cellular heterogeneity and temporal progression of endocrine progenitors and their progeny, we performed single-cell qPCR on more than 500 cells across several stages of in vitro differentiation of hESCs and compared them with human islets. We reveal distinct subpopulations along the endocrine differentiation path and an early lineage bifurcation toward either polyhormonal cells or β-like cells. We uncover several similarities and differences with mouse development and reveal that cells can take multiple paths to the same differentiation state, a principle that could be relevant to other systems. Notably, activation of the key β-cell transcription factor NKX6.1 can be initiated before or after endocrine commitment. The single-cell temporal resolution we provide can be used to improve the production of functional β cells.
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subpopulation of cancer cells believed to be implicated in cancer initiation, progression, and recurrence. Here, we report that ectopic expression of zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 protein (ZEB1) results in the acquisition of CSC properties by breast cancer cells, leading to tumor initiation and progression in vitro and in vivo. The neurogenin 3 gene (Ngn3) is a bona fide target of ZEB1, and its repression is a key factor contributing to ZEB1-induced cancer cell stemness. ZEB1 suppressed Ngn3 transcription by forming a ZEB1/DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)3B/histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) complex on the Ngn3 promoter, leading to promoter hypermethylation and gene silencing. The rescue of Ngn3 expression attenuated ZEB1-induced cancer stemness and symmetric CSC division. Immunohistological analysis of human breast cancer specimens revealed a strong inverse relationship between ZEB1 and NGN3 protein expression. Thus, our findings suggest ZEB1-mediated silencing of Ngn3 is required for breast tumor initiation and maintenance. Targeted therapies against the ZEB1/Ngn3 axis may be highly valuable for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer.
Glioblastoma is the most common malignant primary brain tumor, and it is one of the causes of cancer fatality in both adult and pediatric populations. Patients with glioblastoma require chemotherapy after surgical resection and radiotherapy. Therefore, chemotherapy constitutes a viable approach for the eradication of glioblastoma cells. In this study, the anti-tumor activity of sinomenine hydrochloride (SH) was evaluated in U87 and SF767 cells in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that SH potently inhibited U87 and SF767 cell viability and did not cause caspase-dependent cell death, as demonstrated by the absence of significant early apoptosis and caspase-3 cleavage. Instead, SH activated an autophagy-mediated cell death pathway, as indicated by the accumulated microtubule-associated protein light chain 3B (LC3B)-II, triggered autophagic flux and enhanced cell viability after pretreatment with autophagy inhibitors. SH-mediated autophagy in the two cell lines was implicated in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, protein kinase B (Akt)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway suppression and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway activation. The ROS antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC), the Akt-specific activator insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and the JNK-specific inhibitor SP600125 attenuated SH-induced autophagy. Moreover, ROS activated autophagy via the Akt-mTOR and JNK pathways. Additionally, SH treatment may promote lysosome biogenesis through activating transcription factor EB (TFEB). The in vivo study found that SH effectively suppressed glioblastoma growth without exhibiting significant toxicity. In conclusion, our findings reveal a novel mechanism of action of SH in cancer cells via the induction of autophagy through ROS generation and autophagy-lysosome pathway activation; these findings also supply a new potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of human glioblastoma.
Bipolar Disorder (BD) is a prevalent and disabling condition, determined by gene-environment interactions, possibly mediated by epigenetic mechanisms. The present study aimed at investigating the transcriptional regulation of BD selected target genes by DNA methylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with a DSM-5 diagnosis of type I (BD-I) and type II (BD-II) Bipolar Disorders (n=99), as well as of healthy controls (CT, n=42). The analysis of gene expression revealed prodynorphin (PDYN) mRNA levels significantly reduced in subjects with BD-II but not in those with BD-I, when compared to CT. Other target genes (i.e. catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), glutamate decarboxylase (GAD67), serotonin transporter (SERT) mRNA levels remained unaltered. Consistently, an increase in DNA methylation at PDYN gene promoter was observed in BD-II patients vs CT. After stratifying data on the basis of pharmacotherapy, patients on mood-stabilizers (i.e., lithium and anticonvulsants) were found to have lower DNA methylation at PDYN gene promoter. A significantly positive correlation in promoter DNA methylation was observed in all subjects between PDYN and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), whose methylation status had been previously found altered in BD. Moreover, among key genes relevant for DNA methylation establishment here analysed, an up-regulation of DNA Methyl Transferases 3b (DNMT3b) and of the methyl binding protein MeCP2 (methyl CpG binding protein 2) mRNA levels was also observed again just in BD-II subjects. A clear selective role of DNA methylation involvement in BD-II is shown here, further supporting a role for BDNF and its possible interaction with PDYN. These data might be relevant in the pathophysiology of BD, both in relation to BDNF and for the improvement of available treatments and development of novel ones that modulate epigenetic signatures.
Apigenin, a component in daily diets, demonstrates antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Here, we intended to explore the mechanism of apigenin-mediated endotoxin-induced myocardial injury and its role in the interplay among inflammation, oxidative stress, and autophagy. In our lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced myocardial injury model, apigenin ameliorated cardiac injury (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK)), cell death (TUNEL staining, DNA fragmentation, and PARP activity), and tissue damage (cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and cardiac myosin light chain-1 (cMLC1)) and improved cardiac function (ejection fraction (EF) and end diastolic left ventricular inner dimension (LVID)). Apigenin also alleviated endotoxin-induced myocardial injury by modulating oxidative stress (nitrotyrosine and protein carbonyl) and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, MIP-1α, and MIP-2) along with their master regulator NFκB. Apigenin modulated redox homeostasis, and its anti-inflammatory role might be associated with its ability to control autophagy. Autophagy (determined by LAMP1, ATG5, and p62), its transcriptional regulator transcription factor EB (TFEB), and downstream target genes including vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 11 (Vps11) and microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B (Map1lc3) were modulated by apigenin. Thus, our study demonstrated that apigenin may lead to potential development of new target in sepsis treatment or other myocardial oxidative and/or inflammation-induced injuries.
Chronic fibrosing idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) is characterized by alveolar epithelial damage, activation of fibroblast proliferation, and loss of normal pulmonary architecture and function. This study aims to investigate the genetic backgrounds of IIP through gene expression profiling and pathway analysis, and to identify potential biomarkers that can aid in diagnosis and serve as novel therapeutic targets.
RNA extracted from lung specimens of 12 patients with chronic fibrosing IIP was profiled using Illumina Human WG-6 v3 BeadChips, and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was performed to identify altered functional and canonical signaling pathways. For validating the results from gene expression analysis, immunohistochemical staining of 10 patients with chronic fibrosing IIP was performed.
Ninety-eight genes were upregulated in IIP patients relative to control subjects. Some of the upregulated genes, namely desmoglein 3 (DSG3), protocadherin gamma-A9 (PCDHGA9) and discoidin domain-containing receptor 1 (DDR1) are implicated in cell-cell interaction and/or adhesion; some, namely collagen type VII, alpha 1 (COL7A1), contactin-associated protein-like 3B (CNTNAP3B) and mucin-1 (MUC1) are encoding the extracellular matrix molecule or the molecules involved in cell-matrix interactions; and the others, namely CDC25C and growth factor independent protein 1B (GFI1B) are known to affect cell proliferation by affecting the progression of cell cycle or regulating transcription. According to pathway analysis, alternated pathways in IIP were related to cell death and survival and cellular growth and proliferation, which are more similar to cancer than to inflammatory response and immunological diseases. Using immunohistochemistry, we further validate that DSG3, the most highly upregulated gene, shows higher expression in chronic fibrosing IIP lung as compared to control lung.
We identified several genes upregulated in chronic fibrosing IIP patients as compared to control, and found genes and pathways implicated in cancer, rather than in inflammatory or immunological disease to play important roles in the pathogenesis of IIPs. Moreover, DSG3 is a novel potential biomarker for chronic fibrosing IIP with its significantly high expression in IIP lung.
The accumulation of α-synuclein is the primary pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). In PD patients, CpG demethylation of intron-1 has been reported to be associated with α-synuclein up-regulation. Environmental factor, for example neurotoxin, is a major etiological risk factor in PD pathogenesis. However, the role of CpG methylation in neurotoxin-induced PD has not been addressed completely yet. To explore CpG methylation associating with α-synuclein transcription and its underlying mechanisms in the neurotoxin-induced PD pathology, human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were treated with neurotoxins 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+). Results showed that MPP+ induced demethylation of the whole length of the CpG island around SNCA promoter, and both 6-OHDA and MPP+ resulted in up-regulation of SNCA transcription. The CpG demethylation around promoter resulted in up-regulation of SNCA transcriptional activity. In addition, 6-OHDA and MPP+ induced the reduced levels of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 3a and DNMT3b but not DNMT1. These data suggested that CpG demethylation was induced by MPP+ and might mediate up-regulation of SNCA transcription in neurotoxin-induced PD. And down-regulation of both DNMT3a and DNMT3b, but not DNMT1, might contribute to CpG demethylation of the SNCA promoter.
Visual information is relayed from the eye to the brain via retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons. Mice lacking NRP1 or NRP1-binding VEGF-A isoforms have defective RGC axon organisation alongside brain vascular defects. It is not known whether axonal defects are caused exclusively by defective VEGF-A signalling in RGCs or are exacerbated by abnormal vascular morphology. Targeted NRP1 ablation in RGCs with a Brn3bCre knock-in allele reduced axonal midline crossing at the optic chiasm and optic tract fasciculation. In contrast, Tie2-Cre-mediated endothelial NRP1 ablation induced axon exclusion zones in the optic tracts without impairing axon crossing. Similar defects were observed in Vegfa120/120 and Vegfa188/188 mice, which have vascular defects as a result of their expression of single VEGF-A isoforms. Ectopic midline vascularisation in endothelial Nrp1 and Vegfa188/188 mutants caused additional axonal exclusion zones within the chiasm. As in vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated that vessels do not repel axons, abnormally large or ectopically positioned vessels are likely to present physical obstacles to axon growth. We conclude that proper axonal wiring during brain development depends on the precise molecular control of neurovascular co-patterning.
Interleukin (IL)-35, a newly identified member of the IL-12 cytokine family, has been reported to suppress inflammation and induce immunotolerance. However, little is known regarding the role of IL-35 during chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Herein, we measured the serum IL-35 concentration of 73 patients with hepatitis C and 22 healthy individuals, as well as further investigated the modulatory function of IL-35 on CD4+CD25+CD127dim/- regulatory T cells (Tregs) and on hepatocytes infected with HCV in cell culture (HCVcc). IL-35 expression was significantly increased in patients with chronic hepatitis C and was positively correlated with the levels of HCV RNA. Inhibition of viral replication led to decreases in the serum levels of IL-35. IL-35 stimulation not only elevated the percentage of Tregs but also robustly inhibited cellular proliferation and up-regulated the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-10 and IL-35) in a HCV-specific and non-specific manner, which indicates enhancement of the suppressive function of Tregs. Although IL-35 did not exert anti-HCV activity in HCVcc-infected Huh7.5 cells, it reduced inflammatory cytokine secretion from Huh7.5 cells. This was probably via inhibition of the STAT1 and STAT3 signaling pathways, which could suppress subsequent liver damage due to chronic hepatitis C. The current data suggested that IL-35 contributes to persistent HCV infection by inhibiting antiviral immune activity. Moreover, IL-35 might also protect against HCV-induced liver injury by down-regulating the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Thus, the immunosuppressive properties of IL-35 might play contradictory roles in maintaining viral persistence and reducing the inflammatory responses in chronic HCV infection.
The polybrominated diphenyl ether flame retardants decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209) and bisphenol A (BPA) are environmental contaminants that can cross the placenta and exert toxicity in the developing fetal nervous system. Copy number variants (CNVs) play a role in a number of genetic disorders and may be implicated in BDE-209/BPA teratogenicity. In this study, we found that BDE-209 and/or BPA exposure decreased neural differentiation efficiency of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), although there was a &gt;90% induction of neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) from exposed hESCs. However, the mean of CNV numbers in the NPCs with BDE-209 + BPA treatment was significantly higher compared to the other groups, whereas DNA methylation was lower and DNA methyltransferase(DNMT1 and DNMT3A) expression were significantly decreased in all of the BDE-209 and/or BPA treatment groups compared with the control groups. The number of CNVs in chromosomes 3, 4, 11, 22, and X in NPCs with BDE-209 and/or BPA exposure was higher compared to the control group. In addition, CNVs in chromosomes 7, 8, 14, and 16 were stable in hESCs and hESCs-derived NPCs irrespective of BDE-209/BPA exposure, and CNVs in chromosomes 20 q11.21 and 16 p13.11 might be induced by neural differentiation. Thus, BDE-209/BPA exposure emerges as a potential source of CNVs distinct from neural differentiation by itself. BDE-209 and/or BPA exposure may cause genomic instability in cultured stem cells via reduced activity of DNA methyltransferase, suggesting a new mechanism of human embryonic neurodevelopmental toxicity caused by this class of environmental toxins.
Congenital heart defects contribute to embryonic or neonatal lethality but due to the complexity of cardiac development, the molecular changes associated with such defects are not fully understood. Here, we report that transcription factors (TFs) Brn-3a (POU4F1) and Brn-3b (POU4F2) are important for normal cardiac development. Brn-3a directly represses Brn-3b promoter in cardiomyocytes and consequently Brn-3a knockout (KO) mutant hearts express increased Brn-3b mRNA during mid-gestation, which is linked to hyperplastic growth associated with elevated cyclin D1, a known Brn-3b target gene. However, during late gestation, Brn-3b can cooperate with p53 to enhance transcription of pro-apoptotic genes e.g. Bax, thereby increasing apoptosis and contribute to morphological defects such as non-compaction, ventricular wall/septal thinning and increased crypts/fissures, which may cause lethality of Brn-3a KO mutants soon after birth. Despite this, early embryonic lethality in e9.5 double KO (Brn-3a-/- : Brn-3b-/-) mutants indicate essential functions with partial redundancy during early embryogenesis. High conservation between mammals and zebrafish (ZF) Brn-3b (87%) or Brn-3a (76%) facilitated use of ZF embryos to study potential roles in developing heart. Double morphant embryos targeted with morpholino oligonucleotides to both TFs develop significant cardiac defects (looping abnormalities and valve defects) suggesting essential roles for Brn-3a and Brn-3b in developing hearts.
Semaphorin 3B (SEMA3B) is a secreted axonal guidance molecule that is expressed during development and throughout adulthood. Recently, SEMA3B has emerged as a tumor suppressor in non-neuronal cells. Here, we show that SEMA3B is a direct target of GATA3 transcriptional activity. GATA3 is a key transcription factor that regulates genes involved in mammary luminal cell differentiation and tumor suppression. We show that GATA3 relies on SEMA3B for suppression of tumor growth. Loss of SEMA3B renders GATA3 inactive and promotes aggressive breast cancer development. Overexpression of SEMA3B in cells lacking GATA3 induces a GATA3-like phenotype and higher levels of SEMA3B are associated with better cancer patient prognosis. Moreover, SEMA3B interferes with activation of LIM kinases (LIMK1 and LIMK2) to abrogate breast cancer progression. Our data provide new insights into the role of SEMA3B in mammary gland and provides a new branch of GATA3 signaling that is pivotal for inhibition of breast cancer progression and metastasis.
Long noncoding RNA UCA1 has emerged as a novel regulator in cancer initiation and progression of various cancers. However, function and underlying mechanism of UCA1 in the progression of gastric cancer (GC) remain unclear. In the present study, we report that UCA1 expressed highly in GC tissues and GC cells, which was partly induced by SP1. UCA1 promoted GC cell proliferation and G1/S transition in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, UCA1 exerted its function through interacting with EZH2, promoting direct interaction with cyclin D1 promoter to activate the translation of cyclin D1. Furthermore, AKT/GSK-3B/cyclin D1 axis was activated to upregulate cyclin D1 due to overexpression of UCA1. In addition, EZH2 and phosphorylated AKT induced by UCA1 could impact each other to form a positive feedback to promote cyclin D1 expression. This study demonstrated that UCA1 as a critical regulator involved in GC proliferation and cell cycle progression by promoting cyclin D1 expression, which indicates that it may be clinically a potential therapeutic target in GC.
WRKY proteins, which comprise one of the largest transcription factor (TF) families in the plant kingdom, play crucial roles in plant development and stress responses. Despite several studies on WRKYs in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), functional annotation information about wheat WRKYs is limited.
Here, 171 TaWRKY TFs were identified from the whole wheat genome and compared with proteins from 19 other species representing nine major plant lineages. A phylogenetic analysis, coupled with gene structure analysis and motif determination, divided these TaWRKYs into seven subgroups (Group I, IIa-e, and III). Chromosomal location showed that most TaWRKY genes were enriched on four chromosomes, especially on chromosome 3B. In addition, 85 (49.7%) genes were either tandem (5) or segmental duplication (80), which suggested that though tandem duplication has contributed to the expansion of TaWRKY family, segmental duplication probably played a more pivotal role. Analysis of cis-acting elements revealed putative functions of WRKYs in wheat during development as well as under numerous biotic and abiotic stresses. Finally, the expression of TaWRKY genes in flag leaves, glumes, and lemmas under water-deficit condition were analyzed. Results showed that different TaWRKY genes preferentially express in specific tissue during the grain-filling stage.
Our results provide a more extensive insight on WRKY gene family in wheat, and also contribute to the screening of more candidate genes for further investigation on function characterization of WRKYs under various stresses.
To explore the role and mechanism of mitophagy in ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) in rats.
Thirty-six adult Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into three groups (each n = 12): spontaneous breathing group (CON group), normal tidal volume (VT) group (NVT group, VT was 8 mL/kg) and high VT group (HVT group, VT was 40 mL/kg). All rats received endotracheal tube by tracheostomy. The rats in CON group were maintained spontaneous breathing, while those in NVT and HVT groups received mechanical ventilation with corresponding VT. After 4 hours of ventilation, the serum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissues were harvested. The lung wet/dry weight (W/D) ratio was assessed, and the histopathology changes were observed by light microscopy, and the ultra structure changes in type II alveolar epithelial cell (AEC II) were observed by electron microscopy. The levels of interleukin (IL-1β and IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in serum and BALF were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The total protein in BALF was measured by bicinchoninic acid methods, and the infiltrated cells in BALF were counted. The mRNA expressions and protein levels of microtube associated light chain 3B (LC3B), mitochondrial DNA coded cytochrome C oxidase IV (COX-IV) and nuclear factor-KB p65 (NF-KB p65) in lung tissues were determined by real-time fluorescent quantitation reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western Blot.
The histopathology of lung tissue and the ultra structure of AEC II were normal in CON group and NVT group, and the obvious inflammatory changes and pathological injury were found in HVT group. Compared with CON and NVT groups, the W/D ratio in HVT group was significantly increased (8.53±1.05 vs. 5.12±0.65, 5.57±0.55, both P &lt; 0.05), and total protein, infiltrated cells, and IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in BALF were significantly increased [total protein (g/L): 2.35±0.45 vs. 1.46±0.34, 1.76±0.51; infiltrated cells (×105/mL): 2.05±0.48 vs. 0.40±0.08, 0.60±0.23; IL-1β (ng/L): 119.82±6.56 vs. 76.15±3.32, 79.39±4.44; IL-6 (μg/L): 4.10±0.52 vs. 1.97±0.40, 2.27±0.36; TNF-α (mg/L): 1.49±0.28 vs. 0.43±0.23, 0.61±0.24; all P &lt; 0.05], IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α levels in serum were also elevated [IL-1β (ng/L): 127.53±7.10 vs. 79.40±2.80, 82.95±2.25; IL-6 (μg/L): 6.28±0.82 vs. 2.96±0.35, 3.36±0.72; TNF-α (mg/L): 1.59±0.42 vs. 0.53±0.22, 0.78±0.25; all P &lt; 0.05]. The mRNA expressions and protein levels of LC3B, COX-IV and NF-KB p65 in lung tissue of HVT group were significantly higher than those of CON group and NVT group, the mRNA expressions of LC3B-II, COX-IV and NF-KB p65 were (3.52±0.90), (3.76±1.16) and (9.54±2.06) folds of those in CON group, and the protein expressions were (1.76±0.24), (1.65±0.20) and (1.91±0.12) folds of those in CON group, with significantly statistical differences (all P &lt; 0.05). There were no significant differences in the parameters mentioned above between NVT group and CON group.
Mitophagy may be associated with VILI resulting from escaped mitochondrial DNA for activation of inflammation.
Aging is a major international concern that brings formidable socioeconomic and healthcare challenges. Small molecules capable of improving the health of older individuals are being explored. Small molecules that enhance cellular stress resistance are a promising avenue to alleviate declines seen in human aging. Tomatidine, a natural compound abundant in unripe tomatoes, inhibits age-related skeletal muscle atrophy in mice. Here we show that tomatidine extends lifespan and healthspan in C. elegans, an animal model of aging which shares many major longevity pathways with mammals. Tomatidine improves many C. elegans behaviors related to healthspan and muscle health, including increased pharyngeal pumping, swimming movement, and reduced percentage of severely damaged muscle cells. Microarray, imaging, and behavioral analyses reveal that tomatidine maintains mitochondrial homeostasis by modulating mitochondrial biogenesis and PINK-1/DCT-1-dependent mitophagy. Mechanistically, tomatidine induces mitochondrial hormesis by mildly inducing ROS production, which in turn activates the SKN-1/Nrf2 pathway and possibly other cellular antioxidant response pathways, followed by increased mitophagy. This mechanism occurs in C. elegans, primary rat neurons, and human cells. Our data suggest that tomatidine may delay some physiological aspects of aging, and points to new approaches for pharmacological interventions for diseases of aging.
FoxM1b is a cell cycle-regulated transcription factor, whose over-expression is a marker for poor outcome in cancers. Its transcriptional activation function requires phosphorylation by Cdk1 or Cdk2 that primes FoxM1b for phosphorylation by Plk1, which triggers association with the co-activator CBP. FoxM1b also possesses transcriptional repression function. It represses the mammary differentiation gene GATA3 involving DNMT3b and Rb. We investigated what determines the two distinct functions of FoxM1b: activation and repression. We show that Rb binds to the C-terminal activation domain of FoxM1b. Analyses with phospho-defective and phospho-mimetic mutants of FoxM1b identified a critical role of the Plk1 phosphorylation sites in regulating the binding of FoxM1b to Rb and DNMT3b. That is opposite of what was seen for the interaction of FoxM1b with CBP. We show that, in addition to GATA3, FoxM1b also represses the mammary luminal differentiation marker FoxA1 by promoter-methylation, and that is regulated by the Plk1 phosphorylation sites in FoxM1b. Our results show that the Plk1 phosphorylation sites in FoxM1b serve as a regulator for its repressor function, and they provide insights into how FoxM1b inhibits differentiation genes and activates proliferation genes during cancer progression.
Antiestrogen resistance is a major obstacle to endocrine therapy for breast cancers. Although reduced estrogen receptor-α (ER-α) expression is a known contributing factor to antiestrogen resistance, the mechanisms of ER-α downregulation in antiestrogen resistance are not fully understood. Here, we report that ectopic zinc-finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) is associated with ER-α deficiency in breast cancer cells and thus confers antiestrogen resistance. Mechanistically, ZEB1 represses ER-α transcription by forming a ZEB1/DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)3B/histone deacetylase (HDAC)1 complex on the ER-α promoter, leading to DNA hypermethylation and the silencing of ER-α. Thus, ectopic ZEB1 downregulates ER-α expression and subsequently attenuates cell growth inhibition by antiestrogens, such as tamoxifen and fulvestrant. Notably, the depletion of ZEB1 by RNA interference causes ER-α promoter demethylation, restores ER-α expression, and increases the responsiveness of breast cancer cells to antiestrogen treatment. By studying specimens from a large cohort of subjects with breast cancer, we found a strong inverse correlation between ZEB1 and ER-α protein expression. Moreover, breast tumors that highly express ZEB1 exhibit ER-α promoter hypermethylation. Using a nude mouse xenograft model, we further confirmed that the downregulation of ZEB1 expression restores the responsiveness of breast cancer cells to antiestrogen therapy in vivo. Therefore, our findings suggest that ZEB1 is a crucial determinant of resistance to antiestrogen therapies in breast cancer.
This study aimed to investigate the effects of choline deficiency on intestinal inflammation of fish after Aeromonas hydrophila infection and the potential molecular mechanisms. Juvenile Jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var. Jian) were fed two diets containing choline at 165 (deficient group) and 607 mg/kg diet respectively for 65 days. Choline deficiency decreased intestinal lysozyme activity, C3 and IgM contents, increased acid phosphatase activity, downregulated mRNA levels of antimicrobial peptides [liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide (LEAP) 2A, LEAP-2B, hepcidin and defensin], cytokines [interleukin (IL) 6a, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interferon γ2b (IFN-γ2b), IL-6b and transforming growth factor β2 (TGF-β2) only in proximal intestine, IL-10 in mid and distal intestine], immune-related signaling molecules [Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB), Janus kinase 3 (JAK3), and signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 (STAT5)], tight junction proteins (claudin 3b, claudin 3c, claudin 11 and occludin), and mitogen-activated protein kinases p38 (p38MAPK) in proximal and distal intestine of juvenile Jian carp after A. hydrophila challenge. In contrast, choline deficiency upregulated mRNA levels of antimicrobial peptides (LEAP-2A, LEAP-2B, hepcidin and defensin), cytokines (IL-6b, IFN-γ2b and TGF-β2), immune-related signaling molecules (TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB, IκB, JAK3, STAT4 in three intestinal segments, and STAT6), claudin 11, and p38MAPK in mid intestine of fish. This study provides new finding that choline deficiency-induced immune responses against A. hydrophila infection were varied among three intestinal segments in fish.
Regulated retinal ganglion cell (RGC) differentiation and axonal guidance is required for a functional visual system. Homeodomain and basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors are required for retinogenesis, as well as patterning, differentiation and maintenance of specific retinal cell types. We hypothesized that Dlx1, Dlx2 and Brn3b homeobox genes function in parallel intrinsic pathways to determine RGC fate and therefore generated Dlx1/Dlx2/Brn3b triple-knockout mice. A more severe retinal phenotype was found in the Dlx1/Dlx2/Brn3b-null retinas than was predicted by combining features of the Brn3b single- and Dlx1/Dlx2 double-knockout retinas, including near total RGC loss with a marked increase in amacrine cells in the ganglion cell layer. Furthermore, we discovered that DLX1 and DLX2 function as direct transcriptional activators of Brn3b expression. Knockdown of Dlx2 expression in primary embryonic retinal cultures and Dlx2 gain of function in utero strongly support that DLX2 is both necessary and sufficient for Brn3b expression in vivo We suggest that ATOH7 specifies RGC-committed progenitors and that Dlx1 and Dlx2 function both downstream of ATOH7 and in parallel, but cooperative, pathways that involve regulation of Brn3b expression to determine RGC fate.
Wnt pathway is involved in synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival, and alterations in Wnt signaling have previously been reported both in aging and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study sought to evaluate Wnt signaling pathway interplay integrity across prefrontal lobe structures in AD patients compared to normal aging. Using the open-access BrainCloud™ database, 84 gene expression profiles and clustering effect were analyzed in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (PFC) across a time span of 21-78 years of age. Next, expression levels of the selected genes were investigated in post-mortem brain tissue from 30 AD patients and 30 age-matched controls in three interdependent brain areas of the PFC. Results were assessed in relation to Braak stage and cognitive impairment of the patients. We found a general age-related factor in Wnt pathway genes with a group of genes being closely interrelated in their expression across the time span investigated in healthy individuals. This interrelation was altered in the AD brains studied, as several genes presented aberrant transcription, even though not always being altered at protein levels. Noteworthy, beta(β)-catenin and glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK3β) showed a dynamic switch in protein levels and activity, especially in the orbitofrontal cortex and the medial frontal gyrus. A significant decrease in β-catenin protein levels were inversely associated with increased GSK3β tyrosine activating phosphorylation, in addition to downstream effects associated with disease progression and cognitive decline. This study is the first that comprehensively evaluates Wnt signaling pathway in the prefrontal cortical lobe structures of AD brains, in relation to age-related coordinated Wnt signaling changes. Our findings further support that increased kinase activity of GSK3β is associated with AD pathology in the PFC.
The aim of the present study was to determine the cardioprotective mechanisms by which micro (mi)RNA-30e protects the heart from myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MI/R) and to explore the signaling pathways that may confer protection for the heart and be potential therapeutic targets. It was demonstrated that miRNA‑30e expression was decreased in patients with MI/R. In H9C2 cells, silencing (si)miRNA‑30e significantly inhibited cellular apoptosis, the expression of apoptosis regulator BAX (Bax) and caspase‑3 activity. It also significantly increased the expression of microtubule‑associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B, p62, Beclin‑1, neurogenic locus notch homolog protein‑1 (Notch1), Hes1 and phosphorylated‑protein kinase B (p‑Akt), and decreased the expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and proteins associated with oxidative stress. The inhibition of autophagy following treatment with 3‑methyladenine significantly reversed the effect of si‑miRNA‑30e on apoptosis, Bax, caspase‑3, iNOS and oxidative stress in H9C2 cells. The promotion of Notch1 expression increased the effect of si‑miRNA‑30e on apoptosis, Bax, caspase‑3, iNOS, Notch1, Hes1 and p‑Akt protein expression and oxidative stress in H9C2 cells. Taken together, these results indicate that miRNA‑30e protects the heart from MI/R via autophagy and the Notch1/Hes1/Akt signaling pathway.
Ultraviolet (UV) light radiation induces the formation of bulky photoproducts in the DNA that globally affect transcription and splicing. However, the signaling pathways and mechanisms that link UV-light-induced DNA damage to changes in RNA metabolism remain poorly understood. Here we employ quantitative phosphoproteomics and protein kinase inhibition to provide a systems view on protein phosphorylation patterns induced by UV light and uncover the dependencies of phosphorylation events on the canonical DNA damage signaling by ATM/ATR and the p38 MAP kinase pathway. We identify RNA-binding proteins as primary substrates and 14-3-3 as direct readers of p38-MK2-dependent phosphorylation induced by UV light. Mechanistically, we show that MK2 phosphorylates the RNA-binding subunit of the NELF complex NELFE on Serine 115. NELFE phosphorylation promotes the recruitment of 14-3-3 and rapid dissociation of the NELF complex from chromatin, which is accompanied by RNA polymerase II elongation.
Previous studies have reported that adenosine monophosphate‑activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation can enhance osteoblast differentiation and mineralization; however, the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Autophagy also serves an important role in osteoblast mineralization and bone homeostasis. The present study aimed to explore whether activation of AMPK could enhance osteoblast differentiation and mineralization via the induction of autophagy. The fracture healing and nonunion animal models were established and verified by X-ray imaging. Bone maturation was measured by Masson staining and the expression of AMPK, p-AMPK, microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B II, and p62 in the fracture ends were detected by immunohistochemical staining. The mRNA expression levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin ,runt-related transcription factor 2 and BCN1 were determined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium staining was used to determine ALP activity and alizarin red staining was adopted to examine mineralization. Western blot analysis was performed to detect protein expression. Autophagosome was observed by Transmission electron microscopy. Small interfering (si)RNA was used to knock down the expression of target gene. In vivo experiments demonstrated that new bone mineralization and maturation was markedly restrained in the nonunion group, alongside decreased AMPK activation and autophagic activity, compared with in the fracture healing group. The results of an in vitro study indicated that AMPK activation stimulated the osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3‑E1 cells, with increases in ALP activity, mineralization, and the mRNA expression levels of ALP, osteocalcin and runt-related transcription factor 2. Furthermore, AMPK activation induced autophagy, as determined by upregulation of microtubule‑associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B, increased autophagosome density and downregulation of p62. In addition, inhibition of autophagy reversed the effects of AMPK activation on osteoblast differentiation. These results suggested that AMPK activation may stimulate osteoblast differentiation and mineralization via the induction of autophagy, and provides evidence to suggest that enhancing AMPK activation and autophagic activity may be a potential novel approach to promote fracture healing.
DNA topoisomerase 3B (TOP3B) is unique among all mammalian topoisomerases for its dual activities that resolve both DNA and RNA topological entanglements to facilitate transcription and translation. However, the mechanism by which TOP3B activity is regulated is still elusive. Here, we have identified arginine methylation as an important post-translational modification (PTM) for TOP3B activity. Protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) 1, PRMT3 and PRMT6 all methylate TOP3B in vitro at its C-terminal arginine (R) and glycine (G)-rich motif. Site-directed mutagenesis analysis identified R833 and R835 as the major methylation sites. Using a methylation-specific antibody, we confirmed that TOP3B is methylated in cells and that mutation of R833 and R835 to lysine (K) significantly reduces TOP3B methylation. The methylation-deficient TOP3B (R833/835K) is less active in resolving negatively supercoiled DNA, which consequently lead to accumulation of co-transcriptionally formed R-loops in vitro and in cells. Additionally, the methylation-deficient TOP3B (R833/835K) shows reduced stress granule localization, indicating that methylation is critical for TOP3B function in translation regulation. Mechanistically, we found that R833/835 methylation is partially involved in the interaction of TOP3B with its auxiliary factor, the Tudor domain-containing protein 3 (TDRD3). Together, our findings provide the first evidence for the regulation of TOP3B activity by PTM.
Vitis heyneana is widely distributed in the north of Vietnam, it has been used in Vietnamese traditional medicine as an agent for treatment of arthritis, bronchitis, carbuncles and inflammatory conditions, and menstrual irregularities. However, this plant has not been investigated in phytochemical constituents and biological effects, especially in the anti-inflammatory property.
Bioassay-guided fractionation of the EtOAc soluble fraction from the aerial part of Vitis heyneana resulted in the isolation of a series of oligostilbenoids as piceid (1), 2-r-viniferin (2), betulifol A (3), vitisinol C (4), (-)-trans-ε-viniferin (5), α-viniferin (6), shoreaketon (7), amurensin B (8), vitisinol B (9), and cis-vitisin B (10). Compound 5 showed the most potent inhibitory activities by suppressing LPS-induced COX-2 expression and PGE2 production. This compound exhibited significantly reduced LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) release in a dose-dependent manner. These effects are accompanied with the inhibition of transcription factor NF-κB activation.
The results suggested that trans-ε-viniferin exerts anti-inflammatory effects via suppression the NF-κB activation in RAW 264.7 cells.
Apoptosis of osteoblasts, triggered by prolonged or excessive use of glucocorticoids (GCs), has been identified as a dominant contributor to the development of osteoporosis and osteonecrosis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying GC‑induced apoptosis are multifaceted and remain to be fully elucidated. The present study aimed to explore the correlation between dexamethasone (DEX)‑induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), autophagy and apoptosis in MC3T3‑E1 osteoblast‑like cells. Cell viability was assessed using a Cell Counting Kit‑8 assay, and flow cytometry was performed to assess cellular apoptosis, cell cycle and ROS production. Immunofluorescence and western blot analysis were respectively used to detect autophagic vacuoles and the expression of proteins, including cyclin D kinase (CDK)2, poly[ADP ribose] polymerase, caspase‑3, activating transcription factor (ATF)4, CCAAT/enhancer‑binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), Beclin1, microtubule‑associated proteins 1A/1B light chain (LC)3B and P62. It was revealed that DEX not only reduced cell viability, but also promoted apoptosis via the activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In addition, DEX induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase via inhibition of the expression of CDK2, and the production of ROS was activated. Of note, the DEX‑mediated changes in viability and apoptosis were attenuated in MC3T3‑E1 cells after treatment with 3‑methyladenine, which is an autophagy inhibitor. Treatment with the antioxidant N‑acetylcysteine abolished the effect of DEX on the proliferation, apoptosis, ER stress and autophagy of MC3T3‑E1 cells. In conclusion, the present results indicated that DEX promoted the production of ROS, which enhanced apoptosis through activation of autophagy and ER stress in MC3T3-E1 cells.
The IL-6 cytokine family activates intracellular signaling pathways through glycoprotein-130 (gp130), and this signaling has established regulatory roles in muscle glucose metabolism and proteostasis. Although the IL-6 family has been implicated as myokines regulating the muscles' metabolic response to exercise, gp130's role in mitochondrial quality control involving fission, fusion, mitophagy, and biogenesis is not well understood. Therefore, we examined gp130's role in basal and exercise-trained muscle mitochondrial quality control. Muscles from C57BL/6, skeletal muscle-specific gp130 knockout (KO) mice, and C2C12 myotubes, were examined. KO did not alter treadmill run-to-fatigue or indices of mitochondrial content [cytochrome- c oxidase (COX) activity] or biogenesis (AMPK, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α, mitochondrial transcription factor A, and COX IV). KO increased mitochondrial fission 1 protein (FIS-1) while suppressing mitofusin-1 (MFN-1), which was recapitulated in myotubes after gp130 knockdown. KO induced ubiquitin-binding protein p62, Parkin, and ubiquitin in isolated mitochondria from gastrocnemius muscles. Knockdown of gp130 in myotubes suppressed STAT3 and induced accumulation of microtubule-associated protein-1 light chain 3B (LC3)-II relative to LC3-I. Suppression of myotube STAT3 did not alter FIS-1 or MFN-1. Exercise training increased muscle gp130 and suppressed STAT3. KO did not alter the exercise-training induction of COX activity, biogenesis, FIS-1, or Beclin-1. KO increased MFN-1 and suppressed 4-hydroxynonenal after exercise training. These findings suggest a role for gp130 in the modulation of mitochondrial dynamics and autophagic processes. NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY Although the IL-6 family of cytokines has been implicated in the regulation of skeletal muscle protein turnover and metabolism, less is understood about its role in mitochondrial quality control. We examined the glycoprotein-130 receptor in the regulation of skeletal muscle mitochondria quality control in the basal and exercise-trained states. We report that the muscle glycoprotein-130 receptor modulates basal mitochondrial dynamics and autophagic processes and is not necessary for exercise-training mitochondrial adaptations to quality control.
Derepression of chromatin-mediated transcriptional repression of paternal and maternal genomes is considered the first major step that initiates zygotic gene expression after fertilization. The histone variant H3.3 is present in both male and female gametes and is thought to be important for remodeling the paternal and maternal genomes for activation during both fertilization and embryogenesis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using our H3.3B-HA-tagged mouse model, engineered to report H3.3 expression in live animals and to distinguish different sources of H3.3 protein in embryos, we show here that sperm-derived H3.3 (sH3.3) protein is removed from the sperm genome shortly after fertilization and extruded from the zygotes via the second polar bodies (PBII) during embryogenesis. We also found that the maternal H3.3 (mH3.3) protein is incorporated into the paternal genome as early as 2 h postfertilization and is detectable in the paternal genome until the morula stage. Knockdown of maternal H3.3 resulted in compromised embryonic development both of fertilized embryos and of androgenetic haploid embryos. Furthermore, we report that mH3.3 depletion in oocytes impairs both activation of the Oct4 pluripotency marker gene and global de novo transcription from the paternal genome important for early embryonic development. Our results suggest that H3.3-mediated paternal chromatin remodeling is essential for the development of preimplantation embryos and the activation of the paternal genome during embryogenesis.
Transcription of the Ebola virus genome depends on the viral transcription factor VP30 in its unphosphorylated form, but the underlying molecular mechanism of VP30 dephosphorylation is unknown. Here we show that the Ebola virus nucleoprotein (NP) recruits the host PP2A-B56 protein phosphatase through a B56-binding LxxIxE motif and that this motif is essential for VP30 dephosphorylation and viral transcription. The LxxIxE motif and the binding site of VP30 in NP are in close proximity, and both binding sites are required for the dephosphorylation of VP30. We generate a specific inhibitor of PP2A-B56 and show that it suppresses Ebola virus transcription and infection. This work dissects the molecular mechanism of VP30 dephosphorylation by PP2A-B56, and it pinpoints this phosphatase as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in a wide range of biological processes including angiogenesis. MiR-204 was identified as a tumor suppressor in multiple cancer types, including lung adenocarcinoma. However, the function of miR-204 in lung tumor angiogenesis remains unknown. In this study, we found that the miR-204 expression was decreased in lung adenocarcinoma based on the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) analysis and gain-of-function experiment showed that miR-204 promoted cancer cell apoptosis and suppressed cell proliferation, migration in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Functionally, both the tube formation and migration abilities of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were suppressed by conditioned media from lung cancer A549 cells with miR-204 overexpression. Meanwhile, these conditioned media inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis in HUVECs. The key angiogenesis inducer hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF1α) and the pro-angiogenic mediators vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor were decreased in A549 cells transfected with miR-204 mimics. Mechanistically, miR-204 could target Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and further impaired signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 both in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of JAK2 or signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activity with small chemical inhibitors in A549 cells impaired lung adenocarcinoma angiogenesis in vitro. Meanwhile, conditional media from interleukin 6-treated lung normal epithelial cells significantly promoted tube formation of HUVEC, which was disturbed by miR-204 overexpression. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that miR-204 attenuates angiogenesis in lung adenocarcinoma potentially via JAK2-STAT3 pathway. Clinically, the miR-204/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway is a putative therapeutic target in lung adenocarcinoma. © 2017 IUBMB Life, 70(1):81-91, 2018.
Cadmium (Cd) has toxic and suppressive effects on the immune system, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we show that autophagy plays a critical role in regulation of Cd-induced immunosuppression in RAW264.7 cells. Cd decreased cell viability in a dose-dependent manner; cleaved caspase-8, caspase-3, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1; increased DNA laddering; induced CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP); and reduced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α expression; indicating that caspase-dependent and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mediated apoptosis are involved in Cd-induced immunotoxicity. Furthermore, Cd induced autophagy, as demonstrated by microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B) plasmid DNA transfection and its conversion from LC3-I to the LC3-II form by autophagy inhibitors, via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of autophagy suppressed Cd-induced apoptosis, as evidenced by inhibition of caspase-8, caspase-3, and PARP-1 cleavage, indicating that autophagy promotes apoptosis. The pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD inhibited Cd-induced apoptosis, but increased autophagy and decreased cell viability, indicating that autophagy can compensate for reduced apoptotic cell death. Calpain inhibitors blocked Cd-induced apoptosis and autophagy, indicating that calpain plays a critical role in Cd cytotoxicity. Treatment with Ca2+ chelators completely recovered Cd-induced cell viability and inhibited Cd-induced apoptosis and autophagy. Treatment with N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) suppressed Cd-induced antioxidant enzyme levels, apoptosis, and autophagy. Collectively, Cd-induced oxidative stress triggers ER stress, leading to Ca2+-dependent calpain activation and subsequent activation of autophagy and apoptosis, resulting in immune suppression.
: Early stage prediction of economic trait performance is important and directly linked to profitability of farm pig production. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been applied to find causative genomic regions of traits. This study established a regulatory gene network using GWAS for critical economic pig characteristics, centered on easily measurable body fat thickness in live animals. We genotyped 2,681 pigs using Illumina Porcine SNP60, followed by GWAS to calculate Bayes factors for 47,697 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of seven traits. Using this information, SNPs were annotated with specific genes near genome locations to establish the association weight matrix. The entire network consisted of 226 nodes and 6,921 significant edges. For in silico validation of their interactions, we conducted regulatory sequence analysis of predicted target genes of transcription factors (TFs). Three key regulatory TFs were identified to guarantee maximum coverage: AT-rich interaction domain 3B (ARID3B), glial cell missing homolog 1 (GCM1), and GLI family zinc finger 2 (GLI2). We identified numerous genes targeted by ARID3B, associated with cellular processes. GCM1 and GLI2 were involved in developmental processes, and their shared target genes regulated multicellular organismal process. This system biology-based function analysis might contribute to enhancing understanding of economic pig traits.
Frequent deletions of tumor-suppressor genes at chromosome 3p21.3 have been detected in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). As a candidate tumor suppressor gene, semaphorin 3B (SEMA3B) is located at 3p21.3 and is frequently inactivated in several tumors. However, the role and inactivation mechanisms of SEMA3B and its antisense long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) SEMA3B-AS1 in the carcinogenesis of ESCC have not been fully elucidated. The present study was conducted to investigate the role, epigenetic inactivation mechanisms, and prognostic value of SEMA3B and SEMA3B-AS1 in ESCC tumorigenesis and prognosis. Frequent downregulation of SEMA3B and SEMA3B-AS1 was detected in esophageal cancer cells and ESCC tissues, and the expression level of SEMA3B and SEMA3B-AS1 in ESCC tissues was correlated with TNM stage and lymph node metastasis. SEMA3B and SEMA3B-AS1 shared the same CpG island in the promoter region and the expression of both genes might be regulated by the promoter methylation status. Furthermore, transcription factor Sp1 activated SEMA3B or SEMA3B-AS1 transcription and the promoter hypermethylation of SEMA3B and SEMA3B-AS1 influenced Sp1 binding ability. Moreover, over-expression of SEMA3B and SEMA3B-AS1 suppressed the viability and invasion of esophageal cancer cells in vitro. SEMA3B-AS1 influenced the protein expression of SEMA3B. SEMA3B or SEMA3B-AS1 expression and promoter methylation status were correlated with ESCC patients' survival. Thus, these findings suggest that SEMA3B and SEMA3B-AS1 may act as tumor suppressors and may serve as potential targets for antitumor therapy.
Nitrogen (N) plays critical role in plant growth; manipulating N assimilation could be a target to increase grain yield and N use. Here, we show that ABRE-binding factor (ABF)-like leucine zipper transcription factor TabZIP60 mediates N use and growth in wheat. The expression of TabZIP60 is repressed when the N-deprived wheat plants is exposed to nitrate. Knock down of TabZIP60 through RNA interference (RNAi) increases NADH-dependent glutamate synthase (NADH-GOGAT) activity, lateral root branching, N uptake and spike number, and improves grain yield more than 25% under field conditions, while overexpression of TabZIP60-6D had the opposite effects. Further investigation shows TabZIP60 binds to ABRE-containing fragment in the promoter of TaNADH-GOGAT-3B and negatively regulates its expression. Genetic analysis reveals that TaNADH-GOGAT-3B overexpression overcomes the spike number and yield reduction caused by overexpressing TabZIP60-6D. As such, TabZIP60-mediated wheat growth and N use is associated with its negative regulation on TaNADH-GOGAT expression. These findings indicate that TabZIP60 and TaNADH-GOGAT interaction plays important roles in mediating N use and wheat growth, and provides valuable information for engineering N use efficiency and yield in wheat.
Tregs play a fundamental role in immune tolerance via control of self-reactive effector T cells (Teffs). This function is dependent on maintenance of a high intracellular cAMP concentration. A number of microRNAs are implicated in the maintenance of Tregs. In this study, we demonstrate that peripheral immune tolerance is critically dependent on posttranscriptional repression of the cAMP-hydrolyzing enzyme phosphodiesterase-3b (Pde3b) by microRNA-142-5p (miR-142-5p). In this manner, miR-142-5p acts as an immunometabolic regulator of intracellular cAMP, controlling Treg suppressive function. Mir142 was associated with a super enhancer bound by the Treg lineage-determining transcription factor forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), and Treg-specific deletion of miR-142 in mice (TregΔ142) resulted in spontaneous, lethal, multisystem autoimmunity, despite preserved numbers of phenotypically normal Tregs. Pharmacological inhibition and genetic ablation of PDE3B prevented autoimmune disease and reversed the impaired suppressive function of Tregs in TregΔ142 animals. These findings reveal a critical molecular switch, specifying Treg function through the modulation of a highly conserved, cell-intrinsic metabolic pathway. Modulation of this pathway has direct relevance to the pathogenesis and treatment of autoimmunity and cancer.
Semaphorin 3B (SEMA3B) is frequently inactivated in several carcinomas. However, as the host gene of miR-6872, the roles of SEMA3B, antisense lncRNA SEMA3B-AS1, and miR-6872 in gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) tumorigenesis have not been clarified.
The expression levels of SEMA3B, SEMA3B-AS1, and miR-6872 were respectively detected by qRT-PCR, western blot, or immunohistochemical staining assays. The methylation status was determined by BGS and BS-MSP methods. In vitro assays were preformed to explore the biological effects of SEMA3B, SEMA3B-AS1, and miR-6872-5p in gastric cancer cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was used to detect the binding of protein to DNA. The interaction of SEMA3B-AS1 with MLL4 was identified by RNA immunoprecipitation and RNA pull-down assays.
Frequent downregulation of SEMA3B, SEMA3B-AS1, and miR-6872 was detected in GCA tissues and gastric cancer cells. Aberrant hypermethylation of the promoter region was more tumor specific and was negatively correlated with the expression level of SEMA3B, SEMA3B-AS1, and miR-6872-5p. Transcription factor Sp1 activated SEMA3B or SEMA3B-AS1 transcription and CpG sites hypermethylation within promoter region eliminated Sp1 binding ability. Overexpression of SEMA3B and SEMA3B-AS1 inhibited gastric cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro. SEMA3B-AS1 induced the expression of SEMA3B by interacting with MLL4. ZNF143 might be the target gene of miR-6872-5p and miR-6872-5p functioning synergistically with SEMA3B to suppress cell invasion. Furthermore, SEMA3B, SEMA3B-AS1, and miR-6872-5p expression levels were associated with GCA patients' survival.
SEMA3B, SEMA3B-AS1, and miR-6872 may act as tumor suppressors and may serve as potential targets for antitumor therapy.
We aim to investigate whether C21, a selective angiotensin type 2 receptor agonist, can exert protective effects on pancreatic β-cells through activation of antiapoptosis and autophagy.
The high-fat diet-induced obese rats (HFDs) were under C21 treatment for 4 weeks.
C21 treatment decreased the fasting glucose levels and improved β-cell insulin secretory function in the HFD group. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and electron microscopy indicated that the islet morphology was improved in the C21-treated obese rats, which was associated with increased levels of the key transcription factor PDX1, glucose sensing, and uptaking protein GCK and GLUT2, respectively. C21 treatment exerted antiapoptotic effects through decreasing the levels of apoptotic marker Caspase-3 while increasing the levels of antiapoptotic markers AKT, p-AKT, and BCL2. C21 treatment also induced autophagosome formation in the mitochondria of the β-cells in the HFD group accompanied by increased levels of autophagy markers, LC-3B and Beclin-1.
The results suggested C21 treatment decreased the fasting glucose level and protected β-cell function in the HFD-induced obese rat model, which in part through activation of antiapoptotic and autophagy processes. This study provided preclinical evidence for the utilization of C21 in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
The development of drug resistance following treatment with chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin (cis) and paclitaxel (pax) contributes to high morbidity and mortality in ovarian cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying such changes are not well understood. In this study, we demonstrate that the Brn-3b transcription factor was increased in different ovarian cancer cells including SKOV3 and A2780 following treatment with cis and pax. Furthermore, sustained increases in Brn-3b were associated with survival in drug resistant cells and correlated with elevated HSP27 expression. In contrast, targeting Brn-3b for reduction using short interfering RNA (siRNA) also resulted in attenuated HSP27 expression. Importantly, blocking Brn-3b expression with siRNA in SKOV3 cells was associated with reduced cell numbers at baseline but also increased cell death after further treatment, indicating sensitization of cells. Similar results were obtained in the metastatic IP1 cell line derived from ascites of mice bearing SKOV3 tumours. These findings suggest that increased Brn-3b may confer resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs in ovarian cancer cells by regulating key target genes such as HSP27 and that targeting Brn-3b may provide a novel mechanism for treatment of drug resistant ovarian cancers.
Excess alcohol exposure leads to alcoholic liver disease (ALD), a predominant cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the past decade, increasing attention has been paid to understand the association between n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) and ALD. In this review, we summarize the metabolism of n-3 PUFAs, animal model of ALD, and the findings from recent studies determining the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD as a possible treatment. The animal models of acute ethanol exposure, chronic ethanol exposure and chronic-plus-single binge ethanol feeding have been widely used to explore the impact of n-3 PUFAs. Although the results of studies regarding the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD have been inconsistent or controversial, increasing evidence has demonstrated that n-3 PUFAs may be useful in alleviating alcoholic steatosis and alcohol-induced liver injury through multiple mechanisms, including decreased de novo lipogenesis and lipid mobilization from adipose tissue, enhanced mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation, reduced hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress, and promoted intestinal homeostasis, positively suggesting that n-3 PUFAs might be promising for the management of ALD. The oxidation of n-3 PUFAs ex vivo in an experimental diet was rarely considered in most n-3 PUFA-related studies, likely contributing to the inconsistent results. Thus, the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD deserves greater research efforts and remains to be evaluated in randomized, placebo-controlled clinic trial.

Oncogenic anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is one of the few druggable targets in neuroblastoma, and therapy resistance to ALK-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) comprises an inevitable clinical challenge. Therefore, a better understanding of the oncogenic signaling network rewiring driven by ALK is necessary to improve and guide future therapies. Here, we performed quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics on neuroblastoma cells treated with one of three clinically relevant ALK TKIs (crizotinib, LDK378, or lorlatinib) or an experimentally used ALK TKI (TAE684) to unravel aberrant ALK signaling pathways. Our integrated proximal proteomics (IPP) strategy included multiple signaling layers, such as the ALK interactome, phosphotyrosine interactome, phosphoproteome, and proteome. We identified the signaling adaptor protein IRS2 (insulin receptor substrate 2) as a major ALK target and an ALK TKI-sensitive signaling node in neuroblastoma cells driven by oncogenic ALK. TKI treatment decreased the recruitment of IRS2 to ALK and reduced the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated depletion of ALK or IRS2 decreased the phosphorylation of the survival-promoting kinase Akt and of a downstream target, the transcription factor FoxO3, and reduced the viability of three ALK-driven neuroblastoma cell lines. Collectively, our IPP analysis provides insight into the proximal architecture of oncogenic ALK signaling by revealing IRS2 as an adaptor protein that links ALK to neuroblastoma cell survival through the Akt-FoxO3 signaling axis.
Peperomin E (PepE), a natural secolignan isolated from the whole plant of Peperomia dindygulensis, has been reported by ourselves and others to display potent anti-cancer effects in many types cancer cells, especially gastric cancer. However, the effects of PepE on the metastasis of poorly-differentiated gastric cancer cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been well elucidated.
We evaluated PepE effects on gastric cancer cell invasion and migration in vitro via wound healing and transwell assays and those on growth and metastasis in vivo using an orthotopic xenograft NOD-SCID mouse model. DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) activity was determined using a colorimetric DNMT activity/inhibition assay kit. PepE binding kinetics to DNMTs were determined using the bio-layer interferometry binding assay. Gene and protein levels of DNMTs, AMPKα-Sp1 signaling molecules, and metastatic-suppressor genes in PepE-treated gastric cancer cells were determined using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR arrays and western blotting. The effect of PepE on Sp1 binding to the DNMT promoter was determined by electrophoretic mobility-shift assay. Global DNA methylation levels were determined using liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The methylation status of silenced metastatic-suppressor genes (MSGs) in gastric cancer cells was investigated by methylation-specific PCR.
PepE can dose-dependently suppress invasion and migration of poorly-differentiated gastric cancer cells in vitro and in vivo with low toxicity against normal cells. Mechanistically, PepE not only covalently binds to the catalytic domain of DNMT1 and inhibits its activity (IC50 value 3.61 μM) but also down-regulates DNMT1, 3a, and 3b mRNA and protein expression in in gastric cancer cells, by disruption of the physical interaction of Sp1 with the DNMT1, 3a, and 3b promoter and mediation of the AMPKα-Sp1 signaling pathway. The dual inhibition activity of PepE toward DNMTs renders a relative global DNA hypomethylation, which induces MSG promoter hypomethylation (e.g., E-cadherin and TIMP3) and enhances their expression in gastric cancer cells.
Collectively, our data indicated that PepE may represent a promising therapeutic lead compound for intervention in gastric cancer metastasis and may also exhibit potential as a DNA methylation inhibitor for use in epigenetic cancer therapy.
The main obstacle to an HIV cure is the transcriptionally inert proviruses that persist in resting CD4 T cells and other reservoirs. None of the current approaches has significantly reduced the size of the viral reservoir. Hence, alternative approaches, such as permanent blocking of viral transcription, to achieve a sustained remission, need urgent attention. To identify cellular factors that may be important for this approach, we sought for host targets that when altered could block HIV transcription and reactivation. Here, we identified splicing factor 3B subunit 1 (SF3B1) as a critical HIV dependency factor required for viral replication. SF3B1 is a splicing factor involved in directing chromatin and nascent gene transcripts to appropriate splice sites. Inhibitors of SF3B1 are currently in development for cancer and have been found to be nontoxic to normal cells compared to malignant cells. Knockdown of SF3B1 abrogated HIV replication in all cell types tested. SF3B1 interacted with viral protein Tat in vitro and in vivo Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of SF3B1 prevented Tat-mediated HIV transcription and RNA polymerase II association with the HIV promoter. In addition, an inhibitor of SF3B1 prevented HIV reactivation from latency irrespective of the latency-reversing agent used. The data show that SF3B1 is involved in viral transcription and reactivation from latency and may serve as a therapeutic target in the HIV cure efforts.IMPORTANCE The reason why HIV cannot be cured by current therapy is because of viral persistence in resting T cells. One approach to permanent HIV remission that has received less attention is the so-called "block and lock" approach. The idea behind this approach is that the virus could be permanently disabled in patients if viral genome or surrounding chromatin could be altered to silence the virus, thus enabling patients to stop therapy. In this work, we have identified splicing factor 3B subunit 1 (SF3B1) as a potential target for this approach. SF3B1 interacts with the viral protein Tat, which is critical for viral transcription. Inhibition of SF3B1 prevents HIV transcription and reactivation from latency. Since there are preclinical inhibitors for this protein, our findings could pave the way to silence HIV transcription, potentially leading to prolonged or permanent remission.
Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF1) is a critical transcription factor involved in cell response to hypoxia. Under physiological conditions, its a subunit is rapidly degraded in most tissues except testes. HIF1 is stably expressed in Leydig cells, which are the main source of testosterone for male, and might bind to the promoter region of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (Star), which is necessary for the testosterone synthesis, according to software analysis. This study aims to identify the binding sites of HIF1 on Star promoter and its transcriptional regulation of Star to affect testosterone synthesis. Testosterone level and steroid synthesis-related proteins were determined in male Balb/C mice exposed to hypoxia (8% O2). While HIF1 was upregulated, the testosterone level was significantly decreased. This was further confirmed by in vitro experiments with rat primary Leydig cells or TM3 cells exposed to hypoxia (1% O2), CoCl2 or DFX to raise HIF1. The decline of testosterone was reversed by pregnenolone but not cAMP, indicating the cholesterol transport disorder as the main cause. In agreement, StAR expression level was decreased in response to HIF1, while 3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 17b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and p450scc did not exhibit significant changes. By ChIP, EMSA supershift and dual-luciferase reporter assays, HIF1 was found to bind to the Star promoter region and repress the expression of StAR. Mutation assays identified three HIF1-binding sites on mouse Star promoter. These findings indicate that HIF1 represses Star transcription through directly binding to the Star promoter at -2082/-2078, -2064/-2060 and -1910/-1906, leading to the negative regulation of testosterone synthesis.
IκB, a cytoplasmic inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), is reportedly degraded via the proteasome. However, we recently found that long-term incubation with proteasome inhibitors (PIs) such as PS-341 or MG132 induces IκBα degradation via an alternative pathway, lysosome, which results in NF-κB activation and confers resistance to PI-induced lung cancer cell death. To enhance the anti-cancer efficacy of PIs, elucidation of the regulatory mechanism of PI-induced IκBα degradation is necessary. Here, we demonstrated that PI upregulates nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) via both de novo protein synthesis and Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) degradation, which is responsible for IκBα degradation via macroautophagy activation. PIs increased the protein level of light chain 3B (LC3B, macroautophagy marker), but not lysosome-associated membrane protein 2a (Lamp2a, the receptor for chaperone-mediated autophagy) in NCI-H157 and A549 lung cancer cells. Pretreatment with macroautophagy inhibitor or knock-down of LC3B blocked PI-induced IκBα degradation. PIs up-regulated Nrf2 by increasing its transcription and mediating degradation of KEAP1 (cytoplasmic inhibitor of Nrf2). Overexpression of dominant-negative Nrf2, which lacks an N-terminal transactivating domain, or knock-down of Nrf2 suppressed PI-induced LC3B protein expression and subsequent IκBα degradation. Thus, blocking of the Nrf2 pathway enhanced PI-induced cell death. These findings suggest that Nrf2-driven induction of LC3B plays an essential role in PI-induced activation of the IκB/NF-κB pathway, which attenuates the anti-tumor efficacy of PIs.
We evaluated effects of handling procedures on detection of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) in oral fluids (OFs) by reverse-transcription real-time PCR (RT-rtPCR). The experiments were conducted using a composite sample of PRRSV-positive OF collected from 5-wk-old pigs vaccinated 15 d earlier with a modified-live PRRSV vaccine. Five pre-extraction sample-handling steps and all combinations thereof were evaluated: 1) thaw temperature (4°C or 25°C); 2) sample diluent (1:1 dilution with nuclease-free water or guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol); 3a) sonication of the sample (yes or no); 3b) temperature (4°C or 25°C) at which step 3a was conducted; and 4) temperature at which the sample was maintained after step 3b and until RNA extraction was initiated (4°C or 25°C). All combinations of the 5 sample-handling steps (i.e., 32 unique treatments) were tested in a completely randomized factorial design with 4 replicates and 1 negative control for each treatment. The entire experiment was repeated on 5 separate days to produce a total of 800 PRRSV RT-rtPCR results. Binary (positive or negative) data were analyzed by logistic regression and results (Ct) were analyzed using a generalized linear model. Overall, 1 false-positive result was observed among 160 negative controls (99.4% specificity), and 85 false-negative results were observed among the 640 known-positive samples (86.7% sensitivity). The most significant factor affecting test outcome was thaw temperature (4°C or 25°C); samples thawed at 4°C had higher positivity rate (94% vs. 80%, p &lt; 0.0001) and lower Ct (36.2 vs. 37.5, p &lt; 0.0001).
The previously unreported flavone glycoside, demethyltorosaflavone B (2) and the E-propenoic acid substituted flavone, torosaflavone E (3a), were isolated together with nine previously reported metabolites, including indole-3-carbaldehyde, oleanonic acid, vanillic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, altheranthin (1a), alternanthin B (1b), demethyltorosaflavone D (3b), luteolin 8-C-E-propenoic acid (4) and chrysoeriol 7-O-rhamnoside (5), from the ethanol extract of the aerial part of Althernanthera philoxeroides. The crude ethanol extract was evaluated for its in vitro estrogenic activity in MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. The crude ethanol extract was also investigated in vivo for its antidepressant-like effects on ovariectomized mice using tail suspension and forced swimming tests, while its effect on the locomotor activity was evaluated by a Y-maze test. The effect of the crude extract on the serum corticosterone level, size and volume of uterus of the ovariectomized mice were also investigated. The expression of the mouse cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding protein (CREB), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and β-actin mRNAs in hippocampus and frontal cortex was also evaluated, using semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The crude extract and the isolated compounds 1a, 1b, 3a, 3b and 5, were evaluated for their inhibitory effects on monoamine oxidases (MAOs)-A and -B.
Even before Rosalin Franklin had discovered the DNA double helix, in her impressive X-ray diffraction image pattern, Erwin Schröedinger, described, in his excellent book, What is Life, how the finding of aperiodic crystals in biological systems surprised him (an aperiodic crystal, which, in my opinion is the material carrier of life). In the 21st century and still far from being able to define life, we are attending to a quick acceleration of knowledge on regulatory information. With the discovery of new codes and punctuation marks, we will greatly increase our understanding in front of an impressive avalanche of genomic sequences. Trifonov et al. defined a genetic code as a widespread DNA sequence pattern that carries a message with an impact on biology. These patterns are largely captured in transcribed messages that give meaning and identity to the particular cells. In this review, I will go through my personal career in and after my years of work in the laboratory of Gordon H. Dixon, extending toward the impressive acquisition of new knowledge on regulatory information and genetic codes provided by remarkable scientists in the field.

Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT)1 acts as a master regulator of cancer hallmarks, but underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. We show that TERT is required for the aberrant DNA methyltransferase 3 B (DNMT3B)2 expression and cancer-specific methylation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)3, through which AKT is activated. TERT depletion inhibited, while its over-expression promoted DNMT3B expression in HCC cells, respectively. Mechanistically, TERT cooperates with the transcription factor Sp1 to stimulate DNMT3B transcription. The tumor suppressors PTEN and RASSF1A were de-repressed following DNMT3B inhibition in TERT-depleted HCC cells. The PTEN promoter analysis demonstrated significantly reduced methylation in these cells. TERT silencing also led to diminished global DNA methylation. The analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)4 dataset showed that higher levels of TERT and DNMT3B expression predicted significantly shorter survival in HCC patients. Collectively, our findings establish TERT as an important contributor to cancer-specific DNA methylation and AKT hyperactivation in HCC cells. Given critical roles of both the aberrant DNA methylation and AKT activation in carcinogenesis, this TERT-regulated network or the TERT-DNMT3B-PTEN-AKT axis provides a biological explanation for multi-oncogenic activities of TERT and may be exploited in HCC treatment.
Hepatic steatosis, the accumulation of triglyceride droplets in the hepatocytes, is a common hepatic pathology seen in subjects with obesity/metabolic syndrome and those with excessive alcohol use. The pathogenesis underlying hepatic steatosis is complex. Recent studies have shown the specific role played by the molecular clock mechanism in the control of lipid metabolism and that the disruption of these tissue clocks may lead to the disturbances in lipid homeostasis. This review reports a novel role of small heterodimer partner in maintaining triglyceride and lipoprotein homeostasis through neuronal PAS domain protein 2.
Circadian rhythm regulates multiple metabolic processes and in turn is readily entrained by feeding-fasting cycles. However, the molecular mechanisms by which the peripheral clock senses nutrition availability remain largely unknown. Bile acids are under circadian control and also increase postprandially, serving as regulators of the fed state in the liver. Here, we show that nuclear receptor Small Heterodimer Partner (SHP), a regulator of bile acid metabolism, impacts the endogenous peripheral clock by directly regulating Bmal1. Bmal1-dependent gene expression is altered in Shp knockout mice, and liver clock adaptation is delayed in Shp knockout mice upon restricted feeding. These results identify SHP as a potential mediator connecting nutrient signaling with the circadian clock. 
Bile acids (BAs) are recently recognized signalling molecules that profoundly affect metabolism. Because of detergent-like toxicity, BA levels must be tightly regulated. An orphan nuclear receptor, Small Heterodimer Partner (SHP), plays a key role in this regulation, but how SHP senses the BA signal for feedback transcriptional responses is not clearly understood. We show an unexpected function of a nucleoporin, RanBP2, in maintaining BA homoeostasis through SUMOylation of SHP. Upon BA signalling, RanBP2 co-localizes with SHP at the nuclear envelope region and mediates SUMO2 modification at K68, which facilitates nuclear transport of SHP and its interaction with repressive histone modifiers to inhibit BA synthetic genes. Mice expressing a SUMO-defective K68R SHP mutant have increased liver BA levels, and upon BA- or drug-induced biliary insults, these mice exhibit exacerbated cholestatic pathologies. These results demonstrate a function of RanBP2-mediated SUMOylation of SHP in maintaining BA homoeostasis and protecting from the BA hepatotoxicity.
Nonalcoholic hepatic fat accumulation has been hypothesized to be associated with alterations in gut microbiota composition, although mechanistic explanations for this link are largely insufficient. The aim of this study was to elucidate the microbiota-driven mechanisms involved in the development of nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis.
Ob/ob mice and their wild-type lean control mice were fed an AIN-93G diet for 12 weeks. Faecal microbiota composition, faecal bile acid (BA) profile and intestinal and hepatic markers of BA metabolism were analysed. Ob/ob mice had significantly less faecal taurine-conjugated BAs compared to their lean controls. The proportions of butyrate-producing bacteria were lower in ob/ob mice compared to those in lean mice. Intestinal expression of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) mRNA was significantly higher, whereas hepatic expression of cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase 1 (CYP7A1) and small heterodimer partner (SHP) were significantly lower in ob/ob mice compared to those in control mice.
Microbiota-associated BAs deconjugation may induce nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by activating intestinal FXR signalling and blocking hepatic FXR-SHP pathway, thereby accelerating fat synthesis.
We provided evidences that changes in the gut microbiota and their metabolites can alter the profile of BAs, thereby providing a mechanism by which an altered microbiota profile contributes to the development of NAFLD.
Deficiency of the orphan nuclear hormone receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP, NR0B2) protects mice from diet-induced hepatic steatosis, in part, via repression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ2 (Pparg2) gene expression. Alcoholic fatty liver diseases (AFLD) share many common pathophysiological features with non-AFLD. To study the role of SHP and PPARγ2 in AFLD, we used a strategy of chronic ethanol feeding plus a single binge ethanol feeding to challenge wild-type (WT) and SHP-null (SHP(-/-)) mice with ethanol. The ethanol feeding induced liver fat accumulation and mRNA expression of hepatic Pparg2 in WT mice, which suggests that a high level of PPARγ2 is a common driving force for fat accumulation induced by ethanol or a high-fat diet. Interestingly, ethanol-fed SHP(-/-) mice displayed hepatic fat accumulation similar to that of ethanol-fed WT mice, even though their Pparg2 expression level remained lower. Mortality of SHP(-/-) mice after ethanol binge feeding was significantly reduced and their acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (Aldh2) mRNA level was higher than that of their WT counterparts. After an intoxicating dose of ethanol, SHP(-/-) mice exhibited faster blood ethanol clearance and earlier wake-up time than WT mice. Higher blood acetate, the end product of ethanol metabolism, and lower acetaldehyde levels were evident in the ethanol-challenged SHP(-/-) than WT mice. Ethanol-induced inflammatory responses and lipid peroxidation were also lower in SHP(-/-) mice. The current data show faster ethanol catabolism and extra fat storage through conversion of acetate to acetyl-CoA before its release into the circulation in this ethanol-feeding model in SHP(-/-) mice.
To investigate the efficacy of lingonberries in prevention of atherosclerosis, using atherosclerosis-prone Apoe(-/-) mice and to clarify whether effects were associated with changes in the gut microbiota, gut metabolites, and lipid metabolism.
Male Apoe(-/-) mice were fed either low-fat diet, high-fat diet, or high-fat diet with 44% lingonberries for 8 weeks. Blood lipid profiles, hepatic gene expression, atherosclerotic plaques in the aortic root region of the heart, bacterial 16S rRNA gene profiles, and cecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were analyzed. Triglyceride levels and amount of atherosclerotic plaques decreased in the group fed lingonberries in comparison to the high-fat group. Hepatic expression of the bile acid synthesis gene Cyp7a1 was significantly upregulated in the lingonberry group. Lingonberries increased the cecal relative abundance of bacterial genera Bacteroides, Parabacteroides and Clostridium. The cecal levels of total SCFAs were significantly lower in the lingonberry group, while the cecal proportion of propionic acid was higher in mice fed lingonberries.
Intake of lingonberries resulted in decreased triglyceridemia and reduced atherosclerosis. The altered gut microbiota composition and SCFA profile was associated with increased hepatic bile acid gene expression in mice fed lingonberries.
Bile acid (BA) metabolism is tightly controlled by nuclear receptor signaling to coordinate regulation of BA synthetic enzymes and transporters. Here we reveal a molecular cascade consisting of the antiapoptotic protein BCL2, nuclear receptor Shp, and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) H19 to maintain BA homeostasis. Bcl2 was overexpressed in liver of C57BL/6J mice using adenovirus mediated gene delivery for two weeks. Hepatic overexpression of Bcl2 caused drastic accumulation of serum BA and bilirubin levels and dysregulated BA synthetic enzymes and transporters. Bcl2 reactivation triggered severe liver injury, fibrosis and inflammation, which were accompanied by a significant induction of H19. Bcl2 induced rapid SHP protein degradation via the activation of caspase-8 pathway. The induction of H19 in Bcl2 overexpressed mice was contributed by a direct loss of Shp transcriptional repression. H19 knockdown or Shp re-expression largely rescued Bcl2-induced liver injury. Strikingly different than Shp, the expression of Bcl2 and H19 was hardly detectable in adult liver but was markedly increased in fibrotic/cirrhotic human and mouse liver. We demonstrated for the first time a detrimental effect of Bcl2 and H19 associated with cholestatic liver fibrosis and an indispensable role of Shp to maintain normal liver function. 
The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) regulates bile acid (BA) metabolism and possesses tumor suppressor functions. FXR expression is reduced in colorectal tumors of subjects carrying inactivated adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). Identifying the mechanisms responsible for this reduction may offer new molecular targets for colon cancer prevention.
We investigated how APC inactivation influences the regulation of FXR expression in colonic mucosal cells. We hypothesized that APC inactivation would epigenetically repress nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group H, member 4 (FXR gene name) expression through increased CpG methylation.
Normal proximal colonic mucosa and normal-appearing adjacent colonic mucosa and colon tumors were collected from wild-type C57BL/6J and Apc-deficient (Apc(Min) (/+)) male mice, respectively. The expression of Fxr, ileal bile acid-binding protein (Ibabp), small heterodimer partner (Shp), and cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. In both normal and adjacent colonic mucosa and colon tumors, we measured CpG methylation of Fxr in bisulfonated genomic DNA. In vitro, we measured the impact of APC inactivation and deoxycholic acid (DCA) treatment on FXR expression in human colon cancer HCT-116 cells transfected with silencing RNA for APC and HT-29 cells carrying inactivated APC.
In Apc(Min) (/+) mice, constitutive CpG methylation of the Fxrα3/4 promoter was linked to reduced (60-90%) baseline Fxr, Ibabp, and Shp and increased Cox-2 expression in apparently normal adjacent mucosa and colon tumors. Apc knockdown in HCT-116 cells increased cellular myelocytomatosis (c-MYC) and lowered (∼50%) FXR expression, which was further reduced (∼80%) by DCA. In human HCT-116 but not HT-29 colon cancer cells, DCA induced FXR expression and lowered CpG methylation of FXR.
We conclude that the loss of APC function favors the silencing of FXR expression through CpG hypermethylation in mouse colonic mucosa and human colon cells, leading to reduced expression of downstream targets (SHP, IBABP) involved in BA homeostasis while increasing the expression of factors (COX-2, c-MYC) that contribute to inflammation and colon cancer.
Liver cells experience hypoxic stress when drug-metabolizing enzymes excessively consume O2 for hydroxylation. Hypoxic stress changes the transcription of several genes by activating a heterodimeric transcription factor called hypoxia-inducible factor- 1α/β (HIF-1α/β). We found that hypoxic stress (0.1% O2) decreased the expression of cytochrome P450 7A1 (CYP7A1), a rate-limiting enzyme involved in bile acid biosynthesis. Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), a major component of bile acids, represses CYP7A1 by activating a transcriptional repressor named small heterodimer partner (SHP). We observed that hypoxia decreased the levels of both CDCA and SHP, suggesting that hypoxia repressed CYP7A1 without inducing SHP. The finding that overexpression of HIF-1α increased the activity of the CYP7A1 promoter suggested that hypoxia decreased the expression of CYP7A1 in a HIF-1-independent manner. Thus, the results of this study suggested that hypoxia decreased the activity of CYP7A1 by limiting its substrate O2, and by decreasing the transcription of CYP7A1. [BMB Reports 2016; 49(3): 173-178]. 
Biliary atresia (BA) is a severe chronic cholestasis disorder of infants that leads to death if not treated on time. Neonatal hepatitis syndrome (NHS) is another leading cause of neonatal cholestasis confounding the diagnosis of BA. Recent studies indicate that altered bile acid metabolism is closely associated with liver injury and cholestasis. In this study, we systematically measured the bile acid metabolome in plasma of BA, NHS, and healthy controls. Liver bile acids were also measured using biopsy samples from 48 BA and 16 NHS infants undergoing operative cholangiography as well as 5 normal adjacent nontumor liver tissues taken from hepatoblastoma patients as controls. Both BA and NHS samples had significantly elevated bile acid levels in plasma compared to normal controls. BA patients showed a distinct bile acid profile characterized by the higher taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA) level and lower chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) level than those in NHS patients. The ratio of TCDCA to CDCA in plasma was significantly higher in BA compared to healthy infants (p &lt; 0.001) or NHS (p &lt; 0.001). The area under receiver operating characteristic curve for TCDCA/CDCA to differentiate BA from NHS was 0.923 (95% CI: 0.862-0.984). These findings were supported by significantly altered expression levels of bile acid transporters and nuclear receptors in liver including farnesoid X receptor (FXR), small heterodimer partner (SHP), bile salt export pump (BSEP), and multidrug resistant protein 3 (MDR3) in BA compared to NHS. Taken together, the plasma bile acid profiles are distinct in BA, NHS, and normal infants, as characterized by the ratio of TCDCA/CDCA differentially distributed among the three groups of infants. 
Bile acids are primarily synthesized from cholesterol in the liver and have important roles in dietary lipid absorption and cholesterol homoeostasis. Detailed roles of the orphan nuclear receptors regulating cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis, have not yet been fully elucidated. In the present study, we report that oestrogen-related receptor γ (ERRγ) is a novel transcriptional regulator of CYP7A1 expression. Activation of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1 receptor) signalling induced ERRγ-mediated transcription of the CYP7A1 gene. Overexpression of ERRγ increased CYP7A1 expression in vitro and in vivo, whereas knockdown of ERRγ attenuated CYP7A1 expression. Deletion analysis of the CYP7A1 gene promoter and a ChIP assay revealed an ERRγ-binding site on the CYP7A1 gene promoter. Small heterodimer partner (SHP) inhibited the transcriptional activity of ERRγ and thus regulated CYP7A1 expression. Overexpression of ERRγ led to increased bile acid levels, whereas an inverse agonist of ERRγ, GSK5182, reduced CYP7A1 expression and bile acid synthesis. Finally, GSK5182 significantly reduced hepatic CB1 receptor-mediated induction of CYP7A1 expression and bile acid synthesis in alcohol-treated mice. These results provide the molecular mechanism linking ERRγ and bile acid metabolism.
Nuclear receptors are defined as a family of ligand regulated transcription factors [1-6]. While this definition reflects that ligand binding is a key property of nuclear receptors, it is still a heated subject of debate if all the nuclear receptors (48 human members) can bind ligands (ligands referred here to both physiological and synthetic ligands). Recent studies in nuclear receptor structure biology and pharmacology have undoubtedly increased our knowledge of nuclear receptor functions and their regulation. As a result, they point to new avenues for the discovery and development of nuclear receptor regulators, including nuclear receptor ligands. Here we review the recent literature on orphan nuclear receptor structural analysis and ligand identification, particularly on the orphan nuclear receptors that do not heterodimerize with retinoid X receptors, which we term as non-X orphan receptors. We also propose a speculative "retinoid hypothesis" for a subset of non-X orphan nuclear receptors, which we hope to help shed light on orphan nuclear receptor biology and drug discovery. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Orphan Nuclear Receptors'. 
Farnesoid X receptor α (FXRα) as a bile acid sensor plays potent roles in multiple metabolic processes, and its antagonist has recently revealed special interests in the treatment of metabolic disorders, although the underlying mechanisms still remain unclear. Here, we identified that the small molecule N-benzyl-N-(3-(tert-butyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl)-2,6-dichloro-4-(dimethylamino) benzamide (NDB) functioned as a selective antagonist of human FXRα (hFXRα), and the crystal structure of hFXRα ligand binding domain (hFXRα-LBD) in complex with NDB was analyzed. It was unexpectedly discovered that NDB induced rearrangements of helix 11 (H11) and helix 12 (H12, AF-2) by forming a homodimer of hFXRα-LBD, totally different from the active conformation in monomer state, and the binding details were further supported by the mutation analysis. Moreover, functional studies demonstrated that NDB effectively antagonized the GW4064-stimulated FXR/RXR interaction and FXRα target gene expression in primary mouse hepatocytes, including the small heterodimer partner (SHP) and bile-salt export pump (BSEP); meanwhile, administration of NDB to db/db mice efficiently decreased the gene expressions of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucose 6-phosphatase (G6-pase), small heterodimer partner, and BSEP. It is expected that our first analyzed crystal structure of hFXRα-LBD·NDB will help expound the antagonistic mechanism of the receptor, and NDB may find its potential as a lead compound in anti-diabetes research. 
This study evaluated HIF-1α inhibitors under different hypoxic conditions, physiological hypoxia (5% O2) and severe hypoxia (0.1% O2). We found that chenodeoxy cholic acid (CDCA) reduced the amount of HIF-1α protein only under physiological hypoxia but not under severe hypoxia without decreasing its mRNA level. By using a proteasome inhibitor MG132 and a translation inhibitor cyclohexamide, we showed that CDCA reduced HIF-1α protein by decreasing its translation but not by enhancing its degradation. The following findings indicated that farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a CDCA receptor and its target gene, Small heterodimer partner (SHP) are not involved in this effect of CDCA. Distinctly from CDCA, MG132 prevented SHP and an exogenous FXR agonist, GW4064 from reducing HIF-1α protein. Furthermore a FXR antagonist, guggulsterone failed to prevent CDCA from decreasing HIF-1α protein. Furthermore, guggulsterone by itself reduced HIF-1α protein even in the presence of MG132. These findings suggested that CDCA and guggulsterone reduced the translation of HIF-1α in a mechanism which FXR and SHP are not involved. This study reveals novel therapeutic functions of traditional nontoxic drugs, CDCA and guggulsterone, as inhibitors of HIF-1α protein. 
While it has long been recognized that bile acids are essential for solubilizing lipophilic nutrients in the small intestine, the discovery in 1999 that bile acids serve as ligands for the nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) opened the floodgates in terms of characterizing their actions as selective signaling molecules. Bile acids act on FXR in ileal enterocytes to induce the expression of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)15/19, an atypical FGF that functions as a hormone. FGF15/19 subsequently acts on a cell surface receptor complex in hepatocytes to repress bile acid synthesis and gluconeogenesis, and to stimulate glycogen and protein synthesis. FGF15/19 also stimulates gallbladder filling. Thus, the bile acid-FXR-FGF15/19 signaling pathway regulates diverse aspects of the postprandial enterohepatic response. Pharmacologically, this endocrine pathway provides exciting new opportunities for treating metabolic disease and bile acid-related disorders such as primary biliary cirrhosis and bile acid diarrhea. Both FXR agonists and FGF19 analogs are currently in clinical trials.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease. Patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) have increased plasmatic and hepatic concentrations of bile acids (BA), suggesting that they can be associated with the progression of the disease. Hepatic nuclear receptors are known to modulate genes controlling BA metabolism; thus, in this work we aimed to compare the expression of liver nuclear receptors -farnesoid X (FXR), small heterodimer partner (SHP) and liver X alpha (LXRα) receptors- and BA transporters -sodium+/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) and bile salt export pump (BSEP)- in liver biopsy samples of patients with simple steatosis (SS) and NASH.
Forty patients with biopsy-proven NALFD were enrolled between 2009 and 2012; liver biopsies were classified as SS (N = 20) or NASH (N = 20) according to the NAFLD activity score. Gene expression of nuclear FXR, LXRα, SHP, NTCP and BSEP was analyzed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and protein level was quantified by western blot.
Gene expression of FXR, SHP, NTCP and BSEP was significantly up-regulated in the NASH group in comparison with SS patients (P &lt; 0.05). In contrast, protein level for FXR, SHP and NTCP was decreased in the NASH patients vs. the SS group (P &lt; 0.05). Gene and protein profile of LXRα did not show differences between groups.
The results suggest that liver nuclear receptors (FXR and SHP) and BA transporters (NTCP and BSEP) are associated with the progression of NAFLD.
An atypical orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP) is known to be regulated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Both of them inhibit TGF-β and Smad signalling and exhibit antifibrotic activity in the liver. However, little is known about the protective effects of SHP and AMPK against hepatitis c virus (HCV)-induced hepatic fibrosis.
Levels of SHP, p-AMPK and fibrotic markers in HCV-infected human liver and in Huh-7.5 cells infected with HCV genotype 2a (JFH-1) were investigated. The effect of adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SHP (Ad-SHP) and AMPK activation via metformin and 5-amino-1-b-D-ribofuranosyl-imidazole-4-carboxamide (AICAR) on fibrotic gene expression was evaluated in HCV-infected cells. Finally, we examined the effect of Ad-SHP and AMPK activators on invasion and activation of LX2 human HSCs induced by conditioned media from HCV-infected hepatocyte (CM).
In HCV-infected human livers and Huh-7.5 cells infected with HCV, SHP mRNA and protein levels were diminished compared with controls, whereas profibrotic factors were increased. Pharmacological AMPK activation recovered SHP expression, and Ad-SHP inhibited HCV-induced fibrotic gene expression. This finding was accompanied by inhibition of HCV-stimulated nuclear factor-kappa B, an inducer of TGF-β. Moreover, CytoSelect invasion assay revealed that enhanced activity and invasiveness of hepatic stellate cells induced by CM.
These results demonstrate that overexpression of SHP and activation of AMPK reverses profibrogenic features of HCV-infected cells by decreasing TGF-β and fibrotic gene expression. These findings provide a rationale for SHP as a possible therapeutic target against HCV-induced hepatic fibrosis.
Small heterodimer partner (SHP, NR0B2) is involved in diverse metabolic pathways, including hepatic bile acid, lipid and glucose homeostasis, and has been implicated in effects on the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a master regulator of adipogenesis and the receptor for antidiabetic drugs thiazolidinediones (TZDs). In this study, we aim to investigate the role of SHP in TZD response by comparing TZD-treated leptin-deficient (ob/ob) and leptin-, SHP-deficient (ob/ob;Shp(-/-)) double mutant mice.
Both ob/ob and double mutant ob/ob;Shp(-/-) mice developed hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia, but hepatic fat accumulation was decreased in the double mutant ob/ob;Shp(-/-) mice. PPARγ2 mRNA levels were markedly lower in ob/ob;Shp(-/-) liver and decreased to a lesser extent in adipose tissue. The TZD troglitazone did not reduce glucose or circulating triglyceride levels in ob/ob;Shp(-/-) mice. Expression of the adipocytokines, such as adiponectin and resistin, was not stimulated by troglitazone treatment. Expression of hepatic lipogenic genes was also reduced in ob/ob;Shp(-/-) mice. Moreover, overexpression of SHP by adenovirus infection increased PPARγ2 mRNA levels in mouse primary hepatocytes.
Our results suggest that SHP is required for both antidiabetic and hypolipidemic effects of TZDs in ob/ob mice through regulation of PPARγ expression.
Cholestasis activates bile acid receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and subsequently enhances hepatic expression of small heterodimer partner (SHP). We previously demonstrated that SHP represses the transactivation of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) promoter by hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 4α. In this study, we investigated the effects of estrogen-induced cholestasis on CYP2D6 expression. Estrogen-induced cholestasis occurs in subjects receiving estrogen for contraception or hormone replacement, or in susceptible women during pregnancy. In CYP2D6-humanized transgenic (Tg-CYP2D6) mice, cholestasis triggered by administration of 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) at a high dose led to 2- to 3-fold decreases in CYP2D6 expression. This was accompanied by increased hepatic SHP expression and subsequent decreases in the recruitment of HNF4α to CYP2D6 promoter. Interestingly, estrogen-induced cholestasis also led to increased recruitment of estrogen receptor (ER) α, but not that of FXR, to Shp promoter, suggesting a predominant role of ERα in transcriptional regulation of SHP in estrogen-induced cholestasis. EE2 at a low dose (that does not cause cholestasis) also increased SHP (by ∼ 50%) and decreased CYP2D6 expression (by 1.5-fold) in Tg-CYP2D6 mice, the magnitude of differences being much smaller than that shown in EE2-induced cholestasis. Taken together, our data indicate that EE2-induced cholestasis increases SHP and represses CYP2D6 expression in Tg-CYP2D6 mice in part through ERα transactivation of Shp promoter.
Adipocytes play a critical role in energy balance. Growth of fat tissue is achieved via an increase in adipocyte mass and the formation of newly differentiated adipocytes from precursor cells. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of adipocyte differentiation is crucial for the study of obesity- and fat-related diseases. The present study was designed to study whether small heterodimer partner-interacting leucine zipper protein (SMILE), a novel co-repressor, could regulate differentiation of adipocyte in 3T3-L1 cells.
Treatment of endoplasmic stress inducers, thapsigargin and tunicamycin, inhibited adipocyte differentiation, stimulated Smile mRNA expression, and repressed the expression of adiponectin (Adipoq) in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte. Overexpression of SMILE in 3T3-L1 cells decreased the expression of the mRNA encoding Adipoq, a major marker of adipocytes, significantly. Furthermore, knockdown of SMILE recovered the thapsigargin-mediated repression of Adipoq transcription. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that SMILE interacted physically with PPARγ in 3T3-L1 cells. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that SMILE suppressed the binding affinity of PPARγ for the Adipoq promoter.
We demonstrate that SMILE controls adipocyte differentiation by regulating the transactivity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ).
These findings demonstrate that SMILE represses adipocyte differentiation by regulating PPARγ transactivity; hence, SMILE is a potential regulator of PPARγ-related diseases.
Estrogen participates in the control of energy homeostasis and lipid metabolism. However the role of hepatic estrogen receptor α (ERα) in triglyceride (TG) homeostasis remains poorly understood. This study aims to investigate the roles of estrogen and ERα in the regulation of hepatic TG metabolism.
Liver TG metabolism was analyzed in female mice with ovariectomy or tamoxifen treatment, and in hepatic ERα knockdown or overexpression. Phenotypes and expression of genes were compared in male and female mice with farnesoid X receptor deficiency. The mechanism of ERα in the regulation of small heterodimer partner (SHP) expression was further investigated.
Female mice receiving ovariectomy or tamoxifen treatment exhibited hepatic TG accumulation. Ablation of ERα using adenoviral shRNA markedly increased hepatic TG accumulation, while overexpression of ERα ameliorated hepatosteatosis in obese mice. At the molecular level, estrogen upregulated hepatic SHP expression through binding to its proximal promoter. In addition, the roles of estrogen were largely blunted in mice with SHP deficiency.
These findings reveal a novel role of estrogen in improving hepatosteatosis through upregulation of SHP expression.
Hyperhomocysteinemia is often associated with liver and metabolic diseases. We studied nuclear receptors that mediate oscillatory control of homocysteine homeostasis in mice.
We studied mice with disruptions in Nr0b2 (called small heterodimer partner [SHP]-null mice), betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase (Bhmt), or both genes (BHMT-null/SHP-null mice), along with mice with wild-type copies of these genes (controls). Hyperhomocysteinemia was induced by feeding mice alcohol (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism binge model) or chow diets along with water containing 0.18% DL-homocysteine. Some mice were placed on diets containing cholic acid (1%) or cholestyramine (2%) or high-fat diets (60%). Serum and livers were collected during a 24-hour light-dark cycle and analyzed by RNA-seq, metabolomic, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunoblot, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays.
SHP-null mice had altered timing in expression of genes that regulate homocysteine metabolism compared with control mice. Oscillatory production of S-adenosylmethionine, betaine, choline, phosphocholine, glyceophosphocholine, cystathionine, cysteine, hydrogen sulfide, glutathione disulfide, and glutathione, differed between SHP-null mice and control mice. SHP inhibited transcriptional activation of Bhmt and cystathionine γ-lyase by FOXA1. Expression of Bhmt and cystathionine γ-lyase was decreased when mice were fed cholic acid but increased when they were placed on diets containing cholestyramine or high-fat content. Diets containing ethanol or homocysteine induced hyperhomocysteinemia and glucose intolerance in control, but not SHP-null, mice. In BHMT-null and BHMT-null/SHP-null mice fed a control liquid, lipid vacuoles were observed in livers. Ethanol feeding induced accumulation of macrovesicular lipid vacuoles to the greatest extent in BHMT-null and BHMT-null/SHP-null mice.
Disruption of Shp in mice alters timing of expression of genes that regulate homocysteine metabolism and the liver responses to ethanol and homocysteine. SHP inhibits the transcriptional activation of Bhmt and cystathionine γ-lyase by FOXA1.
Fibroblast growth factors 19 and 21 (FGF19 and FGF21) have been implicated, independently, in type 2 diabetes (T2D) but it is not known if their circulating levels correlate with each other or whether the associated hepatic signaling mechanisms that play a role in glucose metabolism are dysregulated in diabetes. We used a cross-sectional, case/control, experimental design involving Class III obese patients undergoing Roux-en-Y bariatric surgery (RYGB), and measured FGF19 and FGF21 serum levels and hepatic gene expression (mRNA) in perioperative liver wedge biopsies. We found that T2D patients had lower FGF19 and higher FGF21 serum levels. The latter was corroborated transcriptionally, whereby, FGF21, as well as CYP7A1, β-Klotho, FGFR4, HNF4α, and glycogen synthase, but not of SHP or FXR mRNA levels in liver biopsies were higher in T2D patients that did not remit diabetes after RYGB surgery, compared to T2D patients that remitted diabetes after RYGB surgery or did not have diabetes. In a Phenome-wide association analysis using 205 clinical variables, higher FGF21 serum levels were associated with higher glucose levels and various cardiometabolic disease phenotypes. When serum levels of FGF19 were &lt; 200 mg/mL and FGF21 &gt; 500 mg/mL, 91% of patients had diabetes. These data suggest that FGF19/FGF21 circulating levels and hepatic gene expression of the associated signaling pathway are significantly dysregulated in type 2 diabetes. 
Excessive activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome results in damaging inflammation, yet the regulators of this process remain poorly defined. Herein, we show that the orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP) is a negative regulator of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. NLRP3 inflammasome activation leads to an interaction between SHP and NLRP3, proteins that are both recruited to mitochondria. Overexpression of SHP competitively inhibits binding of NLRP3 to apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC). SHP deficiency results in increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, and excessive pathologic responses typically observed in mouse models of kidney tubular necrosis and peritoneal gout. Notably, the loss of SHP results in accumulation of damaged mitochondria and a sustained interaction between NLRP3 and ASC in the endoplasmic reticulum. These data are suggestive of a role for SHP in controlling NLRP3 inflammasome activation through a mechanism involving interaction with NLRP3 and maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis. 
Intrahepatic cholestasis is a clinical syndrome with systemic and intrahepatic accumulation of excessive toxic bile acids that ultimately cause hepatobiliary injury. Appropriate regulation of bile acids in hepatocytes is critically important for protection against liver injury. In the present study, we characterized the protective effect of alisol B 23-acetate (AB23A), a natural triterpenoid, on alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT)-induced liver injury and intrahepatic cholestasis in mice and further elucidated the mechanisms in vivo and in vitro. AB23A treatment dose-dependently protected against liver injury induced by ANIT through reducing hepatic uptake and increasing efflux of bile acid via down-regulation of hepatic uptake transporters (Ntcp) and up-regulation of efflux transporter (Bsep, Mrp2 and Mdr2) expression. Furthermore, AB23A reduced bile acid synthesis through repressing Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1, increased bile acid conjugation through inducing Bal, Baat and bile acid metabolism through an induction in gene expression of Sult2a1. We further demonstrate the involvement of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in the hepatoprotective effect of AB23A. The changes in transporters and enzymes, as well as ameliorative liver histology in AB23A-treated mice were abrogated by FXR antagonist guggulsterone in vivo. In vitro evidences also directly demonstrated the effect of AB23A on FXR activation in a dose-dependent manner using luciferase reporter assay in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, AB23A produces protective effect against ANIT-induced hepatotoxity and cholestasis, due to FXR-mediated regulation of transporters and enzymes. 
Sodium meta-arsenite (SA) is implicated in the regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis-related genes in vitro; however, the effects in vivo have not been studied. We investigated whether SA has antidiabetic effects in a type 2 diabetic mouse model. Diabetic db/db mice were orally intubated with SA (10 mg kg(-1) body weight/day) for 8 weeks. We examined hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), blood glucose levels, food intake, and body weight. We performed glucose, insulin, and pyruvate tolerance tests and analyzed glucose production and the expression of gluconeogenesis-related genes in hepatocytes. We analyzed energy metabolism using a comprehensive animal metabolic monitoring system. SA-treated diabetic db/db mice had reduced concentrations of HbA1c and blood glucose levels. Exogenous glucose was quickly cleared in glucose tolerance tests. The mRNA expressions of genes for gluconeogenesis-related enzymes, glucose 6-phosphatase (G6Pase), and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) were significantly reduced in the liver of SA-treated diabetic db/db mice. In primary hepatocytes, SA treatment decreased glucose production and the expression of G6Pase, PEPCK, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF-4α) mRNA. Small heterodimer partner (SHP) mRNA expression was increased in hepatocytes dependent upon the SA concentration. The expression of Sirt1 mRNA and protein was reduced, and acetylated forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) was induced by SA treatment in hepatocytes. In addition, SA-treated diabetic db/db mice showed reduced energy expenditure. Oral intubation of SA ameliorates hyperglycemia in db/db mice by reducing hepatic gluconeogenesis through the decrease of Sirt1 expression and increase in acetylated FoxO1.
We have recently reported that transactivation of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 promoter by hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 4α is enhanced during pregnancy, and this is triggered in part by altered expression of small heterodimer partner (SHP) and Krüppel-like factor 9 (KLF9). The objective of this study is to determine whether this is conserved for mouse endogenous Cyp2d gene(s). Among the eight Cyp2d homologs of mouse we examined, only Cyp2d40 expression was found induced (by 6-fold) at term pregnancy as compared to pre-pregnancy level. In mice where hepatic Hnf4α was knocked-down, the pregnancy-mediated increase in Cyp2d40 expression was abrogated. Results from transient transfection, promoter reporter assays, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that HNF4α transactivates Cyp2d40 promoter via direct binding to -117/-105 of the gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed a 2.3-fold increase in HNF4α recruitment to Cyp2d40 promoter during pregnancy. Results from mice treated with an SHP inducer (i.e., GW4064) and HepG2 cells co-transfected with KLF9 suggest that neither SHP nor KLF9 is involved in the increased HNF4α transactivation of Cyp2d40 promoter during pregnancy. Together, our results indicate that while the underlying molecular mechanism is different from that for CYP2D6, Cyp2d40 is induced during pregnancy through enhanced transactivation by HNF4α. 
The small heterodimer partner (SHP) (NR0B2) is an atypical nuclear receptor that lacks a DNA-binding domain. It interacts with and inhibits many transcription factors, affecting key metabolic processes, including bile acid, cholesterol, fatty acid, and drug metabolism. Our aim was to determine the influence of steatotic drugs and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) on SHP expression and investigate the potential mechanisms. SHP was found to be repressed by steatotic drugs (valproate, doxycycline, tetracycline, and cyclosporin A) in cultured hepatic cells and the livers of different animal models of NAFLD: iatrogenic (tetracycline-treated rats), genetic (glycine N-methyltransferase-deficient mice), and nutritional (mice fed a methionine- and choline-deficient diet). Among the different transcription factors investigated, CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) showed the strongest dominant-repressive effect on SHP expression in HepG2 and human hepatocytes. Reporter assays revealed that the inhibitory effect of C/EBPα and steatotic drugs colocalize between -340 and -509 base pair of the SHP promoter, and mutation of a predicted C/EBPα response element at -473 base pair abolished SHP repression by both C/EBPα and drugs. Moreover, inhibition of major stress signaling pathways demonstrated that the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 pathway activates, while the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase pathway represses SHP in a C/EBP-dependent manner. We conclude that SHP is downregulated by several steatotic drugs and in advanced NAFLD. These conditions can activate signals that target C/EBPα and consequently repress SHP, thus favoring the progression and severity of NAFLD. 
Bile acids (BAs) function as endocrine signaling molecules that activate multiple nuclear and membrane receptor signaling pathways to control fed-state metabolism. Since the detergent-like property of BAs causes liver damage at high concentrations, hepatic BA levels must be tightly regulated. Bile acid homeostasis is regulated largely at the level of transcription by nuclear receptors, particularly the primary BA receptor, farnesoid X receptor, and small heterodimer partner, which inhibits BA synthesis by recruiting repressive histone-modifying enzymes. Although histone modifiers have been shown to regulate BA-responsive genes, their in vivo functions remain unclear. Here, we show that lysine-specific histone demethylase1 (LSD1) is directly induced by BA-activated farnesoid X receptor, is recruited to the BA synthetic genes Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1 and the BA uptake transporter gene Ntcp, and removes a gene-activation marker, trimethylated histone H3 lysine-4, leading to gene repression. Recruitment of LSD1 was dependent on small heterodimer partner, and LSD1-mediated demethylation of trimethylated histone H3 lysine-4 was required for additional repressive histone modifications, acetylated histone 3 on lysine 9 and 14 deacetylation, and acetylated histone 3 on lysine 9 methylation. A BA overload, feeding 0.5% cholic acid chow for 6 days, resulted in adaptive responses of altered expression of hepatic genes involved in BA synthesis, transport, and detoxification/conjugation. In contrast, adenovirus-mediated downregulation of hepatic LSD1 blunted these responses, which led to substantial increases in liver and serum BA levels, serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, and hepatic inflammation.
This study identifies LSD1 as a novel histone-modifying enzyme in the orchestrated regulation mediated by the farnesoid X receptor and small heterodimer partner that reduces hepatic BA levels and protects the liver against BA toxicity.
The small heterodimer partner (SHP, nuclear receptor subfamily 0, group B, member 2; NR0B2) is an atypical nuclear receptor known mainly for its role in bile acid homeostasis in the enterohepatic tract. We previously showed that NR0B2 controls testicular functions such as testosterone synthesis. Moreover, NR0B2 mediates the deleterious testicular effects of estrogenic endocrine disruptors leading to infertility. The endocrine homeostasis is essential for health, because it controls many physiological functions. This is supported by a large number of studies demonstrating that alterations of steroid activity lead to several kinds of diseases such as obesity and infertility. Within the testis, the functions of the Leydig cells are mainly controlled by the hypothalamo-pituitary axis via LH/chorionic gonadotropin (CG). Here, we show that LH/CG represses Nr0b2 expression through the protein kinase A-AMP protein kinase pathway. Moreover, using a transgenic mouse model invalidated for Nr0b2, we point out that NR0B2 mediates the repression of testosterone synthesis and subsequent germ cell apoptosis induced by exposure to anti-GnRH compound. Together, our data demonstrate a new link between hypothalamo-pituitary axis and NR0B2 in testicular androgen metabolism, making NR0B2 a major actor of testicular physiology in case of alteration of LH/CG levels.
Bile acids (BA) are elevated after vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) and farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR) is critical to the success of murine VSG. BA downregulate hepatic lipogenesis by activating the FXR-small heterodimer partner (SHP) pathway. The role of SHP in fatty liver disease improvement after VSG was tested.
Wild type (WT), SHP liver transgenic (SHP-Tg), and SHP knockout (SHP-KO) high-fat diet (HFD) fed mice underwent either VSG or Sham surgery. Body weight, BA level and composition, steatosis, and BA metabolism gene expression were evaluated.
Obese WT mice post-VSG lost weight, reduced steatosis, decreased plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT), had more BA absorptive ileal area, and elevated serum BA. Obese SHP-Tg mice post-VSG also lost weight and had decreased steatosis. SHP-KO mice were however resistant to steatosis despite weight gain on a HFD. Further SHP-KO mice that underwent VSG lost weight, but developed hepatic inflammation and had increased ALT.
VSG produces weight loss independent of SHP status. SHP ablation creates a proinflammatory phenotype which is exacerbated after VSG despite weight loss. These inflammatory alterations are possibly related to factors extrinsic to a direct manifestation of NASH.
Liver physiology is sensitive to estrogens, which suggests that the liver might be a target of estrogenic endocrine disrupters (EED). However, the long-term consequences of neonatal exposure to EED on liver physiology have rarely been studied. The nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP) mediates the deleterious effects of neonatal exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) on male fertility.
As SHP is involved in liver homeostasis, we aimed to determine whether neonatal estrogenic exposure also affected adult liver physiology through SHP. Male mouse pups were exposed to DES in the first 5 days of life.
DES exposure leads to alterations in the postnatal bile acid (BA) synthesis pathway. Neonatal DES-exposure affected adult liver BA metabolism and subsequently triglyceride (TG) homeostasis. The wild-type males neonatally exposed to DES exhibited increased liver weight and altered liver histology in the adult age. The use of deficient male mice revealed that SHP mediates the deleterious effects of DES treatment. These long-term effects of DES were associated with differently timed alterations in the expression of epigenetic factors.
However, the molecular mechanisms by which neonatal exposure persist to affect the adult liver physiology remain to be defined. In conclusion, we demonstrate that neonatal DES exposure alters adult hepatic physiology in an SHP-dependent manner.
In mammals, circadian rhythms are essential for coordinating the timing of various metabolic processes. The Clock gene regulates diurnal plasma triglyceride fluctuation through nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (Shp; Nr0b2). Given that SHP is a critical regulator of metabolism in the liver, it is unknown whether SHP is necessary to coordinate metabolism and circadian rhythms. Shp(+/+) and Shp(-/-) mice on a C57BL/6 background (n = 3-5/group) were fed a standard chow diet and water ad libitum. Serum and livers were collected at zeitgeber time 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, and 22. In vivo and in vitro assays included RNA sequencing, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, very-low-density lipoprotein production, adenovirus overexpression and small interfering RNA knockdown, serum parameters, circadian locomotor activity, Oil Red O staining, transient transfection, luciferase reporter assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, gel-shift assay, coimmunoprecipitation, and western blottings. Shp deficiency had a robust global impact on major liver metabolic genes. Several components of the liver clock, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, coactivator 1 (Pgc-1α), neuronal PAS domain-containing protein 2 (Npas2), and retinoic acid-related orphan receptor (Ror)α/γ were sharply induced in Shp(-/-) liver. At the molecular level, SHP inhibited Npas2 gene transcription and promoter activity through interaction with Rorγ to repress Rorγ transactivation and by interacting with Rev-erbα to enhance its inhibition of Rorα activity. Conversely, Npas2 controlled the circadian rhythm of Shp expression by binding rhythmically to the Shp promoter, which was enhanced by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, but not nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate. Phenotypically, Npas2 deficiency induced severe steatosis in Shp(-/-) mice, which was attributed to the dysregulation of lipoprotein metabolism.
Shp and Npas2 crosstalk is essential to maintain hepatic lipid homeostasis.
Bile salts inhibit their own production by inducing the nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP) (encoded by NR0B2), which contributes to repression of the gene encoding cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), a key enzyme for the control of bile salt synthesis. On the other hand, bile salts stimulate hepatic synthesis of nitric oxide. We investigated the role of nitric oxide signaling in the control of CYP7A1 expression and the involvement in this process of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), which participates in intracellular propagation of nitric oxide signals.
We studied the effects of inhibitors of nitric oxide synthesis (L-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester [L-NAME]) or protein nitrosylation (via dithiothreitol) on bile salt homeostasis in male Wistar rats placed on a cholate-rich diet for 5 days and in cultured primary hepatocytes. S-nitrosylation of GAPDH was assessed using a biotin-switch assay. Interacions of SHP with other proteins and with the Cyp7a1 promoter sequence were studied using immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. We reduced the GAPDH levels in H35 cells with small interfering RNAs. GAPDH nitrosylation was assessed in normal and cholestatic rat and human livers.
Rats placed on cholate-rich diets and given L-NAME had increased intrahepatic and biliary levels of bile salts, and deficiency in repression of CYP7A1 (at the messenger RNA and protein levels) in liver tissue, despite preserved induction of SHP. In cultured hepatocytes, L-NAME or dithiothreitol blocked cholate-induced down-regulation of CYP7A1 without impairing SHP up-regulation. In hepatocytes, cholate promoted S-nitrosylation of GAPDH and its translocation to the nucleus, accompanied by S-nitrosylation of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), deacetylases that participate, respectively, in the formation of Cyp7a1 and Shp repressor complexes. Knockdown of GAPDH prevented repression of CYP7A1 by cholate, and blocking nuclear transport of nitrosylated GAPDH reduced cholate-induced nitrosylation of HDAC2 and SIRT1; this effect was accompanied by abrogation of Cyp7a1 repression. Cholate induced binding of SHP to HDAC2 and its recruitment to the Cyp7a1 promoter; these processes were inhibited by blocking nitric oxide synthesis. Levels of nitrosylated GAPDH and nitrosylated HDAC2 were increased in cholestatic human and rat livers reflecting increased concentrations of bile salts in these conditions.
In rat liver, excess levels of bile salts activate a GAPDH-mediated transnitrosylation cascade that provides feedback inhibition of bile salt synthesis.
Small heterodimer partner (SHP; NR0B2) is an atypical orphan nuclear receptor that lacks a conventional DNA-binding domain. Through interactions with other transcription factors, SHP regulates diverse biological events, including glucose metabolism in liver. However, the role of SHP in adult heart diseases has not yet been demonstrated.
We aimed to investigate the role of SHP in adult heart in association with cardiac hypertrophy.
The roles of SHP in cardiac hypertrophy were tested in primary cultured cardiomyocytes and in animal models. SHP-null mice showed a hypertrophic phenotype. Hypertrophic stresses repressed the expression of SHP, whereas forced expression of SHP blocked the development of hypertrophy in cardiomyocytes. SHP reduced the protein amount of Gata6 and, by direct physical interaction with Gata6, interfered with the binding of Gata6 to GATA-binding elements in the promoter regions of natriuretic peptide precursor type A. Metformin, an antidiabetic agent, induced SHP and suppressed cardiac hypertrophy. The metformin-induced antihypertrophic effect was attenuated either by SHP small interfering RNA in cardiomyocytes or in SHP-null mice.
These results establish SHP as a novel antihypertrophic regulator that acts by interfering with GATA6 signaling. SHP may participate in the metformin-induced antihypertrophic response.
Retinoic acid (RA) affects multiple aspects of development, embryogenesis and cell differentiation processes. The liver is a major organ that stores RA suggesting that retinoids play an important role in the function of hepatocytes. In our previous studies, we have demonstrated the involvement of small heterodimer partner (SHP) in RA-induced signaling in a non-transformed hepatic cell line AML 12. In the present study, we have identified several critical genes in lipid homeostasis (Apoa1, Apoa2 and ApoF) that are repressed by RA-treatment in a SHP dependent manner, in vitro and also in vivo with the use of the SHP null mice. In a similar manner, RA also represses several critical genes involved in bile acid metabolism (Cyp7a1, Cyp8b1, Mdr2, Bsep, Baat and Ntcp) via upregulation of SHP. Collectively our data suggest that SHP plays a major role in RA-induced potential changes in pathophysiology of metabolic disorders in the liver. 
Bile acids or its derivatives may influence non-alcoholic fatty liver disease development through multiple mechanisms. Intestinal L-cells secrete glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and can be activated by bile acids (BA) influencing insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis development and progression. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of cholic acid (CA) or ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) administration on portal and systemic levels of GLP-1 in genetically obese mice with established hepatic steatosis. Eight-week-old ob/ob mice were fed CA or UDCA during 4 weeks. Systemic and portal GLP-1 levels were measured as well as glucose tolerance test, serum and biliary parameters, hepatic triglyceride content, liver histology, and hepatic gene expression of relevant genes related to bile secretion. Eight-week-old ob/ob mice exhibited marked obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and fasting hyperglycemia. Administration of both CA and UDCA was associated to decreased hepatic triglyceride content and complete reversion of histological steatosis. BA-fed animals did not exhibit significant differences in glucose tolerance. In addition, neither CA nor UDCA administration significantly influenced portal or systemic GLP-1 levels. CA and UDCA strongly ameliorated established fatty liver in ob/ob mice independently of the GLP-1 incretin pathway. Thus, the anti-steatotic action of these bile acids is likely related to direct hepatic effects. 
Several studies using different animal models have demonstrated that the consumption of soya protein (SP) reduces serum cholesterol concentrations by increasing the excretion of bile acids (BA). However, the mechanism by which SP enhances BA excretion is not fully understood. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine whether the consumption of SP regulates the expression of key enzymes involved in hepatic BA synthesis and the transporters involved in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) via fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15) and/or small heterodimer protein (SHP) in rats. To achieve this aim, four groups of rats were fed experimental diets containing 20 % casein (C) or SP with or without the addition of 0·2 % cholesterol and the expression of hepatic genes involved in BA synthesis and the ileal and hepatic RCT was measured. Rats fed the SP diet had higher concentrations of ileal FGF15 and hepatic FGF15 receptor (FGFR4) and increased expression of SHP and liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH1) than those fed the C diet; as a result, the excretion of faecal BA was greater. The addition of cholesterol to the diet repressed the protein abundance of FGF15 and FGFR4; however, SP increased the expression of SHP and LRH1 to a lesser extent. Nonetheless, the expression of ABCG5/8 was increased in the intestine of rats fed the SP diet, and the effect was enhanced by the addition of cholesterol to the diet. In conclusion, SP in the presence of cholesterol increases BA synthesis via the repressions of FGF15 and SHP and accelerates BA excretion to prevent cholesterol overload in the enterocytes by increasing RCT.
E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) is an important regulator of metabolic diseases; however, its role in liver function remains elusive. This study unraveled a regulatory cascade involving E2F1, early growth response-1 (Egr-1), nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP, NR0B2), and EIA-like inhibitor of differentiation 1 (EID1) in cholestatic liver fibrosis. Liver E2F1 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression was strongly up-regulated in human nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and alcohol cirrhosis; the latter was inversely correlated with diminished SHP expression. E2F1 was also highly induced by 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1, 4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) feeding and bile-duct ligation (BDL) in mice. E2F1-/- mice exhibited reduced biliary fibrosis by DDC as determined by Masson Trichrome and Picro Sirius red staining, and decreased serum bile acid (BA), BA pool size, and fecal BA excretion. In addition, cholestatic liver fibrosis induced by BDL, as determined by immunohistochemistry analysis of a1 collagen expression, was increased in SHP-/- mice but attenuated in hepatocyte SHP-overexpressed transgenic (STG) mice. Egr-1 exhibited marked induction in livers of SHP-/- mice compared to the wild-type mice in both sham and BDL groups, and reduction in STG livers. Egr-1 promoter was activated by E2F1, and the activation was abrogated by expression of SHP and its co-repressor EID1 in hepatoma cells Huh7, Hepa1, and stellate cells LX2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays further confirmed the association of E2F1, SHP, and EID1 proteins with the Egr-1 promoter, and their direct protein interactions were determined by glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays. Interestingly, E2F1 activated Egr-1 expression in a biphasic fashion as described in both human and mouse hepatocytes.
E2F1 is a fibrogenic gene and could serve as a potential new diagnostic marker for nonalcoholic and alcoholic liver fibrosis/cirrhosis.
Farnesoid X receptor/retinoid X receptor-alpha (FXR/RXRα) is the master transcriptional regulator of bile salt synthesis and transport in liver and intestine. FXR is activated by bile acids, RXRα by the vitamin A-derivative 9-cis retinoic acid (9cRA). Remarkably, 9cRA inhibits binding of FXR/RXRα to its response element, an inverted repeat-1 (IR-1). Still, most FXR/RXRα target genes are maximally expressed in the presence of both ligands, including the small heterodimer partner (SHP). Here, we revisited the FXR/RXRα-mediated regulation of human SHP.
A 579-bp hSHP promoter element was analyzed to locate FXR/chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA)- and RXRα/9cRA-responsive elements. hSHP promoter constructs were analyzed in FXR/RXRα-transfected DLD-1, HEK293 and HepG2 cells exposed to CDCA, GW4064 (synthetic FXR ligand) and/or 9cRA. FXR-DNA interactions were analyzed by in vitro pull down assays.
hSHP promoter elements lacking the previously identified IR-1 (-291/-279) largely maintained their activation by FXR/CDCA, but were unresponsive to 9cRA. FXR-mediated activation of the hSHP promoter was primarily dependent on the -122/-69 region. Pull down assays revealed a direct binding of FXR to the -122/-69 sequence, which was abrogated by site-specific mutations in a binding site for the liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) at -78/-70. These mutations strongly impaired the FXR/CDCA-mediated activation, even in the context of a hSHP promoter containing the IR-1. LRH-1 did not increase FXR/RXRα-mediated activation of hSHP promoter activity.
FXR/CDCA-activated expression of SHP is primarily mediated through direct binding to an LRH-1 binding site, which is not modulated by LRH-1 and unresponsive to 9cRA. 9cRA-induced expression of SHP requires the IR-1 that overlaps with a direct repeat-2 (DR-2) and DR-4. This establishes for the first time a co-stimulatory, but independent, action of FXR and RXRα agonists.
The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is mainly expressed in liver, intestine and kidney. We investigated whether 6-ethyl chenodeoxycholic acid (6ECDCA), a semisynthetic derivative of chenodeoxycholic aicd (CDCA, an FXR ligand), protects against kidney injury and modulates small heterodimer partner (SHP) in cisplatin-induced kidney injury. Cisplatin inhibited SHP protein expression in the kidney of cisplatin-treated mice and human proximal tubular (HK2) cells; this effect was counteracted by FXR ligand. Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed the presence of tubular casts, obstructions and dilatations in cisplatin-induced kidney injury, which was attenuated by FXR ligand. FXR ligand also attenuated protein expression of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), Smad signaling, and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition process, inflammatory markers and cytokines, and apoptotic markers in cisplatin-treated mice. Cisplatin induced NF-κB activation in HK2 cell; this effect was attenuated by pretreatment with FXR ligand. In SHP knockdown by small interfering RNA, cisplatin-induced activation of TGF-β1, p-JNK and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio was not attenuated, while SHP overexpression and FXR ligand inhibited expression of these proteins in cisplatin-pretreated HK2 cells. In conclusion, FXR ligand, 6ECDCA prevents cisplatin-induced kidney injury, the underlying mechanism of which may be associated with anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects through SHP induction.
To investigate the effect of bile acid on the expression of histidine decarboxylase (HDC), which is a major enzyme involved in histamine production, and gene expression of gastric transcription factors upon cooperative activation.
HDC expression was examined by immunohistochemistry, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and promoter assay in human gastric precancerous tissues, normal stomach tissue, and gastric cancer cell lines. The relationship between gastric precancerous state and HDC expression induced by bile acid was determined. The association between the expression of HDC and various specific transcription factors in gastric cells was also evaluated. MKN45 and AGS human gastric carcinoma cell lines were transfected with farnesoid X receptor (FXR), small heterodimer partner (SHP), and caudal-type homeodomain transcription factor (CDX)1 expression plasmids. The effects of various transcription factors on HDC expression were monitored by luciferase-reporter promoter assay.
Histamine production and secretion in the stomach play critical roles in gastric acid secretion and in the pathogenesis of gastric diseases. Here, we show that bile acid increased the expression of HDC, which is a rate-limiting enzyme of the histamine production pathway. FXR was found to be a primary regulatory transcription factor for bile acid-induced HDC expression. In addition, the transcription factors CDX1 and SHP synergistically enhanced bile acid-induced elevation of HDC gene expression. We confirmed similar expression patterns for HDC, CDX1, and SHP in patient tissues.
HDC production in the stomach is associated with bile acid exposure and its related transcriptional regulation network of FXR, SHP, and CDX1.
Small heterodimer partner (SHP) is an orphan nuclear receptor that functions as a transcriptional repressor to regulate bile acid and cholesterol homeostasis. Although the precise mechanism whereby SHP represses transcription is not known, E1A-like inhibitor of differentiation (EID1) was isolated as a SHP-interacting protein and implicated in SHP repression. Here we present the crystal structure of SHP in complex with EID1, which reveals an unexpected EID1-binding site on SHP. Unlike the classical cofactor-binding site near the C-terminal helix H12, the EID1-binding site is located at the N terminus of the receptor, where EID1 mimics helix H1 of the nuclear receptor ligand-binding domain. The residues composing the SHP-EID1 interface are highly conserved. Their mutation diminishes SHP-EID1 interactions and affects SHP repressor activity. Together, these results provide important structural insights into SHP cofactor recruitment and repressor function and reveal a conserved protein interface that is likely to have broad implications for transcriptional repression by orphan nuclear receptors. 
Little is known about the effects of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) on hepatic activity of human cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and cholesterol metabolism. We studied these processes in mice in vivo and mouse and human hepatocytes.
Farnesoid X receptor (Fxr)(-/-), small heterodimer partner (Shp)(-/-), and C57BL/6 (wild-type control) mice were fed normal or Western diets for 3 weeks and were then given intraperitoneal injections of vehicle (corn oil) or 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25[OH]2D3; 4 doses, 2.5 μg/kg, every other day). Plasma and tissue samples were collected and levels of Vdr, Shp, Cyp7a1, Cyp24a1, and rodent fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) 15 expression, as well as levels of cholesterol, were measured. We studied the regulation of Shp by Vdr using reporter and mobility shift assays in transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells, quantitative polymerase chain reaction with mouse tissues and mouse and human hepatocytes, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with mouse liver.
We first confirmed the presence of Vdr mRNA and protein expression in livers of mice. In mice fed normal diets and given injections of 1,25(OH)2D3, liver and plasma concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D3 increased and decreased in unison. Changes in hepatic Cyp7a1 messenger RNA (mRNA) correlated with those of Cyp24a1 (a Vdr target gene) and inversely with Shp mRNA, but not ileal Fgf15 mRNA. Similarly, incubation with 1,25(OH)2D3 increased levels of Cyp24a1/CYP24A1 and Cyp7a1/CYP7A1 mRNA in mouse and human hepatocytes, and reduced levels of Shp mRNA in mouse hepatocytes. In Fxr(-/-) and wild-type mice with hypercholesterolemia, injection of 1,25(OH)2D3 consistently reduced levels of plasma and liver cholesterol and Shp mRNA, and increased hepatic Cyp7a1 mRNA and protein; these changes were not observed in Shp(-/-) mice given 1,25(OH)2D3 and fed Western diets. Truncation of the human small heterodimer partner (SHP) promoter and deletion analyses revealed VDR-dependent inhibition of SHP, and mobility shift assays showed direct binding of VDR to enhancer regions of SHP. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of livers from mice showed that injection of 1,25(OH)2D3 increased recruitment of Vdr and rodent retinoid X receptor to the Shp promoter.
Activation of the VDR represses hepatic SHP to increase levels of mouse and human CYP7A1 and reduce cholesterol.
We aimed to elucidate the mechanism underlying the anti-dyslipidemic effect of compound-T3, a farnesoid X receptor antagonist, by investigating its effects on hepatic lipid metabolism in non-human primates. We administered lipid-lowering drugs for 7 days to cynomolgus monkeys receiving a high-fat diet, and subsequently measured the levels of lipid parameters in plasma, feces, and hepatic tissue fluids. Compound-T3 (0.3 and 3mg/kg p.o.) significantly decreased the plasma levels of non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein B in a dose-dependent manner. It also decreased the mRNA levels of hepatic small heterodimer partner-1, induced the mRNA expression of hepatic cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, reduced hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride levels, increased fecal bile acid excretion, and upregulated the expression of hepatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. Furthermore, compound-T3 significantly increased plasma HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I levels. The mRNA expression levels of hepatic apolipoprotein A-I tended to increase after compound-T3 treatment. Compound-T3 also induced accumulation of hepatic bile acids and decreased the mRNA expression levels of the hepatic bile acid export pump. The effects of cholestyramine (300mg/kg p.o.) on the plasma and hepatic lipid parameters were similar to those of compound-T3, and it increased fecal bile acid levels without causing accumulation of hepatic bile acids. These findings suggest that LDL receptor-mediated hepatic LDL incorporation due to cholesterol catabolism catalyzed by cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase decreases plasma non-HDL cholesterol levels. Upregulation of hepatic apolipoprotein A-I mRNA expression may partially contribute to the increase in HDL cholesterol levels mediated by compound-T3. 
Transcription factor NF-κB promotes cell proliferation in response to cell injury. Increasing evidence, however, suggests that NF-κB can also play an apoptotic role depending on the stimulus and cell type. We have previously demonstrated that novel retinoid 4-[3-Cl-(1-adamantyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl]-3-chlorocinnamic acid (3-Cl-AHPC)-mediated apoptosis in breast carcinoma cells requires activation of canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways. The mechanism NF-κB uses to induce apoptosis remains largely unknown. NF-κB subunit p65 (RelA) was identified as one potent transcriptional activator in 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated apoptosis in cells. Here we used ChIP-on-chip to identify NF-κB p65 genes activated in 3-Cl-AHPC mediated apoptosis. This paper focuses on one hit: pro-apoptotic protein programmed cell death 5 (PDCD5). 3-Cl-AHPC mediated apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 had three related effects on PDCD5: NF-κB p65 binding to the PDCD5 gene, enhanced PDCD5 promoter activity, and increased PDCD5 protein expression. Furthermore, 3-Cl-AHPC increased orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP) mRNA expression, increased SHP protein bound to NF-κB p65, and found the SHP/NF-κB p65 complex attached to the PDCD5 gene. PDCD5 triggered apoptosis through increased Bax protein and release of cytochrome C from mitochondria to cytosol. Lastly, knockdown of PDCD5 protein expression blocked 3-Cl-AHPC mediated apoptosis, while over-expression of PDCD5 enhanced apoptosis, suggesting PDCD5 is necessary and sufficient for NF-κB p65 mediated apoptosis. Our results demonstrate a novel pathway for NF-κB p65 in regulating apoptosis through SHP and PDCD5. 
As a cellular bile acid sensor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR) participates in regulation of bile acid, lipid and glucose homeostasis, and liver protection. Clinical results have validated FXR as therapeutic target in hepatic and metabolic diseases. To date, potent FXR agonists share a negatively ionizable function that might compromise their pharmacokinetic distribution and behavior. Here we report the development and characterization of a high-affinity FXR modulator not comprising an acidic residue.
Nuclear receptors farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and small heterodimer partner (SHP) are important regulators of bile acid, lipid, and glucose homeostasis. Here, we show that global Fxr -/- Shp-/- double knockout (DKO) mice are refractory to weight gain, glucose intolerance, and hepatic steatosis when challenged with high-fat diet. DKO mice display an inherently increased capacity to burn fat and suppress de novo hepatic lipid synthesis. Moreover, DKO mice were also very active and that correlated well with the observed increase in phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase expression, type IA fibers, and mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that liver-specific Shp deletion protects against fatty liver development by suppressing expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 2 and lipid-droplet protein fat-specific protein 27 beta.
These data suggest that Fxr and Shp inactivation may be beneficial to combat diet-induced obesity and uncover that hepatic SHP is necessary to promote fatty liver disease. (Hepatology 2017;66:1854-1865).
For mice, a maternal vitamin A (VA)-deficient diet initiated from midgestation (GVAD) produces serum retinol deficiency in mature offspring. We hypothesize that the effects of GVAD arise from preweaning developmental changes. We compare the effect of this GVAD protocol in combination with a postweaning high-fat diet (HFD) or high-carbohydrate diet (LF12). Each is compared to an equivalent VA-sufficient combination. GVAD extensively decreased serum retinol and liver retinol, retinyl esters, and retinoid homeostasis genes (Lrat, Cyp26b1 and Cyp26a1). These suppressions were each more effective with LF12 than with HFD. Postweaning initiation of VA deficiency with LF12 depleted liver retinoids, but serum retinol was unaffected. Liver retinoid depletion, therefore, precedes serum attenuation. Maternal LF12 decreased the obesity response to the HFD, which was further decreased by GVAD. LF12 fed to the mother and offspring extensively stimulated genes marking stellate activation (Col1a1, Timp2 and Cyp1b1) and novel inflammation markers (Ly6d, Trem2 and Nupr1). The GVAD with LF12 diet combination suppressed these responses. GVAD in combination with the HFD increased these same clusters. A further set of expression differences on the HFD when compared to a high-carbohydrate diet was prevented when GVAD was combined with HFD. Most of these GVAD gene changes match published effects from deletion of Nr0b2/Shp, a retinoid-responsive, nuclear co-repressor that modulates metabolic homeostasis. The stellate and inflammatory increases seen with the high-carbohydrate LF12 diet may represent postprandial responses. They depend on retinol and Shp, but the regulation reverses with an HFD.
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 is a major drug-metabolizing enzyme, responsible for eliminating 25% of marketed drugs. We recently identified SHP as a negative regulator of CYP2D6 expression and showed that factors that alter SHP expression influence CYP2D6 expression. Fenofibrate, an agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α(PPARα), has been previously reported to upregulate SHP expression in the mouse liver. The objective of this study was to determine whether fenofibrate decreases CYP2D6 expression via upregulating SHP expression.
CYP2D6-humanized transgenic mice were administered with fenofibrate (100 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally for 5 days) or vehicle control. Hepatic mRNA and protein expression levels of CYP2D6 and SHP were measured.
Results showed that while mRNA levels of SHP did not differ between the groups, protein levels of SHP increased by 2-fold in fenofibrate-treated mice. Despite the increased SHP protein levels, CYP2D6 expression did not decrease at the mRNA or protein levels. Similar results were observed in human hepatocytes treated with fenofibrate. Results from transient transfection and promoter reporter assays indicate that PPARα can transactivate CYP2D6 promoter, suggesting that the lack of CYP2D6 downregulation by fenofibrate may be in part due to the activation of CYP2D6 promoter by PPARα.
These results indicate that fenofibrate has minimal effects on CYP2D6 expression despite increased SHP expression.
The synthetic glucocorticoids (GCs) dexamethasone, mometasone furoate, and triamcinolone acetonide are pharmaceutical mainstays to treat chronic inflammatory diseases. These drugs bind to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a ligand-activated transcription factor and member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. The GR is widely recognized as a therapeutic target for its ability to counter proinflammatory signaling. Despite the popularity of GCs in the clinic, long-term use leads to numerous side effects, driving the need for new and improved drugs with less off-target pharmacology. X-ray crystal structures have played an important role in the drug-design process, permitting the characterization of robust structure-function relationships. However, steroid receptor ligand-binding domains (LBDs) are inherently unstable, and their crystallization requires extensive mutagenesis to enhance expression and crystallization. Here, we use an ancestral variant of GR as a tool to generate a high-resolution crystal structure of GR in complex with the potent glucocorticoid triamcinolone acetonide (TA) and a fragment of the small heterodimer partner (SHP). Using structural analysis, molecular dynamics, and biochemistry, we show that TA increases intramolecular contacts within the LBD to drive affinity and enhance stability of the receptor-ligand complex. These data support the emerging theme that ligand-induced receptor conformational dynamics at the mouth of the pocket play a major role in steroid receptor activation. This work also represents the first GR structure in complex with SHP, which has been suggested to play a role in modulating hepatic GR function.
The chipmunk hibernation-related protein 25 (HP-25) is involved in the circannual control of hibernation in the brain. The liver-specific expression of the HP-25 gene is repressed in hibernating chipmunks under the control of endogenous circannual rhythms. However, the molecular mechanisms that differentially regulate the HP-25 gene during the nonhibernation and hibernation seasons are unknown. Here, we show that the hibernation-associated HP-25 expression is regulated epigenetically. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that significantly less hepatocyte nuclear receptor HNF-4 bound to the HP-25 gene promoter in the liver of hibernating chipmunks compared to nonhibernating chipmunks. Concurrently in the hibernating chipmunks, coactivators were dissociated from the promoter, and active transcription histone marks on the HP-25 gene promoter were lost. On the other hand, small heterodimer partner (SHP) expression was upregulated in the liver of hibernating chipmunks. Overexpressing SHP in primary hepatocytes prepared from nonhibernating chipmunks caused HNF-4 to dissociate from the HP-25 gene promoter, and reduced the HP-25 mRNA level. These results suggest that hibernation-related HP-25 expression is epigenetically regulated by the binding of HNF-4 to the HP-25 promoter, and that this binding might be modulated by SHP in hibernating chipmunks.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common solid tumor in the world and the third leading cause of cancer-associated deaths. A Sleeping Beauty-mediated transposon mutagenesis screen previously identified mutations that cooperate with MYC to accelerate liver tumorigenesis. This revealed a tumor suppressor role for Steroid Receptor Coactivator 2/Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 2 (Src-2/Ncoa2) in liver cancer. In contrast, SRC-2 promotes survival and metastasis in prostate cancer cells, suggesting a tissue-specific and context-dependent role for SRC-2 in tumorigenesis. To determine if genetic loss of SRC-2 is sufficient to accelerate MYC-mediated liver tumorigenesis, we bred Src-2-/- mice with a MYC-induced liver tumor model and observed a significant increase in liver tumor burden. RNA sequencing of liver tumors and in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed a set of direct target genes that are bound by SRC-2 and exhibit downregulated expression in Src-2-/- liver tumors. We demonstrate that activation of SHP (Small Heterodimer Partner), DKK4 (Dickkopf-4), and CADM4 (Cell Adhesion Molecule 4) by SRC-2 suppresses tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. These studies suggest that SRC-2 may exhibit oncogenic or tumor suppressor activity depending on the target genes and nuclear receptors that are expressed in distinct tissues and illuminate the mechanisms of tumor suppression by SRC-2 in liver.
Small heterodimer partner (SHP) is an atypical nuclear receptor expressed in heart that has been shown to inhibit the hypertrophic response. Here, we assessed the role of SHP in cardiac metabolism and inflammation. Mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) displayed glucose intolerance accompanied by increased cardiac mRNA levels of Shp. In HL-1 cardiomyocytes, SHP overexpression inhibited both basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and impaired the insulin signalling pathway (evidenced by reduced AKT and AS160 phosphorylation), similar to insulin resistant cells generated by high palmitate/high insulin treatment (HP/HI; 500μM/100nM). In addition, SHP overexpression increased Socs3 mRNA and reduced IRS-1 protein levels. SHP overexpression also induced Cd36 expression (~6.2 fold; p&lt;0.001) linking to the observed intramyocellular lipid accumulation. SHP overexpressing cells further showed altered expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism, i.e., Acaca, Acadvl or Ucp3, augmented NF-κB DNA-binding activity and induced transcripts of inflammatory genes, i.e., Il6 and Tnf mRNA (~4-fold induction, p&lt;0.01). Alterations in metabolism and inflammation found in SHP overexpressing cells were associated with changes in the mRNA levels of Ppara (79% reduction, p&lt;0.001) and Pparg (~58-fold induction, p&lt;0.001). Finally, co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that SHP overexpression strongly reduced the physical interaction between PPARα and the p65 subunit of NF-κB, suggesting that dissociation of these two proteins is one of the mechanisms by which SHP initiates the inflammatory response in cardiac cells. Overall, our results suggest that SHP upregulation upon high-fat feeding leads to lipid accumulation, insulin resistance and inflammation in cardiomyocytes.
The orphan nuclear receptor, small heterodimer partner (SHP), plays a negative regulatory role in innate immune responses and is involved in various inflammatory signaling pathways. In the present study, we aimed to ascertain whether SHP is effective in preventing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced kidney tubular inflammation and explored the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective effects of SHP. Renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury was induced in mice by clamping both renal pedicles for 30 min. The effects of H2O2 on cell viability in human renal proximal tubule (HK-2) cells were determined using MTT assays. 2',7'-DCF-DA was used to determine intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). SHP, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) levels, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression levels were determined by semi-quantitative immunoblotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction. In addition, SHP, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and activator protein-1 (AP-1) promoter activities were determined by luciferase assays. SHP mRNA and protein expression levels were reduced, whereas COX-2 and iNOS levels were increased in mice subjected to renal I/R. H2O2 treatment in HK-2 cells decreased cell viability, increased ROS production, and induced COX-2 and iNOS expression. These changes were counteracted by transient transfection with SHP. H2O2 treatment decreased SHP luciferase activity, which was recovered by treatment with the NF-κB inhibitor Bay11-7082, transfection with dominant-negative c-Jun or treatment with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). AP-1 and NF-κB promoter activities were increased by H2O2 and this increase was blocked by SHP transfection. To conclude, SHP protected HK-2 cells from H2O2-induced tubular injury by inhibition of COX-2 and iNOS through suppression of AP-1 and NF-κB promoter activities.
Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is a major drug-metabolizing enzyme, but the factors governing transcriptional regulation of its expression remain poorly understood. Based on previous reports of small heterodimer partner (SHP) playing an important role as a transcriptional repressor of CYP2D6 expression, here we investigated how a known upstream regulator of SHP expression, namely cholestasis triggered by cholic acid (CA) feeding in mice, can lead to altered CYP2D6 expression. To this end, CYP2D6-humanized (Tg-CYP2D6) mice were fed with a CA-supplemented or control diet for 14 days, and hepatic expression of multiple genes was examined. Unexpectedly, CA feeding led to insignificant changes in SHP mRNA but also to significant (2.8-fold) decreases in SHP protein levels. In silico analysis of the SHP gene regulatory region revealed a putative binding site for a microRNA, miR-142-3p. Results from luciferase reporter assays suggest that miR-142-3p targets the SHP gene. Hepatic expression of miR-142-3p was significantly increased in CA-fed mice (∼5-fold), suggesting a potential role of miR-142-3p in the regulation of SHP expression in cholestasis. The decreased SHP protein levels were accompanied by increased expression and activity of CYP2D6 in the liver of CA-fed mice. These results suggest potential roles of differential hepatic levels of bile acids in the transcriptional regulation of CYP2D6 expression.
Multifunctional RNA helicase DDX3 participates in HCV infection, one of the major causes of hepatic steatosis. Here, we investigated the role of DDX3 in hepatic lipid metabolism. We found that HCV infection severely reduced DDX3 expression. Analysis of intracellular triglyceride and secreted ApoB indicated that lipid accumulations were increased while ApoB secretion were decreased in DDX3 knockdown HuH7 and HepG2 cell lines. Down-regulation of DDX3 significantly decreased protein and transcript expression of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), a key regulator of liver lipid homeostasis. Moreover, DDX3 interacted with hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) and small heterodimer partner (SHP), and synergistically up-regulated HNF4-mediated transactivation of MTP promoter via its ATPase activity. Further investigation revealed that DDX3 interacted with CBP/p300 and increased the promoter binding affinity of HNF4 by enhancing HNF4 acetylation. Additionally, DDX3 partially relieved the SHP-mediated suppression on MTP promoter by competing with SHP for HNF4 binding which disrupted the inactive HNF4/SHP heterodimer while promoted the formation of the active HNF4 homodimer. Collectively, these results imply that DDX3 regulates MTP gene expression and lipid homeostasis through interplay with HNF4 and SHP, which may also reveal a novel mechanism of HCV-induced steatosis.
The small heterodimer partner (SHP) is an orphan nuclear receptor that lacks the DNA binding domain while conserves a putative ligand-binding site, thought that endogenous ligands for this receptor are unknown. Previous studies have determined that SHP activation protects against development of liver fibrosis a process driven by trans-differentiation and activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), a miofibroblast like cell type, involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. To dissect signals involved in this activity we generated SHP-overexpressing human and rat HSCs. Forced expression of SHP in HSC-T6 altered the expression of 574 genes. By pathway and functional enrichment analyses we detected a cluster of 46 differentially expressed genes involved in HSCs trans-differentiation. Using a isoxazole scaffold we designed and synthesized a series of SHP agonists. The most potent member of this group, ISO-COOH (EC50: 9 μM), attenuated HSCs trans-differentiation and ECM deposition in vitro, while in mice rendered cirrhotic by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) or α-naphthyl-isothiocyanate (ANIT), protected against development of liver fibrosis as measured by morphometric analysis and expression of α-SMA and α1-collagen mRNAs. In aggregate, present results identify SHP as a counter-regulatory signal for HSCs transactivation and describe a novel class of SHP agonists endowed with anti-fibrotic activity.
Cholestyramine (CHO), as a bile acid sequestering exchange resin, has been widely used to treat hypercholesterolemia. The aim of this study was to explore how CHO regulated serum cholesterol amounts and bile acid levels in animal models.
New Zealand White rabbits were randomly assigned to the control (given distilled water) and CHO-treated (given CHO solution 1 g/kg per day for 2 weeks) groups. To assess bile acid pool size, bile fistulas were constructed in five rabbits in each group. Serum cholesterol levels and biliary and fecal bile outputs were determined. Liver cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase ( CYP7A1 ), small heterodimer partner ( SHP ), bile salt export pump ( BSEP ), ileal bile acid-binding protein ( IBABP ) and LDL receptor ( LDL-R ) mRNA expressions were assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. CYP7A1 activity was also determined.
CHO treatment decreased serum cholesterol levels by 12.1%. Although CHO did not change the bile acid pool size and biliary bile acid output, it significantly increased fecal bile acid output. Interestingly, CHO also significantly increased the expression and activity of CYP7A1, as well as IBABP and LDL-R mRNA expressions, but decreased hepatic SHP and BSEP gene expressions.
CHO markedly alters bile acid and cholesterol amounts in rabbit intestinal and liver tissues, downregulating genes responsible for cholesterol homeostasis.
To investigate the protective effect of glutamine (Gln) against obstructive cholestasis in association with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) activation, an obstructive cholestasis model was established in male Sprague-Dawley rats by bile duct ligation (BDL). Serum biomarkers and hematoxylin plus eosin staining were used to identify the degree of hepatic injury in the rats with obstructive cholestasis after Gln treatment. Immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR, Western blot, cultured primary rat hepatocytes with FXR knockdown, and dual-luciferase reporter assay were performed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying Gln hepatoprotection. We found that Gln treatment protected against obstructive cholestasis induced by BDL through reducing hepatocyte injury. Upregulation of the hepatic efflux transporters small heterodimer partner (Shp), bile salt export pump (Bsep), and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp2), and inhibition of the hepatic uptake transporter Na+/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (Ntcp) and the bile acid synthesis enzyme cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1) expression were observed in rats with BDL treated with Gln in vivo. Furthermore, the regulatory effect of Gln on Bsep and Mrp2 expression was abrogated after FXR knockdown in rat primary cultured hepatocytes. Luciferase assay HepG2 cells also illustrated FXR was a direct target for Gln treatment. In conclusion, the regulation of Bsep and Mrp2 expression mediated by FXR might be an important mechanism for Gln against obstructive cholestasis.
Geniposide (GE) is one of the major iridoid glycosides isolated from the fruit of Gardenia jasminoides Ellis that has been used to treat hepatic disorders including cholestasis. However, the underlying mechanisms for GE ameliorating the reduction in bile acids accumulation by α-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT) remain unclear.
The purpose of this study is to characterize the efficacy of GE in regulation of bile acids uptake, synthesis, metabolism, and transport in ANIT-induced rats.
Sprague-Dawley rats were orally administrated with vehicle, GE (25, 50, and 100mg/kg), and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) (60mg/kg) once daily for seven days. On the fifth day, a single dose of ANIT (75mg/kg) was administrated via oral gavage. Blood biochemical determination, bile flow rate and liver histopathology were measured to evaluate the protective effect of GE. The mRNA expressions and protein levels of transporters and enzymes involved in bile acids homeostasis were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blot to study the underlying mechanism of GE against ANIT-induced rats.
GE (25, 50, and 100mg/kg, po) dose-dependently prevented ANIT-induced changes in serum markers for liver injury. GE treatment reduced basolateral bile acids uptake via repression of OATP2 (P&lt;0.05). Bile acids biosynthesis was decreased through down-regulation of CYP7A1, CYP8B1, and CYP27A1 (P&lt;0.05). GE significantly increased canalicular bile acids secretion via BSEP (P&lt;0.05), subsequently stimulating bile flow during cholestasis. GE also markedly enhanced mRNA level of basolateral transporter OSTβ (P&lt;0.01). Bile acids transported to the plasma were cleared into the urine, resulting in down-regulation of plasma bile acids. However, GE did not alter the mRNA levels of CYP3A2, UGT1A1 and SULT2A1. Furthermore, the gene and protein expression analysis demonstrated activation of FXR, PXR, and SHP after GE administration.
GE attenuates ANIT-induced hepatotoxicity and cholestasis in rats, due to regulation enzymes and transporters responsible for bile acids homeostasis.
Chronic ethanol (EtOH) consumption causes alcoholic liver disease (ALD), and disruption of the circadian system facilitates the development of ALD. Small heterodimer partner (SHP) is a nuclear receptor and critical regulator of hepatic lipid metabolism. This study aimed at depicting circadian metabolomes altered by chronic EtOH-plus-binge and Shp deficiency using high-throughput metabolomics.
Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 and Shp-/- mice were fed the control diet (CD) or Lieber-DeCarli EtOH liquid diet (ED) for 10 days followed by a single bout of maltose (CD + M) or EtOH (ED + E) binge on the 11th day. Serum and liver were collected over a 24-hour light/dark (LD) cycle at Zeitgeber time ZT12, ZT18, ZT0, and ZT6, and metabolomics was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
A total of 110 metabolites were identified in liver and of those 80 were also present in serum from pathways of carbohydrates, lipids, pentose phosphate, amino acids, nucleotides, and tricarboxylic acid cycle. In the liver, 91% of metabolites displayed rhythmicity with ED + E, whereas in the serum, only 87% were rhythmic. Bioinformatics analysis identified unique metabolome patterns altered in WT CD + M, WT ED + E, Shp-/- CD + M, and Shp-/- ED + E groups. Specifically, metabolites from the nucleotide and amino acid pathway (ribose, glucose-6-phosphate, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and sedoheptulose-7-P) were elevated in Shp-/- CD + M mice during the dark cycle, whereas metabolites including N-methylalanine, 2-hydroxybutyric acid, and 2-hydroxyglutarate were elevated in WT ED + E mice during the light cycle. The rhythmicity and abundance of other individual metabolites were also significantly altered by both control and EtOH diets.
Metabolomics provides a useful means to identify unique metabolites altered by chronic EtOH-plus-binge.
The small heterodimer partner (SHP) nuclear receptor is an important regulator of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. However, little is known about the role of SHP in alcoholic fatty liver. In this study, we used a modified chronic ethanol-binge model to examine cyclic alterations of lipid metabolism in wild-type (WT) and Shp-/- mice over a 24-hour period after binge. The serum and hepatic lipid profiles, as well as the expression of lipid synthesis genes and markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress, exhibited distinct variations in WT and Shp-/- mice in response to ethanol diet plus ethanol binge (ED+E) and control diet plus maltose binge. ED+E induced steatosis in WT mice, which correlated with a marked up-regulation of activating transcription factor 4 protein (ATF4) but down-regulation of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1c protein (SREBP-1c). On the contrary, the control diet plus maltose binge caused lipid accumulation in Shp-/- mice, which was accompanied by a sharp elevation of CHOP, SREBP-1c, and REV-ERBα proteins but a diminished ATF4. REV-ERBα activated CHOP promoter activity and gene transcription, which were inhibited by SHP. Knockdown Rev-Erbα in Shp-/- mice prevented steatosis induced by ED+E. Our study revealed a critical role of SHP and REV-ERBα in controlling rhythmic CHOP expression in alcoholic fatty liver.
Circadian rhythms controlled by clock genes affect plasma lipids. Here we show that global ablation of Bmal1 in Apoe-/- and Ldlr-/- mice and its liver-specific ablation in Apoe-/- (L-Bmal1-/-Apoe-/-) mice increases, whereas overexpression of BMAL1 in L-Bmal1-/-Apoe-/- and Apoe-/-mice decreases hyperlipidaemia and atherosclerosis. Bmal1 deficiency augments hepatic lipoprotein secretion and diminishes cholesterol excretion to the bile. Further, Bmal1 deficiency reduces expression of Shp and Gata4. Reductions in Shp increase Mtp expression and lipoprotein production, whereas reductions in Gata4 diminish Abcg5/Abcg8 expression and biliary cholesterol excretion. Forced SHP expression normalizes lipoprotein secretion with no effect on biliary cholesterol excretion, while forced GATA4 expression increases cholesterol excretion to the bile and reduces plasma lipids in L-Bmal1-/-Apoe-/- and Apoe-/- mice. Thus, our data indicate that Bmal1 modulates lipoprotein production and biliary cholesterol excretion by regulating the expression of Mtp and Abcg5/Abcg8 via Shp and Gata4.
The aim of this study is to investigate Emodin on alleviating intrahepatic cholestasis by regulation of liver farnesoid X receptor (FXR) pathway. Cell and animal models of intrahepatic cholestatis were established. Biochemical tests and histomorphology were performed. The messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression of FXR, small heterodimer partner (SHP), uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 2 family polypeptide B4 (UGT2B4), and bile salt export pump (BSEP) was detected. As a result, compared with the model group, the serum levels of biochemical test were significantly lower in the Emodin group (P &lt;0.01). The histopathological changes were remitted significantly by Emodin treatment. In the model group, the mRNA and protein expression of FXR, SHP, UGT2B4, and BSEP was significantly lower than in the normal group in cell models (P &lt;0.05). With Emodin intervention, the expression of FXR, SHP, UGT2B4, and BSEP was notably increased (P &lt;0.05). In conclusion, Emodin plays a protective role in intrahepatic cholestasis by promoting FXR signal pathways.
CYP2D6-mediated drug metabolism exhibits large interindividual variability. Although genetic variations in the CYP2D6 gene are well known contributors to the variability, the sources of CYP2D6 variability in individuals of the same genotype remain unexplained. Accumulating data indicate that transcriptional regulation of CYP2D6 may account for part of CYP2D6 variability. Yet, our understanding of factors governing transcriptional regulation of CYP2D6 is limited. Recently, mechanistic studies of increased CYP2D6-mediated drug metabolism in pregnancy revealed two transcription factors, small heterodimer partner (SHP) and Krüppel-like factor 9, as a transcriptional repressor and an activator, respectively, of CYP2D6. Chemicals that increase SHP expression (e.g., retinoids and activators of farnesoid X receptor) were shown to downregulate CYP2D6 expression in the humanized mice as well as in human hepatocytes. This review summarizes the series of studies on the transcriptional regulation of CYP2D6 expression, potentially providing a basis to better understand the large interindividual variability in CYP2D6-mediated drug metabolism.
HCV life cycle is strictly correlated with the hepatocyte lipid metabolism; moreover, the progression of HCV chronic hepatitis is accelerated by the presence of liver steatosis. Among the steatogenic genes deregulated during the HCV infection one of the most attractive is the Small Heterodimer Protein 1 (SHP1; NR0B2), that is involved in a remarkable number of metabolic functions. HCV NS5A is an essential and integral component of the HCV membranous-web replicon complex (RC) and plays an essential role to transfer the viral genome from the RCs to the surface of the lipid droplets (LDs) that, in turn, play a key function during HCV life cycle.With the help of a HCV infection model, we demonstrate a functional interaction between SHP1 and HCV NS5A protein. SHP1 silencing (siSHP1) reversed the pro-oncogenic effects of HCV infection, inducing a significant decrease in liver lipid accumulation and in NS5A protein expression. Moreover, siSHP1 causes a strong modulation of some genes involved in HCV-related EMT, such as: HNF4, a central regulators of hepatocyte differentiation, E-Cadherin, SNAILs.Our data suggest that SHP1 results not only to be strictly connected to the pathogenesis of HCV-related liver steatosis, but also to its progression towards the liver transformation.
Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) has been confirmed to sense bile acids in various tissues. However, its expression in brain neurons remains obscure. In this study, we identified FXR mRNA and protein expression in mouse brain neurons and in mouse/human brain tissues. FXR was predominantly localized in the nucleus in cultured neurons, but in neurons in vivo, it mainly appeared in the cytoplasm. In nuclear compartments, the neuronal FXR exhibited a punctate distribution. Activation of FXR increased the small heterodimer partner (SHP) mRNA and protein expression levels in cultured neurons and in brain tissues. These findings will help explore new functions of FXR in the brain.
Small heterodimer partner (SHP, NR0B2) is a nuclear orphan receptor without endogenous ligands. Due to its crucial inhibitory role in liver cancer, it is of importance to identify small molecule agonists of SHP. As such, we initiated a probe discovery effort to identify compounds capable of modulating SHP function. First, we performed binding assays using small molecule microarrays (SMM) and discovered 5-(diethylsulfamoyl)-3-hydroxynaphthalene-2-carboxylic acid (DSHN) as a novel activator of SHP. DSHN transcriptionally activated Shp mRNA, but also stabilized the SHP protein by preventing its ubiquitination and degradation. Second, we identified Ccl2 as a new SHP target gene by RNA-seq. We showed that activation of SHP by DSHN repressed Ccl2 expression and secretion by inhibiting p65 activation of CCL2 promoter activity, as demonstrated in vivo in Shp-/- mice and in vitro in HCC cells with SHP overexpression and knockdown. Third, we elucidated a strong inhibitory effect of SHP and DSHN on HCC cell migration and invasion by antagonizing the effect of CCL2. Lastly, by interrogating a publicly available database to retrieve SHP expression profiles from multiple types of human cancers, we established a negative association of SHP expression with human cancer metastasis and patient survival. In summary, the discovery of a novel small molecule activator of SHP provides a therapeutic perspective for future translational and preclinical studies to inhibit HCC metastasis by blocking Ccl2 signaling.

Liver X receptors (LXRs) suppress the expression of inflammatory genes in a context-specific manner. In astrocytes, SUMOylation of LXRs promotes their anti-inflammatory effects. We found that small heterodimer partner (SHP), also known as NR0B2 (nuclear receptor subfamily 0, group B, member 2), facilitates the anti-inflammatory actions of LXRs by promoting their SUMOylation. Knockdown of SHP abrogated SUMOylation of LXRs, preventing their anti-inflammatory effects, in primary rat astrocytes but not macrophages. The underlying mechanisms differed according to LXR isoform. SHP promoted SUMO2 and SUMO3 attachment to LXRα by interacting directly with the histone deacetylase and E3 SUMO ligase HDAC4. In contrast, SHP promoted SUMO1 attachment to LXRβ by stabilizing the E3 SUMO ligase PIAS1. SHP bound PIAS1 and disrupted its interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase SIAH1. Knocking down SIAH1 rescued LXRβ SUMOylation in SHP-deficient astrocytes. Our data collectively suggested that SHP mediates the anti-inflammatory actions of LXRs through differential regulation of receptor SUMOylation specifically in astrocytes, thereby revealing potential avenues for therapeutic development in diseases associated with brain inflammation.
The precipitation of excess biliary cholesterol as solid crystals is a prerequisite for cholesterol gallstone formation, which occurs due to disturbed biliary homeostasis. Biliary homeostasis is regulated by an elaborate network of genes in hepatocytes. If unmanaged, the cholesterol crystals will aggregate, fuse and form gallstones. We have previously observed that the levels of osteopontin (OPN) in bile and gallbladder were reduced in gallstone patients. However, the role and mechanism for hepatic OPN in cholesterol gallstone formation is undetermined. In this study, we found that the expression of hepatic OPN was increased in gallstone patients compared with gallstone-free counterparts. Then, we observed that OPN-deficient mice were less vulnerable to cholesterol gallstone formation than wild type mice. Further mechanistic studies revealed that this protective effect was associated with alterations of bile composition and was caused by the increased hepatic CYP7A1 expression and the reduced expression of hepatic SHP, ATP8B1, SR-B1 and SREBP-2. Finally, the correlations between the expression of hepatic OPN and the expression of these hepatic genes were validated in gallstone patients. Taken together, our findings reveal that hepatic OPN contributes to cholesterol gallstone formation by regulating biliary metabolism and might be developed as a therapeutic target for gallstone treatments.
Recently, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) plasma levels have been proved to be associated with atherosclerosis development. Among the targets aimed to ameliorating atherosclerotic lesions, inducing bile acid synthesis to eliminate excess cholesterol in body is an effective way. Individual bile acid as endogenous ligands for the nuclear receptor has differential effects on regulating bile acid metabolism. It is unclear whether bile acid profiles are mechanistically linked to TMAO-induced development of atherosclerosis.
Male apoE-/- mice were fed with control diet containing 0.3% TMAO for 8 weeks. Aortic lesion development and serum lipid profiles were determined. Bile acid profiles in bile, liver and serum were measured by liquid chromatographic separation and mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS). Real-time PCRs were performed to analyze mRNA expression of genes related to hepatic bile acid metabolism.
The total plaque areas in the aortas strongly increased 2-fold (P &lt; 0.001) in TMAO administration mice. The levels of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) in TMAO group were also significantly increased by 25.5% (P = 0.044), 31.2% (P = 0.006), 28.3% (P = 0.032), respectively. TMAO notably changed bile acid profiles, especially in serum, the most prominent inductions were tauromuricholic acid (TMCA), deoxycholic acid (DCA) and cholic acid (CA). Mechanically, TMAO inhibited hepatic bile acid synthesis by specifically repressing the classical bile acid synthesis pathway, which might be mediated by activation of small heterodimer partner (SHP) and farnesoid X receptor (FXR).
These findings suggested that TMAO accelerated aortic lesion formation in apoE-/- mice by altering bile acid profiles, further activating nuclear receptor FXR and SHP to inhibit bile acid synthesis by reducing Cyp7a1 expression.
The nuclear receptor subfamily 0 group B member 2 (NR0B2, also called SHP) is expressed at high levels in the liver and intestine. Postprandial fibroblast growth factor 19 (human FGF19, mouse FGF15) signaling increases the transcriptional activity of SHP. We studied the functions of SHP and FGF19 in the intestines of mice, including their regulation of expression of the cholesterol transporter NPC1L1 )NPC1-like intracellular cholesterol transporter 1) and cholesterol absorption.
We performed histologic and biochemical analyses of intestinal tissues from C57BL/6 and SHP-knockout mice and performed RNA-sequencing analyses to identify genes regulated by SHP. The effects of fasting and refeeding on intestinal expression of NPC1L1 were examined in C57BL/6, SHP-knockout, and FGF15-knockout mice. Mice were given FGF19 daily for 1 week; fractional cholesterol absorption, cholesterol and bile acid (BA) levels, and composition of BAs were measured. Intestinal organoids were generated from C57BL/6 and SHP-knockout mice, and cholesterol uptake was measured. Luciferase reporter assays were performed with HT29 cells.
We found that the genes that regulate lipid and ion transport in intestine, including NPC1L1, were up-regulated and that cholesterol absorption was increased in SHP-knockout mice compared with C57BL/6 mice. Expression of NPC1L1 was reduced in C57BL/6 mice after refeeding after fasting but not in SHP-knockout or FGF15-knockout mice. SHP-knockout mice had altered BA composition compared with C57BL/6 mice. FGF19 injection reduced expression of NPC1L1, decreased cholesterol absorption, and increased levels of hydrophilic BAs, including tauro-α- and -β-muricholic acids; these changes were not observed in SHP-knockout mice. SREBF2 (sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 2), which regulates cholesterol, activated transcription of NPC1L1. FGF19 signaling led to phosphorylation of SHP, which inhibited SREBF2 activity.
Postprandial FGF19 and SHP inhibit SREBF2, which leads to repression of intestinal NPC1L1 expression and cholesterol absorption. Strategies to increase FGF19 signaling to activate SHP might be developed for treatment of hypercholesterolemia.
Non-Camellia tea and herbal medicine help prevent the development of diabetes and other metabolic diseases. Previous studies revealed that Coreopsis tinctoria (CT) flower tea increases insulin sensitivity and, in some high-fat diet (HFD)-fed rats, even prevents hepatic metabolic disorders. However, the molecular mechanisms by which CT improves insulin resistance are not known. In this study, six-week-old rats were fed a normal diet (ND), an HFD or an HFD supplemented with CT for 8 weeks. Serum samples were collected, and the livers were extracted for RNA-seq gene expression analysis. Real-time PCR and western blotting further verified the RNA-seq results. In our results, dietary CT ameliorated HFD-induced hepatosteatosis, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance. In the HFD group, 1667 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified compared with the ND group. In the CT group, 327 DEGs were identified compared with the HFD group. Some of these DEGs were related to insulin signalling, hepatic lipogenesis and glucose homeostasis. This study suggested that insulin resistance with hyperinsulinaemia, and not insulin insufficiency, is an early problem in HFD-fed rats, and CT downregulates insulin secretion genes (e.g., Rasd1, Stxbp1 and Sfxn1). Hepatic gene and protein expression analyses indicated that the regulatory effects of CT on glucose and lipid homeostasis are likely mediated via the Akt/FoxO1 signalling pathway and are regulated by the transcription factors hairy and enhancer of split 1 (HES1) and small heterodimer partner (SHP). Our study provides transcriptomic evidence of the complex pathogenic mechanism involved in hepatic insulin resistance and proves that supplementation with CT improves insulin resistance at a global scale.
Bile acids (BA) are signaling molecules that activate nuclear factors and g-protein coupled receptors signaling to maintain metabolic homeostasis. However, accumulation of toxic BA promotes liver injury by initiating inflammation, inducing apoptosis and causing oxidative stress leading to cirrhosis and liver failure. Augmenter of Liver Regeneration (ALR) is a hepatotrophic growth factor with anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidative properties that has been shown to improve mitochondrial and hepatic functions in rats after bile duct ligation. In the current study we aimed to analyze the regulation of the pro-survival protein, ALR, under conditions of cytotoxic concentrations of BA. Promoter studies of ALR (-733/+527 bp) revealed potential binding sites for various transcription factors like Egr-1, HNF4α and two bile acid response elements (BARE). Using a full-length and several truncated promoter constructs for ALR we analyzed promoter activity and showed that BA reduce ALR promoter activity whereas Egr-1 transfection induces it. EMSA and supershift analysis confirmed the specific binding of Egr-1 to its response element within ALR promoter and this binding was reduced upon simultaneous stimulation with BA. We also showed that ALR promoter activity and protein expression are induced by HNF4α1 and repressed by SHP. In conclusion, these results indicate that BA negatively regulate ALR expression by SHP activation.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a series of pathologic changes ranging from steatosis to steatohepatitis, which may progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The purpose of this study was to determine whether ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide peptide (GLPP) has therapeutic effect on NAFLD.
Ob/ ob mouse model and ApoC3 transgenic mouse model were used for exploring the effect of GLPP on NAFLD. Key metabolic pathways and enzymes were identified by metabolomics combining with KEGG and PIUmet analyses and key enzymes were detected by Western blot. Hepatosteatosis models of HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes were used to further confirm the therapeutic effect of GLPP on NAFLD.
GLPP administrated for a month alleviated hepatosteatosis, dyslipidemia, liver dysfunction and liver insulin resistance. Pathways of glycerophospholipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism and primary bile acid biosynthesis were involved in the therapeutic effect of GLPP on NAFLD. Detection of key enzymes revealed that GLPP reversed low expression of CYP7A1, CYP8B1, FXR, SHP and high expression of FGFR4 in ob/ob mice and ApoC3 mice. Besides, GLPP inhibited fatty acid synthesis by reducing the expression of SREBP1c, FAS and ACC via a FXR-SHP dependent mechanism. Additionally, GLPP reduced the accumulation of lipid droplets and the content of TG in HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes induced by oleic acid and palmitic acid.
GLPP significantly improves NAFLD via regulating bile acid synthesis dependent on FXR-SHP/FGF pathway, which finally inhibits fatty acid synthesis, indicating that GLPP might be developed as a therapeutic drug for NAFLD.
Estrogen-induced intrahepatic cholestasis is one of the most common pathogenic factors for liver diseases in clinic. It is, however, regrettable that effective medical therapies to ameliorate or reverse this cholestasis are limited. Fortunately, the novel insights now allow us to target crucial transporters, enzymes and their regulatory pathways therapeutically by restoring disrupted bile acids (BAs) transport and signaling thus ameliorating cholestasis. Additionally, it has been found that a compensatory effect could have been developed under the condition of estrogen-induced in cholestasis. Hence, exploring the molecular mechanism of the adaptive changes counteracting the cholestasis would be one of the approaches for development of new therapeutic targets.
Parameters of BAs in different specimens, mRNA expressions of transporters, enzymes and farnesoid X receptor (Fxr) signaling pathways that relate to BAs homeostasis in liver and ileum were measured in rats with 7-day and 14-day 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE)-induced cholestasis, and the molecular docking and HepaRG cells studies for verification were also evaluated.
It has been found that the depression of "ileal Fxr-Fgf15 (fibroblast growth factor 15)-hepatic Cyp7a1 pathway" in coordinated with activation of "hepatic Fxr-Shp (small heterodimer partner)-Cyp8b1 pathway" as well as up-regulation of Cyp27a1 expression synergistically promoting the hepatic biosynthesis of chenodeoxycholic acids (CDCAs) that are the potent agonists of Fxr, contribute to the Bsep up-regulation mediated the bile flow restoration to alleviate the cholestasis.
These findings suggest that the adaptive regulation of Fxr-mediated ileum-liver signaling axis on Cyp7a1/Cyp8b1 might be the potentially novel targets for amelioration or treatment of estrogen-induced cholestasis, and we expect that this study would be of great value to provide a cue for patients with estrogen-induced cholestasis.
Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a common urologic malignancy. Understanding of the transcriptional regulation of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes involved is critical for the development of the treatments for renal tumors. Using ccRCC subdivision of the TCGA dataset, we identified NR0B2 encoding orphan nuclear receptor as a tumor suppressor candidate in renal tissue. In independent cohort of primary renal tumors, quantitative PCR experiments confirmed significant suppression of NR0B2 mRNA in 86% of ccRCC samples studied. In 80% of these cases, we detected the hypermethylation of the NR0B2 pro-moter region. These results suggest that NR0B2 is a tumor suppressor gene in ccRCC, and that the hypermethylation of promoter region is the main mechanism of its downregulation.
The development of type‑2 diabetes and its complications is associated with lipid metabolism disorder. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) has an important role in regulating lipid and glucose metabolism. However, the underlying mechanism of this remains unclear. The present study investigated the role of fexaramine (Fex), an FXR agonist, on lipid metabolism. For this purpose, 6‑week‑old db/db mice were treated with Fex for 8 weeks via oral gavage and db/db mice treated with corn oil were used as controls. Body weight and food intake were monitored daily and bi‑weekly, respectively. A glucose tolerance test was performed during the final week of feeding. Blood samples were obtained for the analysis of lipids and enzymes related to hepatic function, and liver tissues were analyzed by histology and molecular examination. The results indicated that serum and liver triglyceride levels were decreased in db/db mice administered with Fex. Fewer small lipid droplets were observed in the liver. Small heterodimer partner (SHP), a downstream gene of FXR, was upregulated following Fex treatment. The mRNA and protein expression of genes associated with fatty acid oxidation [acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1α (CPT1‑α) and peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor‑coactivator‑1α] was also increased. Additionally, the expression of AMP‑activated protein kinase (AMPK) was also increased. However, the expression of sterol‑regulatory element binding protein‑1c and fatty acid synthase, which are associated with fatty acid synthesis, was not significantly different. Taken together, the results of the present study suggested that activation of FXR and its downstream gene SHP may induce the AMPK‑ACC‑CPT1‑α signaling pathway, which promotes fatty acids oxidation, ultimately achieving its lipid‑lowering effect.
Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder of bile flow disruption due to abnormal canalicular transport or impaired bile acid (BA) metabolism, causing excess BA accumulation and liver failure. We previously reported an intrahepatic cholestasis mouse model based on loss of function of both farnesoid X receptor (FXR; NR1H4) and a small heterodimer partner (SHP; NR0B2) [double knockout (DKO)], which has strong similarities to human PFIC5. We compared the pathogenesis of DKO livers with that of another intrahepatic cholestasis model, Bsep-/-, which represents human PFIC2. Both models exhibit severe hepatomegaly and hepatic BA accumulation, but DKO showed greater circulating BA and liver injury, and Bsep-/- had milder phenotypes. Molecular profiling of BAs uncovered specific enrichment of cholic acid (CA)-derived BAs in DKO livers but chenodeoxycholate-derived BAs in Bsep-/- livers. Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis revealed specific activation of CA synthesis and alternative basolateral BA transport in DKO but increased chenodeoxycholic acid synthesis and canalicular transport in Bsep-/-. The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR)/pregnane X receptor (PXR)-CYP2B/CYP2C axis is activated in DKO livers but not in other cholestasis models. Loss of this axis in Fxr:Shp:Car:Pxr quadruple knockouts blocked Cyp2b/Cyp2c gene induction, impaired bilirubin conjugation/elimination, and increased liver injury. Differential CYP2B expression in DKO and Bsep-/- was recapitulated in human PFIC5 and PFIC2 livers. In conclusion, loss of FXR/SHP results in distinct molecular pathogenesis and CAR/PXR activation, which promotes Cyp2b/Cyp2c gene transcription and bilirubin clearance. CAR/PXR activation was not observed in Bsep-/- mice or PFIC2 patients. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the heterogeneity of intrahepatic cholestasis.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a burgeoning health problem worldwide, ranging from nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL, steatosis without hepatocellular injury) to the more aggressive nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH, steatosis with ballooning, inflammation, or fibrosis). Although many studies have greatly contributed to the elucidation of NAFLD pathogenesis, the disease progression from NAFL to NASH remains incompletely understood. Nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (Nr0b2, SHP) is a transcriptional regulator critical for the regulation of bile acid, glucose, and lipid metabolism. Here, we show that SHP levels are decreased in the livers of patients with NASH and in diet-induced mouse NASH. Exposing primary mouse hepatocytes to palmitic acid and lipopolysaccharide in vitro, we demonstrated that the suppression of Shp expression in hepatocytes is due to c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, which stimulates c-Jun-mediated transcriptional repression of Shp Interestingly, in vivo induction of hepatocyte-specific SHP in steatotic mouse liver ameliorated NASH progression by attenuating liver inflammation and fibrosis, but not steatosis. Moreover, a key mechanism linking the anti-inflammatory role of hepatocyte-specific SHP expression to inflammation involved SHP-induced suppression of NF-κB p65-mediated induction of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), which activates macrophage proinflammatory polarization and migration. In summary, our results indicate that a JNK/SHP/NF-κB/CCL2 regulatory network controls communications between hepatocytes and macrophages and contributes to the disease progression from NAFL to NASH. Our findings may benefit the development of new management or prevention strategies for NASH.
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer in men worldwide. Currently, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test and digital rectal exam are the main screening tests used for PCa diagnosis. However, due to the low specificity of these tests, new alternative biomarkers such as deregulated RNAs and microRNAs have been implemented.
Aberrant expressions of small heterodimer partner gene (SHP, NR0B2) and mir-141 are reported in various cancers. The aim of this study was to investigate the SHP and miR-141 expression level in tissue samples of prostate cancer.
The expression level of SHP gene and miR-141 was assessed by real time PCR and their relative amounts were calculated by the Δ⁢ΔCT method. Also, IHC technique was used to determine the expression level of SHP protein.
The miR-141 was significantly up-regulated in the samples of metastatic tumors compared to localized tumor samples (P&lt; 0.001, 31.17-fold change). Tumor samples showed lower SHP mRNA expression levels than BPH samples (p= 0.014, 4.7-fold change). The results of paired t-test analysis showed there was no significant difference between the SHP gene expression in PCa samples and their matched tumor-adjacent normal tissue (p= 0.5).
The data obtained in our study confirm the involvement of miR-141 in PCa progression and metastasis. These effects could be mediated by AR via down-regulation of its co-repressor protein, i.e., SHP.
The regulation of hepatic very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion plays an important role in the pathogenesis of dyslipidemia and fatty liver diseases. VLDL is controlled by hepatic microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP). Mttp is regulated by carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) and small heterodimer partner (SHP). However, it is unclear whether both coordinately regulate Mttp expression and VLDL secretion. Here, adenoviral overexpression of ChREBP and SHP in rat primary hepatocytes induced and suppressed Mttp mRNA, respectively. However, Mttp induction by ChREBP was much more potent than suppression by SHP. Promoter assays of Mttp and the liver type pyruvate kinase gene revealed that SHP and ChREBP did not affect the transcriptional activity of each other. Mttp mRNA and protein levels of Shp-/- mice were similar to those of wild-types; however, those of Chrebp-/-Shp-/- and Chrebp-/- mice were significantly much lower. Consistent with this, the VLDL particle number and VLDL secretion rates in Shp-/- mice were similar to wild-types but were much lower in Chrebp-/- and Chrebp-/-Shp-/- mice. These findings suggest that ChREBP, rather than SHP, regulates VLDL secretion under normal conditions and that ChREBP and SHP do not affect the transcriptional activities of each other.
Cholestatic liver injury is an important clinical problem with limited understanding of disease pathologies. Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles released by a variety of cells, including cholangiocytes. Exosome-mediated cell-cell communication can modulate various cellular functions by transferring a variety of intracellular components to target cells. Our recent studies indicate that the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), H19, is mainly expressed in cholangiocytes, and its aberrant expression is associated with significant down-regulation of small heterodimer partner (SHP) in hepatocytes and cholestatic liver injury in multidrug resistance 2 knockout (Mdr2-/- ) mice. However, how cholangiocyte-derived H19 suppresses SHP in hepatocytes remains unknown. Here, we report that cholangiocyte-derived exosomes mediate transfer of H19 into hepatocytes and promote cholestatic injury. Hepatic H19 level is correlated with severity of cholestatic injury in both fibrotic mouse models, including Mdr2-/- mice, a well-characterized model of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), or CCl4 -induced cholestatic liver injury mouse models, and human PSC patients. Moreover, serum exosomal-H19 level is gradually up-regulated during disease progression in Mdr2-/- mice and patients with cirrhosis. H19-carrying exosomes from the primary cholangiocytes of wild-type (WT) mice suppress SHP expression in hepatocytes, but not the exosomes from the cholangiocytes of H19-/- mice. Furthermore, overexpression of H19 significantly suppressed SHP expression at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Importantly, transplant of H19-carrying serum exosomes of old fibrotic Mdr2-/- mice significantly promoted liver fibrosis (LF) in young Mdr2-/- mice.
Cholangiocyte-derived exosomal-H19 plays a critical role in cholestatic liver injury. Serum exosomal H19 represents a noninvasive biomarker and potential therapeutic target for cholestatic diseases. (Hepatology 2018).
Phosphatidylcholines (PC) and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) are critical determinants of hepatic lipid levels, but how their levels are regulated is unclear. Here, we show that Pemt and Gnmt, key one-carbon cycle genes regulating PC/SAM levels, are downregulated after feeding, leading to decreased PC and increased SAM levels, but these effects are blunted in small heterodimer partner (SHP)-null or FGF15-null mice. Further, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is translocated into the nucleus by insulin/PKB signaling in the early fed state and induces Pemt and Gnmt expression. This induction is blocked by FGF15 signaling-activated SHP in the late fed state. Adenoviral-mediated expression of AhR in obese mice increases PC levels and exacerbates steatosis, effects that are blunted by SHP co-expression or Pemt downregulation. PEMT, AHR, and PC levels are elevated in simple steatosis patients, but PC levels are robustly reduced in steatohepatitis-fibrosis patients. This study identifies AhR and SHP as new physiological regulators of PC/SAM levels.
Although detailed pathophysiological mechanisms of fulminant hepatitis remain elusive, immune cell recruitment with excessive cytokine production is a well-recognized hallmark of the disease. We determined the function of orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP) in concanavalin A (ConA)-induced hepatitis model. Male C57BL/6 J mice were injected intravenously with either a lethal dose (25 mg/kg) or a sub-lethal dose (15 mg/kg) of ConA. For the C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL) 2 neutralization study, mice were intravenously administered anti-mouse CXCL2 antibody (100 μg/mouse). Thirty-six hours following lethal dose of ConA administration, 47% wild type (WT) mice were alive, whereas &gt;85% of Shp knockout (KO) were dead. Shp KO mice were highly susceptible to ConA-induced liver injury and exhibited increased liver necrosis upon sub-lethal dose of ConA administration. FACS analysis and immunohistochemical staining showed significantly higher neutrophil infiltration in Shp KO mice, as compared with WT mice. We found that also in the WT situation, Shp expression gradually decreased, while Cxcl2 expression increased until 6 h, and vice versa at 24 h upon ConA-treatment, indicating an inverse correlation between Shp and Cxcl2 expression during ConA-induced hepatitis. Furthermore, in vivo neutralization of CXCL2 with neutralizing antibody reduces ConA-induced plasma ALT and AST levels, hepatocyte death and neutrophil infiltration in Shp KO mice. Collectively, these results confirm that lacking of SHP results in CXCL2-dependent neutrophil infiltration in ConA-induced liver damage. SHP plays a protective, anti-inflammatory role in liver during acute liver inflammation.
Binge drinking among alcohol consumers is a common occurrence, and may result in the development of numerous diseases, including liver disorders. It has previously been reported that natural killer T (NKT) cells induce alcohol‑associated liver injury by promoting neutrophil infiltration. In the present study, the role of the orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP), which is encoded by the NR0B2 gene, in acute binge drinking‑induced liver injury was investigated. SHP‑knockout (KO) and wild‑type (WT) control mice were intragastrically administered single doses of alcohol. The plasma concentrations of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase in SHP‑KO mice following alcohol treatment were significantly increased compared with WT mice. However, results of oil red O staining and 2',7'‑dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate staining indicated that levels of acute binge drinking‑associated hepatic lipid accumulation and oxidative stress were not significantly different between WT and SHP‑KO alcohol‑treated mice. Notably, tumor necrosis factor‑α mRNA expression in the liver of SHP‑KO mice was significantly increased following alcohol administration, compared with WT mice. Furthermore, the mRNA expression levels of C‑C motif chemokine ligand 2, C‑X‑C motif chemokine ligand 2 and interleukin‑4, which are all potent chemoattractants of NKT cells, as well as neutrophil expression levels, were significantly increased in the livers of SHP‑KO mice compared with WT mice following alcohol administration, as determined by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry. Enhanced infiltration of NKT cells, determined by flow cytometry, was also demonstrated in the livers of SHP‑KO mice following alcohol administration, compared with WT mice. The results of the present study indicate that SHP may be involved in liver‑associated protective mechanisms, with regards to the attenuation of damage caused by acute binge drinking, via regulation of NKT cell and neutrophil migration to the liver. The modulation of SHP may be a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of acute binge drinking‑induced liver injury.
Bile acids are endogenous ligands of the nuclear receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and pharmacological FXR modulators are under development for the treatment of several liver disorders. The inositol-requiring enzyme 1α/X-box binding protein 1 (IRE1α/XBP1) pathway of the unfolded protein response (UPR) is a protective cellular signaling pathway activated in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We investigated the role of FXR signaling in activation of the hepatic XBP1 pathway. Mice were treated with deoxycholic acid (DCA), cholestyramine, GW4064, or underwent bile duct ligation (BDL), and hepatic UPR activation was measured. Huh7-Ntcp and HepG2 cells were treated with FXR agonists, inhibitor, small interfering RNA (siRNA), or small heterodimer partner (SHP) siRNA to determine the mechanisms of IRE1α/XBP1 pathway activation. DCA feeding and BDL increased and cholestyramine decreased expression of hepatic XBP1 spliced (XBP1s). XBP1 pathway activation increased in Huh7-Ntcp and HepG2 cells treated with bile acids, 6α-ethyl-chenodeoxycholic acid (6-ECDCA) or GW4064. This effect decreased with FXR knockdown and treatment with the FXR inhibitor guggulsterone. FXR agonists increased XBP1 splicing and phosphorylated IRE1α (p-IRE1α) expression. Overexpression of SHP similarly increased XBP1 splicing, XBP1s, and p-IRE1α protein expression. SHP knockdown attenuated FXR agonist-induced XBP1s and p-IRE1α protein expression. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays demonstrate a physical interaction between overexpressed green fluorescent protein (GFP)-SHP and FLAG-IRE1α in HEK293T cells. Mice treated with GW4064 had increased, and FXR and SHP null mice had decreased, basal Xbp1s gene expression.
FXR signaling activates the IRE1α/XBP1 pathway in vivo and in vitro. FXR pathway activation increases XBP1 splicing and enhances p-IRE1α expression. These effects are mediated, at least in part, by SHP. IRE1α/XBP1 pathway activation by bile acids and pharmacological FXR agonists may be protective during liver injury and may have therapeutic implications for liver diseases. (Hepatology 2018;68:304-316).
Liver injury is associated with devastating consequences caused by inflammation and apoptosis. The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a nuclear receptor that has an essential role in hepatoprotection by maintaining the homeostasis of liver metabolism. The present study investigated the capacity of the FXR agonist GW4064 to protect the livers of mice from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‑induced inflammation and apoptosis. Male C57BL/6J [wild‑type (WT)] and FXR knockout (KO) mice were intraperitoneally injected with LPS or saline. LPS‑treated mice were intraperitoneally injected with vehicle or GW4064 (20 mg/kg) twice and then sacrificed. Activation of FXR by GW4064 alleviated hepatic inflammation in the LPS‑induced murine liver injury model as reflected by reduced serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase and pro‑inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression, including tumor necrosis factor‑α, as well as interleukin‑6 and ‑1β in WT mice. In addition, Toll‑like receptor 4 (TLR4), p38 mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK), B‑cell lymphoma‑2‑associated X protein and cytochrome c protein levels were decreased in WT mice receiving LPS with simultaneous GW4064 administration compared with those receiving LPS alone, while this was not observed in FXR KO mice. These results indicated that in WT mice, administration of GW4064 ameliorated LPS‑mediated liver injury by upregulation of FXR expression, which was in part mediated by the TLR4/p38 MAPK pathway.
An increase in intracellular lipid droplet formation and hepatic triglyceride (TG) content usually results in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of hepatic TG homeostasis remain unclear.
Oil red O staining and TG measurement were performed to determine the lipid content. miRNA expression was evaluated by quantitative PCR. A luciferase assay was performed to validate the regulation of Yin Yang 1 (YY1) by microRNA (miR)-122. The effects of miR-122 expression on YY1 and its mechanisms involving the farnesoid X receptor and small heterodimer partner (FXR-SHP) pathway were evaluated by quantitative PCR and Western blot analyses.
miR-122 was downregulated in free fatty acid (FFA)-induced steatotic hepatocytes, and streptozotocin and high-fat diet (STZ-HFD) induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in mice. Transfection of hepatocytes with miR-122 mimics before FFA induction inhibited lipid droplet formation and TG accumulation in vitro. These results were verified by overexpressing miR-122 in the livers of STZ-HFD-induced NASH mice. The 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of YY1 mRNA is predicted to contain an evolutionarily conserved miR-122 binding site. In silico searches, a luciferase reporter assay and quantitative PCR analysis confirmed that miR-122 directly bound to the YY1 3'UTR to negatively regulate YY1 mRNA in HepG2 and Huh7 cells. The (FXR-SHP) signaling axis, which is downstream of YY1, may play a key role in the mechanism of miR-122-regulated lipid homeostasis. YY1-FXR-SHP signaling, which is negatively regulated by FFA, was enhanced by miR-122 overexpression. This finding was also confirmed by overexpression of miR-122 in the livers of NASH mice.
The present results indicate that miR-122 plays an important role in lipid (particularly TG) accumulation in the liver by reducing YY1 mRNA stability to upregulate FXR-SHP signaling.
Desynchronization between the master clock in the brain, which is entrained by (day) light, and peripheral organ clocks, which are mainly entrained by food intake, may have negative effects on energy metabolism. Bile acid metabolism follows a clear day/night rhythm. We investigated whether in rats on a normal chow diet the daily rhythm of plasma bile acids and hepatic expression of bile acid metabolic genes is controlled by the light/dark cycle or the feeding/fasting rhythm. In addition, we investigated the effects of high caloric diets and time-restricted feeding on daily rhythms of plasma bile acids and hepatic genes involved in bile acid synthesis. In experiment 1 male Wistar rats were fed according to three different feeding paradigms: food was available ad libitum for 24 h (ad lib) or time-restricted for 10 h during the dark period (dark fed) or 10 h during the light period (light fed). To allow further metabolic phenotyping, we manipulated dietary macronutrient intake by providing rats with a chow diet, a free choice high-fat-high-sugar diet or a free choice high-fat (HF) diet. In experiment 2 rats were fed a normal chow diet, but food was either available in a 6-meals-a-day (6M) scheme or ad lib. During both experiments, we measured plasma bile acid levels and hepatic mRNA expression of genes involved in bile acid metabolism at eight different time points during 24 h. Time-restricted feeding enhanced the daily rhythm in plasma bile acid concentrations. Plasma bile acid concentrations are highest during fasting and dropped during the period of food intake with all diets. An HF-containing diet changed bile acid pool composition, but not the daily rhythmicity of plasma bile acid levels. Daily rhythms of hepatic Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1 mRNA expression followed the hepatic molecular clock, whereas for Shp expression food intake was leading. Combining an HF diet with feeding in the light/inactive period annulled CYp7a1 and Cyp8b1 gene expression rhythms, whilst keeping that of Shp intact. In conclusion, plasma bile acids and key genes in bile acid biosynthesis are entrained by food intake as well as the hepatic molecular clock. Eating during the inactivity period induced changes in the plasma bile acid pool composition similar to those induced by HF feeding.
The small heterodimer partner (SHP) regulates fatty acid oxidation and lipogenesis in the liver by regulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ expression. SHP is also abundantly expressed in the myocardium. We investigated the effect of SHP expression on myocardia assessing not only heart structure and function but also lipid metabolism and related gene expression in a SHP deletion animal model. Transcriptional profiling with a microarray revealed that genes participating in cell growth, cytokine signalling, phospholipid metabolism, and extracellular matrix are up-regulated in the myocardia of SHP knockout (KO) mice compared to those of wild-type (WT) mice (nominal p value &lt; 0.05). Consistent with these gene expression changes, the left ventricular masses of SHP KO mice were significantly higher than WT mice (76.8 ± 20.5 mg vs. 52.8 ± 6.8 mg, P = 0.0093). After 12 weeks of high fat diet (HFD), SHP KO mice gained less weight and exhibited less elevation in serum-free fatty acid and less ectopic lipid accumulation in the myocardium than WT mice. According to microarray analysis, genes regulated by PPARγ1 and PPARα were down-regulated in myocardia of SHP KO mice compared to their expression in WT mice after HFD, suggesting that the reduction in lipid accumulation in the myocardium resulted from a decrease in lipogenesis regulated by PPARγ. We confirmed the reduced expression of PPARγ1 and PPARα target genes such as CD36, medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase by SHP KO after HFD.
Small heterodimer partner 1 (SHP1, NR0B2) is a member of the superfamily of nuclear receptors (NRs). Even if this orphan receptor, unlike other NRs, lacks the DNA-binding domain, it is capable of regulating transcription by repressing the activity of other NRs by direct protein-protein interaction. Accordingly, SHP1 is part of negative feedback loops of the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in drug metabolism and various metabolic pathways including bile acid and glucose homeostasis. Although it is known that several interacting partners of SHP1 also modulate its expression, there is little information about genetic variability of this regulatory mechanism. Our study aimed to identify genetic variants in the NR0B2 promoter region and to determine their impact on NR0B2 transcription. For this, DNA samples originating from 119 participants of the population-based cohort Study of Health in Pomerania were analyzed by Sanger sequencing revealing four genetic variants: NR0B2:c.-594T&gt;C (rs71636795), NR0B2:c.-414G&gt;C (newly identified), NR0B2:c.-423C&gt;T (rs78182695), and NR0B2:c.-224delCTGA (rs145613139) localized in the 5' untranslated region of NR0B2. The impact of these variants on transactivation of the NR0B2 promoter by NRs known to be regulators of SHP1 expression (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α, liver receptor homolog-1, and farnesoid X receptor) was assessed in a cell-based reporter gene assay, showing that transactivation by hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α and liver receptor homolog-1 was significantly decreased in the presence of the genetic variant NR0B2:c.-594T&gt;C, even though this effect was cell specific. However, SHP1 mRNA expression in a small collection of human kidney samples was not affected by these genetic variants.
Fructus Gardenia (FG), containing the major active constituent Geniposide, is widely used in China for medicinal purposes. Currently, clinical reports of FG toxicity have not been published, however, animal studies have shown FG or Geniposide can cause hepatotoxicity in rats. We investigated Geniposide-induced hepatic injury in male Sprague-Dawley rats after 3-day intragastric administration of 100 mg/kg or 300 mg/kg Geniposide. Changes in hepatic histomorphology, serum liver enzyme, serum and hepatic bile acid profiles, and hepatic bile acid synthesis and transportation gene expression were measured. The 300 mg/kg Geniposide caused liver injury evidenced by pathological changes and increases in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and γ-glutamytransferase (γ-GT). While liver, but not sera, total bile acids (TBAs) were increased 75% by this dose, dominated by increases in taurine-conjugated bile acids (t-CBAs). The 300 mg/kg Geniposide also down-regulated expression of Farnesoid X receptor (FXR), small heterodimer partner (SHP) and bile salt export pump (BSEP). In conclusion, 300 mg/kg Geniposide can induce liver injury with associated changes in bile acid regulating genes, leading to an accumulation of taurine conjugates in the rat liver. Taurocholic acid (TCA), taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA) as well as tauro-α-muricholic acid (T-α-MCA) are potential markers for Geniposide-induced hepatic damage.
The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a transcription factor of which the underlying gene regulatory mechanisms are complex and incompletely understood. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory Compound A (CpdA), a selective GR modulating compound in various cell models, has been shown to favour GR-mediated gene repression but not GR-mediated gene activation. Shifting balances towards only a particular subset of GR gene regulatory events may be of benefit in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. We present evidence to support that the combination of CpdA with Dexamethasone (DEX), a classic steroidal GR ligand, can shape GR function towards a unique gene regulatory profile in a cell type-dependent manner. The molecular basis hereof is a changed GR phosphorylation status concomitant with a change in the GR cofactor recruitment profile. We subsequently identified and confirmed the orphan nuclear receptor SHP as a coregulator that is specifically enriched at GR when CpdA and DEX are combined. Combining CpdA with DEX not only leads to stronger suppression of pro-inflammatory gene expression, but also enhanced anti-inflammatory GR target gene expression in epithelial cells, making ligand combination strategies in future a potentially attractive alternative manner of skewing and fine-tuning GR effects towards an improved therapeutic benefit.
Circadian rhythm misalignment has been increasingly recognized to pose health risk for a wide range of diseases, particularly metabolic disorders. The liver maintains metabolic homeostasis and expresses many circadian genes, such as differentiated embryo chondrocyte-1 (DEC1) and small heterodimer partner (SHP). DEC1 is established to repress transcription through E-box elements, and SHP belongs to the superfamily of nuclear receptors and has multiple E-box elements in its promoter. Importantly, DEC1 and SHP are inversely oscillated. This study was performed to test the hypothesis that the SHP gene is a target gene of DEC1. Cotransfection demonstrated that DEC1 repressed the SHP promoter and attenuated the transactivation of the classic circadian activator complex of Clock/Bmal1. Site-directed mutagenesis, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation established that the repression was achieved through the E-box in the proximal promoter. Transfection of DEC1 suppressed the expression of SHP. In circadian-inducing cells, the epileptic agent valproate inversely altered the expression of DEC1 and SHP. Both DEC1 and SHP are involved in energy balance and valproate is known to induce hepatic steatosis. Our findings collectively establish that DEC1 participates in the negative loop of SHP oscillating expression with potential implications in metabolic homeostasis.
Cullin-RING ligases (CRLs) are the biggest family of multiunit ubiquitin E3 ligases, controlling many biological processes by promoting the degradation of a broad spectrum of proteins associated with cell cycle, signal transduction and cell growth. The dysfunction of CRLs causes a lot of diseases including cancer, which meanwhile offers us a promising approach to cancer therapy by targeting to CRLs. Recent studies have demonstrated that genetic or pharmaceutical inactivation of CRLs often leads to cancer cell death by activating multiple cell-killing pathways including senescence, an emerging anticancer mechanism of therapeutic agents. Here, we summarize the induction of cellular senescence and its mechanism of action, triggered by targeting to specific subunits of CRLs via multiple approaches including siRNA silencing, genetic knockout as well as small molecule inhibitor, exhibiting anticancer effect in vitro and in vivo.
Assessment of disease biomarkers, particularly the in vivo assessment of amyloid-β (Aβ) burden with positron emission tomography (PET), is gradually becoming central to the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the incorporation of biomarker evidence to the diagnostic process is currently restricted mainly to research settings. The identification of memory measures that are associated with Aβ is of clinical relevance as this may enhance the confidence in making a diagnosis of MCI due to AD in clinical settings. Forty one persons with amnestic MCI underwent Aβ imaging with (18)F-Florbetaben PET, magnetic resonance imaging, and a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. All measures of episodic memory were significantly correlated with Aβ burden, but regression analyses revealed a strong and selective association between story recall and Aβ over and beyond the effects of age, education, global cognition, hippocampal volume, or other memory tests. Analyses of sensitivity and specificity of memory measures to detect high versus low Aβ scans suggested that word-list recall performed better when high sensitivity was preferred, whereas story recall performed better when high specificity was preferred. In conclusion, a measure of story recall may increase the confidence in making a diagnosis of MCI due to AD in clinical settings.
RBX1/ROC1 is an essential subunit of the largest multiunit Cullin-RING E3 ligase (CRL), which controls the degradation of diverse substrates, thereby regulating numerous cellular processes. Recently, we reported that RBX1 is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and its expression is negatively correlated with patient survival. Moreover, siRNA silencing of RBX1 inhibits the proliferation of liver cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo by inducing CDKN1A/p21-dependent cell senescence. Interestingly, independent of senescence, RBX1 knockdown also triggers an autophagy response, due, at least in part, to the accumulation of the MTOR-inhibitory protein DEPTOR, a recently identified CRL substrate. Biologically, blockage of autophagy significantly enhances the growth-suppressive effect of RBX1 knockdown by triggering massive apoptosis, indicating that the autophagy response upon RBX1 knockdown serves as a survival signal in liver cells. Similar observations were also made in many types of human cancer cells upon inhibition of CRL by MLN4924. These findings suggest that RBX1-CRL is a promising anti-cancer drug target and provide proof-of-concept evidence for a novel drug combination of RBX1-CRL inhibitor and autophagy inhibitor for effective treatment of human cancer.
Identification of regulatable mechanisms by which transcription factor NF-E2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is repressed will allow strategies to be designed that counter drug resistance associated with its upregulation in tumours that harbour somatic mutations in Kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1 (Keap1), a gene that encodes a joint adaptor and substrate receptor for the Cul3-Rbx1/Roc1 ubiquitin ligase. We now show that mouse Nrf2 contains two binding sites for β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP), which acts as a substrate receptor for the Skp1-Cul1-Rbx1/Roc1 ubiquitin ligase complex. Deletion of either binding site in Nrf2 decreased β-TrCP-mediated ubiquitylation of the transcription factor. The ability of one of the two β-TrCP-binding sites to serve as a degron could be both increased and decreased by manipulation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) activity. Biotinylated-peptide pull-down assays identified DSGIS(338) and DSAPGS(378) as the two β-TrCP-binding motifs in Nrf2. Significantly, our pull-down assays indicated that β-TrCP binds a phosphorylated version of DSGIS more tightly than its non-phosphorylated counterpart, whereas this was not the case for DSAPGS. These data suggest that DSGIS, but not DSAPGS, contains a functional GSK-3 phosphorylation site. Activation of GSK-3 in Keap1-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), or in human lung A549 cells that contain mutant Keap1, by inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt pathway markedly reduced endogenous Nrf2 protein and decreased to 10-50% of normal the levels of mRNA for prototypic Nrf2-regulated enzymes, including the glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic and modifier subunits, glutathione S-transferases Alpha-1 and Mu-1, haem oxygenase-1 and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1. Pre-treatment of Keap1(-/-) MEFs or A549 cells with the LY294002 PI3K inhibitor or the MK-2206 PKB/Akt inhibitor increased their sensitivity to acrolein, chlorambucil and cisplatin between 1.9-fold and 3.1-fold, and this was substantially attenuated by simultaneous pre-treatment with the GSK-3 inhibitor CT99021. 
The G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) phosphorylate agonist occupied G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and desensitize GPCR-mediated signaling. Recent studies indicate they also function non-catalytically via interaction with other proteins. In this study, a proteomic approach was used to screen interacting proteins of GRK5 in MDA-MB-231 cells and HUVEC cells. Mass spectrometry analysis reveals several proteins in the GRK5 immunocomplex including damaged DNA-binding protein 1 (DDB1), an adaptor subunit of the CUL4-ROC1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the association of GRK5 with DDB1-CUL4 complex, and reveal that DDB1 acts as an adapter to link GRK5 to CUL4 to form the complex. Overexpression of DDB1 promoted, whereas knockdown of DDB1 inhibited the ubiquitination of GRK5, and the degradation of GRK5 was reduced in cells deficient of DDB1. Furthermore, the depletion of DDB1 decreased Hsp90 inhibitor-induced GRK5 destabilization and UV irradiation-induced GRK5 degradation. Thus, our study identified potential GRK5 interacting proteins, and reveals the association of GRK5 with DDB1 in cell and the regulation of GRK5 level by DDB1-CUL4 ubiquitin ligase complex-dependent proteolysis pathway.
Regulator of Cullins-1 (ROC1) or RING box protein-1 (RBX1) is an essential RING component of Cullin-RING ligase (CRL). Our previous studies showed that ROC1 is required for the growth of several cancer cell lines while ROC1 siRNA silencing inactivates CRL, leading to cell cycle arrest, cell senescence and/or apoptosis. However, it is completely unknown whether ROC1 knockdown triggers autophagic response by inactivating CRL. Moreover, the role of ROC1 in liver cancer remains elusive. In this study, we reported that ROC1 knockdown significantly inhibited the growth of liver cancer cells by sequentially and independently inducing autophagy and p21-dependent cell senescence. Mechanism analysis revealed that ROC1 silencing triggered autophagy by inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity due to accumulation of mTOR-inhibitory protein Deptor, a substrate of CRL. Consistently, Deptor knockdown significantly blocked autophagy response upon ROC1 silencing. Biologically, autophagy response upon ROC1 silencing was a survival signal, and blockage of autophagy pathway sensitized cancer cells to apoptosis. Finally, we demonstrated that ROC1 was overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinomas, which is associated with poor prognosis of liver cancer patients. These findings suggest that ROC1 is an appealing drug target for liver cancer and provide a proof-of-concept evidence for a novel drug combination of ROC1 inhibitor and an autophagy inhibitor for effective treatment of liver cancer by enhancing apoptosis.
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress develops when the ER is overloaded with too many proteins to fold. This elicits a signaling pathway called the unfolded protein response. The unfolded protein response is physiologically required for the terminal development of B cells into antibody-secreting plasma cells. Ring Box Protein 1 (RBX1) is a 14-kDa protein necessary for ubiquitin ligation activity of the multimeric cullin ring ubiquitin ligases (CRLs). As RBX1 is shared by a large number of CRLs, alterations in its activity may lead to global changes in protein stability. We discovered that RBX1 is cleaved in the course of LPS-induced plasma cell differentiation and in multiple myeloma cell lines upon induction of pharmacological ER stress. The cleavage is executed by several caspase proteases that cleave RBX1 eight amino acids from the N terminus. To address the possible implication of RBX1 cleavage for CRL activity, we replaced the endogenous RBX1 homolog of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Roc1, with the wild type or the N-terminal Δ8 mutant human RBX1. We show that yeast expressing the cleaved RBX1 are hypersensitive to ER stress and are impaired in CRL-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. We propose a model by which N-terminal cleavage of RBX1 impairs its activity and promotes susceptibility to ER stress induction.
When mammalian cells experience radiation insult, DNA replication is stalled to prevent erroneous DNA synthesis. UV-irradiation triggers proteolysis of Mcm10, an essential human replication factor, inhibiting the ongoing replication. Here, we report that Mcm10 associates with E3 ubiquitin ligase comprising DNA damage-binding protein, DDB1, cullin, Cul4 and ring finger protein, Roc1. Depletion of DDB1, Roc1 or Cul4 abrogates the UV-triggered Mcm10 proteolysis, implying that Cul4-Roc1-DDB1 ubiquitin ligase mediates Mcm10 downregulation. The purified Cul4-Roc1-DDB1 complex ubiquitinates Mcm10 in vitro, proving that Mcm10 is its substrate. By screening the known DDB1 interacting proteins, we discovered that VprBP is the substrate recognition subunit that targets Mcm10 for degradation. Hence, these results establish that Cul4-DDB1-VprBP ubiquitin ligase mediates the stress-induced proteolysis of replication factor, Mcm10.
Although multiple photoreceptors converge to control common aspects of seedling de-etiolation, we are relatively ignorant of the genes acting at or downstream of their signalling convergence. To address this issue we screened for mutants under a mixture of blue plus far-red light and identified roc1-1D. The roc1-1D mutant, showing elevated expression of the ROTAMASE CYCLOPHILIN 1 (ROC1/AtCYP18-3) gene, and partial loss-of function roc1 alleles, has defects in phytochrome A (phyA)-, cryptochrome 1 (cry1)- and phytochrome B (phyB)-mediated de-etiolation, including long hypocotyls under blue or far-red light. These mutants show elevated sensitivity to brassinosteroids in the light but not in the dark. Mutations at brassinosteroid signalling genes and the application of a brassinosteroid synthesis inhibitor eliminated the roc1 and roc1-D phenotypes. The roc1 and roc1-D mutants show altered patterns of phosphorylation of the transcription factor BES1, a known point of control of sensitivity to brassinosteroids, which correlate with the expression levels of genes directly targeted by BES1. We propose a model where perception of light by phyA, cry1 or phyB activates ROC1 (at least in part by enhancing its expression). This in turn reduces the intensity of brassinosteroid signalling and fine-tunes seedling de-etiolation.
RING E3 ligases are proteins that must selectively recruit an E2-conjugating enzyme and facilitate ubiquitin transfer to a substrate. It is not clear how a RING E3 ligase differentiates a naked E2 enzyme from the E2∼ubiquitin-conjugated form or how this is altered upon ubiquitin transfer. RING-box protein 1 (Rbx1/ROC1) is a key protein found in the Skp1/Cullin-1/F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that functions with the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme CDC34. The solution structure of Rbx1/ROC1 revealed a globular RING domain (residues 40-108) stabilized by three structural zinc ions (root mean square deviation 0.30 ± 0.04 Å) along with a disordered N terminus (residues 12-39). Titration data showed that Rbx1/ROC1 preferentially recruits CDC34 in its ubiquitin-conjugated form and favors this interaction by 50-fold compared with unconjugated CDC34. Furthermore, NMR and biochemical assays identified residues in helix α2 of Rbx1/ROC1 that are essential for binding and activating CDC34∼ubiquitin for ubiquitylation. Taken together, this work provides the first direct structural and biochemical evidence showing that polyubiquitylation by the RING E3 ligase Rbx1/ROC1 requires the preferential recruitment of an E2∼ubiquitin complex and subsequent release of the unconjugated E2 protein upon ubiquitin transfer to a substrate or ubiquitin chain.
A subset of signaling pathways play exceptionally important roles in embryonic and post-embryonic development, and mis-regulation of these pathways occurs in most human cancers. One such pathway is the Wnt pathway. The primary mechanism keeping Wnt signaling off in the absence of ligand is regulated proteasomal destruction of the canonical Wnt effector ßcatenin (or its fly homolog Armadillo). A substantial body of evidence indicates that SCF(βTrCP) mediates βcat destruction, however, an essential role for Roc1 has not been demonstrated in this process, as would be predicted. In addition, other E3 ligases have also been proposed to destroy βcat, suggesting that βcat destruction may be regulated differently in different tissues.
Here we used cultured Drosophila cells, human colon cancer cells, and Drosophila embryos and larvae to explore the machinery that targets Armadillo for destruction. Using RNAi in Drosophila S2 cells to examine which SCF components are essential for Armadillo destruction, we find that Roc1/Roc1a is essential for regulating Armadillo stability, and that in these cells the only F-box protein playing a detectable role is Slimb. Second, we find that while embryonic and larval Drosophila tissues use the same destruction complex proteins, the response of these tissues to destruction complex inactivation differs, with Armadillo levels more elevated in embryos. We provide evidence consistent with the possibility that this is due to differences in armadillo mRNA levels. Third, we find that there is no correlation between the ability of different APC2 mutant proteins to negatively regulate Armadillo levels, and their recently described function in positively-regulating Wnt signaling. Finally, we demonstrate that APC proteins lacking the N-terminal Armadillo-repeat domain cannot restore Armadillo destruction but retain residual function in negatively-regulating Wnt signaling.
We use these data to refine our model for how Wnt signaling is regulated during normal development.
Thalidomide was originally developed in 1954 as a sedative that was commonly used to ameliorate morning sickness. However, thalidomide exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy caused multiple birth defects (e.g. phocomelia and amelia), affecting ≈ 10,000 children worldwide in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Thalidomide is now recognized as a clinically effective, albeit strictly restricted, drug for the treatment of leprosy and multiple myeloma. Investigators have studied thalidomide teratogenicity for half a century, proposing over 30 hypotheses to account for its actions. Among these, the anti-angiogenesis and oxidative stress models have gained widespread support. Nonetheless, the precise molecular mechanisms and direct targets of thalidomide have not heretofore been elucidated. We developed ferrite-glycidyl methacrylate beads that enable magnetic separation and efficient purification of ligand-binding molecules; the beads were recently employed to identify cereblon as a primary target of thalidomide. Cereblon forms an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex with DDB1, Cul4A, and Roc1, which is important for the expression of fibroblast growth factor 8, an essential regulator of limb development. Expression of a drug binding-deficient mutant of cereblon suppressed thalidomide-induced effects in zebrafish and chicks. This suggests that thalidomide downregulates fibroblast growth factor 8 expression and induces limb malformation by binding to wild-type cereblon, inhibiting the function of the associated E3 ubiquitin ligase. The present review summarizes the teratogenicity of thalidomide, including existing models for its mode of action, and discusses the identification of cereblon as a key molecule for deciphering the longstanding mystery of thalidomide teratogenicity.
The 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)7 receptor is the most recently identified serotonin receptor and is involved in a wide variety of central nervous system (CNS) functions, namely circadian rhythm, REM sleep, depression, thermoregulation, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety, schizophrenia, epilepsy, nociception, migraine, sensation-seeking behavior, impulsivity, learning and memory. These numerous (patho)physiological processes of the CNS, in which the 5-HT7 receptor is involved, most likely reflect a diverse set of signaling pathways arising from this receptor. In order to reveal new interaction partners and possibly new signaling and/or trafficking pathways, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening, using the C-terminal tail of the 5-HT7a receptor as bait and an adult-human brain cDNA library as prey. In this way we identified RhoBTB3 as a new interaction partner of the 5-HT7a receptor. By means of co-immunoprecipitation we were able to confirm the interaction between full length 5-HT7a receptor and RhoBTB3 in HEK293T cells. Subsequent domain mapping of this interaction revealed that not only the C-terminal tail, but also the third intracellular loop of the 5-HT7a receptor is involved. In addition, immunofluorescence microscopy showed clear co-localization between the 5-HT7a receptor and RhoBTB3 at the plasma membrane and in the endoplasmic reticulum. Despite the fact that RhoBTB3 has been shown to interact with Cul3, which in turn interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Roc1, we show here that RhoBTB3 neither recruits Cul3/Roc1 to the 5-HT7a receptor nor does it mediate ubiquitination of this receptor. Instead, we demonstrate that RhoBTB3 strongly inhibits proteasomal degradation of the 5-HT7a receptor.
The N-terminus of full-length RAG1, though dispensable for RAG1/2 cleavage activity, is required for efficient V(D)J recombination. This region supports RING E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro, but whether full-length RAG1 functions as a single subunit or a multi-subunit E3 ligase in vivo is unclear. We show the multi-subunit cullin RING E3 ligase complex VprBP/DDB1/Cul4A/Roc1 associates with full-length RAG1 through VprBP. This complex is assembled into RAG protein-DNA complexes, and supports in-vitro ubiquitylation activity that is insensitive to RAG1 RING domain mutations. Conditional B lineage-specific VprBP disruption arrests B-cell development at the pro-B-to-pre-B cell transition, but this block is bypassed by expressing rearranged immunoglobulin transgenes. Mice with a conditional VprBP disruption show modest reduction of D-J(H) rearrangement, whereas V(H)-DJ(H) and V(κ)-J(κ) rearrangements are severely impaired. D-J(H) coding joints from VprBP-insufficent mice show longer junctional nucleotide insertions and a higher mutation frequency in D and J segments than normal. These data suggest full-length RAG1 recruits a cullin RING E3 ligase complex to ubiquitylate an unknown protein(s) to limit error-prone repair during V(D)J recombination.
Cullin 4B (CUL4B) is a scaffold protein that assembles cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase (E3) complexes. Recent studies have revealed that germ-line mutations in CUL4B can cause mental retardation, short stature, and many other abnormalities in humans. Identifying specific CUL4B substrates will help to better understand the physiological functions of CUL4B. Here, we report the identification of peroxiredoxin III (PrxIII) as a novel substrate of the CUL4B ubiquitin ligase complex. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry showed that PrxIII was among the proteins up-regulated in cells after RNAi-mediated CUL4B depletion. The impaired degradation of PrxIII observed in CUL4B knockdown cells was confirmed by Western blot. We further demonstrated that DDB1 and ROC1 in the DDB1-CUL4B-ROC1 complex are also indispensable for the proteolysis of PrxIII. In addition, the degradation of PrxIII is independent of CUL4A, a cullin family member closely related to CUL4B. In vitro and in vivo ubiquitination assays revealed that CUL4B promoted the polyubiquitination of PrxIII. Furthermore, we observed a significant decrease in cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in CUL4B-silenced cells, which was associated with increased resistance to hypoxia and H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis. These findings are discussed with regard to the known function of PrxIII as a ROS scavenger and the high endogenous ROS levels required for neural stem cell proliferation. Together, our study has identified a specific target substrate of CUL4B ubiquitin ligase that may have significant implications for the pathogenesis observed in patients with mutations in CUL4B.
Atrogin-1/MAFbx is a major atrophy-related E3 ubiquitin ligase that functions as a negative regulator of cardiac hypertrophy. The mRNA expression of atrogin-1 is induced by oxidative stress via p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK). However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the stability of atrogin-1 protein remain unclear.
293T and cardiac H9c2 cells were transfected with plasmids as indicated. The in vivo and in vitro ubiquitination assay and pulse-chase analysis were performed to detect the ubiquitination and stability of atrogin-1. The protein levels were measured by Western blot analysis.
We found that atrogin-1 underwent ubiquitin-mediated degradation by proteasome. The F-box motif of atrogin-1 and Skp1-Cul1-Roc1-F-box (SCF) complex are required for ubiquitination and degradation of atrogin-1. Furthermore, p38 MAPK signaling plays critical roles in regulating the ubiquitination and degradation of atrogin-1 as well as serum starvation-induced expression of atrogin-1 and reduction of H9c2 cell size.
These findings may define a new mechanism for regulating the stability of atrogin-1 partially by p38 MAPK signaling.
The SCF ubiquitin ligase complex consists of four components, Skp1, Cul1, ROC1/Rbx1, and a variable subunit F-box protein, which serves as a receptor for target proteins. The F-box proteins consist of an N-terminal ∼40 amino acid F-box domain that binds to Skp1 and the C-terminal substrate-binding domain. We have reported previously that Fbs1 and Fbs2 are N-linked glycoprotein-specific F-box proteins. In addition, other three F-box proteins, Fbg3, Fbg4, and Fbg5, show high homology to Fbs1 and Fbs2, but their functions remain largely unknown. Here we report that Skp1 assists in correct folding of exogenously expressed F-box proteins. Fbs2 as well as Fbg3, Fbg4, and Fbg5 proteins formed SCF complexes but did not bind to N-glycoproteins when exogenously expressed alone. However, co-expression of Fbs2 and Fbg5 with Skp1 facilitated their binding to glycoproteins that reacted with ConA. Furthermore, Skp1 increased the cellular concentrations of F-box proteins by preventing aggregate formation. These observations suggest that Skp1 plays an important role in stabilizing the conformation of these F-box proteins, which increases their expression levels and substrate-binding.
Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor 1 (Smurf1), an homologous to E6AP C-terminus (HECT)-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, performs a crucial role in the regulation of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling pathway in both embryonic development and bone remodelling. How the stability and activity of Smurf1 are negatively regulated remains largely unclear. Here, we report that F-box and LRR domain-containing protein 15 (FBXL15), an F-box protein of the FBXL family, forms an Skp1-Cullin1-F-box protein-Roc1 (SCF)(FBXL15) ubiquitin ligase complex and targets Smurf1 for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. FBXL15, through its leucine-rich repeat domain, specifically recognizes the large subdomain within the N-lobe of the Smurf1 HECT domain and promotes the ubiquitination of Smurf1 on K355 and K357 within the WW-HECT linker region. In this way, FBXL15 positively regulates BMP signalling in mammalian cells. Knockdown of fbxl15 expression in zebrafish embryos by specific antisense morpholinos causes embryonic dorsalization phenocoping BMP-deficient mutants. Injection of FBXL15 siRNAs into rat bone tissues leads to a significant loss of bone mass and decrease in bone mineral density. Collectively, our results demonstrate that Smurf1 stability is suppressed by SCF(FBXL15)-mediated ubiquitination and that FBXL15 is a key regulator of BMP signalling during embryonic development and adult bone formation.
A decrease in the level of the ROC1 protein, which is involved in cyclin D1 degradation, might explain an increase in cyclin D1 protein in the absence of gene overexpression. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between ROC1 and cyclin D1 expression in skin melanomas. A total of 62 cases of primary skin melanomas and 58 cases of compound melanocytic nevi were assessed. Immunohistochemistry was performed using cyclin D1 and ROC1 antibodies, and fluorescent in situ hybridization was used to assess the amplification of the CCND1 gene. ROC1 was expressed in &gt;50% of cells in 87.9% of the melanocytic nevus cases and in 45.2% of the melanoma cases (p=0.0014). There was a significant negative correlation between ROC1 and cyclin D1 expression in all cases (p=0.0008985). In comparison with cyclin D1, ROC1 expression was increased in 86.2% of the melanocytic nevi and in 45.2% of the melanomas (p&lt;0.001). Among the non-amplified melanomas, 50% expressed cyclin D1 in &gt;50% of the cells and expressed ROC1 in &lt;25%. ROC1 expression is negatively correlated with cyclin D1 expression, demonstrating its importance in the degradation of cyclin D1 in melanomas.
The mammalian Cul4 genes, Cul4A and Cul4B, encode the scaffold components of the cullin-based E3 ubiquitin ligases. The two Cul4 genes are functionally redundant. Recent study indicated that mice expressing a truncated CUL4A that fails to interact with its functional partner ROC1 exhibit no developmental phenotype. We generated a Cul4A-/- strain lacking exons 4-8 that does not express any detectable truncated protein. In this strain, the male mice are infertile and exhibit severe deficiencies in spermatogenesis. The primary spermatocytes are deficient in progression through late prophase I, a time point when expression of the X-linked Cul4B gene is silenced due to meiotic sex chromosome inactivation. Testes of the Cul4A-/- mice exhibit extensive apoptosis. Interestingly, the pachytene spermatocytes exhibit persistent double stranded breaks, suggesting a deficiency in homologous recombination. Also, we find that CUL4A localizes to the double stranded breaks generated in pre-pachytene spermatocytes. The observations identify a novel function of CUL4A in meiotic recombination and demonstrate an essential role of CUL4A in spermatogenesis.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is responsible for chronic and acute infections in humans. Chronic infections are associated with production of fimbriae and the formation of a biofilm. The two-component system Roc1 is named after its role in the regulation of cup genes, which encode components of a machinery allowing assembly of fimbriae. A non-characterized gene cluster, roc2, encodes components homologous to the Roc1 system. We show that cross-regulation occurs between the Roc1 and Roc2 signalling pathways. We demonstrate that the sensors RocS2 and RocS1 converge on the response regulator RocA1 to control cupC gene expression. This control is independent of the response regulator RocA2. Instead, we show that these sensors act via the RocA2 response regulator to repress the mexAB-oprM genes. These genes encode a multidrug efflux pump and are upregulated in the rocA2 mutant, which is less susceptible to antibiotics. It has been reported that in cystic fibrosis lungs, in which P. aeruginosa adopts the biofilm lifestyle, most isolates have an inactive MexAB-OprM pump. The concomitant RocS2-dependent upregulation of cupC genes (biofilm formation) and downregulation of mexAB-oprM genes (antibiotic resistance) is in agreement with this observation. It suggests that the Roc systems may sense the environment in the cystic fibrosis lung.
