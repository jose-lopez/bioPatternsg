<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>	<meta charset="utf-8">	<title>generación de archivo html</title></head><body>The viral G protein-coupled receptor (vGPCR) is proposed to act as one of the predominant mediators of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), a human herpes virus 8 (HHV8)-elicited disease. The actions of vGPCR manifest pathogenesis, in part, through increased permeability of endothelial cells. Endothelial cell-cell junctions have indeed emerged as an instrumental target involved in the vasculature defects observed within the tumor microenvironment. The pathway leading to adherens junction destabilization has been shown to involve the activation of the small GTPase Rac, in the context of either latent infection or the sole expression of vGPCR. However, the precise molecular mechanisms governed by vGPCR in vascular leakage require further elucidation.
Guanine exchange factors (GEFs) function as critical molecular switches that control the activation of small GTPases. We therefore screened the effects of 80 siRNAs targeting GEFs on vGPCR-driven endothelial permeability and identified switch-associated protein 70 (SWAP70) as necessary for its elevating effects. Pull-down experiments further showed that Rac activation by vGPCR was dependent on SWAP70. Examination of tissues and cells from HHV8-positive patients revealed that SWAP70 was ubiquitously expressed. Furthermore, SWAP70 was found to be crucial for vGPCR-driven endothelial tube formation and endothelial sprouting in vitro.
SWAP70 appears to act as a molecular intermediate between vGPCR and endothelial activation. Because of the important role of vGPCR-mediated endothelial plasticity in KS pathogenesis, inhibition of SWAP70 function could be of interest for blocking vGPCR-driven activities in HHV8-defined diseases.
Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms by which cancer cells overcome hypoxia is potentially important for targeted therapy. Complexation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) with aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocators can enhance gene expression and initiate cellular responses to hypoxia. However, multiple molecular mechanisms may be required for cancer cells to adapt to diverse microenvironments. We previously demonstrated that a physical interaction between the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor Sp1 and HIF2 is a major cause of FVII gene activation in poor prognostic ovarian clear cell carcinoma (CCC) cells under hypoxia. Furthermore, it was found that FVII activation is synergistically enhanced when serum-starved cells are cultured under hypoxic conditions. In this study, we investigated whether HIFs and transcription factor Sp1 cooperate to activate multiple genes in CCC cells under conditions of serum starvation and hypoxia (SSH) and then contribute to malignant phenotypes.
To identify genes activated under hypoxic conditions in an Sp1-dependent manner, we first performed cDNA microarray analyses. We further investigated the molecular mechanisms of synergistic gene activations including the associated serum factors by various experiments such as real-time RT-PCR, western blotting and chromatin immunoprecipitation. The study was further extended to animal experiments to investigate how it contributes to CCC progression in vivo.
ICAM1 is one such gene dramatically induced by SSH and is highly induced by SSH and its synergistic activation involves both the mTOR and autonomously activated TNFα-NFκB axes. We identified long chain fatty acids (LCFA) as a major class of lipids that is associated with albumin, a serum factor responsible for synergistic gene activation under SSH. Furthermore, we found that ICAM1 can be induced in vivo to promote tumor growth.
Sp1 and HIFs collaborate to activate genes required for the adaptation of CCC cells to severe microenvironments, such as LCFA starvation and hypoxia. This study highlights the importance of transcriptional regulation under lipid starvation and hypoxia in the promotion of CCC tumor growth.
Autoinflammatory diseases are a genetically heterogeneous group of rheumatologic diseases that are driven by abnormal activation of the innate immune system. Patients present with recurrent episodes of systemic inflammation and a spectrum of organ-specific comorbidities. These diseases are mediated by the overproduction of various inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-18, IL-6, TNFα, and type I interferon. Treatments with biologic agents that inhibit these cytokines have been very efficient in most patients. During the past 2 years, remarkable progress has been made in the identification of disease-associated genes owing mostly to new technologies. Next generation sequencing technologies (NGS) have become instrumental in finding single-gene defects in undiagnosed patients with early onset symptoms. NGS has advanced the field of autoinflammation by identifying disease-causing genes that point to pathways not known to regulate cytokine signaling or inflammation. They include a protein that has a role in differentiation of myeloid cells, a ubiquitously expressed enzyme that catalyzes the addition of the CCA terminus to the 3-prime end of tRNA precursors, and an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of a broad range of substrates. Lastly, newly described mutations have informed a whole new dimension on genotype-phenotype relationships. Mutations in the same gene can give rise to a range of phenotypes with a common inflammatory component. This suggests greater than anticipated contributions by modifying alleles and environmental factors to disease expressivity. 
Gαq, the α-subunit of Gq protein, is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells. It initially attracted attention for its physiological significance in cardiovascular system. In recent years, studies have also indicated the important roles of Gαq in regulating immunity, supplying us a new insight into the mechanism of immune regulation. T helper type 17 (Th17) cells are potent inducers of tissue inflammation. Many studies have shown that Th17 cells are major effector cells in the pathogenesis of many experimental autoimmune diseases and human inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). One of our previous studies has shown that Gαq negatively controls the disease activity of RA. However, how Gαq controls the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease is not clear. Whether this effect is via the regulation of Th17 differentiation is still not known. We aimed to find out the role of Gαq in control of Th17 differentiation. We investigated the relationship between Gαq and Th17 in RA patients. We then investigated the mechanism of how Gαq regulated Th17 differentiation by using Gnaq(-/-) mice. We observed that the expression of Gαq was negatively associated with interleukin-17A expression in RA patients, indicating that Gαq negatively controlled the differentiation of Th17 cells. By using Gnaq(-/-) mice, we demonstrated that Gαq inhibited the differentiation of Th17 cell via regulating the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 to control the expression of STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) and RORα (RAR-related orphan receptor-α). These data suggest the possibility of targeting Gαq to develop a novel therapeutic regimen for autoimmune disease. 
Adenosine is an endogenous purine nucleoside that has a neuromodulatory role in the central nervous system. The amphetamine derivative (±)-3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy) is a synthetic amphetamine analogue used recreationally to obtain an enhanced affiliated emotional response. MDMA is a potent monoaminergic neurotoxin with the potential of damage to brain neurons. The NF-kB family of proteins are ubiquitously expressed and are inducible transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes involved in disparate processes such as immunity and ingrowth, development and cell-death regulation. In this study we investigated the effects of the A2a adenosine receptor (A2a-R) agonist (CGS) and antagonist (SCH) on NF-kB expression after MDMA administration.
Sixty three male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected to MDMA (10 and 20mg/kg) followed by intraperitoneal CGS (0.03 mg/kg) or SCH (0.03mg/kg) injection. The cerebellum were then removed forcresylviolet staining, western blot and RT- PCR analyses. MDMA significantly elevated NF-kB expression. Our results showed that MDMA increased the number of cerebellar dark neurons.
We observed that administration of CGS following MDMA, significantly elevated the NF-kB expression both at mRNA and protein levels. By contrast, administration of the A2a-R antagonist SCH resulted in a decrease in the NF-kB levels.
These results indicated that, co-administration of A2a agonist (CGS) can protect against MDMA neurotoxic effects by increasing NF-kB expression levels; suggesting a potential application for protection against the neurotoxic effects observed in MDMA users.
Female reproductive tract pathologies arise largely from dysregulation of estrogen and progesterone receptor signaling, leading to aberrant cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. The signaling pathways orchestrated by these nuclear receptors are complex, require the participation of many nuclear proteins serving as key binding partners or targets, and involve a range of paracrine and autocrine regulatory circuits. The members of the Krüppel-like factor (KLF) family of transcription factors are ubiquitously expressed in reproductive tissues and have been increasingly implicated as critical co-regulators and integrators of steroid hormone actions. Herein, we explore the involvement of KLF family members in uterine pathology, describe their currently known molecular mechanisms, and discuss their potential as targets for therapeutic intervention.
The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) is a ubiquitously expressed endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident calcium channel. Calcium release mediated by IP3Rs influences many signaling pathways, including those regulating apoptosis. IP3R activity is regulated by protein-protein interactions, including binding to proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressors to regulate cell death. Here we show that the IP3R binds to the tumor suppressor BRCA1. BRCA1 binding directly sensitizes the IP3R to its ligand, IP3. BRCA1 is recruited to the ER during apoptosis in an IP3R-dependent manner, and, in addition, a pool of BRCA1 protein is constitutively associated with the ER under non-apoptotic conditions. This is likely mediated by a novel lipid binding activity of the first BRCA1 C terminus domain of BRCA1. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation by which BRCA1 can act as a proapoptotic protein. 
Genes that regulate osteoclast (OC) development and function in both physiologic and disease conditions remain incompletely understood. Shp2 (the Src homology-2 domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2), a ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic protein tyrosine phosphatase, is implicated in regulating M-CSF and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)-evoked signaling; its role in osteoclastogenesis and bone homeostasis, however, remains unknown. Using a tissue-specific gene knockout approach, we inactivated Shp2 expression in murine OCs. Shp2 mutant mice are phenotypically osteopetrotic, featuring a marked increase of bone volume (BV)/total volume (TV) (+42.8%), trabeculae number (Tb.N) (+84.1%), structure model index (+119%), and a decrease of trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) (-34.1%) and trabecular spacing (Tb.Sp) (-41.0%). Biochemical analyses demonstrate that Shp2 is required for RANKL-induced formation of giant multinucleated OCs by up-regulating the expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1 (Nfatc1), a master transcription factor that is indispensable for terminal OC differentiation. Shp2 deletion, however, has minimal effect on M-CSF-dependent survival and proliferation of OC precursors. Instead, its deficiency aborts the fusion of OC precursors and formation of multinucleated OCs and decreases bone matrix resorption. Moreover, pharmacological intervention of Shp2 is sufficient to prevent preosteoclast fusion in vitro. These findings uncover a novel mechanism through which Shp2 regulates osteoclastogenesis by promoting preosteoclast fusion. Shp2 or its signaling partners could potentially serve as pharmacological targets to regulate the population of OCs locally and/or systematically, and thus treat OC-related diseases, such as periprosthetic osteolysis and osteoporosis.
Thyroid hormone (T3) affects adult metabolism and postembryonic development in vertebrates. T3 functions mainly via binding to its receptors (TRs) to regulate gene expression. There are 2 TR genes, TRα and TRβ, with TRα more ubiquitously expressed. During development, TRα expression appears earlier than T3 synthesis and secretion into the plasma. This and the ability of TRs to regulate gene expression both in the presence and absence of T3 have indicated a role for unliganded TR during vertebrate development. On the other hand, it has been difficult to study the role of unliganded TR during development in mammals because of the difficulty to manipulate the uterus-enclosed, late-stage embryos. Here we use amphibian development as a model to address this question. We have designed transcriptional activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) to mutate the TRα gene in Xenopus tropicalis. We show that knockdown of TRα enhances tadpole growth in premetamorphic tadpoles, in part because of increased growth hormone gene expression. More importantly, the knockdown also accelerates animal development, with the knockdown animals initiating metamorphosis at a younger age and with a smaller body size. On the other hand, such tadpoles are resistant to exogenous T3 treatment and have delayed natural metamorphosis. Thus, our studies not only have directly demonstrated a critical role of endogenous TRα in mediating the metamorphic effect of T3 but also revealed novel functions of unliganded TRα during postembryonic development, that is, regulating both tadpole growth rate and the timing of metamorphosis.
Protein inhibitor of activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (PIAS2) is a member of the PIAS protein family. This protein family modulates the activity of several transcription factors and acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in the sumoylation pathway. To improve understanding of the physiological roles of PIAS2, the current study used a yeast two‑hybrid system to screen mouse stem cell cDNA libraries for proteins that interact with PIAS2. The screening identified an interaction between PIAS2 and ubiquitously expressed transcript (UXT). UXT, also termed androgen receptor trapped clone‑27, is an α‑class prefoldin‑type chaperone that acts as a coregulator for various transcription factors, including nuclear factor‑κB and androgen receptor (AR). A direct interaction between PIAS2 and UXT was confirmed by direct yeast two‑hybrid analysis. In vitro evidence of the association of UXT with PIAS2 was obtained by co‑immunoprecipitation. Colocalization between PIAS2 and UXT was identified in the nucleus and cytoplasm of HEK 293T and human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells. The results of the current study suggested that UXT is a binding protein of PIAS2, and interaction between PIAS2 and UXT may be important for the transcriptional activation of AR.
Vitamin D plays a pivotal role in the regulation of bone metabolism, essentially through its effects on calcium and phosphate absorption. Although major targets of vitamin D action are skeletal system and mineral metabolism, vitamin D receptor is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues. Accumulating evidence suggests a possible involvement of vitamin D in the regulation of blood sugar and blood pressure in addition to its effects on bone and mineral metabolism. 
Accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis is temporally and spatially coordinated by fidelity-monitoring checkpoint systems. Deficiencies in these checkpoint systems can lead to chromosome segregation errors and aneuploidy, and promote tumorigenesis. Here, we report that the TRAF-interacting protein (TRAIP), a ubiquitously expressed nucleolar E3 ubiquitin ligase important for cellular proliferation, is localized close to mitotic chromosomes. Its knockdown in HeLa cells by RNA interference (RNAi) decreased the time of early mitosis progression from nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB) to anaphase onset and increased the percentages of chromosome alignment defects in metaphase and lagging chromosomes in anaphase compared with those of control cells. The decrease in progression time was corrected by the expression of wild-type but not a ubiquitin-ligase-deficient form of TRAIP. TRAIP-depleted cells bypassed taxol-induced mitotic arrest and displayed significantly reduced kinetochore levels of MAD2 (also known as MAD2L1) but not of other spindle checkpoint proteins in the presence of nocodazole. These results imply that TRAIP regulates the spindle assembly checkpoint, MAD2 abundance at kinetochores and the accurate cellular distribution of chromosomes. The TRAIP ubiquitin ligase activity is functionally required for the spindle assembly checkpoint control. 
CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a ubiquitously expressed multifunctional transcription factor characterized by chromatin binding patterns often described as largely invariant. In this context, how CTCF chromatin recruitment and functionalities are used to promote cell type-specific gene expression remains poorly defined. Here, we show that, in addition to constitutively bound CTCF binding sites (CTS), the CTCF cistrome comprises a large proportion of sites showing highly dynamic binding patterns during the course of adipogenesis. Interestingly, dynamic CTCF chromatin binding is positively linked with changes in expression of genes involved in biological functions defining the different stages of adipogenesis. Importantly, a subset of these dynamic CTS are gained at cell type-specific regulatory regions, in line with a requirement for CTCF in transcriptional induction of adipocyte differentiation. This relates to, at least in part, CTCF requirement for transcriptional activation of both the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) and its target genes. Functionally, we show that CTCF interacts with TET methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET) enzymes and promotes adipogenic transcriptional enhancer DNA hydroxymethylation. Our study reveals a dynamic CTCF chromatin binding landscape required for epigenomic remodeling of enhancers and transcriptional activation driving cell differentiation. 
Glucocorticoids are pleiotropic hormones, which are involved in almost every cellular, molecular and physiologic network of the organism, and regulate a broad spectrum of physiologic functions essential for life. The cellular response to glucocorticoids displays profound variability both in magnitude and in specificity of action. Tissue sensitivity to glucocorticoids differs among individuals, within tissues of the same individual and within the same cell. The actions of glucocorticoids are mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor, a ubiquitously expressed intracellular, ligand-dependent transcription factor. Multiple mechanisms, such as pre-receptor ligand metabolism, receptor isoform expression, and receptor-, tissue-, and cell type-specific factors, exist to generate diversity as well as specificity in the response to glucocorticoids. Alterations in the molecular mechanisms of glucocorticoid receptor action impair glucocorticoid signal transduction and alter tissue sensitivity to glucocorticoids. This review summarizes the recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms determining tissue sensitivity to glucocorticoids with particular emphasis on novel mutations and new information on the circadian rhythm and ligand-induced repression of the glucocorticoid receptor. 
In vertebrates, estrogens act on the reproductive system but also affect the functioning of non-reproductive tissues such as the immune system. In teleost fish, effects of estrogens and xenoestrogens have been reported extensively, but the available information on targeted tissues and cells is still scarce. Moreover, a better knowledge of the distinct ER subtypes is required to find out the mechanistic pathways by which estrogen compounds are able to disrupt endogenous estrogen signaling in fish immunity. The present study aimed at characterizing, in male rainbow trout juveniles, multi-tissue gene expression pattern of one isoform of estrogen receptor (ER), ERα1, at the mRNA and protein levels. The mRNA levels for ERα1 were measured in various lymphoid organs by real-time RT-PCR and ERα1 protein level by Western blot. Furthermore, this protein was located by immunohistochemistry in the same organs. The transcripts were ubiquitously expressed, but at a higher level in testis and liver, while the protein was more abundant in testis and skin. Moreover, the ERα1 was detected in endothelial, Kupffer, mucous and chloride cells, hematopoietic tissues, proximal tubule, epithelia of the skin and intestine, in the lamina propria and in the stratum granulosum. This distribution backs the idea that, in male rainbow trout, estrogeno-mimetic compounds could be involved in different immune mechanisms such as inflammatory response, transport of Ig, mucus production, regulation of cellular immunity and development and maturation of lymphoid and myeloid cells. 
The classical notion of a centralized clock that governs circadian rhythmicity has been challenged with the discovery of peripheral oscillators that enable organisms to cope with daily changes in their environment. The present study aimed to identify the molecular clock components in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and to investigate their daily gene expression in fast skeletal muscle. Atlantic cod clock genes were closely related to their orthologs in teleosts and tetrapods. Synteny was conserved to varying degrees in the majority of the 18 clock genes examined. In particular, aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like 2 (arntl2), RAR-related orphan receptor A (rora) and timeless (tim) displayed high degrees of conservation. Expression profiling during the early ontogenesis revealed that some transcripts were maternally transferred, namely arntl2, cryptochrome 1b and 2 (cry1b and cry2), and period 2a and 2b (per2a and per2b). Most clock genes were ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, suggesting the possible existence of multiple peripheral clock systems in Atlantic cod. In particular, they were all detected in fast skeletal muscle, with the exception of neuronal PAS (Per-Arnt-Single-minded) domain-containing protein (npas1) and rora. Rhythmicity analysis revealed 8 clock genes with daily rhythmic expression, namely arntl2, circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (clock), npas2, cry2, cry3 per2a, nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1 (nr1d1), and nr1d2a. Transcript levels of the myogenic genes myogenic factor 5 (myf5) and muscleblind-like 1 (mbnl1) strongly correlated with clock gene expression. This is the first study to unravel the molecular components of peripheral clocks in Atlantic cod. Taken together, our data suggest that the putative clock system in fast skeletal muscle of Atlantic cod has regulatory implications on muscle physiology, particularly in the expression of genes related to myogenesis. 
Secretory clusterin (sCLU)/apolipoprotein J is a multifunctional glycoprotein that is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues. Reduced sCLU in the joints of patients with bone erosive disease is associated with disease activity; however, its exact role has yet to be elucidated. Here, we report that CLU is expressed and secreted during osteoclastogenesis in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) that are treated with receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). CLU-deficient BMMs obtained from CLU(-/-) mice exhibited no significant alterations in OC differentiation in comparison with BMMs obtained from wild-type mice. In contrast, exogenous sCLU treatment significantly inhibited OC formation in both BMMs and OC precursor cultures. The inhibitory effect of sCLU was more prominent in BMMs than OC precursor cultures. Interestingly, treating BMMs with sCLU decreased the proliferative effects elicited by M-CSF and suppressed M-CSF-induced ERK activation of OC precursor cells without causing apoptotic cell death. This study provides the first evidence that sCLU reduces OC formation by inhibiting the actions of M-CSF, thereby suggesting its protective role in bone erosion. 
The orphan receptor TIR8, also known as SIGIRR (Single Immunoglobulin IL-1R-Related molecule), belongs to the IL-1R/TLR (TIR) superfamily and plays an important role in the inflammatory responses. The signaling pathways of the receptors belonging to the TIR family are tightly regulated by both extracellular and intracellular mechanisms. TIR8 does not activate the transcription factors NFkB (nuclear factor kB) and IRF3 (interferon regulatory factor 3), although it negatively modulates the inflammatory responses. It acts as an antagonist for the IL-1 receptor family and triggers a negative pathway of the Toll-like/IL-1 receptor system, crucial for dampening inflammation stimuli in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and in other organs (e.g. lung and kidney). The recent findings of TLRs expression in ovary and embryos of different species (mammals and chickens) are very important for an understanding of reproductive physiology and transovarian pathogen transmission. TIR8 was well characterized in mouse, humans and in other mammalian species, but it is still poorly characterized in the chicken. When TIR8 expression was measured in selected organs of chicken embryos of both broiler and layer types at different time points a unique pattern of expression was observed. Interestingly, TIR8 was detected during the first stages of chicken development (day 1 of incubation), and reached a remarkable level of expression by day 10. We observed this receptor to be ubiquitously expressed in the kidney, GI tract, Bursa of Fabricius, with the highest expression levels in liver and kidney. This pattern was comparable to those observed in post-hatching chickens and in mammals examined to date. No expression differences were observed between the two different chicken breeds (layer- and broiler-type) in the first incubation period (8 days). Whereas in some organs starting from day 10, higher TIR8 expression was observed in broiler-type compared to layer-type. These are the first findings concerning TIR8 expression in developmental stages and therefore they are of comparative value. 
CRABP1 (cellular retinoic acid binding protein 1) belongs to the family of fatty acid binding proteins. Retinoic acid binding is the only known functional activity of this protein. The role of CRABP1 in human carcinogenesis remains poorly understood. Here, for the first time we demonstrated pro-metastatic and pro-tumorigenic activity of CRABP1 in mesenchymal tumors. Further functional analysis revealed that the pro-tumorigenic effect of CRABP1 does not depend on retinoic acid binding activity. These results suggest that CRABP1 could have an alternative intracellular functional activity that contributes to the high malignancy of transformed mesenchymal cells. Microarray analysis detected CRABP1-mediated alterations in the expression of about 100 genes, including those encoding key regulatory proteins. CRABP1 is ubiquitously expressed in monophasic synovial sarcomas, while in biphasic synovial sarcomas it is expressed uniquely by the spindle cells of the aggressive mesenchymal component. High level of CRABP1 expression is associated with lymph node metastasis and poor differentiation/high grade of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs). Presented data suggest CRABP1 as a promising biomarker of pNETs' clinical behavior. Our results give the first evidence of pro-tumorigenic and pro-metastatic activity of CRABP1 in mesenchymal and neuroendocrine tumors. 
Nuclear receptors are a large structural class of transcription factors that act with their co-regulators and repressors to maintain a variety of biological and physiological processes such as metabolism, development and reproduction. They are activated through the binding of small ligands, which can be replaced by drug molecules, making nuclear receptors promising drug targets. Transcriptional regulation of the genes that encode them is central to gaining a deeper understanding of the diversity of their biochemical and biophysical roles and their role in disease and therapy. Even though they share evolutionary history, nuclear receptor genes have fundamentally different expression patterns, ranging from ubiquitously expressed to tissue-specific and spatiotemporally complex. However, current understanding of regulation in nuclear receptor gene family is still nascent.
In this study, we investigate the relationship between long-range regulation of nuclear receptor family and their known functionality. Towards this goal, we identify the nuclear receptor genes that are potential targets based on counts of highly conserved non-coding elements. We validate our results using publicly available expression (RNA-seq) and histone modification (ChIP-seq) data from the ENCODE project. We find that nuclear receptor genes involved in developmental roles show strong evidence of long-range mechanism of transcription regulation with distinct cis-regulatory content they feature clusters of highly conserved non-coding elements distributed in regions spanning several Megabases, long and multiple CpG islands, bivalent promoter marks and statistically significant higher enrichment of enhancer mark around their gene loci. On the other hand nuclear receptor genes that are involved in tissue-specific roles lack these features, having simple transcriptional controls and a greater variety of mechanisms for producing paralogs. We further examine the combinatorial patterns of histone maps associated with dynamic functional elements in order to explore the regulatory landscape of the gene family. The results show that our proposed classification capturing long-range regulation is strongly indicative of the functional roles of the nuclear receptors compared to existing classifications.
We present a new classification for nuclear receptor gene family capturing whether a nuclear receptor is a possible target of long-range regulation or not. We compare our classification to existing structural (mechanism of action) and homology-based classifications. Our results show that understanding long-range regulation of nuclear receptors can provide key insight into their functional roles as well as evolutionary history; and this strongly merits further study.
The principal Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) oncoprotein, latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is strongly associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a prevalent cancer in China. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is important in carcinogenesis, as it is a ubiquitously expressed receptor tyrosine kinase. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a master transcriptional regulator in proliferation and apoptosis. Our previous study demonstrated that the nuclear EGFR could bind to the cyclin D1 promoter directly in the presence of LMP1, and the correlation between EGFR and STAT3 in NPC remains to be further explored. Here, we have shown that the interaction of EGFR and STAT3 increased in the nucleus in the presence of LMP1. LMP1 promoted both EGFR and STAT3 binding to the promoter region of cyclin D1, in turn, enhancing the promoter activity of cyclin D1. Furthermore, we demonstrated that both transcriptional activity and mRNA levels of cyclin D1 were decreased by small molecule interference of EGFR and STAT3 activity. These findings may provide a novel linkage between the EGFR and STAT3 signaling pathways and the activation of cyclin D1 by LMP1 in the carcinogenesis of NPC. 
Nuclear hormone receptors play a major role in many important biological processes. Most nuclear hormone receptors are ubiquitously expressed and regulate processes such as metabolism, circadian function, and development. They function in these processes to maintain homeostasis through modulation of transcriptional gene networks. In this study we evaluate the effectiveness of a nuclear hormone receptor gene to modulate retinal degeneration and restore the integrity of the retina. Currently, there are no effective treatment options for retinal degenerative diseases leading to progressive and irreversible blindness. In this study we demonstrate that the nuclear hormone receptor gene Nr1d1 (Rev-Erbα) rescues Nr2e3-associated retinal degeneration in the rd7 mouse, which lacks a functional Nr2e3 gene. Mutations in human NR2E3 are associated with several retinal degenerations including enhanced S cone syndrome and retinitis pigmentosa. The rd7 mouse, lacking Nr2e3, exhibits an increase in S cones and slow, progressive retinal degeneration. A traditional genetic mapping approach previously identified candidate modifier loci. Here, we demonstrate that in vivo delivery of the candidate modifier gene, Nr1d1 rescues Nr2e3 associated retinal degeneration. We observed clinical, histological, functional, and molecular restoration of the rd7 retina. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the mechanism of rescue at the molecular and functional level is through the re-regulation of key genes within the Nr2e3-directed transcriptional network. Together, these findings reveal the potency of nuclear receptors as modulators of disease and specifically of NR1D1 as a novel therapeutic for retinal degenerations. 
The estrogen receptor (ER) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) are ligand-activated transcription factors involved in estrogen or xenobiotic exposure, whereas the 90-kDa heat shock protein (HSP90), which is a ubiquitously expressed molecular chaperone, is involved in the signal transduction process. Although the interactions between these pathways have been under investigation, the mechanisms are unclear and the potential role of HSP90 in these interactions has not been reported. The results of goldfish primary hepatocytes showed that exposure to PCB77 and 17β-estradiol (E2) alone induced significant protein expression of cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) and vitellogenin (VTG), respectively. On the other hand, the combined exposure to PCB77 and E2 led to the reduction of CYP1A and VTG compared to the single treatments. Although the AhRs and ERs were naturally induced during the co-treatment, the total amount of HSP90 binding to the receptors was not changed. Furthermore, while the HSP90 chaperon activity was blocked by the specific inhibitor (geldanamycin), reciprocal inhibition between AhR and ER pathways was not observed. These findings indicate a potential role of HSP90 where competition between AhR and ER for binding to HSP90 can occur and cause reciprocal inhibition. 
The mammalian ABL1 gene encodes the ubiquitously expressed nonreceptor tyrosine kinase ABL. In response to growth factors, cytokines, cell adhesion, DNA damage, oxidative stress, and other signals, ABL is activated to stimulate cell proliferation or differentiation, survival or death, retraction, or migration. ABL also regulates specialized functions such as antigen receptor signaling in lymphocytes, synapse formation in neurons, and bacterial adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells. Although discovered as the proto-oncogene from which the Abelson leukemia virus derived its Gag-v-Abl oncogene, recent results have linked ABL kinase activation to neuronal degeneration. This body of knowledge on ABL seems confusing because it does not fit the one-gene-one-function paradigm. Without question, ABL capabilities are encoded by its gene sequence and that molecular blueprint designs this kinase to be regulated by subcellular location-dependent interactions with inhibitors and substrate activators. Furthermore, ABL shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm where it binds DNA and actin--two biopolymers with fundamental roles in almost all biological processes. Taken together, the cumulated results from analyses of ABL structure-function, ABL mutant mouse phenotypes, and ABL substrates suggest that this tyrosine kinase does not have its own agenda but that, instead, it has evolved to serve a variety of tissue-specific and context-dependent biological functions.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARα, β/δ, and γ), members of the nuclear receptor transcription factor superfamily, play important roles in the regulation of metabolism, inflammation, and cell differentiation. All three PPAR subtypes are expressed in the cardiovascular system with various expression patterns. Among the three PPAR subtypes, PPARδ is the least studied but has arisen as a potential therapeutic target for cardiovascular and many other diseases. It is known that PPARδ is ubiquitously expressed and abundantly expressed in cardiomyocytes. Accumulated evidence illustrates the role of PPARδ in regulating cardiovascular function and determining pathological progression. In this chapter, we will discuss the current knowledge in the role of PPARδ in the cardiovascular system, the mechanistic insights, and the potential therapeutic utilization for treating cardiovascular disease. 
Prohibitins are members of a highly conserved protein family containing the stomatin/prohibitin/flotillin/HflK/C (SPFH) domain (also known as the prohibitin [PHB] domain) found in unicellular eukaryotes, fungi, plants, animals, and humans. Two highly homologous members of prohibitins expressed in eukaryotes are prohibitin (PHB; B-cell receptor associated protein-32, BAP-32) and prohibitin 2/repressor of estrogen receptor activity (PHB2, REA, BAP-37). Both PHB and REA/PHB2 are ubiquitously expressed and are present in multiple cellular compartments including the mitochondria, nucleus, and the plasma membrane. Multiple functions have been attributed to the mitochondrial and nuclear PHB and PHB2/REA including cellular differentiation, anti-proliferation, and morphogenesis. One of the major functions of the prohibitins are in maintaining the functional integrity of the mitochondria and protecting cells from various stresses. In the present review, we focus on the recent research developments indicating that PHB and PHB2/REA are involved in maintaining cellular survival through the Ras-Raf-MEK-Erk pathway. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which the intracellular signaling pathways utilize prohibitins in governing cellular survival is likely to result in development of therapeutic strategies to overcome various human pathological disorders such as diabetes, obesity, neurological diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer.
The transcriptional corepressors SMRT/NCoR, components of histone deacetylase complexes, interact with nuclear receptors and many other transcription factors. SMRT is a target for the ubiquitously expressed protein kinase CK2, which is known to phosphorylate a wide variety of substrates. Increasing evidence suggests that CK2 plays a regulatory role in many cellular events, particularly, in transcription. However, little is known about the precise mode of action involved. Here, we report the three-dimensional structure of a SMRT/HDAC1-associated repressor protein (SHARP) in complex with phosphorylated SMRT, as determined by solution NMR. Phosphorylation of the CK2 site on SMRT significantly increased affinity for SHARP. We also confirmed the significance of CK2 phosphorylation by reporter assay and propose a mechanism involving the process of phosphorylation acting as a molecular switch. Finally, we propose that the SPOC domain functions as a phosphorylation binding module. 
Segmentation is a critical developmental process that occurs by different mechanisms in diverse taxa. In insects, there are three common modes of embryogenesis-short-, intermediate-, and long-germ development-which differ in the number of segments specified at the blastoderm stage. While genes involved in segmentation have been extensively studied in the long-germ insect Drosophila melanogaster (Dm), it has been found that their expression and function in segmentation in short- and intermediate-germ insects often differ. Drosophila ftz-f1 encodes an orphan nuclear receptor that functions as a maternally expressed pair-rule segmentation gene, responsible for the formation of alternate body segments during Drosophila embryogenesis. Here we investigated the expression and function of ftz-f1 in the short-germ beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Tc). We found that Tc-ftz-f1 is expressed in stripes in Tribolium embryos. These stripes overlap alternate Tc-Engrailed (Tc-En) stripes, indicative of a pair-rule expression pattern. To test whether Tc-ftz-f1 has pair-rule function, we utilized embryonic RNAi, injecting double-stranded RNA corresponding to Tc-ftz-f1 coding or non-coding regions into early Tribolium embryos. Knockdown of Tc-ftz-f1 produced pair-rule segmentation defects, evidenced by loss of expression of alternate En stripes. In addition, a later role for Tc-ftz-f1 in cuticle formation was revealed. These results identify a new pair-rule gene in Tribolium and suggest that its role in segmentation may be shared among holometabolous insects. Interestingly, while Tc-ftz-f1 is expressed in pair-rule stripes, the gene is ubiquitously expressed in Drosophila embryos. Thus, the pair-rule function of ftz-f1 is conserved despite differences in expression patterns of ftz-f1 genes in different lineages. This suggests that ftz-f1 expression changed after the divergence of lineages leading to extant beetles and flies, likely due to differences in cis-regulatory sequences. We propose that the dependence of Dm-Ftz-F1 on interaction with the homeodomain protein Ftz which is expressed in stripes in Drosophila, loosened constraints on Dm-ftz-f1 expression, allowing for ubiquitous expression of this pair-rule gene in Drosophila. 
γ-secretase is a large ubiquitously expressed protease complex composed of four core subunits: presenilin, Aph1, PEN-2, and nicastrin. The function of γ-secretase in the cells is to proteolytically cleave various proteins within their transmembrane domains. Presenilin and Aph1 occur as alternative variants belonging to mutually exclusive γ-secretase complexes and providing the complexes with heterogeneous biochemical and physiological properties. γ-secretase is proposed to have a role in the development and progression of cancer and γ-secretase inhibitors are intensively studied for their probable anti-tumor effects in various types of cancer models. Here, we for the first time determined mRNA expression levels of presenilin-1, presenilin-2, Aph1a, Aph1b, PEN-2, and nicastrin in a set of breast cancer tissue samples (N = 55) by quantitative real-time PCR in order to clarify the clinical significance of the expression of different γ-secretase complex components in breast cancer. We found a high positive correlation between the subunit expression levels implying a common regulation of transcription. Our univariate Kaplan-Meier survival analyses established low expression level of γ-secretase complex as a risk factor for breast cancer specific mortality. The tumors expressing low levels of γ-secretase complex were characterized by high histopathological tumor grade, low or no expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors and consequently high probability to fall into the class of triple negative breast cancer tumors. These results may provide novel tools to further categorize breast cancer tumors, especially the highly aggressive and poorly treatable breast cancer type of triple negative cases, and suggest a significant role for γ-secretase in breast cancer. 
Cortisol is the major endogenous glucocorticoid (GC) both in human and fish, mediated by corticosteroid receptors. Due to the absence of aldosterone production in teleost fish, cortisol is also traditionally accepted to function as mineralocorticoid (MC); but whether it acts through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) or the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) remains a subject of debate. Here, we used loss-of-function and rescue assays to determine whether cortisol affects zebrafish epidermal ionocyte development and function via the GR and/or the MR. GR knockdown morphants displayed a significant decrease in the major ionocytes, namely Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase-rich cells (NaRCs) and H(+)-ATPase-rich cells (HRCs), as well as other cells, including epidermal stem cells (ESCs), keratinocytes, and mucus cells; conversely, cell numbers were unaffected in MR knockdown morphants. In agreement, GR morphants, but not MR morphants, exhibited decreased NaRC-mediated Ca(2+) uptake and HRC-mediated H(+) secretion. Rescue via GR capped mRNA injection or exogenous cortisol incubation normalized the number of epidermal ionocytes in GR morphants. We also provide evidence for GR localization in epidermal cells. At the transcript level, GR mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in gill sections and present in both NaRCs and HRCs, supporting the knockdown and functional assay results in embryo. Altogether, we have provided solid molecular evidence that GR is indeed present on ionocytes, where it mediates the effects of cortisol on ionocyte development and function. Hence, cortisol-GR axis performs the roles of both GC and MC in zebrafish skin and gills.
Growth factor receptor protein binding protein 2 (Grb2) is known to be associated with intracellular growth and proliferation related signaling cascades. Huntingtin (Htt), a ubiquitously expressed protein, when mutated, forms toxic intracellular aggregates - the hallmark of Huntington's disease (HD). We observed an elevated expression of Grb2 in neuronal cells in animal and cell models of HD. Grb2 overexpression was predominantly regulated by the transcription factor Forkhead Box D3 (Foxd3). Exogenous expression of Grb2 also reduced aggregation of mutant Htt in Neuro2A cells. Grb2 is also known to interact with Htt, depending on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation. Grb2- mutant Htt interaction in the contrary, took place in vesicular structures, independent of EGFR activation that eventually merged with autophagosomes and activated the autophagy machinery helping in autophagosome and lysosome fusion. Grb2, with its emerging dual role, holds promise for a survival mechanism for HD. 
Phospholipase C γ2 (PLCγ2) is a critical regulator of innate immune cells and osteoclasts (OCs) during inflammatory arthritis. Both the catalytic domain and the adaptor motifs of PLCγ2 are required for OC formation and function. Due to the high homology between the catalytic domains of PLCγ2 and the ubiquitously expressed PLCγ1, molecules encompassing the adaptor motifs of PLCγ2 were designed to test the hypothesis that uncoupling the adaptor and catalytic functions of PLCγ2 could specifically inhibit osteoclastogenesis and bone erosion. Wild-type (WT) bone marrow macrophages (BMM) that overexpress the tandem Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of PLCγ2 (SH2(N+C)) failed to form mature OCs and resorb bone in vitro. Activation of the receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) signaling pathway, which is critical for OC development, was impaired in cells expressing SH2(N+C). Arrest in OC differentiation was evidenced by a reduction of p38 and Iκ-Bα phosphorylation as well as decreased NFATc1 and c-Fos/c-Jun levels. Consistent with our hypothesis, SH2(N+C) abrogated formation of the RANK-Gab2 complex, which mediates NF-κB and AP-1 activation following RANK ligand (RANKL) stimulation. Furthermore, the ability of SH2(N+C) to prevent inflammatory osteolysis was examined in vivo following RANKL or LPS injections over the calvaria. Both models induced osteolysis in the control group, whereas the SH2(N+C)-treated cohort was largely protected from bone erosion. Collectively, these data indicate that inflammatory osteolysis can be abrogated by treatment with a molecule composed of the tandem SH2 domains of PLCγ2. 
NF-κB is an important regulator of immunity and inflammation, and its activation pathway has been studied extensively. The mechanisms that downregulate the activity of NF-κB have also received a lot of attention, particularly since its activity needs to be terminated to prevent chronic inflammation and subsequent tissue damage. The COMMD family has been identified as a new group of proteins involved in NF-κB termination. All ten COMMD members share the structurally conserved carboxy-terminal motif, the COMM domain, and are ubiquitously expressed. They seem to play distinct and non-redundant roles in various physiological processes, including NF-κB signaling. In this review, we describe the mechanisms and proteins involved in the termination of canonical NF-κB signaling, with a specific focus on the role of the COMMD family in the down-modulation of NF-κB. 
SHP2 is a ubiquitously expressed protein tyrosine phosphatase, deregulation of which is associated with malignant neoplasms and developmental disorders. SHP2 is required for full activation of RAS-Erk signaling in the cytoplasm and is also present in the nucleus, where it promotes Wnt target gene activation through dephosphorylation of parafibromin. SHP2 is distributed both to the cytoplasm and nucleus at low cell density but is excluded from the nucleus at high cell density. Here, we show that SHP2 physically interacts with transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ, targets of the cell-density-sensing Hippo signal. Through the interaction, nonphosphorylated YAP/TAZ promote nuclear translocalization of SHP2, which in turn stimulates TCF/LEF- and TEAD-regulated genes via parafibromin dephosphorylation. Conversely, YAP/TAZ phosphorylated by Hippo signaling sequester SHP2 in the cytoplasm, thereby preventing nuclear accumulation of SHP2. Hence, YAP/TAZ serve as a rheostat for nuclear SHP2 function, which is switched off by the Hippo signal. 
Members of the glucose transporter (GLUT) family of membrane-spanning hexose transporters are subjects of intensive investigation for their potential as modifiable targets to treat or prevent obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Mounting evidence suggests that the ubiquitously expressed class III dual-specificity glucose and fructose transporter, GLUT8, has important metabolic homeostatic functions. We therefore tested the hypothesis that GLUT8 mediates the deleterious metabolic effects of chronic high-fructose diet exposure. Here we demonstrate resistance to high-fructose diet-induced glucose intolerance and dyslipidemia concomitant with enhanced oxygen consumption and thermogenesis in GLUT8-deficient male mice. Independent of diet, significantly lower systolic blood pressure both at baseline and after high-fructose diet feeding was also observed by tail-cuff plethysmography in GLUT8-deficient mice vs wild-type controls. Resistance to fructose-induced metabolic dysregulation occurred in the context of enhanced hepatic peroxisome proliferator antigen receptor-γ (PPARγ) protein abundance, whereas in vivo hepatic adenoviral GLUT8 overexpression suppressed hepatic PPARγ expression. Taken together, these findings suggest that GLUT8 blockade prevents fructose-induced metabolic dysregulation, potentially by enhancing hepatic fatty acid metabolism through PPARγ and its downstream targets. We thus establish GLUT8 as a promising target in the prevention of diet-induced obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus in males. 
Loss and/or inactivation of the VHL (von Hippel-Lindau) tumour suppressor causes various tumours. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified the AR (androgen receptor) co-activator UXT (ubiquitously expressed transcript), as a VHL-interacting protein. GST pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays show that UXT interacts with VHL. In addition, UXT recruits VHL to the nucleus. VHL associates with the DBD (DNA-binding domain) and hinge domains of the AR and induces AR ubiquitination. Moreover, VHL interaction with the AR activates AR transactivation upon DHT (dihydrotestosterone) treatment. VHL knockdown inhibits AR ubiquitination and decreases transcriptional activation of the AR. Our data suggest that the VHL-UXT interaction and VHL-induced ubiquitination of AR regulate transcriptional activation of the AR. 
Interleukin (IL)-15 is a ubiquitously expressed cytokine that in the basal state is mainly localized intracellularly, including the nucleus. Unexpectedly, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) time-dependently induced nuclear export of IL-15Rα and IL15. This process was inhibited by leptomycine B (LMB), a specific inhibitor of nuclear export receptor chromosomal region maintenance 1 (CRM1). In the presence of TNF, LMB co-treatment led to accumulation of both IL-15Rα and IL-15 in the nucleus of HeLa cells, suggesting that CRM1 facilitates nuclear export and that TNF enhances CRM1 activity. Once in the cytoplasm, IL-15 showed partial co-localization with late endosomes but very little with other organelles tested 4 h after TNF treatment. IL-15Rα showed co-localization with both early and late endosomes, and to a lesser extent with endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. This indicates different kinetics and possibly different trafficking routes of IL-15 from its specific receptor. The TNF-induced secretion of IL-15 was attenuated by pretreatment of cells by brefeldin A that inhibits ER-to-Golgi transport, or by use of domain negative ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) that interferes with exocytotic sorting. We conclude that TNF abolishes nuclear localization of IL-15 and IL-15Rα by acting on CRM1, and it facilitates exocytosis of IL-15 with the involvement of ARF6. 
The dynamic trafficking of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) into and out of synapses is crucial for synaptic transmission, plasticity, learning, and memory. The protein interacting with C-kinase 1 (PICK1) directly interacts with GluA2/3 subunits of the AMPARs. Although the role of PICK1 in regulating AMPAR trafficking and multiple forms of synaptic plasticity is known, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. Here, we report a unique interaction between PICK1 and all three members of the protein kinase C and casein kinase II substrate in neurons (PACSIN) family and show that they form a complex with AMPARs. Our results reveal that knockdown of the neuronal-specific protein, PACSIN1, leads to a significant reduction in AMPAR internalization following the activation of NMDA receptors in hippocampal neurons. The interaction between PICK1 and PACSIN1 is regulated by PACSIN1 phosphorylation within the variable region and is required for AMPAR endocytosis. Similarly, the binding of PICK1 to the ubiquitously expressed PACSIN2 is also regulated by the homologous phosphorylation sites within the PACSIN2-variable region. Genetic deletion of PACSIN2, which is highly expressed in Purkinje cells, eliminates cerebellar long-term depression. This deficit can be fully rescued by overexpressing wild-type PACSIN2, but not by a PACSIN2 phosphomimetic mutant, which does not bind PICK1 efficiently. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the interaction of PICK1 and PACSIN is required for the activity-dependent internalization of AMPARs and for the expression of long-term depression in the cerebellum. 
N-Methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are major glutamatergic receptors involved in most excitatory neurotransmission in the brain. The transcriptional regulation of NMDA receptors is not fully understood. Previously, we found that the GluN1 and GluN2B subunits of the NMDA receptor are regulated by nuclear respiratory factors 1 and 2 (NRF-1 and NRF-2). NRF-1 and NRF-2 also regulate all 13 subunits of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), a critical energy-generating enzyme, thereby coupling neuronal activity and energy metabolism at the transcriptional level. Specificity protein (Sp) is a family of transcription factors that bind to GC-rich regions, with Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 all binding to the same cis- motifs. Sp1 and Sp3 are ubiquitously expressed, whereas Sp4 expression is restricted to neurons and testicular cells. Recently, we found that the Sp1 factor regulates all subunits of COX. The goal of the present study was to test our hypothesis that the Sp factors also regulate specific subunits of NMDA receptors, and that they function with NRF-1 and NRF-2 via one of three mechanisms: complementary, concurrent and parallel, or a combination of complementary and concurrent/parallel. By means of multiple approaches we found that Sp4 functionally regulated GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B, but not GluN2C. On the other hand, Sp1 and Sp3 did not regulate these subunits as previously thought. Our data suggest that Sp4 operates in a complementary and concurrent/parallel manner with NRF-1 and NRF-2 to mediate the tight coupling between energy metabolism and neuronal activity at the molecular level. 
Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) are ubiquitously expressed intracellular Ca2+ channels and the major mediators of cellular Ca2+ signals generated by the release of Ca2+ ions from intracellular stores in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli. Despite established physiological significance and proven involvements of IP3R channels in many human diseases, detailed structural basis for signal detection by these ion channels and their gating remain obscure. Recently, single particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) has yielded a long-awaited near-atomic resolution structure of the entire full-length type 1 IP3R. This structure provided exciting mechanistic insights into the molecular assembly of IP3R, revealing the pronounced structural conservation of Ca2+ release channels and raising many fundamental and controversial questions on their activation and gating. Here we summarize the major technological advances that propelled our cryo-EM analysis of IP3R to near-atomic resolution and discuss what the future holds for structural biology of Ca2+ release channels.
High-grade glioma (HGG) is an incurable brain cancer. The transcriptomes of cells within HGG tumors are highly heterogeneous. This renders the tumors unresponsive or able to adapt to therapeutics targeted at single pathways, thereby causing treatment failure. To overcome this, we focused on cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7), a ubiquitously expressed molecule involved in two major drivers of HGG pathogenesis: cell cycle progression and RNA polymerase-II-based transcription. We tested the activity of THZ1, an irreversible CDK7 inhibitor, on patient-derived primary HGG cell lines and ex vivo HGG patient tissue slices, using proliferation assays, microarray analysis, high-resolution respirometry, cell cycle analysis and in vivo tumor orthografts. The cellular processes affected by CDK7 inhibition were analyzed by reverse transcriptase-quantitative PCR, western blot, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. THZ1 perturbed the transcriptome and disabled CDK activation, leading to cell cycle arrest at G2 and DNA damage. THZ1 halted transcription of the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial ribosomal genes, reducing mitochondrial translation and oxidative respiration. It also inhibited the expression of receptor tyrosine kinases such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFR-α), reducing signaling flux through the AKT, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) downstream pathways. Finally, THZ1 disrupted nucleolar, Cajal body and nuclear speckle formation, resulting in reduced cytosolic translation and malfunction of the spliceosome and thus leading to aberrant mRNA processing. These findings indicate that CDK7 is crucial for gliomagenesis, validate CDK7 as a therapeutic target and provide new insight into the cellular processes that are affected by THZ1 and induce antitumor activity.
A hypoxic tumor microenvironment is linked to poor prognosis. It promotes tumor cell dedifferentiation and metastasis and desensitizes tumor cells to type-I IFN, chemotherapy, and irradiation. The cytoplasmic immunoreceptor retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) is ubiquitously expressed in tumor cells and upon activation by 5'-triphosphate RNA (3pRNA) drives the induction of type I IFN and immunogenic cell death. Here, we analyzed the impact of hypoxia on the expression of RIG-I in various human and murine tumor and nonmalignant cell types and further investigated its function in hypoxic murine melanoma. 3pRNA-inducible RIG-I-expression was reduced in hypoxic melanoma cells compared with normoxic controls, a phenomenon that depended on the hypoxia-associated transcription factor HIF1α. Still, RIG-I functionality was conserved in hypoxic melanoma cells, whereas responsiveness to recombinant type-I IFN was abolished, due to hypoxia-induced loss of type I IFN receptor expression. Likewise, RIG-I activation in hypoxic melanoma cells, but not exposure to recombinant IFNα, provoked melanocyte antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell and NK-cell attack. Scavenging of hypoxia-induced reactive oxygen species by vitamin C restored the inducible expression of RIG-I under hypoxia in vitro, boosted in vitro anti-melanoma NK- and CD8+ T-cell attack, and augmented 3pRNA antitumor efficacy in vivo These results demonstrate that RIG-I remains operational under hypoxia and that RIG-I function is largely insensitive to lower cell surface expression of the IFNα receptor. RIG-I function could be fortified under hypoxia by the combined use of 3pRNA with antioxidants. Cancer Immunol Res; 5(6); 455-67. ©2017 AACR.
γ-glutamyl-hydrolase (GGH) is a ubiquitously-expressed enzyme that regulates intracellular folate metabolism for cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, and repair. Employing GGH immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray with 12,427 prostate cancers, we found that GGH expression was negative to low in normal prostate epithelium, whereas 88.3% of our 10,562 interpretable cancers showed GGH expression. GGH staining was considered as low intensity in 49.6% and as high intensity in 38.6% of cancers. High GGH expression was linked to the TMPRSS2:ERG-fusion positive subset of cancers (p &lt; 0.0001), advanced pathological tumor stage, and high Gleason grade (p &lt; 0.0001 each). Further analysis revealed that these associations were merely driven by the subset of ERG-negative cancers, High GGH expression was weakly linked to early biochemical recurrence in ERG negative cancers (p &lt; 0.0001) and independent from established histo-pathological parameters. Moreover, GGH expression was linked to features of genetic instability, including presence of recurrent deletions at 3p, 5q, 6q, and 10q (PTEN, p ≤ 0.01 each), as well as to accelerated cell proliferation as measured by Ki67 immunohistochemistry (p &lt; 0.0001). In conclusion, the results of our study identify GGH as an ERG subtype specific molecular marker with modest prognostic relevance, which may have clinical relevance if analyzed in combination with other molecular markers.
The lysyl oxidase proenzyme propeptide region (LOX-PP) is a tumor suppressor protein whose mechanism of action is not completely understood. Here, the Ubiquitously expressed Transcript (UXT) was identified in a yeast two-hybrid assay with LOX-PP as bait and confirmed as a novel LOX-PP associating protein. UXT, a prefoldin-like protein, is ubiquitous in human and mouse. Since UXT modulates androgen receptor transcriptional activity in prostate cancer, we studied its role in breast cancer. Breast tumors and derived cell lines overexpressed UXT. UXT was able to associate with the estrogen receptor alpha (ER) and decrease its transcriptional activity and target gene expression. Conversely, UXT knockdown increased ER element-dependent transcriptional activity. Ectopic LOX-PP relocalized UXT to the cytoplasm and decreased its stability. UXT ubiquitination and depletion in the presence of LOX-PP was rescued by a proteasomal inhibitor. In summary, proteasome-mediated turnover of UXT upon interaction with LOX-PP releases repression of ER transcriptional activity. J. Cell. Biochem. 118: 2347-2356, 2017. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor (IP3R) is a ubiquitously expressed Ca2+-release channel localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The intracellular Ca2+ signals originating from the activation of the IP3R regulate multiple cellular processes including the control of cell death versus cell survival via their action on apoptosis and autophagy. The exact role of the IP3Rs in these two processes does not only depend on their activity, which is modulated by the cytosolic composition (Ca2+, ATP, redox status, …) and by various types of regulatory proteins, including kinases and phosphatases as well as by a number of oncogenes and tumor suppressors, but also on their intracellular localization, especially at the ER-mitochondrial and ER-lysosomal interfaces. At these interfaces, Ca2+ microdomains are formed, in which the Ca2+ concentration is finely regulated by the different ER, mitochondrial and lysosomal Ca2+-transport systems and also depends on the functional and structural interactions existing between them. In this review, we therefore discuss the most recent insights in the role of Ca2+ signaling in general, and of the IP3R in particular, in the control of basal mitochondrial bioenergetics, apoptosis, and autophagy at the level of inter-organellar contact sites.
Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) are ubiquitously expressed intracellular ligand-gated Ca2+ channels present on the endoplasmic reticulum of virtually all eukaryotic cells. These channels mediate the Ca2+ release from intracellular stores in response to activation by the signaling molecule IP3, which functions to transmit diverse signals received by the cell, e.g. from hormones, neurotransmitters, growth factors and hypertrophic stimuli, to various signaling pathways within the cell. Thus, IP3R channels can be conceptualized as highly dynamic scaffold membrane protein complexes, where binding of ligands can change the scaffold structure leading to cellular Ca2+ signals that direct markedly different cellular actions. Although extensively characterized in physiological and biochemical studies, the detailed mechanisms of how IP3Rs produce highly controlled Ca2+ signals in response to diversified extra- and intracellular stimuli remains unknown and requires high-resolution knowledge of channel molecular architecture. Recently, single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) has yielded a long-awaited near-atomic resolution structure of the entire full-length type 1 IP3R. This structure provides important insights into the molecular underpinnings of ligand-mediated activation and regulation of IP3R. In this chapter, we evaluate available information and research progress on the structure of IP3R channel in an attempt to shed light on its function.
Calcium is a second messenger that regulates almost all cellular functions. In cardiomyocytes, calcium plays an integral role in many functions including muscle contraction, gene expression, and cell death. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) are a family of calcium channels that are ubiquitously expressed in all tissues. In the heart, IP3Rs have been associated with regulation of cardiomyocyte function in response to a variety of neurohormonal agonists, including those implicated in cardiac disease. Notably, IP3R activity is thought to be essential for mediating the hypertrophic response to multiple stimuli including endothelin-1 and angiotensin II. In this review, we will explore the functional implications of IP3R activity in the heart in health and disease.
Schwann cells are the myelinating glia of the peripheral nervous system and dysfunction of these cells causes motor and sensory peripheral neuropathy. The transcription factor SOX10 is critical for Schwann cell development and maintenance, and many SOX10 target genes encode proteins required for Schwann cell function. Loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding myotubularin-related protein 2 (MTMR2) cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4B1 (CMT4B1), a severe demyelinating peripheral neuropathy characterized by myelin outfoldings along peripheral nerves. Previous reports indicate that MTMR2 is ubiquitously expressed making it unclear how loss of this gene causes a Schwann cell-specific phenotype. To address this, we performed computational and functional analyses at MTMR2 to identify transcriptional regulatory elements important for Schwann cell expression. Through these efforts, we identified an alternative, SOX10-responsive promoter at MTMR2 that displays strong regulatory activity in immortalized rat Schwann (S16) cells. This promoter directs transcription of a previously unidentified MTMR2 transcript that is enriched in mouse Schwann cells compared to immortalized mouse motor neurons (MN-1), and is predicted to encode an N-terminally truncated protein isoform. The expression of the endogenous transcript is induced in a heterologous cell line by ectopically expressing SOX10, and is nearly ablated in Schwann cells by impairing SOX10 function. Intriguingly, overexpressing the two MTMR2 protein isoforms in HeLa cells revealed that both localize to nuclear puncta and the shorter isoform displays higher nuclear localization compared to the longer isoform. Combined, our data warrant further investigation of the truncated MTMR2 protein isoform in Schwann cells and in CMT4B1 pathogenesis.
Vitamin D is a versatile signaling molecule with an established role in the regulation of calcium homeostasis and bone health. In recent years the spectrum of vitamin D target organs has expanded and a reproductive role is supported by the presence of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and the vitamin D metabolizing enzymes in the gonads, reproductive tract, and human spermatozoa. Interestingly, expression levels of VDR and the vitamin D inactivating enzyme CYP24A1 in human spermatozoa serve as positive predictive markers of semen quality and are higher expressed in spermatozoa from normal than infertile men. VDR mediates a non-genomic increase in intracellular calcium concentration, sperm motility, and induces the acrosome reaction. Furthermore, functional animal model studies have shown that vitamin D is important for sex steroid production, estrogen signaling, and semen quality. Cross-sectional clinical studies have supported the notion of a positive association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) level and semen quality in both fertile and infertile men. However, it remains to be determined whether this association reflects a causal effect. The VDR is ubiquitously expressed and activated vitamin D is a regulator of insulin, aromatase, and osteocalcin. Hence, it is plausible that the influence of vitamin D on gonadal function may be mediated indirectly through other vitamin D regulated endocrine factors. Recent studies have indicated that vitamin D supplementation may be beneficial for couples in need of assisted reproductive techniques as high serum vitamin D levels were found to be associated with a higher chance of achieving pregnancy. Randomized clinical trials are needed to determine whether systemic changes in vitamin D metabolites can influence semen quality, fertility, and sex steroid production in infertile men. In this review known and possible future implications of vitamin D in human male reproduction function will be discussed.
In vertebrates, estrogens and estrogen mimicking chemicals modulate gene expression mainly through a genomic pathway mediated by the estrogen receptors (ERs). Although the existence of an ER orthologue in the mollusc genome has been known for some time, its role in estrogen signalling has yet to be deciphered. This is largely due to its constitutive (ligand-independent) activation and a limited mechanistic understanding of its regulation. To fill this knowledge gap, we cloned and characterised an ER cDNA (sgER) and the 5'-flanking region of the gene from the Sydney rock oyster Saccostrea glomerata. The sgER cDNA is predicted to encode a 477-amino acid protein that contains a DNA-binding domain (DBD) and a ligand-binding domain (LBD) typically conserved among both vertebrate and invertebrate ERs. A comparison of the sgER LBD sequence with those of other ligand-dependent ERs revealed that the sgER LBD is variable at several conserved residues known to be critical for ligand binding and receptor activation. Ligand binding assays using fluorescent-labelled E2 and purified sgER protein confirmed that sgER is devoid of estrogen binding. In silico analysis of the sgER 5'-flanking sequence indicated the presence of three putative estrogen responsive element (ERE) half-sites and several putative sites for ER-interacting transcription factors, suggesting that the sgER promoter may be autoregulated by its own gene product. sgER mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in adult oyster tissues, with the highest expression found in the ovary. Ovarian expression of sgER mRNA was significantly upregulated following in vitro and in vivo exposure to 17β-estradiol (E2). Notably, the activation of sgER expression by E2 in vitro was abolished by the specific ER antagonist ICI 182, 780. To determine whether sgER expression is epigenetically regulated, the in vivo DNA methylation status of the putative proximal promoter in ovarian tissues was assessed using bisulfite genomic sequencing. The results showed that the promoter is predominantly hypomethylated (with 0-3.3% methylcytosines) regardless of sgER mRNA levels. Overall, our investigations suggest that the estrogen responsiveness of sgER is regulated by a novel ligand-dependent receptor, presumably via a non-genomic pathway(s) of estrogen signalling. 
Transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) is a ubiquitously expressed Mg(2+)-permeable ion channel fused to a C-terminal α-kinase domain. Recently, aldosterone was shown to increase intracellular Mg(2+) levels and alter inflammatory signaling in TRPM7-expressing HEK293 cells. This study was undertaken to assess whether these effects were related to an aldosterone-mediated increase of TRPM7 current and/or plasma membrane localization. Using HEK293 cells stably expressing WT-TRPM7, we found that 18-h application of aldosterone significantly increased TRPM7 current and TRPM7 plasma membrane protein expression by 48% and 34%, respectively. The aldosterone-mediated increase of TRPM7 current was inhibited by eplerenone, a mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) blocker, and GSK-650394, an inhibitor of the serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1). SGK1 blockade also prevented the aldosterone-induced increase of TRPM7 plasma membrane protein. It was further determined that K1648R-TRPM7, the phosphotransferase-inactive TRPM7 mutant, was unresponsive to aldosterone. Therefore, chronic aldosterone treatment increases the plasma membrane expression of TRPM7, which is associated with an increase of TRPM7 current. This process occurs via an MR-dependent, genomic signaling cascade involving SGK1 and a functioning TRPM7 α-kinase domain. We suggest that this mechanism may be of general relevance when interpreting the effects of aldosterone because the MR receptor is found in multiple tissues, and TRPM7 and SGK1 are ubiquitously expressed.
Rett syndrome (RTT; OMIM 312750), a progressive neurological disorder, is caused by mutations in methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2; OMIM 300005), a ubiquitously expressed factor. A genetic suppressor screen designed to identify therapeutic targets surprisingly revealed that downregulation of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway improves neurological phenotypes in Mecp2 mutant mice. Here, we show that MeCP2 plays a direct role in regulating lipid metabolism. Mecp2 deletion in mice results in a host of severe metabolic defects caused by lipid accumulation, including insulin resistance, fatty liver, perturbed energy utilization, and adipose inflammation by macrophage infiltration. We show that MeCP2 regulates lipid homeostasis by anchoring the repressor complex containing NCoR1 and HDAC3 to its lipogenesis targets in hepatocytes. Consistently, we find that liver targeted deletion of Mecp2 causes fatty liver disease and dyslipidemia similar to HDAC3 liver-specific deletion. These findings position MeCP2 as a novel component in metabolic homeostasis. Rett syndrome patients also show signs of peripheral dyslipidemia; thus, together these data suggest that RTT should be classified as a neurological disorder with systemic metabolic components. We previously showed that treatment of Mecp2 mice with statin drugs alleviated motor symptoms and improved health and longevity. Lipid metabolism is a highly treatable target; therefore, our results shed light on new metabolic pathways for treatment of Rett syndrome.
Forkhead box (FOX) proteins constitute an extended family of transcriptional regulators. FOXM1 is ubiquitously expressed in cells undergoing proliferation, and overexpression of FOXM1 is associated with poor prognosis in various malignant tumours. FOXM1 and FOXO3a are often transcriptionally antagonistic. FOXO3a plays a critical tumour-suppressive role in breast cancer. FOXO activity is modulated by its acetylation status, which is regulated by class III histone deacetylases (sirtuins; also known as SIRTs). This study evaluated the role of FOX proteins and their regulators in each molecular subtype of breast cancer. Immunohistochemical expressions of FOXM1, FOXO3a, SIRT1 and SIRT6 were evaluated in tissue microarray blocks containing 688 consecutive breast cancer samples. Mean expression levels were used to categorize tumours according to the expression of each protein (high or low). High expression of FOXM1 was significantly correlated with high SIRT1 and SIRT6 expression, higher histologic grade and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). High expression of nuclear FOXO3a and nuclear SIRT1 was correlated with a lower histologic grade and the hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative subtype. In survival analysis, FOXM1 was an independent adverse prognostic factor for disease-free and overall survival in the hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative subtype but not in the HER2-positive subtype or TNBC. In conclusion, although high FOXM1 expression was noted in the TNBC subtype, it had no prognostic impact in TNBC. However, it had prognostic significance in the hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative subtype.
Transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) is a ubiquitously expressed multifunctional protein, which participates in various biological processes including thymocyte apoptosis. As a result, the transcriptional regulation of the gene is complex and must depend on the cell type. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that in dying thymocytes the expression of Tgm2 is induced by external signals derived from engulfing macrophages, such as retinoids, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and adenosine, the latter triggering the adenylate cyclase signaling pathway. The existence of TGF-β and retinoid responsive elements in the promoter region of Tgm2 has already been reported, but the intergenic regulatory elements participating in the regulation of Tgm2 have not yet been identified. Here we used publicly available results from DNase I hypersensitivity analysis followed by deep sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing against CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), H3K4me3, H3K4me1 and H3K27ac to map a putative regulatory element set for Tgm2 in thymocytes. By measuring eRNA expressions of these putative enhancers in retinoid, rTGF-β or dibutiryl cAMP-exposed thymocytes we determined which of them are functional. By applying ChIP-qPCR against SMAD4, retinoic acid receptor, retinoid X receptor, cAMP response element binding protein, P300 and H3K27ac under the same conditions, we identified two enhancers of Tgm2, which seem to act as integrators of the TGF-β, retinoid and adenylate cyclase signaling pathways in dying thymocytes. Our study describes a novel strategy to identify and characterize the signal-specific functional enhancer set of a gene by integrating genome-wide datasets and measuring the production of enhancer specific RNA molecules.
Many cancers including the late stage ones become drug-resistant and undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). These lead to enhanced invasion, migration, and metastasis toward manifesting its aggressiveness and malignancy. One of the key hallmarks of cancer is its overdependence on glycolysis as its preferred energy metabolism pathway. The strict avoidance of alternate energy pathway gluconeogenesis by cancer cells points to a yet-to-be hoisted role of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) especially in tumor microenvironment, where cells are known to become drug-sensitive through induction of gluconeogenesis. However, since GR is involved in metabolism, anti-inflammatory reactions, immunity besides inducing gluconeogenesis, a greater role of GR in tumor microenvironment is envisaged. We have shown previously that GR, although ubiquitously expressed in all cells; afford to be an effective cytoplasmic target for killing cancer cells selectively. Herein, we report the therapeutic use of a newly developed GR-targeted liposomal concoction (DXE) coformulating a lipophilic drug (ESC8) and an anti-Hsp90 anticancer gene against aggressive tumor models. This induced drug-sensitivity and apoptosis while reversing EMT in tumor cells toward effective retardation of aggressive growth in pancreas and skin tumor models. Additionally, the ESC8-free lipid formulation upon cotreatment with hydrophilic drugs, gemcitabine and doxorubicin, could effectively sensitize and kill pancreatic cancer and melanoma cells, respectively. The formulation-triggered EMT-reversal was GR-dependent. Overall, we found a new strategy for drug sensitization that led to the advent of new GR-targeted anticancer therapeutics.
Unlike the classical gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH1), the second mammalian isoform (GnRH2) is ubiquitously expressed, suggesting a divergent function. Indeed, we demonstrated that GnRH2 governs LH-independent testosterone secretion in porcine testes via interaction with its receptor (GnRHR2) on Leydig cells. Transient transfections with luciferase reporter vectors containing 3009bp of 5' flanking sequence for the porcine Gnrhr2 gene (-3009pGL3) revealed promoter activity in all 15 cell lines examined, including swine testis-derived (ST) cells. Therefore, ST cells were utilized to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation of the porcine Gnrhr2 gene in the testis. Reporter plasmids containing progressive 5' deletions of the Gnrhr2 promoter indicated that the -708/-490 region contained elements critical to promoter activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) with radiolabeled oligonucleotides spanning the -708/-490bp region and ST nuclear extracts, identified specific binding complexes for the -513/-490, -591/-571 and -606/-581bp segments of promoter. Antibody addition to EMSAs indicated that the p65 and p52 subunits of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) comprised the specific complex bound to the oligonucleotide probe for the -513/-490bp promoter region, specificity protein (SP) 1 and 3 bound the -591/-571bp probe and early growth response 1 (EGR1), SP1 and SP3 bound the -606/-581 radiolabeled oligonucleotide. Transient transfections with vectors containing mutations of the NF-κB (-499/-493), SP1/3 (-582/-575) or overlapping EGR1/SP1/3 (-597/-587) binding sites reduced luciferase activity by 26%, 61% and 56%, respectively (P&lt;0.05). Thus, NF-κB, SP1/3 and overlapping EGR1/SP1/3 binding sites are critical to expression of the porcine Gnrhr2 gene in ST cells. 
The male-specific region of chromosome-Y (MSY) contributes to phenotypes outside of testis development and has a high rate of evolution between mammalian species. With a lack of genomic crossover, MSY is one of the few genomic areas under similar variation and evolutionary selection in inbred and outbred animal populations, allowing for an assessment of evolutionary mechanisms to translate between the populations.
Using next-generation sequencing, MSY consomic strains, molecular characterization, and large-scale phenotyping, we present here regions of MSY that contribute to inbred strain phenotypes.
We have shown that (1) MSY of rat has nine autosomal gene transposition events with strain-specific selection; (2) sequence variants in MSY occur with a 1.98-fold higher number of variants than other chromosomes in seven sequenced rat strains; (3) Sry, the most studied MSY gene, has undergone extensive gene duplications, driving ubiquitous expression not seen in human or mouse; (4) the expression profile of Sry in the rat is driven by the insertion of the Sry2 copy into an intron of the ubiquitously expressed Kdm5d gene in antisense orientation, but due to several loss of function mutations in the Sry2 protein, nuclear localization and transcriptional control are decreased; (5) expression of Sry copies other than Sry2 in the rat overlaps with the expression profile for human SRY; (6) gene duplications and sequence variants (P76T) of Sry can be selected for phenotypes such as high blood pressure and androgen receptor signaling within inbred mating; and most importantly, (7) per chromosome size, MSY contributes to higher strain-specific phenotypic variation relative to all other chromosomes, with 53 phenotypes showing both a male to female and consomic cross significance.
The data presented supports a high probability of MSY genetic variation altering a broad range of inbred rat phenotypes.
The ubiquitously expressed aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) induces drug metabolizing enzymes as well as regulators of cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis. Certain AhR ligands promote atherosclerosis, an age-associated vascular disease. Therefore, we investigated the role of AhR in vascular functionality and aging. We report a lower pulse wave velocity in young and old AhR-deficient mice, indicative of enhanced vessel elasticity. Moreover, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) showed increased activity in the aortas of these animals, which was reflected in increased NO production. Ex vivo, AhR activation reduced the migratory capacity of primary human endothelial cells. AhR overexpression as well as treatment with a receptor ligand, impaired eNOS activation and reduced S-NO content. All three are signs of endothelial dysfunction. Furthermore, AhR expression in blood cells of healthy human volunteers positively correlated with vessel stiffness. In the aging model Caenorhabditis elegans, AhR-deficiency resulted in increased mean life span, motility, pharynx pumping and heat shock resistance, suggesting healthier aging. Thus, AhR seems to have a negative impact on vascular and organismal aging. Finally, our data from human subjects suggest that AhR expression levels could serve as an additional, new predictor of vessel aging. 
The protease activity of the paracaspase mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation gene 1 (MALT1) plays an important role in antigen receptor-mediated lymphocyte activation by controlling the activity of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB and is thus essential for the expression of inflammatory target genes. MALT1 is not only present in cells of the hematopoietic lineage, but is ubiquitously expressed. Here we report that stimulation with zymosan or Staphylococcus aureus induced MALT1 protease activity in human primary keratinocytes. Inhibition of the Src family of kinases or novel protein kinase C isoforms as well as silencing of CARMA2 or BCL10 interfered with activation of MALT1 protease. Silencing or inhibition of MALT1 protease strongly decreased the expression of important inflammatory genes such as TNFα, IL-17C, CXCL8 and HBD-2. MALT1-inhibited cells were unable to mount an antimicrobial response upon zymosan stimulation or phorbolester/ionomycin treatment, demonstrating a central role of MALT1 protease activity in keratinocyte immunity and suggesting MALT1 as a potential target in inflammatory skin diseases. 
MTAP is a ubiquitously expressed gene important for adenine and methionine salvage. The gene is located at 9p21, a chromosome region often deleted in breast carcinomas, similar to CDKN2A, a recognized tumor suppressor gene. Several research groups have shown that MTAP acts as a tumor suppressor, and some therapeutic approaches were proposed based on a tumors´ MTAP status. We analyzed MTAP and CDKN2A gene (RT-qPCR) and protein (western-blotting) expression in seven breast cancer cell lines and evaluated their promoter methylation patterns to better characterize the contribution of these genes to breast cancer. Cytotoxicity assays with inhibitors of de novo adenine synthesis (5-FU, AZA and MTX) after MTAP gene knockdown showed an increased sensitivity, mainly to 5-FU. MTAP expression was also evaluated in two groups of samples from breast cancer patients, fresh tumors and paired normal breast tissue, and from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) core breast cancer samples diagnosed as Luminal-A tumors and triple negative breast tumors (TNBC). The difference of MTAP expression between fresh tumors and normal tissues was not statistically significant. However, MTAP expression was significantly higher in Luminal-A breast tumors than in TNBC, suggesting the lack of expression in more aggressive breast tumors and the possibility of using the new approaches based on MTAP status in TNBC. 
Some intriguing clinical observations about the anti-inflammatory effects of angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in cardiovascular patients brought us to study the signalling pathways which lead to angiotensin II (ANG)-induced monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) production in human endothelial cells.
MCP-1 production in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) under treatments with ANG, AT1 and angiotensin type 2 (AT2) receptor blockers and pravastatin was measured by ELISA. The expression of AT1 and AT2 receptors and NADPH oxidase catalytic subunits (NOX 1-5) was analysed at mRNA and protein levels. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation was studied by p65 subunit translocation to the cellular nucleus. Cell viability was tested by the MTT method. Nox4 subcellular distribution was analysed by subcellular protein fractionation and by immunoprecipitation followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry analysis.
ANG-induced MCP-1 production was mediated by AT2 receptor, but not AT1 receptor in HUVECs in culture, which in turn activated NF-κB, promoting p65 subunit translocation to the nucleus. Reactive oxygen species produced by NADPH oxidase participated in this activation, mainly by the Nox4 subunit, ubiquitously expressed in all the compartments of HUVECs. Pravastatin inhibited ANG-induced MCP-1 production.
Our results support that ANG-induced MCP-1 production in HUVECs is mediated by AT2 instead AT1 receptor activation, which in turn activates NF-κB involving reactive oxygen species produced by the NADPH oxidase complex. Statins can also block ANG-induced MCP-1 production, probably by their inhibitory effects on NADPH oxidase activity.
Nuclear receptor binding protein 1 (NRBP1) is a highly conserved protein that is ubiquitously expressed across cell types in humans. NRBP1 has been recently identified as an adaptor protein. It has been suggested that it plays important roles in cellular homeostasis and the pathophysiology of cancer. To determine whether NRBP1 is involved in the pathophysiology of breast cancer, we performed a correlation study between the expression level of NRBP1 and the clinicopathological features in 92 breast cancer patients. A strong correlation was detected between NRBP1 expression and advanced histopathology grades, tumor, node, and metastasis stage, tumor diameter, lymph node involvement, as well as the recurrence of breast cancer in 92 tested patients. The tumor tissues from patients also expressed lower NRBP1 than did adjacent healthy tissues. Furthermore, we overexpressed NRBP1 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines and found NRBP1 upregulation-inhibited cell proliferation by using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Blocking the autocrine Wnt signaling pathway by LGK974 could remove the NRBP1-overexpression-induced inhibition in breast cancer cells. The results of this study suggest that NRBP1 plays a tumor-suppressive role in breast cancer pathophysiology, which likely acts through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. 
The inside of a tumor often contains a hypoxic area caused by a limited supply of molecular oxygen due to aberrant vasculature. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are major transcription factors that are required for cancer cells to adapt to such stress conditions. HIFs, complexed with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator, bind to and activate target genes as enhancers of transcription. In addition to this common mechanism, the induction of the unfolded protein response and mTOR signaling in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress is also known to be involved in the adaptation to hypoxia conditions. Sp1 is a ubiquitously-expressed transcription factor that plays a vital role in the regulation of numerous genes required for normal cell function. In addition to the well-characterized stress response mechanisms described above, increasing experimental evidence suggests that Sp1 and HIFs collaborate to drive gene expression in cancer cells in response to hypoxia, thereby regulating additional adaptive responses to cellular oxygen deficiency. However, these characteristics of Sp1 and their biological merits have not been summarized. In this review, we will discuss the diverse mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by Sp1 and their potential involvement in the adaptive response of cancer cells to hypoxic tumor microenvironments. 
The thiazolidinedione pioglitazone, which is also a PPAR-γ agonist, now is widely used in patients with hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia. NF-κB is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor controlling the expression of numerous genes involved in inflammation. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the activation of PPAR-γ attenuates the cisplatin-induced NF-κB activation in cisplatin nephrotoxicity. The results showed that the PPAR-γ agonist pioglitazone decreased the expression of NF-κB p65 transcription target genes (e.g., IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α) and inhibited histological injury and inflammatory cells infiltration in cisplatin nephrotoxicity. The suppression of NF-κB activity following pioglitazone treatment inhibited the cisplatin-induced IκB-α degredation and NF-κB p65 subunit translocation. Translocation of the NF-κB p65 subunit depends on p65 acetylation, which primarily regulated by SIRT1 or p300. Notably, AMP kinase (AMPK) activation not only decreased the phosphorylation, activation and p65 interaction of p300 but also increased SIRT1 expression, activation and p65 binding, thus leading to a significant reduction in p65 acetylation. Interestingly, the reduction of IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β, the inhibition of histological injury and the inflammatory cells infiltration following pioglitazone treatment in cisplatin nephrotoxicity were attenuated after treatment with the PPAR-γ antagonist GW9662. These results suggest that the PPAR-γ agonist pioglitazone prevents NF-κB activation in cisplatin nephrotoxicity through a reduction in p65 acetylation via the AMPK-SIRT1/p300 pathway. 
Much of what is known about the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) centers on its ability to mediate the deleterious effects of the environmental toxicant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD; dioxin). However, the AhR is both ubiquitously-expressed and evolutionarily-conserved, suggesting that it evolved for purposes beyond strictly mediating responses to man-made environmental toxicants. There is growing evidence that the AhR is required for the maintenance of health, as it is implicated in physiological processes such as xenobiotic metabolism, organ development and immunity. Dysregulation of AhR expression and activity is also associated with a variety of disease states, particularly those at barrier organs such as the skin, gut and lungs. The lungs are particularly vulnerable to inhaled toxicants such as cigarette smoke. However, the role of the AhR in diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-a respiratory illness caused predominately by cigarette smoking-and lung cancer remains largely unexplored. This review will discuss the growing body of literature that provides evidence that the AhR protects the lungs against the damaging effects of cigarette smoke.
The Unconventional prefoldin RPB5 interacting protein (URI), also known as RPB5-Mediating Protein (RMP) has been shown to play several regulatory roles in different cellular compartments including the mitochondria, as a phosphatase binding protein; in the cytoplasm, as a chaperone-like protein; and in the nucleus, as a transcriptional regulator through binding to RPB5 and RNA polymerase II (polII). This chapter focuses on the role URI plays in transcriptional regulation in the prostate cell. In prostate cells, URI is tightly bound to another prefoldin-like protein called UXT, a known androgen receptor (AR) cofactor. Part of a multiprotein complex, URI and UXT act as transcriptional repressors, and URI regulates KAP1 through PP2A phosphatase activity. The discovery of the interaction of URI and UXT with KAP1, AR, and PP2A, as well as the numerous interactions between URI and components of the R2TP/prefoldin-like complex, RPB5, and nuclear proteins involved in DNA damage response, chromatin remodeling and gene transcription, reveal a pleiotropic effect of the URI/UXT complex on nuclear processes. The mechanisms by which URI/UXT affect transcription, chromatin structure and regulation, and genome stability, remain to be elucidated but will be of fundamental importance considering the many processes affected by alterations of URI/UXT and other prefoldins and prefoldin-like proteins.
Nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (Nrf2) is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor that is well known for its role in regulating the cellular redox pathway. Although there is mounting evidence suggesting a critical role for Nrf2 in hematopoietic stem cells and innate leukocytes, little is known about its involvement in T-cell biology. In this study, we identified a novel role for Nrf2 in regulating alloreactive T-cell function during allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). We observed increased expression and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 upon T-cell activation in vitro, especially in CD4+ donor T cells after allo-HCT. Allo-HCT recipients of Nrf2
                        -/-
                     donor T cells had significantly less acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-induced mortality, morbidity, and pathology. This reduction in GVHD was associated with the persistence of Helios+ donor regulatory T cells in the allograft, as well as defective upregulation of the gut-homing receptor LPAM-1 on alloreactive CD8+ T cells. Additionally, Nrf2
                        -/-
                     donor CD8+ T cells demonstrated intact cytotoxicity against allogeneic target cells. Tumor-bearing allo-HCT recipients of Nrf2
                        -/-
                     donor T cells had overall improved survival as a result of preserved graft-versus-tumor activity and reduced GVHD activity. Our findings characterized a previously unrecognized role for Nrf2 in T-cell function, as well as revealed a novel therapeutic target to improve the outcomes of allo-HCT.
High mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) is a ubiquitously expressed non-histone nuclear protein which acts as a danger signal when released from cells. HMGB1, which is associated with inflammation, angiogenesis, and T helper (Th)2 polarization, contributes to the development of various inflammatory diseases and malignancies. However, it remains to be determined whether HMGB1 is involved in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).
To investigate the role of HMGB1 in CTCL.
Serum HMGB1 levels were measured in patients with CTCL and healthy controls using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. HMGB1 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in CTCL and normal skin was examined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Moreover, we analysed correlations between the levels of HMGB1 and other cytokines and chemokines, laboratory data, disease activity, and prognosis.
HMGB1 levels were significantly higher in sera of CTCL patients than those of normal controls and correlated with serum levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor, lactate dehydrogenase, thymus and activation-regulated chemokine, and the number of eosinophils in peripheral blood. Serum HMGB1 levels also reflected disease activity and prognosis for each patient with CTCL. HMGB1 mRNA levels in CTCL lesional skin were significantly elevated and correlated with IL-4, IL-10, IL-19, and angiogenin mRNA levels. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that HMGB1 was expressed not only in the nucleus but also in the cytoplasm of various cells in CTCL lesional skin.
These results suggest that enhanced HMGB1 expression may contribute to the progression of CTCL through Th2 polarization and promotion of angiogenesis.
Aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) is an important transcriptions factor that binds/coactivates drug-metabolizing genes in vertebrates. In this study, we report the cloning and characterization of two ARNT (ARNT-1 and ARNT-2) genes and their mRNA and protein expression in liver tissues of Atlantic croaker after co-exposure to hypoxia and 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB77). The full-length croaker ARNT-1 and ARNT-2 genes encode proteins of 537 and 530 amino acids, respectively, and are highly homologous to ARNT-1 and ARNT-2 genes of other vertebrates. ARNT mRNAs are ubiquitously expressed in all tissues. Hypoxia (dissolved oxygen: 1.7 mg/L) exposure (1-4 weeks) did not affect hepatic ARNTs mRNA levels. Dietary PCB77 treatment (2 and 8 μg/g body weight/day for 4 weeks) caused marked increases in ARNTs mRNA and protein levels in normoxic fish. However, coexposure to hypoxia and PCB77 for 4 weeks significantly blunted the increase in ARNTs mRNA and protein levels in response to PCB77 exposure. These results suggest that ARNT activity and functions induced by exposure to PCB aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonists could be compromised in croaker inhabiting hypoxic coastal regions.
Calcitriol, the bioactive metabolite of vitamin D, interacts with the ubiquitously expressed nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR) to induce genomic effects, but it can also elicit rapid responses via membrane-associated VDR through mechanisms that are poorly understood. The down-regulation of K+ currents is the main origin of electrophysiological remodeling in pathological hypertrophy and heart failure (HF), which can contribute to action potential prolongation and subsequently increase the risk of triggered arrhythmias. Adult mouse ventricular myocytes were isolated and treated with 10 nM calcitriol or vehicle for 15-30 min. In some experiments, cardiomyocytes were pretreated with the Akt inhibitor triciribine. In the adult mouse ventricle, outward K+ currents involved in cardiac repolarization are comprised of three components: the fast transient outward current (Itof), the ultrarapid delayed rectifier K+ current (Ikur), and the non-inactivating steady-state outward current (Iss). K+ currents were investigated using the whole-cell or the perforated patch-clamp technique and normalized to cell capacitance to obtain current densities. Calcitriol treatment of cardiomyocytes induced an increase in the density of Itof and Ikur, which was lost in myocytes isolated from VDR-knockout mice. In addition, calcitriol activated Akt in cardiomyocytes and pretreatment with triciribine prevented the calcitriol-induced increase of outward K+ currents. In conclusion, we demonstrate that calcitriol via VDR and Akt increases both Itof and Ikur densities in mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes. Our findings may provide new mechanistics clues for the cardioprotective role of this hormone in the heart.
The nuclear hormone receptor (NR) superfamily comprises approximately 50 evolutionarily conserved proteins that play major roles in gene regulation by prototypically acting as ligand-dependent transcription factors. Besides their central role in physiology, NRs have been largely used as therapeutic drug targets in many chronic inflammatory conditions and derivatives of their specific ligands, alone or in combination, are frequently prescribed for the treatment of skin diseases. In particular, glucocorticoids (GCs) are the most commonly used compounds for treating prevalent skin diseases such as psoriasis due to their anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory actions. However, and despite their therapeutic efficacy, the long-term use of GCs is limited because of the cutaneous adverse effects including atrophy, delayed wound healing, and increased susceptibility to stress and infections. The GC receptor (GR/NR3C1) and the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR/NR3C2) are members of the NR subclass NR3C that are highly related, both structurally and functionally. While the GR is ubiquitously expressed and is almost exclusively activated by GCs; an MR has a more restricted tissue expression pattern and can bind GCs and the mineralocorticoid aldosterone with similar high affinity. As these receptors share 95% identity in their DNA binding domains; both can recognize the same hormone response elements; theoretically resulting in transcriptional regulation of the same target genes. However, a major mechanism for specific activation of GRs and/or MRs is at the pre-receptor level by modulating the local availability of active GCs. Furthermore, the selective interactions of each receptor with spatio-temporally regulated transcription factors and co-regulators are crucial for the final transcriptional outcome. While there are abundant genome wide studies identifying GR transcriptional targets in a variety of tissue and cell types; including keratinocytes; the data for MR is more limited thus far. Our group and others have studied the role of GRs and MRs in skin development and disease by generating and characterizing mouse and cellular models with gain- and loss-of-function for each receptor. Both NRs are required for skin barrier competence during mouse development and also play a role in adult skin homeostasis. Moreover, the combined loss of epidermal GRs and MRs caused a more severe skin phenotype relative to single knock-outs (KOs) in developing skin and in acute inflammation and psoriasis, indicating that these corticosteroid receptors play cooperative roles. Understanding GR- and MR-mediated signaling in skin should contribute to deciphering their tissue-specific relative roles and ultimately help to improve GC-based therapies.
ORP2 is a ubiquitously expressed OSBP-related protein previously implicated in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-lipid droplet (LD) contacts, triacylglycerol (TG) metabolism, cholesterol transport, adrenocortical steroidogenesis, and actin-dependent cell dynamics. Here, we characterize the role of ORP2 in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism by employing ORP2-knockout (KO) hepatoma cells (HuH7) generated by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. The ORP2-KO and control HuH7 cells were subjected to RNA sequencing, analyses of Akt signaling, carbohydrate and TG metabolism, the extracellular acidification rate, and the lipidome, as well as to transmission electron microscopy. The loss of ORP2 resulted in a marked reduction of active phosphorylated Akt(Ser473) and its target Glycogen synthase kinase 3β(Ser9), consistent with defective Akt signaling. ORP2 was found to form a physical complex with the key controllers of Akt activity, Cdc37, and Hsp90, and to co-localize with Cdc37 and active Akt(Ser473) at lamellipodial plasma membrane regions, in addition to the previously reported ER-LD localization. ORP2-KO reduced glucose uptake, glycogen synthesis, glycolysis, mRNA-encoding glycolytic enzymes, and SREBP-1 target gene expression, and led to defective TG synthesis and storage. ORP2-KO did not reduce but rather increased ER-LD contacts under basal culture conditions and interfered with their expansion upon fatty acid loading. Together with our recently published work (Kentala et al. in FASEB J 32:1281-1295, 2018), this study identifies ORP2 as a new regulatory nexus of Akt signaling, cellular energy metabolism, actin cytoskeletal function, cell migration, and proliferation.
PTPN23 encodes a ubiquitously expressed non-receptor type, catalytically inactive protein-tyrosine phosphatase found in all cells including neurons. Recently, we have identified PTPN23 in a cellular screen for the systematic identification of novel regulators of survival motor neuron (SMN) function in the assembly of splicing factors (Uridine-rich small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, UsnRNPs). Based on three families, recessive PTPN23 variants have been associated with human disease tentatively, without functional studies. Here, we describe a pediatric proband with severe developmental delay, epilepsy, cortical blindness, hypomyelination and brain atrophy on MRI. Whole exome sequencing and family study showed two novel PTPN23 variants, c.1902C&gt;G (p.(Asn634Lys)) and c.2974delC (p.(Leu992Tyrfs*168)), in compound heterozygous state, which are predicted in silico to be damaging. When studying patient's fibroblasts we found similar expression of SMN but a dramatic reduction of cells displaying SMN accumulation in Cajal bodies (CB). SMN strongly accumulated in CB in more than 50% of unrelated control cell fibroblasts as well as in fibroblasts from the parent carrying only the c.2974delC (p.(Leu992Tyrfs*168)) variant (predicted to cause loss-of-function). In contrast, only 22% of cells showed respective SMN accumulations in patient fibroblasts (p = 1.9-2.5 × 10-7) while showing a higher level of nucleoplasmic SMN. Furthermore, the remaining accumulations in patient cells displayed weaker SMN signals than control or heterozygous wt/c.2974delC (p.(Leu992Tyrfs*168)) fibroblasts. Our report provides the first description of the clinical phenotype of recessive PTPN23 variants with pathogenicity substantiated by a functional study.
Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) is an adaptor protein involved in the interleukin-1 receptor and Toll-like receptor-induced activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). In this study a novel isoform of MyD88 in Sepiella japonica (SjMyD88) was cloned and functionally characterized (GenBank accession no. AQY56781.1). The complete cDNA sequence of SjMyD88 was 1912 bp and contained a 1017 bp open reading frame encoding 338 amino acid residues, which was similar to its mollusk orthologues in the length. BLASTp analysis suggested the deduced amino acids sequence of SjMyD88 shared high identity to the known MyD88, for instance, 64% identity with Octopus bimaculoides. Sequence analysis revealed two conserved domains, the N-terminal DD and the C-terminal TIR domain appeared in SjMyD88, which was consistent with MyD88 proteins from other species. The fusion expression of SjMyD88 and green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in HEK293 cells was conducted and cytoplasm localization was detected. Meanwhile, the TIR-pmCherry fusion protein showed red fluorescence and mainly distributed in the cytoplasm. After cotransfection MyD88-EGFP and TIR-pmCherry red obviously overlapped and changed to yellowish green. The results suggested that there was the interaction between homologous TIR-pmcherry and MyD88-EGFP. Tissues expression profiles analysis showed that SjMyD88 ubiquitously expressed in all tested tissues with the highest expression in the gills and livers except reproductive related tissue, and it was significantly induced in livers under LPS stress. These data provide insight into the roles of SjMyD88 in the TLR signaling pathway of S. japonica in response to pathogenic bacteria.
Nuclear receptor binding protein 1 (NRBP1) is a ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved pseudokinase that has important roles in cellular homoeostasis. Despite recent advances in understanding the biology of NRBP1, the role of NRBP1 and its underlying mechanism in colorectal cancer (CRC) have not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we observed that NRBP1 expression levels were significantly reduced in CRC tissues compared with corresponding adjacent normal tissues, and high NRBP1 expression correlated with better prognosis in CRC. Overexpression of NRBP1 inhibited CRC cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, knockdown of NRBP1 expression increased cell proliferation and decreased the percentage of apoptotic cells. Moreover, overexpression of NRBP1 activated caspase-dependent intrinsic apoptosis. In addition, we further discovered that NRBP1 regulated the apoptotic pathway through interaction with JNK. Finally, NRBP1 overexpression led to attenuated CRC growth in a xenograft mouse model. Our study illustrates the suppressor role of NRBP1 in CRC and provides a potential therapeutic target.
Liver X receptor (LXR) α expression is mainly localized to metabolic tissues, such as the liver, whereas LXRβ is ubiquitously expressed. LXRα is activated by oxysterols and plays an important role in the regulation of lipid metabolism in metabolic tissues. In macrophages, LXRs stimulate reverse cholesterol transport and regulate immune responses. Although a high-cholesterol diet induces severe steatohepatitis in LXRα-knockout (KO) mice, the underlying mechanisms linking lipid metabolism and immune responses remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of LXRα in the pathogenesis of steatohepatitis by assessing the effects of a high-fat and high-cholesterol diet (HFCD) on hepatic immune cell proportion and function as well as lipid metabolism in wild-type (WT) and LXRα-KO mice. HFCD feeding induced severe steatohepatitis in LXRα-KO mice compared with WT mice. These mice had higher cholesterol levels in the plasma and the liver and dysregulated expression of LXR target and proinflammatory genes in both whole liver samples and isolated hepatic mononuclear cells. Flow cytometry showed an increase in CD68+CD11b+ Kupffer cells/macrophages and a decrease in invariant natural killer T cells in the liver of HFCD-fed LXRα-KO mice. These mice were more susceptible to lipopolysaccharide-induced liver injury and resistant to inflammatory responses against α-galactosylceramide or concanavalin-A treatment. The findings provide evidence for activation of bone marrow-derived Kupffer cells/macrophages and dysfunction of invariant natural killer T cells in LXRα-KO mouse liver. These findings indicate that LXRα regulates hepatic immune function along with lipid metabolism and protects against the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.
Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-alpha (PPARα) is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear receptor. The role of endogenous PPARα in retinal neuronal homeostasis is unknown. Retinal photoreceptors are the highest energy-consuming cells in the body, requiring abundant energy substrates. PPARα is a known regulator of lipid metabolism, and we hypothesized that it may regulate lipid use for oxidative phosphorylation in energetically demanding retinal neurons.
We found that endogenous PPARα is essential for the maintenance and survival of retinal neurons, with Pparα -/- mice developing retinal degeneration first detected at 8 weeks of age. Using extracellular flux analysis, we identified that PPARα mediates retinal utilization of lipids as an energy substrate, and that ablation of PPARα ultimately results in retinal bioenergetic deficiency and neurodegeneration. This may be due to PPARα regulation of lipid transporters, which facilitate the internalization of fatty acids into cell membranes and mitochondria for oxidation and ATP production.
We identify an endogenous role for PPARα in retinal neuronal survival and lipid metabolism, and furthermore underscore the importance of fatty acid oxidation in photoreceptor survival. We also suggest PPARα as a putative therapeutic target for age-related macular degeneration, which may be due in part to decreased mitochondrial efficiency and subsequent energetic deficits.
Upon infection, the immune system produces inflammatory mediators important for pathogen clearance. However, inflammation can also have deleterious effect on the host and is tightly regulated. Immune system-derived cytokines stimulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, triggering endogenous glucocorticoid production. Through interaction with ubiquitously expressed glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), this steroid hormone has pleiotropic effects on many cell types. Using a genetic mouse model in which the gene encoding the GR is selectively deleted in NKp46+ innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), we demonstrated a major role for the HPA pathway in host resistance to endotoxin-induced septic shock. GR expression in group 1 ILCs is required to limit their IFN-γ production, thereby allowing the development of IL-10-dependent tolerance to endotoxin. These findings suggest that neuroendocrine axes are crucial for tolerization of the innate immune system to microbial endotoxin exposure through direct corticosterone-mediated effects on NKp46-expressing innate cells, revealing a novel strategy of host protection from immunopathology.
Mutations in genes involved in the biosynthesis of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor cause autosomal recessive glycosylation defects, with a wide phenotypic spectrum of intellectual disability, seizures, minor facial dysmorphism, hypotonia, and elevated serum alkaline phosphatase. We now describe consanguineous Bedouin kindred presenting with an autosomal recessive syndrome of intellectual disability and elevated serum alkaline phosphatase. Genome-wide linkage analysis identified 6 possible disease-associated loci. Whole-exome sequencing followed by Sanger sequencing validation identified a single variant in PGAP2 as the disease-causing mutation (C.554G&gt;A; p.185(R&gt;Q)), segregating as expected within the kindred and not found in 150 Bedouin controls. The mutation replaces a highly conserved arginine residue with glutamine within the Frag1 (FGF receptor activating) domain of PGAP2. Interestingly, this mutation is a known dbSNP variant (rs745521288, build 147) with a very low allele frequency (0.00000824 in dbSNP, no homozygotes reported), highlighting the fact that dbSNP variants should not be automatically ruled out as disease-causing mutations. We further showed that PGAP2 is ubiquitously expressed, but in line with the disease phenotype, it is highly transcribed in human brain, skeletal muscle, and liver. Interestingly, a mild phenotype of slightly elevated serum levels of alkaline phosphatase and significant learning disabilities was observed in heterozygous carriers.
PINCH-1 is a ubiquitously expressed protein belonging to the focal adhesion protein group which has a role in cell survival, spreading, adhesion and migration. It has been implicated in pathogenesis of several cancers. In the present study we aimed to investigate the role of this protein in estrogen positive and negative breast cancer subtypes.
PINCH-1 expression was studied in two estrogen positive(T47D and MCF-7) and one estrogen negative cell lines before and after treatment with six drugs (Cyclophosphamide, Celecoxib, Doxorubicin, Paclitaxel, Etoposide and Tamoxifen). Then the protein was knocked down using siRNA against PINCH-1 and change in percentage of apoptotic cells was analysed by flow cytometry.
We observed increased but differential expression of PINCH-1 in the three breast cancer cell lines with a higher expression in estrogen positive cell lines. Knocking down of PINCH-1 led to a significant (p-value&lt;0.05) enhancement in apoptosis in T47D cells in response to 4/6 (cyclophosphamide, celecoxib, paclitaxel, doxorubicin) drugs. Though an increase in apoptosis was observed in MCF-7 cells also, it was not found to be significant.The MDA-MB-231 cells however, did not show significant apoptosis upon PINCH-1 knockdown.
The results suggest that PINCH-1 may be playing an important role in etiopathogenesis of both subtypes breast cancer. However, enhanced apoptosis observed only in estrogen positive and not in estrogen negative cells upon PINCH-1 knockdown point towards participation of some other protein with redundant functions in the later subtype which needs to be investigated.
Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease that often results in diminished exocrine gland function. SS patients also experience systemic disease manifestations, including hypergammaglobulinemia and pulmonary and renal pathoses. MyD88 is a ubiquitously expressed adaptor molecule used by all immune cells that is required for IL-1 receptor (IL-1R), IL-18R, and most TLR signaling. The precise role of MyD88 in SS has not been evaluated, although this adaptor is critical for development of lupus, a related autoimmune disease. This study tested the hypothesis that Myd88-mediated signaling is required for local and systemic SS manifestations. To this end, we generated NOD.B10Sn-H2b /J (NOD.B10) mice that are deficient in Myd88 (NOD.B10 
                        Myd88-/-
                     ). We found that NOD.B10 animals that lack Myd88 show reduced exocrine and extraglandular inflammation. Moreover, these animals are protected from loss of salivary flow. Splenocytes from NOD.B10 
                        Myd88-/-
                     mice did not up-regulate activation markers or secrete IL-6 in response to a Myd88-dependent agonist, although BCR signaling remained intact. Finally, IgM, IgG, and anti-nuclear autoantibodies were reduced in NOD.B10 
                        Myd88-/-
                     mice compared with the parental strain. These data demonstrate that Myd88 is a crucial mediator of local and systemic SS disease manifestations.
Stress, injury, and disease trigger glucocorticoid (GC) elevation. Elevated GCs bind to the ubiquitously expressed glucocorticoid receptor (GR). While GRs are in every cell in the nervous system, the expression level varies, suggesting that diverse cell types react differently to GR activation. Stress/GCs induce structural plasticity in neurons, Schwann cells, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes as well as affect neurotransmission by changing the release and reuptake of glutamate. While general nervous system plasticity is essential for adaptation and learning and memory, stress-induced plasticity is often maladaptive and contributes to neuropsychiatric disorders and neuropathic pain. In this brief review, we describe the evidence that stress/GCs activate GR to promote cell type-specific changes in cellular plasticity throughout the nervous system.
Lipid metabolism dysregulation underlies chronic pathologies such as obesity, diabetes and cancer. Besides their role in structure and energy storage, lipids are also important signalling molecules regulating multiple biological functions. Thus, understanding the precise lipid metabolism enzymatic steps that are altered in some pathological conditions is helpful for designing better treatment strategies. Several monoacylglycerol (MAG) species are only recently being recognized as signalling lipid molecules in different tissues. Recent studies indicated the importance of the ubiquitously expressed serine hydrolase α/β-hydrolase domain 6 (ABHD6), which is a MAG hydrolase, in regulating signalling competent MAG in both central and peripheral tissues. The central and peripheral function of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol, which is a 2-MAG, and its breakdown by both ABHD6 and classical MAG lipase has been well documented. ABHD6 and its substrate MAG appear to be involved in the regulation of various physiological and pathological processes including insulin secretion, adipose browning, food intake, neurotransmission, autoimmune disorders, neurological and metabolic diseases as well as cancer. Diverse cellular targets such as mammalian unc13-1 (Munc13-1), PPARs, GPR119 and CB1/2 receptors, for MAG-mediated signalling processes have been proposed in different cell types. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive summary of the current state of knowledge regarding ABHD6/MAG signalling and its possible therapeutic implications.
Glucocorticoids play a fundamental role in many physiologic functions and contribute substantially to the achievement of homeostasis. These pleiotropic glucocorticoid actions are mediated by a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor, the human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR), which may influence the transcription rate of numerous target genes, interact with other transcription factors, trigger the activation of several kinase pathways or modulate mitochondrial DNA expression. Any genetic defects in the NR3C1gene that encodes the hGR may cause Primary Generalized Glucocorticoid Resistance or Hypersensitivity Syndromes, two rare allostatic endocrinologic conditions characterized by partial impaired tissue sensitivity to glucocorticoids. However, there are patients who present with clinical manifestations suggestive of the above syndromes and do not harbor an inactivating or activating point mutation, insertion or deletion in the NR3C1gene. In these cases, several other factors might influence the glucocorticoid signal transduction. In this review, we discuss the numerous glucocorticoid functions and the multiple hGR isoforms, we present the genomic, nongenomic and mitochondrial glucocorticoid signaling cascade and we summarize the clinical manifestations and pathogenesis of Primary Generalized Glucocorticoid Resistance or Hypersensitivity Syndromes. Finally, we speculate that the next generation sequencing technologies will undoubtedly enable us to gain a deeper understanding of the GR "interactome".
Programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1) expressed in many immune cells is known to trigger T-cell exhaustion but the significance of macrophage-associated PD-1 in relevance to macrophage apoptosis is not known. This study is aimed to delineate whether PD-1 pathway has any role in eliciting macrophage apoptosis and, if so, then how the intra-macrophage parasite, Leishmania donovani modulates PD-1 pathway for protecting its niche. Resting macrophages when treated with H2O2 showed increased PD-1 expression and apoptosis, which was further enhanced on PD-1 agonist treatment. The administration of either PD-1 receptor or PD-1 ligand-blocking antibodies reversed the process thus documenting the involvement of PD-1 in macrophage apoptosis. On the contrary, L. donovani-infected macrophages showed decreased PD-1 expression concurrent with inhibition of apoptosis. The activation of PD-1 pathway was found to negatively regulate the phosphorylation of pro-survival AKT, which was reversed during infection. Infection-induced PD-1 downregulation led to the activation of AKT resulting in phosphorylation and subsequent inhibition of proapoptotic protein BAD. Strong association of SHP2 (a SH2-containing ubiquitously expressed tyrosine-specific protein phosphatase) with PD-1 along with AKT deactivation observed in H2O2-treated macrophages was reversed by L. donovani infection. Kinetic analysis coupled with inhibitor-based approach and knockdown experiments demonstrated that L. donovani infection actively downregulated the PD-1 by deactivating NFATc1 as revealed by its reduced nuclear translocation. The study thus elucidates the detailed mechanism of the role of PD-1 in macrophage apoptosis and its negative modulation by Leishmania for their intracellular survival.
NK3 homeobox 1 (Nkx3.1), a transcription factor expressed in the prostate epithelium, is crucial for maintaining prostate cell fate and suppressing tumor initiation. Nkx3.1 is ubiquitously expressed in luminal cells of hormonally intact prostate but, upon androgen deprivation, exclusively labels a type of luminal stem cells named castration-resistant Nkx3.1-expressing cells (CARNs). During prostate cancer initiation, Nkx3.1 expression is frequently lost in both humans and mouse models. Therefore, investigating how Nkx3.1 expression is regulated in vivo is important for understanding the mechanisms of prostate stem cell specification and cancer initiation. Here, using a transgenic mouse line with destabilized GFP, we identified an 11-kb genomic region 3' of the Nkx3.1 transcription start site to be responsible for alterations in Nkx3.1 expression patterns under various physiological conditions. We found that androgen cell-autonomously activates Nkx3.1 expression through androgen receptor (AR) binding to the 11-kb region in both normal luminal cells and CARNs and discovered new androgen response elements in the Nkx3.1 3' UTR. In contrast, we found that, in Pten-/- prostate tumors, loss of Nkx3.1 expression is mediated at the transcriptional level through the 11-kb region despite functional AR in the nucleus. Importantly, the GFP reporter specifically labeled CARNs in the regressed prostate only in the presence of cell-autonomous AR, supporting a facultative model for CARN specification.
C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) is a ubiquitously expressed stress-inducible transcription factor robustly induced by maladaptive endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stresses in a wide variety of cells. Here, we examined a novel function of Sigma 1 receptor (Sigmar1) in regulating CHOP expression under ER stress in cardiomyocytes. We also defined Sigmar1-dependent activation of the adaptive ER-stress pathway in regulating CHOP expression. We used adenovirus-mediated Sigmar1 overexpression as well as Sigmar1 knockdown by siRNA in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (NRCs); to induce ER stress, cardiomyocytes were treated with tunicamycin. Sigmar1-siRNA knockdown significantly increased the expression of CHOP and significantly induced cellular toxicity by sustained activation of ER stress in cardiomyocytes. Sigmar1 overexpression decreased the expression of CHOP and significantly decreased cellular toxicity in cells. Using biochemical and immunocytochemical experiments, we also defined the specific ER-stress pathway associated with Sigmar1-dependent regulation of CHOP expression and cellular toxicity. We found that Sigmar1 overexpression significantly increased inositol requiring kinase 1α (IRE1α) phosphorylation and increased spliced X-box-binding proteins (XBP1s) expression as well as nuclear localization. In contrast, Sigmar1 knockdown significantly decreased IRE1α phosphorylation and decreased XBP1s expression as well as nuclear transport. Taken together, these results indicate that Sigmar1-dependent activation of IRE1α-XBP1s ER-stress response pathways are associated with inhibition of CHOP expression and suppression of cellular toxicity. Hence, Sigmar1 is an essential component of the adaptive ER-stress response pathways eliciting cellular protection in cardiomyocytes.
Cancer immunotherapy represents a promising treatment approach for malignant gliomas but is hampered by the limited number of ubiquitously expressed tumor antigens and the profoundly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. We identified cluster of differentiation (CD)70 as a novel immunosuppressive ligand and glioma target.
Normal tissues derived from 52 different organs and primary and recurrent low-grade gliomas (LGGs) and glioblastomas (GBMs) were thoroughly evaluated for CD70 gene and protein expression. The association between CD70 and patients' overall survival and its impact on T-cell death was also evaluated. Human and mouse CD70-specific chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) were tested respectively against human primary GBMs and murine glioma lines. The antitumor efficacies of these CARs were also examined in orthotopic xenograft and syngeneic models.
CD70 was not detected in peripheral and brain normal tissues but was constitutively overexpressed by isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type primary LGGs and GBMs in the mesenchymal subgroup and recurrent tumors. CD70 was also associated with poor survival in these subgroups, which may link to its direct involvement in glioma chemokine productions and selective induction of CD8+ T-cell death. To explore the potential for therapeutic targeting of this newly identified immunosuppressive axis in GBM tumors, we demonstrate that both human and mouse CD70-specific CAR T cells recognize primary CD70+ GBM tumors in vitro and mediate the regression of established GBM in xenograft and syngeneic models without illicit effect.
These studies identify a previously uncharacterized and ubiquitously expressed immunosuppressive ligand CD70 in GBMs that also holds potential for serving as a novel CAR target for cancer immunotherapy in gliomas.
Previous reports showed that mutagenesis in nutrient-limiting conditions is dependent on Mfd in Bacillus subtilis. Mfd initiates one type of transcription-coupled repair (TCR); this type of repair is known to target bulky lesions, like those associated with UV exposure. Interestingly, the roles of Mfd in repair of oxidative-promoted DNA damage and regulation of transcription differ. Here, we used a genetic approach to test whether Mfd protected B. subtilis from exposure to two different oxidants.
Wild-type cells survived tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) exposure significantly better than Mfd-deficient cells. This protective effect was independent of UvrA, a component of the canonical TCR/nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. Further, our results suggest that Mfd and MutY, a DNA glycosylase that processes 8-oxoG DNA mismatches, work together to protect cells from lesions generated by oxidative damage. We also tested the role of Mfd in mutagenesis in starved cells exposed to t-BHP. In conditions of oxidative stress, Mfd and MutY may work together in the formation of mutations. Unexpectedly, Mfd increased survival when cells were exposed to the protein oxidant diamide. Under this type of oxidative stress, cells survival was not affected by MutY or UvrA.
These results are significant because they show that Mfd mediates error-prone repair of DNA and protects cells against oxidation of proteins by affecting gene expression; Mfd deficiency resulted in increased gene expression of the OhrR repressor which controls the cellular response to organic peroxide exposure. These observations point to Mfd functioning beyond a DNA repair factor in cells experiencing oxidative stress.
The interchange between different repair mechanisms in human cells has long been a subject of interest. Here, we provide a direct demonstration that the oxidatively generated guanine lesions spiroiminodihydantoin (Sp) and 5-guanidinohydantoin (Gh) embedded in double-stranded DNA are substrates of both base excision repair (BER) and nucleotide excision repair (NER) mechanisms in intact human cells. Site-specifically modified, 32P-internally labeled double-stranded DNA substrates were transfected into fibroblasts or HeLa cells, and the BER and/or NER mono- and dual incision products were quantitatively recovered after 2-8 h incubation periods and lysis of the cells. DNA duplexes bearing single benzo[ a]pyrene-derived guanine adduct were employed as positive controls of NER. The NER activities, but not the BER activities, were abolished in XPA-/- cells, while the BER yields were strongly reduced in NEIL1-/- cells. Co-transfecting different concentrations of analogous DNA sequences bearing the BER substrates 5-hydroxyuracil diminish the BER yields of Sp lesions and enhance the yields of NER products. These results are consistent with a model based on the local availability of BER and NER factors in human cells and their competitive binding to the same Sp or Gh BER/NER substrates.
The fate of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) determines their potential risk in soil, which may be directly affected by abiotic conditions and indirectly through the changes in decomposer communities. In comparison, the indirect effects on the fate remain largely elusive. In this study, the fate of phenanthrene and benzo[a]pyrene and the corresponding bacterial changes were investigated in three contaminated farmland soils using a 14C tracer method and Miseq sequencing. The results showed that most benzo[a]pyrene was consistently extractable with dichloromethane (DCM) after the 60-day incubation (60.4%-78.2%), while phenanthrene was mainly mineralized to CO2 during the 30-day incubation (40.4%-58.7%). Soils from Guangzhou (GZ) showed a different distribution pattern of 14C-PAHs exemplified by low mineralization and disparate bound residue formation. The PAH fate in the Shenyang (SY) and Nanjing (NJ) soils were similar to each other than to that in the GZ soil. The fate in the GZ soil seemed to be linked to the distinct edaphic properties, such as organic matter content, however soil microbial community could have influenced the distribution pattern of PAHs. This potential role of microorganisms was reflected by the unique changes in the copy numbers of Gram positive RHDα gene, and by the distinct shifts in bacterial community composition during the incubation. A quite different shift in bacterial communities was found in the GZ microcosms which may influence PAH mineralization and non-extractable residue (NER) formation.
N‑(6‑Aminohexyl)‑5‑chloro‑1‑naphthalenesulfonamide (W-7), a kind of adjuvant chemotherapy, can bind to calmodulin and inhibit Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated enzyme activities and cell proliferation. Similar to calmodulin, euplotes octocarinatus centrin (EoCen) belongs to EF-hand superfamily of calcium-binding proteins. It is associated with nucleotide excision repair (NER), cell division cycle and ciliogenesis. In the present study, the comparative interaction of W-7 with EoCen was first examined by using various spectroscopic, calorimetric methods and molecular docking. The obtain results recommend that only one W-7 molecule is identified binding to the C-terminal hydrophobic pocket of centrin that normally plays a role in anchoring targets. Methyl groups of Ala126, Met141, Ile161 and M162 of C-terminal may react with W-7 chloronaphthalene ring, other aliphatic or aromatic side-chains in a deep hydrophobic pocket of protein. Circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence lifetime experiments reveal that W-7 triggers a conformational change of centrin. As a result, W-7 is identified to be an antagonist of centrin. It appears to inhibit the centrin-mediated activation of target proteins by blocking the hydrophobic pocket. Moreover, the complex formation leads to affinity decrease of Tb3+ binding to C-terminal of protein and self-assembly affected. Our present study provides the first view of centrin recognizing a naphthalene-sulfonamide derivative. It is proposed that W-7 and its analogues can serve as a useful tool for research on the participation of centrin in biological processes and cell biology-related studies.
XPF endonuclease is one of the most important DNA repair proteins. Encoded by XPF/ERCC4, XPF provides the enzymatic activity of XPF-ERCC1 heterodimer, an endonuclease that incises at the 5' side of various DNA lesions. XPF is essential for nucleotide excision repair (NER) and interstrand crosslink repair (ICLR). XPF/ERCC4 mutations are associated with several human diseases: Xeroderma Pigmentosum (XP), Segmental Progeria (XFE), Fanconi Anemia (FA), Cockayne Syndrome (CS), and XP/CS combined disease (XPCSCD). Most affected individuals are compound heterozygotes for XPF/ERCC4 mutations complicating the identification of genotype/phenotype correlations. We report a detailed overview of NER and ICLR functional studies in human XPF-KO (knock-out) isogenic cells expressing six disease-specific pathogenic XPF amino acid substitution mutations. Ultraviolet (UV) sensitivity and unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assays provide the most reliable information to discern mutations associated with ICLR impairment from mutations related to NER deficiency, whereas recovery of RNA synthesis (RRS) assays results hint to a possible role of XPF in resolving R-loops. Our functional studies demonstrate that a defined cellular phenotype cannot be easily correlated to each XPF mutation. Substituted positions along XPF sequences are not predictive of cellular phenotype nor reflect a particular disease. Therefore, in addition to mutation type, allelic interactions, protein stability and intracellular distribution of mutant proteins may also contribute to alter DNA repair pathways balance leading to clinically distinct disorders.
Identifying occurrences of medication side effects and adverse drug events (ADEs) is an important and challenging task because they are frequently only mentioned in clinical narrative and are not formally reported.
We developed a natural language processing (NLP) system that aims to identify mentions of symptoms and drugs in clinical notes and label the relationship between the mentions as indications or ADEs. The system leverages an existing word embeddings model with induced word clusters for dimensionality reduction. It employs a conditional random field (CRF) model for named entity recognition (NER) and a random forest model for relation extraction (RE).
Final performance of each model was evaluated separately and then combined on a manually annotated evaluation set. The micro-averaged F1 score was 80.9% for NER, 88.1% for RE, and 61.2% for the integrated systems. Outputs from our systems were submitted to the NLP Challenges for Detecting Medication and Adverse Drug Events from Electronic Health Records (MADE 1.0) competition (Yu et al. in http://bio-nlp.org/index.php/projects/39-nlp-challenges , 2018). System performance was evaluated in three tasks (NER, RE, and complete system) with multiple teams submitting output from their systems for each task. Our RE system placed first in Task 2 of the challenge and our integrated system achieved third place in Task 3.
Adding to the growing number of publications that utilize NLP to detect occurrences of ADEs, our study illustrates the benefits of employing innovative feature engineering.
This work describes the Medication and Adverse Drug Events from Electronic Health Records (MADE 1.0) corpus and provides an overview of the MADE 1.0 2018 challenge for extracting medication, indication, and adverse drug events (ADEs) from electronic health record (EHR) notes.
The goal of MADE is to provide a set of common evaluation tasks to assess the state of the art for natural language processing (NLP) systems applied to EHRs supporting drug safety surveillance and pharmacovigilance. We also provide benchmarks on the MADE dataset using the system submissions received in the MADE 2018 challenge.
The MADE 1.0 challenge has released an expert-annotated cohort of medication and ADE information comprising 1089 fully de-identified longitudinal EHR notes from 21 randomly selected patients with cancer at the University of Massachusetts Memorial Hospital. Using this cohort as a benchmark, the MADE 1.0 challenge designed three shared NLP tasks. The named entity recognition (NER) task identifies medications and their attributes (dosage, route, duration, and frequency), indications, ADEs, and severity. The relation identification (RI) task identifies relations between the named entities: medication-indication, medication-ADE, and attribute relations. The third shared task (NER-RI) evaluates NLP models that perform the NER and RI tasks jointly. In total, 11 teams from four countries participated in at least one of the three shared tasks, and 41 system submissions were received in total.
The best systems F1 scores for NER, RI, and NER-RI were 0.82, 0.86, and 0.61, respectively. Ensemble classifiers using the team submissions improved the performance further, with an F1 score of 0.85, 0.87, and 0.66 for the three tasks, respectively.
MADE results show that recent progress in NLP has led to remarkable improvements in NER and RI tasks for the clinical domain. However, some room for improvement remains, particularly in the NER-RI task.
Chemical and biomedical named entity recognition (NER) is an essential preprocessing task in natural language processing. The identification and extraction of named entities from scientific articles is also attracting increasing interest in many scientific disciplines. Locating chemical named entities in the literature is an essential step in chemical text mining pipelines for identifying chemical mentions, their properties, and relations as discussed in the literature. In this work, we describe an approach to the BioCreative V.5 challenge regarding the recognition and classification of chemical named entities. For this purpose, we transform the task of NER into a sequence labeling problem. We present a series of sequence labeling systems that we used, adapted and optimized in our experiments for solving this task. To this end, we experiment with hyperparameter optimization. Finally, we present LSTMVoter, a two-stage application of recurrent neural networks that integrates the optimized sequence labelers from our study into a single ensemble classifier.
We introduce LSTMVoter, a bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) tagger that utilizes a conditional random field layer in conjunction with attention-based feature modeling. Our approach explores information about features that is modeled by means of an attention mechanism. LSTMVoter outperforms each extractor integrated by it in a series of experiments. On the BioCreative IV chemical compound and drug name recognition (CHEMDNER) corpus, LSTMVoter achieves an F1-score of 90.04%; on the BioCreative V.5 chemical entity mention in patents corpus, it achieves an F1-score of 89.01%.
Data and code are available at https://github.com/texttechnologylab/LSTMVoter .
Xeroderma pigmentosum, complementation group C (XPC) is an accessory recognition gene involved in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, which is activated during the initial DNA damage recognition stage. It participates in the regulation of DNA damage‑induced proliferation and apoptosis. Emerging evidence demonstrates that upregulation of XPC increases the resistance of several tumor cell types to cytotoxic drugs. In addition, it can predict poor patient outcome for non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the mechanisms linking upregulation of XPC and drug resistance in lung cancer are still unclear. In the present study, we aimed to confirm whether XPC was involved in the reversal of the cisplatin (DDP) resistance in drug‑resistant A549/DDP lung adenocarcinoma cells. RT‑PCR and western blot assays were used to examine XPC mRNA and protein expression levels. Cell viability was assessed by CCK‑8 assay. The knockdown of XPC was achieved in A549/DDP cells using si‑RNA, whereas cell proliferation and apoptosis were assessed by wound healing assay and ﬂow cytometric analysis, respectively. The median inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of DDP was assessed by CCK‑8 assay. Western blot assays were conducted for the examination of caspase‑9/3, Bax and Bcl‑2 protein levels, whereas the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway was investigated in XPC‑knockdown cells. High expression of XPC was noted in A549/DDP cells compared with that in A549 cells, which was associated with DDP resistance. XPC silencing significantly inhibited A549/DDP cell proliferation and increased the induction of apoptosis. In addition, XPC knockdown decreased the expression levels of the Akt/mTOR signaling proteins and the expression of their downstream mediator. The data of the present study revealed that XPC inhibition rescued DDP resistance in lung adenocarcinoma cells, which was dependent on the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Collectively, XPC may be considered a new strategy for curing DDP‑resistant lung cancer and may improve the efficacy of conventional chemotherapy.
The aim of this study was to investigate the variation of the salivary microbiota in the recurrence of early childhood caries (ECC), and to explore and verify the potential microbial indicators of ECC recurrence. Saliva samples from kindergarten children were tracked every 6 months for 1 year. Finally, in total 28 children and 84 samples were placed on the analysis phase: 7 children with ECC recurrence made up the ECC-recurrence (ER) group, 6 children without ECC recurrence constituted the non-ECC-recurrence (NER) group, and 15 children who kept ECC-free were set as the ECC-free (EF) group. DNA amplicons of the V3-V4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S rDNA were generated and sequencing was performed using Illumina MiSeq PE250 platform. No statistically significant differences of the Shannon indices were found in both cross-sectional and longitudinal comparisons. Furthermore, both principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) and heatmap plots demonstrated that the salivary microbial community structure might have potentiality to predict ECC recurrence at an early phase. The relative abundance of Fusobacterium, Prevotella, Leptotrichia, and Capnocytophaga differed significantly between the ER and NER groups at baseline. The values of area under the curve (AUC) of the four genera and their combined synthesis in the prediction for ECC recurrence were 0.857, 0.833, 0.786, 0.833, and 0.952, respectively. The relative abundance of Fusobacterium, Prevotella, Leptotrichia, and Capnocytophaga and their combination showed satisfactory accuracy in the prediction for ECC recurrence, indicating that salivary microbiome had predictive potentiality for recurrence of this disease. These findings might facilitate more effective strategy to be taken in the management of the recurrence of ECC.

All chemicals form non-extractable residues (NER) to various extents in environmental media like soil, sediment, plants and animals. NER can be quantified in environmental fate studies using isotope-labeled (such as 14C or 13C) tracer compounds. Previous NER definitions have led to a mismatch of legislation and state of knowledge in research: the residues are assumed to be either irreversibly bound degradation products or at least parts of these residues can be released. In the latter assumption, soils and sediments are a long-term source of slowly released residues. We here present a conceptual experimental and modeling approach to characterize non-extractable residues and provide guidance how they should be considered in the persistence assessment of chemicals and pesticides. Three types of NER can be experimentally discriminated: sequestered and entrapped residues (type I), containing either the parent substance or xenobiotic transformation products or both and having the potential to be released, which has indeed been observed. Type II NER are residues that are covalently bound to organic matter in soils or sediments or to biological tissue in organisms and that are considered being strongly bound with very low remobilization rates like that of humic matter degradation rates. Type III NER comprises biogenic NER (bioNER) after degradation of the xenobiotic chemical and anabolic formation of natural biomolecules like amino acids and phospholipids, and other biomass compounds. We developed the microbial turnover to biomass (MTB) model to predict the formation of bioNER based on the structural properties of chemicals. Further, we proposed an extraction sequence to obtain a matrix containing only NER. Finally, we summarized experimental methods to distinguish the three NER types. Type I NER and type II NER should be considered as potentially remobilizable residues in persistence assessment but the probability of type II release is much lower than that of type I NER, i.e., type II NER in soil are "operationally spoken" irreversibly bound and can be released only in minute amounts and at very slow rates, if at all. The potential of remobilization can be evaluated by chemical, physical and biological methods. BioNER are of no environmental concern and, therefore, can be assessed as such in persistence assessment. The general concept presented is to consider the total amount of NER minus potential bioNER as the amount of xenoNER, type I + II. If a clear differentiation of type I and type II is possible, for the calculation of half-life type I NER are considered as not degraded parent substance or transformation product(s). On the contrary, type II NER may generally be considered as (at least temporarily) removed. Providing proof for type II NER is the most critical issue in NER assessment and requires additional research. If no characterization and additional information on NER are available, it is recommended to assess the total amount as potentially remobilizable. We propose our unified approach of NER characterization and evaluation to be implemented into the persistence and environmental hazard assessment strategies for REACH chemicals and biocides, human and veterinary pharmaceuticals, and pesticides, irrespective of the different regulatory frameworks.
It has been a great challenge to measure the spectrum of pure bound-electronic third-order nonlinear refraction ( n2) of organic chromophores in solutions because of the spurious contribution from the solvent and cuvette walls. In order to circumvent this problem, we present here a new method to obtain a highly accurate absolute n2 value of organic molecules in solutions with a self-referenced nonlinear ellipse rotation (NER) technique. As a proof of concept, we measured n2 spectra of two well-known chromophores, rhodamines B and 6G dissolved in methanol, in the range from ∼600 to 1200 nm. Our results pointed out that these two dyes present similar dispersion curves with strong negative nonlinearities near the one-photon absorption band and small positive values at long wavelengths. Furthermore, the negative signal of the dyes can be strong enough to cancel and even invert the positive nonlinear refraction of the solvent (methanol) as the solution's concentration increases. To understand the n2 spectrum and its connection to molecular properties of organic chromophores, we employed the sum-over-states (SOS) approach within the few-energy-level model and observed an excellent agreement between the experimental and theoretical spectra. In this way, we believe that, employing our NER technique and the SOS model, it is possible to determine both experimentally and theoretically the absolute magnitude and spectra of pure electronic n2 for a large variety of other organic molecules.
The nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway plays a major role in the repair of DNA damaged by exogenous agents, such as chemotherapeutic and radiotherapeutic agents. Thus, we investigated the association between key potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the NER pathway and clinical outcomes in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Thirteen SNPs in five key NER genes were genotyped in 319 male OSCC patients using iPLEX MassARRAY. Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan⁻Meier survival curves were used to estimate the risk of death or recurrence. Carriers of the XPC rs2228000 TT genotype showed a borderline significant increased risk of poor overall survival under the recessive model (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.99⁻3.29). The CC genotypes of ERCC5 rs17655 (HR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.03⁻2.29) and ERCC1 rs735482 (HR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.06⁻2.58) were associated with an increased risk of worse disease-free survival under the recessive model. In addition, participants carrying both the CC genotypes of ERCC5 rs17655 and ERCC1 rs735482 exhibited an enhanced susceptibility for recurrence (HR = 2.60, 95% CI = 1.11⁻6.09). However, no statistically significant interaction was observed between them. Our findings reveal that the ERCC5 rs17655 CC and ERCC1 rs735482 CC genotypes were associated with an increased risk of recurrence in male patients with OSCC treated with CCRT. Therefore, CCRT may not be beneficial, and alternative treatments are required for such patients.
Nonextractable residues (NER) are pollutants incorporated into the matrix of natural solid matter via different binding mechanisms. They can become bioavailable or remobilize during physical-chemical changes of the surrounding conditions and should thus not be neglected in environmental risk assessment. Sediments, soils, and groundwater sludge contaminated with DDXs (DDT, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane; and its metabolites) were treated with solvent extraction, sequential chemical degradation, and thermochemolysis to study the fate of NER-DDX along different environmental aquatic-terrestrial pathways. The results showed that DDT and its first degradation products, DDD (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane) and DDE (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene), were dominant in the free extractable fraction, whereas DDM (dichlorodiphenylmethane), DBP (dichlorobenzophenone), and DDA (dichlorodiphenylacetic acid) were observed primarily after chemical degradation. The detection of DDA, DDMUBr (bis( p-chlorophenyl)-bromoethylene), DDPU (bis( p-chlorophenyl)-propene) and DDPS (bis( p-chlorophenyl)-propane) after chemical treatments evidenced the covalent bindings between these DDXs and the organic matrix. The identified NER-DDXs were categorized into three groups according to the three-step degradation process of DDT. Their distribution along the different pathways demonstrated significant specificity. Based on the obtained results, a conceptual model of the fate of NER-DDXs on their different environmental aquatic-terrestrial pathways is proposed. This model provides basic knowledge for risk assessment and remediation of both extractable and nonextractable DDT-related contaminations.
Early detection of adverse drug events (ADEs) from electronic health records is an important, challenging task to support pharmacovigilance and drug safety surveillance. A well-known challenge to use clinical text for detection of ADEs is that much of the detailed information is documented in a narrative manner. Clinical natural language processing (NLP) is the key technology to extract information from unstructured clinical text.
We present a machine learning-based clinical NLP system-MADEx-for detecting medications, ADEs, and their relations from clinical notes.
We developed a recurrent neural network (RNN) model using a long short-term memory (LSTM) strategy for clinical name entity recognition (NER) and compared it with baseline conditional random fields (CRFs). We also developed a modified training strategy for the RNN, which outperformed the widely used early stop strategy. For relation extraction, we compared support vector machines (SVMs) and random forests on single-sentence relations and cross-sentence relations. In addition, we developed an integrated pipeline to extract entities and relations together by combining RNNs and SVMs.
MADEx achieved the top-three best performances (F1 score of 0.8233) for clinical NER in the 2018 Medication and Adverse Drug Events (MADE1.0) challenge. The post-challenge evaluation showed that the relation extraction module and integrated pipeline (identify entity and relation together) of MADEx are comparable with the best systems developed in this challenge.
This study demonstrated the efficiency of deep learning methods for automatic extraction of medications, ADEs, and their relations from clinical text to support pharmacovigilance and drug safety surveillance.
Electronic Medical Record (EMR) comprises patients' medical information gathered by medical stuff for providing better health care. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a sub-field of information extraction aimed at identifying specific entity terms such as disease, test, symptom, genes etc. NER can be a relief for healthcare providers and medical specialists to extract useful information automatically and avoid unnecessary and unrelated information in EMR. However, limited resources of available EMR pose a great challenge for mining entity terms. Therefore, a multitask bi-directional RNN model is proposed here as a potential solution of data augmentation to enhance NER performance with limited data.
A multitask bi-directional RNN model is proposed for extracting entity terms from Chinese EMR. The proposed model can be divided into a shared layer and a task specific layer. Firstly, vector representation of each word is obtained as a concatenation of word embedding and character embedding. Then Bi-directional RNN is used to extract context information from sentence. After that, all these layers are shared by two different task layers, namely the parts-of-speech tagging task layer and the named entity recognition task layer. These two tasks layers are trained alternatively so that the knowledge learned from named entity recognition task can be enhanced by the knowledge gained from parts-of-speech tagging task.
The performance of our proposed model has been evaluated in terms of micro average F-score, macro average F-score and accuracy. It is observed that the proposed model outperforms the baseline model in all cases. For instance, experimental results conducted on the discharge summaries show that the micro average F-score and the macro average F-score are improved by 2.41% point and 4.16% point, respectively, and the overall accuracy is improved by 5.66% point.
In this paper, a novel multitask bi-directional RNN model is proposed for improving the performance of named entity recognition in EMR. Evaluation results using real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.
Sequencing of whole cancer genomes has revealed an abundance of recurrent mutations in gene-regulatory promoter regions, in particular in melanoma where strong mutation hotspots are observed adjacent to ETS-family transcription factor (TF) binding sites. While sometimes interpreted as functional driver events, these mutations are commonly believed to be due to locally inhibited DNA repair. Here, we first show that low-dose UV light induces mutations preferably at a known ETS promoter hotspot in cultured cells even in the absence of global or transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (NER). Further, by genome-wide mapping of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) shortly after UV exposure and thus before DNA repair, we find that ETS-related mutation hotspots exhibit strong increases in CPD formation efficacy in a manner consistent with tumor mutation data at the single-base level. Analysis of a large whole genome cohort illustrates the widespread contribution of this effect to recurrent mutations in melanoma. While inhibited NER underlies a general increase in somatic mutation burden in regulatory elements including ETS sites, our data supports that elevated DNA damage formation at specific genomic bases is at the core of the prominent promoter mutation hotspots seen in skin cancers, thus explaining a key phenomenon in whole-genome cancer analyses.
Human exonuclease 1 (EXO1), a 5'→3' exonuclease, contributes to the regulation of the cell cycle checkpoints, replication fork maintenance, and post replicative DNA repair pathways. These processes are required for the resolution of stalled or blocked DNA replication that can lead to replication stress and potential collapse of the replication fork. Failure to restart the DNA replication process can result in double-strand breaks, cell-cycle arrest, cell death, or cellular transformation. In this review, we summarize the involvement of EXO1 in the replication, DNA repair pathways, cell cycle checkpoints, and the link between EXO1 and cancer.
Glyphosate is the best-selling and the most-used broad-spectrum herbicide worldwide. Microbial conversion of glyphosate to CO2 and biogenic non-extractable residues (bioNER) leads to its complete degradation. The degradation of glyphosate may vary in different soils and it depends on environmental conditions and soil properties. To date, the influence of temperature, soil pH and total organic carbon (TOC) on microbial conversion of glyphosate to bioNER has not been investigated yet. The pH or TOC of an agricultural original soil (pH 6.6, TOC 2.1%) was modified using sulfuric acid or farmyard manure (FYM), respectively. Each treatment: original (I), 3% TOC (II), 4% TOC (III), pH 6.0 (IV) and pH 5.5 (V) was amended with 13C315N-glyphosate and incubated at 10 °C, 20 °C and 30 °C for 39 days. The temperature was the main factor controlling the mineralization and the extractable 13C315N-glyphosate, whereas higher TOC content and lower pH resulted in enhanced formation of 13C-bioNER. After 39 days the cumulative mineralization of 13C-glyphosate was in the range of 12-22% (10 °C), 37-47% (20 °C) and 43-54% (30 °C). Extractable residues of 13C-glyphosate were in the range of 10-21% (10 °C) and 4-10% (20 °C and 30 °C); whereas those of 15N-glyphosate were as follows 20-32% (10 °C) and 12-25% (20 °C and 30 °C). The 13C-NER comprised about 53-69% of 13C-mass balance in soils incubated at 10 °C, but 40-50% in soils incubated at 20 °C and 30 °C. The 15N-NER were higher than the 13C-NER and varied between 62% and 74% at 10 °C, between 53% and 81% at 20 °C and 30 °C. A major formation of 13C-bioNER (72-88% of 13C-NER) at 20 °C and 30 °C was noted in soil amended with FYM. An increased formation of 15N-bioNER (14-17% of 15N-NER) was also observed in FYM-amended soil. The xenobiotic 15N-NER had a major share within the 15N-NER and thus need to be considered when assessing the environmental risk of glyphosate-NER.
To assess the effect of stimulus intensity on rod- and cone-mediated pupil light reflex (PLR) to small stimuli presented at central and peripheral visual field (VF) locations.
The PLR to small (0.43°) chromatic stimuli was tested in the right eye of healthy subjects. Blue (485 ± 20 nm) and red (625 ± 15 nm) stimuli were presented at incremental light intensities (0.5-3.75 log cd/m2) at peripheral (21.21°) and central (4.24°) VF locations using a chromatic pupilloperimeter under mesopic or blue light adaptation conditions. The percentage of pupil contraction (PPC), maximal pupil contraction velocity (MCV), latency of MCV (LMCV) and the ratio of central to peripheral responses for PPC (QPPC value) were determined.
Under mesopic light adaptation conditions, the mean PPC recorded in response to red stimuli was lower than blue stimuli in all VF locations and light intensities, and the QPPC values were higher in response to red compared with blue light stimuli across the light intensity range tested. With blue background light, the pupil responses for red and blue light stimuli were approximately the same in the peripheral VF. LMCV was nearly constant in all VF locations for blue and red stimuli, respectively.
The chromatic pupilloperimeter enables the assessment of rod- and cone- contribution to the PLR in different VF locations. The optimal light intensities determined here for the assessment of focal activation of the two photoreceptor systems may be used for clinical evaluation of photoreceptor health.
The nonbulky 5',8-cyclopurine DNA lesions (cP) and the bulky, benzo[ a]pyrene diol epoxide-derived stereoisomeric cis- and trans- N2-guanine adducts (BPDE-dG) are good substrates of the human nucleotide excision repair (NER) mechanism. These DNA lesions were embedded at the In or Out rotational settings near the dyad axis in nucleosome core particles reconstituted either with native histones extracted from HeLa cells (HeLa-NCP) or with recombinant histones (Rec-NCP). The cP lesions are completely resistant to NER in human HeLa cell extracts. The BPDE-dG adducts are also NER-resistant in Rec-NCPs but are good substrates of NER in HeLa-NCPs. The four BPDE-dG adduct samples are excised with different efficiencies in free DNA, but in HeLa-NCPs, the efficiencies are reduced by a common factor of 2.2 ± 0.2 relative to the NER efficiencies in free DNA. The NER response of the BPDE-dG adducts in HeLa-NCPs is not directly correlated with the observed differences in the thermodynamic destabilization of HeLa-NCPs, the Förster resonance energy transfer values, or hydroxyl radical footprint patterns and is weakly dependent on the rotational settings. These and other observations suggest that NER is initiated by the binding of the DNA damage-sensing NER factor XPC-RAD23B to a transiently opened BPDE-modified DNA sequence that corresponds to the known footprint of XPC-DNA-RAD23B complexes (≥30 bp). These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that post-translational modifications and the dimensions and properties of the DNA lesions are the major factors that have an impact on the dynamics and initiation of NER in nucleosomes.
Numerous proteins are involved in the multiple pathways of the DNA damage response network and play a key role to protect the genome from the wide variety of damages that can occur to DNA. An example of this is the structure-specific endonuclease ERCC1-XPF. This heterodimeric complex is in particular involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER), but also in double strand break repair and interstrand cross-link repair pathways. Here we review the function of ERCC1-XPF in various DNA repair pathways and discuss human disorders associated with ERCC1-XPF deficiency. We also overview our molecular and structural understanding of XPF-ERCC1.
The large number of chemical and pharmaceutical patents has attracted researchers doing biomedical text mining to extract valuable information such as chemicals, genes and gene products. To facilitate gene and gene product annotations in patents, BioCreative V.5 organized a gene- and protein-related object (GPRO) recognition task, in which participants were assigned to identify GPRO mentions and determine whether they could be linked to their unique biological database records. In this paper, we describe the system constructed for this task. Our system is based on two different NER approaches: the statistical-principle-based approach (SPBA) and conditional random fields (CRF). Therefore, we call our system SPBA-CRF. SPBA is an interpretable machine-learning framework for gene mention recognition. The predictions of SPBA are used as features for our CRF-based GPRO recognizer. The recognizer was developed for identifying chemical mentions in patents, and we adapted it for GPRO recognition. In the BioCreative V.5 GPRO recognition task, SPBA-CRF obtained an F-score of 73.73% on the evaluation metric of GPRO type 1 and an F-score of 78.66% on the evaluation metric of combining GPRO types 1 and 2. Our results show that SPBA trained on an external NER dataset can perform reasonably well on the partial match evaluation metric. Furthermore, SPBA can significantly improve performance of the CRF-based recognizer trained on the GPRO dataset.
Repair of UV-induced DNA damage requires chromatin remodeling. How repair is initiated in chromatin remains largely unknown. We recently demonstrated that global genome-nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) in chromatin is organized into domains in relation to open reading frames. Here, we define these domains, identifying the genomic locations from which repair is initiated. By examining DNA damage-induced changes in the linear structure of nucleosomes at these sites, we demonstrate how chromatin remodeling is initiated during GG-NER. In undamaged cells, we show that the GG-NER complex occupies chromatin, establishing the nucleosome structure at these genomic locations, which we refer to as GG-NER complex binding sites (GCBSs). We demonstrate that these sites are frequently located at genomic boundaries that delineate chromosomally interacting domains (CIDs). These boundaries define domains of higher-order nucleosome-nucleosome interaction. We demonstrate that initiation of GG-NER in chromatin is accompanied by the disruption of dynamic nucleosomes that flank GCBSs by the GG-NER complex.
Chemical named entity recognition (NER) has traditionally been dominated by conditional random fields (CRF)-based approaches but given the success of the artificial neural network techniques known as "deep learning" we decided to examine them as an alternative to CRFs. We present here several chemical named entity recognition systems. The first system translates the traditional CRF-based idioms into a deep learning framework, using rich per-token features and neural word embeddings, and producing a sequence of tags using bidirectional long short term memory (LSTM) networks-a type of recurrent neural net. The second system eschews the rich feature set-and even tokenisation-in favour of character labelling using neural character embeddings and multiple LSTM layers. The third system is an ensemble that combines the results of the first two systems. Our original BioCreative V.5 competition entry was placed in the top group with the highest F scores, and subsequent using transfer learning have achieved a final F score of 90.33% on the test data (precision 91.47%, recall 89.21%).
An enantioselective [5+2] cycloaddition of vinylethylene carbonates and α-diazoketones was achieved for the first time by merging photoactivation and asymmetric Pd catalysis. The key to the success of this method is the enantioselective trapping of Pd-containing, 1,5-dipolar intermediates by ketenes, a class of reactive C2 synthons, which were generated in an in situ and traceless manner under visible light irradiation. Through this trapping, a variety of 7-membered lactones bearing challenging chiral quaternary stereocenters can be accessed in a facile manner with good efficiency and high enantioselectivity (up to 99% yield and 96:4 er).
Our study aimed to investigate the association between polymorphism of three core genes belonging to NER pathway and preeclampsia (PE) risk in Chinese Han Women. The DNA used in our experiment was extracted from 1004 cases and 1274 normal pregnant women. All single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed with TaqMan allelic discrimination real-time PCR. Our findings showed the genotype and allele frequency of XPA rs1800975, XPF rs1799801, XPG rs17655 in case group has no significant differences compared with control group (all P &gt; 0.05). However, we found the genotype of rs1799801 in the control group was significantly different from severe PE group in cases (P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, the genotype frequency of rs1800975 and rs1799801in the early-onset PE were significantly different from control group (all P &lt; 0.05). These results indicated that the polymorphism of the three SNPs had no significant correlation with risk of PE as a whole. However, we found XPA rs1800975 played a role in the development of early-onset PE, and XPF rs1799801 was associated with severe PE and early-onset PE. So we may need to continue to increase the sample size to clarify their relationship.
Disease named entity recognition (NER) is a fundamental step in information processing of medical texts. However, disease NER involves complex issues such as descriptive modifiers in actual practice. The accurate identification of disease NER is a still an open and essential research problem in medical information extraction and text mining tasks.
A hybrid model named Semantics Bidirectional LSTM and CRF (SBLC) for disease named entity recognition task is proposed. The model leverages word embeddings, Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory networks and Conditional Random Fields. A publically available NCBI disease dataset is applied to evaluate the model through comparing with nine state-of-the-art baseline methods including cTAKES, MetaMap, DNorm, C-Bi-LSTM-CRF, TaggerOne and DNER.
The results show that the SBLC model achieves an F1 score of 0.862 and outperforms the other methods. In addition, the model does not rely on external domain dictionaries, thus it can be more conveniently applied in many aspects of medical text processing.
According to performance comparison, the proposed SBLC model achieved the best performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in disease named entity recognition.
Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) encompasses a group of rare diseases characterized in most cases by malfunction of nucleotide excision repair (NER), which results in an increased sensitivity to UV radiation in affected individuals. Approximately 25-30% of XP patients present with neurological symptoms, such as sensorineural deafness, mental deterioration and ataxia. Although it is known that dysfunctional DNA repair is the primary pathogenesis in XP, growing evidence suggests that mitochondrial pathophysiology may also occur. This appears to be secondary to dysfunctional NER but may contribute to the neurodegenerative process in these patients. The available pharmacological treatments in XP mostly target the dermal manifestations of the disease. In the present review, we outline how current understanding of the pathophysiology of XP could be used to develop novel therapies to counteract the neurological symptoms. Moreover, the coexistence of cancer and neurodegeneration present in XP led us to focus on possible new avenues targeting mitochondrial pathophysiology.
Ultraviolet (UV) light-induced mutations are unevenly distributed across skin cancer genomes, but the molecular mechanisms responsible for this heterogeneity are not fully understood. Here, we assessed how nucleosome structure impacts the positions of UV-induced mutations in human melanomas. Analysis of mutation positions from cutaneous melanomas within strongly positioned nucleosomes revealed a striking ~10 base pair (bp) oscillation in mutation density with peaks occurring at dinucleotides facing away from the histone octamer. Additionally, higher mutation density at the nucleosome dyad generated an overarching "translational curvature" across the 147 bp of DNA that constitutes the nucleosome core particle. This periodicity and curvature cannot be explained by sequence biases in nucleosomal DNA. Instead, our genome-wide map of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) indicates that CPD formation is elevated at outward facing dinucleotides, mirroring the oscillation of mutation density within nucleosome-bound DNA. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) activity, as measured by XR-seq, inversely correlated with the curvature of mutation density associated with the translational setting of the nucleosome. While the 10 bp periodicity of mutations is maintained across nucleosomes regardless of chromatin state, histone modifications, and transcription levels, overall mutation density and curvature across the core particle increased with lower transcription levels. Our observations suggest structural conformations of DNA promote CPD formation at specific sites within nucleosomes, and steric hindrance progressively limits lesion repair towards the nucleosome dyad. Both mechanisms create a unique extended mutation signature within strongly positioned nucleosomes across the human genome.
Stem cells persist for long periods in the body and experience many intrinsic and extrinsic stresses. For this reason, they present a powerful and effective DNA repair system in order to properly fix DNA damage and avoid the onset of a degenerative process, such as neoplastic transformation or aging. In this chapter, we compare the DNA repair ability of pluripotent stem cells (ESCs, iPSCs, and Muse cells) and other adult stem cells. We also describe personal investigations showing a robust and effective capacity of Muse cells in sensing and repairing DNA following chemical and physical stress. Muse cells can repair DNA through base and nucleotide excision repair mechanisms, BER and NER, respectively. Furthermore, they present a pronounced capacity in repairing double-strand breaks by the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) process. The studies addressing the role of DNA damage repair in the biology of stem cells are of paramount importance for comprehension of their functions and, also, for setting up effective and safe stem cell-based therapy.
The nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway is critical for removing damage induced by ultraviolet (UV) light and other helix-distorting lesions from cellular DNA. While efficient NER is critical to avoid cell death and mutagenesis, NER activity is inhibited in chromatin due to the association of lesion-containing DNA with histone proteins. Histone acetylation has emerged as an important mechanism for facilitating NER in chromatin, particularly acetylation catalyzed by the Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase (SAGA); however, it is not known if other histone acetyltransferases (HATs) promote NER activity in chromatin. Here, we report that the essential Nucleosome Acetyltransferase of histone H4 (NuA4) complex is required for efficient NER in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Deletion of the non-essential Yng2 subunit of the NuA4 complex causes a general defect in repair of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) in yeast; in contrast, deletion of the Sas3 catalytic subunit of the NuA3 complex does not affect repair. Rapid depletion of the essential NuA4 catalytic subunit Esa1 using the anchor-away method also causes a defect in NER, particularly at the heterochromatic HML locus. We show that disrupting the Sds3 subunit of the Rpd3L histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex rescued the repair defect associated with loss of Esa1 activity, suggesting that NuA4-catalyzed acetylation is important for efficient NER in heterochromatin.
MADE1.0 is a public natural language processing challenge aiming to extract medication and adverse drug events from Electronic Health Records. This work presents NER and RI systems developed by UArizona team for the MADE1.0 competition. We propose a neural NER system for medical named entity recognition using both local and context features for each individual word and a simple but effective SVM-based pairwise relation classification system for identifying relations between medical entities and attributes. Our system achieves 81.56%, 83.18%, and 59.85% F1 score in the three tasks of MADE1.0 challenge, respectively, ranked amongst the top three teams for Task 2 and 3.
Frequent exposure of plants to solar ultraviolet radiation (UV) results in damaged DNA. One mechanism of DNA repair is the light independent pathway Global Genomic Nucleotide Excision Repair (GG-NER), which repairs UV damaged DNA throughout the genome. In mammals, GG-NER DNA damage recognition is performed by the Damaged DNA Binding protein 1 and 2 (DDB1/2) complex which recruits the Xeroderma Pigmentosa group C (XPC) / RAD23D complex. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, distinct proteins, Radiation sensitive 7 and 16 (Rad7p and Rad16p), recognize the damaged DNA strand and then recruit the XPC homologue, Rad4p, and Rad23p. The remainder of the proteins involved GG-NER are well conserved. DDB1, DDB2, XPC/RAD4, and RAD23 homologues have been described in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. In this study we characterize three Arabidopsis RAD7 homologues, RAD7a, RAD7b, and RAD7c. Loss of function alleles of each of the three RAD7 homologues result in increased UV sensitivity. In addition, RAD7b and RAD7c overexpression lines exhibited increased UV tolerance. Thus RAD7 homologues contribute to UV tolerance in plants as well as in yeast. This is the first time any system has been shown to utilize both the DDB1/2 and RAD7/16 damage recognition complexes.
The curation of neuroscience entities is crucial to ongoing efforts in neuroinformatics and computational neuroscience, such as those being deployed in the context of continuing large-scale brain modelling projects. However, manually sifting through thousands of articles for new information about modelled entities is a painstaking and low-reward task. Text mining can be used to help a curator extract relevant information from this literature in a systematic way. We propose the application of text mining methods for the neuroscience literature. Specifically, two computational neuroscientists annotated a corpus of entities pertinent to neuroscience using active learning techniques to enable swift, targeted annotation. We then trained machine learning models to recognise the entities that have been identified. The entities covered are Neuron Types, Brain Regions, Experimental Values, Units, Ion Currents, Channels, and Conductances and Model organisms. We tested a traditional rule-based approach, a conditional random field and a model using deep learning named entity recognition, finding that the deep learning model was superior. Our final results show that we can detect a range of named entities of interest to the neuroscientist with a macro average precision, recall and F1 score of 0.866, 0.817 and 0.837 respectively. The contributions of this work are as follows: 1) We provide a set of Named Entity Recognition (NER) tools that are capable of detecting neuroscience entities with performance above or similar to prior work. 2) We propose a methodology for training NER tools for neuroscience that requires very little training data to get strong performance. This can be adapted for any sub-domain within neuroscience. 3) We provide a small corpus with annotations for multiple entity types, as well as annotation guidelines to help others reproduce our experiments.
As is well-known, arsenite (As(iii)) is a human carcinogen associated with many human cancers. As(iii) can act as a co-carcinogen to induce DNA damage with other carcinogens. Benzo(a)pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE) is one of the most-studied environmental carcinogens, which exists ubiquitously in our daily life. The elucidation of the mechanism of As(iii) as a co-carcinogen with BDPE in cells causing genotoxicity is beneficial for the evaluation of its bioeffect. In this study, a comprehensive analytical system is used for DNA damage evaluation, BPDE-DNA adduct detection, arsenic speciation and gene expression analysis. Based on the experimental results, it can be inferred that BPDE and As(iii) synergistically cause genotoxicity, and the possible mechanism is that BPDE inhibits arsenic methylation, leading to cellular As(iii) enrichment. As(iii) inhibits nucleotide excision repair (NER) of the DNA adduct damage caused by BPDE. The synergistic effect of BPDE and As(iii) causes DNA strand break damage, which further results in carcinogenesis.
Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) is multi-functional cytokine that is involved in the co-ordination and regulation of many cellular homeostatic processes. Compromised TGFβ activity has been attributed to promotion of human cancers. Recent studies have identified a role for TGFβ in response to radiation-induced DNA damage, suggesting a link between TGFβ and the DNA damage response with implications for cancer development. In the present study the effects of TGFβ on promoting the repair of bulky DNA damage, through modulation of nucleotide excision repair (NER), was investigated. We show that treatment of cells with exogenous TGFβ leads to enhanced repair of DNA damage formed by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and UV-C radiation; similarly cells with constitutively activated endogenous TGFβ signaling show comparable responses. This effect of TGFβ is independent of the cell cycle. The response to TGFβ is decreased in cells that have compromised TGFβ signaling through RNA interference of Smad4, and is decreased in NER deficient cells and cells with compromised NER through RNA interference of ERCC1. Increased interaction and nuclear localization of ERCC1/XPF and ERCC1/XPA proteins is observed after TGFβ treatment. Our study represents the first experimental evidence of a role for TGFβ in the repair of bulky DNA damage resulting from promotion of the interaction and localization of repair protein complexes involved in the incision step of NER.
The Cockayne Syndrome Protein B (CSB) plays an essential role in Transcription-Coupled Nucleotide Excision Repair (TC-NER) by recruiting repair proteins once transcription is blocked with a DNA lesion. In fact, CSB-deficient cells are unable to recover from transcription-blocking DNA lesions. 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-azadC) is a nucleoside analogue that covalently traps DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) onto DNA. This anticancer drug has a double mechanism of action: it reverts aberrant hypermethylation in tumour-suppressor genes, and it induces DNA damage. We have recently reported that Homologous Recombination and XRCC1/PARP play an important role in the repair of 5-azadC-induced DNA damage. However, the mechanisms involved in the repair of the DNMT adducts induced by azadC remain poorly understood. In this paper, we show for the first time the importance of CSB in the repair of azadC-induced DNA lesions. We propose a model in which CSB initiates a signalling pathway to repair transcription blocks induced by incorporated 5-azadC. Indeed, CSB-deficient cells treated with 5-azadC show a delay in the repair of trapped DNMT1, increased levels of DNA damage and reduced survival.
DDB2 is a sensor of DNA damage and it plays an important role in Global Genomic Repair (GG-NER). Our previous studies show that DDB2 is involved in the regulation of metastasis in colon adenocarcinoma. Squamous Cell Carcinomas in the Oral/Head &amp; Neck region (HNSCC) are particularly aggressive due to high incidence of recurrence and distant metastasis. In this study, we show that DDB2 expression is downregulated in advanced HNSCCs and loss of DDB2 expression coincides with reduced survival. Recent meta-analysis of gene expression data characterized the mesenchymal-type (EMT-type) as one most aggressive cancer cluster in HNSCC. Here, we report that DDB2 constitutively represses mRNA expression of the EMT- regulatory transcription factors SNAIL, ZEB1, and angiogenic factor VEGF in HNSCC cells. As a result, re-expression of DDB2 in metastatic cells reversed EMT with transcriptional upregulation of epithelial marker E-cadherin, and downregulation of mesenchymal markers N-cadherin, Vimentin, and Fibronectin. Interestingly, in a reverse assay, depletion of DDB2 in non-metastatic cells induced expression of the same EMT-regulatory transcription factors. TGFβs are major regulators of Snail and Zeb1, and we observed that DDB2 transcriptionally regulates expression of TGFB2 in HNSCC cells. Re-expression of DDB2 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolated from Ddb2 (-/-) knockout-mice resulted in repression of EMT-regulatory factors Zeb1, Snail and Tgfb2. Taken together, these results support the active role of DDB2 as a candidate suppressor of the EMT-process in HNSCC. Early detection leads to significantly higher survival in HNSCC and DDB2 expression in tumors can be a predictor of EMT progression.
Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a form of general dermatosis characterised by photo-induced cutaneous-ocular impairment and by skin cancers. In addition to these signs, there may also be neurological involvement. This disease is related to a defect in genes within the nucleotide excision repair system for the first seven genetic groups (A-G), and to an abnormality in transcription groups for the eighth group (xeroderma pigmentosum variant - XPV). Cutaneous carcinomas are the most common types of cancer seen. They may begin in childhood. Multiple melanoma commonly occurs during the course of XP but given the frequency of spontaneous regression, the incidence is underestimated. The clinical appearance is characterised by polymorphous lesions with characteristic dyschromia and in most cases it is sufficient to establish the diagnosis. Investigation of unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) and cell survival following ultraviolet (UV) radiation were formerly considered the reference examination for laboratory diagnosis. However, these tests are now being replaced by new molecular biology techniques to screen for the genetic mutations characteristic of the disease. These techniques have proved extremely useful in identifying heterozygous patients and in antenatal diagnosis. Photoprotection is the key preventive measure: patients must avoid all exposure to the sun and to artificial sources of UV radiation. The therapeutic arsenal has recently been enriched by several modern therapeutic methods used to destroy cutaneous tumours such as imiquimod and photodynamic therapy (PDT). These approaches are valuable since they eliminate incipient tumours while sparing healthy skin. Surgery and cryosurgery are the most suitable methods for treating cutaneous tumours in children. Chemotherapy may be considered an alternative for the treatment of keratoacanthomas and squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). Cryosurgery may be combined with other therapeutic approaches to eliminate SCC of the lip. Management of these patients in reference centres, coupled with assistance from associations providing support for patients' families, has resulted in improved quality of therapy while slowing down disease progression.
Biomedical named entity recognition (Bio-NER) is a fundamental task in handling biomedical text terms, such as RNA, protein, cell type, cell line, and DNA. Bio-NER is one of the most elementary and core tasks in biomedical knowledge discovery from texts. The system described here is developed by using the BioNLP/NLPBA 2004 shared task. Experiments are conducted on a training and evaluation set provided by the task organizers.
Our results show that, compared with a baseline having a 70.09% F1 score, the RNN Jordan- and Elman-type algorithms have F1 scores of approximately 60.53% and 58.80%, respectively. When we use CRF as a machine learning algorithm, CCA, GloVe, and Word2Vec have F1 scores of 72.73%, 72.74%, and 72.82%, respectively.
By using the word embedding constructed through the unsupervised learning, the time and cost required to construct the learning data can be saved.
The provenance of several components of major uniquely eukaryotic molecular machines are increasingly being traced back to prokaryotic biological conflict systems. Here, we demonstrate that the N-terminal single-stranded DNA-binding domain from the anti-restriction protein ArdC, deployed by bacterial mobile elements against their host, was independently acquired twice by eukaryotes, giving rise to the DNA-binding domains of XPC/Rad4 and the Tc-38-like proteins in the stem kinetoplastid. In both instances, the ArdC-N domain tandemly duplicated forming an extensive DNA-binding interface. In XPC/Rad4, the ArdC-N domains (BHDs) also fused to the inactive transglutaminase domain of a peptide-N-glycanase ultimately derived from an archaeal conflict system. Alongside, we delineate several parallel acquisitions from conjugative elements/bacteriophages that gave rise to key components of the kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) replication apparatus. These findings resolve two outstanding questions in eukaryote biology: (1) the origin of the unique DNA lesion-recognition component of NER and (2) origin of the unusual, plasmid-like features of kDNA.
Cisplatin is an election drug widely used in clinic for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer. However, the heterogeneity of the gastric tumors and its resistance to the drugs, make in some cases the response very low and the prognosis unpredictable. In this manuscript we aim to find the molecular processes involved in cisplatin-induced apoptosis in two gastric cancer cell lines with different sensitivity to the treatment: AGS and MKN45. The apoptosis induction is higher in MKN45 than in AGS cells in response to CDDP. The intrinsic apoptotic pathway study revealed that MKN45 cells undergo degradation of Mcl-1 together with an increase of Bid and Bad levels, which results in sensitivity to CDDP. In addition, DNA repair NER pathway is impair in MKN45 cells due to low levels of XPC and the absence of translocation of XPA and XPD to the nucleus after stimuli. Altogether, these results suggest that NER and Bcl-2 protein family proteins are potential targets to improve the response to cisplatin treatment.
Full-thickness skin wounds, associated with deep burns or chronic wounds pose a major clinical problem. Herein, the development of in situ forming hydrogel using a natural silk fibroin (SF) biomaterial for treating burn wounds is reported. Blends of SF solutions isolated from Bombyx mori and Antheraea assama show inherent self-assembly between silk proteins and lead to irreversible gelation at body temperature. Investigation of the gelation mechanism reveals crosslinking due to formation of β-sheet structures as examined by X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The SF hydrogel supports proliferation of primary human dermal fibroblasts and migration of keratinocytes comparable to collagen gel (Col) as examined under in vitro conditions. The SF hydrogel also provides an instructive and supportive matrix to the full-thickness third-degree burn wounds in vivo. A 3-week comparative study with Col indicates that SF hydrogel not only promotes wound healing but also shows transitions from inflammation to proliferation stage as observed through the expression of TNF-α and CD163 genes. Further, deposition and remodeling of collagen type I and III fibers suggests an enhanced overall tissue regeneration. Comparable results with Col demonstrate the SF hydrogel as an effective and inexpensive formulation toward a potential therapeutic approach for burn wound treatment.
Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) is a major pathway of mammalian DNA repair that is associated with drug resistance and has not been well characterized in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The objective of this study was to explore the role of NER in relapsed ALL patients. We hypothesized that increased expression of NER genes was associated with drug resistance and relapse in ALL.
We performed secondary data analysis on two sets of pediatric ALL patients that all ultimately relapsed, and who had matched diagnosis-relapse gene expression microarray data (GSE28460 and GSE18497). GSE28460 included 49 precursor-B-ALL patients, and GSE18497 included 27 precursor-B-ALL and 14 T-ALL patients. Microarray data were processed using the Plier 16 algorithm and the 20 canonical NER genes were extracted. Comparisons were made between time of diagnosis and relapse, and between early and late relapsing subgroups. The Chi-square test was used to evaluate whether NER gene expression was altered at the level of the entire pathway and individual gene expression was compared using t-tests.
We found that gene expression of the NER pathway was significantly increased upon relapse in patients that took 3 years or greater to relapse (late relapsers, P = .007), whereas no such change was evident in patients that relapsed in less than 3 years (early relapsers, P = .180). Moreover, at diagnosis, the NER gene expression of the early relapsing subpopulation was already significantly elevated over that of the late relapsing group (P &lt; .001). This pattern was validated by an 'NER score' established by averaging the relative expression of the 20 canonical NER genes. The NER score at diagnosis was found to be significantly associated with disease-free survival in precursor-B-ALL (P &lt; .001).
Patients are over two times more likely to undergo early relapse if they have a high NER score at diagnosis, hazard ratio 2.008, 95% CI (1.256-3.211). The NER score may provide a underlying mechanism for "time to remission", a known prognostic factor in ALL, and a rationale for differential treatment.
Negative 99mTc-pertechnetate uptake of the thyroid bed indicates the absence or a small volume of remnant thyroid tissue (RTT) after total thyroidectomy (TT). The aim of this study is to evaluate the predictive value of negative 99mTc-pertechnetate scintigraphy for excellent response (ER) to radioactive iodine therapy (RIT) in low- to intermediate-risk differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) patients.
One-hundred and eighty-nine low- to intermediate-risk DTC patients who underwent TT, RIT with a single dose of 30 mCi and suppressive therapy with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from July 2015 to February 2016 in our hospital were retrospectively evaluated. 99mTc-pertechnetate thyroid scintigraphy was performed just before RIT and images were reported dichotomously as negative or positive. The response of patients was assessed for 23.2 ± 3.8 months after RIT and dichotomized as excellent response (ER) or non-excellent response (NER). 99mTc-pertechnetate uptake, age at diagnosis, gender, multifocality, T stage, N stage, preablative stimulated thyroglobulin (ps-Tg), and TSH were explored as potential predictors for ER.
80.68% (71/88) of patients with negative 99mTc-pertechnetate uptake achieved ER. When patients were evaluated according to different ps-Tg levels, we found that 94.83% (55/58) of patients with ps-Tg &lt; 1 ng/ml and negative 99mTc-pertechnetate uptake achieved ER. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that ps-Tg (P = 0.0001) and 99mTc-pertechnetate uptake (P = 0.0473) were independent predictors for ER.
In addition to ps-Tg, negative 99mTc-pertechnetate uptake is also a significant independent predictor for an excellent response in low- to intermediate-risk patients. It may be possible to omit RIT in patients with ps-Tg &lt; 1 ng/ml and concurrent negative 99mTc-pertechnetate uptake.
The environmental and health risks associated with "nonextractable" residues (NERs) of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in soils and their potential for remobilization remain largely unexplored. In this novel study, sequential solvent extractions were employed to interrogate time-dependent remobilization of benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) NERs and associated kinetics after re-equilibration (REQ) periods lasting 30 d in four artificially spiked soils aged for up to 200 days. Following sequential extractions of the re-equilibrated soils, remobilization of B[a]P NERs was observed and further confirmed by decreases in the absolute amounts of B[a]P recovered following methanolic saponification after REQ. Remobilization may occur through slow intercompartmental partitioning of more sequestered into less sequestered B[a]P fractions in soils. The amounts of B[a]P remobilized in soils decreased throughout aging following first-order kinetics, and the rates of decrease were slow but 2 to 4 times faster than those of extractable B[a]P before re-equilibration. Sandy-clay-loam soils with large amounts of hard organic carbon exhibited less NER remobilization compared to sandy soils. The amounts of remobilized B[a]P decreased significantly ( p &lt; 0.05) with aging. Specifically, butanol-remobilized B[a]P in soils spiked at 10 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg B[a]P ranged from 0.15 to 0.39 mg/kg and 0.67 to 2.30 mg/kg, respectively, after 200 d of aging.
Brucellosis caused by the bacteria of the genus Brucella is an important zoonosis and constitutes a serious public health hazard. Brucellosis is diagnosed mainly by the Rose Bengal plate test and indirect ELISA, both of which have poor specificity because false positive serological reactions occur when screening animals that have been vaccinated with B. abortus S19. Fluorescence polarization assay (FPA) was evaluated for screening samples from cattle and buffalo calves with persistent antibody titers induced by vaccination. The standardized FPA exhibited relative sensitivity and specificity of 0.94 and 0.95, respectively, and the area under the curve, kappa and accuracy were 0.98, 0.87 and 0.95, respectively. Comparison of competitive ELISA and FPA revealed that, FPA is more specific than competitive ELISA. The high specificity, sensitivity and 95% accuracy of FPA indicate that, it is suitable for testing vaccinated animals because it can distinguish between infected from vaccinated animals.
Building high-quality annotated clinical corpora is necessary for developing statistical Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to unlock information embedded in clinical text, but it is also time consuming and expensive. Consequently, it important to identify factors that may affect annotation time, such as syntactic complexity of the text- to-be-annotated and the vagaries of individual user behavior. However, limited work has been done to understand annotation of clinical text. In this study, we aimed to investigate how factors inherent to the text affect annotation time for a named entity recognition (NER) task. We recruited 9 users to annotate a clinical corpus and recorded annotation time for each sample. Then we defined a set of factors that we hypothesized might affect annotation time, and fitted them into a linear regression model to predict annotation time. The linear regression model achieved an R2 of 0.611, and revealed eight time-associated factors, including characteristics of sentences, individual users, and annotation order with implications for the practice of annotation, and the development of cost models for active learning research.
There has been an increasing interest in developing deep learning methods to recognize clinical concepts from narrative clinical text. Recently, several studies have reported that Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) outperformed traditional machine learning methods such as Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). Deep learning-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems often use statistical language models to learn word embeddings from unlabeled corpora. However, current word embedding methods have limitations to learn decent representations for low-frequency words. Medicine is a knowledge-extensive domain; existing medical knowledge has the potential to improve feature representations for less frequent yet important words. However, it is still not clear how existing medical knowledge can help deep learning models in clinical NER tasks. In this study, we integrated medical knowledge from the Unified Medical Language System with word embeddings trained from an unlabeled clinical corpus in RNNs for detection of problems, treatments and lab tests. We examined three different ways to generate medical knowledge features, including a dictionary lookup program, the KnowledgeMap system, and the MedLEE system. We also compared representing medical knowledge as one-hot vectors versus representing medical knowledge as embedding layers. The evaluation results showed that the RNN with medical knowledge as embedding layers achieved new state-of-the-art performance (a strict F1 score of 86.21% and a relaxed F1 score of 92.80%) on the 2010 i2b2 corpus, outperforming an RNN with only word embeddings and RNNs with medical knowledge as one-hot vectors. This study demonstrated an efficient way of integrating medical knowledge with distributed word representations for clinical NER.
Fanconi anemia (FA) is a hereditary chromosomal instability disorder often displaying congenital abnormalities and characterized by a predisposition to progressive bone marrow failure (BMF) and cancer. Over the last 25 years since the discovery of the first linkage of genetic mutations to FA, its molecular genetic landscape has expanded tremendously as it became apparent that FA is a disease characterized by a defect in a specific DNA repair pathway responsible for the correction of covalent cross-links between the two complementary strands of the DNA double helix. This pathway has become increasingly complex, with the discovery of now over 20 FA-linked genes implicated in interstrand cross-link (ICL) repair. Moreover, gene products known to be involved in double-strand break (DSB) repair, mismatch repair (MMR), and nucleotide excision repair (NER) play roles in the ICL response and repair of associated DNA damage. While ICL repair is predominantly coupled with DNA replication, it also can occur in non-replicating cells. DNA damage accumulation and hematopoietic stem cell failure are thought to contribute to the increased inflammation and oxidative stress prevalent in FA. Adding to its confounding nature, certain FA gene products are also engaged in the response to replication stress, caused endogenously or by agents other than ICL-inducing drugs. In this review, we discuss the mechanistic aspects of the FA pathway and the molecular defects leading to elevated replication stress believed to underlie the cellular phenotypes and clinical features of FA.
Ultraviolet light induced pyrimidine dimer is a helix distortion DNA damage type, which recruits repair complexes. However, proteins of these complexes that take part in both DNA damage recognition and repair have been well-described, the regulation of the downstream steps of nucleotide excision repair (NER) have not been clearly clarified yet. In a high-throughput screen, we identified SerpinB2 (SPB2) as one of the most dramatically upregulated gene in keratinocytes following UV irradiation. We found that both the mRNA and the protein levels of SPB2 were increased upon UV irradiation in various cell lines. Additionally, UV damage induced translocation of SPB2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus as well as the damage induced foci formation of it. Here we show that SPB2 co-localizes with XPB involved in the NER pathway at UV-induced repair foci. Finally, we demonstrated that UV irradiation promoted the association of SPB2 with ubiquitylated proteins. In basal cell carcinoma tumour cells, we identified changes in the subcellular localization of SPB2. Based on our results, we conclude that SPB2 protein has a novel role in UV-induced NER pathway, since it regulates the removal of the repair complex from the damaged site leading to cancerous malformation.
Transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) is a multiprotein complex involved in both eukaryotic transcription and DNA repair, revealing a tight connection between these two processes. Composed of 10 subunits, it can be resolved into a 7-subunits core complex with the XPB translocase and the XPD helicase, and the 3-subunits kinase complex CAK, which also exists as a free complex with a distinct function. Initially identified as basal transcription factor, TFIIH also participates in transcription regulation and plays a key role in nucleotide excision repair (NER) for opening DNA at damaged sites, lesion verification and recruitment of additional repair factors. Our understanding of TFIIH function in eukaryotic cells has greatly benefited from studies of the genetic rare diseases xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne syndrome (CS) and trichothiodystrophy (TTD), that are not only characterized by cancer and aging predispositions but also by neurological and developmental defects. Although much remains unknown about TFIIH function, significant progresses have been done regarding the structure of the complex, the functions of its catalytic subunits and the multiple roles of the regulatory core-TFIIH subunits. This review provides a non-exhaustive survey of key discoveries on the structure and function of this pivotal factor, which can be considered as a promising target for therapeutic strategies.
PARP inhibitor maintenance therapy in platinum sensitive sporadic ovarian cancers improves progression free survival. However, biomarker for synthetic lethality in platinum sensitive sporadic disease is yet to be defined. ERCC1-XPF heterodimer is a key player in nucleotide excision repair (NER) involved in the repair of platinum induced DNA damage. In the current study, we tested whether ERCC1-XPF deficiency would predict synthetic lethality to the PARP inhibitor Olaparib and platinum sensitivity in ovarian cancers.
ERCC1, XPF and PARP1 protein expression was evaluated in tumors from a cohort of 331 patients treated at Nottingham University Hospitals and correlated to clinicopathological features and survival. Pre-clinically, ERCC1 and XPF was depleted in A2780 (platinum sensitive) and A2780cis (platinum resistant) ovarian cancer cell lines and tested for platinum sensitivity as well as for Olaparib induced synthetic lethality.
Low ERCC1 was significantly associated with improved progression free survival (PFS) in patients with ovarian cancers in univariate (p = 0.001) and multivariate (p = 0.002) analysis. In addition, low ERCC1/low XPF (p = 0.003) or low ERCC1/low PARP1 (p = 0.0001) tumors was also linked to better PFS compared to high ERCC1/high XPF or high ERCC1/high PARP1 tumors. Pre-clinically, ERCC1 or XPF depletion not only increased platinum sensitivity but also increased toxicity to Olaparib therapy. Increased sensitivity was associated with DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) accumulation, cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis.
The data provide evidence that low ERCC1 is not only a predictor of platinum sensitivity but is also a promising biomarker for Olaparib induced synthetic lethality in ovarian cancers.
Although there are many studies of drugs and their side effects, the underlying mechanisms of these side effects are not well understood. It is also difficult to understand the specific pathways between drugs and side effects.
The present study seeks to construct putative paths between drugs and their side effects by applying text-mining techniques to free text of biomedical studies, and to develop ranking metrics that could identify the most-likely paths.
We extracted three types of relationships-drug-protein, protein-protein, and protein⁻side effect-from biomedical texts by using text mining and predefined relation-extraction rules. Based on the extracted relationships, we constructed whole drug-protein⁻side effect paths. For each path, we calculated its ranking score by a new ranking function that combines corpus- and ontology-based semantic similarity as well as co-occurrence frequency.
We extracted 13 plausible biomedical paths connecting drugs and their side effects from cancer-related abstracts in the PubMed database. The top 20 paths were examined, and the proposed ranking function outperformed the other methods tested, including co-occurrence, COALS, and UMLS by P@5-P@20. In addition, we confirmed that the paths are novel hypotheses that are worth investigating further.
The risk of side effects has been an important issue for the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, the causes and mechanisms of such side effects have not been fully elucidated. This study extends previous research on understanding drug side effects by using various techniques such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), Relation Extraction (RE), and semantic similarity.
It is not easy to reveal the biomedical mechanisms of side effects due to a huge number of possible paths. However, we automatically generated predictable paths using the proposed approach, which could provide meaningful information to biomedical researchers to generate plausible hypotheses for the understanding of such mechanisms.
Transcription coupled repair (TC-NER) is a subpathway of nucleotide excision repair triggered by stalling of RNA polymerase at DNA lesions. It has been suspected that transcriptional misincorporations of certain nucleotides opposite lesions that result in irreversible transcription stalling might be important for TC-NER. However, the spectra of nucleotide misincorporations opposite UV photoproducts and how they are implicated in transcriptional stalling and TC-NER in the cell remain unknown. Rad26, a low abundant yeast protein, and its human homolog CSB have been proposed to facilitate TC-NER in part by positioning and stabilizing stalling of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) at DNA lesions. Here, we found that substantial AMPs but no other nucleotides are transcriptionally misincoporated and extended opposite UV photoproducts and adjacent bases in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Rad26 does not significantly affect either the misincorporation or extension of AMPs. At normally low or moderately increased levels, Rad26 promotes error-free transcriptional bypass and TC-NER of UV photoproducts. However, Rad26 completely loses these functions when it is overexpressed to ~1/3 the level of RNAPII molecules. Also, Rad26 does not directly displace RNAPII but constitutively evicts Spt5, a key transcription elongation factor and TC-NER repressor, from the chromatin. Our results indicate that transcriptional nucleotide misincorporation is not implicated in TC-NER, and moderate eviction of Spt5 and promotion of error-free transcriptional bypass of DNA lesions by Rad26 facilitates TC-NER.
The phase transition and critical properties for the RP^{2} model in two dimensions is investigated by means of the nonequilibrium relaxation method (NER) together with the dynamical scaling analysis. The relaxation of nematic order from the all-aligned state is observed by Monte Carlo simulations. The comparison of types of the asymptotic form of the relaxation time around the transition point is considered by the dynamical scaling analysis, which clearly discriminates the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT)-type transition from the second-order one. Using the relaxation of fluctuation, the static critical exponent η and the dynamical one z, which are only the intrinsic exponents for the KT transition, are estimated at and below the KT transition temperature. The result shows similar behaviors with those observed in the KT phase for the ferromagnetic XY model in two dimensions, which has been recognized as a typical KT system, and reveals the confirmation of the present KT transition.
The multisubunit complex transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) has dual functions in transcriptional initiation and nucleotide excision repair (NER). TFIIH is comprised of two subcomplexes, the core subcomplex (seven subunits) including XPB and XPD helicases and the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-activating kinase (CAK) subcomplex (three subunits) containing CDK7 kinase. Recently, it has been reported that spironolactone, an anti-aldosterone drug, inhibits cellular NER by inducing proteasomal degradation of XPB and potentiates the cytotoxicity of platinum-based drugs in cancer cells, suggesting possible drug repositioning. In this study, we have tried to uncover the mechanism underlying the chemical-induced XPB destabilization. Based on siRNA library screening and subsequent analyses, we identified SCFFBXL18 E3 ligase consisting of Skp1, Cul1, F-box protein FBXL18 and Rbx1 responsible for spironolactone-induced XPB polyubiquitination and degradation. In addition, we showed that CDK7 kinase activity is required for this process. Finally, we found that the Ser90 residue of XPB is essential for the chemical-induced destabilization. These results led us to propose a model that spironolactone may trigger the phosphorylation of XPB at Ser90 by CDK7, which promotes the recognition and polyubiquitination of XPB by SCFFBXL18 for proteasomal degradation.
Artificial sweeteners (AS) can elicit the strong sweet sensation with the low or zero calorie, and are widely used to replace the nutritive sugar in the food and beverage industry. However, the safety issue of current AS is still controversial. Thus, it is imperative to develop more safe and potent AS. Due to the costly and laborious experimental-screening of AS, in-silico sweetener/sweetness prediction could provide a good avenue to identify the potential sweetener candidates before experiment. In this work, we curate the largest dataset of 530 sweeteners and 850 non-sweeteners, and collect the second largest dataset of 352 sweeteners with the relative sweetness (RS) from the literature. In light of these experimental datasets, we adopt five machine-learning methods and conformational-independent molecular fingerprints to derive the classification and regression models for the prediction of sweetener and its RS, respectively via the consensus strategy. Our best classification model achieves the 95% confidence intervals for the accuracy (0.91 ± 0.01), precision (0.90 ± 0.01), specificity (0.94 ± 0.01), sensitivity (0.86 ± 0.01), F1-score (0.88 ± 0.01), and NER (Non-error Rate: 0.90 ± 0.01) on the test set, which outperforms the model (NER = 0.85) of Rojas et al. in terms of NER, and our best regression model gives the 95% confidence intervals for the R2(test set) and ΔR2 [referring to |R2(test set)- R2(cross-validation)|] of 0.77 ± 0.01 and 0.03 ± 0.01, respectively, which is also better than the other works based on the conformation-independent 2D descriptors (e.g., 2D Dragon) according to R2(test set) and ΔR2. Our models are obtained by averaging over nineteen data-splitting schemes, and fully comply with the guidelines of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which are not completely followed by the previous relevant works that are all on the basis of only one random data-splitting scheme for the cross-validation set and test set. Finally, we develop a user-friendly platform "e-Sweet" for the automatic prediction of sweetener and its corresponding RS. To our best knowledge, it is a first and free platform that can enable the experimental food scientists to exploit the current machine-learning methods to boost the discovery of more AS with the low or zero calorie content.
The feasibility of generating a lipid-containing algal-bacterial polyculture biomass in municipal primary wastewater and enhancing biomethanation of lipid-extracted algal residues (LEA) through hydrothermal pretreatment and co-digestion with sewage sludge (SS) was investigated. In high-rate algal ponds, the polyculture of native algal and bacteria species demonstrated a monthly average net and gross biomass productivity of 30 ± 3 and 36 ± 3 gAFDW m-2 day-1 (summer season). The algal community was dominated by Micractinium sp. followed by Scenedesmus sp., Chlorella sp., pennate diatoms and Chlamydomonas sp. The polyculture metabolic activities resulted in average reductions of wastewater volatile suspended solids (VSS), carbonaceous soluble biochemical oxygen demand (csBOD5) and total nitrogen (Ntotal) of 63 ± 18%, 98 ± 1% and 76 ± 21%, respectively. Harvested biomass contained nearly 23% lipid content and an extracted blend of fatty acid methyl esters satisfied the ASTM D6751 standard for biodiesel. Anaerobic digestion of lipid extracted algal residues (LEA) demonstrated long lag-phase in methane production of 17 days and ultimate methane yield of 296 ± 2 mL/gVS (or ~50% of theoretical), likely because to its limited biodegradability and toxicity due to presence of the residual solvent (hexane). Hydrothermal pretreatment increased the ultimate methane yield and production rate by 15-30% but did not mitigate solvent toxicity effects completely leading to less substantial improvement in energy output of 5-20% and diminished Net Energy Ratio (NER &lt; 1). In contrast, co-digestion of LEA with sewage sludge (10% to 90% ratio) was found to minimize solvent toxicity and improve methane yield enhancing the energy output ~4-fold, compared to using LEA as a single substrate, and advancing NER to 4.2.
Bacteria deploy global programs of gene expression, including components of the SOS response, to counteract the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of environmental DNA-damaging factors. Here we report that genetic damage promoted by hexavalent chromium elicited the SOS response in Bacillus subtilis, as evidenced by the induction of transcriptional uvrA-lacZ, recA-lacZ, and P recA-gfp fusions. Accordingly, B. subtilis strains deficient in homologous recombination (RecA) and nucleotide excision repair (NER) (UvrA), components of the SOS response, were significantly more sensitive to Cr(VI) treatment than were cells of the wild-type strain. These results strongly suggest that Cr(VI) induces the formation in growing B. subtilis cells of cytotoxic and genotoxic bulky DNA lesions that are processed by RecA and/or the NER pathways. In agreement with this notion, Cr(VI) significantly increased the formation of DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) and induced mutagenesis in recA- and uvrA-deficient B. subtilis strains, through a pathway that required YqjH/YqjW-mediated translesion synthesis. We conclude that Cr(VI) promotes mutagenesis and cell death in B. subtilis by a mechanism that involves the formation of DPCs and that such deleterious effects are counteracted by both the NER and homologous recombination pathways, belonging to the RecA-dependent SOS system.IMPORTANCE It has been shown that, following permeation of cell barriers, Cr(VI) kills B. subtilis cells following a mechanism of reactive oxygen species-promoted DNA damage, which is counteracted by the guanine oxidized repair system. Here we report a distinct mechanism of Cr(VI)-promoted DNA damage that involves production of DPCs capable of eliciting the bacterial SOS response. We also report that the NER and homologous recombination (RecA) repair pathways, as well as low-fidelity DNA polymerases, counteract this metal-induced mechanism of killing in B. subtilis Hence, our results contribute to an understanding of how environmental pollutants activate global programs of gene expression that allow bacteria to contend with the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of heavy metals.
The base excision repair (BER) pathway and nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway play important roles in the repair of benzene-induced genetic damage, and the effects of polymorphisms in these pathways on genetic damage and global DNA methylation are of great interest.
Ten single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the BER (XRCC1: rs25489, rs25487; APE1: rs1130409) and NER pathways (XPA: rs1800975; XPC: rs2228000, rs2228002; XPD: rs13181, rs1799793; XPG: rs17655; ERCC1: rs3212986) were analyzed by a Kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) assay to find associations with cytokinesis-block micronucleus (MN) frequency and global DNA methylation in 294 shoe factory workers and 102 control participants.
Workers who possessed the following genotypes were associated with high MN frequency: rs25487 AA (FR (95% CI): 1.50 (1.16,1.9), p = 0.002, reference GG); rs1130409 GG (FR (95% CI): 1.28 (1.05,1.55), p = 0.010, reference TT); rs17655 GC (FR (95% CI): 1.18 (1.02,1.38), p = 0.038, reference GG); and rs3212986 TT (FR (95% CI): 1.55 (1.31,1.83), p &lt; 0.001, reference GG). Workers with four and three mutant alleles showed 3.72-fold (OR (95% CI): 3.72 (1.34, 10.03), p = 0.009) and 2.48-fold (OR (95% CI): 2.48 (1.27, 4.88), p = 0.008) increased risk of genetic damage compared with workers with no or one mutant allele, and a dose-response relationship was found by the trend test (p = 0.006). The rs1130409 variant allele (GG+GT) was associated with low global DNA methylation (β=-0.20, 95% CI: -0.42, 0.03, p = 0.045).
In benzene-exposed workers, BER and NER pathway polymorphism haplotypes are associated with different levels of chromosome damage and had little effect on global DNA methylation.
Prenatal stress (PNS) has gained attention with regard to its impact on hippocampal neurogenesis in neonates which serves as a risk factor for postnatal neurodevelopmental deficits. Evidences from animal models have suggested that depression responsive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and its hormonal response via cortisol, is responsible for critical neurodevelopmental deficits in the offspring which is transduced due to gestational stress. But knowledge in the area of assessing the effects of maternal chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) on neurogenesis and expression of some key signaling molecules in the offsprings are limited. We have used Wistar rats to induce PNS in offsprings by maternal CUMS during pregnancy. Prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus were assessed for biomarkers of oxidative stress, neurogenesis, neurodevelopmental signaling molecules and DNA damage in the male Wister offsprings. Our investigations resulted in sufficient evidences which prove how maternal psychological stress has widespread effect on the fetal outcomes via major physiological alteration in the antioxidant levels, neurogenesis, signaling molecules and DNA damage. PNS leads to the upregulation of GSK-3β which in turn inhibited mRNA and protein expressions of sonic hedgehog (SHH), β-catenin, Notch and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The study explored multifaceted signaling molecules especially, GSK-3β responsible for crosstalks between different neurodevelopmental molecules like SHH, Notch, BDNF and β-catenin affecting neurodevelopment of the offsprings due to PNS.
5',8-Cyclo-2'-deoxyadenosine (cdA), in the 5'R and 5'Sdiastereomeric forms, are typical non strand-break oxidative DNA lesions, induced by hydroxyl radicals, with emerging importance as a molecular marker. These lesions are exclusively repaired by the nucleotide excision repair (NER) mechanism with a low efficiency, thus readily accumulating in the genome. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase1 (PARP1) acts as an early responder to DNA damage and plays a key role as a nick sensor in the maintenance of the integrity of the genome by recognizing nicked DNA. So far, it was unknown whether the two diastereomeric cdA lesions could induce specific PARP1 binding. Here, we provide the first evidence of PARP1 to selectively recognize the diastereomeric lesions of 5'S-cdA and 5'R-cdA in vitro as compared to deoxyadenosine in model DNA substrates (23-mers) by using circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy, immunoblotting analysis, and gel mobility shift assay. Several features of the recognition of the damaged and undamaged oligonucleotides by PARP1 were characterized. Remarkably, PARP1 exhibits different affinities in binding to a double strand (ds) oligonucleotide, which incorporates cdA lesions in R and S diastereomeric form. In particular, PARP1 proved to bind oligonucleotides, including a 5'S-cdA, with a higher affinity constant for the 5'S lesion in a model of ds DNA than 5'R-cdA, showing different recognition patterns, also compared with undamaged dA. This new finding highlights the ability of PARP1 to recognize and differentiate the distorted DNA backbone in a biomimetic system caused by different diastereomeric forms of a cdA lesion.
Transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) is a dedicated DNA repair pathway that removes transcription-blocking DNA lesions (TBLs). TC-NER is initiated by the recognition of lesion-stalled RNA Polymerase II by the joint action of the TC-NER factors Cockayne Syndrome protein A (CSA), Cockayne Syndrome protein B (CSB) and UV-Stimulated Scaffold Protein A (UVSSA). However, the exact recruitment mechanism of these factors toward TBLs remains elusive. Here, we study the recruitment mechanism of UVSSA using live-cell imaging and show that UVSSA accumulates at TBLs independent of CSA and CSB. Furthermore, using UVSSA deletion mutants, we could separate the CSA interaction function of UVSSA from its DNA damage recruitment activity, which is mediated by the UVSSA VHS and DUF2043 domains, respectively. Quantitative interaction proteomics showed that the Spt16 subunit of the histone chaperone FACT interacts with UVSSA, which is mediated by the DUF2043 domain. Spt16 is recruited to TBLs, independently of UVSSA, to stimulate UVSSA recruitment and TC-NER-mediated repair. Spt16 specifically affects UVSSA, as Spt16 depletion did not affect CSB recruitment, highlighting that different chromatin-modulating factors regulate different reaction steps of the highly orchestrated TC-NER pathway.
DNA lesions interfere with cellular processes such as transcription and replication and need to be adequately resolved to warrant genome integrity. Beyond their primary role in molecule transport, nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) function in other processes such as transcription, nuclear organization and DNA double strand break (DSB) repair. Here we found that the removal of UV-induced DNA lesions by nucleotide excision repair (NER) is compromised in the absence of the Nup84 nuclear pore component. Importantly, nup84Δ cells show an exacerbated sensitivity to UV in early S phase and delayed replication fork progression, suggesting that unrepaired spontaneous DNA lesions persist during S phase. In addition, nup84Δ cells are defective in the repair of replication-born DSBs by sister chromatid recombination (SCR) and rely on post-replicative repair functions for normal proliferation, indicating dysfunctions in the cellular pathways that enable replication on damaged DNA templates. Altogether, our data reveal a central role of the NPC in the DNA damage response to facilitate replication progression through damaged DNA templates by promoting efficient NER and SCR and preventing chromosomal rearrangements.
Quantitative measurement of DNA adducts in carcinogen-exposed cells provides the information about the frequency of formation and the rate of removal of DNA lesions in vivo, which yields insights into the initial events of mutagenesis. Metabolic activation of tobacco-specific nitrosamines, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) and its reduction product 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL), leads to pyridyloxobutylation and pyridylhydroxybutylation of DNA. In this study, we employed a highly robust nanoflow liquid chromatography-nanoelectrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-nESI-MS/MS) coupled with the isotope-dilution method for simultaneous quantification of O6-[4-(3-pyridyl)-4-hydroxylbut-1-yl]-2'-deoxyguanosine ( O6-PHBdG) and O2- and O4-[4-(3-pyridyl)-4-hydroxylbut-1-yl]-thymidine ( O2-PHBdT and O4-PHBdT). Cultured mammalian cells were exposed to a model pyridylhydroxybutylating agent, 4-(acetoxymethylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNALOAc), followed by DNA extraction, enzymatic digestion, and sample enrichment prior to nLC-nESI-MS/MS quantification. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that O4-PHBdT is quantifiable in cellular DNA and naked DNA upon NNALOAc exposure. We also show that nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery may counteract the formation of O2-PHBdT and O4-PHBdT, and O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) may be responsible for the repair of O6-PHBdG and O4-PHBdT in mammalian cells. Together, our study provides new knowledge about the occurrence and repair of NNAL-induced DNA lesions in mammalian cells.
Over the past years, there were dramatic improvements in identifying and assessing various feedstocks for the production of biodiesel fuels. To promote a particular feedstock as a renewable source of energy, it is important to analyze their energy, economic, and engine performance characteristics. The current work attempts to evaluate the net energy and economic indices for both fossil diesel and coconut-blended diesel (B20) considering the diesel consumption by the Indian railways. Further, we present the experimental results of a multi-cylinder diesel engine operated with neat coconut biodiesel (B100) and fossil diesel at various load and speed conditions. The engine experiments reveal that the coconut biodiesel exhibits leaner combustion and shorter ignition delay than fossil diesel. Lower amount of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, and smoke emission is observed in the case of coconut biodiesel, with higher levels of nitric oxide (14%) and fuel consumption than diesel. The coefficient of variation in indicated mean effective pressure is within the range of better driveability zone for both the fuels at all test conditions. Overall the engine performance, emission and combustion results with neat coconut biodiesel are favorable with a penalty in NO emission at high load conditions. The techno-economical study highlights higher production cost per liter of B20 than the cost of fossil diesel. However, the net energy ratio (NER) for B20 is 1.021, favoring higher output than diesel and thus lowers the dependency on crude oil.
Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a versatile DNA repair pathway, which can remove an extremely broad range of base lesions from the genome. In mammalian global genomic NER, the XPC protein complex initiates the repair reaction by recognizing sites of DNA damage, and this depends on detection of disrupted/destabilized base pairs within the DNA duplex. A model has been proposed that XPC first interacts with unpaired bases and then the XPD ATPase/helicase in concert with XPA verifies the presence of a relevant lesion by scanning a DNA strand in 5'-3' direction. Such multi-step strategy for damage recognition would contribute to achieve both versatility and accuracy of the NER system at substantially high levels. In addition, recognition of ultraviolet light (UV)-induced DNA photolesions is facilitated by the UV-damaged DNA-binding protein complex (UV-DDB), which not only promotes recruitment of XPC to the damage sites, but also may contribute to remodeling of chromatin structures such that the DNA lesions gain access to XPC and the following repair proteins. Even in the absence of UV-DDB, however, certain types of histone modifications and/or chromatin remodeling could occur, which eventually enable XPC to find sites with DNA lesions. Exploration of novel factors involved in regulation of the DNA damage recognition process is now ongoing.
Background Species occurrence records are very important in the biodiversity domain. While several available corpora contain only annotations of species names or habitats and geographical locations, there is no consolidated corpus that covers all types of entities necessary for extracting species occurrence from biodiversity literature. In order to alleviate this issue, we have constructed the COPIOUS corpus-a gold standard corpus that covers a wide range of biodiversity entities. Results Two annotators manually annotated the corpus with five categories of entities, i.e. taxon names, geographical locations, habitats, temporal expressions and person names. The overall inter-annotator agreement on 200 doubly-annotated documents is approximately 81.86% F-score. Amongst the five categories, the agreement on habitat entities was the lowest, indicating that this type of entity is complex. The COPIOUS corpus consists of 668 documents downloaded from the Biodiversity Heritage Library with over 26K sentences and more than 28K entities. Named entity recognisers trained on the corpus could achieve an F-score of 74.58%. Moreover, in recognising taxon names, our model performed better than two available tools in the biodiversity domain, namely the SPECIES tagger and the Global Name Recognition and Discovery. More than 1,600 binary relations of Taxon-Habitat, Taxon-Person, Taxon-Geographical locations and Taxon-Temporal expressions were identified by applying a pattern-based relation extraction system to the gold standard. Based on the extracted relations, we can produce a knowledge repository of species occurrences. Conclusion The paper describes in detail the construction of a gold standard named entity corpus for the biodiversity domain. An investigation of the performance of named entity recognition (NER) tools trained on the gold standard revealed that the corpus is sufficiently reliable and sizeable for both training and evaluation purposes. The corpus can be further used for relation extraction to locate species occurrences in literature-a useful task for monitoring species distribution and preserving the biodiversity.
Dengue is a rapidly spreading acute arboviral infection transmitted through a human and Aedes mosquito cycle. Though northeast region of India has been experiencing dengue outbreaks regularly for over a decade, reports on genetic characterization of the virus from this region are limited. The present study was undertaken to detect the genotype and genetic composition of circulating dengue virus (DENV) in this region. Blood samples were collected from 918 suspected dengue patients of five northeast Indian states. Serological investigations, viz, nonstructural 1 (NS1) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunoglobulin M (IgM) ELISA, and immunoglobulin G (IgG) ELISA were performed followed by molecular detection. Sequence analysis and phylogenetic tree construction based on capsid-premembrane (C-prM) gene junction was done by BioEdit and MEGA6 software, respectively. Serological detection showed 35.34% NS1 and 18.12% IgM positivity. Secondary infection was observed in 24.53%. All four serotypes were detected. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated circulation of genotype III of DENV-1, genotype IV of DENV-2, and genotype III of DENV-3. Sequences from this region form distinct clades in the phylogenetic tree. Characterization of the C-prM gene junction reveals divergence among the DENV strains. As genetic variation within the DENV is known to be associated with diverse clinical outcomes, information regarding the genetic composition of circulating virus could be beneficial in designing an effective intervention strategy.
UV light induces cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts (6-4PPs), which can result in carcinogenesis and aging, if not properly repaired by nucleotide excision repair (NER). Assays to determine DNA damage load and repair rates are invaluable tools for fundamental and clinical NER research. However, most current assays to quantify DNA damage and repair cannot be performed in real time. To overcome this limitation, we made use of the damage recognition characteristics of CPD and 6-4PP photolyases (PLs). Fluorescently-tagged PLs efficiently recognize UV-induced DNA damage without blocking NER activity, and therefore can be used as sensitive live-cell damage sensors. Importantly, FRAP-based assays showed that PLs bind to damaged DNA in a highly sensitive and dose-dependent manner, and can be used to quantify DNA damage load and to determine repair kinetics in real time. Additionally, PLs can instantly reverse DNA damage by 405 nm laser-assisted photo-reactivation during live-cell imaging, opening new possibilities to study lesion-specific NER dynamics and cellular responses to damage removal. Our results show that fluorescently-tagged PLs can be used as a versatile tool to sense, quantify and repair DNA damage, and to study NER kinetics and UV-induced DNA damage response in living cells.
The forests of western Amazonia are among the most diverse tree communities on Earth, yet this exceptional diversity is distributed highly unevenly within and among communities. In particular, a small number of dominant species account for the majority of individuals, whereas the large majority of species are locally and regionally extremely scarce. By definition, dominant species contribute little to local species richness (alpha diversity), yet the importance of dominant species in structuring patterns of spatial floristic turnover (beta diversity) has not been investigated. Here, using a network of 207 forest inventory plots, we explore the role of dominant species in determining regional patterns of beta diversity (community-level floristic turnover and distance-decay relationships) across a range of habitat types in northern lowland Peru. Of the 2,031 recorded species in our data set, only 99 of them accounted for 50% of individuals. Using these 99 species, it was possible to reconstruct the overall features of regional beta diversity patterns, including the location and dispersion of habitat types in multivariate space, and distance-decay relationships. In fact, our analysis demonstrated that regional patterns of beta diversity were better maintained by the 99 dominant species than by the 1,932 others, whether quantified using species-abundance data or species presence-absence data. Our results reveal that dominant species are normally common only in a single forest type. Therefore, dominant species play a key role in structuring western Amazonian tree communities, which in turn has important implications, both practically for designing effective protected areas, and more generally for understanding the determinants of beta diversity patterns.
Environmental fate assessment of chemicals involves standardized simulation tests with isotope-labeled molecules to balance transformation, mineralization, and formation of nonextractable residues (NER). Methods to predict microbial turnover and biogenic NER have been developed, having limited use when metabolites accumulate, the chemicals are not the only C source, or provide for other macroelements. To improve predictive capability, we extended a recently developed method for microbial growth yield estimation to account for incomplete degradation and multiple-element assimilation and combined it with a dynamic model for fate description in soils and sediments. We evaluated the results against the unique experimental data of 13C3-15N co-labeled glyphosate turnover with AMPA formation in water-sediment systems (OECD 308). Balancing 13C- and 15N- fluxes to biomass showed a pronounced shift of glyphosate transformation from full mineralization to AMPA formation. This may be explained by various hypotheses, for example, the limited substrate turnover inherent to the batch conditions of the test system causing microbial starvation or inhibition by P release. Modeling results indicate initial N overload due to the lower C/N ratio in glyphosate compared to average cell composition leading to subsequent C demand and accumulation of AMPA.
Chloroethylnitrosourea (CENU) derivatives, such as nimustine (ACNU) and carmustine (BCNU), are employed in brain tumor chemotherapy due to their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. They are thought to suppress tumor development through DNA chloroethylation, followed by the formation of interstrand cross-links (ICLs) that efficiently block replication and transcription. However, the alkylation of DNA and ICLs may trigger genotoxicity, leading to tumor formation as a side effect of the chemotherapeutic treatment. Although the involvement of O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) in repairing chloroethylated guanine (O6-chloroethylguanine) has been reported, the exact lesion responsible for the genotoxicity and the pathway responsible for repairing it remains unclear.
We examined the mutations induced by ACNU and BCNU using a series of Escherichia coli strains, CC101 to CC111, in which reverse mutations due to each episome from F'101 to F'106 and frameshift mutations due to each episome from F'107 to F'111 could be detected. The mutant frequency increased in E. coli CC102, which can detect a GC to AT mutation. To determine the pathway responsible for repairing the CENU-induced lesions, we compared the frequency of mutations induced by CENU in the wild-type strain to those in the ada, ogt (AGT-deficient) strain, uvrA (nucleotide excision repair (NER)-deficient) strain, mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient strains, and recA (recombination deficient) strain of E. coli CC102. The frequencies of mutations induced by ACNU and BCNU increased in the ada, ogt strain, demonstrating that O6-chloroethylguanines were formed, and that a portion was repaired by AGT.Mutation induced by ACNU in NER-deficient strain showed a similar profile to that in AGT-deficient strain, suggesting that an NER and AGT play at the similar efficacy to protect E. coli from mutation induced by ACNU. O6-Chloroethylguanine is reported to form ICLs if it is not repaired. We examined the survival rates and the frequencies of mutations induced by ACNU and BCNU in the uvrA strain, the recA strain, as well as a double-deficient strain of CC102. The mutation profile of the double-deficient strain was similar to that of the NER-deficient strain, suggesting that an NER protects E. coli from mutations but not recombination. In addition, cell death was more pronounced in the uvrA, recA double-deficient strain than in the single-deficient strains.
These results suggest that the toxic lesions induced by CENU were repaired additively or synergistically by NER and recombination. In other words, lesions, such as ICLs, appear to be repaired by NER and recombination independently.
Extracting concepts from biomedical texts is a key to support many advanced applications such as biomedical information retrieval. However, in clinical notes Named Entity Recognition (NER) has to deal with various types of errors such as spelling errors, grammatical errors, truncated sentences, and non-standard abbreviations. Moreover, in numerous countries, NER is challenged by the availability of many resources originally developed and only suitable for English texts. This paper presents the Cimind system, a multilingual system dedicated to named entity recognition in medical texts based on a phonetic similarity measure.
Cimind performs entity recognition by combining phonetic recognition using the DM phonetic algorithm to deal with spelling errors and string similarity measures. Three main steps are processed to identify terms in a controlled vocabulary: normalization, candidate selection by phonetic similarity and candidate ranking.
Cimind was evaluated in the 2016 and 2017 editions of the CLEF eHealth challenge in the CépiDC/CDC tasks. In 2017, it obtained on each corpus the following results: English dataset: 83.9% P, 78.3% R, 81.0% F1; French raw dataset: 85.7% P, 68.9% R, 76.4% F1; French aligned dataset: 83.5% P, 77.5% R, 80.4% F1. It ranked first in French and fourth in English in officials runs.
In recent years, Online Social Networks (OSNs) have received a great deal of attention for their potential use in the spatial and temporal modeling of events owing to the information that can be extracted from these platforms. Within this context, one of the most latent applications is the monitoring of natural disasters. Vital information posted by OSN users can contribute to relief efforts during and after a catastrophe. Although it is possible to retrieve data from OSNs using embedded geographic information provided by GPS systems, this feature is disabled by default in most cases. An alternative solution is to geoparse specific locations using language models based on Named Entity Recognition (NER) techniques. In this work, a sensor that uses Twitter is proposed to monitor natural disasters. The approach is intended to sense data by detecting toponyms (named places written within the text) in tweets with event-related information, e.g., a collapsed building on a specific avenue or the location at which a person was last seen. The proposed approach is carried out by transforming tokenized tweets into word embeddings: a rich linguistic and contextual vector representation of textual corpora. Pre-labeled word embeddings are employed to train a Recurrent Neural Network variant, known as a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (biLSTM) network, that is capable of dealing with sequential data by analyzing information in both directions of a word (past and future entries). Moreover, a Conditional Random Field (CRF) output layer, which aims to maximize the transition from one NER tag to another, is used to increase the classification accuracy. The resulting labeled words are joined to coherently form a toponym, which is geocoded and scored by a Kernel Density Estimation function. At the end of the process, the scored data are presented graphically to depict areas in which the majority of tweets reporting topics related to a natural disaster are concentrated. A case study on Mexico's 2017 Earthquake is presented, and the data extracted during and after the event are reported.
The Named Entity Recognition (NER) task as a key step in the extraction of health information, has encountered many challenges in Chinese Electronic Medical Records (EMRs). Firstly, the casual use of Chinese abbreviations and doctors' personal style may result in multiple expressions of the same entity, and we lack a common Chinese medical dictionary to perform accurate entity extraction. Secondly, the electronic medical record contains entities from a variety of categories of entities, and the length of those entities in different categories varies greatly, which increases the difficult in the extraction for the Chinese NER. Therefore, the entity boundary detection becomes the key to perform accurate entity extraction of Chinese EMRs, and we need to develop a model that supports multiple length entity recognition without relying on any medical dictionary.
In this study, we incorporate part-of-speech (POS) information into the deep learning model to improve the accuracy of Chinese entity boundary detection. In order to avoid the wrongly POS tagging of long entities, we proposed a method called reduced POS tagging that reserves the tags of general words but not of the seemingly medical entities. The model proposed in this paper, named SM-LSTM-CRF, consists of three layers: self-matching attention layer - calculating the relevance of each character to the entire sentence; LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layer - capturing the context feature of each character; CRF (Conditional Random Field) layer - labeling characters based on their features and transfer rules.
The experimental results at a Chinese EMRs dataset show that the F1 value of SM-LSTM-CRF is increased by 2.59% compared to that of the LSTM-CRF. After adding POS feature in the model, we get an improvement of about 7.74% at F1. The reduced POS tagging reduces the false tagging on long entities, thus increases the F1 value by 2.42% and achieves an F1 score of 80.07%.
The POS feature marked by the reduced POS tagging together with self-matching attention mechanism puts a stranglehold on entity boundaries and has a good performance in the recognition of clinical entities.
Chinese word segmentation (CWS) and part-of-speech (POS) tagging are two fundamental tasks of Chinese text processing. They are usually preliminary steps for lots of Chinese natural language processing (NLP) tasks. There have been a large number of studies on CWS and POS tagging in various domains, however, few studies have been proposed for CWS and POS tagging in the clinical domain as it is not easy to determine granularity of words.
In this paper, we investigated CWS and POS tagging for Chinese clinical text at a fine-granularity level, and manually annotated a corpus. On the corpus, we compared two state-of-the-art methods, i.e., conditional random fields (CRF) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) with a CRF layer. In order to validate the plausibility of the fine-grained annotation, we further investigated the effect of CWS and POS tagging on Chinese clinical named entity recognition (NER) on another independent corpus.
When only CWS was considered, CRF achieved higher precision, recall and F-measure than BiLSTM-CRF. When both CWS and POS tagging were considered, CRF also gained an advantage over BiLSTM. CRF outperformed BiLSTM-CRF by 0.14% in F-measure on CWS and by 0.34% in F-measure on POS tagging. The CWS information brought a greatest improvement of 0.34% in F-measure, while the CWS&amp;POS information brought a greatest improvement of 0.74% in F-measure.
Our proposed fine-grained CWS and POS tagging corpus is reliable and meaningful as the output of the CWS and POS tagging systems developed on this corpus improved the performance of a Chinese clinical NER system on another independent corpus.
Electronic Medical Records(EMRs) contain much medical information about patients. Medical named entity extracting from EMRs can provide value information to support doctors' decision making. The research on information extraction of Chinese Electronic Medical Records is still behind that has done in English.
This paper proposed a practical annotation scheme for medical entity extraction on Resident Admit Notes (RANs), and a model which can automatic extract medical entity. Nine types of clinical entities, four types of clinical relationships were defined in our annotation scheme. An end-to-end deep neural network with convolution neural network and long-short term memory units was applied in our model for the medical named entity recognition(NER).
We annotated RANs in three rounds. The overall F-score of annotation consistency was up to 97.73%. And our NER model on the 255 annotated RANs achieved the best F-score of 91.08%.
The annotation scheme and the model for NER in this paper are effective to extract medical named entity from RANs and provide the basis for fully excavating the patient's information.
Oxaliplatin (L-OHP) is a commonly used first-line chemotherapy for colorectal cancer. Genetic variants in nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway genes may alter genomic integrity and the efficacy of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in colorectal cancer.
We investigated the association between genetic variants in 19 NER pathway genes and the disease control rate (DCR) and progression-free survival (PFS) among 166 colorectal cancer patients who received oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis was performed using the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) portal. Gene harboring significant SNP was overexpressed or knocked down to demonstrate the effect on cell phenotypes with or without oxaliplatin treatment.
We found that rs5030740, located in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of RPA1, was associated with DCR [OR = 2.99 (1.33-5.69), P = 4.00 × 10-3] and PFS [HR = 1.86 (1.30-2.68), P = 7.39 × 10-4]. The C allele was significantly associated with higher RPA1 mRNA expression levels according to eQTL analysis (P = 0.010 for sigmoid colon and P = 0.004 for transverse colon). The C allele of rs5030740 disrupted let-7e-5p binding to enhance RPA1 expression. Functionally, RPA1 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis, whereas RPA1 overexpression promoted proliferation and suppressed apoptosis. Furthermore, low RPA1 expression increased sensitivity to oxaliplatin in colon cancer cells and inhibited proliferation after oxaliplatin treatment.
Our findings demonstrate an association between rs5030740 and the DCR and PFS of colorectal cancer patients. RPA1 functions as a putative oncogene in tumorigenesis by reducing sensitivity to oxaliplatin and could serve as a potential prognostic biomarker in colorectal cancer.
Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is an essential DNA repair pathway devoted to the removal of bulky lesions such as photoproducts induced by the ultraviolet (UV) component of solar radiation. Deficiencies in NER typically result in a group of heterogeneous distinct disorders ranging from the mild UV sensitive syndrome to the cancer-prone xeroderma pigmentosum and the neurodevelopmental/progeroid conditions trichothiodystrophy, Cockayne syndrome and cerebro-oculo-facio-skeletal-syndrome. A complicated genetic scenario underlines these disorders with the same gene linked to different clinical entities as well as different genes associated with the same disease. Overlap syndromes with combined hallmark features of different NER disorders can occur and sporadic presentations showing extra features of the hematological disorder Fanconi Anemia or neurological manifestations mimicking Hungtinton disease-like syndromes have been described. Here, we discuss the multiple functions of the five major pleiotropic NER genes (ERCC3/XPB, ERCC2/XPD, ERCC5/XPG, ERCC1 and ERCC4/XPF) and their relevance in phenotypic complexity. We provide an update of mutational spectra and examine genotype-phenotype relationships. Finally, the molecular defects that could explain the puzzling overlap syndromes are discussed.
Transcription is a potential threat to genome integrity, and transcription-associated DNA damage must be repaired for proper messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis and for cells to transmit their genome intact into progeny. For a wide range of structurally diverse DNA lesions, cells employ the highly conserved nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway to restore their genome back to its native form. Recent evidence suggests that NER factors function, in addition to the canonical DNA repair mechanism, in processes that facilitate mRNA synthesis or shape the 3D chromatin architecture. Here, these findings are critically discussed and a working model that explains the puzzling clinical heterogeneity of NER syndromes highlighting the relevance of physiological, transcription-associated DNA damage to mammalian development and disease is proposed.
Early prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) can effectively prevent later loss of health, and the detection of CVDs risk factors is a simple method to achieve early prevention. Personal health records play a prominent role in the field of health information extraction because of their factuality and reliability. This present study describes how to extract risk factors for CVDs from Chinese electronic medical records (CEMRs).
The extraction process involves two tasks: (a) CVDs risk factor recognition and (b) risk factor time and assertion classification. We considered risk factor recognition as a named entity recognition (NER) task and time and assertion classification as a textual classification task. An information extraction pipeline system consisting of NER and textual classification modules with machine learning models was developed. In the risk factor recognition module, bidirectional long short term memory (BLSTM) with extra risk factor textual feature input was built, as well, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with risk factor type and section label input and support vector machine (SVM) were built for time and assertion classification.
We have achieved the best performance of risk factor recognition with F1 value of 0.9609, time and assertion classification with F1 of 0.9812 and 0.9612, respectively. The experimental results showed that our system achieved a high performance and can extract risk factors from CEMRs efficiently.
The proposed system is the first system for CVDs risk factors extraction from CEMRs and shows competition to risk factor extraction systems that developed on English EMRs. Further, its good performance should have a strong influence on CVDs prevention.
Genomic instability is a feature of multiple myeloma (MM), and impairment in DNA damaging response (DDR) has an established role in disease pathobiology. Indeed, a deregulation of DNA repair pathways may contribute to genomic instability, to the establishment of drug resistance to genotoxic agents, and to the escape from immune surveillance. On these bases, we evaluated the role of different DDR pathways in MM and investigated, for the first time, the direct and immune-mediated anti-MM activity of the nucleotide excision repair (NER)-dependent agent trabectedin.
Gene-expression profiling (GEP) was carried out with HTA2.0 Affymetrix array. Evaluation of apoptosis, cell cycle, and changes in cytokine production and release have been performed in 2D and 3D Matrigel-spheroid models through flow cytometry on MM cell lines and patients-derived primary MM cells exposed to increasing nanomolar concentrations of trabectedin. DNA-damage response has been evaluated through Western blot, immunofluorescence, and DNA fragmentation assay. Trabectedin-induced activation of NK has been assessed by CD107a degranulation. miRNAs quantification has been done through RT-PCR.
By comparing GEP meta-analysis of normal and MM plasma cells (PCs), we observed an enrichment in DNA NER genes in poor prognosis MM. Trabectedin triggered apoptosis in primary MM cells and MM cell lines in both 2D and 3D in vitro assays. Moreover, trabectedin induced DDR activation, cellular stress with ROS production, and cell cycle arrest. Additionally, a significant reduction of MCP1 cytokine and VEGF-A in U266-monocytes co-cultures was observed, confirming the impairment of MM-promoting milieu. Drug-induced cell stress in MM cells led to upregulation of NK activating receptors ligands (i.e., NKG2D), which translated into increased NK activation and degranulation. Mechanistically, this effect was linked to trabectedin-induced inhibition of NKG2D-ligands negative regulators IRF4 and IKZF1, as well as to miR-17 family downregulation in MM cells.
Taken together, our findings indicate a pleiotropic activity of NER-targeting agent trabectedin, which appears a promising candidate for novel anti-MM therapeutic strategies.
Chronic dietary exposure to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), concomitant with hepatitis B infection is associated with a significant increased risk for hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) in people living in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Human exposures to AFB1 occur through the consumption of foods that are contaminated with pervasive molds, including Aspergillus flavus. Even though dietary exposures to aflatoxins constitute the second largest global environmental risk factor for cancer development, there are still significant questions concerning the molecular mechanisms driving carcinogenesis and what factors may modulate an individual's risk for HCC. The objective of this review is to summarize key discoveries that established the association of chronic inflammation (most commonly associated with hepatitis B viral (HBV) infection) and environmental exposures to aflatoxin with increased HCC risk. Special emphasis will be given to recent investigations that have: 1) refined the aflatoxin-associated mutagenic signature, 2) expanded the DNA repair mechanisms that limit mutagenesis via adduct removal prior to replication-induced mutagenesis, 3) implicated a specific DNA polymerase in the error-prone bypass and resulting mutagenesis, and 4) identified human polymorphic variants that may modulate individual susceptibility to aflatoxin-induced cancers. Collectively, these investigations revealed that specific sequence contexts are differentially resistant against, or prone to, aflatoxin-induced mutagenesis and that these associations are remarkably similar between in vitro and in vivo analyses. These recent investigations also established DNA polymerase ζ as the major polymerase that confers the G to T transversion signature. Additionally, although the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway has been previously shown to repair aflatoxin-induced DNA adducts, recent murine data demonstrated that NEIL1-initiated base excision repair was significantly more important than NER relative to the removal of the highly mutagenic AFB1-Fapy-dG adducts. These data suggest that inactivating polymorphic variants of NEIL1 could be a potential driver of HCCs in aflatoxin-exposed populations.
The effects of glycation by glyoxal (Gly) and methylglyoxal (MGly) on the early and late conformational alterations in Cytochrome c (Cyt c) were studied. Spectroscopic measurements revealed that Cyt c undergo certain conformational alterations and exposure of heme upon overnight incubation with Gly and MGly. These were followed by the reduction of heme centre and activation of its peroxidase-like, which is crucial for initiation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. An extended incubation resulted in appearance of AGE-like fluorescence, with significant alterations in secondary structural compositions. However, no amyloidogenic conversions were observed as suggested by TEM analyses. The study provides an insight to the role of glycating agents, elevated under oxidative stress in inducing Cyt c release and apoptosis.
To determine the pupil response of Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) patients for focal blue and red light stimuli presented at 76 test points in a 16.2° visual field (VF) using a chromatic pupilloperimeter.
An observational study was conducted in 16 participants: 7 BVMD patients with a heterozygous BEST1 mutation and 9 similar-aged controls. All participants were tested for best-corrected visual acuity, chromatic pupilloperimetry and Humphrey perimetry. Percentage of pupil contraction (PPC), maximal pupil contraction velocity (MCV) and latency of MCV (LMCV) were determined.
The mean PPC and MCV recorded in BVMD patients in response to red stimuli were lower by &gt;2 standard errors (SEs) from the mean of controls in 47% and 43% of VF test points, respectively. The mean PPC and MCV recorded in the patients in response to blue stimuli were lower by &gt;2 SEs from the mean of controls in 36% and 24% of VF test points, respectively. The patients' mean and median MCV recorded in response to red light correlated with their Humphrey mean deviation score (r=-0.714, P=0.071 and r=-0.821, P=0.023, respectively) and visual acuity (r=0.709, P=0.074 and r=0.655, P=0.111, respectively). A substantially shorter mean LMCV was recorded in BVMD patients compared to controls in 54% and 93% of VF test points in response to red and blue light, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic analysis for LMCV in response to red light identified a test point at the center of the VF with high diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve of 0.94).
Chromatic pupilloperimetry may potentially be used for objective noninvasive assessment of rod and cone cell function in different locations of the retina in BVMD patients.
Cullin 3 (CUL3) is part of the ubiquitin proteasomal system and controls several cellular processes critical for normal organ function including the cell cycle, and Keap1/Nrf2 signaling. Kidney tubule-specific Cul3 disruption causes tubulointerstitial fibrosis, but little is known about the mechanisms. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that dysregulation of the cell cycle and Keap1/Nrf2 pathway play a role in initiating the kidney injury upon Cul3 disruption. Cul3 deletion increased expression of cyclin E and p21, associated with uncontrolled proliferation, DNA damage, and apoptosis, all of which preceded proximal tubule injury. The cdk2-cyclin E inhibitor roscovitine did not prevent the effects of Cul3 deletion, but instead exacerbated the kidney injury. Injury occurred despite accumulation and activation of CUL3 substrate Keap1/Nrf2, proposed to be protective in kidney injury. Cul3 disruption led to progressive interstitial inflammation, functionally relevant renal fibrosis and death. Finally, we observed reduced CUL3 expression in several AKI and CKD mouse models and in fibrotic human kidney tissue. These data establish CUL3 knockout mice as a novel genetic CKD model in which dysregulation of the cell cycle may play a primary role in initiating tubule injury, and that CUL3 dysregulation could contribute to acute and fibrotic kidney disease.
Human homologue of yeast UV excision repair protein Rad23b (HR23B) inclusions are found in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Huntington's disease (HD), spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 and 7 (SCA3/7), fragile X associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we describe HR23B pathology in C9ORF72 linked FTD and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cases. HR23B presented in neuropils, intranuclear inclusions and cytoplasmic and perinuclear inclusions and was predominantly found in cortices (frontal, temporal and motor), spinal cord and hippocampal dentate gyrus. HR23B co-localized with poly-GA-, pTDP-43- and p62-positive inclusions in frontal cortex and in hippocampal dentate gyrus, the latter showing higher co-localization percentages. HR23B binding partners XPC, 20S and ataxin-3, which are involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER) and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), did not show an aberrant distribution. However, C9ORF72 fibroblasts were more sensitive for UV-C damage than healthy control fibroblasts, even though all factors involved in NER localized normally to DNA damage and the efficiency of DNA repair was not reduced. HR23Bs other binding partner NGly1/PNGase, involved in ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of misfolded proteins, was not expressed in the majority of neurons in C9FTD/ALS brain sections compared to non-demented controls. Our results suggest a difference in HR23B aggregation and co-localization pattern with DPRs, pTDP-43 and p62 between different brain areas from C9FTD/ALS cases. We hypothesize that HR23B may play a role in C9ORF72 pathogenesis, possibly by aberrant ERAD functioning.
Diverging semi-isolated lineages either meet in narrow clinal hybrid zones, or have a mosaic distribution associated with environmental variation. Intrinsic reproductive isolation is often emphasized in the former and local adaptation in the latter, although both reduce gene flow between groups. Rarely are these two patterns of spatial distribution reported in the same study system. Here, we report that the long-snouted seahorse Hippocampus guttulatus is subdivided into discrete panmictic entities by both types of hybrid zones. Along the European Atlantic coasts, a northern and a southern lineage meet in the southwest of France where they coexist in sympatry-i.e., in the same geographical zone-with little hybridization. In the Mediterranean Sea, two lineages have a mosaic distribution, associated with lagoon-like and marine habitats. A fifth lineage was identified in the Black Sea. Genetic homogeneity over large spatial scales contrasts with isolation maintained in sympatry or close parapatry at a fine scale. A high variation in locus-specific introgression rates provides additional evidence that partial reproductive isolation must be maintaining the divergence. We find that fixed differences between lagoon and marine populations in the Mediterranean Sea belong to the most differentiated SNPs between the two Atlantic lineages, against the genome-wide pattern of structure that mostly follow geography. These parallel outlier SNPs cluster on a single chromosome-wide island of differentiation. Since Atlantic lineages do not map to lagoon-sea habitat variation, genetic parallelism at the genomic island suggests a shared genetic barrier contributes to reproductive isolation in contrasting contexts-i.e., spatial versus ecological. We discuss how a genomic hotspot of parallel differentiation could have evolved and become associated both with space and with a patchy environment in a single study system.
Cisplatin chemoresistance is a clinical obstacle in the treatment of gastric cancer (GC). Enhanced DNA repair capacity may lead to cisplatin resistance. However, the detailed molecular mechanism of GC cisplatin resistance specifically involving nucleotide excision repair (NER) is not clear. However, the mechanism through which the NER pathway contributes to cisplatin resistance in GC is still unclear. In light of the crucial role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in regulating protein expression and biological behavior, we aimed to analyze the expression and function of miR-192-5p in the NER pathway and its role in cisplatin resistance in GC. Comet assays were performed to measure the amount of DNA damage and repair in the SGC7901 and SGC7901/DDP GC cell lines by observing the tail length. MiRNA expression levels in SGC7901/DDP and SGC7901 cells were detected by microarray. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was carried out to confirm the expression level of miR-192-5p. Lentiviral vector transfection modifies miR-192-5p levels in SGC7901/DDP and SGC7901 cells. The IC50 values of cisplatin-treated cells were assessed by MTT assays. The protein level was determined by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. With enhanced DNA repair, the expression levels of ERCC3 and ERCC4 in SGC 7901DDP cells increased, while miR-192-5p was significantly downregulated in SGC7901/DDP compared with SGC7901 cells. ERCC3 and ERCC4 were identified as the main targets of miR-192-5p. Forced expression of miR-192-5p in SGC7901/DDP cells significantly inhibited the expression of ERCC3 and ERCC4, making GC cells more sensitive to cisplatin in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, knockdown of miR-192-5p expression in SGC7901 cells increased the expression of ERCC3 and ERCC4, resulting in cisplatin resistance in vitro and in vivo. MiR-192-5p partially reversed GC cisplatin resistance by targeting ERCC3 and ERCC4, which participate in the NER pathway, suggesting that miR-192-5p may be a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for GC cisplatin resistance.
Most BioCreative tasks to date have focused on assessing the quality of text-mining annotations in terms of precision and recall. Interoperability, speed, and stability are, however, other important factors to consider for practical applications of text mining. For about a decade, we have run named entity recognition (NER) web services, which are designed to be efficient, implemented using a multi-threaded queueing system to robustly handle many simultaneous requests, and hosted at a supercomputer facility. To participate in this new task, we extended the existing NER tagging service with support for the BeCalm API. The tagger suffered no downtime during the challenge and, as in earlier tests, proved to be highly efficient, consistently processing requests of 5000 abstracts in less than half a minute. In fact, the majority of this time was spent not on the NER task but rather on retrieving the document texts from the challenge servers. The latter was found to be the main bottleneck even when hosting a copy of the tagging service on a Raspberry Pi 3, showing that local document storage or caching would be desirable features to include in future revisions of the API standard.
Esophageal cancer (EC) is a very aggressive tumor, and no reliable prognostic markers exist especially for resectable advanced neoplasia. The principal aim of this study was to investigate the association of germline polymorphisms in nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway genes with the overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced EC. As a second aim, we also studied the association of NER gene variants with response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Among the EC patients referred to our Institution between 2004 and 2012, we selected a cohort of 180 patients diagnosed with a clinical tumor stage ranging from IIB and IVA. Patients were genotyped for four NER variants, two in the ERCC1 (rs11615 and rs3212986) and two in the ERCC2/XPD (rs1799793 and rs13181) genes. Kaplan-Meier analyses and Cox proportional hazards model were used to evaluate the associations of the selected variants with OS; association with response to neoadjuvant therapy was investigated using logistic regression. Results showed that the ERCC1 rs3212986 and the ERCC2/XPD rs1799793 were significantly associated with shorter OS. On the contrary, response association analysis displayed that, while rs11615 and rs3212986 in ERCC1 were associated with response, both ERCC2/XPD variants were not. By creating survival prediction models, we showed that the rs3212986 and the rs1799793 have a better predictability of the tumor stage alone. Furthermore, they were able to improve the power of the clinical model (AUC = 0.660 vs. AUC = 0.548, p = 0.004). In conclusion, our results indicate that the ERCC1 rs3212986 and the ERCC2/XPD rs1799793 could be used as surrogate markers for a better stratification of EC patients with advanced resectable tumor.
DNA damage repair through the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway is one of the major reasons for the decreased antitumor efficacy of platinum-based anticancer drugs that have been widely applied in the clinic. Inhibiting the intrinsic NER function may enhance the antitumor activity of cisplatin and conquer cisplatin resistance. Herein, we report the design, optimization, and application of a self-assembled lipid nanoparticle (LNP) system to simultaneously deliver a cisplatin prodrug together with siRNA targeting endonuclease xeroderma pigmentosum group F (XPF), a crucial component in the NER pathway. The LNP is able to efficiently encapsulate both the platinum prodrug and siRNA molecules with a tuned ratio. Both platinum prodrug and XPF-targeted siRNA are efficiently carried into cells and released; the former damages DNA and the latter specifically downregulates both mRNA and protein levels of XPF to potentiate the platinum drug, leading to enhanced expression levels of apoptosis markers and improved cytotoxicity in both cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant human lung cancer cells. Our results demonstrate an effective approach to utilize a multi-targeted nanoparticle system that can specifically silence an NER-related gene to promote apoptosis induced by cisplatin, especially in cisplatin-refractory tumors.
Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a versatile system that deals with various bulky and helix-distorting DNA lesions caused by UV and environmental mutagens. Based on how lesion recognition occurs, NER has been separated into global genome repair (GGR) and transcription-coupled repair (TCR). The yeast Rad7-Rad16 complex is indispensable for the GGR sub-pathway. Rad7-Rad16 binds to UV-damaged DNA in a synergistic fashion with Rad4, the main lesion recognizer, to achieve efficient recognition of lesions. In addition, Rad7-Rad16 associates with Elc1 and Cul3 to form an EloC-Cul-SOCS-box (ECS)-type E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that ubiquitinates Rad4 in response to UV radiation. However, the structure and architecture of the Rad7-Rad16-Elc1-Cul3 complex remain unsolved. Here, we determined the structure of the Rad7-Elc1 complex and revealed key interaction regions responsible for the formation of the Rad7-Rad16-Elc1-Cul3 complex. These results provide new insights into the assembly of the Rad7-Rad16-Elc1-Cul3 complex and structural framework for further studies.
Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder due to a defect in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) DNA repair pathway, characterized by severe sunburn development of freckles, premature skin aging, and susceptibility to develop cancers at an average age of eight. XP is an example of accelerated photo-aging. It is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous disease. Eight complementation groups have been described worldwide. In Tunisia, five groups have been already identified. In this work, we investigated the genetic etiology in a family with an atypically mild XP phenotype. Two Tunisian siblings born from first-degree consanguineous parents underwent clinical examination in the dermatology department of the Charles Nicolle Hospital on the basis of acute sunburn reaction and mild neurological disorders. Blood samples were collected from two affected siblings after written informed consent. As all mutations reported in Tunisia have been excluded using Sanger sequencing, we carried out mutational analysis through a targeted panel of gene sequencing using the Agilent HaloPlex target enrichment system. Our clinical study shows, in both patients, the presence of achromic macula in sun exposed area with dermatological feature suggestive of Xeroderma pigmentosum disease. No developmental and neurological disorders were observed except mild intellectual disability. Genetic investigation shows that both patients were carriers of an homozygous T to C transition at the nucleotide position c.2333, causing the leucine to proline amino acid change at the position 778 (p.Leu778Pro) of the ERCC5 gene, and resulting in an XP-G phenotype. The same variation was previously reported at the heterozygous state in a patient cell line in Europe, for which no clinical data were available and was suggested to confer an XP/CS phenotype based on functional tests. This study contributes to further characterization of the mutation spectrum of XP in consanguineous Tunisian families and is potentially helpful for early diagnosis. It also indicates that the genotype-phenotype correlation is not always coherent for patients with mild clinical features. These data therefore suggest that targeted NGS is a highly informative diagnostic strategy, which can be used for XP molecular etiology determination.
In recent years, there has been a widespread interest and awareness about health issues posed by endocrine-disrupting chemicals present in the environment. These chemicals, often present in food and many consumer products, can interfere with hormone biosynthesis and metabolism and may result in deviation from normal homeostatic control. Chlorpyrifos (CPF), a major endocrine-disrupting chemical is used worldwide as an agricultural insecticide against a broad spectrum of insect pests in rice cultivation and to control termites. The insecticide mostly undergoes environmental degradation to chlorpyrifos-oxon (CPYO), des-ethyl chlorpyrifos (DEC), 3,5,6-trichloro-2-methoxypyridine (TMP) and 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP). Results from several epidemiological studies suggest that exposure to CPF can result in reproductive disorders, including infertility in male and female. Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is a circulatory protein that binds sex steroids and is a potential target for endocrine disruptors in the human body. The objective of the present study involved computational approaches to apprehend the mechanism of molecular interaction of CPF and its four degradation products (CPYO, DEC, TMP, TCP) with human SHBG using molecular docking simulation. All five compounds (CPF, CPYO, DEC, TMP, TCP) showed high binding affinity with SHBG; however, the binding affinity values were higher (more negative) for CPF, CPYO, DEC and TMP than for TCP indicating that CPF, CPYO, DEC and TMP formed a tight interaction with SHBG. From the results obtained with the docking analysis, it can be opined that CPF, CPYO, DEC and TMP could possibly act as potential endocrine disruptors for androgen signaling.
Twelve patients with reflex sympathetic dystrophy were referred to a comprehensive orthopaedic rehabilitation center after failure of conservative management. Ten underwent amputation of the affected limb and, although functional improvement occurred in the patients undergoing lower limb amputation, psychosocial dysfunction persisted. All the patients required psychological support. In cases of post-Sudeck amputation, early orthopaedic diagnosis and referral to a comprehensive treatment center are recommended. In the 12 cases described here, apart from the obvious limb pathology, severe psychological inadequacies were found to be present.
Recent reports suggest that oestrogen receptors detected in the cytosolic fraction of homogenized human breast tumours might be mainly nuclear receptor released into the cytoplasm during tissue processing. This study thus compares the tumour content of steroid hormone receptors in conventional cytosolic receptor assays with direct measurements of receptor in the cell nucleus. Unoccupied cytoplasmic oestrogen receptors (cER), cytoplasmic progesterone receptors (cPR) and total (occupied plus unoccupied) nuclear oestrogen receptors (nER) have been measured in parallel in human breast tumour tissue using biochemical radioreceptor assay. Of 125 tumours, 62% and 61% were positive for cER and cPR, respectively, 50% contained nER with high affinity for oestradiol (nER I) and 13% expressed nER with low affinity for oestradiol (nER II). The concentration of cER correlated significantly with age, cPR and log nER I. A significant proportion of tumours which were positive for both cytosol receptors also possessed nuclear receptors with high and low affinity for oestrogen. It is possible that this group of tumours which are positive for cER, cPR, nER I and nER II will respond well to hormone therapy.
NER, a new member of the steroid hormone nuclear receptor (NR)-encoding gene family, was isolated from a human osteosarcoma SAOS/B10 cell line cDNA library. NER codes for a polypeptide of 461 amino acids which contains the conserved sequences of the DNA-binding and ligand-binding domains of typical steroid hormone NR. It has highest homology with the retinoic acid receptors: 55% at the DNA-binding domain and 38-40% at the ligand-binding domain. A single transcript of 2.3 kb was detected in all cells and tissues tested. Although no ligand was identified for NER-I, its wide distribution may indicate that this novel steroid hormone NR may play a basic role in cell function.
Nucleotide excision repair (NER) removes many different types of DNA lesions. Most NER proteins are indispensable for repair. In contrast, the yeast Rad23 represents a class of accessory NER proteins, without which NER activity is reduced but not eliminated. In mammals, the complex of HR23B (Rad23 homolog) and XPC (yeast Rad4 homolog) has been suggested to function in the damage recognition step of NER. However, the precise function of Rad23 or HR23B in NER remains unknown. Recently, it was suggested that the primary function of RAD23 protein in NER is its stabilization of XPC protein. Here, we tested the significance of Rad23-mediated Rad4 stabilization in NER, and analyzed the repair and biochemical activities of purified yeast Rad23 protein. Cellular Rad4 was indeed stabilized by Rad23 in the absence of DNA damage. Persistent overexpression of Rad4 in rad23 mutant cells, however, largely failed to complement the ultraviolet sensitivity of the mutant. Consistently, deficient NER in rad23 mutant cell extracts could not be complemented by purified Rad4 protein in vitro. In contrast, partial complementation was observed with purified Rad23 protein. Specific complementation to the level of wild-type repair was achieved by adding purified Rad23 together with small amounts of Rad4 protein to rad23 mutant cell extracts. Purified Rad23 protein was unable to bind to DNA, but stimulated the binding activity of purified Rad4 protein to N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene-damaged DNA. These results support two roles of Rad23 protein in NER: (i) its direct participation in the repair biochemistry, possibly due to its stimulatory activity on Rad4-mediated damage binding/recognition; and (ii) its stabilization of cellular Rad4 protein.
Accumulation of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients has been postulated to reflect defects in Aβ degradation or clearance. Here, we selected 12 genes (MMEL1, ECE1, ECE2, AGER, PLG, PLAT, NR1H3, MMP3, LRP1, TTR, NR1H2, and MMP9) involved in Aβ catabolism on the basis of PubMed-based literature search and elucidated their genetic role in AD among Finnish case-control cohort consisting of total ∼1,300 AD patients and control subjects. Thirty one single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected for genotyping. In a smaller subset of AD patients, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of Aβ42 (n = 124), total-tau (n = 59), and phospho-tau (n = 54) analyses were performed with respect to SNPs. Moreover, age of onset analyses with respect to the studied SNPs were conducted among the AD patient cohort (n = 642). Association analysis of the liver X receptor α (NR1H3) gene SNPs showed a protective effect for C allele carriers of rs7120118 (OR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.53-0.93), while the total-tau and phospho-tau levels in CSF were decreased in AD patients carrying the C allele. Also, a decrease in the age of onset was observed in AD patients carrying the A allele of rs723744 and the C allele of rs3794884 in transthyretin (TTR) gene. However, after adjusting the p-values for multiple comparisons, these results were not statistically significant, suggesting that genetic variations in MMEL1, ECE1, ECE2, AGER, PLG, PLAT, NR1H3, MMP3, LRP1, TTR, NR1H2, and MMP9 genes do not play major role among the Finnish AD patient cohort.
High cholesterol levels are associated with prostate cancer development. Androgens promote cholesterol accumulation by activating the sterol-regulatory element-binding protein isoform 2 (SREBP-2) transcription factor. However, SREBP-2 is in balance with the liver X receptor (LXR; NR1H2/NR1H3), a transcription factor that prevents cholesterol accumulation. Here, we show that LXR activity is down-regulated by the androgen receptor (AR; NR3C4). In turn, this reduces LXR target gene expression. This antagonism on LXR is also exerted by other steroid hormone receptors, including the estrogen, glucocorticoid, and progesterone receptors. This suggests a generalizable mechanism, but the AR does not affect LXR mRNA levels, protein degradation, or DNA binding. We also found that the AR does not require protein synthesis to influence LXR, suggesting a direct antagonism. However, the AR does not directly bind LXR. The AR N-terminal domain (involved in transactivation), but not its DNA-binding domain, is required to suppress LXR activity, suggesting coactivator competition. Overall, this androgen-mediated antagonism of LXR complements SREBP-2 activation, providing a more complete picture as to how androgens increase cellular cholesterol levels in a prostate cancer setting. Given the cross-talk between other steroid hormone receptors and LXR, hormonal regulation of cholesterol via LXR may occur in a variety of cellular contexts.
To investigate the contribution of polymorphisms in nuclear receptors to risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
Genotypes of nuclear factor (NF)-κB (NFKB1) NFκB -94ins/del (rs28362491); peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ (PPARγ) PPARγ Pro12Ala (rs 1801282) and C1431T (rs 3856806); pregnane X receptor (PXR) (NR1I2) PXR A-24381C (rs1523127), C8055T (2276707), and A7635G (rs 6785049); and liver X receptor (LXR) (NR1H2) LXR T-rs1405655-C and T-rs2695121-C were assessed in a Danish case-control study of 327 Crohn's disease patients, 495 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, and 779 healthy controls. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI were estimated by logistic regression models.
The PXR A7635G variant, the PPARγ Pro12Ala and LXR T-rs2695121-C homozygous variant genotypes were associated with risk of UC (OR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.03-1.66, P = 0.03, OR: 2.30, 95% CI: 1.04-5.08, P = 0.04, and OR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.00-1.98, P = 0.05, respectively) compared to the corresponding homozygous wild-type genotypes. Among never smokers, PXR A7635G and the LXR T-rs1405655-C and T-rs2695121-C variant genotypes were associated with risk of IBD (OR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.05-1.91, P = 0.02, OR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.21-2.20, P = 0.001, and OR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.36-2.99, P = 0.0005, respectively) compared to the respective homozygous variant genotypes. PXR A7635G (rs6785049) variant genotype was associated with a higher risk of UC diagnosis before the age of 40 years and with a higher risk of extensive disease (OR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.03-1.75 and OR: 2.49, 95% CI: 1.24-5.03, respectively).
Common PXR and LXR polymorphisms may contribute to risk of IBD, especially among never smokers.
The liver X receptors (LXRs)-α and -β play a crucial role in control of insulin production and secretion in pancreatic β-cells. We hypothesized that common variants in the NR1H2 and NR1H3 genes, encoding LXR-β and -α, respectively, may alter pancreatic β-cell function. One thousand five hundred seventy-four subjects of European ancestry with elevated risk for type 2 diabetes were genotyped for the two NR1H2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs2248949 and rs1405655 and for the four NR1H3 SNPs rs11039149, rs3758673, rs12221497 and rs2279238, and association studies with metabolic traits were performed. Metabolic characterization comprised an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in all participants and, in addition, a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) in subsets. One hundred per cent of common genetic variation (minor allele frequency ≥1%) within the NR1H2 and NR1H3 loci (D' = 1.0; r² ≥ 0.8) were covered by the six chosen tagging SNPs. NR1H2 rs2248949 was nominally associated with OGTT-derived first-phase insulin secretion and proinsulin conversion to insulin and significantly associated with the AUC of insulin levels during the IVGTT (p = 0.007) after adjustment for age, gender, BMI and insulin sensitivity in the dominant model, with the minor allele conferring reduced pancreatic β-cell function to the carriers. In subjects of European ancestry at increased risk for type 2 diabetes, common variation within the NR1H2 gene impaired insulin secretion, which may facilitate the development of type 2 diabetes.
The oxysterol nuclear receptors, LXRα (liver X receptor α; NR1H3) and LXRβ (NR1H2), coordinately regulate the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism, anti-inflammation, and cholesterol transport. Previous studies have demonstrated that ligands of LXRα are important in the maintenance of the normal epidermal barrier function and keratinocyte differentiation. In this study, we examined whether LXRα and its ligands regulate lipid synthesis in HaCaT cells, a spontaneously transformed human keratinocyte cell line. When HaCaT cells were treated with the LXRα ligand TO901317, lipid droplets accumulated in the majority of cells, which were stained by Oil Red O. A luciferase reporter construct containing the LXR response element was activated about fourfold in HaCaT cells by TO901317 treatment, suggesting that LXR has a role in lipid synthesis in these cells. The expression of LXRα target genes, such as those encoding sterol regulatory binding protein and fatty acid synthase, were induced time dependently by TO901317, as measured by RT-PCR and western blotting. The expression of PPAR-α, -β, and -γ which regulate lipid metabolism, was also increased by TO901317 treatment. In contrast, TO901317 reduced the lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of cyclooxygenase 2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase in HaCaT cells. These results indicate that LXRα activation leads to lipogenesis in keratinocytes, which may enhance the epidermal barrier function of the skin.
The ATP-binding cassette transporters, ABCA1 and ABCG1, are LXR-target genes that play an important role in reverse cholesterol transport. We examined the effects of inhibitors of the cholesterol absorption (ezetimibe) and synthesis (statins) on expression of these transporters in HepG2 cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of individuals with primary (and nonfamilial) hypercholesterolemia (HC).
A total of 48 HC individuals were treated with atorvastatin (10 mg/day/4 weeks) and 23 were treated with ezetimibe (10 mg/day/4 weeks), followed by simvastatin (10 mg/day/8 weeks) and simvastatin plus ezetimibe (10 mg of each/day/4 weeks). Gene expression was examined in statin- or ezetimibe-treated and control HepG2 cells as well as PBMCs using real-time PCR.
In PBMCs, statins and ezetimibe downregulated ABCA1 and ABCG1 mRNA expression but did not modulate NR1H2 (LXR-β) and NR1H3 (LXR-α) levels. Positive correlations of ABCA1 with ABCG1 and of NR1H2 with NR1H3 expressions were found in all phases of the treatments. In HepG2 cells, ABCA1 mRNA levels remained unaltered while ABCG1 expression was increased by statin (1.0-10.0 µM) or ezetimibe (5.0 µM) treatments. Atorvastatin upregulated NR1H2 and NR1H3 only at 10.0 µM, meanwhile ezetimibe (1.0-5.0 µM) downregulated NR1H2 but did not change NR1H3 expression.
Our findings reveal that lipid-lowering drugs downregulate ABCA1 and ABCG1 mRNA expression in PBMCs of HC individuals and exhibit differential effects on HepG2 cells. Moreover, they indicate that the ABCA1 and ABCG1 transcript levels were not correlated directly to LXR mRNA expression in both cell models treated with lipid-lowering drugs.
Nuclear receptor crosstalk represents an important mechanism to expand the functions of individual receptors. The liver X receptors (LXR, NR1H2/3), both the α and β isoforms, are nuclear receptors that can be activated by the endogenous oxysterols and other synthetic agonists. LXRs function as cholesterol sensors, which protect mammals from cholesterol overload. LXRs have been shown to regulate the expression of a battery of metabolic genes, especially those involved in lipid metabolism. LXRs have recently been suggested to play a novel role in the regulation of drug metabolism. The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, NR1I3) is a xenobiotic receptor that regulates the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters. Disruption of CAR alters sensitivity to toxins, increasing or decreasing it depending on the compounds. More recently, additional roles for CAR have been discovered. These include the involvement of CAR in lipid metabolism. Mechanistically, CAR forms an intricate regulatory network with other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, foremost the LXRs, in exerting its effect on lipid metabolism. Retinoid-related orphan receptors (RORs, NR1F1/2/3) have three isoforms, α, β and γ. Recent reports have shown that loss of RORα and/or RORγ can positively or negatively influence the expression of multiple drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters in the liver. The effects of RORs on expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes were reasoned to be, at least in part, due to the crosstalk with LXR. This review focuses on the CAR-LXR and ROR-LXR crosstalk, and the implications of this crosstalk in drug metabolism and lipid metabolism.
In addition to their role in dietary lipid absorption bile acids are signaling modules activating nuclear receptors and at least one G-protein coupled receptors named the TGR5. With a different rank of potency primary and secondary bile acids activates a subset of nuclear receptors including the farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR, NR1H4); the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, NR1H3), the pregnane-x- receptor (PXR, NR1H2), the vitamin D receptor (VDR, NR1H1). Originally, these receptors were characterized for their role as bile acid and xenobiotic sensors, emerging evidence, however, indicates that FXR, PXR and VDR and their ligands are important for the modulation of immune and inflammatory reactions in entero-hepatic tissues. The immune phenotype FXR deficient mice indicates that these receptors are essential for the maintenance of immune homeostasis. A common theme of all bile acid-activated receptor is their ability to counter-regulate effector activities of cells of innate immunity establishing that signals generated by these receptors and their ligands function as a braking signals for inflammation in entero-hepatic tissues. In this review, we will spotlight the molecular mechanisms of receptor/ligand function and how bile acid-activated receptors regulate the innate immunity in the gastrointestinal tract and liver. The ability of these receptors to integrate metabolic and inflammatory signaling makes them particularly attractive targets for intervention in immune-mediated diseases.
Steroids are small molecule hormones derived from cholesterol. Steroids affect many tissues, including the brain. In the zebra finch, estrogenic steroids are particularly interesting because they masculinize the neural circuit that controls singing and their synthesis in the brain is modulated by experience. Here, we analyzed the zebra finch genome assembly to assess the content, conservation, and organization of genes that code for components of the estrogen-synthetic pathway and steroid nuclear receptors. Based on these analyses, we also investigated neural expression of a cholesterol transport protein gene in the context of song neurobiology.
We present sequence-based analysis of twenty steroid-related genes using the genome assembly and other resources. Generally, zebra finch genes showed high homology to genes in other species. The diversity of steroidogenic enzymes and receptors may be lower in songbirds than in mammals; we were unable to identify all known mammalian isoforms of the 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase families in the zebra finch genome assembly, and not all splice sites described in mammals were identified in the corresponding zebra finch genes. We did identify two factors, Nobox and NR1H2-RXR, that may be important for coordinated transcription of multiple steroid-related genes. We found very little qualitative overlap in predicted transcription factor binding sites in the genes for two cholesterol transport proteins, the 18 kDa cholesterol transport protein (TSPO) and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR). We therefore performed in situ hybridization for TSPO and found that its mRNA was not always detected in brain regions where StAR and steroidogenic enzymes were previously shown to be expressed. Also, transcription of TSPO, but not StAR, may be regulated by the experience of hearing song.
The genes required for estradiol synthesis and action are represented in the zebra finch genome assembly, though the complement of steroidogenic genes may be smaller in birds than in mammals. Coordinated transcription of multiple steroidogenic genes is possible, but results were inconsistent with the hypothesis that StAR and TSPO mRNAs are co-regulated. Integration of genomic and neuroanatomical analyses will continue to provide insights into the evolution and function of steroidogenesis in the songbird brain.
Tertiary sulfonamides were identified in a HTS as dual liver X receptor (LXR, NR1H2, and NR1H3) ligands, and the binding affinity of the series was increased through iterative analogue synthesis. A ligand-bound cocrystal structure was determined which elucidated key interactions for high binding affinity. Further characterization of the tertiary sulfonamide series led to the identification of high affinity LXR antagonists. GSK2033 (17) is the first potent cell-active LXR antagonist described to date. 17 may be a useful chemical probe to explore the cell biology of this orphan nuclear receptor.
The retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptors alpha and gamma (RORalpha [NR1F1] and RORgamma [NR1F3]) are members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. These 2 receptors regulate many physiological processes including development, metabolism and immunity. We recently found that certain oxysterols, namely the 7-substituted oxysterols, bound to the ligand binding domains (LBDs) of RORalpha and RORgamma with high affinity, altered the LBD conformation and reduced coactivator binding resulting in suppression of the constitutive transcriptional activity of these two receptors. Here, we show that another oxysterol, 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-OHC), is also a high affinity ligand for RORalpha and RORgamma (K(i) approximately 25 nM). 24S-OHC is also known as cerebrosterol due to its high level in the brain where it plays an essential role as an intermediate in cholesterol elimination from the CNS. 24S-OHC functions as a RORalpha/gamma inverse agonist suppressing the constitutive transcriptional activity of these receptors in cotransfection assays. Additionally, 24S-OHC suppressed the expression of several RORalpha target genes including BMAL1 and REV-ERBalpha in a ROR-dependent manner. We also demonstrate that 24S-OHC decreases the ability of RORalpha to recruit the coactivator SRC-2 when bound to the BMAL1 promoter. We also noted that 24(S), 25-epoxycholesterol selectively suppressed the activity of RORgamma. These data indicate that RORalpha and RORgamma may serve as sensors of oxsterols. Thus, RORalpha and RORgamma display an overlapping ligand preference with another class of oxysterol nuclear receptors, the liver X receptors (LXRalpha [NR1H3] and LXRbeta [NR1H2]).
The liver X receptors (LXRs) are nuclear receptors that are activated by endogenous oxysterols, oxidized derivatives of cholesterol. There are two isoforms of LXR, LXRalpha (NR1H3) and LXRbeta (NR1H2). Both LXRalpha and LXRbeta regulate gene expression by binding to DNA sequences associated with target genes as heterodimers with isoforms of the retinoid X receptor (RXR), RXRalpha (NR2B1), RXRbeta (NR2B2), and RXRgamma (NR2B3). LXRs act as cholesterol sensors: when cellular oxysterols accumulate as a result of increasing concentrations of cholesterol, LXR induces the transcription of genes that protect cells from cholesterol overload. In this review, we summarize the roles of LXRs in controlling cholesterol homeostasis, including their roles in bile acid synthesis and metabolism/excretion, reverse cholesterol transport, cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake, and cholesterol absorption/excretion in the intestine. The overlapping and distinct roles of the LXRalpha and LXRbeta isoforms, and the potential use of LXRs as attractive targets for treatment of cardiovascular disease are also discussed.
The cessation of progesterone (P(4)) production (i.e. functional regression), arguably the key event in luteolysis of the primate corpus luteum (CL), is poorly understood. Previously, we found that genes encoding proteins involved in cholesterol uptake decreased, while those involved in cholesterol efflux (reverse cholesterol transport, RCT) increased in expression during spontaneous functional regression of the rhesus macaque CL, thereby potentially depleting the cholesterol reserves needed for steroidogenesis. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of the components necessary for RCT was performed. RCT components were expressed (mRNA and/or protein) in the macaque CL including cholesterol sensors (liver X receptors alpha or NR1H3; and beta or NR1H2), efflux proteins (ATP-binding cassette subfamilies A1 (ABCA1) and G1), acceptors (apolipoproteins A1 or APOA1; and E or APOE), and plasma proteins facilitating high-density lipoprotein formation (lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase or LCAT; phospholipid transfer protein or PLTP). ABCA1, APOE, PLTP, and NR1H3 increased, while lipoprotein receptors decreased, in expression (mRNA and/or protein) through the period of functional regression. The expression of APOA1 and APOE, as well as NR1H3, was greatest in the CL and tissues involved in regulating cholesterol homeostasis. Immunolocalization studies revealed that RCT proteins and lipoprotein receptors were expressed in large luteal cells, which possess intracellular cholesterol reserves during periods of P(4) synthesis. Lipid staining revealed changes in luteal cholesterol ester/lipid distribution that occurred following functional regression. These results indicate that decreased cholesterol uptake and increased RCT may be critical for the initiation of primate luteolysis by limiting intracellular cholesterol pools required for steroidogenesis.
The gene expression of 182 cardiovascular candidate genes was measured in high quality groups of individuals (n = 20) by microarrays to determine whether a subset of genes would discriminate obese and hypertensive individuals, in spite of the existence of a close link between these two cardiovascular risk factors.
The results were validated on the 20 subjects used for microarray analysis and on 62 additional individuals by real-time PCR.
The first analysis, where patient groups were compared with healthy subjects, revealed 15 out of 182 genes that differed in hypertensive, obese or obesity-related hypertensive individuals. These genes were ALOX5, APOA2, SELL, RGS2, CD14, FPR1, CAMP, DEFA3, DEFA4, CBS, CHRM1, ICAM1, NR1H2, SCNN1B and TGFB1. A second analysis was carried out in which patient groups were compared with each other, demonstrating FPR1 and DEFA3 as being significant genes discriminating patient groups. Furthermore, an analysis stratified by sex revealed that, with the exception of DEFA3, there are no other common genes between men and women.
We were able to indentify a number of interesting genes that distinguish patient and healthy subject groups as well as patient groups between them.
In addition, it seems that gender plays an important role, at least for some of the genes we tested. These findings may have important implications in the screening and etiology of hypertension or obesity, and could further help to focus on these specific mRNAs as antisense therapy targets.
We used a systems biology-based approach to investigate the basis of cell-specific expression of the water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2) in the renal collecting duct. Computational analysis of the 5'-flanking region of the AQP2 gene (Genomatix) revealed 2 conserved clusters of putative transcriptional regulator (TR) binding elements (BEs) centered at -513 bp (corresponding to the SF1, NFAT, and FKHD TR families) and -224 bp (corresponding to the AP2, SRF, CREB, GATA, and HOX TR families). Three other conserved motifs corresponded to the ETS, EBOX, and RXR TR families. To identify TRs that potentially bind to these BEs, we carried out mRNA profiling (Affymetrix) in mouse mpkCCDc14 collecting duct cells, revealing expression of 25 TRs that are also expressed in native inner medullary collecting duct. One showed a significant positive correlation with AQP2 mRNA abundance among mpkCCD subclones (Ets1), and 2 showed a significant negative correlation (Elf1 and an orphan nuclear receptor Nr1h2). Transcriptomic profiling in native proximal tubules (PT), medullary thick ascending limbs (MTAL), and IMCDs from kidney identified 14 TRs (including Ets1 and HoxD3) expressed in the IMCD but not PT or MTAL (candidate AQP2 enhancer roles), and 5 TRs (including HoxA5, HoxA9 and HoxA10) expressed in PT and MTAL but not in IMCD (candidate AQP2 repressor roles). In luciferase reporter assays, overexpression of 3 ETS family TRs transactivated the mouse proximal AQP2 promoter. The results implicate ETS family TRs in cell-specific expression of AQP2 and point to HOX, RXR, CREB and GATA family TRs as playing likely additional roles.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are important transcriptional regulators of lipid homeostasis and proliferation in several cell types. However, the roles of LXRs in pancreatic beta cells have not been fully established. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of LXRs on pancreatic beta cell proliferation.
Gene expression was analysed using real-time RT-PCR. Transient transfection and reporter gene assays were used to determine the transcriptional activity of LXRs in pancreatic beta cells. Cell viability and proliferation were analysed using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), DNA fluorometric, BrdU labelling and [(3)H]thymidine incorporation assays. Cell cycle distribution was investigated by flow cytometry analysis. Adenovirus-based RNA interference was used to knockdown LXRalpha, LXRbeta and p27 in MIN6 cells and mouse islets.
We found that both Lxralpha (also known as Nr1h3) and Lxrbeta (also known as Nr1h2) were expressed and transactivated the LXR response element in HIT-T15 and MIN6 cells. Activation of LXRs dose-dependently inhibited pancreatic beta cell viability and proliferation. This was accompanied by beta cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. Furthermore, LXR activation increased levels of the p27 protein by inhibiting its degradation. Knockdown of p27 reversed these effects of LXR activation on growth inhibition and cell cycle arrest.
Our observations indicate that LXR activation inhibits pancreatic beta cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest. A well-known regulator of pancreatic beta cell cycle progression, p27, is upregulated and mediates the effects of LXRs on growth inhibition in beta cells. These observations suggest the involvement of aberrant activation of LXR in beta cell mass inadequacy, which is an important step in the development of type 2 diabetes.
Cholesterol is critical for several cellular functions and essential for normal fetal development. Therefore, its metabolism is tightly controlled during all life stages. The liver X receptors-alpha (LXRalpha; NR1H3) and -beta (LXRbeta; NR1H2) are nuclear receptors that are of key relevance in coordinating cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether fetal cholesterol metabolism can be influenced in utero via pharmacological activation of LXR and whether this would have long-term effects on cholesterol homeostasis. Administration of the LXR agonist T0901317 to pregnant mice via their diet (0.015% wt/wt) led to induced fetal hepatic expression levels of the cholesterol transporter genes Abcg5/g8 and Abca1, higher plasma cholesterol levels, and lower hepatic cholesterol levels compared with controls. These profound changes during fetal development did not affect cholesterol metabolism in adulthood nor did they influence coping with a high-fat/high-cholesterol diet. This study shows that the LXR system is functional in fetal mice and susceptible to pharmacological activation. Despite massive changes in fetal cholesterol metabolism, regulatory mechanisms involved in cholesterol metabolism return to a "normal" state in offspring and allow coping with a high-fat/high-cholesterol diet.
Liver X Receptor-α (LXRα, also known as NR1H3) and LXRβ (NR1H2) are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors, a superfamily which includes the more widely known glucocorticoid receptor, estrogen receptor, thyroid receptor, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. The LXRs are activated by physiologic sterol ligands (e.g., oxysterols) and by synthetic agonists. In recent years, our understanding of the importance of LXRs has expanded across several fields of (patho-)physiology. Perhaps best known from a sizeable literature as homeostatic 'cholesterol sensors' that drive transcriptional programs promoting cellular cholesterol efflux, 'reverse cholesterol transport,' and bile acid synthesis, more recent roles for LXRs in glucose homeostasis, atherosclerosis, and innate immunity have also been identified. These discoveries complement an emerging literature that continues to draw surprisingly intimate connections between host metabolism and host defense. The present review will discuss the roles of LXR in the signaling of metabolism and innate immunity, and the potential for synthetic LXR agonists as novel therapeutics in dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, disordered glucose metabolism, and inflammation.
Human implantation involves invasion of the uterine wall and remodeling of uterine arteries by extravillous cytotrophoblasts. Defects in these early steps of placental development lead to poor placentation and are often associated with preeclampsia, a frequent complication of human pregnancy. One of the complex mechanisms controlling trophoblast invasion involves the activation of the liver X receptor beta (or NR1H2, more commonly known as LXRbeta) by oxysterols known as potent LXR activators. This activation of LXRbeta leads to a decrease of trophoblast invasion. The identification of new target genes of LXR in the placenta could aid in the understanding of their physiological roles in trophoblast invasion. In the present study, we show that the endoglin (ENG) gene is a direct target of the liver X receptor alpha (NR1H3, also known as LXRalpha). ENG, whose gene is highly expressed in syncytiotrophoblasts, is part of the transforming growth factor (TGF) receptor complex that binds several members of the TGFbeta superfamily. In the human placenta, ENG has been shown to be involved in the inhibition of trophoblast invasion. Treatment of human choriocarcinoma JAR cells with T0901317, a synthetic LXR-selective agonist, leads to a significant increase in ENG mRNA and protein levels. Using transfection and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we demonstrate that LXR (as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor) is able to bind the ENG promoter on an LXR response element and mediates the activation of ENG gene expression by LXRalpha in JAR cells. This study suggests a novel mechanism by which LXR may regulate trophoblast invasion in pathological pregnancy such as preeclampsia.
Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is a multisystem disorder caused primarily by a mutation in the npc1 gene. These studies evaluated the effect of genetic background, deletion of additional genes, and administration of several agents on the age at death in a murine model of this disorder. Such factors as differing strain background or genetic drift within a given background in the npc1(-/-) mouse significantly altered the age at death and the degree of organ disease. Genetic deletion of Siat9 (GM3 synthetase) or Nr1h2 [liver X receptor (LXR)beta] shortened the life of the npc1(-/-) animals. Daily treatment of the npc1(-/-) mice with an LXR agonist or administration of a single dose of cyclodextrin, with or without the neurosteroid allopregnanolone, significantly slowed neurodegeneration and increased the lifespan of these animals. These data illustrate that the age at death of the npc1(-/-) mouse can be significantly influenced by many factors, including differences in strain background, other inactivating gene mutations (Siat9 and lxrbeta), and administration of agents such as LXR agonists and, particularly, cyclodextrin. It is currently not clear which of these effects is nonspecific or which might relate directly to the molecular defect present in the NPC1 syndrome.
The liver X receptors, LXRalpha (NR1H3) and LXRbeta (NR1H2), are ligand-activated transcription factors that belong to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. LXRs play a critical role in cholesterol homeostasis and bile acid metabolism. In addition, oral administration of LXR agonists to mice results in elevated hepatic fatty acid synthesis and steatosis and increased secretion of triglyceride-rich very low density lipoprotein resulting in hypertriglyceridemia. This increased hepatic lipogenesis has been largely attributed to the LXR-dependent up-regulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) expression. However, it has been reported that treating Srebp-1c null mice with the synthetic LXR agonist T0901317 still results in enhanced expression of many lipogenic genes, suggesting additional mechanisms by which LXR can enhance hepatic lipogenesis. In this report, we identify the carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) as an LXR target that independently enhances the up-regulation of select lipogenic genes. The ChREBP promoter contains functional LXR-binding sites that confer receptor-dependent binding and transactivation. We show that T0901317 treatment of mice is associated with up-regulation of the ChREBP target gene, liver-type pyruvate kinase. Therefore, activation of LXR not only increases ChREBP mRNA via enhanced transcription but also modulates ChREBP activity. This establishes LXR as a master lipogenic transcription factor, as it directly regulates both SREBP-1c and ChREBP to enhance hepatic fatty acid synthesis.
The small heterodimer partner SHP (NR0B2) is an unusual nuclear receptor that lacks the typical DNA binding domain common to most nuclear receptors. SHP has been reported to act as a corepressor for several nuclear receptors, but its exact mechanism of action is still elusive. Here we show that SHP can interact with the liver X receptors LXRalpha (NR1H3) and LXRbeta (NR1H2), as demonstrated by glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assays, mammalian two-hybrid, and coimmunoprecipitation experiments. In transfection assays, SHP inhibits the expression of an artificial reporter driven by an LXR-response element and represses the transcriptional activation by LXR of the human ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1) promoter. Treatment of Caco-2 cells with bile acids, which activate farnesoid X receptor and subsequently induce SHP, leads to the repression of the human ABCG1 gene, an established LXR target gene. These results demonstrate that SHP is able to interact with LXR and to modulate its transcriptional activity.
The nuclear oxysterol receptors liver X receptor-alpha [LXRalpha (NR1H3)] and LXRbeta (NR1H2) coordinately regulate genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Although both LXR subtypes are expressed in the brain, their roles in this tissue remain largely unexplored. In this report, we show that LXR agonists have marked effects on gene expression in murine brain tissue both in vitro and in vivo. In primary astrocyte cultures, LXR agonists regulated several established LXR target genes, including ATP binding cassette transporter A1, and enhanced cholesterol efflux. In contrast, little or no effect on gene expression or cholesterol efflux was detected in primary neuronal cultures. Treatment of mice with a selective LXR agonist resulted in the induction of several LXR target genes related to cholesterol homeostasis in the cerebellum and hippocampus. These data provide the first evidence that the LXRs regulate cholesterol homeostasis in the central nervous system. Because dysregulation of cholesterol balance is implicated in central nervous system diseases such as Alzheimer's and Niemann-Pick disease, pharmacological manipulation of the LXRs may prove beneficial in the treatment of these disorders.
During the last three years there have been a plethora of publications on the liver X-activated receptors (LXRalpha, NR1H3, and LXRbeta, NR1H2), the farnesoid X-activated receptor (FXR, NR1H4), and the pregnane X receptor (PXR, NR1I2) and the role these nuclear receptors play in controlling cholesterol, bile acid, lipoprotein and drug metabolism. The current interest in these nuclear receptors is high, in part, because they appear to be promising therapeutic targets for new drugs that have the potential to control lipid homeostasis. In this review we emphasize i) the role of LXR in controlling many aspects of cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, ii) the expanded role of FXR in regulating genes that control not only bile acid metabolism but also lipoprotein metabolism, and iii) the regulation of bile acid transport/metabolism in response to bile acid-activated PXR.
The LXR nuclear receptors are intracellular sensors of cholesterol excess and are activated by various oxysterols. LXRs have been shown to regulate multiple genes of lipid metabolism, including ABCA1 (formerly known as ABC1). ABCA1 is a lipid pump that effluxes cholesterol and phospholipid out of cells. ABCA1 deficiency causes extremely low high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, demonstrating the importance of ABCA1 in the formation of HDL. The present work shows that the acetyl-podocarpic dimer (APD) is a potent, selective agonist for both LXRalpha (NR1H3) and LXRbeta (NR1H2). In transient transactivation assays, APD was approximately 1000-fold more potent, and yielded approximately 6-fold greater maximal stimulation, than the widely used LXR agonist 22-(R)-hydroxycholesterol. APD induced ABCA1 mRNA levels, and increased efflux of both cholesterol and phospholipid, from multiple cell types. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry measurements demonstrated that APD stimulated efflux of endogenous cholesterol, eliminating any possible artifacts of cholesterol labeling. For both mRNA induction and stimulation of cholesterol efflux, APD was found to be more effective than was cholesterol loading. Taken together, these data show that APD is a more effective LXR agonist than endogenous oxysterols. LXR agonists may therefore be useful for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis, especially in the context of low HDL levels.
The nuclear oxysterol receptors LXRalpha (NR1H3) and LXRbeta (NR1H2) coordinately regulate the expression of genes involved in the transport and catabolism of cholesterol. In macrophages, LXR stimulates the transcription of genes encoding transporters involved in cholesterol efflux, which may limit the transformation of these cells into foam cells in response to lipid loading. Here, we report that natural and synthetic LXR ligands induce the expression of the LXRalpha gene in primary human macrophages and differentiated THP-1 macrophages. This regulation was not observed in primary human adipocytes or hepatocytes, a human intestinal cell line, or in any mouse tissue or cell line examined. The human LXRalpha gene was isolated, and the transcription initiation site delineated. Analysis of the LXRalpha promoter revealed a functional LXR/RXR binding site approximately 2.9 kb upstream of the transcription initiation site. We conclude that LXRalpha regulates its own expression in human macrophages and that this response is likely to amplify the effects of oxysterols on reverse cholesterol transport. These findings underscore the importance of LXR as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of atherosclerosis.
Recently, a number of nuclear receptors have been identified as key regulators of cholesterol homeostasis. Two of these, liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha) (NR1H3) [1] and ubiquitous receptor (UR) (NR1H2) [1], appear to be involved in cholesterol reverse transport and disposal. LXRalpha null gene mice fail to adapt metabolically to high-cholesterol diets. We have recently shown that some 6alpha-hydroxylated bile acid analogs are selective activators of LXRalpha. In this report, we show that these orally administered LXRalpha agonists have an overall hypolipidemic effect in hypercholesterolemic rats, mice and hamsters, which indicates that in these animal models, endogenous LXRalpha agonist is a limiting factor for induction of cholesterol disposal. Furthermore, in animals, these 6alpha-hydroxylated bile acid analogs exhibit a unique pharmacokinetic profile and do not increase the serum triglyceride level; therefore, they may represent a novel class of therapeutic agents for cholesterol management.
The nuclear receptors liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha) (NR1H3) and LXRbeta (NR1H2) are important regulators of genes involved in lipid metabolism, including ABCA1, ABCG1, and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c). Although it has been demonstrated that oxysterols are LXR ligands, little is known about the identity of the physiological activators of these receptors. Here we confirm earlier studies demonstrating a dose-dependent induction of ABCA1 and ABCG1 in human monocyte-derived macrophages by cholesterol loading. In addition, we show that formation of 27-hydroxycholesterol and cholestenoic acid, products of CYP27 action on cholesterol, is dependent on the dose of cholesterol used to load the cells. Other proposed LXR ligands, including 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, and 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol, could not be detected under these conditions. A role for CYP27 in regulation of cholesterol-induced genes was demonstrated by the following findings. 1) Introduction of CYP27 into HEK-293 cells conferred an induction of ABCG1 and SREBP-1c; 2) upon cholesterol loading, CYP27-expressing cells induce these genes to a greater extent than in control cells; 3) in CYP27-deficient human skin fibroblasts, the induction of ABCA1 in response to cholesterol loading was ablated; and 4) in a coactivator association assay, 27-hydroxycholesterol functionally activated LXR. We conclude that 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol is an important pathway for LXR activation in response to cholesterol overload.
We have found that certain natural 6alpha-hydroxylated bile acids are receptor-specific activators of nuclear liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha) (NR1H3), a nuclear receptor regulating the expression of the cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase gene, coding for the rate-limiting enzyme in the major pathway of bile acid synthesis. The LXR homolog, ubiquitous nuclear receptor (UR/LXRbeta) (NR1H2), was also activated by these bile acids, but at higher concentrations than for LXRalpha. Synthetic 6alpha-hydroxylated bile acid analogs were synthesized with LXRalpha-selective agonistic activity, with potential to modulate cholesterol catabolism in hypercholesterolemia.
LXR alpha (liver X receptor, also called RLD-1) is a nuclear receptor, highly expressed in tissues that play a role in lipid homeostasis. In this report we show that fatty acids are positive regulators of LXR alpha gene expression and we investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation. In cultured rat hepatoma and primary hepatocyte cells, fatty acids and the sulfur-substituted fatty acid analog, tetradecylthioacetic acid, robustly induce LXR alpha (up to 3.5- and 7-fold, respectively) but not LXR beta (also called OR-1) mRNA steady state levels, with unsaturated fatty acids being more effective than saturated fatty acids. RNA stability and nuclear run-on studies demonstrate that changes in the transcription rate of the LXR alpha gene account for the major part of the induction of LXR alpha mRNA levels. A similar induction of protein level was also seen after treatment of primary hepatocytes with the same fatty acids. Consistent with such a transcriptional effect, transient transfection studies with a luciferase reporter gene, driven by 1.5 kb of the 5'-flanking region of the mouse (m)LXR alpha gene, show a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha-dependent increase in luciferase activity upon treatment with tetradecylthioacetic acid and the synthetic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha activator, Wy 14.643, suggesting that the mLXR alpha 5'-flanking region contains the necessary sequence elements for fatty acid responsiveness. In addition, in vivo LXR alpha expression was induced by fatty acids, consistent with the in vitro cell culture data. These observations demonstrate that LXR alpha expression is controlled by fatty acid signaling pathways and suggest an important cross-talk between fatty acid and cholesterol regulation of lipid metabolism.
This study describes the expression of the OR-1 orphan receptor in embryonic, postnatal, and adult brain tissue studied by in situ hybridization. This newly characterized member of the nuclear receptor superfamily functions as a modulator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone signalling by influencing gene activation by these hormones from a distinct promoter region. In the fetal brain OR-1 mRNA was observed from E13-E16 in the developing pons, tegmentum, pontine flexure, medulla, inferior and superior colliculi, cerebellum, hippocampus, thalamus, striatum, and cortical plate. At E18, OR-1 was expressed in the hippocampus, cerebellum, ventricular layer of the developing cortex and cortical plate, striatum, and olfactory bulb. In the E21 to early postnatal brain the highest expression of OR-1 mRNA was seen in the hippocampus, cerebellum, striatum, and olfactory bulb. The expression of OR-1 in the cerebellum increased during postnatal development and by d P21 OR-1 mRNA had reached the levels present in the adult in the cerebellar cortex. In the adult brain the highest expression of OR-1 mRNA was observed in the CA1 area of the hippocampus and the cerebellar cortex. We conclude that OR-1 is widely expressed in the fetal brain, whereas in the postnatal and adult brains OR-1 mRNA is more discretely localized, and that the amount of OR-1 mRNA increases in the cerebellum during postnatal development. The results of this study suggest that, in the fetal brain, OR-1 has a spatially widespread role in modulating gene activation by retinoids and thyroid hormone, whereas in the adult brain this modulation occurs only in distinct neuronal populations.
We have cloned a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. The cDNA was isolated from a rat liver library and encodes a protein of 446 aa with a predicted mass of 50 kDa. This clone (OR-1) shows no striking homology to any known member of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily. The most related receptor is the ecdysone receptor and the highest homologies represent &lt; 10% in the amino-terminal domain, between 15-37% in the carboxyl-terminal domain and 50-62% in the DNA binding domain. The expression of OR-1 appears to be widespread in both fetal and adult rat tissues. Potential DNA response elements composed of a direct repeat of the hexameric motif AGGTCA spaced by 0-6 nt were tested in gel shift experiments. OR-1 was shown to interact with the 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor (retinoid X receptor, RXR) and the OR-1/RXR complex to bind to a direct repeat spaced by 4 nt (DR4). In transfection experiments, OR-1 appears to activate RXR-mediated function through the DR4. Therefore OR-1 might modulate 9-cis-retinoic acid signaling by interacting with RXR.
The nuclear hormone receptors liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha) (NR1H3) and LXRbeta (NR1H2) are established regulators of cholesterol, lipid, and glucose metabolism and are attractive drug targets for the treatment of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Adrenal steroid hormones including glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids are known to interfere with glucose metabolism, insulin signaling, and blood pressure regulation. Here we present genome-wide expression profiles of LXR-responsive genes in both the adrenal and the pituitary gland. LXR activation in cultured adrenal cells inhibited expression of multiple steroidogenic genes and consequently decreased adrenal steroid hormone production. In addition, LXR agonist treatment elevated ACTH mRNA expression and hormone secretion from pituitary cells both in vitro and in vivo. Reduced expression of the glucocortioid-activating enzyme 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 in pituitary cells upon LXR activation suggests blunting of the negative feedback of glucocorticoids by LXRs. In conclusion, LXRs independently interfere with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis regulation at the level of the pituitary and the adrenal gland.
Polymorphic genes associated with Alzheimer's disease (see ) delineate a clearly defined pathway related to cerebral and peripheral cholesterol and lipoprotein homoeostasis. They include all of the key components of a glia/neurone cholesterol shuttle including cholesterol binding lipoproteins APOA1, APOA4, APOC1, APOC2, APOC3, APOD, APOE and LPA, cholesterol transporters ABCA1, ABCA2, lipoprotein receptors LDLR, LRP1, LRP8 and VLDLR, and the cholesterol metabolising enzymes CYP46A1 and CH25H, whose oxysterol products activate the liver X receptor NR1H2 and are metabolised to esters by SOAT1. LIPA metabolises cholesterol esters, which are transported by the cholesteryl ester transport protein CETP. The transcription factor SREBF1 controls the expression of most enzymes of cholesterol synthesis. APP is involved in this shuttle as it metabolises cholesterol to 7-betahydroxycholesterol, a substrate of SOAT1 and HSD11B1, binds to APOE and is tethered to LRP1 via APPB1, APBB2 and APBB3 at the cytoplasmic domain and via LRPAP1 at the extracellular domain. APP cleavage products are also able to prevent cholesterol binding to APOE. BACE cleaves both APP and LRP1. Gamma-secretase (PSEN1, PSEN2, NCSTN) cleaves LRP1 and LRP8 as well as APP and their degradation products control transcription factor TFCP2, which regulates thymidylate synthase (TS) and GSK3B expression. GSK3B is known to phosphorylate the microtubule protein tau (MAPT). Dysfunction of this cascade, carved out by genes implicated in Alzheimer's disease, may play a major role in its pathology. Many other genes associated with Alzheimer's disease affect cholesterol or lipoprotein function and/or have also been implicated in atherosclerosis, a feature of Alzheimer's disease, and this duality may well explain the close links between vascular and cerebral pathology in Alzheimer's disease. The definition of many of these genes as risk factors is highly contested. However, when polymorphic susceptibility genes belong to the same signaling pathway, the risk associated with multigenic disease is better related to the integrated effects of multiple polymorphisms of genes within the same pathway than to variants in any single gene [Wu, X., Gu, J., Grossman, H.B., Amos, C.I., Etzel, C., Huang, M., Zhang, Q., Millikan, R.E., Lerner, S., Dinney, C.P., Spitz, M.R., 2006. Bladder cancer predisposition: a multigenic approach to DNA-repair and cell-cycle-control genes. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 78, 464-479.]. Thus, the fact that Alzheimer's disease susceptibility genes converge on a clearly defined signaling network has important implications for genetic association studies.
Deposition of the beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide is thought to underlie development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This pathological linkage has spurred considerable interest in therapeutic strategies to reduce Abeta production. It is becoming increasingly clear that altered cholesterol homeostasis can modulate Abeta production and/or accumulation. In this review, we discuss the molecular pathology of AD, the cholesterol connection and recent data suggesting that the oxysterol receptor, liver X receptor LXR (NR1H2 and NR1H3), may modulate these events.
We have initiated a systematic analysis of the role of cholesterol metabolizing genes as risk factors for Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. As part of this analysis, we have assessed the NR1H2 gene on chromosome 19 and report here a modest association with the locus in sibpairs with late onset disease.
Cloning and characterization of the orphan nuclear receptors constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, NR1I3) and pregnane X receptor (PXR, NR1I2) led to major breakthroughs in studying drug-mediated transcriptional induction of drug-metabolizing cytochromes P450 (CYPs). More recently, additional roles for CAR and PXR have been discovered. As examples, these xenosensors are involved in the homeostasis of cholesterol, bile acids, bilirubin, and other endogenous hydrophobic molecules in the liver: CAR and PXR thus form an intricate regulatory network with other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, foremost the cholesterol-sensing liver X receptor (LXR, NR1H2/3) and the bile-acid-activated farnesoid X receptor (FXR, NR1H4). In this review, functional interactions between these nuclear receptors as well as the consequences on physiology and pathophysiology of the liver are discussed.
We characterize the ability of the liver X receptor (LXRalpha [NR1H3] and LXRbeta [NR1H2]) agonist, T0901317, to activate the farnesoid X receptor (FXR [NR4H4]). Although T0901317 is a much more potent activator of LXR than FXR, this ligand actually activates FXR more potently than a natural bile acid FXR ligand, chenodeoxycholic acid. Thus, the FXR activity of T0901317 must be considered when utilizing this agonist as a pharmacological tool to investigate LXR function.
To ascertain whether distinct chromosomal loci existed that were linked to severe obesity, as well as to utilize the increased heritability of this excessive phenotype, we performed a genome-wide scan in severely obese French Caucasians. The 109 selected pedigrees, totaling 447 individuals, required both the proband and a sibling to be severely obese (BMI &gt;or=35 kg/m(2)), and 84.8% of the nuclear families possessed &gt;or=1 morbidly obese sibling (BMI &gt;or=40). Severe and morbid obesity are still relatively rare in France, with rates of 2.5 and 0.6%, respectively. The initial genome scan consisted of 395 evenly spaced microsatellite markers. Six regions were found to have suggestive linkage on 4q, 6cen-q, 17q, and 19q for a BMI &gt;or=35 phenotypic subset, and 5q and 10q for an inclusive BMI &gt;or=27 group. The highest peak on chromosome 19q (logarithm of odds [LOD] = 3.59) was significant by genome scan simulation testing (P = 0.042). These regions then underwent second-stage mapping with an additional set of 42 markers. BMI &gt;or=35 analysis defined regions on 17q23.3-25.1 and 19q13.33-13.43 with an maximum likelihood score LOD of 3.16 and 3.21, respectively. Subsequent pooled data analysis with an additional previous population of 66 BMI &gt;or=35 sib-pairs led to a significant LOD score of 3.8 at the 19q locus (empirical P = 0.023). For more moderate obesity and overweight susceptibility loci, BMI &gt;or=27 analysis confirmed suggestive linkage to chromosome regions 5q14.3-q21.3 (LOD = 2.68) and 10q24.32-26.2 (LOD = 2.47). Plausible positional candidate genes include NR1H2 and TULP2.
Natural products have been identified as ligands for a number of members of the nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) superfamily. Often these natural products are used as dietary supplements to treat myriad ailments ranging from perimenopausal hot flashes to hypercholesterolemia and reduced cognitive function. Examples of some natural product ligands for NHRs include genestein (estrogen receptors NR3A1 and NR3A2), guggulsterone (farnesoid X receptor NR1H4), and St. John's wort (pregnane X receptor, NR1I2). In this study, we identified the first nonoxysterol natural product that functions as a ligand for the liver X receptor (LXRalpha and LXRbeta; NR1H3, NR1H2), a NHR that acts as the receptor for oxysterols and plays a key role in regulation of cholesterol metabolism and transport as well as glucose metabolism. We show that paxilline, a fungal metabolite, is an efficacious agonist of both LXRalpha and LXRbeta in biochemical and in vitro cell-based assays. Paxilline binds directly to both receptors and is an activator of LXR-dependent transcription in cell-based reporter assays. We also demonstrate that paxilline binding to the receptors results in efficient activation of transcription of two physiological LXR target genes, ABCA1 and SREBP. The discovery of paxilline, the first reported nonoxysterol natural product ligand of the LXRs, may provide insight into the mechanism of ligand recognition by these receptors and reaffirms the utility of examining natural product libraries for identifying novel NHR ligands.
Defining complete sets of gene family members from diverse species provides the foundation for comparative studies. Using a bioinformatic approach, we have defined the entire nuclear receptor complement within the first available complete sequence of a non-human vertebrate (the teleost fish Fugu rubripes). In contrast to the human set (48 total nuclear receptors), we found 68 nuclear receptors in the Fugu genome. All 68 Fugu receptors had a clear human homolog, thus defining no new nuclear receptor subgroups. A reciprocal analysis showed that each human receptor had one or more Fugu orthologs, excepting CAR (NR1I3) and LXRbeta (NR1H2). These 68 receptors add striking diversity to the known nuclear receptor superfamily and provide important comparators to human nuclear receptors. We have compared several pharmacologically relevant human nuclear receptors (FXR, LXRalpha/beta, CAR, PXR, VDR and PPARalpha/gamma/delta) to their Fugu orthologs. This comparison included expression analysis across five Fugu tissue types. All of the Fugu receptors that were analyzed by PCR in this study were expressed, indicating that the majority of the additional Fugu receptors are likely to be functional.
The structures of the liver X receptor LXRbeta (NR1H2) have been determined in complexes with two synthetic ligands, T0901317 and GW3965, to 2.1 and 2.4 A, respectively. Together with its isoform LXRalpha (NR1H3) it regulates target genes involved in metabolism and transport of cholesterol and fatty acids. The two LXRbeta structures reveal a flexible ligand-binding pocket that can adjust to accommodate fundamentally different ligands. The ligand-binding pocket is hydrophobic but with polar or charged residues at the two ends of the cavity. T0901317 takes advantage of this by binding to His-435 close to H12 while GW3965 orients itself with its charged group in the opposite direction. Both ligands induce a fixed "agonist conformation" of helix H12 (also called the AF-2 domain), resulting in a transcriptionally active receptor.
The Liver X Receptors (LXR alpha, NR1H3; LXR beta, NR1H2) encode highly homologous transcription factors that are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of proteins. Both LXR alpha and LXR beta form heterodimers with the obligate partner 9-cis retinoic acid receptor alpha (RXR alpha; NR2B1). LXR/RXR heterodimers function as sensors for cellular oxysterols and, when activated by these agonists, increase the expression of genes that control sterol and fatty acid metabolism/homeostasis. These conclusions are based on studies that: (i) identified oxysterols as the natural ligands for both LXR alpha and LXR beta; (ii) identified target genes that are activated by LXR/RXR; (iii) generated mice that were deficient in LXR alpha, LXR beta or both LXR alpha and LXR beta; (iv) identified synthetic LXR ligands that were extremely potent in vivo; and (v) demonstrated significant alterations in cholesterol and fatty acid homeostasis in animals in which LXR had been either activated or deleted. These findings suggest that synthetic LXR ligands may prove useful in the treatment of certain dyslipidemias. In this review, we summarize the current status of this rapidly moving area with a special emphasis on the potential for pharmacological intervention.
The etiology of peripheral squamous cell lung cancer (PSCCa) remains unknown. Here, we show that this condition spontaneously develops in mice in which the genes for two oxysterol receptors, Liver X Receptor (LXR) α (Nr1h3) and β (Nr1h2), are inactivated. By 1 y of age, most of these mice have to be euthanized because of severe dyspnea. Starting at 3 mo, the lungs of LXRα,β(Dko) mice, but not of LXRα or LXRβ single knockout mice, progressively accumulate foam cells, so that by 1 y, the lungs are covered by a "golden coat." There is infiltration of inflammatory cells and progressive accumulation of lipid in the alveolar wall, type 2 pneumocytes, and macrophages. By 14 mo, there are three histological lesions: one resembling adenomatous hyperplasia, one squamous metaplasia, and one squamous cell carcinoma characterized by expression of transformation-related protein (p63), sex determining region Y-box 2 (Sox2), cytokeratin 14 (CK14), and cytokeratin 13 (CK13) and absence of thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1), and prosurfactant protein C (pro-SPC). RNA sequencing analysis at 12 mo confirmed a massive increase in markers of M1 macrophages and lymphocytes. The data suggest a previously unidentified etiology of PSCCa: cholesterol dysregulation and M1 macrophage-predominant lung inflammation combined with damage to, and aberrant repair of, lung tissue, particularly the peripheral parenchyma. The results raise the possibility that components of the LXR signaling may be useful targets in the treatment of PSCCa.
The aim of this study was to elucidate aspects of diabetes mellitus-induced suppression of aneurysm. We hypothesized that high glucose suppresses aneurysm by inhibiting macrophage activation via activation of Nr1h2 (also known as liver X receptor β), recently characterized as a glucose-sensing nuclear receptor.
Calcium phosphate (CaPO4)-induced aneurysm formation was significantly suppressed in the arterial wall in type 1 and 2 diabetic mice. A murine macrophage cell line, RAW264.7, was treated with tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) plus CaPO4 and showed a significant increase in matrix metalloproteinase 9 (Mmp9) mRNA and secreted protein expression compared with TNF-α alone. Elevated Mmp9 expression was significantly suppressed by hyperglycemic conditions (15.5 mmol/L glucose) compared with normoglycemic conditions (5.5 mmol/L glucose) or normoglycemic conditions with high osmotic pressure (5.5 mmol/L glucose +10.0 mmol/L mannitol). Nr1h2 mRNA and protein expression were suppressed by treatment with TNF-α plus CaPO4 but were restored by hyperglycemic conditions. Activation of Nr1h2 by the antagonist GW3965 during stimulation with TNF-α plus CaPO4 mimicked hyperglycemic conditions and inhibited Mmp9 upregulation, whereas the deactivation of Nr1h2 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) under hyperglycemic conditions canceled the suppressive effect and restored Mmp9 expression induced by TNF-α plus CaPO4. Moreover, Nr1h2 activation with GW3965 significantly suppressed CaPO4-induced aneurysm in mice compared with vehicle-injected control mice.
Our results show that hyperglycemia suppresses macrophage activation and aneurysmal degeneration through the activation of Nr1h2. Although further validation of the underlying pathway is necessary, targeting Nr1h2 is a potential therapeutic approach to treating aneurysm.
Breast-cancer is heterogeneous and consists of various groups with different biological characteristics. Innovative pharmacological approaches accounting for this heterogeneity are needed. The forty eight human Nuclear-Hormone-Receptors are ligand-dependent transcription-factors and are classified into Endocrine-Receptors, Adopted-Orphan-Receptors (Lipid-sensors and Enigmatic-Orphans) and Orphan-receptors. Nuclear-Receptors represent ideal targets for the design/synthesis of pharmacological ligands. We provide an overview of the literature available on the expression and potential role played by Lipid-sensors, Enigmatic-Orphans and Orphan-Receptors in breast-cancer. The data are complemented by an analysis of the expression levels of each selected Nuclear-Receptor in the PAM50 breast-cancer groups, following re-elaboration of the data publicly available. The major aim is to support the idea that some of the Nuclear-Receptors represent largely unexploited therapeutic-targets in breast-cancer treatment/chemo-prevention. On the basis of our analysis, we conclude that the Lipid-Sensors, NR1C3, NR1H2 and NR1H3 are likely to be onco-suppressors in breast-cancer. The Enigmatic-Orphans, NR1F1 NR2A1 and NR3B3 as well as the Orphan-Receptors, NR0B1, NR0B2, NR1D1, NR2F1, NR2F2 and NR4A3 exert a similar action. These Nuclear-Receptors represent candidates for the development of therapeutic strategies aimed at increasing their expression or activating them in tumor cells. The group of Nuclear-Receptors endowed with potential oncogenic properties consists of the Lipid-Sensors, NR1C2 and NR1I2, the Enigmatic-Orphans, NR1F3, NR3B1 and NR5A2, as well as the Orphan-Receptors, NR2E1, NR2E3 and NR6A1. These oncogenic Nuclear-Receptors should be targeted with selective antagonists, reverse-agonists or agents/strategies capable of reducing their expression in breast-cancer cells.
Liver X receptors, LXRα (NR1H3) and LXRβ (NR1H2), are best known as nuclear oxysterol receptors and physiological master regulators of lipid and cholesterol metabolism. LXRα play a protective role in acute myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury, but its role in myocardial infarction (MI) is unknown. The present study was undertaken to determine the effect of LXRα knockout on survival and development of chronic heart failure after MI. Wild-type (WT) and LXRα(-/-) mice were subjected to MI followed by serial echocardiographic and histological assessments. Greater myocyte apoptosis and inflammation within the infarcted zones were found in LXRα(-/-) group at 3 days after MI. At 4 weeks post-MI, LXRα(-/-) MI murine hearts demonstrated significantly increased infarct size, reduced ejection fraction (LXRα(-/-) 29.4 % versus WT 34.4 %), aggravated left ventricular (LV) chamber dilation, enhanced fibrosis and reduced angiogenesis. In addition, LXRα(-/-) mice had increased mortality compared with WT mice. LXRα deficiency increases mortality, aggravates pathological injury and LV remodeling induced by MI. Drugs specifically targeting LXRα may be promising in the treatment of MI. 
To investigate whether the ingestion of olive oil having different phenolic contents influences the expression of blood pressure-related genes, involved in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, in healthy humans.
A randomized, double-blind, crossover human trial with 18 healthy subjects, who ingested 25 mL/day of olive oils (1) high (366 mg/kg, HPC) and (2) low (2.7 mg/kg, LPC) in phenolic compounds for 3 weeks, preceded by 2-week washout periods. Determination of selected blood pressure-related gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) by qPCR, blood pressure and systemic biomarkers.
HPC decreased systolic blood pressure compared to pre-intervention values and to LPC, and maintained diastolic blood pressure values compared to LPC. HPC decreased ACE and NR1H2 gene expressions compared with pre-intervention values, and IL8RA gene expression compared with LPC.
The introduction to the diet of an extra-virgin olive oil rich in phenolic compounds modulates the expression of some of the genes related to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. These changes could underlie the decrease in systolic blood pressure observed.
Sea cucumbers have been consumed as tonic, food, and nutrition supplements for many years.
The objective of this study is to investigate the antiobesity and lipid-lowering effects of sea cucumber extracts in in vitro and in vivo models and elucidate the mechanism of action of the extracts on obesity and dyslipidemia.
The 60% ethanol extracts from the body walls of 10 different sea cucumbers were investigated for the inhibition of pancreatic lipase (PL) activity in vitro. The optimal active extract (SC-3) was further chemically analyzed by LC-MS and UV. And 0.1% and 0.2% of SC-3 was mixed with a high-fat diet to treat C57/BL6 mice for 6 weeks or 2 weeks as preventive and therapeutic study. The body weight, serum, and liver lipid profile in the mice were investigated.
The crude extract of Pearsonothuria graeffei Semper (Holothuriidae) inhibited the PL activity by 36.44% of control at 0.5 μg/mL. SC-3 and echinoside A inhibited PL with an IC50 value at 2.86 μg/mL and 0.76 μM. 0.1% of SC-3 reduced the body weight (23.0 ± 0.62 versus 26.3 ± 0.76 g), the serum TC (2.46 ± 0.04 versus 2.83 ± 0.12 mmol/L), TG (0.19 ± 0.08 versus 0.40 ± 0.03 mmo/L), and LDL-c (0.48 ± 0.02 versus 0.51 ± 0.02 mmol/L), and liver TC (1.19 ± 0.17 versus 1.85 ± 0.13 mmol/mg) and TG (6.18 ± 0.92 versus 10.87 ± 0.97 mmol/mg) contents of the obese C57BL/six mice on a high-fat diet.
Sea cucumber may be used for developing antiobesity and antihyperlipidemia drugs.
In nonprimate species, it has been well established that prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2alpha) initiates luteolysis. Changes in intracellular cholesterol concentrations caused by modulation of cholesterol uptake and efflux may mediate PGF2alpha-induced luteolysis. These changes in cholesterol efflux and uptake are controlled, in part, by the liver x receptors (LXR) alpha (NR1H3) and beta (NR1H2), nuclear receptors that increase expression of genes necessary for cholesterol efflux or limiting cholesterol uptake. Therefore, we hypothesized that PGF2alpha reduces expression of cholesterol uptake and increases expression of cholesterol efflux genes, mediated in part by enhanced LXR activity. To test this hypothesis, an induced luteolysis model was used whereby ewes were treated during their midluteal phase with saline or PGF2alpha and corpora lutea (CL) collected 12, 24, or 48 h later for determination of mRNA and protein concentrations by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. As a complementary approach, CL undergoing spontaneous luteolysis were compared to midluteal phase CL. The lipoprotein receptors responsible for cholesterol uptake were significantly decreased in both luteolysis models. Expression of the LXR target gene ATP binding cassette subfamily A1 (ABCA1), an important mediator of cholesterol efflux, was significantly increased in both experimental models. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed that PGF2alpha treatment resulted in enhanced NR1H3 and NR1H2 binding to the ABCA1 promoter. Qualitative changes in lipid droplet distribution were also observed following PGF2alpha treatment. These data support the hypothesis that reduced cholesterol uptake and increased efflux mediate luteolysis in sheep, which is partially controlled by PGF2alpha stimulation of LXR activity. 
LXR (encoded by NR1H2 and 3) and FXR (known as bile acid receptor) encoded by NR1H4 (nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group H and member 4) are nuclear receptors in humans and are important regulators of bile acid production, cholesterol, fatty acid and glucose homeostasis hence responsible for liver detoxification. Several strategies for drug design with numerous ligands for this target have failed owing to the inability of the ligand to access the target/receptor or their early metabolisation. In this work, we have evaluated FXR and LXR structure bound with agonist and compared the binding energy affinity of active ligands present in live green-real veggies with reference drugs (ligands) present in the market. A high throughput screening combined with molecular docking, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) predictions, log P values and percentage of human oral absorption value led to the identification of two compounds present in live green-real veggies with strong potential for liver detoxification. 
Meat intake is associated with the risk of colorectal cancer. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate interactions between meat intake and genetic variation in order to identify biological pathways involved in meat carcinogenesis. We performed a literature search of PubMed and Embase using "interaction", "meat", "polymorphisms", and "colorectal cancer", and data on meat-gene interactions were extracted. The studies were divided according to whether information on meat intake was collected prospectively or retrospectively. In prospective studies, interactions between meat intake and polymorphisms in PTGS2 (encoding COX-2), ABCB1, IL10, NFKB1, MSH3, XPC (P int = 0.006, 0.01, 0.04, 0.03, 0.002, 0.01, respectively), but not IL1B, HMOX1, ABCC2, ABCG2, NR1I2 (encoding PXR), NR1H2 (encoding LXR), NAT1, NAT2, MSH6, or MLH1 in relation to CRC were found. Interaction between a polymorphism in XPC and meat was found in one prospective and one case-control study; however, the directions of the risk estimates were opposite. Thus, none of the findings were replicated. The results from this systematic review suggest that genetic variation in the inflammatory response and DNA repair pathway is involved in meat-related colorectal carcinogenesis, whereas no support for the involvement of heme and iron from meat or cooking mutagens was found. Further studies assessing interactions between meat intake and genetic variation in relation to CRC in large well-characterised prospective cohorts with relevant meat exposure are warranted. 
Liver-X-receptors, LXRα (NR1H3) and LXRβ (NR1H2), encode 2 different but highly homologous isoforms of transcription factors belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily. Whether LXRα and LXRβ subtypes have discrete roles in the regulation of cardiac physiology/pathology is unknown. We determine the role of each LXR subtype in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury.
Mice (wild type; those genetically depleted of LXRα, LXRβ, or both; and those overexpressing LXRα or LXRβ by in vivo intramyocardial adenoviral vector) were subjected to MI/R injury. Both LXRα and LXRβ were detected in wild-type mouse heart. LXRα, but not LXRβ, was significantly upregulated after MI/R. Dual activation of LXRα and LXRβ by natural and synthetic agonists reduced myocardial infarction and improved contractile function after MI/R. Mechanistically, LXR activation inhibited MI/R-induced oxidative stress and nitrative stress, attenuated endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, and reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis in ischemic/reperfused myocardium. The aforementioned cardioprotective effects of LXR agonists were impaired in the setting of cardiac-specific gene silencing of LXRα, but not LXRβ subtype. Moreover, LXRα/β double-knockout and LXRα-knockout mice, but not LXRβ-knockout mice, increased MI/R injury, exacerbated MI/R-induced oxidative/nitrative stress, and aggravated endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, cardiac LXRα, not LXRβ, overexpression via adenoviral transfection suppressed MI/R injury.
Our study provides the first direct evidence that the LXRα, but not LXRβ, subtype is a novel endogenous cardiac protective receptor against MI/R injury. Drug development strategies specifically targeting LXRα may be beneficial in treating ischemic heart disease.
Gestational diabetes (GD) alters normal fetal development and is related to a diabetogenic effect in the progeny. Liver X receptors (LXRs) are considered to be potential drug targets for the regulation, treatment, or prevention of diabetes. The aim of this study was to evaluate early and late changes of LXR in the hippocampus and hypothalamus of the male and female offspring of control (CO) and diabetic (DO) mothers. We used an experimental model of streptozotocin-induced GD to assess the protein expression of LXRα (NR1H3) and LXRβ (NR1H2) by western blotting. The tissues were obtained from CO and DO animals at postnatal day 1 (1D), day 10 (10D), and day 35 (35D) and 9 months (9M). In CO, the LXR expression showed significant differences among the groups, which were tissue- and receptor-specific (P&lt;0.05). Sex differences in CO were found only in the hypothalamus for LXRβ expression at 35D and 9M (P&lt;0.05). When CO and DO were compared, differences between them were observed in the majority of the studied groups at 1D (male hippocampus, LXRα 31% and LXRβ 161%; female hippocampus, LXRβ 165%; male hypothalamus, LXRβ 182%; and female hypothalamus, LXRα 85%; P&lt;0.05). However, these differences disappeared later with the exception of LXRβ expression in the male hypothalamus (P&lt;0.05). The area under the curve during the glucose tolerance test correlated negatively with LXRβ in CO but not in DO animals. Moreover, in a male DO subpopulation this correlation was positive as it occurs in intolerant animals. These results indicate that GD affects hypothalamic LXR expression differently in male and female offspring. 
The nuclear receptor liver X receptor [LXR] is activated by endogenous oxidized derivatives of cholesterol. It constitutes a critical receptor in the regulation of various physiological functions related to the development of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis and diabetes, as well as various other disorders. Both isoforms of LXR, LXRα [NR1H3] and LXRβ [NR1H2], form heterodimers with the isoforms of the retinoid X receptor [RXR], which then regulate the gene expression by binding to DNA sequences associated with target genes. LXR acts as a cholesterol sensor in response to an increased concentration of cholesterol in cells and induces the transcription of genes that protect cells from cholesterol overload. LXRs play numerous roles in controlling cholesterol homeostasis via their actions on bile acid synthesis and metabolism/excretion, reverse cholesterol transport and cholesterol absorption/excretion in the intestines. Therefore, these receptors show great potential as pharmacological targets for anti-atherosclerotic activities. Recent discoveries have also emphasized the important involvement of LXRs in the pathogenesis of diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, inflammation, adrenal steroid synthesis, skin aging and male fertility. However, LXR activation has also been shown to stimulate lipogenesis via sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c, leading to liver steatosis and hypertriglyceridemia. This review summarizes recent scientific discoveries and the biological actions of LXR with a special focus on the involvement of this type of receptor in important diseases and conditions. 
Liver X receptors LXRα (NR1H3) and LXRβ (NR1H2) are transcription factors belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily, activated by specific oxysterols, oxidized derivatives of cholesterol. These receptors are involved in the regulation of testis physiology. Lxr-deficient mice pointed to the physiological roles of these nuclear receptors in steroid synthesis, lipid homeostasis and germ cell apoptosis and proliferation. Diethylstilbestrol (DES) is a synthetic estrogen considered as an endocrine disruptor that affects the functions of the testis. Various lines of evidences have made a clear link between estrogens, their nuclear receptors ERα (NR3A1) and ERβ (NR3A2), and Lxrα/β. As LXR activity could also be regulated by the nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP, NR0A2) and DES could act through SHP, we wondered whether LXR could be targeted by estrogen-like endocrine disruptors such as DES. For that purpose, wild-type and Lxr-deficient mice were daily treated with 0.75 μg DES from days 1 to 5 after birth. The effects of DES were investigated at 10 or 45 days of age. We demonstrated that DES induced a decrease of the body mass at 10 days only in the Lxr-deficient mice suggesting a protective effect of Lxr. We defined three categories of DES-target genes in testis: those whose accumulation is independent of Lxr; those whose accumulation is enhanced by the lack of both Lxrα/β; those whose accumulation is repressed by the absence of Lxrα/β. Lipid accumulation is also modified by neonatal DES injection. Lxr-deficient mice present different lipid profiles, demonstrating that DES could have its effects in part due to Lxrα/β. Altogether, our study shows that both nuclear receptors Lxrα and Lxrβ are not only basally important for testicular physiology but could also have a preventive effect against estrogen-like endocrine disruptors.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) α and β are nuclear hormone receptors that are widely expressed in the kidney. They promote cholesterol efflux from cells and inhibit inflammatory responses by regulating gene transcription. Here, we hypothesised (1) that LXR deficiency would promote renal decline in a mouse model of diabetes by accelerating intraglomerular cholesterol accumulation and, conversely, (2) that LXR agonism would attenuate renal decline in diabetes.
Diabetes was induced with streptozotocin (STZ) and maintained for 14 weeks in Lxrα/β (+/+) (Lxrα, also known as Nr1h3; Lxrβ, also known as Nr1h2) and Lxrα/β (-/-) mice. In addition, STZ-injected DBA/2J mice were treated with vehicle or the LXR agonist N,N-dimethyl-hydroxycholenamide (DMHCA) (80 mg/kg daily) for 10 weeks. To determine the role of cholesterol in diabetic nephropathy (DN), mice were placed on a Western diet after hyperglycaemia developed.
Even in the absence of diabetes, Lxrα/β (-/-) mice exhibited a tenfold increase in the albumin:creatinine ratio and a 40-fold increase in glomerular lipid accumulation compared with Lxrα/β (+/+) mice. When challenged with diabetes, Lxrα/β (-/-) mice showed accelerated mesangial matrix expansion and glomerular lipid accumulation, with upregulation of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers. In the DN-sensitive STZ DBA/2J mouse model, DMHCA treatment significantly decreased albumin and nephrin excretion (by 50% each), glomerular lipids and plasma triacylglycerol (by 70%) and cholesterol (by 48%); it also decreased kidney inflammatory and oxidative stress markers compared with vehicle-treated mice.
These data support the idea that LXR plays an important role in the normal and diabetic kidney, while showing that LXR, through its inhibitory effect on inflammation and cholesterol accumulation in glomeruli, could also be a novel therapeutic target for DN.
The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is considered to be a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. It is characterized by central adiposity, high blood pressure, glucose intolerance and abnormalities of lipoprotein metabolism. The cause of MetS is likely to be due to a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Liver X receptors alpha (NR1H3) and beta (NR1H2) play a key role in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of genetic polymorphisms in the LXRs to risk of MetS and related traits. Two common SNPs in NR1H3 (rs11039155 and rs2279238) and in NR1H2 (rs17373080 and rs2695121) were genotyped using TaqMan assays in MetS patients (n=265) and controls (n=219). Logistic regression analyses were performed to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) as a measure of association of genotypes with the presence of MetS and related phenotypes. Although The NR1H2 polymorphism rs2695121 was nominally associated with MetS but correction for multiple-testing and adjustment for age, sex and number of MetS criteria, failed to identify any significant interactions associated with prevalence of MetS. However in the haplotype analysis, a LXRα haplotype AC, was more common in controls and was associated with a significant protective effect for MetS (OR [95% CI]=0.25 [0.07-0.88], p=0.031). In conclusion, this study suggests that the above-named variants in LXRα and LXRβ genes are not potential contributors to the risk of MetS and related traits in an Iranian population.
The ability of cells to precisely control gene expression in response to intracellular and extracellular signals plays an important role in both normal physiology and in pathological settings. For instance, the accumulation of excess cholesterol by macrophages initiates a genetic response mediated by the liver X receptors (LXRs)-α (NR1H3) and LXRβ (NR1H2), which facilitates the transport of cholesterol out of cells to high-density lipoprotein particles. Studies using synthetic LXR agonists have also demonstrated that macrophage LXR activation simultaneously induces a second network of genes that promotes fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis that may support the detoxification of excess free cholesterol by storage in the ester form. We now show that treatment of human THP-1 macrophages with endogenous or synthetic LXR ligands stimulates both transcriptional and posttranscriptional pathways that result in the selective recruitment of the LXRα subtype to LXR-regulated promoters. Interestingly, when human or mouse macrophages are loaded with cholesterol under conditions that mimic the development of atherogenic macrophage foam cells, a selective LXR response is generated that induces genes mediating cholesterol transport but does not coordinately regulate genes involved in fatty acid synthesis. The gene-selective response to cholesterol loading occurs, even in the presence of LXRα binding to the promoter of the gene encoding the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c, the master transcriptional regulator of fatty acid synthesis. The ability of promoter bound LXRα to recruit RNA polymerase to the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c promoter, however, appears to be ligand selective. 
Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA, 'C8') and perfluoroctane sulphonate (PFOS) are environmentally stable compounds with industrial and consumer uses and long half-lives in humans. Concern has been raised over chronic exposure effects to human health, especially in relation to cholesterol metabolism. Here, we explore the association between exposure to PFOA and PFOS and the in vivo expression of genes involved in cholesterol metabolism. We studied 290 individuals exposed to background levels of PFOS and elevated concentrations of PFOA through drinking water. Using adjusted linear regression models, we found inverse associations between serum PFOA levels and the whole blood expression level of genes involved in cholesterol transport (NR1H2, NPC1 and ABCG1; p=0.002, 0.026 and 0.014 respectively). A positive association was seen between PFOS and a transcript involved in cholesterol mobilisation (NCEH1; p=0.018), and a negative relationship with a transcript involved in cholesterol transport (NR1H3; p=0.044). When sexes were analysed separately, reductions in the levels of mRNAs involved in cholesterol transport were seen with PFOA in men (NPC1, ABCG1, and PPARA; p=0.025, 0.024 and 0.012 respectively) and in women (NR1H2 expression; p=0.019), whereas an increase in the levels of a cholesterol mobilisation transcript (NCEH1; p=0.036) was noted in women alone. PFOS was positively associated with expression of genes involved in both cholesterol mobilisation and transport in women (NCEH1 and PPARA; p=0.003 and 0.039 respectively), but no effects were evident in men. This is the first report of associations between the in vivo expression of genes involved in cholesterol metabolism and exposure to PFOA or PFOS, suggested that exposure to these compounds may promote a hypercholesterolaemic environment, with wider implications for human disease.
The regulation of lipid metabolism is central to energy homeostasis in higher multicellular organisms. Lipid homeostasis depends on factors that are able to transduce metabolic parameters into regulatory events representing the fundamental components of the general control system. Nuclear receptors form a superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors implicated in various physiological functions including energy metabolism. The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, NR1I3), initially identified as a xenobiotic-sensing receptor, may also have roles in lipid homeostasis. The nuclear receptors liver X receptors (LXRs, NR1H2/3) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs, NR1C) have been known for their roles in lipid metabolism. LXR is a sterol sensor that promotes lipogenesis, whereas PPARα controls a variety of genes in several pathways of lipid metabolism. This chapter focuses primarily on the role of CAR in lipid metabolism directly or through its cross talk with LXRs and PPARα.
Liver X receptor (LXR) α and LXR β (NR1H3 and NR1H2) are oxysterol-activated nuclear receptors involved in the control of major metabolic pathways such as cholesterol homeostasis, lipogenesis, inflammation and innate immunity. Synthetic LXR agonists are currently under development and could find applications in various fields such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases. The clinical development of LXR agonists requires the identification of biological markers for pharmacodynamic studies. In this context, monocytes represent an attractive target to monitor LXR activation. They are easily accessible cells present in peripheral blood; they express LXR α and β and respond to LXR agonist stimulation in vitro. The aim of our study was to identify cell surface markers of LXR agonists on monocytes. For this, we focused on clusters of differentiation (CD) markers because they are well characterized and accessible cell surface molecules allowing easy immuno-phenotyping.
By using microarray analysis of monocytes treated or not with an LXR agonist in vitro, we selected three CD, i.e. CD82, CD226, CD244 for further analysis by real time PCR and flow cytometry. The three CD were up-regulated by LXR agonist treatment in vitro in a time- and dose- dependent manner and this induction was LXR specific as assessed by a SiRNA or LXR antagonist strategy. By using flow cytometry, we could demonstrate that the expression of these molecules at the cell surface of monocytes was significantly increased after LXR agonist treatment.
We have identified three new cell surface markers that could be useful to monitor LXR activation. Future studies will be required to confirm the biological and diagnostic significance of the markers.
This review focuses on a number of new data on biology and pathophysiology of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) and the involvement of nuclear receptors that have been presented during the last Endocrine Society meeting, held in Houston in June 2012. Several studies have reported beneficial effects of various orphan nuclear receptors, including SHP (Small Heterodimeric Partner, NR0B2) and LXR (Liver X Receptor, NR1H3 and NR1H2), on various components of MetS. By using an inactivation model of SHP, David Moore has shown that SHP exerts "antidiabetic" effects but associated with hepatic steatosis development. He also showed that DLPC (dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine), an unconventional phospholipid, exhibited anti-diabetic properties through its binding to LRH-1 (Liver Receptor Homolog-1, NR5A2), a molecular partner of SHP. Interestingly, Carolyn Cummins investigated LXR α and β isoforms knock-out mice and provided experimental evidence for the detailed mechanisms involved in the deleterious metabolic effects of glucocorticoids, pointing out to the functional interaction between LXRβ, and the glucocorticoid receptor. These new and original studies open new therapeutic opportunities for the management of metabolic disorders in humans by selective modulators of these receptors.
During the past decade, it has become increasingly clear that consistent changes in the levels of expression of a small cohort of genes accompany the aging of mammalian tissues. In many cases, these changes have been shown to generate features that are characteristic of the senescent phenotype. Previously, a small pilot study indicated that some of these changes might be reversed in rat liver, if the liver cells became malignant and were proliferating. The present study has tested the hypothesis that inducing proliferation in old rat liver can reset the levels of expression of these age-related genes to that observed in young tissue. A microarray approach was used to identify genes that exhibited the greatest changes in their expression during aging. The levels of expression of these markers were then examined in transcriptomes of both proliferating hepatomas from old animals and old rat liver lobes that had regenerated after partial hepatectomy but were again quiescent. We have found evidence that over 20 % of the aging-related genes had their levels of expression reset to young levels by stimulating proliferation, even in cells that had undergone a limited number of cell cycles and then become quiescent again. Moreover, our network analysis indicated alterations in MAPK/ERK and Jun-N-terminal kinase pathways and the potential important role of PAX3, VCAN, ARRB2, NR1H2, and ITGA5 that may provide insights into mechanisms involved in longevity and regeneration that are distinct from cancer.
The expressions of genes involved in cholesterol efflux increase, whereas those involved in extracellular cholesterol uptake decrease, during spontaneous functional regression of the primate corpus luteum (CL). This may result from liver x receptor (LXR) alpha (official symbol NR1H3) and/or beta (official symbol NR1H2) control of luteal gene transcription, because these nuclear receptor superfamily members are key regulators of cellular cholesterol homeostasis. Therefore, studies were conducted to assess endogenous LXR ligands in the primate CL through the luteal phase, and to determine the effect of synthetic or natural LXR ligands on cholesterol efflux and uptake in functional primate luteal cells. Using high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, three LXR ligands were identified and quantified in the rhesus macaque CL, including 22R-hydroxycholesterol (22ROH), 27-hydroxycholesterol (27OH), and desmosterol. Levels of 22ROH paralleled serum progesterone concentrations, whereas mean levels of 27OH tended to be higher following the loss of progesterone synthesis. Desmosterol was present throughout the luteal phase. Functional macaque luteal cells treated with the synthetic LXR agonist T0901317 or physiologically relevant concentrations of the endogenous luteal ligands 22ROH, 27OH, and desmosterol had increased expression of various known LXR target genes and greater cholesterol efflux. Additionally, T0901317 reduced low-density lipoprotein receptor protein and extracellular low-density lipoprotein uptake, whereas 27OH decreased low-density lipoprotein receptor protein, most likely via a posttranslational mechanism. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that LXR activation causes increased cholesterol efflux and decreased extracellular cholesterol uptake. In theory, these effects could deplete the primate CL of cholesterol needed for steroidogenesis, ultimately contributing to functional regression.
Preeclampsia is a frequent complication of pregnancy and a leading cause of perinatal mortality. Both genetic and environmental risk factors have been identified. Lipid metabolism, particularly cholesterol metabolism, is associated with this disease. Liver X receptors alpha (NR1H3, also known as LXRalpha) and beta (NR1H2, also known as LXRbeta) play a key role in lipid metabolism. They belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily and are activated by cholesterol derivatives. They have been implicated in preeclampsia because they modulate trophoblast invasion and regulate the expression of the endoglin (CD105) gene, a marker of preeclampsia. The aim of this study was to investigate associations between the NR1H3 and NR1H2 genes and preeclampsia.
We assessed associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms of NR1H3 (rs2279238 and rs7120118) and NR1H2 (rs35463555 and rs2695121) and the disease in 155 individuals with preeclampsia and 305 controls. Genotypes were determined by high-resolution melting analysis. We then used a logistic regression model to analyze the different alleles and genotypes for those polymorphisms as a function of case/control status.
We found no association between NR1H3 SNPs and the disease, but the NR1H2 polymorphism rs2695121 was found to be strongly associated with preeclampsia (genotype C/C: adjusted odds ratio, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.04-4.05; p = 0.039 and genotype T/C: adjusted odds ratio, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.01-3.42; p = 0.049).
This study provides the first evidence of an association between the NR1H2 gene and preeclampsia, adding to our understanding of the links between cholesterol metabolism and this disease.
Preventing postpartum uterine disease depends on the ability of endometrial cells to tolerate the presence of the bacteria that invade the uterus after parturition. Postpartum uterine disease and endometrial pathology in cattle are most associated with the pathogen Trueperella pyogenes. Trueperella pyogenes secretes a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin, pyolysin, which causes cytolysis by forming pores in the plasma membrane of endometrial stromal cells. The aim of the present study was to identify cell-intrinsic pathways that increase bovine endometrial stromal cell tolerance to pyolysin. Pyolysin caused dose-dependent cytolysis of bovine endometrial stromal cells and leakage of lactate dehydrogenase into supernatants. Cell tolerance to pyolysin was increased by inhibitors that target the mevalonate and cholesterol synthesis pathway, but not the mitogen-activated protein kinase, cell cycle, or metabolic pathways. Cellular cholesterol was reduced and cell tolerance to pyolysin was increased by supplying the mevalonate-derived isoprenoid farnesyl pyrophosphate, or by inhibiting farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1 or geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase 1 to increase the abundance of farnesyl pyrophosphate. Supplying the mevalonate-derived isoprenoid geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate also increased cell tolerance to pyolysin, but independent of changes in cellular cholesterol. However, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate inhibits nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group H receptors (NR1H, also known as liver X receptors), and reducing the expression of the genes encoding NR1H3 or NR1H2 increased stromal cell tolerance to pyolysin. In conclusion, mevalonate-derived isoprenoids increased bovine endometrial stromal cell tolerance to pyolysin, which was associated with reducing cellular cholesterol and inhibiting NR1H receptors.
High-sugar intake and senescence share common deleterious effects, in particular in liver, but combination of these two factors was little studied. Our aims were to examine the effect of a high-sucrose diet in liver of old rats and also the potential benefices of a polyphenol/micronutrient supplementation. Four groups of 22-month-old male rats fed during 5 months with a diet containing either 13 or 62% sucrose, supplemented or not with rutin, vitamin E, A, D, selenium, and zinc were compared. We measured liver macronutrient composition, glycation/oxidative stress, enzyme activities (lipogenesis, β-oxidation, fructokinase), gene expression (enzymes and transcription factors), in vivo protein synthesis rates and plasma parameters. Sucrose induced an increase in plasma and liver lipid content, and a stimulation of liver protein synthesis rates. Gene expression was little changed by sucrose, with lower levels for LXR-α and LXR-β. Polyphenol/micronutrient supplementation tended to limit liver triglyceride infiltration through variations in fatty acid synthase, acyl coA oxidase, and possibly ATP-citrate lyase activities. In conclusion, despite differences in enzymatic regulations, and blunted responses of gene expression, high-sucrose diet was still able to induce a marked increase in liver lipid content in old animals. However, it probably attenuated the positive impact of polyphenol/micronutrients.
Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynaecological malignancy. Obesity is a major risk factor for EC and is associated with elevated cholesterol. 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC) is a cholesterol metabolite that functions as an endogenous agonist for Liver X receptor (LXR) and a selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Exposure to oestrogenic ligands increases risk of developing EC; however, the impact of 27HC on EC is unknown. Samples of stage 1 EC (n = 126) were collected from postmenopausal women undergoing hysterectomy. Expression of LXRs (NR1H3, LXRα; NR1H2, LXRβ) and enzymes required for the synthesis (CYP27A1) or breakdown (CYP7B1) of 27HC were detected in all grades of EC. Cell lines originating from well-, moderate- and poorly-differentiated ECs (Ishikawa, RL95, MFE 280 respectively) were used to assess the impact of 27HC or the LXR agonist GW3965 on proliferation or expression of a luciferase reporter gene under the control of LXR- or ER-dependent promoters (LXRE, ERE). Incubation with 27HC or GW3965 increased transcription via LXRE in Ishikawa, RL95 and MFE 280 cells (P &lt; 0.01). 27HC selectively activated ER-dependent transcription (P &lt; 0.001) in Ishikawa cells and promoted proliferation of both Ishikawa and RL95 cells (P &lt; 0.001). In MFE 280 cells, 27HC did not alter proliferation but selective targeting of LXR with GW3965 significantly reduced cell proliferation (P &lt; 0.0001). These novel results suggest that 27HC can contribute to risk of EC by promoting proliferation of endometrial cancer epithelial cells and highlight LXR as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of advanced disease.
Dendrogenin A (DDA) is a mammalian metabolite that displays anticancer and chemopreventive properties in mice. At the cancer cell level, DDA induces differentiation and death. We investigated herein the nature of DDA cytoxicity in cancer cells. We showed that DDA triggers biochemical and cellular features of macroautophagy/autophagy and that autophagy is cytotoxic. DDA induces both the accumulation of pro-lysosomal sterols and stimulates the expression of regulators of autophagy such as NR4A, LC3 and TFEB through binding to the liver X receptor (LXR), a ligand-dependent transcription factor consisting of 2 isoforms, NR1H2 and NR1H3. These effects are not observed with canonical LXR agonists such as the oxysterol 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol or the synthetic molecules T0901317 and GW3965. DDA effects were measured on melanoma and acute myeloid leukemia cells including patient-derived leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo. Importantly the induction of lethal autophagy kills cells independently of their cytogenetic subgroups and does not differentiate bulk cancer cells from cancer cell progenitors. Together these data show that DDA drives LXR to induce the expression of autophagic genes leading to cancer cells death. This opens up new perspectives for cancer treatment.
Although male gender, aging, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and smoking are common risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm, diabetes mellitus is an independent negative risk factor. In aneurysm tissue, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) expressed by activated macrophages degrades extracellular matrix proteins. In our previous experimental study, we demonstrated that the aneurysmal formation and macrophage activity were suppressed by inhibiting mimicking hyperglycemia (HG) through upregulation of glucose-sensing nuclear receptor, Nr1h2. Here in this study, we focused on the role of HG-induced altered glucose uptake on macrophage activation.
RAW264.7 murine macrophage cells were pretreated in cultures containing HG (HG group, 15.5 mM) or normal glucose (NG) concentrations (NG group, 5.5 mM) for 7 d. The culture medium was then changed in both groups to NG conditions, and the cells were stimulated with recombinant murine soluble receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (sRANKL). Macrophage activation was confirmed by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining.
Compared with the NG group, MMP-9 expression in the HG group was significantly suppressed. Glucose uptake was increased in the NG group but not in the HG group during macrophage activation. To determine the mechanism of activation, we studied the expression and distribution of glucose transporters (Gluts) in the macrophages. Although Glut expression was unaffected by glucose pretreatment, membrane translocation of Glut-1 was significantly enhanced in macrophages in the NG group but not in the HG group during activation. Insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) messenger RNA, known stimulate to membrane translocation of Gluts, were both decreased by the HG condition but not by the NG condition.
HG pretreatment suppressed the macrophage activation. sRANKL increased macrophage glucose uptake at NG concentrations, which was impaired by HG pretreatment through the inhibition of Glut1 membrane translocation and the insulin receptor and IRS-1 gene transcription. These data suggest that HG suppressed macrophage activation, through attenuation of glucose uptake via the suppression of the membrane translocation of Glut1 and insulin signaling.
Humans are environmentally exposed not only to single endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) but to mixtures that affect their reproductive health. In reproductive tissues, microRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as key targets of EDCs. Here, we analysed changes in the testis "miRNome" (and their biogenesis mechanism) in chronically exposed adult mice to a cocktail of five EDCs containing 0.3 mg/kg-body weight (BW)/day of each phthalate (DEHP, DBP, BBP) and 0.05 mg/kg-BW/day of each alkylphenol (NP, OP), from conception to adulthood. The testis "miRNome" was characterised using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Expression levels of genes involved in miRNA biogenesis were measured by RT-qPCR, as well as several physiological and cytological parameters. We found two up-regulated, and eight down-regulated miRNAs and thirty-six differentially expressed isomiRs along with an over-expression of Drosha, Adar and Zcchc11. A significant decrease of intratesticular estradiol but not testosterone was detected. Functional analysis showed altered spermatogenesis, germ cell apoptosis and negative correlation of miR-18a-5p with Nr1h2 involved in the deregulation of the steroidogenesis pathway. Here, we present the first association between miRNA/isomiRs deregulation, their mechanisms of biogenesis and histopathological and hormonal alterations in testes of adult mice exposed to a mixture of low-dose EDCs, which can play a role in male infertility.
The genomics era has brought along the completed sequencing of a large number of bird genomes that cover a broad range of the avian phylogenetic tree (&gt;30 orders), leading to major novel insights into avian biology and evolution. Among recent findings, the discovery that birds lack a large number of protein coding genes that are organized in highly conserved syntenic clusters in other vertebrates is very intriguing, given the physiological importance of many of these genes. A considerable number of them play prominent endocrine roles, suggesting that birds evolved compensatory genetic or physiological mechanisms that allowed them to survive and thrive in spite of these losses. While further studies are needed to establish the exact extent of avian gene losses, these findings point to birds as potentially highly relevant model organisms for exploring the genetic basis and possible therapeutic approaches for a wide range of endocrine functions and disorders.
Better efficacy for predicting the risk of transplantation rejection could be achieved by intergenic interactions among single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) compared with one SNP. In this study, we explored the forewarning function of interactions among SNPs in nucleotide excision repair (NER) genes. Thirty-eight polymorphisms in eight NER genes were genotyped by Sequenom MassARRAY platform, including XPA, XPC, DDB2, XPB (ERCC3), XPD (ERCC2), ERCC1, XPF (ERCC4), and XPG (ERCC5). The haplotype analysis suggested that XPA rs3176629-rs2808668 C-T and ERCC5 G-C-C-T and G-C-T-C (OR = 1.81, 7.72 and 3.46, respectively) increased the risk of transplantation rejection; while ERCC5 rs2094258-rs751402-rs2296147-rs1047768 A-C-T-T decreased the risk (OR = 0.35). Multiple logistic regression and multifactor dimensionality reduction (DMR) analyses consistently revealed intergenic interactions among ERCC2 rs50871, ERCC5 rs1047768, and XPC rs2228001 SNPs for the risk of transplantation rejection. Taken together, the interactions among XPC rs2228001, ERCC2 rs50871 and ERCC5 rs1047768 SNPs were associated with the risk of transplantation rejection.
To study associations of cerebrovascular metabolism genotypes and haplotypes with age at Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD) onset and with neuropsychiatric symptoms according to each dementia stage.
Consecutive outpatients with late-onset AD were assessed for age at dementia onset and Neuropsychiatric Inventory scores according to Clinical Dementia Rating scores, apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) haplotypes, angiotensin-converting enzyme gene (ACE) variants rs1800764 and rs4291, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol receptor gene (LDLR) variants rs11669576 and rs5930, cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene (CETP) variants I422V and TaqIB, and liver X receptor beta gene (NR1H2) polymorphism rs2695121.
Considering 201 patients, only APOE-ɛ4 carriers had earlier dementia onset in multiple correlations, as well as less apathy, more delusions, and more aberrant motor behavior. Both ACE polymorphisms were associated with less intense frontally mediated behaviors. Regarding LDLR variants, carriers of the A allele of rs11669576 had less anxiety and more aberrant motor behavior, whereas carriers of the A allele of rs5930 had less delusions, less anxiety, more apathy, and more irritability. CETP variants that included G alleles of I422V and TaqIB were mostly associated with less intense frontally mediated behaviors, while severely impaired carriers of the T allele of rs2695121 had more anxiety and more aberrant motor behavior.
Though only APOE haplotypes affected AD onset, cerebrovascular metabolism genotypes were associated with differences in several neuropsychiatric manifestations of AD.
The sterol-responsive nuclear receptors, liver X receptors α (LXRα, NR1H3) and β (LXRβ, NR1H2), are key determinants of cellular cholesterol homeostasis. LXRs are activated under conditions of high cellular sterol load and induce expression of the cholesterol efflux transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1 to promote efflux of excess cellular cholesterol. However, the full set of genes that contribute to LXR-stimulated cholesterol efflux is unknown, and their identification is the objective of this study.
We systematically compared the global transcriptional response of macrophages to distinct classes of LXR ligands. This allowed us to identify both common and ligand-specific transcriptional responses in macrophages. Among these, we identified endonuclease-exonuclease-phosphatase family domain containing 1 (EEPD1/KIAA1706) as a direct transcriptional target of LXRs in human and murine macrophages. EEPD1 specifically localizes to the plasma membrane owing to the presence of a myristoylation site in its N terminus. Accordingly, the first 10 amino acids of EEPD1 are sufficient to confer plasma membrane localization in the context of a chimeric protein with GFP. Functionally, we report that silencing expression of EEPD1 blunts maximal LXR-stimulated Apo AI-dependent efflux and demonstrate that this is the result of reduced abundance of ABCA1 protein in human and murine macrophages.
In this study, we identify EEPD1 as a novel LXR-regulated gene in macrophages and propose that it promotes cellular cholesterol efflux by controlling cellular levels and activity of ABCA1.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) including LXRα and LXRβ are nuclear receptor transcription factors and play an important role in lipid and glucose metabolism. It has been previously reported that mice lacking LXRβ but not LXRα develop a severe urine concentrating defect, likely via a central mechanism. Here we provide evidence that LXRβ regulates water homeostasis through increasing aquaporin 2 (AQP2) protein levels in renal collecting ducts. LXRβ-/- mice exhibited a reduced response to desmopressin (dDAVP) stimulation, suggesting that the diabetes insipidus phenotype is of both central and nephrogenic origin. AQP2 protein abundance in the renal inner medulla was significantly reduced in LXRβ-/- mice but with little change in AQP2 mRNA levels. In vitro studies showed that AQP2 protein levels were elevated upon LXR agonist treatment in both primary cultured mouse inner medullary duct cells (mIMCD) and the mIMCD3 cell line with stably expressed AQP2. In addition, LXR agonists including TO901317 and GW3965 failed to induce AQP2 gene transcription but diminished its protein ubiquitination in primary cultured mIMCD cells, thereby inhibiting its degradation. Moreover, LXR activation-induced AQP2 protein expression was abolished by the protease inhibitor MG132 and the ubiquitination-deficient AQP2 (K270R). Taken together, the present study demonstrates that activation of LXRβ increases AQP2 protein levels in the renal collecting ducts via a posttranscriptional mechanism. As such, LXRβ represents a key regulator of body water homeostasis.
Gut microbiota may promote positive energy balance; however, germfree mice can be either resistant or susceptible to diet-induced obesity (DIO) depending on the type of dietary intervention. We here sought to identify the dietary constituents that determine the susceptibility to body fat accretion in germfree (GF) mice.
GF and specific pathogen free (SPF) male C57BL/6N mice were fed high-fat diets either based on lard or palm oil for 4 wks. Mice were metabolically characterized at the end of the feeding trial. FT-ICR-MS and UPLC-TOF-MS were used for cecal as well as hepatic metabolite profiling and cecal bile acids quantification, respectively. Hepatic gene expression was examined by qRT-PCR and cecal gut microbiota of SPF mice was analyzed by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
GF mice, but not SPF mice, were completely DIO resistant when fed a cholesterol-rich lard-based high-fat diet, whereas on a cholesterol-free palm oil-based high-fat diet, DIO was independent of gut microbiota. In GF lard-fed mice, DIO resistance was conveyed by increased energy expenditure, preferential carbohydrate oxidation, and increased fecal fat and energy excretion. Cecal metabolite profiling revealed a shift in bile acid and steroid metabolites in these lean mice, with a significant rise in 17β-estradiol, which is known to stimulate energy expenditure and interfere with bile acid metabolism. Decreased cecal bile acid levels were associated with decreased hepatic expression of genes involved in bile acid synthesis. These metabolic adaptations were largely attenuated in GF mice fed the palm-oil based high-fat diet. We propose that an interaction of gut microbiota and cholesterol metabolism is essential for fat accretion in normal SPF mice fed cholesterol-rich lard as the main dietary fat source. This is supported by a positive correlation between bile acid levels and specific bacteria of the order Clostridiales (phylum Firmicutes) as a characteristic feature of normal SPF mice fed lard.
In conclusion, our study identified dietary cholesterol as a candidate ingredient affecting the crosstalk between gut microbiota and host metabolism.
ALS is a rapidly progressive, devastating neurodegenerative illness of adults that produces disabling weakness and spasticity arising from death of lower and upper motor neurons. No meaningful therapies exist to slow ALS progression, and molecular insights into pathogenesis and progression are sorely needed. In that context, we used high-depth, next generation RNA sequencing (RNAseq, Illumina) to define gene network abnormalities in RNA samples depleted of rRNA and isolated from cervical spinal cord sections of 7 ALS and 8 CTL samples. We aligned &gt;50 million 2X150 bp paired-end sequences/sample to the hg19 human genome and applied three different algorithms (Cuffdiff2, DEseq2, EdgeR) for identification of differentially expressed genes (DEG's). Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) and Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) identified inflammatory processes as significantly elevated in our ALS samples, with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) found to be a major pathway regulator (IPA) and TNFα-induced protein 2 (TNFAIP2) as a major network "hub" gene (WGCNA). Using the oPOSSUM algorithm, we analyzed transcription factors (TF) controlling expression of the nine DEG/hub genes in the ALS samples and identified TF's involved in inflammation (NFkB, REL, NFkB1) and macrophage function (NR1H2::RXRA heterodimer). Transient expression in human iPSC-derived motor neurons of TNFAIP2 (also a DEG identified by all three algorithms) reduced cell viability and induced caspase 3/7 activation. Using high-density RNAseq, multiple algorithms for DEG identification, and an unsupervised gene co-expression network approach, we identified significant elevation of inflammatory processes in ALS spinal cord with TNF as a major regulatory molecule. Overexpression of the DEG TNFAIP2 in human motor neurons, the population most vulnerable to die in ALS, increased cell death and caspase 3/7 activation. We propose that therapies targeted to reduce inflammatory TNFα signaling may be helpful in ALS patients. 
The liver X receptors (LXRs, NR1H2 and NR1H3) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG, NR1C3) nuclear receptor transcription factors (TFs) are master regulators of energy homeostasis. Intriguingly, recent studies suggest that these metabolic regulators also impact tumor cell proliferation. However, a comprehensive temporal molecular characterization of the LXR and PPARG gene regulatory responses in tumor cells is still lacking.
To better define the underlying molecular processes governing the genetic control of cellular growth in response to extracellular metabolic signals, we performed a comprehensive, genome-wide characterization of the temporal regulatory cascades mediated by LXR and PPARG signaling in HT29 colorectal cancer cells. For this analysis, we applied a multi-tiered approach that incorporated cellular phenotypic assays, gene expression profiles, chromatin state dynamics, and nuclear receptor binding patterns.
Our results illustrate that the activation of both nuclear receptors inhibited cell proliferation and further decreased glutathione levels, consistent with increased cellular oxidative stress. Despite a common metabolic reprogramming, the gene regulatory network programs initiated by these nuclear receptors were widely distinct. PPARG generated a rapid and short-term response while maintaining a gene activator role. By contrast, LXR signaling was prolonged, with initial, predominantly activating functions that transitioned to repressive gene regulatory activities at late time points.
Through the use of a multi-tiered strategy that integrated various genomic datasets, our data illustrate that distinct gene regulatory programs elicit common phenotypic effects, highlighting the complexity of the genome. These results further provide a detailed molecular map of metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells through LXR and PPARG activation. As ligand-inducible TFs, these nuclear receptors can potentially serve as attractive therapeutic targets for the treatment of various cancers.
An important step towards personalizing cancer treatment is to integrate heterogeneous evidences to catalog mutational hotspots that are biologically and therapeutically relevant and thus represent where targeted therapy would likely be beneficial. However, existing methods do not sufficiently delineate varying functionality of individual mutations within the same genes.
We observed a large discordancy of mutation rates across different mutation subtypes and tumor types, and nominated 702 hotspot mutations in 549 genes in the Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) by considering context specific mutation characteristics such as genes, cancer types, mutation rates, mutation subtypes and sequence contexts. We observed that hotspot mutations were highly prevalent in Non CpG-island C/G transition and transversion sequence contexts in 10 tumor types, and specific insertion hotspot mutations were enriched in breast cancer and deletion hotspot mutations in colorectal cancer. We found that the hotspot mutations nominated by our approach were significantly more conserved than non-hotspot mutations in the corresponding cancer genes. We also examined the biological significance and pharmacogenomics properties of these hotspot mutations using data in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Cancer Cell-Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), and found that 53 hotspot mutations are independently associated with diverse functional evidences in 1) mRNA and protein expression, 2) pathway activity, or 3) drug sensitivity and 82 were highly enriched in specific tumor types. We highlighted the distinct functional indications of hotspot mutations under different contexts and nominated novel hotspot mutations such as MAP3K4 A1199 deletion, NR1H2 Q175 insertion, and GATA3 P409 insertion as potential biomarkers or drug targets.
We identified a set of hotspot mutations across 17 tumor types by considering the background mutation rate variations among genes, tumor subtypes, mutation subtypes, and sequence contexts. We illustrated the common and distinct mutational signatures of hotspot mutations among different tumor types and investigated their variable functional relevance under different contexts, which could potentially serve as a resource for explicitly selecting targets for diagnosis, drug development, and patient management.
Adipose tissues are classified into white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT). WAT is responsible for energy storage, and malfunction is associated with obesity. BAT, on the contrary, consumes fat to generate heat through uncoupling mitochondrial respiration and is important in body weight control. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A is the founding member of the VEGF family and has been found highly expressed in adipose tissue. A genetic mouse model of an inducible VEGF (VEGF-A) repression system was used to study VEGF-regulated energy metabolism in WAT. VEGF-repressed mice demonstrated lower food efficiency, lower body weight, and resistance to high-fat diet-induced obesity. Repression of VEGF expression caused morphological and molecular changes in adipose tissues. VEGF repression induced brown-like adipocyte development in WAT, up-regulation of BAT-specific genes including PRDM16, GATA-1, BMP-7, CIDEA, and UCP-1 and down-regulation of leptin, a WAT-specific gene. VEGF repression up-regulated expression of VEGF-B and its downstream fatty acid transport proteins. Relative levels of VEGF/VEGF-B may be important switches in energy metabolism and of pharmaceutical significances.
GATA transcription factors and their FOG cofactors play a key role in tissue-specific development and differentiation, from worms to humans. Mammals have six GATA and two FOG factors. We recently demonstrated that interactions between retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and GATA-1 are crucial for erythroid proliferation and differentiation. We show here that the LXCXE pRb-binding site of FOG-2 is involved in adipogenesis. Unlike GATA-1, which inhibits cell division, FOG-2 promotes proliferation. Mice with a knockin of a Fog2 gene bearing a mutated LXCXE pRb-binding site are resistant to obesity and display higher rates of white-to-brown fat conversion. Thus, each component of the GATA/FOG complex (GATA-1 and FOG-2) is involved in pRb/E2F regulation, but these molecules have markedly different roles in the control of tissue homeostasis.
Transcriptome data on the quantitative numbers of transcriptional variants expressed in primary cells offer essential clues into specific cellular functions and biological processes. We have previously collected transcriptomes from primary smooth muscle cells (SMC), interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), and PDGFRα+ cells (fibroblast-like cells) isolated from murine jejunal and colonic smooth muscle and/or mucosal tissues as well as transcriptomes from the associated tissues (jejunal smooth muscle, colonic smooth muscle, and colonic mucosa). In this study, we have built the Smooth Muscle Transcriptome Browser (SMTB), https://med.unr.edu/physio/transcriptome , a web-based, graphical user interface that offers genetic references and expression profiles of all transcripts expressed at both the cellular (SMC, ICC, and PDGFRα+ cells) and tissue level (smooth muscle and mucosal tissue). This browser brings new insights into the cellular and biological functions of the cell types in gastrointestinal smooth muscle biology.
Opioid overdose-related hospitalizations continue to rise in the United States. These hospitalizations are frequently associated with arrhythmia which can increase in-hospital mortality and resource utilization. We describe temporal trends in the hospitalizations for opioid overdose, associated arrhythmias, and their impact on in-hospital mortality, length of stay and cost of hospitalizations. The purpose of this study was to identify incidence of arrhythmia and their impact on in-hospital outcomes with opioid overdose hospitalizations.
The study utilized data from the National Inpatient Sample from January 2005 to September 2015. Previously employed International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes were utilized to identify opioid overdose and associated arrhythmias. The analysis was performed using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Temporal trends were measured using Jonckheere-Terpstra Trend test.
A total of 430,460 adult hospitalizations with opioid overdose were included in this study. Atrial fibrillation (N = 17,695, 4.1%) was the most frequent arrhythmia associated with opioid overdose, the trend of which increased significantly during the study period. All-cause in-hospital mortality increased substantially with arrhythmias, highest with ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. The incidence of arrhythmias was associated with longer length of stay and higher cost of hospitalizations as well.
Incidence of new-onset arrhythmia with opioid overdose lead to higher in-hospital mortality which can further increase the length of hospitalization and cost of care.
In our previous study the synergism of four combinations of Zuccagnia punctata (ZpE) and Larrea nitida (LnE) exudates with the reliable statistical-based MixLow method was assessed, and the markers of the most anti-C. albicans synergistic ZpE-LnE bi-herbal combination were quantified according to European Medicines Agency (EMA).
To study the mechanisms of action as well as the cytotoxic properties of the ZpE-LnE most synergistic combination found in the previous work.
Minimum Fungicidal Concentration (MFC) and rate of killing of ZpE-LnE were assessed with the microbroth dilution and the time-kill assays respectively. Morphological alterations were observed with both confocal and fluorescence microscopy on the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The ergosterol exogenous assay, the quantification of ergosterol, the sorbitol as well as glucan synthase (GS) and chitin synthase (ChS) assays were used to detect the effects on the fungal membrane and cell wall respectively. The capacity of ZpE-LnE of inhibiting Candida virulence factors was assessed with previously reported methods. The effect of ZpE-LnE and of ZpE or LnE alone on cell viability was determined on human hepatoma cells line Huh7.
ZpE-Ln E was fungicidal killing C. albicans in a shorter time than amphotericin B and produced malformations in S. pombe cells. ZpE-LnE showed to bind to ergosterol but not to inhibit any step of the ergosterol biosynthesis. ZpE-LnE showed a low or moderate capacity of inhibiting GS and ChS. Regarding inhibition of virulence factors, ZpE-LnE significantly decreased the capacity of adhesion to eukaryotic buccal epithelial cells (BECs), did not inhibit the germ tube formation and inhibited the secretion of phospholipases and proteinases but not of haemolysins. ZpE-LnE demonstrated very low toxicity on Huh7 cells, much lower than that each extract alone.
The fungicidal properties of ZpE-LnE against C. albicans, its dual mechanism of action targeting the fungal membrane's ergosterol as well as the cell wall, its capacity of inhibiting several important virulence factors added to its low toxicity, make ZpE-LnE a good candidate for the development of a new antifungal bi-Herbal Medicinal Product.
Ca2+ imaging of isolated cells or specific types of cells within intact tissues often reveals complex patterns of Ca2+ signaling. This activity requires careful and in-depth analyses and quantification to capture as much information about the underlying events as possible. Spatial, temporal and intensity parameters intrinsic to Ca2+ signals such as frequency, duration, propagation, velocity and amplitude may provide some biological information required for intracellular signalling. High-resolution Ca2+ imaging typically results in the acquisition of large data files that are time consuming to process in terms of translating the imaging information into quantifiable data, and this process can be susceptible to human error and bias. Analysis of Ca2+ signals from cells in situ typically relies on simple intensity measurements from arbitrarily selected regions of interest (ROI) within a field of view (FOV). This approach ignores much of the important signaling information contained in the FOV. Thus, in order to maximize recovery of information from such high-resolution recordings obtained with Ca2+dyes or optogenetic Ca2+ imaging, appropriate spatial and temporal analysis of the Ca2+ signals is required. The protocols outlined in this paper will describe how a high volume of data can be obtained from Ca2+ imaging recordings to facilitate more complete analysis and quantification of Ca2+ signals recorded from cells using a combination of spatiotemporal map (STM)-based analysis and particle-based analysis. The protocols also describe how different patterns of Ca2+ signaling observed in different cell populations in situ can be analyzed appropriately. For illustration, the method will examine Ca2+ signaling in a specialized population of cells in the small intestine, interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), using GECIs.
Cilia are cell-surface, microtubule-based organelles that project into extracellular space. Motile cilia are conserved throughout eukaryotes, and their beat induces the flow of fluid, relative to cell surfaces. In mammals, the coordinated beat of motile cilia provides highly specialized functions associated with the movement of luminal contents, as seen with metachronal waves transporting mucus in the respiratory tract. Motile cilia are also present in the male and female reproductive tracts. In the female, wave-like motions of oviductal cilia transport oocytes and embryos toward the uterus. A similar function has been assumed for motile cilia in efferent ductules of the male-i.e., to transport immotile sperm from rete testis into the epididymis. However, we report here that efferent ductal cilia in the male do not display a uniform wave-like beat to transport sperm solely in one direction, but rather exert a centripetal force on luminal fluids through whip-like beating with continual changes in direction, generating turbulence, which maintains immotile spermatozoa in suspension within the lumen. Genetic ablation of two miRNA clusters (miR-34b/c and -449a/b/c) led to failure in multiciliogenesis in murine efferent ductules due to dysregulation of numerous genes, and this mouse model allowed us to demonstrate that loss of efferent duct motile cilia causes sperm aggregation and agglutination, luminal obstruction, and sperm granulomas, which, in turn, induce back-pressure atrophy of the testis and ultimately male infertility.
Kinetoplastid parasites, included Trypanosoma cruzi, the causal agent of Chagas disease, present a unique genome organization and gene expression. Although they control gene expression mainly post-transcriptionally, chromatin accessibility plays a fundamental role in transcription initiation control. We have previously shown that High Mobility Group B protein from Trypanosoma cruzi (TcHMGB) can bind DNA in vitro. Here, we show that TcHMGB also acts as an architectural protein in vivo, since the overexpression of this protein induces changes in the nuclear structure, mainly the reduction of the nucleolus and a decrease in the heterochromatin:euchromatin ratio. Epimastigote replication rate was markedly reduced presumably due to a delayed cell cycle progression with accumulation of parasites in G2/M phase and impaired cytokinesis. Some functions involved in pathogenesis were also altered in TcHMGB-overexpressing parasites, like the decreased efficiency of trypomastigotes to infect cells in vitro, the reduction of intracellular amastigotes replication and the number of released trypomastigotes. Taken together, our results suggest that the TcHMGB protein is a pleiotropic player that controls cell phenotype and it is involved in key cellular processes.
Inhibition of the P2Y12 receptor by an oral P2Y12 inhibitor with loading doses along with Cyclooxygenase-1 inhibition by aspirin is considered a first-line treatment strategy in patients with the acute coronary syndrome and patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Limitations associated with oral P2Y12 receptor inhibitors include a requirement for in vivo conversion (thienopyridines), delayed onset of action, suboptimal inhibition, irreversible inhibition (thienopyridines), and delayed offset. In the acute setting, therapy with potent platelet inhibitors that have a fast onset and offset is desirable to attenuate thrombotic complications. Cangrelor, an intravenous agent, is an adenosine triphosphate analog, selectively and explicitly blocking P2Y12 receptor-mediated platelet activation. Cangrelor has been studied in a series of CHAMPION trials. A patient-level, meta-analysis of all 3 phase III trials (24,910 patients), demonstrated that cangrelor significantly reduced the rate of the composite outcome of death, myocardial infarction, ischemia-driven revascularization, or stent thrombosis at 48 hours and 30 days compared with clopidogrel, with no significant increase in major bleeding. It is approved for clinical use in patients undergoing PCI to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, repeat revascularization, and stent thrombosis in patients who have not been treated with a P2Y12 platelet inhibitor and are not being given a GPIIbIIIa inhibitor. In conclusion, patients unable to take oral medications undergoing emergent/urgent PCI and those who had recent PCI with drug eluting stent in need for urgent cardiac or noncardiac surgery are potential candidates for cangrelor.
Patients with diabetes often develop gastrointestinal motor problems, including gastroparesis. Previous studies have suggested this gastric motor disorder was a consequence of an enteric neuropathy. Disruptions in interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) have also been reported. A thorough examination of functional changes in gastric motor activity during diabetes has not yet been performed. We comprehensively examined the gastric antrums of Lepob mice using functional, morphological, and molecular techniques to determine the pathophysiological consequences in this type 2 diabetic animal model. Video analysis and isometric force measurements revealed higher frequency and less robust antral contractions in Lepob mice compared with controls. Electrical pacemaker activity was reduced in amplitude and increased in frequency. Populations of enteric neurons, ICC, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor α+ cells were unchanged. Analysis of components of the prostaglandin pathway revealed upregulation of multiple enzymes and receptors. Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase-2 inhibition increased slow wave amplitudes and reduced frequency of diabetic antrums. In conclusion, gastric pacemaker and contractile activity is disordered in type 2 diabetic mice, and this appears to be a consequence of excessive prostaglandin signaling. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis may provide a novel treatment for diabetic gastric motility disorders.
Catchment hydro-physical controls on the interannual variability of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in terrestrial watershed runoff, important for water quality, ecosystem structure, and foodweb dynamics, are not well understood. To address this, we simulated water residence time ("age") and flow path of terrestrial runoff and analyzed their mediating effect on relationships between annual runoff volume, DOC concentration, and DOC age. We applied this analysis to a snow-influenced watershed in California's Sierra Nevada (USA) across a range of soil types, elevations (90-4210 m), and years (1950-1999). Simulated increases in annual runoff volume were accompanied by younger ages (r2 = 0.53-0.63) of DOC in quickflow, comprised of surface runoff and lateral flow through soil. Increases in annual runoff volume were also accompanied by gentler relationships between intra-annual (weekly) values of DOC concentration and runoff volume, regression-slopes of which followed a power-law relationship to annual runoff (r2 = 0.12-0.92) for approximately 70% of the watershed. Simulations including dynamics of water age and soil temperature produced annual ages of quickflow DOC ranging from 1 to 70 days over all soil types and water years. Similarity of this range to an observed, 1-69 day range in half-lives of relatively labile DOC in previous studies suggests substantial interannual and spatial variability in the biodegradability of DOC in terrestrial runoff. Simulations excluding dynamics of water age and soil temperature predicted order-of-magnitude less interannual variability in age of quickflow DOC, demonstrating the important effect of interannual variability in soil-water interaction times. These findings suggest that the distribution of DOC bioprocessing along transitions between terrestrial and aquatic systems may be strongly influenced by year-to-year variability in age of water.
We present a series of novel observations about interactions between flicker and motion that lead to three distinct perceptual effects. We use the term flicker to describe alternating changes in a stimulus' luminance or color (i.e. a circle that flickers from black to white and visa-versa). When objects flicker, three distinct phenomena can be observed: (1) Flicker Induced Motion (FLIM) in which a single, stationary object, appears to move when it flickers at certain rates; (2) Flicker Induced Motion Suppression (FLIMS) in which a moving object appears to be stationary when it flickers at certain rates, and (3) Flicker-Induced Induced-Motion (FLIIM) in which moving objects that are flickering induce another flickering stationary object to appear to move. Across four psychophysical experiments, we characterize key stimulus parameters underlying these flicker-motion interactions. Interactions were strongest in the periphery and at flicker frequencies above 10 Hz. Induced motion occurred not just for luminance flicker, but for isoluminant color changes as well. We also found that the more physically moving objects there were, the more motion induction to stationary objects occurred. We present demonstrations that the effects reported here cannot be fully accounted for by eye movements: we show that the perceived motion of multiple stationary objects that are induced to move via flicker can appear to move independently and in random directions, whereas eye movements would have caused all of the objects to appear to move coherently. These effects highlight the fundamental role of spatiotemporal dynamics in the representation of motion and the intimate relationship between flicker and motion.
Among hepatic diseases, cholestatic ductopenic cholangiopathies are poorly studied, and they are rarely given the importance they deserve, especially considering their high incidence in clinical practice. Although cholestatic ductopenic cholangiopathies have different etiologies and pathogenesis, all have the same target (the cholangiocyte) and similar mechanistic basis of cell death. Cholestatic cholangiopathies are characterized, predominantly, by obstructive or functional damage in the biliary epithelium, resulting in an imbalance between proliferation and cholangiocellular death; this leads to the progressive disappearance of bile ducts, as has been shown to occur in primary sclerosing cholangitis, primary biliary cholangitis, low-phospholipid-associated cholelithiasis syndrome, cystic fibrosis-related liver disease, and drug-induced ductopenia, among other biliary disorders. This review summarizes the features of the more common ductopenic syndromes and the cellular mechanisms involved in cholengiocellular death, with focus on the main forms of cholangiocyte death described so far, namely apoptosis, autophagy, necrosis, and necroptosis. It also emphasizes the importance to study in depth the molecular mechanisms of cholengiocyte death to make possible to counteract them with therapeutic purposes. These therapeutic strategies are limited in number and efficacy at present, and this is why it is important to find complementary, safe strategies to stimulate cholangiocellular proliferation in order favor bile duct replenishment as well. Successful in finding appropriate treatments would prevent the patient from having liver transplantation as the only therapeutic alternative.
Most animals depend upon olfaction to find food, mates, and to avoid predators. An animal's olfactory circuit helps it sense its olfactory environment and generate critical behavioral responses. The general architecture of the olfactory circuit, which is conserved across species, is made up of a few different neuronal types including first-order receptor neurons, second- and third-order neurons, and local interneurons. Each neuronal type differs in their morphology, physiology, and neurochemistry. However, several recent studies have suggested that there is intrinsic diversity even among neurons of the same type and that this diversity is important for neural function. In this review, we first examine instances of intrinsic diversity observed among individual types of olfactory neurons. Next, we review potential genetic and experience-based plasticity mechanisms that underlie this diversity. Finally, we consider the implications of intrinsic neuronal diversity for circuit function. Overall, we hope to highlight the importance of intrinsic diversity as a previously underestimated property of circuit function.
The extension of π-conjugation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) via alkyne benzannulation reactions has become an increasingly utilized tool over the past few years. This short review will highlight recent work of alkyne benzannulations in the context of large nanographene as well as graphene nanoribbon synthesis along with a brief discussion of the interesting physical properties these molecules display.
Approximately five million United States (U.S.) adults are diagnosed with heart failure (HF), with eight million U.S. adults projected to suffer from HF by 2030. With five-year mortality rates following HF diagnosis approximating 50%, novel therapeutic treatments are needed for HF patients. Pre-clinical animal models of HF have highlighted histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors as efficacious therapeutics that can stop and potentially reverse cardiac remodeling and dysfunction linked with HF development. HDACs remove acetyl groups from nucleosomal histones, altering DNA-histone protein electrostatic interactions in the regulation of gene expression. However, HDACs also remove acetyl groups from non-histone proteins in various tissues. Changes in histone and non-histone protein acetylation plays a key role in protein structure and function that can alter other post translational modifications (PTMs), including protein phosphorylation. Protein phosphorylation is a well described PTM that is important for cardiac signal transduction, protein activity and gene expression, yet the functional role for acetylation-phosphorylation cross-talk in the myocardium remains less clear. This review will focus on the regulation and function for acetylation-phosphorylation cross-talk in the heart, with a focus on the role for HDACs and HDAC inhibitors as regulators of acetyl-phosphorylation cross-talk in the control of cardiac function.
Pathways linking activation of the insulin receptor to downstream targets of insulin have traditionally been studied using a candidate gene approach. To elucidate additional pathways regulating insulin activity, we performed a forward chemical-genetics screen based on translocation of a glucose transporter 4 (Glut4) reporter expressed in murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes. To identify compounds with known targets, we screened drug-repurposing and natural product libraries. We identified, confirmed, and validated 64 activators and 65 inhibitors that acutely increase or rapidly decrease cell-surface Glut4 in adipocytes stimulated with submaximal insulin concentrations. These agents were grouped by target, chemical class, and mechanism of action. All groups contained multiple hits from a single drug class, and several comprised multiple structurally unrelated hits for a single target. Targets include the β-adrenergic and adenosine receptors. Agonists of these receptors increased and inverse agonists/antagonists decreased cell-surface Glut4 independently of insulin. Additional activators include insulin sensitizers (thiazolidinediones), insulin mimetics, dis-inhibitors (the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin), cardiotonic steroids (the Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitor ouabain), and corticosteroids (dexamethasone). Inhibitors include heterocyclic amines (tricyclic antidepressants) and 21 natural product supplements and herbal extracts. Mechanisms of action include effects on Glut4 trafficking, signal transduction, inhibition of protein synthesis, and dissipation of proton gradients. Two pathways that acutely regulate Glut4 translocation were discovered: de novo protein synthesis and endocytic acidification. The mechanism of action of additional classes of activators (tanshinones, dalbergiones, and coumarins) and inhibitors (flavonoids and resveratrol) remains to be determined. These tools are among the most sensitive, responsive, and reproducible insulin-activity assays described to date.
Since cancer is a heterogeneous disease, tumor subtyping is crucial for improved treatment and prognosis. We have developed a subtype discovery tool, called PINSPlus, that is: i) robust against noise and unstable quantitative assays, ii) able to integrate multiple types of omics data in a single analysis, and iii) dramatically superior to established approaches in identifying known subtypes and novel subgroups with significant survival differences. Our validation on 12,344 samples from 44 datasets shows that PINSPlus vastly outperforms other approaches. The software is easy-to-use and can partition hundreds of patients in a few minutes on a personal computer.
The package is available at https://cran.r-project.org/package=PINSPlus. Data and R script used in this manuscript are available at https://bioinformatics.cse.unr.edu/software/PINSPlus/.

Recent availability of biodiversity data resources has enabled an unprecedented ability to estimate phylogenetically based biodiversity metrics over broad scales. Such approaches elucidate ecological and evolutionary processes yielding a biota and help guide conservation efforts. However, the choice of appropriate phylogenetic resources and underlying input data uncertainties may affect interpretation. Here, we address how differences among phylogenetic source trees and levels of phylogenetic uncertainty affect these metrics and test existing hypotheses regarding geographic biodiversity patterns across the diverse vascular plant flora of Florida, US. Ecological niche models for 1,490 Florida species were combined with a "purpose-built" phylogenetic tree (phylogram and chronogram), as well as with trees derived from community resources (Phylomatic and Open Tree of Life). There were only modest differences in phylodiversity metrics given the phylogenetic source tree and taking into account the level of phylogenetic uncertainty; we identify similar areas of conservation interest across Florida regardless of the method used.
Cholesterol, via sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) transcription factors, activates or represses genes involved in its hepatic biosynthetic pathway, and also modulates the expression of hepatocyte mitochondrial aquaporin-8 (mtAQP8), a channel that can function as peroxiporin by facilitating the transmembrane diffusion of H2O2. Here we tested the hypothesis that mtAQP8 is involved in the SREBP-mediated regulation of hepatocyte cholesterol biosynthesis. Using human hepatocyte-derived Huh-7 cells and primary rat hepatocytes, we found that mtAQP8 knockdown significantly downregulated de novo cholesterol synthesis as well as protein expressions of SREBP-2 and its target gene, a rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA Reductase (HMGCR). In contrast, adenovirus-mediated human AQP8 mitochondrial expression significantly increased de novo cholesterol synthesis and protein expressions of SREBP-2 and HMGCR. In mtAQP8-overexpressed hepatocytes, mitochondrial H2O2 release was found to be increased; and a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant prevented the upregulation of mitochondrial H2O2 release and that of cholesterol synthesis. Our results suggest that peroxiporin mtAQP8 plays a role in the SREBP-controlled hepatocyte cholesterogenesis, a finding that might be relevant to cholesterol-related metabolic disorders.
To examine whether internal resiliency and external assets directly protect juvenile offenders exposed to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) from psychological distress and moderate the relationship between ACE exposure and psychological distress.
A total of 429 male and female adolescents involved with juvenile justice systems in a Western state completed an audio computer-assisted self-interview. Validated measures assessed ACEs, psychological distress, internal resiliency, and external youth assets. Hierarchical linear regression was used to assess the direct and moderating protective effects of internal resilience, family communication, school connectedness, peer role models, and nonparental role models on psychological distress. All models controlled for age, sex, race/ethnicity, free/reduced lunch qualification, current custody, supervision status, detention, and site.
The mean ACE score among participants was 3.7 (standard deviation = 2.2) and 52.8% reported four or more ACEs. Participants with 4-5 ACEs (β = .37, p &lt; .001) and 6-8 ACEs (β = .49, p &lt; .001) were at increased risk for psychological distress. High internal resilience (β = -.20, p &lt; .001), family communication (β = -.19, p &lt; .001), school connectedness (β = -.14, p &lt; .01), and peer role models (β = -.09, p &lt; .05) were associated with a reduction in psychological distress in the presence of high ACE exposure. In the interaction models, having a high number of ACEs remained strongly associated with increased psychological distress. However, internal resilience (β = -.24, p &lt; .01) and school connectedness (β = -.18, p &lt; .05) significantly moderated (reduced) the relationship between high ACE exposure and psychological distress.
Our findings suggest that programs and policies that promote internal resilience and protective factors across multiple levels of influence may protect juvenile offenders exposed to childhood trauma from psychological distress.
The Los Angeles County Jail system is the largest jail system in the United States, with an average daily inmate population of 17,024 in 2017. Existing literature shows the weeks following release from incarceration are associated with increased risk of overdose death among individuals who previously used opioids. One response is to train inmates in overdose prevention and response (OPR) and to provide the opioid antagonist naloxone on release. However, in large jail systems training all inmates can be logistically and financially difficult, leading to interest identifying individuals most likely to benefit from such programs.
In 2017, the Los Angeles County Office of Diversion and Reentry collaborated with the Los Angeles County Sheriff Department to conduct an OPR needs assessment evaluation with all inmates entering the jail over a two week period.
3781 inmates provided complete data for this analysis (3315 men, 466 women). 17% reported using opioids within the last 12 months, 7% reported witnessing an overdose within the last 12 months, and 5% report ever having received medication assisted treatment (MAT). 39% reported interest in being trained in overdose prevention and response. The single largest predictor of interest in OPR was being present at an overdose in the past year.
Our results suggest OPR should be provided to all inmates who opt-in to receiving training regardless of other risk factors. Our results also suggest this population has had little prior exposure to MAT and incarceration could represent a significant opportunity to provide such evidence-based treatments.
Apomixis is an asexual reproductive mode via seeds that generate maternal clonal progenies. Although apomixis in grasses is mainly expressed at the polyploid level, some natural diploid genotypes of Paspalum rufum produce aposporous embryo sacs in relatively high proportions and are even able to complete apomixis under specific conditions. However, despite the potential for apomixis, sexuality prevails in diploids, and apomixis expression is repressed for an as yet undetermind reason. Apomixis is thought to derive from a deregulation of one or a few components of the sexual pathway that could be triggered by polyploidy and/or hybridization. The objectives of this work were to characterize and compare the reproductive development and the timing of apospory initial (AI) emergence between diploid genotypes with potential for apomixis and facultative apomictic tetraploid cytotypes of P. rufum.
Reproductive characterization was performed by cytoembryological observations of cleared ovaries and anthers during all reproductive development steps and by quantitative evaluation of the ovule growth parameters.
Cytoembryological observations showed that in diploids, both female and male reproductive development is equally synchronized, but in tetraploids, megasporogenesis and early megagametogenesis are delayed with respect to microsporogenesis and early microgametogenesis. This delay was also seen when ovary growth was taken as a reference parameter. The analysis of the onset of AIs revealed that they emerge during different developmental periods depending on the ploidy level. In diploids, the AIs appeared along with the tetrad (or triad) of female meiocytes, but in tetraploids they appeared earlier, at the time of the megaspore mother cell. In both cytotypes, AIs can be seen even during megagametogenesis.
Overall observations reveal that female sexual reproductive development is delayed in tetraploids as compared with diploid genotypes, mainly at meiosis. In tetraploids, AIs appear at earlier sexual developmental stages than in diploids, and they accumulate up to the end of megasporogenesis. The longer extension of megasporogenesis in tetraploids could favour AI emergence and also apomixis success.
Dental morphology is becoming increasingly visible in forensic anthropology as part of the estimation of ancestry. As methods are developed based on these data, it is important to understand the role of observer error in data collection and method application. In this study, 10 observers collected dental morphological data on 19 traits on the same set of nine plaques. Various measures of interrater reliability were calculated to assess observer error. Data were then input into one of three ancestry estimation methods based on dental morphology to understand the role of observer error in these methods. Results show low rater reliability for all dental morphological traits when all 10 observers are compared. Rater reliability increases when only experienced observers are compared and traits are dichotomized. Further, differences in trait scores by observers resulted in disparate estimations of ancestry in each of the methods. While observer error appears to be an issue in dental morphological methods of ancestry estimation, these problems can be addressed. An argument is made for advanced training in dental anthropology in laboratories and in graduate programs. Further, methods need to test for and employ traits with high rater agreement.
The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (Afib) has been increasing over the past few decades. There are very few comparisons of health insurance plans available that incorporate measurement of co-morbidities and in-hospital outcomes. We sought to compare an impact of Medicaid versus private insurance (PI) on outcomes in hospitalizations with Afib. The US National Inpatient Sample database from years January 2010 to September 2015 was used to identify adult (≥18 years) Afib hospitalizations, whose payment source was either Medicaid or PI. We included propensity score-matched analysis for comparison of outcomes between the groups. In a total of 3,264,258 Afib hospitalizations, 22.9% hospitalizations were insured with Medicaid, while 77.1% had PI. Compared with PI, Medicaid beneficiaries (MB) were younger (59 vs 64 years), fewer were men (55.15% vs 63.16%), and fewer were Caucasians (52.66% vs 81.67%; all p&lt;0.0001). As suggested by Charlson co-morbidity index ≥3, more MB (40.86%) had the significantly higher burden of co-morbidities compared with PI (29.87%; p&lt;0.0001). About 83% of Afib hospitalizations had a CHA2DVASC2 score ≥2 in both the groups. After adjusting for confounders, in-hospital mortality was significantly higher (4.8% vs 4.3%, p = 0.02) in MB compared with PI. In MB, 55.3% hospitalizations were discharged to home and their median length of hospital stay was 5 days, whereas 61.3% hospitalizations with PI were discharged to home and their median length of stay was 4 days (p&lt;0.0001). In conclusion, this extensive study of Afib hospitalizations, Medicaid group had greater co-morbidities, marginally higher in-hospital mortality, longer length of stay, and lesser disposition to home as compared with PI group.
The evolution of herbicide-resistant weeds is one of the most important concerns of global agriculture. Amaranthus hybridus L. is a competitive weed for summer crops in South America. In this article, we intend to unravel the molecular mechanisms by which an A. hybridus population from Argentina has become resistant to extraordinarily high levels of glyphosate.
The glyphosate-resistant population (A) exhibited particularly high parameters of resistance (GR50  = 20 900 g ai ha-1 , Rf = 314), with all plants completing a normal life cycle even after 32X dose application. No shikimic acid accumulation was detected in the resistant plants at any of the glyphosate concentrations tested. Molecular and genetic analyses revealed a novel triple substitution (TAP-IVS: T102I, A103V, and P106S) in the 5-enol-pyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) enzyme of population A and an incipient increase on the epsps relative copy number but without effects on the epsps transcription levels. The novel mechanism was prevalent, with 48% and 52% of the individuals being homozygous and heterozygous for the triple substitution, respectively. In silico conformational studies revealed that TAP-IVS triple substitution would generate an EPSPS with a functional active site but with an increased restriction to glyphosate binding.
The prevalence of the TAP-IVS triple substitution as the sole mechanism detected in the highly glyphosate resistant population suggests the evolution of a new glyphosate resistance mechanism arising in A. hybridus. This is the first report of a naturally occurring EPSPS triple substitution and the first glyphosate target-site resistance mechanism described in A. hybridus. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.
Vaginal candidiasis is considered a frequent opportunistic mucosal infection and the second most common cause of vaginitis after bacterial vaginosis. In this work, different vaginal films based on chitosan, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and blends of these polymers containing tioconazole, were developed and thoroughly characterized to improve the conventional therapeutics of vaginal candidiasis. Mechanical properties, swelling, adhesiveness, morphology, antifungal activity, hemocompatibility and cytotoxicity were evaluated. The drug solid state in the films was analyzed by thermal and X-ray diffraction analysis. Films showed homogeneous surfaces and presented similar mechanical properties and adhesiveness. Time-kill studies displayed that films were more active than both tioconazole pure drug and traditional tioconazole ovule against Candida albicans, which is probably related to the fact that tioconazole is in amorphous state inside the films. Although all formulations proved to be hemocompatible, films based only on chitosan exhibited a certain degree of cytotoxicity and therefore they should be avoided. The system based on chitosan-hydroxypropyl methylcellulose with 40% PEG 400 as plasticizer presented fast antimicrobial activity as well as the lowest swelling. Additionally, this formulation did not produce substantial hemolytic and cytotoxic effects, indicating that films based on chitosan-hydroxypropyl methylcellulose could be a promising alternative dosage form for the treatment of vaginal candidiasis.
Using stimuli from different categories may expand the capacity limits of working memory (WM) by spreading item representations across distinct neural populations. We explored this mixed-category benefit by correlating individuals' behavioral performance with fMRI measures of category information during uniform- and mixed-category trials. Behaviorally, we found weak evidence for a mixed-category benefit at the group-level, although there was a high degree of individual variability. To test whether distinct neural patterns elicited superior performance in some individuals, we correlated a multivariate measure of neural category information with multiple behavioral metrics. This revealed a widespread positive relationship, intuitive for hit rate and working memory capacity, but counterintuitive for false alarm rate. Overall, these data suggest that mixed-category effects may support working memory performance, but unexpectedly, not all participants show this benefit. Only some people may be able to take advantage of representing mixed-category information in a differentiable way.
Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) is a genetically diverse Andean crop that has earned special attention worldwide due to its nutritional and health benefits and its ability to adapt to contrasting environments, including nutrient-poor and saline soils and drought stressed marginal agroecosystems. Drought and salinity are the abiotic stresses most studied in quinoa; however, studies of other important stress factors, such as heat, cold, heavy metals, and UV-B light irradiance, are severely limited. In the last few decades, the incidence of abiotic stress has been accentuated by the increase in unpredictable weather patterns. Furthermore, stresses habitually occur as combinations of two or more. The goals of this review are to: (1) provide an in-depth description of the existing knowledge of quinoa's tolerance to different abiotic stressors; (2) summarize quinoa's physiological responses to these stressors; and (3) describe novel advances in molecular tools that can aid our understanding of the mechanisms underlying quinoa's abiotic stress tolerance.
The feminist movement installed a political debate regarding the right to abortion in 2018, proposing a transformation not only in the praxis of democracy, but also in its substance, through the decriminalization and legalization of abortion. In this context, this article seeks to describe and evaluate the democratic conflict produced based on the reasons and justifications underpinning the disputed content, in favor and against abortion. It also seeks to summarize the principal constitutional and conventional rulings that, by regulating abortion, shed light on the normative universe of what ought to be, in which human rights are inscribed. Lastly, the article attempts to explain how political control over body sovereignty was constructed and implemented in a patriarchal system, with sufficient legitimacy and power to last for centuries. Although there are no legal obstacles to the decriminalization and legalization of abortion, why is that the interests of freedom for women are not fully enabled within their array of rights, including the social right to health? What other interests, other than those of women, does this freedom represent?
El movimiento feminista instaló el conflicto político por el derecho al aborto en 2018 y con él se propone consolidar una transformación en la sustancia de la democracia, -despenalización y legalización- y no solo en su praxis. En este contexto, este artículo se propone describir y valorar el conflicto en democracia sobre la base de las razones y fundamentos del contenido de la disputa, a favor y en contra del aborto, y reseñar las principales disposiciones constitucionales y convencionales que, al regular el aborto, echan luz acerca del universo normativo, del “deber ser”, en el que se inscribe como derecho humano. Por último, intentamos explicar cómo se construyó e instrumentó el control político de la soberanía de los cuerpos en un sistema patriarcal, con la legitimidad suficiente y con el poder necesario para perdurar durante siglos. Si bien no existen obstáculos jurídicos para la despenalización y la legalización del aborto, ¿por qué los intereses de libertad de las mujeres no están plenamente habilitados en todos sus derechos, entre ellos, en los derechos sociales de salud? o ¿qué otros intereses, que no sean los propios, representan esa libertad?
Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was applied to measure the Tg of rice IRGA 424 at different moisture content values (9.3%-22.3% wet basis). To conduct temperature sweeps, the samples were heated at a rate of 2°C/min from 20 to 120°C keeping frequency to 1 Hz. Tg was measured both from the E″ peak temperature (Tgmidpoint) and from the tan (δ) peak temperature (Tgendset). Tgmidpoint and Tgendset increased from 31.8 to 86.6°C and 42.1 to 104.7°C, respectively, as moisture content decreased from 22.3 to 9.3%. Six models were tested for their ability to predict Tg as a function of the moisture content. As all residuals were normally distributed and homoskedastic, standard metrics were used to assess the fitted models. Goodness of fit by these models was established by comparing the coefficient of determination (R2), standard error of the estimate (SEE), and mean relative deviation (MRD). The Gordon-Taylor linearized equation was the most accurate in predicting Tg. To predict Tg from the moisture content of the rice samples, a new expression was proposed. For the conditions considered in this work, the developed equation satisfactorily predicts the Tg of rice IRGA 424 without needing prior linearization.
Vitamin K2, which is present in dairy products and has been recommended as a micronutrient supplement in humans, contains anticancer properties. Interferon (IFN)-α-2b administered during development of hepatic preneoplasia decreased both number and volume percentage of altered hepatic foci (AHF) by increasing apoptosis in the foci. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of IFN-α-2b treatment supplemented with vitamin K2 in the early stages of liver cancer development in rats.
Adult male Wistar rats were subjected to a two-phase model of hepatocarcinogenesis (initiated-promoted [IP] group). Animals were divided into four groups: untreated (IP), IP treated with IFN-α-2b (6.5 × 105 U/kg), IP treated with vitamin K2 (10 mg/kg), and IP treated with both compounds.
The study results demonstrated that vitamin K2 blocked IFN-α-2b-induced reduction in size and volume of the altered hepatic foci and inhibited IFN-α-2b-induced apoptosis. Its inhibition of IFN-α-2b-induced apoptosis was mediated by increased levels of total hepatic Bcl-2 in rat preneoplastic livers.
These findings demonstrate that supportive vitamin supplements or therapies are not always safe because they could put the life of patients treated with IFN-α-2b at risk.
Emerging evidence suggests that the incidence of colorectal cancer is increasing among individuals under the age of 50 years. However, the pattern of disease presentation in young patients remains under investigation. This is a retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC) between 2004 and 2015. Data was acquired from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 18 program registries. A total of 269,398 patients who met the inclusion criteria were included in the final analysis. The primary outcomes were the likelihood of metastatic disease at diagnosis and survival. Of the 269,389 patients diagnosed with CRC, 11.8% of the patients were young (20 to 49 years), 45.6% were middle-aged (50 to 69 years), and 42.6% were elderly (70 years or older). Individuals in the middle-aged and elderly cohorts were significantly less likely to present with metastatic disease as compared to the young cohort (middle-aged adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.70 to 0.75, elderly aOR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.47 to 0.50). However, overall survival was longest in the young cohort. We conclude that young individuals with colorectal cancer have an increased risk of presenting with distant metastases as compared to the middle-aged and elderly, but, nevertheless, exhibit prolonged survival.
The complex life cycle of Trichinella spiralis includes the migration of newborn larvae through the bloodstream to their encystment in muscle. The parasite establishes an intimate contact with the erythrocytes of the host both during the migration of the newborn larvae and when encysting, as this parasite causes intense vascularization in the muscle cell. The goal of this work was to study the effects of various concentrations of T. spiralis muscle larvae (ML) on erythrocyte membranes. The treatment was performed by incubating human erythrocytes with equal volume of different concentrations of ML for 30 minutes, with controlled agitation (37°C). The control erythrocytes (with no contact with the larvae) were incubated in the same way with an equal volume of physiological solution. To evaluate the alterations to the erythrocytes by the action of the larvae and in the respective controls, an Erythrocyte Rheometer and a Digital Image Analysis technique were used. The results indicated that when the larval concentration was higher, the aggregation and erythrocyte membrane alterations were also higher. Also, the erythrocyte deformability index and the erythrocyte elasticity increased. The values of isolated cell coefficient varied from 0.51 in the treatment with 100 larvae/ml to 0.91 in the incubation with 1000 larvae/ml. This experiment shows that T. spiralis muscle larvae affect significantly the red blood cell aggregation and the erythrocyte viscoelastic properties.
Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) is a complex and debilitating disease that often initially presents with flu-like symptoms, accompanied by incapacitating fatigue. Currently, there are no objective biomarkers or laboratory tests that can be used to unequivocally diagnosis ME; therefore, a diagnosis is made when a patient meets series of a costly and subjective inclusion and exclusion criteria. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the utility of four clinical parameters in diagnosing ME.
In the present study, we utilized logistic regression and classification and regression tree analysis to conduct a retrospective investigation of four clinical laboratory in 140 ME cases and 140 healthy controls.
Correlations between the covariates ranged between [- 0.26, 0.61]. The best model included the serum levels of the soluble form of CD14 (sCD14), serum levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and serum levels of interleukin 8, with coefficients 0.002, 0.249, and 0.005, respectively, and p-values of 3 × 10-7, 1 × 10-5, and 3 × 10-3, respectively.
Our findings show that these parameters may help physicians in their diagnosis of ME and may additionally shed light on the pathophysiology of this disease.
The cerebellum is known to support motor behaviors, including postural stability, but new research supports the view that cerebellar function is also critical for perception of spatial orientation, particularly because of its role in vestibular processing.
Traditionally, cancer is viewed as a disease driven by genetic mutations and/or epigenetic and transcriptional dysregulation. While these are undoubtedly important drivers, many recent studies highlight the disconnect between the proteome and the genome or transcriptome. At least in part, this disconnect arises as a result of dysregulated RNA metabolism which underpins the altered proteomic landscape observed. Thus, it is important to understand the basic mechanisms governing post-transcriptional control and how these processes can be co-opted to drive cancer cell phenotypes. In some cases, groups of mRNAs that encode protein involved in specific oncogenic processes can be co-regulated at multiple processing levels in order to turn on entire biochemical pathways. Indeed, the RNA regulon model was postulated as a means to understand how cells coordinately regulate transcripts encoding proteins in the same biochemical pathways. In this review, we describe some of the basic mRNA processes that are dysregulated in cancer and the biological impact this has on the cell. This dysregulation can affect networks of RNAs simultaneously thereby underpinning the oncogenic phenotypes observed.
More than half of adult tobacco users in the United States (U.S.) transitioned in tobacco product use between 2013⁻2014 and 2014⁻2015. We examine how characteristics of adult tobacco users in the U.S. relate to transitions in tobacco product use. Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study data were analyzed from 12,862 adult current tobacco users who participated in Wave 1 (W1, 2013⁻2014) and Wave 2 (W2, 2014⁻2015). Three types of transitions were examined-(1) adding tobacco product(s); (2) switching to non-cigarette tobacco product(s); and (3) discontinuing all tobacco use-among those currently using: (1) any tobacco product; (2) cigarettes only (i.e., exclusive cigarette); and (3) cigarettes plus another tobacco product(s) (i.e., poly-cigarette). Multinomial logistic regression analyses determined relative risk of type of transition versus no transition as a function of demographic and tobacco use characteristics. Transitions in tobacco product use among adult tobacco users were common overall, but varied among different demographic groups, including by age, sex, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, and poverty level. Further, cigarette smokers with higher dependence scores were more likely to add product(s) and less likely to discontinue tobacco use compared to those with low dependence scores. That high nicotine dependence is a barrier to discontinuing tobacco use adds evidence to support policy to lower nicotine content of cigarettes and to evaluate new products for their potential to reduce cigarette use.
Charles Darwin's Pangenesis theory, which proposed an intercellular mechanism for the flow of hereditary information, is gaining new ground.
In 2013⁻2014, nearly 28% of adults in the United States (U.S.) were current tobacco users with cigarettes the most common product used and with nearly 40% of tobacco users using two or more tobacco products. We describe overall change in prevalence of tobacco product use and within-person transitions in tobacco product use in the U.S. between 2013⁻2014 and 2014⁻2015 for young adults (18⁻24 years) and older adults (25+ years). Data from Wave 1 (W1, 2013⁻2014) and Wave 2 (W2, 2014⁻2015) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study were analyzed (N = 34,235). Tobacco product types were categorized into: (1) combustible (cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, hookah), (2) noncombustible (smokeless tobacco, snus pouches, dissolvable tobacco), and (3) electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS). Transitions for individual combustible-product types, and for single- and multiple-product use, were also considered. Overall prevalence of current tobacco use decreased from 27.6% to 26.3%. Among W1 non-tobacco users, 88.7% of young adults and 95.8% of older adults were non-tobacco users at W2. Among W1 tobacco users, 71.7% of young adults transitioned, with 20.7% discontinuing use completely, and 45.9% of older adults transitioned, with 12.5% discontinuing use completely. Continuing with/transitioning toward combustible product(s), particularly cigarettes, was more common than continuing with/transitioning toward ENDS. Tobacco use behaviors were less stable among young adults than older adults, likely reflecting greater product experimentation among young adults. Relative stability of cigarette use compared to other tobacco products (except older adult noncombustible use) demonstrates high abuse liability for cigarettes.
Adipose tissue is a target of Trypanosoma cruzi infection being a parasite reservoir during the chronic phase in mice and humans. Previously, we reported that acute Trypanosoma cruzi infection in mice is linked to a severe adipose tissue loss, probably triggered by inflammation, as well as by the parasite itself. Here, we evaluated how infection affects adipose tissue homeostasis, considering adipocyte anabolic and catabolic pathways, the immune-endocrine pattern and the possible repercussion upon adipogenesis. During in vivo infection, both lipolytic and lipogenic pathways are profoundly affected, since the expression of lipolytic enzymes and lipogenic enzymes was intensely downregulated. A similar pattern was observed in isolated adipocytes from infected animals and in 3T3-L1 adipocytes infected in vitro with Trypanosoma cruzi. Moreover, 3T3-L1 adipocytes exposed to plasmas derived from infected animals also tend to downregulate lipolytic enzyme expression which was less evident regarding lipogenic enzymes. Moreover, in vivo-infected adipose tissue reveals a pro-inflammatory profile, with increased leucocyte infiltration accompanied by TNF and IL-6 overexpression, and adiponectin downregulation. Strikingly, the nuclear factor PPAR-γ is strongly decreased in adipocytes during in vivo infection. Attempts to favor PPAR-γ-mediated actions in the adipose tissue of infected animals using agonists failed, indicating that inflammation or parasite-derived factors are strongly involved in PPAR-γ inhibition. Here, we report that experimental acute Trypanosoma cruzi infection disrupts both adipocyte catabolic and anabolic metabolism secondary to PPAR-γ robust downregulation, tipping the balance towards to an adverse status compatible with the adipose tissue atrophy and the acquisition of an inflammatory phenotype.
Shapes of edible plant organs vary dramatically among and within crop plants. To explain and ultimately employ this variation towards crop improvement, we determined the genetic, molecular and cellular bases of fruit shape diversity in tomato. Through positional cloning, protein interaction studies, and genome editing, we report that OVATE Family Proteins and TONNEAU1 Recruiting Motif proteins regulate cell division patterns in ovary development to alter final fruit shape. The physical interactions between the members of these two families are necessary for dynamic relocalization of the protein complexes to different cellular compartments when expressed in tobacco leaf cells. Together with data from other domesticated crops and model plant species, the protein interaction studies provide possible mechanistic insights into the regulation of morphological variation in plants and a framework that may apply to organ growth in all plant species.
Metabolomics has become a powerful tool in chemical biology. Profiling the human sterolome has resulted in the discovery of noncanonical sterols, including oxysterols and meiosis-activating sterols. They are important to immune responses and development, and have been reviewed extensively. The triterpenoid metabolite fusidic acid has developed clinical relevance, and many steroidal metabolites from microbial sources possess varying bioactivities. Beyond the prospect of pharmacognostical agents, the profiling of minor metabolites can provide insight into an organism's biosynthesis and phylogeny, as well as inform drug discovery about infectious diseases. This review aims to highlight recent discoveries from detailed sterolomic profiling in microorganisms and their phylogenic and pharmacological implications.
Associations with minerals can potentially augment soil organic carbon (SOC) stability by reducing the bioavailability and degradation of SOC. However, few studies have directly measured aerobic respiration of mineral-bound SOC. In this study, we investigated the microbial aerobic respiration and bioavailability of ferrihydrite-sorbed glucose (Fh-GLU) and ferrihydrite-sorbed formic acid (Fh-FA) by adding 13C-labeled compounds to a soil. During an 11-day incubation, 30.2% of free, non-Fh-sorbed glucose (GLU) and 61.8% of free formic acid (FA) were respired, whereas 4.2% and 27.9% of Fh-GLU and Fh-FA were respired, respectively. Our results demonstrated that Fh-bound GLU/FA had lower bioavailability compared to free organic compounds. Associations with Fh led to greater inhibition in the bioavailability of GLU than that for FA. The priming effects of added compounds on the respiration of native SOC were decreased by their association with Fh. Our results demonstrated that the bioavailability and priming effect of organic compounds depend on their interactions with minerals.
For decades the development of evidence-based therapy has been based on experimental tests of protocols designed to impact psychiatric syndromes. As this paradigm weakens, a more process-based therapy approach is rising in its place, focused on how to best target and change core biopsychosocial processes in specific situations for given goals with given clients. This is an inherently more idiographic question than has normally been at issue in evidence-based therapy over the last few decades. In this article we explore methods of assessment and analysis that can integrate idiographic and nomothetic approaches in a process-based era.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a main hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. It represents a wide spectrum of histopathological abnormalities ranging from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with or without fibrosis and, eventually, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. While hepatic simple steatosis seems to be a rather benign manifestation of hepatic triglyceride accumulation, the buildup of highly toxic free fatty acids associated with insulin resistance-induced massive free fatty acid mobilization from adipose tissue and the increased de novo hepatic fatty acid synthesis from glucose acts as the "first hit" for NAFLD development. NAFLD progression seems to involve the occurrence of "parallel, multiple-hit" injuries, such as oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum stress, endotoxin-induced, TLR4-dependent release of inflammatory cytokines, and iron overload, among many others. These deleterious factors are responsible for the triggering of a number of signaling cascades leading to inflammation, cell death, and fibrosis, the hallmarks of NASH. This review is aimed at integrating the overwhelming progress made in the characterization of the physiopathological mechanisms of NAFLD at a molecular level, to better understand the factor influencing the initiation and progression of the disease.
In this work we introduce a novel set-based fault tolerant control scheme for linear systems under Gaussian disturbances. In the proposed strategy, actuator faults are detected and diagnosed when residual trajectories enter and remain in certain sets that are computed as probabilistic ultimate bounds. After a fault is diagnosed, the control scheme is reconfigured to take into account the corresponding actuator failure and preserve certain closed loop features. We show that our strategy can detect and diagnose the different faults considered with an arbitrarily small probability of misdetection.
The present study aims to identify the patients at risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). There is a body of literature that uses machine learning classification algorithms to predict development of T2D among patients. The current study compares the performance of these classification algorithms to identify patients who are at risk of developing T2D in short, medium and long terms. In addition, the list of predictor variables important for prediction for T2D progression is provided.
This study uses 10,911 records generated in 36 clinics from the 15th of November 2008-15th of November 2016. Syntactic minority oversampling and random under sampling were used to create a balanced dataset. The performance of Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Decision Tress and Logistic Regression to identify patients developing T2D in short, medium and long terms was compared. The measures were Area Under Curve, Sensitivity, Specificity, Matthew correlation coefficient and Mean Calibration Error. Through importance analysis and information fusion techniques the predictors of developing T2D were identified for short, medium and long-term risk analysis.
The findings show that the performance of analytics techniques depends on both period and purpose of prediction whether the prediction is to identify people who will not develop T2D or to determine at risk patients. Oversampling as opposed to under sampling improved performance. 16 predictors and their importance to determine patients at risk of T2D in short, medium and long terms were identified.
This study provides guidelines for an automated system to prompt patients for screening. Several predictors are reportable by patients, others can be examined by physicians or ordered for further lab examination, which offers a potential reduction of the burden placed upon the clinical settings.
Navigating growth cones are exposed to multiple signals simultaneously and have to integrate competing cues into a coherent navigational response. Integration of guidance cues is traditionally thought to occur at the level of cytoskeletal dynamics. Drosophila studies indicate that cells exhibit a low level of continuous caspase protease activation, and that axon guidance cues can activate or suppress caspase activity. We base a model for axon guidance on these observations. By analogy with other systems in which caspase signaling has non-apoptotic functions, we propose that caspase signaling can either reinforce repulsion or negate attraction in response to external guidance cues by cleaving cytoskeletal proteins. Over the course of an entire trajectory, incorrectly navigating axons may pass the threshold for apoptosis and be eliminated, whereas axons making correct decisions will survive. These observations would also explain why neurotrophic factors can act as axon guidance cues and why axon guidance systems such as Slit/Robo signaling may act as tumor suppressors in cancer.
In flowering plants, pollen tubes undergo tip growth to deliver two nonmotile sperm to the ovule where they fuse with an egg and central cell to achieve double fertilization. This extended journey involves rapid growth and changes in gene activity that manage compatible interactions with at least seven different cell types. Nearly half of the genome is expressed in haploid pollen, which facilitates genetic analysis, even of essential genes. These unique attributes make pollen an ideal system with which to study plant cell-cell interactions, tip growth, cell migration, the modulation of cell wall integrity, and gene expression networks. We highlight the signaling systems required for pollen tube navigation and the potential roles of Ca2+ signals. The dynamics of pollen development make sexual reproduction highly sensitive to heat stress. Understanding this vulnerability may generate strategies to improve seed crop yields that are under threat from climate change.
Single-case experimental design (SCED) research plays an important role in establishing and confirming evidence-based practices. Due to multiple measures of a target behavior in such studies, missing information is common in their data. The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm has been successfully applied to deal with missing data in between-subjects designs, but only in a handful of SCED studies. The present study extends the findings from Smith, Borckardt, and Nash (2012) and Velicer and Colby (2005b, Study 2) by systematically examining the performance of EM in a baseline-intervention (or AB) design under various missing rates, autocorrelations, intervention phase lengths, and magnitudes of effects, as well as two fitted models. Three indicators of an intervention effect (baseline slope, level shift, and slope change) were estimated. The estimates' relative bias, root-mean squared error, and relative bias of the estimated standard error were used to assess EM's performance. The findings revealed that autocorrelation impacted the estimates' qualities most profoundly. Autocorrelation interacted with missing rate in impacting the relative bias of the estimates, impacted the root-mean squared error nonlinearly, and interacted with the fitted model in impacting the relative bias of the estimated standard errors. A simpler model without autocorrelation can be used to estimate baseline slope and slope change in time-series data. EM is recommended as a principled method to handle missing data in SCED studies. Two decision trees are presented to assist researchers and practitioners in applying EM. Emerging research directions are identified for treating missing data in SCED studies.
Augmenting incentives for juveniles with separate incentives for parents could boost juvenile efforts to reduce BMI. However, financing a parent incentive by reducing the incentives offered to adolescents could attenuate the juvenile response. In a field experiment, Medicaid-covered juveniles enrolled in a cardiac wellness program were randomly assigned to two groups: juveniles in the focused-incentive group received all earned points; juveniles in the split-incentive group split earned points with a parent. The focused-incentive group was 12.8 percentage points more likely to achieve their stipulated goals compared to the split-incentive group at the end of the 3-month active phase of the program. In contrast, members of the split-incentive group outperformed their peers in the focused-incentive group during the second quarter, and the two incentives structures were equally effective at the year-end session. Additional quasi-experimental data indicates that members of both incentivized groups significantly outperformed (focused-incentive group by 8.48 percentage points and split-incentive group by 11.0 percentage points) a pre-experiment (non-incentivized) set of juveniles enrolled in the same program at year-end.

Prostate diseases include prostate cancer, which is the second most common male neoplasia, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which affects approximately 50% of men. The incidence of prostate disease is increasing, and some of this increase may be attributable to ancestral exposure to environmental toxicants and epigenetic transgenerational inheritance mechanisms. The goal of the current study was to determine the effects that exposure of gestating female rats to vinclozolin has on the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of prostate disease, and to characterize by what molecular epigenetic mechanisms this has occurred. Gestating female rats (F0 generation) were exposed to vinclozolin during E8-E14 of gestation. F1 generation offspring were bred to produce the F2 generation, which were bred to produce the transgenerational F3 generation. The transgenerational F3 generation vinclozolin lineage males at 12 months of age had an increased incidence of prostate histopathology and abnormalities compared to the control lineage. Ventral prostate epithelial and stromal cells were isolated from F3 generation 20-day old rats, prior to the onset of pathology, and used to obtain DNA and RNA for analysis. Results indicate that there were transgenerational changes in gene expression, noncoding RNA expression, and DNA methylation in both cell types. Our results suggest that ancestral exposure to vinclozolin at a critical period of gestation induces the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of prostate stromal and epithelial cell changes in both the epigenome and transcriptome that ultimately lead to prostate disease susceptibility and may serve as a source of the increased incidence of prostate pathology observed in recent years.
Ultimately, we aim to generalize and translate scientific knowledge to the real world, yet current understanding of human visual perception is based predominantly on studies of two-dimensional (2-D) images. Recent cognitive-behavioral evidence shows that real objects are processed differently to images, although the neural processes that underlie these differences are unknown. Because real objects (unlike images) afford actions, they may trigger stronger or more prolonged activation in neural populations for visuo-motor action planning. Here, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) when human observers viewed real-world three-dimensional (3-D) objects or closely matched 2-D images of the same items. Although responses to real objects and images were similar overall, there were critical differences. Compared to images, viewing real objects triggered stronger and more sustained event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the μ frequency band (8-13 Hz) - a neural signature of automatic motor preparation. Event-related potentials (ERPs) revealed a transient, early occipital negativity for real objects (versus images), likely reflecting 3-D stereoscopic differences, and a late sustained parietal amplitude modulation consistent with an 'old-new' memory advantage for real objects over images. Together, these findings demonstrate that real-world objects trigger stronger and more sustained action-related brain responses than images do. The results highlight important similarities and differences between brain responses to images and richer, more ecologically relevant, real-world objects.
The endocrine disrupting chemicals bisphenol A (BPA) and 4-nonylphenol (NP) were simultaneously quantified through third-order/four-way calibration. Excitation-emission fluorescence matrix-kinetic (EEFM-K) third-order data were generated by measuring the EEFMs of these priority xenoestrogens as a function of reaction time during their Fenton degradation. Third-order/four-way calibration notably improves the sensitivity of the method and provides the required selectivity for quantifying analytes with critically overlapped fluorescence signals. In fact, collinearity between BPA and NP emission spectra prevented their quantification using EEFM second-order data and three-way PARAFAC (parallel factor analysis); however, the addition of a third instrumental mode allowed the correct chemometric modeling with four-way PARAFAC. In this way, the compliance of Kruskal's theorem extended to higher-order data was verified. The method was applied for the determination of the analytes in samples of different plastic materials, which are in contact with food and/or beverages. In these cases, where unmodelled constituents are present, good results for BPA were achieved with four-way PARAFAC, but the predictions for NP using this model were deficient. A better predictive capability for NP in real samples was achieved when either U-PLS/RTL (unfolded partial least-squares combined with residual trilinearization) or MCR-ALS (multivariate curve resolution with alternating least-squares) was applied for data processing, demonstrating the power of these latter models for the resolution of more complex systems.
The wireless sensor network (WSN) is mainly composed of a large number of sensor nodes that are equipped with limited energy and resources. Therefore, energy consumption in wireless sensor networks is one of the most challenging problems in practice. On the other hand, data fusion can effectively decrease data redundancy, reduce the amount of data transmission and energy consumption in the network, extend the network life cycle, improve the utilization of bandwidth, and thus overcome the bottleneck on energy and bandwidth consumption. This paper proposes a new data fusion algorithm based on Hesitant Fuzzy Entropy (DFHFE). The new algorithm aims to reduce the collection of repeated data on sensor nodes from the source, and strives to utilize the information provided by redundant data to improve the data reliability. Hesitant fuzzy entropy is exploited to fuse the original data from sensor nodes in the cluster at the sink node to obtain higher quality data and make local decisions on the events of interest. The sink nodes periodically send local decisions to the base station that aggregates the local decisions and makes the final judgment, in which process the burden for the base station to process all the data is significantly released. According to our experiments, the proposed data fusion algorithm greatly improves the robustness, accuracy, and real-time performance of the entire network. The simulation results demonstrate that the new algorithm is more efficient than the state-of-the-art in terms of both energy consumption and real-time performance.
Sexual reproduction in flowering plants depends on the fitness of the male gametophyte during fertilization. Because pollen development is highly sensitive to hot and cold temperature extremes, reliable methods to evaluate pollen viability are important for research into improving reproductive heat stress (HS) tolerance. Here, we describe an approach to rapidly evaluate pollen viability using a reactive oxygen species (ROS) probe dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (i.e. H2 DCFDA-staining) coupled with flow cytometry. In using flow cytometry to analyze mature pollen harvested from Arabidopsis and tomato flowers, we discovered that pollen distributed bimodally into 'low-ROS' and 'high-ROS' subpopulations. Pollen germination assays following fluorescence-activated cell sorting revealed that the high-ROS pollen germinated with a frequency that was 35-fold higher than the low-ROS pollen, supporting a model in which a significant fraction of a flower's pollen remains in a low metabolic or dormant state even after hydration. The ability to use flow cytometry to quantify ROS dynamics within a large pollen population was shown by dose-dependent alterations in DCF-fluorescence in response to oxidative stress or antioxidant treatments. HS treatments (35°C) increased ROS levels, which correlated with a ~60% reduction in pollen germination. These results demonstrate the potential of using flow cytometry-based approaches to investigate metabolic changes during stress responses in pollen.
Sucrose non-fermenting 1 (SNF1)-related protein kinase 1.1 (SnRK1.1; also known as KIN10 or SnRK1α) has been identified as the catalytic subunit of the complex SnRK1, the Arabidopsis thaliana homologue of a central integrator of energy and stress signalling in eukaryotes dubbed AMPK/Snf1/SnRK1. A nuclear localization of SnRK1.1 has been previously described and is in line with its function as an integrator of energy and stress signals. Here, using two biological models (Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis thaliana), native regulatory sequences, different microscopy techniques, and manipulations of cellular energy status, it was found that SnRK1.1 is localized dynamically between the nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This distribution was confirmed at a spatial and temporal level by co-localization studies with two different fluorescent ER markers, one of them being the SnRK1.1 phosphorylation target HMGR. The ER and nuclear localization displayed a dynamic behaviour in response to perturbations of the plastidic electron transport chain. These results suggest that an ER-associated SnRK1.1 fraction might be sensing the cellular energy status, being a point of crosstalk with other ER stress regulatory pathways.
Cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP) is a second messenger involved in diverse metabolic processes, including osmolyte uptake, cell wall homeostasis, and antibiotic and heat resistance. In Lactococcus lactis, a lactic acid bacterium which is used in the dairy industry and as a cell factory in biotechnological processes, the only reported interaction partners of c-di-AMP are the pyruvate carboxylase and BusR, the transcription regulator of the busAB operon for glycine betaine uptake. However, recent studies uncovered a major role of c-di-AMP in the control of potassium homeostasis, and potassium is the signal that triggers c-di-AMP synthesis. In this study, we have identified KupA and KupB, which belong to the Kup/HAK/KT family, as novel c-di-AMP binding proteins. Both proteins are high-affinity potassium transporters, and their transport activities are inhibited by binding of c-di-AMP. Thus, in addition to the well-studied Ktr/Trk potassium channels, KupA and KupB represent a second class of potassium transporters that are subject to inhibition by c-di-AMP.IMPORTANCE Potassium is an essential ion in every living cell. Even though potassium is the most abundant cation in cells, its accumulation can be toxic. Therefore, the level of potassium has to be tightly controlled. In many Gram-positive bacteria, the second messenger cyclic di-AMP plays a key role in the control of potassium homeostasis by binding to potassium transporters and regulatory proteins and RNA molecules. In the lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis, none of these conserved c-di-AMP-responsive molecules are present. In this study, we demonstrate that the KupA and KupB proteins of L. lactis IL1403 are high-affinity potassium transporters and that their transport activity is inhibited by the second messenger c-di-AMP.
Understanding how differences in cognition evolve is one of the critical goals in cognitive ecology [1-5]. In food-caching species that rely on memory to recover caches, enhanced spatial cognition has been hypothesized to evolve via natural selection [2, 6-8], but there has been no direct evidence of natural selection acting on spatial memory. Food-caching mountain chickadees living at harsher, higher elevations, with greater reliance on cached food have better spatial learning abilities and larger hippocampi containing more and larger neurons compared to birds from milder, lower elevations [9, 10]. Here, we tested for natural selection on spatial cognition in wild food-caching mountain chickadees at high elevations and documented the following: (1) compared to first-year juveniles, adults showed significantly better performance on two spatial cognitive tasks-spatial learning and memory and a consecutive reversal learning task; (2) cognitive performance in both spatial learning and reversal learning tasks was not significantly different between years in the same chickadees tested in their first year of life and after surviving to their second winter; and (3) cognitive performance in the spatial learning task was significantly better among the first-year juveniles that survived to their second winter compared to the subset of juveniles that did not survive. Taken together, our results provide evidence for natural selection on spatial cognition in a food-caching species living in harsh environments and suggest that natural selection associated with local environmental conditions might be generating intraspecific differences in cognitive abilities. VIDEO ABSTRACT.
To address the mechanism of thermosensing and its implications for molecular engineering, we previously deconstructed the functional components of the bacterial thermosensor DesK, a histidine kinase with a five-span transmembrane domain that detects temperature changes. The system was first simplified by building a sensor that consists of a single chimerical transmembrane segment that retained full sensing capacity. Genetic and biophysical analysis of this minimal sensor enabled the identification of three modular components named determinants of thermodetection (DOTs). Here we combine and tune the DOTs to determine their contribution to activity. A transmembrane zipper represents the master DOT that drives a reversible and activating dimerization through the formation of hydrogen bonds. Our findings provide the mechanism and insights to construct a synthetic transmembrane helix based on a poly-valine scaffold that harbors the DOTs and regulates the activity. The construct constitutes a modular switch that may be exploited in biotechnology and genetic circuitry.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease. Triacylglycerol accumulation in the liver is a hallmark of NAFLD. Metabolic studies have confirmed that increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) in humans contributes to fat accumulation in the liver and to NAFLD progression. Mice deficient in carboxylesterase (Ces)1d expression are protected from high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis. To investigate whether loss of Ces1d can also mitigate steatosis induced by over-activated DNL, WT and Ces1d-deficient mice were fed a lipogenic high-sucrose diet (HSD). We found that Ces1d-deficient mice were protected from HSD-induced hepatic lipid accumulation. Mechanistically, Ces1d deficiency leads to activation of AMP-activated protein kinase and inhibitory phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Together with our previous demonstration that Ces1d deficiency attenuated high-fat diet-induced steatosis, this study suggests that inhibition of CES1 (the human ortholog of Ces1d) might represent a novel pharmacological target for prevention and treatment of NAFLD.
Benznidazole (BNZ) is the drug of choice for the treatment of Chagas disease in many countries. However, its low water solubility produces low and/or variable oral bioavailability. Thus, the aim of this work was to formulate micro- and nanoparticles based on Eudragit® RS PO and Eudragit® RL PO as a convenient approach to increase the dissolution rate of BNZ. The microparticles were obtained by means of spray-drying process while the nanoparticles were prepared through the nanoprecipitation technique and further freeze-drying. The results indicated that nanoparticles were obtained in 86% yield while microparticles were obtained in 68% yield. In both cases, the encapsulation efficiency of particles was greater than 78% while drug loading capacity was nearly 24% w/w and 18% w/w, after spray-drying and freeze-drying procedures, respectively. Images of scanning electron microscopy showed that the particles obtained by spray-drying and freeze-drying were in the micrometer and nanometer scale, respectively. FT-IR spectra of BNZ-loaded particles obtained by both methods showed characteristic bands of BNZ confirming that part of drug remained on their surface. Thermal analysis revealed that the drug crystallinity after both methods decreased. Physical stability evaluation of the nanoparticles confirmed that Pluronic® F68 was suitable to keep the particles size in a range of 300 nm after 70 days storage at 4 ± 2 °C. In-vitro release studies showed increased dissolution rate of drug from the particles obtained by both methods respect to untreated BNZ. The kinetics of drug release in acid media followed the Higuchi kinetics indicating drug diffusion mechanism from particles.
Gem-Pro is a new tool for gene mining and functional profiling of bacteria. It initially identifies homologous genes using BLAST and then applies three filtering steps to select orthologous gene pairs. The first one uses BLAST score values to identify trivial paralogs. The second filter uses the shared identity percentages of found trivial paralogs as internal witnesses of non-orthology to set orthology cutoff values. The third filtering step uses conditional probabilities of orthology and non-orthology to define new cutoffs and generate supportive information of orthology assignations. Additionally, a subsidiary tool, called q-GeM, was also developed to mine traits of interest using logistic regression (LR) or linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifiers. q-GeM is more efficient in the use of computing resources than Gem-Pro but needs an initial classified set of homologous genes in order to train LR and LDA classifiers. Hence, q-GeM could be used to analyze new set of strains with available genome sequences, without the need to rerun a complete Gem-Pro analysis. Finally, Gem-Pro and q-GeM perform a synteny analysis to evaluate the integrity and genomic arrangement of specific pathways of interest to infer their presence. The tools were applied to more than 2 million homologous pairs encoded by Bacillus strains generating statistical supported predictions of trait contents. The different patterns of encoded traits of interest were successfully used to perform a descriptive bacterial profiling.
Phospholipids play a central role in all living organisms. Phospholipases, the enzymes aimed at modifying phospholipids, are consequently widespread in nature and play diverse roles, from lipid metabolism and cellular signaling in eukaryotes to virulence and nutrient acquisition in microbes. Phospholipases catalyze the hydrolysis of one or more ester or phosphodiester bonds of glycerophospholipids. The use of phospholipases with industrial purposes has constantly increased over the last 30 years. This demand is rapidly growing given the ongoing improvements in protein engineering and the reduction of enzymes manufacturing costs, making them suitable for industrial use. Here, a general overview of phopholipases A, B, C, and D and their industrial application is presented along with potential new uses for these enzymes. We draw attention to commercial phospholipases used to improve the emulsifying properties of products in the baking, egg, and dairy industries. On the other hand, the improvement of oil degumming by phospholipases is thoroughly analyzed. Moreover, recent developments in enzymatic biodiesel production and the use of phospholipases for the synthesis of phospholipids with pharmaceutical or nutritional value are reviewed.
Phenolic compounds are highly valuable products that remain trapped in grape pomace, an abundant winery by-product. Therefore, efficient extraction procedures of these compounds represent a route for grape pomace valorisation. Here we performed a screening of the factors affecting the aqueous enzymatic extraction of phenolic compounds from Syrah grape pomace, including the following independent variables: temperature, pH, pectinase, cellulase and tannase; and a subsequent optimization through response surface methodology. At the optimal region, the enzymatic treatment enhanced the extraction yield of phenolics by up to 66% and its antioxidant capacity by up to 80%, reducing the incubation time and enzyme doses in respect to previous studies. We found that tannase raises the antioxidant capacity of the extract by the liberation of gallic acid, while cellulose favours the liberation of p-coumaric acid and malvidin-3-O-glucoside. We also tested the procedure in different grape pomace varieties, verifying its wide applicability.
Amaranth, quinoa and chia are non-conventional sources of proteins whose interest has increased in recent years due to their excellent nutritional value. Vegetable proteins can be used as food ingredients to replace animal proteins in human diet. The present article provides a comprehensive analysis of amaranth, quinoa and chia proteins and focuses on their solubility, superficial, gelling and textural properties as well as on the biological activities of enzymatic hydrolyzates.
Quorum sensing (QS) controls the pathogenic behavior of Streptococcus mutans, a primary cause of dental caries. S. mutans uses the competence stimulating peptide (CSP) to control mutacin production, a bacteriocin utilized by S. mutans to outcompete different commensal bacteria in mixed biofilm environments. In this study, we performed an N-methyl scan of an 18-CSP-based scaffold lacking the first two amino acid residues that were shown to be dispensable, to gain important mechanistic insight as to the role of backbone amide protons in the interaction between CSP and the ComD receptor. We then utilized the reverse alanine approach to develop CSP-based analogs with enhanced activities. The two most potent analogs were found to induce bacteriocin production at sub-nanomolar concentration using an interspecies inhibition assay. Overall, our analysis revealed that the 18-CSP sequence is not optimized and can be improved by replacement of multiple positions with alanine. Our results further suggest that the hydrophobic residues in S. mutans 18-CSP are involved in both receptor binding and activation.
This article reports the design, construction, and first use of an experimental device consisting of a specially designed vacuum chamber equipped with a reactive sputtering magnetron (RSM) to be used for controlled deposition of thin films on a Si(100) flat substrate. The setup was designed to allow for in situ and real-time recordings of X-ray diffraction patterns during the growth of the deposited films and was installed in the X-ray diffraction and spectroscopy beamline emerging from a superconducting wiggler source at the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory. The first use of the RSM setup was an in situ and real-time X-ray diffraction study of processes of growth of multilayered aluminum nitride thin films, whereas the operation parameters of the reactor were sequentially changed. This sequential process led to the development of multilayered films. Alternate variations in chamber pressure and magnetron power density allowed us to obtain thin films composed of several micrometer thick layers, with alternate amorphous and (10·0), (00·2), or (10·1) textured polycrystalline structures.
The facial nerve is necessary for our ability to eat, speak, and make facial expressions. Both the axons and cell bodies of the facial nerve undergo a complex embryonic developmental pattern involving migration of the cell bodies caudally and tangentially through rhombomeres, and simultaneously the axons projecting to exit the hindbrain to form the facial nerve. Our goal in this study was to test the functions of the chemorepulsive receptors Robo1 and Robo2 in facial neuron migration and axon projection by analyzing genetically marked motor neurons in double-mutant mouse embryos through the migration time course, E10.0-E13.5. In Robo1/2 double mutants, axon projection and cell body migration errors were more severe than in single mutants. Most axons did not make it to their motor exit point, and instead projected into and longitudinally within the floor plate. Surprisingly, some facial neurons had multiple axons exiting and projecting into the floor plate. At the same time, a subset of mutant facial cell bodies failed to migrate caudally, and instead either streamed dorsally toward the exit point or shifted into the floor plate. We conclude that Robo1 and Robo2 have redundant functions to guide multiple aspects of the complex cell migration of the facial nucleus, as well as regulating axon trajectories and suppressing formation of ectopic axons.
The expression of elements of the cholinergic system has been demonstrated in non-neuronal cells, such as immune cells, where acetylcholine modulates innate and adaptive responses. However, the study of the non-neuronal cholinergic system has focused on lymphocyte cholinergic mechanisms, with less attention to its role of innate cells. Considering this background, the aims of this review are 1) to review information regarding the cholinergic components of innate immune system cells; 2) to discuss the effect of cholinergic stimuli on cell functions; 3) and to describe the importance of cholinergic stimuli on host immunocompetence, in order to set the base for the design of intervention strategies in the biomedical field.
Sperm cryopreservation facilitates the storage and transport of germplasm for its use in artificial insemination (AI) and other advanced reproductive technologies. The cryopreservation process can damage sperm and compromise functionality. Several cryobiological studies have found that the physical and biological factors that affect sperm survival at low temperatures during the cryopreservation process often involve the integrity of sperm membrane. In this review, the behaviour of the sperm membrane against cooling, cold shock, ice crystal formation, oxidative stress, osmotic changes, reorganization of the lipid bilayer and addition of cryoprotective agents (CPA) is discussed. In addition, the phenomenon of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and its relationship with the cryopreservation process is also described. Semen cryopreservation techniques have progressed slowly in past years, and the current performance, measured as post-thawed survival, is not very different compared to past decades. Recent advances in understanding the structure of the cell membrane, its function and metabolism have driven to new conservation systems, including lyophilization and vitrification. However, none of these technologies is commercially available, although its future appears very promising.
Plants exposed to hostile environmental conditions such as drought or extreme temperatures usually undergo oxidative stress, which has long been assumed to significantly contribute to the damage suffered by the organism. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduced under stress conditions were proposed to destroy membrane lipids and to inactivate proteins and photosystems, ultimately leading to cell death. Accordingly, considerable effort has been devoted, over the years, to improve stress tolerance by strengthening antioxidant and dissipative mechanisms. Although the notion that ROS cause indiscriminate damage in vivo has been progressively replaced by the alternate concept that they act as signaling molecules directing critical plant developmental and environmental responses including cell death, the induction of genes encoding antioxidant activities is commonplace under many environmental stresses, suggesting that their manipulation still offers promise. The features and consequences of ROS effects depend on the balance between various interacting pathways including ROS synthesis and scavenging, energy dissipation, conjugative reactions, and eventually reductive repair. They represent many possibilities for genetic manipulation. We report, herein, a comprehensive survey of transgenic plants in which components of the ROS-associated pathways were overexpressed, and of the stress phenotypes displayed by the corresponding transformants. Genetic engineering of different stages of ROS metabolism such as synthesis, scavenging, and reductive repair revealed a strong correlation between down-regulation of ROS levels and increased stress tolerance in plants grown under controlled conditions. Field assays are scarce, and are eagerly required to assess the possible application of this strategy to agriculture.
The properties of supersonic, compressible plasma turbulence determine the behavior of many terrestrial and astrophysical systems. In the interstellar medium and molecular clouds, compressible turbulence plays a vital role in star formation and the evolution of our galaxy. Observations of the density and velocity power spectra in the Orion B and Perseus molecular clouds show large deviations from those predicted for incompressible turbulence. Hydrodynamic simulations attribute this to the high Mach number in the interstellar medium (ISM), although the exact details of this dependence are not well understood. Here we investigate experimentally the statistical behavior of boundary-free supersonic turbulence created by the collision of two laser-driven high-velocity turbulent plasma jets. The Mach number dependence of the slopes of the density and velocity power spectra agree with astrophysical observations, and supports the notion that the turbulence transitions from being Kolmogorov-like at low Mach number to being more Burgers-like at higher Mach numbers.
Antibody-based in situ proximity ligation assays (isPLA) have the potential to study protein phosphorylation and protein interactions with spatial resolution in intact tissues. However, the application of isPLA at the tissue level is limited by a lack of appropriate positive and negative controls and the difficulty in accounting for changes in tissue shape. Here we demonstrate a set of experimental and computational approaches using gastric fundus smooth muscles to improve the validity of quantitative isPLA. Appropriate positive and negative biological controls and PLA technical controls were selected to ensure experimental rigor. To account for changes in morphology between relaxed and contracted smooth muscles, target PLA spots were normalized to smooth muscle myosin light chain 20 PLA spots or the cellular cross-sectional areas. We describe the computational steps necessary to filter out false-positive improperly sized spots and set the thresholds for counting true positive PLA spots to quantify the PLA signals. We tested our approach by examining protein phosphorylation and protein interactions in smooth muscle myofilament Ca2+ sensitization pathways from resting and contracted gastric fundus smooth muscles. In conclusion, our tissue-level isPLA method enables unbiased quantitation of protein phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions in intact smooth muscle tissues, suggesting the potential for quantitative isPLA applications in other types of intact tissues.
Diverse disturbances in immune-endocrine circuitries are involved in the development and aggravation of several chronic metabolic diseases (CMDs), including obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. The chronic inflammatory syndrome observed in CMDs culminates in dysregulated immune responses with low microbial killing efficiency, by means low host innate immune response, and loss of ability to eliminate the pathogens, which results in a high prevalence of infectious diseases, including pneumonia, tuberculosis, and sepsis. Herein, we review evidence pointing out PPARγ as a putative player in immune-endocrine disturbances related to increased risk of infections in CMDs. Cumulated evidence indicates that PPARγ activation modulates host cells to control inflammation during CMDs because of PPARγ agonists have anti-inflammatory and pro-resolutive properties, increasing host ability to eliminate pathogen, modulating hormone production, and restoring glucose and lipid homeostasis. As such, we propose PPARγ as a putative therapeutic adjuvant for patients with CMDs to favor a better infection control.
Youth who experience alcohol-related problems are at increased risk for developing alcohol dependence. Identifying factors associated with adolescent alcohol-related problems is essential, but most studies have focused on risk factors or a limited number of protective factors, with little attention to sex differences. We assessed the prospective association between 17 assets and alcohol-related problems among male and female youth. A 4-year cohort study with 1, 111 youth living in randomly-selected census tracts in the Oklahoma City Metropolitan Area was conducted. Follow-up for the current study began at wave 2 (2004/2005; N = 1079). Seventeen assets at the individual-, family-, and community-levels were measured. Five questions documented alcohol-related problems in the past 12 months. Generalized linear mixed models evaluated the prospective influence of assets on alcohol-related problems, separately for males and females. Models controlled for age, race/ethnicity, family structure, and parental income. Overall, females had more assets than males, but the protective influence of assets on alcohol-related problems over time was stronger for males. Six assets uniquely protected males (responsible choices [AOR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.36-0.94], educational aspirations [AOR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.31-0.93], parental monitoring [AOR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.27-0.64], community involvement [AOR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.34-0.97], use of time for groups/sports [AOR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.42-0.97], and school connectedness [AOR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.34-0.77]), and 3 uniquely protected females (general self-confidence [AOR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.40-0.96], good health practices [AOR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.47-0.95], and relationship with mother [AOR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.36-0.80]). Strengthening youth assets across multiple domains may decrease alcohol-related problems for both males and females; however, gender-specific approaches to asset building are also warranted.
Phytolacca tetramera is an endemic plant from Argentina that is currently at serious risk because its environment is subjected to a high anthropic impact. A previous study has shown that berry extracts obtained from this plant display antifungal activity against multiple human-pathogenic fungi when tested with a non-standardized method. Further evidences of the antifungal properties of other parts of the plant and studies of mechanism of antifungal action of the antifungal chemically characterized extracts are required.
This study aimed to gain further evidence of the antifungal activity of P. tetramera berry, leaf and root extracts in order to find the most active extract to be developed as an Herbal Medicinal Antifungal Product. The medicinal usefulness of P. tetramera extracts as antifungal agents will serve as an important support to create concience and carry out actions tending to the preservation of this threatened species and its environment.
Chemical analysis of all P. tetramera extracts, including quantitation of selected markers, was performed through UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS and UPLC-ESI-MS techniques according to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The antifungal activity of the quantified extracts was tested with the standardized CLSI microbroth dilution method against Candida spp. Antifungal mechanisms of the most active extract were studied by examination of morphological changes by phase-contrast and fluorescence microscopies and both, cellular and enzymatic assays targeting either the fungal membrane or the cell wall.
The antifungal activity of twelve P. tetramera extracts was tested against Candida albicans and Candida glabrata. The dichloromethane extract from berries (PtDEb) showed the best activity. Phytolaccagenin (PhytG) and phytolaccoside B (PhytB) were selected as the main active markers for the antifungal P. tetramera extracts. The quantitation of these active markers in all extracts showed that PtDEb possessed the highest amount of PhytG and PhytB. Finally, studies on the mechanism of antifungal action showed that the most active PtDEb extract produces morphological changes compatible with a damage of the cell wall and/or the plasma membrane. Cellular and enzymatic assays showed that PtDEb would not damage the fungal cell wall by itself, but would alter the plasma membrane. In agreement, PtDEb was found to bind to ergosterol, the main sterol of the fungal plasma membrane.
Studies of the anti-Candida activity of P. tetramera extracts led to the selection of PtDEb as the most suitable extract, confirming the antifungal properties of the threatened species P. tetramera. The new data give a valuable reason for the definitive protection of this sp. and its natural environment thus allowing further studies for the future development of an Herbal Medicinal Antifungal Product.
The trans-activating response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is a transcriptional repressor and splicing factor. TDP-43 is normally mostly in the nucleus, although it shuttles to the cytoplasm. Mutations in TDP-43 are one cause of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In neurons of these patients, TDP-43 forms cytoplasmic aggregates. In addition, wild-type TDP-43 is also frequently found in neuronal cytoplasmic aggregates in patients with neurodegenerative diseases not caused by TDP-43 mutations. TDP-43 expressed in yeast causes toxicity and forms cytoplasmic aggregates. This disease model has been validated because genetic modifiers of TDP-43 toxicity in yeast have led to the discovery that their conserved genes in humans are amyotrophic lateral sclerosis genetic risk factors. While how TDP-43 is associated with toxicity is unknown, several studies find that TDP-43 alters mitochondrial function. We now report that TDP-43 is much more toxic when yeast are respiring than when grown on a carbon source where respiration is inhibited. However, respiration is not the unique target of TDP-43 toxicity because we found that TDP-43 retains some toxicity even in the absence of respiration. We found that H2O2 increases the toxicity of TDP-43, suggesting that the reactive oxygen species associated with respiration could likewise enhance the toxicity of TDP-43. In this case, the TDP-43 toxicity targets in the presence or absence of respiration could be identical, with the reactive oxygen species produced by respiration activating TDP-43 to become more toxic or making TDP-43 targets more vulnerable.
Despite its exceptionally low circulating concentration, apolipoprotein (apo) A-V is a potent modulator of plasma triacylglycerol levels. The secretion efficiency of nascent apoA-V was investigated in cultured cells transfected with mRNA. Following transfection of HepG2 cells with wild type apoA-V mRNA, apoA-V protein was detectable in cell lysates by 6 h. At 24 h post transfection, evidence of apoA-V secretion into media was obtained, although most apoA-V was recovered in the cell lysate fraction. By contrast, apoA-I was efficiently secreted into the culture medium. A positive correlation between culture medium fetal bovine serum content and the percentage of apoA-V recovered in conditioned media was observed. When transfected cells were cultured in serum-free media supplemented with increasing amounts of high density lipoprotein, a positive correlation with apoA-V secretion was observed. The data indicate that, following signal sequence cleavage, the bulk of nascent apoA-V remains cell associated. Transit of nascent apoA-V out of cultured cells is enhanced by the availability of extracellular lipid particle acceptors.
Neonicotinoids are widely-used pesticides implicated in the decline of bees, known to have sub-lethal effects on bees' foraging and colony performance. One proposed mechanism for these negative effects is impairment to bees' ability to learn floral associations. However, the effects of neonicotinoids on learning performance have largely been addressed using a single protocol, where immobilized bees learn an association based on a single sensory modality. We thus have an incomplete understanding of how these pesticides affect bee learning in more naturalistic foraging scenarios. We carried out the first free-foraging study into the effects of acute exposure of a neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) on bumblebees' (Bombus impatiens) ability to learn associations with visual stimuli. We uncovered dose-dependent detrimental effects on motivation to initiate foraging, amount of nectar collected, and initiation of subsequent foraging bouts. However, we did not find any impairment to bees' ability to learn visual associations. While not precluding the possibility that other forms of learning are impaired, our findings suggest that some of the major effects of acute neonicotinoid exposure on foraging performance may be due to motivational and/or sensory impairments. In light of these findings, we discuss more broadly how pesticide effects on pollinator cognition might be studied.
The shape of the human spectral sensitivity function depends on how it is measured. In the increment threshold (IT) technique, sensitivity is typically measured as the inverse of threshold for detection of increments of monochromatic light presented for relatively long durations on achromatic pedestals. Spectral sensitivity functions derived from IT techniques have long been used to reveal contribution from opponent color channels. Although IT functions have been studied extensively, little attention has been given to functions derived from decrement thresholds (DT), partly due to technical challenges of producing appropriate stimuli. Comparison of IT and DT spectral sensitivities may be of interest because there are known asymmetries in the visual system between on- and off-pathways and between increment and decrement responses within these pathways. Consequently, spectral sensitivity functions obtained using DT measures may reveal a different complement of contributing mechanisms than those that produce IT functions. We report here that IT and DT derived spectral sensitivities were essentially identical over much of the visible spectrum. However, decrement sensitivity was slightly greater than increment sensitivity in the shorter wavelengths at modest light levels. This difference was not present at higher light levels, implicating rod pathways as a possible source of the difference. In sum, it appears that under conditions shown to reveal strong contribution from opponent mechanisms, decrement functions are either 1) determined by a similar complement of spectrally opponent mechanisms as those that define increment spectral sensitivities or 2) that the present conditions are insensitive to underlying asymmetries.
Miniature membranes comprised of tetramyristoylcardiolipin (CL) and apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, termed nanodisks (ND), are stable, aqueous soluble, reconstituted high density lipoproteins. When CL ND, but not dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (PC) ND, were incubated with CaCl2, a concentration dependent increase in sample turbidity occurred, consistent with CL undergoing a bilayer to non-bilayer transition. To assess the cation specificity of this reaction, CL ND were incubated with various mono- and divalent cations. Whereas monovalent cations had no discernable effect, MgCl2 and SrCl2 induced a response similar to CaCl2. When ND were formulated using different weight ratios of CL and PC, those possessing 100% CL or 75% CL remained susceptible to CaCl2 induced sample turbidity development while ND possessing 50% CL displayed reduced susceptibility. ND comprised of 25% CL and 75% PC were unaffected by CaCl2 under these conditions. SDS PAGE analysis of insoluble material generated by incubation of CL ND with CaCl2 revealed that nearly all apoA-I was recovered in the insoluble fraction along with CL. One h after addition of EDTA to CaCl2-treated CL ND, sample clarity was restored. Collectively, the data are consistent with a model wherein Ca2+ forms a bidentate interaction with anionic phosphates in the polar head group of CL. As phosphate group repositioning occurs to maximize Ca2+ binding, CL acyl chains reposition, accentuating the conical shape of CL to an extent that is incompatible with the ND bilayer structure.
Waterfalls are inspiring landforms that set the pace of landscape evolution as a result of bedrock incision1-3. They communicate changes in sea level or tectonic uplift throughout landscapes2,4 or stall river incision, disconnecting landscapes from downstream perturbations3,5. Here we use a flume experiment with constant water discharge and sediment feed to show that waterfalls can form from a planar, homogeneous bedrock bed in the absence of external perturbations. In our experiment, instabilities between flow hydraulics, sediment transport and bedrock erosion lead to undulating bedforms, which grow to become waterfalls. We propose that it is plausible that the origin of some waterfalls in natural systems can be attributed to this intrinsic formation process and we suggest that investigations to distinguish self-formed from externally forced waterfalls may help to improve the reconstruction of Earth history from landscapes.
Spontaneous excitability and contractions of colonic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are normally suppressed by inputs from inhibitory motor neurons, a behavior known as tonic inhibition. The post-junctional cell(s) mediating tonic inhibition have not been elucidated. We investigated the post-junctional cells mediating tonic inhibition in the proximal colon and whether tonic inhibition results from suppression of the activity of Ano1 channels, which are expressed exclusively in interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC). We found that tetrodotoxin (TTX), an inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, L-NNA, and an inhibitor of soluble guanylyl cyclase, ODQ, greatly enhanced colonic contractions. Ano1 antagonists, benzbromarone and Ani9 inhibited the effects of TTX, L-NNA and ODQ. Ano1 channels are activated by Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in ICC, and blocking Ca2+ release with a SERCA inhibitor (thapsigargin) or a store-operated Ca2+ entry blocker (GSK 7975 A) reversed the effects of TTX, L-NNA and ODQ. Ca2+ imaging revealed that TTX, L-NNA and ODQ increased Ca2+ transient firing in colonic ICC. Our results suggest that tonic inhibition in the proximal colon occurs through suppression of Ca2+ release events in ICC. Suppression of Ca2+ release in ICC limits the open probability of Ano1 channels, reducing the excitability of electrically-coupled SMCs.
Cobra venom cardiotoxins (CVCs) can translocate to mitochondria to promote apoptosis by eliciting mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which CVCs are selectively targeted to the mitochondrion to disrupt mitochondrial function remains to be elucidated. By studying cardiotoxin from Naja mossambica mossambica cobra (cardiotoxin VII4), a basic three-fingered S-type cardiotoxin, we hypothesized that cardiotoxin VII4 binds to cardiolipin (CL) in mitochondria to alter mitochondrial structure/function and promote neurotoxicity. By performing confocal analysis, we observed that red-fluorescently tagged cardiotoxin rapidly translocates to mitochondria in mouse primary cortical neurons and in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells to promote aberrant mitochondrial fragmentation, a decline in oxidative phosphorylation, and decreased energy production. In addition, by employing electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and protein nuclear magnetic resonance (¹H-NMR) spectroscopy and phosphorescence quenching of erythrosine in model membranes, our compiled biophysical data show that cardiotoxin VII4 binds to anionic CL, but not to zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine (PC), to increase the permeability and formation of non-bilayer structures in CL-enriched membranes that biochemically mimic the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations and in silico docking studies identified CL binding sites in cardiotoxin VII4 and revealed a molecular mechanism by which cardiotoxin VII4 interacts with CL and PC to bind and penetrate mitochondrial membranes.
The presence of iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) in groundwater is an important concern in populations that use it as source of drinking water. The ingestion of high concentrations of these metals may affect human health. In addition, these metals cause aesthetic and organoleptic problems that affect water quality and also induce corrosion in distribution networks, generating operational and system maintenance problems. Biological sand filter systems are widely used to remove Fe and Mn from groundwater since they are a cost-effective technology and minimize the use of chemical oxidants. In this work, the bacterial communities of two biological water treatment plants from Argentina, exposed to long term presence of Mn(II) and with a high Mn(II) removal efficiency, were characterized using 16S rRNA gene Illumina sequencing. Several selective media were used to culture Mn-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) and a large number of known MOB and several isolates that have never been reported before as MOB were cultivated. These bacteria were characterized to select those with the highest Mn(II) oxidation and biofilm formation capacities and also those that can oxidize Mn(II) at different environmental growth conditions. In addition, studies were performed to determine if the selected MOB were able to oxidize Mn(II) present in groundwater while immobilized on sand. This work allowed the isolation of several bacterial strains adequate to develop an inoculum applicable to improve Mn(II) removal efficiency of sand filter water treatment plants.
Associations of organic carbon (OC) with iron (Fe) oxide minerals play an important role in regulating the stability of OC in soil environments. Knowledge about the fate and stability of Fe-OC complexes is impaired by the heterogeneity of OC. Additional biogeochemical variables in soil environments, such as redox conditions and microbes, further increase complexity in understanding the stability of mineral-associated soil OC. This study investigated the fate and stability of model organic compounds, including glucose (GL), glucosamine (GN), tyrosine (TN), benzoquinone (BQ), amylose (AM), and alginate (AL), complexed with an Fe oxide mineral, ferrihydrite (Fh), during microbial reduction. During a 25-d anaerobic incubation with Shewanella putrefaciens CN32, the reduction of Fe followed the order of Fh-BQ &gt; Fh-GL &gt; Fh-GN &gt; Fh-TN &gt; Fh-AL &gt; Fh-AM. In terms of OC released during the anaerobic incubation, Fh-GN complexes released the highest amount of OC while Fh-AM complexes released the lowest. Organic carbon regulated the reduction of Fe by acting as an electron shuttle, affecting microbial activities, and associating with Fh. Benzoquinone had the highest electron accepting capacity, but potentially can inhibit microbial activity. These findings provide insights into the roles of different organic functional groups in regulating Fe reduction and the stability of Fh-bound OC under anaerobic conditions.
Treacher Collins Syndrome (TCS) is a congenital disease characterized by defects in the craniofacial skeleton and absence of mental alterations. Recently we modelled TCS in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos through the microinjection of Morpholino® oligonucleotides blocking the translation of the ortholog of the main causative gene (TCOF1). We showed that Cnbp, a key cytoprotective protein involved in normal rostral head development, was detected in lower levels (without changes in its mRNA expression) in TCS-like embryos. As previous reports suggested that Cnbp is degraded through the proteasomal pathway, we tested whether proteasome inhibitors (MG132 and Bortezomib (Velcade®, Millennium laboratories)) were able to ameliorate cranial skeleton malformations in TCS. Here we show that treatment with both proteasome inhibitors produced a robust craniofacial cartilage phenotype recovery. This recovery seems to be consequence of a decreased degradation of Cnbp in TCS-like embryos. Critical TCS manifestations, such as neuroepithelial cell death and cell redox imbalance were attenuated. Thus, proteasome inhibitors may offer an opportunity for TCS molecular and phenotypic manifestation's prevention. Although further development of new safe inhibitors compatible with administration during pregnancy is required, our results encourage this therapeutic approach.
Phenology of plants is important for ecological interactions. The timing and development of green leaves, plant maturity, and senescence affects biophysical interactions of plants with the environment. In this study we explored the agreement between land-based camera and satellite-based phenology metrics to quantify plant phenology and phenophases dates in five plant community types characteristic of the semi-arid cold desert region of the Great Basin. Three years of data were analyzed. We calculated the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for both land-based cameras (i.e., phenocams) and Landsat imagery. NDVI from camera images was calculated by taking a standard RGB (red, green, and blue) image and then a near infrared (NIR) plus RGB image. Phenocam NDVI was calculated by extracting the red digital number (DN) and the NIR DN from images taken a few seconds apart. Landsat has a spatial resolution of 30 m², while phenocam spatial resolution can be analyzed at the single pixel level at the scale of cm² or area averaged regions can be analyzed with scales up to 1 km². For this study, phenocam regions of interest were used that approximated the scale of at least one Landsat pixel. In the tall-statured pinyon and juniper woodland sites, there was a lack of agreement in NDVI between phenocam and Landsat NDVI, even after using National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) imagery to account for fractional coverage of pinyon and juniper versus interspace in the phenocam data. Landsat NDVI appeared to be dominated by the signal from the interspace and was insensitive to subtle changes in the pinyon and juniper tree canopy. However, for short-statured sagebrush shrub and meadow communities, there was good agreement between the phenocam and Landsat NDVI as reflected in high Pearson's correlation coefficients (r &gt; 0.75). Due to greater temporal resolution of the phenocams with images taken daily, versus the 16-day return interval of Landsat, phenocam data provided more utility in determining important phenophase dates: start of season, peak of season, and end of season. More specific species-level information can be obtained with the high temporal resolution of phenocams, but only for a limited number of sites, while Landsat can provide the multi-decadal history and spatial coverage that is unmatched by other platforms. The agreement between Landsat and phenocam NDVI for short-statured plant communities of the Great Basin, shows promise for monitoring landscape and regional-level plant phenology across large areas and time periods, with phenocams providing a more comprehensive understanding of plant phenology at finer spatial scales, and Landsat extending the historical record of observations.
The multidomain RNase III endoribonuclease DICER is required for the generation of most functional microRNAs (miRNAs). Loss of Dicer affects developmental processes at different levels. Here, we characterized the zebrafish Dicer1 mutant, dicer1sa9205, which has a single point mutation induced by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis. Heterozygous dicer1sa9205 developed normally, being phenotypically indistinguishable from wild-type siblings. Homozygous dicer1sa9205 mutants display smaller eyes, abnormal craniofacial development and aberrant pigmentation. Reduced numbers of both iridophores and melanocytes were observed in the head and ventral trunk of dicer1sa9205 homozygotes; the effect on melanocytes was stronger and detectable earlier in development. The expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor a (mitfa), the master gene for melanocytes differentiation, was enhanced in dicer1-depleted fish. Similarly, the expression of SRY-box containing gene 10 (sox10), required for mitfa activation, was higher in mutants than in wild types. In silico and in vivo analyses of either sox10 or mitfa 3'UTRs revealed conserved potential miRNA binding sites likely involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of both genes. Based on these findings, we propose that dicer1 participates in the gene regulatory network governing zebrafish melanocyte differentiation by controlling the expression of mitfa and sox10.
Disequilibrium theory is an approach to reinforcement that reconsiders the putative response strengthening prowess of stimuli. This disequilibrium approach-the pinnacle of the response deprivation hypothesis-reliably predicts changes in behavior without reference to a response strengthening process. While the strengthening model of reinforcement has received renewed and critical appraisal in behavior analysis, its appraisers have not fully considered the role that a disequilibrium conceptualization might play in their respective theories of reinforcement. In this essay we celebrate William Timberlake's legacy by elucidating the assumptions of disequilibrium theory and by exploring its predictions and implications within behavior analysis. We treat the disequilibrium approach to reinforcement as the theory of reinforcement in behavior analysis, and in doing so, we distinguish disequilibrium conditions from motivating operations and explore future directions regarding the potential to predict generalization and maintenance outcomes. The disequilibrium approach to reinforcement is not a mere deprivation operation used for the purposes of establishing a stimulus as a "reinforcer," as it is a general theory of behavior.
Obesity has been implicated in the genesis of metabolic syndromes including insulin resistance and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Given the association between T2DM and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), our specific goal was to determine whether the liver of HFD-induced T2DM mice is more sensitive to the carcinogen diethylnitrosamine (DEN), due to a modification of the molecular pathways implicated in the early stages of HCC pathogenesis. C57BL/6 male mice (five-week-old) were divided into 4 groups: C, C + DEN, HFD and HFD + DEN. Mice were euthanized twenty-five weeks after DEN-injection. Livers of HDF-fed mice showed a higher proliferative index than Control groups. In line with this, HFD groups showed an increase of nuclear β-catenin, and interestingly, DEN treatment led to a slight increase in the expression of this protein in HFD group. Based on these results, and to confirm this effect, we analyzed β-catenin target genes, finding that DEN treatment in HFD group led to a significant increase of Vegf, c-myc, c-jun and cyclin D1 expression levels. According to our results, the expression of TCF4 showed to be significantly increased in HFD + DEN vs. HFD. In this regard, the β-catenin/TCF4 complex enhanced its association with pSmads 2/3, as we observed an increase of nuclear Smads expression in HFD + DEN, suggesting a possible role of TGF-β1/Smads signaling pathway in this phenomenon. Our results show that the liver of HFD fed model that resembles early T2DM pathology in mice, is more sensitive to DEN, by inducing both Wnt/β-catenin and TGF β1/Smads tumorigenic pathways.
Toddler emotion regulation develops within the context of relationships but is also influenced by toddlers' individual characteristics. Drawing on transactional and differential susceptibility frameworks, this study examined direct and interactive associations of intrusive parenting, teacher sensitivity, and negative emotionality on toddler emotion regulation development in a sample of Early Head Start families utilizing center-based child care. Latent growth models indicated that, after controlling for a series of family and child care covariates, intrusive parenting at 14 months had diminishing effects on trajectories of emotion regulation across toddlerhood (14 to 36 months), whereas teacher sensitivity in child care was promotive for emotion regulation growth. Toddlers with high negative emotionality were not more susceptible to the effects of intrusive parenting or teacher sensitivity on emotion regulation development, however, results suggested emerging evidence for individual differences in the protective nature of teacher sensitivity in the context of high intrusion at home. Results are discussed in terms of their implications for informing parents and early care and education providers in nurturing relationships with the children who may be the most challenging to care for but may stand to make the greatest gains in emotion regulation development in quality caregiving settings.
Bombolitins, a class of peptides produced by bees of the genus Bombus, target and disrupt cellular membranes, leading to lysis. Antimicrobial peptides exhibit various mechanisms of action resulting from the interplay between peptide structure, lipid composition, and cellular target membrane selectivity. Herein, two bombolitins displaying significant amino-acid-sequence similarity, BII and BL6, were assessed for antimicrobial activity as well as correlated dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelle binding and membrane-induced peptide conformational changes. Infrared and circular dichroism spectroscopies were used to assess the structure-function relationship of each bombolitin, and the results indicate that BII forms a rigid and helically ordered secondary structure upon binding to DPC micelles, whereas BL6 largely lacks secondary structural order. Moreover, the binding affinity of each peptide to DPC micelles was determined, revealing that BL6 displayed a difference in binding affinity by over two orders of magnitude. Further investigations into the growth-inhibitory activity of the two bombolitins were performed against Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Interestingly, BII specifically targeted S. cerevisiae, whereas BL6 more effectively inhibited E. coli growth. Overall, the antimicrobial selectivity and specificity of BII and BL6 are largely dependent on the primary as well as secondary structural content of the peptides and the membrane composition.
Gel mobility shift assays are commonly used to study DNA-binding factors involved in the regulation of constitutive, tissue-specific, and inducible genes. We found that addition of 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-propanesulfonate (Chaps, a zwitterionic detergent) at relatively high concentration (2.5% or more) to DNA-binding reactions for four different factors (AP-1, SP1, GATA-1, and interferon alpha-regulated factor ISGF3) assayed in cell extracts greatly enhanced the signal for DNA-protein complexes (up to about 20-fold). The amplified signal for DNA-protein complexes so obtained was (at least in part) due to increased binding efficiency, as revealed by greatly reduced amounts of the free probes in the gels. The binding specificity, however, was not compromised. The fact that DNA-protein complex formation with four different factors was stimulated by Chaps suggests that the enhancing effect of Chaps may be more general and not limited to certain types of DNA-binding factors. The results provide the basis for a highly sensitive assay for DNA-binding factors, which may be useful in several types of studies on such factors. Among other detergents tested, Chapso (another zwitterionic detergent), NP-40, and octylglucopyranoside (nonionic detergents) were found also to enhance the complex formation as tested for AP-1 binding, whereas sodium cholate and deoxycholate showed strong inhibition.
Liver cancer has the second highest worldwide cancer mortality rate and has limited therapeutic options. We analyzed 363 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases by whole-exome sequencing and DNA copy number analyses, and we analyzed 196 HCC cases by DNA methylation, RNA, miRNA, and proteomic expression also. DNA sequencing and mutation analysis identified significantly mutated genes, including LZTR1, EEF1A1, SF3B1, and SMARCA4. Significant alterations by mutation or downregulation by hypermethylation in genes likely to result in HCC metabolic reprogramming (ALB, APOB, and CPS1) were observed. Integrative molecular HCC subtyping incorporating unsupervised clustering of five data platforms identified three subtypes, one of which was associated with poorer prognosis in three HCC cohorts. Integrated analyses enabled development of a p53 target gene expression signature correlating with poor survival. Potential therapeutic targets for which inhibitors exist include WNT signaling, MDM4, MET, VEGFA, MCL1, IDH1, TERT, and immune checkpoint proteins CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1.
BackgroundPersistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is characterized by elevated pulmonary vascular resistance. Endogenous nitric oxide is critical for regulation of pulmonary vascular resistance. Nitric oxide is generated from L-arginine, supplied by the urea cycle (UC). We hypothesized that polymorphisms in UC enzyme genes and low concentrations of UC intermediates are associated with PPHN.MethodsWe performed a family-based candidate gene analysis to study 48 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in six UC enzyme genes. Genotyping was carried out in 94 infants with PPHN and their parents. We also performed a case-control analysis of 32 cases with PPHN and 64 controls to identify an association between amino-acid levels on initial newborn screening and PPHN.ResultsThree SNPs (rs41272673, rs4399666, and rs2287599) in carbamoyl phosphate synthase 1 gene (CPS1) showed a significant association with PPHN (P=0.02). Tyrosine levels were significantly lower (P=0.003) and phenylalanine levels were significantly higher (P=0.01) in cases with PPHN. There was no difference in the arginine or citrulline levels between the two groups.ConclusionsThis study suggests an association (P&lt;0.05) between SNPs in CPS1 and PPHN. These findings warrant further replication in larger cohorts of patients.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae is responsible for wine must fermentation. In this process, nitrogen represents a limiting nutrient and its scarcity results in important economic losses for the wine industry. Yeast isolates use different strategies to grow in poor nitrogen environments and their genomic plasticity enables adaptation to multiple habitats through improvements in nitrogen consumption. Here, we used a highly recombinant S. cerevisiae multi-parent population (SGRP-4X) derived from the intercross of four parental strains of different origins to identify new genetic variants responsible for nitrogen consumption differences during wine fermentation. Analysis of 165 fully sequenced F12 segregants allowed us to map 26 QTL in narrow intervals for 14 amino acid sources and ammonium, the majority of which represent genomic regions previously unmapped for these traits. To complement this strategy, we performed Bulk segregant RNA-seq (BSR-seq) analysis in segregants exhibiting extremely high and low ammonium consumption levels. This identified several QTL overlapping differentially expressed genes and refined the gene candidate search. Based on these approaches, we were able to validate ARO1, PDC1, CPS1, ASI2, LYP1, and ALP1 allelic variants underlying nitrogen consumption differences between strains, providing evidence of many genes with small phenotypic effects. Altogether, these variants significantly shape yeast nitrogen consumption with important implications for evolution, ecological, and quantitative genomics.
Both primary hepatocytes and stem cells-derived hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) are major sources for bioartificial liver (BAL). Maintenance of hepatocellular functions and induction of functional maturity of HLCs are critical for BAL's support effect. It remains difficult to assess and improve detoxification functions inherent to hepatocytes, including ammonia clearance. Here, we aim to assess ammonia metabolism and identify ammonia detoxification enhancer by developing an imaging strategy. In hepatoma cell line HepG2, and immortalized hepatic cell line LO2, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) gene, the first enzyme of ammonia-eliminating urea cycle, was labelled with fluorescence protein via CRISPR/Cas9 system. With the reporter-based screening approach, cellular detoxification enhancers were selected among a collection of 182 small molecules. In both CPS1 reporter cell lines, the fluorescence intensity is positively correlated with cellular CPS1 mRNA expression, ammonia elimination and secreted urea, and reflected ammonia detoxification in a dose-dependent manner. Surprisingly, high-level CPS1 reporter clones also reserved many other critical hepatocellular functions, for example albumin secretion and cytochrome 450 metabolic functions. Sodium phenylbutyrate and resveratrol were identified to enhance metabolism-related gene expression and liver-enriched transcription factors C/EBPα, HNF4α. In conclusion, the CPS1-reporter system provides an economic and effective platform for assessment of cellular metabolic function and high-throughput identification of chemical compounds that improve detoxification activities in hepatic lineage cells.
Metabolic reprogramming by oncogenic signals promotes cancer initiation and progression. The oncogene KRAS and tumour suppressor STK11, which encodes the kinase LKB1, regulate metabolism and are frequently mutated in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Concurrent occurrence of oncogenic KRAS and loss of LKB1 (KL) in cells specifies aggressive oncological behaviour. Here we show that human KL cells and tumours share metabolomic signatures of perturbed nitrogen handling. KL cells express the urea cycle enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase-1 (CPS1), which produces carbamoyl phosphate in the mitochondria from ammonia and bicarbonate, initiating nitrogen disposal. Transcription of CPS1 is suppressed by LKB1 through AMPK, and CPS1 expression correlates inversely with LKB1 in human NSCLC. Silencing CPS1 in KL cells induces cell death and reduces tumour growth. Notably, cell death results from pyrimidine depletion rather than ammonia toxicity, as CPS1 enables an unconventional pathway of nitrogen flow from ammonia into pyrimidines. CPS1 loss reduces the pyrimidine to purine ratio, compromises S-phase progression and induces DNA-polymerase stalling and DNA damage. Exogenous pyrimidines reverse DNA damage and rescue growth. The data indicate that the KL oncological genotype imposes a metabolic vulnerability related to a dependence on a cross-compartmental pathway of pyrimidine metabolism in an aggressive subset of NSCLC.
The urea cycle disorder carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency is an important differential diagnosis in the encephalopathic neonate. This intoxication type inborn error of metabolism often leads to neonatal death or severe and irreversible damage of the central nervous system, even despite appropriate treatment. Timely diagnosis is crucial, but can be difficult on routine metabolite level. Here, we report ten neonates from eight families (finally) diagnosed with CPS1 deficiency at three tertiary metabolic centres. In seven of them the laboratory findings were dominated by significantly elevated urinary 3-methylglutaconic acid levels which complicated the diagnostic process. Our findings are both important for the differential diagnosis of patients with urea cycle disorders and also broaden the differential diagnosis of hyperammonemia associated with 3-methylglutaconic aciduria, which was earlier only reported in TMEM70 and SERAC1 defect.
Carbamoyl Phosphate Synthetase 1 deficiency (CPS1D) is a rare autosomal recessive inborn metabolic disease characterized mainly by hyperammonemia. The fatal nature of CPS1D and its similar symptoms with other urea cycle disorders (UCDs) make its diagnosis difficult, and the molecular diagnosis is hindered due to the large size of the causative gene CPS1. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to investigate the clinical applicability of exome sequencing in molecular diagnosis of CPS1D in Chinese population.
We described two Chinese neonates presented with unconsciousness and drowsiness due to deepening encephalopathy with hyperammonemia. Whole exome sequencing was performed. Candidate mutations were validated by Sanger sequencing. In-silicon analysis was processed for the pathogenicity predictions of the identified mutations.
Two compound heterozygous mutations in the gene carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1(CPS1) were identified. One is in Case 1 with two novel missense mutations (c.2537C&gt;T, p. Pro846Leu and c.3443T&gt;A, p.Met1148Lys), and the other one is in Case 2 with a novel missense mutation (c.1799G&gt;A, p.Cys600Tyr) and a previously reported 12-bp deletion (c.4088_4099del, p.Leu 1363_Ile1366del). Bioinformatics deleterious predictions indicated pathogenicity of the missense mutations. Conversation analysis and homology modeling showed that the substituted amino acids were highly evolutionary conserved and necessary for enzyme stability or function.
The present study initially and successfully applied whole exome sequencing to the molecular diagnosis of CPS1D in Chinese neonates, indicating its applicability in cost-effective molecular diagnosis of CPS1D. Three novel pathogenic missense mutations were identified, expanded the mutational spectrum of the CPS1 gene.
Liver kinase B1 ( LKB1 ) is a tumor suppressor in lung adenocarcinoma (LADC). We investigated the proteomic profiles of 45 LADC cell lines with and without LKB1 inactivation. Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1), the first rate-limiting mitochondrial enzyme in the urea cycle, was distinctively overexpressed in LKB1-inactivated LADC cell lines. We therefore assessed the role of CPS1 and its clinical relevance in LKB1-inactivated LADC.
Mass spectrometric profiling of proteome and metabolome and function of CPS1 were analyzed in LADC cell lines. CPS1 and LKB1 expression in tumors from 305 LADC and 160 lung squamous cell carcinoma patients was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were applied to assess the association between overall survival and CPS1 and LKB1 expression. All statistical tests were two-sided.
CPS1 knockdown reduced cell growth, decreased metabolite levels associated with nucleic acid biosynthesis pathway, and contributed an additive effect when combined with gemcitabine, pemetrexed, or CHK1 inhibitor AZD7762. Tissue microarray analysis revealed that CPS1 was expressed in 65.7% of LKB1-negative LADC, and only 5.0% of LKB1-positive LADC. CPS1 expression showed statistically significant association with poor overall survival in LADC (hazard ratio = 3.03, 95% confidence interval = 1.74 to 5.25, P &lt; .001).
Our findings suggest functional relevance of CPS1 in LKB1-inactivated LADC and association with worse outcome of LADC. CPS1 is a promising therapeutic target in combination with other chemotherapy agents, as well as a prognostic biomarker, enabling a personalized approach to treatment of LADC.
The lack of high-throughput methods to analyze the adipose tissue protein composition limits our understanding of the protein networks responsible for age and diet related metabolic response. We have developed an approach using multiple-dimension liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and extended multiplexing (24 biological samples) with tandem mass tags (TMT) labeling to analyze proteomes of epididymal adipose tissues isolated from mice fed either low or high fat diet for a short or a long-term, and from mice that aged on low versus high fat diets. The peripheral metabolic health (as measured by body weight, adiposity, plasma fasting glucose, insulin, triglycerides, total cholesterol levels, and glucose and insulin tolerance tests) deteriorated with diet and advancing age, with long-term high fat diet exposure being the worst. In response to short-term high fat diet, 43 proteins representing lipid metabolism (e.g. AACS, ACOX1, ACLY) and red-ox pathways (e.g. CPD2, CYP2E, SOD3) were significantly altered (FDR &lt; 10%). Long-term high fat diet significantly altered 55 proteins associated with immune response (e.g. IGTB2, IFIT3, LGALS1) and rennin angiotensin system (e.g. ENPEP, CMA1, CPA3, ANPEP). Age-related changes on low fat diet significantly altered only 18 proteins representing mainly urea cycle (e.g. OTC, ARG1, CPS1), and amino acid biosynthesis (e.g. GMT, AKR1C6). Surprisingly, high fat diet driven age-related changes culminated with alterations in 155 proteins involving primarily the urea cycle (e.g. ARG1, CPS1), immune response/complement activation (e.g. C3, C4b, C8, C9, CFB, CFH, FGA), extracellular remodeling (e.g. EFEMP1, FBN1, FBN2, LTBP4, FERMT2, ECM1, EMILIN2, ITIH3) and apoptosis (e.g. YAP1, HIP1, NDRG1, PRKCD, MUL1) pathways. Using our adipose tissue tailored approach we have identified both age-related and high fat diet specific proteomic signatures highlighting a pronounced involvement of arginine metabolism in response to advancing age, and branched chain amino acid metabolism in early response to high fat feeding. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD005953.
Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) deficiency (CPS1D) is a rare autosomal recessive urea cycle disorder (UCD), which can lead to life-threatening hyperammonemia. Unless promptly treated, it can result in encephalopathy, coma and death, or intellectual disability in surviving patients. Over recent decades, therapies for CPS1D have barely improved leaving the management of these patients largely unchanged. Additionally, in many cases, current management (protein-restriction and supplementation with citrulline and/or arginine and ammonia scavengers) is insufficient for achieving metabolic stability, highlighting the importance of developing alternative therapeutic approaches. Areas covered: After describing UCDs and CPS1D, we give an overview of the structure- function of CPS1. We then describe current management and potential novel treatments including N-carbamoyl-L-glutamate (NCG), pharmacological chaperones, and gene therapy to treat hyperammonemia. Expert opinion: Probably, the first novel CPS1D therapies to reach the clinics will be the already commercial substance NCG, which is the standard treatment for N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency and has been proven to rescue specific CPS1D mutations. Pharmacological chaperones and gene therapy are under development too, but these two technologies still have key challenges to be overcome. In addition, current experimental therapies will hopefully add further treatment options.
The dynamin-like protein, Vps1, is a GTPase involved in cargo sorting and membrane remodeling in multiple cellular trafficking pathways. Recently, Vps1 has been shown to genetically interact with ESCRT subunits. We tested the hypothesis that the functional connection of Vps1 with some of these subunits of ESCRT complexes occurs via a physical interaction. By utilizing the yeast two-hybrid system, we revealed that Vps1 physically interacts with the ESCRT-II subunits, Vps22 and Vps36, and the ESCRT-III subunit Vps24. We found that Vps1 and ESCRT-II components colocalize with Pep12, an endosomal marker. Additionally, loss of Vps1 or depletion of the GTPase activity of Vps1 results in a moderate defect in Cps1 targeting to the vacuole. Here, we discussed the potential implications of Vps1 and ESCRT interaction and their roles in the endosome-to-vacuole traffic. In summary, yeast dynamin interacts with ESCRT II and III complexes, and it functions in Cps1 trafficking toward the vacuole.
The nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group H member 4 (NR1H4 or farnesoid X receptor [FXR]) regulates bile acid synthesis, transport, and catabolism. FXR also regulates postprandial lipid and glucose metabolism. We performed quantitative proteomic analyses of liver tissues from mice to evaluate these functions and investigate whether FXR regulates amino acid metabolism.
To study the role of FXR in mouse liver, we used mice with a disruption of Nr1h4 (FXR-knockout mice) and compared them with floxed control mice. Mice were gavaged with the FXR agonist obeticholic acid or vehicle for 11 days. Proteome analyses, as well as targeted metabolomics and chromatin immunoprecipitation, were performed on the livers of these mice. Primary rat hepatocytes were used to validate the role of FXR in amino acid catabolism by gene expression and metabolomics studies. Finally, control mice and mice with liver-specific disruption of Nr1h4 (liver FXR-knockout mice) were re-fed with a high-protein diet after 6 hours fasting and gavaged a 15NH4Cl tracer. Gene expression and the metabolome were studied in the livers and plasma from these mice.
In livers of control mice and primary rat hepatocytes, activation of FXR with obeticholic acid increased expression of proteins that regulate amino acid degradation, ureagenesis, and glutamine synthesis. We found FXR to bind to regulatory sites of genes encoding these proteins in control livers. Liver tissues from FXR-knockout mice had reduced expression of urea cycle proteins, and accumulated precursors of ureagenesis, compared with control mice. In liver FXR-knockout mice on a high-protein diet, the plasma concentration of newly formed urea was significantly decreased compared with controls. In addition, liver FXR-knockout mice had reduced hepatic expression of enzymes that regulate ammonium detoxification compared with controls. In contrast, obeticholic acid increased expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in ureagenesis compared with vehicle in C57Bl/6 mice.
In livers of mice, FXR regulates amino acid catabolism and detoxification of ammonium via ureagenesis and glutamine synthesis. Failure of the urea cycle and hyperammonemia are common in patients with acute and chronic liver diseases; compounds that activate FXR might promote ammonium clearance in these patients.
This study documents the disparate therapeutic effect of N-carbamyl-l-glutamate (NCG) in the activation of two different disease-causing mutants of carbamyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1). We investigated the effects of NCG on purified recombinant wild-type (WT) mouse CPS1 and its human corresponding E1034G (increased ureagenesis on NCG) and M792I (decreased ureagenesis on NCG) mutants. NCG activates WT CPS1 sub-optimally compared to NAG. Similar to NAG, NCG, in combination with MgATP, stabilizes the enzyme, but competes with NAG binding to the enzyme. NCG supplementation activates available E1034G mutant CPS1 molecules not bound to NAG enhancing ureagenesis. Conversely, NCG competes with NAG binding to the scarce M792I mutant enzyme further decreasing residual ureagenesis. These results correlate with the respective patient's response to NCG. Particular caution should be taken in the administration of NCG to patients with hyperammonemia before their molecular bases of their urea cycle disorders is known.
Diagnosis of the urea cycle disorder (USD) carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) deficiency (CPS1D) based on only the measurements of biochemical intermediary metabolites is not sufficient to properly exclude other UCDs with similar symptoms. We report the first Korean CPS1D patient using whole exome sequencing (WES). A four-day-old female neonate presented with respiratory failure due to severe metabolic encephalopathy with hyperammonemia (1,690 μmol/L; reference range, 11.2-48.2 μmol/L). Plasma amino acid analysis revealed markedly elevated levels of alanine (2,923 μmol/L; reference range, 131-710 μmol/L) and glutamine (5,777 μmol/L; reference range, 376-709 μmol/L), whereas that of citrulline was decreased (2 μmol/L; reference range, 10-45 μmol/L). WES revealed compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in the CPS1 gene: one novel nonsense pathogenic variant of c.580C&gt;T (p.Gln194*) and one known pathogenic frameshift pathogenic variant of c.1547delG (p.Gly516Alafs*5), which was previously reported in Japanese patients with CPS1D. We successfully applied WES to molecularly diagnose the first Korean patient with CPS1D in a clinical setting. This result supports the clinical applicability of WES for cost-effective molecular diagnosis of UCDs.
The p.Thr1406Asn (rs1047891) polymorphism of the carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) gene has been linked to functional consequences affecting the downstream availability of the nitric oxide precursor L-arginine. L-arginine concentrations are decreased in preterm infants with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). In this multicenter prospective study, we investigated the association of the p.Thr1406Asn polymorphism with NEC in 477 preterm infants (36 cases of NEC) from 4 European neonatal intensive care units (Maastricht, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Mantova, and Milan). Allele and genotype frequencies of the p.Thr1406Asn polymorphism did not significantly differ between the infants with and without NEC. In contrast, the minor A-allele was significantly less frequent in the group of 64 infants with the combined outcome NEC or death before 34 weeks of corrected gestational age than in the infants without the outcome (0.20 vs. 0.31, P = 0.03). In addition, a significant negative association of the A-allele with the combined outcome NEC or death was found using the dominant (adjusted odds ratio, aOR: 0.54, 95% CI 0.29-0.99) and the additive (aOR 0.58, 95% CI 0.36-0.93) genetic models. In conclusion, our study provides further evidence that a functional variant of the CPS1 gene may contribute to NEC susceptibility.
Streptococcus suis (S. suis) caused serious disease symptoms in humans and pigs. S. suis is able to form thick biofilms and this increases the difficulty of treatment. After growth with 1/2 minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of azithromycin, 1/4 MIC of azithromycin, or 1/8 MIC of azithromycin, biofilm formation of S. suis dose-dependently decreased in the present study. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed the obvious effect of azithromycin against biofilm formation of S. suis. Especially, at two different conditions (1/2 MIC of azithromycin non-treated cells and treated cells), we carried out comparative proteomic analyses of cells by using iTRAQ technology. Finally, the results revealed the existence of 19 proteins of varying amounts. Interestingly, several cell surface proteins (such as ATP-binding cassette superfamily ATP-binding cassette transporter (G7SD52), CpsR (K0FG35), Cps1/2H (G8DTL7), CPS16F (E9NQ13), putative uncharacterized protein (G7SER0), NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G5L259), putative uncharacterized protein (G7S2D6), amino acid permease (B0M0G6), and NsuB (G5L351)) were found to be implicated in biofilm formation. More importantly, we also found that azithromycin affected expression of the genes cps1/2H, cpsR and cps16F. Especially, after growth with 1/2 MIC of azithromycin and 1/4 MIC of azithromycin, the capsular polysaccharide content of S. suis was significantly higher.
Previous studies suggest that elevated total homocysteine levels and the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T polymorphism, which correlates with plasma total homocysteine levels, are risk factors for schizophrenia (SCZ). Recently, a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) of plasma total homocysteine levels in individuals of European ancestry identified many single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (n=13,974). The primary purpose of this study was to examine the association between these plasma total homocysteine-related SNPs and SCZ in the Japanese population. First, we investigated associations between six SNPs and plasma total homocysteine levels in non-psychiatric subjects in the Japanese population (n=1030). Then, we evaluated the cumulative effects of three SNPs on SCZ risk by calculating the Genotype Risk Score (GRS) (1120 cases, 2643 controls). Of the six SNPs examined, we replicated similar associations with the European GWAS at four loci (CENPQ, CPS1, MTHFR, and MUT). GRS based on three SNPs (CENPQ, CPS1, and MTHFR) was significantly associated with SCZ. Our findings suggest that common polygenic variations, which are associated with the plasma total homocysteine levels, may contribute to the risk of SCZ.
Cytokinesis in many organisms requires a plasma membrane anchored actomyosin ring, whose contraction facilitates cell division. In yeast and fungi, actomyosin ring constriction is also coordinated with division septum assembly. How the actomyosin ring interacts with the plasma membrane and the plasma membrane-localized septum synthesizing machinery remains poorly understood. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, an attractive model organism to study cytokinesis, the β-1,3-glucan synthase Cps1p / Bgs1p, an integral membrane protein, localizes to the plasma membrane overlying the actomyosin ring and is required for primary septum synthesis. Through a high-dosage suppressor screen we identified an essential gene, sbg1+ (suppressor of beta glucan synthase 1), which suppressed the colony formation defect of Bgs1-defective cps1-191 mutant at higher temperatures. Sbg1p, an integral membrane protein, localizes to the cell ends and to the division site. Sbg1p and Bgs1p physically interact and are dependent on each other to localize to the division site. Loss of Sbg1p results in an unstable actomyosin ring that unravels and slides, leading to an inability to deposit a single contiguous division septum and an important reduction of the β-1,3-glucan proportion in the cell wall, coincident with that observed in the cps1-191 mutant. Sbg1p shows genetic and / or physical interaction with Rga7p, Imp2p, Cdc15p, and Pxl1p, proteins known to be required for actomyosin ring integrity and efficient septum synthesis. This study establishes Sbg1p as a key member of a group of proteins that link the plasma membrane, the actomyosin ring, and the division septum assembly machinery in fission yeast.
Conventional natural killer (cNK) cells, members of group 1 innate lymphoid cells, are a diverse cell subpopulation based on surface receptor expression, maturation, and functional potential. cNK cells are critical for early immunity to Toxoplasma gondii via IFNγ production. Acute cNK cell responses to infection with different strains of T. gondii have not yet been characterized in detail. Here, we comprehensively performed this analysis with Type I virulent RH, Type II avirulent ME49, and fully attenuated Type I cps1-1 strains. In response to these three parasite strains, murine cNK cells produce IFNγ and become cytotoxic and polyfunctional (IFNγ+CD107a+) at the site of infection. In contrast to virulent RH and avirulent ME49 T. gondii strains, attenuated cps1-1 induced only local cNK cell responses. Infections with RH and ME49 parasites significantly decreased cNK cell frequency and numbers in spleen 5 days post infection compared with cps1-1 parasites. cNK cell subsets expressing activating receptors Ly49H, Ly49D, and NKG2D and inhibitory receptors Ly49I and CD94/NKG2A were similar when compared between the strains and at 5 days post infection. cNK cells were not proliferating (Ki67-) 5 days post infection with any of the strains. cNK cell maturation as measured by CD27, CD11b, and KLRG1 was affected after infection with different parasite strains. RH and ME49 infection significantly reduced mature cNK cell frequency and increased immature cNK cell populations compared with cps1-1 infection. Interestingly, KLRG1 was highly expressed on immature cNK cells after RH infection. After RH and ME49 infections, CD69+ cNK cells in spleen were present at higher frequency than after cps1-1 infection, which may correlate with loss of the mature cNK cell population. Cytokine multiplex analysis indicated cNK cell responses correlated with peritoneal exudate cell, spleen, and serum proinflammatory cytokine levels, including IL-12. qPCR analysis of parasite-specific B1 gene revealed that parasite burdens may affect cNK cell responses. This study demonstrates infection with RH and ME49 parasites impacts cNK cell maturation during acute T. gondii infection. Different cNK cell responses could impact early immunity and susceptibility to these strains.
Ammonia detoxification, which takes place via the hepatic urea cycle, is essential for nitrogen homeostasis and physiological well-being. It has been reported that a reduction in dietary protein reduces urea nitrogen. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are major regulatory non-coding RNAs that have significant effects on several metabolic pathways; however, little is known on whether miRNAs regulate hepatic urea synthesis. The objective of this study was to assess the miRNA expression profile in a low protein diet and identify miRNAs involved in the regulation of the hepatic urea cycle using a porcine model. Weaned 28-days old piglets were fed a corn-soybean normal protein diet (NP) or a corn-soybean low protein diet (LP) for 30 d. Hepatic and blood samples were collected, and the miRNA expression profile was assessed by sequencing and qRT-PCR. Furthermore, we evaluated the possible role of miR-19b in urea synthesis regulation. There were 25 differentially expressed miRNAs between the NP and LP groups. Six of these miRNAs were predicted to be involved in urea cycle metabolism. MiR-19b negatively regulated urea synthesis by targeting SIRT5, which is a positive regulator of CPS1, the rate limiting enzyme in the urea cycle. Our study presented a novel explanation of ureagenesis regulation by miRNAs.
The long noncoding CPS1 intronic transcript 1 (lncRNA CPS1-IT1) is a recently identified tumor suppressor in the lncRNA family of proteins. Whether this lncRNA plays any functional role in solid tumors remains largely unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the role of lncRNA CPS1-IT1 in human lung cancer. Expression of lncRNA CPS1-IT1 was initially assessed in human lung cancer and in a series of lung cancer cell lines. The effects of CPS1-IT1 overexpression on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were examined in lung cancer cell lines A549 and 95D. It was found that lncRNA CPS1-IT1 was significantly lower in cancerous tissues than in noncancerous tissues. lncRNA CPS1-IT1 was differentially expressed in lung cancer cell lines and expressed the least in two highly invasive cell lines, A549 and 95D. Overexpression of CPS1-IT1 slowed down cell proliferation by 35.7% in A549 cells and 30.8% in 95D cells on the fifth day. Cell migration was inhibited by 59% in A549 cells and 48% in 95D cells, and cell invasion was suppressed by 60% in both cell lines after overexpression of CPS1-IT1. While cell apoptosis was induced, CPS1-IT1 overexpression promoted the activities of caspase 3 and caspase 9 without affecting that of caspase 8. These observations were suggestive of the tumor-suppressive role of lncRNA CPS1-IT1 in lung cancer. Our data suggest that CPS1-IT1 may be used as a biomarker for early diagnosis and therapeutic targets against lncRNA and may be promising in the treatment of lung cancer.
The urea cycle is the main pathway for the disposal of excess nitrogen. Carbamoylphosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1), the first and rate-limiting enzyme of urea cycle, is activated by N-acetylglutamate (NAG), and thus N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) is an essential part of the urea cycle. Although NAGS deficiency is the rarest urea cycle disorder, it is the only one that can be specifically and effectively treated by a drug, N-carbamylglutamate, a stable structural analogous of NAG that activates CPS1. Here we report an infant with NAGS deficiency who presented with neonatal hyperammonemia. She was found to have a novel homozygous splice-site mutation, c.1097-2A&gt;T, in the NAGS gene. We describe the clinical course of this infant, who had rapid response to N-carbamylglutamate treatment. In addition, we reviewed the clinical and molecular spectra of previously reported individuals with NAGS deficiency, which presents in most cases with neonatal hyperammonemia, and in some cases the presentation is later, with a broad spectrum of ages and manifestations. With this broad later-onset phenotypic spectrum, maintaining a high index of suspicion is needed for the early diagnosis of this treatable disease. 
Urea cycle disorders (UCDs) are rare inherited metabolic defects of ammonia detoxification. In about half of patients presenting with a UCD, the first symptoms appear within a few days after birth. These neonatal onset patients generally have a severe defect of urea cycle function and their survival and outcome prognoses are often limited. To understand better the current situation of neonatal onset in UCDs, we have performed a multicentre, retrospective, non-interventional case series study focussing on the most severe UCDs, namely defects of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1), ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), and argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS).
Data of 63 patients were collected (27 patients with ASS deficiency, 23 patients with OTC deficiency, and 12 patients with CPS1 deficiency, one patient definite diagnosis not documented). The majority of patients (43/63, 68 %) had an initial ammonia concentration exceeding 500 μmol/L (normal &lt; 100), of which most (26/43, 60.5 %) were also encephalopathic and were treated with hemodialysis. In patients surviving the initial crisis, recurrence of hyperammonemic events within the first 1.5 years of life occurred frequently (mean 3.6 events, range 0-20). Of all patients, 16 (25.4 %) died during or immediately after the neonatal period.
We observed in this cohort of neonatal onset UCD patients a high rate of initial life-threatening hyperammonemia and a high risk of recurrence of severe hyperammonemic crises. These corresponded to a high mortality rate during the entire study period (30.2 %) despite the fact that patients were treated in leading European metabolic centers. This underlines the need to critically re-evaluate the current treatment strategies in these patients.
Circulating blood cell counts and indices are important indicators of hematopoietic function and a number of clinical parameters, such as blood oxygen-carrying capacity, inflammation, and hemostasis. By performing whole-exome sequence association analyses of hematologic quantitative traits in 15,459 community-dwelling individuals, followed by in silico replication in up to 52,024 independent samples, we identified two previously undescribed coding variants associated with lower platelet count: a common missense variant in CPS1 (rs1047891, MAF = 0.33, discovery + replication p = 6.38 × 10(-10)) and a rare synonymous variant in GFI1B (rs150813342, MAF = 0.009, discovery + replication p = 1.79 × 10(-27)). By performing CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in hematopoietic cell lines and follow-up targeted knockdown experiments in primary human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, we demonstrate an alternative splicing mechanism by which the GFI1B rs150813342 variant suppresses formation of a GFI1B isoform that preferentially promotes megakaryocyte differentiation and platelet production. These results demonstrate how unbiased studies of natural variation in blood cell traits can provide insight into the regulation of human hematopoiesis.
The CPS1 gene was identified as a virulence factor in the maize pathogen Cochliobolus heterostrophus Hypothesizing that the homologous gene in Coccidioides posadasii could be important for virulence, we created a Δcps1 deletion mutant which was unable to cause disease in three strains of mice (C57BL/6, BALB/c, or the severely immunodeficient NOD-scid,γc(null) [NSG]). Only a single colony was recovered from 1 of 60 C57BL/6 mice following intranasal infections of up to 4,400 spores. Following administration of very high doses (10,000 to 2.5 × 10(7) spores) to NSG and BALB/c mice, spherules were observed in lung sections at time points from day 3 to day 10 postinfection, but nearly all appeared degraded with infrequent endosporulation. Although the role of CPS1 in virulence is not understood, phenotypic alterations and transcription differences of at least 33 genes in the Δcps1 strain versus C. posadasii is consistent with both metabolic and regulatory functions for the gene. The in vitro phenotype of the Δcps1 strain showed slower growth of mycelia with delayed and lower spore production than C. posadasii, and in vitro spherules were smaller. Vaccination of C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice with live Δcps1 spores either intranasally, intraperitoneally, or subcutaneously resulted in over 95% survival with mean residual lung fungal burdens of &lt;1,000 CFU from an otherwise lethal C. posadasii intranasal infection. Considering its apparently complete attenuation of virulence and the high degree of resistance to C. posadasii infection when used as a vaccine, the Δcps1 strain is a promising vaccine candidate for preventing coccidioidomycosis in humans or other animals.
Genetic differences in the target proteins, metabolizing enzymes and transporters that contribute to inter-individual differences in drug response are not integrated in contemporary drug development programs. Ayurveda, that has propelled many drug discovery programs albeit for the search of new chemical entities incorporates inter-individual variability "Prakriti" in development and administration of drug in an individualized manner. Prakriti of an individual largely determines responsiveness to external environment including drugs as well as susceptibility to diseases. Prakriti has also been shown to have molecular and genomic correlates. We highlight how integration of Prakriti concepts can augment the efficiency of drug discovery and development programs through a unique initiative of Ayurgenomics TRISUTRA consortium.
Five aspects that have been carried out are (1) analysis of variability in FDA approved pharmacogenomics genes/SNPs in exomes of 72 healthy individuals including predominant Prakriti types and matched controls from a North Indian Indo-European cohort (2) establishment of a consortium network and development of five genetically homogeneous cohorts from diverse ethnic and geo-climatic background (3) identification of parameters and development of uniform standard protocols for objective assessment of Prakriti types (4) development of protocols for Prakriti evaluation and its application in more than 7500 individuals in the five cohorts (5) Development of data and sample repository and integrative omics pipelines for identification of genomic correlates.
Highlight of the study are (1) Exome sequencing revealed significant differences between Prakriti types in 28 SNPs of 11 FDA approved genes of pharmacogenomics relevance viz. CYP2C19, CYP2B6, ESR1, F2, PGR, HLA-B, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DRB1, LDLR, CFTR, CPS1. These variations are polymorphic in diverse Indian and world populations included in 1000 genomes project. (2) Based on the phenotypic attributes of Prakriti we identified anthropometry for anatomical features, biophysical parameters for skin types, HRV for autonomic function tests, spirometry for vital capacity and gustometry for taste thresholds as objective parameters. (3) Comparison of Prakriti phenotypes across different ethnic, age and gender groups led to identification of invariant features as well as some that require weighted considerations across the cohorts.
Considering the molecular and genomics differences underlying Prakriti and relevance in disease pharmacogenomics studies, this novel integrative platform would help in identification of differently susceptible and drug responsive population. Additionally, integrated analysis of phenomic and genomic variations would not only allow identification of clinical and genomic markers of Prakriti for application in personalized medicine but also its integration in drug discovery and development programs.
Carbamyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) was down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as treated by aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), a potent hepatocarcinogenesis mycotoxin. In this study, we firstly confirmed that AFB1 down-regulated the expression of CPS1 in a dose-dependent manner. At the meantime, both siRNA knock down of CPS1 and AFB1 treatment inhibited cell proliferation, and induced cell apoptosis. To further analysis the function of CPS1, the interacting proteins of CPS1 were searched by Co-IP, and three interacting proteins including type II cytoskeletal 1 (KRT1), albumin (ALB), and ubiquitin C (UBC) were found. Both KRT1 and ALB were new interacting proteins for CPS1. Our further study showed that CPS1 was regulating interacted and colocalized with KRT1 and ALB, and the intensity correlation was changed by AFB1. KRT1, ALB and CPS1 were all reported to play an important role in differentiation and tissue specialization. These results may offer an increasing understand that CPS1 might have a function in differentiation. 
Whole-exome sequencing (WES) has led to an exponential increase in identification of causative variants in mitochondrial disorders (MD).
We performed WES in 113 MD suspected patients from Polish paediatric reference centre, in whom routine testing failed to identify a molecular defect. WES was performed using TruSeqExome enrichment, followed by variant prioritization, validation by Sanger sequencing, and segregation with the disease phenotype in the family.
Likely causative mutations were identified in 67 (59.3 %) patients; these included variants in mtDNA (6 patients) and nDNA: X-linked (9 patients), autosomal dominant (5 patients), and autosomal recessive (47 patients, 11 homozygotes). Novel variants accounted for 50.5 % (50/99) of all detected changes. In 47 patients, changes in 31 MD-related genes (ACAD9, ADCK3, AIFM1, CLPB, COX10, DLD, EARS2, FBXL4, MTATP6, MTFMT, MTND1, MTND3, MTND5, NAXE, NDUFS6, NDUFS7, NDUFV1, OPA1, PARS2, PC, PDHA1, POLG, RARS2, RRM2B, SCO2, SERAC1, SLC19A3, SLC25A12, TAZ, TMEM126B, VARS2) were identified. The ACAD9, CLPB, FBXL4, PDHA1 genes recurred more than twice suggesting higher general/ethnic prevalence. In 19 cases, variants in 18 non-MD related genes (ADAR, CACNA1A, CDKL5, CLN3, CPS1, DMD, DYSF, GBE1, GFAP, HSD17B4, MECP2, MYBPC3, PEX5, PGAP2, PIGN, PRF1, SBDS, SCN2A) were found. The percentage of positive WES results rose gradually with increasing probability of MD according to the Mitochondrial Disease Criteria (MDC) scale (from 36 to 90 % for low and high probability, respectively). The percentage of detected MD-related genes compared with non MD-related genes also grew with the increasing MD likelihood (from 20 to 97 %). Molecular diagnosis was established in 30/47 (63.8 %) neonates and in 17/28 (60.7 %) patients with basal ganglia involvement. Mutations in CLPB, SERAC1, TAZ genes were identified in neonates with 3-methylglutaconic aciduria (3-MGA) as a discriminative feature. New MD-related candidate gene (NDUFB8) is under verification.
We suggest WES rather than targeted NGS as the method of choice in diagnostics of MD in children, including neonates with 3-MGA aciduria, who died without determination of disease cause and with limited availability of laboratory data. There is a strong correlation between the degree of MD diagnosis by WES and MD likelihood expressed by the MDC scale.
Recently, increasing numbers of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), with both oncogenic and tumor-suppressive potential, have been found to be aberrantly expressed in various human cancers. However, the function of lncRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression remains largely unknown. In this study, we performed a comprehensive microarray analysis of lncRNA expression using human HCC specimens. After validation in 119 human HCC tissues, we identified a novel tumor suppressor lncRNA, CPS1 intronic transcript 1 (CPS1-IT1). To elucidate the clinical significance of CPS1-IT1 in HCC, correlations between CPS1-IT1 levels, clinical parameters, and survival outcomes were analyzed. In vitro and in vivo functional assays were also performed to dissect the potential underlying mechanisms. Expression of CPS1-IT1 was significantly decreased in 73% of HCC tissues, and patients with low CPS1-IT1 expression had poor survival outcomes. Furthermore, in vitro functional assays indicated that CPS1-IT1 significantly reduced cell proliferation, migration and invasion capacities through reduced Hsp90 binding to and activation of HIF-1α, thereby suppressing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). An in vivo animal model also demonstrated the tumor suppressor role of CPS1- IT1 via decreased tumor growth and metastasis. In conclusion, lncRNA CPS1-IT1 acts as a tumor suppressor in HCC by reducing HIF-1α activation and suppressing EMT. The findings of this study establish a function for CPS1-IT1 in HCC progression and suggest its potential as a new prognostic biomarker and target for HCC therapy.
It is well-known that the conversion of normal colon epithelium to adenoma and then to carcinoma stems from acquired molecular changes in the genome. The genetic basis of colorectal cancer has been elucidated to a certain extent, and much remains to be known about the identity of specific cancer genes that are associated with the advancement of colorectal cancer from one stage to the next. Here in this study we attempted to identify novel cancer genes that could underlie the stage-specific progression and metastasis of colorectal cancer. We conducted a stage-based meta-analysis of the voluminous tumor genome-sequencing data and mined using multiple approaches for novel genes driving the progression to stage-II, stage-III and stage-IV colorectal cancer. The consensus of these driver genes seeded the construction of stage-specific networks, which were then analyzed for the centrality of genes, clustering of subnetworks, and enrichment of gene-ontology processes. Our study identified three novel driver genes as hubs for stage-II progression: DYNC1H1, GRIN2A, GRM1. Four novel driver genes were identified as hubs for stage-III progression: IGF1R, CPS1, SPTA1, DSP. Three novel driver genes were identified as hubs for stage-IV progression: GSK3B, GGT1, EIF2B5. We also identified several non-driver genes that appeared to underscore the progression of colorectal cancer. Our study yielded potential diagnostic biomarkers for colorectal cancer as well as novel stage-specific drug targets for rational intervention. Our methodology is extendable to the analysis of other types of cancer to fill the gaps in our knowledge. 
The hepatocyte paraffin 1 (Hep Par 1) antibody is widely used as a hepatocyte marker, recognizing carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1), an essential component of the urea cycle. Various missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations occur in the CPS1 gene. In neonatal patients with homozygous CPS1 deficiency (CPS1D), urea cycle defects with resulting severe hyperammonemia can be fatal, though liver transplantation provides a complete cure for CPS1D. We performed Hep Par 1 immunostaining in the explanted livers of 10 liver transplant patients with CPS1D. Seven were negative for Hep Par 1 in the hepatocytes and the other three showed normal diffuse granular cytoplasmic staining. As expected, all three Hep Par 1-positive patients had at least one missense mutation, and all four patients who had only nonsense or frameshift mutations were Hep Par 1-negative. The other three patients were unexpectedly negative for Hep Par 1, even though each had one missense mutation. These results suggest that CPS1D can be related to the loss of Hep Par 1 reactivity due to the loss of protein production, a one amino acid substitution resulting in an abortive protein product, or both. Hep Par 1 immunohistochemistry can be used as a simple method to confirm CPS1D. 
A 59-year-old woman, with a medical history of intellectual disability after perinatal asphyxia, was admitted because of coma due to hyperammonemia after she was treated for a fracture of the pelvis. The ammonia level was 280 μM. Acquired disorders as explanation for the hyperammonemia were excluded. Metabolic investigations showed an elevated glutamine and alanine and low citrulline, suspect for a urea cycle defect (UCD). Orotic acid could not be demonstrated in urine. DNA investigations were negative for mutations or deletions in the OTC and CPS1 gene, but revealed a homozygous c.603G&gt;C mutation in exon 2 of the N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) gene (NM_153006.2:c.603G&gt;C), which mandates p.Lys201Asn. This is a novel mutation in the NAGS gene.After the diagnosis of NAGS deficiency was made carbamylglutamate was started in a low dose. In combination with mild protein restriction the ammonia level decreased to 26 μM.This is one of the first patients in literature in whom the diagnosis of a UCD is made at such an advanced age. It is important for the adult physician to consider a metabolic disorder at every age.
Excess ammonia is produced during fasting when amino acids are used for glucogenesis. Together with ureagenesis, glucogenesis occurs in periportal hepatocytes mediated mainly through the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α). In vivo experiments showed that fasting strongly stimulated mice glucagon secretion, hepatic PGC-1α, sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) and sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) expression and ureagenesis enzymatic activity such as carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) and ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC). Interestingly, (15)N-labeled urea and (13)C-labeled glucose production in wild-type mice were significantly increased compared with PGC-1α null mice by [(15)N,(13)C]alanine perfused liver. Glucagon significantly stimulated ureagenesis, expression of SIRT3, SIRT5 and the activities of CPS1 and OCT but did not stimulate PGC-1α silencing hepatocytes in mice periportal hepatocytes. Contrarily, PGC-1α overexpression significantly increased the expression of SIRT3, SIRT5 and the activities of CPS1 and OTC, but induced no significant changes in CPS1 and OTC expression. Morever, SIRT3 directly deacetylates and upregulates the activity of OTC, while SIRT5 deacetylates and stimulates the activity of CPS1. During fasting, PGC-1α facilitates ureagenesis in mouse periportal hepatocytes by deacetylating CPS1 and OTC modulated by mitochondrial deacetylase, SIRT3 and SIRT5. This mechanism may be relevant to ammonia detoxification and metabolic homeostasis in liver during fasting.
Weight loss success is dependent on the ability to refrain from regaining the lost weight in time. This feature was shown to be largely variable among individuals, and these differences, with their underlying molecular processes, are diverse and not completely elucidated. Altered plasma metabolites concentration could partly explain weight loss maintenance mechanisms. In the present work, a systems biology approach has been applied to investigate the potential mechanisms involved in weight loss maintenance within the Diogenes weight-loss intervention study.
A genome wide association study identified SNPs associated with plasma glycine levels within the CPS1 (Carbamoyl-Phosphate Synthase 1) gene (rs10206976, p-value = 4.709e-11 and rs12613336, p-value = 1.368e-08). Furthermore, gene expression in the adipose tissue showed that CPS1 expression levels were associated with successful weight maintenance and with several SNPs within CPS1 (cis-eQTL). In order to contextualize these results, a gene-metabolite interaction network of CPS1 and glycine has been built and analyzed, showing functional enrichment in genes involved in lipid metabolism and one carbon pool by folate pathways.
CPS1 is the rate-limiting enzyme for the urea cycle, catalyzing carbamoyl phosphate from ammonia and bicarbonate in the mitochondria. Glycine and CPS1 are connected through the one-carbon pool by the folate pathway and the urea cycle. Furthermore, glycine could be linked to metabolic health and insulin sensitivity through the betaine osmolyte. These considerations, and the results from the present study, highlight a possible role of CPS1 and related pathways in weight loss maintenance, suggesting that it might be partly genetically determined in humans.
The small intestine is the exclusive site of arginine synthesis in neonates. Low levels of circulating arginine have been associated with the occurrence of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) but the mechanism of arginine dysregulation has not been fully elucidated. We aimed to investigate (i) expressional changes of arginine synthesizing and catabolic enzymes in human intestinal tissues of NEC, spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP) and noninflammatory surgical conditions (Surg-CTL) and to investigate the (ii) mechanisms of arginine dysregulation and enterocyte proliferation upon stimulation by bacterial components, arginine depletion, ARG1 overexpression and nitric oxide (NO) supplementation. Our results showed that expressions of arginine synthesizing enzymes ALDH18A1, ASL, ASS1, CPS1, GLS, OAT and PRODH were significantly decreased in NEC compared with Surg-CTL or SIP tissues. Catabolic enzyme ARG1 was increased (&gt;100-fold) in NEC tissues and histologically demonstrated to be expressed by infiltrating neutrophils. No change in arginine metabolic enzymes was observed between SIP and Surg-CTL tissues. In CaCO2 cells, arginine metabolic enzymes were differentially dysregulated by lipopolysaccharide or lipoteichoic acid. Depletion of arginine reduced cell proliferation and this phenomenon could be partially rescued by NO. Overexpression of ARG1 also reduced enterocyte proliferation. We provided the first expressional profile of arginine metabolic enzymes at the tissue level of NEC. Our findings suggested that arginine homeostasis was severely disturbed and could be triggered by inflammatory responses of enterocytes and infiltrating neutrophils as well as bacterial components. Such reactions could reduce arginine and NO, resulting in mucosal damage. The benefit of arginine supplementation for NEC prophylaxis merits further clinical evaluation. 
An accurate way to characterize the functional potential of a protein is to analyze recognized protein domains encoded by the genes in a given group. The epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) domain is an evolutionarily conserved protein module found primarily in proteins that participate in clathrin-mediated trafficking. In this work, we investigate the function of the single ENTH-containing protein from the protist Giardia lamblia by testing its function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This protein, named GlENTHp (for G. lamblia ENTH protein), is involved in Giardia in endocytosis and in protein trafficking from the ER to the vacuoles, fulfilling the function of the ENTH proteins epsin and epsinR, respectively. There are two orthologs of epsin, Ent1p and Ent2p, and two orthologs of epsinR, Ent3p and Ent5p in S. cerevisiae. Although the expression of GlENTHp neither complemented growth in the ent1Δent2Δ mutant nor restored the GFP-Cps1 vacuolar trafficking defect in ent3Δent5Δ, it interfered with the normal function of Ent3/5 in the wild-type strain. The phenotype observed is linked to a defect in Cps1 localization and α-factor mating pheromone maturation. The finding that GlENTHp acts as dominant negative epsinR in yeast cells reinforces the phylogenetic data showing that GlENTHp belongs to the epsinR subfamily present in eukaryotes prior to their evolution into different taxa. 
Metabolites derived from dietary choline and L-carnitine, such as trimethylamine N-oxide and betaine, have recently been identified as novel risk factors for atherosclerosis in mice and humans. We sought to identify genetic factors associated with plasma betaine levels and determine their effect on risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). A two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified two significantly associated loci on chromosomes 2q34 and 5q14.1. The lead variant on 2q24 (rs715) localizes to carbamoyl-phosphate synthase 1 (CPS1), which encodes a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyses the first committed reaction and rate-limiting step in the urea cycle. Rs715 is also significantly associated with decreased levels of urea cycle metabolites and increased plasma glycine levels. Notably, rs715 yield a strikingly significant and protective association with decreased risk of CAD in only women. These results suggest that glycine metabolism and/or the urea cycle represent potentially novel sex-specific mechanisms for the development of atherosclerosis. 
Human carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPS1), a 1500-residue multidomain enzyme, catalyzes the first step of ammonia detoxification to urea requiring N-acetyl-L-glutamate (NAG) as essential activator to prevent ammonia/amino acids depletion. Here we present the crystal structures of CPS1 in the absence and in the presence of NAG, clarifying the on/off-switching of the urea cycle by NAG. By binding at the C-terminal domain of CPS1, NAG triggers long-range conformational changes affecting the two distant phosphorylation domains. These changes, concerted with the binding of nucleotides, result in a dramatic remodeling that stabilizes the catalytically competent conformation and the building of the ~35 Å-long tunnel that allows migration of the carbamate intermediate from its site of formation to the second phosphorylation site, where carbamoyl phosphate is produced. These structures allow rationalizing the effects of mutations found in patients with CPS1 deficiency (presenting hyperammonemia, mental retardation and even death), as exemplified here for some mutations. 
Liver mitochondria affected by drugs can be released into circulation and serve as biomarkers for drug-induced liver injury (DILI). The tissue specificity of ALT was improved by differentiating cytosolic ALT1 and mitochondrial ALT2 isoforms released in circulation. Prior to ALT elevation, mitochondrial cytochrome c, OCT, GLDH, CPS1 and DNA were increased in circulation following DILI. The baseline expression of mt-Nd6 was predictive of individual DILI susceptibility in animals. As mitochondrial DILI biomarkers appeared to be drug or species dependent, they might have value in clinical scenarios when culprit drugs are established, but may not be ideal tools to assess DILI potentials of new drugs. 
The mechanisms leading to high rates of malignancy and recurrence of human intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) remain unclear. It is difficult to diagnose and assess the prognosis of patients with ICC in the clinic due to the lack of specific biomarkers. In addition, long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to serve important roles in certain types of tumorigenesis however a role in ICC remains to be reported. The aim of the current study was to screen for genes and lncRNAs that are abnormally expressed in ICC and to investigate their biological and clinicopathological significance in ICC. The global gene and lncRNA expression profiles in ICC were measured using bioinformatics analysis. Carbamoyl‑phosphate synthase 1 (CPS1) and its lncRNA CPS1 intronic transcript 1 (CPS1‑IT1) were observed to be upregulated in ICC. The expression of CPS1 and CPS1‑IT1 was measured in 31 tissue samples from patients with ICC and a number of cell lines. The effects of CPS1 and CPS1‑IT1 on the proliferation and apoptosis of the ICC‑9810 cell line were measured. In addition, the clinicopathological features and survival rates of patients with ICC with respect to the gene and lncRNA expression status were analyzed. CPS1 and CPS1‑IT1 were co‑upregulated in ICC tissues compared with non‑cancerous tissues. Knockdown of CPS1 andor CPS1‑IT1 reduced the proliferation and increased the apoptosis of ICC‑9810 cells. Additionally, clinical analysis indicated that CPS1 and CPS1‑IT1 were associated with poor liver function and reduced survival rates when the relative expression values were greater than 4 in cancer tissues. The comparisons between the high CPS1 expression group and the low expression group indicated significant differences in international normalized ratio (P=0.048), total protein (P=0.049), indirect bilirubin (P=0.025), alkaline phosphatase (P=0.003) and disease‑free survival (P=0.034). In addition, there were differential trends in CA19‑9 (P=0.068), globulin (P=0.052) and total bilirubin (P=0.066). The comparisons between the high CPS1‑IT1 expression group and the low expression group indicated significant differences in lymphatic invasion (P=0.045), carbohydrate antigen 19‑9 (P=0.044), disease‑free survival (P=0.026), and non‑significant differential trends in alkaline phosphatase were observed (P=0.085). In conclusion, CPS1 and CPS1‑IT1 may serve an important role in ICC development by promoting the proliferation of ICC cells. Furthermore, CPS1 and CPS1‑IT1 were associated with poor liver function and reduced survival rates. Thus, CPS1 and CPS1‑IT1 may be potential prognostic indicators for patients with ICC. 
The objective of this study was to investigate the multiple relations between the preliminary molecular structural characteristics and antioxidant activities of polysaccharides from Canarium album (Lour.) Raeusch (CPS). Three polysaccharide fractions, CPS1, CPS2, and CPS3, were isolated from CPS by column chromatography. CPS1 and CPS3 were mainly composed of neutral polysaccharides linked by α- and β-glycosidic linkages while CPS2 was pectin polysaccharides mainly linked by β-glycosidic linkages. According to the SEC-MALLS-RI system, the molecular weight of CPS1 was greater compared to CPS2 and CPS3, and the molecular weight and radius of CPS did not display positive correlation. The chain conformation analysis indicated CPS1 and CPS2 were typical highly branched polysaccharides while CPS3 existed as a globular shape in aqueous. Furthermore, the antioxidant activity of CPS2 was better than that of CPS3, while that of CPS1 was the weakest. The antioxidant activities of polysaccharide fractions were affected by their monosaccharide composition, glycosidic linkage, molecular weight, and chain conformation. This functional property was a result of a combination of multiple molecular structural factors. CPS2 was the major antioxidant component of CPS and it could be exploited as a valued antioxidant product.
The molecular structural characteristics, antioxidant activities, and structure-function relationships of polysaccharide fractions from Canarium album were first investigated in this study. The results provided background and practical knowledge for the deep-processed products of C. album with high added value. CPS2 was the major antioxidant component of CPS, which could be exploited as a valued antioxidant ingredient in food and pharmaceutical industries.
Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of ureagenesis presenting as life-threatening hyperammonemia. In this study, we present the main clinical features and biochemical and molecular data of six Malaysian patients with CPS1 deficiency. All the patients have neonatal-onset symptoms, initially diagnosed as infections before hyperammonemia was recognized. They have typical biochemical findings of hyperglutaminemia, hypocitrullinemia, and low to normal urinary excretion of orotate. One neonate succumbed to the first hyperammonemic decompensation. Five neonatal survivors received long-term treatment consisting of dietary protein restriction and ammonia-scavenging drugs. They have delayed neurocognitive development of varying severity. Genetic analysis revealed eight mutations in CPS1 gene, five of which were not previously reported. Five mutations were missense changes while another three were predicted to create premature stop codons. In silico analyses showed that these new mutations affected different CPS1 enzyme domains and were predicted to interrupt interactions at enzyme active sites, disturb local enzyme conformation, and destabilize assembly of intact enzyme complex.
All mutations are private except one mutation; p.Ile1254Phe was found in three unrelated families. Identification of a recurrent p.Ile1254Phe mutation suggests the presence of a common and unique mutation in our population. Our study also expands the mutational spectrum of the CPS1 gene.
Cryptococcus demonstrates predilection for invasion of the brain, but the mechanism by which Cryptococcus crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to cause brain invasion is largely unknown. In order for Cryptococcus to cross the BBB, there must be a way to either cross human brain microvascular endothelial cells, which are the main constitute of the BBB, or go in between tight junctions. Recent evidence of human brain microvascular endothelial cell responses to transcellular brain invasions includes membrane rearrangements, intracellular signaling pathways and cytoskeletal activations. Several Cryptococcal genes related to the traversal of BBB have been identified, including CPS1, ITR1a, ITR3c, PLB1, MPR1, FNX1 and RUB1. In addition, Cryptococcus neoformans-derived microvesicles may contribute to cryptococcal brain invasion. Paracellularly, Cryptococcus may traverse across BBB using either routes utilizing plasmin, ammonia or macrophages in a Trojan horse mechanism. 
The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a regulator of xenobiotic toxicity, is a member of the eukaryotic Per-Arnt-Sim domain protein family of transcription factors. Recent evidence identified a novel AhR DNA recognition sequence called the nonconsensus xenobiotic response element (NC-XRE). AhR binding to the NC-XRE in response to activation by the canonical ligand 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin resulted in concomitant recruitment of carbamoyl phosphate synthase 1 (CPS1) to the NC-XRE. Studies presented here demonstrate that CPS1 is a bona fide nuclear protein involved in homocitrullination (hcit), including a key lysine residue on histone H1 (H1K34hcit). H1K34hcit represents a hitherto unknown epigenetic mark implicated in enhanced gene expression of the peptidylarginine deiminase 2 gene, itself a chromatin-modifying protein. Collectively, our data suggest that AhR activation promotes CPS1 recruitment to DNA enhancer sites in the genome, resulting in a specific enzyme-independent post-translational modification of the linker histone H1 protein (H1K34hcit), pivotal in altering local chromatin structure and transcriptional activation. 
In this study, 796 male Duroc pigs were used to identify genomic regions controlling growth traits. Three production traits were studied: food conversion ratio, days to 100 KG, and average daily gain, using a panel of 39,436 single nucleotide polymorphisms. In total, we detected 11 genome-wide and 162 chromosome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism trait associations. The Gene ontology analysis identified 14 candidate genes close to significant single nucleotide polymorphisms, with growth-related functions: six for days to 100 KG (WT1, FBXO3, DOCK7, PPP3CA, AGPAT9, and NKX6-1), seven for food conversion ratio (MAP2, TBX15, IVL, ARL15, CPS1, VWC2L, and VAV3), and one for average daily gain (COL27A1). Gene ontology analysis indicated that most of the candidate genes are involved in muscle, fat, bone or nervous system development, nutrient absorption, and metabolism, which are all either directly or indirectly related to growth traits in pigs. Additionally, we found four haplotype blocks composed of suggestive single nucleotide polymorphisms located in the growth trait-related quantitative trait loci and further narrowed down the ranges, the largest of which decreased by ~60 Mb. Hence, our results could be used to improve pig production traits by increasing the frequency of favorable alleles via artificial selection. 
Genome-wide association studies with metabolic traits (mGWAS) uncovered many genetic variants that influence human metabolism. These genetically influenced metabotypes (GIMs) contribute to our metabolic individuality, our capacity to respond to environmental challenges, and our susceptibility to specific diseases. While metabolic homeostasis in blood is a well investigated topic in large mGWAS with over 150 known loci, metabolic detoxification through urinary excretion has only been addressed by few small mGWAS with only 11 associated loci so far. Here we report the largest mGWAS to date, combining targeted and non-targeted 1H NMR analysis of urine samples from 3,861 participants of the SHIP-0 cohort and 1,691 subjects of the KORA F4 cohort. We identified and replicated 22 loci with significant associations with urinary traits, 15 of which are new (HIBCH, CPS1, AGXT, XYLB, TKT, ETNPPL, SLC6A19, DMGDH, SLC36A2, GLDC, SLC6A13, ACSM3, SLC5A11, PNMT, SLC13A3). Two-thirds of the urinary loci also have a metabolite association in blood. For all but one of the 6 loci where significant associations target the same metabolite in blood and urine, the genetic effects have the same direction in both fluids. In contrast, for the SLC5A11 locus, we found increased levels of myo-inositol in urine whereas mGWAS in blood reported decreased levels for the same genetic variant. This might indicate less effective re-absorption of myo-inositol in the kidneys of carriers. In summary, our study more than doubles the number of known loci that influence urinary phenotypes. It thus allows novel insights into the relationship between blood homeostasis and its regulation through excretion. The newly discovered loci also include variants previously linked to chronic kidney disease (CPS1, SLC6A13), pulmonary hypertension (CPS1), and ischemic stroke (XYLB). By establishing connections from gene to disease via metabolic traits our results provide novel hypotheses about molecular mechanisms involved in the etiology of diseases. 
Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are a group of phytotoxins that can induce human liver injury, particularly hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (HSOS). To date, the molecular targets of PA-induced HSOS are largely unknown. In this study, retrorsine (RTS), a known hepatotoxic PA, was used as a representative PA for proteomic studies. Toxicological assessment demonstrated that 35 mg/kg RTS (designated as RTS-L) caused early lesions of HSOS at 24 h after dosing. A proteomic approach revealed 17 up-regulated and 31 down-regulated proteins in RTS-L-treated rats. Subsequently, bioinformatic analysis suggested that two proteins, carbamoyl-phosphate synthase (CPS1) (p &lt; 0.05) and ATP synthase subunit beta (ATP5B) (p &lt; 0.01) were associated with RTS-L intoxication. Using immunohistochemical staining, we further verified the down-regulation of CPS1 and ATP5B in RTS-L-treated rats. These findings indicated that CPS1 and ATP5B were altered in the RTS-induced early lesions of HSOS in rats, and therefore, these two proteins and their involved pathways might play important roles in the initiation of HSOS. To the best of our knowledge, our study using a proteomic approach combined with conventional toxicological assessment is the first systems toxicology study on PA-induced HSOS. The results of this study provide novel findings on protein profiles in response to PA exposure, which can serve as a starting point to further investigate potential protein targets and their interactions with PAs to induce HSOS. 
To investigate the transdifferentiation relationship between eight types of liver cell during rat liver regeneration (LR).
114 healthy Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were used in this experimental study. Eight types of liver cell were isolated and purified with percoll density gradient centrifugation and immunomagentic bead methods. Marker genes for eight types of cell were obtained by retrieving the relevant references and databases. Expression changes of markers for each cell of the eight cell types were measured using microarray. The relationships between the expression profiles of marker genes and transdifferentiation among liver cells were analyzed using bioinformatics. Liver cell transdifferentiation was predicted by comparing expression profiles of marker genes in different liver cells.
During LR hepatocytes (HCs) not only express hepatic oval cells (HOC) markers (including PROM1, KRT14 and LY6E), but also express biliary epithelial cell (BEC) markers (including KRT7 and KRT19); BECs express both HOC markers (including GABRP, PCNA and THY1) and HC markers such as CPS1, TAT, KRT8 and KRT18; both HC markers (KRT18, KRT8 and WT1) and BEC markers (KRT7 and KRT19) were detected in HOCs. Additionally, some HC markers were also significantly upregulated in hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs), sinusoidal endothelial cells (SECs) , Kupffer cells (KCs) and dendritic cells (DCs), mainly at 6-72 hours post partial hepatectomy (PH).
Our findings indicate that there is a mutual transdifferentiation relationship between HC, BEC and HOC during LR, and a tendency for HSCs, SECs, KCs and DCs to transdifferentiate into HCs.
Perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA) is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant known to cause hepatocellular hypertrophy; however, the mechanisms of hepatotoxicity remain poorly understood. In this study, male rats were exposed to 0, 0.05, 0.2 and 0.5 mg/kg/day of PFDoA for 110 days. After two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis, 73 differentially expressed proteins involved in lipid metabolism, inflammation, stress response and other functions were successfully identified. Among them, six significantly changed proteins (CTE1, MTE1, HADHA, ECH1, ALDH2 and CPS1) were found to be regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα). The anti-oxidant enzyme activity assays of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase and the content of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances in the liver implied that PFDoA caused oxidative stress. The mRNA levels of PPARα in rat primary hepatocytes were knocked down by lentivirus-mediated RNAi. Furthermore, targeted protein levels of CTE1 and MTE1 were down-regulated, while those of HADHA, ALDH2 and CPS1 were up-regulated. After PFDoA exposure, however, the targeted protein levels of CTE1 and ALDH2 increased compared with those of the knockdown untreated group. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) content in rat hepatocytes assayed by flow cytometry significantly increased in the PPARα knockdown groups, consistent with the PPARα antagonist GW6471- and agonist WY14643-treated groups. These results strongly suggested that PPARα played an important role in suppressing ROS content in hepatocytes following PFDoA exposure. 
Although metabolism is profoundly altered in human liver cancer, the extent to which experimental models, e.g. cell lines, mimic those alterations is unresolved. Here, we aimed to determine the resemblance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines to human liver tumours, specifically in the expression of deregulated metabolic targets in clinical tissue samples.
We compared the overall gene expression profile of poorly-differentiated (HLE, HLF, SNU-449) to well-differentiated (HUH7, HEPG2, HEP3B) HCC cell lines in three publicly available microarray datasets. Three thousand and eighty-five differentially expressed genes in ≥2 datasets (P &lt; 0.05) were used for pathway enrichment and gene ontology (GO) analyses. Further, we compared the topmost gene expression, pathways, and GO from poorly differentiated cell lines to the pattern from four human HCC datasets (623 tumour tissues). In well- versus poorly differentiated cell lines, and in representative models HLE and HUH7 cells, we specifically assessed the expression pattern of 634 consistently deregulated metabolic genes in human HCC. These data were complemented by quantitative PCR, proteomics, metabolomics and assessment of response to thirteen metabolism-targeting compounds in HLE versus HUH7 cells.
We found that poorly-differentiated HCC cells display upregulated MAPK/RAS/NFkB signaling, focal adhesion, and downregulated complement/coagulation cascade, PPAR-signaling, among pathway alterations seen in clinical tumour datasets. In HLE cells, 148 downregulated metabolic genes in liver tumours also showed low gene/protein expression - notably in fatty acid β-oxidation (e.g. ACAA1/2, ACADSB, HADH), urea cycle (e.g. CPS1, ARG1, ASL), molecule transport (e.g. SLC2A2, SLC7A1, SLC25A15/20), and amino acid metabolism (e.g. PHGDH, PSAT1, GOT1, GLUD1). In contrast, HUH7 cells showed a higher expression of 98 metabolic targets upregulated in tumours (e.g. HK2, PKM, PSPH, GLUL, ASNS, and fatty acid synthesis enzymes ACLY, FASN). Metabolomics revealed that the genomic portrait of HLE cells co-exist with profound reliance on glutamine to fuel tricarboxylic acid cycle, whereas HUH7 cells use both glucose and glutamine. Targeting glutamine pathway selectively suppressed the proliferation of HLE cells.
We report a yet unappreciated distinct expression pattern of clinically-relevant metabolic genes in HCC cell lines, which could enable the identification and therapeutic targeting of metabolic vulnerabilities at various liver cancer stages.
Plant growth and development are highly coordinated by hormones, including brassinosteroid (BR) and gibberellin (GA). Although much progress has been made in understanding the fundamental signaling transduction in BR and GA, their relationship remains elusive in rice. Here, we show that BR suppresses the level of OsmiR159d, which cleaves the target OsGAMYBL2 gene. The OsmiR159d-OsGAMYBL2 pair functions as an early BR-responsive module regulating the expression of BU1, a BR-regulated gene involved in BR signaling, and CPS1 and GA3ox2, two genes in GA biosynthesis, by binding to the promoters of these genes. Furthermore, OsGSK2, a key negative player in BR signaling, interacts with OsGAMYBL2 and prevents it from being degraded under 24-epibrassinolide treatment, whereas SLR1, a rice DELLA protein negatively regulating GA signaling, interacts with OsGAMYBL2 and prevents OsGAMYBL2 from binding to the target gene promoter. GA signaling induces degradation of OsGAMYBL2 and, consequently, enhances BR signaling. These results demonstrate that a BR-responsive module acts as a common component functioning in both BR and GA pathways, which connects BR signaling and GA biosynthesis, and thus coordinates the regulation of BR and GA in plant growth and development.
In non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the function of urea cycle enzymes (UCEs) may be affected, resulting in hyperammonemia and the risk of disease progression. We aimed to determine whether the expression and function of UCEs are altered in an animal model of NASH and in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and whether this process is reversible.
Rats were first fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet for 10 months to induce NASH, before being switched onto a normal chow diet to recover. In humans, we obtained liver biopsies from 20 patients with steatosis and 15 with NASH. Primary rat hepatocytes were isolated and cultured with free fatty acids. We measured the gene and protein expression of ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) and carbamoylphosphate synthetase (CPS1), as well as OTC activity, and ammonia concentrations. Moreover, we assessed the promoter methylation status of OTC and CPS1 in rats, humans and steatotic hepatocytes.
In NASH animals, gene and protein expression of OTC and CPS1, and the activity of OTC, were reversibly reduced. Hypermethylation of Otc promoter genes was also observed. Additionally, in patients with NAFLD, OTC enzyme concentration and activity were reduced and ammonia concentrations were increased, which was further exacerbated in those with NASH. Furthermore, OTC and CPS1 promoter regions were hypermethylated. In primary hepatocytes, induction of steatosis was associated with Otc promoter hypermethylation, a reduction in the gene expression of Otc and Cps1, and an increase in ammonia concentration in the supernatant.
NASH is associated with a reduction in the gene and protein expression, and activity, of UCEs. This results in hyperammonemia, possibly through hypermethylation of UCE genes and impairment of urea synthesis. Our investigations are the first to describe a link between NASH, the function of UCEs, and hyperammonemia, providing a novel therapeutic target.
In patients with fatty liver disease, the enzymes that convert nitrogen waste into urea may be affected, leading to the accumulation of ammonia, which is toxic. This accumulation of ammonia can lead to scar tissue development, increasing the risk of disease progression. In this study, we show that fat accumulation in the liver produces a reversible reduction in the function of the enzymes that are involved in detoxification of ammonia. These data provide potential new targets for the treatment of fatty liver disease.
Acquired resistance (AR) to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) is a major issue worldwide, for both patients and healthcare providers. However, precise prediction is currently infeasible due to the lack of an appropriate model. This study was conducted to develop and validate an individualized prediction model for automated detection of acquired EGFR-TKI resistance.
Penalized regression was applied to construct a predictive model using publically available genomic cohorts of acquired EGFR-TKI resistance. To develop a model with enhanced generalizability, we merged multiple cohorts then updated the learning parameter via robust cross-study validation. Model performance was evaluated mainly using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.
Using a multi-study-derived machine learning method, we developed an extremely parsimonious model with generalized predictors (DDK3, CPS1, MOB3B, KRT6A), which has excellent prediction performance on blind cohorts for AR to EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib) and monoclonal antibody against EGFR (cetuximab). In addition, our model also showed high performance for predicting intrinsic resistance (IR) to EGFR-TKIs from two large-scale pharmacogenomic resources, the Cancer Genome Project and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, suggesting that these general predictive features may work across AR and IR.
We successfully constructed a multi-study-derived prediction model for acquired EGFR-TKI resistance with excellent accuracy, generalizability and transferability.
Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) is a urea cycle enzyme that forms carbamoyl phosphate from bicarbonate, ammonia and ATP. Bi-allelic mutations of the CPS1 gene result in a urea cycle disorder presenting with hyperammonemia, often with reduced citrulline, and without orotic aciduria. CPS1 deficiency is particularly challenging to treat and lack of early recognition typically results in early neonatal death. Therapeutic interventions have limited efficacy and most patients develop long-term neurologic sequelae. Using transgenic techniques, we generated a conditional Cps1 knockout mouse. By loxP/Cre recombinase technology, deletion of the Cps1 locus was achieved in adult transgenic animals using a Cre recombinase-expressing adeno-associated viral vector. Within four weeks from vector injection, all animals developed hyperammonemia without orotic aciduria and died. Minimal CPS1 protein was detectable in livers. To investigate the efficacy of gene therapy for CPS deficiency following knock-down of hepatic endogenous CPS1 expression, we injected these mice with a helper-dependent adenoviral vector (HDAd) expressing the large murine CPS1 cDNA under control of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase promoter. Liver-directed HDAd-mediated gene therapy resulted in survival, normalization of plasma ammonia and glutamine, and 13% of normal Cps1 expression. A gender difference in survival suggests that female mice may require higher hepatic CPS1 expression. We conclude that this conditional murine model recapitulates the clinical and biochemical phenotype detected in human patients with CPS1 deficiency and will be useful to investigate ammonia-mediated neurotoxicity and for the development of cell- and gene-based therapeutic approaches.
This study was aimed at identifying genetic and non-genetic risk factors for valproic acid (VPA)-induced hyperammonaemia in Chinese paediatric patients with epilepsy. A total of 210 epileptic patients, treated with VPA as monotherapy, were enrolled and classified into hyperammonaemia and control groups according to their blood ammonia level (cut-off value 50 μmol/L). Serum concentrations of VPA and its major metabolites were simultaneously determined by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms in the candidate genes, CYP2C9, CYP2A6, CYP2B6 and CPS1, were analysed by a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry method or nested PCR. Significant differences in age, aspartate transaminase level and the incidence of liver injury were observed between patients of hyperammonaemia and control groups. Genotype distributions of CYP2C9*3, CYP2A6*4 and CPS1 4217C&gt;A allelic variants were also significantly different between the two groups. According to multiple regression analysis, a significant negative correlation was detected between age and the blood ammonia level, while liver injury, the concentration-dose ratio (CDR) of VPA and 2-propyl-4-pentenoic acid (4-ene VPA), and the presence of CYP2A6*4 or CPS1 4217C&gt;A showed positive correlations with the blood ammonia level. In addition, the risk factors for hyperammonaemia identified by logistic regression analysis were as follows: a younger age (odds ratio [OR] = 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.76-0.96; p = 0.007), occurrence of liver injury (OR = 4.60; 95% CI = 1.27-16.74; p = 0.021), higher CDR of 4-ene VPA (OR = 1.08; 95% CI = 1.03-1.14; p = 0.001), and carrying mutant alleles of CYP2C9*3 (OR = 3.42; 95% CI = 1.15-10.19; p = 0.028), CYP2A6*4 (OR = 3.23; 95% CI = 1.40-7.48; p = 0.006) and CPS1 4217C&gt;A (OR = 3.25; 95% CI = 1.52-6.94; p = 0.002). Our findings indicated that multiple genetic and non-genetic risk factors that were identified can be used to predict the development of VPA-induced hyperammonaemia in Chinese paediatric patients with epilepsy.
Antibiotics and vaccines have greatly impacted human health in the last century by dramatically reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with infectious diseases. The recent challenge posed by the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria could possibly be addressed by novel immune prophylactic and therapeutic approaches. Among the newly threatening pathogens, Klebsiella pneumoniae is particularly worrisome in the nosocomial setting, and its surface polysaccharides are regarded as promising antigen candidates. The majority of Klebsiella carbapenem-resistant strains belong to the sequence type 158 (ST258) lineage, with two main clades expressing capsular polysaccharides CPS1 and CPS2. In a recent article, S. D. Kobayashi and colleagues (mBio 9:e00297-18, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.00297-18) show that CPS2-specific IgGs render ST258 clade 2 bacteria more sensitive to human serum and phagocytic killing. E. Diago-Navarro et al. (mBio 9:e00091-18, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.00091-18) generated two murine monoclonal antibodies recognizing distinct glycotopes of CPS2 that presented functional activity against multiple ST258 strains. These complementary studies represent a step toward the control of this dangerous pathogen.
Mammalian neonates undergo rapid transitions from a sterile uterine environment with a continuous intravenous supply of nutrients to a microbe-rich environment with intermittent ingesting of colostrum/milk via the gut. Currently, little is known about the colostrum-induced alterations of intestinal mucosal proteins in piglets with intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). In this study, we sought to investigate the innate differences and effects of colostrum on alterations in small-intestinal proteomes of IUGR piglets. Two IUGR (approximately 0·9 kg) and two normal-birth weight (NBW; approximately 1·3 kg) piglets were obtained from each of six sows at birth. One half (n 12; 6 IUGR v. 6 NBW) of the selected newborn piglets were killed to obtain jejunum samples, and the other half (n 12; 6 IUGR v. 6 NBW) of the newborn piglets were allowed to suckle colostrum from their own mothers for 24 h before jejunum sample collection. On the basis of proteomic analysis, we identified thirty-one differentially expressed proteins in the jejunal mucosa between IUGR and normal neonates before or after colostrum consumption. The intestinal proteins altered by colostrum feeding play important roles in the following: (1) increasing intestinal integrity, transport of nutrients, energy metabolism, protein synthesis, immune response and, therefore, cell proliferation; and (2) decreasing oxidative stress, and therefore cell apoptosis, in IUGR neonates. However, colostrum only partially ameliorated the inferior status of the jejunal mucosa in IUGR neonates. These findings provide the first evidence in intestinal protein alterations of IUGR neonates in response to colostrum ingestion, and thus render new insights into the mechanisms responsible for impaired growth in IUGR neonates and into new nutritional intervention strategies.
V. vulnificus is a Gram-negative bacterium, commonly found in estuarine and coastal habitats, that can infect humans through seafood consumption or wound exposure. This study represents the first attempt to correlate the genotype of Vibrio vulnificus strains isolated in the north-western Adriatic Sea coastal area, with their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. On the whole, 40 V. vulnificus strains, isolated from shellfish (n=20), different coastal water bodies (n=19), and the blood of a Carretta carretta turtle (n=1), were utilized. All strains were positive for the species-specific genes vvhA and hsp, with high variability for other markers: 55% (22 out of 40) resulted of the environmental (E) genotype (vcgE, 16S rRNA type A, CPS2 or CPS0), 10% (4 out of 40) of the clinical (C) genotype (vcgC, 16S rRNA type B, CPS1), and 35% (14 out of 40) of the mixed (M) genotype, possessing both E and C markers. The antimicrobial susceptibility was assayed by the diffusion method on agar, according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), utilizing the following commercial disks (Oxoid): ampicillin (AMP), ampicillin- sulbactam (SAM), piperacillin (PRL), cefazolin (KZ), cefotaxime(CTX), ceftazidime (CAZ), imipenem (IPM), meropenem (MEM), amikacin (AK), gentamicin(CN), tetracycline(TE), ciprofloxacin (CIP), levofloxacin (LEV), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), and chloramphenicol (C). 75% of the strains, (n=30) including all C strains, was sensitive to all the tested antibiotics, whereas E strains showed intermediate sensitivity to AK (2 strains), CIP and CAZ (1 strain), TE (1 strain) and resistance to KZ (1 strain), and 4 M strains showed I to AK.
Next to applications in fermentations, Lactobacillus plantarum is recognized as a food spoilage organism, and its dispersal from biofilms in food processing environments might be implicated in contamination or recontamination of food products. This study provides new insights into biofilm development by L. plantarum WCFS1 through comparative analysis of wild type and mutants affected in cell surface composition, including mutants deficient in the production of Sortase A involved in the covalent attachment of 27 predicted surface proteins to the cell wall peptidoglycan (ΔsrtA) and mutants deficient in the production of capsular polysaccharides (CPS1-4, Δcps1-4). Surface adhesion and biofilm formation studies revealed none of the imposed cell surface modifications to affect the initial attachment of cells to polystyrene while biofilm formation based on Crystal Violet (CV) staining was severely reduced in the ΔsrtA mutant and significantly increased in mutants lacking the cps1 cluster, compared to the wild-type strain. Fluorescence microscopy analysis of biofilm samples pointed to a higher presence of extracellular DNA (eDNA) in cps1 mutants and this corresponded with increased autolysis activity. Subsequent studies using Δacm2 and ΔlytA derivatives affected in lytic behaviour revealed reduced biofilm formation measured by CV staining, confirming the relevance of lysis for the build-up of the biofilm matrix with eDNA.
Cdc48/p97 and the ubiquilin family of UBA-UBL proteins are known for their role in the retrotranslocation of damaged proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum. We demonstrate that Cdc48 and the ubiquilin-like proteins in yeast also play a role in the anterograde trafficking of proteins, in this case the vacuolar protease, Cps1.
Ammonia is a toxic by-product of protein catabolism and is involved in changes in glutamate metabolism. Therefore, ammonia metabolism genes may link a range of diseases involving glutamate signaling such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and type 2 diabetes (T2D). We analyzed data from a National Institute on Aging study with a family-based design to determine if 45 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in glutaminase (GLS), carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1), or glutamate-ammonia ligase (GLUL) genes were associated with AD, MDD, or T2D using PLINK software. HAPLOVIEW software was used to calculate linkage disequilibrium measures for the SNPs. Next, we analyzed the associated variations for potential effects on transcriptional control sites to identify possible functional effects of the SNPs. Of the SNPs that passed the quality control tests, four SNPs in the GLS gene were significantly associated with AD, two SNPs in the GLS gene were associated with T2D, and one SNP in the GLUL gene and three SNPs in the CPS1 gene were associated with MDD before Bonferroni correction. The in silico bioinformatic analysis suggested probable functional roles for six associated SNPs. Glutamate signaling pathways have been implicated in all these diseases, and other studies have detected similar brain pathologies such as cortical thinning in AD, MDD, and T2D. Taken together, these data potentially link GLS with AD, GLS with T2D, and CPS1 and GLUL with MDD and stimulate the generation of testable hypotheses that may help explain the molecular basis of pathologies shared by these disorders.
Urea cycle disorders (UCDs) result from genetic mutations that cause defects in any of the five enzymes of the urea cycle in the liver: carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1), ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS), argininosuccinate lyase, and arginase; in the co-factor producer N-acetyl glutamate synthetase; or in the ornithine transporter and citrin. The estimated incidence of UCDs ranges from one in 22,179 births to one in 53,717 births. The most recent estimate of incidence of UCDs for the US is around one in 35,000 births. It is estimated that approximately 11 new cases of UCDs will be diagnosed each year in Canada. The incidence of OTC deficiency (one in 56,500 live births) is higher than other UCDs. Deficiencies in the urea cycle may result in excessive ammonia levels due to impaired metabolism, which can be life-threatening and result in permanent neurological damage if left untreated. Treatment should be initiated as soon as a diagnosis of a UCD is suspected and should proceed simultaneously with the diagnostic evaluation. The goals of long-term management of UCDs are to achieve normal development, to prevent hyperammonemia, and to maintain a good quality of life (QoL). These are achieved through a low-protein diet (and sometimes essential amino acids and other essential nutrients supplementation), pharmacotherapies to increase waste nitrogen excretion, and liver transplantation in selected patients. Sodium phenylbutyrate (NaPBA) is the mainstay of pharmacological therapy in chronic management of UCDs; however, its use is associated with decreased appetite, taste disturbances, body odour and menstrual dysfunction/amenorrhea. More recently, glycerol phenylbutyrate (GPB, brand name Ravicti) was approved as a nitrogen-scavenging therapy. This is a triglyceride containing three molecules of phenylbutyric acid. Its major metabolite, phenylacetic acid, conjugates with glutamine through acetylation in the liver and kidneys to form phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted by the kidneys. GPB is administered orally with a recommended total dose ranging from 4.5 mL/m2 per day to 11.2 mL/m2 per day (5.0 g/m2 per day to 12.4 g/m2 per day). For patients who have been previously treated with NaPBA, the total daily dose of GPB can be calculated based on the total daily dose of NaPBA. The objective of this systematic review is to examine the beneficial and harmful effects of GPB as a nitrogen-binding agent adjunctive to dietary protein restriction and dietary supplements for chronic management of adult and pediatric (at least two years of age) patients with UCDs.
Homocysteine (Hcy) is a heritable biomarker for CVD, peripheral artery disease, stroke, and dementia. Little is known about genetic associations with Hcy in individuals of African ancestry. We performed a genome-wide association study for Hcy in 4927 AAs from the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and the Coronary Artery Risk in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. Analyses were stratified by sex and results were meta-analyzed within and across sex. In the sex-combined meta-analysis, we observed genome-wide significant evidence (p &lt; 5.0 × 10-8) for the NOX4 locus (lead variant rs2289125, β = -0.15, p = 5.3 × 1011). While the NOX4 locus was previously reported as associated with Hcy in European-American populations, rs2289125 remained genome-wide significant when conditioned on the previously reported lead variants. Previously reported genome-wide significant associations at NOX4, MTR, CBS, and MMACHC were also nominally (p &lt; 0.050) replicated in AAs. Associations at the CPS1 locus, previously reported in females only, also was replicated specifically in females in this analysis, supporting sex-specific effects for this locus. These results suggest that there may be a combination of cross-population and population-specific genetic effects, as well as differences in genetic effects between males and females, in the regulation of Hcy levels.
Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 deficiency (CPS1D) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of the urea cycle, mostly characterized by hyperammonemia and the concomitant leukodystrophy. The onset of CPS1D can be at any age, and the clinical manifestations are variable and atypical. Genetic tests are indispensable for accurate diagnosis of CPS1D on the basis of biochemical tests.
Blood tandem mass spectrometric analysis and urea organic acidemia screening were performed on a Chinese neonatal patient with low activity, recurrent seizures, and hyperammonemia. Next-generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing were followed up for making a definite diagnosis. Bioinformatics tools were used for the conservation analysis and pathogenicity predictions of the identified mutations.
Increased lactate in urea and decreased citrulline in blood were detected in the patient. Two novel mutations (c.173G&gt;T, p.G58V in exon 2 and c.796G&gt;A, p.G266R in exon 8) in CPS1 identified in the neonatal patient were found through coseparation verification. Both of the two mutations were predicted to be deleterious, and the two relevant amino acids exerted highly evolutionarily conserved. The final diagnosis of the patient was compound heterozygous CPS1D.
This study described the specific clinical characteristics and the variations of physiological and biochemical indices in a Chinese neonatal patient with CPS1D, which facilitated the diagnosis and mechanism research of the disease. Two novel causative missense mutations were identified, which enriched the mutation spectrum of CPS1D in China and worldwide. Advice of prenatal diagnosis was given to the family for a new pregnancy.
Salvia miltiorrhiza (S. miltiorrhiza) and Salvia castanea Diels f. tomentosa (S. castanea) are both used for treatment of cardiovascular diseases. They have the same bioactive compound tanshinones, but whose contents are hugely different. This study illustrated diverse responses of tanshinone biosynthesis to yeast extract (YE) and Ag+ in hairy roots of the two species. YE enhanced both the growth and tanshinone biosynthesis of two hairy roots, and contributed more to tanshinone accumulation in S. castanea than that in S. miltiorrhiza. Genes encoding 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS2), geranylgeranyl diphosphatesynthase (GGPPS1), copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS1), and two cytochromes P450 (CYP76AH1 and CYP76AH3) were also more responsive to YE in S. castanea than those in S. miltiorrhiza. Accumulations of dihydrotanshinone I and tanshinone I, and most biosynthetic genes in S. miltiorrhiza were more responsive to Ag+ than those in S. castanea. Accumulations of dihydrotanshinone I and cryptotanshinone were more responsive to YE, while tanshinone IIA accumulation was more responsive to Ag+ in S. miltiorrhiza. However, accumulations of other four tanshinones and related genes in S. castanea were more responsive to YE than Ag+. This study provides foundations for studying diverse specialized metabolism between the related species.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a disease characterized by a steatosis of the liver that may progress to more serious pathological conditions including: nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, and cirrhosis. As the prevalence of NAFLD has increased worldwide in recent years, pathophysiology and risk factors associated with disease progression of NAFLD are at the focus of many studies. NAFLD is related to and shares common serum biomarkers with cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity, and metabolic syndrome (MetS). West Virginia (WV) is a state with some of the highest rates of CVD, obesity and diabetes mellitus. As NAFLD is closely related to these diseases, it is of particular interest in WV. Currently there is no cost-effective, standardized method used clinically to detect NAFLD prior to the onset of reversible complications. At this time, the diagnosis of NAFLD is made with costly radiologic studies and invasive biopsy. These studies are only diagnostic once changes to hepatic tissue have occurred. The diagnosis of NAFLD by traditional methods may not allow for successful intervention and may not be readily available in areas with already sparse medical resources. In this literature review, we identify a list of biomarkers common among CVD, T2DM, obesity, MetS and NAFLD. From this research we propose the following biomarkers are good candidates for inclusion in a panel of biomarkers for the early detection of NAFLD: adiponectin, AST, ALT, apo-B, CK18, CPS1, CRP, FABP-1, ferritin, GGT, GRP78, HDL-C, IGF-1, IL-1β, 6, 8, 10, IRS-2PAI-1, leptin, lumican, MDA SREBP-1c and TNF-α. Creating and implementing a biomarker panel for the early detection and attenuation of NAFLD, prior to the onset of irreversible complication would provide maximum benefit and decrease the disease burden on the patients and healthcare system of WV.
Increasing evidence demonstrates that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate diverse cellular processes and cancer progression. Whether lncRNAs play any functional role in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) remains largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of lncRNA CPS1 intronic transcript 1 (CPS1-IT1) in CRC.
Expression of CPS1-IT1 was initially assessed in human CRC tissues and in a series of CRC cell lines. The correlations between CPS1-IT1 levels and survival outcomes were analyzed to elucidate the clinical significance of CPS1-IT1 in CRC. The underlying mechanisms of CPS1-IT1 in CRC were analyzed through in vitro and in vivo functional assays.
Expression of CPS1-IT1 was significantly decreased in CRC tissues and cell lines, and patients with low CPS1-IT1 expression had poor survival outcomes. The results of in vitro assays revealed that CPS1-IT1 significantly reduced cell proliferation, migration and invasion capacities and accelerated cell apoptosis, thereby suppressing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). An in vivo animal model also demonstrated the tumor-suppressive role of CPS1-IT1.
In this study, we found that CPS1-IT1 has a tumor-suppressive role in CRC. Our data suggest that CPS1-IT1 could be used as a new prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for CRC.
Melatonin is the primary pineal hormone that relays light/dark cycle information to the circadian system. It was recently reported to exert intrinsic antitumor activity in various cancers. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying the antitumor activity of melatonin are poorly understood. Moreover, a limited number of studies have addressed the role of melatonin in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a major life-threatening malignancy in both sexes in Taiwan. In this study, we investigated the antitumor effects of melatonin in HCC and explored the regulatory mechanisms underlying these effects. We observed that melatonin significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells and significantly induced the expression of the transcription factor FOXA2 in HCC cells. This increase in FOXA2 expression resulted in upregulation of lncRNA-CPS1 intronic transcript 1 (CPS1-IT1), which reduced HIF-1α activity and consequently resulted in the suppression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression and HCC metastasis. Furthermore, the results of the in vivo experiments confirmed that melatonin exerts tumor suppressive effects by reducing tumor growth. In conclusion, our findings suggested that melatonin inhibited HCC progression by reducing lncRNA-CPS1-IT1-mediated EMT suppression and indicated that melatonin could be a promising treatment for HCC.
The phytohormone gibberellin (GA) plays essential roles in plant growth and development. Here, we report that OsINO80, a conserved ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling factor in rice (Oryza sativa), functions in both GA biosynthesis and diverse biological processes. OsINO80-knockdown mutants, derived from either T-DNA insertion or RNA interference, display typical GA-deficient phenotypes, including dwarfism, reduced cell length, late flowering, retarded seed germination and impaired reproductive development. Consistently, transcriptome analyses reveal that OsINO80 knockdown results in downregulation by more than two-fold of over 1,000 genes, including the GA biosynthesis genes CPS1 and GA3ox2, and the dwarf phenotype of OsINO80-knockdown mutants can be rescued by the application of exogenous GA3. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments show that OsINO80 directly binds to the chromatin of CPS1 and GA3ox2 loci. Biochemical assays establish that OsINO80 specially interacts with histone variant H2A.Z and the H2A.Z enrichments at CPS1 and GA3ox2 are decreased in OsINO80-knockdown mutants. Thus, our study identified a rice chromatin-remodeling factor, OsINO80, and demonstrated that OsINO80 is involved in regulation of the GA biosynthesis pathway and plays critical functions for many aspects of rice plant growth and development.
Hypoxia is a common phenomenon in solid tumor microenvironment. Thereby, the aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms of tumor metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulated by lncRNA CPS1 intronic transcript 1 (CPS1-IT1) under hypoxia in CRC.
Expression of lncRNA CPS1-IT1, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) and autophagy related protein (LC3) were initially assessed in human CRC tissues and in a series of CRC cell lines. The relationship of CPS1-IT1, HIF-1α and autophagy were analyzed in CRC were performed through in vitro and in vivo functional assays.
Expression of CPS1-IT1 were significantly reduced, while HIF-1α and LC3-II were increased in CRC tissues and cell lines. Then, in vitro assays revealed that CPS1-IT1 suppresses EMT and autophagy by inhibiting the activation of HIF-1α in CRC. An in vivo animal model also demonstrated the tumor suppressor mechanism of CPS1- IT1.
In this study, we found that hypoxia induce autophagy, and inhibition of autophagy could suppress tumor metastasis and EMT in CRC. Additionally, lncRNA CPS1-IT might suppresses metastasis and EMT by inhibiting hypoxia-induced autophagy through inactivation of HIF-1α in CRC.
Urea cycle disorders (UCDs) are genetic conditions characterized by nitrogen accumulation in the form of ammonia and caused by defects in the enzymes required to convert ammonia to urea for excretion. UCDs include a spectrum of enzyme deficiencies, namely n-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency (NAGS), carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency (CPS1), ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTC), argininosuccinate lyase deficiency (ASL), citrullinemia type I (ASS1), and argininemia (ARG). Currently, sodium phenylbutyrate and glycerol phenylbutyrate are primary medications used to treat patients with UCDs, and long-term monitoring of these compounds is critical for preventing drug toxic levels. Therefore, a fast and simple ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for quantification of phenylbutyrate (PB), phenylacetate (PA), and phenylacetylglutamine (PAG) in plasma and urine. The separation of all three analytes was achieved in 2min, and the limits of detection were &lt;0.04μg/ml. Intra-precision and inter-precision were &lt;8.5% and 4% at two quality control concentrations, respectively. Average recoveries for all compounds ranged from 100% to 106%. With the developed assay, a strong correlation between PA and the PA/PAG ratio and an inverse correlation between PA/PAG ratio and plasma glutamine were observed in 35 patients with confirmed UCDs. Moreover, all individuals with a ratio ≥0.6 had plasma glutamine levels&lt;1000μmol/l. Our data suggest that a PA/PAG ratio in the range of 0.6-1.5 will result in a plasma glutamine level&lt;1000μmol/l without reaching toxic levels of PA.
The aim of the present study was to explore the prognostic value of long non-coding RNA CPS1-IT1 (CPS1-IT1) expression in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients and identify the effect of CPS1-IT1 on cell proliferation and apoptosis of EOC cells.
Expression levels of CPS1-IT1 in tissues and cells were detected by the Real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay. The χ2-test was used to analyze the relationship between CPS1-IT1 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox's proportional hazards model. The capacity for cellular proliferation was measured with cell counting Kit-8. Cell apoptosis assays were performed using flow cytometry. Western blot was used to detect the expression levels of cell apoptosis-related proteins.
We observed that CPS1-IT1 was significantly downregulated in EOC cell lines and tissue samples. The expression of CPS1-IT1 was significantly associated with FIGO stage and lymph node metastases. In addition, EOC patients in the low tissue CPS1-IT1 expression group had significantly shorter 5-year overall survival time than those in the high tissue CPS1-IT1 expression group. Furthermore, univariate and multivariable Cox regression analysis identified low CPS1-IT1 expression in EOC tissues as an independent poor prognostic marker of overall survival. It was also found that over-expression of CPS1-IT1 markedly promoted proliferation of EOC cells. Further studies revealed that over-expression of CPS1-IT1 induced cell apoptosis by through regulating apoptosis-related proteins.
CPS1-IT1 may be a functional tumor suppressor in EOC. It may also serve as an independent prognostic factor for patients with EOC.
Administration of valproic acid (VPA) is complicated with approximately 0.9% of patients developing hyperammonemia, but the pathogenesis of this adverse effect remains to be clarified. The aim of the present study was to search for mechanisms associated with VPA-induced hyperammonemia in the light of changes in serum amino acids concentrations associated with the urea cycle of schizophrenic patients.
Blood samples (10 mL) were obtained from 37 schizophrenic patients receiving VPA for the prevention of violent behaviors in the morning after overnight fast. Blood concentrations of ammonia, VPA, free carnitine, acyl-carnitine, and 40 amino acids including glutamate and citrulline were measured for each patient. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify amino acids or concomitantly administered drugs that were associated with variability in the blood concentrations of ammonia.
The blood ammonia level was positively correlated with the serum glutamate concentration (r = 0.44, p &lt; 0.01) but negatively correlated with glutamine (r = -0.41, p = 0.01), citrulline (r = -0.42, p = 0.01), and glycine concentrations (r = -0.54, p &lt; 0.01). It was also revealed that the concomitant administration of the mood stabilizers (p = 0.04) risperidone (p = 0.03) and blonanserin (p &lt; 0.01) was positively associated with the elevation of the blood ammonia level.
We hypothisized that VPA would elevate the blood ammonia level of schizophrenic patients. The observed changes in serum amino acids are compatible with urea cycle dysfunction, possibly due to reduced carbamoyl-phosphate synthase 1 (CPS1) activity. We conclude that VPA should be prudently prescribed to schizophrenic patients, particularly those receiving mood stabilizers or certain antipsychotics.
The carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency (CPS1D) was rare and hard to diagnose due to its atypical symptoms. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was typically unavailable in other reports because most patients died before diagnosis was confirmed. Furthermore, it was found a new mutation that had not been described previously.
This is a case of neonatal-onset CPS1D with nonspecific clinical manifestations and deteriorating rapidly. Poor feeding, low activity, and tachypnoea were observed, with rapid progression on day 2 after birth. Severe systematic infection was considered first. However, blood culture and cerebrospinal fluid examination were negative. Symptoms were relief temporarily. Then seizure and tachypnoea reappeared as intravenous amino acids were provided. Further examination indicated severe hyperammonemia (serum ammonia level &gt;500mmol/L). Brain MRI showed diffused white matter lesions.
Genetic analysis revealed 2 heterozygous mutations in the CPS1 gene: c.2407C&gt;G (p.803, R&gt;G) in exon 20 and C.323G&gt;A (p.108, G&gt;E) in exon 4. The diagnosis of CSP1D was confirmed.
Fasting, the withdrawal of amino acids and plans to treat hyperammonemia were immediately implemented.
The parents decided to discontinue medical care.
Many CPS1D patients died before the diagnoses are confirmed due to its sudden onset, rapid deterioration, atypical symptoms, and low morbidity. Once hyperammonemia is confirmed, blood and urea amino acid analysis in combination with genetic examinations should be performed as early as possible, this approach would help establish diagnoses at an early stage and thus contribute to reducing mortality and improving prognosis.
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by pulmonary vascular remodeling of the precapillary pulmonary arteries, with excessive proliferation of vascular cells. This study was performed to examine the effects of long noncoding RNA CPS1 intronic transcript 1 (CPS1-IT) on PAH in rat models of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) through regulating interleukin (IL)-1β expression. The OSA models were induced in rats, for determination of the CPS1-IT expression. The binding of CPS1-IT and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) was verified. To analyze the effects of CPS1-IT on PAH, the overexpression vector of CPS1-IT and HIF1, shRNA against IL-1β and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC, inhibitor of the NF-κB signaling pathway) were injected into rat models, respectively. The blood pressure and activity of biochemical indicators including nitric oxide (NO), nitric oxide synthase (NOS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and lipid peroxide (LPO) were assessed. The expression of IL-1β, HIF1, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and fibronectin (FN) was determined. The relationship of CPS1-IT to IL-1β and NF-κB was evaluated. CPS1-IT was downregulated in the OSA rat model. Overexpressed CPS1-IT increased the activity of NO, NOS, and SOD as well as α-SMA expression, whereas decreasing LPO activity and expression of PCNA and FN, whereby PAH was suppressed. Notably, overexpressed CPS1-IT reduced IL-1β expression through NF-κB signaling pathway via inhibiting the HIF1 transcriptional activity, suggesting a mechanism affecting PAH. To conclude, overexpressed CPS1-IT alleviated PAH in OSA by reducing IL-1β expression, the mechanism of which was involved with inhibited HIF1 transcriptional activity and the NF-κB signaling pathway.
Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase-1 (CPS1) is the major mitochondrial urea cycle enzyme in hepatocytes. It is released into mouse and human blood during acute liver injury, where is has a short half-life. The function of CPS1 in blood and the reason for its short half-life in serum are unknown. We show that CPS1 is released normally into mouse and human bile, and pathologically into blood during acute liver injury. Other cytoplasmic and mitochondrial urea cycle enzymes are also found in normal mouse bile. Serum, bile, and purified CPS1 manifest sedimentation properties that overlap with extracellular vesicles, due to the propensity of CPS1 to aggregate despite being released primarily as a soluble protein. During liver injury, CPS1 in blood is rapidly sequestered by monocytes, leading to monocyte M2-polarization and homing to the liver independent of its enzyme activity. Recombinant CPS1 (rCPS1), but not control r-transferrin, increases hepatic macrophage numbers and phagocytic activity. Notably, rCPS1 does not activate hepatic macrophages directly; rather, it activates bone marrow and circulating monocytes that then home to the liver. rCPS1 administration prevents mouse liver damage induced by Fas ligand or acetaminophen, but this protection is absent in macrophage-deficient mice. Moreover, rCPS1 protects from acetaminophen-induced liver injury even when given therapeutically after injury induction. In summary, CPS1 is normally found in bile but is released by hepatocytes into blood upon liver damage. We demonstrate a nonenzymatic function of CPS1 as an antiinflammatory protective cytokine during acute liver injury.
Valproic acid (VPA) as a widely used primary medication in the treatment of epilepsy is associated with reversible or irreversible hepatotoxicity. Long-term VPA therapy is also related to increased risk for the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In this review, metabolic elimination pathways of VPA in the liver and underlying mechanisms of VPA-induced hepatotoxicity are discussed.
We searched in PubMed for manuscript published in English combining terms "Valproic acid", "hepatotoxicity", "liver injury", "mechanisms". The data of screened papers were analyzed and summarized.
Formation of VPA reactive metabolites, inhibition of fatty acid β-oxidation, excessive oxidative stress and genetic variants of some enzymes, such as CPS1, POLG, GSTs, SOD2, UGTs and CYPs genes, have been reported to be associated with VPA hepatotoxicity. Furthermore, carnitine supplementation and antioxidants administration become positive treatment strategies for VPA-induced hepatotoxicity.
Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and routine liver biochemistry monitoring during VPA-therapy, as well as genotype screening for certain patients before VPA administration, could improve the safety profile of this antiepileptic drug.
Vascular invasion is considered as the critical risk factor of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying macrovascular invasion (MaVI) in HCC, we performed an iTRAQ based proteomic study to identify notably dysregulated proteins from eight HCC patients with differential vascular invasion and further confirmed them in the other 53 HCC patients. Forty-seven proteins were found significantly down-regulated in HCC with MaVI. More importantly, 30 of them were not changed in HCC without MaVI. Gene ontology analysis of these 47 proteins shows the top three enriched biological processes are urea cycle, gluconeogenesis, and arginine biosynthetic process. We validated nine remarkably dysregulated candidates in HCC patients with MaVI by Western blot including eight down-regulated proteins (CPS1, ASS1, ASL, ARG1, BHMT, DMGDH, Annexin A6, and CES1) and one up-regulated protein (CKAP4). Furthermore, dysregulation of CPS1, ASL, and ARG1, key enzymes involved in urea cycle, together with Annexin A6 and CES1, major proteins in regulating cholesterol homeostasis and fatty acid ester metabolism, was verified using immunohistochemical staining. The significant down-regulation of urea cycle generates clinically relevant proteomic signature in HCC patients with macrovascular invasion, which may provide possible insights into the molecular mechanisms of metastasis and new therapeutic targets of HCC.
A liver-humanized mouse model for CPS1-deficiency was generated by the high-level repopulation of the mouse liver with CPS1-deficient human hepatocytes. When compared with mice that are highly repopulated with CPS1-proficient human hepatocytes, mice that are repopulated with CPS1-deficient human hepatocytes exhibited characteristic symptoms of human CPS1 deficiency including an 80% reduction in CPS1 metabolic activity, delayed clearance of an ammonium chloride infusion, elevated glutamine and glutamate levels, and impaired metabolism of [15 N]ammonium chloride into urea, with no other obvious phenotypic differences. Because most metabolic liver diseases result from mutations that alter critical pathways in hepatocytes, a model that incorporates actual disease-affected, mutant human hepatocytes is useful for the investigation of the molecular, biochemical, and phenotypic differences induced by that mutation. The model is also expected to be useful for investigations of modified RNA, gene, and cellular and small molecule therapies for CPS1-deficiency. Liver-humanized models for this and other monogenic liver diseases afford the ability to assess the therapy on actual disease-affected human hepatocytes, in vivo, for long periods of time and will provide data that are highly relevant for investigations of the safety and efficacy of gene-editing technologies directed to human hepatocytes and the translation of gene-editing technology to the clinic.
Cancer cells exhibit altered and usually increased metabolic processes to meet their high biogenetic demands1,2. Under these conditions, ammonia is concomitantly produced by the increased metabolic processing. However, it is unclear how tumour cells dispose of excess ammonia and what outcomes might be caused by the accumulation of ammonia. Here we report that the tumour suppressor p53, the most frequently mutated gene in human tumours, regulates ammonia metabolism by repressing the urea cycle. Through transcriptional downregulation of CPS1, OTC and ARG1, p53 suppresses ureagenesis and elimination of ammonia in vitro and in vivo, leading to the inhibition of tumour growth. Conversely, downregulation of these genes reciprocally activates p53 by MDM2-mediated mechanism(s). Furthermore, the accumulation of ammonia causes a significant decline in mRNA translation of the polyamine biosynthetic rate-limiting enzyme ODC, thereby inhibiting the biosynthesis of polyamine and cell proliferation. Together, these findings link p53 to ureagenesis and ammonia metabolism, and further reveal a role for ammonia in controlling polyamine biosynthesis and cell proliferation.
The enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1; EC 6.3.4.16) forms carbamoyl phosphate from bicarbonate, ammonia, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and is activated allosterically by N-acetylglutamate. The neonatal presentation of bi-allelic mutations of CPS1 results in hyperammonemia with reduced citrulline and is reported as the most challenging nitrogen metabolism disorder to treat. As therapeutic interventions are limited, patients often develop neurological injury or die from hyperammonemia. Survivors remain vulnerable to nitrogen overload, being at risk for repetitive neurological injury. With transgenic technology, our lab developed a constitutive Cps1 mutant mouse and reports its characterization herein. Within 24 hours of birth, all Cps1 -/- mice developed hyperammonemia and expired. No CPS1 protein by Western blot or immunostaining was detected in livers nor was Cps1 mRNA present. CPS1 enzymatic activity was markedly decreased in knockout livers and reduced in Cps1+/- mice. Plasma analysis found markedly reduced citrulline and arginine and markedly increased glutamine and alanine, both intermolecular carriers of nitrogen, along with elevated ammonia, taurine, and lysine. Derangements in multiple other amino acids were also detected. While hepatic amino acids also demonstrated markedly reduced citrulline, arginine, while decreased, was not statistically significant; alanine and lysine were markedly increased while glutamine was trending towards significance. In conclusion we have determined that this constitutive neonatal mouse model of CPS1 deficiency replicates the neonatal human phenotype and demonstrates the key biochemical features of the disorder. These mice will be integral for addressing the challenges of developing new therapeutic approaches for this, at present, poorly treated disorder.
Patients with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) and propionic acidemia (PA) and urea cycle disorders (UCD), treated with a protein restricted diet, are prone to growth failure. To obtain optimal growth and thereby efficacious protein incorporation, a diet containing the essential and functional amino acids for growth is necessary. Optimal growth will result in improved protein tolerance and possibly a decrease in the number of decompensations. It thus needs to be determined if amino acid deficiencies are associated with the growth retardation in these patient groups. We studied the correlations between plasma L-arginine levels, plasma branched chain amino acids (BCAA: L-isoleucine, L-leucine and L-valine) levels (amino acids known to influence growth), and height in MMA/PA and UCD patients.
We analyzed data from longitudinal visits made in stable metabolic periods by patients registered at the European Registry and Network for Intoxication Type Metabolic Diseases (E-IMD, Chafea no. 2010 12 01).
In total, 263 MMA/PA and 311 UCD patients were included, all aged below 18 years of age. In patients with MMA and PA, height z-score was positively associated with patients' natural-protein-to-energy prescription ratio and their plasma L-valine and L-arginine levels, while negatively associated with the amount of synthetic protein prescription and their age at visit. In all UCDs combined, height z-score was positively associated with the natural-protein-to-energy prescription ratio. In those with carbamylphosphate synthetase 1 deficiency (CPS1-D), those with male ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTC-D), and those in the hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria (HHH) syndrome subgroup, height z-score was positively associated with patients' plasma L-leucine levels. In those with argininosuccinate synthetase deficiency (ASS-D) and argininosuccinate lyase deficiency (ASL-D), height was positively associated with patients' plasma L-valine levels.
Plasma L-arginine and L-valine levels in MMA/PA patients and plasma L-leucine and L-valine levels in UCD patients, as well as the protein-to-energy prescription ratio in both groups were positively associated with height. Optimization of these plasma amino acid levels is essential to support normal growth and increase protein tolerance in these disorders. Consequently this could improve the protein-to-energy intake ratio.
Mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes engender unique metabolic phenotypes crucial to the survival of tumor cells. EGFR signaling has been linked to the rewiring of tumor metabolism in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We have integrated the use of a functional genomics screen and metabolomics to identify metabolic vulnerabilities induced by EGFR inhibition. These studies reveal that following EGFR inhibition, EGFR-driven NSCLC cells become dependent on the urea cycle and, in particular, the urea cycle enzyme CPS1. Combining knockdown of CPS1 with EGFR inhibition further reduces cell proliferation and impedes cell-cycle progression. Profiling of the metabolome demonstrates that suppression of CPS1 potentiates the effects of EGFR inhibition on central carbon metabolism, pyrimidine biosynthesis, and arginine metabolism, coinciding with reduced glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. We show that EGFR inhibition and CPS1 knockdown lead to a decrease in arginine levels and pyrimidine derivatives, and the addition of exogenous pyrimidines partially rescues the impairment in cell growth. Finally, we show that high expression of CPS1 in lung adenocarcinomas correlated with worse patient prognosis in publicly available databases. These data collectively reveal that NSCLC cells have a greater dependency on the urea cycle to sustain central carbon metabolism, pyrimidine biosynthesis, and arginine metabolism to meet cellular energetics upon inhibition of EGFR.Implications: Our results reveal that the urea cycle may be a novel metabolic vulnerability in the context of EGFR inhibition, providing an opportunity to develop rational combination therapies with EGFR inhibitors for the treatment of EGFR-driven NSCLC.
Hyperammonemia is an important contributing factor to hepatic encephalopathy in end-stage liver failure patients. Therefore reducing hyperammonemia is a requisite of bioartificial liver support (BAL). Ammonia elimination by human liver HepaRG cells occurs predominantly through reversible fixation into amino acids, whereas the irreversible conversion into urea is limited. Compared to human liver, the expression and activity of the three urea cycle (UC) enzymes carbamoyl-phosphate synthase1 (CPS1), ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC) and arginase1, are low. To improve HepaRG cells as BAL biocomponent, its rate limiting factor of the UC was determined under two culture conditions: static and dynamic medium flow (DMF) achieved by shaking. HepaRG cells increasingly converted escalating arginine doses into urea, indicating that arginase activity is not limiting ureagenesis. Neither was OTC activity, as a stable HepaRG line overexpressing OTC exhibited a 90- and 15.7-fold upregulation of OTC transcript and activity levels, without improvement in ureagenesis. However, a stable HepaRG line overexpressing CPS1 showed increased mitochondrial stress and reduced hepatic differentiation without promotion of the CPS1 transcript level or ureagenesis under static-culturing conditions, yet, it exhibited a 4.3-fold increased ureagenesis under DMF. This was associated with increased CPS1 transcript and activity levels amounting to &gt;2-fold, increased mitochondrial abundance and hepatic differentiation. Unexpectedly, the transcript levels of several other UC genes increased up to 6.8-fold. We conclude that ureagenesis can be improved in HepaRG cells by CPS1 overexpression, however, only in combination with DMF-culturing, suggesting that both the low CPS1 level and static-culturing, possibly due to insufficient mitochondria, are limiting UC.
Identification of crucial genes and possible biomarkers which are involved in Barrett's esophagus (BE) disease was aim of this study.
BE is diagnosed by endoscopy and biopsy and is characterized by esophageal columnar metaplastic epithelium. BE can convert into dysplasia that finally results cancer condition.
Gene expression profiles of BE and normal gastric cardia which are characterized by GSE34619 and GPL6244 platform (1) were retrieved from gene expression omnibus (GEO). The significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed via protein-protein interaction network (PPI) analysis. The nodes of network were enriched via gene ontology (GO) to find biological terms. Action map of network elements was provided.
Among 250 top DEGs, 100 ones were included in PPI network and KIT, CFTR, IMPDH2, MYB, FLT1, ATP4A, and CPS1 were recognized as prominent genes related to BE. Seven amino acids including arginine, alanine, aspartate, glutamate, valine, leucine and isoleucine which are related to BE were highlighted.
In conclusion five central DEGs; KIT, CFTR, IMPDH2, MYB, and FLT1 were proposed as possible biomarkers for BE. However, validation and more experimental information is require to finalize the findings.
Organic acidurias (OAD) and urea-cycle disorders (UCD) are rare inherited disorders affecting amino acid and protein metabolism. As dietary practice varies widely, we assessed their long-term prescribed dietary treatment against published guideline and studied plasma amino acids levels. We analyzed data from the first visit recorded in the European registry and network for intoxication type metabolic diseases (E-IMD, Chafea no. 2010 12 01). In total, 271 methylmalonic aciduria (MMA) and propionic aciduria (PA) and 361 UCD patients were included. Median natural protein prescription was consistent with the recommended daily allowance (RDA), plasma L-valine (57%), and L-isoleucine (55%) levels in MMA and PA lay below reference ranges. Plasma levels were particularly low in patients who received amino acid mixtures (AAMs-OAD) and L-isoleucine:L-leucine:L-valine (BCAA) ratio was 1.0:3.0:3.2. In UCD patients, plasma L-valine, L-isoleucine, and L-leucine levels lay below reference ranges in 18%, 30%, and 31%, respectively. In symptomatic UCD patients who received AAM-UCD, the median natural protein prescription lay below RDA, while their L-valine and L-isoleucine levels and plasma BCAA ratios were comparable to those in patients who did not receive AAM-UCD. Notably, in patients with ornithine transcarbamylase syndrome (OTC-D), carbamylphosphate synthetase 1 syndrome (CPS1-D) and hyperammonemia-hyperornithinemia-homocitrullinemia (HHH) syndrome selective L-citrulline supplementation resulted in higher plasma L-arginine levels than selective L-arginine supplementation. In conclusion, while MMA and PA patients who received AAMs-OAD had very low BCAA levels and disturbed plasma BCAA ratios, AAMs-UCD seemed to help UCD patients obtain normal BCAA levels. In patients with OTC-D, CPS1-D, and HHH syndrome, selective L-citrulline seemed preferable to selective L-arginine supplementation.
The urea cycle and glutamine synthetase (GS) are the two main pathways for waste nitrogen removal and their deficiency results in hyperammonemia. Here, we investigated the efficacy of liver-specific GS overexpression for therapy of hyperammonemia. To achieve hepatic GS overexpression, we generated a helper-dependent adenoviral (HDAd) vector expressing the murine GS under the control of a liver-specific expression cassette (HDAd-GS). Compared to mice injected with a control vector expressing an unrelated reporter gene (HDAd-alpha-fetoprotein), wild-type mice with increased hepatic GS showed reduced blood ammonia levels and a concomitant increase of blood glutamine after intraperitoneal injections of ammonium chloride, whereas blood urea was unaffected. Moreover, injection of HDAd-GS reduced blood ammonia levels at baseline and protected against acute hyperammonemia following ammonia challenge in a mouse model with conditional hepatic deficiency of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (Cps1), the initial and rate-limiting step of ureagenesis. In summary, we found that upregulation of hepatic GS reduced hyperammonemia in wild-type and Cps1-deficient mice, thus confirming a key role of GS in ammonia detoxification. These results suggest that hepatic GS augmentation therapy has potential for treatment of both primary and secondary forms of hyperammonemia.
This study aims to assess the value of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1), as a non-invasive serum marker, for the evolution of chronic HCV infection and hepatic fibrosis. Seventy-two patients with HCV positive serum RNA and 15 health volunteers were enrolled in this study. Out of 72 patients, 10 patients had decompensated liver with ascites. Quantitative analysis of CPS1 was performed in the harvested sera and corresponding liver biopsies using ELISA and immunohistochemistry techniques respectively. Also, mitochondrial count using electron microscopy, urea analysis and conventional liver tests were done. Patients were grouped into (F1 + F2) and (F3 + F4) representing stages of moderate and severe fibrosis respectively. Tissue and serum CPS1 (s.CPS1) correlated significantly in moderate and severe fibrosis. Patients with severe fibrosis showed significantly higher levels of s.CPS1 (p-value ≤ 0.05) and significantly lower mitochondrial counts (p-value = 0.0065) than those with moderate fibrosis. S.urea positively correlated with s.CPS1 only in the decompensated group, at which s.urea reached maximal levels. In conclusion, s.CPS1 is a potential non-invasive marker for the assessment of severity and progression of HCV in relation to mitochondrial dysfunction. Also, increased s.urea with the progression of the disease is mainly due to a concurrent renal malfunction, which needs further investigation.
To assess the use of plasma free amino acids (PFAAs) as biomarkers for metabolic disorders, it is essential to identify genetic factors that influence PFAA concentrations. PFAA concentrations were absolutely quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry using plasma samples from 1338 Japanese individuals, and genome-wide quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was performed for the concentrations of 21 PFAAs. We next conducted a conditional QTL analysis using the concentration of each PFAA adjusted by the other 20 PFAAs as covariates to elucidate genetic determinants that influence PFAA concentrations. We identified eight genes that showed a significant association with PFAA concentrations, of which two, SLC7A2 and PKD1L2, were identified. SLC7A2 was associated with the plasma levels of arginine and ornithine, and PKD1L2 with the level of glycine. The significant associations of these two genes were revealed in the conditional QTL analysis, but a significant association between serine and the CPS1 gene disappeared when glycine was used as a covariate. We demonstrated that conditional QTL analysis is useful for determining the metabolic pathways predominantly used for PFAA metabolism. Our findings will help elucidate the physiological roles of genetic components that control the metabolism of amino acids.
Streptococcus pneumoniae's polysaccharide capsule is an important virulence factor; vaccine-induced immunity to specific capsular polysaccharide effectively prevents disease. Serotype 1 S. pneumoniae is rarely found in healthy persons, but is highly invasive and a common cause of meningitis outbreaks and invasive disease outside of the United States. Here we show that genes for polysaccharide capsule similar to those expressed by pneumococci were commonly detected by polymerase chain reaction among upper respiratory tract samples from older US adults not carrying pneumococci. Serotype 1-specific genes were predominantly detected. In five oropharyngeal samples tested, serotype 1 gene belonging to S. mitis expressed capsules immunologically indistinct from pneumococcal capsules. Whole genome sequencing revealed three distinct S. mitis clones, each representing a cps1 operon highly similar to the pneumococcal cps1 reference operon. These findings raise important questions about the contribution of commensal streptococci to natural immunity against pneumococci, a leading cause of mortality worldwide.
To explore the genetic basis for a neonate featuring hyperammonemia.
The patient was examined and tested by tandem mass spectrometry and next generation sequencing (NGS). Suspected mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing of the proband and her parents. Potential impact of the mutation was predicted with SIFT, PolyPhen-2 and MutationTaste software.
Plasma ammonia and alanine were significantly increased in the proband, while serum citrulline was decreased. The neonate was found to harbor compound heterozygous mutations of the CPS1 gene [c.1631C&gt;T(p.T544M) and c.1981G&gt;T(p.G661C)], which were respectively inherited from her father and mother.
The carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency of the proband can probably be attributed to the mutations of the CPS1 gene. Above finding has expanded the spectrum of CPS1 mutations in association with carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency.
Hydrolysis within the vacuole in yeast and the lysosome in mammals is required for the degradation and recycling of a multitude of substrates, many of which are delivered to the vacuole/lysosome by autophagy. In humans, defects in lysosomal hydrolysis and efflux can have devastating consequences, and contribute to a class of diseases referred to as lysosomal storage disorders. Despite the importance of these processes, many of the proteins and regulatory mechanisms involved in hydrolysis and efflux are poorly understood. In this review, we describe our current knowledge of the vacuolar/lysosomal degradation and efflux of a vast array of substrates, focusing primarily on what is known in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We also highlight many unanswered questions, the answers to which may lead to new advances in the treatment of lysosomal storage disorders. Abbreviations: Ams1: α-mannosidase; Ape1: aminopeptidase I; Ape3: aminopeptidase Y; Ape4: aspartyl aminopeptidase; Atg: autophagy related; Cps1: carboxypeptidase S; CTNS: cystinosin, lysosomal cystine transporter; CTSA: cathepsin A; CTSD: cathepsin D; Cvt: cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting; Dap2: dipeptidyl aminopeptidase B; GS-bimane: glutathione-S-bimane; GSH: glutathione; LDs: lipid droplets; MVB: multivesicular body; PAS: phagophore assembly site; Pep4: proteinase A; PolyP: polyphosphate; Prb1: proteinase B; Prc1: carboxypeptidase Y; V-ATPase: vacuolar-type proton-translocating ATPase; VTC: vacuolar transporter chaperone.
Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS1) represents an important regulatory enzyme of the urea cycle that mediates the ATP-driven reaction ligating ammonium, carbonate, and phosphate to form carbamoyl phosphate. The freeze-tolerant wood frog (Rana sylvatica or Lithobates sylvaticus) accumulates high concentrations of urea during bouts of freezing to detoxify any ammonia generated and to contribute as a cryoprotectant thereby helping to avoid freeze damage to cells. Purification of CPS1 to homogeneity from wood frog liver was performed in control and frozen wood frogs by a three-step chromatographic process. The affinity of CPS1 for its three substrates was tested in the purified control and freeze-exposed enzyme under a variety of conditions including the presence and absence of the natural cryoprotectants urea and glucose. The results demonstrated that affinity for ammonium was higher in the freeze-exposed CPS1 (1.26-fold) and that with the addition of 400 mM glucose it displayed higher affinity for ATP (1.30-fold) and the obligate activator N-acetylglutamate (1.24-fold). Denaturation studies demonstrated the freeze-exposed enzyme was less thermally stable than the control with an unfolding temperature approximately 1.5 °C lower (52.9 °C for frozen and 54.4 °C for control). The control form of CPS1 had a significantly higher degree of glutarylated lysine residues (1.42-fold increase) relative to the frozen. The results suggest that CPS1 activation and maintenance of urea cycle activity despite the hypometabolic conditions associated with freezing are important aspects in the metabolic survival strategies of the wood frog.
The anaerobic intestinal spirochaete Brachyspira pilosicoli colonizes the large intestine of a variety of species of mammals and birds, and may result in colitis, diarrhoea and reductions in growth rate. Naturally occurring infections in chickens are largely confined to adult laying and breeding birds. In this study, the 34 kD carboxy-terminus of the prominent outer membrane protein Bmp72 of B. pilosicoli was expressed as a histidine-tagged recombinant protein and used to immunize two groups (B and C) of 15 individually housed layer chickens. Vaccination was with either 100 μg (B) or 1 mg (C) protein emulsified with Freund's incomplete adjuvant delivered into the pectoral muscles, followed three weeks later by 1 mg of protein in phosphate buffered saline delivered via crop tube. Two weeks later these and 15 non-vaccinated positive control birds (group A) housed in the same room were challenged via crop tube with B. pilosicoli avian strain CPS1. B. pilosicoli was detected in the faeces of all control birds and in 14 of the vaccinated birds in each vaccinated group at some point over the 30-day period following challenge. Colonization was delayed and the duration of excretion was significantly reduced (P = 0.0001) in both groups of vaccinated birds compared to the non-vaccinated control birds. Fewer immunized birds had abnormal caecal contents at post mortem examination compared to non-vaccinated birds, but the difference was not statistically significant. This study indicates that recombinant Bmp72 C-terminus has potential to be developed for use as a vaccine component to provide protection against B. pilosicoli infections. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS Laying chickens were immunized with recombinant Brachyspira pilosicoli membrane protein Bpmp72. Immunized birds had a highly significant reduction in the duration of colonization. Fewer immunized than control birds had abnormal caecal contents after infection. Bpmp72 showed potential for use as a novel vaccine component for B. pilosicoli.
To determine the influence of the construction design over the biological component's performance in an experimental bio-artificial liver (BAL) device.
Two BAL models for liver microorgans (LMOs) were constructed. First, we constructed a cylindrical BAL and tested it without the biological component to establish its correct functioning. Samples of blood and biological compartment (BC) fluid were taken after 0, 60, and 120 min of perfusion. Osmolality, hematocrit, ammonia and glucose concentrations, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release (as a LMO viability parameter), and oxygen consumption and ammonia metabolizing capacity (as LMO functionality parameters) were determined. CPSI and OTC gene expression and function were measured. The second BAL, a "flat bottom" model, was constructed using a 25 cm2 culture flask while maintaining all other components between the models. The BC of both BALs had the same capacity (approximately 50 cm3) and both were manipulated with the same perfusion system. The performances of the two BALs were compared to show the influence of architecture.
The cylindrical BAL showed a good exchange of fluids and metabolites between blood and the BC, reflected by the matching of osmolalities, and glucose and ammonia concentration ratios after 120 min of perfusion. No hemoconcentration was detected, the hematocrit levels remained stable during the whole study, and the minimal percentage of hemolysis (0.65% ± 0.10%) observed was due to the action of the peristaltic pump. When LMOs were used as biological component of this BAL they showed similar values to the ones obtained in a Normothermic Reoxygenation System (NRS) for almost all the parameters assayed. After 120 min, the results obtained were: LDH release (%): 14.7 ± 3.1 in the BAL and 15.5 ± 3.2 in the NRS (n = 6); oxygen consumption (μmol/min·g wet tissue): 1.16 ± 0.21 in the BAL and 0.84 ± 0.15 in the NRS (n = 6); relative expression of Cps1 and Otc: 0.63 ± 0.12 and 0.67 ± 0.20, respectively, in the BAL, and 0.86 ± 0.10 and 0.82 ± 0.07, respectively, in the NRS (n = 3); enzymatic activity of CPSI and OTC (U/g wet tissue): 3.03 ± 0.86 and 222.0 ± 23.5, respectively, in the BAL, and 3.12 ± 0.73 and 228.8 ± 32.8, respectively, in the NRS (n = 3). In spite of these similarities, LMOs as a biological component of the cylindrical BAL were not able to detoxify ammonia at a significant level (not detected vs 35.1% ± 7.0% of the initial 1 mM NH4+ dose in NRS, n = 6). Therefore, we built a second BAL with an entirely different design that offers a flat base BC. When LMOs were placed in this "flat bottom" device they were able to detoxify 49.3% ± 8.8% of the initial ammonia overload after 120 min of perfusion (n = 6), with a detoxification capacity of 13.2 ± 2.2 μmol/g wet tissue.
In this work, we demonstrate the importance of adapting the BAL architecture to the biological component characteristics to obtain an adequate BAL performance.
Subcutaneous transplantation of engineered hepatocyte/fibroblast sheets (EHFSs) is a low invasive and safe approach to construct vascularized subcutaneous human liver tissue (VSLT). However, the liver-specific structures and functionalities in the development process of VSLTs in mice remain poorly understood. Here, we describe time-dependent characteristics of the formation of the vascular network, cell-cell adhesions, liver transporters, liver-specific protein synthesis, and metabolizing activities. The EHFSs formed multilayered thick tissues by rapid neovascularization, which allows overcoming extremely difficult problems, such as the lack of oxygen supply on the formation of three-dimensional primary hepatocyte tissue under the skin. The blood vessels consisted of mouse-origin endothelial cells (ECs) (mVEGFR2) from the subcutaneous space at 1-7 days, and the following formation of the vascular network was performed by human-origin ECs (hVEGFR2). Many varieties of liver-specific gene expressions increased with the construction of the VSLTs: cell-cell adhesion molecules (CDH1, CLDN3, and CX32), transporters at basal (OATP1A1, OCT1, and NTCP) and apical membranes (MRP2, MDR1, and BSEP), blood coagulation factors (F8 and F9), urea synthesis (CPS1, OTC, and ARG1), and metabolism enzymes (CYP7A1, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP3A4, and UGT1A1). Subacute hepatic failure model mice with VSLT were alive at least 7 weeks after liver damage. Thus, the ectopic liver organ offers the potential for a low invasive and safe treatment for liver diseases.
The bHLH transcription factors have important role in regulation of plant growth, development, and secondary metabolism. Tanshinones are the major pharmaceutical components present in Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge. It has been reported that bHLHs have functions in terpenoids biosynthesis. Here, we got a bHLH family member named SmbHLH10 which could positively regulate tanshinones biosynthesis in S. miltiorrhiza hairy roots. In the SmbHLH10-overexpressing line 6, four major tanshinones contents were reaching 2.51-fold (dihydrotanshinone I), 2.84-fold (cryptotanshinone), 2.89- fold (tanshinone I), 2.68-fold (tanshinone II A) of WT, respectively. The variation in tanshinones biosynthetic pathway gene transcription was generally consistent with tanshinones content. DXS2, DXS3 and DXR of MEP pathway were induced substantially, reaching 10-fold, 3-fold, 5.74-fold higher of the WT, respectively. The downstream pathway genes CPS1, CPS5 and CYP76AH1 were highest in line OE-SmbHLH10-6, reached 4.93, 16.29 and 3.27-fold of the WT, respectively, while KSL1's expression was highest in line OE-SmbHLH10-4, 4.64-fold of WT. Yeast one-hybrid assays results showed that SmbHLH10 could binds the predicted G-box motifs within the promoters of DXS2, CPS1 and CPS5. These findings indicated that SmbHLH10 could directly binds to G-box in the pathway genes' promotor, activate their expression and then upregulate tanshinones biosynthesis.
N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency (NAGSD, MIM #237310) is an autosomal recessive disorder of the urea cycle that results from absent or decreased production of N-acetylglutamate (NAG) due to either decreased NAGS gene expression or defective NAGS enzyme. NAG is essential for the activity of carbamylphosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1), the first and rate-limiting enzyme of the urea cycle. NAGSD is the only urea cycle disorder that can be treated with a single drug, N-carbamylglutamate (NCG), which can activate CPS1 and completely restore ureagenesis in patients with NAGSD. We describe a novel sequence variant NM_153006.2:c.-3026C &gt; T in the NAGS enhancer that was found in three patients from two families with NAGSD; two patients had hyperammonemia that resolved upon treatment with NCG, while the third patient increased dietary protein intake after initiation of NCG therapy. Two patients were homozygous for the variant while the third patient had the c.-3026C &gt; T variant and a partial uniparental disomy that encompassed the NAGS gene on chromosome 17. The c.-3026C &gt; T sequence variant affects a base pair that is highly conserved in vertebrates; the variant is predicted to be deleterious by several bioinformatics tools. Functional assays in cultured HepG2 cells demonstrated that the c.-3026C &gt; T substitution could result in reduced expression of the NAGS gene. These findings underscore the importance of analyzing NAGS gene regulatory regions when looking for molecular causes of NAGSD.
Current studies have indicated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) could act as tumor biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis prediction. In this study, we mainly focused on determining the expression of circulating lncRNAs in patients suffering for hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HC), aiming to reveal the potential lncRNA as a fingerprint.
A total 12 lncRNAs were previously proven to be aberrantly expressed in HC tumor tissues. All of the 12 lncRNAs were selected as candidate targets for subsequent circulating lncRNA assay. The candidate lncRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR arranged in training and validation sets. The risk score analysis was employed. Data was presented with receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC).
Circulating PCAT1, MALAT1, and CPS1-IT1 were significantly increased in plasma samples of HC patients in both the training set and validation set. Through ROC analysis, we found that the three plasmatic lncRNAs presented the area under ROC curve value (AUC) as 0.784, 0.860, and 0.677. Further combination with the three factors indicated a higher power (AUC, 0.893; sensitivity, 85.5%; specificity, 93.2%).
This was the first time to reveal the potential circulating fingerprints for predicting HC. PCAT1, MALAT1, and CPS1-IT1 may act as novel early diagnosis biomarkers for predicting HC.
Myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1), together with catalytic subunit of type1 delta isoform (PP1cdelta) and a small 20-kDa regulatory unit (M20), form a heterotrimeric holoenzyme, myosin phosphatase (MP), which is responsible for regulating the extent of myosin light chain phosphorylation. Here we report the identification and characterization of a molecular interaction between Seven in absentia homolog 2 (SIAH2) and MYPT1 that resulted in the proteasomal degradation of the latter in mammalian cells, including neurons and glia. The interaction involved the substrate binding domain of SIAH2 (aa 116-324) and a central region of MYPT1 (aa 445-632) containing a degenerate consensus Siah-binding motif RLAYVAP (aa 493-499) evolutionally conserved from fish to humans. These findings suggest a novel mechanism whereby the ability of MP to modulate myosin light chain might be regulated by the degradation of its targeting subunit MYPT1 through the SIAH2-ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. In this manner, the turnover of MYPT1 would serve to limit the duration and/or magnitude of MP activity required to achieve a desired physiological effect.
Acquisition of resistance to anchorage dependant cell death, a process termed anoikis, is a requirement for cancer cell metastasis. However, the molecular determinants of anoikis resistance and sensitivity are poorly understood. To better understand resistance to anoikis we conducted a genome wide lentiviral shRNA screen to identify genes whose knockdown render anoikis-sensitive RWPE-1 prostate cells resistant to anoikis. RWPE-1 cells were infected with a pooled lentiviral shRNA library with 54,021 shRNA targeting 11,255 genes. After infection, an anoikis-resistant cell population was selected and shRNA sequences were amplified and sequenced. Thirty-four shRNA sequences reproducibly protected RWPE-1 cells from anoikis after culture under suspension conditions including the top validated hit, α/β hydrolase domain containing 4 (ABHD4). In validation studies, ABHD4 knockdown inhibited anoikis in RWPE-1 cells as well as anoikis sensitive NP69 nasopharyngeal and OVCAR3 ovarian cancer cells, while over-expression of the gene increased sensitivity. Induction of anoikis after ABHD4 knockdown was associated with cleavage of PARP and activation of caspases-3, but was independent in changes of FLIP, FAK and Src expression. Interestingly, induction of anoikis after ABHD4 knockdown was independent of the known role of ABHD4 in the anandamide synthesis pathway and the generation of glycerophospho-N-acyl ethanolamines. Thus, ABHD4 is a novel genetic regulator of anoikis sensitivity.
Mycophenolic acid (MPA), the active metabolite of the immunosuppressant mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), is primarily metabolized by glucuronidation to a phenolic glucuronide (MPAG) and an acyl glucuronide (AcMPAG). It is known that AcMPAG, which may be an immunotoxic metabolite, is deglucuronidated in human liver. However, it has been reported that recombinant β-glucuronidase does not catalyze this reaction. AcMPAG deglucuronidation activity was detected in both human liver cytosol (HLC) and microsomes (HLM). In this study, the enzyme responsible for AcMPAG deglucuronidation was identified by purification from HLC with column chromatographic purification steps. The purified enzyme was identified as α/β hydrolase domain containing 10 (ABHD10) by amino acid sequence analysis. Recombinant ABHD10 expressed in Sf9 cells efficiently deglucuronidated AcMPAG with a K(m) value of 100.7 ± 10.2 μM, which was similar to those in HLM, HLC, and human liver homogenates (HLH). Immunoblot analysis revealed ABHD10 protein expression in both HLC and HLM. The AcMPAG deglucuronidation by recombinant ABHD10, HLC, and HLH were potently inhibited by AgNO(3), CdCl(2), CuCl(2), PMSF, bis-p-nitrophenylphosphate, and DTNB. The CL(int) value of AcMPAG formation from MPA, which was catalyzed by human UGT2B7, in HLH was increased by 1.8-fold in the presence of PMSF. Thus, human ABHD10 would affect the formation of AcMPAG, the immunotoxic metabolite.
Osmotic stress activates the biosynthesis of abscisic acid (ABA). One major step in ABA biosynthesis is the carotenoid cleavage catalyzed by a 9-cis epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED). To understand the mechanism for osmotic stress activation of ABA biosynthesis, we screened for Arabidopsis thaliana mutants that failed to induce the NCED3 gene expression in response to osmotic stress treatments. The ced1 (for 9-cis epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase defective 1) mutant isolated in this study showed markedly reduced expression of NCED3 in response to osmotic stress (polyethylene glycol) treatments compared with the wild type. Other ABA biosynthesis genes are also greatly reduced in ced1 under osmotic stress. ced1 mutant plants are very sensitive to even mild osmotic stress. Map-based cloning revealed unexpectedly that CED1 encodes a putative α/β hydrolase domain-containing protein and is allelic to the BODYGUARD gene that was recently shown to be essential for cuticle biogenesis. Further studies discovered that other cutin biosynthesis mutants are also impaired in osmotic stress induction of ABA biosynthesis genes and are sensitive to osmotic stress. Our work demonstrates that the cuticle functions not merely as a physical barrier to minimize water loss but also mediates osmotic stress signaling and tolerance by regulating ABA biosynthesis and signaling.
Retrograde messengers adjust the precise timing of neurotransmitter release from the presynapse, thus modulating synaptic efficacy and neuronal activity. 2-Arachidonoyl glycerol, an endocannabinoid, is one such messenger produced in the postsynapse that inhibits neurotransmitter release upon activating presynaptic CB(1) cannabinoid receptors. Cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease is due to synaptic failure in hippocampal neuronal networks. We hypothesized that errant retrograde 2-arachidonoyl glycerol signalling impairs synaptic neurotransmission in Alzheimer's disease. Comparative protein profiling and quantitative morphometry showed that overall CB(1) cannabinoid receptor protein levels in the hippocampi of patients with Alzheimer's disease remain unchanged relative to age-matched controls, and CB(1) cannabinoid receptor-positive presynapses engulf amyloid-β-containing senile plaques. Hippocampal protein concentrations for the sn-1-diacylglycerol lipase α and β isoforms, synthesizing 2-arachidonoyl glycerol, significantly increased in definite Alzheimer's (Braak stage VI), with ectopic sn-1-diacylglycerol lipase β expression found in microglia accumulating near senile plaques and apposing CB(1) cannabinoid receptor-positive presynapses. We found that microglia, expressing two 2-arachidonoyl glycerol-degrading enzymes, serine hydrolase α/β-hydrolase domain-containing 6 and monoacylglycerol lipase, begin to surround senile plaques in probable Alzheimer's disease (Braak stage III). However, Alzheimer's pathology differentially impacts serine hydrolase α/β-hydrolase domain-containing 6 and monoacylglycerol lipase in hippocampal neurons: serine hydrolase α/β-hydrolase domain-containing 6 expression ceases in neurofibrillary tangle-bearing pyramidal cells. In contrast, pyramidal cells containing hyperphosphorylated tau retain monoacylglycerol lipase expression, although at levels significantly lower than in neurons lacking neurofibrillary pathology. Here, monoacylglycerol lipase accumulates in CB(1) cannabinoid receptor-positive presynapses. Subcellular fractionation revealed impaired monoacylglycerol lipase recruitment to biological membranes in post-mortem Alzheimer's tissues, suggesting that disease progression slows the termination of 2-arachidonoyl glycerol signalling. We have experimentally confirmed that altered 2-arachidonoyl glycerol signalling could contribute to synapse silencing in Alzheimer's disease by demonstrating significantly prolonged depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition when superfusing mouse hippocampi with amyloid-β. We propose that the temporal dynamics and cellular specificity of molecular rearrangements impairing 2-arachidonoyl glycerol availability and actions may differ from those of anandamide. Thus, enhanced endocannabinoid signalling, particularly around senile plaques, can exacerbate synaptic failure in Alzheimer's disease.
We previously showed that monophosphoryl lipid A (MLA) activates TLR4 in dendritic cells (DCs) in a Toll/IL-1R domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β (TRIF)-biased manner: MLA produced from Salmonella minnesota Re595 induced signaling events and expression of gene products that were primarily TRIF dependent, whereas MyD88-dependent signaling was impaired. Moreover, when tested in TRIF-intact/MyD88-deficient DCs, synthetic MLA of the Escherichia coli chemotype (sMLA) showed the same activity as its diphosphoryl, inflammatory counterpart (synthetic diphosphoryl lipid A), indicating that TRIF-mediated signaling is fully induced by sMLA. Unexpectedly, we found that the transcript level of one proinflammatory cytokine was increased in sMLA-treated cells by MyD88 deficiency to the higher level induced by synthetic diphosphoryl lipid A, which suggested MyD88 may paradoxically help restrain proinflammatory signaling by TRIF-biased sMLA. In this article, we demonstrate that sMLA induces MyD88 recruitment to TLR4 and activates the anti-inflammatory lipid phosphatase SHIP1 in an MyD88-dependent manner. At the same time, MyD88-dependent signaling activity at the level of IL-1R-associated kinase 1 is markedly reduced. Increased SHIP1 activity is associated with reductions in sMLA-induced IκB kinase α/β and IFN regulatory factor 3 activation and with restrained expression of their downstream targets, endothelin-1 and IFN-β, respectively. Results of this study identify a pattern that is desirable in the context of vaccine adjuvant design: TRIF-biased sMLA can stimulate partial MyD88 activity, with MyD88-dependent SHIP1 helping to reduce proinflammatory signaling in DCs.
Lipolysis is the biochemical pathway responsible for the catabolism of triacylglycerol (TAG) stored in cellular lipid droplets. The hydrolytic cleavage of TAG generates non-esterified fatty acids, which are subsequently used as energy substrates, essential precursors for lipid and membrane synthesis, or mediators in cell signaling processes. Consistent with its central importance in lipid and energy homeostasis, lipolysis occurs in essentially all tissues and cell types, it is most abundant, however, in white and brown adipose tissue. Over the last 5years, important enzymes and regulatory protein factors involved in lipolysis have been identified. These include an essential TAG hydrolase named adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) [annotated as patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein A2], the ATGL activator comparative gene identification-58 [annotated as α/β hydrolase containing protein 5], and the ATGL inhibitor G0/G1 switch gene 2. Together with the established hormone-sensitive lipase [annotated as lipase E] and monoglyceride lipase, these proteins constitute the basic "lipolytic machinery". Additionally, a large number of hormonal signaling pathways and lipid droplet-associated protein factors regulate substrate access and the activity of the "lipolysome". This review summarizes the current knowledge concerning the enzymes and regulatory processes governing lipolysis of fat stores in adipose and non-adipose tissues. Special emphasis will be given to ATGL, its regulation, and physiological function.
The surfaces of lipid droplets (LDs) constitute major sites of regulated accumulation and degradation of lipid in cells, and hence play important roles in lipid homeostasis of the whole body. CGI-58 (also called alpha/beta hydrolase domain-containing protein 5 (ABHD5)) is a member of the alpha/beta-hydrolase family of proteins and is a product of the causal gene of Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome (CDS), which is characterized by excessive storage of triacylglycerol (TG) in various tissues. CGI-58 is distributed predominantly on the surface of LDs and plays a crucial role in TG degradation in cells. In the process of lipolysis, CGI-58 coordinates with several proteins, including perilipin, a member of the PAT family of proteins, and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), a putative rate-limiting enzyme for TG degradation in adipocytes. Besides its role in adipocytes, CGI-58 is involved in lipid degradation in various tissues, including those of skin and liver. This review focuses on the functions and protein interactions of CGI-58 on the surface of LDs in the regulation of fat mobilization in cells.
α/β-Hydrolase domain containing 6 (ABHD6) is a transmembrane serine hydrolase that hydrolyzes the endogenous cannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) to regulate certain forms of cannabinoid receptor-dependent signaling in the nervous system. The full spectrum of ABHD6 metabolic activities and functions is currently unknown and would benefit from selective, in vivo-active inhibitors. Here, we report the development and characterization of an advanced series of irreversible (2-substituted)-piperidyl-1,2,3-triazole urea inhibitors of ABHD6, including compounds KT182 and KT203, which show exceptional potency and selectivity in cells (&lt;5 nM) and, at equivalent doses in mice (1 mg kg(-1)), act as systemic and peripherally restricted ABHD6 inhibitors, respectively. We also describe an orally bioavailable ABHD6 inhibitor, KT185, that displays excellent selectivity against other brain and liver serine hydrolases in vivo. We thus describe several chemical probes for biological studies of ABHD6, including brain-penetrant and peripherally restricted inhibitors that should prove of value for interrogating ABHD6 function in animal models. 
Survival in a terrestrial, dry environment necessitates a permeability barrier for regulated permeation of water and electrolytes in the cornified layer of the skin (the stratum corneum) to minimize desiccation of the body. This barrier is formed during cornification and involves a cross-linking of corneocyte proteins as well as an extensive remodeling of lipids. The cleavage of precursor lipids from lamellar bodies by various hydrolytic enzymes generates ceramides, cholesterol, and non-esterified fatty acids for the extracellular lipid lamellae in the stratum corneum. However, the important role of epidermal triacylglycerol (TAG) metabolism during formation of a functional permeability barrier in the skin was only recently discovered. Humans with mutations in the ABHD5/CGI-58 (α/β hydrolase domain containing protein 5, also known as comparative gene identification-58, CGI-58) gene suffer from a defect in TAG catabolism that causes neutral lipid storage disease with ichthyosis. In addition, mice with deficiencies in genes involved in TAG catabolism (Abhd5/Cgi-58 knock-out mice) or TAG synthesis (acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase-2, Dgat2 knock-out mice) also develop severe skin permeability barrier dysfunctions and die soon after birth due to increased dehydration. As a result of these defects in epidermal TAG metabolism, humans and mice lack ω-(O)-acylceramides, which leads to malformation of the cornified lipid envelope of the skin. In healthy skin, this epidermal structure provides an interface for the linkage of lamellar membranes with corneocyte proteins to maintain permeability barrier homeostasis. This review focuses on recent advances in the understanding of biochemical mechanisms involved in epidermal neutral lipid metabolism and the generation of a functional skin permeability barrier. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled The Important Role of Lipids in the Epidermis and their Role in the Formation and Maintenance of the Cutaneous Barrier. Guest Editors: Kenneth R. Feingold and Peter Elias. 
Protein palmitoylation is an essential post-translational modification necessary for trafficking and localization of regulatory proteins that play key roles in cell growth and signaling. Multiple oncogenes, including HRAS and SRC, require palmitoylation for malignant transformation. We [1] and others [2] have previously identified lysophospholipase 1 (LYPLA1) as a candidate protein palmitoyl thioesterase responsible for HRAS depalmitoylation in mammalian cells. Seeking chemical tools to investigate biochemical pathway involvement and potential roles in cancer pathogenesis, we conducted a fluorescence polarization-based competitive activity-based protein profiling (FluoPol ABPP) [3] high throughput screening (HTS) campaign to identify inhibitors of LYPLA1 and the structurally related LYPLA2. HTS identified a micromolar triazole urea inhibitor, that we successfully optimized via several rounds of SAR-by-synthesis as ML211 (SID 99445338), a low nanomolar dual inhibitor of LYPLA1 and LYPLA2. The reported probe operates by a covalent mechanism of action and is active both in vitro and in situ. Out of more than 20 serine hydrolases (SHs) profiled by gel-based competitive activity-based protein profiling (ABPP), ML211 was observed to have one anti-target, alpha/beta hydrolase domain-containing protein 11 (ABHD11). Fortuitously, one of the triazole urea library members synthesized during the course of probe optimization was found to be a potent and selective inhibitor of ABHD11, a poorly characterized SH that is hemizygously deleted in Williams-Beuren syndrome [4], and was presented as a control anti-probe (SID 99445332) in the ML211 Probe Report. The optimized ABHD11 probe ML226 is a potent inhibitor of ABHD11, with an IC50 of 15 nM, and exhibits at least 100-fold selectivity for all other SHs (~20) assessed by gel-based competitive ABPP. The probe is also active in situ, completely and selectively inhibiting ABHD11 at sub-nanomolar concentrations. As with ML211, the probe operates by a covalent mechanism of action, carbamoylating the active site serine of ABHD11. The complete properties, characterization, and synthesis of ML226 are detailed in this Probe Report.
Protein palmitoylation is an essential post-translational modification necessary for trafficking and localization of regulatory proteins that play key roles in cell growth and signaling.

The reported probe operates by a covalent mechanism of action and is active both in vitro and in situ. Out of more than 20 serine hydrolases (SHs) profiled by gel-based competitive ABPP, ML211 is observed to have one anti-target, alpha/beta hydrolase domain-containing protein 11 (ABHD11). However, during our SAR campaign, we fortuitously discovered a selective ABHD11 inhibitor from among the synthetic triazole urea library compounds. This compound, ML226, is presented as an anti-probe for control studies.
Sebaceous carcinoma represents a rare and potentially fatal adnexal malignancy. Poorly-differentiated sebaceous carcinoma consisting of infiltrative basaloid tumor cells with inapparent lipid vesicles can mimic basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Conversely, other epithelial tumors can exhibit clear cell histopathology and mimic sebaceous carcinoma. At the present time, immunohistochemical markers unique for sebaceous carcinoma are limited.
We evaluated the expression of three lipid synthesis/processing protein markers alpha/beta hydrolase domain-containing protein 5 (ABHD5), progesterone receptor membrane component-1 (PGRMC1) and squalene synthase (SQS) in sebaceous carcinoma and investigated their utility in differentiating sebaceous tumors from BCC with clear cell features. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 23 sebaceous carcinomas, 14 sebaceomas and 14 BCCs with clear cell features.
In sebaceous carcinomas, ABHD5 showed dispersed, cytoplasmic punctate and/or vesicular staining (n = 19/23, 83%), while PGRMC1 and SQS each showed vesicular and membranous staining in tumor cells (n = 22/23, 96%). In all sebaceomas, these markers highlighted tightly clustered lipid vesicles in sebocytes. All BCCs with clear cell features were negative for these three markers.
ABHD5, PGRMC1 and SQS are novel markers for sebaceous carcinoma and can reliably distinguish sebaceous neoplasms from non-sebaceous tumors, specifically BCC with clear cell features.
In addition to its functions in thrombosis and hemostasis, thrombin also plays an important role in lung inflammation. Our previous report showed that thrombin activates the protein kinase C (PKC)α/c-Src and Gβγ/Rac1/PI3K/Akt signaling pathways to induce IκB kinase α/β (IKKα/β) activation, NF-κB transactivation, and IL-8/CXCL8 expressions in human lung epithelial cells (ECs). In this study, we further investigated the mechanism of c-Src-dependent Shc, Raf-1, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways involved in thrombin-induced NF-κB activation and IL-8/CXCL8 release. Thrombin-induced increases in IL-8/CXCL8 release and κB-luciferase activity were inhibited by the Shc small interfering RNA (siRNA), p66Shc siRNA, GW 5074 (a Raf-1 inhibitor), and PD98059 (a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK) inhibitor). Treatment of A549 cells with thrombin increased p66Shc and p46/p52Shc phosphorylation at Tyr239/240 and Tyr317, which was inhibited by cell transfection with the dominant negative mutant of c-Src (c-Src DN). Thrombin caused time-dependent phosphorylation of Raf-1 and ERK, which was attenuated by the c-Src DN. Thrombin-induced IKKα/β phosphorylation was inhibited by GW 5074 and PD98059. Treatment of cells with thrombin induced Gβγ, c-Src, and p66Shc complex formation in a time-dependent manner. Taken together, these results show for the first time that thrombin activates Shc, Raf-1, and ERK through Gβγ, c-Src, and Shc complex formation to induce IKKα/β phosphorylation, NF-κB activation, and IL-8/CXCL8 release in human lung ECs.
In the central nervous system, three enzymes belonging to the serine hydrolase family are thought to regulate the life time of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (C20:4) (2-AG). From these, monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) is well characterized and, on a quantitative basis, is the main 2-AG hydrolase. The postgenomic proteins α/β-hydrolase domain containing (ABHD)6 and ABHD12 remain poorly characterized. By applying a sensitive fluorescent glycerol assay, we delineate the substrate preferences of human ABHD6 and ABHD12 in comparison with MAGL. We show that the three hydrolases are genuine MAG lipases; medium-chain saturated MAGs were the best substrates for hABHD6 and hMAGL, whereas hABHD12 preferred the 1 (3)- and 2-isomers of arachidonoylglycerol. Site-directed mutagenesis of the amino acid residues forming the postulated catalytic triad (ABHD6: S148-D278-H306, ABHD12: S246-D333-H372) abolished enzymatic activity as well as labeling with the active site serine-directed fluorophosphonate probe TAMRA-FP. However, the role of D278 and H306 as residues of the catalytic core of ABHD6 could not be verified because none of the mutants showed detectable expression. Inhibitor profiling revealed striking potency differences between hABHD6 and hABHD12, a finding that, when combined with the substrate profiling data, should facilitate further efforts toward the design of potent and selective inhibitors, especially those targeting hABHD12, which currently lacks such inhibitors.
yloQ is one of 11 essential genes in Bacillus subtilis with unknown roles in the physiology of the cell. It encodes a polypeptide of 298 residues with motifs characteristic of GTPases. As a contribution to elucidating its indispensable cellular function, we have solved the crystal structure of YloQ to 1.6 A spacing, revealing a three-domain organisation. At the heart of the molecule is the putative GTPase domain, which exhibits a classical alpha/beta nucleotide-binding fold with a topology very similar to that of Ras and Era. However, as anticipated from the order in which the conserved G protein motifs appear in the sequence, the GTPase domain fold in YloQ is circularly permuted with respect to the classical GTPases. The nucleotide-binding pocket in YloQ is unoccupied, and analysis of the phosphate-binding (P) loop indicates that conformational changes in this region would be needed to accommodate GTP. The GTPase domain is flanked at its N terminus by a beta-barrel domain with an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) fold, and at its C terminus by an alpha-helical domain containing a coordinated zinc ion. This combination of protein modules is unique to YloQ and its orthologues. Sequence comparisons reveal a clustering of conserved basic and aromatic residues on one face of the OB domain, perhaps pointing to a role for YloQ in nucleic acid binding. The zinc ion in the alpha-helical domain is coordinated by three cysteine residues and a histidine residue in a novel ligand organisation. The juxtaposition of the switch I and switch II regions of the G domain and the OB and zinc-binding domains suggests that chemical events at the GTPase active site may be transduced into relative movements of these domains. The pattern of conserved residues and electrostatic surface potential calculations suggest that the OB and/or Zn-binding domains participate in nucleic acid binding consistent with a possible role for YloQ at some stage during mRNA translation.
Overlapping sense/antisense genes orientated in a tail-to-tail manner, often involving only the 3'UTRs, form the majority of gene pairs in mammalian genomes and can lead to the formation of double-stranded RNA that triggers the destruction of homologous mRNAs. Overlapping polyadenylation signal sequences have not been described previously.
An instance of gene overlap has been found involving a shared single functional polyadenylation site. The genes involved are the human alpha/beta hydrolase domain containing gene 1 (ABHD1) and Sec12 genes. The nine exon human ABHD1 gene is located on chromosome 2p23.3 and encodes a 405-residue protein containing a catalytic triad analogous to that present in serine proteases. The Sec12 protein promotes efficient guanine nucleotide exchange on the Sar1 GTPase in the ER. Their sequences overlap for 42 bp in the 3'UTR in an antisense manner. Analysis by 3' RACE identified a single functional polyadenylation site, ATTAAA, within the 3'UTR of ABHD1 and a single polyadenylation signal, AATAAA, within the 3'UTR of Sec12. These polyadenylation signals overlap, sharing three bp. They are also conserved in mouse and rat. ABHD1 was expressed in all tissues and cells examined, but levels of ABHD1 varied greatly, being high in skeletal muscle and testis and low in spleen and fibroblasts.
Mammalian ABHD1 and Sec12 genes contain a conserved 42 bp overlap in their 3'UTR, and share a conserved TTTATTAAA/TTTAATAAA sequence that serves as a polyadenylation signal for both genes. No inverse correlation between the respective levels of ABHD1 and Sec12 RNA was found to indicate that any RNA interference occurred.
Branching enzyme catalyzes the formation of alpha-1,6 branch points in either glycogen or starch. We report the 2.3-A crystal structure of glycogen branching enzyme from Escherichia coli. The enzyme consists of three major domains, an NH(2)-terminal seven-stranded beta-sandwich domain, a COOH-terminal domain, and a central alpha/beta-barrel domain containing the enzyme active site. While the central domain is similar to that of all the other amylase family enzymes, branching enzyme shares the structure of all three domains only with isoamylase. Oligosaccharide binding was modeled for branching enzyme using the enzyme-oligosaccharide complex structures of various alpha-amylases and cyclodextrin glucanotransferase and residues were implicated in oligosaccharide binding. While most of the oligosaccharides modeled well in the branching enzyme structure, an approximate 50 degrees rotation between two of the glucose units was required to avoid steric clashes with Trp(298) of branching enzyme. A similar rotation was observed in the mammalian alpha-amylase structure caused by an equivalent tryptophan residue in this structure. It appears that there are two binding modes for oligosaccharides in these structures depending on the identity and location of this aromatic residue.
Receptors for GM-CSF, IL-3, and IL-5 are composed of two subunits: alpha, which is specific for each cytokine, and betac, which is shared by all. Although the role of betac in signal transduction has been extensively studied, the role of the alpha subunit has remained to be clarified. To analyze the role of the human (h) GM-CSF receptor alpha subunit, we constructed a chimeric receptor subunit composed of extracellular and transmembrane regions of alpha fused with the cytoplasmic region of betac, designated alpha/beta. In BA/F3 cells, chimeric receptor composed of alpha/beta,beta can transduce signals for mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade activation and proliferation in response to hGM-CSF. Although phosphorylation of Jak1 but not of Jak2 occurred with stimulation of hGM-CSF, the dominant-negative Jak2 but not the dominant-negative Jak1 suppresses c-fos promoter activation. To determine whether the chimeric receptor alpha/beta,beta is functional in vivo, we developed transgenic mice expressing the chimeric receptor alpha/beta,beta. Bone marrow cells from the transgenic mice expressing the alpha/beta,beta receptor form not only GM colonies but also various lineages of colonies in response to GM-CSF. In addition, mast cells were produced when bone marrow cells of the transgenic mouse were cultured with hGM-CSF. Thus, it appears that the cytoplasmic region of the alpha subunit is not required for hGM-CSF promoting activities, even in bone marrow cells.
We have developed an automatic protein fingerprinting method for the evaluation of protein structural similarities based on secondary structure element compositions, spatial arrangements, lengths, and topologies. This method can rapidly identify proteins sharing structural homologies as we demonstrate with five test cases: the globins, the mammalian trypsinlike serine proteases, the immunoglobulins, the cupredoxins, and the actinlike ATPase domain-containing proteins. Principal components analysis of the similarity distance matrix calculated from an all-by-all comparison of 1,031 unique chains in the Protein Data Bank has produced a distribution of structures within a high-dimensional structural space. Fifty percent of the variance observed for this distribution is bounded by six axes, two of which encode structural variability within two large families, the immunoglobulins and the trypsinlike serine proteases. Many aspects of the spatial distribution remain stable upon reduction of the database to 140 proteins with minimal family overlap. The axes correlated with specific structural families are no longer observed. A clear hierarchy of organization is seen in the arrangement of protein structures in the universe. At the highest level, protein structures populate regions corresponding to the all-alpha, all-beta, and alpha/beta superfamilies. Large protein families are arranged along family-specific axes, forming local densely populated regions within the space. The lowest level of organization is intrafamilial; homologous structures are ordered by variations in peripheral secondary structure elements or by conformational shifts in the tertiary structure.
Interferon (IFN)-gamma and IFN-alpha/beta induction of the transporter associated with antigen processing-1 (TAP1) promoter was compared in HeLa cells and endothelial cells (ECs). In HeLa cells, IFN-gamma acts through Stat1alpha/Stat1alpha homodimers binding to the gamma activating sequence (GAS) and IFN-alpha/beta acts through Stat1/Stat2/p48 binding to the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE). In ECs, however, IFN-gamma and IFN-alpha/beta act through both the GAS and ISRE. The basis of the IFN signaling crossover in ECs was investigated. HeLa and ECs contain similar ratios of Stat1alpha to Stat2 proteins, and IFN-alpha/beta also activates the same Janus kinases (JAKs) (Jak1 and tyrosine kinase (Tyk) 2 but not Jak2). However, IFN-alpha/beta activates more Stat1alpha than does IFN-gamma in ECs, whereas the reverse occurs in HeLa, and expression of the IFN-alpha/beta receptor-associated phosphatase SHP-1 is much lower in ECs than HeLa cells. Overexpression of SHP-1 in ECs blocks IFN-alpha/beta signaling through GAS, and expression of a dominan negative SHP-1 in HeLa cells permits IFN-alpha/ss signaling through GAS, demonstrating a role for SHP-1 in regulating crossovers between the IFN-alpha/beta and IFN-gamma signaling pathways.
Interferons (IFNs) induce early-response genes by stimulating Janus family (Jak) tyrosine kinases, leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat transcription factors. Previous studies implicated protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) activity in the control of IFN-regulated Jak/Stat signaling, but the specific PTPs responsible remained unidentified. We have found that SH2 domain-containing PTP1 (SHPTP1; also called PTP1C, HCP, or SHP) reversibly associates with the IFN-alpha receptor complex upon IFN addition. Compared with macrophages from normal littermate controls, macrophages from motheaten mice, which lack SHPTP1, show dramatically increased Jak1 and Stat1 alpha tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas Tyk2 and Stat2 activation is largely unaffected. These findings correlate with selectively increased complex formation on a gamma response element, but not an IFN-stimulated response element, in motheaten macrophages. Our results establish that SHPTP1 selectively regulates distinct components of Jak/Stat signal transduction pathways in vivo.
Comparative gene identification-58 (CGI-58), also designated as alpha/beta-hydrolase domain containing-5 (ABHD-5), is a lipid droplet-associated protein that activates adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and acylates lysophosphatidic acid. Activation of ATGL initiates the hydrolytic catabolism of cellular triacylglycerol (TG) stores to glycerol and nonesterified fatty acids. Mutations in both ATGL and CGI-58 cause "neutral lipid storage disease" characterized by massive accumulation of TG in various tissues. The analysis of CGI-58-deficient (Cgi-58(-/-)) mice, presented in this study, reveals a dual function of CGI-58 in lipid metabolism. First, systemic TG accumulation and severe hepatic steatosis in newborn Cgi-58(-/-) mice establish a limiting role for CGI-58 in ATGL-mediated TG hydrolysis and supply of nonesterified fatty acids as energy substrate. Second, a severe skin permeability barrier defect uncovers an essential ATGL-independent role of CGI-58 in skin lipid metabolism. The neonatal lethal skin barrier defect is linked to an impaired hydrolysis of epidermal TG. As a consequence, sequestration of fatty acids in TG prevents the synthesis of acylceramides, which are essential lipid precursors for the formation of a functional skin permeability barrier. This mechanism may also underlie the pathogenesis of ichthyosis in neutral lipid storage disease patients lacking functional CGI-58.
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading viral pathogen associated with bronchiolitis and lower respiratory tract disease in infants and young children worldwide. The respiratory epithelium is the primary initiator of pulmonary inflammation in RSV infections, which cause significant perturbations of global gene expression controlling multiple cellular processes. In this study, differential display reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplification was performed to examine mRNA expression in a human alveolar cell line (SPC-A1) infected with RSV.
Of the 2,500 interpretable bands on denaturing polyacrylamide gels, 40 (1.6%) cDNA bands were differentially regulated by RSV, in which 28 (70%) appeared to be upregulated and another 12 (30%) appeared to be downregulated. Forty of the expressed sequence tags (EST) were isolated, and 20 matched homologs in GenBank. RSV infection upregulated the mRNA expression of chemokines CC and CXC and interfered with type alpha/beta interferon-inducible gene expression by upregulation of MG11 and downregulation of G1P3.
RSV replication could induce widespread changes in gene expression including both positive and negative regulation and play a different role in the down-regulation of IFN-alpha and up-regulation of IFN-gamma inducible gene expression, which suggests that RSV interferes with the innate antiviral response of epithelial cells by multiple mechanisms.
CGI-58 is the causative molecule underlying Dorfman-Chanarin syndrome, a neutral lipid storage disease exhibiting apparent clinical features of ichthyosis. CGI-58, associated with triacylglycerol hydrolysis, has an alpha/beta-hydrolase fold and is also known as the alpha/beta-hydrolase domain-containing protein 5. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the function of CGI-58 and the pathogenic mechanisms of ichthyosis in Dorfman-Chanarin syndrome. Using an anti-CGI-58 antibody, we found CGI-58 to be expressed in the upper epidermis, predominantly in the granular layer cells, as well as in neurons and hepatocytes. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that CGI-58 was also localized to the lamellar granules (LGs), which are lipid transport and secretion granules found in keratinocytes. CGI-58 expression was markedly reduced in the epidermis of patients with harlequin ichthyosis, demonstrating defective LG formation. In cultured keratinocytes, CGI-58 expression was mildly up-regulated under high Ca(2+) conditions and markedly up-regulated in three-dimensional, organotypic cultures. In the developing human epidermis, CGI-58 immunostaining was observed at an estimated gestational age of 49 days, and CGI-58 mRNA expression was up-regulated concomitantly with both epidermal stratification and keratinocyte differentiation. CGI-58 knockdown reduced expression of keratinocyte differentiation/keratinization markers in cultured human keratinocytes. Our results indicate that CGI-58 is expressed and packaged into LGs during keratinization and likely plays crucial role(s) in keratinocyte differentiation and LG lipid metabolism, contributing to skin lipid barrier formation.
We previously reported that the mouse alpha/beta hydrolase domain containing 2 (Abhd2) was expressed in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) which suppressed their migration and inhibited the development of intimal hyperplasia by cuff placement; however, the role of ABHD2 in human remains to be elucidated. In this study, we examined ABHD2 expression in the human coronary atherosclerotic lesions of the patients with unstable angina (UA) and stable angina (SA). Our results showed that the ABHD2 was expressed in atherosclerotic lesions, and that the ABHD2 expression was significantly higher in the patients with UA than with SA. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed abundant expression of ABHD2 in macrophages, but low expression in SMCs of atherosclerotic lesions. Using human vascular primary culture cell lines, we also demonstrated that the expression of ABHD2 was significantly higher in macrophages than in SMCs, and that the expression of ABHD2 significantly increased proportionally with differentiation from monocyte into macrophage.
