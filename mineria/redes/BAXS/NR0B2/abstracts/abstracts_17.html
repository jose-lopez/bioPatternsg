<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>	<meta charset="utf-8">	<title>generación de archivo html</title></head><body>Skin is constantly exposed to UV-radiation, the most critical risk factor for melanoma development. Hyaluronan is abundant in the epidermal extracellular matrix and may undergo degradation by UV-radiation. It is hypothesized that an intact hyaluronan coat around the cells protects against various agents including UV-radiation, while hyaluronan fragments promote inflammation and tumorigenesis. We investigated whether hyaluronan contributes to the UVB-induced inflammatory responses in primary melanocytes. A single dose of UVB suppressed hyaluronan secretion and the expression of hyaluronan synthases HAS2, HAS3, the hyaluronan receptor CD44 and the hyaluronidase HYAL2, as well as induced the expression of inflammatory mediators IL-6, IL-8, CXCL-1 and CXCL-10. Silencing HAS2 and CD44 partly inhibited the inflammatory response, suggesting that hyaluronan coat is involved in the process. UVB alone caused little changes in the coat, while its removal with hyaluronidase during the recovery from UVB-exposure dramatically enhanced the surge of these inflammatory mediators via TLR-4, p38 and NF-κB. Interestingly, exogenous hyaluronan fragments did not reproduce the inflammatory effects of hyaluronidase. We hypothesize that the hyaluronan coat on melanocytes is a sensor of tissue injury. Combined with UVB-exposure, repeated injuries to the hyaluronan coat could maintain a sustained inflammatory state associated with melanomagenesis.
This cross-sectional study analysed the association of sedentary behaviour (SB) and standing with waist circumference. Finnish adults aged 30-75 years from a sub-sample of population-based Health 2011 Study used a hip-worn tri-axial accelerometer (Hookie AM20, Traxmeet, Ltd, Espoo, Finland) for seven days. Those 1405 participants (57% women) who used accelerometer at least four days, minimum of 10 hours/day, were included. SB and standing were analysed in 6s epochs using validated algorithm. Daily total time, daily number and accumulated time from bouts (30s-5min,30s-10min,30s-15min,30s 30min,&gt;5min,&gt;10min,&gt;15min, &gt;30min) as well as daily number of sit-to-stand transitions were determined. Waist circumference (cm) was measured in standardized way. Participants' mean age was 52 years (SD 12.2). Mean waist circumference was 97cm (SD 12.3) in men and 87cm (SD 12.7) in women. According to multivariable stepwise linear regression analysis, sit-to-stand transitions [standardised regression coefficient (β)= -0.14, 95%CI -0.20 to -0.09], standing bouts of 30s-5min (β= -0.21, 95%CI -0.26 to -0.15) and number of 30s-30min SB bouts (β=0.12, 95%CI 0.06 to 0.17) were most strongly associated with waist circumference. Besides assessing total SB time, future studies should assess also different bout lengths of SB and sit-to-stand transitions and standing times should be assessed separately.

Over the recent decade, benefits of continuous manufacturing (CM) of pharmaceutical products have been acknowledged widely. In contrast to batch processes, the product is not physically separated into batches in CM, which creates a few challenges. Product release is done for batches that should have a uniform quality over time, materials need to be tracked along the line, and locations to reject product must be established. To enable these, the residence time distributions (RTDs) of all unit operations must be known. In this paper, three CM tableting lines, each employing a different granulation technique, were investigated. The RTDs of their main unit operations were characterized, utilizing different measurement techniques successfully. All of these RTD measurement techniques could have been performed in any of the lines. The differences were related to the techniques themselves. Overall, external tracer with in-line Near-Infrared detection or color tracer with video recording proved most usable techniques, with few limitations. The RTDs for full lines were calculated by convoluting the unit operation RTDs, which enables material tracking through entire lines. The lines exhibited both truly continuous and quasi-continuous unit operations. Quasi-continuous unit operations divide the material stream into lots that can be utilized for tracking and rejection.
Sleep, in addition to its brain restorative processes, plays an important role in memory transfer from its temporary store in the hippocampus to the more permanent storage in the neocortex. Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects memory and sleep. The aim of this study was to explore disturbances in global and local synchrony patterns between brain regions in the APP/PS1 mouse model of the AD during natural sleep. We used 8 male APPswe/PS1dE9 mice and 6 wild-type littermates, aged 5-6 months, with multiple electrode bundles implanted into cortical regions, thalamus and hippocampus. We measured video-EEG in freely moving animals and analyzed synchrony during NREM vs REM sleep. Global synchrony between medial frontal cortex and hippocampus measured with magnitude-squared coherence was slightly decreased in delta range during NREM stage of sleep in APP/PS1 mice. In contrast, local hippocampal synchrony measured with cross-frequency coupling remained intact. Ripple structure or frequency did not differ between the genotypes. However, the coupling of the spindle-band power peak in the medial prefrontal cortex to hippocampal ripples was significantly decreased compared to wild-type animals. The delicate timing of hippocampal ripples, frontal delta, and corticothalamic spindle oscillations may be the first sign of impaired memory in amyloid plaque-forming transgenic mice.
An important problem that hinders the use of supervised classification algorithms for brain imaging is that the number of variables per single subject far exceeds the number of training subjects available. Deriving multivariate measures of variable importance becomes a challenge in such scenarios. This paper proposes a new measure of variable importance termed sign-consistency bagging (SCB). The SCB captures variable importance by analyzing the sign consistency of the corresponding weights in an ensemble of linear support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Further, the SCB variable importances are enhanced by means of transductive conformal analysis. This extra step is important when the data can be assumed to be heterogeneous. Finally, the proposal of these SCB variable importance measures is completed with the derivation of a parametric hypothesis test of variable importance. The new importance measures were compared with a t-test based univariate and an SVM-based multivariate variable importances using anatomical and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. The obtained results demonstrated that the new SCB based importance measures were superior to the compared methods in terms of reproducibility and classification accuracy.
Metformin, the most frequently administered oral anti-diabetic drug, is a substrate for organic cation transporters (OCTs). This determines not only its pharmacokinetic properties but also its biochemical effects in humans, including its recently-discovered antiproliferative properties. The aim of the study was to verify the hypothesis whether chemical modification of its biguanide backbone may increase the cellular uptake and antiproliferative efficacy of metformin. The study examines five sulfenamide derivatives of metformin with differing lengths of alkyl chains. It determines their cellular uptake and the role of OCTs in their transport in human breast adenocarcinoma cells (epithelial-like MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231). It also evaluates whether increased cellular uptake of metformin derivatives is associated with their cytotoxic properties. Sulfenamide derivatives were characterized by a greater ability to bind to OCTs than metformin. Compound 2 with n-octyl alkyl chain was found to possess the greatest affinity towards OCTs, as measured by determination of [14C]choline uptake inhibition (IC50 = 236.1 ± 1.28 μmol/L, and 217.4 ± 1.33 μmol/L, for MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 respectively). Sulfenamides were also found to exhibit better cellular uptake in comparison with the parent drug, metformin. For instance, the uptake of cyclohexyl derivative 1 was 1.28 ± 0.19 nmol/min/mg of proteins and thus was 12-fold higher than the metformin in MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, higher uptake was associated with the greatest antiproliferative properties expressed as the lowest IC50 value i.e. inhibiting the growth of 50% of the cells (IC50 = 0.72 ± 1.31 μmol/L). Collectively, chemical modification of metformin into sulfenamides with different alkyl substituents obtains better substrates for OCTs, and subsequently higher cellular uptake in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Additionally, the length of alkyl chain introduced to the sulfenamides was found to influence selectivity and transport efficiency via OCT1 compared to other possible transporters, as well as potential intracellular activity and cytotoxicity.
CD44 is a multifunctional adhesion molecule typically upregulated in malignant, inflamed and injured tissues. Due to its ability to bind multiple ligands present in the tumor microenvironment, it promotes multiple cellular functions related to tumorigenesis. Recent data has shown that CD44 and its principal ligand hyaluronan (HA) are carried by extracellular vesicles (EV) derived from stem and tumor cells, but the role of CD44 in EV shedding has not been studied so far. To answer this question, we utilized CD44-negative human gastric carcinoma cell line MKN74 manipulated to stably express CD44 standard form (CD44s). The effect of CD44s expression on HA metabolism, EV secretion, morphology and growth of these cells was studied. Interestingly, HAS2 and HYAL2 expression levels were significantly upregulated in CD44s-expressing cells. Cell-associated HA levels were significantly increased, while HA levels in the culture medium of CD44s-positive cells was lower compared to CD44s-negative MOCK cells. CD44s expression had no significant effect on the proliferation capacity of cells, but cells showed diminished contact inhibition. Superresolution imaging revealed that CD44s and HA were accumulated on filopodia and EVs secreted from CD44s-positive cells, but no differences in total numbers of secreted EV between CD44s-negative and -positive cells was detected. In 3D cultures, CD44s-expressing cells had an enhanced invasion capacity in BME gel and increased spheroidal growth when cultured in collagen I gel. No significant differences in mitotic activity, tumor size or morphology were detected in CAM assays. However, a significant increase in HA staining coverage was detected in CD44s-positive tumors. Interestingly, CD44s-positive EVs embedded in HA-rich matrix were detected in the stromal areas of tumors. The results indicate that CD44s expression significantly increases the HA binding capacity of gastric cancer cells, while the secreted HA is downregulated. CD44s is also carried by EVs secreted by CD44s-expressing cells. These findings highlight the potential usefulness of CD44s and its ligands as multipurpose EV biomarkers, because they are upregulated in inflammatory, injured, and cancer cells and accumulate on the surface of EVs secreted in these situations.
We investigated whether exposure to intermediate frequency magnetic fields (IF MFs) could induce or enhance genomic instability in primary astrocytes. Rat primary astrocytes were exposed to vertical or horizontal 7.5 kHz, 300 μT MF for 24 h. To study possible combined effects with known genotoxic agents, the cells were exposed for 3 h to menadione or methyl methanesulfonate after the MF treatment. Induced genomic instability was evaluated 36 days after exposures using the Comet assay and flow cytometric scoring of micronuclei. Exposure to 7.5 kHz, 300 μT MF did not induce genomic instability alone or in combination with chemicals in measurements performed several cell generations after exposure.
Nutrigenomics studies how environmental factors, such as food intake and lifestyle, influence the expression of the genome. Vitamin D₃ represents a master example of nutrigenomics, since via its metabolite 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D₃, which binds with high-affinity to the vitamin D receptor, the secosteroid directly affects the epigenome and transcriptome at thousands of loci within the human genome. Vitamin D is important for both cellular metabolism and immunity, as it controls calcium homeostasis and modulates the response of the innate and adaptive immune system. At sufficient UV-B exposure, humans can synthesize vitamin D₃ endogenously in their skin, but today's lifestyle often makes the molecule a true vitamin and micronutrient that needs to be taken up by diet or supplementation with pills. The individual's molecular response to vitamin D requires personalized supplementation with vitamin D₃, in order to obtain optimized clinical benefits in the prevention of osteoporosis, sarcopenia, autoimmune diseases, and possibly different types of cancer. The importance of endogenous synthesis of vitamin D₃ created an evolutionary pressure for reduced skin pigmentation, when, during the past 50,000 years, modern humans migrated from Africa towards Asia and Europe. This review will discuss different aspects of how vitamin D interacts with the human genome, focusing on nutritional epigenomics in context of immune responses. This should lead to a better understanding of the clinical benefits of vitamin D.
The enhanced expression of T cell Ig and mucin protein-3 (TIM-3) on tumor-associated dendritic cells (DCs) attenuates antitumor effects of DNA vaccines. To identify a potential target (or targets) for reducing TIM-3 expression on tumor-associated DCs, we explored the molecular mechanisms regulating TIM-3 expression. In this study, we have identified a novel signaling pathway (c-Src→Bruton's tyrosine kinase→transcription factors Ets1, Ets2, USF1, and USF2) necessary for TIM-3 upregulation on DCs. Both IL-10 and TGF-β, which are produced in the tumor microenvironment, upregulated TIM-3 expression on DCs via this pathway. Suppressed expression of c-Src or downstream Bruton's tyrosine kinase, Ets1, Ets2, USF1, or USF2 blocked IL-10- and TGF-β-induced TIM-3 upregulation on DCs. Notably, in vivo knockdown of c-Src in mice reduced TIM-3 expression on tumor-associated DCs. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of c-Src-silenced DCs in mouse tumors enhanced the in vivo antitumor effects of immunostimulatory CpG DNA; however, TIM-3 overexpression in c-Src-silenced DCs blocked this effect. Collectively, our data reveal the molecular mechanism regulating TIM-3 expression in DCs and identify c-Src as a target for improving the efficacy of nucleic acid-mediated anticancer therapy.
The modulation of chromatin structure is a key step in transcription regulation in mammalian cells and eventually determines lineage commitment and differentiation. USF1/2, Setd1a and NURF complexes interact to regulate chromatin architecture in erythropoiesis, but the mechanistic basis for this regulation is hitherto unknown. Here we showed that Setd1a and NURF complexes bind to promoters to control chromatin structural alterations and gene activation in a cell context dependent manner. In human primary erythroid cells USF1/2, H3K4me3 and the NURF complex were significantly co-enriched at transcription start sites of erythroid genes, and their binding was associated with promoter/enhancer accessibility that resulted from nucleosome repositioning. Mice deficient for Setd1a, an H3K4 trimethylase, in the erythroid compartment exhibited reduced Ter119/CD71 positive erythroblasts, peripheral blood RBCs and hemoglobin levels. Loss of Setd1a led to a reduction of promoter-associated H3K4 methylation, inhibition of gene transcription and blockade of erythroid differentiation. This was associated with alterations in NURF complex occupancy at erythroid gene promoters and reduced chromatin accessibility. Setd1a deficiency caused decreased associations between enhancer and promoter looped interactions as well as reduced expression of erythroid genes such as the adult β-globin gene. These data indicate that Setd1a and NURF complexes are specifically targeted to and coordinately regulate erythroid promoter chromatin dynamics during erythroid lineage differentiation.
Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) make lung adenocarcinoma cells sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Long-term cancer therapy may cause the occurrence of acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in tumor formation, tumor metastasis and the development of EGFR-TKI resistance in lung cancer. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of EGFR-TKI resistance, we generated an EGFR-TKI-resistant HCC827-8-1 cell line and analyzed expression patterns by lncRNA microarray and compared it with its parental HCC827 cell line. A total of 1,476 lncRNA transcripts and 1,026 mRNA transcripts were dysregulated in the HCC827‑8-1 cells. The expression levels of 7 chosen lncRNAs were validated by real-time quantitative PCR. As indicated by functional analysis, several groups of lncRNAs may be involved in the bio-pathways associated with EGFR-TKI resistance through their cis- and/or trans‑regulation of protein-coding genes. Thus, lncRNAs may be used as novel candidate biomarkers and potential targets in EGFR-TKI therapy in the future. 
The organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) transports cationic drugs into hepatocytes. The high hepatic expression of OCT1 is controlled by the HNF4α and USF transcription factors. Pregnane X receptor (PXR) mediates induction of the principal xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes and transporters in the liver. Here, we have assessed the down-regulation of OCT1 expression by PXR activation.
We used primary human hepatocytes and related cell lines to measure OCT1 expression and activity, by assaying MPP(+) accumulation. Western blotting, qRT-PCR, the OCT1 promoter gene reporter constructs and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were also used.
OCT1 mRNA in human hepatocytes was down-regulated along with reduced [(3) H]MPP(+) accumulation in differentiated HepaRG cells after treatment with rifampicin. Rifampicin and hyperforin as well as the constitutively active PXR mutant T248D suppressed activity of the 1.8 kb OCT1 promoter construct in gene reporter assays. Silencing of both PXR and HNF4α in HepaRG cells blocked the PXR ligand-mediated down-regulation of OCT1 expression. The mutation of HNF4α and USF1 (E-box) responsive elements reversed the PXR-mediated inhibition in gene reporter assays. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that PXR activation sequestrates the SRC-1 coactivator from the HNF4α response element and E-box of the OCT1 promoter. Consistent with these findings, exogenous overexpression of the SRC-1, but not the PGC1α coactivator, relieved the PXR-mediated repression of OCT1 transactivation.
PXR ligands reduced the HNF4α-mediated and USF-mediated transactivation of OCT1 gene expression by competing for SRC-1 and decreased delivery of a model OCT1 substrate into hepatocytes.
USF1 (upstream stimulatory factor 1) is a transcription factor associated with familial combined hyperlipidemia and coronary artery disease in humans. However, whether USF1 is beneficial or detrimental to cardiometabolic health has not been addressed. By inactivating USF1 in mice, we demonstrate protection against diet-induced dyslipidemia, obesity, insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and atherosclerosis. The favorable plasma lipid profile, including increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and decreased triglycerides, was coupled with increased energy expenditure due to activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT). Usf1 inactivation directs triglycerides from the circulation to BAT for combustion via a lipoprotein lipase-dependent mechanism, thus enhancing plasma triglyceride clearance. Mice lacking Usf1 displayed increased BAT-facilitated, diet-induced thermogenesis with up-regulation of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, as well as increased BAT activity even at thermoneutrality and after BAT sympathectomy. A direct effect of USF1 on BAT activation was demonstrated by an amplified adrenergic response in brown adipocytes after Usf1 silencing, and by augmented norepinephrine-induced thermogenesis in mice lacking Usf1. In humans, individuals carrying SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism) alleles that reduced USF1 mRNA expression also displayed a beneficial cardiometabolic profile, featuring improved insulin sensitivity, a favorable lipid profile, and reduced atherosclerosis. Our findings identify a new molecular link between lipid metabolism and energy expenditure, and point to the potential of USF1 as a therapeutic target for cardiometabolic disease. 
Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G, A3G) exert antiviral defense as an important factor of innate immunity. A variety of cytokines such as IFN-γ、IL2、IL15、IL7 could induce the transcription of A3G. However, the regulation of other nuclear factor on the transcription of A3G have not been reported at the present. To gain new insights into the transcriptional regulation of this restriction factor, we cloned and characterized the promoter region of A3G and investigate the modulation of USF1 gene on the transcription of A3G. We identified a 232 bp region that was sufficient to regulate the activity of full promoter. Transcriptional start sites (TSS) were identified by the luciferase reporter assays of plasmids containing full or shorter fragments of the A3G promoter. The results demonstrated that the core promoter of A3G is located within the region -159/-84 relative to the TSS. Transcriptional activity of A3G core promoter regulated by USF1 was dependent on an E-box (located at position -91/-86 relative to the major TSS) and was abolished after mutation of this DNA element. USF1 gene can take part in basal transcription regulation of the human A3G gene in hepatocyte, and the identified E-box represented a binding site for the USF1. 
The upstream transcription factors (USFs) USF1 and USF2 are ubiquitously expressed transcription factors that are characterized by a conserved basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper DNA-binding domain. They form homo- or heterodimers, and recognize E-box motifs to modulate gene expression. They are known to regulate diverse cellular functions, including the cell cycle, immune responses and glucose/lipid metabolism, but their roles in neuronal cells remain to be clarified. Here, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation of USF1 from mouse brain cortex. Subsequent promoter array analysis (ChIP-chip) indicated that USF1 exclusively bound to the CACGTG E-box motifs in the proximal promoter regions. Importantly, functional annotation of the USF1-binding targets revealed an enrichment of genes related to lysosomal functions. Gene expression array analysis using a neuronal cell line subsequently revealed that knockdown of USFs de-regulated lysosomal gene expression. Altered expression was validated by quantitative RT-PCR, supporting the conclusion that USFs regulate lysosomal gene expression. Furthermore, USF knockdown slightly increased LysoTracker Red staining, implying a role for USFs in modulating lysosomal homeostasis. Together, our comprehensive genome-scale analyses identified lysosomal genes as targets of USFs in neuronal cells, suggesting a potential additional pathway of lysosomal regulation.
The data for the gene expression array and ChIP-chip have been submitted to the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession numbers GSE76615 and GSE76616, respectively.
This study was designed to explore the effects of tobacco smoke on gene expression through bioinformatics analyses. Gene expression profile GSE17913 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in buccal mucosa tissues between 39 active smokers and 40 never smokers were identified. Gene Ontology Specifically, the DEG distribution in the pathway of Metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450 was shown in Fig 2[corrected] were performed, followed by protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, transcriptional regulatory network as well as miRNA-target regulatory network construction. In total, 88 up-regulated DEGs and 106 down-regulated DEGs were identified. Among these DEGs, cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (CYP1A1) and CYP1B1 were enriched in the Metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450 pathway. In the PPI network, tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, zeta (YWHAZ), and CYP1A1 were hub genes. In the transcriptional regulatory network, transcription factors of MYC associated factor X (MAX) and upstream transcription factor 1 (USF1) regulated many overlapped DEGs. In addition, protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type, D (PTPRD) was regulated by multiple miRNAs in the miRNA-DEG regulatory network. CYP1A1, CYP1B1, YWHAZ and PTPRD, and TF of MAX and USF1 may have the potential to be used as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in tobacco smoke-related pathological changes.
The functions of the upstream stimulatory factors USF1 and USF2 are, like those of other transcription factors, regulated by reversible phosphorylation. Besides many other kinases also protein kinase CK2 phosphorylates USF1 but not USF2. In a yeast-two-hybrid screen, however, the non-catalytic CK2β subunit of CK2 was identified as a binding partner of USF2. This surprising observation prompted us to investigate the CK2/USF interaction in more detail in the present study. By using immunofluorescence analyses as well as co-immunoprecipitations we found that USF1 and USF2 bound to CK2α and CK2β exclusively in the nucleus, though CK2β and to a minor amount CK2α were also present in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, we found that unlike other substrates the phosphorylation of USF1 required the presence of the regulatory CK2β subunit; the catalytic α-subunit of CK2 alone was not able to phosphorylate USF1. Thus, the correct phosphorylation of USF1 is only guaranteed and strictly controlled in particular by nuclear CK2β. Although the data indicated that a nuclear subfraction of CK2 subunits associated with USF proteins, DNA pull down experiments revealed that the CK2 subunits did not co-localize with DNA bound USF proteins indicating that the USF/CK2 interaction has a pre- or post DNA binding function. 
We investigated the potential melanogenic effect of compounds from Zingiber cassumunar Roxb. Our data revealed that chloroform-soluble extract of Z. cassumunar enhanced melanin synthesis in B16F10 melanoma cells. Among the components of the chloroform extract, (E)-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-1-ol (DMPB) increased melanogenesis in both B16F10 cells and human primary melanocytes. In B16F10 cells, DMPB enhanced the activation of ERK and p38, and the level of tyrosinase. Although the level of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor was unchanged in DMPB-treated B16F10 cells, DMPB increased levels and nuclear localization of upstream stimulating factor-1 (USF1). Consistently, DMPB-mediated melanin synthesis was diminished in USF1-knockdown cells. Furthermore, DMPB induced hyperpigmentation in brown guinea pigs in vivo. Together, these data suggest that DMPB may promote melanin synthesis via USF1 dependent fashion and could be used as a clinical therapeutic agent against hypopigmentation-associated diseases. 
The identification and investigation of novel clock-controlled genes (CCGs) has been conducted thus far mainly in model organisms such as nocturnal rodents, with limited information in humans. Here, we aimed to characterize daily and circadian expression rhythms of CCGs in human peripheral blood during a sleep/sleep deprivation (S/SD) study and a constant routine (CR) study. Blood expression levels of 9 candidate CCGs (SREBF1, TRIB1, USF1, THRA1, SIRT1, STAT3, CAPRIN1, MKNK2, and ROCK2), were measured across 48 h in 12 participants in the S/SD study and across 33 h in 12 participants in the CR study. Statistically significant rhythms in expression were observed for STAT3, SREBF1, TRIB1, and THRA1 in samples from both the S/SD and the CR studies, indicating that their rhythmicity is driven by the endogenous clock. The MKNK2 gene was significantly rhythmic in the S/SD but not the CR study, which implies its exogenously driven rhythmic expression. In addition, we confirmed the circadian expression of PER1, PER3, and REV-ERBα in the CR study samples, while BMAL1 and HSPA1B were not significantly rhythmic in the CR samples; all 5 genes previously showed significant expression in the S/SD study samples. Overall, our results demonstrate that rhythmic expression patterns of clock and selected clock-controlled genes in human blood cells are in part determined by exogenous factors (sleep and fasting state) and in part by the endogenous circadian timing system. Knowledge of the exogenous and endogenous regulation of gene expression rhythms is needed prior to the selection of potential candidate marker genes for future applications in medical and forensic settings. 
The ATP-binding cassette transporter-2 (ABCA2) is a member of a family of multipass transmembrane proteins that use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to transport substrates across membrane bilayers. ABCA2 has also been genetically linked with Alzheimer's disease but the molecular mechanisms are unknown. In this report, we hypothesized that ABCA2 modulation of sphingolipid metabolism activates a signaling pathway that regulates amyloid precursor protein transcription. We found that ABCA2 overexpression in N2a cells was associated with increased mass of the sphingolipid sphingosine, derived from the catabolism of ceramide. ABCA2 overexpression increased in vitro alkaline and acid ceramidase activity. Sphingosine is a physiological inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC) activity. Pharmacological inhibition of ceramidase activity or activation PKC activity with 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or diacylglycerol (DAG) decreased endogenous APP mRNA levels in ABCA2 overexpressing cells. Treatment with PMA also decreased the expression of a transfected human APP promoter reporter construct, while treatment with a general PKC inhibitor, GF109203x, increased APP promoter activity. In N2a cells, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that a repressive complex forms at the AP-1 site in the human APP promoter, consisting of c-jun, c-jun dimerization protein 2 (JDP2) and HDAC3 and this complex was reduced in ABCA2 overexpressing cells. Activation of the human APP promoter in A2 cells was directed by the upstream stimulatory factors USF-1 and USF-2 that bound to an E-box element in vivo. These findings indicate that ABCA2 overexpression modulates sphingosine levels and regulates transcription of the endogenous APP gene. 
During its lytic cycle, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) expresses Rta, a factor encoded by BRLF1 that activates the transcription of viral lytic genes. We found that upstream stimulating factor (USF) binds to E1, one of the five E boxes located at - 79 in the BRLF1 promoter (Rp), to activate BRLF1 transcription. Furthermore, Rta was shown to interact with USF1 in coimmunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-pulldown assays, and confocal laser-scanning microscopy further confirmed that these two proteins colocalize in the nucleus. Rta was also found to bind with the E1 sequence in a biotin-labelled E1 probe, but only in the presence of USF1, suggesting that these two proteins likely form a complex on E1. We subsequently constructed p188mSZ, a reporter plasmid that contained the sequence from - 188 to +5 in Rp, within which the Sp1 site and Zta response element were mutated. In EBV-negative Akata cells cotransfected with p188mSZ and plasmids expressing USF1 and Rta, synergistic activation of Rp transcription was observed. However, after mutating the E1 sequence in p188mSZ, USF1 and Rta were no longer able to transactivate Rp, indicating that Rta autoregulates BRLF1 transcription via its interaction with USF1 on E1. This study showed that pUSF1 transfection after EBV lytic induction in P3HR1 cells increases Rta expression, indicating that USF1 activates Rta expression after the virus enters the lytic cycle. Together, these results reveal a novel mechanism by which USF interacts with Rta to promote viral lytic development, and provide additional insight into the viral-host interactions of EBV. 
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the USF1 gene (upstream stimulatory factor 1) influence plasma lipid levels. This study aims to determine whether USF1 SNPs interact with traditional risk factors of atherosclerosis to increase coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. In the present study serum lipid levels and USF1 gene polymorphisms (rs2516839 and rs3737787) were determined in 470 subjects: 235 patients with premature CAD and 235 controls. A trend of increasing triglycerides (TG) levels in relation to the C allele dose of rs2516839 SNP was observed. The synergistic effect of cigarette smoking and C allele carrier state on CAD risk was also found (SIM = 2.69, p = 0.015). TG levels differentiated significantly particular genotypes in smokers (1.53 mmol/L for TT, 1.80 mmol/L for CT and 2.27 mmol/L for CC subjects). In contrast, these differences were not observed in the non-smokers subgroup (1.57 mmol/L for TT, 1.46 mmol/L for CT and 1.49 mmol/L for CC subjects). In conclusion, the rs2516839 polymorphism may modulate serum triglyceride levels in response to cigarette smoking. Carriers of the C allele seem to be particularly at risk of CAD, when exposed to cigarette smoking. 
Thyroid cancer, predominantly by papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), is a malignant tumour of endocrine system with increasing incidence rate worldwide. Upstream transcription factor 1 (USF1) regulates a variety of biological processes by transactivation of functional genes. In this study, we investigated the association between USF1 polymorphisms and PTC risk.
A total of 334 patients with PTC, 186 patients with benign nodules (BN) and 668 healthy controls were enrolled in our study. Tag-SNPs were identified in Chinese Han in Beijing (CHB) from International HapMap Project Databases. Genomic DNAs were extracted by TaqMan Blood DNA kits. SNPs of USF1 were genotyped by TaqMan SNPs genotyping assay. Odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to assess the association between USF1 genetic variants and PTC risk. The statistical analyses were carried out with spss 13.0 software.
Five tag-SNPs were retrieved to capture all the genetic variants of USF1. Among the five tag-SNPs, genetic variants in rs2516838, rs3737787 and rs2516839 have significant association with PTC risk. The rs2516838 polymorphisms dominant model (CG+GG vs CC: OR = 0·71; 95% CI: 0·52-0·97; P = 0·033) and allelic model (C vs G: OR = 0·031; 95% CI: 0·56-0·97; P = 0·031) indicated it may act as a protective factor against PTC. On the contrary, the results of rs3737787 polymorphisms: dominant model (CT+TT vs CC: OR = 1·55; 95%CI: 1·09-2·02; P = 0·001) and allelic model (C vs T: OR = 1·35; 95%CI: 1·10-1·64; P = 0·003), as well as the results of rs2516839 polymorphisms: dominant model (GA+AA vs GG: OR = 1·77; 95%CI: 1·31-2·38; P &lt; 0·001) and allelic model (G vs A: OR = 1·36; 95%CI: 1·13-1·63; P = 0·014), revealed that they may act as risk factors for PTC.
In this study, we found the SNPs of rs2516838 (mutant G alleles vs wild C alleles), rs3737787 (mutant T alleles vs wild C alleles) and rs2516839 (mutant A alleles vs wild G alleles) were significantly associated with PTC risk. Further large-scale studies with different ethnicities are still needed to validate our findings and explore the underlying mechanism of USF1 in PTC development.
Genetic polymorphisms in upstream transcription factor 1 (USF1) were investigated for their links to increased risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in Chinese population. Between January 2013 and April 2014, 174 patients with NAFLD in the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University were selected for this study. A group of 100 healthy subjects were identified as the control group. The MALDI-TOF-MS, a mass spectrometry based technique, was used to detect USF-1 genetic polymorphisms using PCR amplified DNA products. Furthermore, Automatic Chemistry Analyzer (ACA) was used to determine the clinical indicators. Genotypes, allele frequencies and clinical indicators were measured to assess NAFLD risk in relation to the SNPs. USF-1 rs6427573 genetic polymorphisms were associated with an increased risk of NAFLD (AA vs. GG: OR = 3.16, 95% CI = 1.56-6.43, P = 0.001; GA + AA vs. GG: OR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.13-3.09, P = 0.015; GG + AA vs. AA: OR = 2.96, 95% CI = 1.49-5.88, P = 0.001; G vs. A: OR = 2.10, 95% CI = 1.43-3.09, P &lt; 0.001). Similarly, rs2516839 polymorphisms also conferred a risk for NAFLD (AA vs. GG: OR = 2.49, 95% CI = 1.43-4.34, P = 0.001; GA + AA vs. GG: OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.02-2.78, P = 0.041). On the other hand, rs3737787 and rs2774279 showed no statistical significances in the NAFLD group and control group (P &gt; 0.05). Two USF-1 genetic polymorphisms, rs6427573 and rs2516839, may present an increased risk of NAFLD. 
The upstream stimulatory factors (USFs) are regulators of important cellular processes. Both USF1 and USF2 are supposed to have major roles in metabolism, tissue protection and tumor development. However, the knowledge about the mechanisms that control the function of USFs, in particular in tissue protection and cancer, is limited. Phosphorylation is a versatile tool to regulate protein functions. Thereby, phosphorylation can positively or negatively affect different aspects of transcription factor function including protein stability, protein-protein interaction, cellular localization, or DNA binding. The present review aims to summarize the current knowledge about the regulation of USFs by direct phosphorylation and the consequences for USF functions in tissue protection and cancer. 
Fetal and subsequent early postnatal iron deficiency causes persistent impairments in cognitive and affective behaviors despite prompt postnatal iron repletion. The long-term cognitive impacts are accompanied by persistent downregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a factor critical for hippocampal plasticity across the life span. This study determined whether early-life iron deficiency epigenetically modifies the Bdnf locus and whether dietary choline supplementation during late gestation reverses these modifications. DNA methylation and histone modifications were assessed at the Bdnf-IV promoter in the hippocampus of rats [at postnatal day (PND) 65] that were iron-deficient (ID) during the fetal-neonatal period. Iron deficiency was induced in rat pups by providing pregnant and nursing dams an ID diet (4 mg/kg Fe) from gestational day (G) 2 through PND7, after which iron deficiency was treated with an iron-sufficient (IS) diet (200 mg/kg Fe). This paradigm resulted in about 60% hippocampal iron loss on PND15 with complete recovery by PND65. For choline supplementation, pregnant rat dams were given dietary choline (5 g/kg) from G11 through G18. DNA methylation was determined by quantitative sequencing of bisulfite-treated DNA, revealing a small alteration at the Bdnf-IV promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed increased HDAC1 binding accompanied by reduced binding of RNA polymerase II and USF1 at the Bdnf-IV promoter in formerly ID rats. These changes were correlated with altered histone methylations. Prenatal choline supplementation reverses these epigenetic modifications. Collectively, the findings identify epigenetic modifications as a potential mechanism to explicate the long-term repression of Bdnf following fetal and early postnatal iron deficiency. 
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide with high mortality rate. Upstream transcription factor 1 (USF1) is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involving in different biological processes, including cancer. The aim of this study is to examine the correlation between USF1 polymorphisms and HCC susceptibility. Ninety-four HCC patients and 100 healthy volunteers are recruited in our study. Tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (Tag-SNPs) were retrieved in the International HapMap Project Databases. Extraction of genomic DNAs was conducted with TaqMan Blood DNA kits. Genotyping of USF1 polymorphisms were carried out with TaqMan SNPs genotyping assay. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to evaluate the association between USF1 polymorphisms and HCC risk. All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 20.0 software. Five tag-SNPs were identified to represent the genetic variants of USF1. Our results suggested that rs2516839 in the 5'UTR of USF1 was significantly associated with increased HCC risk (AA vs GG: OR = 3.15; 95% CI 1.44-6.87; P = 0.003; GA + AA vs AA: OR = 1.85; 95% CI 1.04-3.30; P = 0.034; AA vs GG + GA: OR = 2.96; 95% CI 1.40-6.26; P = 0.004; A vs G: OR = 2.09; 9% CI 1.35-3.23; P &lt; 0.001). Although rs2073655 in the intron region of USF1 was also shown to be correlated with decreased HCC susceptibility in recessive model (TT vs CC + CT: OR = 0.40; 95% CI 0.54-0.75; P = 0.004), this association was not conclusive. Our results indicated that the SNP of rs2516839 have close association with increased risk of HCC. Further studies may be needed to validate our results and gain insights into the pathological mechanism of USF1 gene in the HCC tumorigenesis.
Obesity in combination with diabetes and hypertension likely is contributing to the increasing incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the 21st century worldwide and requires novel insights and strategies for treatment. There is an increasing recognition that the kidney has an important role in the complex inter-organ communication that occurs with the development of inflammation and fibrosis with obesity. Inhibition of the adiponectin-AMPK pathway has now become established as a critical pathway regulating both inflammation and pro-fibrotic pathways for both obesity-related kidney disease and diabetic kidney disease. AMPK regulates NFκB activation and is a potent regulator of NADPH oxidases. Nox4 in particular has emerged as a key contribtor to the early inflammation of diabetic kidney disease. AMPK also regulates several transcription factors that contribute to stimulation of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) system. Another key aspect of AMPK regulation is its control of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and mitochondrial biogenesis. Inhibition of PGC-1α, the transcriptional co-activator of mitochondrial biogenesis is being recognized as a key pathway that is inhibited in diabetic kidney disease and may be linked to inhibition of mitochondrial function. Translation of this concept is emerging via the field of urine metabolomics, as several metabolites linked to mitochondria are consistently downregulated in human diabetic kidney disease. Further studies to explore the role of AMPK and related energy-sensing pathways will likely lead to a more comprehensive understanding of why the kidney is affected early on and in a progressive manner with obesity and diabetes.
Interleukin-34 (IL-34) is a novel cytokine, which is composed of 222 amino acids and forms homodimers. It binds to the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) receptor and plays an important role in innate immunity and inflammatory processes. In the present study, we identified the completed IL-34 gene in 25 various mammalian genomes and found that IL-34 existed in all types of vertebrates, including fish, amphibians, birds and mammals. These species have a similar 7 exon/6 intron gene organization. The phylogenetic tree indicated that the IL-34 gene from the primate lineage, rodent lineage and teleost lineage form a species-specific cluster. It was found mammalian that IL-34 was under positive selection pressure with the identified positively selected site, 196Val. Fifty-five functionally relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including 32 SNPs causing missense mutations, 3 exonic splicing enhancer SNPs and 20 SNPs causing nonsense mutations were identified from 2,141 available SNPs in the human IL-34 gene. IL-34 was expressed in various types of cancer, including blood, brain, breast, colorectal, eye, head and neck, lung, ovarian and skin cancer. A total of 5 out of 40 tests (1 blood cancer, 1 brain cancer, 1 colorectal cancer and 2 lung cancer) revealed an association between IL-34 gene expression and cancer prognosis. It was found that the association between the expression of IL-34 and cancer prognosis varied in different types of cancer, even in the same types of cancer from different databases. This suggests that the function of IL-34 in these tumors may be multidimensional. The upstream transcription factor 1 (USF1), regulatory factor X-1 (RFX1), the Sp1 transcription factor 1 , POU class 3 homeobox 2 (POU3F2) and forkhead box L1 (FOXL1) regulatory transcription factor binding sites were identified in the IL-34 gene upstream (promoter) region, which may be involved in the effects of IL-34 in tumors.
Upstream stimulating factor 1 (USF1) is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that specifically binds to E-box DNA motifs, known cis-elements of key oocyte expressed genes essential for oocyte and early embryonic development. However, the functional and regulatory role of USF1 in bovine oocyte and embryo development is not understood. In this study, we demonstrated that USF1 mRNA is maternal in origin and expressed in a stage specific manner during the course of oocyte maturation and preimplantation embryonic development. Immunocytochemical analysis showed detectable USF1 protein during oocyte maturation and early embryonic development with increased abundance at 8-16-cell stage of embryo development, suggesting a potential role in embryonic genome activation. Knockdown of USF1 in germinal vesicle stage oocytes did not affect meiotic maturation or cumulus expansion, but caused significant changes in mRNA abundance for genes associated with oocyte developmental competence. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated depletion of USF1 in presumptive zygote stage embryos demonstrated that USF1 is required for early embryonic development to the blastocyst stage. A similar (USF2) yet unique (TWIST2) expression pattern during oocyte and early embryonic development for related E-box binding transcription factors known to cooperatively bind USF1 implies a potential link to USF1 action. This study demonstrates that USF1 is a maternally derived transcription factor required for bovine early embryonic development, which also functions in regulation of JY1, GDF9, and FST genes associated with oocyte competence. 
To research the association between the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of three spermatogenesis-related genes (USF1, GTF2A1L and OR2W3) and non-obstruction azoospermia (NOA).
We investigated 361 NOA cases and 368 controls from the Chinese Han population, and we used Sequenom iplex technology to analyze the candidate 9 SNPs from the USF1, GTF2A1L and OR2W3 genes.
In this study, we found that the variant rs2516838 of USF1 was associated with NOA susceptibility (P = 0.020, OR = 1.436), and the haplotype TCG of the variants rs1556259, rs2516838, and rs2774276 of USF1 conferred an increased risk of NOA (P = 0.019, OR = 1.436). Furthermore, we found that the rs11204546 genotype of OR2W3 and the rs11677854 genotype of GTF2A1L were correlated with the FSH level in the patients (P = 0.004 and P = 0.018, respectively).
Our results provided a new insight into susceptibility of USF1 variant with male infertility. Clinically, the SNPs (rs11204546 of OR2W3 and rs11677854 of GTF2A1L ) might be additional valuable molecular predictive markers for assessing the treatment of NOA patients.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prototype of liver cancer, which is closely related to manifested metabolism of lip and glucose. Upstream transcription factor 1 (USF1) is an important transcription factor in human genome, and it regulates the expression of multiple genes associated with lipid and glucose metabolism. This study aims at investigating the correlation between seven common USF1 polymorphisms (i.e., -1994 G&gt;A, -202 G&gt;A, 7998 A&gt;G, -844 C&gt;T, 9042 C&gt;G, 9441 T&gt;C, and -2083 G&gt;A) and the risk of HCC. Elucidation of the interaction might be of vital importance to the diagnosis and prognosis of HCC. One hundred and fifty-five HCC patients and 160 healthy controls from a Chinese Han population were involved in this study. Tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified with reference to CBI-dbSNP and HapMap databases. DNA was extracted from blood samples, and matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) was conducted to determine the polymorphisms of USF1. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval were applied to evaluate the difference of genotype distribution. Seven SNPs were selected to be representatives. No significant difference was observed concerning -1994 G&gt;A, 7998 A&gt;G, 9042 C&gt;G, 9441 T&gt;C, and -2083 G&gt;A polymorphisms (all P &gt; 0.05). A significantly elevated genotype frequency regarding -202 G&gt;A polymorphism was observed in HCC patients [AA vs. GG: OR 2.13 (1.13-4.01), P = 0.019; AA vs. GG+GA: OR 2.22 (1.32-3.75), P = 0.003; A allele vs. G allele: OR 1.46 (1.07-2.01), P = 0.018]. Subjects carrying mutant -844 C&gt;T genotypes also had a higher risk of HCC [CT vs. CC: OR 1.88 (1.17-3.04), P = 0.009; CT+TT vs. CC: OR 1.83 (1.17-2.86), P = 0.008; T allele vs. C allele: OR 1.49 (1.06-2.09), P = 0.020]. Further studies are recommended to validate our findings in different ethnicity and to clarify the functional relationship between USF1 polymorphisms and the susceptibility of HCC.
Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCH) is a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by a variable phenotype showing increased levels of triglycerides and/or cholesterol. The aim of this study was to identify single nucleotides (SNPs) in lipid-related genes associated with FCH.
Twenty SNPs in lipid-related genes were studied in 142 control subjects and 165 FCH patients after excluding patients with mutations in the LDLR gene and patients with the E2/E2 genotype of APOE. In particular, we studied the 9996G &gt; A (rs2073658) and 11235C &gt; T (rs3737787) variants in the Upstream Stimulatory Factor 1 gene (USF1), and the -1131T &gt; C (rs662799) and S19W (rs3135506) variants in the Apolipoprotein A-V gene (APOA5). We found that the frequencies of these variants differed between patients and controls and that are associated with different lipid profiles. At multivariate logistic regression SNP S19W in APOA5 remained significantly associated with FCH independently of age, sex, BMI, cholesterol and triglycerides.
Our results show that the USF1 and APOA5 polymorphisms are associated with FCH and that the S19W SNP in the APOA5 gene is associated to the disease independently of total cholesterol, triglycerides and BMI. However, more extensive studies including other SNPs such as rs2516839 in USF1, are required.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a pivotal role in carcinogenesis by suppressing oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. Various studies have identified numerous miRNAs and their diverse targets; however, the consequences of dysregulated miRNAs in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) remain unclear. For this study, we found that miR-148a is downregulated through hypermethylation in NPC biopsies and NPC cell lines compared with adjacent normal and NP cells respectively. Promoter assays demonstrated that upstream stimulatory factor 1 (USF1) is a crucial transcription factor that activates miR-148a promoter activity. EMSA assays confirmed that purified USF1 binds better toward the unmethylated than the methylated CG-containing USF1 consensus probe. The ectopic expression of miR-148a inhibits cell migration in NPC cells through the suppression of integrin-mediated signaling by targeting VAV2, WASL and ROCK1. Biochemical and functional assays provided supporting evidence that these 3 genes are the downstream targets of miR-148a in NPC cells. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting analysis revealed that the 3 oncogenic targets of miR-148a were overexpressed in NPC biopsies, suggesting that the inactivation of miR-148a caused by DNA methylation promotes NPC progression. Overall, our findings revealed that miR-148a can act as tumor suppressor miRNA and serve as a biomarker as well as a therapeutic target for NPC. 
The upstream stimulatory factors 1 (USF1) and 2 (USF2) are transcription factors which bind to E-box motifs of various promoters regulating a variety of different cellular processes. Only little is known about the regulation of USFs. Here, we identified protein kinase CK2 as an enzyme that phosphorylates USF1 but not USF2. Using deletion mutants and point mutants we were able to identify threonine 100 as the major phosphorylation site for CK2. It is well known that USF1 and USF2 form hetero-dimers. Binding studies revealed that the inhibition of CK2 kinase activity by a specific inhibitor enhanced binding of USF1 to USF2. Furthermore, transactivation studies showed that the inhibition of CK2 phosphorylation of USF1 stimulated transcription from the glucokinase promoter as well as the fatty acid synthetase promoter but not from the heme oxygenase-1 promoter. Thus, we have shown for the first time that CK2 phosphorylation of USF1 modulates two functionally important properties of USF1, namely hetero-dimerization and transactivation. 
Human telomerase gene hTERT is important for cancer and aging. hTERT promoter is regulated by multiple transcription factors (TFs) and its activity is dependent on the chromatin environment. However, it remains unsolved how the interplay between TFs and chromatin environment controls hTERT transcription. In this study, we employed the recombinase-mediated BAC targeting and BAC recombineering techniques to dissect the functions of two proximal E-box sites at -165 and +44 nt in regulating the hTERT promoter in the native genomic contexts. Our data showed that mutations of these sites abolished promoter binding by c-Myc/Max, USF1 and USF2, decreased hTERT promoter activity, and prevented its activation by overexpressed c-Myc. Upon inhibition of histone deacetylases, mutant and wildtype promoters were induced to the same level, indicating that the E-boxes functioned to de-repress the hTERT promoter and allowed its transcription in a repressive chromatin environment. Unexpectedly, knockdown of endogenous c-Myc/Max proteins activated hTERT promoter. This activation did not require the proximal E-boxes but was accompanied by increased promoter accessibility, as indicated by augmented active histone marks and binding of multiple TFs at the promoter. Our studies demonstrated that c-Myc/Max functioned in maintaining chromatin-dependent repression of the hTERT gene in addition to activating its promoter. 
The expression of heparanase (HPSE) was associated with postoperative metastatic recurrence in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The six E-box binding sites in the core promoter of the HPSE gene suggested that transcription factors of E-box such as upstream stimulatory factor (USF) might regulate the transcription of the HPSE gene. The aim of our study is to measure the levels of HPSE and USF expression and investigate the relationship between USF expression and clinicopathological parameters in patients with HCC.
HPSE, USF1 and USF2 expressions in human HCC cell lines (BEL-7402, HepG2 and HCCLM3) and 15 fresh human HCC tissue samples were measured by real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR and Western blot analysis. The normal liver cell line QSG7701 or fresh normal liver tissue samples obtained from 15 additional surgical patients with hepatic rupture was used as a control. The protein expressions were determined by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded human HCC tissues and corresponding non-neoplastic tumor surrounding tissues (NTST) of 57 patients.
HPSE, USF1 and USF2 mRNA expressions were increased in HCC cell lines and HCC tissues compared with normal liver cell line and normal liver tissue. The protein expressions of HPSE, USF1 and USF2 in HCC cell lines and HCC tissues were also increased. Both USF1 and USF2 expressions were positively correlated with HPSE. USF1 and USF2 expressions were increased in patients with liver cirrhosis, worse tissue differentiation, advanced HCC stages and metastatic recurrence.
Increased USF in HCC is associated with HPSE expression. USF might be an important factor in regulating HPSE expression and act as a novel marker of metastatic recurrence of HCC patients.
Network-oriented analysis is essential to identify those parts of a cell affected by a given perturbation. The effect of neurodegenerative perturbations in the form of diseases of brain metabolism was investigated by using a newly reconstructed brain-specific metabolic network. The developed stoichiometric model correctly represents healthy brain metabolism, and includes 630 metabolic reactions in and between astrocytes and neurons, which are controlled by 570 genes. The integration of transcriptome data of six neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia) with the model was performed to identify reporter features specific and common for these diseases, which revealed metabolites and pathways around which the most significant changes occur. The identified metabolites are potential biomarkers for the pathology of the related diseases. Our model indicated perturbations in oxidative stress, energy metabolism including TCA cycle and lipid metabolism as well as several amino acid related pathways, in agreement with the role of these pathways in the studied diseases. The computational prediction of transcription factors that commonly regulate the reporter metabolites was achieved through binding-site analysis. Literature support for the identified transcription factors such as USF1, SP1 and those from FOX families are known from the literature to have regulatory roles in the identified reporter metabolic pathways as well as in the neurodegenerative diseases. In essence, the reconstructed brain model enables the elucidation of effects of a perturbation on brain metabolism and the illumination of possible machineries in which a specific metabolite or pathway acts as a regulatory spot for cellular reorganization. 
Pyruvate carboxylase (PC) is an anaplerotic enzyme that regulates glucose-induced insulin secretion in pancreatic islets. Dysregulation of its expression is associated with type 2 diabetes. Herein we describe the molecular mechanism underlying the glucose-mediated transcriptional regulation of the PC gene. Incubation of the rat insulin cell line INS-1 832/13 with glucose resulted in a 2-fold increase in PC mRNA expression. Transient transfections of the rat PC promoter-luciferase reporter construct in the above cell line combined with mutational analysis indicated that the rat PC gene promoter contains the glucose-responsive element (GRE), comprising three canonical E-boxes (E1, E3 and E4) and one E-box-like element (E2) clustering between nucleotides -546 and -399, upstream of the transcription start site. Mutation of any of these E-boxes resulted in a marked reduction of glucose-mediated transcriptional induction of the reporter gene. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that the upstream stimulatory factors 1 and 2 (USF1 and USF2) bind to E1, the Specificity Protein-1 (Sp1) binds to E2, USF2 and the carbohydrate responsive element binding protein (ChREBP) binds to E4, while unknown factors binds to E3. High glucose promotes the recruitment of Sp1 to E2 and, USF2 and ChREBP to E4. Silencing the expression of Sp1, USF2 and ChREBP by their respective siRNAs in INS-1 832/13 cells blunted glucose-induced expression of endogenous PC. We conclude that the glucose-mediated transcriptional activation of the rat PC gene is regulated by at least these three transcription factors. 
Alterations in transcription factors expressed in insulin-producing islet β-cells generate pancreatic dysfunction leading to diabetes. The homeodomain transcription factor Alx3 (aristaless-like homeobox 3) expressed in pancreatic islets participates in the regulated expression of several islet genes, and its deficiency in mice leads to islet cell apoptosis and glucose intolerance. In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms that regulate expression of Alx3 in pancreatic islets at the transcriptional level. We found that the Alx3 promoter contains at least eight putative regulatory elements with an E-box consensus sequence, three of which were determined to be functional and required for Alx3 promoter activity by mutational analysis in transfected MIN6 β-cells. We determined that these E-box elements are recognized by the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors USF1 (upstream stimulatory factor 1) and USF2. We also identified a highly conserved A-box in the Alx3 promoter that is recognized by the islet-specific transcription factor Pdx1 (pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1). Pdx1-mediated transactivation of the Alx3 promoter requires the integrity of the three functional E-boxes and the co-operation with USF transcription factors bound to them. The results from the present study indicate that Pdx1 contributes to the transcriptional transactivation of Alx3 in pancreatic β-cells by acting in co-ordination with USF1 and USF2. 
Plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), a major regulator of the plasmin-dependent pericellular proteolytic cascade, is prominently expressed during the tissue response to injury although the factors that impact PAI-1 induction and their role in the repair process are unclear. Kinetic modeling using established biomarkers of cell cycle transit (c-MYC; cyclin D1; cyclin A) in synchronized human (HaCaT) keratinocytes, and previous cytometric assessments, indicated that PAI-1 transcription occurred early after serum-stimulation of quiescent (G0) cells and prior to G1 entry. It was established previously that differential residence of USF family members (USF1→USF2 switch) at the PE2 region E box (CACGTG) characterized the G0  → G1 transition period and the transcriptional status of the PAI-1 gene. A consensus PE2 E box motif (5'-CACGTG-3') at nucleotides -566 to -561 was required for USF/E box interactions and serum-dependent PAI-1 transcription. Site-directed CG → AT substitution at the two central nucleotides inhibited formation of USF/probe complexes and PAI-1 promoter-driven reporter expression. A dominant-negative USF (A-USF) construct or double-stranded PE2 "decoy" attenuated serum- and TGF-β1-stimulated PAI-1 synthesis. Tet-Off induction of an A-USF insert reduced both PAI-1 and PAI-2 transcripts while increasing the fraction of Ki-67(+) cells. Conversely, overexpression of USF2 or adenoviral-delivery of a PAI-1 vector inhibited HaCaT colony expansion indicating that the USF1 → USF2 transition and subsequent PAI-1 transcription are critical events in the epithelial go-or-grow response. Collectively, these data suggest that USF2, and its target gene PAI-1, regulate serum-stimulated keratinocyte growth, and likely the cadence of cell cycle progression in replicatively competent cells as part of the injury repair program.
Although non-genomic steroid receptor pathways have been studied over the past decade, little is known about the direct gene expression changes that take place as a consequence of their activation. Progesterone controls proliferation of rat endometrial stromal cells during the peri-implantation phase of pregnancy. We showed that picomolar concentration of progestin R5020 mimics this control in UIII endometrial stromal cells via ERK1-2 and AKT activation mediated by interaction of Progesterone Receptor (PR) with Estrogen Receptor beta (ERb) and without transcriptional activity of endogenous PR and ER. Here we identify early downstream targets of cytoplasmic PR signaling and their possible role in endometrial stromal cell proliferation. Microarray analysis of global gene expression changes in UIII cells treated for 45 min with progestin identified 97 up- and 341 down-regulated genes. The most over-represented molecular functions were transcription factors and regulatory factors associated with cell proliferation and cell cycle, a large fraction of which were repressors down-regulated by hormone. Further analysis verified that progestins regulate Ccnd1, JunD, Usf1, Gfi1, Cyr61, and Cdkn1b through PR-mediated activation of ligand-free ER, ERK1-2 or AKT, in the absence of genomic PR binding. ChIP experiments show that progestin promoted the interaction of USF1 with the proximal promoter of the Cdc2 gene. Usf1 knockdown abolished Cdc2 progestin-dependent transcriptional regulation and cell proliferation, which also blocked Cdc2 knockdown. We conclude that progestin-induced proliferation of endometrial stromal cells is mediated by ERK1-2 and AKT dependent early regulation of USF1, which directly induces Cdc2. To our knowledge, this is the first description of early target genes of progestin-activated classical PR via crosstalk with protein kinases and independently of hormone receptor binding to the genomic targets. 
Genomic instability is a major hallmark of cancer. To maintain genomic integrity, cells are equipped with dedicated sensors to monitor DNA repair or to force damaged cells into death programs. The tumor suppressor p53 is central in this process. Here, we report that the ubiquitous transcription factor Upstream Stimulatory factor 1 (USF1) coordinates p53 function in making proper cell fate decisions. USF1 stabilizes the p53 protein and promotes a transient cell cycle arrest, in the presence of DNA damage. Thus, cell proliferation is maintained inappropriately in Usf1 KO mice and in USF1-deficient melanoma cells challenged by genotoxic stress. We further demonstrate that the loss of USF1 compromises p53 stability by enhancing p53-MDM2 complex formation and MDM2-mediated degradation of p53. In USF1-deficient cells, the level of p53 can be restored by the re-expression of full-length USF1 protein similarly to what is observed using Nutlin-3, a specific inhibitor that prevents p53-MDM2 interaction. Consistent with a new function for USF1, a USF1 truncated protein lacking its DNA-binding and transactivation domains can also restore the induction and activity of p53. These findings establish that p53 function requires the ubiquitous stress sensor USF1 for appropriate cell fate decisions in response to DNA-damage. They underscore the new role of USF1 and give new clues of how p53 loss of function can occur in any cell type. Finally, these findings are of clinical relevance because they provide new therapeutic prospects in stabilizing and reactivating the p53 pathway.
Upstream transcription factor 1 (USF1) allelic variants significantly influence future risk of cardiovascular disease and overall mortality in females. We investigated sex-specific effects of USF1 gene allelic variants on serum indices of lipoprotein metabolism, early markers of asymptomatic atherosclerosis and their changes during six years of follow-up. In addition, we investigated the cis-regulatory role of these USF1 variants in artery wall tissues in Caucasians. In the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study, 1,608 participants (56% women, aged 31.9 ± 4.9) with lipids and cIMT data were included. For functional study, whole genome mRNA expression profiling was performed in 91 histologically classified atherosclerotic samples. In females, serum total, LDL cholesterol and apoB levels increased gradually according to USF1 rs2516839 genotypes TT &lt; CT &lt; CC and rs1556259 AA &lt; AG &lt; GG as well as according to USF1 H3 (GCCCGG) copy number 0 &lt; 1 &lt; 2. Furthermore, the carriers of minor alleles of rs2516839 (C) and rs1556259 (G) of USF1 gene had decreased USF1 expression in atherosclerotic plaques (P = 0.028 and 0.08, respectively) as compared to non-carriers. The genetic variation in USF1 influence USF1 transcript expression in advanced atherosclerosis and regulates levels and metabolism of circulating apoB and apoB-containing lipoprotein particles in sex-dependent manner, but is not a major determinant of early markers of atherosclerosis. 
Liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PH) is a synchronized process that is precisely controlled by system-wide transcriptional regulatory networks. To clarify the transcriptional changes and regulatory networks that involve transcription factors (TFs) and their target genes during the priming phase, an advanced mouse oligonucleotide array-based transcription factor assay (MOUSE OATFA), mRNA microarray analysis, bioinformatic analysis and ChIP-on-chip experiments were used. A total of 774 genes were upregulated or downregulated in PH liver samples compared with the sham operation (SH) group. Seventeen TFs showed significant changes in activity in the regenerating livers, some of which have not been extensively studied in previous reports, including upstream stimulatory transcription factor 1 (USF1). The TF signatures from MOUSE OATFA were combined with mRNA expression profiles and ChIP-on-chip analyses to construct experimental transcriptional regulatory networks in regenerating livers. USF1-centered regulatory networks were further confirmed by ChIP assays, revealing some of its target genes and novel coregulatory networks. The combination of MOUSE OATFA with transcriptome profiling and bioinformatic analysis represents a novel paradigm for the comprehensive prediction of transcriptional coregulatory networks during the early phase of liver regeneration. 
Upstream stimulatory factor 1 (USF-1) is an important transcription factor that participates in glucose metabolism and tumorigenesis. The aim of the current study was to explore the regulatory mechanism of USF-1 in HepG2 cells exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). After the establishment of the OGD model in HepG2 cells, we determined that the cells treated with OGD exhibited a high apoptotic rate and that the introduction of siRNA against USF-1 protected the cells from OGD-induced apoptosis. The miRNA microarray results demonstrated that a set of miRNAs were deregulated in the cells transfected with USF-1 siRNA, and the set of downregulated miRNAs included a novel miRNA, miR-132. Further analyses indicated that miR-132 overexpression inhibits the protective roles of USF-1 siRNA in OGD-induced apoptosis. We also identified several binding sites for USF-1 in the miR-132 promoter. The silencing of USF-1 resulted in a reduction in miR-132 expression, and USF-1 overexpression increased the expression of this miRNA. Our study indicated that the silencing of USF-1 plays protective roles in OGD-induced apoptosis through the downregulation of miR-132, which indicates that the silencing of USF-1 may be a therapeutic strategy for the promotion of cancer cell survival under OGD conditions. 
VPA (valproic acid), a short-chain fatty acid that is a HDAC (histone deacetylase) inhibitor, is known to suppress adipogenesis. In the present study, we identified the molecular mechanism of VPA-mediated suppression of adipogenesis in adipocytes. VPA suppressed the accumulation of intracellular triacylglycerol. The expression levels of PPARγ (peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor γ) and C/EBPα (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α), which are key regulators of adipogenesis, as well as the expression of SCD (stearoyl-CoA desaturase), were decreased by the treatment with VPA. Moreover, glycerol release was decreased in the VPA-treated cells, even though the transcription levels of ATGL (adipose triacylglycerol lipase), HSL (hormone-sensitive lipase) and MGL (monoacylglycerol lipase), all of which are involved in lipolysis, were elevated by the treatment with VPA. It is noteworthy that the expression level of FAS (fatty acid synthase) was significantly suppressed when the cells were cultured in medium containing VPA. Furthermore, VPA-mediated suppression of the accumulation of the intracellular triacylglycerols was prevented by the treatment with palmitic acid, a major product of FAS. The results of promoter-luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that USF1(upstream stimulating factor 1) bound to the E-box of the promoter region of the FAS gene. In addition, the expression of USF1 was decreased by the treatment with VPA. siRNA-mediated knockdown of the expression of the USF1 gene repressed adipogenesis along with the decreased expression of the FAS gene. The overexpression of USF1 enhanced both adipogenesis and the expression of FAS in VPA-treated cells. These results indicate that VPA suppressed adipogenesis through the down-regulation of USF1-activated fatty acid synthesis in adipocytes.
Here we found that the transcription repressor DREAM bound to the promoter of the gene encoding A20 to repress expression of this deubiquitinase that suppresses inflammatory NF-κB signaling. DREAM-deficient mice displayed persistent and unchecked A20 expression in response to endotoxin. DREAM functioned by transcriptionally repressing A20 through binding to downstream regulatory elements (DREs). In contrast, binding of the transcription factor USF1 to the DRE-associated E-box domain in the gene encoding A20 activated its expression in response to inflammatory stimuli. Our studies define the critical opposing functions of DREAM and USF1 in inhibiting and inducing A20 expression, respectively, and thereby the strength of NF-κB signaling. Targeting of DREAM to induce USF1-mediated A20 expression is therefore a potential anti-inflammatory strategy for the treatment of diseases associated with unconstrained NF-κB activity, such as acute lung injury. 
In order to reside and multiply successfully within the host macrophages, Leishmania parasites impair the generation of cellular as well as mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is a major host defense mechanism against any invading pathogen. Mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) is strongly induced in Leishmania infection, both at mRNA and protein levels, to suppress the mitochondrial ROS generation. In the present study we have demonstrated that Leishmania donovani infection is associated with strong up-regulation of UCP2 at mRNA level which is the determining factor for its protein level upregulation. The transcriptional activation of UCP2 was mediated by increased nuclear translocation and DNA binding of sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP2) and specificity protein 1 (Sp1) transcription factors with concomitant decrease of both the nuclear content and the promoter occupancy of upstream stimulatory factor 1 (USF1). siRNA-mediated silencing of SREBP2 or Sp1 was associated with decreased UCP2 expression in infected macrophages. In contrast, downregulation of USF1 resulted in activated transcription of UCP2. L. donovani infection resulted in degradation of USF1 thereby facilitating SREBP2 binding which in turn assisted in the association of Sp1 with the promoter ultimately culminating in elevated transcription of UCP2. 
When brought into captivity, wild animals can adapt to domestication within 10 generations. Such adaptations may decrease fitness in natural conditions. Many selective pressures are disrupted in captivity, including social behavioral networks. Although lack of sociality in captivity appears to mediate domestication, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Additionally, determining the contribution of genetic inheritance vs. transgenerational effects during relaxed selection may provide insight into the flexibility of adaptation. When wild-derived mice kept under laboratory conditions for eight generations were reintroduced to sociality and promiscuity (free mate choice), they adapted within two generations. Fitness assessments between this promiscuous lineage and a monogamous laboratory lineage revealed male-specific effects. Promiscuous-line males had deficits in viability, but a striking advantage in attracting mates, and their scent marks were also more attractive to females. Here, we investigate mechanistic details underlying this olfactory signal and identify a role of major urinary protein (MUP) pheromones. Promiscuous-line males inherit higher MUP expression than monogamous-line males through transgenerational inheritance. Sociality-driven maternal and paternal effects reveal intriguing conflicts among parents and offspring over pheromone expression. MUP up-regulation is not driven by hormone-driven transduction pathways, but rather is associated with reduction in DNA methylation of a CpG dinucleotide in the promoter. This reduction in methylation could enhance transcription by promoting the binding of transcription factor USF1 (upstream stimulatory factor 1). Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that increased MUP expression is a female attractant. These results identify molecular mechanisms guiding domestication and adaptive responses to fluctuating sociality. 
The hepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein (HBx) plays a key role in the molecular pathogenesis of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, its critical gene targets remain largely unknown. RASSF1A gene (Ras-association domain family 1A, RASSF1A), a tumor-suppressor gene, is frequently found to be hypermethylated and downregulated in HCC. In the present study, we investigated whether HBx is involved in the hypermethylation and downregulation of RASSF1A and we examined the potential regulation mechanisms. RT-PCR analysis was used to determine RASSF1A and HBx expression in 9 liver cell lines and the results showed that RASSF1A expression was relatively low in HBx-positive cells. Notably, RASSF1A was downregulated in HepG2.2.15 cells, as compared to HepG2 cells. Further analysis revealed that HBx transfection suppressed RASSF1A expression and HBx knockdown induced its expression. Enforced HBx suppressed RASSF1A and meanwhile induced DNMT1 and DNMT3B expression. In addition, RASSF1A is negatively regulated by DNMT1. ChIP analysis using an antibody against DNMT1 revealed that HBx enhanced the binding of DNMT1 to the RASSF1A promoter but the inhibition of RASSF1A by HBx is DNA methylation-independent as detected by methylation-specific PCR (MSP). Further studies using MSP and bisulfite genomic sequencing (BGS) revealed that no significant methylation changes were observed for regional methylation levels of RASSF1A in DNMT1 knockdown cells, although methylation levels of specific CpG sites at the predicted binding sites for the Sp1 and USF transcription factors were reduced. Additionally, RASSF1A was downregulated in HBV-associated HCC (HBV-HCC) as detected by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry suggesting RASSF1A expression may be related to HBx in HCC and the clinical relevance of our observations. Collectively, our data showed that HBx suppressed RASSF1A expression via DNMT1 and offered a new mechanism of RASSF1A inactive in HCC in addition to the widely known DNA methylation, enriching the epigenetic mechanism by which HBx contributes to the pathogenesis of HBV-HCC.
Steatohepatitis occurs in alcoholic liver disease and may progress to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Its molecular pathogenesis is to a large degree unknown. Histone modifications play a key role in transcriptional regulations as marks for silencing and activation of gene expression and as marks for functional elements. Many transcription factors (TFs) are crucial for the control of the genes involved in metabolism, and abnormality in their function may lead to disease.
We performed ChIP-seq of the histone modifications H3K4me1, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac and a candidate transcription factor (USF1) in liver tissue from patients with steatohepatitis and normal livers and correlated results to mRNA-expression and genotypes.
We found several regions that are differentially enriched for histone modifications between disease and normal tissue, and qRT-PCR results indicated that the expression of the tested genes strongly correlated with differential enrichment of histone modifications but is independent of USF1 enrichment. By gene ontology analysis of differentially modified genes we found many disease associated genes, some of which had previously been implicated in the etiology of steatohepatitis. Importantly, the genes associated to the strongest histone peaks in the patient were over-represented in cancer specific pathways suggesting that the tissue was on a path to develop to cancer, a common complication to the disease. We also found several novel SNPs and GWAS catalogue SNPs that are candidates to be functional and therefore needs further study.
In summary we find that analysis of chromatin features in tissue samples provides insight into disease mechanisms.
Prostate cancer caused by the abnormal disorderly growth of prostatic acinar cells is the most prevalent cancer of men in western countries. We aimed to screen out differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and explore small molecule drugs for prostate cancer.
The GSE3824 gene expression profile of prostate cancer was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database which including 21 normal samples and 18 prostate cancer cells. The DEGs were identified by Limma package in R language and gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses were performed. In addition, potential regulatory microRNAs and the target sites of the transcription factors were screened out based on the molecular signature database. In addition, the DEGs were mapped to the connectivity map database to identify potential small molecule drugs.
A total of 6,588 genes were filtered as DEGs between normal and prostate cancer samples. Examples such as ITGB6, ITGB3, ITGAV and ITGA2 may induce prostate cancer through actions on the focal adhesion pathway. Furthermore, the transcription factor, SP1, and its target genes ARHGAP26 and USF1 were identified. The most significant microRNA, MIR-506, was screened and found to regulate genes including ITGB1 and ITGB3. Additionally, small molecules MS-275, 8-azaguanine and pyrvinium were discovered to have the potential to repair the disordered metabolic pathways, abd furthermore to remedy prostate cancer.
The results of our analysis bear on the mechanism of prostate cancer and allow screening for small molecular drugs for this cancer. The findings have the potential for future use in the clinic for treatment of prostate cancer.
Major vault protein (MVP) is the main constituent of the vault ribonucleoprotein particle and is identical to lung resistance-related protein (LRP). Although MVP is also expressed in several types of normal tissues, little is known about its physiological role. In the present study, we identified the crucial MVP promoter elements that regulate MVP expression. An examination of tissue expression profiles revealed that MVP was expressed in the heart, placenta, lung, liver, kidney and pancreas. Elements of the MVP promoter contain binding sites for transcription factors, STAT, p53, Sp1, E-box, GATA, MyoD and Y-box. By deletion analysis, a conserved proximal E-box binding site was demonstrated to be important for human MVP promoter transactivation. Introduction of siRNA against upstream stimulating factor (USF) 1, which is known to bind the E-box binding site, decreased the expression of MVP in SW620 and ACHN cells. Using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, USF1 bound the MVP promoter in SW620 cells. These findings suggest that USF1 binding to an E-box element may be critical for basal MVP promoter activation. The results of the present study are useful in understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating MVP gene expression, and may aid in elucidating the physiological functions of MVP. 
The identification of clinically validated genetic variants contributing to complex disorders raise the possibility to investigate individuals' risk. In this line of research, the present work aimed to assess the genetic risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Azoreans. Genotyping of 19 SNPs - 9 on 9p21, 5 on LDLR and 5 on USF1 - was performed by TaqMan assays on 170 healthy Azorean individuals. Results demonstrate that the most frequent haplotype in 9p21, with a frequency of 41.4%, is TGGGCGCGC, which harbors all risk alleles. Considering haplotype homozygosity data show that females present higher value of homozygosity for both LDLR (13.5%) and USF1 (15.3%), whereas males present higher value for the 9p21 region (8.2%). Interestingly, genetic profile analysis revealed differences in terms of geographic and gender distribution. The Azorean Central group presented a higher risk for atherosclerosis, 2.7 times higher when compared to the Eastern group, while the Eastern group shows 1.5 times higher risk for dyslipidemias. Moreover, Azorean females demonstrated a 4 times higher risk for dyslipidemias when compared to males, whereas males have an increased risk for atherosclerosis. Although allele frequencies in Azoreans were similar to those reported for the HapMap CEU population, the differences in terms of haplotype and genetic profile distribution must be taken in consideration when assessing genetic risk. Taken together, the data here presented evidence for the need to perform biomedical research and epidemiologic analysis in Azoreans with the aim of developing strategies to CVD prevention, health promotion and population education. 
The interplay between polycomb and trithorax complexes has been implicated in embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal and differentiation. It has been shown recently that WRD5 and Dpy-30, specific components of the SET1/MLL protein complexes, play important roles during ESC self-renewal and differentiation of neural lineages. However, not much is known about how and where specific trithorax complexes are targeted to genes involved in self-renewal or lineage-specification. Here, we report that the recruitment of the hSET1A histone H3K4 methyltransferase (HMT) complex by transcription factor USF1 is required for mesoderm specification and lineage differentiation. In undifferentiated ESCs, USF1 maintains hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HS/PC) associated bivalent chromatin domains and differentiation potential. Furthermore, USF1 directed recruitment of the hSET1A complex to the HoxB4 promoter governs the transcriptional activation of HoxB4 gene and regulates the formation of early hematopoietic cell populations. Disruption of USF or hSET1A function by overexpression of a dominant-negative AUSF1 mutant or by RNA-interference-mediated knockdown, respectively, led to reduced expression of mesoderm markers and inhibition of lineage differentiation. We show that USF1 and hSET1A together regulate H3K4me3 modifications and transcription preinitiation complex assembly at the hematopoietic-associated HoxB4 gene during differentiation. Finally, ectopic expression of USF1 in ESCs promotes mesoderm differentiation and enforces the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition by inducing hematopoietic-associated transcription factors, HoxB4 and TAL1. Taken together, our findings reveal that the guided-recruitment of the hSET1A histone methyltransferase complex and its H3K4 methyltransferase activity by transcription regulator USF1 safeguards hematopoietic transcription programs and enhances mesoderm/hematopoietic differentiation.
Here, we describe a novel oligonucleotide array-based transcription factor (TF) interaction assay platform that can directly identify cointeracting TF complexes following binding to their regulatory DNA elements. This platform that combines immuno-coprecipitation technology with our previously reported oligonucleotide array-based TF assay (OATFA), is named targeted immuno-coprecipitation OATFA (TIC-OATFA). We illustrate use of the system to identify interaction partners of STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins 1) in mouse fibroblasts. Several previously known partners of STAT1, as well as new partners, were identified by TIC-OATFA, including the upstream stimulatory factors 1 and 2 (USF1, USF2), nuclear factor of activated T cells, TATA box-binding protein, nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2, nuclear factor-kappa B, and nuclear factor 1. Both USF1 and nuclear factor-kappa B are well known to interact with STAT1, but the other five TFs are previously unreported STAT1 interaction partners. We examined interactions between one new TF, USF2, and STAT1 in detail. USF2 belongs to the group of bHLH-zip transcription factors, which in a number of diseases including cancers, has enhanced activity. In summary, a novel oligonucleotide array-based assay platform was developed and used to study interactions between STAT1 and functional TF binding partners, revealing that USF2 and potentially four other new TFs are partners of STAT1 in an IFN-γ stimulated mouse fibroblast cell line.
Integration of high throughput DNA genotyping and RNA-sequencing data allows for the identification of genomic regions that control gene expression, known as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), on a whole genome scale. Intramuscular fat (IMF) content and carcass composition play important roles in metabolic and physiological processes in mammals because they influence insulin sensitivity and consequently prevalence of metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, limited information is available on the genetic variants and mechanisms associated with IMF deposition in mammals. Thus, our hypothesis was that eQTL analyses could identify putative regulatory regions and transcription factors (TFs) associated with intramuscular fat (IMF) content traits.
We performed an integrative eQTL study in skeletal muscle to identify putative regulatory regions and factors associated with intramuscular fat content traits. Data obtained from skeletal muscle samples of 192 animals was used for association analysis between 461,466 SNPs and the transcription level of 11,808 genes. This yielded 1268 cis- and 10,334 trans-eQTLs, among which we identified nine hotspot regions that each affected the expression of &gt; 119 genes. These putative regulatory regions overlapped with previously identified QTLs for IMF content. Three of the hotspots respectively harbored the transcription factors USF1, EGR4 and RUNX1T1, which are known to play important roles in lipid metabolism. From co-expression network analysis, we further identified modules significantly correlated with IMF content and associated with relevant processes such as fatty acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism and lipid metabolism.
This study provides novel insights into the link between genotype and IMF content as evident from the expression level. It thereby identifies genomic regions of particular importance and associated regulatory factors. These new findings provide new knowledge about the biological processes associated with genetic variants and mechanisms associated with IMF deposition in mammals.
Interleukin-like EMT inducer (ILEI, FAM3C) is a secreted factor that contributes to the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a cell-biological process that confers metastatic properties to a tumor cell. However, very little is known about how ILEI is regulated. Here we demonstrate that ILEI is an in vivo regulator of melanoma invasiveness and is transcriptionally up-regulated by the upstream stimulatory factor-1 (USF-1), an E-box-binding, basic-helix-loop-helix family transcription factor. shRNA-mediated knockdown of ILEI in melanoma cell lines attenuated lung colonization but not primary tumor formation. We also identified the mechanism underlying ILEI transcriptional regulation, which was through a direct interaction of USF-1 with the ILEI promoter. Of note, stimulation of endogenous USF-1 by UV-mediated activation increased ILEI expression, whereas shRNA-mediated USF-1 knockdown decreased ILEI gene transcription. Finally, we report that knocking down USF-1 decreases tumor cell migration. In summary, our work reveals that ILEI contributes to melanoma cell invasiveness in vivo without affecting primary tumor growth and is transcriptionally up-regulated by USF-1.
The hsa-mir-483 gene, located within the IGF2 locus, transcribes for two mature microRNAs, miR-483-5p and miR-483-3p. This gene, whose regulation is mediated by the the CTNNB1/USF1 complex, shows an independent expression from its host gene IGF2. The miR-483-3p affects the Wnt/β-catenin, the TGF-β, and the TP53 signaling pathways by targeting several genes as CTNNB1, SMAD4, IGF1, and BBC3. Accordingly, miR-483-3p is associated with various tissues specific physiological properties as insulin and melanin production, as well as with cellular physiological functions such as wounding, differentiation, proliferation, and survival. Deregulation of miR-483-3p is observed in different types of cancer, and its overexpression can inhibit the pro-apoptotic pathway induced by the TP53 target effectors. As a result, the oncogenic characteristics of miR-483-3p are linked to the effect of some of the most relevant cancer-related genes, TP53 and CTNNB1, as well as to one of the most important cancer hallmark: the aberrant glucose metabolism of tumor cells. In this review, we summarize the recent findings regarding the miR-483-3p, to elucidate its functional role in physiological and pathological contexts, focusing overall on its involvement in cancer and in the TP53 pathway.
The adhesion protein carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) is widely expressed in epithelial cells as a short cytoplasmic isoform (S-iso) and in leukocytes as a long cytoplasmic isoform (L-iso) and is frequently silenced in cancer by unknown mechanisms. Previously, we reported that interferon response factor 1 (IRF1) biases alternative splicing (AS) to include the variable exon 7 (E7) in CEACAM1, generating long cytoplasmic isoforms. We now show that IRF1 and a variant of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (Lv1) coordinately silence the CEACAM1 gene. RNAi-mediated Lv1 depletion in IRF1-treated HeLa and melanoma cells induced significant CEACAM1 protein expression, reversed by ectopic Lv1 expression. The Lv1-mediated CEACAM1 repression resided in residues Gly71-Gly89 and Ala38-Gly89 in Lv1's N-terminal extension. ChIP analysis of IRF1- and FLAG-tagged Lv1-treated HeLa cells and global treatment with the global epigenetic modifiers 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and trichostatin A indicated that IRF1 and Lv1 together induce chromatin remodeling, restricting IRF1 access to the CEACAM1 promoter. In interferon γ-treated HeLa cells, the transcription factor SP1 did not associate with the CEACAM1 promoter, but binding by upstream transcription factor 1 (USF1), a known CEACAM1 regulator, was greatly enhanced. ChIP-sequencing revealed that Lv1 overexpression in IRF1-treated cells induces transcriptional silencing across many genes, including DCC (deleted in colorectal carcinoma), associated with CEACAM5 in colon cancer. Notably, IRF1, but not IRF3 and IRF7, affected CEACAM1 expression via translational repression. We conclude that IRF1 and Lv1 coordinately regulate CEACAM1 transcription, alternative splicing, and translation and may significantly contribute to CEACAM1 silencing in cancer.
Our recent studies have shown that cross-talk between histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) and lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) facilitates breast cancer progression. In this work, we demonstrated that regulatory activity at -356 to -100 bp promoter element plays a critical role in governing HDAC5 transcription. By using DNA affinity precipitation and mass spectrometry, we identified a group of factors that bind to this element. Among these factors, Upstream Transcription Factor 1 (USF1) was shown to play a critical role in controlling HDAC5 transcription. Through screening a panel of epigenetic modifying drugs, we showed that a natural bioactive HDAC inhibitor, sulforaphane, downregulated HDAC5 transcription by blocking USF1 activity. Sulforaphane facilitated LSD1 ubiquitination and degradation in an HDAC5-dependent manner. A comparative microarray analysis demonstrated a genome wide cooperative effect of HDAC5 and LSD1 on cancer-related gene expression. shRNA knockdown and sulforaphane inhibition of HDAC5/LSD1 exhibited similar effects on expression of HDAC5/LSD1 target genes. We also showed that coordinated cross-talk of HDAC5 and LSD1 is essential for the antitumor efficacy of sulforaphane. Combination treatment with sulforaphane and a potent LSD1 inhibitor resulted in synergistic growth inhibition in breast cancer cells, but not in normal breast epithelial cells. Furthermore, combined therapy with sulforaphane and LSD1 inhibitor exhibited superior inhibitory effect on MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumor growth. Taken together, our work demonstrates that HDAC5-LSD1 axis is an effective drug target for breast cancer. Inhibition of HDAC5-LSD1 axis with sulforaphane blocks breast cancer growth and combined treatment with LSD1 inhibitor improves the therapeutic efficacy of sulforaphane.
Polycystic ovary syndrome, a common condition characterized by endocrine dysfunction, menstrual irregularity, anovulation and polycystic ovaries, affects 5-7% of reproductive-age women. RAB5B, which is identified by a genome-wide association study as a risk locus for this syndrome, encodes a small GTPase involved in control of receptor internalization and early endosome fusion. We found that RAB5A mRNA levels in luteinized granulosa cells of obese patients with polycystic ovary syndrome were lower than in those of obese women without the syndrome. RAB5A regulated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)-mediated translocation of the FSH receptor (FSHR) from the membrane to the cytoplasm and the subsequent FSH-FSHR signaling pathway. We showed that RAB5A negatively regulated aromatase expression and estradiol synthesis in human granulosa cells in association with changes in FSHR levels by way of the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway. The regulation of FSHR by RAB5A may have been associated with two transcription factors, USF1 and USF2. In conclusion, RAB5A gene was abnormally expressed in luteinized granulosa cells of obese patients with polycystic ovary syndrome, which may help explain high FSHR levels found in this syndrome.
Pediatric ischemic stroke is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. As previous studies of children after stroke showed, dyslipidemias were very common in Polish and other European populations. Thus, looking for genetic factors predisposing to pediatric stroke, its symptoms, and outcome, we have analyzed 2 polymorphisms of the upstream stimulating factor 1 (USF-1) gene.
The study group consisted of 82 children with stroke, 156 parents, and 146 controls. We used 2 alternative methods: the case-control model and the analysis of families using the transmission disequilibrium test. The 2 polymorphisms, rs2516839 and rs3737787, were genotyped using the TaqMan Pre-Designed SNP Genotyping Assay. The Statistica 10.0 software was used in all statistical analyses.
We did not observe any statistical differences in genotype and allele frequencies between patients and controls. There were also no significant differences in the transmission of alleles from the parents to the affected children. However, we have observed that the TT genotype of the rs2516839 polymorphism was more common in patients with epilepsy and dysarthria, whereas the TT genotype of the rs3737787 polymorphism was more frequent in the group of patients with a decrease in intellectual functioning.
Our study did not show any associations between the 2 analyzed polymorphisms of the USF-1 gene and pediatric ischemic stroke. However, we have observed an influence of specific genotypes on the outcome of stroke, including epilepsy, dysarthria, and a decrease in intellectual functioning.
Glioblastoma is one of the most aggressive and deadly tumors among the adults. MUC13 is a membrane bound mucin and abnormal expression of MUC13 has been identified in various tumors. However, its specific role in glioblastoma has never been explored. Firstly, the expression of MUC13 was explored in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) and we found that MUC13 was significantly enhanced in GSCs. Overexpression of MUC13 significantly enhanced GSCs invasion and migration capacities. Further study showed that overexpression of MUC13 significantly increased the phosphorylation levels of AKT and P38. Dual luciferase reporter and ChIP assay demonstrated that USF1 could bind the promoter region of MUC13, thereby enhancing the activation of MUC13. More importantly, when MUC13 was silenced, the phosphorylation levels of AKT and P38 were suppressed even in cells transfected with ad-USF1. These data showed that USF1 prompted glioblastoma progression mainly by activating MUC13. In summary, our study first demonstrated that USF1 could activate the transcription of MUC13, thereby enhancing the proliferation and self-renewal of GSCs.
Ultraconserved (uc) RNAs, a class of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), are conserved across humans, mice, and rats, but the physiological significance and pathological role of ucRNAs is largely unknown. Here we show that uc.372 is upregulated in the livers of db/db mice, HFD-fed mice, and NAFLD patients. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies indicate that uc.372 drives hepatic lipid accumulation in mice by promoting lipogenesis. We further demonstrate that uc.372 binds to pri-miR-195/pri-miR-4668 and suppresses maturation of miR-195/miR-4668 to regulate expression of genes related to lipid synthesis and uptake, including ACC, FAS, SCD1, and CD36. Finally, we identify that uc.372 is located downstream of the insulinoma-associated 2 (INSM2) gene that is transcriptionally activated by upstream transcription factor 1 (USF1). Our findings reveal a novel mechanism by which uc.372 drives hepatic steatosis through inhibition of miR-195/miR-4668 maturation to relieve miR-195/miR-4668-mediated suppression of functional target gene expression.
Twenty-five genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of asthma were published between 2007 and 2016, the largest with a sample size of 157242 individuals. Across these studies, 39 genetic variants in low linkage disequilibrium (LD) with each other were reported to associate with disease risk at a significance threshold of P&lt;5 × 10-8, including 31 in populations of European ancestry. Results from analyses of the UK Biobank data (n=380 503) indicate that at least 28 of the 31 associations reported in Europeans represent true-positive findings, collectively explaining 2.5% of the variation in disease liability (median of 0.06% per variant). We identified 49 transcripts as likely target genes of the published asthma risk variants, mostly based on LD with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). Of these genes, 16 were previously implicated in disease pathophysiology by functional studies, including TSLP, TNFSF4, ADORA1, CHIT1 and USF1. In contrast, at present, there is limited or no functional evidence directly implicating the remaining 33 likely target genes in asthma pathophysiology. Some of these genes have a known function that is relevant to allergic disease, including F11R, CD247, PGAP3, AAGAB, CAMK4 and PEX14, and so could be prioritized for functional follow-up. We conclude by highlighting three areas of research that are essential to help translate GWAS findings into clinical research or practice, namely validation of target gene predictions, understanding target gene function and their role in disease pathophysiology and genomics-guided prioritization of targets for drug development.
This study was supposed to investigate the correlation between the functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs2516839 and rs3737787) in USF1 gene and the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel-based chemotherapy and prognosis in the treatment of ovarian cancer (OC). In total 100 OC patients were selected and divided into the sensitive group and the resistantgroup according to the tumor response to paclitaxel-based chemotherapy after surgery, and the incidence of observed and recorded toxic reaction. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method was applied to test the polymorphisms of rs2516839 and rs3737787 in USF1 gene after extraction of DNA. The correlation between USF1 gene polymorphisms and paclitaxel-based chemotherapy resistance was analyzed using Logistic regression analysis. Stratified analysis was used to test the incidence of toxic reaction in OC patients. Cox proportional hazard model was adapted to make a multiple-factor survival analysis. Significant differences exhibited in the genotype and the allele frequencies of rs2516839 between the sensitive and resistant groups, which showed no obvious difference in the genotype and allele frequencies of rs3737787. OC patients carrying the GA+AA genotype had higher incidence of serious toxic reaction than those carrying the GG genotype. Physical status score, tumor type, maximum tumor diameter and rs2516839 were the independent risk factors for the prognosis of OC patients. Taken together, our results suggest that the rs2516839 polymorphism in USF1 gene may associate with the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel-based chemotherapy and prognosis in the treatment of OC.
Glucose homeostasis is regulated by insulin, which is produced in the β-cells of the pancreas. The synthesis of insulin is controlled by several transcription factors including PDX-1, USF1 and USF2. Both, PDX-1 and USF1 were identified as substrates for protein kinase CK2. Here, we have analysed the interplay of PDX-1, USF1 and CK2 in the regulation of PDX-1 gene transcription. We found that the PDX-1 promoter is dose-dependently transactivated by PDX-1 and transrepressed by USF1. With increasing glucose concentrations the transrepression of the PDX-1 promoter by USF1 is successively abrogated. PDX-1 binding to its own promoter was not influenced by glucose, whereas USF1 binding to the PDX-1 promoter was reduced. The same effect was observed after inhibition of the protein kinase activity by three different inhibitors or by using a phospho-mutant of USF1. Moreover, phosphorylation of USF1 by CK2 seems to strengthen the interaction between USF1 and PDX-1. Thus, CK2 is a negative regulator of the USF1-dependent PDX-1 transcription. Moreover, upon inhibition of CK2 in primary islets, insulin expression as well as insulin secretion were enhanced without affecting the viability of the cells. Therefore, inhibition of CK2 activity may be a promising approach to stimulate insulin production in pancreatic β-cells.
The study was conducted to investigate the protective role of α-tocopherol against polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) induced effect in Sertoli cell function of F1 prepuberal rats. Dams were grouped into six; each group consists of six animals. Group 1-control treated with corn oil as vehicle, group II- 0.5mgPCBs/kg bw/day, group III- 0.5mgPCBs/kg bw/day with α-tocopherol (50mg α-tocopherol/kg bw/day), group IV- 1mgPCBs/kg bwt/day, group V- 1mgPCBs/kg bw/day with α-tocopherol (50mg α-tocopherol/kg bw/day) and group VI - α-tocopherol alone treated orally from postpartum day1-20. Male offspring rats were euthanized on post natal day 21. Testes were collected for the histological examination and Sertoli cell isolation. The protein levels of follicle-stimulating hormone receptor, androgen binding protein, androgen receptor, estrogen receptor α &amp; β, Inhibin-β, transferrin, claudin-11, occludin, E-cadherin, connexin-43, c-fos, c-jun, SF1, USF1 &amp; 2 were studied using western blot method. The testicular architecture was affected in the PCBs exposed rats but this effect was restored by α-tocopherol supplementation. PCBs decreased the protein levels of FSHR, AR, ABP, ERα &amp; β, transferrin, claudin-11, occludin, E-cadherin, connexin-43, c-fos, c-jun, SF1, USF1 &amp; 2 whereas inhibin-β protein level was found to be increased in Sertoli cells. These results suggested that α-tocopherol has ameliorative role against PCBs induced testicular Sertoli cell dysfunction in F1 progeny.
Homeobox transcript antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR), as a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), has been considered to play critical roles in the biological properties of various tumors. The purposes of this study were to investigate the role and possible molecular mechanisms of HOTAIR in regulating the permeability of blood tumor barrier (BTB) in vitro. Our present study elucidated that the expressions of HOTAIR and upstream stimulatory factor 1 (USF1) was up-regulated, but miR-148b-3p was down-regulated in glioma microvascular endothelial cells (GECs). Knockdown of HOTAIR could increase the permeability of BTB as well as down-regulated the expressions of tight junction related proteins ZO-1, occludin, claudin-5, but up-regulated miR-148b-3p expressions in GECs. Meanwhile, dual-luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that HOTAIR was a target RNA of miR-148b-3p. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-148b-3p increased the permeability of BTB by down-regulating the expressions of tight junction related proteins and USF1 in GECs, and vice versa. And further result revealed USF1 was a target of miR-148b-3p. Silence of USF1 increased the permeability of BTB duo to their interaction with the promoters of ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5 in GECs. Taken together, our finding indicated that knockdown of HOTAIR increased BTB permeability via binding to miR-148b-3p, which further reducing tight junction related proteins in GECs by targeting USF1. Thus, HOTAIR will attract more attention since it can serve as a potential target of drug delivery across BTB and may provide novel strategies for glioma treatment.
RNA polymerase II (pol II) is required for the transcription of all protein-coding genes and as such represents a major enzyme whose activity is tightly regulated. Transcriptional initiation therefore requires numerous general transcriptional factors and cofactors that associate with pol II at the core promoter to form a pre-initiation complex. Transcription factor IIA (TFIIA) is a general cofactor that binds TFIID and stabilizes the TFIID-DNA complex during transcription initiation. Previous studies showed that TFIIA can make contact with the DNA sequence upstream or downstream of the TATA box, and that the region bound by TFIIA could overlap with the elements recognized by another factor, TFIIB, at adenovirus major late core promoter. Whether core promoters contain a DNA motif recognized by TFIIA remains unknown. Here we have identified a core promoter element upstream of the TATA box that is recognized by TFIIA. A search of the human promoter database revealed that many natural promoters contain a TFIIA recognition element (IIARE). We show that the IIARE enhances TFIIA-promoter binding and enhances the activity of TATA-containing promoters, but represses or activates promoters that lack a TATA box. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that the IIARE activates transcription by increasing the recruitment of pol II, TFIIA, TAF4, and P300 at TATA-dependent promoters. These findings extend our understanding of the role of TFIIA in transcription, and provide new insights into the regulatory mechanism of core promoter elements in gene transcription by pol II.
The miR-483-3p is upregulated in several tumors, including liver tumors, where it inhibits TP53-dependent apoptosis by targeting the pro-apoptotic gene BBC3/PUMA. The transcriptional regulation of the miR-483-3p could be driven by the β-catenin/USF1 complex, independently from its host gene IGF2, and we previously demonstrated that in HepG2 hepatoblastoma cells carrying wild-type TP53 the upregulation of the miR-483-3p overcomes the antitumoral effects of the tumor-suppressor miR-145-5p by a mechanism involving cellular glucose availability. Here we demonstrate that in HepG2 cells, the molecular link between glucose concentration and miR-483-3p expression entails the O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT), which stabilizes the transcriptional complex at the miR-483 promoter. HepG2 cells showed reduced miR-483-3p expression and increased susceptibility to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-induced apoptosis in presence of the inhibitor of glycolysis 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG). However, in vivo experiments showed that HepG2 cells with higher miR-483-3p expression were selected during tumor progression regardless of 5-FU treatment. Furthermore, treatment with 2-DG alone did not significantly reduce HepG2 xenograft load in immunodeficient mice. In conclusion, we show that in HepG2 cells glucose uptake increases the expression of the oncogenic miR-483-3p through the OGT pathway. This suggests that depletion of the miR-483-3p may be a valuable therapeutic approach in liver cancer patients, but the use of inhibitors of glycolysis to achieve this purpose could accelerate the selection of resistant neoplastic cell clones.
The amyloid precursor protein (APP) modulates synaptic activity, resulting from the fine tuning of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission is affected by modifications in intracellular chloride concentrations regulated by Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter 1 (NKCC1) and neuronal K+-Cl- cotransporter 2 (KCC2), allowing entrance and efflux of chloride, respectively. Modifications in NKCC1 and KCC2 expression during maturation of cortical cells induce a shift in GABAergic signaling. Here, we demonstrated that APP affects this GABA shift. Expression of APP in cortical cells decreased the expression of KCC2, without modifying NKCC1, eliciting a less inhibitory GABA response. Downregulation of KCC2 expression by APP was independent of the APP intracellular domain, but correlated with decreased expression of upstream stimulating factor 1 (USF1), a potent regulator of Slc12a5 gene expression (encoding KCC2). KCC2 was also downregulated in vivo following APP expression in neonatal mouse brain. These results argue for a key role of APP in the regulation of GABAergic neurotransmission.
The gene encoding the aquaporin-2 water channel is regulated transcriptionally in response to vasopressin. In the renal collecting duct, vasopressin stimulates the nuclear translocation and phosphorylation (at Ser552) of β-catenin, a multifunctional protein that acts as a transcriptional coregulator in the nucleus. The purpose of this study was to identify β-catenin-interacting proteins that might be involved in transcriptional regulation in rat inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) cells, using experimental and computational approaches. We used a standard chromatin immunoprecipitation procedure coupled to mass spectrometry (ChIP-MS) in a nuclear fraction isolated from rat IMCD suspensions. Over four biological replicates, we reproducibly identified 43 β-catenin-binding proteins, including several known β-catenin-binding partners as well as novel interacting proteins. Multiple proteins involved in transcriptional regulation were identified (Taf1, Jup, Tdrd3, Cdh1, Cenpj, and several histones). Many of the identified β-catenin-binding partners were found in prior studies to translocate to the nucleus in response to vasopressin. There was only one DNA-binding transcription factor (TF), specifically Taf1, part of the RNA-polymerase II preinitiation complex. To identify sequence-specific TFs that might interact with β-catenin, Bayes' theorem was used to integrate data from several information sources. The analysis identified several TFs with potential binding sites in the Aqp2 gene promoter that could interact with β-catenin in the regulation of Aqp2 gene transcription, specifically Jun, Junb, Jund, Atf1, Atf2, Mef2d, Usf1, Max, Pou2f1, and Rxra. The findings provide information necessary for modeling the transcriptional response to vasopressin.
De novo lipogenesis is precisely regulated by nutritional and hormonal conditions. The genes encoding various enzymes involved in this process, such as fatty acid synthase (FASN), are transcriptionally activated in response to insulin. We showed that USF1, a key transcription factor for FASN activation, directly interacted with the Mediator subunit MED17 at the FASN promoter. This interaction recruited Mediator, which can bring POL II and other general transcription machinery to the complex. Moreover, we showed that MED17 was phosphorylated at Ser53 by casein kinase 2 (CK2) in the livers of fed mice or insulin-stimulated hepatocytes, but not in the livers of fasted mice or untreated hepatocytes. Furthermore, activation of the FASN promoter in response to insulin required this CK2-mediated phosphorylation event, which occurred only in the absence of p38 MAPK-mediated phosphorylation at Thr570 Overexpression of a nonphosphorylatable S53A MED17 mutant or knockdown of MED17, as well as CK2 knockdown or inhibition, impaired hepatic de novo fatty acid synthesis and decreased triglyceride content in mice. These results demonstrate that CK2-mediated phosphorylation of Ser53 in MED17 is required for the transcriptional activation of lipogenic genes in response to insulin.
Previously we established reporter cell lines for human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV) and identified several antiviral compounds against these viruses using the reporter cells. In this study, we found that one of the identified anti-HCMV compounds, a thienylcarboxamide derivative (coded as 133G4), was effective against not only HCMV but also VZV. The following findings indicate that 133G4 inhibits the activation of early gene promoters by HCMV IE2 and VZV IE62: i) 133G4 decreased the expression of HCMV early and late genes but not that of HCMV IE1/IE2 in HCMV-infected cells, ii) 133G4 inhibited the activation of several HCMV early gene promoters of transiently-transfected plasmids in HCMV-infected cells, and iii) in transient transfection assays, 133G4 decreased the activation of HCMV (or VZV) early gene promoters by HCMV IE2 (or VZV IE62) in the absence of other viral protein expression. The inhibition of early gene activation was observed in the human and African green monkey cell lines but not in the rodent cell lines, and the compound was not effective against murine CMV. In addition, VZV IE62 activated HCMV early promoters, and 133G4 still inhibited such promoter activation. Therefore, we hypothesized that 133G4 targets a cellular factor used commonly in activation of human herpesvirus promoters and examined whether 133G4 affects the functions of cellular proteins USF1, TBP, Med25 and EAP, the involvement of which in VZV IE62-dependent viral gene activation has been well characterized. Our experimental results using one-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays demonstrated that 133G4 did not inhibit the recruitment of USF1 or TBP to their binding sites, nor inhibited the direct interactions of VZV IE62 with Med25 and EAP. Thus, 133G4 is a unique anti-VZV and -HCMV compound, which warrants further studies to find out its inhibitory mechanism.
ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10) is the α-secretase that is involved in APP (β-amyloid precursor protein) processing. Enhancement of the nonamyloidogenic APP pathway by ADAM10 provides therapeutic potential for Alzheimer's disease (AD). By using high-throughput screening that targeted ADAM10, we determined that apicidin-an inhibitor of HDACs (histone deacetylases)-significantly increased mRNA and protein levels of ADAM10 in SH-SY5Y cells. A luciferase assay revealed that the nucleotides -444 to -300 in the ADAM10 promoter were sufficient to mediate this effect. In addition, knockdown of USF1 (upstream transcription factor 1) and HDAC2/3 prevented apicidin regulation of ADAM10. Moreover, USF1 acetylation was increased by apicidin, which enhanced the association of USF1 with HDAC2/3 and with the ADAM10 promoter. We further found that apicidin did not affect the phosphorylation of ERK or USF1; however, ERK inhibitor U0126 blocked the effect of apicidin on ADAM10. Finally, apicidin increased the level of α-site C-terminal fragment from APP and reduced the production of β-amyloid peptide 1-42. Collectively, our study provides evidence that ADAM10 expression can be regulated by HDAC2/3 inhibitor apicidin via USF1-dependent mechanisms in which ERK signaling plays an important role. Thus, HDAC regulation of ADAM10 might shed new light on the understanding of AD pathology.-Hu, X.-T., Zhu, B.-L., Zhao, L.-G., Wang, J.-W., Liu, L., Lai, Y.-J., He, L., Deng, X.-J., Chen, G.-J. Histone deacetylase inhibitor apicidin increases expression of the α-secretase ADAM10 through transcription factor USF1-mediated mechanisms.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that constitute a fundamental part of post-transcriptional gene regulation in mammalian cells. We have recently identified the intronic miR-483, which functions as an important regulator of protein synthesis during mild hypothermia in human and rodent cells. Since only very little is known about transcriptional regulation of intronic miRNAs and their host genes, we thoroughly investigated the regulation of miR-483 expression and its host gene IGF2 in HeLa cells. We demonstrate that miR-483 is regulated and expressed independently of its host gene IGF2 during mild hypothermia. Strikingly, we also discovered that miR-483 enhances its own transcription by up-regulation of the transcription factor USF1, which activates a promoter element upstream of the MIR483 gene. However, since the USF1 mRNA lacks binding sites for miR-483-5p and -3p, USF1 expression is likely enhanced in an indirect manner. Our results suggest that miR-483 may self-regulate its own expression independently of its host gene IGF2 in human HeLa cells. This points towards a novel feed-forward mechanism, in which selected intronic miRNAs may activate their own expression by transcriptional activation of upstream regulators.
The activation of TGF-β signaling contributes to abnormal EMT process and upstream stimulatory family1 (USF1) was recently found to activate the expression of TGF-β. However, the specific role of USF1 in melanoma has never been explored.
The expression of USF1 was analyzed using real-time PCR and Western blot. The changes of cell morphology were observed under a microscope. Cell migration was determined using in vitro scratch test. A specific siRNA was applied to knockdown of USF1.
The mRNA and protein levels of USF1 were significantly enhanced in melanoma cell lines, 1205-Lu, DO4, WM3211, and WM278, compared with normal human melanocytes PIG1. Overexpression of USF1 induced demonstrated an elongated and spindle-shaped morphology in the 1205-Lu cells. Meanwhile, USF1 induced the expression of α-SMA, Vimentin and Fibronectin, while the epithelial marker, E-cadherin (E-cad), was significantly decreased. Furthermore, in vitro scratch test demonstrated that overexpression of USF1 markedly enhanced 1205-Lu cell migration capacity at 24 h and 48 h. More importantly, knockdown of USF1 could partially reverse TGF-β1-treatment-induced changes of EMT markers as well as cell morphological changes.
We first demonstrate that overexpression of USF1 prompts the EMT process through the accumulation of TGF-β1 production in melanoma cells.
We evaluated DNA binding of the B-HLH family members TCF4 and USF1 using protein binding microarrays (PBMs) containing double-stranded DNA probes with cytosine on both strands or 5-methylcytosine (5mC) or 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) on one DNA strand and cytosine on the second strand. TCF4 preferentially bound the E-box motif (CAN|NTG) with strongest binding to the 8-mer CAG|GTGGT. 5mC uniformly decreases DNA binding of both TCF4 and USF1. The bulkier 5hmC also inhibited USF1 binding to DNA. In contrast, 5hmC dramatically enhanced TCF4 binding to E-box motifs ACAT|GTG and ACAC|GTG, being better bound than any 8-mer containing cytosine. Examination of X-ray structures of the closely related TCF3 and USF1 bound to DNA suggests TCF3 can undergo a conformational shift to preferentially bind to 5hmC while the USF1 basic region is bulkier and rigid precluding a conformation shift to bind 5hmC. These results greatly expand the regulatory DNA sequence landscape bound by TCF4.
Polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2) control cell identity by establishing facultative heterochromatin repressive domains at common sets of target genes. PRC1, which deposits H2Aub1 through the E3 ligases RING1A/B, forms six biochemically distinct subcomplexes depending on the assembled PCGF protein (PCGF1-PCGF6); however, it is yet unclear whether these subcomplexes have also specific activities. Here we show that PCGF1 and PCGF2 largely compensate for each other, while other PCGF proteins have high levels of specificity for distinct target genes. PCGF2 associates with transcription repression, whereas PCGF3 and PCGF6 associate with actively transcribed genes. Notably, PCGF3 and PCGF6 complexes can assemble and be recruited to several active sites independently of RING1A/B activity (therefore, of PRC1). For chromatin recruitment, the PCGF6 complex requires the combinatorial activities of its MGA-MAX and E2F6-DP1 subunits, while PCGF3 requires an interaction with the USF1 DNA binding transcription factor.
Although it has been investigated for many years, the physiological processes regulating prolificacy in sheep remains unclear because of regulation by many genes. To better understand the effects of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) comprising g.48462350C&gt;T in BMP2, g.58171856C&gt;G and g.58171886A&gt;C in BMP7, a population genetic analysis was conducted using data obtained from genotyping in 768 sheep from six breeds (three polytocous and three monotocous). The results indicate that all the sheep breeds were considered to conform to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P &gt; 0.05). The associations of these three SNPs with litter size in 384 Small Tail Han sheep were analyzed, therefore, and found to be correlated with fecundity as assessed by mean litter size (P &lt; 0.05). Bioinformatic analysis indicated there was a transmembrane domain change that occurred after a mutation in BMP2 at g.48462350C&gt;T, and changes involving transcription factors such as USF1, USF2 and INMS1 in the BMP7 promoter region might be involved in greater sheep prolificacy.
Previous studies have revealed that dysregulation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can facilitate carcinogenesis. This study aims to investigate the biological role of a certain lncRNA in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). According to the data of TCGA database, high expression of long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 1048 (LINC01048) is an unfavorable prognostic factor for patients with CSCC. Therefore, we further detected the expression pattern of LINC01048 in CSCC tissues. Obviously, LINC01048 was expressed higher in the CSCC tissues and recurrence tissues compared with that in adjacent normal tissues and non-recurrence tissues. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed the negative correlation between LINC01048 expression and the overall survival and disease-free survival of CSCC patients. Subsequently, functional assays were conducted to prove the inhibitory effect of silenced LINC01048 on the proliferation and apoptosis of CSCC cells. Mechanistically, LINC01048 was proved to be transcriptionally activated by USF1. Pathway analysis and western blot assay showed that knockdown of LINC01048 led to the activation of Hippo pathway. Moreover, YAP1, a Hippo pathway factor, was positively regulated by LINC01048. Further mechanism investigation revealed that LINC01048 increased the binding of TAF15 to YAP1 promoter to transcriptionally activate YAP1 in CSCC cells. Finally, rescue assays demonstrated that YAP1 involved in LINC01048-mediated CSCC cell proliferation and apoptosis. In conclusion, USF1-induced upregulation of LINC01048 promoted CSCC by interacting with TAF15 to upregulate YAP1.
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells that can be widely used in stem cell therapy. However, few studies have revealed the potential mechanisms of the changes in aging MSC.
In this study, microarray data GSE35955 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Then limma package in R was used to filtrate differentially expressed genes (DEGs), Transcription factors (TFs) were predicted by DCGL package. After predicting TFs, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and TF-mediated transcriptional regulation network were constructed. The functional and pathway enrichment analysis of screened DEGs, hub genes and TFs were conducted by the DAVID.
Totally 156 up-regulated DEGs and 343 down-regulated DEGs were obtained. 6 hub genes (CTNNB1, PPP2R1A, FYN, MAPK1, PIK3C2A and EP300) were obtained from PPI network. 11 TFs (CREB1, CUX1, EGR1, EP300, FOXC1, HSF2, MEF2A, PLAU, SP1, STAT1 and USF1) for DEGs were predicted and 2 highly scored co-expression relationships (EP300-PPP2R1A and STAT1-FOXC1) were acquired from the TF-mediated transcriptional regulation network.
The discovery of the hub genes, TFs and pathways might contribute to the understanding of genetic and molecular functions of aging-related changes in MSC. Further validation studies on genes and TFs such as CTNNB1, FYN, PPP2R1A, MAPK1, EP300 and related biological processes and pathways, including adherens junction, DNA damage caused from oxidative stress, attribution of telomere, MSC differentiation and epigenetic regulation, are urgent for clinical prevention and treatment.
The organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1, SLC22A1) is strongly expressed in the human liver and facilitates the hepatic uptake of drugs such as morphine, metformin, tropisetron, sumatriptan and fenoterol and of endogenous substances such as thiamine. OCT1 expression is inter-individually highly variable. Here, we analyzed SNPs in the OCT1 promoter concerning their potential contribution to the variability in OCT1 expression. Using electrophoretic mobility shift and luciferase reporter gene assays in HepG2, Hep3B, and Huh7 cell lines, we identified the SNPs -1795G&gt;A (rs6935207) and -201C&gt;G (rs58812592) as having effects on transcription factor binding and/or promoter activity. The A-allele of the -1795G&gt;A SNP showed allele-specific binding of the transcription factor NF-Y leading to 2.5-fold increased enhancer activity of the artificial SV40 promoter. However, the -1795G&gt;A SNP showed no significant effects on the native OCT1 promoter activity. Furthermore, the -1795G&gt;A SNP was not associated with the pharmacokinetics of metformin, fenoterol, sumatriptan and proguanil in healthy individuals or tropisetron efficacy in patients undergoing chemotherapy. Allele-dependent differences in USF1/2 binding and nearly total loss in OCT1 promoter activity were detected for the G-allele of -201C&gt;G, but the SNP is apparently very rare. In conclusion, common OCT1 promoter SNPs have only minor effects on OCT1 expression.
Recent studies indicate that circular RNA (circRNA) plays a pivotal role in cancer progression. Here, we sought to investigate its role in breast cancer.
CircANKS1B (a circRNA originated from exons 5 to 8 of the ANKS1B gene, hsa_circ_0007294) was identified by RNA-sequencing and validated by qRT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. Clinical breast cancer samples were used to evaluate the expression of circANKS1B and its associations with clinicopathological features and prognosis. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments in cell lines and mouse xenograft models were performed to support clinical findings and elucidate the function and underlying mechanisms of circANKS1B in breast cancer.
CircANKS1B was significantly up-regulated in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) compared with non-TNBC tissues and cell lines. Increased circANKS1B expression was closely associated with lymph node metastasis and advanced clinical stage and served as an independent risk factor for overall survival of breast cancer patients. Functional studies revealed that circANKS1B promoted breast cancer invasion and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo by inducing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), while had no effect on breast cancer growth. Mechanistically, circANKS1B abundantly sponged miR-148a-3p and miR-152-3p to increase the expression of transcription factor USF1, which could transcriptionally up-regulate TGF-β1 expression, resulting in activating TGF-β1/Smad signaling to promote EMT. Moreover, we found that circANKS1B biogenesis in breast cancer was promoted by splicing factor ESRP1, whose expression was also regulated by USF1.
Our data uncover an essential role of the novel circular RNA circANKS1B in the metastasis of breast cancer, which demonstrate that therapeutic targeting of circANKS1B may better prevent breast cancer metastasis.
Organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3) is expressed in various organs in humans and plays an important role in the transport of organic cations and drugs including metformin. In this study, we identified genetic variations of the OCT3 promoter and functionally characterized each variant by in vitro assays. Next, the association between the functional haplotype of the OCT3 promoter and pharmacokinetics of metformin was evaluated. In our study population, 7 variations and 2 major haplotypes were identified, of which H2 haplotype yielded a significantly higher luciferase activity than did the wild type. Two variants of H2, c.-1603G &gt; A and c.-1547T &gt; G, yielded significantly lower luciferase activities, whereas the luciferase activity of another variant, c.-29G &gt; A, was significantly higher. Two transcription factors, Sp1 and USF1, were involved in the regulation of OCT3 transcription. Analysis of clinical data revealed that 25 subjects, either homozygous or heterozygous for H2, showed increased AUCinf and Cmax by 17.2% and 15.9%, respectively [P = 0.016 and 0.031, GMR (90% CI) = 1.17 (1.06-1.29) and 1.17 (1.04-1.31), respectively], compared to the 20 subjects in the control group. Our study suggests that an OCT3 promoter haplotype affects the pharmacokinetics of metformin in Koreans as well as the OCT3 transcription rate.
BACKGROUND Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) has had a significant increase over the past 4 decades. The pathophysiological role of the cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2) gene and factors responsible for the expression in GEP-NETs is of clinical value. Current study determined the expression of cox-2 gene in human GEP-NET tissues and corresponding cell lines, investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of cox-2 gene expression and assessed the effect of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on both anchorage-dependent and independent growth of GEP-NET cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS GEP-NET tissues and QGP-1, BON, and LCC-18 GEP-NET cell lines were used. The expression of cox-2 gene was analyzed by immunohistochemistry, western blot, RT-PCR, and enzyme immunoassay. Transient transfection and luciferase assays along with electrophoretic mobility shift assays were conducted to explore the regulation of cox-2 gene expression. The effect of COX-inhibitors on GEP-NET cell growth was determined by proliferation assays and colony growth assessment. RESULTS We found 87.8% of GEP-NET tissues stained positive for COX-2. QGP-1 and LCC-18 cells expressed cox-2 gene. PGE2 (prostaglandin E2) amounts quantified in the supernatants of NET cells matched to cox-2 expression level. The CRE-E-box element (-56 to -48 bp) and binding of USF1, USF2, and CREB transcription factors to this proximal promoter element were essential for cox-2 promoter activity in GEP-NET cells. COX-2-specific inhibitor NS-398 potently and dose-dependently inhibited PGE2 release from QGP-1 cells. Interestingly, both NS-398 and acetylic salicylic acid effectively suppressed proliferation of QGP-1 and BON cells in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS The majority of GEP-NETs over express cox-2 gene. The binding of CREB and USF-1/-2 transcription factors to a proximal, overlapping CRE-Ebox element is the underlying mechanism for cox-2 gene expression. NSAIDs potently suppressed the proliferations and may offer a novel approach for chemoprevention and therapy of GEP-NETs.
Epigenetic modulation may underlie the progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Involvement of TGFB1 in mesangial fibrosis of DN led us to hypothesize that Tgfb1 DNA demethylation contributes to progression of DN. In primary mesangial cells from diabetic (db/db) mouse kidneys, demethylation of Tgfb1 DNA and upregulation of Tgfb1 mRNA progressed simultaneously. USF1 binding site in Tgfb1 promoter region were demethylated, and binding of USF1 increased, with decreased binding of DNMT1 in db/db compared with control. Given downregulation of Tgfb1 expression by folic acid, antioxidant Tempol reversed DNA demethylation, with increased and decreased recruitment of DNMT1 and USF1 to the promoter, resulting in decreased Tgfb1 expression in db/db mice. Addition of H2O2 to mesangial cells induced DNA demethylation and upregulated Tgfb1 expression. Finally, Tempol attenuated mesangial fibrosis in db/db mice. We conclude that aberrant DNA methylation of Tgfb1 due to ROS overproduction play a key to mesangial fibrosis during DN progression.
PAS kinase 1 (Psk1) is a key regulator of respiration in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Herein the molecular mechanisms of this regulation are explored through the characterization of its substrate, Centromere binding factor 1 (Cbf1). CBF1-deficient yeast displayed a significant decrease in cellular respiration, while PAS kinase-deficient yeast, or yeast harboring a Cbf1 phosphosite mutant (T211A) displayed a significant increase. Transmission electron micrographs showed an increased number of mitochondria in PAS kinase-deficient yeast consistent with the increase in respiration. Although the CBF1-deficient yeast did not appear to have an altered number of mitochondria, a mitochondrial proteomics study revealed significant differences in the mitochondrial composition of CBF1-deficient yeast including altered Atp3 levels, a subunit of the mitochondrial F1-ATP synthase complex. Both beta-galactosidase reporter assays and western blot analysis confirmed direct transcriptional control of ATP3 by Cbf1 In addition, we confirmed the regulation of yeast lipid genes LAC1 and LAG1 by Cbf1 The human homolog of Cbf1, Upstream transcription factor 1 (USF1), is also known to be involved in lipid biogenesis. Herein, we provide the first evidence for a role of USF1 in respiration since it appeared to complement Cbf1 in vivo as determined by respiration phenotypes. In addition, we confirmed USF1 as a substrate of human PAS kinase (hPASK) in vitro Combined, our data supports a model in which Cbf1/USF1 functions to partition glucose toward respiration and away from lipid biogenesis, while PAS kinase inhibits respiration in part through the inhibition of Cbf1/USF1.
Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) is the most prevalent primary dyslipidemia; however, it frequently remains undiagnosed and its precise definition is a subject of controversy. FCHL is characterized by fluctuations in serum lipid concentrations and may present as mixed hyperlipidemia, isolated hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, or as a normal serum lipid profile in combination with abnormally elevated levels of apolipoprotein B. FCHL is an oligogenic primary lipid disorder, which can occur due to the interaction of several contributing variants and mutations along with environmental triggers. Controversies surrounding the relevance of identifying FCHL as a cause of isolated hypertriglyceridemia and a differential diagnosis of familial hypertriglyceridemia are offset by the description of associations with USF1 and other genetic traits that are unique for FCHL and that are shared with other conditions with similar pathophysiological mechanisms. Patients with FCHL are at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality and have a high frequency of comorbidity with other metabolic conditions such as type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, steatohepatitis, and the metabolic syndrome. Management usually requires lipid-lowering therapy directed toward reducing cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations along with cardiovascular risk protection. In recent years, the number of research studies on FCHL has been decreasing, mainly due to a lack of recognition of its impact on disease burden and comorbidity and the complexity in identifying probands for studies. This creates areas of opportunity to develop research for FCHL in epidemiology, genetics, pathophysiology, therapeutics, and cardiovascular risk management, which are discussed in depth in this review. (REV INVEST CLIN. 2018;70:224-36).
The current study mainly aims to evaluate the expression pattern and underlying mechanism of upstream stimulating factor 1 (USF1) in the muscle tissues of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) patients. In accordance with previous findings, our data showed that muscle strength was significantly decreased in KOA patients compared with controls. Furthermore, several inflammatory factors, including tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), IL-8, IL-6 and MCP-1, were associated with reduced muscle strength in KOA patients. Not surprisingly, NF-κB signaling was significantly activated in the muscle tissues of KOA patients compared with control individuals. Furthermore, we showed that USF1 was increased in the muscles of KOA patients compared with controls. More importantly, overexpression of USF1 in primary human skeletal muscle cells significantly increased the activation of NF-κB signaling as well as the levels of pro-inflammatory factors. In summary, we showed novel data that the upregulation of USF1 promoted NF-κB activation-induced inflammatory responses in muscle tissues of KOA patients.
DGKθ protein expression levels are closely related to the development of diseases including diabetes, cancer, and neuronal disease. To investigate the transcriptional regulation of the DGKθ gene, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate a DGKθ endogenous promoter luciferase reporter HepG2 cell line, in which the endogenous DGKθ promoter controls the expression of the luciferase reporter gene. To test the cell line, FXR, the transcription factor for upregulating the expression of DGKθ gene, was used to validate the cell line. Furthermore, the reported agonists for the expression of DGKθ, cAMP and GW4064, the known inhibitor for DGKθ enzyme activity, R59949, and a potential regulator for DGKθ enzyme expression, EGCG (the major catechin in green tea), were applied to the reporter cell line. The results indicated that these reagents could significantly regulate the expression of reporter luciferase. Finally, four transcription factors (E2F1, c-Myc, USF1, and Bmal1) potentially binding to the DGKθ gene's upstream promoter region were tested. DGKθ expression was upregulated by c-Myc and downregulated by E2F1, which was also confirmed in wild-type HepG2 cells. We found that the cell line's luciferase activity was directly correlated with DGKθ endogenous promoter activity, suggesting that it is liable and sensitive for studying DGKθ transcriptional regulation. The study provides a useful tool for high-throughput drug screening for the treatment of DGKθ-involved diseases.
To uncover the underlying pathogenesis of thyroid associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) and explore potential biomarkers of this disease.
The expression profile GSE9340, which was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database, included 18 specimens from 10 TAO patients and 8 hyperthyroidism patients without ophthalmopathy. The platform was HumanRef-8 v2 Expression BeadChip. Raw data were normalized using preprocess. Core package and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified based on t-test with limma package of R. Functional enrichment analyses were performed recruiting the DAVID tool. Based on STRING database, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed, from which a module was extracted. The functional enrichment for genes in the module was performed by the BinGO plugin.
In total, 861 DEGs (433 up-regulated and 428 down-regulated) between TAO patients and hyperthyroidism patients without ophthalmopathy were identified. Crucial nodes in the PPI network included TPX2, CDCA5, PRC1, KIF23 and MKI67, which were also remarkable in the module and all enriched in cell cycle process. Additionally, MKI67 was highly correlated with TAO. Besides, the DEGs of GTF2F1, SMC3, USF1 and ZNF263 were predicted as transcription factors (TFs).
Several crucial genes are identified such as TPX2, CDCA5, PRC1 and KIF23, which all might play significant roles in TAO via the regulation of cell cycle process. Regulatory relationships between TPX2 and CDCA5 as well as between PRC1 and KIF23 may exist. Additionally, MKI67 may be a potent biomarker of TAO, and SMC3 and ZNF263 may exert their roles as TFs in TAO progression.
Rationale: Chitinase 3-like 1 (Chi3L1) protein is up-regulated in various diseases including solid cancers. According to Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS)/Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM)/Differentially Expressed Gene (DEG) analyses, Chi3L1 is associated with 38 cancers, and more highly associated with cancer compared to other oncogenes such as EGFR, TNFα, etc. However, the mechanisms and pathways by which Chi3L1 is associated with cancer are not clear. In current study, we investigated the role of Chi3L1 in lung metastasis. Methods: We performed the differentially expressed gene analysis to explore the genes which are associated with Chi3L1 using the web-based platform from Biomart. We investigated the metastases in lung tissues of C57BL/6 mice injected with B16F10 melanoma following treatment with Ad-shChi3L1. We also investigated the expression of USF1 and Chi3L1 in Chi3L1 KD mice lung tissues by Western blotting and IHC. We also analyzed lung cancer cells metastases induced by Chi3L1 using migration and cell proliferation assay in human lung cancer cell lines. The involvement of miR-125a-3p in Chi3L1 regulation was determined by miRNA qPCR and luciferase reporter assay. Results: We showed that melanoma metastasis in lung tissues was significantly reduced in Chi3L1 knock-down mice, accompanied by down-regulation of MMP-9, MMP-13, VEGF, and PCNA in Chi3L1 knock-down mice lung tissue, as well as in human lung cancer cell lines. We also found that USF1 was conversely expressed against Chi3L1. USF1 was increased by knock-down of Chi3L1 in mice lung tissues, as well as in human lung cancer cell lines. In addition, knock-down of USF1 increased Chi3L1 levels in addition to augmenting metastasis cell migration and proliferation in mice model, as well as in human cancer cell lines. Moreover, in human lung tumor tissues, the expression of Chi3L1 was increased but USF1 was decreased in a stage-dependent manner. Finally, Chi3L1 expression was strongly regulated by the indirect translational suppressing activity of USF1 through induction of miR-125a-3p, a target of Chi3L1. Conclusion: Metastases in mice lung tissues and human lung cancer cell lines were decreased by KD of Chi3L1. USF1 bound to the Chi3L1 promoter, however, Chi3L1 expression was decreased by USF1, despite USF1 enhancing the transcriptional activity of Chi3L1. We found that USF1 induced miR-125a-3p levels which suppressed Chi3L1 expression. Ultimately, our results suggest that lung metastasis is suppressed by knock-down of Chi3L1 through miR-125a-3p-mediated up-regulation of USF1.
Upstream transcription factor 1 (USF1) regulates the transcription of many genes related to cell and organism survival processes such as stress and immune response, regulation of cellular senesce, and carcinogenesis. In this study, our aim was to investigate the effect of USF1 single nucleotide variations (SNVs) on longevity in the Vitality 90+ study, a population-based study of nonagenarians (90 ±1 years of age) living in the area of Tampere municipality, Finland. Altogether 509 voluntary nonagenarians (115 males, 394 females) were genotyped using the 5'-nuclease assay for rs2774279G &gt; A, rs2516839T &gt; C, and rs2073658C &gt; T SNVs. During the 4 years of follow-up, the total mortality rate was 64.2%. In the study, we found that the frequency of C-allele of rs2516839 among nonsurviving nonagenarians (52.5%) was higher than those who survived (41.2%; P = 0.0006, odds ratio = 1.575, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.215-2.041). Furthermore, carriage of this variation and its haplotypes had a significant gender by genotype interaction (P &lt; 0.05) on mortality. Kaplan-Meier log-rank test during 4-years of follow-up showed significantly higher mortality rate in the case of CC genotype carriage than other genotype carriages in nonagenarian women (P &lt; 0.0001). In addition, after adjusting for age in Cox regression analysis, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, infectious disease, dementia, and living place (nursing home or home), CC genotype of rs2516839T &gt; C was found to be associated with shorter life expectancy in nonagenarian women (hazard ratio = 2.27; 95% CI, 1.34-3.85 P = 0.002). In conclusion, rs2516839 variation and related haplotypes of the USF1 gene are strongly related to all-cause mortality in Finnish nonagenarians, especially among women.
The detailed embryonic etiology and pathogenesis of anorectal malformations (ARMs) remains unclear. Recent studies have shown that gene expression abnormalities were the key factors that result in ARMs. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were reported as the 'transcriptional noise' within the genome. The expression profiles of lncRNA and mRNA remain less characterized in the pathogenesis of ARMs. Furthermore, the function of lncRNAs in the regulation of this process has not been investigated so far. Therefore, this current study was aimed to integrate lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles in terminal hindgut of ethylenethiourea (ETU)-induced ARM rats using Agilents lncRNA and mRNA co-expression microarrays.
ARM model was induced with ethylenethiourea (ETU) on gestational day 10. Cesarean deliveries were conducted to collect the embryos on gestational day 20. For the extraction of total RNA, 1-cm terminal hindgut tissues were collected from three fetal rats with similair weights. The microarrays and quantitative RT-PCR analysis were conducted to evaluate the lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles in normal fetal rats and ARM fetal rats.
Compared with control group, 164 lncRNAs were observed to be aberrantly expressed (FC ≥ 2; P &lt; 0.05) in ARM group, including 36 upregulated and 128 downregulated, while 772 mRNAs were observed to be aberrantly expressed (FC ≥ 2; P &lt; 0.05) in the terminal hindgut, including 350 up-regulated and 422 down-regulated. The differential expression profiles between the ARM and the control group were used for gene ontology (GO) and pathway analysis. A subset of those RNAs was identified to be closely related to the development process of ARMs. The four RNAs that were differentially expressed between the two groups were selected for qPCR validation, and the results were in line with the microarray data. In addition, the lncRNAs and mRNA co-expression network was established according to the correlation analysis. We predicted the functions of transregulatory lncRNAs by the TFs (transcription factors) which might modulate their expression. In the core network of lncRNA-TF pairs, the lncRNAs can be classified into 5 categories of pathways governed by Jun, c-Myc, Usf1, Alf2, and Stat3.
From the above results, it can be suggested that these aberrant lncRNAs might participate in the pathogenesis of ARM, and our present work may provide new research directions for future studies of ARMs.
Previous studies indicate that the transcription factor upstream stimulating factor 1 (USF1) is involved in the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism. However, the role of USF1 in lipid-induced autophagy remains unknown. Interestingly, we found that USF1 overexpression suppresses autophagy-related gene expression in HepG2 cells. Further assays confirmed that USF1 could transcriptionally activate mTOR expression, thereby suppressing rapamycin-induced autophagy in HepG2 cells. Moreover, pharmacological activation of autophagy with rapamycin decreases the numbers and sizes of lipid droplets (LDs) in HepG2 cells exposed to an oleate/palmitate mixture. Of note, USF1 upregulation decreases colocalization of LDs and autophagosomes. In conclusion, our data provide evidence that USF1 contributes to abnormal lipid accumulation in the liver by suppressing autophagy via regulation of mTOR transcription.
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) contribute to the development of multiple malignant tumors. Here, we focused on the biological function and underlying molecular mechanism of an lncRNA, nuclear-enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1), in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).
In vitro experiments were conducted to determine the biological effects of NEAT1 in LUAD cells. A luciferase activity reporter assay was performed to corroborate the interaction between NEAT1 and miR-193a-3p. Data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), Oncomine, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and our in-house reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) were combined to examine the expression of NEAT1 and miR-193a-3p in LUAD. To further explore the regulatory mechanism of NEAT1, we searched for putative target genes of miR-193a-3p from 12 online prediction databases and determined genes positively correlated with NEAT1 as candidate targets. Furthermore, we analyzed the expression of these selected genes using data from TCGA.
In vitro experiments showed that knockdown of NEAT1 in LUAD cells markedly restrained cell proliferation, invasion, and migration and stimulated cell apoptosis. The dual-luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that miR-193a-3p directly targeted NEAT1 at its 3'-UTR. We then detected NEAT1 and miR-193a-3p in LUAD cells and normal lung epithelial cells and discovered high expression of NEAT1 and low expression of miR-193a-3p in LUAD cell lines. Simultaneously, the pooled results from the GEO, Oncomine, TCGA, and in-house RT-qPCR showed that the NEAT1 expression increased while the miR-193a-3p expression decreased in LUAD tissues versus normal lung tissues. Furthermore, the USF1 gene was not only upregulated in LUAD, but also positively correlated with NEAT1, suggesting that NEAT1 may function as a ceRNA to sponge miR-193a-3p and abrogate the inhibitory effect of miR-193a-3p on USF1.
Our findings indicate that NEAT1 plays important roles in the occurrence and progression of LUAD. It may exert its role by acting as a ceRNA to regulate miR-193a-3p.
The organization of the five β-type globin genes on chromosome 11 reflects the timing of expression during erythroid cell development, with the embryonic ε-globin gene being located at the 5' end, followed by the two fetal γ-globin genes, and with the adult β- and δ-globin genes being located at the 3' end. Here, we functionally characterized a DNase I-hypersensitive site (HS) located 4 kb upstream of the Gγ-globin gene (HBG-4kb HS). This site is occupied by transcription factors USF1, USF2, EGR1, MafK, and NF-E2 in the human erythroleukemia cell line K562 and exhibits histone modifications typical for enhancers. We generated a synthetic zinc finger (ZF) DNA-binding domain targeting the HBG-4kb HS (HBG-4kb ZF). The HBG-4kb ZF interacted with the target site in vitro and in the context of cells with a high affinity and specificity. Direct delivery of the HBG-4kb ZF to K562 and primary human erythroid cells caused a reduction in γ-globin gene expression which was associated with decreased binding of transcription factors and active histone marks at and downstream of the HS. The data demonstrate that the HBG-4kb HS is important for fetal globin production and suggest that it may act by opening chromatin in a directional manner.
On the basis of their characteristics, we presume that developmental stage-specific hepatocytes should have the ability to induce maturation of hepatoma cells. A regulatory circuit formed by hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4α, HNF-1α, HNF-6 and the upstream stimulatory factor (USF-1) play a key role in the maturation of embryonic hepatocytes; however, it is unclear whether the regulatory circuit mediates the embryonic induction of hepatoma cell maturation. In this study, 12.5-d to 15.5-d mouse embryonic hepatocytes or their medium were used to coculture or treat HepG2 cells, and the induced maturation was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. In the induced HepG2 cells, the components of the regulatory circuit were detected, their cross-regulation was evaluated and HNF-4α RNA interference was performed. We found that 13.5-d to 14.5-d embryonic hepatocytes could induce HepG2 cell maturation, demonstrated by morphological changes, increased maturation markers and decreased c-Myc and α-fetoprotein (AFP) in vitro. The majority of HepG2 tumors were eliminated by 13.5-d embryonic induction in vivo. All components of the regulatory circuit were upregulated and the binding of HNF-4α, HNF-1α, HNF-6 and USF-1 to their target sites was promoted to rebuild the regulatory circuit in the induced HepG2 cells. Moreover, RNA interference targeting HNF-4α, which is the core of the regulatory circuit, attenuated the induced maturation of HepG2 cells with downregulation of the regulatory circuit. These results revealed that developmental stage-specific hepatocytes could induce the maturation of HepG2 cells by rebuilding the regulatory circuit. 
The rate of secretion of αs2-casein into bovine milk is approximately 25% of that of β-casein, yet mammary expression of their respective mRNA transcripts (csn1s2 and csn2) is not different. Our objective was to identify molecular mechanisms that explain the difference in translation efficiency between csn1s2 and csn2. Cell-free translational efficiency of csn2 was 5 times that of csn1s2. Transcripts of csn1s2 distributed into heavier polysomes than csn2 transcripts, indicating an attenuation of elongation and/or termination. Stimulatory and inhibitory effects of the 5' and 3' UTRs on translational efficiency were different with luciferase and casein sequences in the coding regions. Substituting the 5' and 3' UTRs from csn2 into csn1s2 did not improve csn1s2 translation, implicating the coding region itself in the translation difference. Deletion of a 28-codon fragment from the 3' terminus of the csn1s2 coding region, which displays codons with low correlations to cell fitness, increased translation to a par with csn2. We conclude that the usage of the last 28 codons of csn1s2 is the main regulatory element that attenuates its expression and is responsible for the differential translational expression of csn1s2 and csn2. 
The aim of the present study was to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of osteoporosis and to identify novel candidate genes involved in this disease. The gene expression profile of GSE35958 was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus, including five samples of human mesenchymal stem cells from patients with osteoporosis and four control samples. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were initially identified following an analysis using Student's t-test. Subsequently, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the significant pathways was constructed, based on the Human Protein Reference Database. In the significant pathways, DEGs were screened using cut-off criteria of FDR&lt;0.1 and |log(2)FC|&gt;1.5. A co-change network for pathways was also constructed using the method of cumulative hypergeometric probability distribution. Finally, the transcriptional regulatory network for DEGs was constructed based on the TRANSFAC database. In total, 1,127 DEGs, including 554 upregulated and 573 downregulated DEGs, were screened. The constructed PPI network for the DEGs involved in the two significant pathways, including focal adhesion and lysosome, demonstrated that the five DEGs with a high degree (&gt;60) were β-catenin, SHC-transforming protein 1, RAC-α serine/threonine-protein kinase, caveolin 1 and filamin A, with degrees of 135, 117, 117, 73 and 63, respectively. The pathway with the degree of 22 in the constructed co-change network was neuroactive ligand receptor interaction. The nine genes with a high (≥ 9) degree in the constructed transcriptional regulatory network were REL-associated protein, upstream stimulatory factor 1, specificity protein 1, Fos-related antigen 1, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A, upstream stimulatory factor 2, ETS domain-containing protein Elk1, JUND and retinoic acid receptor α, with degrees of 29, 27, 19, 18, 17, 13, 11, 11 and 9, respectively. The DEGs with high degree in the PPI and transcriptional regulatory networks may be candidate target molecules, which may be used to monitor, diagnose and treat osteoporosis.
The progressive restriction of differentiation potential from pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to tissue-specific stem cells involves widespread epigenetic reprogramming, including modulation of DNA methylation patterns. Skeletal muscle stem cells are required for the growth, maintenance, and regeneration of skeletal muscle. To investigate the contribution of DNA methylation to the establishment of the myogenic program, we analyzed ESCs, skeletal muscle stem cells in proliferating (myoblasts) and differentiating conditions (myotubes), and mature myofibers. About 1.000 differentially methylated regions were identified during muscle-lineage determination and terminal differentiation, mainly located in gene bodies and intergenic regions. As a whole, myogenic stem cells showed a gain of DNA methylation, while muscle differentiation was accompanied by loss of DNA methylation in CpG-poor regions. Notably, the hypomethylated regions in myogenic stem cells were neighbored by enhancer-type chromatin, suggesting the involvement of DNA methylation in the regulation of cell-type specific enhancers. Interestingly, we demonstrated the hypomethylation of the muscle cell-identity Myf5 super-enhancer only in muscle cells. Furthermore, we observed that upstream stimulatory factor 1 binding to Myf5 super-enhancer occurs upon DNA demethylation in myogenic stem cells. Taken altogether, we characterized the unique DNA methylation signature of skeletal muscle stem cells and highlighted the importance of DNA methylation-mediated regulation of cell identity Myf5 super-enhancer during cellular differentiation.
Metallothioneins (MTs) are metal-binding proteins involved in diverse processes, including metal homeostasis and detoxification, the oxidative stress response and cell proliferation. Aberrant expression and silencing of these genes are important in a number of diseases. Several positive regulators of MT genes, including metal-responsive element-binding transcription factor (MTF)-1 and upstream stimulatory factor (USF)-1, have been identified and mechanisms of induction have been well described. However, the negative regulators of MT genes remain to be elucidated. Previous studies from the group of the present review have revealed that the hematopoietic master transcription factor, PU.1, directly represses the expression levels of MT genes through its epigenetic activities, and upregulation of MT results in the potent inhibition of myeloid differentiation. The present review focuses on PU.1 and several other negative regulators of this gene, including PZ120, DNA methyltransferase 3a with Mbd3 and Brg1 complex, CCAAT enhancer binding protein α and Ku protein, and describes the suppression of the MT genes through these transcription factors.
Human Taspase1 is essential for development and cancer by processing critical regulators, such as the mixed-lineage leukemia protein. Likewise, its ortholog, trithorax, is cleaved by Drosophila Taspase1 (dTaspase1), implementing a functional coevolution. To uncover novel mechanism regulating protease function, we performed a functional analysis of dTaspase1 and its comparison to the human ortholog. dTaspase1 contains an essential nucleophile threonine(195), catalyzing cis cleavage into its α- and β-subunits. A cell-based assay combined with alanine scanning mutagenesis demonstrated that the target cleavage motif for dTaspase1 (Q(3)[F/I/L/M](2)D(1)↓G(1')X(2')X(3')) differs significantly from the human ortholog (Q(3)[F,I,L,V](2)D(1)↓G(1')x(2')D(3')D(4')), predicting an enlarged degradome containing 70 substrates for Drosophila. In contrast to human Taspase1, dTaspase1 shows no discrete localization to the nucleus/nucleolus due to the lack of the importin-α/nucleophosmin1 interaction domain (NoLS) conserved in all vertebrates. Consequently, dTaspase1 interacts with neither the Drosophila nucleoplasmin-like protein nor human nucleophosmin1. The impact of localization on the protease's degradome was confirmed by demonstrating that dTaspase1 did not efficiently process nuclear substrates, such as upstream stimulatory factor 2. However, genetic introduction of the NoLS into dTaspase1 restored its nucleolar localization, nucleophosmin1 interaction, and efficient cleavage of nuclear substrates. We report that evolutionary functional divergence separating vertebrates from invertebrates can be achieved for proteases by a transport/localization-regulated mechanism.
To date, a complete understanding of the molecular events leading to DNA replication origin activation in mammalian cells still remains elusive. In this work, we report the results of a high resolution chromatin immunoprecipitation study to detect proteins interacting with the human Lamin B2 replication origin. In addition to the pre-RC component ORC4 and to the transcription factors USF and HOXC13, we found that 2 components of the AP-1 transcription factor, c-Fos and c-Jun, are also associated with the origin DNA during the late G1 phase of the cell cycle and that these factors interact with ORC4. Both DNA replication and AP-1 factor binding to the origin region were perturbed by cell treatment with merbarone, a topoisomerase II inhibitor, suggesting that DNA topology is essential for determining origin function. 
Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death in women. Prolonged exposure to the ovarian hormones estrogen and progesterone increases the risk of breast cancer. Although estrogen is known as a primary factor in mammary carcinogenesis, very few studies have investigated the role of progesterone. Receptor activator for nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL) plays an important role in progesterone-induced mammary carcinogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism underlying RANKL-induced mammary carcinogenesis remains unknown. In our current study, we show that RANKL induces glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI-1) in estrogen-induced progesterone-mediated mammary carcinogenesis. In vivo experiments were carried out using ACI rats and in vitro experiments were carried out in MCF-7 cells. In ACI rats, mifepristone significantly reduced the incidence of mammary tumors. Likewise, mifepristone also inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7 cells. Hormone treatments induced RANKL, receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK), and NF-κB in a protein kinase B-dependent manner and inhibited apoptosis by activation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2 in mammary tumors and MCF-7 cells. Mechanistic studies in MCF-7 cells reveal that RANKL induced upstream stimulatory factor-1 and NF-κB, resulting in subsequent activation of their downstream target GLI-1. We have identified that progesterone mediates estrogen-induced mammary carcinogenesis through activation of GLI-1 in a RANKL-dependent manner. 
Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is the major physiological inhibitor of tissue-type plasminogen activator in plasma and the most important regulator of the fibrinolytic pathway. The 4G/5G polymorphism (rs1799889) in the PAI-1 promoter is associated with altered PAI-1 transcription. We have identified a new 4G/5G allele, in which a T is inserted near the 4G tract or replaces a G in the 5G tract, forming a T plus 4G (T4G) region.
This new variant was first identified in two women, one had experienced juvenile myocardial infarction, the other repeated miscarriage; both had increased PAI-1 plasma activity. In view of the important influence of this promoter region on PAI-1 protein plasma level, we performed in vitro evaluation of the effects of the T4G variant on the transcription activity of the PAI-1 gene promoter.
In silico prediction analysis showed that presence of the T4G allele disrupts the E-Box region upstream of the T4G variant, altering the affinity of the target sequence for E-Box binding factors like upstream stimulatory factor-1 (USF-1). Basal T4G promoter activity was 50% higher compared to 4G and 5G variants, but it was less stimulated by USF-1 overexpression. We also analyzed the effects of IL-1β and IL-6 on the PAI-1 promoter activity of our three constructs and showed that the T4G variant was less affected by IL-1β than the other variants. These findings indicate that the T4G variant may be a novel risk factor for thrombotic events.
The liver is the central organ of fatty acid and triglyceride metabolism. Oxidation and synthesis of fatty acids and triglycerides is under the control of peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) α. Impairment of these receptors' function contributes to the accumulation of triglycerides in the liver resulting in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) was shown to regulate gene expression in the liver involving PPARγ transcriptional activity. In this study we questioned whether uPA modulates triglyceride metabolism in the liver, and investigated the mechanisms involved in the observed processes.
Huh7 hepatoma cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of uPA for 24 h uPA dose-dependently increased the cellular triglyceride mass, and this effect resulted from increased de novo triglyceride synthesis mediated by the enzyme diglyceride acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2). Also, the amount of free fatty acids was highly up regulated by uPA through activation of the transcription factor SREBP-1. Chemical activation of PPARα further increased uPA-stimulated triglyceride synthesis, whereas inhibition of p38, an upstream activator of PPARα, completely abolished the stimulatory effect of uPA on both triglyceride synthesis and DGAT2 upregulation. The effect of uPA on triglyceride synthesis in Huh7 cells was mediated via binding to its receptor, the uPAR. In vivo studies in uPAR(-/-) mice demonstrated that no lipid droplets were observed in their livers compared to C57BL/6 mice and the triglyceride levels were significantly lower.
This study presents a new biological function of the uPA/uPAR system in the metabolism of triglycerides and might present a new target for an early therapeutic intervention for NAFLD.
Two distinct myoglobin (mb) transcripts have been reported in common carp, Cyprinus carpio, which is a hypoxia-tolerant fish living in habitats with greatly fluctuant dissolved oxygen levels. Recombinant protein analysis has shown functional specialization of the two mb transcripts. In this work, analysis for mb-containing bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones indicated different genome loci for common carp myoglobin-1 (mb-1) and myoglobin-2 (mb-2) genes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed that mb-1 and mb-2 are located on separate chromosomes. In both of the mb-1 and mb-2 containing BAC clones, gene synteny was well conserved with the homologous region on zebrafish chromosome 1, supporting that the common carp specific mb-2 gene originated from the recent whole genome duplication event in cyprinid lineage. Transcription factor binding sites search indicated that both common carp mb genes lacked specificity Protein 1 (Sp1) and myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) binding sites, which mediated muscle-specific and calcium-dependent expression in the well-studied mb promoters. Potential hypoxia response elements (HREs) were predicted in the regulatory region of common carp mb genes. These characteristics of common carp mb gene regulatory region well interpreted the hypoxia-inducible, non-muscle expression pattern of mb-1. In the case of mb-2, a 10 bp insertion to the binding site of upstream stimulatory factor (USF), which was a co-factor of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF), might cause the non-response to hypoxia treatment of mb-2. The case of common carp mb gene duplication and subsequent differentiation in expression pattern and protein function provided an example for adaptive evolution toward aquatic hypoxia tolerance.
In rabbits and rodents, nitric oxide (NO) is generally considered to be critical for ovulation. In monovulatory species, however, the importance of NO has not been determined, nor is it clear where in the preovulatory cascade NO may act. The objectives of this study were (1) to determine if nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzymes are regulated by luteinizing hormone (LH) and (2) to determine if and where endogenous NO is critical for expression of genes essential for the ovulatory cascade in bovine granulosa cells in serum-free culture. Time- and dose-response experiments demonstrated that LH had a significant stimulatory effect on endothelial NOS (NOS3) mRNA abundance, but in a prostaglandin-dependent manner. NO production was stimulated by LH before a detectable increase in NOS3 mRNA levels was observed. Pretreatment of cells with the NOS inhibitor L-NAME blocked the effect of LH on the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like ligands epiregulin and amphiregulin, as well as prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase-2 mRNA abundance and protein levels. Similarly, EGF treatment increased mRNA encoding epiregulin, amphiregulin, and the early response gene EGR1, and this was inhibited by pretreatment with L-NAME. Interestingly, pretreatment with L-NAME had no effect on either ERK1/2 or AKT activation. Taken together, these results suggest that endogenous NOS activity is critical for the LH-induced ovulatory cascade in granulosa cells of a monotocous species and acts downstream of EGF receptor activation but upstream of the EGF-like ligands. 
CCN1 is highly expressed in cancer cells and has been identified in the secretome of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC). Although secreted CCN1 is known to promote angiogenesis, its underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we examined whether our recently-established tonsil-derived MSC (T-MSC) secrete CCN1 and, if any, how CCN1 promotes the angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Compared with untreated control T-MSC, a higher level of CCN1 was secreted by T-MSC treated with activin A and sonic hedgehog, drugs known to induce endodermal differentiation. Expectedly, conditioned medium collected from differentiated T-MSC (DCM) significantly increased HUVEC migration and tube formation compared with that from control T-MSC (CCM), and these stimulatory effects were reversed by neutralization with anti-CCN1 antibody. Treatment with recombinant human CCN1 (rh-CCN1) alone also mimicked the stimulatory effects of DCM. Furthermore, treatment with either DCM or rh-CCN1 increased the phosphorylation of AMP kinase (AMPK), and ectopic expression of siRNA of the AMPK gene inhibited all observed effects of both DCM and rh-CCN1. However, no alteration of intracellular ATP levels or phosphorylation of LKB1, a well-known upstream factor of AMPK activation, was observed under our conditions. Finally, the neutralization of integrin α(v) β(3) with anti-integrin α(v) β(3) antibody almost completely reversed the effects of CCN1 on AMPK phosphorylation, and EC migration and tube formation. Taken together, we demonstrated that T-MSC increase the secretion of CCN1 in response to endodermal differentiation and that integrin α(v) β(3) and AMPK mediate CCN1-induced EC migration and tube formation independent of intracellular ATP levels alteration.
This review presents recent basic and clinical developments in familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL).
A variety of experiments have contributed to the elucidation of this complex disease. They consist of dynamic and gene expression studies in adipocytes, confirming the role of dysfunctional adipose tissue in the pathogenesis of FCHL and identifying potential new pathways, such as complement activation. Whole exome sequencing and classical linkage studies in FCHL pedigrees, some conducted with new traits (e.g. plasma proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 [PCSK9] and phospholipid transfer protein activity), have revealed new genes of interest, among which SLC25A40 and LASS4. Finally, gene expression studies in liver biopsies and liver cell culture experiments have gained further insight in the role of upstream stimulatory factor 1, one of the most replicated genes in FCHL, in its pathogenesis.On the basis of these observations and recent phase II clinical trials, PCSK9 antagonizing is the most promising lipid-lowering therapy to be added to our current arsenal of statins and fibrates in FCHL treatment.
Ongoing basic research provides a steady growth in our knowledge on the genes that are involved in FCHL as well as their metabolic function(s). This field of research may be enhanced when data are expanded and integrated for systems biology approaches. Our growing insights in the cause of FCHL allow for better, targeted treatment of dyslipidemia and prevention of cardiovascular complications.
Goldfish pituitary cells are exposed to two GnRHs, salmon (s)GnRH and chicken (c)GnRH-II. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase C (PKC) both participate in acute sGnRH- and cGnRH-II-stimulated LH and GH release. Using goldfish pituitary cells, we examined the relationship between PI3K and PKC in acute LH and GH secretion, and PI3K involvement in chronic hormone release and total LH and GH availability. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 did not affect PKC agonists-induced LH or GH release, and PKC agonists did not alter PI3K p85 phosphorylation, suggesting PKC activation is not upstream of PI3K in acute hormone release. In 2, 6, 12 and 24h treatments, LY294002 did not affect LH release but stimulated total LH availability at 6h. sGnRH stimulatory actions on LH release and total availability at 12 and 24h, and cGnRH-II effects on these parameters at 6h were inhibited by LY294002. LY294002 enhanced basal GH release at 2 and 6h, but reduced total GH at 12 and 24h. Increased GH release was seen following 6, 12 and 24h of sGnRH, and 2, 6 and 24h of cGnRH-II treatment but total GH availability was only elevated by 24h cGnRH-II treatment. Whereas LY294002 inhibited GH release responses to sGnRH at 12h and cGnRH-II at 6h, it attenuated cGnRH-II-elicited, but not sGnRH-induced, effects on total GH. These results indicate that PI3K differentially modulates long-term basal and GnRH-stimulated hormone release, and total hormone availability, in a time-, cell-type-, and GnRH isoform-selective manner. 
We recently reported that oral administration of a (+)-vitisin A-enriched product prepared from Vitis thunbergii obviously ameliorated bone loss in ovariectomized mice and (+)-vitisin A was able to inhibit receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation in RAW264.7 cells. Here we further clarified the mechanism(s) by which (+)-vitisin A targets osteoclastic differentiation and activity. Osteoclast-characteristic enzyme activity was determined using gel zymography or spectroflurometric-based assay. Expression of signal molecules was analyzed via Western blot or immunoprecipitation. Results showed that (+)-vitisin A suppressed RANKL-induced multinuclear cells (MNCs) formation and bone resorption which was accompanied with reduction in β3 integrin, osteoclast stimulatory transmembrane protein (OC-STAMP), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and cathepsin K proteins expression. (+)-Vitisin A also down-regulated the proteolytic activities of MMP-9 and cathepsin K via targeting at the late stage function. (+)-Vitisin A prominently abrogated RANKL-triggered nuclear translocations of NF-κB, AP-1 (c-Fos/c-Jun dimer) and associated induction and nuclear accumulation of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1). The upstream IκB degradation as well as ERK and JNK phosphorylation were also substantially repressed. Transfection with siRNA targeting tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6) clearly restrained RANKL-induced MNCs formation and NFATc1 induction. Interesting, RANKL triggered poly-ubiquitination of TRAF6 and associated TRAF6-TAK1 (transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1) complex formation was prominently attenuated by (+)-vitisin A. Furthermore, the interaction between c-src tyrosine kinase (c-Src) and β3 was markedly induced by RANKL stimulation. (+)-Vitisin A significantly attenuated this interaction when concomitant treated with RANKL in RAW264.7 cells, but failed to affect c-Src/β3 complex formation when post-cultured with MNCs. Taken together, (+)-vitisin A suppressed bone resorption possibly via interruption of RANKL-induced TRAF6 ubiquitination and associated downstream signaling pathways. Furthermore, action through negative regulation of the proteolytic activity of MMP-9 and cathepsin K might also contribute to the anti-resorption effect of (+)-vitisin A. 
3,6'-Disinapoyl sucrose (DISS) is an oligosaccharide ester natural product originating from the root of wild Polygala tenuifolia. Our previous reports suggested that DISS can have neuroprotective effects and antidepressive activity in rats, at least in part, by increased expression of cyclic AMP response element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB) and its downstream target protein, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The aim of the present study was to explore the mechanism of DISS-modulated BDNF and CREB expression. In this study, we confirmed its neuroprotective effect by showing that DISS, at concentrations above 30 μM, could promote the neuron cell viability and protected the glutamate and H2O2-induced toxicity in the human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cell line. DISS treatment also increased acute (from 15 to 30 min) BDNF expression and CREB phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner. Pharmacological inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (ERK1/2), CaMKII, and Trk (with U0126, KN93, or K252a, respectively) partially attenuated the stimulatory effect of DISS on phospho-CREB and BDNF expression; however, it was not inhibited by pharmacological inhibition of PKA or PI3K (with H89 and LY294002, respectively). The results are consistent with the effects of DISS on CRE-directed gene transcription, as U0126 and KN-93 treatment also blocked the DISS-induced expression of the CRE-luciferase reporter gene. The results from the present study suggest that DISS-mediated regulation of BDNF gene expression is associated with CREB-mediated transcription of BDNF and upstream activation of ERK1/2 and CaMKII. Finally, DISS may exert neuroprotective and antidepressant effects through these signaling pathways in neuronal cells.
Bone cells respond to the integrated effects of local and systemic regulation. Here we show that hypoxia and the stress hormones PGE2 and glucocorticoid interact in complex ways in osteoblasts, converging on insulin like growth factor I (IGF-I) expression. Whereas hypoxia alone rapidly increased transcription factor HIF activity, it suppressed DNA synthesis, had no significant effects on protein synthesis or alkaline phosphatase activity, and drove discrete changes in a panel of osteoblast mRNAs. Notably, hypoxia increased expression of the acute phase response transcription factor C/EBPδ which can induce IGF-I in response to PGE2, but conversely prevented the stimulatory effect of PGE2 on IGF-I mRNA. However, unlike its effect on C/EBPδ, hypoxia suppressed expression of the obligate osteoblast transcription factor Runx2, which can activate an upstream response element in the IGF-I gene promoter. Hypoxic inhibition of IGF-I and Runx2 were enforced by glucocorticoid, and continued with prolonged exposure. Our studies thus reveal that IGF-I expression is stratified by two critical transcriptional elements in osteoblasts, which are resolved by the individual and combined effects of hypoxic stress and stress hormones. In so doing, hypoxia suppresses Runx2, limits the enhancing influence of PGE2, and interacts with glucocorticoid to reduce IGF-I expression by osteoblasts. 
In the mammary gland, local recruitment and action of macrophages is a key immunological defence mechanism against infection. Macrophages are members of the innate immune system, serve as the first line of the defence against invading pathogens and are critical effectors and regulators of inflammation. We have examined the early phase response of bovine macrophages to infection with live Staphylococcus aureus. Genome-wide transcript profiling of blood monocyte-derived macrophages from six Norwegian Red heifers infected with live S. aureus for 2 and 6 hours in vitro was performed.
About 420 of the 17 000 genes on the ARK-Genomics bovine cDNA array were differentially regulated at 6 hours post infection. Approximately 70% of the responding genes had a known identity (Entrez Gene ID) and were used in the identification of overrepresented pathways and biological functions in the dataset.Analysis of a subset of differentially regulated genes (List eQG) obtained by comparison with data from genome-wide association mapping in Norwegian Red cattle identified anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 4 and interleukin 13 as putative expression quantitative trait loci, suggesting that S. aureus infection triggers alternative activation of macrophages. Moreover, several classical activation pathways were found, mainly cellular immune response and cytokine signaling pathways, i.e. triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM1) and nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain-like receptor (NLR) pathways. Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 5 (CD40 ligand) was identified as an upstream regulator which points toward CD40 likely acting as a co-stimulatory receptor during Toll-like receptor 2(TLR2)-mediated inflammatory response of bovine macrophages to S. aureus infection. Furthermore, peptidoglycan was identified as an upstream regulator in the List eQG, which indicates that this bacterial cell-wall component might be pivotal in macrophage intracellular bacterial recognition during early inflammation.
Here we have shown that in vitro infection of bovine macrophages with live S. aureus induced both alternative and classical activation pathways. Alternative activation of macrophages may be a mechanism contributing to intracellular persistence of S. aureus in the course of inflammation such as during mastitis in dairy cattle.
Although structurally and biochemically similar to the cellular prion (PrP(C)), doppel (Dpl) is unique in its biological functions. There are no reports about any neurodegenerative diseases induced by Dpl. However the artificial expression of Dpl in the PrP-deficient mouse brain causes ataxia with Purkinje cell death. Abundant Dpl proteins have been found in testis and depletion of the Dpl gene (Prnd) causes male infertility. Therefore, we hypothesize different regulations of Prnd in the nerve and male productive systems. In this study, by electrophoretic mobility shift assays we have determined that two different sets of transcription factors are involved in regulation of the Prnd promoter in mouse neuronal N2a and GC-1 spermatogenic (spg) cells, i.e., upstream stimulatory factors (USF) in both cells, Brn-3 and Sp1 in GC-1 spg cells, and Sp3 in N2a cells, leading to the expression of Dpl in GC-1 spg but not in N2a cells. We have further defined that, in N2a cells, Dpl induces oxidative stress and apoptosis, which stimulate ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-modulating bindings of transcription factors, p53 and p21, to Prnp promoter, resulting the PrP(C) elevation for counteraction of the Dpl cytotoxicity; in contrast, in GC-1 spg cells, phosphorylation of p21 and N-terminal truncated PrP may play roles in the control of Dpl-induced apoptosis, which may benefit the physiological function of Dpl in the male reproduction system. 
The renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in the regulation of blood pressure via angiotensin II and the angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R). Human AT1R gene promoter has four SNPs: T/A at -777, T/G at -680, A/C at -214, and A/G at -119, that are in linkage disequilibrium. Variants -777T, -680T, -214A, and -119A almost always occur together (named haplotype I), and variants -777A, -680G, -214C, and -119G almost always occur together (named haplotype II) in Caucasian subjects. Genomic DNA analyses, from 388 normotensive and 374 hypertensive subjects, link haplotype I of the human AT1R (hAT1R) gene with hypertension in Caucasians (p = 0.004, χ(2) = 8.46). Our results show increased basal promoter activity of the hAT1R gene in cells (H295R and A7r5) transfected with reporter construct containing haplotype I. We also show increased binding of the transcription factor, USF2, to oligonucleotide containing nucleoside -214A as opposed to -214C. Recombineering of a 166-kb bacterial artificial chromosome containing 68 kb of the 5'-flanking region, 45 kb of the coding sequence, and 53 kb of the 3'-flanking region of the hAT1R gene was employed to generate transgenic mice with either haplotype. We show that (a) hAT1R mRNA level is increased in the kidney and heart of transgenic mice containing haplotype I as compared with haplotype II; (b) USF2 binds more strongly to the chromatin obtained from the kidney of transgenic mice containing haplotype I as compared with haplotype II; and (c) blood pressure and oxidative stress are increased in transgenic mice containing haplotype I as compared with haplotype II. 
Clock is a key transcription factor that positively controls circadian regulation. However, its role in plasma cholesterol homeostasis and atherosclerosis has not been studied.
We show for the first time that dominant-negative Clock mutant protein (Clock(Δ19/Δ19)) enhances plasma cholesterol and atherosclerosis in 3 different mouse models. Detailed analyses revealed that Clk(Δ19/Δ19)Apoe(-/-) mice display hypercholesterolemia resulting from the accumulation of apolipoprotein B48-containing cholesteryl ester-rich lipoproteins. Physiological studies showed that enhanced cholesterol absorption by the intestine contributes to hypercholesterolemia. Molecular studies indicated that the expression of Niemann Pick C1 Like 1, Acyl-CoA:Cholesterol acyltransferase 1, and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein in the intestines of Clk(Δ19/Δ19)Apoe(-/-) mice was high and that enterocytes assembled and secreted more chylomicrons. Furthermore, we identified macrophage dysfunction as another potential cause of increased atherosclerosis in Clk(Δ19/Δ19)Apoe(-/-) mice. Macrophages from Clk(Δ19/Δ19)Apoe(-/-) mice expressed higher levels of scavenger receptors and took up more modified lipoproteins compared with Apoe(-/-) mice, but they expressed low levels of ATP binding casette protein family A member 1 and were defective in cholesterol efflux. Molecular studies revealed that Clock regulates ATP binding casette protein family A member 1 expression in macrophages by modulating upstream transcription factor 2 expression.
Clock(Δ19/Δ19) protein enhances atherosclerosis by increasing intestinal cholesterol absorption, augmenting uptake of modified lipoproteins by macrophages, and reducing cholesterol efflux from macrophages. These studies establish that circadian Clock activity is crucial in maintaining low plasma cholesterol levels and in reducing atherogenesis in mice.
Cytosolic manganese superoxide dismutase (cMnSOD) is an important antioxidant enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of superoxides to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide in several organisms. In the Pacific white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei, three cMnSOD genes (LvcMnSOD1-3) have previously been characterized. Here, the genomic structure of LvcMnSOD2 and its mRNA expression in response to thermal stress was examined. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence demonstrated that LvcMnSOD2 is comprised of 2392 bp spanning from the ATG translation start site to the stop codon and contains six exons interrupted by five introns. The 5' region upstream of the LvcMnSOD2 gene contains several putative regulatory elements but lacks the accepted TATA sequence. The putative transcription factor binding elements that may be involved in LvcMnSOD2 mRNA expression level include activator protein-1 (AP-1), cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), upstream stimulatory factor (USF), CAAT-enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and heat shock regulatory element (HSE). In addition, we compared the 5' upstream sequences of the LvcMnSOD2 gene between two shrimp strains that are resistant or susceptible to Taura syndrome virus (TSV), respectively, which revealed the absence of the USF and C/EBP elements at positions -2125 and -1986, respectively, in the TSV-susceptible shrimp line. Moreover, genomic variations between the two shrimp strains were detected in some of the putative C/EBP, USF, HSE and NF-κB transcription factor binding elements. That these genomic variations might be involved in the TSV resistance as well as in stress responses remains to be evaluated. The presence of 15 putative HSEs suggests that the expression of LvcMnSOD2 is regulated under thermal stress. Here, we found that in response to a 1 or 3 h thermal stress (35 °C), the mRNA expression levels of LvcMnSOD2 were significantly increased and then gradually decreased in the recovering phase at room temperature (25 °C) to control levels by 3 h after the heat shock. Thus, the antioxidant system may be induced to protect cells from the oxidative damage caused by thermal stress. The genomic organization of LvcMnSOD2 likely provides a clue to the mechanisms that might regulate the antioxidant defense pathway in shrimps and so potentially in marine invertebrates.
The HIF1- and HIF2-mediated transcriptional responses play critical roles in solid tumor progression. Despite significant similarities, including their binding to promoters of both HIF1 and HIF2 target genes, HIF1 and HIF2 proteins activate unique subsets of target genes under hypoxia. The mechanism for HIF target gene specificity has remained unclear. Using siRNA or inhibitor, we previously reported that STAT3 or USF2 is specifically required for activation of endogenous HIF1 or HIF2 target genes. In this study, using reporter gene assays and chromatin immuno-precipitation, we find that STAT3 or USF2 exhibits specific binding to the promoters of HIF1 or HIF2 target genes respectively even when over-expressed. Functionally, HIF1α interacts with STAT3 to activate HIF1 target gene promoters in a HIF1α HLH/PAS and N-TAD dependent manner while HIF2α interacts with USF2 to activate HIF2 target gene promoters in a HIF2α N-TAD dependent manner. Physically, HIF1α HLH and PAS domains are required for its interaction with STAT3 while both N- and C-TADs of HIF2α are involved in physical interaction with USF2. Importantly, addition of functional USF2 binding sites into a HIF1 target gene promoter increases the basal activity of the promoter as well as its response to HIF2+USF2 activation while replacing HIF binding site with HBS from a HIF2 target gene does not change the specificity of the reporter gene. Importantly, RNA Pol II on HIF1 or HIF2 target genes is primarily associated with HIF1α or HIF2α in a STAT3 or USF2 dependent manner. Thus, we demonstrate here for the first time that HIF target gene specificity is achieved by HIF transcription partners that are required for HIF target gene activation, exhibit specific binding to the promoters of HIF1 or HIF2 target genes and selectively interact with HIF1α or HIF2α protein. 
Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are transcriptional regulators that mediate the cellular response to low oxygen. Although HIF-1 is usually considered as the principal mediator of hypoxic adaptation, several tissues and different cell types express both HIF-1 and HIF-2 isoforms under hypoxia or when treated with hypoxia mimetic chemicals such as cobalt. However, the similarities or differences between HIF-1 and HIF-2, in terms of their tissue- and inducer-specific activation and function, are not adequately characterized. To address this issue, we investigated the effects of true hypoxia and hypoxia mimetics on HIF-1 and HIF-2 induction and specific gene transcriptional activity in two hepatic cancer cell lines, Huh7 and HepG2. Both hypoxia and cobalt caused rapid induction of both HIF-1α and HIF-2α proteins. Hypoxia induced erythropoietin (EPO) expression and secretion in a HIF-2-dependent way. Surprisingly, however, EPO expression was not induced when cells were treated with cobalt. In agreement, both HIF-1- and HIF-2-dependent promoters (of PGK and SOD2 genes, respectively) were activated by hypoxia while cobalt only activated the HIF-1-dependent PGK promoter. Unlike cobalt, other hypoxia mimetics such as DFO and DMOG activated both types of promoters. Furthermore, cobalt impaired the hypoxic stimulation of HIF-2, but not HIF-1, activity and cobalt-induced HIF-2α interacted poorly with USF-2, a HIF-2-specific co-activator. These data show that, despite similar induction of HIF-1α and HIF-2α protein expression, HIF-1 and HIF-2 specific gene activating functions respond differently to different stimuli and suggest the operation of oxygen-independent and gene- or tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms involving additional transcription factors or co-activators. 
A majority of mammalian promoters are associated with CpG islands. CpG island promoters frequently lack common core promoter elements, such as the TATA box, and often have dispersed transcription start sites. The mechanism through which CpG island promoters are transcriptionally initiated remains unclear. We speculate that some transcription factors can direct transcription initiation by themselves. To test this hypothesis, we screened a variety of transcription factors to see whether they could initiate transcription. Most transcription factors, including specificity protein 1 (Sp1) and nuclear factor Y (NF-Y), showed little transcriptional initiation activity. However, nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1), the basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper (bHLH/ZIP) family of proteins and the E-twenty six (Ets) family of proteins had strong transcriptional activity. We further demonstrated that these transcription factors initiate dispersed transcription. Our studies provide perspectives to the mechanism of transcription initiation from CpG island promoters.
The interaction of B7 family members with appropriate receptors is essential for an effective T cell response. CD80 and CD86 are the principal co-stimulatory molecules of this family and they are mainly expressed on professional antigen presenting cells (APCs), but also on several non-lymphoid cells. CD86 is constitutively expressed in keratinocytes from the spinous layer of normal cervical epithelium. However, the mechanisms that control the expression of this gene in epithelial cells remain unknown. We analyzed the DNA methylation status of the CD86 promoter and a CpG island located in the upstream intergenic region in keratinocyte-derived cell lines. In those cell lines where CD86 is expressed, a high degree of methylation in the CpG island was observed. However, a CpG dinucleotide within the cAMP response element (CRE) in the promoter region was consistently unmethylated and associated to the transcription factor CREB, as demonstrated by ChIP assays. The opposite methylation pattern was observed in cell lines where CD86 is not expressed, affecting also the binding of CREB. The analysis of the DNA methylation pattern of this gene in cells from the spinous and basal layers of normal cervical epithelium showed a similar profile to that observed in cell lines with and without expression of CD86 respectively. Our results indicate that the methylation pattern in the CD86 promoter and CpG island is closely related to the expression of this co-stimulatory molecule in keratinocytes. 
Migration and invasion enhancer 1 (MIEN1) is a novel gene involved in prostate cancer progression by enhancing prostate cancer cell migration and invasion. DNA methylation, an important epigenetic regulation, is one of the most widely altered mechanisms in prostate cancer. This phenomenon frames the basis to study the DNA methylation patterns in the promoter region of MIEN1. Bisulfite pyrosequencing demonstrates the MIEN1 promoter contains a short interspersed nuclear Alu element (SINE Alu) repeat sequence. Validation of methylation inhibition on MIEN1 was performed using nucleoside analogs and non-nucleoside inhibitors and resulted in an increase in both MIEN1 RNA and protein in normal cells. MIEN1 mRNA and protein increases upon inhibition of individual DNA methyltransferases using RNA interference technologies. Furthermore, dual luciferase reporter assays, in silico analysis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays identified a sequence upstream of the transcription start site that has a site for binding of the USF transcription factors. These results suggest the MIEN1 promoter has a SINE Alu region that is hypermethylated in normal cells leading to repression of the gene. In cancer, the hypomethylation of a part of this repeat, in addition to the binding of USF, results in MIEN1 expression.
Previous work in our laboratory demonstrated that in-utero exposure to a mixture of the phytoestrogen Genistein (GEN), and plasticizer DEHP, induces short- and long-term alterations in testicular gene and protein expression different from individual exposures. These studies identified fetal and adult Leydig cells as sensitive targets for low dose endocrine disruptor (ED) mixtures. To further investigate the direct effects and mechanisms of toxicity of GEN and DEHP, MA-10 mouse tumor Leydig cells were exposed in-vitro to varying concentrations of GEN and MEHP, the principal bioactive metabolite of DEHP. Combined 10μM GEN+10μM MEHP had a stimulatory effect on basal progesterone production. Consistent with increased androgenicity, the mRNA of steroidogenic and cholesterol mediators Star, Cyp11a, Srb1 and Hsl, as well as upstream orphan nuclear receptors Nr2f2 and Sf1 were all significantly increased uniquely in the mixture treatment group. Insl3, a sensitive marker of Leydig endocrine disruption and cell function, was significantly decreased by combined GEN+MEHP. Lipid analysis by high-performance thin layer chromatography demonstrated the ability of combined 10μM combined GEN+MEHP, but not individual exposures, to increase levels of several neutral lipids and phospholipid classes, indicating a generalized deregulation of lipid homeostasis. Further investigation by qPCR analysis revealed a concomitant increase in cholesterol (Hmgcoa) and phospholipid (Srebp1c, Fasn) mediator mRNAs, suggesting the possible involvement of upstream LXRα agonism. These results suggest a deregulation of MA-10 Leydig function in response to a combination of GEN+MEHP. We propose a working model for GEN+MEHP doses relevant to human exposure involving LXR agonism and activation of other transcription factors. Taken more broadly, this research highlights the importance of assessing the impact of ED mixtures in multiple toxicological models across a range of environmentally relevant doses.
During eukaryotic translation initiation, the 43S preinitiation complex (43S PIC), consisting of the 40S ribosomal subunit, eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) and initiator tRNA scans mRNA to find an appropriate start codon. Key roles in the accuracy of initiation codon selection belong to eIF1 and eIF1A, whereas the mammalian-specific DHX29 helicase substantially contributes to ribosomal scanning of structured mRNAs. Here, we show that DHX29 stimulates the recognition of the AUG codon but not the near-cognate CUG codon regardless of its nucleotide context during ribosomal scanning. The stimulatory effect depends on the contact between DHX29 and eIF1A. The unique DHX29 N-terminal domain binds to the ribosomal site near the mRNA entrance, where it contacts the eIF1A OB domain. UV crosslinking assays revealed that DHX29 may rearrange eIF1A and eIF2α in key nucleotide context positions of ribosomal complexes. Interestingly, DHX29 impedes the 48S initiation complex formation in the absence of eIF1A perhaps due to forming a physical barrier that prevents the 43S PIC from loading onto mRNA. Mutational analysis allowed us to split the mRNA unwinding and codon selection activities of DHX29. Thus, DHX29 is another example of an initiation factor contributing to start codon selection.
Although hepatocellular carcinoma cells can sometimes undergo differentiation in an embryonic microenvironment, the mechanism is poorly understood.
The developmental stage-specific embryonic induction of tumor cell differentiation was investigated.
Both chick and mouse liver extracts and hepatoblast-enriched cells at different developmental stages were used to treat human hepatoma HepG2 cells, and the effects on the induction of differentiation were evaluated. The nuclear factors controlling differentiation, hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4α, HNF-1α, HNF-6 and upstream stimulatory factor-1 (USF-1), and the oncogene Myc and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) were measured. HNF-4α RNA interference was used to verify the role of HNF-4α. Embryonic induction effects were further tested in vivo by injecting HepG2 tumor cells into immunodeficient nude mice.
The 9-11-days chick liver extracts and 13.5-14.5-days mouse hepatoblast-enriched cells could inhibit proliferation and induce differentiation of HepG2 cells, leading to either death or maturation to hepatocytes. The maturation of surviving HepG2 cells was confirmed by increases in the expressions of HNF-4α, HNF-1α, HNF-6, and USF-1, and decreases in Myc and AFP. The embryonic induction of HepG2 cell maturation could be attenuated by HNF-4α RNA interference. Furthermore, the 13.5-days mouse hepatoblast culture completely eliminated HepG2 tumors with inhibited Myc and induced HNF-4α, confirming this embryonic induction effect in vivo.
This study demonstrated that developmental stage-specific embryonic induction of HepG2 cell differentiation might help in understanding embryonic differentiation and oncogenesis.
The sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) mediates the uptake of I(-) by the thyroid follicular cell and is essential for thyroid hormone biosynthesis. Nis expression is stimulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and also requires paired box 8 (Pax8) to bind to its promoter. Pax8 binding activity depends on its redox state by a mechanism involving thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase-1 (Txn/TxnRd1) reduction of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (Ape1). In this study, we investigate the role of Se in Nis expression.
Selenium increases TSH-induced Nis expression and activity in rat thyroid cells. The stimulatory effect of Se occurs at the transcriptional level and is only observed for Nis promoters containing a Pax8 binding site in the Nis upstream enhancer, suggesting that Pax8 is involved in this effect. In fact, Se increases Pax8 expression and its DNA-binding capacity, and in Pax8-silenced rat thyroid cells, Nis is not Se responsive. By inhibiting Ape1 and TxnRd1 functions, we found that both enzymes are crucial for TSH and TSH plus Se stimulation of Pax8 activity and mediate the Nis response to Se treatment.
We describe that Se increases Nis expression and activity. We demonstrate that this effect is dependent on the redox functions of Ape1 and Txn/TxnRd1 through control of the DNA binding activity of Pax8.
Nis expression is controlled by Txn/Ape1 through a TSH/Se-dependent mechanism. These findings open a new field of study regarding the regulation of Nis activity in thyroid cells. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 24, 855-866.
Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). About 20%-30% of people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes develop DN. DN is characterized by both glomerulosclerosis with thickening of the glomerular basement membrane and mesangial matrix expansion, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Hyperglycemia and the activation of the intra-renal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in diabetes have been suggested to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of DN. However, the mechanisms are not well known. Studies from our laboratory demonstrated that the transcription factor-upstream stimulatory factor 2 (USF2) is an important regulator of DN. Moreover, the renin gene is a downstream target of USF2. Importantly, USF2 transgenic (Tg) mice demonstrate a specific increase in renal renin expression and angiotensin II (AngII) levels in kidney and exhibit increased urinary albumin excretion and extracellular matrix deposition in glomeruli, supporting a role for USF2 in the development of diabetic nephropathy. In this review, we summarize our findings of the mechanisms by which diabetes regulates USF2 in kidney cells and its role in regulation of renal renin-angiotensin system and the development of diabetic nephropathy.
Xenobiotic estrogens, such as bisphenol A (BPA), disrupt a wide variety of genomic estrogen actions, but their nongenomic estrogen actions remain poorly understood. We investigated nongenomic estrogenic effects of low concentrations of BPA and three related alkylphenols on the inhibition of zebrafish oocye maturation (OM) mediated through a G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (Gper)-dependent epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr) pathway. BPA (10-100 nM) treatment for 3 h mimicked the effects of estradiol-17beta (E2) and EGF, decreasing spontaneous maturation of defolliculated zebrafish oocytes, an effect not blocked by coincubation with actinomycin D, but blocked by coincubation with a Gper antibody. BPA displayed relatively high binding affinity (15.8% that of E2) for recombinant zebrafish Gper. The inhibitory effects of BPA were attenuated by inhibition of upstream regulators of Egfr, intracellular tyrosine kinase (Src) with PP2, and matrix metalloproteinase with ilomastat. Treatment with an inhibitor of Egfr transactivation, AG1478, and an inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 3/1 pathway, U0126, increased spontaneous OM and blocked the inhibitory effects of BPA, E2, and the selective GPER agonist, G-1. Western blot analysis showed that BPA (10-200 nM) mimicked the stimulatory effects of E2 and EGF on Mapk3/1 phosphorylation. Tetrabromobisphenol A, 4-nonylphenol, and tetrachlorobisphenol A (5-100 nM) also inhibited OM, an effect blocked by cotreatment with AG1478, as well as with the GPER antagonist, G-15, and displayed similar binding affinities as BPA to zebrafish Gper. The results suggest that BPA and related alkylphenols disrupt zebrafish OM by a novel nongenomic estrogenic mechanism involving activation of the Gper/Egfr/Mapk3/1 pathway. 
Fatty acid and fat synthesis in the liver is a highly regulated metabolic pathway that is important for very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) production and thus energy distribution to other tissues. Having common features at their promoter regions, lipogenic genes are coordinately regulated at the transcriptional level. Transcription factors, such as upstream stimulatory factors (USFs), sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1C (SREBP1C), liver X receptors (LXRs) and carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP) have crucial roles in this process. Recently, insights have been gained into the signalling pathways that regulate these transcription factors. After feeding, high blood glucose and insulin levels activate lipogenic genes through several pathways, including the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) and AKT-mTOR pathways. These pathways control the post-translational modifications of transcription factors and co-regulators, such as phosphorylation, acetylation or ubiquitylation, that affect their function, stability and/or localization. Dysregulation of lipogenesis can contribute to hepatosteatosis, which is associated with obesity and insulin resistance. 
ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type I motif, 1 (ADAMTS1) that has both antiangiogenic and aggrecanase activity was dysregulated in many pathophysiologic circumstances. However, there is limited information available on the transcriptional regulation of ADAMTS1 gene. Therefore, this study mainly aimed to identify regulatory regions important for the regulation of ADAMTS1 gene under normoxic and hypoxic conditions in human hepatoma cells (HEP3B). Cultured HEP3B cells were exposed to normal oxygen condition, and Cobalt chloride (CoCl2) induced the hypoxic condition, which is an HIF-1 inducer. The cocl2-induced hypoxic condition led to the induced ADAMTS1 mRNA and protein expression in Hepatoma cells. Differential regulation of SP1 and USF transcription factors on ADAMTS1 gene expression was determined by transcriptional activity, mRNA and protein level of ADAMTS1 gene. Ectopic expression of SP1 and USF transcription factors resulted in the decrease in ADAMTS1 transcriptional activity of all promoter constructs consistent with mRNA and protein level in normoxic condition. However, overexpression of SP1 and USF led to the increase of ADAMTS1 gene expressions at mRNA and protein level in hypoxic condition. On the other hand, C/EBPα transcription factor didn't show any statistically significant effect on ADAMTS1 gene expression at mRNA, protein and transcriptional level under normoxic and hypoxic condition.
Within two years of their discovery in 1977, introns were found to have a positive effect on gene expression. Numerous examples of stimulatory introns have been described since then in very diverse organisms, including plants. In some cases, the mechanism through which the intron affects expression is readily understood. However, many introns that affect expression increase mRNA accumulation through an unknown mechanism, referred to as intron-mediated enhancement (IME). Despite several decades of research into IME, and the clear benefits of using introns to increase transgene expression, little progress has been made in understanding the mechanism of IME. Several fundamental questions regarding the role of transcription and splicing, the sequences responsible for IME, the involvement of other factors, and the relationship between introns and promoters remain unanswered. The more we learn about the properties of stimulating introns, the clearer it becomes that the effects of introns are unfamiliar and difficult to reconcile with conventional views of how transcription is controlled. We hypothesize that introns increase transcript initiation upstream of themselves by creating a localized region of accessible chromatin. Introns might represent a novel kind of downstream regulatory element for genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II. 
Chromosome 17q21, harboring the orosomucoid 1-like 3 (ORMDL3) gene, has been consistently associated with childhood asthma in genome-wide association studies.
We investigated genetic variants in and around ORMDL3 that can change the function of ORMDL3 and thus contribute to asthma susceptibility.
We performed haplotype analyses and fine mapping of the ORMDL3 locus in a cross-sectional (International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood Phase II, n = 3557 total subjects, n = 281 asthmatic patients) and case-control (Multicenter Asthma Genetics in Childhood Study/International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood Phase II, n = 1446 total subjects, n = 763 asthmatic patients) data set to identify putative causal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the locus. Top asthma-associated polymorphisms were analyzed for allele-specific effects on transcription factor binding and promoter activity in vitro and gene expression in PBMCs after stimulation ex vivo.
Two haplotypes (H1 and H2) were significantly associated with asthma in the cross-sectional (P = 9.9 × 10(-5) and P = .0035, respectively) and case-control (P = 3.15 × 10(-8) and P = .0021, respectively) populations. Polymorphisms rs8076131 and rs4065275 were identified to drive these effects. For rs4065275, a quantitative difference in transcription factor binding was found, whereas for rs8076131, changes in upstream stimulatory factor 1 and 2 transcription factor binding were observed in vitro by using different cell lines and PBMCs. This might contribute to detected alterations in luciferase activity paralleled with changes in ORMDL3 gene expression and IL-4 and IL-13 cytokine levels ex vivo in response to innate and adaptive stimuli in an allele-specific manner. Both SNPs were in strong linkage disequilibrium with asthma-associated 17q21 SNPs previously related to altered ORMDL3 gene expression.
Polymorphisms in a putative promoter region of ORMDL3, which are associated with childhood asthma, alter transcriptional regulation of ORMDL3, correlate with changes in TH2 cytokines levels, and therefore might contribute to the childhood asthma susceptibility signal from 17q21.
Alcohol abuse and adherence to atherogenic diet (AD; a low-carbohydrate-high-protein diet) have been positively associated with cardiovascular disease. In addition, it has been demonstrated clinically that dietary intake is increased on days when alcohol is consumed. Here, the additive effects of ethanol (EtOH) and AD on atherosclerosis, a major underlying cause of cardiovascular disease, were investigated in apolipoprotein E/low-density lipoprotein receptor double-knockout (KO) mice. The mechanisms, especially aortic oxidative stress damage, were highlighted.
Twelve-week-old male KO mice on AD with or without EtOH treatment were bred for 4 months. Age-matched male C57BL/6J mice on a standard chow diet without EtOH treatment served as controls. Analyses were conducted using ultrasound biomicroscopy, histopathological and fluorescence immunohistochemical examinations, Western blots, and polymerase chain reaction.
KO mice on AD with EtOH treatment showed increases in aortic maximum intima media thickness, hypoechoic plaque formation, and mean Oil-Red-O content. These results were associated with enhanced ratio of aortic 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG)-immunopositive area to the metallothionein (MT) immunopositive area and suppression of AD-induced up-regulated aortic Mt1, Mt2, and upstream stimulatory factor 1 mRNA expressions. Moreover, 8-OHdG was expressed in the nuclei of CD31- and alpha smooth muscle actin-immunopositive cells, and the up-regulated mRNA expressions of aortic nitric oxide synthase 3 and platelet-derived growth factors were only observed in the KO mice on AD with EtOH treatment.
Alcohol abuse and adherence to AD may promote the shift of aortic oxidative stress and antioxidative stress balance toward oxidative stress predominance and reduced antioxidative stress, which may be partly due to the decrease in MT at the cell biological level and down-regulation of Mt at the gene level, which in turn could play a role in the up-regulation of endothelial dysfunction-related and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation-related gene expression and the progression of atherosclerosis in mice with hyperlipidemia.
Smurf1 (Smad ubiquitylation regulatory factor 1) and Smurf2 are negative regulators of the TGF-β (transforming growth factor-β) pathway. The protein stability and ubiquitin E3 activity regulation of Smurfs have been well studied. However, the mechanism of Smurfs expression at the transcriptional level remains uncharacterized. Here, we reported that USF2 (upstream stimulatory factor 2), a basic helix-loop-helix-leucine-zip transcription factor, is necessary for the transcriptional activity of Smurf1 and Smurf2. The 5'-flanking sequences of the Smurfs gene have more than one E-box motifs, and USF2 bounds the Smurfs promoter in vitro and in vivo. Over-expression USF2 inhibited the transcriptional activity of the Smurfs, and Smurfs mRNA was markedly decreased. Therefore, the activity of TGF-β was distinctly enhanced. Furthermore, in human breast cancers, USF2 was abnormally high expressed and correlated with cancer progression. USF2 was specifically inversely correlated with Smurfs in Luminal A subtype breast cancer patients. These findings suggest the mechanism regulation of Smurfs transcriptional activity, and shed new light on the cancer-promoting role of USF2.
WW domain binding protein 2 (WBP2), a transcriptional coactivator, plays a vital role in breast tumorigenesis. It positively regulates estrogen receptor, Hippo, and Wnt pathways, which subsequently enhance the transcription of downstream target genes contributing to cancer. Understanding the regulation of the expression and activity of WBP2 oncoprotein has implication in cancer therapy. We have previously reported that WBP2 is regulated at the post-translational and post-transcriptional levels. However, its regulation at the transcriptional level is not known. In this study, the minimal promoter region of WBP2 that is critical for its transcription was identified. The E-box motif in the WBP2 promoter was demonstrated to be essential for its transcription. The E-box binding protein upstream stimulatory factor 1 (USF-1) was discovered to be a key transcription factor for WBP2 by yeast one-hybrid analysis and was validated through reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and tandem mass spectrometry, which also suggested that USF-1 acts by regulating a network of genes, in addition to WBP2, associated with cell movement, proliferation, cell-cycle, and survival cellular processes. USF-1 is overexpressed in majority of the breast cancer cell lines and tissues tested, and has profound effects on cancer cell proliferation. USF-1-mediated transcription of WBP2 was demonstrated to be inducible by insulin, which led to AKT-mediated phosphorylation of USF-1 that modulated its ability to bind to the WBP2 promoter and activate its transcription. This study sheds new light onto the regulation of the WBP2 oncogene at the transcriptional level by a novel oncogenic transcription factor, USF-1. USF-1 is a potential drug target for treatment of WBP2-positive breast cancer.-Ramos, A., Miow, Q. H., Liang, X., Lin, Q. S., Putti, T. C., Lim, Y. P. Phosphorylation of E-box binding USF-1 by PI3K/AKT enhances its transcriptional activation of the WBP2 oncogene in breast cancer cells.
We have previously shown that decidualization of human endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) causes a genome-wide increase in the levels of acetylation of histone-H3 Lys-27 (H3K27ac). We also reported that the distal gene regions, more than 3 kb up- or downstream of gene transcription start sites have increased H3K27ac levels. Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) is a specific decidualization marker and has increased H3K27ac levels in its distal upstream region (-4701 to -7501 bp). Here, using a luciferase reporter gene construct containing this IGFBP-1 upstream region, we tested the hypothesis that it is an IGFBP-1 enhancer. To induce decidualization, we incubated ESCs with cAMP and found that cAMP increased luciferase expression, indicating that decidualization increased the transcriptional activity from the IGFBP-1 upstream region. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of this region in HepG2 cells significantly reduced IGFBP-1 expression, confirming its role as an IGFBP-1 enhancer. A ChIP assay revealed that cAMP increased the recruitment of the transcriptional regulators CCAAT enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ), forkhead box O1 (FOXO1), and p300 to the IGFBP-1 enhancer in ESCs. Of note, C/EBPβ knockdown inhibited the stimulatory effects of cAMP on the levels of H3K27ac, chromatin opening, and p300 recruitment at the IGFBP-1 enhancer. These results indicate that the region -4701 to -7501 bp upstream of IGFBP-1 functions as an enhancer for IGFBP-1 expression in ESCs undergoing decidualization, that C/EBPβ and FOXO1 bind to the enhancer region to up-regulate IGFBP-1 expression, and that C/EBPβ induces H3K27ac by recruiting p300 to the IGFBP-1 enhancer.
The aim of the present study was to examine the role of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and its phosphorylation in the regulation of ovarian cell proliferation and apoptosis, and of the response of proliferation and apoptosis to the upstream hormonal stimulators FSH and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) 1. In the first series of experiments, porcine ovarian granulosa cells, transfected or not with a gene construct encoding wild-type CREB1 (CREB1WT), were cultured with and without FSH (0, 1, 10 or 100ngmL-1). In the second series of experiments, these cells were transfected or not with CREB1WT or non-phosphorylatable mutant CREB1 (CREB1M1) and cultured with and without FSH (0, 1, 10 or 100ngmL-1) or IGF1 (0, 1, 10 and 100ngmL-1). Levels of total and phosphorylated (p-) CREB1, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a marker of proliferation, and BAX, a marker of apoptosis, were evaluated by western immunoblotting and immunocytochemical analysis. Transfection of cells with CREB1WT promoted accumulation of total CREB1 within cells, but p-CREB1 was not detected in any cell group. Both CREB1WT and CREB1M1 reduced cell proliferation and apoptosis. Addition of 10 and 100ngmL-1 FSH to non-transfected cells promoted CREB1 accumulation and apoptosis, whereas cell proliferation was promoted by all concentrations of FSH tested. FSH activity was not modified in cells transfected with either CREB1WT or CREB1M1. IGF1 at 100ngmL-1 promoted cell proliferation, whereas all concentrations of IGF1 tested reduced apoptosis. Transfection with either CREB1WT or CREB1M1 did not modify the effects of either FSH or IGF1, although CREB1M1 reversed the effect of IGF1 on apoptosis from inhibitory to stimulatory. These observations suggest that CREB1 is involved in the downregulation of porcine ovarian cell proliferation and apoptosis. The absence of visible CREB1 phosphorylation and the similarity between the effects of CREB1WT and CREB1M1 transfection indicate that phosphorylation is not necessary for CREB1 action on these processes. Furthermore, the observations suggest that FSH promotes both ovarian cell proliferation and apoptosis, whereas IGF1 has proliferation-promoting and antiapoptotic properties. The effect of FSH on CREB1 accumulation and the ability of CREB1M1 to reverse the effects of IGF1 on apoptosis indicate that CREB1 is a mediator of hormonal activity, but the inability of either CREB1WT or CREBM1transfection to modify the primary effects of FSH and IGF1 suggest that CREB1 and its phosphorylation do not mediate the action of these hormones on ovarian cell proliferation and apoptosis.
The chipmunk hibernation-related proteins (HPs) HP-20 and HP-27 are components of a 140-kDa complex that dramatically decreases in the blood during hibernation. The HP-20 and HP-27 genes are expressed specifically in the liver and are downregulated in hibernating chipmunks. Hibernation-associated physiological changes are assumed to be under genetic control. Therefore, to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of hibernation, here we examined the mechanisms behind the altered HP-20 and HP-27 gene expression in nonhibernating versus hibernating chipmunks. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses revealed that histone H3 on the HP-20 and HP-27 gene promoters was highly acetylated at lysine (K) 9 and K14 and highly trimethylated at K4 in the liver of nonhibernating chipmunks, while these active histone modifications were nearly absent in hibernating chipmunks. Furthermore, histone acetyltransferases and a histone methyltransferase were associated with the HP-20 and HP-27 gene promoters primarily in nonhibernating chipmunks. Consistent with a previous finding that HNF-1 and USF can activate HP-20 and HP-27 gene transcription by binding to the proximal promoter region, ChIP-quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses revealed that significantly less HNF-1 and USF were bound to these gene promoters in hibernating than in nonhibernating chipmunks. These findings collectively indicated that the hibernation-associated HP-20 and HP-27 gene expression is epigenetically regulated at the transcriptional level by the binding of HNF-1 and USF to their proximal promoters, and that histone modification has a key role in hibernation-associated transcriptional regulation.
The level of saturated fatty acids, such as palmitic acid (PA), correlates with chronic inflammation in obese and metabolic syndrome patients. However, low level of vitamin D3 is observed in those conditions. The aim of this study is to investigate effects of 1α,25(OH)2 D3 on PA-treated THP-1 cells. Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, we measure mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines: TNF-α, Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and chemokine IL-8 under PA and 1α,25(OH)2 D3 influence. PA, at all concentrations (25-100 μM), enhanced LPS stimulatory effect on those mRNA expression compared to LPS-treated and -untreated cells. Combination with 1α,25(OH)2 D3 increased cytokine expression at high (10-6 M) and high-normal (10-8 M) concentrations compared to PA + LPS and LPS alone, both for 2 and 24 h. However, low-normal (10-10 M) and low (10-12 M) levels of 1α,25(OH)2 D3 could not enhance PA effect, but mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine was higher than LPS-treated cells. Upstream pathway of 1α,25(OH)2 D3 , which is cholecalciferol, also gave the similar result. Further, inhibition of calcium pathway does not play a role in this mechanism. Thus, these findings support pro-inflammatory effect of PA and vitamin D3 on innate immune response, especially on fat-induced inflammation.
The effect of vitamin D3 on chronic inflammation in obesity is uncertain. This study shows an in vitro possibility that vitamin D3 could exaggerate inflammation when combined with high SFAs. The idea of using vitamin D3 supplement to modulate inflammation in fat-related inflammation needs further refined experiments before its clinical application.
The aberrant expression of CD40, a co-stimulatory receptor found on the antigen-presenting cells, is involved in the pathogenesis of various degenerative diseases. Our previous study demonstrated that the reduction of cytosolic phospholipase A2 alpha (cPLA2α) protein overexpression and activation in the spinal cord of a mouse model of ALS, hmSOD1 G93A, inhibited CD40 upregulation in microglia. The present study was designed to determine whether cPLA2α has a direct, participatory role in the molecular events leading to CD40 induction.
Cultures of primary mouse microglia or BV-2 microglia cell line exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or interferon gamma (IFNγ) for different periods of time, in order to study the role of cPLA2α in the events leading to CD40 protein induction.
Addition of LPS or IFNγ caused a significant upregulation of cPLA2α and of CD40, while prevention of cPLA2α upregulation by a specific oligonucleotide antisense (AS) prevented the induction of CD40, suggesting a role of cPLA2α in the induction of CD40. Addition of LPS to microglia caused an immediate activation of cPLA2α detected by its phosphorylated form, while addition of IFNγ induced cPLA2α activation at a later time scale (4 h). The activation of cPLA2α is mediated by ERK activity. Suppression of cPLA2α activity inhibited superoxide production by NOX2-NADPH oxidase and activation of NF-κB detected by the phosphorylation of p65 on serine 536 at 15 min by LPS and at 4 h by IFNγ. Inhibition of NOX2 prevented NF-κB activation and CD40 induction but did not affect cPLA2α activation, suggesting cPLA2α is located upstream to NOX2 and NF-κB. The activation of cPLA2 by LPS was mediated by both adaptor proteins downstream to LPS receptor; TRIF and MyD88, while the activation of cPLA2α by IFNγ was mediated by the secreted TNF-α at 4 h. The early activation of STAT1α (detected by phospho-serine727 and phoshpo-tyrosine701) by IFNγ and the late activation of STAT1α by LPS were not affected in the presence of cPLA2α inhibitors, indicating that STAT1α is not under cPLA2α regulation.
Our results show for the first time that cPLA2 upregulates CD40 protein expression induced by either LPS or IFNγ, and this regulatory effect is mediated via the activation of NOX2-NADPH oxidase and NF-κB. Cumulatively, our results indicate that cPLA2α may serve as a pivotal amplifier of the inflammatory response in the CNS.
Ex-vivo expanded mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are increasingly used for paracrine support of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) regeneration, but inconsistent outcomes have hindered ongoing clinical trials. Here, we show that significant heterogeneity in the niche activity of MSCs is created during their culture in various serum-supplemented media. The MSCs cultured under stimulatory or non-stimulatory culture conditions exhibited differences in colony forming unit-fibroblast contents, expression levels of cross-talk molecules (Jagged-1 and CXCL-12) and their support for HSC self-renewal. Accordingly, the enhancing effects of MSCs on hematopoietic engraftment were only visible when HSCs were co-transplanted with MSCs under stimulatory conditions. Of note, these differences in MSCs and their effects on HSCs were readily reversed by switching the cultures, indicating that the difference in niche activity can be caused by distinct functional state, rather than by clonal heterogeneity. Supporting the findings, transcriptomic analysis showed distinct upstream signaling pathways such as inhibition of P53 and activation of ER-stress response gene ATF4 for MSCs under stimulatory conditions. Taken together, our study shows that the niche activity of MSCs can vary rapidly by the extrinsic cues during culture causing variable outcomes in hematopoietic recoveries, and point to the possibility that MSCs can be pre-screened for more predictable efficacy in various cell therapy trials.
Burgeoning evidence supports a role for cyclooxygenase metabolites in regulating membrane excitability in various forms of synaptic plasticity. Two cyclooxygenases, COX-1 and COX-2, catalyze the initial step in the metabolism of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. COX-2 is generally considered inducible, but in glutamatergic neurons in some brain regions, including the cerebral cortex, it is constitutively expressed. However, the transcriptional mechanisms by which this occurs have not been elucidated. Here, we used quantitative PCR and also analyzed reporter gene expression in a mouse line carrying a construct consisting of a portion of the proximal promoter region of the mouse COX-2 gene upstream of luciferase cDNA to characterize COX-2 basal transcriptional regulation in cortical neurons. Extracts from the whole brain and from the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and olfactory bulbs exhibited high luciferase activity. Moreover, constitutive COX-2 expression and luciferase activity were detected in cortical neurons, but not in cortical astrocytes, cultured from wild-type and transgenic mice, respectively. Constitutive COX-2 expression depended on spontaneous but not evoked excitatory synaptic activity and was shown to be N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-dependent. Constitutive promoter activity was reduced in neurons transfected with a dominant-negative cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and was eliminated by mutating the CRE-binding site on the COX-2 promoter. However, mutation of the stimulatory protein-1 (Sp1)-binding site resulted in an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-dependent enhancement of COX-2 promoter activity. Basal binding of the transcription factors CREB and Sp1 to the native neuronal COX-2 promoter was confirmed. In toto, our data suggest that spontaneous glutamatergic synaptic activity regulates constitutive neuronal COX-2 expression via Sp1 and CREB protein-dependent transcriptional mechanisms.
Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1PRF) is tightly regulated by messenger RNA (mRNA) sequences and structures in expressing two or more proteins with precise ratios from a single mRNA. Using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) between (Cy5)EF-G and (Cy3)tRNALys, we studied the translational elongation dynamics of -1PRF in the Escherichia coli dnaX gene, which contains three frameshifting signals: a slippery sequence (A AAA AAG), a Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence and a downstream hairpin. The frameshift promoting signals mostly impair the EF-G-catalyzed translocation step of the two tRNALys and the slippery codons from the A- and P- sites. The hairpin acts as a road block slowing the translocation rate. The upstream SD sequence together with the hairpin promotes dissociation of futile EF-G and thus causes multiple EF-G driven translocation attempts. A slippery sequence also helps dissociation of the EF-G by providing alternative base-pairing options. These results indicate that frameshifting takes place during the repetitive ribosomal conformational changes associated with EF-G dissociation upon unsuccessful translocation attempts of the second slippage codon from the A- to the P- sites.
Reproductive function is driven by the hormonal interplay between the gonads and brain-pituitary axis. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is released in a pulsatile manner, which is critical for the attainment and maintenance of fertility, however, GnRH neurons lack the ability to directly respond to most regulatory factors, and a hierarchical upstream neuronal network governs its secretion. We and others proposed a model in which Kiss1 neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC), so called KNDy neurons, release kisspeptin (a potent GnRH secretagogue) in a pulsatile manner to drive GnRH pulses under the coordinated autosynaptic action of its cotransmitters, the tachykinin neurokinin B (NKB, stimulatory) and dynorphin (inhibitory). Numerous genetic and pharmacological studies support this model; however, additional regulatory mechanisms (upstream of KNDy neurons) and alternative pathways of GnRH secretion (kisspeptin-independent) exist, but remain ill defined. In this aspect, attention to other members of the tachykinin family, namely substance P (SP) and neurokinin A (NKA), has recently been rekindled. Even though there are still major gaps in our knowledge about the functional significance of these systems, substantial evidence, as discussed below, is placing tachykinin signaling as an important pathway for the awakening of the reproductive axis and the onset of puberty to physiological GnRH secretion and maintenance of fertility in adulthood.
The aim of this study was to compare the effects of low-volume, high-intensity aerobic interval training (HAIT) on maximal oxygen consumption (VO₂max), left ventricular (LV) mass, and heart rate recovery (HRR) with high-volume, moderate-intensity continuous aerobic training (CAT) in sedentary adults.
Twenty-four healthy but sedentary male adults (aged 29.2 ± 7.2 years) participated in an 8-week, 3-day a week, supervised exercise intervention. They were randomly assigned to either HAIT (18 min, 180 kcal per exercise session) or CAT (45 min, 360 kcal). VO₂max, LV mass (3T-MRI), and HRR at 1 min (HRR-1) and 2 min (HRR-2) after maximal exercise were measured pre- and post-intervention.
Changes in VO₂max during the 8-week intervention were significant (P &lt; 0.01) in both groups (HAIT, 8.7 ± 3.2 ml kg(-1) min(-1), 22.4 ± 8.9%; CAT, 5.5 ± 2.8 ml kg(-1) min(-1), 14.7 ± 9.5%), while the VO₂max improvement in HAIT was greater (P = 0.02) than in CAT. LV mass in HAIT increased (5.1 ± 8.4 g, 5.7 ± 9.1%, P = 0.05), but not in CAT (0.9 ± 7.8 g, 1.1 ± 8.4%, P = 0.71). While changes in HRR-1 were not significant in either group, change in HRR-2 for HAIT (9.5 ± 6.4 bpm, 19.0 ± 16.0%, P &lt; 0.01) was greater (P = 0.03) than for CAT (1.6 ± 10.9 bpm, 3.9 ± 16.2%, P = 0.42).
This study suggests that HAIT has potential as a time-efficient training mode to improve cardiorespiratory capacity and autonomic nervous system function in sedentary adults.
Vitamin K is the essential co-factor for activation of matrix Gla-protein (MGP), the natural inhibitor of tissue calcification. Biologically inactive, desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP) is a marker of vascular vitamin K status and is described to predict mortality in patients with heart failure and aortic stenosis. We hypothesized that increased dp-ucMGP might be associated with mortality risk in clinically stable patients with chronic vascular disease.
We examined 799 patients (mean age 65.1 ± 9.3 years) who suffered from myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization or first ischemic stroke (pooled Czech samples of EUROASPIRE III and EUROASPIRE-stroke surveys), and followed them in a prospective cohort study. To estimate the 5-year all-cause and cardiovascular mortality we ascertained vital status and declared cause of death. Circulating dp-ucMGP and desphospho-carboxylated MGP (dp-cMGP) were measured by ELISA methods (IDS and VitaK).
During a median follow-up of 2050 days (5.6 years) 159 patients died. In the fully adjusted multivariate Cox proportional hazard model, the patients in the highest quartile of dp-ucMGP (≥ 977 pmol/L) had higher risk of all-cause and cardiovascular 5-year mortality [HRR 1.89 (95% CI, 1.32-2.72) and 1.88 (95% CI, 1.22-2.90)], respectively. Corresponding HRR for dp-cMGP were 1.76 (95% CI, 1.18-2.61) and 1.79 (95% CI, 1.12-2.57).
In patients with overt vascular disease, circulating dp-ucMGP and dp-cMGP were independently associated with the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Since published results are conflicting regarding the dp-cMGP, we propose only circulating dp-ucMGP as a potential biomarker for assessment of additive cardiovascular risk.
To examine the clinical usefulness of heart rate recovery (HRR) post 6-minute walking test (6MWT) as a simple marker of cardiovascular risk in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients in comparison to HRR post cycle ergometry, the validated and more sophisticated protocol.
Seventy-four participants underwent full overnight polysomnography, cycle ergometry and 6MWT. The HRR at 1, 2 and 3 min (HRR-1, HRR-2 and HRR-3) 6MWT was compared to HRR at 1, 2, and 3 min post cycle ergometry in normal subjects and in moderate and severe OSA patients before and after 6-month CPAP treatment.
The HRR-1, HRR-2 and HRR-3 in 6MWT were significantly different between normal, moderate and severe OSA patients with higher rates achieved in normal. The higher the severity of OSA the lower the HRR was. There were also no differences found between work rate and distance walked during cycle ergometry or 6MWT, respectively, concerning normal, moderate and severe OSA patients. Heart rate recovery was further associated with minimum saturation of oxygen during sleep independently of the duration of apnea episodes of BMI and ESS. The treatment with CPAP had a beneficial effect on HRR both post-6MWT and post cycle ergometry.
Autonomic nervous system dysfunction in OSA can be found even with submaximal exertion. Heart rate recovery post-6MWT, such as HRR post cycle ergometry, was significantly impaired in OSA patients in comparison to normals and was favorably influenced from CPAP treatment. Furthermore, it was found to be more sensitive compared with distance walked in 6MWT in discriminating severity of OSA. The HRR post-6MWT was found to be an easily measured and reliable marker of OSA severity both before and after CPAP treatment.
Despite a growing clinical interest in determining the heart rate recovery (HRR) response to exercise, the limits of a normal HRR have not yet been well established.
This study was designed to examine HRR following a controlled maximal exercise test in healthy, physically active adult men.
The subjects recruited (n = 789) performed a maximal stress test on a treadmill. HRR indices were calculated by subtracting the first and third minute heart rates (HRs) during recovery from the maximal HR obtained during stress testing and designated these as HRR-1 and HRR-3, respectively. The relative change in HRR was determined as the decrease in HR produced at the time points 1 and 3 min after exercise as a percentage of the peak HR (%HRR-1/HR(peak) and %HRR-3/HR(peak), respectively). Percentile values of HRR-1 and HRR-3 were generated for the study population.
Mean HHR-1 and HHR-3 were 15.24 ± 8.36 and 64.58 ± 12.17 bpm, respectively, and %HRR-1/HR(peak) and %HRR-3/HR(peak) were 8.60 ± 4.70 and 36.35 ± 6.79%, respectively. Significant correlation was detected between Peak VO2 and HRR-3 (r = 0.36; p &lt; 0.001) or %HRR-3/HR(peak) (r = 0.23; p &lt; 0.001).
Our study provides normality data for HRR following a maximal Ergometry test obtained in a large population of physically active men.
There are few studies reporting mortality of women of reproductive age (WRA) in developing countries. The trend and patterns of their mortality may be important for documenting the health status of the population in general.
We used a prospective open cohort of women aged 12 to 49 years living in the Bandim Health Project's rural Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) in 5 regions of Guinea-Bissau from 1996 to 2007. Information on in- and out-migration and deaths were collected through the HDSS routine procedures. We assessed the trends in mortality and the associated determinants using Cox regression models.
We followed 27,185 WRA for 141,693 person-years-at-risk (PYO) among whom 9,093 moved out and 1,006 died. Overall standardized mortality rate was 759 per 100,000 PYO. WRA mortality did not decline, but three periods could be distinguished: a stable mortality between 1996-2000 followed by 14% increase in mortality [Hazard rate ratio (HRR) = 1.14; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.98-1.32; p = 0.08] between 2001-2003, and then in the last period from 2004-2007 a 25% decline (HRR = 0.75; 95% CI: 0.64-0.87; p &lt; 0.001) in relation to the first period. Compared with the years 1990-1996 mortality increased in the first two periods until 2003; only in the last period did mortality reach the same level as in 1990-1996 (HRR = 0.96; 95% CI: 0.82-1.13; p = 0.62). The level of mortality differed between regions. In the adjusted analysis the eastern regions Bafata (HRR = 1.79; 95% CI: 1.38-2.32; p &lt; 0.001) and Gabu (HRR = 1.70; 95% CI: 1.28-2.26; p &lt; 0.001) had significantly higher mortality, but the hazard rate did not differ by ethnic group. As expected the rate increased with increasing age.
Over the twelve-year period mortality of WRA did not decline. A stable mortality in the beginning was followed by an increase and then a return to the previous levels. Further monitoring of mortality is needed to identify the risk factors for the striking regional differences. Advantage should be taken of the HDSS to monitor progress towards the MDGs and beyond.
Five-year survival after resection of colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLCM) is &lt;30%. We recently found that aurora kinase A (AURKA) drives 20q gain-associated tumour progression and is associated with disease recurrence. This study evaluates the prognostic value of AURKA expression in CRCLM of patients who underwent liver resection.
Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were generated using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded CRCLM and matched primary tumour from a multi-institutional cohort of patients with CRCLM who underwent liver resection between 1990 and 2010. Tissue microarrays were stained for AURKA using immunohistochemistry, and a hazard rate ratio (HRR) for the association between overall survival (OS) and nuclear AURKA expression in CRCLM was calculated. Results were validated by 500-fold cross-validation.
The expression of AURKA was evaluated in CRCLM of 343 patients. High AURKA expression was associated with poor OS (HRR 1.55, P&lt;0.01), with a cross-validated average HRR of 1.57 (P=0.02). Average HRR was adjusted for the established prognostic clinicopathological variables in a multivariate analysis (average HRR 1.66; P=0.02). The expression of AURKA in CRCLM was correlated to its expression in corresponding primary tumour (P&lt;0.01).
The expression of AURKA protein is a molecular biomarker with prognostic value for patients with CRCLM, independent of established clinicopathological variables.
Although minimization of crystalloids is a widely adopted practice in the resuscitation of patients with severe hemorrhage, its direct impact on high-ratio resuscitation (HRR) outcomes has not been analyzed. We hypothesize that HRR patients will have worse outcomes from crystalloid use.
This was a 4-year retrospective multi-institutional analysis (MIA) of patients who received massive transfusion protocol (MTP) managed with damage-control laparotomy. Ratios of fresh frozen plasma-packed red blood cell (PRBC) were calculated and divided in two groups: HRR (1-1:2) and low-ratio resuscitation (LRR &lt; 1:2). Major outcome of interest was to analyze the direct impact of 24-hour crystalloid volume on HRR MTP patients who received 10 or more units of PRBC. Statistical analysis included analysis of variance, Fisher's exact, Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves, and multiple logistic regression.
Total of five Level I trauma centers participated with 451 patients who received MTP with 10 or more units of PRBC (fresh frozen plasma/PRBC ratios, n = 365 (80.9%) HRR vs. n = 86 (19.0%) LRR. Overall 24-hour KM survival for the HRR versus LRR was 85.2% versus 68.6% (p = 0.0004). The volume of crystalloids on KM survival curve in HRR MTP patients was not significant for mortality (p = 0.52). Morbidity odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for complications were not significant for HRR but were for crystalloids: bacteremia, 1.05 (1.0-1.1); adult respiratory distress syndrome, 1.13 (1.0-1.2), and acute renal failure, 1.05 (1.0-1.1).
Our MIA results support previous studies with decreased mortality in HRR group when compared with LRR. This is the first MIA to demonstrate increased morbidity from crystalloid use in HRR. Within all MTPs with 10 or more units of PRBC, HRR was not a predictor of morbidity, but crystalloid volume was. Caution in overzealous use of crystalloid during HRR is warranted.
Therapeutic study, level IV.
Interleukin 1β (IL 1β) levels are associated with prognosis in heart failure. The cardiac adrenergic activity as assessed by metaiodobenzylguanidine (I123 MIBG) scintigraphy along with exercise parameters are important predictors of prognosis. The relationship between these variables is not fully established.
To evaluate the association of IL 1β levels with exercise and I123 MIBG parameters.
Cross-sectional observational study evaluating 25 consecutive patients with heart failure and ejection fraction lower than 45% by means of: determination of IL 1β levels; I123 MIBG parameters [early and late heart/mediastinum ratio, washout rate (WO)]; and treadmill exercise test using the ramp protocol.
The patients were divided into two groups according to their IL 1β levels (normal vs. increased). The group with increased levels showed lower double-product reserve (DPR); lower functional capacity (FC); slower heart rate recovery at the first (HRR 1º) and second minute (HRR 2º); and higher WO. In the univariate analysis, all variables correlated with IL 1β; DPR: r = 0.203, p = 0.024; FC: r = 0.181, p = 0.034; HRR 1º: r = 0.182, p = 0.034; HRR 2º: r = 0.204, p = 0.023; WO: r = 0.263, p = 0.009. In the multivariate analysis, only WO maintained a significant correlation (r² = 0.263, p = 0.009).
Adrenergic overactivity was the main determinant of IL 1β levels, thus demonstrating that an excessive sympathetic activity influences the systemic inflammatory response. Exercise test variables were not able to identify patients with high IL 1β levels.
Uric acid (UA) is known to be associated with excess adiposity and insulin resistance. Our aim was to investigate the relationship between UA and the factors associated with the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), both initially and longitudinally.
Serum UA was assessed as a potential determinant of concurrent blood pressure, serum lipids, glucose regulation measured via an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), acute insulin response (AIR), and insulin action (M) measured with hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps in 245 participants (72% Native American, 56% male). UA was also assessed as a predictor of the above variables in 60 participants with follow-up data available (median follow-up time=11.2 years [interquartile range (IQR)=8.1, 13.6 years]. The impact of UA on the risk of T2DM was determined as 36 of the 245 participants developed T2DM after the baseline visit.
UA was negatively associated with both concurrent and future M, such that for every 1 mg/dL increase in serum UA, M decreased 7.6% (P&lt;0.001) and future M decreased 6.3% (P=0.02). However, UA was not associated with AIR (P=0.7). UA concentrations were a predictor of T2DM [hazard risk ratio (HRR)=1.5; P=0.02]. UA was positively associated with both concurrent blood pressure and lipids and also predicted future increases in blood pressure and total cholesterol.
Not only did UA associate with concomitant insulin action, blood pressure, and lipids, it also predicted future declines in insulin action and T2DM. UA is a potential target for preventing decreases in insulin sensitivity and rises in blood pressure and cholesterol.
Increased vagal activity is associated with obesity and metabolic risk in children and adolescents. The aim of the present cross-sectional study was to examine the association of parasympathetic function, as assessed by heart rate recovery (HRR) from a maximal exercise cycle-ergometer test, with obesity traits and related cardiometabolic risk factors in Spanish children and adolescents.
A sample of 437 Spanish 9-year-old-children and 235 15-year-old-adolescents participated in the study. The variables measured were anthropometric characteristics (height, body mass and waist circumference) and physical activity using the Actigraph accelerometer. Additional measured outcomes included fasting insulin, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) and blood pressure. A metabolic risk score was computed as the mean of the standardised outcomes scores. The HRR was calculated as the difference between peak heart rate and heart rate 1, 3 and 5 min after cessation of the maximal ergometer test. Diastolic blood pressure was associated with all the HRR parameters in 9-year-old-girls. In 9-year-old-boys, the 3-min HRR was inversely associated with systolic blood pressure (p &lt; 0.05) and Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) (p &lt; 0.05). Five minute HRR was inversely associated with waist circumference (p &lt; 0.05), sum of five skinfolds (p &lt; 0.01) and HOMA (p = 0.004). There were no significant associations in adolescents. In 9-year-old-girls, the adjusted 5-min HRR showed significant differences between quartile 2 and 4 of metabolic risk (p = 0.011). In all samples, the adjusted HRR (1-, 3- and 5-min HRR) did not show significant differences across quartiles.
HRR was inversely associated with obesity traits and related cardiometabolic risk factors mainly in healthy boys.
Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways regulate many cellular functions including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis. We evaluate genetic variation in the c-Jun-N-terminal kinases, p38, and extracellular regulated kinases 1/2 MAPK-signaling pathways and colon and rectal cancer risk using data from population-based case-control studies (colon: n = 1555 cases, 1956 controls; rectal: n = 754 cases, 959 controls). We assess 19 genes (DUSP1, DUSP2, DUSP4, DUSP6, DUSP7, MAP2K1, MAP3K1, MAP3K2, MAP3K3, MAP3K7, MAP3K9, MAP3K10, MAP3K11, MAPK1, MAPK3, MAPK8, MAPK12, MAPK14 and RAF1). MAP2K1 rs8039880 [odds ratio (OR) = 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.38, 0.83; GG versus AA genotype] and MAP3K9 rs11625206 (OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.14, 1.76; recessive model) were associated with colon cancer (P  (adj) value &lt; 0.05). DUSP1 rs322351 (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.09, 1.88; TT versus CC) and MAPK8 rs10857561 (OR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.08, 2.03; AA versus GG/GA) were associated with rectal cancer (P  (adj) &lt; 0.05). Aspirin/non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, cigarette smoking and body mass index interacted with several genes to alter cancer risk. Genetic variants had unique associations with KRAS, TP53 and CIMP+ tumors. DUSP2 rs1724120 [hazard rate ratio (HRR) = 0.72, 95%CI = 0.54, 0.96; AA versus GG/GA), MAP3K10 rs112956 (HRR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.10, 1.76; CT/TT versus CC) and MAP3K11 (HRR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.18, 2.62 TT versus GG/GT) influenced survival after diagnosis with colon cancer; MAP2K1 rs8039880 (HRR = 2.53, 95% CI 1.34, 4.79 GG versus AG/GG) and Raf1 rs11923427 (HRR = 0.59 95% CI = 0.40, 0.86; AA versus TT/TA) were associated with rectal cancer survival. These data suggest that genetic variation in the MAPK-signaling pathway influences colorectal cancer risk and survival after diagnosis. Associations may be modified by lifestyle factors that influence inflammation and oxidative stress.
To describe the impact of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on mortality rates among adults participating in an HIV community cohort study in north-west Tanzania.
Serological and demographic surveillance rounds have been undertaken in a population of approximately 30,000 people since 1994. Free HIV care including ART has been available since 2005. Event history analysis was used to compare mortality rates among HIV-negative and HIV-positive adults in the 5-year period before and after the introduction of ART. Crude and adjusted hazard ratios were calculated using exponential regression models. Interaction between time period and HIV status was assessed to investigate whether there was a non-linear relationship between these two variables.
Male and female mortality patterns varied over the pre- and post-ART period. In women, the crude death rate fell for both HIV negatives and HIV positives hazard rate ratio (HRR = 0.71; 95%CI 0.51-0.99 and HRR = 0.68; 95%CI: 0.46-0.99, respectively). For men, the mortality among the HIV negatives increased (HRR = 1.47; 95%CI: 1.06-2.03) while the decline in mortality among the HIV positives (HRR = 0.77; 95%CI 0.52-1.13) was not statistically significant. The largest decrease in HIV-positive mortality over the two periods was among the 30- to 44-year-old age group for women and among the 45- to 59-year-old age group for men.
There has been a modest effect on mortality in the study population following the introduction of free ART 5 years ago. Improving access to treatment and placing greater focus on retaining individuals on treatment are essential if the full potential of treatment for reducing HIV-related mortality is to be realised.
The cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) response in heart failure with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFPEF) is incompletely understood. We aimed to describe the CPET response in HFPEF and to assess its invasive hemodynamic determinants.
Ten patients with HFPEF and 8 asymptomatic controls underwent resting and exercise right heart catheterization and maximal symptom-limited CPET. The slope of the minute ventilation/carbon dioxide production relationship (VE/VCO(2) slope; 34.3 ± 5.4 vs. 28.4 ± 3.4; P = .02) was steeper, peak oxygen consumption (peak VO(2); 15.1 ± 4.9 vs. 26.6 ± 12.5 mL∗kg(-1)∗min(-1); P = .02) was lower, and heart rate recovery 1 minute after exercise termination (HRR-1; 10 ± 5 vs. 27 ± 10 beats/min; P &lt; .001) was slower in HFPEF compared to controls. A steeper VE/VCO(2) slope (r = 0.67, P = .002), lower peak VO(2) (r = -0.48, P = .04), and slower HRR-1 (r = -0.58, P = .02) were significantly related to a higher ratio of the change in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure per change in work rate as a measure of the left ventricular pressure volume relationship.
In HFPEF patients, fundamental alterations in the CPET profile occur and these may, in part, result from the rapid rise in left ventricular filling pressures which accompanies exercise in these patients.
Using data from the Norwegian Hip Fracture Register, 8639 cemented and 2477 uncemented primary hemiarthroplasties for displaced fractures of the femoral neck in patients aged &gt; 70 years were included in a prospective observational study. A total of 218 re-operations were performed after cemented and 128 after uncemented procedures. Survival of the hemiarthroplasties was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and hazard rate ratios (HRR) for revision were calculated using Cox regression analyses. At five years the implant survival was 97% (95% confidence interval (CI) 97 to 97) for cemented and 91% (95% CI 87 to 94) for uncemented hemiarthroplasties. Uncemented hemiarthroplasties had a 2.1 times increased risk of revision compared with cemented prostheses (95% confidence interval 1.7 to 2.6, p &lt; 0.001). The increased risk was mainly caused by revisions for peri-prosthetic fracture (HRR = 17), aseptic loosening (HRR = 17), haematoma formation (HRR = 5.3), superficial infection (HRR = 4.6) and dislocation (HRR = 1.8). More intra-operative complications, including intra-operative death, were reported for the cemented hemiarthroplasties. However, in a time-dependent analysis, the HRR for re-operation in both groups increased as follow-up increased. This study showed that the risk for revision was higher for uncemented than for cemented hemiarthroplasties.
We aimed to determine the status of the autonomic nervous system in patients with autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) who were normotensive and had normal renal function.
A total of 28 normotensive ADPKD patients with normal renal function and 30 healthy control subjects consented to participate in the study. Heart rate recovery (HRR) indices were defined as the reduction in heart rate from the rate at peak exercise to the rate at the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th minutes after the cessation of the exercise stress test; these results were indicated HRR(1), HRR(2), HRR(3) and HRR(5), respectively.
The 1st- and 2nd-minute HRR indices of patients with ADPKD were significantly lower than those of the healthy control group (27.1±7.9 vs 32.0±7.9; p=0.023 and 46.9±11.5 vs 53.0±9.0; p=0.029, respectively). Similarly, HRR indices after the 3rd and 5th minutes of the recovery period were significantly lower in patients with ADPKD when compared with indices in the control group (56.7±12.0 vs 65.1±11.2; p=0.008 and 62.5±13.8 vs 76.6±15.5; p =0.001, respectively).
Impaired HRR index is associated with normotensive early-stage ADPKD patients. Increased renal ischemia and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) may contribute to impairment in the autonomic nervous system in these patients before the development of hypertension. Even if ADPKD patients are normotensive, there appears to be an association with autonomic dysfunction and polycystic kidney disease.
Delayed postexercise heart rate recovery (HRR) has been associated with disability and poor prognosis in chronic cardiopulmonary diseases. The usefulness of HRR to predict exercise impairment and mortality in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), however, remains largely unexplored.
Seventy-two patients with PAH of varied etiology (New York Heart Association classes I-IV) and 21 age- and gender-matched controls underwent a maximal incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), with heart rate being recorded up to the fifth minute of recovery.
Heart rate recovery was consistently lower in the patients compared with the controls (P &lt; .05). The best cutoff for HRR in 1 minute (HRR(1 min)) to discriminate the patients from the controls was 18 beats. Compared with patients with HRR(1 min) ≤ 18 (n = 40), those with HRR(1 min) &gt;18 (n = 32) had better New York Heart Association scores, resting hemodynamics and 6-minute walking distance. In fact, HRR(1 min) &gt;18 was associated with a range of maximal and submaximal CPET variables indicative of less severe exercise impairment (P &lt; .05). The single independent predictor of HRR(1 min) ≤ 18 was the 6-minute walking distance (odds ratio [95% CI] 0.99 [0.98-1.00], P &lt; .05). On a multiple regression analysis that considered only CPET-independent variables, HRR(1 min) ≤ 18 was the single predictor of mortality (hazard ratio [95% CI] 1.19 [1.03-1.37], P &lt; .05).
Preserved HRR(1 min) (&gt;18 beats) is associated with less impaired responses to incremental exercise in patients with PAH. Conversely, a delayed HRR(1 min) response has negative prognostic implications, a finding likely to be clinically useful when more sophisticated (and costlier) analyses provided by a full CPET are not available.
Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is associated with autonomic dysfunction, whereas increased heart rate (HR), HR recovery time (HRR-1), QT-corrected interval (QTc) and P-wave dispersion (Pd) are associated with cardiovascular events. The aim of the current investigation was to clarify the influence of OSAS severity on these cardiac parameters.
Ninety newly diagnosed and untreated patients with OSAS underwent overnight polysomnography and cardiopulmonary exercise testing, including HRR-1, echocardiography, 24-hour Holter electrocardiography, surface electrocardiogram (ECG) and measurement of several metabolic parameters. The patients were divided into the following 4 groups: 26 with apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) &lt;5, 20 with 5 ≤ AHI &lt;15, 20 with 15 ≤ AHI &lt;30 and 24 with AHI ≥30. QTc and Pd were calculated in all leads of the surface ECG. Mean HR was measured using 24-hour Holter ECG, and HRR-1 was measured using cardiopulmonary exercise testing.
QTc was increased in patients with moderate-to-severe OSAS. Pd was significantly increased in patients with OSAS compared with those without OSAS. In addition, Pd was correlated with AHI and associated with the severity of disease. Mean HRs over a period of 24 hours during wakefulness and sleep correlated significantly with AHI and the lowest SpO2 in patients with OSAS, whereas HRR-1 was inversely correlated with the severity of OSAS, as expressed by AHI.
We showed that HR, Pd, HRR-1 and QT-corrected time are correlated with OSAS severity. Further studies are required in order to investigate the prognostic effect of HRR-1, Pd, HR and QTc in OSAS.
Several skeletal muscle abnormalities have been identified in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), including endothelial dysfunction. We hypothesized that skeletal muscle microcirculation, assessed by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), is impaired in CHF patients and is associated with disease severity.
Eighty-three stable patients with mild-moderate CHF (72 males, mean age 54 ± 14 years, body mass index 26.7 ± 3.4 kg/m(2)) and 8 healthy subjects, matched for age, gender and body mass index, underwent NIRS with the vascular occlusion technique and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) evaluation on the same day. Tissue oxygen saturation (StO(2), %), defined as the percentage of hemoglobin saturation in the microvasculature compartments, was measured in the thenar muscle by NIRS before, during and after 3-minute occlusion of the brachial artery. Measurements included StO(2), oxygen consumption rate (OCR, %/min) and reperfusion rate (RR, %/min). All subjects underwent a symptom-limited CPET on a cycle ergometer. Measurements included VO(2) at peak exercise (VO(2)peak, ml/kg/min) and anaerobic threshold (VO(2)AT, ml/kg/min), VE/VCO(2) slope, chronotropic reserve (CR, %) and heart rate recovery (HRR(1), bpm).
CHF patients had significantly lower StO(2) (75 ± 8.2 vs 80.3 ± 6, p &lt; 0.05), lower OCR (32.3 ± 10.4 vs 37.7 ± 5.5, p &lt; 0.05) and lower RR (10 ± 2.8 vs 15.7 ± 6.3, p &lt; 0.05) compared with healthy controls. CHF patients with RR ≥9.5 had a significantly greater VO(2)peak (p &lt; 0.001), VO(2)AT (p &lt; 0.01), CR (p = 0.01) and HRR(1) (p = 0.01), and lower VE/VCO(2) slope (p = 0.001), compared to those with RR &lt;9.5. In a multivariate analysis, RR was identified as an independent predictor of VO(2)peak, VE/VCO(2) slope and HRR(1).
Peripheral muscle microcirculation, as assessed by NIRS, is significantly impaired in CHF patients and is associated with disease severity.
Chronotropic response to exercise and heart rate recovery immediately after exercise (HRR(1) ) are valid prognostic markers in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). The aim of this study was to evaluate heart rate profile during and after exercise in CHF patients early after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation.
We enrolled seven stable consecutive CHF patients (five males, mean age: 45 ± 16 years) after 1 month of LVAD (HeartMate II; Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, CA, USA) implantation, seven healthy subjects, and 14 patients with advanced HF (HF control group) who performed an incremental symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). CHF patients performed CPET at 1 and 3 months after LVAD. HRR(1) was defined as the HR difference from peak to 1 minute after exercise and chronotropic response to exercise as the chronotropic reserve ([CR, %]=[peak HR-resting HR/220-age-resting HR]× 100).
LVAD patients 3 months after implantation had a significantly different HR profile during exercise compared to healthy controls, with significantly lower CR (57 ± 31 vs 90 ± 14, %, P &lt; 0.001) and HRR(1) (14 ± 6 vs 28 ± 8, bpm, P &lt; 0.01). HR profile during exercise did not significantly change 1 and 3 months after LVAD implantation. There was no statistical difference compared to HF control group and LVAD group regarding cardiopulmonary parameters.
LVAD patients present an impaired CR and an abnormal HRR(1) after implantation, indicating significant cardiac autonomic abnormalities. These alterations seem to remain unaltered 3 months after LVAD implantation.
The objective was to evaluate the impact of gender on long-term survival of patients who underwent non-cardiac vascular surgery.
Our prospectively collected data contained information on 560 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA), 923 elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs (AAA) and 1046 lower limb reconstructions (LLR). Patient characteristics and long-term mortality of women were compared to that of men. Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves were constructed for men and women, on which we superimposed age- and sex-matched KM survival curves of the general population. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify risk factors for mortality.
Men in the CEA group had statistically significant higher all-cause mortality, hazard rate ratio (HRR) 1.41 (95% CI 1.01-1.98) No differences in mortality between the genders were observed in the AAA and LLR groups. Overall, men had more co-morbidities but received more disease-specific medication compared to women. Women retained their higher life expectancy after CEA but lost it in the AAA and LLR groups.
Women retain their higher life expectancy after CEA; however, after AAA repair and LLR, this advantage is lost. Both men and women received too little disease-specific medication, but women were worse off.
Epicardial fat tissue has unique endocrine and paracrine functions that affect the cardiac autonomic system. Epicardial fat thickness (EFT) and blunted heart rate recovery (HRR) are newly identified cardiovascular risk factors in patients with metabolic syndrome (MS). The objective of this study is to evaluate the association between EFT and HRR in patients with MS. Forty patients with MS and 36 healthy controls were included in the study. Echocardiographic EFT and HRR at 1min after exercise termination (HRR-1) are measured and compared between the two groups. HRR-1 equal to or lower than 18 beats is considered as blunted HRR. EFT was increased (7.2 ± 2 vs. 5.6 ± 1.8 mm; p = 0.001) and HRR-1 was significantly reduced in patients with MS compared to control group (21 ± 8 vs. 26 ± 9; p = 0.006). Among the MS patients, subjects with blunted HRR had increased EFT compared to patients without blunted HRR (8.5 ± 2.0 vs. 5.9 ± 1.1 mm, p &lt; 0.001). In multivariate analysis, EFT was the only independent predictor of blunted HRR in patients with MS (95% confidence interval = 1.42-3.87, OR = 2.34, p = 0.001). Furthermore, EFT of equal to or thicker than 5.5 mm was associated with the blunted HRR with 84% sensitivity and 52% specificity (ROC area under curve: 0.84, 95% confidence interval = 0.70-0.96, p &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, EFT is an independent predictor of blunted HRR, a novel cardiovascular risk factor, in patients with MS.
The study aimed to evaluate whether the inflammatory marker "high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP)" level was associated with impaired heart rate recovery at 1 min after exercise termination (HRR-1) in middle-aged patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
Thirty middle-aged male patients (40-64 years old) with severe OSA (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] ≥ 30 h(-1)) and 30 subjects without OSA (AHI &lt; 5 h(-1)), matched with age and body mass index (BMI), were recruited. All subjects underwent an overnight polysomnography and completed a symptom-limited maximal exercise test. Cardiopulmonary parameters included peak oxygen consumption (VO(2peak)) and heart rate response during and immediately after exercise. Fasting blood samples were drawn for hsCRP analysis.
Patients with severe OSA had significantly higher hsCRP levels (0.18 vs. 0.07 mg/dl, P &lt; 0.01), lower reduced HRR-1, peak heart rate, and VO(2peak) values than those in the controls. The hsCRP levels significantly correlated with HRR-1 in the OSA group (r = -0.69, P &lt; 0.01) after adjustment for VO(2peak) (r = -0.66, P &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that HRR-1 and AHI were significant predictors of hsCRP levels in all participants (adjusted R(2) = 0.53, P &lt; 0.01).
Blunted HRR was shown in middle-aged men with severe OSA, and it was associated with high hsCRP levels significantly.
Poor mental health may influence people's decisions about, and ability to, keep working into later adulthood. The identification of factors that drive retirement provides valuable information for policymakers attempting to mitigate the effects of population ageing. This study examined whether mental health predicts subsequent retirement in a general population sample, and whether this association varied with the timing of retirement.
Longitudinal data from 2,803 people aged 45-75 years were drawn from five waves of the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey. Discrete-time survival analyses were used to estimate the association between mental health and retirement. Mental health was measured using the Mental Health Index (MHI-5). The relative influences of other health, social, financial, and work-related predictors of retirement were considered to determine the unique contribution of mental health to retirement behaviour.
Poor mental health was associated with higher rates of retirement in men (hazard rate ratio, HRR 1.19, 95% CI 1.01-1.29), and workforce exit more generally in women (HRR 1.14, 95% CI 1.07-1.22). These associations varied with the timing of retirement and were driven by early retirees specifically. Physical functioning, income, social activity, job conditions (including job stress for women and job control for men), and aspects of job satisfaction also predicted subsequent retirement.
Poor mental and physical health predict workforce departure in mid-to-late adulthood, particularly early retirement. Strategies to accommodate health conditions in the workplace may reduce rates of early retirement and encourage people to remain at work into later adulthood.
An earlier study indicated a possible relationship between Tourette syndrome (TS) and the cytokines. To explore this further, we analyzed the association of the polymorphisms, IL8 -251A/T, IL12B -1188A/C and TNF-α -238A/G, in the IL8, IL12B and TNF-α cytokine genes with TS in a Chinese Han population. A total of 108 patients diagnosed with TS and their parents were recruited for the study. The genetic contributions of the IL8 -251A/T, IL12B -1188A/C, and TNF-α -238A/G polymorphisms were evaluated using polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme digestion (PCR-RFLP) and haplotype relative risk (HRR) and transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) statistics. Our results revealed no significant associations between the IL8 -251A/T, IL12B -1188A/C and TNF-α -238A/G polymorphisms and TS (for IL8 -251A/T, TDT=0.418, df=1, P=0.518; HRR=2.17, X(2)=3.000, P=0.083, 95%CI: 0.900-5.230; for IL12B -1188A/C, TDT=1.131, df=1, P=0.288; HRR=1.27, X(2)=0.35, P=0.549, 95%CI: 0.580-2.790; for TNF-α -238A/G, TDT=2.793, df=1, P=0.095; HRR=0.27, X(2)=2.90, P=0.089, 95%CI: 0.061-1.217). This result was confirmed using haplotype-based haplotype relative risk (HHRR) which allows the two alleles in each genotype to be considered separately. Our data suggests that the IL-8 -251A/T, IL-12B -1188A/C and TNF-α -238A/G polymorphisms may not be associated with susceptibility to TS in the Chinese Han population studied. However, these results need to be replicated using larger datasets collected from different populations.
Most developing countries are implementing the WHO immunisation programme. Although vaccines reach most children, many modifications of the recommended schedule are observed in practice. We investigated the association between vaccination status and risk of hospitalisation in Guinea-Bissau.
From May 2003 to May 2004, all consultations of children less than five years of age at the outpatient clinic of the paediatric ward at the national hospital in Bissau were registered. For each consultation, information was collected about the child's name, sex, age and socio-cultural conditions, as well as diagnosis and whether the child was hospitalised. Information about vaccinations was also registered from the child's vaccination card. We analysed the association between vaccination status and risk of hospitalisation in age intervals according to the pre-dominant vaccines. We particularly emphasised the comparison of those who had received the recommended vaccination for the age groups and those who were delayed and only had the previous vaccinations. We also examined those who had received the vaccines out of sequence.
Information about vaccinations was available for 11,949 outpatient children of whom 2219 (19%) were hospitalised. Among children less than 3 months of age, unvaccinated children compared to BCG children had as expected a higher risk of hospitalisation; controlled for important determinants of hospitalisation, the hospitalisation risk ratio (HRR) was 1.99 (95% CI 1.37-2.89). In contrast, there was no difference in the HRR for children aged 1½-8 months who were delayed and had only received BCG compared to those who as recommended had received diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine after BCG (HRR=1.10 (0.77-1.59)). In the age interval 9-17 months of age, children who were delayed and had only received DTP had significantly higher risk of hospitalisation compared with children who as recommended had measles vaccine (MV) as the most recent vaccination (HRR=1.39 (1.16-1.66)). Having received DTP after MV (HRR=1.60 (1.15-2.24)) or MV and DTP simultaneously (HRR=1.51 (1.16-1.97)) was also associated with higher risk than MV only as most recent vaccination. In contrast, the children aged 18-59 months who as recommended had received a DTP booster after MV did not have lower risk of hospitalisations compared with children who were delayed and had received only MV (RR=0.90 (0.75-1.07)). After 9 months of age, there was a significant difference in the female-male HRR for children who had MV (HRR=0.85 (0.72-1.00)) or DTP (HRR=1.08 (0.96-1.22)) as most recent vaccination (p=0.02, test of interaction).
Following the recommended vaccination schedule for BCG and MV is associated with a reduced risk of hospitalisation but this is not the case for DTP and booster DTP. Receiving DTP simultaneously with MV or after MV is associated with increased risk of hospitalisation. Vaccines have sex-differential effects on the risk of hospitalisation.
Contrast media-induced nephropathy (CIN) is associated with markedly increased morbidity and mortality. Although creatinine is at present routinely used to characterize renal function, many studies and guidelines recommend using the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) since it was found to be much more accurate.
To assess whether the eGFR or creatinine alone provided a better predictive value for long-term mortality after contrast media-associated renal impairment.
From a prospective trial with 412 patients undergoing heart catheterization, creatinine and eGFR before and after 24 h, 48-72 h, and 30 d after contrast-media exposure were assessed as well as long-term mortality.
Univariate Cox regression models identified increases in creatinine after 48 h (hazard rate ratio [HRR] 1.754, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.134-2.712) and 30 d (HRR 3.157, 95% CI 1.968-5.064) as well as decreases in eGFR after 30 d (HRR 0.962, 95% CI 0.939-0.986) to be significant predictors of long-term mortality. However, by multivariable Cox regression, only increases in creatinine after 48 h (HRR 1.608, 95% CI 1.002-2.581) and after 30 d (HRR 2.685, 95% CI 1.598-4.511) turned out to be significant and independent predictors of mortality. With regard to a possibly critical threshold of creatinine increase, our data confirmed the historically grown increase in creatinine of 0.5 mg/dl or more during the first 48 h as being associated with increased mortality (p = 0.016, log rank test).
Serum creatinine, but not eGFR, was predictive for long-term mortality, with a threshold of 0.5 mg/dl or more indicating worse prognosis.
Different exercise modes result in different heart rate recovery (HRR) patterns which could be related to the greater vagal reactivation following arm compared to leg-ergometry.
Heart rate recovery was calculated following maximal arm and leg-ergometry.
HRR-1 following maximal arm-ergometry was significantly higher than HRR-1 post maximal and sub-maximal leg-ergometry.
This may be of clinical significance to individuals relying on their upper body for locomotion.
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder resulting in multisystemic inflammatory damage. It is reported that cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are responsible for 20%-30% of deaths in patients with SLE. Heart rate recovery after exercise is a function of vagal reactivation, and its impairment is an independent prognostic indicator for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. The aim of our study was to evaluate the heart rate recovery index in patients with SLE.
The study population included 48 patients with SLE (35 women, mean age 46.3 ± 12.8 yrs, mean disease duration 6.0 ± 2.3 yrs) and 44 healthy controls (30 women, mean age 45.7 ± 12.9 yrs). Basal electrocardiography, echocardiography, and treadmill exercise testing were performed on all patients and controls. The heart rate recovery index was defined as the reduction in the heart rate from the rate at peak exercise to the rate at the first minute (HRR(1)), second minute (HRR(2)), third minute (HRR(3)), and fifth minute (HRR(5)) after stopping exercise stress testing.
There were significant differences in HRR(1) and HRR(2) indices between patients with SLE and the control group (24.1 ± 6.5 vs 33.3 ± 9.3; p &lt; 0.001, and 44.6 ± 13.3 vs 53.7 ± 9.9; p &lt; 0.001, respectively). Similarly, HRR(3) and HRR(5) indices of the recovery period were lower in patients with SLE, compared with indices in the control group (57.6 ± 13.0 vs 64.9 ± 11.7; p = 0.006, and 67.2 ± 12.3 vs 75.0 ± 15.4; p = 0.009, respectively). Effort capacity was markedly lower (9.0 ± 1.9 vs 11.1 ± 2.3 metabolic equivalents; p = 0.001, respectively) among the patients with SLE.
The heart rate recovery index is deteriorated in patients with SLE. When the prognostic significance of the heart rate recovery index is considered, these results may contribute to explain the increased occurrence of cardiac death. It points to the importance of the heart rate recovery index in the identification of high-risk patients.
Heart rate recovery after exercise is a function of vagal reactivation, and its impairment is an independent prognostic indicator for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. The aim of our study was to evaluate heart rate recovery in patients with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). The study population included 38 patients with FMF (14 men; mean age, 36.2 ± 12.1 years, and mean disease duration = 11.3 ± 6.5 years) and 35 healthy control subjects (12 men; mean age = 34.1 ± 9.9 years). Basal electrocardiography, echocardiography, and treadmill exercise testing were performed in all patients and control participants. The heart rate recovery index was defined as the reduction in the heart rate from the rate at peak exercise to the rate 1st-minute (HRR(1)), 2nd-minute (HRR(2)), 3rd-minute (HRR(3)), and 5th-minute (HRR(5)) after the cessation of exercise stress testing. There are significant differences in HRR(1) and HRR(2) indices between patients with FMF and control group (26.4 ± 7.4 vs. 35.0 ± 8.0; P = 0.001 and 47.3 ± 11.8 vs. 54.8 ± 10.3; P = 0.002, respectively). Similarly, HRR(3) and HRR(5) indices of the recovery period were lower in patients with FMF, when compared with indices in the control group (56.0 ± 14.0 vs. 63.7 ± 11.2; P = 0.01 and 64.1 ± 14.7 vs. 71.5 ± 12.7; P = 0.02, respectively). There were also remarkably positive correlations between the disease duration and HRR(1) (r = 0.31, P = 0.02), and HRR(2) (r = 0.26, P = 0.04). The heart rate recovery index impaired in patients with FMF compared to control subjects. When the prognostic significance of the heart rate recovery index is considered, a useful, simple, and noninvasive test may be clinically helpful in the recognition of high-risk patients with FMF.
Sarcoidosis, an inflammatory granulomatous disease, is associated with various cardiac disorders, including threatening ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Heart rate recovery (HRR) after exercise is a function of vagal reactivation, and its impairment is an independent prognostic indicator for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. The aim of our study was to evaluate HRR in patients with sarcoidosis.
The study population included 56 patients with sarcoidosis (23 men, mean age = 47.3 ± 13.0 years, and mean disease duration = 38.4 ± 9.7 months) and 54 healthy control subjects (20 men, mean age = 46.5 ± 12.9 years). Basal ECG, echocardiography, and treadmill exercise testing were performed on all patients and control participants. The HRR index was defined as the reduction in the heart rate at peak exercise to the first-minute rate (HRR(1)), second-minute (HRR(2)), third-minute (HRR(3)), and fifth-minute (HRR(5)) after the cessation of exercise stress testing.
There are significant differences in HRR(1) and HRR(2) indices between patients with sarcoidosis and the control group (25 ± 6 vs 34 ± 11; P &lt; .001 and 45 ± 10 vs 53 ± 12; P &lt; .001, respectively). Similarly, HRR(3) and HRR(5) indices of the recovery period were lower in patients with sarcoidosis when compared with indices in the control group (53 ± 12 vs 61 ± 13; P &lt; .001 and 60 ± 13 vs 68 ± 13; P &lt; .001, respectively). Exercise capacity was notably lower (9.2 ± 2.1 vs 11.6 ± 2.8 METs; P = .001, respectively) and systolic pulmonary arterial pressure at rest was significantly higher in patients with sarcoidosis compared with the control group (29.7 ± 5.5 mm Hg vs 25.6 ± 5.7 mm Hg, P = .001, respectively). Furthermore, HRR indices were found to be different among radiographic stage groups.
The HRR index was impaired in patients with sarcoidosis as compared with control subjects. When the prognostic significance of the HRR index is considered, these results may partially explain the increased occurrence of arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in patients with sarcoidosis. Our findings suggest that the HRR index may be clinically helpful in identifying high-risk patients with sarcoidosis.
To assess the risk of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in children born after assisted conception compared with children born after natural conception.
Population-based follow-up study.
All children born alive in Denmark 1995-2003.
588,967 children born in Denmark from January 1995 to December 2003. Assisted conception was defined as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection and ovulation induction (OI) with or without subsequent insemination. Children exposed to IVF or OI were identified in the IVF Register and in the Danish Drug Prescription Register.
A diagnosis of ASD in the Danish Psychiatric Central Register.
33,139 (5.6%) of all children born in Denmark in 1995-2003 resulted from assisted conception, 225 of whom (0.68%) had a diagnosis of ASD. Of the 555,828 children born in this period after natural conception, 3394 (0.61%) had a diagnosis of ASD. The follow-up time was 4-13 years (median 9 years). In crude analyses, children born after assisted conception had an increased risk of a diagnosis of ASD: crude hazard rate ratio (HRR) 1.25 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.43). In analyses adjusting for maternal age, educational level, parity, smoking, birth weight and multiplicity, the risk disappeared: adjusted HRR 1.13. (95% CI 0.97 to 1.31). However, subgroup analyses that suggest possible associations in women who received follicle stimulating hormone indicate the need for further study.
This population-based follow-up study found no risk of ASD in children born after assisted conception.
This paper assesses the risk of cerebral palsy (CP) in children born after assisted conception compared with children born after natural conception (NC).
This population based follow-up study included all 588,967 children born in Denmark from 1995 to 2003. Assisted conception was defined as IVF, with or without ICSI, and ovulation induction (OI), with or without subsequent insemination.
There were 33 139 (5.6%) children born in Denmark from 1995 to 2003 as a result of assisted conception and through to June 2009, 1146 (0.19%) children received a CP diagnosis. Children born after assisted conception had an increased risk of a CP diagnosis, crude hazard rate ratio (HRR) 1.90 (95% CI: 1.57-2.31) compared with NC children. Divided into IVF and OI children compared with NC children, the risk was HRR 2.34 (95% CI: 1.81-3.01) and HRR 1.55 (95% CI: 1.17-2.06), respectively. When we included the intermediate factors multiplicity and gestational age in multivariate models, the risk of CP in assisted conception disappeared. In general, children with CP born after assisted conception had similar CP subtypes and co-morbidities as children with CP born after NC.
The risk of CP is increased after both IVF and OI. The increased risk of CP in children born after assisted conception, and in particular IVF, is strongly associated with the high proportion of multiplicity and preterm delivery in these pregnancies. A more widespread use of single embryo transfer warrants consideration to enhance the long-term health of children born after IVF.
Although studies of the accuracy of heart failure (HF) classification scoring systems are available, few have examined their performance when restricted to self-reported items.
We evaluated the association between a simplified version of the Gothenburg score, a validated HF score comprised of cardiac and pulmonary signs and symptoms and medication use, and incident HF hospitalizations in 15,430 Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study participants. Gothenburg scores (range: 0-3) were constructed using self-reported items obtained at study baseline (1987-89). Incident HF hospitalization over 14.7 years of follow-up was defined as the first identified hospitalization with an ICD-9 discharge code of 428 (n = 1,668). Self-reported Gothenburg scores demonstrated very high agreement with the original metric comprised of self-reported and clinical measures and were directly associated with incident HF hospitalizations: [score = 1: hazard rate ratio (HRR) = 1.23 (1.07-1.42); score = 2: HRR = 2.17 (1.92-2.43); score = 3: HRR = 3.98 (3.37-4.70)].
In a population-based cohort, self-reported Gothenburg criteria items were associated with hospitalized HF over a prolonged follow-up time. The association was also consistent across groups defined by sex and race, suggesting that this simple score deserves further study as a screening tool for the identification of individuals at high risk of HF in resource-limited settings.
Previous research has demonstrated the prognostic value of echocardiography with tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) in the heart failure (HF) population. Heart rate recovery (HRR) has also recently shown promise as a prognostic marker.
We hypothesize echocardiography with TDI and HRR will be significantly correlated and both will provide prognostic information.
A total of 243 subjects underwent echocardiography with TDI and maximal exercise testing to determine: (1) the ratio between mitral early (E) to mitral annular (E') and E to mitral late (A) velocity; (2) left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); (3) left ventricular (LV) mass; (4) LV end-systolic volume (LVESV); and (5) HRR at 1 minute postexercise (HRR(1)).
HRR(1) was significantly correlated with LVEF (r = 0.14, P = .03), LV mass (r = - 0.30, P &lt;.001), E/A (r = - 0.22, P = .001), and E/E' (r = - 0.49, P &lt;.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed HRR(1) was the strongest predictor of cardiac mortality (chi(2): 55.5, P &lt;.001); LV mass (residual chi(2): 13.1, P &lt;.001), E/E' (residual chi(2): 11.2, P = .001), and LVESV (residual chi(2): 5.9, P = .015) all added significant prognostic value and were retained in the regression while LVEF was removed (residual chi(2): 0.008, P = .93).
To our knowledge, this is the first investigation demonstrating an association between HRR and variables obtained from echocardiography with TDI in subjects with HF. The combination of both assessment techniques provides improved prognostic discrimination.
In 2007, the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) performed a genome-wide association study in 2,000 British coronary heart disease (CHD) cases and 3,000 controls after genotyping 469,557 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Seven variants associated with CHD were initially identified, and 5 SNPs were later found in replication studies. In the current study, the authors aimed to determine whether the 12 SNPs reported by the WTCCC predicted incident CHD through 2004 in a biracial, prospective cohort study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) comprising 15,792 persons aged 45-64 years who had been selected by probability sampling from 4 different US communities in 1987-1989. Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment for age and gender were used to estimate CHD hazard rate ratios (HRRs) over a 17-year period (1,362 cases in whites and 397 cases in African Americans) under an additive genetic model. The results showed that 3 SNPs in whites (rs599839, rs1333049, and rs501120; HRRs were 1.10 (P = 0.044), 1.14 (P &lt; 0.001), and 1.14 (P = 0.030), respectively) and 1 SNP in African Americans (rs7250581; HRR = 1.60, P = 0.05) were significantly associated with incident CHD. This study demonstrates that genetic variants revealed in a case-control genome-wide association study enriched for early disease onset may play a role in the genetic etiology of CHD in the general population.
Chronotropic response to exercise (CR) and heart rate recovery (HRR) immediately after exercise are indirect indices of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, respectively. The aim of this study was to evaluate CR and HRR in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in relation to disease severity.
Ten PAH patients (6 females/4 males, mean age: 48+/-12 years) and 10 control subjects matched for age, gender, and body mass index (6 females/4 males, mean age: 46+/-6 years) performed a ramp incremental symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise test on a cycle ergometer. Main measurements included heart rate at rest (HR), CR=[(peak HR-resting HR/220-age-resting HR)x100, %], HRR(1)=HR difference from peak exercise to 1minute after, ventilatory efficiency during exercise (VE/VCO(2) slope), peak oxygen uptake (VO(2)p), and the first-degree slope of VO(2) for the first minute of the recovery period (VO(2)/t-slope). PAH patients had a significantly decreased CR (58+/-31 vs 92+/-13, %, P &lt; .001) and HRR(1) (10+/-5 vs 29+/-6, beats/min, P &lt; .001) as well as VO(2)p (11.9+/-3.5 vs 26.9+/-6.6, mL.kg.min) and VO(2)/t-slope (0.2+/-0.1 vs. 0.9+/-0.2, mL.kg.min(2)) compared with controls. CR and HRR(1) correlated well with VO(2)p (r=0.7; P &lt; .001 and r=0.85; P &lt; .001, respectively) and VO(2)/t-slope (r=0.66; P &lt; .001 and r=0.85; P &lt; .001, respectively) and had a significant inverse correlation with VE/VCO(2) slope (r=-0.47; P &lt; .01 and r=-0.77; P &lt; .001, respectively).
PAH patients present a significant impairment of CR and HRR(1) in relation to disease severity, indicating profound autonomic nervous system abnormalities.
Heart rate recovery (HRR) is an established prognostic predictor. However, a number of methodological issues have not been fully explored, including differences in HRR 1 versus 2 min after exercise termination, absolute versus relative HRR, and the impact of beta-blockers.
Cross-sectional study.
Predictors of impaired absolute and relative HRR 1 (HRR-1, HRR-1%) and 2 min after exercise termination (HRR-2, HRR-2%), defined as their lowest quartiles, were assessed in 1667 patients undergoing cycle exercise myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography, and measures of HRR were compared between patients undergoing myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography with continued, discontinued, and without beta-blockers.
Higher resting heart rate was an independent predictor of all measures of impaired HRR (P&lt;0.001 for all). Lower peak heart rate was independently associated with impaired HRR-1, HRR-2, and HRR-2% (P&lt;0.001 for all) but not HRR-1%. Higher summed rest score as a marker of scar and in part left ventricular dysfunction was an independent predictor of impaired HRR-1 (P = 0.010) and HRR-1% (P = 0.025) but not HRR-2 and HRR-2%, whereas lower stroke volume index was an independent predictor of slow HRR-2 (P = 0.004) and HRR-2% (P = 0.02) but not HRR-1 and HRR-1%. HRR-1 (P = 0.98) and HRR-2 (P = 0.86) were similar in patients with continued, discontinued, and without beta-blocker therapy. In contrast, HRR-1% (P = 0.01) and HRR-2% (P = 0.001) were faster in patients on beta-blockers than in the other groups.
HRR-1 and HRR-2 as well as HRR-1% and HRR-2% reflect different pathophysiological processes. Relative but not absolute measures of HRR seem to be enhanced under beta-blockers.
Young patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) display an attenuated heart rate recovery (HRR) during the first minute (HRR-1) and the first 2 min (HRR-2) postexercise. We sought to compare determinants of HRR-1 and HRR-2 in OSAS and to assess whether these associations depend on age.
Exercise testing with measurements of HRR-1 and HRR-2 was performed in 54 patients with untreated OSAS (median [interquartile range] apnea-hypopnea index 27.5 [12.0-42.4] h(-1), desaturation index [DSI] 10.6 [5.1-25.0] h(-1)).
Overall, higher DSI (P &lt; .001) and higher total cholesterol ([TC] P = .02) were independent predictors of lower HRR-1, whereas lower peak heart rate (P &lt; .001), higher resting heart rate (P = .006), and higher DSI (P = .01) were independently associated with lower HRR-2. In the below-median age group (age &lt;or= 48 years; n = 27), higher DSI (P = .002) was the only independent predictor of lower HRR-1, and lower peak heart rate (P &lt; .001) and higher DSI (P = .003) were independently associated with lower HRR-2. In contrast, in the above-median age group (age &gt; 48 years; n = 27) higher TC (P = .006), higher insulin resistance (P = .009), and higher resting heart rate (P = .048) were independently associated with lower HRR-1, and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (P = .001), higher resting heart rate (P = .002), higher TC (P = .005), and lower peak heart rate (P = .01) were independently associated with HRR-2.
Assessment of HRR-2 provides additional information on different aspects of OSAS compared with HRR-1. Markers of OSAS severity, such as DSI, are independently associated with HRR in younger patients only, whereas in older patients, HRR reflects OSAS-related metabolic and renal dysfunction.
Psychological distress, poor disease-specific quality of life (QoL), and reduction in vagally mediated early heart rate recovery (HRR) after exercise, all previously predicted morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). We hypothesized lower HRR with greater psychological distress and poorer QoL in CHF.
All assessments were made at the beginning of a comprehensive cardiac outpatient rehabilitation intervention program.
Fifty-six CHF patients (mean 58+/-12 years, 84% men) completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire. HRR was determined as the difference between HR at the end of exercise and 1 min after exercise termination (HRR-1).
Elevated levels of anxiety symptoms (P=0.005) as well as decreased levels of the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire total (P = 0.025), physical (P=0.026), and emotional (P=0.017) QoL were independently associated with blunted HRR-1. Anxiety, total, physical, and emotional QoL explained 11.4, 8, 7.8, and 9.0%, respectively, of the variance after controlling for covariates. Depressed mood was not associated with HRR-1 (P=0.20).
Increased psychological distress with regard to elevated anxiety symptoms and impaired QoL were independent correlates of reduced HRR-1 in patients with CHF. Reduced vagal tone might explain part of the adverse clinical outcome previously observed in CHF patients in relation to psychological distress and poor disease-specific QoL.
Asthma and COPD are major health problems and an extensive burden for the patient and the health care system. Patient education has been recommended, but the influence on knowledge and health outcomes is not fully examined. Our aims were to compare patient characteristics, education and knowledge in patients who had an emergency room (ER) visit, to explore factors related to disease knowledge, and to investigate patient characteristics, patient education and knowledge in relation to further ER visits over a 12 month period.
Eighty-four patients with asthma and 52 with COPD, who had had an ER visit, were included. They were interviewed by telephone 4 to 6 weeks after the ER visit and followed for a year.
Patients with COPD were older, more sedentary, had had more ER visits the previous year, and had more co morbidity than patients with asthma. About 80% of the patients had received information from health professionals or participated in education/rehabilitation, but a minority (&lt; 20%) reported that their knowledge about how to handle the disease was good. Patients with "good knowledge" were younger, were more likely to have asthma diagnose, and had a higher educational background (p &lt; 0.05). Sixty-seven percent of the patients with COPD had repeated ER visits during the following year versus 42% in asthma (p &lt; 0.05) (adjusted HRR: 1.73 (1.03-2.90)). Patients who had had ER visits the year before inclusion had a higher risk of ER visits the following year (adjusted HRR: 3.83 (1.99-7.38)). There were no significant differences regarding patient education and knowledge between the group with and without further ER visits after adjusting for sex, diagnose, age, and educational background.
Patients with asthma had a better self reported knowledge of disease management and were less likely to have new exacerbations than patients with COPD. Reported level of knowledge was, however, in it self not a predictor of exacerbations. This indicates that information is not sufficient to reduce the burden of disease. Patient education focused on self-management and behavioral change should be emphasized.
High levels of microsatellite instability (MSI-H) have been associated in many studies with improved prognosis in colon cancer. Very few studies have evaluated the effect of MSI-H on rectal cancer survival. We assessed MSI-H and other genetic and epigenetic changes on survival of 990 individuals diagnosed with first primary rectal cancer.
MSI was assessed primarily by instability in the mononucleotide repeat BAT-26. The BRAF V600E mutation was assessed by TaqMan assay. The CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) was determined by methylation-specific PCR of CpG islands in MLH1, methylated in tumors (MINT)1, (MINT)2, (MINT)31 and CDKN2A. KRAS2 codons 12 and 13 mutations, and TP53 mutations in exons 5-8 were determined by sequencing.
Multivariate analysis revealed that MSI-H (HRR 2.47, 95% CI 1.13-5.40) and KRAS2 mutations (HRR 1.37, 95% CI 1.04-1.81) were associated with a significantly higher risk of dying of rectal cancer. Only one of 22 MSI-H tumors showed a BRAF V600E mutation. Of 15 MSI-H rectal cancers evaluated for methylation, two exhibited MLH1 methylation and four exhibited CIMP.
The genetic and epigenetic characteristics of MSI-H rectal cancers suggest that they are enriched for Lynch-associated tumors; adverse prognosis associated with MSI-H in these tumors may reflect the relatively high frequency of Lynch-associated cancers and/or the effect of radiation or chemotherapy on Lynch-associated rectal cancers or MSI tumors in general.
Heart rate recovery (HRR) is an important indicator of cardiovascular health. The purpose of the present investigation is to examine the influence of sex on the relationship between HRR and other markers of cardiovascular health. Two hundred and seventy-five apparently healthy subjects participated in this study. Subjects underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing (outcome measures: VO(2max) and HRR 1 and 2 min into recovery), lipid analysis, measurement of resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure and measurement of aortic wave velocity (AWV in m/s) via magnetic resonance. HRR both at 1 min (HRR(1)) and at 2 min (HRR(2)) were higher in males. In general, the correlation between HRR(1) and other measures of interest was weaker than that found with HRR(2) in both male and female subjects. With respect to HRR(2), the relationship with other measures of interest was stronger in the female subgroup. Specific to arterial stiffness, the correlation between HRR(2) and AWV was -0.33 and -0.46 (P&lt;0.001 for both) in male and female subgroups, respectively. The results of the present study indicate that both gender and the timing of HRR measurement influence its relationship with other important cardiovascular risk factors.
To determine the association between expectations to return to work and self-assessed recovery. Positive expectations predict better outcomes in many health conditions, but to date the relationship between expecting to return to work after traffic-related whiplash-associated disorders and actual recovery has not been reported. We assessed early expectations for return to work in a cohort of 2,335 individuals with traffic-related whiplash injury to the neck. Using multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis we assessed the association between return to work expectations and self-perceived recovery during the first year following the event. After adjusting for the effects of sociodemographic characteristics, initial pain and symptoms, post-crash mood, prior health status and collision-related factors, those who expected to return to work reported global recovery 42% more quickly than those who did not have positive expectations (HRR = 1.42, 95% CI 1.26-1.60). Knowledge of return to work expectation provides an important prognostic tool to clinicians for recovery.
Vital exhaustion and type D personality previously predicted mortality and cardiac events in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). Reduced heart rate recovery (HRR) also predicts morbidity and mortality in CHF. We hypothesized that elevated levels of vital exhaustion and type D personality are both associated with decreased HRR.
Fifty-one patients with CHF (mean age 58+/-12 years, 82% men) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; or = 40% underwent standard exercise testing before receiving outpatient cardiac rehabilitation. They completed the 9-item short form of the Maastricht Vital Exhaustion Questionnaire and the 14-item type D questionnaire asking about negative affectivity and social inhibition. HRR was calculated as the difference between heart rate at the end of exercise and 1 min after abrupt cessation of exercise (HRR-1). Regression analyses were adjusted for gender, age, LVEF, and maximum exercise capacity.
Vital exhaustion explained 8.4% of the variance in continuous HRR-1 (p=0.045). For each point increase on the vital exhaustion score (range 0-18) there was a mean+/-SEM decrease of 0.54+/-0.26 bpm in HRR-1. Type D personality showed a trend toward statistical significance for being associated with lower levels of HRR-1 explaining 6.5% of the variance (p&lt;0.08). The likelihood of having HRR-1 &lt; or = 18 bpm was significantly higher in patients with type D personality than in those without (odds ratio=7.62, 95% CI 1.50-38.80).
Elevated levels of vital exhaustion and type D personality were both independently associated with reduced HRR-1. The findings provide a hitherto not explored psychobiological explanation for poor cardiac outcome in patients with CHF.
To investigate the association of the 482G/A polymorphism of the PGC-1alpha gene with type 2 diabetes by family-based study in the Han population in South China, and to analyze the quantitative and qualitative binding force changes between the PGC-1alpha domain mutant and MEF2C, as well as to evaluate the possibility of PGC-1alpha -MEF2C-GLUT4 pathway in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.
Blood samples were collected from 350 patients with type 2 diabetes and their first-degree relatives. Genomic DNA was extracted and polymorphic PGC-1alpha genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and direct DNA sequencing. The results were analyzed by family-based transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) and haplotype relative risk (HRR). The protein-protein interaction between PGC-1alpha and MEF2C was detected by means of the site-directed mutagenesis kit and bacteriomatch two-hybrid system kit.
In the family-based study, HRR analyses demonstrated that the 482A allele was more often transmitted to patients than predicted by chance (chi (2)= 7.2170, P= 0.0072, HRR= 1.4496). TDT-extended test(ETDT) analyses also revealed that PGC-1alpha 482A allele was significantly deviated from 0.5 from heterozygous parents to patients than expected (219 trios, P= 0.0310; 350 trios, P= 0.0292). BacterioMatch Two-Hybrid System showed that 482A variation could lead to decreased binding force between PGC-1alpha and MEF2C (62.1+/- 8.97, P&lt; 0.05).
The 482A polymorphism increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetic mellitus in the South China Han population, which might be mediated by the PGC-1alpha -MEF2C-GLUT4 pathway.
Among the numerous studies concerning contrast media-induced nephropathy (CIN), there was no prospective trial that provided data on the long-term outcomes.
To prospectively assess predictors of CIN and long-term outcomes of affected patients.
Four hundred twelve consecutive patients with serum creatinine levels of 115 micromol/L to 309 micromol/L (1.3 mg/dL to 3.5 mg/dL) undergoing elective coronary angiography were included. Patients were randomly assigned to periprocedural hydration alone, hydration plus one-time hemodialysis or hydration plus N-acetylcysteine.
Multivariate logistic regression identified the following as predictors of CIN within 72 h (equivalent to an increase in creatinine 44.2 micromol/L [0.5 mg/dL] or more) : prophylactic postprocedural hemodialysis (OR 2.86, 95% CI 1.07 to 7.69), use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (OR 6.16, 95% CI 2.01 to 18.93), baseline glomerular filtration rate (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.98) and the amount of contrast media given (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.01). With regard to long-term outcome (mean follow-up 649 days), multivariate Cox regression models found elevated creatinine levels at 30 days (hazard rate ratio [HRR] 5.48, 95% CI 2.85 to 10.53), but not CIN within 72 h (HRR 1.12, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.02), to be associated with increased mortality. In addition, independent predictors for death during follow-up included left ventricular ejection fraction lower than 35% (HRR 4.01, 95% CI 2.22 to 7.26), serum phosphate (HRR 1.64, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.43) and hemoglobin (HRR 0.80, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.96).
From the present prospective trial, performance of postprocedural hemodialysis, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, reduced baseline glomerular filtration rate and amount of contrast media were independent predictors of CIN within 72 h after catheterization. Assessing renal function after 30 days, rather than within 72 h, seemed to be more predictive for patients' long-term survival.
Heart rate recovery 1 min after exercise termination (HRR-1) is a prognostic predictor. However, the influence of the exercise mode on HRR-1 is incompletely characterised. Twenty-nine young and healthy subjects and 16 elderly patients with chronic heart failure underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing using cycle ergometer and treadmill ramp protocols in random order. HRR-1 and heart rate recovery 2 and 3 min after exercise (HRR-2, HRR-3) during active recovery and peak oxygen consumption (peak VO(2)) were measured. In both healthy subjects (32 +/- 14 vs. 27 +/- 10 bpm) and HF patients (19 +/- 8 vs. 14 +/- 9 bpm), HRR-1 was faster after cycle exercise (p = 0.029; p for between group difference 0.94). In contrast, HRR-2 and HRR-3 were similar after both tests in both groups. Peak VO(2) was lower during cycle as compared to treadmill exercise in both groups. In conclusion, in both healthy subjects and HF patients, HRR-1 depends on the mode of exercise as peak VO(2) does.
A priority in preventive cardiology is to reduce the number of recurrent events and to prolong survival in patients with established coronary heart disease (CHD). Aim of the present study was to examine risk factors for long-term mortality in CHD patients who entered routine secondary prevention after a coronary event or intervention. Such patients, from the EUROASPIRE (EUROpean Action on Secondary Prevention through Intervention to Reduce Events) I and II studies in the region of Münster, Germany, were followed over a mean period of 8.0 years up to the end of 2005. Patients were up to 70 years of age at baseline when they were interviewed and examined using standardised methods. Baseline examination was carried out at least 6 months and at a mean of 19.5 months after the coronary event or procedure. In 367 patients from EUROASPIRE I and 380 patients from EUROASPIRE II, a total of 125 deaths (16.7%) occurred during follow-up. Multivariate analyses, using Cox proportional hazards models, established diabetes mellitus and smoking as predictors for all-cause mortality with estimated hazard rate ratios (HRRs) of 2.24 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.43-3.49) and 1.95 (95% CI: 1.23-3.10), respectively. Significant associations were found between diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular (HRR 2.36; 95% CI: 1.31-4.24) as well as CHD mortality (HRR 2.40; 95% CI: 1.25-4.59). Systolic blood pressure was significantly associated with increased cerebrovascular disease mortality (HRR 1.04; 95% CI: 1.01 and 1.08 for 1 mmHg increase). In conclusion, long-term mortality in coronary patients from routine secondary prevention is substantial. Diabetes mellitus and smoking represent key issues in patients with established CHD.
The heart rate increase during exercise (DeltaHR) and heart rate recovery (HRR) have demonstrated prognostic value in several investigations, but its application in the heart failure (HF) population is limited, particularly in a beta-blocked (BB) cohort.
Five-hundred and twenty subjects with HF underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing to determine peak oxygen consumption (VO(2)), the minute ventilation/carbon dioxide production (VE/VCO(2)) slope, DeltaHR and HRR at 1 min (HRR(1)).
There were 79 cardiac-related deaths during the tracking period. A HRR(1) threshold of &lt;/&gt;or=16 beats/min was a significant prognostic marker in the overall group (hazard ratio: 4.6, 95% CI: 2.8-7.5, p&lt;0.001) as well as no-BB (hazard ratio: 9.1, 95% CI: 4.1-20.2, p&lt;0.001) and BB (hazard ratio: 2.9, 95% CI: 1.6-5.4, p&lt;0.001) subgroups. The DeltaHR was a significant univariate predictor in the overall group and no-BB subgroup only. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed HRR(1) was the strongest prognostic marker (chi-square: 39.9, p&lt;0.001). The VE/VCO(2) slope (residual chi-square: 21.8, p&lt;0.001) and LVEF (residual chi-square: 9.6, p=0.002) were also retained in the regression.
These results indicate that HRR maintains prognostic value in HF irrespective of BB use. The routine inclusion of HRR in the prognostic assessment of patients with HF may be warranted.
Some studies have reported that delayed heart rate recovery (HRR) after exercise is associated with incident type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study aimed to investigate the longitudinal association of delayed HRR following a graded exercise treadmill test (GTX) with the development of T2DM including glucose-associated parameters as an adjusting factor in healthy Korean men.
Analyses including fasting plasma glucose, HOMA-IR, HOMA-β, and HbA1c as confounding factors and known confounders were performed. HRR was calculated as peak heart rate minus heart rate after a 1-min rest (HRR 1). Cox proportional hazards model was used to quantify the independent association between HRR and incident T2DM.
During 9082 person-years of follow-up between 2006 and 2012, there were 180 (10.1%) incident cases of T2DM. After adjustment for age, BMI, systolic BP, diastolic BP, smoking status, peak heart rate, peak oxygen uptake, TG, LDL-C, HDL-C, fasting plasma glucose, HOMA-IR, HOMA-β, and HbA1c, the hazard ratios (HRs) [95% confidence interval (CI)] of incident T2DM comparing the second and third tertiles to the first tertile of HRR 1 were 0.867 (0.609-1.235) and 0.624 (0.426-0.915), respectively (p for trend=0.017). As a continuous variable, in the fully-adjusted model, the HR (95% CI) of incident T2DM associated with each 1 beat increase in HRR 1 was 0.980 (0.960-1.000) (p=0.048).
This study demonstrated that delayed HRR after exercise predicts incident T2DM in men, even after adjusting for fasting glucose, HOMA-IR, HOMA-β, and HbA1c. However, only HRR 1 had clinical significance.
Work disability following motor vehicle related orthopaedic trauma is a significant contributor to the burden of injury and disease. Early identification of predictors for return to work (RTW) is essential for developing effective interventions to prevent work disability. The study aim was to determine the predictors (including compensation related factors) of time to RTW following motor vehicle related orthopaedic trauma.
Admitted patients were recruited prospectively from two trauma hospitals with upper and/or lower extremity fractures following a motor vehicle crash. Baseline and follow up data were collected by written questionnaire. For baseline, this occurred in person within 2 weeks of injury. For follow up, this occurred by mail at six, 12 and 24 months. Additional demographic and injury-related information was retrieved from hospital databases. Analysis involved: descriptive statistics; logrank test to detect survival distributions of categorical variables; and Cox proportional hazards regression models for risks of time to RTW using baseline characteristic and compensation related variables (at 6 months).
Of 452 study participants 334 (74%) were working pre-injury: results are based on this subset. Baseline characteristics were mean age 36 years (13.9 Standard Deviation [SD]), 80% male; 72% self-assessed very good-excellent pre-injury health, 83% household income &gt; AU$40,000 (Australian Dollar). Follow up data was available for 233 (70%), 210 (63%), and 182 (54%) participants at six, 12 and 24 months respectively. Significant risks of a longer time to RTW were greater injury severity, as measured by the New Injury Severity Score (NISS) (Hazards Rate Ratio [HRR] = 0.54, 95% CI 0.35-0.82); and lower occupational skill levels (HRR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.34-0.83). Significant risks of a shorter time to RTW were: recovery expectations for usual activities within 90 days (HRR = 2.10, 95% CI 1.49-2.95); full-time pre-injury work hours (HRR = 1.99, 95% CI 1.26-3.14); and very good self-assessed pre-injury health status (HRR = 1.41, 95% CI 0.98-2.02). Legal representation (analysed at six months only) was not associated with time to RTW. At each time period, there were 146 (63%), 149 (71%), and 137 (76%) working participants.
A longer time to RTW was associated with greater injury severity and lower occupational skill levels; while a shorter time to RTW was associated with recovery expectations for usual activities within 90 days, full-time pre-injury work hours, and very good self-assessed pre-injury health status. Our findings reinforce existing research. There is an opportunity to trial interventions that address potentially modifiable factors. The issues surrounding legal representation are complex and require further research.
The heart rate response (HRR, percentage change from baseline) to regadenoson during myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) can provide incremental prognostic value in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease. Our purpose was to evaluate the variability and prognostic value of HRR on serial measurements.
We studied 648 consecutive patients (61 ± 11 years, 48 % with diabetes) who underwent two regadenoson MPI studies (16 ± 9 months between studies). HRR &lt;30 % was defined as abnormal. All-cause mortality was determined by chart review and verified using the US Social Security Death Master File.
HRR was well correlated between the two studies (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.72, 95 % CI 0.67 - 0.76) with no systematic bias (mean difference 0.88 %, p = 0.2) or proportional bias (p = 0.5) by Bland-Altman analysis in all patients and in those with normal MPI on both studies. Of the 308 patients (48 %) with normal baseline HRR (HRR-1), 33 % had developed a blunted HRR on the second MPI study (HRR-2). Older age, male gender, end-stage renal disease, and abnormal baseline left ventricular ejection fraction were independent predictors of a new-onset abnormal HRR. During a mean follow-up of 2.4 ± 1.2 years, 55 patients (8.5 %) died. Patients with a blunted HRR-1 had increased mortality risk irrespective of their HRR-2 (p = 0.9, log-rank test). Among patients with normal HRR-1, a blunted HRR-2 was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality beyond clinical and traditional MPI data (hazard ratio 2.83, 95 % CI 1.14 - 7.03). Finally, patients with a normal HRR-1 and HRR-2 had the lowest event rate, while those with any abnormal HRR had an increased risk of death (hazard ratio 2.5, 95 % CI 1.2 - 5.4).
There was good correlation in the HRR to regadenoson on serial measurements without systematic or proportional biases. Patients with consistently normal HRR had the best prognosis.
Clinical trials have indicated antipsychotic effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) among incident patients with schizophrenia. We aimed to study, in a population-based setting, whether concomitant use of NSAIDs or paracetamol, changed 2-year relapse risk for schizophrenia.
We identified all incident patients with schizophrenia in Denmark diagnosed 1996-2012 initiating antipsychotic treatment within the year after diagnosis. We calculated concomitant treatment intervals for antipsychotic and NSAID or paracetamol use. Hazard rate ratios (HRR) were estimated using Cox regression adjusted for important covariates.
2-year relapse, i.e. (re)-hospitalizations with schizophrenia.
Among 16,235 incident patients with schizophrenia using antipsychotics, 1480 (9.1%) used NSAIDs and 767 (4.7%) paracetamol. Concomitant use of NSAIDs was associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia relapse (HRR = 1.21; 95%-CI = 1.11-1.31), particularly associated with acetylsalicylic acid and diclofenac. Concomitant use of paracetamol was not associated with schizophrenia relapse (HRR = 0.97; 95%-CI = 0.87-1.08). Subgroup analyses showed that individuals with somatic comorbidity and NSAID use had an increased relapse-risk, except for individuals with a prior hospital diagnosis for musculoskeletal disease and NSAID use who had a decreased relapse-risk (HRR = 0.82; 95%-CI = 0.71-0.94).
The increased relapse risk associated with concomitant NSAID use among incident patients with schizophrenia may indicate a potential impact of underlying somatic comorbidity.
Several studies have reported conflicting effects of sex on HIV-1 infection. We describe differences in baseline characteristics and assess the impact of sex on HIV progression among patients at a clinic with many HIV-2 and HIV-1/2 dually infected patients.
This study utilised a retrospective cohort of treatment-naïve adults at the largest HIV clinic in Guinea-Bissau from 6 June 2005 to 1 December 2013. Baseline characteristics were assessed and the patients followed until death, transfer, loss to follow-up, or 1 June 2014. We estimated the time from the first clinic visit until initiation of ART, death or loss to follow-up using Cox proportional hazard models.
A total of 5694 patients were included in the study, 3702 women (65%) and 1992 men (35%). Women were more likely than men to be infected with HIV-2 (19% vs. 15%, P &lt; 0.01) or dually infected with HIV-1/2 (11% vs. 9%, P = 0.02). For all HIV types, women were younger (median 35 vs. 40 years), less likely to have schooling (55% vs. 77%) or to be married (46% vs. 67%), and had higher baseline CD4 cell counts (median 214 vs. 178 cells/μl). Men had a higher age-adjusted mortality rate (hazard rate ratio (HRR) 1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-1.52) and were more often lost to follow-up (HRR 1.27, 95% CI 1.17-1.39).
Significant differences exist between HIV-infected men and women regardless of HIV type. Men seek treatment at a later stage and, despite better socio-economic status, have higher mortality and loss to follow-up than women.
It remains unknown whether care of high-risk vascular patients with both diabetes and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is improving. We examined national trends in care of patients with both PAD and diabetes.
A cohort of patients diagnosed with PAD and diabetes between 2007 and 2011 undergoing open or endovascular diagnostic or revascularization procedures was analyzed using Medicare claims data. Main outcome measure was amputation-free survival measured from time of initial revascularization procedure to 24 months, stratified by race and hospital referral region (HRR).
From 2007 to 2011, 2.3 per 1,000 patients underwent a major amputation with the higher rate among black patients (5.5 per 1,000 vs. 1.9 per 1,000; P &lt; 0.001) compared with nonblack. The rate varied widely by HRR (1.2 per 1,000-6.2 per 1,000), with higher variation in amputation rates in black patients (2.1-16.1 per 1,000). Overall, amputation-free survival was approximately 74.6% at 2 years, 68.4% among black patients, and 75.4% among nonblack patients, with the disparity between the 2 groups increasing over time.
Prevalence of concurrent PAD and diabetes is increasing, but amputation rates and amputation-free survival vary significantly by both race and HRR. Prevention and care coordination effort should aim to limit racial disparities in the treatment and outcomes of these high-risk patients.
Prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRCLM) is estimated based on clinicopathological models. Stratifying patients based on tumor biology may have additional value.
Tissue micro-arrays (TMAs), containing resected CRCLM and corresponding primary tumors from a multi-institutional cohort of 507 patients, were immunohistochemically stained for 18 candidate biomarkers. Cross-validated hazard rate ratios (HRRs) for overall survival (OS) and the proportion of HRRs with opposite effect (P(HRR &lt; 1) or P(HRR &gt; 1)) were calculated. A classifier was constructed by classification and regression tree (CART) analysis and its prognostic value determined by permutation analysis. Correlations between protein expression in primary tumor-CRCLM pairs were calculated.
Based on their putative prognostic value, EGFR (P(HRR &lt; 1) = .02), AURKA (P(HRR &lt; 1) = .02), VEGFA (P(HRR &lt; 1) = .02), PTGS2 (P(HRR &lt; 1) = .01), SLC2A1 (P(HRR &gt; 1) &lt; 01), HIF1α (P(HRR &gt; 1) = .06), KCNQ1 (P(HRR &gt; 1) = .09), CEA (P (HRR &gt; 1) = .05) and MMP9 (P(HRR &lt; 1) = .07) were included in the CART analysis (n = 201). The resulting classifier was based on AURKA, PTGS2 and MMP9 expression and was associated with OS (HRR 2.79, p &lt; .001), also after multivariate analysis (HRR 3.57, p &lt; .001). The prognostic value of the biomarker-based classifier was superior to the clinicopathological model (p = .001). Prognostic value was highest for colon cancer patients (HRR 5.71, p &lt; .001) and patients not treated with systemic therapy (HRR 3.48, p &lt; .01). Classification based on protein expression in primary tumors could be based on AURKA expression only (HRR 2.59, p = .04).
A classifier was generated for patients with CRCLM with improved prognostic value compared to the standard clinicopathological prognostic parameters, which may aid selection of patients who may benefit from adjuvant systemic therapy.
Recently, a genome-wide association study has indicated associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms in the Collagen Type XXVII Alpha 1 gene (COL27A1) and Tourette syndrome in several ethnic populations. To clarify the global relevance of the previously identified SNPs in the development of Tourette syndrome, the associations between polymorphisms in COL27A1 and Tourette syndrome were assessed in Chinese trios. PCR-directed sequencing was used to evaluate the genetic contributions of three SNPs in COL27A1(rs4979356, rs4979357 and rs7868992) using haplotype relative risk (HRR) and transmission disequilibrium tests (TDT) with a total of 260 Tourette syndrome trios. The family-based association was significant between Tourette syndrome and rs4979356 (TDT: χ2 = 4.804, P = 0.033; HRR = 1.75, P = 0.002; HHRR = 1.32, P = 0.027), and transmission disequilibrium was suspected for rs4979357 (TDT: χ2 = 3.969, P = 0.053; HRR = 1.84, P = 0.001; HHRR = 1.29, P = 0.044). No statistically significant allele transfer was found for rs7868992 (TDT: χ2 = 2.177, P = 0.158). Although the TDT results did not remain significant after applying the conservative Bonferroni correction (p = 0.005), the significant positive HRR analysis confirmed the possibility of showing transmission disequilibrium, which provides evidence for an involvement of COL27A1in the development of TS. However, these results need to be verified with larger datasets from different populations.
To investigate the relevance of atrial fibrillation or flutter (AF) for outcome of patients who are hospitalized for peripheral artery disease (PAD) and/or critical limb ischemia (CLI).
We compared baseline data, co-morbidities, procedural data as well as in-hospital and long-term outcome of 41,882 patients who were hospitalized with PAD or CLI between 2009 and 2011 according to whether they did or did not have atrial fibrillation/flutter. Follow-up was available until December 2012. Of these, 5622 patients (13.4%) had AF. AF patients were significantly older (78±9 vs. 70±11years) and had significantly more comorbidities, such as diabetes (40.8 vs. 31.1%), chronic kidney disease (40.1 vs. 19.0%), coronary artery disease (38.0 vs. 23.0%) and chronic heart failure (26.9 vs. 7.2%, each p&lt;0.001). They had more advanced PAD as shown by higher Rutherford classes. In-hospital complications including acute renal failure, myocardial infarction, stroke sepsis and death occurred significantly more often (each p&lt;0.001). Duration of hospital stay was significantly longer and costs were markedly higher in patients with AF (each p&lt;0.001). Using multivariate Cox regression analyses regarding long-term outcomes, AF was an independent predictor for death (HRR 1.46; 95% CI 1.39-1.52, p&lt;0.001), ischemic stroke (HRR 1.63; 95% CI 1.44-1.85) and amputation (HRR 1.14; 95% CI 1.07-1.21).
Presence of AF in patients admitted for PAD and CLI is associated with worse in-hospital and long-term outcome than in patients without AF. This effect was independent of numerous other comorbidities and stage of vascular disease.
This population-based cohort study investigated the association between a lifetime history of a work-related low back injury, in those who had recovered to have no or mild low back pain, and the development of troublesome low back pain (LBP). A secondary analysis explored the possible effects of misclassification of the exposure by examining the association between a lifetime history of having taken time off work or performed light duties at work because of a work-related low back injury. Current evidence from cross-sectional studies suggests that individuals with a history of a work-related low back injury are more likely to experience future LBP. However, there is a need to examine this association prospectively in a large population-based cohort with adequate control of known confounders.
We formed a cohort of 810 randomly sampled Saskatchewan adults with no or mild LBP in September 1995. At baseline, participants were asked if they had ever injured their low back at work. The secondary analysis asked if they had ever had to take time off work or perform light duties at work because of a work-related low back injury. Prospective follow-up 6 and 12 months later, asked about the presence of troublesome LBP (grade II-IV) on the Chronic Pain Grade Questionnaire. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to estimate these associations while controlling for known confounders.
The proportion followed up at 6 and 12 months was 76 and 65%, respectively. We found an association between a history of work-related low back injury and the onset of troublesome LBP after controlling for gender (adjusted HRR = 2.24; 95% CI 1.41-3.56). When covariates that may also be mediators of the association were added to the model, the effect estimate was attenuated (adjusted HRR = 1.37; 95% CI 1.41-3.56). We found a similar association between a lifetime history of having taken time off work or had to work light duties at work because of a work-related low back injury, adjusted for gender (adjusted HRR = 2.31; 95% CI 1.39-3.85) which was also diluted by the further adjustment for covariates that may also be mediators of the association (adjusted HRR = 1.80; 95% CI 1.08-3.01).
Our study suggests that a history of work-related low back injury or taking time off work or having to perform light duties at work due to a work-related low back injury may be a risk factor for the development of troublesome LBP. Residual confounding may account for some of the observed associations, but this was less in the group who took time off work or had to work light duties due to a work-related low back injury.
Exercise intensity is arguably the most critical component of the exercise prescription model. It has been suggested that a threshold based model for establishing exercise intensity might better identify the lowest effective training stimulus for all individuals with varying fitness levels; however, experimental evidence is lacking. The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of two exercise training programs for improving cardiorespiratory fitness: threshold based model vs. relative percent concept (i.e., % heart rate reserve - HRR).
Apparently healthy, but sedentary men and women (n = 42) were randomized to a non-exercise control group or one of two exercise training groups. Exercise training was performed 30 min/day on 5 days/week for 12weeks according to one of two exercise intensity regimens: 1) a relative percent method was used in which intensity was prescribed according to percentages of heart rate reserve (HRR group), or 2) a threshold based method (ACE-3ZM) was used in which intensity was prescribed according to the first ventilatory threshold (VT1) and second ventilatory threshold (VT2).
Thirty-six men and women completed the study. After 12weeks, VO2max increased significantly (p &lt; 0.05 vs. controls) in both HRR (1.76 ± 1.93 mL/kg/min) and ACE-3ZM (3.93 ± 0.96 mL/kg/min) groups. Repeated measures ANOVA identified a significant interaction between exercise intensity method and change in VO2max values (F = 9.06, p &lt; 0.05) indicating that VO2max responded differently to the method of exercise intensity prescription. In the HRR group 41.7 % (5/12) of individuals experienced a favorable change in relative VO2max (Δ &gt; 5.9 %) and were categorized as responders. Alternatively, exercise training in the ACE-3ZM group elicited a positive improvement in relative VO2max (Δ &gt; 5.9 %) in 100 % (12/12) of the individuals.
A threshold based exercise intensity prescription: 1). elicited significantly (p &lt; 0.05) greater improvements in VO2max, and 2). attenuated the individual variation in VO2max training responses when compared to relative percent exercise training. These novel findings are encouraging and provide important preliminary data for the design of individualized exercise prescriptions that will enhance training efficacy and limit training unresponsiveness.
ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: ID NCT02351713 Registered 30 January 2015.
Clinical, neuroimaging and other studies provided evidence that the dysfunction of the serotonin neurotransmitter system were found in Tourette syndrome (TS). This study is to explore the association between the polymorphism of C861G (rs6296) in HTR1B and TS in Han Chinese people.
Two hundred ninety-nine TS patients (260 TS trios and 39 TS patients) and 388 healthy controls were collected. The genotype of HTR1B C861G was detected using Taqman probes. The case-control study and family-based study was used separately to study association between HTR1B C861G and TS in Han Chinese people.
In case-control study, no statistically significant difference was found in the distribution of HTR1B C861G polymorphism between TS patients and controls (for genotype: χ2  = 3.408, P = 0.182; for allele: χ2  = 0.395, P = 0.530, OR = 0.934, 95%CI: 0.754-1.156). In family-based study, we observed nonsignificant over-transmission of the G861 allele in HTR1B to TS offspring using the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT), haplotype relative risk (HRR) and haplotype-based HRR (HHRR) (TDT χ2  = 0.410, P = 0.560; HRR = 1.151, χ2  = 0.421, P = 0.517, 95% CI: 0.753-1.759; HHRR = 0.919, χ2  = 0.467, P = 0.495, 95%CI: 0.720-1.172).
Our study suggested that the polymorphism of HTR1B C861G is not a risk factor for TS in Han Chinese population. However, the result should be replicated in larger sample and different population.
Immune system dysregulation has been implicated to play a key role in pathogenesis of Tourette syndrome (TS). IL-1α and IL-1RN are important inflammatory cytokines that mediate the inflammation. In this study, we investigated the relationship between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of IL-1α and IL-1RN and the susceptibility to TS in Chinese Han population.
A total of 276 children with TS and their parents were recruited in the study. All DNA from our subjects were genotyped for SNPs of IL-1α rs17561 and IL-1RN rs315952 using predesigned TaqMan SNP genotyping assay. The genetic contributions of two polymorphisms were evaluated using transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) and haplotype relative risk (HRR) design. In addition, to increase the efficiency of the test, the haplotype-based HRR (HHRR) was performed.
No significant differences were observed in allelic and genotypic frequency of rs17561 in IL-1α and rs315952 in IL-1RN between the transmitted group and non-transmitted group (for IL-1α rs17561: TDT=0.890, df=1, P=0.402; HRR=1.011, X(2)=3.016, P=0.082, 95% CI=0.999-1.024; for IL-1RN rs315952: TDT=0.095, df=1, P=0.805; HRR=0.984, X(2)=0.008, P=0.929, 95% CI=0.695-1.394). Similarly, the analysis of HHRR also did not support a significant association (for IL-1α rs17561: HHRR=1.226, X(2)=0.915, P=0.339, 95% CI=0.807-1.863; for IL-1RN rs315952: HHRR=0.963, X(2)=0.094, P=0.759, 95% CI=0.758-1.225).
Our results suggest that IL-1α rs17561 and IL-1RN rs315952 polymorphisms may not be associated with susceptibility to TS in Chinese Han population. However, the results still need to be replicated in a larger sample size and different populations.
Our purpose is to investigate whether polymorphisms of 102 T/C and -1438A/G in 5HTR2A are associated with Tourette syndrome (TS) in Chinese Han population.
A total of 178 TS trios were recruited in this study. After the allelic and genotypic distributions of two polymorphisms were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), we compared their genetic distributions with what is expected with Hardy-Weinberg to explore whether there might be an association of these polymorphisms with TS by haplotype relative risk (HRR) and transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) statistics.
Our results showed that no significant associations were found between the HTR2A 102 T/C and -1438A/G polymorphisms and TS (for HTR2A 102 T/C: TDT = 2.041, df = 1, P = 0.175; HRR = 1.468, χ(2)  = 1.905, P = 0.168, 95% confidence interval: 0.850-2.535; for HTR2A: -1438A/G, TDT = 0.093, df = 1, P = 0.819; HRR = 0.965, χ(2)  = 0.018, P = 0.894, 95% confidence interval: 0.574-1.624).
Our study suggested that the HTR2A 102T/C and -1438A/G polymorphisms may not be associated with susceptibility to TS, and thus do not play a major role in the development of TS in the Chinese Han population. However, these results need to be confirmed in a larger sample collected from different populations.
To investigate the individual and combined prognostic value of HIF1α, SLC2A1, and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) in a multi-institutional cohort of patients with resected colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRCLM).
In the majority of patients with CRCLM, resection seems not to be curative, despite its curative intent. Overexpression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α), glucose transporter 1 (SLC2A1; also known as GLUT1), and VEGFA has been associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC).
Tissue microarrays were generated using CRCLM and patient-matched primary CRC from patients who underwent CRCLM resection between 1990 and 2010. Prognostic value of HIF1α, SLC2A1, and VEGFA was determined by immunohistochemistry. A 500-fold cross-validated hazard rate ratio (HRRav) for overall survival was calculated.
HIF1α, SLC2A1, and VEGFA expression could be evaluated in 328, 350, and 335 patients, respectively. High SLC2A1 expression was associated with good prognosis (HRRav, 0.67; P (HRR &gt;1)  &lt; 0.01) and high VEGFA expression to poor prognosis (HRRav, 1.84; P (HRR &lt; 1)  = 0.02), also after multivariate analysis including established clinicopathological prognostic variables (HRRav, 0.67; P (HRR &gt; 1)  &lt; 0.01 and HRRav, 1.50; P (HRR &lt; 1)  = 0.02, respectively). SLC2A1 showed prognostic value particularly in patients treated with systemic therapy (P &lt; 0.01), whereas the prognostic value of VEGFA expression was mainly observed in patients not treated with systemic therapy (P &lt; 0.01). Prognosis was especially poor in patients with both low SLC2A1 and high VEGFA expression (P &lt; 0.01). HIF1α expression was not associated with survival.
SLC2A1 and VEGFA expression are prognostic molecular biomarkers for patients with CRCLM with added value to established clinicopathological variables.
The objective of the study was to determine the effects of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) therapy on left ventricular (LV) function and electrocardiographic parameters in newly diagnosed moderate/severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients without cardiovascular comorbidities and medical treatments. We examined 44 patients who underwent overnight polysomnography together with 24-hour Holter electrocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise testing including heart rate recovery at 1 minute (HRR-1), echocardiography, surface electrocardiography, and those who were diagnosed with moderate/severe OSA apnea--hypopnea index ≥ 15. After 3 months of nCPAP treatment, the above-mentioned examinations were repeated. Forty-four patients completed the treatment period. Twelve weeks on effective nCPAP induced a significant increase in the mitral E/A ratio (P = 0.001), as well as reductions in isovolumic relaxation time (P = 0.001) and mitral deceleration time (DT) (P = 0.002). There were no significant differences in LV ejection fraction, LV mass index, and pulsed wave Doppler parameters. Mean heart rate was 79.2 ± 12.5 pulses/minute, maximum P-wave duration 117.5 ± 8.6 msec, P-wave dispersion (PWd) 54.6 ± 10.2 msec, corrected QT interval (QTc) 436.5 ± 40.5 msec, and QT dispersion (QTd) 46.3 ± 7.1 msec, which significantly decreased to 70.4 ± 9.6 pulses/minute (P &lt; 0.001), 111.5 ± 8.7 msec (P &lt; 0.001), 51.6 ± 8.9 msec (P &lt; 0.001), 418.4 ± 31.2 msec (P &lt; 0.001), and 33.8 ± 3.4 msec (P &lt; 0.001), respectively. Exercise capacity at baseline determined as 10.5 ± 2.2 metabolic equivalents (METS) and HRR-1 (20.6 ± 11.7 bpm) significantly increased (12.1 ± 1.5 METS and 27.4 ± 8.6 bpm). There was no significant difference in aortic root parameters. Three-month nCPAP therapy significantly increased LV shortening fraction, with no effect on systolic function or aortic root diameters and a positive effect on heart rate, PWd, HRR-1, QTc and QTd time following nCPAP therapy.
Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) is independently associated with cardiovascular risk, probably via inflammatory activity in sclerotic plaque. We speculated whether Lp-PLA2 has a role in the aetiology of vascular calcifications, estimated from circulating uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein (MGP) species and whether we could find a potential interaction of Lp-PLA2 and MGP in terms of mortality.
We examined 798 patients (mean age 65.1 years) with stable vascular disease and followed them in a prospective study. Both, desphospho-uncarboxylated and total MGP (dp-ucMGP or t-ucMGP) were quantified by pre-commercial ELISA assays, developed by VitaK (Maastricht, The Netherland)
Lp-PLA2 activity was independently positively associated with desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP) [β coeff = 0.098, p=0.006]. 1SD of Lp-PLA2 activity was associated with 37% increased risk (p=0.001) of elevated dp-ucMGP (≥977 pmol/L, top quartile). In the Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for conventional risk factors, the patients in the highest quartile of dp-ucMGP or lowest quintile of total-uncarboxylated ucMGP (&lt;2660 nmol/L) had higher risk of all-cause mortality [HRR 2.79 (95% CI 1.97-3.94) and HRR 1.69 (95% CI 1.18-2.42), respectively]. We observed no effect of high Lp-PLA2 activity (≥195 nmol/min/mL) on total mortality.
We assume that Lp-PLA2 is involved in vascular calcification and that dp-ucMGP is a more appropriate biomarker of residual risk than Lp-PLA2 itself.
Due to improved analytical performance of the newest generation of troponin assays, several patients have mild elevations of this parameter. Nevertheless, they do not show any signs of acute coronary syndrome. We speculated whether non-acute cardiac troponin I (cTnI) concentrations may improve prediction of residual mortality risk in clinically stable outpatients with chronic vascular disease.
We followed 830 patients (mean age 65.2years) after myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization or first ischemic stroke (pooled Czech samples of EUROASPIRE III and EUROASPIRE-stroke surveys, interviewed in 2006/2007) in a prospective cohort study. In addition to standard protocol, troponin I and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) was estimated from frozen samples. Vital status and declared cause of death from death certificates was registered to ascertain a 5-year all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.
During a median follow up of 2050days (5.6years) 168 patients died. In the multivariate Cox proportional hazard model, cTnI≥0.03ng/mL independently predicted an all-cause 5-year mortality with HRR 1.76 (95% CI: 1.09-2.83). In the Cox model, the better predictor of mortality was BNP &gt;150ng/L [HRR 3.47 (95% CI: 2.23-5.41)]. However, the combination of BNP with cTnI did not substantially improve its sensitivity or predictive power.
We cannot confirm the utility of asymptomatic mild cTnI elevation as a tool to detect residual risk of stable patients with vascular disease. On the other hand, BNP seems to be more appropriate for this purpose.
Colorectal cancer (CRC) frequently develops in multiple members of the same families, but more data are needed to prepare effective screening guidelines. We quantified the risk of CRC and adenomas in first-degree relatives (FDRs) and second-degree relatives and first cousins of individuals with CRC, and stratified risk based on age at cancer diagnosis.
We performed a case-control study of Utah residents, 50-80 years old, who underwent colonoscopy from 1995 through 2009. Index cases (exposed to colonoscopy) were colonoscopy patients with a CRC diagnosis. Age- and sex-matched individuals, unexposed to colonoscopy (controls) were selected to form the comparison groups for determining risk in relatives. Colonoscopy results were linked to cancer and pedigree information from the Utah Population Database to investigate familial aggregation of colorectal neoplasia using Cox regression analysis.
Of 126,936 patients who underwent a colonoscopy, 3804 were diagnosed with CRC and defined the index cases. FDRs had an increased risk of CRC (hazard rate ratio [HRR], 1.79; 95% confidence interval [CI],1.59-2.03), as did second-degree relatives (HRR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.19-1.47) and first cousins (HRR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.07-1.25), compared with relatives of controls. This risk was greater for FDRs when index patients developed CRC at younger than age 60 years (HRR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.70-2.63), compared with older than age 60 years (HRR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.58-1.99). The risk of adenomas (HRR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.66-2.00) and adenomas with villous histology (HRR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.96-3.01) also were increased in FDRs. Three percent of CRCs in FDRs would have been missed if the current guidelines, which stratify screening recommendations by the age of the proband, were strictly followed.
FDRs, second-degree relatives, and first cousins of patients who undergo colonoscopy and are found to have CRC have a significant increase in the risk of colorectal neoplasia. These data should be considered when establishing CRC screening guidelines for individuals and families.
The Medicare program provides universal access to hospital care for the elderly; however, mortality disparities may still persist in this population. The association of individual education and area income with survival and recurrence post Myocardial Infarction (MI) was assessed in a national sample.
Individual level education from the National Longitudinal Mortality Study was linked to Medicare and National Death Index records over the period of 1991-2001 to test the association of individual education and zip code tabulation area median income with survival and recurrence post-MI. Survival was partitioned into 3 periods: in-hospital, discharge to 1 year, and 1 year to 5 years and recurrence was partitioned into two periods: 28 day to 1 year, and 1 year to 5 years.
First MIs were found in 8,043 women and 7,929 men. In women and men 66-79 years of age, less than a high school education compared with a college degree or more was associated with 1-5 year mortality in both women (HRR 1.61, 95% confidence interval 1.03-2.50) and men (HRR 1.37, 1.06-1.76). Education was also associated with 1-5 year recurrence in men (HRR 1.68, 1.18-2.41, &lt; High School compared with college degree or more), but not women. Across the spectrum of survival and recurrence periods median zip code level income was inconsistently associated with outcomes. Associations were limited to discharge-1 year survival (RR lowest versus highest quintile 1.31, 95% confidence interval 1.03-1.67) and 28 day-1 year recurrence (RR lowest versus highest quintile 1.72, 95% confidence interval 1.14-2.57) in older men.
Despite the Medicare entitlement program, disparities related to individual socioeconomic status remain. Additional research is needed to elucidate the barriers and mechanisms to eliminating health disparities among the elderly.
Resection of colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRCLM) with curative intent has long-term benefit in ~40% of cases. Prognostic biomarkers are needed to improve clinical management and reduce futile surgeries. Expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2; also known as cyclooxygenase-2) has been associated with carcinogenesis and survival. We investigated the prognostic value of EGFR and PTGS2 expression in patients with resected CRCLM.
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded CRCLM tissue and corresponding primary tumour specimens from a multi-institutional cohort of patients who underwent liver resection between 1990 and 2010 were incorporated into tissue microarrays (TMAs). TMAs were stained for EGFR and PTGS2 by immunohistochemistry. The hazard rate ratio (HRR) for the association between expression in CRCLM and overall survival was calculated using a 500-fold cross-validation procedure.
EGFR and PTGS2 expression could be evaluated in 323 and 351 patients, respectively. EGFR expression in CRCLM was associated with poor prognosis (HRR 1.54; P&lt;0.01) with a cross-validated HRR of 1.47 (P=0.03). PTGS2 expression was also associated with poor prognosis (HRR 1.60; P&lt;0.01) with a cross-validated HRR of 1.63 (P&lt;0.01). Expression of EGFR and PTGS2 remained prognostic after multivariate analysis with standard clinicopathological variables (cross-validated HRR 1.51; P=0.02 and cross-validated HRR 1.59; P=0.01, respectively). Stratification for the commonly applied systemic therapy regimens demonstrated prognostic value for EGFR and PTGS2 only in the subgroup of patients who were not treated with systemic therapy (HRR 1.78; P&lt;0.01 and HRR 1.64; P=0.04, respectively), with worst prognosis when both EGFR and PTGS2 were highly expressed (HRR 3.08; P&lt;0.01). Expression of PTGS2 in CRCLM was correlated to expression in patient-matched primary tumours (P=0.02, 69.2% concordance).
EGFR and PTGS2 expressions are prognostic molecular biomarkers with added value to standard clinicopathological variables for patients with resectable CRCLM.
Somatic diseases have been associated with an increased risk for subsequent schizophrenia; however, it is unknown whether prior somatic diseases negatively affect early treatment outcomes after a first-time schizophrenia diagnosis.
We included all individuals born in Denmark after January 1st, 1977 and first-time diagnosed with schizophrenia between January 1st, 1996 and December 31st, 2015. We identified all life-time somatic hospital contacts and all prescriptions within the year before the first-time schizophrenia diagnosis and followed patients for up to five years regarding risk for schizophrenia (re)-hospitalization (relapse). We performed Cox regression analyses calculating hazard rate ratios (HRR) including 95%-confidence intervals (CI) and adjusted for relevant confounders.
We followed a total of 11,856 patients with a first-time schizophrenia diagnosis (58.7% male, mean age 23.1 (SD = 4.7) years) for 39,033 person-years, whereof 5506 (46.4%) had relapse with schizophrenia re-hospitalization during 5-year of follow-up. Somatic hospital contacts ever before (95.4%; HRR = 1.30; 95%-CI = 1.07-1.59), and specifically during the year before schizophrenia diagnosis (42.5%; HRR = 1.36; 95%-CI = 1.11-1.66) were associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia relapse as were a greater number of prior somatic hospital contacts (p &lt; 0.001). Individuals with up to four different prescriptions for somatic medications showed a trend towards a slightly lower risk of relapse.
Somatic diseases and health seeking patterns might have an impact on the course of schizophrenia, where severe somatic comorbidity, specifically during the year before first-time schizophrenia diagnosis, seem to negatively affect early treatment course, whereas previous somatic medication use may indicate a better compliance and help-seeking behavior.
In stable coronary heart disease (CHD) patients we aimed to assess the predictive potential of only mild increase of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in subjects free from symptoms or diagnostic criteria of heart failure (HF).
We examined 967 patients, at least 6 months after myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization and divided them into three categories: 'overt HF' (NYHA II-IV, objective signs of HF, chronic treatment with furosemide and/or spironolactone or history of hospitalisation for HF), 'subclinical HF (BNP over 150 ng/mL, but no criterion of overt HF)' and 'no HF' (no above mentioned criterion present). Follow-up was done to assess 5-years all-cause mortality.
Overt and subclinical HF (by definition) had 38.8% and 9.6% of patients, respectively. In analyses adjusted for classical risk factors and other possible covariates, both overt and subclinical HF were independently associated with increased mortality compared to no HF subjects [hazard risk ratio 1.99 (95%CI:1.02-3.91) and 3.01 (95%CI:1.90-4.78), respectively. The risk of total mortality was similar in overt and subclinical HF patients [HRR 1.30 (95%CI: 0.72-2.36)]. Within overt HF group, those with BNP &gt;150 ng/mL had also higher mortality risk than those with low BNP levels [HRR 2.79 (95%CI: 1.67-4.68)]. The addition of left ventricle ejection fraction into definition of HF groups did not affect main results.
Mild increase of BNP in generally stable and asymptomatic CHD patients identifies high individual mortality risk in the same extend that presence of clinically manifest HF.
To investigate whether regular blood donation decreases cardiovascular risk.
All 159 934 Dutch whole-blood donors with an active donation career of at least 10 years were categorised into sex-specific donation tertiles based on the number of donations during this 10-year qualification period. Cardiovascular endpoints were based on hospital discharge diagnoses and death certificates from Dutch Hospital Data and Statistics Netherlands and occurring after the 10-year qualification period. Cox regression was used to estimate the age-adjusted and starting year-adjusted hazard rate ratio (HRR).
Female high-frequency blood donors had a reduced cardiovascular morbidity (HRR=0.91, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.98) compared with low-frequency blood donors. No effect was observed in men (HRR=1.00, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.05). To rule out a residual healthy donor effect (HDE), additional sensitivity analyses using a 5-year qualification period were conducted. The results supported the absence of a residual HDE.
This study showed a protective effect of long-term, high-frequency blood donation against cardiovascular disease. This effect was only observed in women and not in men.
Angina pectoris with a normal coronary angiogram, termed microvascular angina (MVA), is an important clinical entity; however, its causes remain unclear. Autonomic dysfunction is one of the possible causes. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate parasympathetic dysfunction assessed by heart rate recovery (HRR) and increased sympathetic activity assessed by exaggerated blood pressure (BP) response (EBPR) to exercise in MVA.
The study participants were consecutive patients with anginal chest pain who underwent both coronary angiography with an ergonovine provocation test and a treadmill exercise test between January 2008 and February 2015. Patients with significant coronary artery disease (coronary artery stenosis ≥50%) or significant coronary artery spasm (≥90%) were excluded. Based on the treadmill exercise test, patients were categorized into the microvascular angina (MVA) group (patients with uniform ST depression ≥1 mm) and the control group. HRR was defined as peak heart rate minus heart rate after a 1 min recovery; blunted HRR was defined as ≤12 beats/min. EBPR was defined as a peak exercise systolic BP ≥210 mmHg in men and ≥ 190 mmHg in women. These parameters were compared between patients with MVA and the controls.
Among the 970 enrolled patients (mean age 53.1 years; female 59.0%), 191 (20.0%) were diagnosed with MVA. In baseline characteristics, the MVA group had older participants, female predominance, and a higher prevalence of hypertension. The MVA group showed significantly lower HRR 1 min (24.9 ± 15.9 vs. 31.3 ± 22.7, p &lt;  0.001) compared with the control group. Moreover, the proportion of EBPR was significantly higher in the MVA group than in the control group (21.5% vs. 11.6%, p &lt;  0.001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that age (odds ratio (OR), 1.045; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.026-1.064; p &lt;  0.001), HRR 1 min (OR, 0.990; 95% CI, 0.982-0.999; p = 0.022), and EBPR (OR, 1.657; 95% CI, 1.074-2.554; p = 0.022) were independently associated with MVA.
HRR and EBPR were associated with MVA, which suggests a link between MVA and autonomic dysregulation.
Guidelines aimed at improving care for lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer-related death in Canada and worldwide, require accurate knowledge of the diagnostic setting or pathway. We sought to determine how often lung cancer is initially diagnosed through the emergency department.
We performed a descriptive study that included all cases of primary lung cancer diagnosed in residents of Nova Scotia in 2014. Cancer registry data included diagnostic data and date of death to Aug. 31, 2016. We reviewed linked hospital records, including laboratory and imaging results, to identify the first positive diagnostic study and the route of presentation (emergency department v. other). We evaluated time from diagnosis to death as a function of presentation route using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression (hazard rate ratios [HRRs]).
Sufficient data were available for 946 of 951 cases identified, of which 336 (35.5%) were diagnosed through the emergency department. Cases diagnosed via the emergency department were more likely to be at an advanced stage (stage IV, 59.5% v. 43.4%), with patients experiencing shorter survival (1-yr survival, 28.4% v. 49.5%), including stage-specific survival. Mortality for cases diagnosed in the emergency department was 54% higher than for the non-emergency department group after adjusting for age and stage (HRR 1.54, 95% confidence interval 1.32-1.81). Few patients (7.1%, n = 24) who presented to the emergency department reported having no family physician.
The emergency department is a common route of presentation for lung cancer and is associated with advanced stage at diagnosis and reduced survival time. Strategies are needed to encourage pre-emergent diagnosis and to ensure that emergency providers are supported in the initial care of patients with lung cancer.
To investigate sex differences in associations between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and a spectrum of comorbid disorders.
The study population included all children born in Denmark from 1981 through 2013 (N = 1,665,729). Data were merged from Danish registers and information was obtained on birth characteristics, socioeconomic status, familial psychiatric history, and diagnoses of ADHD (n = 32,308) and comorbid disorders. To estimate absolute and relative risks of comorbid disorders, incidence rates and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were calculated for female and male individuals. In addition, interactions between ADHD and sex in association with comorbid disorders were estimated as HR ratios (HRRs) in female and male individuals (95% CIs).
Individuals diagnosed with ADHD had significantly increased absolute and relative risks of all 12 comorbid psychiatric disorders investigated. ADHD-sex interactions were found for some comorbid disorders. Compared with male individuals, ADHD in female individuals showed a stronger association with autism spectrum disorder (HRR 1.86, 95% CI 1.62-2.14), oppositional defiant/conduct disorder (HRR 1.97, 95% CI 1.68-2.30), intellectual disability (HRR 1.79, 95% CI 1.54-2.09), personality disorders (HRR 1.23, 95% CI 1.06-1.43), schizophrenia (HRR 1.21, 95% CI 1.02-1.43), substance use disorders (HRR 1.21, 95% CI 1.07-1.38), and suicidal behavior (1.28, 95% CI 1.12-1.47). The remaining disorders showed no significant sex differences in association with ADHD.
This study indicates that the association between ADHD and several comorbid disorders is stronger in female than in male individuals. These important findings add to the literature on sex differences in ADHD and suggest that female individuals diagnosed with ADHD are a more vulnerable group of patients.
The aim is to prospectively investigate both the "cohesion" and "network" perspectives of social capital in relation to total, cardiovascular (CVD), cancer and all other causes mortality. The 2008 public health survey in Scania was a postal questionnaire with three letters of reminder, and it was answered in the Autumn by 28,198 respondents (55% participation) aged 18-80 from a stratified random sample of the population register. This baseline was connected with the national causes of death registry (Dödsorsaksregistret) with a more than five-year follow-up August 27- November 14 (depending on individual response) to December 31, 2013 (946 deaths). The analyses were performed in multiple adjusted survival (Cox-) regression models. Results show that low social participation, common to both theoretical perspectives, had consistently high hazard rate ratios (HRRs) of total, CVD, cancer and other morality, and that HRRs of total and CVD mortality remained statistically significant even after adjustments for all covariates including health behaviors, BMI, unmet healthcare needs and self-rated health, HRR 1.28 (1.08-1.52) and HRR 1.79 (1.28-2.50), respectively. In contrast, low social support, specific to the "network" perspective, showed no significant associations with mortality, except for low emotional and instrumental support and other causes mortality for which HRRs remained significant adjusted for demographics and socioeconomic status (SES). Generalized trust in other people, specific to the "cohesion" perspective, showed statistically significant HRRs for total and other causes mortality until adjustments for health-related behaviours and BMI, although not after complete adjustments, and significant HRRs for CVD and cancer mortality before adjustment for health behaviours. In conclusion, low social participation is consistently associated with all forms of mortality, and particularly total and CVD mortality. Social participation represents a strong core of social capital theory, and items should measure both variety of social contact surfaces and intensity.
The effect of statin treatment on the risk of developing depression remains unclear. Therefore, we assessed the association between statin treatment and depression in a nationwide register-based cohort study with up to 20 years of follow up.
We identified all statin users in the period from 1996 to 2013 among individuals born in Denmark between 1920 and 1983. One non-user was matched to each statin user based on age, sex and a propensity score taking several potential confounders into account. Using Cox regression we investigated the association between statin use and: (I) redemption of prescriptions for antidepressants, (II) redemption of prescriptions for any other drug, (III) depression diagnosed at psychiatric hospitals, (IV) cardiovascular mortality and (V) all-cause mortality.
A total of 193,977 statin users and 193,977 non-users were followed for 2,621,282 person-years. Statin use was associated with (I) increased risk of antidepressant use (hazard rate ratio (HRR) = 1.33; 95% confidence interval (95%-CI) = 1.31-1.36), (II) increased risk of any other prescription drug use (HRR = 1.33; 95%-CI = 1.31-1.35), (III) increased risk of receiving a depression diagnosis (HRR = 1.22, 95%-CI = 1.12-1.32) - but not after adjusting for antidepressant use (HRR = 1.07, 95%-CI = 0.99-1.15), (IV) reduced cardiovascular mortality (HRR = 0.92, 95%-CI = 0.87-0.97) and (V) reduced all-cause mortality (HRR = 0.90, 95%-CI = 0.88-0.92).
These results suggest that the association between statin treatment and antidepressant use is unspecific (equivalent association between statins and most other drugs) and that the association between statin use and depression diagnoses is mediated by residual confounding, bias or by downstream effects of the statin prescription (seeing a physician more often).
Mechanisms underlying impaired exercise capacity and increased cardiovascular mortality observed in breast cancer (BC) patients remain unclear. The prevalence, functional, and prognostic significance of elevated resting heart rate (HR) and abnormal heart rate recovery (HRR) in breast cancer (BC) requires evaluation.
In a single-center, retrospective, case-control study of women referred for exercise treadmill testing (ETT), 448 BC patients (62.6 ± 10.0 years) were compared to 448 cancer-free, age-matched controls. Elevated resting HR was defined as HR ≥80 bpm at rest. Abnormal HRR at 1-minute following exercise was defined as ≤12 bpm if active recovery or ≤18 bpm if passive recovery. Association of these parameters with exercise capacity and all-cause mortality was evaluated.
Elevated resting HR (23.7% vs 17.0%, P = 0.013) and abnormal HRR (25.9% vs 20.3%, P = 0.048) were more prevalent in BC cohort than controls. In adjusted analyses, BC patients with elevated resting HR (-0.9 METs (SE 0.3); P = 0.0003) or abnormal HRR (-1.3 METs (SE 0.3); P &lt; 0.0001) had significant reductions in metabolic equivalents (METs) achieved during exercise. Elevated resting HR was not associated with mortality. There was a trend toward increased mortality in BC cohort with abnormal HRR (adjusted hazard ratio 2.06 (95% CI 0.95-4.44, P = 0.07)).
Women across the BC survivorship continuum, referred for ETT, have an increased prevalence of elevated resting HR and abnormal HRR relative to cancer-free, age-matched female controls. These parameters were associated with decreased exercise capacity. Strategies to modulate these abnormalities may help improve functional capacity in this cohort.
We examined the hypothesis that delayed heart rate recovery (HRR) after exercise testing, an estimate of decreased autonomic function, predicts the risk of cardiometabolic syndrome (MetS) and is associated with continuous MetS risk scores in healthy men. Participants were 2,740 men who underwent general health examinations and had no evidence of MetS, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and hypertension at baseline. Baseline HRR was calculated as the difference between peak heart rate attained during exercise testing and the heart rate at 1 (HRR 1) and 2 minutes (HRR 2) after test termination. Incident MetS was defined as participants having ≥3 MetS components, and continuous MetS risk score was computed as the sum of z-score of 5 risk factors at follow-up. The incidence of MetS was 61/1,000 person-years during an average follow-up of 5 years. The relative risks and 95% confidence interval (CI) of incident MetS in the lowest quartiles of HRR 1 and HRR 2 versus the highest quartile were 1.24 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.51) and 2.02 (95% CI 1.58 to 2.60), respectively, after adjusting for potential confounders, including peak oxygen uptake and resting heart rate. HRR 1 (ß = -0.052, p = 0.005) and HRR 2 (ß = -0.058, p = 0.009) were independently associated with clustered MetS risk scores after adjusting for covariates. In conclusion, the independent association between delayed HRR after exercise testing and incident MetS and continuous MetS risk scores suggests that decreased autonomic function may be considered as a parameter to predict the future likelihood of MetS.
Infections have been associated with increased risks for mental disorders, such as schizophrenia and depression. However, the association between all infections requiring treatment and the wide range of mental disorders is unknown to date.
To investigate the association between all treated infections since birth and the subsequent risk of development of any treated mental disorder during childhood and adolescence.
Population-based cohort study using Danish nationwide registers. Participants were all individuals born in Denmark between January 1, 1995, and June 30, 2012 (N = 1 098 930). Dates of analysis were November 2017 to February 2018.
All treated infections were identified in a time-varying manner from birth until June 30, 2013, including severe infections requiring hospitalizations and less severe infection treated with anti-infective agents in the primary care sector.
This study identified all mental disorders diagnosed in a hospital setting and any redeemed prescription for psychotropic medication. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed reporting hazard rate ratios (HRRs), including 95% CIs, adjusted for age, sex, somatic comorbidity, parental education, and parental mental disorders.
A total of 1 098 930 individuals (51.3% male) were followed up for 9 620 807.7 person-years until a mean (SD) age of 9.76 (4.91) years. Infections requiring hospitalizations were associated with subsequent increased risk of having a diagnosis of any mental disorder (n = 42 462) by an HRR of 1.84 (95% CI, 1.69-1.99) and with increased risk of redeeming a prescription for psychotropic medication (n = 56 847) by an HRR of 1.42 (95% CI, 1.37-1.46). Infection treated with anti-infective agents was associated with increased risk of having a diagnosis of any mental disorder (HRR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.29-1.51) and with increased risk of redeeming a prescription for psychotropic medication (HRR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.18-1.26). Antibiotic use was associated with particularly increased risk estimates. The risk of mental disorders after infections increased in a dose-response association and with the temporal proximity of the last infection. In particular, schizophrenia spectrum disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, personality and behavior disorders, mental retardation, autistic spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder, and tic disorders were associated with the highest risks after infections.
Although the results cannot prove causality, these findings provide evidence for the involvement of infections and the immune system in the etiology of a wide range of mental disorders in children and adolescents.
Impaired glucose metabolism represents one the most important cardiovascular risk factors, with steeply raising prevalence in overall population. We aimed to compare mortality risk of impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG) and overt diabetes mellitus (DM) in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD).
prospective cohort study METHODS: A total of 1685 patients, 6-24 months after myocardial infarction and/or coronary revascularization at baseline, were followed in a prospective cohort study. Overt DM was defined as fasting glucose ≥ 7 mmol/L and/or use of antidiabetic treatment, while IFG as fasting glucose 5.6-6.99 mmol/L, but no antidiabetic medication. The main outcomes were total and cardiovascular mortality during 5 years of follow-up.
During follow-up of 1826 days, 172 patients (10.2%) deceased, and of them 122 (7.2%) from a cardiovascular cause. Both exposures, overt DM (n=623, 37.0% of the whole sample) and IFG (n=436, 25.9%) were associated with an independent increase of 5-year total mortality, compared to normoglycemic subjects [fully adjusted hazard risk ratio (HRR) 1.63 (95%CI: 1.01-2.61)]; p=0.043 and 2.25 (95%CI: 1.45-3.50); p&lt;0.0001, respectively]. In contrast, comparing both glucose disorders one with each other, no significant differences were found for total mortality [HRR 0.82 (0.53-1.28); p=0.33]. Taking 5-years cardiovascular mortality as outcome, similar pattern was observed [HRR 1.96 (95%CI: 1.06-3.63) and 3.84 (95%CI: 2.19-6.73) for overt DM and IFG, respectively, with HRR 0.63 (95%CI: 0.37-1.07) for comparison of both disorders].
Impaired fasting glycaemia adversely increases mortality of CHD patients in the same extent as overt DM.
There is a well-documented link between eating disorders (EDs) and adverse health outcomes, including fertility difficulties. These findings stem largely from clinical data or samples using a clinical measure (e.g., diagnosis) of EDs, which may limit our understanding of how EDs or disordered eating behaviors (DEBs) shape female fertility.
We compared reproductive outcomes from two longitudinal data sources, clinical and population-based data from the Utah Population Database (UPDB) (N = 6,046), and nonclinical community-based data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Young Adult Health (Add Health) (N = 5,951). We examined age at first birth using Cox regression and parity using negative binomial regression.
Using the UPDB data, women with diagnosed ED experienced later ages of first birth (hazard rate ratio [HRR] = 0.38; p &lt; 0.01) and lower parity (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.38; p &lt; 0.01) relative to women without EDs. Using the Add Health sample, women who self-reported DEB experienced earlier age of first birth (HRR = 1.16; p &lt; 0.05) and higher parity (IRR = 1.17; p &lt; 0.01) relative to women without DEB.
Conflicting results suggest two sets of mechanisms, physical/biological (sex specific) and social/behavioral (gender specific), may be simultaneously shaping the reproductive outcomes of women with histories of EDs or DEB. Discipline-specific methodology likely shapes Women's Health research outcomes.
Glucocorticoids can have psychosis as a potential side effect, but have also been suggested to yield protective effects due to anti-inflammatory properties. Nonetheless, knowledge is sparse on the association between glucocorticoid treatment and development of psychosis, which we aimed to study in this first large-scale longitudinal study. Among all individuals born in Denmark 1995-2003 (n=597,257), we compared individuals who had redeemed ≥1 prescription for glucocorticoids to an active comparator group and a non-exposed group concerning subsequent development of schizophrenia spectrum disorders until 2013. Hazard rate ratios (HRR) were estimated using Cox regression adjusted for calendar year, age, gender, urbanization, somatic diseases, parental educational level and psychiatric history. The risk for a subsequent diagnosis of early-onset schizophrenia spectrum disorder (N=1141) was increased after exposure to both non-systemic (HRR=1.47; 95%-CI=1.25-1.73; N=371) and systemic glucocorticoids (HRR=1.66; 95%-CI=1.13-2.43; N=34), when compared to non-exposed individuals. Similar elevated risks were observed when comparing to the active comparator group, for schizophrenia and acute psychosis, and within an older cohort. The risk of psychosis was elevated the most within the first year after exposure to glucocorticoids (P&lt;0.001) without any indication for a dose-response association. However, in individuals with asthma, exposure to glucocorticoids did not further increase the risk of psychosis. Glucocorticoid exposure was associated with an increased risk for psychotic disorders, which may be explained by an effect of the underlying somatic disease, such as asthma. A potential beneficial effect of glucocorticoids on psychotic symptoms should be investigated in clinical trials.
One challenge of intensive pig production is tail damage caused by tail biting, and farmers often decrease the prevalence of tail damage through tail docking. However, tail docking is not an optimal preventive measure against tail damage and thus, it would be preferable to replace it. The aim of the current study was to investigate the relative effect of three possible preventive measures against tail damage. The study included 112 pens with 1624 finisher pigs divided between four batches. Pens were randomly assigned to one level of each of three treatments: (1) tail-docked (n=60 pens) v. undocked (n=52 pens), (2) 150 g of straw provided per pig per day on the solid floor (n=56 pens) v. no straw provided (n=56 pens), (3) stocking density of 1.21 m2/pig (11 pig/pen; n=56 pens) v. 0.73 m2/pig (18 pigs/pen; n=56 pens). Tail damage was recorded three times per week throughout the finisher period by scoring the tail of each individual pig. A pen was recorded as a tail damage pen and no longer included in the study if at least one pig in a pen had a bleeding tail wound; thus, only the first incidence of tail damage on pen level was recorded. Data were analysed by a Cox regression for survival analysis assuming proportional hazards. Results are presented as hazards, and a higher hazard means that a pen has a higher risk of tail damage and of it happening earlier in the finisher period. Pens with undocked pigs had a 4.32-fold higher hazard of tail damage compared with pens with docked pigs (P&lt;0.001). Pens with no straw provided had a 2.22-fold higher hazard of tail damage compared with pens with straw provided (P&lt;0.01). No interactions was seen between the treatments, but the effect of tail docking was higher than the effect of straw provision (P&lt;0.001). Stocking density did not have a significant effect on the hazard of tail damage (hazard rate ratios (HRR)=1.67; P=0.064). However, a combination of straw provision and lowered stocking density showed a similar hazard of tail damage as seen with only tail docking (HRR=1.58; P=0.39). In conclusion, tail docking and straw provision were preventive measures against tail damage, and tail docking reduced the risk more than straw provision. A combination of other preventive measures is necessary to reduce the risk of tail damage in undocked pigs to the same level as in docked pigs.
Heart rate recovery after 1 min of exercise cessation (HRR-1) is an important prognostic factor in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). We aimed to further elucidate the association between HRR-1 and known psychosocial risk factors in patients referred for comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation. We examined 521 patients with coronary heart disease in the first week of an outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and positive (PA) and negative affect were rated with the Global Mood Scale. Depressive symptoms showed a significant inverse relationship with HRR-1 (p &lt; .05), controlling for sociodemographic and medical covariates, whereas anxiety symptoms did not show a significant association. PA made a significant contribution to HRR-1 as well (p &lt; .05). Our findings suggest an independent association between HRR-1 and psychosocial risk factors of CVD.
Sepsis is the leading noncardiac cause of intensive care unit (ICU) death. Pre-ICU admission site may be associated with mortality of ICU patients with sepsis. This study quantifies mortality differences among patients with sepsis admitted to an ICU from a hospital ward, emergency department (ED), or an operating room (OR).
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 1762 adults with sepsis using ICU record data obtained from a clinical database of an academic medical center. Survival analysis provided crude and adjusted hazard rate ratio (HRR) estimates comparing hospital mortality among patients from hospital wards, EDs, and ORs, adjusted for age, sex, and severity of illness.
Mortality of patients with sepsis differed based on the pre-ICU admission site. Compared to patients admitted from an ED, patients admitted from hospital wards had higher mortality (HRR: 1.35; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09-1.68) and those admitted from an OR had lower mortality (HRR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.23-0.58).
Patients with sepsis admitted to an ICU from a hospital ward experienced greater mortality than patients with sepsis admitted to an ICU from an ED. These findings indicate that there may be systematic differences in the selection of patient care locations, recognition, and management of patients with sepsis that warrant further investigation.
Globally, the majority of childhood deaths in the post-neonatal period are caused by infections that can be effectively treated or prevented with inexpensive interventions delivered through even very basic health facilities. To understand the role of inadequate health systems on childhood mortality in Kenya, we assemble a large, retrospective cohort of children (born 1996-2013) and describe the health systems context of each child using health facility survey data representative of the province at the time of a child's birth. We examine the relationship between survival beyond 59 months of age and geographic distribution of health facilities, quality of services, and cost of services. We find significant geographic heterogeneity in survival that can be partially explained by differences in distribution of health facilities and user fees. Higher per capita density of health facilities resulted in a 25% reduction in the risk of death (HRR = 0.73, 95% CI:0.58 to 0.91) and accounted for 30% of the between-province heterogeneity in survival. User fees for sick-child visits increased risk by 30% (HRR = 1.30, 95% CI:1.11 to 1.53). These results implicate health systems constraints in child mortality, quantify the contribution of specific domains of health services, and suggest priority areas for improvement to accelerate reductions in child mortality.
Clozapine remains the only evidence-based treatment for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, and prediction of clozapine response is important in developing stratified treatment. We studied potential predictors of clozapine response, applying functional assessments as well as service use.
We performed a nationwide cohort study among all individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia in Denmark after 1995 (age, ≥18 years) who initiated clozapine treatment between 2004 and 2011 with a Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF-F) score registered at clozapine initiation. During up to 2-year follow-up, clinical response was defined as (a) no further hospitalization with schizophrenia or (b) improvement in GAF-F score (moderate improvement: increase, ≥10; substantial improvement: increase, ≥20; and GAF-F, ≥50). We performed Cox regression analysis and report adjusted hazard rate ratios (HRRs; 95% confidence intervals [95% CIs]).
Among 502 clozapine users with a registered GAF-F score, 232 (46.2%) remained out of hospital, 96 (19.1%) achieved moderate functional improvement, and 29 (5.8%) substantial functional improvement. Of all potential predictors, voluntary status at clozapine initiation showed borderline statistical significance with nonhospitalization (HRR, 1.61; 95% CI, 0.97-2.67). Regarding functional improvement, living with a partner was the strongest predictor with an almost threefold increased HRR (2.78; 95% CI, 1.07-7.23). Female sex was only nonsignificantly associated with functional improvement, whereas the chance of substantial improvement decreased by 15% (HRR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.72-1.00) for each year delay in clozapine initiation among females.
Living with a partner was the strongest predictor of functioning after clozapine initiation in this study. Although potentially indicating better premorbid functioning, this finding stresses the need and importance of social support during the course of the treatment independent of clinical factors.
Maternal smoking has consistently been associated with multiple adverse childhood outcomes including externalizing disorders. In contrast the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy (MSDP) and internalizing (anxiety and depressive) disorders in offspring has received less investigation.
We conducted a nationwide cohort study including 957635 individuals born in Denmark between 1991 and 2007. Data on MSDP and diagnoses of depression or anxiety disorders were derived from national registers and patients were followed up from the age of 5 years to the end of 2012. Hazard rate ratios (HRRs) were estimated using stratified Cox regression models. Sibling data were used to disentangle individual- and familial-level effects of MSDP and to control for unmeasured familial confounding.
At the population level, offspring exposed to MSDP were at increased risk for both severe depression [HRR 1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22-1.36] and severe anxiety disorders (HRR 1.26, 95% CI 1.20-1.32) even when controlling for maternal and paternal traits. However, there was no association between MSDP and internalizing disorders when controlling for the mother's propensity for MSDP (depression: HRR 1.11, 95% CI 0.94-1.30; anxiety disorders: HRR 0.94, 95% CI 0.80-1.11) or comparing differentially exposed siblings (depression: HRR 1.18, 95% CI 0.75-1.89; anxiety disorders: HRR 0.87, 95% CI 0.55-1.36).
The results suggest that familial background factors account for the association between MSDP and severe internalizing disorders not the specific exposure to MSDP.
In Spain, anti-pneumococcal vaccination is recommended for all children under 2 years old, high-risk groups and adults ≥65 years old. However, it is not funded in most autonomous communities. This study aims to compare pneumococcal disease hospitalisation rates between Period 1 (2007-2009), when 7-valent (PCV7) vaccine was available, and Period 2 (2011-2013), after the change to 13-valent (PCV13) vaccine in Spain. Data on hospitalisations were obtained from the National Registry of Hospitalisations. We calculated hospitalisation rates (HRs) and hospitalisation rate ratios (HRRs) among periods by age group and autonomous community, for all and by clinical presentation. From 138,361 patients hospitalised, 83,528 (60.4 %) were males. The median age was 73.8 years. The most common clinical presentation was pneumonia (133,204 hospitalisations; 96.3 %), followed by septicaemia (7053 hospitalisations; 5.1 %) and meningitis (3182 hospitalisations; 2.3 %). In Period 2, hospitalisations among children &lt;5 years old decreased for pneumonia [HRR: 0.37; 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI): 0.35 to 0.39] and meningitis (HRR: 0.53; 95 % CI: 0.44 to 0.65). For adults ≥65 years old, pneumonia (HRR: 0.49; 95 % CI: 0.49 to 0.50) and peritonitis (HRR: 0.34; 95 % CI: 0.19 to 0.63) hospitalisations decreased and septicaemia hospitalisations (HRR: 1.27; 95 % CI: 1.18 to 1.36) increased. Significant changes in HRs for pneumococcal disease were observed even without an integrated and continuous vaccination programme after the introduction of PCV13, especially in children &lt;5 years old and for pneumonia. The impact of the PCV13 adult vaccination new recommendations on the septicaemia increase reported should be evaluated in the future.
Accumulated moderate physical activity (PA) for 30 min in a day is the only recommended treatment of prehypertension.
We investigated autonomic modulation as a possible mechanism for the decrease in blood pressure (BP) during the rest periods in each 10 min session of PA.
We conducted a single-blind randomized multi-arm control trial on 40 prehypertensive (pre-HT) young male adults.
Participants were randomly divided by using random number table into four groups. Control (no intervention); Group 1 (walking at 50% of predicted VO2 peak); Group 2 (walking at 60% of predicted VO2 peak); Group 3 (walking at 70% of predicted VO2 peak). BP, heart rate variability (HRV), and heart rate recovery 1 min (HRR 1 min) were measured at baseline and during the rest period after each session of 10 min over 30 min of accumulated physical activity (PAcumm).
Significant diastolic BP (DBP) reduction (P &lt; 0.001) was observed during the rest period after each session of PAcumm in intervention groups. An average reduction in DBP was more in pre-HT undertaking PAcumm at 70% of predicted VO2 Peak. Decrease in the mean value of low-frequency (LF) and LF/high-frequency ratio was observed following PAcumm in all intervention groups irrespective of the intensity of PA. No significant association of reduction of BP with HRV and HRR 1 s was observed.
Reduction in BP was observed during the rest period after each 10 min session of PAcumm irrespective of the intensity of PA. Autonomic modulation does not seem to be the possible mechanism for the reduction in BP during the sessions.
In patients with risk factors or established atherothrombosis, atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with a poor prognosis compared with patients without AF. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of AF in patients with lower limb amputation (LLA) and its association with cardiovascular death and adverse cardiovascular events in long-term follow-up.
Observational prospective study of consecutive patients after index major (transfemoral and transtibial) LLA. The primary endpoint was cardiovascular death and secondary endpoint was a composite of adverse cardiovascular events at follow-up (acute myocardial infarction, contralateral lower limb amputation, and ischaemic stroke).
Of 282 patients with LLA, 46 (16.3%) patients had AF. AF patients were significantly older compared with patients without AF (median 74.0, IQR 13.0 vs. median 67.0, IQR 14.8 years, p &lt; .001). Diabetes and smoking on the other hand were significantly less prevalent in patients with AF compared with those without AF (41.3% vs. 72.0%, p &lt; .001 and 56.5% vs. 76.3%, p = .01, respectively). 54.3% of patients with AF were on oral anticoagulation therapy. At a median follow-up of 24.0 months (IQR 19.0-32.0), 28.3% patients with AF died of cardiovascular causes versus 17.8% without AF (HRR 1.8, 95% CI 1.0-3.4, p = .06). Adverse cardiovascular events occurred in 32.6% of patients with AF during follow-up versus 22.0% without AF (HRR 1.9, 95% CI 1.0-3.3, p = .03). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, AF (HRR 2.3, 95% CI 1.3-4.2, p = .01) and diabetes (HRR 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-3.9, p = .02) were identified as independent predictors of adverse cardiovascular events during the follow-up.
AF is common in patients with LLA and associated with higher risk of adverse cardiovascular events during long-term follow-up.
Assessment of psychosocial functioning in people with schizophrenia is important. The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF-F) scale represents a widely applied, easy, and quick tool, but its validity and reliability have been debated. The aim was to investigate whether GAF-F scores are associated with other indicators of functioning, severity, and hospitalization.
A Danish population-based cohort study of adults (≥18 years) with a recorded GAF-F score at first-time schizophrenia diagnosis during 2004-2011 was performed. The internal validity of GAF-F was evaluated by assessing its association with other baseline measures of functioning and illness severity. Risk of schizophrenia hospitalization within 2 years was evaluated using Cox regression stratified by sex and adjusted for age, year of diagnosis, and inpatient/outpatient status at diagnosis.
We identified 2,837 cases of schizophrenia with a GAF-F score at first-time diagnosis (73.0% inpatients; 62.6% males). GAF-F was associated with several baseline measures of functioning and illness severity, such as female sex, being in work, and a longer baseline hospitalization. Lower GAF-F scores were associated with higher hospitalization risk among males (reference GAF-F 61-100): GAF-F 51-60: hazard rate ratio (HRR) =1.24 (95% confidence interval [CI] =0.89-1.75); GAF-F 41-50: HRR =1.31 (95% CI =0.97-1.77); GAF-F 31-40: HRR =1.36 (95% CI =1.01-1.82); GAF-F 21-30: HRR =1.50 (95% CI =1.09-2.06); and GAF-F 1-20: HRR =2.30 (95% CI =1.36-3.90), fitting a dose-response relationship (P=0.031). This association was not found in females.
GAF-F at first-time schizophrenia diagnosis showed good internal validity against other measures of functionality in a Danish hospital setting. Severe impairment (as measured by the GAF-F score) at first-time schizophrenia diagnosis was associated with a higher risk of 2-year hospitalization among males, which may indicate sex differences in the course of disease and treatment response.
Cholestasis remains a major challenge in drug-induced liver injury, and therefore warrants identification of chemical entities that may lead to cholestasis. Recent advances in cell culture methods enable 3D spheroid models to remain viable for much longer periods of time than conventional sandwich cultures of primary human hepatocytes while maintaining native tissue-like functionality, such as drug metabolism activity, receptor signaling functionality, and physiological relevance. These spheroid models enable us to study repeated exposure effects associated with chemicals and their metabolites that may ultimately progress to cholestasis and liver injury. HepaRG cells cultured as spheroids are viable for more than 4 weeks with cytochrome P450 enzymatic activities comparable to ranges observed in freshly isolated/cryopreserved suspensions of primary human hepatocytes. HepaRG spheroids form bile canalicular structures with potential application as a model to study biliary excretion processes and intrahepatic obstruction of bile flow, leading to hepatocellular damage and death. In this chapter, we describe methods to culture 3D spheroids of HepaRG cells with extensive bile canalicular structures/networks, image transport of bile acid (cholyl-lysyl-fluorescein) to the bile canaliculi, and measure cholestatic drug-induced cytotoxicity.
Considerable debate surrounds the economic, political, and ideological systems that constitute primary state formation. Theoretical and empirical research emphasize the role of religion as a significant institution for promoting the consolidation and reproduction of archaic states. The Tiwanaku state developed in the Lake Titicaca Basin between the 5th and 12th centuries CE and extended its influence over much of the south-central Andes of South America. We report on recent discoveries from the first systematic underwater archaeological excavations in the Khoa Reef near the Island of the Sun, Bolivia. The depositional context and compositional properties of offerings consisting of ceramic feline incense burners, killed juvenile llamas, and sumptuary metal, shell, and lapidary ornaments allow us to reconstruct the structure and significance of cyclically repeated state rituals. Using new theoretical tools, we explain the role of these rituals in promoting the consolidation of the Tiwanaku polity.
Self-disclosure of HIV serostatus by youth has been considered an essential component of HIV prevention and medication adherence efforts. Therefore, a comprehensive investigation of disclosure goals, processes, and outcomes is warranted. We conducted a global systematic review in accordance with the 2015 Preferred Items for Reporting Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis tool to assess HIV self-disclosure among youth ages 13-24. We identified 5881 articles during our initial search. After screening titles and abstracts and examining articles in greater detail, 33 studies (35 articles) were included in the synthesis. The disclosure process model was used to highlight antecedent goals to self-disclosure including common avoidance goals such as fear of rejection and isolation. While disclosure was associated with negative and positive emotional outcomes and improved medication adherence, there remain concerns regarding the impact of self-disclosure on sexual behaviors. Implications for practice and future directions for research are presented.PROSPERO registration number: CRD42018097250.
Recent work by Benjamin and colleagues (Psychological Review, 116 (1), 84-115, 2009; Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 39(5), 1601-1608, 2013) suggests that recognition memory decisions are corrupted by random variability in decision criteria. This conclusion, which explains several anomalies in the recognition literature, was based on fits of the Noisy Decision Theory of Signal Detection (NDT) to a novel task: ensemble recognition. In the ensemble task, participants make Old/New decisions to ensembles of items rather than single items. The NDT assumption that criteria are fixed across ensembles was criticized by Kellen, Klauer, and Singmann (Psychological Review, 119 (3), 457-479, 2012), and defended by Benjamin (Psychological Review, 120, 720-726, 2013). Little attention, however, has been paid to the assumption of the best-fitting NDT model that participants solve the ensemble task by calculating the average memory strength of items in the probe display. We review evidence of summary statistical representation in visual perception and short-term memory that suggests the aggregation hypothesis is plausible, and hold it up to test in three experiments using the direct ratings procedure. Although we conclude that participants can produce estimates of average probe memory strength at test, in line with the assumptions of NDT, the mechanisms and strategies used to produce such estimates remain unclear.
Convincing evidence demonstrated impairment of the blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), mainly by endothelial cell (EC) alterations. Replacing damaged ECs by cell transplantation is a potential barrier repair strategy. Recently, we showed that intravenous (iv) administration of human bone marrow CD34+ (hBM34+) cells into symptomatic ALS mice benefits BSCB restoration and postpones disease progression. However, delayed effect on motor function and some severely damaged capillaries were noted. We hypothesized that hematopoietic cells from a restricted lineage would be more effective. This study aimed to establish the effects of human bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (hBMEPCs) systemically transplanted into G93A mice at symptomatic disease stage. Results showed that transplanted hBMEPCs significantly improved behavioral disease outcomes, engrafted widely into capillaries of the gray/white matter spinal cord and brain motor cortex/brainstem, substantially restored capillary ultrastructure, significantly decreased EB extravasation into spinal cord parenchyma, meaningfully re-established perivascular astrocyte end-feet, and enhanced spinal cord motor neuron survival. These results provide novel evidence that transplantation of hBMEPCs effectively repairs the BSCB, potentially preventing entry of detrimental peripheral factors, including immune/inflammatory cells, which contribute to motor neuron dysfunction. Transplanting EC progenitor cells may be a promising strategy for barrier repair therapy in this disease.
Inflammation causes activation of nociceptive sensory nerves, resulting in debilitating sensations and reflexes. Inflammation also induces mitochondrial dysfunction through multiple mechanisms. Sensory nerve terminals are densely packed with mitochondria, suggesting that mitochondrial signaling may play a role in inflammation-induced nociception. We have previously shown that agents that induce mitochondrial dysfunction, such as antimycin A, activate a subset of nociceptive vagal sensory nerves that express transient receptor potential (TRP) channels ankyrin 1 (A1) and vanilloid 1 (V1). However, the mechanisms underlying these responses are incompletely understood. Here, we studied the contribution of TRPA1, TRPV1 and reactive oxygen species (ROS) to antimycin A-induced vagal sensory nerve activation in dissociated neurons and at the sensory terminals of bronchopulmonary C-fibers. Nociceptive neurons were defined chemically and genetically. Antimycin A-evoked activation of vagal nociceptors in a Fura2 Ca2+ assay correlated with TRPV1 responses compared to TRPA1 responses. Nociceptor activation was dependent on both TRP channels, with TRPV1 predominating in a majority of responding nociceptors and TRPA1 predominating only in nociceptors with the greatest responses. Surprisingly, both TRPA1 and TRPV1 were activated by H2O2 when expressed in HEK293. Nevertheless, targeting ROS had no effect of antimycin A-evoked TRPV1 activation in either HEK293 or vagal neurons. In contrast, targeting ROS inhibited antimycin A-evoked TRPA1 activation in HEK293, vagal neurons and bronchopulmonary C-fibers, and a ROS-insensitive TRPA1 mutant was completely insensitive to antimycin A. We therefore conclude that mitochondrial dysfunction activates vagal nociceptors by ROS-dependent (TRPA1) and ROS-independent (TRPV1) mechanisms.
Studies have reported bidirectional associations of sleep with daily stressors and negative mood. Yet we know little about how sleep is associated with workers' daily cognitive interference, or the experience of off-task and distracting thoughts. This study examined whether nightly sleep was associated with next-day cognitive interference, and vice versa, during workdays and non-work days.
Daily telephone interviews.
US information technology workplaces.
130 middle-aged employees.
On 8 consecutive days, participants reported the frequency of experiencing off-task and distracting thoughts during the day (0 = never to 4 = very often) and multiple sleep characteristics (bedtimes, wake times, sleep duration, sleep quality, and sleep latency). Covariates included sociodemographic characteristics and work hours.
Multilevel models revealed that, on days following earlier wake times (B = -0.32, P &lt; .01), shorter sleep duration (B = -0.27, P &lt; .01), or poorer sleep quality (B = -0.17, P &lt; .01), participants reported more cognitive interference than usual. That is, waking 19 minutes earlier and sleeping 16 minutes less were associated with one additional point on the cognitive interference scale the next day. With cognitive interference predicting nightly sleep, more same day's cognitive interference was associated with earlier bedtimes (B = -0.19, P &lt; .05) and earlier wake times (B = -0.30, P &lt; .01) than usual. The temporal associations of nightly sleep duration and sleep quality with the following day's cognitive interference were significant on work days, but not on non-work days.
Our results suggest bidirectional associations between poorer sleep and more cognitive interference, particularly on work days with implications for workday productivity and quality of life.

Protocols for HIV care are widely accepted by all international organizations and are proven to reduce mortality and complications from living with HIV. Unfortunately, executing best practice recommendations in Sierra Leone is difficult due to shortages in staff, training, and medications.
From June 2016 to August 2016, we implemented both an HIV guideline-based clinical evaluation protocol and a patient-centered workflow for TB screening and CD4 testing in the HIV clinic at Koidu Government Hospital (KGH) in rural Sierra Leone. The primary outcome of interest was how often this service center resulted in a clinically significant change in the patients' HIV regimen. Reasons for changing regimen included diagnosis of co-infection with tuberculosis (TB), diagnosis of clinical or presumed immunologic treatment failure of antiretroviral (ART) medications and, need for adherence to weight-based dosing in pediatric patients.
A total of 188 patients with HIV were seen in the clinic; 49 (26%) of these patients had a clinically significant change in their HIV regimen. The most common reason for regimen change was TB co-infection diagnosis in 38 (20%) patients. The other reasons for HIV regimen changes included: eight children whose ART was adjusted to meet appropriate levels for weight-based guidelines, five patients diagnosed with presumed immunologic treatment failure (some also co-infected with tuberculosis), and two patients with a serious side effect to ART.
A comprehensive, patient-centric HIV clinic can result in high rates of case detection for tuberculosis and recognition of immunological ART failure.
Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) is breathed during hyperbaric oxygen therapy and during certain undersea pursuits in diving and submarine operations. What limits exposure to HBO2 in these situations is the acute onset of central nervous system oxygen toxicity (CNS-OT) following a latent period of safe oxygen breathing. CNS-OT presents as various non-convulsive signs and symptoms, many of which appear to be of brainstem origin involving cranial nerve nuclei and autonomic and cardiorespiratory centers, which ultimately spread to higher cortical centers and terminate as generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The initial safe latent period makes the use of HBO2 practical in hyperbaric and undersea medicine; however, the latent period is highly variable between individuals and within the same individual on different days, making it difficult to predict onset of toxic indications. Consequently, currently accepted guidelines for safe HBO2 exposure are highly conservative. This review examines the disorder of CNS-OT and summarizes current ideas on its underlying pathophysiology, including specific areas of the CNS and fundamental neural and redox signaling mechanisms that are thought to be involved in seizure genesis and propagation. In addition, conditions that accelerate the onset of seizures are discussed, as are current mitigation strategies under investigation for neuroprotection against redox stress while breathing HBO2 that extend the latent period, thus enabling safer and longer exposures for diving and medical therapies.
Skeletal muscle hypertrophy commonly occurs with repeated bouts of resistance exercise as well as following the administration of exogenous drugs. This increase in muscle size is thought to be mechanistically important for the increase in muscle function. However, at present, there is no experimental evidence that would support any paradigm in which muscle hypertrophy is a mechanism for increasing strength with exercise. Therefore, it seems reasonable to also question the importance of changes in muscle size for changes in muscle strength (function) following exogenous drugs as well as aging, where both muscle size and strength decrease. The purpose of this paper is to discuss whether changes in muscle size contribute to changes in voluntary strength following exercise, pharmaceutical interventions, and aging. We also aim to provide potential mechanisms (central and peripheral) for the change in strength as well as outline study designs to better address this question. Herein, we suggest that there are dissociations between changes in muscle size and strength following exercise, anabolic drug administration, and aging (to a point). These dissociations occur throughout the literature, suggesting that these changes may be completely separate phenomena. We are not dismissing the potential importance of maintaining muscle mass, particularly in clinical populations. What we are suggesting, however, is that muscle function may not necessarily be improved by these exercise or pharmacological induced increases in muscle size. Exploring mechanisms and explanations beyond just changes in muscle size may improve therapy targeted at improving muscle function.
The purpose of this study was to examine acute changes in muscle thickness (MTH) and echo-intensity (EI), following four sets of biceps curls, when it is known that the change in MTH is due entirely to swelling.
Forty-nine resistance-trained men and women participated in this study. Individuals in the experimental group (n  =  23) visited the lab on two separate occasions. During the first visit, paperwork and one repetition maximum (1RM) strength were measured. During the second visit (3-5 d after visit 1), individuals performed four sets of biceps curls to failure using 70% of their 1RM. MTH and EI measurements were taken before and immediately following exercise using B-mode ultrasound. The ultrasound probe was equipped with a level to minimize the influence of probe tilt on the EI measurement. A time-matched control group (n  =  26) was included to account for measurement error for both MTH and EI. Results are presented as means (95% CI).
For MTH there was a group (Experimental versus Control) by time (Pre-Post) interaction (p   &lt;  0.001). MTH increased in the experimental group (mean value change  =  0.44 (0.33-0.54) cm), but not in the control group (mean value change  =  -0.015 (-0.03-0.01) cm). For EI, there was no group by time interaction (p   =.074). In addition, there were no main effects for group (p   =  0.254) or time (p   =  0.314). The mean difference in the change in EI between groups was  -2.99 (-6.25-3.03) arbitrary units.
EI cannot be used to detect exercise induced changes in muscle thickness.
Milk fat globules (MFGs), which are secreted by the epithelial cells of the lactating mammary glands, account for the most of the nutritional value of milk. They are enveloped by the milk fat globule membrane (MFGM), a complex structure consisting of three phospholipid membrane monolayers and containing various lipids. Depending on the origin of milk, specific proteins accounts for 5-70% of the MFGM mass. Proteome of MFGMs includes hundreds of proteins, with nine major components being adipophilin, butyrophilin, cluster of differentiation 36, fatty acid binding protein, lactadherin, mucin 1, mucin 15, tail-interacting protein 47 (TIP47), and xanthine oxidoreductase. Two of the MFGM components, adipophilin and TIP47, belong to the five-member perilipin family of lipid droplet proteins. Adipophilin is involved in the formation of cytoplasmic lipid droplets and secretion of MFGs. This protein is also related to the formation of other lipid droplets that exist in most cell types, playing an important role in the transport of lipids from ER to the surface of lipid droplets. TIP47 acts as a cytoplasmic sorting factor for mannose 6-phosphate receptors and is recruited to the MFGM. Therefore, both adipophilin and TIP47 are moonlighting proteins, each possessing several unrelated functions. This review focuses on the main functions and specific structural features of adipophilin and TIP47, analyzes similarities and differences of these proteins among different species, and describes these proteins in the context of other members of the perilipin family.

Drug-drug interaction (DDI) is becoming a serious issue in clinical pharmacy as the use of multiple medications is more common. The PubMed database is one of the biggest literature resources for DDI studies. It contains over 150,000 journal articles related to DDI and is still expanding at a rapid pace. The extraction of DDI-related information, including compounds and proteins from PubMed, is an essential step for DDI research. In this paper, we introduce a tool, CuDDI (compute unified device architecture-based DDI searching), for identification of DDI-related terms (including compounds and proteins) from PubMed. There are three modules in this application, including the automatic retrieval of substances from PubMed, the identification of DDI-related terms, and the display of relationship of DDI-related terms. For DDI term identification, a speedup of 30⁻105 times was observed for the compute unified device architecture (CUDA)-based version compared with the implementation with a CPU-based Python version. CuDDI can be used to discover DDI-related terms and relationships of these terms, which has the potential to help clinicians and pharmacists better understand the mechanism of DDIs. CuDDI is available at: https://github.com/chengusf/CuDDI.
The benefits nature provides to people, called ecosystem services, are increasingly recognized and accounted for in assessments of infrastructure development, agricultural management, conservation prioritization, and sustainable sourcing. These assessments are often limited by data, however, a gap with tremendous potential to be filled through Earth observations (EO), which produce a variety of data across spatial and temporal extents and resolutions. Despite widespread recognition of this potential, in practice few ecosystem service studies use EO. Here, we identify challenges and opportunities to using EO in ecosystem service modeling and assessment. Some challenges are technical, related to data awareness, processing, and access. These challenges require systematic investment in model platforms and data management. Other challenges are more conceptual but still systemic; they are byproducts of the structure of existing ecosystem service models and addressing them requires scientific investment in solutions and tools applicable to a wide range of models and approaches. We also highlight new ways in which EO can be leveraged for ecosystem service assessments, identifying promising new areas of research. More widespread use of EO for ecosystem service assessment will only be achieved if all of these types of challenges are addressed. This will require non-traditional funding and partnering opportunities from private and public agencies to promote data exploration, sharing, and archiving. Investing in this integration will be reflected in better and more accurate ecosystem service assessments worldwide.
This American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement update is directed towards healthcare providers of patients involved in sport and exercise. There have been significant advances in clinical and scientific research in the understanding of blood-borne pathogens (BBPs), and this update incorporates these advancements. This document is intended as a general guide to clinical practice based on the current state of the evidence, while acknowledging the need for modification as new knowledge becomes available. Confirmed transmission of BBPs during sport is exceedingly rare. There are no well-documented reports of HIV, HCV or HDV transmission during sport. There is also no evidence for universal testing for BBPs as a specific requirement for participation in sports. Competitive athletes and non-athletes should follow appropriate general public health agency recommendations for screening for BBPs, considering their individual risk factors and exposures. Standard (universal) precautions must be followed by those providing care to athletes. Exercise and athletic participation can help promote a healthy lifestyle for persons living with BBPs. Those with acute symptomatic BBP infection should limit exercise intensity based on their current health status. Education is the key tool for preventing BBP transmission. Research gaps include evaluation of the prevalence of BBP infections in competitive athletes, the effects of long-term, intense training on infected athletes and the effects of BBP treatment therapies on performance.
Ovarian and uterine serous cancers are extremely lethal diseases that often present at an advanced stage. The late-stage diagnosis of these patients results in the metastasis of their cancers throughout the peritoneal cavity leading to death. Improving survival for these patients will require identifying therapeutic targets, strategies to target them, and means to deliver therapies to the tumors. One therapeutic target is the protein AXL, which has been shown to be involved in metastasis in both ovarian and uterine cancer. An effective way to target AXL is to silence its expression with small interfering RNA (siRNA). We investigate the ability of the novel siRNA delivery platform, p5RHH, to deliver anti-AXL siRNA (siAXL) to tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo as well as examine the phenotypic effects of this siRNA interference. First, we present in vitro assays showing p5RHH-siAXL treatment reduces invasion and migration ability of ovarian and uterine cancer cells. Second, we show p5RHH nanoparticles target to tumor cells in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate p5RHH-siAXL treatment reduces metastasis in a uterine cancer mouse xenograft model, without causing an obvious toxicity. Collectively, these findings suggest that this novel therapy shows promise in the treatment of ovarian and uterine cancer patients.
Background: To effectively train future leaders, undergraduate public health programs must prepare students to address challenges with cross-cultural competence and a global perspective. Study abroad programming represents a high impact practice that can be applied to any number of areas and topics within the field of public health. Infusing global learning into undergraduate curriculum, increases confidence in serving culturally diverse populations and aligns with multiple public health accreditation standards. Unfortunately, barriers often prevent integration of this high impact practice into program curriculum. This manuscript provides strategies to integrate diverse study abroad programming into public health curriculum and mitigate common barriers for students and faculty. Methods: Faculty from the University of South Florida (USF) College of Public Health (COPH) used three strategies to improve access to global learning: Adding public health courses to established study abroad programsUtilizing academic travel companiesLeveraging existing international and university partnerships. Results: A diverse array of public health-focused study abroad programs resulted from these strategies. Starting with just 12 students in the first program, the number of undergraduate participants in short-term, faculty lead courses grew to 164 students over the span of 4 academic years. This represents a 275% increase in undergraduate students participating in public health-focused study abroad courses, and a 160% increase in the percentage of public health majors participating in study abroad coursework. The primary barriers of cost, curriculum, and academic culture were addressed throughout development of each new program. Conclusions: Infusing study abroad programs into the public health curriculum provides students with diverse opportunities to gain the skills they will need as public health practitioners. The design and implementation of the strategies that were used to successfully integrate global learning into one public health program's curriculum can help inform other schools and programs of public health on ways to increase student utilization of this high-impact practice.
Human serum albumin (HSA) serves as a depot and carrier of multiple unrelated ligands including several participants of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), such as amyloid β peptide (Aβ), Zn2+/Cu2+ ions, docosahexaenoic (DHA), linoleic (LA), and oleic (OA) acids. To explore the interplay between HSA interaction with Zn2+/Cu2+ and the plasma unsaturated fatty acids (DHA, LA, OA, and arachidonic acid (ArA)), we have studied the metal dependence of the fatty acid (FA) binding capacity of HSA (nmax) and structural consequences of the HSA-FA interactions. HSA loading with Zn2+ decreases nmax value by 0.3-1.5, while its saturation with Cu2+ causes the FA-dependent nmax changes by up to 0.9. The Cu2+-induced decline in nmax value for DHA is due to conformational rearrangements in HSA molecule. In other cases, the changes in nmax are attributed to steric hindarance/facilitation of the HSA-FA interaction because of the protein multimerization/monomerization, as confirmed by chemical crosslinking. The surface hydrophobicity of HSA is Cu2+-, Zn2+-, and FA-dependent and decreases upon the FA binding, according to bis-ANS fluorescence data. Overall, Zn2+ or Cu2+ binding selectively affect HSA interaction with the FAs studied, in part due to changes in quaternary structure of the protein.
Although emotion regulation has been identified as a key function of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), it is unclear how specific indices of emotion regulation are associated with particular NSSI methods as markers of risk. This study used latent class analysis (LCA) to identify subgroups of individuals who engage in NSSI and their patterns of emotional regulation difficulties. Undergraduate students in the southeastern United States (N = 326) completed an online survey. LCA was used to identify subgroups of individuals engaging in NSSI and their associated emotion regulation difficulties. These subgroups were then compared across a variety of behavioral health outcomes (e.g. impulsive behavior, disordered eating, problematic alcohol use, suicide attempt history) to characterize specific risk profiles. The LCA revealed four subgroups who engage in NSSI and have specific emotion regulation difficulties. These subgroups were differentially associated with behavioral health outcomes, including suicide risk, disordered eating, and impulsive behavior. Results of this research could aid in clinical identification of at-risk individuals.
Uninsured patients are not well-tracked within the healthcare system and therefore not commonly recorded in databases. Epidemiologic data regarding patients visiting free clinics, specifically those with dermatologic concerns, is limited.
The purpose of this study is to explore the prevalence of dermatologic complaints among uninsured patients who visit free clinics.
A cross-sectional chart review of 5,553 uninsured patients seen across eight free clinics in Tampa, Florida, during 2016 was carried out to determine the prevalence of dermatologic chief complaints and patient demographics.
Across eight free clinics, a total of 5,553 patients were seen in 2016. Of these patients, 444 (8%) presented with dermatologic complaints. The most common complaints pertained to rashes (localized rash [n=83, 18.7%], genital rash [n=51, 11.5%], or generalized rash [n=50, 11.3%]), questionable lesions (n=35, 7.9%), and genital lesions (n=18, 4.1%).
There are notable variations in medical documentation practices among free clinics, thereby limiting data collection.
Free clinics have the potential to relieve a great dermatologic burden throughout the uninsured population. The findings from this study can inform other free clinics of the dermatologic conditions most likely seen among their patient population to better provide their patients with higher quality care.
While autoimmunity and hyperinflammation secondary to recombinase activating gene (RAG) deficiency have been associated with delayed diagnosis and even death, our current understanding is limited primarily to small case series.
Understand the frequency, severity, and treatment responsiveness of autoimmunity and hyperinflammation in RAG deficiency.
In reviewing the literature and our own database, we identified 85 patients with RAG deficiency, reported between 2001 and 2016, and compiled the largest case series to date of 63 patients with prominent autoimmune and/or hyperinflammatory pathology.
Diagnosis of RAG deficiency was delayed a median of 5 years from the first clinical signs of immune dysregulation. The majority of patients (55.6%) presented with more than one autoimmune or hyperinflammatory complication, with the most common etiologies being cytopenias (84.1%), granulomas (23.8%), and inflammatory skin disorders (19.0%). Infections, including live viral vaccinations, closely preceded the onset of autoimmunity in 28.6% of cases. Autoimmune cytopenias had early onset (median 1.9, 2.1, and 2.6 years for autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and autoimmune neutropenia (AN), respectively) and were refractory to intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids, and rituximab in the majority of cases (64.7%, 73.7%, and 71.4% for AIHA, ITP, and AN, respectively). Evans syndrome specifically was associated with lack of response to first-line therapy. Treatment-refractory autoimmunity/hyperinflammation prompted hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in 20 patients.
Autoimmunity/hyperinflammation can be a presenting sign of RAG deficiency and should prompt further evaluation. Multi-lineage cytopenias are often refractory to immunosuppressive treatment and may require hematopoietic cell transplantation for definitive management.
We propose an approach for characterizing structural heterogeneity of lung cancer nodules using Computed Tomography Texture Analysis (CTTA). Measures of heterogeneity were used to test the hypothesis that heterogeneity can be used as predictor of nodule malignancy and patient survival. To do this, we use the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) dataset to determine if heterogeneity can represent differences between nodules in lung cancer and nodules in non-lung cancer patients. 253 participants are in the training set and 207 participants in the test set. To discriminate cancerous from non-cancerous nodules at the time of diagnosis, a combination of heterogeneity and radiomic features were evaluated to produce the best area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.85 and accuracy 81.64%. Second, we tested the hypothesis that heterogeneity can predict patient survival. We analyzed 40 patients diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma (20 short-term and 20 long-term survival patients) using a leave-one-out cross validation approach for performance evaluation. A combination of heterogeneity features and radiomic features produce an AUROC of 0.9 and an accuracy of 85% to discriminate long- and short-term survivors.
International Stem Cell Corporation human parthenogenetic neural stem cells (ISC-hpNSC) have potential therapeutic value for patients suffering from traumatic brain injury (TBI). Here, we demonstrate the behavioral and histological effects of transplanting ISC-hpNSC intracerebrally in an animal model of TBI. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a moderate controlled cortical impact TBI surgery. Transplantation occurred at 72 h post-TBI with functional readouts of behavioral and histological deficits conducted during the subsequent 3-month period after TBI. We characterized locomotor, neurological, and cognitive performance at baseline (before TBI), then on days 0, 1, 7, 14, 30, 60, and 90 (locomotor and neurological), and on days 28-30, 58-60, and 88-90 (cognitive) after TBI. Following completion of behavioral testing at 3 months post-TBI, animals were euthanized by transcardial perfusion and brains harvested to histologically characterize the extent of brain damage. Neuronal survival was revealed by Nissl staining, and stem cell engraftment and host tissue repair mechanisms such as the anti-inflammatory response in peri-TBI lesion areas were examined by immunohistochemical analyses. Results: We observed that TBI groups given high and moderate doses of ISC-hpNSC had an improved swing bias on an elevated body swing test for motor function, increased scores on forelimb akinesia and paw grasp neurological tests, and committed significantly fewer errors on a radial arm water maze test for cognition. Furthermore, histological analyses indicated that high and moderate doses of stem cells increased the expression of phenotypic markers related to the neural lineage and myelination and decreased reactive gliosis and inflammation in the brain, increased neuronal survival in the peri-impact area of the cortex, and decreased inflammation in the spleen at 90 days post-TBI. Conclusion: These results provide evidence that high and moderate doses of ISC-hpNSC ameliorate TBI-associated histological alterations and motor, neurological, and cognitive deficits.
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited cardiomyopathy characterized by ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death in the young and in competitive athletes. The deleterious role of exercise in the natural history of ARVC is clear. Even in the absence of a demonstrated arrhythmogenic substrate, family history or mutations of ARVC, intense physical exercise may in some individuals lead to the development of right ventricular dysfunction and arrhythmogenicity. This led to question the benignity of some adaptive features of the athlete's heart. In fact, there is an overlap between typical aspects of the athlete's heart and pathological changes described in ARVC, being challenging to distinguish the two conditions. The aim of this review is to highlight the aspects that help to distinguish between athlete's heart and ARVC, to review the major findings on exams helping in the differential diagnosis and to determine the implications on eligibility for leisure and competitive sports.
Depressive symptoms are well documented among people living with HIV and some evidence suggests that youth living with HIV (YLWH) are more affected than their adult counterparts. Therefore, screening for depression is imperative among YLWH to ensure optimal health. The objective of this study is to compare the utility of the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) as depression screeners in an integrated care setting serving YLWH in the southeastern United States.
As a part of standard care, the CES-D and the PHQ were administered to YLWH. A Retrospective review of patient records was conducted. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and reports from mental health providers, researchers compared the utility of the screeners.
The sample consisted of 121 cases from 2017. Youth ranged in age from 12-25 (M = 20.68, SD = 2.75). Most were Black/African American (59.5%) males (56.2%) who acquired HIV behaviorally (51.2%). Sexual orientation was nearly evenly split between heterosexual (37.2%) and homosexual (34.7%). The CES-D demonstrated higher specificity and sensitivity for identifying clinical depression, yet, this was not significantly different from the PHQ, p = .09.
Generalizability of findings may be limited as the study sample included youth from a single integrated care setting.
Both the PHQ and the CES-D demonstrate utility for depression screening among YLWH. However, the PHQ may be preferable for use within a clinical setting.
While cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for many children and adolescents with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), therapeutic response is variable. Fear conditioning and extinction are central constructs underlying exposure-based CBT. Fear extinction learning assessed prior to CBT may be a useful predictor of CBT response for guiding treatment decisions.
Sixty-four youth who participated in a randomized placebo-controlled trial of CBT with and without d-cycloserine (DCS) completed a fear conditioning task. Skin conductance response (SCR) scores were used to measure fear acquisition and extinction to determine whether extinction learning could predict CBT response.
CBT responders and non-responders appeared to acquire conditioned fear SCRs in a similar manner. However, differences between treatment responders and non-responders emerged during the extinction phase. A responder (responder, non-responder) by conditioned stimulus type (CS+, CS-) interaction showed that CBT responders differentiated the stimulus paired with (CS+) and without (CS-) the unconditioned stimulus correctly during early and late extinction, whereas the CBT non-responders did not (p = .004).
While the small sample size makes conclusions tentative, this study supports an emerging literature that differential fear extinction may be an important factor underlying clinical correlates of pediatric OCD, including CBT response.
High water demand is a major challenge for the algae industry, so cultivating algae in wastewater can have the double benefit of biomass production and water remediation. The use of landfill leachate (LL), which is wastewater generated in landfills, was investigated to grow the microalga Picochlorum oculatum in a novel horizontal bioreactor (HBR), a low-cost modular cultivation system that reduces water evaporation and contamination risk thanks to its enclosed design. Pilot-scale (150 L) and commercial-scale (2000 L) HBRs that were operated outdoors in Florida using LL in batch and semi-continuous modes generated high cell density cultures (1.7·109 cells mL-1) and reached up to 1.9 g L-1 of dry biomass suitable for biofuel production. Demonstrating the ability of ample non-potable water sources, such as LL, to support algae cultivation is essential for improving the sustainability and cost-effectiveness of commercial algal biofuels and bioproducts, as freshwater resources become increasingly scarce.
Immunotherapy agents for treatment of cancer have been investigated for decades, but effective agents have only recently been identified and are increasingly being used in multiple cancer types. There is growing recognition of adverse side effects in multiple organ systems mediated by dysregulation of the immune system, which can be exacerbated by comorbidities often found in cancer patients such as chronic lung disease, diabetes, and hypertension. As a result, internists and other nononcology clinicians are routinely encountering immunotherapy patients who present with a remarkably wide range of symptoms. Here, we present the radiographic manifestations of common side effects from immunotherapy agents. An accurate diagnosis is critical in these often-complex clinical settings in which the consequences of the underlying cancer and other comorbidities must be distinguished from the variable manifestations of treatment toxicity.
Surgical site infections are associated with significant healthcare cost and burden. Silver-impregnated dressings have been associated with a decrease in surgical site infections in select populations, but it is unknown whether the benefit can be observed after cesarean deliveries.
We sought to evaluate the impact of silver nylon dressings in reducing superficial surgical site infections after cesarean delivery.
A blinded randomized clinical trial of women undergoing scheduled or unscheduled cesarean delivery at a single site was conducted. Women were recruited for participation from September 2013 to June 2016. Women with vertical skin incisions were excluded. Enrolled participants were randomized to silver nylon dressing or an identical-appearing gauze wound dressing. Wounds were evaluated in the outpatient office at 1 week and 6 weeks after delivery. The primary outcome was superficial surgical site infection as defined by Centers for Disease Control criteria at any time within the first 6 weeks after cesarean delivery. A sample size of 330 per group (n = 660) was planned to compare the 2 arms. Data were analyzed using the χ2, Fisher exact test, Student t test, Mann-Whitney U test, and logistic regression where appropriate, and a value of P &lt; .05 was considered significant.
Among the 657 participants, overall, the primary outcome was similar between the 2 groups (4.6% in the silver nylon group vs 4.2% in the gauze group, P = .96). Women allocated to silver nylon, when compared to those who were allocated to gauze, had similar rates of superficial surgical site infection within 1 week (1.2% vs 0.9%) and within 6 weeks ( 4.6% vs 4.2%) after delivery (P &gt;.99). The 2 groups were similar in age (30.9 ± 5.6 vs 31.0 ± 5.5 years, P = .95), body mass index (36.2 ± 8.7 vs 35.3 ± 8.2 kg/m2, P = .19), pregestational diabetes (6.2% vs 3.4%, P = .14), gestational diabetes (7.9% vs 7.3%, P = .88), cesarean delivery after labor (31.9% vs 31.1%, P = .86), presence of chorioamnionitis (5.2% vs 2.1% P = .06), and operative time (56.4 ± 20.6 vs 55.9 ± 17 minutes, P = .69). After adjusting for clinical and sociodemographic confounding variables, current smoking (adjusted odds ratio, 4.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.8-13.4) body mass index ≥40 kg/m2 (adjusted odds ratio, 3.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-6.8), and surgery length (minutes) (adjusted odds ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.002-1.04), but not use of gauze dressing, were associated with superficial surgical site infections.
Among women undergoing cesarean delivery, silver nylon dressing was not more effective than gauze in reducing the risk of superficial surgical site infections.
To examine the roles of both patient symptoms, and subjective appraisals of stress (self-efficacy, symptom barriers, symptom distress), in understanding well-being (anxiety, depression, cancer-specific quality of life, mental health quality of life, and physical health quality of life) in breast cancer patients.
We examined data from 104 female breast cancer patients. Using a stress process model, we hypothesized that while high levels of patient symptoms would be associated with poorer patient well-being, these effects would be mediated by subjective appraisals, including patient self-efficacy, perceived symptom barriers, and symptom distress.
As expected, higher levels of patient symptoms were associated with poorer well-being on all five indicators. Subjective appraisals of stress added significantly to predictors of well-being, and were mediators of this relationship across all five outcomes.
While patient symptoms are important predictors of patient well-being, subjective appraisals of the stressfulness of symptoms, and of patients' self-efficacy in managing symptoms, are also key factors. The findings suggest the utility of a stress process model in understanding well-being in breast cancer patients, and point to the potential value of targeting patient appraisals as well as symptoms to improve psychological well-being and quality of life.
Prescription opioid misuse (POM) remains a public health concern in the United States. Although the problem has been studied extensively, little research attention is paid to POM among African-Americans (AAs), and even fewer studies consider rural status in their analysis. The goal of this study, therefore, was to identify and compare prevalence and predictors of POM among rural and urban AA adults using data from a nationally representative sample.
Using pooled data across five years (2012-2016) of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, multivariate logistic regression models were estimated to determine which factors were associated with POM among AA adults.
Findings show that urban and rural AAs have comparable prevalence rates of POM, which is somewhat surprising given that POM often varies based on rural status. A number of factors (e.g., receiving government assistance, religiosity, smoking tobacco or marijuana, misuse of other prescription medications) were significantly correlated with POM for urban and rural AAs, while others (e.g., being age 50+, graduating high school, visiting an emergency department, being arrested, binge drinking) varied by rural status.
Results indicate that AA nonmedical prescription opioid users are not a monolith and have distinct demographic, clinical, and psychosocial profiles based on geographic region. Because AAs have been virtually ignored in the POM literature, our findings are an important step towards understanding POM among this understudied group. These results invite additional investigation into AA POM and encourage researchers to consider rural status in their analysis of POM among AAs.
Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is one of the most widely studied personality disorders (PDs). It recurrently shows traits of emotional lability, anxiety, separation insecurity, depressiveness, impulsiveness, risk exposure, and hostility, mainly affecting the domains of negative affectivity and antagonism.
To investigate the most discriminant dimensions of the Dimensional Clinical Personality Inventory (Inventário Dimensional Clínico da Personalidade 2 [IDCP-2]) to distinguish people diagnosed with BPD from people without this diagnosis.
A total of 305 participants were included in this study: psychiatric outpatients diagnosed with BPD (n = 30), psychiatric outpatients diagnosed with other PDs (n = 75), and a community sample (n = 200). BPD traits were assessed using the dependency, mood instability, and inconsequence dimensions of the IDCP-2.
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) comparisons indicated highest mean measures in the BPD group, and mood instability factors were the most discriminant ones when considering all groups. Applying the multiple regression analysis, we found an adjusted r 2 = 0.50, and hopelessness was the most predictive measure (β = 0.32; t = 6.19; p &lt; 0.001).
We found discriminatory capacity for factors of all dimensions, although at different levels, and more consistent results to discriminate the BPD group from the community sample.
Byrsonima intermedia is a species of bush popularly used to treat gastrointestinal disorders, such as gastric ulcers, gastritis, and diarrhea. Previous studies have revealed that the methanolic crude extract of B. intermedia leaves has gastroprotective and healing properties. In this new study, we specifically investigated two purified partitions, ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and water (AcoAq), obtained from the crude extract to characterize the antiulcer effects of these two partitions and the mechanisms of action of this medicinal plant. The healing effects of these partitions on the gastric and duodenal mucosa were assessed after ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) or acetic acid-induced injury. The involvement of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), interleukin 10 (IL-10), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and glutathione (GSH) levels were determined. The antibacterial activity against Helicobacter pylori was evaluated using microdilution methods. The phytochemical analysis of AcoAq revealed a predominance of oligomeric proanthocyanidins and galloyl quinic esters, whereas EtOAc was found to contain concentrated flavonoids. Both partitions led to a significant reduction in gastric lesions, but AcoAq was more effective than EtOAc with regard to anti-Helicobacter pylori activity in addition to protecting the gastric mucosa against ethanol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and duodenal mucosal damage induced by cysteamine. Additionally, both partitions were associated with a significant increase in gastric and duodenal healing and increased gastric mucosal GSH content after damage induced by acetic acid. On the other hand, after 6 days of treatment, EtOAc was more effective than AcoAq in ameliorating gastric damage upon initiation of the gastric I/R, which was accompanied by a significant reduction in the activity of gastric mucosal MPO, IL 1-β and TNF-alpha, as well as an elevation in IL-10 and GSH content. These results demonstrate that the oligomeric proanthocyanidins and galloyl quinic esters present in AcoAq were more effective in the prevention of gastric and duodenal ulcers due to the antioxidant effects of these compounds, whereas the flavonoids present in EtOAc were more effective due to their anti-inflammatory activity on the gastric and duodenal tissue. All these results confirm that the rich phytochemical diversity of B. intermedia contributes to the pharmacological actions of this medicinal plant on the gastrointestinal tract in addition to its activity against H. pylori.
We present here preparation of mechanically strong and biocompatible cryogel composites based on hyaluronic acid (HA) and halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) of various compositions, and their applications as scaffold for different cell growing media. Uniaxial compression tests reveal that the incorporation of HNTs into HA cryogels leads to a ~2.5-fold increase in their Young moduli, e.g., from 38 ± 1 to 99 ± 4 kPa at a HA:HNTs weight ratio of 1:2. Although HA:HNTs based cryogels were found to be blood compatible with 1.37 ± 0.11% hemolysis ratio at a HA:HNTs weight ratio of 1:2, they trigger thrombogenic activity with a blood clotting index of 17.3 ± 4.8. Remarkably, HA:HNTs cryogel composites were found to be excellent scaffold materials in the proliferation of rat mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa), and human colon cancer cells (HCT116). The cell studies revealed that an increased amount of HNT embedding into HA cryogels leads to an increase of MSC proliferation.
Numerous factors have, to date, been identified as playing a role in the regulation of Agr activity in Staphylococcus aureus, including transcription factors, antisense RNAs, and host elements. Herein we investigated the product of SAUSA300_1984 (termed MroQ), a transmembrane Abi-domain/M79 protease-family protein, as a novel effector of this system. Using a USA300 mroQ mutant, we observed a drastic reduction in proteolysis, hemolysis, and pigmentation that was fully complementable. This appears to result from diminished agr activity, as transcriptional analysis revealed significant decreases in expression of both RNAII and RNAIII in the mroQ mutant. Such effects appear to be direct, rather than indirect, as known agr effectors demonstrated limited alterations in their activity upon mroQ disruption. A comparison of RNA sequencing data sets for both mroQ and agr mutants revealed a profound overlap in their regulomes, with the majority of factors affected being known virulence determinants. Importantly, the preponderance of alterations in expression were more striking in the agr mutant, indicating that MroQ is necessary, but not sufficient, for Agr function. Mechanism profiling revealed that putative residues for metalloprotease activity within MroQ are required for its Agr-controlling effect; however, this was not wielded at the level of AgrD processing. Virulence assessment demonstrated that both mroQ and agr mutants exhibited increased formation of renal abscesses but decreased skin abscess formation alongside diminished dermonecrosis. Collectively, we present the characterization of a novel agr effector in S. aureus which would appear to be a direct regulator, potentially functioning via interaction with the AgrC histidine kinase.
The antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide are commonly associated with erectile dysfunction. The association of hydrochlorothiazide/amiloride is not associated with erectile dysfunction. The hypothesis is that amiloride has beneficial effect in penile erection and, therefore, counterbalances the hydrochlorothiazide-induced disruptive effect.
To investigate the effects of amiloride and its analogues hexamethylamiloride and benzamil on rat isolated corpus cavernosa (CC) and intracavernous pressure (ICP) in anaesthetized rats.
Rat isolated CC were incubated with amiloride, hexamethylamiloride, and benzamil (10 and 100 μmol/L each), followed by phenylephrine, potassium chloride, and electrical field stimulation (EFS). Their effect on the relaxant responses to EFS and sodium nitroprusside were also determined. Oral (30 mg/kg) and intraperitoneal (3 mg/kg) treatments with amiloride were also investigated on nerve-evoked ICP.
In vitro functional studies and in vivo ICP measurement on rat CC were performed. Additionally, phosphodiesterase type V isoform A1 activity and the mRNA expressions of Na+/H+ pump, epithelial sodium channel exchangers (ENaC) channels (α-, β- and γ subunits) and Na+/Ca2+ exchangers were evaluated in CC tissues.
Amiloride and its analogues significantly reduced the phenylephrine-, potassium chloride-, and EFS-induced CC contractions, which were not changed by nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (100 μmol/L) or indomethacin (6 μmol/L). In phenylephrine-precontracted CC tissues, amiloride itself caused concentration-dependent relaxation and significantly increased the EFS-induced relaxation. Oral and intraperitoneal treatment with amiloride significantly increased the ICP. Phosphodiesterase type V isoform A1 activity was not affected by amiloride. Na+/H+ pump, ENaC, and Na+/Ca2+ exchanger mRNA expressions were all detected in rat CC tissues.
Amiloride analogues may have therapeutic potential for erectile dysfunction.
The interesting effect of amiloride in penile erection was observed in both in vitro and in vivo methods. The evidence at the moment is restricted to rat CC.
Amiloride reduces in vitro CC contractility and enhances erectile function after oral and intraperitoneal administration, possibly via inhibition of ENaC.

Advances in understanding the mechanism, immunobiology, and pathophysiology of primary immunodeficiency diseases have created opportunities for the use of precision medicines for the treatment of disease-related manifestations. Modulation of the immune system to treat autoimmunity began with the use of intravenous immunoglobulin, improved with the development of monoclonal antibodies, and has now become standard in certain diseases with mechanistic-based targets that alter the molecular mechanism of disease. In this article, we review targeted therapies for disorders of hyperinflammation, primary immunodysregulatory diseases, and primary immunodeficiencies. We also look to the future where gene editing will tailor therapy in an even more precise way for each individual disease and patient.
Cold-regulated (COR) 15A is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) from Arabidopsis thaliana important for freezing tolerance. During freezing-induced cellular dehydration, COR15A transitions from a disordered to mostly α-helical structure. We tested whether mutations that increase the helicity of COR15A also increase its protective function. Conserved glycine residues were identified and mutated to alanine. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to identify residue-specific changes in helicity for wildtype (WT) COR15A and the mutants. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was used to monitor the coil⁻helix transition in response to increasing concentrations of trifluoroethanol (TFE) and ethylene glycol. The impact of the COR15A mutants on the stability of model membranes during a freeze⁻thaw cycle was investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy. The results of these experiments showed the mutants had a higher content of α-helical structure and the increased α-helicity improved membrane stabilization during freezing. Comparison of the TFE- and ethylene glycol-induced coil⁻helix transitions support our conclusion that increasing the transient helicity of COR15A in aqueous solution increases its ability to stabilize membranes during freezing. Altogether, our results suggest the conserved glycine residues are important for maintaining the disordered structure of COR15A but are also compatible with the formation of α-helical structure during freezing induced dehydration.
The disordered p53 transactivation domain (p53TAD) contains specific levels of transient helical secondary structure that are necessary for its binding to the negative regulators, mouse double minute 2 (Mdm2) and MdmX. The interactions of p53 with Mdm2 and MdmX are also modulated by posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of p53TAD including phosphorylation at S15, T18 and S20 that inhibits p53-Mdm2 binding. It is unclear whether the levels of transient secondary structure in p53TAD are changed by phosphorylation or other PTMs. We used phosphomimetic mutants to determine if adding a negative charge at positions 15 and 18 has any effect on the transient secondary structure of p53TAD and protein-protein binding. Using a combination of biophysical and structural methods, we investigated the effects of single and multisite phosphomimetics on the transient secondary structure of p53TAD and its interaction with Mdm2, MdmX, and the KIX domain. The phosphomimetics reduced Mdm2 and MdmX binding affinity by 3⁻5-fold, but resulted in minimal changes in transient secondary structure, suggesting that the destabilizing effect of phosphorylation on the p53TAD-Mdm2 interaction is primarily electrostatic. Phosphomimetics had no effect on the p53-KIX interaction, suggesting that increased binding of phosphorylated p53 to KIX may be influenced by decreased competition with its negative regulators.
Side population (SP) cells with stem-like properties, also known as cancer stem cells (CSC) have been recognized as drivers of the resistance phenotype in many cancers. Central to the characteristic stem-like phenotype of CSCs in cancer is the activity of the SOX2 transcription factor whose upregulation has been associated with enrichment of many oncogenes. This study outlines the fabrication of a lipoplex of SOX2 small interfering RNA (CL-siSOX2) for targeted treatment of SOX2-enriched, CSC-derived orthotopic and xenograft lung tumors in CB-17 SCID mice. CL-siSOX2 induced tumor contraction in cisplatin-naïve and cisplatin-treated groups by 85% and 94% respectively. Reduction in tumor weight and volume following treatment with CL-siSOX2 was associated with reduced protein expression of SOX2 and markers of tumor initiation, inflammation, invasion and metastasis in mice tumor xenografts. In addition, histological staining of lung tumor sections showed reduction in SOX2 expression was associated with inhibition markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.
I address a recent extension of the generalized context model (GCM), a model which excludes prototypes, to the visual short-term memory (VSTM) literature, which is currently deluged with prototype effects. The paper includes a brief review whose aim is to discuss the background and key findings suggesting that prototypes have an obligatory influence on visual short-term memory responses in the same VSTM task that the GCM's random walk extension, EBRW, was extended to account for: Sternberg scanning. I present a new model that incorporates such "central tendency representations" in memory, as well as several other regularities of the literature, and compare its prediction and postdictions to those of the GCM on some unpublished Sternberg scanning data. The GCM cannot account for the pattern in those data without post hoc modifications but the pattern is predicted nicely by the central tendency representation model. Although the new model is certainly wrong, the review and modeling exercise suggest a reconsideration of prototype models may be warranted, at least in the VSTM literature.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common age-related diseases that occurs because of the deposition of amyloid fibrils in a form of extracellular plaques containing β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) and tangles are found as intracellular deposit in the brain made up of twisted strands of aggregated microtubule binding protein. Scores of small molecule inhibitors have been designed for the treatment of AD. However some of these drugs cannot pass through the brain-blood-barrier (BBB). To overcome this problem, various nanoparticles (NPs) or nanomedicines (NMs) have been synthesized. These nanoparticles exploit the existing physiological mechanisms of passing through the BBB, including receptor- and adsorptive-mediated transcytosis that facilitate the transcellular transport of nanoparticle from the blood to the brain. During the last decades, varieties of nanoparticles that differ in the composition have been developed, and they have the potential application in the diagnostics and therapy of AD. The most common NP formulations that have major impact in the diagnosis and therapy of AD include polymeric NPs (PPs), gold NPs, gadolinium NPs, selenium NPs, protein-based NPs, polysaccharide-based NPs, etc. The goal of this review is to provide discussion of the application of different types of NP formulations in the diagnosis and therapy of AD.
Risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), the most prevalent dementia, is partially driven by genetics. To identify LOAD risk loci, we performed a large genome-wide association meta-analysis of clinically diagnosed LOAD (94,437 individuals). We confirm 20 previous LOAD risk loci and identify five new genome-wide loci (IQCK, ACE, ADAM10, ADAMTS1, and WWOX), two of which (ADAM10, ACE) were identified in a recent genome-wide association (GWAS)-by-familial-proxy of Alzheimer's or dementia. Fine-mapping of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region confirms the neurological and immune-mediated disease haplotype HLA-DR15 as a risk factor for LOAD. Pathway analysis implicates immunity, lipid metabolism, tau binding proteins, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, showing that genetic variants affecting APP and Aβ processing are associated not only with early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease but also with LOAD. Analyses of risk genes and pathways show enrichment for rare variants (P = 1.32 × 10-7), indicating that additional rare variants remain to be identified. We also identify important genetic correlations between LOAD and traits such as family history of dementia and education.
To explore the perceptions of the constraining and facilitating factors to patient-centered communication in clinical encounters of patients with type 2 diabetes and the providers involved in their care.
Patients (n = 12) and providers (n = 33) involved in diabetes care in northern Portugal.
Seven focus groups.
Grounded theory, using open, axial, and selective coding.
Patients focused on the patient-provider relationship, while providers emphasized the constraining factors when exchanging information and the facilitating factors regarding disease and treatment-related behavior. Patients and providers both agreed on some constraints (power imbalance, avoidance of criticism, disease minimization, use of jargon, and insufficient competencies and consistency among providers) and facilitators (seeing patients as persons, providing tailored information in plain language, and recognizing the "wake-up call"). Patients perceived an aggressive attitude as a barrier to communication, but providers perceived it as a facilitator. Patients included issues related to trust, respect, and psychosocial support as important factors to them. Only providers mentioned the influence of macro-level interventions and patients' socioeconomic position as essential factors.
Improvements in patient-centered communication depend on fostering the patient-provider relationship, patients' participation and involvement, and training providers' communication skills.
Atypical Spitzoid lesions pose a distinct challenge in classification as they may comprise a mixture of both classic benign nevus and cutaneous melanoma characteristics. Immunostaining and molecular analysis, such as comparative genomic hybridization, can assist in narrowing the differential diagnosis. We present a case of a 5-year-old male with an atypical Spitzoid lesion on his back. Initial histopathology revealed a relatively symmetric lesion with mitotic figures and poor maturation of melanocytes with descent into the dermis. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated a loss of p16, and array comparative genomic hybridization revealed a loss of chromosome 9, supporting a diagnosis of invasive melanoma arising in conjunction with a remnant of a conventional melanocytic nevus. This case is the first in Canada to demonstrate the use of array comparative genomic hybridization for diagnosing melanoma in a young paediatric patient.
Reproduction is a defining process of biological systems. Every generation, across all species, breeding females repopulate ecosystems with offspring. r/K selection was the first theory to classify animal species by linking the rates with which breeding females repopulated ecosystems, to the stability of ecosystems. Here, I introduce a species classification scheme that extends the reach of r-K selection and CSR selection by linking breeder investments in offspring quantity, quality, and diversity to specific natural selection pressures. The species classification scheme is predicated on the assumption that high rates of predation favor breeders that invest more in offspring quantity than quality; and that spatiotemporal scarcity favors breeders that investment more in offspring quality than quantity. I present equations that convert the species classification scheme into a maternal risk-management model. Thereafter, using the equations, I classify eighty-seven animal species into the model's natural selection categories. Species of reptiles, fish, and marine invertebrates clustered in the predation selection category. Species of birds and mammals clustered in the scarcity selection category. Several species of apex predators clustered in the weak selection category. Several species of social insects and social mammals clustered in the convergent selection category. In summary, by acknowledging breeding females as the individuals upon which natural selection acts to repopulate ecosystems with offspring, the proposed maternal risk-management model offers a testable, theoretical framework for the field of ecology.
CVT-301 (Inbrija) is a self-administered orally inhaled levodopa approved for the intermittent treatment of OFF episodes in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) treated with carbidopa/levodopa. Prior studies only evaluated CVT-301 after the first ON of the day.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CVT-301 for early morning OFF. Using a randomized, double-blind, 2-way crossover design, eligible patients in the morning OFF state (having not received PD medication overnight) received a single dose of CVT-301 84 mg or placebo on 2 dosing days, immediately after their first morning oral carbidopa/levodopa dose. Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events, vital signs, and patient- and examiner-reported dyskinesia. An exploratory efficacy assessment was examiner-rated time-to-ON with carbidopa/levodopa + CVT-301 vs carbidopa/levodopa + placebo.
Of the 36 patients (mean age 62.9 years) who enrolled and completed the study, 9 (25.0%) reported treatment-emergent adverse events following CVT-301 administration; 4 (11.1%) reported treatment-emergent adverse events following placebo. The most common adverse event was cough (4 [11.1%] for CVT-301 vs 1 [2.8%] for placebo), which was typically mild and transient. Incidence of asymptomatic orthostatic hypotension (CVT-301, 6; placebo, 7) and examiner-rated dyskinesia were similar for both (36-39% mild, 3-6% moderate, and 0% severe). Median time-to-ON was 25.0 min following carbidopa/levodopa + CVT-301 and 35.5 min following carbidopa/levodopa + placebo (P = 0.26). At 30 min, more patients had turned ON following carbidopa/levodopa + CVT-301 administration (66.7%), compared with carbidopa/levodopa + placebo (44.5%) (P = 0.040).
Single doses of CVT-301 84 mg administered with oral carbidopa/levodopa for early morning OFF symptoms were well-tolerated, with no notable safety concerns.
Persons with advanced dementia cannot initiate activities because of the executive dysfunction. The lack of activities was identified as one of the most important factors contributing to behavioral problems of these persons. The unmet needs were boredom/sensory deprivation, loneliness/need for social interaction, and need for meaningful activities. There is a need for activities designed specifically for residents with advanced dementia.
A description of patient's needs and of programs that intend to maintain quality of life for people with dementia and facing death.
A literature review of programs used for persons with advanced dementia and residing in long-term facilities, using the PubMed data base and collateral sources.
Since palliative care is appropriate for persons with advanced dementia, attention has to be paid to three following important aspects of care: Medical issues, behavioral symptoms, and meaningful activities. Medical interventions should be limited to those which have more benefits than burdens, behavioral symptoms should be distinguished according to the context in which they occur, and treated by non-pharmacological interventions that involve meaningful activities. This review describes four programs that may promote the quality of life in persons with advanced dementia and facing death. They are designed for persons with advanced dementia, taking into account their functional impairments. Most of these programs involve short infrequent sessions. In contrast, Namaste Care is a daily extended program of enhanced nursing care that can provide quality of life until the last breath.
It is possible to maintain quality life for people with advanced dementia if a special program of activities is available.
The p53 tumor suppressor is a sequence-specific DNA binding protein that activates gene transcription to regulate cell survival and proliferation. Dynamic control of p53 degradation and DNA binding in response to stress signals are critical for tumor suppression. The p53 N terminus (NT) contains two transactivation domains (TAD1 and TAD2), a proline-rich region (PRR), and multiple phosphorylation sites. Previous work revealed the p53 NT reduced DNA binding in vitro. Here, we show that TAD2 and the PRR inhibit DNA binding by directly interacting with the sequence-specific DNA binding domain (DBD). NMR spectroscopy revealed that TAD2 and the PRR interact with the DBD at or near the DNA binding surface, possibly acting as a nucleic acid mimetic to competitively block DNA binding. In vitro and in vivo DNA binding analyses showed that the NT reduced p53 DNA binding affinity but improved the ability of p53 to distinguish between specific and nonspecific sequences. MDMX inhibits p53 binding to specific target promoters but stimulates binding to nonspecific chromatin sites. The results suggest that the p53 NT regulates the affinity and specificity of DNA binding by the DBD. The p53 NT-interacting proteins and posttranslational modifications may regulate DNA binding, partly by modulating the NT-DBD interaction.
The rapid expansion of transcriptomics and affordability of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies generate rocketing amounts of gene expression data across biology and medicine, including cancer research. Concomitantly, many bioinformatics tools were developed to streamline gene expression and quantification. We tested the concordance of NGS RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis outcomes between two predominant programs for read alignment, HISAT2, and STAR, and two most popular programs for quantifying gene expression in NGS experiments, edgeR and DESeq2, using RNA-seq data from breast cancer progression series, which include histologically confirmed normal, early neoplasia, ductal carcinoma in situ and infiltrating ductal carcinoma samples microdissected from formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) breast tissue blocks. We identified significant differences in aligners' performance: HISAT2 was prone to misalign reads to retrogene genomic loci, STAR generated more precise alignments, especially for early neoplasia samples. edgeR and DESeq2 produced similar lists of differentially expressed genes, with edgeR producing more conservative, though shorter, lists of genes. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed no skewness in significant GO terms identified among differentially expressed genes by edgeR versus DESeq2. As transcriptomics of FFPE samples becomes a vanguard of precision medicine, choice of bioinformatics tools becomes critical for clinical research. Our results indicate that STAR and edgeR are well-suited tools for differential gene expression analysis from FFPE samples.
ERCP is considered the first-line therapy for biliary duct leaks (BDLs). However, the optimal ERCP timing and endotherapy methods remain controversial. Our aim was to evaluate these factors as predictors of poor clinical outcomes after BDLs.
Adults who underwent ERCP for BDLs after cholecystectomy were identified from Nationwide Inpatient Sample 2000 to 2014. ERCP was classified as emergent, urgent, and expectant if it was done within 1 day, on day 2 to 3, or &gt;3 days after BDL, respectively. Endotherapy was classified into sphincterotomy, stent, or combination. Post-ERCP adverse events (AEs) were defined as requiring pressor infusion, endotracheal intubation, invasive monitoring or hemodialysis. Early endotherapy failure was defined as the need for salvage surgical or radiology-percutaneous biliary intervention after ERCP.
A total of 1,028 patients with median age of 56 were included. ERCP was done emergently (19%), urgently (30%), and expectantly (51%). Endotherapy procedures were sphincterotomy (24%), biliary stent (24%), and combination (52%). Post-ERCP AEs were 11%,10%, and 9% for emergent, urgent, and expectant ERCP, respectively (p=0.577). In-hospital mortality showed a U-shape trend with 5%, 0%, and 2% for emergent, urgent, and expectant ERCP, respectively (p&lt;0.001). Combination and stent monotherapy had lower failure rates of 3% and 4% (respectively) as compared with sphincterotomy monotherapy with failure rate of 11% (p&lt;0.001). When multivariate analysis was used, both combination (odd ratio (OR), 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1-0.5) and stent monotherapy (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.9) were less likely to fail as compared with sphincterotomy monotherapy. There were no statistically significant differences between combination therapy and stent monotherapy in the univariate and the multivariate analysis.
Although limited by retrospective design and the possibility of selection bias, this analysis suggests that the timing of ERCP is not a significant predictor of post-ERCP AEs after BDLs. Furthermore, combination or stent monotherapy had lower failure rates as compared with sphincterotomy monotherapy.
t is now increasingly evident that a large fraction of the human proteome comprises proteins that, under physiological conditions, lack fixed, ordered 3D structures as a whole or have segments that are not likely to form a defined 3D structure [...].
An increasing amount of evidence suggests that migraines are a response to a cerebral energy deficiency or oxidative stress levels that exceed antioxidant capacity. The ketogenic diet (KD), a diet mimicking fasting that leads to the elevation of ketone bodies (KBs), is a therapeutic intervention targeting cerebral metabolism that has recently shown great promise in the prevention of migraines. KBs are an alternative fuel source for the brain, and are thus likely able to circumvent some of the abnormalities in glucose metabolism and transport found in migraines. Recent research has shown that KBs-D-β-hydroxybutyrate in particular-are more than metabolites. As signalling molecules, they have the potential to positively influence other pathways commonly believed to be part of migraine pathophysiology, namely: mitochondrial functioning, oxidative stress, cerebral excitability, inflammation and the gut microbiome. This review will describe the mechanisms by which the presence of KBs, D-BHB in particular, could influence those migraine pathophysiological mechanisms. To this end, common abnormalities in migraines are summarised with a particular focus on clinical data, including phenotypic, biochemical, genetic and therapeutic studies. Experimental animal data will be discussed to elaborate on the potential therapeutic mechanisms of elevated KBs in migraine pathophysiology, with a particular focus on the actions of D-BHB. In complex diseases such as migraines, a therapy that can target multiple possible pathogenic pathways seems advantageous. Further research is needed to establish whether the absence/restriction of dietary carbohydrates, the presence of KBs, or both, are of primary importance for the migraine protective effects of the KD.
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has been widely used as postinjury treatment; however, we investigate its ability to mitigate potential damage as a preconditioning option. Here, we tested the hypothesis that HBOT preconditioning mitigates cell death in primary rat neuronal cells (PRNCs) through the transfer of mitochondria from astrocytes.
Primary rat neuronal cells were subjected to a 90-minute HBOT treatment at 2.5 absolute atmospheres prior to either tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injury to simulate the inflammation-plagued secondary cell death associated with stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI). After incubation with TNF-alpha or LPS, the cell viability of each group was examined.
There was a significant increase of cell viability accompanied by mitochondrial transfer in the injury groups that received HBOT preconditioning compared to the injury alone groups (44 ± 5.2 vs 68 ± 4.48, n = 20, P &lt; 0.05). The transfer of mitochondria directly after HBOT treatment was visualized by capturing images in 5-minute intervals, which revealed that the robust transfer of mitochondria begins soon after HBOT and persisted throughout the treatment.
This study shows that HBOT preconditioning stands as a robust prophylactic treatment for sequestration of inflammation inherent in stroke and TBI, possibly facilitating the transfer of resilient mitochondria from astrocytes to inflammation-susceptible neuronal cells in mitigating cell death.
The elimination of specific contaminants from competitors poses a significant challenge. Rather than relying on a single direct interaction, the cooperation of multiple functionalities is an emerging strategy for adsorbents design to achieve the required affinity. Here, we describe that the interaction with the target species can be altered by modifying the local environment of the direct contact site, as demonstrated by manipulating the affinity of pyridinium-based anion nanotraps toward pertechnetate. Systematic control of the substituent effect allows the resulting anion nanotraps to combine multiple features, overcoming the long-term challenge of TcO4- segregation under extreme conditions of super acidity and basicity, strong irradiation field, and high ionic strength. The top material exhibits the highest sorption capacity together with record-high extraction efficiencies after a single treatment from conditions relevant to the used nuclear fuel (Hanford tank wastes, 95%) and legacy nuclear wastes (Savannah River Sites, 80%) among materials reported thus far.
Recent experimental and theoretical work has demonstrated significant potential to tune the properties of silicon and germanium by adjusting the mesostructure, nanostructure, and/or crystalline structure of these group 14 elements. Despite the promise to achieve enhanced functionality with these already technologically important elements, a significant challenge lies in the identification of effective synthetic approaches that can access metastable silicon and germanium-based extended solids with a particular crystal structure or specific nano/meso-structured features. In this context, the class of intermetallic compounds known as Zintl phases has provided a platform for discovery of novel silicon and germanium-based materials. This review highlights some of the ways in which silicon and germanium-based Zintl phases have been utilized as precursors in innovative approaches to synthesize new crystalline modifications, nanoparticles, nanosheets, and mesostructured and nanoporous extended solids with properties that can be very different from the ground states of the elements.
Heart failure (HF) has a strong association with the development of lower urinary tract symptoms, especially overactive bladder (OAB); although this condition remains poorly investigated. In this study, we assess the aortocaval fistula (ACF) model as a novel experimental model of micturition dysfunction, associated with HF, focused on the molecular and functional studies to evaluate the autonomic nervous system and urinary bladder remodeling. Male rats were submitted to ACF for HF induction. Echocardiography, cystometric, histomorphometry and molecular analysis, as well as concentration-response curves to carbachol and ATP and frequency-response curves to electrical field stimulation (EFS) were evaluated in Sham and HF (4- and 12-weeksendpoint) groups. Compared to SHAM, HF groups exhibited progressive increases in the left ventricle (LV) mass and fractional shortening which indicates cardiac dysfunction, although HF was characterized only after 12 weeks by the reduced ejection fraction. For micturition function, HF groups presented increased non-voiding contractions (NVC) and decreased bladder capacity; however, when comparing HF groups, these urinary parameters were significantly impaired over the weeks (12-weeks). The contractile responses induced by CCh, ATP and EFS were greater in detrusor muscle (DSM) from HF rats. mRNA expression for muscarinic receptors (M2 and M3) was higher in DSM only after 12 weeks of ACF, in addition to MMP9 and TGF-beta. Histomorphometric revealed increased urothelium thickness in both HF groups, whereas DSM thickness occurred only after 12 weeks. Thus, the ACF model induced cardiac dyfunction with progressive micturition dysfunction over the weeks, characterized by increased DSM contractile mechanisms as well as extracellular matrix remodeling in the urinary bladder, representing a useful tool to evaluate the OAB associated with HF.
Clinical studies examining the interaction between traumatic brain injury and stress-related disorders such as PTSD are often complicated by methodological constraints such as heterogeneity in injury type and severity, time post-trauma, and predisposing risk factors. Developing relevant animal models whereby many variables can be efficiently controlled is thus essential towards understanding this elusive relationship. Here, we use our repeated unpredictable stress (RUS) paradigm, in combination with our established mouse model of repetitive mild TBI (r-mTBI), to assess the impact of repeated exposures to these paradigms on behavioral and neurobiological measures. C57BL/6J male mice were exposed to RUS and r-mTBI at 3 and 6-month of age followed by batteries of behavioral testing. Mice were euthanized 10 days and 3 months post-exposure, with brain and plasma samples collected for molecular profiling. The RUS paradigm involved exposure to a predator odor (TMT) whilst under restraint, daily unstable social housing, five inescapable footshocks on separate days, and chronic social isolation. Animals receiving r-mTBI (x5) and stress were exposed to a single closed head injury 1hr after each footshock. Stress-alone mice showed significant weight loss, recall of traumatic memories, anxiety-like and passive stress-coping behavior when compared to control mice. However, in stress+r-mTBI animals, the changes in cued fear memory, anxiety and stress-coping tests were diminished, possibly due to TBI-induced hyperactivity. We also report complex brain molecular and neuropathological findings. Stress and r-mTBI either individually or comorbidly were associated with a chronic reduction in dendritic spine, GluN2A/GluN2B ratio in the hippocampus. While stress augmented the r-mTBI-dependent astrogliosis in the corpus callosum, it mitigated r-mTBI-induced increases in hippocampal proBDNF. We anticipate that our model will be a good platform to untangle the complex comorbid pathophysiology in stress disorders and r-mTBI.
Current study aimed to analyze the synergistic killing of pathogenic Escherichia coli using camel lactoferrin from different Saudi camel clans and various antibiotics. Methods: using multiple microbiological and protein analysis techniques, the results were shown that the purified camel lactoferrins (cLfs) from different Saudi camel have strong antimicrobial potentials against two strains of E. coli. Although all cLfs were superior relative to human or bovine lactoferrins (hLf or bLf), there was no noticeable difference in the antimicrobial potentials of cLfs from different camel clans. The effects of antibiotics and cLfs were synergistic, indicating the superiority of using cLf-antibiotic combinations against E. coli growth. Since these combinations possessed distinguished synergy profiles, it is likely that they can be used to enhance the low efficacy of antibiotics, as well as to control the problems associated with bacterial resistance. Furthermore, these combinations can reduce the cost of cure of bacterial infections, especially in the developing countries. The analysis of the molecular mechanisms of lactoferrin action revealed that expression of several E. coli proteins was affected by the treatment with these antibacterial factors. Several proteins of different molecular weights interacting with cLf-biotin were found. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed the presence of noticeable morphological changes associated with the treatment of E. coli strains by antibiotic carbenicillin or cLf alone, and in combination. Camel lactoferrin has superior potential killing of E. coli over bovine and human lactoferrin, and this potential can be further synergistically enhanced of cLF is combined with antibiotics.
Academic achievement for young dual language learners (DLL) is a critically acknowledged problem of national significance that has been understudied. To address this shortage, this study evaluated the effectiveness of Preparing Pequeños, an integrated small-group instruction program designed to promote increased learning for Spanish speaking DLL in language, literacy, and math. The DLL in the randomized Preparing Pequeños intervention classrooms were compared to control DLL with comparable Spanish language delays and in which the school district's core curriculum was being implemented. Intervention teachers and paraprofessionals, as part of Preparing Pequeños, implemented new classroom and time management systems in order to conduct 90 min of small-group instruction four days each week across the school year. In total, 51 control and 52 intervention classrooms participated; pre-test measures were completed with 829 children, with 777 of these children also completing post-test measures (7% attrition). Results showed that intervention teachers and paraprofessionals, as compared to control, showed greater increases in most of the targeted areas of cognitive instruction (d range = 0.60-2.38) and in the use of small groups (d range = 3.32-4.46), progress monitoring (d = 0.17) to inform instruction, and team teaching (d = 1.94). Intervention children, as compared to control, showed significantly greater gains in Spanish oral language, print knowledge, phonological awareness, and phonics with small to large effect sizes (d range = 0.14-0.52). Also, potentially as a result of greater attention to children's individual needs and support for managing their behavior, intervention children, as compared to control, showed greater decreases in school avoidance, anger, and aggression with small effect sizes (d range = -0.22 to -0.29). Results are discussed in relation to the need for greater attention in teachers' training in effective approaches for small-group instruction.
A squaramide-decorated COF was synthesized and used as a highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst for hydrogen-bonding organocatalysis as exemplified in the context of catalyzing Michael addition reactions under mild conditions. Our work lays a foundation for the development of functional COFs as a new platform for biomimetic organocatalysis.
The unified saccharification and fermentation (USF) system was developed for direct production of ethanol from agarose. This system contains an enzymatic saccharification process that uses three types of agarases and a fermentation process by recombinant yeast. The pGMFα-HGN plasmid harboring AGAH71 and AGAG1 genes encoding β-agarase and the NABH558 gene encoding neoagarobiose hydrolase was constructed and transformed into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae 2805 strain. Three secretory agarases were produced by introducing an S. cerevisiae signal sequence, and they efficiently degraded agarose to galactose, 3,6-anhydro- L-galactose (AHG), neoagarobiose, and neoagarohexose. To directly produce ethanol from agarose, the S. cerevisiae 2805/pGMFα-HGN strain was cultivated into YP-containing agarose medium at 40°C for 48 h (for saccharification) and then 30°C for 72 h (for fermentation). During the united cultivation process for 120 h, a maximum of 1.97 g/l ethanol from 10 g/l agarose was produced. This is the first report on a single process containing enzymatic saccharification and fermentation for direct production of ethanol without chemical liquefaction (pretreatment) of agarose.
Two highly conserved structural motifs observed in members of the EF-hand family of calcium binding proteins. The motifs provide a supporting scaffold for the Ca2+ binding loops and contribute to the hydrophobic core of the EF-hand domain. Each structural motif represents a cluster of three amino acids called cluster I ('black' cluster) and cluster II ('grey' cluster). Cluster I is more conserved and mostly incorporates aromatic amino acids. In contrast, cluster II is noticeably less conserved and includes a mix of aromatic, hydrophobic, and polar amino acids of different sizes. In the human calcium binding S100 P protein, these 'black' and 'gray' clusters include residues F15, F71, and F74 and L33, L58, and K30, respectively. To evaluate the effects of these clusters on structure and functionality of human S100 P, we have performed Ala scanning. The resulting mutants were studied by a multiparametric approach that included circular dichroism, scanning calorimetry, dynamic light scattering, chemical crosslinking, and fluorescent probes. Spectrofluorimetric Ca2+-titration of wild type S100 P showed that S100 P dimer has 1-2 strong calcium binding sites (K1 = 4 × 106 M-1) and two cooperative low affinity (K2 = 4 × 104 M-1) binding sites. Similarly, the S100 P mutants possess two types of calcium binding sites. This analysis revealed that the alanine substitutions in the clusters I and II caused comparable changes in the S100 P functional properties. However, analysis of heat- or GuHCl-induced unfolding of these proteins showed that the alanine substitutions in the cluster I caused notably more pronounced decrease in the protein stability compared to the changes caused by alanine substitutions in the cluster II. Opposite to literature data, the F15 A substitution did not cause the S100 P dimer dissociation, indicating that F15 is not crucial for dimer stability. Overall, similar to parvalbumins, the S100 P cluster I is more important for protein conformational stability than the cluster II.
50% of liver cancer is caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV). Baby boomers are at increased risk and are recommended for one-time HCV screening. However, &lt;13% of baby boomers were screened in 2015.
We are updating a previous study using 2013-2015 NHIS data to examine HCV screening prevalence by birth cohort, with 2016 data. We used logistic regression to evaluate whether HCV screening prevalence changed over time, stratified by birth cohort.
The sample consisted of 132,742 participants from 2013-2016. Screening increased in baby boomers from 11.9 to 14.1%. Odds of HCV screening for baby boomers was significantly associated with age, gender, race/ethnicity, and other variables and increased significantly with each subsequent year (aOR = 1.21, aOR = 1.33, aOR = 1.42, consecutively). While HCV screening is increasing over time, there is still room for improvement and future interventions should focus on increasing HCV screening among groups demonstrating significantly lower screening prevalence.
The anticoagulation strategies for various cardiac-specific pathologies including atrial fibrillation are changing. Applying these strategies in patients with concomitant active cancer requires additional considerations. Here, we review the most recent changes in the anticoagulation management of common cardiac diseases and their application in cancer patients.
There are a range of indications for therapeutic anticoagulation in cancer patients including venous thromboembolism (VTE), atrial fibrillation/flutter (AF/AFL), prosthetic heart valves, and intracardiac thrombi. Certain cancer therapeutics such as ibrutinib and anthracycline chemotherapy increase the risk of developing AF/AFL and pose unique challenges in anticoagulation management. Anticoagulation decisions for AF/AFL often utilize the CHADS2 or the CHA2DS2-VASc score with annualized stroke risk; however, these risk stratification models may be inadequate in cancer patients. Cancer type, stage, prognosis, and bleeding risk are all relevant when considering whether to initiate therapeutic anticoagulation. Moreover, thrombocytopenia may limit the ability to provide anticoagulation. Subsequent analyses of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) show fewer bleeding complications and thromboembolic events compared to warfarin in AF/AFL with apixaban and edoxaban particularly promising in this population for VTE, pulmonary embolism, and AF/AFL. There is a lack of data regarding ablation therapy and left atrial occlusion devices in this population. There is a growing experience of DOACs for intracardiac thrombi. Warfarin is still appropriate for patients with prosthetic heart valves and left ventricular assist devices. Anticoagulation management in the cancer patient can be challenging. DOACs are often a safe alternative to warfarin in cancer-associated DVT/PE and AF/AFL, and may be preferable in certain circumstances. Other cardiac indications for anticoagulation including the presence of a mechanical heart valve remain unchanged and dependent on warfarin or heparin-based products.
The ultrastructure of the spermatozoon of Allopodocotyle tunisiensis (Digenea, Opecoelidae), an intestinal parasite of Solea aegyptiaca (Teleostei, Soleidae), is described by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The mature spermatozoon is a filiform cell that exhibits two axonemes of different length with the 9+'1' pattern of trepaxonematan Platyhelminthes. In the anterior spermatozoon extremity, cortical microtubules are absent. They appear after the disappearance of an anterior electron-dense material, being initially in a continuous and submembranous layer. They surround only partially the sperm cell. Later, these cortical microtubules are distributed into two bundles. Additionally, the spermatozoon of A. tunisiensis shows two mitochondria, a nucleus, an external ornamentation of the plasma membrane, spine-like bodies, and a large amount of glycogen granules. According to the location of the external ornamentation, A. tunisiensis presents a Quilichini et al.'s type 2 spermatozoon. With respect to the posterior extremity, the sperm cell of A. tunisiensis corresponds to the Quilichini et al.'s opecoelid type. The morphology of the first mitochondrion with a U-shaped posterior extremity is described for the first time in a digenean spermatozoon.
In stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with concomitant chemoradiotherapy, there is a high rate of relapse. Some of these relapses are only local and can be treated by stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR). Previous studies reporting outcome after SABR reirradiation of the thorax consisted of a heterogeneous population of various lung cancer stages or even different types of cancer. The purpose of study is to evaluate toxicity and outcome of this strategy in locally relapsed stage III NSCLC only.
From February 2007 to November 2015, 46 Stage III NSCLC patients treated with SABR, for lung recurrence following conventionally fractionated radiation therapy (CFRT), were retrospectively analyzed.
Median follow-up was 47.3 months (1-76.9). The 2 and 4-year progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were of 25.5%/8.6 and 48.9%/30.8%, respectively. Highest presenting toxicity in patients (grade 1 through 5) was: 13 (28.3%), 7 (15.2%), 1 (2.2%), 0 and 2 (4.4%), with deaths due to hemoptysis (n = 1) and alveolitis (n = 1). Although the Biological Effective Dose (at Planning Tumor Volume isocenter) was lower for central tumors treated for an in-field relapse (n = 21, 116 Gy versus 168 Gy, p = 0.005), they had no significant difference in OS than the remaining cohort, but with a higher rate of grade 2-5 toxicities (OR = 0.22, [0.06-0.8], p = 0.02).
Reirradiation with SABR for local relapse in patients previously treated for stage III NSCLC, is feasible and associated with good outcome. This is also true for central tumors treated for an in-field relapse, but should be radiated with caution to mitigate toxicity.
To reduce acquisition time and to improve image quality in sodium magnetic resonance imaging (23Na MRI) using an iterative reconstruction algorithm for multi-channel data sets based on compressed sensing (CS) with anatomical 1H prior knowledge.
An iterative reconstruction for 23Na MRI with multi-channel receiver coils is presented. Based on CS it utilizes a second order total variation (TV(2)), adopted by anatomical weighting factors (AnaWeTV(2)) obtained from a high-resolution 1H image. A support region is included as additional regularization. Simulated and measured 23Na multi-channel data sets (n = 3) of the female breast acquired at 7 T with different undersampling factors (USF = 1.8/3.6/7.2/14.4) were reconstructed and compared to a conventional gridding reconstruction. The structural similarity was used to assess image quality of the reconstructed simulated data sets and to optimize the weighting factors for the CS reconstruction.
Compared with a conventional TV(2), the AnaWeTV(2) reconstruction leads to an improved image quality due to preserving of known structure and reduced partial volume effects. An additional incorporated support region shows further improvements for high USFs. Since the decrease in image quality with higher USFs is less pronounced compared to a conventional gridding reconstruction, proposed algorithm is beneficial especially for higher USFs. Acquisition time can be reduced by a factor of 4 (USF = 7.2), while image quality is still similar to a nearly fully sampled (USF = 1.8) gridding reconstructed data set.
Especially for high USFs, the proposed algorithm allows improved image quality for multi-channel 23Na MRI data sets.
Stroke remains a significant unmet clinical need with limited therapeutic options. The peculiar feature of ischemic stroke is the interruption in brain circulation, resulting in a cascade of detrimental cerebrovasculature alterations. Treatment strategies designed to maintain potency of the cerebrovasculature may protect against stroke. The present study assessed the effects of short bouts of exercise prior to stroke induction and characterized cerebral blood flow and motor functions in vivo. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to a single short bout of exercise (30-min or 60-min forced running wheel) then subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Non-exercise stroke rats served as controls while non-stroke rats represented shams. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was evaluated by laser Doppler at baseline (prior to MCAO), during MCAO, and during reperfusion. Behavioral tests using the elevated body swing test was conducted at baseline, day 0 (day of stroke), and at days 1 and 3 after stroke. Animals that received exercise displayed typical alterations in CBF after stroke, but exhibited improved motor performance compared to non-exercise rats. Exercised stroke rats showed a reduction in infarct size and an increased number of surviving cells in the peri-infarct area, with a trend towards prolonged duration of the exercise. Immunofluorescence staining and Western blot analysis of the peri-infarct area revealed increased levels of endothelial markers/angiogenesis markers, VEGF, VEGFR-2, and Ang-2, and endothelial progenitor cell marker CD34+ in exercise groups compared with the controls. These results demonstrated that prophylactic exercise affords neuroprotection possibly by improving cerebrovascular potency.
The use of immunosuppressing agents can act as a catalyst for viral reactivation, promoting systemic infection with organ involvement. Current literature remains sparse on this topic but does provide individual case reports involving single viruses. We present the case of an immunocompromised patient with skin lesions, pancreatitis, colitis and hepatitis. Work-up revealed varicella zoster virus, which likely put the patient at risk for multi-organ involvement, as well as clinical suspicion of other implicated viruses, specifically herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus. A high clinical index of suspicion along with biopsy guidance for viral involvement in immunocompromised patients is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment of these conditions.
Efficacy of medical student substance use interventions in the emergency department (ED) setting remains unstudied.
In this pilot study, we set out to determine whether medical students could perform a brief motivational interview for substance use in the ED.
At two hospitals, medical students utilized motivational interviewing skills taught by their medical school curriculum and administered a substance use intervention to ED patients who met the study definition of unhealthy substance use.
In 6 weeks, medical students gave a brief intervention to 102 subjects. The mean age of the subjects was 46.9 (standard deviation 15.6) years. The majority, 86 (86.3%) identified as white. Fifty-four (52.9%) identified as male. Eighty of 102 (78.4%) participants completed a phone follow-up assessment. Of the 69 smokers, 11 (15.9%) reported attempting to quit or quitting completely. Of the 33 with high-risk alcohol use, 11 (33.3%) were abstaining completely from alcohol use and an additional 12 (36.4%) reported a decrease in alcohol daily consumption (measured in drinks per day). Warm hand-off success for street drugs or at-risk alcohol use was 13.6% for those who received an intervention.
It is feasible for medical students to perform a substance use intervention in the ED setting. Medical student contributions as a part of the team response to this public health crisis provide an opportunity for further discussion and research.
Benzodiazepines are the most frequently consumed psychotropic drugs among older persons. This pharmacological class has been advised against in this group, due to the various risks associated with its use in an older population. This study seeks to determine the prevalence of benzodiazepine use in a non-institutionalized older population over the age of 75 that is registered in Family Health Units (USF) in the region of Minho, Portugal, as well as to characterize these patients and understand the link between benzodiazepine use and chronic medication use, risk of falls, and level of physical and functional dependence. The data extracted from the clinical records registered in the SAM® were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). A sample of 700 patients was obtained. These patients presented a mean age of 82.3 years, 62.7% were female, 95.3% were physically independent, and 38.0% were functionally independent. Almost half of the elder persons presented a moderate (36.9%) or high (11.4%) risk of falls. 37.9% of the patients were chronic benzodiazepines users, using between 1 and 3 active substances belonging to this pharmacological class, with a higher rate of use among women (p &lt; 0.001) and elder persons. There was a statistically significant association among the use of benzodiazepines, a functional independence, and a higher risk of falls. These pioneering findings in Portugal reveal a high prevalence of benzodiazepine use in the population studied and warn about the specific characteristics of said population and the importance in reducing the risks associated with the inappropriate prescription of these drugs.
At the turn of this century, cardinal changes took place in the perceptions of the structure and function of proteins, as well as in the organizational principles of membrane-less organelles. As a result, the model of the organization of living matter is changing to one described by highly dynamic biological soft matter positioned at the edge of chaos. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and membrane-less organelles are key examples of this new outlook and may represent a critical foundation of life, defining its complexity and the evolution of living things.
With the high prevalence of HIV among youth in sub-Saharan Africa, it is vital to better understand factors affecting HIV testing among this population; this is the first step in the HIV treatment cascade. The purpose of this study was to examine factors related to behavioral intentions regarding HIV testing using existing pre-test data from the HIV SEERs (Stigma-reduction via Education, Empowerment, and Research) Project, a community-based participatory research program targeting 13-24-year-olds in Kenya. It was hypothesized that HIV knowledge, social support, subjective well-being, and mental health (depression, anxiety, and stress) would serve as facilitators to HIV testing while projected stigma and substance use would serve as barriers to HIV testing. In partial support of our hypotheses, findings from logistic regression analyses revealed that HIV knowledge, substance use, depression, and social support were significant predictors of HIV testing intentions. However, HIV knowledge and substance use served as facilitators while depression and social support served as barriers. While projected stigma was correlated with HIV testing intentions, it was not a significant predictor in the regression analysis. Subjective well-being, anxiety, and stress were not significant predictors in the regression analysis. These findings have important implications for HIV testing initiatives designed for youth in Kenya as well as future research on HIV testing with this population.
Proteases in the cancer microenvironment have been studied for some time, with a general conclusion that such proteases facilitate the spread of cancer, although there is some controversy regarding that conclusion in later-stage cancer development. More recently, a very large collection of data regarding mutant amino acids in the potential substrates of cancer microenvironment proteases have become available. To better understand the potential impact of these mutant amino acids on protease function and cancer progression, we established a bioinformatics approach to assessing the impact of melanoma mutants, among a previously defined set of extracellular matrix (ECM) structural proteins, on the sensitivity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2), extensively associated with melanoma. The results indicated that tumor samples with mutant amino acids adjacent to the ECM structural protein, MMP2 sites also represented a better survival rate and a larger proportion of mutant peptides with high HLA class I-binding affinities, particularly in comparison with melanoma samples with a reduced or absent T-cell infiltrate. Furthermore, even better HLA class I binders were identified among the samples representing the ECM structural protein mutants resistant to MMP2. Samples representing only MMP2-resistant mutants also represented a worse overall survival. Overall, this analysis suggested that MMP2 has the capacity of freeing mutant peptides that could facilitate an anti-tumor response and a better survival rate, and this analysis has the potential of resolving some of the controversy surrounding the role of cancer proteases in cancer progression.
We investigated the roles of vegetation structure, micro-topographic relief, and predator activity patterns (time of day) on the perception of predatory risk of arctic ground squirrels (Urocitellus parryii), an abundant pan-Arctic omnivore, in Arctic Circle tundra on the North Slope of Alaska, where tundra vegetation structure has been predicted to change in response to climate. We quantified foraging intensity by measuring the giving-up densities (GUDs) of the arctic ground squirrels in experimental foraging patches along a heath-graminoid-shrub moist tundra gradient. We hypothesized that foraging intensity of arctic ground squirrels would be greatest and GUDs lowest, where low-stature vegetation or raised micro-topography improves sightlines for predator detection. Furthermore, GUDs should vary with time of day and reflect 24-h cycles of varying predation risk. Foraging intensity varied temporally, being highest in the afternoon and lowest overnight. During the morning, foraging intensity was inversely correlated with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), a proxy for vegetation productivity and cover. Foraging was additionally measured within landscapes of fear, confirming that vegetative and topographic obstructions of sightlines reduces foraging intensity and increases GUDs. We conclude that arctic ground squirrels may affect Arctic Circle vegetation of tundra ecosystems, but these effects will vary spatially and temporally.
Synergistic catalysis occurring in an enzyme pocket shows enhanced performance through supramolecular recognition and flexibility. This study presents an aerogel capable of similar function by fabricating a gel catalyst with hierarchical porosity. Here, the as-prepared Co-MMPG, a Co(II) metal-metalloporphyrin gel, maintains enough conformational flexibility and features a binding pocket formed from the co-facial arrangement of the porphyrin rings, as elucidated through the combined studies of solid-state NMR and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES). The cooperativity between two Co(II) sites within the defined nanospace pocket facilitates the binding of different substrates with a favourable geometry thereby rendering Co-MMPG with excellent performance in the context of synergistic catalysis, especially for the kinetic control stereoselective reactions. Our work thus contributes a different enzyme-mimic design strategy to develop a highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst with high chemo/stereo selectivity.
The five melanocortin receptors (MC1R-MC5R) are involved in numerous biological pathways, including steroidogenesis, pigmentation, and food intake. In particular, MC3R and MC4R knockout mice suggest that the MC3R and MC4R regulate energy homeostasis in a non-redundant manner. While MC4R-selective agonists have been utilized as appetite modulating agents, the lack of MC3R-selective agonists has impeded progress in modulating this receptor in vivo. In this study, the (pI)DPhe position of the tetrapeptide Ac-His-Arg-(pI)DPhe-Tic-NH2 (an MC3R agonist/MC4R antagonist ligand) was investigated with a library of 12 compounds. The compounds in this library were found to have higher agonist efficacy and potency at the mouse (m) MC3R compared to the MC4R, indicating that the Arg-DPhe motif preferentially activates the mMC3R over the mMC4R. This observation may be used in the design of new MC3R-selective ligands, leading to novel probe and therapeutic lead compounds that will be useful for treating metabolic disorders.
The most vital step in the development of novel and existing surface acoustic wave (SAW)-based sensors and transducers is their design and optimization. Demand for SAW devices has been steadily increasing due to their low cost, portability, and versatility in electronics, telecommunications, and biosensor applications. However, a full characterization of surface acoustic wave biosensors in a three-dimensional (3D) finite element model has not yet been developed. In this study, a novel approach is developed for analyzing shear horizontal Love wave resonator devices. The developed modeling methodology was verified using fabricated devices. A thorough analysis of the 3D model and the experimental device was performed in this study including scattering parameters (S-parameters), reflection coefficient parameters, transmission parameters, and phase velocity. The simulated results will be used as a design guideline for future device design and optimization, which has thus far resulted in close matching between prediction and experimental results. This manuscript is the first to demonstrate a 3D finite element model to correlate the sensitivity of the SAW device with the magnitude of the phase shift, the real and imaginary part of the response, insertion loss, and the frequency shift. The results show that the imaginary part of the response shift has a higher sensitivity compared to other parameters.
Nanoindentation techniques have been used to reliably characterize mechanical properties at small scales for the past 30 years [...].
A crucial contribution to the heterogeneity of the conformational landscape of a protein comes from the way an intermediate relates to another intermediate state in its journey from the unfolded to folded or misfolded form. Unfortunately, it is extremely hard to decode this relatedness in a quantifiable manner. Here, we developed an application of statistical cluster analyses to explore the conformational heterogeneity of a metalloenzyme, human cytosolic copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1), using the inputs from infrared spectroscopy. This study provides a quantifiable picture of how conformational information at one particular site (for example, the copper-binding pocket) is related to the information at the second site (for example, the zinc-binding pocket), and how this relatedness is transferred to the global conformational information of the protein. The distance outputs were used to quantitatively generate a network capturing the folding sub-stages of SOD1.
10% of the world's population suffers from chronic kidney disease. Kidney transplants provide an improvement in the quality of life of those patients. Sexual dysfunction is common after kidney transplantation, and its etiology is presumed to be multifactorial. It has a negative impact on sexual satisfaction and health-related quality-of-life. The integration of a new organ into the body can imply an adjustment of body image, which may eventually have a negative influence on intimacy and sexual behaviors.
To evaluate male sexual function, sexual satisfaction, and body image satisfaction among a convenience sample of patients who have had a kidney transplant.
This is a cross-sectional study that included 460 patients, from a single healthcare center, who had undergone a kidney transplant procedure &gt;4 weeks ago. A total of 112 respondents (mean = 55.5 years, SD = 11.4) answered the questionnaires properly.
All recruited patients answered a self-reported sociodemographic questionnaire, in addition to the International Index of Erectile function, the New Scale of Sexual Satisfaction, the Brief Symptom Inventory, and the Body Image Scale.
A correlation was found between sexual function and sexual satisfaction (r = 0.598, P &lt; .001, n = 112), as well as between body image satisfaction and sexual function (r = -0.193, P = .042, n = 112). The length of time after a kidney transplant (≤ or &gt;36 months) was not associated with a difference in sexual functioning or sexual satisfaction.
This study showed the obvious implications of sexual function on sexual satisfaction, which should alert healthcare professionals to the importance of identifying and managing sexual dysfunction in patients with chronic kidney disease, to optimize their global and sexual health satisfaction.
This study identified a high prevalence of sexual dysfunction among kidney transplant recipients. This should reinforce the need for the medical community to evaluate the quality-of-life domains of patients with chronic disease. There is still a lack of information concerning any longitudinal evaluation of kidney transplant patients' sexual function and the effects that this surgery has on sexuality.
This study corroborated the severe effects that kidney transplant patients often report regarding their sexuality. Among the patients who participated in the study, sexual function proved to be relevant in relation to sexual satisfaction. Mota RL, Fonseca R, Santos JC, et al. Sexual Dysfunction and Satisfaction in Kidney Transplant Patients. J Sex Med 2019;XX:XXX-XXX.
This article reviews the pharmacology of the most commonly used antihypertensive medications during pregnancy; their mechanism of action; and the effects on the mother, the fetus, and lactation. Each class of antihypertensive pharmacologic agents have specific mechanisms of action by which they exert their antihypertensive effect. β-Adrenoreceptor antagonists block these receptors in the peripheral circulation. Calcium channel blockers result in arterial vasodilation. α-Agonists inhibit vasoconstriction. Methyldopa is a centrally acting adrenoreceptor antagonist. Vasodilators have a direct effect on vascular smooth muscle. Diuretics decrease intravascular volume. Medications acting on the angiotensin pathway are avoided during pregnancy because of fetotoxic effects.
Stroke-induced hypoxia causes oligodendrocyte death due to inflammation, lack of oxygen and exacerbation of cell death. Bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs) possess an endogenous population of T-regulatory cells (Tregs) which reduce secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines that lead to secondary cell death. Here, we hypothesize that oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) cultured with BMSCs containing their native Treg population show greater cell viability, less pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and greater myelin production after exposure to oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) than OPCs cultured without Tregs. OPCs were cultured and then exposed to OGD/R. BMSCs with or without Tregs were added to the co-culture immediately after ischemia. The Tregs were depleted by running the BMSCs through a column containing a magnetic substrate. Fibroblast growth factor beta (FGF-β) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) ELISAs determined BMSC activity levels. Immunohistochemistry assessed OPC differentiation. OPCs cultured with BMSCs containing their endogenous Tregs showed increased myelin production compared to the BMSCs with depleted Tregs. IL-6 and FGF-β were increased in the group cultured with Tregs. Collectively, these results suggest that BMSCs containing Tregs are more therapeutically active, and that Tregs have beneficial effects on OPCs subjected to ischemia. Tregs play an important role in stem cell therapy and can potentially treat white matter injury post-stroke.
Mutations in the Kelch domain of the K13 gene (PF3D7_1343700) were previously associated with artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum. This study followed the dynamics of the K13 polymorphisms in P. falciparum parasites from the China-Myanmar border area obtained in 2007-2016, and their in vitro sensitivities to artesunate (AS) and dihydroartemisinin (DHA). The 50% effective concentration (EC5072h) values of 133 culture-adapted field isolates to AS and DHA, measured by the conventional 72 h SYBR Green I-based assay, varied significantly among the parasites from different years; all were significantly higher than that of the reference strain 3D7. Compared with parasites from 2007 to 2008, ring survival rates almost doubled in parasites obtained in later years. Sequencing the full-length K13 genes identified 11 point mutations present in 85 (63.9%) parasite isolates. F446I was the predominant (55/133) variant, and its frequency was increased from 17.6% (3/17) in 2007 to 55.9% (19/34) in 2014-2016. No wild-type (WT) Kelch domain sequences were found in the 34 samples obtained from 2014 to 2016. In the 2014-2016 samples, a new mutation (G533S) appeared and reached 44.1% (15/34). Collectively, parasites with the Kelch domain mutations (after amino acid 440) had significantly higher ring survival rates than the WT parasites. Individually, F446I, G533S and A676D showed significantly higher ring survival rates than the WT. Although the drug sensitivity phenotypes measured by the RSA6h and EC5072h assays may be intrinsically linked to the in vivo clinical efficacy data, the values determined by these two assays were not significantly correlated. This study identified the trend of K13 mutations in parasite populations from the China-Myanmar border area, confirmed an overall correlation of Kelch domain mutations with elevated ring-stage survival rates, and emphasized the importance of monitoring the evolution and spread of parasites with reduced artemisinin sensitivity along the malaria elimination course.
Forensic radiology is a relatively unknown subspecialty which is becoming increasingly more important. The field incorporates antemortem and postmortem imaging for the detection and documentation of various pathologies for medicolegal purposes. Postmortem imaging is increasingly used in conjunction with the traditional autopsy in a process called a "virtual" autopsy. Radiography has been a staple of forensic investigations for over a century, first used in 1896. Advanced imaging techniques such as postmortem computed tomography and postmortem magnetic resonance imaging have only recently gained acceptance in the forensic science community. Postmortem computed tomography and postmortem magnetic resonance imaging methods are now widely used in some parts of the world, while other countries including the United States have been slower to adopt these methods into their daily practice. Advanced forensic imaging is increasingly used in the courts where juries have responded positively to such presentation of forensic data. For these reasons, advanced postmortem imaging is becoming a regular part of forensic investigations. The increase in the use of forensic imaging presents a unique opportunity for radiologists to collaborate with pathologists and law enforcement officials. This paper provides an overview of forensic radiology and identifies potential challenges and opportunities.
To compare the detection rate of adenomyosis when ultrasound is performed by a radiologist compared to a gynecologic expert sonologist.
A retrospective, single center study.
University teaching hospital PATIENTS: All women above 18 years of age with a positive histopathology diagnosis of adenomyosis obtained in a hysterectomy specimen from October 1, 2011 - October 1, 2017 were screened for inclusion. Cases without a pre-operative pelvic ultrasound report, those with co-existing pre-malignant/malignant conditions, or presenting to the clinic with symptoms other than AUB, dysmenorrhea, or abdominal pain were excluded. A total of 412 cases were included in the final analysis.
N/A MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The pre-operative ultrasound was performed by a radiologist in 241 patients (59%) and by an expert gynecologic sonologist in 171 patients (42%). Patients' age, BMI, race, ethnicity, parity, history of prior caesarean section were comparable between the two groups. Adenomyosis detection rate was significantly higher in the expert gynecologic sonologist group compared to radiologists (95 [56%] vs 29 [12%], p&lt;0.01). After controlling for patients' race, BMI, prior cesarean, and presence of fibroids using multivariable logistic regression, gynecologic expert sonologists were 7.8 times more likely to detect adenomyosis than radiologists (odds ratio [OR]: 7.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.58-13.44). Regardless of medical specialty, the presence of fibroids significantly decreased the detection of adenomyosis compared to absence of fibroids (OR: 0.23, 95% CI: 0.13-0.39).
The detection rate of adenomyosis was significantly higher when ultrasound was performed by expert gynecologic sonologists compared to radiologists. Presence of fibroids significantly decreased detection rates regardless of specialty. Ultrasound evaluation for detecting adenomyosis should be preferentially performed by gynecologic expert sonologists.
In a recent issue of Academic Emergency Medicine, we read with interest the article titled: Hospital Observation Upon Reversal (HOUR) with Naloxone: A Prospective Clinical Prediction Rule Validation Study by Clemency et al. In order to avoid over-reliance on this decision rule and possible untoward effects of early discharge, we feel that there are some key points worth considering in this regard. It is important to note that the average dose of prehospital naloxone was 3.1mg, which was administered intranasally (IN) in 85% of the patients. This fact was briefly discussed in the paper in terms of area under the curve (AUC). However, since AUC terminology may not readily translate to clinical meaning for many readers, we feel expanded discussion on this potential confounder is necessary.

To investigate the experiences of men with germline pathogenic BRCA variants or who have a first-degree family member who tested positive for BRCA regarding their interactions with healthcare providers about their cancer risks.
25 phone interviews were conducted with men at risk for hereditary cancer. Data were analyzed using an iterative approach where emergent themes were compared to existing research and theories.
Informed by Expectancy Violation Theory (EVT), a model for understanding men's experiences when interacting with healthcare providers about their BRCA-related cancer risks-comprised of three stages including expectation, violation, and outcomes-was developed.
These findings show the importance of men's basic expectations for patient-provider interactions and how violations of expectations impact perceptions, communication, and behavior. Outcomes of negative expectancy violations may impact not only men with BRCA-related cancer risks but also their family members.
Healthcare providers can be mindful about the ways in which they positively and negatively violate patients' expectations. Patients can engage in self-advocacy behaviors, and advocacy organizations can design resources for patients and healthcare providers to encourage and support effective communication between providers, patients, and their family members.
Marine fish consumption is rising around the world due to the high quality of its nutritional components, including long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), which are abundant and found as triacylglycerol (TAG) in the muscle and skin of Salmonidae family. Farm raised and wild species of Salmon have different diets, that directly influences their TAG composition. In this work, we demonstrate the evaluation of TAG composition of salmon species as an authenticity screening parameter. For this purpose, we propose the use of ambient mass spectrometry, here represented by the thermal imprinting (TI) easy ambient sonic-spray ionization mass spectrometry (EASI-MS), to offer a fast and ecofriendly method for TAG extraction and characterization of fish muscles and skins. Specifically, TI-EASI-MS was employed to obtain the TAG profiles of different species from Salmonids, which were compared using multivariate statistical analysis. Clear differentiation of wild-raised fishes was achieved based on their higher content of ions attributed to TAG containing PUFA when compared to farm-raised fishes. The TI extraction method was also compared to the standard Bligh &amp; Dyer extraction protocol and the techniques were equivalent for Salmon species differentiation.
The subtidal red alga Plocamium cartilagineum was collected from the Western Antarctic Peninsula during the 2011 and 2017 austral summers. Bulk collections from specific sites corresponded to chemogroups identified by Young et al. in 2013. One of the chemogroups yielded several known acyclic halogenated monoterpenes (2-5) as well as undescribed compounds of the same class, anverenes B-D (6-8). Examination of another chemogroup yielded an undescribed cyclic halogenated monoterpene anverene E (9) as its major secondary metabolite. Elucidation of structures was achieved through one-dimensional (1D) and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and negative chemical ionization mass spectrometry. Compounds 1-9 show moderate cytotoxicity against cervical cancer (HeLa) cells.
Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is one of the most widely studied personality disorders (PDs). It recurrently shows traits of emotional lability, anxiety, separation insecurity, depressiveness, impulsiveness, risk exposure, and hostility, mainly affecting the domains of negative affectivity and antagonism.
To investigate the most discriminant dimensions of the Dimensional Clinical Personality Inventory (Inventário Dimensional Clínico da Personalidade 2 [IDCP-2]) to distinguish people diagnosed with BPD from people without this diagnosis.
A total of 305 participants were included in this study: psychiatric outpatients diagnosed with BPD (n = 30), psychiatric outpatients diagnosed with other PDs (n = 75), and a community sample (n = 200). BPD traits were assessed using the dependency, mood instability, and inconsequence dimensions of the IDCP-2.
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) comparisons indicated highest mean measures in the BPD group, and mood instability factors were the most discriminant ones when considering all groups. Applying the multiple regression analysis, we found an adjusted r 2 = 0.50, and hopelessness was the most predictive measure (β = 0.32; t = 6.19; p &lt; 0.001).
We found discriminatory capacity for factors of all dimensions, although at different levels, and more consistent results to discriminate the BPD group from the community sample.
The morphological diversity of flower organs is closely related to functional divergence within the MADS-box gene family. Bryophytes and seedless vascular plants have MADS-box genes but do not have ABCDE or AGAMOUS-LIKE6 (AGL6) genes. ABCDE and AGL6 genes belong to the subgroup of MADS-box genes. Previous works suggest that the B gene was the first ABCDE and AGL6 genes to emerge in plant but there are no mentions about the probable origin time of ACDE and AGL6 genes. Here, we collected ABCDE and AGL6 gene 381 protein sequences and 361 coding sequences from gymnosperms and angiosperms and reconstructed a complete Bayesian phylogeny of these genes. In this study, we want to clarify the probable origin time of ABCDE and AGL6 genes is a great help for understanding the role of the formation of the flower, which can decipher the forming order of MADS-box genes in the future.
These genes appeared to have been under purifying selection and their evolutionary rates are not significantly different from each other. Using the Bayesian evolutionary analysis by sampling trees (BEAST) tool, we estimated that: the mutation rate of the ABCDE and AGL6 genes was 2.617 × 10-3 substitutions/site/million years, and that B genes originated 339 million years ago (MYA), CD genes originated 322 MYA, and A genes shared the most recent common ancestor with E/AGL6 296 MYA, respectively.
The phylogeny of ABCDE and AGL6 genes subfamilies differed. The APETALA1 (AP1 or A gene) subfamily clustered into one group. The APETALA3/PISTILLATA (AP3/PI or B genes) subfamily clustered into two groups: the AP3 and PI clades. The AGAMOUS/SHATTERPROOF/SEEDSTICK (AG/SHP/STK or CD genes) subfamily clustered into a single group. The SEPALLATA (SEP or E gene) subfamily in angiosperms clustered into two groups: the SEP1/2/4 and SEP3 clades. The AGL6 subfamily clustered into a single group. Moreover, ABCDE and AGL6 genes appeared in the following order: AP3/PI → AG/SHP/STK → AGL6/SEP/AP1. In this study, we collected candidate sequences from gymnosperms and angiosperms. This study highlights important events in the evolutionary history of the ABCDE and AGL6 gene families and clarifies their evolutionary path.
B cell antigen receptor (BCR) and CD40 signaling are rewired in germinal center (GC) B cells (GCBCs) to optimize selection for high-affinity B cells. In GCBC, BCR signals are constrained, but the mechanisms are not well understood. Here we describe a GC-specific, AKT-kinase-driven negative feedback loop that attenuates BCR signaling. Mass spectrometry revealed that AKT target activity was altered in GCBCs compared with naive B cells. Retargeting was linked to differential AKT T308 and S473 phosphorylation, in turn controlled by GC-specific upregulation of phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase PDK1 and the phosphatase PTEN. In GCBCs, AKT preferentially targeted CSK, SHP-1 and HPK1, which are negative regulators of BCR signaling. We found that phosphorylation enhances enzymatic activity of these proteins, creating a negative feedback loop that dampens upstream BCR signaling. AKT inhibition relieved this negative feedback and enhanced activation of BCR-proximal kinase LYN, as well as downstream BCR signaling molecules in GCBCs.
Ergosterol peroxide (EP) derived from edible mushroom has been shown to exert anti-tumor activity in several cancer cells. In the present study, anti-angiogenic activity of EP was investigated with the underlying molecular mechanisms in human multiple myeloma U266 cells.
Despite weak cytotoxicity against U266 cells, EP suppressed phosphorylation, DNA binding activity and nuclear translocalization of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in U266 cells at nontoxic concentrations. Also, EP inhibited phosphorylation of the upstream kinases Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and Src in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, EP increased the expression of protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 at protein and mRNA levels, and conversely silencing of the SHP-1 gene clearly blocked EP-mediated STAT3 inactivation. In addition, EP significantly decreased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), one of STAT3 target genes at cellular and protein levels as well as disrupted in vitro tube formation assay. Moreover, EP significantly suppressed the growth of U266 cells inoculated in female BALB/c athymic nude mice and immunohistochemistry revealed that EP effectively reduced the expression of STAT3 and CD34 in tumor sections compared to untreated control.
These findings suggest that EP can exert antitumor activity in multiple myeloma U266 cells partly with antiangiogenic activity targeting JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway as a potent cancer preventive agent for treatment of multiple myeloma cells.
The activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) has been closely linked with the proliferation, survival, invasion, and angiogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and represents an attractive target for therapy. In the present report, we investigated whether honokiol mediates its effect through interference with the STAT3 activation pathway. The effect of honokiol on STAT3 activation, associated protein kinases, and phosphatase, STAT3-regulated gene products and apoptosis was investigated using both functional proteomics tumor pathway technology platform and different HCC cell lines. We found that honokiol inhibited both constitutive and inducible STAT3 activation in a dose- and time-dependent manner in HCC cells. The suppression was mediated through the inhibition of activation of upstream kinases c-Src, Janus-activated kinase 1, and Janus-activated kinase 2. Vanadate treatment reversed honokiol-induced down-regulation of STAT3, suggesting the involvement of a tyrosine phosphatase. Indeed, we found that honokiol induced the expression of tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 that correlated with the down-regulation of constitutive STAT3 activation. Moreover, deletion of SHP-1 gene by siRNA abolished the ability of honokiol to inhibit STAT3 activation. The inhibition of STAT3 activation by honokiol led to the suppression of various gene products involved in proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis. Finally, honokiol inhibited proliferation and significantly potentiated the apoptotic effects of paclitaxel and doxorubicin in HCC cells. Overall, the results suggest that honokiol is a novel blocker of STAT3 activation and may have a great potential for the treatment of HCC and other cancers.
Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is an oncogenic transcription factor implicated in carcinogenesis. Here, the role of STAT3 pathway in the antitumor activity of an active ginseng saponin metabolite compound K (CK) was investigated in human multiple myeloma U266 cells. CK increased the cytotoxicity, accumulated the sub-G1 DNA population, cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and activated caspase-3 in U266 cells. Interestingly, CK inhibited phosphorylation of STAT3 and its upstream activators, the Janus activated kinase 1 (JAK1), but not JAK2. Furthermore, CK enhanced the expression of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) SHP-1, but not PTEN. Additionally, CK down-regulated STAT3 target genes bcl-x(L), bcl-2, survivin, cyclin E and cyclin D1. Conversely, PTP inhibitor pervanadate reversed CK-mediated STAT3 inactivation and cleavages of caspase-3 and PARP. Overall, our findings demonstrate that JAK1/STAT3 signaling mediates CK-induced apoptosis in U266 cells and also suggest the chemopreventive potential of CK for treatment of multiple myeloma.
Either glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β or nuclear factor (NF)-κB regulates interferon (IFN)-γ-induced nitric oxide (NO) biosynthesis; however, the inter-regulation between GSK-3β and NF-κB is unknown. We have previously shown that IFN-γ-activated GSK-3β negatively regulates Src homology-2 domain-containing phosphatase (SHP) 2 to facilitate Janus kinase (Jak) 2-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 activation. Because Jaks-IFN-inducible dsRNA-activated serine-threonine protein kinase (PKR) axis signaling is essential for IFN-γ-activation of NF-κB, in this study we investigate the potential mechanism for GSK-3β-facilitated NF-κB activation in IFN-γ-stimulated RAW264.7 murine macrophages. Pharmacological inhibitors of GSK-3β or NF-κB signaling, such as the inhibitor of κB (IκB) kinase β (IKKβ) and IκBα, inhibited IFN-γ-induced inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and thus NO biosynthesis. Inhibiting GSK-3β decreased IFN-γ-induced NF-κB phosphorylation (Ser536) and activation. The upstream regulators for GSK-3β activation, including okadaic acid-sensitive protein phosphatase and proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2, were also important for IFN-γ-induced IκBα phosphorylation (Ser32) and degradation. Under IFN-γ stimulation, Jak2-PKR axis signaling induced IκBα inactivation as well as iNOS/NO biosynthesis. It is notable that inhibiting GSK-3β caused SHP2-mediated dephosphorylation of PKR (Thr446), IKKβ (Ser180), and NF-κB (Ser536). Taken together, we provide the first evidence to demonstrate that GSK-3β indirectly facilitates IFN-γ-induced NF-κB activation by inhibiting SHP2, in turn activating the PKR-IKKβ-IκBα axis signaling pathway.
Nuclear orphan receptors represent a large and diverse subgroup in the nuclear receptor superfamily. Although putative ligands for these orphan members remain to be identified, some of these receptors possess intrinsic activating, inhibitory, or dual regulatory functions in development, differentiation, homeostasis, and reproduction. In particular, gene-silencing events elicited by chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factors (COUP-TFs); dosage-sensitive sex reversal-adrenal hypoplasia congenita critical region on the X chromosome, gene 1 (DAX-1); germ cell nuclear factor (GCNF); short heterodimer partner (SHP); and testicular receptors 2 and 4 (TR2 and TR4) are among the best characterized. These orphan receptors are critical in controlling basal activities or hormonal responsiveness of numerous target genes. They employ multiple and distinct mechanisms to mediate target gene repression. Complex cross-talk exists between these orphan receptors at their cognate DNA binding elements and an array of steroid?nonsteroid hormone receptors, other transcriptional activators, coactivators and corepressors, histone modification enzyme complexes, and components of basal transcriptional components. Therefore, perturbation induced by these orphan receptors at multiple levels, including DNA binding activities, receptor homo- or heterodimerization, recruitment of cofactor proteins, communication with general transcriptional machinery, and changes at histone acetylation status and chromatin structures, may contribute to silencing of target gene expression in a specific promoter or cell-type context. Moreover, the findings derived from gene-targeting studies have demonstrated the significance of these orphan receptors' function in physiologic settings. Thus, COUP-TFs, DAX-1, GCNF, SHP, and TR2 and 4 are known to be required for multiple physiologic and biologic functions, including neurogenesis and development of the heart and vascular system steroidogenesis and sex determination, gametogenesis and embryonic development, and cholesterol?lipid homeostasis.
Our previous studies have shown that SHP-1, a SH2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase, is expressed not only in cells of hematopoietic lineages, but also in many non-hematopoietic cells under the control of an alternative tissue-specific promoter, P1. In this study, the activity of the P1 promoter was analyzed in a region spanning 3.5 kb upstream of the major transcription start site in non-hematopoietic MCF-7 cells. Using DNA footprinting, gel retardation assays and mutational analysis, we have characterized cis-regulatory elements that are essential to confer the P1 promoter activity. An upstream Sp1 element (-126 to -118) positively regulated this TATA-box-lacking promoter. Two inverted CCAAT-elements (-332 to -328 and -66 to -62) played important roles in regulating the SHP-1 gene expression, and transcription factor NF-Y predominantly bound to the two CCAAT-elements. Binding of NF-Y to the distal CCAAT-element enhanced the transcriptional activity of the P1 promoter. In contrast, binding of NF-Y to the proximal CCAAT-element and interacting with repressor(s) inhibited the promoter activity. Furthermore, incubation of MCF7 cells with 100 ng/ml trichostatin A, an inhibitor of histone deacetylase, significantly increased the activity of the P1 promoter. Mutation in the proximal CCAAT-element, however, eliminated the activating effect of trichostatin A on the promoter. Together, our data suggest that NF-Y factor can function either as a specific positive or negative regulator of P1 promoter activity in non-hematopoietic MCF7 cells.
STAT5, a member of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs), is important in modulating T cell functions through interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptors. Like other STAT proteins, STAT5 undergoes a rapid activation and inactivation cycle upon cytokine stimulation. Tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are critical in regulating STAT5 activity. A number of protein tyrosine kinases have been shown to phosphorylate STAT5; however, the phosphatases responsible for STAT5 dephosphorylation remain unidentified. Using CTLL-20 as a model system, we provide evidence that tyrosine dephosphorylation of STAT5 subsequent to IL-2-induced phosphorylation occurs in the absence of STAT5 nuclear translocation and new protein synthesis. Nevertheless, down-regulation of the upstream Janus kinase activity during the deactivation cycle of IL-2-induced signaling does involve new protein synthesis. These findings point to the constitutive presence of STAT5 tyrosine phosphatase activity in the cytosolic compartment. We further demonstrate that SHP-2, but not SHP-1, directly dephosphorylates STAT5 in an in vitro tyrosine phosphatase assay with purified proteins. Furthermore, tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT5 associates with the substrate-trapping mutant (Cys --&gt; Ser) of SHP-2 but not SHP-1. These results suggest a potential role for cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine phosphatases in directly dephosphorylating STAT proteins and in maintaining a basal steady state level of STAT activity.
The aim of the current study is to determine whether butein (3,4,2',4'-tetrahydroxychalcone) exhibits antiproliferative effects against tumor cells through suppression of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation pathway. We investigated the effects of butein on constitutive and inducible STAT3 activation, role of tyrosine kinases and phosphatases in STAT3 activation, STAT3-regulated gene products, and growth modulation of tumor cells. We found that this chalcone inhibited both constitutive and interleukin-6-inducible STAT3 activation in multiple myeloma (MM) cells. The suppression was mediated through the inhibition of activation of the upstream kinases c-Src, Janus-like kinase (JAK) 1, and JAK2. Vanadate treatment reversed the butein-induced down-regulation of STAT3 activation, suggesting the involvement of a tyrosine phosphatase. Indeed, we found that butein induced the expression of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 and deletion of SHP-1 gene by small interfering RNA abolished the ability of butein to inhibit STAT3 activation, suggesting the critical role of SHP-1 in the action of this chalcone. Butein down-regulated the expression of STAT3-regulated gene products such as Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, cyclin D1, and Mcl-1, and this led to the suppression of proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Consistent with these results, overexpression of constitutive active STAT3 significantly reduced the butein-induced apoptosis. Moreover, we found that butein significantly potentiated the apoptotic effects of thalidomide and Velcade in MM cells. Overall, these results suggest that butein is a novel blocker of STAT3 activation and thus may have potential in suppression of tumor cell proliferation and reversal of chemoresistance in MM cells.
The activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) has been linked with the proliferation of a variety of human cancer cells, including multiple myeloma. Agents that can suppress STAT3 activation have potential for prevention and treatment of cancer. In the present report, we tested an agent, ursolic acid, found in basil, apples, prunes, and cranberries, for its ability to suppress STAT3 activation. We found that ursolic acid, a pentacyclic triterpenoid, inhibited both constitutive and interleukin-6-inducible STAT3 activation in a dose- and time-dependent manner in multiple myeloma cells. The suppression was mediated through the inhibition of activation of upstream kinases c-Src, Janus-activated kinase 1, Janus-activated kinase 2, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. Vanadate treatment reversed the ursolic acid-induced down-regulation of STAT3, suggesting the involvement of a tyrosine phosphatase. Indeed, we found that ursolic acid induced the expression of tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 protein and mRNA. Moreover, knockdown of SHP-1 by small interfering RNA suppressed the induction of SHP-1 and reversed the inhibition of STAT3 activation, thereby indicating the critical role of SHP-1 in the action of this triterpene. Ursolic acid down-regulated the expression of STAT3-regulated gene products such as cyclin D1, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, survivin, Mcl-1, and vascular endothelial growth factor. Finally, ursolic acid inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis and the accumulation of cells in G1-G0 phase of cell cycle. This triterpenoid also significantly potentiated the apoptotic effects of thalidomide and bortezomib in multiple myeloma cells. Overall, these results suggest that ursolic acid is a novel blocker of STAT3 activation that may have a potential in prevention and treatment of multiple myeloma and other cancers.
Aberrant activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is frequently observed in multiple myeloma (MM) cancer and can upregulate the expression of several genes involved in proliferation, survival, metastasis, and angiogenesis. The effect of farnesol (FOH) on STAT3 activation, associated protein kinases, its regulated gene products, cellular proliferation, and apoptosis was examined. The in vivo effect of FOH on the growth of human MM xenograft tumors alone and in combination with bortezomib (Bor) in athymic nu/nu female mice was also investigated. We found that FOH suppressed both constitutive and inducible STAT3 activation at Tyr705 in MM cells. The suppression of STAT3 was mediated through the inhibition of activation of upstream JAK1, JAK2, and c-Src kinases. Also, treatment with the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibitor, pervanadate treatment reversed the FOH-induced down-regulation of STAT3, possibly indicating the involvement of a PTP. Indeed, we found that FOH treatment induces the increased expression of SHP-2 protein and knockdown of the SHP-2 gene by small interfering RNA suppressed the ability of FOH to inhibit STAT3 activation. FOH inhibited proliferation and significantly potentiated the apoptotic effects of bortezomib (Bor) in U266 cells. When administered intraperitoneally, FOH enhanced Bor-induced growth suppression of human MM xenograft tumors in athymic nu/nu female mice. Our results suggest that FOH is a novel blocker of STAT3 signaling pathway and exerts both anti-proliferative and apoptotic activities in MM in vitro and in vivo. 
The important goal of cancer drug discovery is to develop therapeutic agents that are effective, safe, and affordable. In the present study, we demonstrated that alantolactone, which is a sesquiterpene lactone, has potential activity against triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells by suppressing the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway. Alantolactone effectively suppressed both constitutive and inducible STAT3 activation at tyrosine 705. Alantolactone decreased STAT3 translocation to the nucleus, its DNA-binding, and STAT3 target gene expression. Alantolactone significantly inhibits STAT3 activation with a marginal effect on MAPKs and on NF-κB transcription; however, this effect is not mediated by inhibiting STAT3 upstream kinases. Although SHP-1, SHP-2, and PTEN, which are protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), were not affected by alantolactone, the treatment with a PTP inhibitor reversed the alantolactone-induced suppression of STAT3 activation, indicating that PTP plays an important role in the action of alantolactone. Finally, alantolactone treatment resulted in the inhibition of migration, invasion, adhesion, and colony formation. The in vivo administration of alantolactone inhibited the growth of human breast xenograft tumors. These results provide preclinical evidence to continue the development of alantolactone as a STAT3 inhibitor and as a potential therapeutic agent against breast cancer. 
Persistent activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is one of the characteristic features of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and often linked to its deregulated proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis. In the present report, we investigated whether zerumbone, a sesquiterpene, exerts its anticancer effect through modulation of STAT3 activation pathway. The pharmacological effect of zerumbone on STAT3 activation, associated protein kinases and phosphatase, and apoptosis was investigated using both RCC cell lines and xenograft mouse model. We observed that zerumbone suppressed STAT3 activation in a dose- and time-dependent manner in RCC cells. The suppression was mediated through the inhibition of activation of upstream kinases c-Src, Janus-activated kinase 1, and Janus-activated kinase 2. Pervanadate treatment reversed zerumbone-induced downregulation of STAT3, suggesting the involvement of a tyrosine phosphatase. Indeed, we found that zerumbone induced the expression of tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 that correlated with its ability to inhibit STAT3 activation. Interestingly, deletion of SHP-1 gene by siRNA abolished the ability of zerumbone to inhibit STAT3 activation. The inhibition of STAT3 activation by zerumbone also caused the suppression of the gene products involved in proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis. Finally, when administered i.p., zerumbone inhibited STAT3 activation in tumor tissues and the growth of human RCC xenograft tumors in athymic nu/nu mice without any side effects. Overall, our results suggest for the first time that zerumbone is a novel blocker of STAT3 signaling cascade and thus has an enormous potential for the treatment of RCC and other solid tumors.
Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)-3 is a latent cytosolic transcription factor that has been closely associated with survival, proliferation, chemoresistance, and metastasis of tumor cells. Whether the anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, and anti-metastatic effects of capillarisin (CPS), derived from Artemisia capillaris (Compositae), are linked to its capability to inhibit STAT3 activation was investigated. We found that CPS specifically inhibited both constitutive and inducible STAT3 activation at tyrosine residue 705 but not at serine residue 727 in human multiple myeloma cells. Besides the inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation, CPS also abrogated STAT3 constitutive activity and nuclear translocation. The suppression of STAT3 was mediated through the inhibition of activation of upstream JAK1, JAK2, and c-Src kinases. Treatment with the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibitor pervanadate treatment reversed the CPS-induced down-regulation of JAK1/2 and STAT3, thereby suggesting the involvement of a PTP. Indeed, knockdown of the SHP-1 and SHP-2 genes by small interfering RNA suppressed the ability of CPS to inhibit JAK1 and STAT3 activation, suggesting the critical role of both SHP-1 and SHP-2 in its possible mechanism of action. CPS downregulated the expression of STAT3-regulated antiapoptotic and proliferative gene products; and this correlated with suppression of cell viability, the accumulation of cells in sub-G1 phase of cell cycle and induction of apoptosis. Moreover, CPS potentiated bortezomib-induced apoptotic effects in MM cells, and this correlated with down-regulation of various gene products that mediate cell proliferation (Cyclin D1 and COX-2), cell survival (Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, IAP1, IAP2, and Survivin), invasion (MMP-9), and angiogenesis (VEGF). Thus, overall, our results suggest that CPS is a novel blocker of STAT3 activation and thus may have a potential in negative regulation of growth, metastasis, and chemoresistance of tumor cells. 
Aberrant activation of STAT3 is frequently encountered and promotes proliferation, survival, metastasis and angiogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we have investigated whether emodin mediates its effect through interference with the STAT3 activation pathway in HCC.
The effect of emodin on STAT3 activation, associated protein kinases and apoptosis was investigated using various HCC cell lines. Additionally, we also used a predictive tumour technology to analyse the effects of emodin . The in vivo effects of emodin were assessed in an orthotopic mouse model of HCC.
Emodin suppressed STAT3 activation in a dose- and time-dependent manner in HCC cells, mediated by the modulation of activation of upstream kinases c-Src, JAK1 and JAK2. Vanadate treatment reversed emodin-induced down-regulation of STAT3, suggesting the involvement of a tyrosine phosphatase and emodin induced the expression of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 that correlated with the down-regulation of constitutive STAT3 activation. Interestingly, silencing of the SHP-1 gene by siRNA abolished the ability of emodin to inhibit STAT3 activation. Finally, when administered i.p., emodin inhibited the growth of human HCC orthotopic tumours in male athymic nu/nu mice and STAT3 activation in tumour tissues.
Emodin mediated its effects predominantly through inhibition of the STAT3 signalling cascade and thus has a particular potential for the treatment of cancers expressing constitutively activated STAT3.
Constitutive activation of STAT3 is frequently observed and closely linked with proliferation, survival, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis in tumor cells. In the present study, we investigated whether β-caryophyllene oxide (CPO), a sesquiterpene isolated primarily from the essential oils of medicinal plants such as guava (Psidium guajava), and oregano (Origanum vulgare L.), can mediate its effect through interference with the STAT3 activation pathway in cancer cells. The effect of CPO on STAT3 activation, associated protein kinases and phosphatase, STAT3-regulated gene products and apoptosis was investigated using both functional proteomics tumor pathway technology platform and different tumor cell lines. We found that CPO suppressed constitutive STAT3 activation in multiple myeloma (MM), breast and prostate cancer cell lines, with a significant dose- and time-dependent effects observed in MM cells. The suppression was mediated through the inhibition of activation of upstream kinases c-Src and JAK1/2. Also, vanadate treatment reversed CPO-induced down-regulation of STAT3, suggesting the involvement of a tyrosine phosphatase. Indeed, we found that CPO induced the expression of tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 that correlated with the down-regulation of constitutive STAT3 activation. Interestingly, deletion of SHP-1 gene by siRNA abolished the ability of CPO to inhibit STAT3 activation. The inhibition of STAT3 activation by CPO inhibited proliferation, induced apoptosis and abrogated the invasive potential of tumor cells. Our results suggest for the first time that CPO is a novel blocker of STAT3 signaling cascade and thus has an enormous potential for the treatment of various cancers harboring constitutively activated STAT3.
The aim of this study is to determine anti-cancer effect of Icariside II purified from the root of Epimedium koreanum Nakai on human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line U937.
Icariside II blocked the growth U937 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In this anti-proliferation process, this herb compound rendered the cells susceptible to apoptosis, manifested by enhanced accumulation of sub-G1 cell population and increased the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells. Icariside II was able to activate caspase-3 and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in a time-dependent manner. Concurrently, the anti-apoptotic proteins, such as bcl-x(L) and survivin in U937 cells, were downregulated by Icariside II. In addition, Icariside II could inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation and function and subsequently suppress the activation of Janus activated kinase 2 (JAK2), the upstream activators of STAT3, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Icariside II also enhanced the expression of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) SH2 domain-containing phosphatase (SHP)-1, and the addition of sodium pervanadate (a PTP inhibitor) prevented Icariside II-induced apoptosis as well as STAT3 inactivation in STAT3 positive U937 cells. Furthermore, silencing SHP-1 using its specific siRNA significantly blocked STAT3 inactivation and apoptosis induced by Icariside II in U937 cells.
Our results demonstrated that via targeting STAT3-related signaling, Icariside II sensitizes U937 cells to apoptosis and perhaps serves as a potent chemotherapeutic agent for AML.
Ginkgolic acid C 17:1 (GAC 17:1) extracted from Ginkgo biloba leaves, has been previously reported to exhibit diverse antitumor effect(s) through modulation of several molecular targets in tumor cells, however the detailed mechanism(s) of its actions still remains to be elucidated. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is an oncogenic transcription factor that regulates various critical functions involved in progression of diverse hematological malignancies, including multiple myeloma, therefore attenuating STAT3 activation may have a potential in cancer therapy. We determined the anti-tumor mechanism of GAC 17:1 with respect to its effect on STAT3 signaling pathway in multiple myeloma cell lines. We found that GAC 17:1 can inhibit constitutive activation of STAT3 through the abrogation of upstream JAK2, Src but not of JAK1 kinases in U266 cells and also found that GAC can suppress IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in MM.1S cells. Treatment of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibitor blocked suppression of STAT3 phosphorylation by GAC 17:1, thereby indicating a critical role for a PTP. We also demonstrate that GAC 17:1 can induce the substantial expression of PTEN and SHP-1 at both protein and mRNA level. Further, deletion of PTEN and SHP-1 genes by siRNA can repress the induction of PTEN and SHP-1, as well as abolished the inhibitory effect of drug on STAT3 phosphorylation. GAC 17:1 down-regulated the expression of STAT3 regulated gene products and induced apoptosis of tumor cells. Overall, GAC 17:1 was found to abrogate STAT3 signaling pathway and thus exert its anticancer effects against multiple myeloma cells.
Hippocalcin (HPCA) is a calcium-binding protein that is restricted to nervous tissue and contributes to neuronal activity. Here we report that, in addition to inducing neurogenesis, HPCA inhibits astrocytic differentiation of neural stem cells. It promotes neurogenesis by regulating protein kinase Cα (PKCα) activation by translocating to the membrane and binding to phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1), which induces PKCα phosphorylation. We also found that phospholipase D1 (PLD1) is implicated in the HPCA-mediated neurogenesis pathway; this enzyme promotes dephosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3[Y705]), which is necessary for astrocytic differentiation. Moreover, we found that the SH2-domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) acts upstream of STAT3. Importantly, this SHP-1-dependent STAT3-inhibitory mechanism is closely involved in neurogenesis and suppression of gliogenesis by HPCA. Taken together, these observations suggest that HPCA promotes neuronal differentiation through activation of the PKCα/PLD1 cascade followed by activation of SHP-1, which dephosphorylates STAT3(Y705), leading to inhibition of astrocytic differentiation.
Ginkgetin, a biflavone from Ginkgo biloba leaves, is known to exhibit antiinflammatory, antifungal, neuroprotective, and antitumor activities, but its precise mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated. Because the aberrant activation of STAT3 has been linked with regulation of inflammation, proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of tumors, we hypothesized that ginkgetin modulates the activation of STAT3 in tumor cells. We found that ginkgetin clearly suppressed constitutive phosphorylation of STAT3 through inhibition of the activation of upstream JAK1 and c-Src kinases and nuclear translocation of STAT3 on both A549 and FaDu cells. Treatment with sodium pervanadate reversed the ginkgetin-induced down-modulation of STAT3, thereby indicating a critical role for a PTP. We also found that ginkgetin strongly induced the expression of the SHP-1 and PTEN proteins and its mRNAs. Further, deletion of SHP-1 and PTEN genes by siRNA suppressed the induction of SHP-1 and PTEN, and reversed the inhibition of STAT3 activation. Ginkgetin induced apoptosis as characterized by an increased accumulation of cells in subG1 phase, positive Annexin V binding, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, down-regulation of STAT3-regulated gene products, and cleavage of PARP. Overall, ginkgetin abrogates STAT3 signaling pathway through induction of SHP-1 and PTEN proteins, thus attenuating STAT3 phosphorylation and tumorigenesis.
Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins are critical transcription factor that are aberrantly activated in various types of malignancies, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
We investigated the effect of resveratrol (RES), an edible polyphenol phytoalexin on STAT3 and STAT5 activation cascade in both Caki-1 and 786-O RCC cell lines.
We found that RES suppressed both constitutive STAT3 (tyrosine residue 705 and serine residue 727) and STAT5 (tyrosine residue 694 and 699) activation, which correlated with the suppression of the upstream kinases (JAK1, JAK2, and c-Src) in RCC. Also, RES abrogated DNA binding capacity and nuclear translocation of these two transcription factors. RES-induced an increased expression of PTPε and SHP-2 and the deletion of these two genes by small interfering RNA abolished the ability of RES to inhibit STAT3 activation, suggesting the critical role of both PTPε and SHP-2 in its possible mechanism of action. Moreover, RES induced S phase cell cycle arrest, caused induction of apoptosis, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and suppressed colony formation in RCC. We also found that RES downregulated the expression of STAT3/5-regulated antiapoptotic, proliferative, and metastatic gene products; and this correlated with induction of caspase-3 activation and anti-invasive activity. Beside, RES potentiated sorafenib induced inhibitory effect on constitutive STAT3 and STAT5 phosphorylation, apoptotic effects in 786-O cells, and this correlated with down-regulation of various oncogenic gene products.
Overall, our results suggest that RES is a blocker of both STAT3 and STAT5 activation and thus may exert potential growth inhibitory effects against RCC cells.
Polyphenols are the major components of many traditional herbal remedies, which exhibit several beneficial effects including anti-inflammation and antioxidant properties. Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) is a redox sensitive protein tyrosine phosphatase that negatively influences downstream signalling molecules, such as mitogen-activated protein kinases, thereby inhibiting inflammatory signalling induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Because a role of transforming growth factor β-activated kinase-1 (TAK1) in the upstream regulation of JNK molecule has been well demonstrated, we conjectured that SHP-1 could mediate the anti-inflammatory effect of verbascoside through the regulation of TAK-1/JNK/AP-1 signalling in the U937 cell line. Our results demonstrate that verbascoside increased the phosphorylation of SHP-1, by attenuating the activation of TAK-1/JNK/AP-1 signalling. This leads to a reduction in the expression and activity of both COX and NOS. Moreover, SHP-1 depletion deletes verbascoside inhibitory effects on pro-inflammatory molecules induced by LPS. Our data confirm that SHP-1 plays a critical role in restoring the physiological mechanisms of inducible proteins such as COX2 and iNOS, and that the down-regulation of TAK-1/JNK/AP-1 signalling by targeting SHP-1 should be considered as a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. 
Zinc finger protein 521 (ZNF521) is a multiple zinc finger transcription factor and a strong candidate as regulator of hematopoietic stem cell homeostasis. Recently, independent gene expression profile studies have evidenced a positive correlation between ZNF521 mRNA overexpression and MLL-rearranged acute myeloid leukemia (AML), leaving open the question on the role of ZNF521 in this subtype of leukemia. In this study, we sought to analyze the effect of ZNF521 depletion on MLL-rearranged AML cell lines and MLL-AF9 xenograft primary cells. Knockdown of ZNF521 with short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) led to decreased leukemia proliferation, reduced colony formation and caused cell cycle arrest in MLL-rearranged AML cell lines. Importantly, we showed that loss of ZNF521 substantially caused differentiation of both MLL-rearranged cell lines and primary cells. Moreover, gene profile analysis in ZNF521-silenced THP-1 cells revealed a loss of MLL-AF9-directed leukemic signature and an increase of the differentiation program. Finally, we determined that both MLL-AF9 and MLL-ENL fusion proteins directly interacted with ZNF521 promoter activating its transcription. In conclusion, our findings identify ZNF521 as a critical effector of MLL fusion proteins in blocking myeloid differentiation and highlight ZNF521 as a potential therapeutic target for this subtype of leukemia.
In response to infection and injury, the neutrophil population rapidly expands and then quickly re-establishes the basal state when inflammation resolves. The exact pathways governing neutrophil/macrophage lineage outputs from a common granulocyte-macrophage progenitor are still not completely understood. From a forward genetic screen in zebrafish, we identify the transcriptional repressor, ZBTB11, as critical for basal and emergency granulopoiesis. ZBTB11 sits in a pathway directly downstream of master myeloid regulators including PU.1, and TP53 is one direct ZBTB11 transcriptional target. TP53 repression is dependent on ZBTB11 cys116, which is a functionally critical, metal ion-coordinating residue within a novel viral integrase-like zinc finger domain. To our knowledge, this is the first description of a function for this domain in a cellular protein. We demonstrate that the PU.1-ZBTB11-TP53 pathway is conserved from fish to mammals. Finally, Zbtb11 mutant rescue experiments point to a ZBTB11-regulated TP53 requirement in development of other organs.
All trans retinoic acid (ATRA), an active vitamin-A derivative, has been shown to regulate gene expression program and thus imparts anti-proliferative activity to cancer cells. Previously, we identified a dual histone reader ZMYND8 (zinc finger MYND (Myeloid, Nervy and DEAF-1)-type containing 8), to be a novel target of ATRA. In the present study, we attempted to decipher the detail mechanism of its transcription regulation. ATRA can reprogram the epigenetic landscape in the upstream regulatory region of ZMYND8 thereby promoting its expression. Interestingly, there is a unique H3K27Me3 to H3K27Ac switch upon ATRA-treatment. We show here that ATRA causes dynamic changes in recruitment of transcription factor YY1 in concert with HDAC1 at ZMYND8 promoter. Further, we show that ATRA treatment triggers an anti-proliferative activity in cancer cells through regulation of ZMYND8 expression. Subsequently, in 4T1-induced syngenic tumor mouse model, ATRA injection caused significant upregulation of ZMYND8. Overall our findings highlight a novel mechanism underlying ATRA-mediated changes in ZMYND8 expression which, in turn, activates the anti-proliferative program in a cancer cell. Thus, histone reader mediated modulation of epigenetic language could play a significant role in retinoid based therapeutic strategy which is well exploited to combat tumor growth.
Treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), an aggressive and heterogeneous hematological malignancy, remains a challenge. Despite advances in our understanding of the complex genetics and biology of AML pathophysiology, these findings have been translated to the clinic with only limited success, and poor outcomes persist for the majority of patients. Thus, novel treatment strategies are clearly needed for achieving deeper and prolonged remissions and for avoiding the development of resistance. Due to its profound role in (cancer) stem cell biology and differentiation, the Hedgehog (HH)/Glioma-associated Oncogene Homolog (GLI) signaling pathway may be an attractive novel therapeutic target in AML. In this review, we aim to provide a critical and concise overview of the currently known potential and challenges of HH/GLI targeting. We describe the biological role of the HH/GLI pathway in AML pathophysiology. We specifically focus on ways of targeting non-canonical HH/GLI signaling in AML, particularly in combination with standard treatment regimens, which may overcome some hurdles observed with approved HH pathway inhibitors in solid tumors.
In 11q23 leukemias, the N-terminal part of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene is fused to &gt;60 different partner genes. In order to define a core set of MLL rearranged targets, we investigated the genome-wide binding of the MLL-AF9 and MLL-AF4 fusion proteins and associated epigenetic signatures in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines THP-1 and MV4-11. We uncovered both common as well as specific MLL-AF9 and MLL-AF4 target genes, which were all marked by H3K79me2, H3K27ac and H3K4me3. Apart from promoter binding, we also identified MLL-AF9 and MLL-AF4 binding at specific subsets of non-overlapping active distal regulatory elements. Despite this differential enhancer binding, MLL-AF9 and MLL-AF4 still direct a common gene program, which represents part of the RUNX1 gene program and constitutes of CD34+ and monocyte-specific genes. Comparing these data sets identified several zinc finger transcription factors (TFs) as potential MLL-AF9 co-regulators. Together, these results suggest that MLL fusions collaborate with specific subsets of TFs to deregulate the RUNX1 gene program in 11q23 AMLs.
CBFA2T3-GLIS2 is a fusion gene found in 17% of non-Down syndrome acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (non-DS AMKL, FAB M7) and in 8% of pediatric cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML, in association with several French-American-British (FAB) subtypes). Children with AML harboring this aberration have a poor outcome, regardless of the FAB subtype. This fusion gene drives a peculiar expression pattern and leads to overexpression of some of Hedgehog-related genes. GLI-similar protein 2 (GLIS2) is closely related to the GLI family, the final effectors of classic Hedgehog pathway. These observations lend compelling support to the application of GLI inhibitors in the treatment of AML with the aberration CBFA2T3-GLIS2. GANT61 is, nowadays, the most potent inhibitor of GLI family proteins.
We exposed to GANT61 AML cell lines and primary cells positive and negative for CBFA2T3-GLIS2 and analyzed the effect on cellular viability, induction of apoptosis, cell cycle, and expression profile.
As compared to AML cells without GLIS2 fusion, GANT61 exposure resulted in higher sensitivity of both cell lines and primary AML cells carrying CBFA2T3-GLIS2 to undergo apoptosis and G1 cell cycle arrest. Remarkably, gene expression studies demonstrated downregulation of GLIS2-specific signature genes in both treated cell lines and primary cells, in comparison with untreated cells. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed direct regulation by GLIS2 chimeric protein of DNMT1 and DNMT3B, two genes implicated in important epigenetic functions.
Our findings indicate that the GLI inhibitor GANT61 may be used to specifically target the CBFA2T3-GLIS2 fusion gene in pediatric AML.
The ability of hemopoietic stem cells to self-renew and differentiate into downstream lineages is dependent on specialized chromatin environments that establish and maintain stage-specific patterns of gene expression. However, the epigenetic factors responsible for mediating these regulatory events remain poorly defined. Here we provide evidence that BAF45a/PHF10, a subunit of SWI/SNF-like chromatin remodeling complexes, is essential for adult hemopoietic stem cell maintenance and myeloid lineage development. Deletion of BAF45a in the mouse is embryonic lethal. Acute deletion of BAF45a in the adult hemopoietic system causes a dose-dependent decrease in the frequency of long-term repopulating hemopoietic stem cells and committed myeloid progenitors without affecting their rate of proliferation. BAF45a-deficient hemopoietic stem cells and myeloid progenitors are selectively lost from mixed bone marrow chimeras, indicating their impaired function even in an intact microenvironment. Together, these studies suggest that the BAF45a subunit of SWI/SNF-like chromatin remodeling complexes plays nonredundant and specialized roles within the developing hemopoietic tissue.
Wilms' tumor gene 1 (WT1) is a zinc finger transcription factor that has been implicated as an oncogene in leukemia and several other malignancies. When investigating possible gene expression network partners of WT1 in a large acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient cohort, one of the genes with the highest correlation to WT1 was quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT), a key enzyme in the de novo nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) synthesis pathway. To investigate the possible relationship between WT1 and QPRT, we overexpressed WT1 in hematopoietic progenitor cells and cell lines, resulting in an increase of QPRT expression. WT1 knock-down gave a corresponding decrease in QPRT gene and protein expression. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation revealed WT1 binding to a conserved site in the first intron of the QPRT gene. Upon overexpression in leukemic K562 cells, QPRT conferred partial resistance to the anti-leukemic drug imatinib, indicating possible anti-apoptotic functions, consistent with previous reports on glioma cells. Interestingly, the rescue effect of QPRT overexpression was not correlated to increased NAD + levels, suggesting NAD + independent mechanisms. We conclude that QPRT, encoding a protein with anti-apoptotic properties, is a novel and direct target gene of WT1 in leukemic cells.
Zinc finger protein X-linked (ZFX) is a key regulator of both embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which is required for both Notch intracellular domain (NotchIC)-induced acute T-cell leukemia and MLL-AF9-induced myeloid leukemia in mouse models. However, the role of ZFX and its underlying mechanism in human leukemic cells remain unclear yet, though accumulating data have demonstrated that ZFX is aberrantly expressed in various human tumors and plays an important role. Herein, we found that ZFX was aberrantly expressed in various human leukemic cell lines and primary cells from leukemia patients compared with control cells. The silence of ZFX led to the growth suppression through either the deregulated cell cycle or the induction of apoptosis in various cells including K562, Jurkat, Namalwa, and THP-1 cells. The gene expression analysis revealed that UDP-Gal:βGlcNAc β 1,4-galactosyltransferase, polypeptide 1 (B4GALT1) was significantly down-regulated upon ZFX silencing, which is implicated in the response of K562 cells to the treatment of imatinib mesylate (IM). In addition, lectin blot assay showed that the galactosylation of glycoproteins in K562 cells was suppressed upon ZFX silencing. Interestingly, overexpression of B4GALT1 restored the growth and conferred drug resistance to ZFX-silenced cells. Taken together, we have demonstrated that ZFX is aberrantly expressed in multiple human leukemic cells and it modulates the growth and drug response of leukemic cells partially via B4GALT1, which suggests that ZFX is a new regulator of leukemic cells and warrants intensive investigations on this 'stemness' regulator in these deadly diseases.
Selective targeting of the PML/RARα oncoprotein demonstrates a successful molecular targeted therapy in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with a typical t(15:17) chromosomal translocation. The zinc-thiolate coordination is critical for structural stability of zinc finger proteins, including the PML moiety of PML/RARα. Based on the known interaction of redox-active selenium compounds with thiolate ligands of zinc, we herein have investigated the abrogatory effects of selenite alone or in combination with all-trans retinoic acid on PML/RARα and the possible effects on differentiation in these cells. At pharmacological concentrations, selenite inhibited the proliferation and survival of APL originated NB4 cells. In combination with ATRA, it potentiated the differentiation of NB4 cells without any differentiating effects of its own as a single agent. Concordant with our hypothesis, PML/RARα oncoprotein expression was completely abrogated by selenite. Increased expression of  RARα, PU.1 and FOXO3A transcription factors in the combined treatment suggested the plausible basis for increased differentiation in these cells. We show that selenite at clinically achievable dose targets PML/RARα oncoprotein for degradation and potentiates differentiation of promyelocytic leukemic cells in combination with ATRA. The present investigation reveals the hitherto unknown potential of selenite in targeted abrogation of PML/RARα in APL cells with prospective therapeutic value.
Epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) is critical for normal embryogenesis and effective postnatal wound healing, but is also associated with cancer metastasis. SNAIL, ZEB, and TWIST families of transcription factors are key modulators of the EMT process, but their precise roles in adult hematopoietic development and homeostasis remain unclear. Here we report that genetic inactivation of Zeb2 results in increased frequency of stem and progenitor subpopulations within the bone marrow (BM) and spleen and that these changes accompany differentiation defects in multiple hematopoietic cell lineages. We found no evidence that Zeb2 is critical for hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal capacity. However, knocking out Zeb2 in the BM promoted a phenotype with several features that resemble human myeloproliferative disorders, such as BM fibrosis, splenomegaly, and extramedullary hematopoiesis. Global gene expression and intracellular signal transduction analysis revealed perturbations in specific cytokine and cytokine receptor-related signaling pathways following Zeb2 loss, especially the JAK-STAT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways. Moreover, we detected some previously unknown mutations within the human Zeb2 gene (ZFX1B locus) from patients with myeloid disease. Collectively, our results demonstrate that Zeb2 controls adult hematopoietic differentiation and lineage fidelity through widespread modulation of dominant signaling pathways that may contribute to blood disorders.
The zinc finger transcription factor Wilms tumor gene 1 (WT1) acts as an oncogene in acute myeloid leukemia. A naturally occurring alternative splice event between zinc fingers three and four, removing or retaining three amino acids (±KTS), is believed to change the DNA binding affinity of WT1, although there are conflicting data regarding the binding affinity and motifs of the different isoforms. Increased expression of the WT1 -KTS isoform at the expense of the WT1 +KTS isoform is associated with poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia. We determined the genome-wide binding pattern of WT1 -KTS and WT1 +KTS in leukemic K562 cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing. We discovered that the WT1 -KTS isoform predominantly binds close to transcription start sites and to enhancers, in a similar fashion to other transcription factors, whereas WT1 +KTS binding is enriched within gene bodies. We observed a significant overlap between WT1 -KTS and WT1 +KTS target genes, despite the binding sites being distinct. Motif discovery revealed distinct binding motifs for the isoforms, some of which have been previously reported as WT1 binding sites. Additional analyses showed that both WT1 -KTS and WT1 +KTS target genes are more likely to be transcribed than non-targets, and are involved in cell proliferation, cell death, and development. Our study provides evidence that WT1 -KTS and WT1 +KTS share target genes yet still bind distinct locations, indicating isoform-specific regulation in transcription of genes related to cell proliferation and differentiation, consistent with the involvement of WT1 in acute myeloid leukemia.
Studying thermotolerance is important for the prevention of thermostress in chickens. This study aimed to analyze the effect of mutations in the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) gene on chicken thermotolerance. The C.-69A&gt;G SNP in the 5'-flanking region of the HSP70 gene was genotyped in Lingshan and White Recessive Rock (WRR) chickens. Association of this SNP with thermotolerance traits revealed it to be significantly associated with CD4+/CD8+, and potentially associated with heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in WRR chickens exposed to thermoneutral temperature (15°C). Online prediction detected a putative myeloid zinc finger protein 1 binding factor in the C.-69A&gt;G mutation. Under acute thermostress, mRNA levels of HSP70 in individuals with different C.-69A&gt;G genotypes varied in the heart, leg muscle, and liver tissues. The HSP70 protein was expressed at higher levels in individuals with the GG genotype than in those with the AA genotype. In heart and liver, protein expression of HSP70 in individuals with the GG genotype was significantly higher than in those with the AA genotype. In leg muscle, protein expression was higher in birds with the GG genotype than in those with the AA and AG genotypes. Luciferase activity of the GG genotype was significantly higher than that of the AA genotype, suggesting that the C.-69A&gt;G SNP regulates HSP70 gene expression. These results indicate that the C.-69A&gt;G SNP in the 5'-flanking region of the HSP70 gene might affect chicken thermotolerance and that the GG genotype might be advantageous for the prevention of thermostress. 
To address the impact of cellular origin on acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we generated an inducible transgenic mouse model for MLL-AF9-driven leukemia. MLL-AF9 expression in long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSC) in vitro resulted in dispersed clonogenic growth and expression of genes involved in migration and invasion. In vivo, 20% LT-HSC-derived AML were particularly aggressive with extensive tissue infiltration, chemoresistance, and expressed genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in solid cancers. Knockdown of the EMT regulator ZEB1 significantly reduced leukemic blast invasion. By classifying mouse and human leukemias according to Evi1/EVI1 and Erg/ERG expression, reflecting aggressiveness and cell of origin, and performing comparative transcriptomics, we identified several EMT-related genes that were significantly associated with poor overall survival of AML patients.
The t(8;21) translocation is one of the most frequent cytogenetic abnormalities in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and results in the RUNX1/RUNX1T1 rearrangement. Despite the causative role of the RUNX1/RUNX1T1 fusion gene in leukaemia initiation, additional genetic lesions are required for disease development. Here we identify recurring ZBTB7A mutations in 23% (13/56) of AML t(8;21) patients, including missense and truncating mutations resulting in alteration or loss of the C-terminal zinc-finger domain of ZBTB7A. The transcription factor ZBTB7A is important for haematopoietic lineage fate decisions and for regulation of glycolysis. On a functional level, we show that ZBTB7A mutations disrupt the transcriptional repressor potential and the anti-proliferative effect of ZBTB7A. The specific association of ZBTB7A mutations with t(8;21) rearranged AML points towards leukaemogenic cooperativity between mutant ZBTB7A and the RUNX1/RUNX1T1 fusion.
Krüppel-like factor 5 (Klf5) encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor and has been reported to be a direct target of C/EBPα, a master transcription factor critical for formation of granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMP) and leukemic GMP. Using an in vivo hematopoietic-specific gene ablation model, we demonstrate that loss of Klf5 function leads to a progressive increase in peripheral white blood cells, associated with increasing splenomegaly. Long-term hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), short-term HSCs (ST-HSCs), and multipotent progenitors (MPPs) were all significantly reduced in Klf5(Δ/Δ) mice, and knockdown of KLF5 in human CD34(+) cells suppressed colony-forming potential. ST-HSCs, MPPs, and total numbers of committed progenitors were increased in the spleen of Klf5(Δ/Δ) mice, and reduced β1- and β2-integrin expression on hematopoietic progenitors suggests that increased splenic hematopoiesis results from increased stem and progenitor mobilization. Klf5(Δ/Δ) mice show a significant reduction in the fraction of Gr1(+)Mac1(+) cells (neutrophils) in peripheral blood and bone marrow and increased frequency of eosinophils in the peripheral blood, bone marrow, and lung. Thus, these studies demonstrate dual functions of Klf5 in regulating hematopoietic stem and progenitor proliferation and localization in the bone marrow, as well as lineage choice after GMP, promoting increased neutrophil output at the expense of eosinophil production.
One mechanism by which oncoproteins work is through perturbation of cellular maturation; understanding the mechanisms by which this occurs can lead to the development of targeted therapies. EVI1 is a zinc finger oncoprotein involved in the development of acute myeloid leukemia; previous work has shown it to interfere with the maturation of granulocytes from immature precursors. Here we investigate the mechanism by which that occurs, using an immortalized hematopoietic progenitor cell line, EML-C1, as a model system. We document that overexpression of EVI1 abrogates retinoic acid-induced maturation of EML cells into committed myeloid cells, a process that can be documented by the down-regulation of stem cell antigen-1 and acquisition of responsiveness to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. We show that this requires DNA binding capacity of EVI1, suggesting that downstream target genes are involved. We identify the myeloid regulator Cebpa as a target gene and identify two EVI1 binding regions within evolutionarily conserved enhancer elements at +35 and +37 kb relative to the gene. EVI1 can strongly suppress Cebpa transcription, and add-back of Cebpa into EVI1-expressing EML cells partially corrects the block in maturation. We identify the DNA sequences to which EVI1 binds at +35 and +37 kb and show that mutation of one of these releases Cebpa from EVI1-induced suppression. We observe a more complex picture in primary bone marrow cells, where EVI1 suppresses Cebpa in stem cells but not in more committed progenitors. Our data thus identify a regulatory node by which EVI1 contributes to leukemia, and this represents a possible therapeutic target for treatment of EVI1-expressing leukemia.
Total body irradiation combined with chemotherapy is currently the most effective procedure as a preparative myeloablative regimen. However, resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy in refractory acute myeloid leukemia is associated with short-time recurrence after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. To address this issue, we used three cell lines, HL60, HL60/ADR (adriamycin-resistant cells), and HL60/RX (a radiation-resistant cell line established from HL60 cells), as cellular models to investigate the mechanism of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway resulting in radioresistance, and the efficacy of LDE225 (an inhibitor of the Hh pathway) to enhance radiation sensitivity. Our results indicated that HL60/RX and HL60/ADR cells showed an increased in radioresistance and elevated activity of Hh pathway proteins compared with HL60 cells (P&lt;0.001). In addition, LDE225 significantly reduced clonogenic survival with a sensitivity enhancement ratio (SER) of 1.283 for HL60/ADR and 1.245 for HL60/RX cells. The combination of LDE225 with irradiation significantly increased radiation-induced apoptosis and expression of γ-H2AX and BAK compared with single-treatment groups in both HL60/RX and HL60/ADR cells (P&lt;0.001). In vivo, the combination of LDE225 with irradiation exerted a significant antitumor effect compared with the control and single agents in HL60/RX- and HL60/ADR-xenografted mouse models (P&lt;0.001). Furthermore, our data obtained from western blot and IHC analyses showed that the activation of pAKT and NF-kB was reduced by LDE225 treatment in both HL60/ADR and HL60/RX cells. This demonstrates that the Gli-1/PI3K/AKT/NF-kB pathway plays a key role in resistance to radiation, and that inhibition of the Hh pathway sensitizes cells to radiation by overcoming radioresistance. 
Klinefelter syndrome (KS) results from an extra chromosome X, which is due to the failure of normal chromosomal segregation during meiosis. Patients with KS have gynecomastia, small testes, and azoospermia. Apoptosis is a mechanism responsible for the normal regulation of spermatogenesis. LDOC1 gene is a known regulator of nuclear factor mediated pathway to apoptosis through inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB). Furthermore, the transcription factor myeloid zinc finger gene 1 (MZF-1) has been shown to interact with LDOC1 and to enhance LDOC1 activity favoring apoptosis. We investigated the expression of LDOC1 gene mRNA, by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), in peripheral blood leukocytes of 13 patients with KS compared to 13 healthy men chosen as controls. LDOC1 expression was higher in 9 of the 13 KS patient compared to normal controls. These finding led us to hypothesize that LDOC1 gene upregulation may play a role in the spermatogenesis derangement observed in patients with KS. 
Resistance of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) to chemotherapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) causes relapse of disease. Hedgehog (Hh) signaling plays a critical role in the maintenance and differentiation of cancer stem cells. Yet its role in AML remains controversial. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the role of GLI1, the transcriptional activator of Hh signaling, in AML progenitor cells and to explore the anti-AML effects of GLI small-molecule inhibitor GANT61.
The expression of GLI1 mRNA and protein were examined in AML progenitor cells and normal cells. The proliferation, colony formation, apoptosis and differentiation of AML progenitor cells were also analyzed in the presence of GANT61.
Kasumi-1 and KG1a cells, containing more CD34+ cells, expressed higher level of GLI1 compared to U937 and NB4 cells with fewer CD34+ cells. Consistently, a positive correlation between the protein levels of GLI1 and CD34 was validated in the bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC) of AML patients tested. GANT61 inhibited the proliferation and colony formation in AML cell lines. Importantly, GANT61 induced apoptosis in CD34+ enriched Kasumi-1 and KG1a cells, whereas it induced differentiation in U937 and NB4 cells. Furthermore, GANT61 enhanced the cytotoxicity of cytarabine (Ara-c) in primary CD34+ AML cells, indicating that inhibition of GLI1 could be a promising strategy to enhance chemosensitivity.
The present findings suggested that Hh signaling was activated in AML progenitor cells. GLI1 acted as a potential target for AML therapy.
We identify a mutation (D262N) in the erythroid-affiliated transcriptional repressor GFI1B, in an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient with antecedent myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The GFI1B-D262N mutant functionally antagonizes the transcriptional activity of wild-type GFI1B. GFI1B-D262N promoted myelomonocytic versus erythroid output from primary human hematopoietic precursors and enhanced cell survival of both normal and MDS derived precursors. Re-analysis of AML transcriptome data identifies a distinct group of patients in whom expression of wild-type GFI1B and SPI1 (PU.1) have an inverse pattern. In delineating this GFI1B-SPI1 relationship we show that (i) SPI1 is a direct target of GFI1B, (ii) expression of GFI1B-D262N produces elevated expression of SPI1, and (iii) SPI1-knockdown restores balanced lineage output from GFI1B-D262N-expressing precursors. These results table the SPI1-GFI1B transcriptional network as an important regulatory axis in AML as well as in the development of erythroid versus myelomonocytic cell fate. 
The Ecotropic viral integration site 1 (Evi1) is a zinc finger transcription factor, which is located on chromosome 3q26, over-expression in some acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Elevated Evi1 expression in AML is associated with unfavorable prognosis. Therefore, Evi1 is one of the strong candidate in molecular target therapy for the leukemia. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs, vital to many cell functions that negatively regulate gene expression by translation or inducing sequence-specific degradation of target mRNAs. As a novel biologics, miRNAs is a promising therapeutic target due to its low toxicity and low cost. We screened miRNAs which down-regulate Evi1. miR-133 was identified to directly bind to Evi1 to regulate it. miR-133 increases drug sensitivity specifically in Evi1 expressing leukemic cells, but not in Evi1-non-expressing cells The results suggest that miR-133 can be promising therapeutic target for the Evi1 dysregulated poor prognostic leukemia. 
BCL11A encodes a C2H2 type zinc-finger protein. During normal haematopoietic cell differentiation BCL11A expression is down-regulated. Data in mice suggest up-regulation of BCL11A is involved in the pathogenesis of myeloid leukaemias. BCL11A expression in persons with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is not systematically studied.
Interrogate associations between BCL11A expression at diagnosis and clinical and laboratory valuables and outcomes in newly-diagnosed persons with AML.
We determined BCL11A mRNA levels in bone marrow and blood mononuclear cells in 292 consecutive newly-diagnosed subjects with AML by reverse transcript and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Data were compared to mRNA levels in bone marrow cells of normals.
Subjects with BCL11A transcript levels at diagnosis exceeding the median value of 2.434 (±3.423 SD; 25th-75th inter-quartile range, 1.33-4.29) had higher WBC levels, a greater proportion of bone marrow myeloblasts, were more likely to be FAB M0 subtype, less likely to be FAB M3 subtype, more likely to be in the intermediate cytogenetic risk cohort, less likely to have a complex karyotype and more likely to have DNMT3A(R882) and FLT3-ITD mutations than subjects with transcript levels below the median value. In 89 subjects receiving conventional induction chemotherapy the complete remission rate was 54% (95% confidence interval [CI]; 33, 75%) in the lower BCL11A cohort and 65% (45, 85%; P=0.26) in the higher BCL11A cohort. 3 year survival was 33% (2, 65%) in the lower BCL11A cohort and 15% (0, 39%; P=0.35) in the high BCL11A cohort.
BCL11A transcript levels at diagnosis was significantly associated with several clinical and laboratory variables. There were also non-significant associations with complete remission rate and survival. These data suggest a possible role for BCL11A expression in AML biology.
AIRAPL (arsenite-inducible RNA-associated protein-like) is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of cellular proteostasis linked to longevity in nematodes, but its biological function in mammals is unknown. We show herein that AIRAPL-deficient mice develop a fully-penetrant myeloproliferative neoplastic process. Proteomic analysis of AIRAPL-deficient mice revealed that this protein exerts its antineoplastic function through the regulation of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling pathway. We demonstrate that AIRAPL interacts with newly synthesized insulin-related growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) polypeptides, promoting their ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. Accordingly, genetic and pharmacological IGF1R inhibitory strategies prevent the hematological disease found in AIRAPL-deficient mice as well as that in mice carrying the Jak2(V617F) mutation, thereby demonstrating the causal involvement of this pathway in the pathogenesis of myeloproliferative neoplasms. Consistent with its proposed role as a tumor suppressor of myeloid transformation, AIRAPL expression is widely abrogated in human myeloproliferative disorders. Collectively, these findings support the oncogenic relevance of proteostasis deregulation in hematopoietic cells, and they unveil novel therapeutic targets for these frequent hematological neoplasias. 
ZMYND8 (zinc finger MYND (Myeloid, Nervy and DEAF-1)-type containing 8), a newly identified component of the transcriptional coregulator network, was found to interact with the Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase (NuRD) complex. Previous reports have shown that ZMYND8 is instrumental in recruiting the NuRD complex to damaged chromatin for repressing transcription and promoting double strand break repair by homologous recombination. However, the mode of transcription regulation by ZMYND8 has remained elusive. Here, we report that through its specific key residues present in its conserved chromatin-binding modules, ZMYND8 interacts with the selective epigenetic marks H3.1K36Me2/H4K16Ac. Furthermore, ZMYND8 shows a clear preference for canonical histone H3.1 over variant H3.3. Interestingly, ZMYND8 was found to be recruited to several developmental genes, including the all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)-responsive ones, through its modified histone-binding ability. Being itself inducible by ATRA, this zinc finger transcription factor is involved in modulating other ATRA-inducible genes. We found that ZMYND8 interacts with transcription initiation-competent RNA polymerase II phosphorylated at Ser-5 in a DNA template-dependent manner and can alter the global gene transcription. Overall, our study identifies that ZMYND8 has CHD4-independent functions in regulating gene expression through its modified histone-binding ability. 
The transcription factor interferon regulatory factor-8 (IRF8) is highly expressed in myeloid progenitors, while most myeloid leukemias show low or absent expression. Loss of IRF8 in mice leads to a myeloproliferative disorder, indicating a tumor-suppressive role of IRF8. The Wilms tumor gene 1 (WT1) protein represses the IRF8-promoter. The zinc finger protein ZNF224 can act as a transcriptional co-factor of WT1 and potentiate the cytotoxic response to the cytostatic drug cytarabine. We hypothesized that cytarabine upregulates IRF8 and that transcriptional control of IRF8 involves WT1 and ZNF224. Treatment of leukemic K562 cells with cytarabine upregulated IRF8 protein and mRNA, which was correlated to increased expression of ZNF224. Knock down of ZNF224 with shRNA suppressed both basal and cytarabine-induced IRF8 expression. While ZNF224 alone did not affect IRF8 promoter activity, ZNF224 partially reversed the suppressive effect of WT1 on the IRF8 promoter, as judged by luciferase reporter experiments. Coprecipitation revealed nuclear binding of WT1 and ZNF224, and by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments it was demonstrated that WT1 recruits ZNF224 to the IRF8 promoter. We conclude that cytarabine-induced upregulation of the IRF8 in leukemic cells involves increased levels of ZNF224, which can counteract the repressive activity of WT1 on the IRF8-promoter. 
RNA binding proteins (RBPs)-mediated post-transcriptional control has been implicated in influencing various aspects of RNA metabolism and playing important roles in mammalian development and pathological diseases. However, the functions of specific RBPs and the molecular mechanisms through which they act in monocyte/macrophage differentiation remain to be determined. In this study, through bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation, we identify that ZFP36L1, a member of ZFP36 zinc finger protein family, exhibits significant decrease in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients compared with normal controls and remarkable time-course increase during monocyte/macrophage differentiation of PMA-induced THP-1 and HL-60 cells as well as induction culture of CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). Lentivirus-mediated gain and loss of function assays demonstrate that ZFP36L1 acts as a positive regulator to participate in monocyte/macrophage differentiation. Mechanistic investigation further reveals that ZFP36L1 binds to the CDK6 mRNA 3'untranslated region bearing adenine-uridine rich elements and negatively regulates the expression of CDK6 which is subsequently demonstrated to impede the in vitro monocyte/macrophage differentiation of CD34(+) HSPCs. Collectively, our work unravels a ZFP36L1-mediated regulatory circuit through repressing CDK6 expression during monocyte/macrophage differentiation, which may also provide a therapeutic target for AML therapy. 
The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked primary immunodeficiency caused by mutations in the WAS gene and characterized by severe thrombocytopenia. Although the role of WASp in terminally differentiated lymphocytes and myeloid cells is well characterized, its role in early hematopoietic differentiation and in platelets (Plts) biology is poorly understood. In the present manuscript, we have used zinc finger nucleases targeted to the WAS locus for the development of two isogenic WAS knockout (WASKO) human embryonic stem cell lines (hESCs). Upon hematopoietic differentiation, hESCs-WASKO generated increased ratios of CD34(+)CD45(+) progenitors with altered responses to stem cell factor compared to hESCs-WT. When differentiated toward the megakaryocytic linage, hESCs-WASKO produced increased numbers of CD34(+)CD41(+) progenitors, megakaryocytes (MKs), and Plts. hESCs-WASKO-derived MKs and Plts showed altered phenotype as well as defective responses to agonist, mimicking WAS patients MKs and Plts defects. Interestingly, the defects were more evident in WASp-deficient MKs than in WASp-deficient Plts. Importantly, ectopic WAS expression using lentiviral vectors restored normal Plts development and MKs responses. These data validate the AND-1_WASKO cell lines as a human cellular model for basic research and for preclinical studies for WAS. 
Ecotropic virus integration site-1 (EVI-1) gene, locus on chromosome 3 (3q26.2) in the human genome, was first found in the AKXD strain of mice, in a model of retrovirus-induced acute myeloid leukemia (AML) established twenty years ago. Since then, EVI-1 was regarded as one of the most invasive proto-oncogenes in human leukemia. EVI-1 can encode a unique zinc-finger protein of 145 kDa that can bind with DNA, and its overexpression was closely related to human hemopoietic diseases. Furthermore, accumulating research indicates that EVI-1 is involved in the differentiation, apoptosis and proliferation of leukemia cells. The present review focuses on the biochemical properties of EVI-1 which plays a role in myeloid malignancies.
The plant homeodomain (PHD) finger 6 (PHF6) is a multidomain protein that comprises four nuclear localization signals and two extended PHD zinc finger domains (ePHD), suggesting that the PHD domains of PHF6 may have different functions compared with other PHD domains. And the PHF6 was first identified as the gene mutated associated with Börjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome, an X-linked mental retardation disorder. The mutant PHF6 is also associated with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia. But the molecular mechanism between these diseases and PHF6 are still unclear. In addition, the first conserved ePHD (ePHD1) of PHF6 is involved in its nucleolus localization, directly interacts with upstream binding factor (UBF) and suppresses rRNA transcription. Here we show the backbone resonance and side chain assignments of the PHF6-ePHD1 domain from human by heteronuclear multidimensional NMR spectroscopy and its secondary structure as predicted by the TALOS+. These assignments of PHF6-ePHD1 domain throw a light on the further structure determination, dynamics and interaction with UBF. 
Heterozygous germline mutations in the zinc finger transcription factor GATA2 have recently been shown to underlie a range of clinical phenotypes, including Emberger syndrome, a disorder characterized by lymphedema and predisposition to myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML). Despite well-defined roles in hematopoiesis, the functions of GATA2 in the lymphatic vasculature and the mechanisms by which GATA2 mutations result in lymphedema have not been characterized. Here, we have provided a molecular explanation for lymphedema predisposition in a subset of patients with germline GATA2 mutations. Specifically, we demonstrated that Emberger-associated GATA2 missense mutations result in complete loss of GATA2 function, with respect to the capacity to regulate the transcription of genes that are important for lymphatic vessel valve development. We identified a putative enhancer element upstream of the key lymphatic transcriptional regulator PROX1 that is bound by GATA2, and the transcription factors FOXC2 and NFATC1. Emberger GATA2 missense mutants had a profoundly reduced capacity to bind this element. Conditional Gata2 deletion in mice revealed that GATA2 is required for both development and maintenance of lymphovenous and lymphatic vessel valves. Together, our data unveil essential roles for GATA2 in the lymphatic vasculature and explain why a select catalogue of human GATA2 mutations results in lymphedema. 
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) are chronic inflammatory diseases that together affect 2-3% of the population. RA and AS predominantly involve joints, but heart disease is also a common feature in RA and AS patients. Here we have studied a new spontaneous mutation that causes severe polyarthritis in bone phenotype spontaneous mutation 1 (BPSM1) mice. In addition to joint destruction, mutant mice also develop aortic root aneurism and aorto-mitral valve disease that can be fatal depending on the genetic background. The cause of the disease is the spontaneous insertion of a retrotransposon into the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which triggers its strong overexpression in myeloid cells. We found that several members of a family of RNA-binding, CCCH-containing zinc-finger proteins control TNF expression through its 3'UTR, and we identified a previously unidentified regulatory element in the UTR. The disease in BPSM1 mice is independent of the adaptive immune system and does not appear to involve inflammatory cytokines other than TNF. To our knowledge, this is the first animal model showing both polyarthritis and heart disease as a direct result of TNF deregulation. These results emphasize the therapeutic potential of anti-TNF drugs for the treatment of heart valve disease and identify potential therapeutic targets to control TNF expression and inflammation. 
Ikaros, a zinc finger transcription factor, is an important regulator of the hematopoietic system. Several studies have suggested the role of Ikaros in the development, maturation, activation and differentiation of lymphocytes. To elucidate this mechanism, it is important to understand how this transcription factor works in the dichotomy of the hematopoietic system, a topic that remains uncertain. Herein, we investigated the role of Ikaros in the control of the lymphomyeloid phenotype of B-1 lymphocytes. We found that Ikaros, as well as its target genes, are expressed in B-1 cells,. Moreover, Ikaros positively regulates the expression of Flt3, Gfi and Il7r, while it down-regulates PU.1. During the induction of differentiation of B-1 cells toward phagocytes, Ikaros transcription was reduced. Taken together, these data pointed to the relevance of Ikaros in the maintenance of the promiscuous gene profile of B-1 cells. It could be suggested that Ikaros functions as a guardian of B-1 lymphoid pattern, and that its absence directs the differentiation of B-1 cells into phagocytes. 
GATA-1, a zinc finger transcription factor, has been demonstrated to play a key role in the progression of leukemia. In this study, we investigate the effects of wogonoside, a naturally bioactive flavonoid derived from Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, on cell growth and cell cycle in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells, and uncover its underlying mechanisms. The experimental design comprised CML cell lines K562, imatinib-resistant K562 (K562r) cells, and primary CML cells, treated in vitro or in vivo, respectively, with wogonoside; growth and cell cycle were then evaluated. We found that wogonoside could induce growth inhibition and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in both normal and K562r cells. Wogonoside promotes the expression of GATA-1 and facilitates the binding to methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) and p21 promoter, thus inhibiting MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling and cell cycle checkpoint proteins, including CDK2, CDK4, cyclin A, and cyclin D1, and increasing p21 expression. Furthermore, in vivo studies showed that administration of wogonoside decreased CML cells and prolonged survival in NOD/SCID mice with CML cell xenografts. In conclusion, these results clearly revealed the inhibitory effect of wogonoside on the growth in CML cells and suggested that wogonoside may act as a promising drug for the treatment of imatinib-resistant CML. 
Dormant leukemia stem cells (LSC) promote therapeutic resistance and leukemic progression as a result of unbridled activation of stem cell gene expression programs. Thus, we hypothesized that 1) deregulation of the hedgehog (Hh) stem cell self-renewal and cell cycle regulatory pathway would promote dormant human LSC generation and 2) that PF-04449913, a clinical antagonist of the GLI2 transcriptional activator, smoothened (SMO), would enhance dormant human LSC eradication.
To test these postulates, whole transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), microarray, qRT-PCR, stromal co-culture, confocal fluorescence microscopic, nanoproteomic, serial transplantation and cell cycle analyses were performed on FACS purified normal, chronic phase (CP) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), blast crisis (BC) phase CML progenitors with or without PF-04449913 treatment.
Notably, RNA-seq analyses revealed that Hh pathway and cell cycle regulatory gene overexpression correlated with leukemic progression. While lentivirally enforced GLI2 expression enhanced leukemic progenitor dormancy in stromal co-cultures, this was not observed with a mutant GLI2 lacking a transactivation domain, suggesting that GLI2 expression prevented cell cycle transit. Selective SMO inhibition with PF-04449913 in humanized stromal co-cultures and LSC xenografts reduced downstream GLI2 protein and cell cycle regulatory gene expression. Moreover, SMO inhibition enhanced cell cycle transit and sensitized BC LSC to tyrosine kinase inhibition in vivo at doses that spare normal HSC.
In summary, while GLI2, forms part of a core HH pathway transcriptional regulatory network that promotes human myeloid leukemic progression and dormant LSC generation, selective inhibition with PF-04449913 reduces the dormant LSC burden thereby providing a strong rationale for clinical trials predicated on SMO inhibition in combination with TKIs or chemotherapeutic agents with the ultimate aim of obviating leukemic therapeutic resistance, persistence and progression.
Snail2 is a zinc finger transcription factor involved in driving epithelial to mesenchymal transitions. Snail2 null mice are viable, but display defects in melanogenesis, gametogenesis and hematopoiesis, and are markedly radiosensitive. Here, using mouse genetics, we have studied the contributions of Snail2 to epidermal homeostasis and skin carcinogenesis. Snail2 (-/-) mice presented a defective epidermal terminal differentiation and, unexpectedly, an increase in number, size and malignancy of tumor lesions when subjected to the two-stage mouse skin chemical carcinogenesis protocol, compared with controls. Additionally, tumor lesions from Snail2 (-/-) mice presented a high inflammatory component with an elevated percentage of myeloid precursors in tumor lesions that was further increased in the presence of the anti-inflammatory agent dexamethasone. In vitro studies in Snail2 null keratinocytes showed that loss of Snail2 leads to a decrease in proliferation indicating a non-cell autonomous role for Snail2 in the skin carcinogenic response observed in vivo. Bone marrow (BM) cross-reconstitution assays between Snail2 wild-type and null mice showed that Snail2 absence in the hematopoietic system fully reproduces the tumor behavior of the Snail2 null mice and triggers the accumulation of myeloid precursors in the BM, blood and tumor lesions. These results indicate a new role for Snail2 in preventing myeloid precursors recruitment impairing skin chemical carcinogenesis progression. 
The Wilms' tumour gene 1 protein (WT1) is a zinc finger transcription factor found indispensable for foetal development. WT1 has also been implicated in the development of tumours in several organ systems, including acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Four main WT1 isoforms come from 2 alternative splice events. One alternative splice results in the inclusion or exclusion of 3 amino acids, KTS, between zinc fingers 3 and 4 in the WT1 protein. The KTS insert has been extensively investigated due to the functional implications for DNA and RNA binding. In this review, we provide an overview of the research into the isoforms containing or lacking the KTS insert in leukaemic cells, as well as the research into the binding patterns of the WT1 -KTS and +KTS isoforms to DNA and RNA. Finally, we connect the results of the DNA binding research to the ChIP-CHIP and ChIP-Seq investigations into the global genomic binding of the WT1 protein that have recently been performed.
We present the molecular landscape of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and characterize nearly 1,000 participants in Children's Oncology Group (COG) AML trials. The COG-National Cancer Institute (NCI) TARGET AML initiative assessed cases by whole-genome, targeted DNA, mRNA and microRNA sequencing and CpG methylation profiling. Validated DNA variants corresponded to diverse, infrequent mutations, with fewer than 40 genes mutated in &gt;2% of cases. In contrast, somatic structural variants, including new gene fusions and focal deletions of MBNL1, ZEB2 and ELF1, were disproportionately prevalent in young individuals as compared to adults. Conversely, mutations in DNMT3A and TP53, which were common in adults, were conspicuously absent from virtually all pediatric cases. New mutations in GATA2, FLT3 and CBL and recurrent mutations in MYC-ITD, NRAS, KRAS and WT1 were frequent in pediatric AML. Deletions, mutations and promoter DNA hypermethylation convergently impacted Wnt signaling, Polycomb repression, innate immune cell interactions and a cluster of zinc finger-encoding genes associated with KMT2A rearrangements. These results highlight the need for and facilitate the development of age-tailored targeted therapies for the treatment of pediatric AML.
Lymphoid lineage commitment is an important process in haematopoiesis, which forms the immune system to protect the host from pathogen invasion. However, how multipotent progenitors (MPP) switch into common lymphoid progenitors (CLP) or common myeloid progenitors (CMP) during this process remains elusive. Here we show that PCI domain-containing protein 2 (Pcid2) is highly expressed in MPPs. Pcid2 deletion in the haematopoietic system causes skewed lymphoid lineage specification. In MPPs, Pcid2 interacts with the Zinc finger HIT-type containing 1 (ZNHIT1) to block Snf2-related CREBBP activator protein (SRCAP) activity and prevents the deposition of histone variant H2A.Z and transcription factor PU.1 to key lymphoid fate regulator genes. Furthermore, Znhit1 deletion also abrogates H2A/H2A.Z exchange in MPPs. Thus Pcid2 controls lymphoid lineage commitment through the regulation of SRCAP remodelling activity.
There is substantial evidence that early growth response-1 (Egr1) gene, a zinc-finger transcription factor, behaves as a tumor suppressor in leukemia. This includes reports from this laboratory that constitutive Egr1 overrides leukemia conferred by deregulated c-Myc or E2F-1 in the M1 myeloid leukemic cell line by promoting differentiation. To investigate the effect of Egr1 on the initiation and progression of Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML), lethally irradiated syngeneic wild type mice were reconstituted with bone marrow (BM) from either wild type or Egr1 null mice transduced with a 210-kD BCR-ABL-expressing MSCV-retrovirus (bone marrow transplantation {BMT}). Loss of Egr1 was observed to accelerate the development of BCR-ABL driven leukemia in recipient mice, resulting in the development of a more aggressive disease, a significantly shortened median survival time, and increased BCR-ABL expressing leukemic stem/progenitor cells (GFP+Lin-cKit+Sca+). Egr1 deficient progenitors expressing BCR-ABL exhibited decreased apoptosis, and increased cell viability and proliferation relative to WT counterparts. Secondary BMT of BCR-ABL BM revealed that loss of Egr1 resulted in enrichment of LSCs, consistent with shorter survival time and more aggressive disease of these mice compared to WT counterparts. Furthermore, serial re-plating colony assays indicated that loss of Egr1 increased self-renewal ability of BCR-ABL expressing BM. These novel findings on the tumor suppressor role of Egr1 in CML provide the impetus to study the effect of altering Egr1 expression in AML, where the overall five year survival rate remains low. The effect of loss of Egr1 in CML could reflect its established functions in normal hematopoiesis, maintaining quiescence of HSCs and driving terminal differentiation to the monocyte/macrophage lineage. Gain of function studies should validate these conclusions and provide further rationale for increased Egr1 as a therapeutic target in AML.
Transposable elements (TEs) compose about 40% of the murine genome. Retrotransposition of active TEs such as LINE-1 (L1) tremendously impacts genetic diversification and genome stability. Therefore, transcription and transposition activities of retrotransposons are tightly controlled. Here, we show that the Krüppel-like zinc finger protein Zfp281 directly binds and suppresses a subset of retrotransposons, including the active young L1 repeat elements, in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. In addition, we find that Zfp281-regulated L1s are highly enriched for 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and H3K4me3. The COMPASS-like H3K4 methyltransferase Mll2 is the major H3K4me3 methylase at the Zfp281-regulated L1s and required for their proper expression. Our studies also reveal that Zfp281 functions partially through recruiting the L1 regulators DNA hydroxymethylase Tet1 and Sin3A, and restricting Mll2 at these active L1s, leading to their balanced expression. In summary, our data indicate an instrumental role of Zfp281 in suppressing the young active L1s in mouse ES cells.
Direct interactions between pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members form the basis of cell death decision-making at the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). Here we report that three anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins (MCL-1, BCL-2 and BCL-XL) found untethered from the OMM function as transcriptional regulators of a prosurvival and growth program. Anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins engage a BCL-2 homology (BH) domain sequence found in SUFU (suppressor of fused), a tumour suppressor and antagonist of the GLI DNA-binding proteins. BCL-2 proteins directly promote SUFU turnover, inhibit SUFU-GLI interaction, and induce the expression of the GLI target genes BCL-2, MCL-1 and BCL-XL. Anti-apoptotic BCL-2 protein/SUFU feedforward signalling promotes cancer cell survival and growth, and can be disabled with BH3 mimetics-small molecules that target anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins. Our findings delineate a chemical strategy for countering drug resistance in GLI-associated tumours and reveal unanticipated functions for BCL-2 proteins as transcriptional regulators.
Background: Protein kinase C alpha (PKCα) is a key signaling molecule in human cancer development. As a therapeutic strategy, targeting PKCα is difficult because the molecule is ubiquitously expressed in non-malignant cells. PKCα is regulated by the cooperative interaction of the transcription factors myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF-1) and Ets-like protein-1 (Elk-1) in human cancer cells. Methods: By conducting tissue array analysis, herein, we determined the protein expression of MZF-1/Elk-1/PKCα in various cancers. Results: The data show that the expression of MZF-1/Elk-1 is correlated with that of PKCα in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but not in bladder and lung cancers. In addition, the PKCα down-regulation by shRNA Elk-1 was only observed in the HCC SK-Hep-1 cells. Blocking the interaction between MZF-1 and Elk-1 through the transfection of their binding domain MZF-160-72 decreased PKCα expression. This step ultimately depressed the epithelial-mesenchymal transition potential of the HCC cells. Conclusion: These findings could be used to develop an alternative therapeutic strategy against patients with the PKCα-derived HCC.
Hematopoiesis involves a series of lineage differentiation programs initiated in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) found in bone marrow (BM). To ensure lifelong hematopoiesis, various molecular mechanisms are needed to maintain the HSC pool. CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a DNA-binding, zinc-finger protein that regulates the expression of its target gene by organizing higher order chromatin structures. Currently, the role of CTCF in controlling HSC homeostasis is unknown. Using a tamoxifen-inducible CTCF conditional knockout mouse system, we aimed to determine whether CTCF regulates the homeostatic maintenance of HSCs. In adult mice, acute systemic CTCF ablation led to severe BM failure and the rapid shrinkage of multiple c-Kithi progenitor populations, including Sca-1+ HSCs. Similarly, hematopoietic system-confined CTCF depletion caused an acute loss of HSCs and highly increased mortality. Mixed BM chimeras reconstituted with supporting BM demonstrated that CTCF deficiency-mediated HSC depletion has both cell-extrinsic and cell-intrinsic effects. Although c-Kithi myeloid progenitor cell populations were severely reduced after ablating Ctcf, c-Kitint common lymphoid progenitors and their progenies were less affected by the lack of CTCF. Whole-transcriptome microarray and cell cycle analyses indicated that CTCF deficiency results in the enhanced expression of the cell cycle-promoting program, and that CTCF-depleted HSCs express higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Importantly, in vivo treatment with an antioxidant partially rescued c-Kithi cell populations and their quiescence. Altogether, our results suggest that CTCF is indispensable for maintaining adult HSC pools, likely by regulating ROS-dependent HSC quiescence.
Acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) is a clonal disorder due to bone marrow failure and uncontrolled proliferation of myeloid lineage. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a subtype of AML. Heterocyclic compounds, such as indole, are considered as attractive candidates for cancer therapy, due to their abundance in nature and known biological activity. Sal-like protein (SALL4) is a zinc finger transcription factor involving in the multi-potency of stem cells, in the NB4 cell line. This study was aimed to evaluate the effects of basal indole and its new derivative, 2-(1-((2, 4-Aril)imino)-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) phenyl-1H Indole-3- carbaldehyde (TFPHC), on the expression of SALL4.
Cells were cultured and treated with different concentrations (75, 150, and 300 µg/mL) of the new indole derivative and DMSO, as a vehicle control, for 24 and 48 hours. Cell proliferation was evaluated by using Trypan blue exclusion and MTT assays. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by flowcytometry analysis using the Annexin V/PI apoptosis detection kit; mRNA expression of SALL4 was studied using absolute quantitative RT-PCR. Data were analyzed by student's t-test. P&lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Our findings demonstrated the effects of new indole derivatives on SALL4 mRNA expression. Expression of SALL4 mRNA was significantly decreased at 75, 150, and 300 µg/mL concentrations.
SALL4 plays a role in the survival of APL cells. SALL4 expression could be suppressed by the novel indole derivative. Additionally, SALL4 gene suppression can serve as a target in APL therapy.
Zinc finger protein 687 (ZNF687), identified as a C2H2 zinc finger protein, has been found to be mutated and upregulated in giant cell tumor of bone and acute myeloid leukemia, suggesting an oncogenic role for ZNF687 in cancer. However, the clinical significance and precise role of ZNF687 in cancer progression are largely unknown. Herein, we report that ZNF687 was markedly upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines and HCC tissues, and was significantly correlated with relapse-free survival in HCC. ZNF687 overexpression greatly enhanced HCC cell capability for tumorsphere formation, invasion and chemoresistance in vitro, whereas inhibiting ZNF687 reduced these capabilities and inhibited HCC cell tumorigenic capability in vivo. Importantly, extreme limiting dilution analysis revealed that even 1 × 102 ZNF687-transduced cells could form tumors in vivo, indicating that ZNF687 contributes to HCC recurrence. Moreover, we demonstrate that ZNF687 transcriptionally upregulated the expression of the pluripotency-associated factors BMI1, OCT4 and NANOG by directly targeting their promoters. Therefore, our results suggest that ZNF687 has a promoter role in regulating HCC progression, which provides a potential therapeutic target for HCC in humans.
The association between long non-coding RNA zinc finger antisense 1 (ZFAS1) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has not yet been investigated. The present study aimed to assess the potential role of ZFAS1 in AML cell proliferation and apoptosis. The expression of ZFAS1 mRNA in various AML cell lines (HL-60, KG-1, ML-1 and SKNO-1) was measured by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that ZFAS1 expression was increased in all four human AML cell lines compared with the control cell lines (T lymphocytic leukemia or Burkitt's lymphoma). Transfection with small interfering RNA into human AML cells established ZFAS1 knockdown. A cell-counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to investigate the effect of ZFAS1 on AML cell proliferation and the effect of ZFAS1 on the cell cycle and cell apoptosis was assessed using flow cytometry. Notably, the CCK-8 assay demonstrated that ZFAS1 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation in HL-60 and SKNO-1 cell lines and flow cytometry analysis indicated that ZFAS1 knockdown induced AML cell cycle G1 phase arrest and triggered cell apoptosis. Therefore, the present study indicated that ZFAS1 promoted the proliferation and inhibited the apoptosis of AML cells.
Heterozygous GATA2 mutations underlie an array of complex hematopoietic and lymphatic diseases. Analysis of the literature reporting three recurrent GATA2 germline (g) mutations (gT354M, gR396Q and gR398W) revealed different phenotype tendencies. Although all three mutants differentially predispose to myeloid malignancies, there was no difference in leukemia-free survival for GATA2 patients. Despite intense interest, the molecular pathogenesis of GATA2 mutation is poorly understood. We functionally characterized a GATA2 mutant allelic series representing major disease phenotypes caused by germline and somatic (s) mutations in zinc finger 2 (ZF2). All GATA2 mutants, except for sL359V, displayed reduced DNA-binding affinity and transactivation compared with wild type (WT), which could be attributed to mutations of arginines critical for DNA binding or amino acids required for ZF2 domain structural integrity. Two GATA2 mutants (gT354M and gC373R) bound the key hematopoietic differentiation factor PU.1 more strongly than WT potentially perturbing differentiation via sequestration of PU.1. Unlike WT, all mutants failed to suppress colony formation and some mutants skewed cell fate to granulocytes, consistent with the monocytopenia phenotype seen in GATA2-related immunodeficiency disorders. These findings implicate perturbations of GATA2 function shaping the course of development of myeloid malignancy subtypes and strengthen complete or nearly complete haploinsufficiency for predisposition to lymphedema.
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells show constitutive release of matrix metalloproteases and their inhibitors. We now investigated this constitutive release of protease/protease regulators associated with carcinogenesis (ADAM12, uPA, cystatin B), angiogenesis (serpin E1, uPA, CD147), cancer cell migration (uPA, cystatin C), coagulation (ADAM TS13, serpin C1), inflammation (fetuin A, caspase 1, cystatin C), monocytic differentiation (CFD) or regulation of hematopoiesis (neutrophil elastase).
AML blasts from 79 consecutive patients were cultured in serum-free medium and mediator levels determined in culture supernatants.
Detectable release of serpin C1 and E1, cystatin B and C, CD147 and uPA was seen for most patients. These mediators together with fetuin A, caspase 1, and CFD were included in a hierarchical clustering analysis and three patient subsets were identified (high, intermediate, and low release). High levels were associated with monocytic differentiation. Global gene expression analyses showed increased levels of several zinc finger proteins for low-release patients and high expression of several cell surface molecules, ATPases, and calcium-binding proteins for high-release patients. Constitutive release of several mediators was also seen for normal hematopoietic cells and mesenchymal stem cells. In cocultures of the latter and AML blasts, the release level for most mediators was altered to resemble the levels of the mesenchymal cells cultured alone.
Differences in constitutive release of protease/protease regulators are a part of the disease heterogeneity in AML.
Pluripotent stem cells, including induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), have the capacity to differentiate towards all three germ layers and have been highlighted as an attractive cell source for the field of regenerative medicine. Thus, stable expression of therapeutic transgenes in iPSCs, as well as thereof derived progeny of hematopoietic lineage, may lay the foundation for innovative cell replacement therapies.
We have utilized human iPSC lines genetically modified by lentiviral vector technology or targeted integration of reporter genes to evaluate transgene expression during hematopoietic specification and differentiation towards macrophages.
Use of lentiviral vectors equipped with an ubiquitous chromatin opening element (CBX3-UCOE) as well as zinc finger nuclease-mediated targeting of an expression cassette into the human adeno-associated virus integration site 1 (AAVS1) safe harbor resulted in stable transgene expression in iPSCs. When iPSCs were differentiated along the myeloid pathway into macrophages, both strategies yielded sustained transgene expression during the hematopoietic specification process including mature CD14+ and CD11b+ macrophages.
Combination of human iPSC technology with either lentiviral vector technology or designer nuclease-based genome editing allows for the generation of transgenic iPSC-derived macrophages with stable transgene expression which may be useful for novel cell and gene replacement therapies.
Zinc finger E-box binding protein 1 (ZEB1) and ZEB2 induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhance cancer progression. However, the global view of transcriptional regulation by ZEB1 and ZEB2 is yet to be elucidated. Here, we identified a ZEB1-regulated inflammatory phenotype in breast cancer cells using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA sequencing, followed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of ZEB1-bound genes. Knockdown of ZEB1 and/or ZEB2 resulted in the downregulation of genes encoding inflammatory cytokines related to poor prognosis in patients with cancer, including IL6 and IL8, therefore suggesting that ZEB1 and ZEB2 have similar functions in terms of the regulation of production of inflammatory cytokines. Antibody array and ELISA experiments confirmed that ZEB1 controlled the production of the IL-6 and IL-8 proteins. The secretory proteins regulated by ZEB1 enhanced breast cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. ZEB1 expression in breast cancer cells also affected the growth of fibroblasts in cell culture, and the accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in tumors in vivo. These findings provide insight into the role of ZEB1 in the progression of cancer, mediated by inflammatory cytokines, along with the initiation of EMT.
DNA methylation patterns are frequently deregulated in t(8;21) acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), but little is known of the mechanisms by which specific gene sets become aberrantly methylated. Here, we found that the promoter DNA methylation signature of t(8;21)+ AML blasts differs from that of t(8;21)- AMLs. This study demonstrated that a novel hypermethylated zinc finger-containing protein, THAP10, is a target gene and can be epigenetically suppressed by AML1-ETO at the transcriptional level in t(8;21) AML. Our findings also show that THAP10 is a bona fide target of miR-383 that can be epigenetically activated by the AML1-ETO recruiting co-activator p300. In this study, we demonstrated that epigenetic suppression of THAP10 is the mechanistic link between AML1-ETO fusion proteins and tyrosine kinase cascades. In addition, we showed that THAP10 is a nuclear protein that inhibits myeloid proliferation and promotes differentiation both in vitro and in vivo Altogether, our results revealed an unexpected and important epigenetic mini-circuit of AML1-ETO/THAP10/miR-383 in t(8;21) AML, in which epigenetic suppression of THAP10 predicts a poor clinical outcome and represents a novel therapeutic target.
Enhanced migratory potential and invasiveness of cancer cells contribute crucially to cancer progression. These phenotypes are achieved by precise alteration of invasion-associated genes through local epigenetic modifications which are recognized by a class of proteins termed a chromatin reader. ZMYND8 [zinc finger MYND (myeloid, Nervy and DEAF-1)-type containing 8], a key component of the transcription regulatory network, has recently been shown to be a novel reader of H3.1K36Me2/H4K16Ac marks. Through differential gene expression analysis upon silencing this chromatin reader, we identified a subset of genes involved in cell proliferation and invasion/migration regulated by ZMYND8. Detailed analysis uncovered its antiproliferative activity through BrdU incorporation, alteration in the expression of proliferation markers, and cell cycle regulating genes and cell viability assays. In addition, performing wound healing and invasion/migration assays, its anti-invasive nature is evident. Interestingly, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key mechanism of cellular invasion, is regulated by ZMYND8 where we identified its selective enrichment on promoters of CLDN1/CDH1 genes, rich in H3K36Me2/H4K16Ac marks, leading to their up-regulation. Thus, the presence of ZMYND8 could be implicated in maintaining the epithelial phenotype of cells. Furthermore, syngeneic mice, injected with ZMYND8-overexpressed invasive breast cancer cells, showed reduction in tumor volume and weight. In concert with this, we observed a significant down-regulation of ZMYND8 in invasive ductal and lobular breast cancer tissues compared with normal tissue. Taken together, our study elucidates a novel function of ZMYND8 in regulating EMT and invasion of cancer cells, possibly through its chromatin reader function.
Deletion 20q is a recurrent abnormality in myeloid malignancies. In our previous study, we identified fusion of the additional sex combs-like 1 (ASXL1) and teashirt zinc finger homeobox 2 genes in a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome. The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of ASXL1 breakpoints in a cohort of 36 patients with deletion 20q as the sole cytogenetic aberration. A combination of molecular cytogenetic methods was used to confirm ASXL1 gene alterations in 19 of the 36 patients, and the determination of ASXL1 gene changes in patients with deletion 20q revealed clinical and prognostic impacts.
The balance between self-renewal and differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) maintains hematopoietic homeostasis, failure of which can lead to hematopoietic disorder. HSPC fate is controlled by signals from the bone marrow niche resulting in alteration of the stem cell transcription network. Regnase-1, a member of the CCCH zinc finger protein family possessing RNAse activity, mediates post-transcriptional regulatory activity through degradation of target mRNAs. The precise function of Regnase-1 has been explored in inflammation-related cytokine expression but its function in hematopoiesis has not been elucidated. Here, we show that Regnase-1 regulates self-renewal of HSPCs through modulating the stability of Gata2 and Tal1 mRNA. In addition, we found that dysfunction of Regnase-1 leads to the rapid onset of abnormal hematopoiesis. Thus, our data reveal that Regnase-1-mediated post-transcriptional regulation is required for HSPC maintenance and suggest that it represents a leukemia tumor suppressor.
Relapse of minimal residual disease (MRD) is a major problem after conventional chemotherapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The bone marrow stroma can protect AML cells from insults of chemotherapy, partly contributing to AML relapse. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is the main component of arsenical traditional Chinese medicines and has been widely used for the treatment of hematologic malignancies particularly acute promyelocytic leukemia over the past three decades. ATO acts through a direct arsenic binding to cysteine residues in zinc fingers located in promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), thus killing the leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Our prior study has demonstrated that adhesion to stroma cells could render AML cells resistant to ATO but the detailed mechanism remains to be explored. Here, we report that the adhesion-induced resistance to ATO is related to the up-regulation of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1). Homoharringtonine (HHT) can potentiate the anti-leukemia effects of ATO on adhered AML cells by suppressing Mcl-1 through glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β). Furthermore, a potentiating effect of HHT on ATO was also observed in primary AML cells and AML xenografted tumors. Thus, these data indicate that HHT could enhance ATO anti-leukemia activity both in vitro and in vivo.
Monocytic leukemia zinc-finger protein (MOZ) has been found to form fusion proteins with many regulators in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the molecular functions and underlying mechanism of MOZ in AML is not well understood. Here, clinical MOZ expression analysis combined with data integration from the TCGA and GEO databases indicated that a low level of MOZ was associated with poor prognosis. MOZ knockdown inhibited monocyte differentiation and increased resistance to chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis in THP-1 or U937 cells. In addition, we found that genetic silencing of MOZ suppressed AP-1 and AKT activity in the context of lipopolysaccharide stimulation, resulting in diminished M1 activation of macrophages. We further showed that MOZ was a validated target of miR-223 and functioned as a repressor of miR-223 expression. Our study indicates that a molecular network involving MOZ and miR-223 contributes to the monocyte differentiation and polarization program, which is deregulated in AML.
The aim of this study was to determine whether leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) exerts its neuroprotective effects through signal transduction of the transcription factor myeloid zinc finger-1 (MZF-1). According to the hypothesis of this study, MZF-1 mediates LIF-induced neuroprotective signaling during ELVO through increased expression and transcriptional activity. To determine the in vivo role of MZF-1 in LIF-induced neuroprotection, we used Genomatix software was used to MZF-1 sites in the promoter region of the rat superoxide dismutase 3 (SOD3) gene. Stroke was induced via middle cerebral artery occlusion, and animals were administered PBS or 125 μg/kg LIF at 6, 24, and 48 h after the injury. MZF-1 binding activity was measured using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and its expression/localization were determined using western blot and immunohistochemical analysis. To determine whether MZF-1 relays LIF-induced neuroprotection in vitro, primary cultured neurons were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) after treatment with PBS or LIF. MZF-1 expression was measured in vitro using real time PCR and immunohistochemical staining. Transfection with siRNA was used to determine whether LIF protected cultured neurons against OGD after silencing MZF-1 expression. Four MZF-1 binding sites were identified by Genomatix, and EMSA confirmed in vivo binding activity in brain after MCAO. LIF significantly increased MZF-1 protein levels compared to PBS treatment at 72 h post-MCAO. In vivo nuclear localization of MZF-1 as well as co-localization of SOD3 and MZF-1 was observed in the cortical neurons of LIF-treated rats. Primary cultured neurons treated with LIF had significantly higher levels of MZF-1 mRNA and protein after LIF treatment compared to neurons treated with PBS. Finally, knockdown MZF-1 using siRNA counteracted the neuroprotective effects of LIF in vitro. These data demonstrate that LIF-mediated neuroprotection is dependent upon MZF-1 activity. Furthermore, these findings identify a novel neuroprotective pathway that employs MZF-1, a transcription factor associated with hematopoietic gene expression.
Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are the key epigenetic regulators of normal hematopoiesis and the dysregulation of their functions is closely involved in the pathogenesis of hematological malignancies. These proteins function in the multimeric complexes called polycomb repressive complex (PRC) 1 and 2. In addition to canonical PRC1, four noncanonical PRC1 complexes have been identified. In contrast to canonical PRC1, which is recruited to its target sites in a manner dependent on H3K27me3, noncanonical PRC1 complexes are recruited to their target sites independently of H3K27me3. Among them, PRC1.1, consisting of PCGF1, RING1A/B, KDM2B, and BCL6 corepressor (BCOR) or BCLRL1, regulates diverse biological processes, including pluripotency, reprogramming, and hematopoiesis. PRC1.1 has been implicated in myelopoiesis and lymphopoiesis and is targeted by somatic gene mutations in various hematological malignancies. These findings revealed the more complex regulation of epigenetic cellular memory by PcG proteins than we expected and propose PRC1.1 as a novel therapeutic target in hematological malignancies.
Leukemia is the most frequent malignancy in children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as the second commonest type. Long non-coding RNA zinc finger antisense 1 (ZFAS1) has been widely reported as an oncogenic factor in multiple malignancies including AML. However, the roles and molecular mechanisms of ZFAS1 in the tumorigenesis of AML are poor defined till now. In the present study, RT-qPCR assay showed that ZFAS1 was highly expressed in bone marrow of acute leukemia patients and AML cell lines. Loss-of-function analyses revealed that ZFAS1 knockdown inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis in AML cells and curbed AML xenograft growth in vivo. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay unveiled that microRNA-150 (miR-150) could interact with ZFAS1, Myb 3' UTR and Sp1 3' UTR. Moreover, ZFAS1 acted as a molecular sponge of miR-150, giving rise to the downregulation of miR-150 level and upregulation of Myb and Sp1 levels. Moreover, miR-150 overexpression resulted in the reduction of AML cell proliferative ability and the increase of cell apoptotic rate. Additionally, the inhibition of miR-150 abrogated ZFAS1 loss-mediated anti-leukemia effects. In summary, our data demonstrated that ZFAS1 knockdown hampered AML progression by regulating miR-150/Myb and miR-150/Sp1 pathways, providing some potential biomarkers or targets for the diagnosis and treatment of leukemia.
Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) is a zinc finger transcriptional regulator, and has been implicated as both a tumor suppressor and oncogene in various malignancies. Mutations in the DNA-binding domain of the WT1 gene are described in 10-15% of normal-karyotype AML (NK-AML) in pediatric and adult patients. Similar WT1 mutations have been reported in adult patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). WT1 mutations have been independently associated with treatment failure and poor prognosis in NK-AML. Internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) commonly co-occur with WT1-mutant AML, suggesting a cooperative role in leukemogenesis. The functional role of WT1 mutations in hematologic malignancies appears to be complex and is not yet fully elucidated. Here, we describe the hematologic phenotype of a knock-in mouse model of a Wt1 mutation (R394W), described in cases of human leukemia. We show that Wt1+/R394W mice develop MDS which becomes 100% penetrant in a transplant model, exhibit an aberrant expansion of myeloid progenitor cells, and demonstrate enhanced self-renewal of hematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro. We crossbred Wt1+/R394W mice with knock-in Flt3+/ITD mice, and show that mice with both mutations (Flt3+/ITD/Wt1+/R394W) develop a transplantable MDS/MPN, with more aggressive features compared to either single mutant mouse model.
Hedgehog (HH), WNT, NOTCH, and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathways are known to regulate the progression of cancer; however, their interaction in leukaemia cells is not fully clarified.
Myeloid and T-lymphoblastic leukaemia cell lines (NB4, THP-1, Jurkat, and DND-41) were transfected with small interfering RNAs targeting the glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1) and catenin beta-1 (CTNNB1) genes involved in the regulation of HH and WNT pathways, respectively, and we examined cell proliferation and gene expression.
The knockdown of GLI1 and CTNNB1 did not significantly affect proliferation of any cell line; however, it up-regulated the expression of NOTCH1, cleaved NOTCH1 fragment, and phosphorylated mTOR in NB4 cells, but not in the other cell lines.
Our data suggest that HH and WNT act upstream of NOTCH and mTOR pathways and negatively regulate them in myeloid NB4 cells. Further studies are required to determine the biological significance of this signalling crosstalk in leukaemia.
Inv(3q26) and t(3:3)(q21;q26) are specific to poor-prognosis myeloid malignancies, and result in marked overexpression of EVI1, a zinc-finger transcription factor and myeloid-specific oncoprotein. Despite extensive study, the mechanism by which EVI1 contributes to myeloid malignancy remains unclear. Here we describe a new mouse model that mimics the transcriptional effects of 3q26 rearrangement. We show that EVI1 overexpression causes global distortion of hematopoiesis, with suppression of erythropoiesis and lymphopoiesis, and marked premalignant expansion of myelopoiesis that eventually results in leukemic transformation. We show that myeloid skewing is dependent on DNA binding by EVI1, which upregulates Spi1, encoding master myeloid regulator PU.1. We show that EVI1 binds to the -14 kb upstream regulatory element (-14kbURE) at Spi1; knockdown of Spi1 dampens the myeloid skewing. Furthermore, deletion of the -14kbURE at Spi1 abrogates the effects of EVI1 on hematopoietic stem cells. These findings support a novel mechanism of leukemogenesis through EVI1 overexpression.
Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WDSTS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by facial gestalt, neurodevelopmental delay, skeletal anomalies and growth retardation, which is caused by variation of KMT2A gene. To date, only 2 Chinese WDSTS patients have been reported. Here, we report the phenotypes and KMT2A gene variations in 14 unrelated Chinese WDSTS patients and investigate the phenotypic differences between the Chinese and French cohorts.
Next generation sequencing was performed for each patient, and the variants in the KMT2A gene were validated by Sanger sequencing. The phenotypes of 16 Chinese WDSTS patients were summarized and compared to 33 French patients.
Genetic sequencing identified 13 deleterious de novo KMT2A variants in 14 patients, including 10 truncating, 2 missenses and 1 splicing variants. Of the 13 variants, 11 are novel and two have been reported previously. One of the patients is mosaic in the KMT2A gene. The variation spectra and phenotypic profiles of the Chinese WDSTS patients showed no difference with patients of other ethnicities; however, differ in the frequencies of several clinical features. We demonstrated that variations in the KMT2A gene can lead to both advanced and delayed bone age. We identified 6 novel phenotypes, which include microcephaly, deep palmar crease, external ear deformity, carpal epiphyseal growth retardation, dyslipidemia, and glossoptosis. In addition, patients harbored missense variants in the CXXC zinc finger domain of KMT2A showed more severe neurophenotypes.
Our study consists of the largest cohort of Chinese WDSTS patients that continues to expand the WDSTS phenotypic and variation spectrum. Our results support the notion that the CXXC zinc finger domain of KMT2A gene is a hotspot for missense variants associated with more severe neurophenotypes.
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive, incurable non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma with good initial response to therapy then subsequently relapse. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are considered to be an underlying cause of these inevitable drug resistance and tumor regrowth, but how CSCs are regulated is largely unknown. We demonstrate here for the first time the existence of CSC-like subpopulations that are modulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in MCL cell lines and patient-derived primary cells in an inverse correlation with bortezomib (BTZ) sensitivity. Using various known donors and inhibitors of cellular superoxide (O2-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl radical (OH), we unveil their distinct roles in the regulation of CSC-like subpopulations and thus MCL response to BTZ. O2- inhibits CSC-like cells and sensitizes BTZ-induced apoptosis, whereas H2O2 conversely enriches CSC-like cells and protects against apoptosis and OH has minimal effects. We further observed that an anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 and a transcription factor Zeb-1 are favorable targets of O2- and H2O2, respectively. Using small molecule inhibition, ectopic expression and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene manipulation, we verified the roles of Mcl-1 and Zeb-1 in CSC and apoptosis regulation by O2- and H2O2. Our findings provide a novel mechanistic insight into the significance of redox status of MCL cells in determining their drug response via CSC-like subpopulations, which are imperative to a better understanding of therapeutic resistance and relapse.
The role of p53 in renal fibrosis is still controversial, and its underlying mechanisms remain not clear. Here, we showed that the pharmacological inhibition and genetic deletion of p53 in proximal tubular cells can attenuate renal dysfunction, tubular epithelial disruption, and interstitial fibrosis in db/db and STZ-induced diabetic nephrology (DN) mice. In human renal proximal tubule (human kidney 2 [HK-2]) cells, inhibition of p53 by PIF reduced the high glucose (HG)-induced extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation and reversed the inhibitory effect of HG on mRNA expression levels of lncRNA zinc finger E-box binding homeobox1-antisense RNA 1 (ZEB1-AS1) and ZEB1. Interestingly, our results demonstrated that both lncRNA ZEB1-AS1 and ZEB1 exhibited an anti-fibrotic role, while ZEB1 is positively regulated by lncRNA ZEB1-AS1 during HG treatment. Mechanistically, lnc ZEB1-AS1 bound directly to H3K4 methyltransferase myeloid and lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) and promoted H3K4me3 histone modification on ZEB1 promoter, which was reduced by HG treatment. ChIP analysis indicated the binding of p53 to the promoter region of lnc ZEB1-AS1. Furthermore, the findings were verified by the kidney biopsy samples from patients with DN. Taken all together, our results suggest that p53 may be a therapeutic target for renal fibrosis in DN.
Chromosomal translocations represent frequent events in leukemia. In t(8;21)+ acute myeloid leukemia, RUNX1 is fused to nearly the entire ETO protein, which contains four conserved nervy homology regions, NHR1-4. Furthermore RUNX1/ETO interacts with ETO-homologous proteins via NHR2, thereby multiplying NHR domain contacts. As shown recently, RUNX1/ETO retains oncogenic activity upon either deletion of the NHR3 + 4 N-CoR/SMRT interaction domain or substitution of the NHR2 tetramer domain. Thus, we aimed to clarify the specificities of the NHR domains. A C-terminally NHR3 + 4 truncated RUNX1/ETO containing a heterologous, structurally highly related non-NHR2 tetramer interface translocated into the nucleus and bound to RUNX1 consensus motifs. However, it failed to interact with ETO-homologues, repress RUNX1 targets, and transform progenitors. Surprisingly, transforming capacity was fully restored by C-terminal fusion with ETO's NHR4 zinc-finger or the repressor domain 3 of N-CoR, while other repression domains failed. With an inducible protein assembly system, we further demonstrated that NHR4 domain activity is critically required early in the establishment of progenitor cultures expressing the NHR2 exchanged truncated RUNX1/ETO. Together, we can show that NHR2 and NHR4 domains can be replaced by heterologous protein domains conferring tetramerization and repressor functions, thus showing that the NHR2 and NHR4 domain structures do not have irreplaceable functions concerning RUNX1/ETO activity for the establishment of human CD34+ cell expansion. We could resemble the function of RUNX1/ETO through modular recomposition with protein domains from RUNX1, ETO, BCR and N-CoR without any NHR2 and NHR4 sequences. As most transcriptional repressor proteins do not comprise tetramerization domains, our results provide a possible explanation as to the reason that RUNX1 is recurrently found translocated to ETO family members, which all contain tetramer together with transcriptional repressor moieties.
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of malignant tumor that is caused by malignant clone hematopoietic stem cells. The ecotropic viral integration site 1 (Evi1) is a zinc finger transcription factor, which is highly expressed in AML, and its expression level has been associated with poor prognosis of AML. Previous studies have indicated that Evi1 may regulate cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis by inhibiting the membrane-spanning-4-domains subfamily-A member-3 (MS4A3) gene in AML. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of Evi1 in the progression of AML. The results revealed that Evi1 was overexpressed in leukemia cells compared with normal T lymphocytes. MicroRNAs (miR)-133 and -431 that target Evi1 were investigated, and it was observed that there was a low expression of miR-431 in AML. The transfection of miR-431 was able to decrease the promoter methylation levels of the Evi1 gene in AML cells. The transfection of miR-431 also suppressed the migration and invasion of AML cells. The present study revealed that the transfection of miR-431 mimic was able to downregulate MS4A3 expression in AML cells. Furthermore, the expression levels of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers fibronectin, α-smooth muscle actin, and vimentin were downregulated following the transfection of miR-431 in AML cells. The overexpression of MS4A3 was also able to suppress miR-431-mediated inhibition of the expression of TGFβ and EMT markers in AML cells. The addition of TGFβ inhibited the downregulation of EMT markers by transfection of miR-431 in AML cells. The transfection of miR-431 suppressed the migration and invasion of AML cells, which was also abolished by the addition of TGFβ. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicated that Evi1 may be a potential molecular target of leukemia therapy via MS4A3-mediated TGFβ/EMT signaling pathway.
Leukemia is different from solid tumor by harboring genetic rearrangements that predict prognosis and guide treatment strategy. PML-RARA, RUNX1-RUNX1T1, and KMT2A-rearrangement are common genetic rearrangements that drive the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). By contrast, rare genetic rearrangements may also contribute to leukemogenesis but are less summarized.
Here we reported rare fusion genes ZNF717-ZNF37A, ZNF273-DGKA, and ZDHHC2-TTTY15 in a 47-year-old AML-M4 patient with FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) discovered by whole genome sequencing (WGS) using the patient's healthy sibling as a sequencing control.
This is, to our knowledge, the first case of AML with fusion gene ZNF717-ZNF37A, ZNF273-DGKA, and ZDHHC2-TTTY15.
The bcr-abl fusion gene is the pathological origin of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and plays a critical role in the resistance of imatinib. Thus, bcr-abl disruption-based novel therapeutic strategy may warrant exploration. In our study, we were surprised to find that the characteristics of bcr-abl sequences met the design requirements of zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs).
We constructed the ZFNs targeting bcr-abl with high specificity through simple modular assembly approach. Western blotting was conducted to detect the expression of BCR-ABL and phosphorylation of its downstream STAT5, ERK and CRKL in CML cells. CCK8 assay, colony-forming assay and flow cytometry (FCM) were used to evaluate the effect of the ZFNs on the viablity and apoptosis of CML cells and CML CD34+ cells. Moreover, mice model was used to determine the ability of ZFNs in disrupting the leukemogenesis of bcr-abl in vivo.
The ZFNs skillfully mediated 8-base NotI enzyme cutting site addition in bcr-abl gene of imatinib sensitive and resistant CML cells by homology-directed repair (HDR), which led to a stop codon and terminated the translation of BCR-ABL protein. As expected, the disruption of bcr-abl gene induced cell apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation. Notably, we obtained similar result in CD34+ cells from CML patients. Moreover, the ZFNs significantly reduced the oncogenicity of CML cells in mice.
These results reveal that the bcr-abl gene disruption based on ZFNs may provide a treatment choice for imatinib resistant or intolerant CML patients.
To improve the treatment outcomes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), epigenetic modification has been widely tested and used in recent years. However, drug-resistance is still a choke point to cure the malignancy. The growth factor independent 1 transcriptional repressor (GFI-1), as a zinc-finger transcriptional repressor, can bind histone deacetylases to allow the transcriptional repression. According to the finding of our study, AML patients with low level of GFI-1 not only implicated poor prognosis but also caused Panobinostat-resistance. In our prevent study revealed that heme oxygenase-1(HO-1) was one of the main factors leading to chemotherapy sensitivity to AML. Thus, this study tried to test the correlation between GFI-1 and HO-1. Our study discovered that AML patients with lower expression of GFI-1 had higher level of HO-1, HDAC1, HDAC2 and HDAC3, which resulted in poor prognosis in AML. The results of the in vitro study were the same. Panobinostat is a promising new class of anti-cancer drugs in AML. However, knocking down GFI-1 by siRNA could eliminate the Panobinostat-induced cell apoptosis. Subsequently, we utilized ZnPP to down regulate the level of HO-1, finding that the Panobinostat-resistance between the low level of GFI-1 and empty vector had eased. After further exploring the mechanism, it could be found that with knock down GFI-1, the phosphorylation of Akt and PI3K could be activated. Subsequently, Akt pathway and HO-1 inhibitor were utilized respectively and the resistance was reversed. It suggested that the resistance of Panobinostat to AML cells at low level of GFI-1 was mainly due to up-regulated level of HO-1 through the PI3K-Akt pathway.
The mouse Aop2 (antioxidant protein 2) cDNA recently cloned from liver and kidney is a member of the thiol-specific antioxidant gene family. We have isolated the mouse gene encoding Aop2 and have shown that it comprises five exons and four introns. Analysis of the sequence upstream of the translation start site revealed several potential Sp1-binding sites and two putative transcription initiation sites. Primer extension studies were used to determine the 5' end of the Aop2 transcript. This upstream region also contains consensus recognition sequences for the transcription factors USF, SREBP, and ADR1, all of which have been shown to regulate genes involved in lipid metabolism, and multiple consensus binding sites for HSF, whose activity is modulated by oxidative stress. Since Aop2 has recently been proposed as a candidate gene for atherosclerosis susceptibility differences in mice, the presence of these binding sites may have biological significance. We also isolated two highly related intronless genes and determined their chromosomal locations. Further characterization of this highly conserved gene family and its regulation will help to elucidate their biological functions.
Type 2 diabetes is associated with increased fracture risk and the mechanisms underlying the detrimental effects of diabetes on skeletal health are only partially understood. Antidiabetic drugs are indispensable for glycemic control in most type 2 diabetics, however, they may, at least in part, modulate fracture risk in exposed patients. Preclinical and clinical data clearly demonstrate an unfavorable effect of thiazolidinediones on the skeleton with impaired osteoblast function and activated osteoclastogenesis. The negative effect of thiazolidinediones on osteoblastogenesis includes decreased activity of osteoblast-specific transcription factors (e.g. Runx2, Dlx5, osterix) and decreased activity of osteoblast-specific signaling pathways (e.g. Wnt, TGF-β/BMP, IGF-1). In contrast, metformin has a positive effect on osteoblast differentiation due to increased activity of Runx2 via the AMPK/USF-1/SHP regulatory cascade resulting in a neutral or potentially protective effect on bone. Recently marketed antidiabetic drugs include incretin-based therapies (GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPP-4 inhibitors) and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2)-inhibitors. Preclinical studies indicate that incretins (GIP, GLP-1, and GLP-2) play an important role in the regulation of bone turnover. Clinical safety data are limited, however, meta-analyses of trials investigating the glycemic-lowering effect of both, GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP4-inhibitors, suggest a neutral effect of incretin-based therapies on fracture risk. For SGLT2-inhibitors recent data indicate that due to their mode of action they may alter calcium and phosphate homeostasis (secondary hyperparathyroidism induced by increased phosphate reabsorption) and thereby potentially affect bone mass and fracture risk. Clinical studies are needed to elucidate the effect of SGLT2-inhibitors on bone metabolism. Meanwhile SGLT2-inhibitors should be used with caution in patients with high fracture risk, which is specifically true for the use of thiazolidinediones. 
The outer segment (OS) of rod photoreceptors consist of a highly modified primary cilium containing phototransduction machinery necessary for light detection. The delivery and organization of the phototransduction components within and along the cilium into the series of stacked, highly organized disks is critical for cell function and viability. How disks are formed within the cilium remains an area of active investigation. We have found nuclear distribution protein C (nudC), a key component of mitosis and cytokinesis during development, to be present in the inner segment region of these postmitotic cells in several species, including mouse, tree shrew, monkey, and frog. Further, we found nudC interacts with rhodopsin and the small GTPase rab11a. Here, we show through transgenic tadpole studies that nudC is integral to rod cell disk formation and photoreceptor protein localization. Finally, we demonstrate that short hairpin RNA knockdown of nudC in tadpole rod photoreceptors, which leads to the inability of rod cells to maintain their OS, is rescued through coexpression of murine nudC.-Boitet, E. R., Reish, N. J., Hubbard, M. G., Gross, A. K. NudC regulates photoreceptor disk morphogenesis and rhodopsin localization.
Isthmins represent a novel family of vertebrate secreted proteins containing one copy of the thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR), which in mammals is shared by several proteins with diverse biological functions, including cell adhesion, angiogenesis, and patterning of developing nervous system. We have determined the genomic organization of human TAIL1 (thrombospondin and AMOP containing isthmin-like 1), a novel isthmin-like gene encoding a protein that contains a TSR and a C-terminal AMOP domain (adhesion-associated domain in MUC4 and other proteins), characteristic of extracellular proteins involved in adhesion processes. TAIL1 gene encompasses more than 24.4 kb. Analysis of the DNA sequence surrounding the putative transcriptional start region revealed a TATA-less promoter located in a CpG island. Several consensus binding sites for the transcription factors Sp1 and MZF-1 were identified in this promoter region. In humans, TAIL1 gene is located on chromosome 14q24.3 within ARVD1 (arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy, type 1) critical region; preliminary evidence suggests that it is expressed in several tissues, showing multiple alternative splicing.
Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) promoter region may modulate TNF-alpha gene transcriptional activity by modifying the binding of transcription factors. Here we confirm that a specific DNA complex binds preferentially the variant TNF2 allele in various cell types and demonstrate that activating protein (AP)-2, myeloid zinc finger gene 1 (MZF-1) and Sp1 are not involved in this complex.
Cathepsin L is a lysosomal cysteine protease over-expressed in malignancy. It is very potent in degrading collagen, elastin, laminin and other components of the basement membrane and therefore, has been implicated in tumor invasion and metastasis. Two mRNA species, hCATL A and hCATL B, which contain an identical open reading frame and different 5'UTRs, were demonstrated to be encoded by the same gene located on chromosome 9q21-22. We have previously cloned and characterized the promoter responsible for the transcription of hCATL A (hCATL A promoter). However, it was not clear whether hCATL B is a splice variant of hCATL A or transcribed from a different promoter. In the present study, we demonstrate for the first time that hCATL B is transcribed from an alternate promoter (hCATL B promoter) located in the first intron of hCATL. This TATA-less promoter initiates transcription from two cytosine nucleotides present 191 and 367 bases upstream to the translation start codon. Deletion analysis revealed that the core promoter region lies upstream to these transcription initiation sites. This region contains several putative transcription factor-binding sites like AP-1, AP-4, GATA-1, Lmo2, NF-kappa B, MZF-1, NF-AT, etc. In U-87 MG cells, hCATL B promoter exhibits at least six times less activity than our previously characterized hCATL A promoter. However, this promoter is significantly more active in malignantly transformed cells as compared to its activity in untransformed cells. Thus, our results conclusively demonstrate that hCATL B mRNA is transcribed from an alternate promoter. Increased transcriptional activity from this promoter contributes to the elevated cathepsin L expression in transformed cells.
The human reduced folate carrier (hRFC) is the major uptake route for antifolates used in cancer chemotherapy. Here we explored the molecular basis for the decrease or loss of hRFC gene expression in seventeen tumor cell lines with resistance to multiple antifolates due to impaired antifolate transport. We studied the role of various cis-acting elements including CRE/AP-1-like element and GC-box in hRFC promoters A and B, respectively, as well as AP-2, Mzf-1 and E-box that are contained within or near four tandemly repeated sequences upstream of promoter A. Decreased or abolished binding either to [32P]GC-box, Mzf-1, AP-1, E-box, or CRE oligonucleotides was detected in approximately 50-80% of antifolate-resistant cell lines. Strikingly, approximately 80% of the cell lines displayed a simultaneously decreased binding to three or more of these hRFC promoter elements, whereas normal AP-2 binding was retained. The possible contribution of promoter methylation to hRFC gene silencing was also explored. None of the antifolate-resistant cell lines, except for MDA-MB-231 cells, showed hRFC promoter methylation; consistently, MDA-MB-231 was the only cell line that retained binding to all six cis-acting elements. Western blot analysis demonstrated decreased expression of transcriptional activators (pCREB-1, pATF-1, USF-1, c-Fos, c-Jun, Sp1, and Sp3) and/or increased expression of repressors (short Sp3 isoforms), whereas normal AP2alpha levels were retained. Transient expression of the relevant transcription factors restored, at least partially, both promoter binding and hRFC gene expression. This is the first report that transcriptional silencing of the hRFC gene in multiple tumor cell lines with resistance to various novel antifolates is a result of a simultaneous loss of function of multiple transcription factors but not promoter methylation.
The high affinity IgE receptor, FcepsilonRI, is a key regulatory molecule in the allergic reaction. By screening for cis-acting elements over the entire region of the human FcepsilonRI beta-chain gene, a sequence located in the fourth intron was revealed to serve as a repressor element. This element was recognized by a transcription factor, myeloid zinc finger protein 1 (MZF-1). Introduction of MZF-1 antisense inhibited the suppressive effect of the element on the beta-chain promoter and increased the mRNA for the beta-chain in KU812 cells, indicating that MZF-1 repressed human FcepsilonRI beta-chain gene expression via the element in the fourth intron. Furthermore, it was suggested that a cofactor binding with MZF-1, whose expression level was different among the cell types, was required for transcriptional repression by MZF-1.
Characterization of multiprotein complexes involved in actin remodeling and cytoskeleton reorganization is essential to understand the basic mechanisms of cell motility and migration. To identify proteins implicated in these processes, we have isolated the mouse Wave1/Scar gene, a member of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family. The mouse Wave1 gene was physically localized on chromosome 10 and spans over 12 Kb comprising eight exons and seven introns. The mouse Wave1 complementary DNA encodes a predicted 559 amino acid protein, with a SCAR homology domain, a basic domain, a proline-rich region, a WASP homology domain and an acidic domain conserved in the orthologous proteins. The Wave1 transcription initiation site was mapped 210 base pairs upstream of the ATG translational start site. The presumptive proximal promoter contains putative consensus binding sites for E2 basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, hepatocyte nuclear factor-3beta, S8 homeodomain protein, zinc finger transcription factor MZF-1, and an interferon-stimulated response element. Northern analysis demonstrated a strong expression of a unique approximately 2.6 Kb Wave1 transcript in brain tissue, and in situ hybridization showed restricted expression to Purkinje cells from the cerebellum and pyramidal cells from the hippocampus. Characterization and expression analyses of the murine Wave1 gene provide the basis toward functional studies in mouse models of the role of Wave1 in neuronal cytoskeleton organization.
Cathepsin L is a lysosomal cysteine protease, which is over-expressed and secreted by malignant cells. It is very potent in degrading collagen, elastin, laminin and other components of the basement membrane and, therefore, has been implicated in tumor invasion and metastasis. The structural portion of the human cathepsin L (hCATL) gene was cloned to elucidate its genomic organization (Chauhan et al., J. Biol. Chem. 218 (1993) 1039). In the present study, a 1.90 kb DNA fragment, containing 1825 bp of the 5' upstream region of hCATL and 75 bases of the first exon of the hCATL, was amplified by PCR from an adaptor ligated placental genomic library. This fragment has been demonstrated to exhibit promoter activity by luciferase reporter assays. Sequence analysis of this fragment revealed the presence of approximately 29 different putative transcription factor binding sites. Several of them like AP-4, GATA-1, Lmo2, CEBPB, MZF-1, NF-AT, etc. were present more than once in this region. However, a consensus CAAT box but no consensus TATA box was found within the 1.0 kb upstream of exon 1. The transcription initiation site of hCATL, using placental total RNA, was mapped to a single adenine residue 289 bases upstream of the ATG codon.
Through differential screening of mouse hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) and progenitor subtracted cDNA libraries we have identified a HSC-specific transcript that represents a novel RING finger gene, named FLRF (fetal liver ring finger). FLRF represent a novel evolutionarily highly conserved RING finger gene, present in Drosophila, zebrafish, Xenopus, mouse, and humans. Full-length cDNA clones for mouse and human gene encode an identical protein of 317 amino acids with a C3HC4 RING finger domain at the amino terminus. During embryonic hematopoiesis FLRF is abundantly transcribed in mouse fetal liver HSC (Sca-1+c-kit+AA4.1+Lin- cells), but is not expressed in progenitors (AA4.1-). In adult mice FLRF is not transcribed in a highly enriched population of bone marrow HSC (Rh-123lowSca-1+c-kit+Lin- cells). Its expression is upregulated in a more heterogeneous population of bone marrow HSC (Lin-Sca-1+ cells), downregulated as they differentiate into progenitors (Lin-Sca-1- cells), and upregulated as progenitors differentiate into mature lymphoid and myeloid cell types. The human FLRF gene that spans a region of at least 12 kb and consists of eight exons was localized to chromosome 12q13, a region with frequent chromosome aberrations associated with multiple cases of acute myeloid leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The analysis of the genomic sequence upstream of the first exon in the mouse and human FLRF gene has revealed that both putative promoters contain multiple putative binding sites for several hematopoietic (GATA-1, GATA-2, GATA-3, Ikaros, SCL/Tal-1, AML1, MZF-1, and Lmo2) and other transcription factors, suggesting that mouse and human FLRF expression could be regulated in a developmental and cell-specific manner during hematopoiesis. Evolutionary conservation and differential expression in fetal and adult HSC and progenitors suggest that the FLRF gene could play an important role in HSC/progenitor cell lineage commitment and differentiation and could be involved in the etiology of hematological malignancies.
Transcriptional regulation for the genes encoding alpha- and beta-chains of the high-affinity receptor for IgE (FcepsilonRI) have been analyzed in mast cells and regulatory mechanisms are beginning to be elucidated. Transcription factors GATA-1 and PU.1 cooperatively transactivate the alpha-chain gene, and three transcription factors, GATA-1, Oct-1, and MZF-1, are involved in regulation of beta-chain gene expression. No single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are functionally related to the allergic diseases have been identified in coding regions of the alpha- and beta-chain genes in a definitive way. However, recent studies on SNPs in the promoter regions have revealed that these genes are probable candidates for new types of allergy-related genes whose transcription levels are affected by transcription factors which discriminate SNPs in the promoters. Another interesting finding on transcription factors functioning in mast cells is that the expression level of PU.1 determines cell fate between mast cells and monocytes.
Latent TGF-beta binding proteins (LTBPs) are extracellular matrix glycoproteins, which are essential for the targeting and activation of TGF-betas. LTBP-3 regulates the bioavailability of TGF-beta especially in the bone. To understand the regulation of LTBP-3 expression, we have isolated and characterized the promoter region of human LTBP-3 gene. The GC-rich TATA-less promoter contained several transcription initiation sites and putative binding sites for multiple sequence specific transcription factors including Sp1, AP-1, c-Ets, MZF-1, Runx1 and members of the GATA-family. Reporter gene analyses of the promoter indicated that it was more active in MG-63 than in Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells, suggesting that it is regulated as the endogenous gene. TGF-beta1 stimulated the transcriptional activity of LTBP-3 promoter in MG-63 cells, while certain other bone-derived growth factors and hormones were ineffective. TGF-beta1 increased LTBP-3 mRNA levels accordingly. Analyses of deletion constructs of the promoter and mutational deletion of specific transcription factor binding sites indicated that Smad3/4 and AP-1 binding sites mediated the TGF-beta1 response. The involvement of AP-1 activity was further indicated by decreased TGF-beta responsiveness of the LTBP-3 promoter in the presence of a MEK/Erk signaling pathway inhibitor. Our results suggest an important new role for TGF-beta1 in the regulation of its binding protein, LTBP-3.
The function of the prion protein gene (PRNP) and its normal product PrP(C) is elusive. We used comparative genomics as a strategy to understand the normal function of PRNP. As the reliability of comparisons increases with the number of species and increased evolutionary distance, we isolated and sequenced a 66.5 kb BAC containing the PRNP gene from a distantly related mammal, the model Australian marsupial Macropus eugenii (tammar wallaby). Marsupials are separated from eutherians such as human and mouse by roughly 180 million years of independent evolution. We found that tammar PRNP, like human PRNP, has two exons. Prion proteins encoded by the tammar wallaby and a distantly related marsupial, Monodelphis domestica (Brazilian opossum) PRNP contain proximal PrP repeats with a distinct, marsupial-specific composition and a variable number. Comparisons of tammar wallaby PRNP with PRNPs from human, mouse, bovine and ovine allowed us to identify non-coding gene regions conserved across the marsupial-eutherian evolutionary distance, which are candidates for regulatory regions. In the PRNP 3' UTR we found a conserved signal for nuclear-specific polyadenylation and the putative cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE), indicating that post-transcriptional control of PRNP mRNA activity is important. Phylogenetic footprinting revealed conserved potential binding sites for the MZF-1 transcription factor in both upstream promoter and intron/intron 1, and for the MEF2, MyT1, Oct-1 and NFAT transcription factors in the intron(s). The presence of a conserved NFAT-binding site and CPE indicates involvement of PrP(C) in signal transduction and synaptic plasticity.
LDOC1 was isolated as a gene encoding a leucine-zipper protein whose expression was decreased in pancreatic and gastric cancer cell lines in 1999. Here, we found that overexpression of LDOC1 caused externalization of the cell membrane phosphatidylserine, which was characteristic for early-phase apoptotic events, and reduced cell viability in some human cell lines. The apoptotic process was triggered by a loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential, leading to both caspase-3-dependent and -independent pathways. Furthermore, a transcription factor, MZF-1, was revealed to interact with LDOC1 and enhance the activity of LDOC1 for inducing apoptosis.
The high-affinity IgE receptor FcepsilonRI plays a key role in triggering allergic reactions. We recently reported that human FcepsilonRI beta-chain gene expression was down-regulated by a transcription factor, MZF-1, through an element in the fourth intron. In the present study, we found that this transcriptional repression by MZF-1 required FHL3 (four and a half LIM domain protein 3) as a cofactor. Yeast two-hybrid and immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that FHL3 bound MZF-1 in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of FHL3 in KU812 cells suppressed the beta-chain promoter activity through the element in the fourth intron in an MZF-1-dependent manner. Furthermore, results from pull-down assays and gel-filtration chromatography employing nuclear extracts indicated that MZF-1 and FHL3 formed a complex of high molecular mass with some additional proteins in the nucleus. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, which was reported to decrease FcepsilonRI expression, induced the accumulation of FHL3 in the nucleus, in accordance with the repressive role of FHL3 in beta-chain gene expression.
The coordinated production of all blood cells from a common stem cell is a highly regulated process involving successive stages of commitment and differentiation. From analyses of mice deficient in transcription factor genes and from the characterizations of chromosome breakpoints in human leukemias, it has become evident that transcription factors are important regulators of hematopoiesis. During myelopoiesis, which includes the development of granulocytic and monocytic lineages, transcription factors from several families are active, including AML1/CBF beta, C/EBP, Ets, c-Myb, HOX, and MZF-1. Few of these factors are expressed exclusively in myeloid cells; instead it appears that they cooperatively regulate transcription of myeloid-specific genes. Here we discuss recent advances in transcriptional regulation during myelopoiesis.
The myeloid zinc finger protein MZF-1 is important in hematopoiesis. Previous studies have found that reducing expression of MZF-1 inhibited G-CSF-driven human marrow colony formation assays. In this study we found that retrovirally overexpressing MZF-1 in IL-3-dependent FDCP.1 cells inhibited their apoptosis when IL-3 was withdrawn. The MZF-1-transduced FDCP.1 cells also formed tumors when injected into congenic mice, whereas control FDCP.1 cells did not.
A zinc-finger gene encoding a transcription factor that regulates hematopoiesis, MZF-1, is located at the extreme end of the q arm of human chromosome 19. Several lines of evidence indicate that MZF-1 lies less than 20 kb from the subtelomeric repeat region of 19q. Telomeres are known to degenerate as cells age; disruption of MZF-1 due to telomeric degeneration may play a role in the increased incidence of leukemia in the elderly.
Transcriptional regulators control much of hematopoiesis. One such transcriptional regulator is the myeloid zinc finger gene MZF-1. MZF-1 has been localized to the telomere of chromosome 19q, where a large number of related zinc finger genes reside. It has been found to be essential in granulopoiesis. It is a bi-functional transcriptional regulator, repressing transcription in non-hematopoietic cells, and activating transcription in cells of hematopoietic origins. Its consensus DNA binding site has been isolated, and sites in several promoters of myeloid-specific genes, such as CD34, lactoferrin, and myeloperoxidase, have been defined. In co-transfection experiments MZF-1 has been found to regulate transcription from the CD34 promoter.
The expression of the human myeloid zinc finger gene (MZF-1) by human bone marrow cells is necessary for granulopoiesis. We have analyzed the structure and function of the MZF-1 gene by diagnostic polymerase chain reaction, genomic cloning, and promoter analysis. Comparison of human promyelocytic HL-60 cell cDNA with isolated MZF-1 genomic clones indicated that the human MZF-1 gene is without introns and spans approximately 3 kb. Restriction enzyme mapping and Southern analysis indicated further that the human MZF-1 gene is a single-copy gene. Primer extension studies identified the major transcription start site as a thymidine residue located 1102 bp upstream of the ATG translation start codon. A putative TATA box sequence (TAAAAA) was found at -66 bp and a CCAAT box at -130 bp relative to the transcription initiation site. In HL-60 cells, MZF-1 mRNA levels are increased by granulopoietic inducers including retinoic acid and GM-CSF. DNA upstream of the transcription start site contains tandem-repeated consensus retinoic acid response elements at -666 through -696 bp and paired putative GM-CSF-responsive sequences centered at -50 and -100 bp. CAT reporter gene constructs containing these DNA regions promoted transcription and conferred transcriptional responsiveness to retinoic acid and GM-CSF when transfected into HL-60 cells. Additional putative regulatory binding sites included conserved MZF-1 zinc finger binding sequences, the importance of which was suggested by the enhanced expression of the endogenous MZF-1 gene following vector-driven expression of MZF-1 constructs in K562 myeloblastic leukemia cells. These findings provide a clearer basis for understanding the role of MZF-1 gene expression in myeloid cell growth and differentiation.
MZF-1 is a C2H2 zinc finger gene encoding a putative transcriptional regulator of myeloid differentiation. The MZF-1 protein contains 13 C2H2 zinc fingers arranged in bipartite DNA binding domains containing zinc fingers through 4 and, in the carboxy-terminus, 5 through 13. We previously identified the DNA consensus binding site recognized by the two DNA binding domains. To assess the transcription regulatory function of MZF-1, the full-length MZF-1 coding region was fused to the DNA binding domain of the yeast transactivator GAL4. The expression vector was cotransfected with the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter gene regulated by the thymidine kinase promoter containing GAL4 DNA binding sites into NIH 3T3, 293, K562, and Jurkat cell lines. MZF-1 represses CAT reporter gene expression via GAL4 binding sites in the nonhematopoietic cell lines NIH 3T3 and 293. In contrast, MZF-1 activates CAT reporter gene expression in the hematopoietic cell lines K562 and Jurkat. The MZF-1 binding sites are present in the promoters of several genes expressed during myeloid differentiation, including the CD34 promoter. MZF-1 transcriptional regulation of this physiologically relevant promoter was assessed in both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cell lines. Recombinant MZF-1 protein specifically binds to the consensus binding sites in the CD34 promoter in mobility shift assays. MZF-1 expression vectors were cotransfected with the luciferase reporter plasmids regulated by the CD34 promoter into both nonhematopoietic and hematopoietic cell lines. As with the heterologous DNA binding domain, MZF-1 represses reporter gene expression in nonhematopoietic cell lines and activates expression in hematopoietic cell lines. Activation of CD34 expression in hematopoietic cell lines is dependent on the presence of intact MZF-1 binding sites. The cell type-specific regulation of the CD34 promoter by MZF-1 suggests the presence of tissue-specific regulators/adapters or differential MZF-1 modifications that determine MZF-1 transcriptional regulatory function.
The zinc finger gene MZF-1 is preferentially expressed in primitive hematopoietic cells and plays an important role in regulating myelopoiesis. Regulators of development are potential targets for neoplastic transformation. This study investigated whether unregulated expression of MZF-1 could function as an oncogene. Retroviral transduction and subsequent overexpression of MZF-1 resulted in loss of contact inhibition, loss of substrate dependence, and more rapid cell cycling in NIH 3T3 cells. The MZF-1-transformed 3T3 cells formed aggressive tumors in athymic mice. Disruption of the tight lineage- and stage-specific regulation of MZF-1 can result in neoplastic transformation of embryonic fibroblasts. Therefore, MZF-1 represents a novel oncogene.
Zinc finger proteins are transcriptional regulators of other genes, often controlling developmental cascades of gene expression. A recently cloned zinc finger gene, MZF-1, was found to be preferentially expressed in myeloid cells. Using complementary radiolabeled MZF-1 RNA hybridized to human bone marrow smears in situ, it was discovered that the expression of MZF-1 is essentially limited to the myelocyte and metamyelocyte stages of granulopoiesis. Antisense but not sense oligonucleotides from MZF-1 significantly inhibited granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-driven granulocyte colony formation in vitro.
Zinc finger genes encode metal-binding proteins that can act as transcriptional regulators of other genes. In an effort to identify activators of the genetic cascade in hemopoietic differentiation, we used degenerate synthetic oligonucleotides to the conserved zinc finger histidine-cysteine link to probe a human myeloid lambda gt11 cDNA library. One of the cDNA clones obtained hybridized preferentially to mRNA from myeloid cells. This cDNA was used to isolate clones encompassing the coding region for this gene. Sequence analysis found 13 zinc finger regions and a glycine-proline-rich region between the fourth and fifth zinc finger domain. The gene was localized to chromosome 19q13.2-4, a chromosome that has a large cluster of zinc finger genes. The gene was preferentially expressed in myeloid leukemia cell lines with the highest mRNA levels noted in HL-60 cells induced to differentiate with retinoic acid. Thus, this new zinc finger gene (designated MZF-1) may be one regulator of transcriptional events during hemopoietic development.
Recently much progress has been made in our understanding of how myeloid progenitor cells undergo commitment and become mature granulocytes or monocytes/macrophages. Studies of normal and leukemic myeloid cells as well as those of cells derived from mice with targeted disruption showed that a series of transcription factors play a major role in both commitment and maturation of myeloid cells. This is primarily because these transcription factors direct an ordered pattern of gene expression according to a well-defined developmental program. PU.1, an Ets family member, is one of the master transcription factors identified to regulate development of both granulocytes and monocytes/macrophages. Further, C/EBPalpha and C/EBPvarepsilon of the bZip family have important roles in directing granulocytic maturation. A number of additional transcription factors such as AML1, RARalpha, MZF-1, Hox and STAT families of transcription factors, Egr-1 and c-myb etc are shown to play roles in myeloid cell differentiation. Our laboratory has recently obtained evidence that ICSBP, a member of the IRF family, is involved in lineage commitment during myeloid cell differentiation and stimulates maturation of functional macrophages. Future elucidation of pathways and networks through which these transcription factors act in various stages of development would provide a more definitive picture of myeloid cell commitment and maturation.
We previously isolated the human LIMK2 gene and identified two alternative transcripts, LIMK2a and LIMK2b, which were differentially regulated in a tissue-specific manner. To examine this differential tissue-specific expression in detail, an RNase protection assay was performed, which demonstrated three expression patterns of the LIMK2 isoforms. In digestive organs, the LIMK2a transcripts were preferentially expressed in fetal and adult tissues; in brain and lung, the LIMK2a transcript was predominantly expressed only in fetal tissue, and in placenta, the LIMK2b transcript was expressed more abundantly than that of LIMK2a. To further investigate this mechanism and the transcription factors involved, we isolated the two distinct 5' upstream regions from the phage genomic library and found that both LIMK2a and 2b promoters have a single major transcription initiation site and the characteristics of a TATA-less promoter. A luciferase reporter assay of the transcriptional activity revealed positive as well as negative regulatory regions within both promoters. The co-transfection assay suggested that the MZF-1 might regulate the expression of the LIMK2 isoforms in a different manner. The RORalpha1 might also be involved in the transcriptional regulation of the LIMK2b isoform. The genomic structure of the LIMK2 gene was also determined. These findings should lead to a better understanding of the possibly diverse functions of the LIMK family.
To study the mechanism of gene regulation for coagulation factor XIII A subunit (FXIIIA), we characterized its 5'-flanking region using a monocytoid (U937), a megakaryocytoid (MEG-01), and other cells. Our results confirmed that U937 and MEG-01 contained FXIIIA mRNA. A tentative transcription start site was determined to be 76 bases upstream from the first exon/intron boundary. Reporter gene assays revealed that a 5'-fragment (-2331 to +75) was sufficient to support basal expression in U937 and MEG-01 but not in the other cells. Deletion analysis confined a minimal promoter sequence from -114 to +75. DNase footprinting, electrophoretic mobility shift, and reporter gene assays demonstrated that promoter elements for a myeloid-enriched transcription factor (MZF-1-like protein) and two ubiquitous transcription factors (NF-1 and SP-1) in this region were important for the basal FXIII expression. It was also revealed that an upstream region (-806 to -290) had enhancer activity in MEG-01 but silencer activity in U937. DNA sequences for binding of myeloid-enriched factors (GATA-1 and Ets-1) were recognized in this region, and the GATA-1 element was found to be responsible for the enhancer activity. These transcription factors play a major role in the cell type-specific expression of FXIIIA, which differs from other transglutaminases.
Three groups of pepsinogens exist in vertebrates, namely, pepsinogen A, pepsinogen C, and prochymosin, which are produced at different developmental stages. In the chicken, prochymosin is expressed only in the embryonic stage, while pepsinogens A and C are secreted from adult chicken proventricular (glandular stomach) mucosa. In order to understand the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of these genes, we have cloned the genes encoding chicken pepsinogens A and C and analyzed the sequences possibly involved in their regulation. 5'-Upstream sequences of both genes contain putative binding motifs for transcription factors such as GATA, Sox, and HNF-3 beta, which are expressed in the chicken gut epithelium. Moreover, we found seven putative binding motifs for human MZF-1 in intron 8 of pepsinogen A gene. These transcription factors may act as regulators of expression of chicken pepsinogen genes.
A new human leukemia cell line with an eosinophilic phenotype, designated YJ, was established from the peripheral blood cells of a patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL) with eosinophilia. When cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, most YJ cells were myeloblastoid with a small number of the cells having eosinophilic granules. Cell surface markers in the YJ cells were positive for CD33 and were negative for CD34, CD16 and CD23. The eosinophilic characteristics of YJ cells were confirmed by histochemical staining with Fast-Green/Neutral-Red and by the expression of mRNAs for eosinophil-associated granule proteins, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), eosinophil peroxidase (EPO), and major basic protein (MBP), and for the Charcot-Leyden crystal (CLC) protein. The YJ cells could be induced towards monocytic differentiation by stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). The monocytic characteristics of YJ cells treated with PMA were confirmed by morphological analysis with alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase staining, by CD14 expression, and by increased expression of Egr-1 mRNA. Furthermore, YJ cells could be differentiated towards the neutrophil lineage by stimulation with all-trans retinoic acid (RA). YJ cells treated in vitro with 2 microM RA differentiated into metamyelocytes and band neutrophils, and increased the number of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT)-positive cells and increased gp91phox mRNA expression. Thus, the YJ cell line exhibited eosinophilic characteristics, but was able to differentiate to the monocytic or neutrophilic lineages in response to PMA or RA, respectively. The expression of genes for transcription factors involved in myeloid differentiation was evaluated by Northern blot analysis. Increased expression of Egr-1 was observed with macrophage differentiation. In contrast, increased expressions of C/EBPbeta and MZF-1 mRNA occurred with neutrophilic differentiation. The YJ cell line should be useful for elucidating the molecular mechanisms governing lineage switching from the eosinophil to monocytic or neutrophil lineages.
The myeloid zinc finger gene, MZF-1, is a hematopoietic transcription factor expressed in developing myeloid cells. To characterize further the role of MZF-1 in myelopoiesis, we used retroviral gene transduction to overexpress MZF-1 in HL-60 cells to produce HL-60-MZF-1 cells. HL-60 cells respond to retinoic acid (RA) with growth inhibition, granulocytic differentiation and apoptosis. However, HL-60-MZF-1 cells exposed to RA continue to proliferate in response to RA as evidenced by a higher percentage of cells in S phase, higher peak cell counts, and later peak cell counts. Morphologic differentiation of the RA-induced HL-60-MZF-1 cells is delayed with half as many of the HL-60-MZF-1 cells compared to the wild-type HL-60 cells that are differentiated after 3 days of RA, although both cells types responded with 80-95% mature granulocytes after 6 days of RA. Apoptosis was delayed in the MZF-1 transduced cells as measured by internucleosomal DNA fragmentation patterns, the terminal transferase end labeling reaction (TUNEL), and quantitation of fragmented DNA by the diphenylamine reaction. Several markers of differentiation were identical in both HL-60 and HL-60-MZF-1 cells including CD11b, CD33, CD34, CD13, CD16 and CD14. However, following 6 days of RA, only half as many HL-60-MZF-1 cells expressed CD18 compared to the wild-type HL-60 cells. Expression of the bcl-2 proto-oncogene transcript and protein was higher in the HL-60-MZF-1 cells compared to wild-type HL-60s and expression persisted for 5 days following RA in the HL-60-MZF-1 cells compared to only 3 days in the parental HL-60 cells suggesting that bcl-2 may contribute to the inhibition of apoptosis. Overexpression of MZF-1 had no effect on PMA-induced monocyte/macrophage differentiation of HL-60 cells. Together these findings indicate that MZF-1 can stimulate cell proliferation and delay RA-induced differentiation and apoptosis in HL-60 cells. MZF-1 may function in a similar role in myelopoiesis allowing myeloid precursors to expand their numbers before going on to terminally differentiate.
Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) omega-hydroxylase catalyzes the conversion of LTB4 into a biologically less active product, 20-hydroxy-LTB4. In a preceding paper (Kikuta et al., 1993), we showed human polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) LTB4 omega-hydroxylase to be a novel form of cytochrome P450, designated CYP4F3, on the basis of its cDNA cloning and expression in yeast cells. Here, we have isolated the gene encoding CYP4F3 and determined its genomic organization and chromosomal localization. The CYP4F3 gene contained 13 exons and spanned approximately 22.2 kb. The cDNA of CYP4F3 contained 5050 nucleotides excluding the poly(A) tail. The translation initiation codon (ATG) was present in exon II. Primer extension and S1 mapping analyses indicated that the transcription initiation site is 49 nucleotides upstream from the 3' end of exon I, and no other initiation sites were detected. A TATA-box-like sequence (TACAT) and 120-b GC-rich sequence were observed just before transcription initiation site. Several putative regulating elements recognized by the GATA family, MZF-1, CACCC binding protein, and C/EBP, were identified in its 5' flanking region. Genomic DNA screening for CYP4F3 and Southern blot analysis suggested the existence of other CYP4F genes in addition to CYP4F3 and CYP4F2 in the human genome. Fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated that the CYP4F3 gene is located at 19p13.2.
Myeloid cell development is controlled by tissue-specific transcription factors. Human myeloid zinc finger protein (MZF-1) is a putative transcription factor containing 13 zinc fingers, and has been suggested that it regulates the development of neutrophilic granulocytes.
Here, we have isolated the murine and human cDNAs which encode a novel form of MZF protein (MZF-2). Murine and human MZF-2 proteins consisted of 814 and 775 amino acids, respectively, and have identity of 75.3% between them. The C-terminal half of human MZF-2, carrying the zinc finger domains, was completely identical with that of human MZF-1, whereas the N-terminal half of MZF-2 was different from the corresponding region of human MZF-1, and was coded by distinct exons. MZF-2 mRNA was expressed in myeloid cells, particularly in the cells committed to the neutrophilic lineage, and down-regulated by G-CSF.
MZF-1 and MZF-2 mRNAs seem to be produced by the alternative use of two different transcription initiation sites. The distinct N-terminal half of MZF-2 carries two characteristic domains, a leucine-rich domain called LeR and an acidic domain, which suggests a unique function of MZF-2 in neutrophil development.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) establishes chronic infection, which often causes hepatocellular carcinoma. Overexpression of 3β-hydroxysterol Δ24-reductase (DHCR24) by HCV has been shown to impair the p53-mediated cellular response, resulting in tumorigenesis. In the present study, the molecular mechanism by which HCV promotes the expression of DHCR24 was investigated. A significant increase in DHCR24 mRNA transcription was observed in a cell line expressing complete HCV genome, whereas no significant difference in the expression of DHCR24 was seen in cell lines expressing individual viral proteins. The 5'-flanking genomic region of DHCR24 was characterized to explore the genomic region and host factor(s) involved in the transcriptional regulation of DHCR24. As a result, the HCV response element (-167/-140) was identified, which contains AP-2α, MZF-1, and Sp1 binding motifs. The binding affinity of the host factor to this response element was increased in nuclear extracts from cells infected with HCV and corresponded with augmented affinity of Sp1. Both mithramycin A (Sp1 inhibitor) and small interfering RNA targeting Sp1 prevented the binding of host factors to the response element. Silencing of Sp1 also downregulated the increased expression of DHCR24. The binding affinity of Sp1 to the response element was augmented by oxidative stress, whereas upregulation of DHCR24 in cells expressing HCV was blocked significantly by a reactive oxygen species scavenger. Elevated phosphorylation of Sp1 in response to oxidative stress was mediated by the ATM kinase. Thus, activation of Sp1 by oxidative stress is involved in the promotion of expression of DHCR24 by HCV.
Heparin-binding epidermal-growth-factor-like growth factor (HBEGF) plays an important role in placentation, including impaired placentation, the primary defect seen in pre-eclampsia. We carried out a case-control disease-association study to examine the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the HBEGF gene and haplotypes defined by them with pre-eclampsia in a Sinhalese population in Sri Lanka.
A total of 175 women with pre-eclampsia and 171 matched normotensive controls were genotyped for six SNP selected in silico as having putative functional effects using mass array Sequenom iplex methodology and a newly designed polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay.
The individual SNP were not associated with pre-eclampsia. The haplotypes defined by them, however, showed both predisposing (rs13385T,rs2074613G,rs2237076G,rs2074611C,rs4150196A,rs1862176A; odds ratio,1.65; 95% confidence interval1.04-2.60; P=0.032) and protective (rs13385C,rs2074613G,rs2237076A,rs2074611C,rs4150196A,rs1862176A; odds ratio,0.20; 95% confidence interval, 0.04-0.89; P=0.034) effects.
These results confirm that polymorphisms in the HGEGF gene are associated with pre-eclampsia. The haplotypes are likely to exert their effects through the numerous transcription regulation factors binding to the polymorphic sites, namely GATA-1, GATA-3, MZF-1 and AML-1a.
Multidrug and toxin extrusion 2 (MATE2-K (SLC47A2)), a polyspecific organic cation exporter, facilitates the renal elimination of the antidiabetes drug metformin. In this study, we characterized genetic variants of MATE2-K, determined their association with metformin response, and elucidated their impact by means of a comparative protein structure model. Four nonsynonymous variants and four variants in the MATE2-K basal promoter region were identified from ethnically diverse populations. Two nonsynonymous variants-c.485C&gt;T and c.1177G&gt;A-were shown to be associated with significantly lower metformin uptake and reduction in protein expression levels. MATE2-K basal promoter haplotypes containing the most common variant, g.-130G&gt;A (&gt;26% allele frequency), were associated with a significant increase in luciferase activities and reduced binding to the transcriptional repressor myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF-1). Patients with diabetes who were homozygous for g.-130A had a significantly poorer response to metformin treatment, assessed as relative change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (-0.027 (-0.076, 0.033)), as compared with carriers of the reference allele, g.-130G (-0.15 (-0.17, -0.13)) (P=0.002). Our study showed that MATE2-K plays a role in the antidiabetes response to metformin.
Axl is a receptor tyrosine kinase promoting anti-apoptosis, invasion and mitogenesis, and is highly expressed in different solid cancers. Axl basal transcriptional activity is driven by Sp1/Sp3, and overexpression of MZF-1 (myeloid zinc-finger 1) induces Axl transcription and gene expression. Furthermore, Axl expression is epigenetically controlled by CpG hypermethylation; however, little is known about inducible Axl gene expression and Axl regulation in haematopoetic malignancies.
In the present study, we studied Axl transcriptional regulation under PMA-stimulated conditions in leukaemia cells. Luciferase analysis with sequential 5'-deletion constructs revealed that the -660/-580 region of the Axl promoter is indispensable for induced promoter activity under PMA stimulation. This region includes AP-1 (activator protein 1)/CREB [CRE (cAMP-response-element)-binding protein] motifs, five times partially overlapping TGCGTG repeats and multiple GT repeats. Mutational, supershift and ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) analysis determined that AP-1 family members bind to AP-1 motifs and to the 5 × TGCGTG overlapping repeats, thus transactivating Axl promoter activity. Furthermore, specific inhibitors of PKC (protein kinase C), ERK1/2 (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2) and p38 reduced Axl expression. Additionally, mithramycin treatment abolished constitutive and PMA-induced Axl expression.
Taken together the results of the present study suggest that PMA-induced Axl gene expression in leukaemia cells is mediated by AP-1 motifs and 5 × TGCGTG repeats within the promoter region -660/-580, and through the PKC/ERK1/2/AP-1 or PKC/p-38/AP-1 signalling axis.
Cellular uptake of cobalamin (Cbl) is mediated by the transcobalamin receptor (TCblR) that binds and internalizes transcobalamin (TC) saturated with Cbl. These receptors are expressed in actively proliferating cells and are down-regulated in quiescent cells. The 5' region of TCblR gene was analyzed for promoter activity to determine transcriptional regulation of TCblR expression. The region -668 to -455 appears to regulate TCblR expression. We have identified transcription factors MZF-1 (myeloid zinc finger 1)/RREB-1 (Ras-responsive element binding protein 1), C/EBP (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein)/HNF-3beta (hepatocyte nuclear factor 3) and AP-1(activator protein 1) as proteins likely to be involved in this regulation with the former region primarily involved in up regulation and the latter two regions involved in suppression of TCblR expression. These transcription factors are involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. Thus the cell cycle associated expression of TCblR appears to be tightly regulated in synchrony with the proliferative phase of the cell cycle.
Dominant mutations in coding regions of the surfactant protein-C gene, SFTPC, cause respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in infants. However, the contribution of variants in noncoding regions of SFTPC to pulmonary phenotypes is unknown. By using a case-control group of infants &gt; or =34 weeks gestation (n = 538), we used complete resequencing of SFTPC and its promoter, genotyping, and logistic regression to identify 80 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Three promoter SNPs were statistically associated with neonatal RDS among European descent infants. To assess the transcriptional effects of these three promoter SNPs, we selectively mutated the SFTPC promoter and performed transient transfection using MLE-15 cells and a firefly luciferase reporter vector. Each promoter SNP decreased SFTPC transcription. The combination of two variants in high linkage dysequilibrium also decreased SFTPC transcription. In silico evaluation of transcription factor binding demonstrated that the rare allele at g.-1167 disrupts a SOX (SRY-related high mobility group box) consensus motif and introduces a GATA-1 site, at g.-2385 removes a MZF-1 (myeloid zinc finger) binding site, and at g.-1647 removes a potential methylation site. This combined statistical, in vitro, and in silico approach suggests that reduced SFTPC transcription contributes to the genetic risk for neonatal RDS in developmentally susceptible infants.
The Ribosomal protein S19 gene locus (RPS19) has been linked to two kinds of red cell aplasia, Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (DBA) and Transient Erythroblastopenia in Childhood (TEC). Mutations in RPS19 coding sequences have been found in 25% of DBA patients, but not in TEC patients. It has been suggested that non-coding RPS19 sequence variants contribute to the considerable clinical variability in red cell aplasia. We therefore aimed at identifying non-coding variations associated with DBA or TEC phenotypes.
We targeted a region of 19'980 bp encompassing the RPS19 gene in a cohort of 89 DBA and TEC patients for resequencing. We provide here a catalog of the considerable, previously unrecognized degree of variation in this region. We identified 73 variations (65 SNPs, 8 indels) that all are located outside of the RPS19 open reading frame, and of which 67.1% are classified as novel. We hypothesize that specific alleles in non-coding regions of RPS19 could alter the binding of regulatory proteins or transcription factors. Therefore, we carried out an extensive analysis to identify transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). A series of putative interaction sites coincide with detected variants. Sixteen of the corresponding transcription factors are of particular interest, as they are housekeeping genes or show a direct link to hematopoiesis, tumorigenesis or leukemia (e.g. GATA-1/2, PU.1, MZF-1).
Specific alleles at predicted TFBSs may alter the expression of RPS19, modify an important interaction between transcription factors with overlapping TFBS or remove an important stimulus for hematopoiesis. We suggest that the detected interactions are of importance for hematopoiesis and could provide new insights into individual response to treatment.
Immature cells of the mononuclear phagocyte series differentiate in response to calcitriol. This is accompanied by increased expression of both CD11b and CD14 and has been shown to be phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) dependent. The events downstream of PI3K that regulate mononuclear phagocyte gene expression, however, remain to be fully understood. In the present study, we show that incubation of THP-1 cells with calcitriol brings about activation of the myeloid zinc finger-1 (MZF-1) transcription factor dependent upon PI3K. In addition, we show that the proximal promoter regions of both CD11b and CD14 contain functional MZF-1 binding sites that are calcitriol responsive. Site-directed mutagenesis of the putative MZF-1 elements abolished MZF-1 binding to the promoters of both CD11b and CD14. Not only did calcitriol treatment increase MZF-1 DNA binding activity to these sites, but it also up-regulated cellular levels of MZF-1. Silencing of MZF-1 resulted in a markedly blunted response to calcitriol for induction of both CD11b and CD14 mRNA transcript levels. Cell surface expression of CD11b and CD14 was also reduced, but to a lesser extent. Taken together, these results show that MZF-1 is involved downstream of PI3K in a calcitriol-induced signaling pathway leading to myeloid cell differentiation and activation of CD11b and CD14.
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with unknown etiology, characterized by the presence of auto-antibodies to various cellular components and chronic inflammation of different organ systems. A number of susceptibility loci for SLE have been suggested in different populations, but the nature of the susceptibility genes and mutations is yet to be identified. The programmed cell death 1 gene (PDCD1) was considered to be one of the strongest candidate genes associated with SLE. Here, we analyzed 265 individuals for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PDCD1, including 122 unrelated individuals affected with SLE and 143 random healthy volunteer individuals in Han Chinese. Genomic DNA was prepared from peripheral blood leukocytes and the SNPs were further confirmed by DNA sequencing. We found there were statistically significant differences in the distribution of genotypes at 7872 locus (OR = 0.59, 95%CI = 0.41-0.85) and 8162 locus (OR = 0.54, 95%CI = 0.37-0.78) between SLE and control. Genotype TT in 7872 locus (OR = 0.58, 95%CI = 0.34-1.00) and GG genotype in 8162 locus (OR = 0.46, 95%CI = 0.26-0.80) might be protective for SLE prevention. The associated SNPs might regulate the binding of some transcription factors, such as AML-1a, USF and MZF-1, suggesting a mechanism through which it can contribute to the predisposition of SLE.
Our bioinformatics research shows that there are four G-rich sequences (S1-S4) in the upstream region of the transcription start site of c-Myb gene, and we have proved that these sequences have the ability to form G-quadruplex structures. This work mainly focuses on G-quadruplex function, recognition and transcription regulation in c-Myb gene, revealing a novel regulatory element in c-Myb proximal promoter region, and its transcription regulation by G-quadruplex binder. The research has identified that the enhancer effect in c-Myb transcription was primarily affected by the G-quadruplex formed by S1 sequence, and the up-regulation effect may due to the removal of repressive progress of MZF-1 by stabilizing G-quadruplex. Attentions were being paid to the development of G-quadruplex binders for selective recognition, and topotecan was found to have high binding affinity in vitro and could effectively affect the c-Myb transcription activities in cells. The regulation of G-quadruplex with binders in transcriptional, translational levels by Q-RT-PCR and western blot was in expectation of providing a strategy for gene expression modulation. In conclusion, our study revealed a G-quadruplex structure in c-Myb proximal promoter region, which was of great importance in the regulation of c-Myb function.
Preeclampsia is a pregnancy disease affecting 5 to 8% of pregnant women and a leading cause of both maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity. Because of a default in the process of implantation, the placenta of preeclamptic women undergoes insufficient vascularization. This results in placental ischemia, inflammation and subsequent release of placental debris and vasoactive factors in the maternal circulation causing a systemic endothelial activation. Several microarray studies have analyzed the transcriptome of the preeclamptic placentas to identify genes which could be involved in placental dysfunction. In this study, we compared the data from publicly available microarray analyses to obtain a consensus list of modified genes. This allowed to identify consistently modified genes in the preeclamptic placenta. Of these, 67 were up-regulated and 31 down-regulated. Assuming that changes in the transcription level of co-expressed genes may result from the coordinated action of a limited number of transcription factors, we looked for over-represented putative transcription factor binding sites in the promoters of these genes. Indeed, we found that the promoters of up-regulated genes are enriched in putative binding sites for NFkB, CREB, ANRT, REEB1, SP1, and AP-2. In the promoters of down-regulated genes, the most prevalent putative binding sites are those of MZF-1, NFYA, E2F1 and MEF2A. These transcriptions factors are known to regulate specific biological pathways such as cell responses to inflammation, hypoxia, DNA damage and proliferation. We discuss here the molecular mechanisms of action of these transcription factors and how they can be related to the placental dysfunction in the context of preeclampsia.
The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha protein, encoded by the PPARGC1A gene, plays an important role in energy homeostasis. The genetic variations within the PPARGC1A gene promoter region were scanned in 808 Chinese native bovines belonging to three cattle breeds and yaks. A total of 6 SNPs and one 4 bp insertion variation in the promoter region of the bovine PPARGC1A gene were identified: SNP -259 T&gt;A, -301_-298insCTTT, -915 A&gt;G, -1175 T&gt;G, -1590 C&gt;T, -1665 C&gt;T and -1690 G&gt;A, which are in the binding sites of some important transcription factors: sex-determining region Y (SRY), myeloid-specific zinc finger-1 (MZF-1) and octamer factor 1(Oct-1). It is expected that these polymorphisms may regulate PPARGC1A gene transcription and might have consequences at a regulatory level. 
Delivery of therapeutic compounds to the inner ear via absorption through the round window membrane (RWM) has advantages over direct intracochlear infusions; specifically, minimizing impact upon functional hearing measures. However, previous reports show that significant basal-to-apical concentration gradients occur, with the potential to impact treatment efficacy. Here we present a new approach to inner ear drug delivery with induced advection aiding distribution of compounds throughout the inner ear in the murine cochlea. Polyimide microtubing was placed near the RWM niche through a bullaostomy into the middle ear cavity allowing directed delivery of compounds to the RWM. We hypothesized that a posterior semicircular canalostomy would induce apical flow from the patent cochlear aqueduct to the canalostomy due to influx of cerebral spinal fluid. To test this hypothesis, young adult CBA/CaJ mice were divided into two groups: bullaostomy approach only (BA) and bullaostomy+canalostomy (B+C). Cochlear function was evaluated by distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) and auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds during and after middle ear infusion of salicylate in artificial perilymph (AP), applied near the RWM. The mice recovered for 1week, and were re-tested. The results demonstrate there was no significant impact on auditory function utilizing the RWM surgical procedure with or without the canalostomy, and DPOAE thresholds were elevated reversibly during the salicylate infusion. Comparing the threshold shifts for both methods, the B+C approach had more of a physiological effect than the BA approach, including at lower frequencies representing more apical cochlear locations. Unlike mouse cochleostomies, there was no deleterious auditory functional impact after 1week recovery from surgery. The B+C approach had more drug efficacy at lower frequencies, underscoring potential benefits for more precise control of delivery of inner ear therapeutic compounds. 
cDNA representational difference analysis (RDA) was used to study gene expression profiles in the ileal Peyer's patch of a lamb 1 week after oral inoculation with the scrapie agent. Twenty-five differentially expressed cDNA fragments were identified and cloned. Sequence analysis indicated seven novel gene sequences. Other clones shared sequence homology with genes encoding ribosomal and mitochondrial proteins, the translation initiation factor EIF4GII and the bovine pancreatic thread protein. Reverse Northern was used to confirm the differential expression in another four lambs inoculated with scrapie and the tissue distribution of the novel genes was examined using Northern blot analysis.
Cleavage of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4GI (eIF4GI) by viral 2A protease (2Apro) has been proposed to cause severe translation inhibition in poliovirus-infected cells. However, infections containing 1 mM guanidine-HCl result in eIF4GI cleavage but only partial translation shutoff, indicating eIF4GI cleavage is insufficient for drastic translation inhibition. Viral 3C protease (3Cpro) cleaves poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) and removes the C-terminal domain (CTD) that interacts with several translation factors. In HeLa cell translation extracts that exhibit cap-poly(A) synergy, partial cleavage of PABP by 3Cpro inhibited translation of endogenous mRNAs and reporter RNA as effectively as complete cleavage of eIF4GI and eIF4GII by 2Apro. 3Cpro-mediated translation inhibition was poly(A) dependent, and addition of PABP to extracts restored translation. Expression of 3Cpro in HeLa cells resulted in partial PABP cleavage and similar inhibition of translation. PABP cleavage did not affect eIF4GI-PABP interactions, and the results of kinetics experiments suggest that 3Cpro might inhibit late steps in translation or ribosome recycling. The data illustrate the importance of the CTD of PABP in poly(A)-dependent translation in mammalian cells. We propose that enteroviruses use a dual strategy for host translation shutoff, requiring cleavage of PABP by 3Cpro and of eIF4G by 2Apro.
Initiation of poliovirus (PV) protein synthesis is governed by an internal ribosome entry segment structured into several domains including domain V, which is accepted to be important in PV neurovirulence because it harbors an attenuating mutation in each of the vaccine strains developed by A. Sabin. To better understand how these single point mutations exert their effects, we placed each of them into the same genomic context, that of PV type 1. Only the mutation equivalent to the Sabin type 3 strain mutation resulted in significantly reduced viral growth both in HeLa and neuroblastoma cells. This correlated with poor translation efficiency in vitro and could be explained by a structural perturbation of the domain V of the internal ribosome entry segment, as evidenced by RNA melting experiments. We demonstrated that reduced cell death observed during infection by this mutant is due to the absence of inhibition of host cell translation. We confirmed that this shut-off is correlated principally with cleavage of eIF4GII and not eIF4GI and that this cleavage is significantly impaired in the case of the defective mutant. These data support the previously reported conclusion that the 2A protease has markedly different affinities for the two eIF4G isoforms.
The initiation factor eIF4G plays a central role in the regulation of translation. In picornaviruses, as well as in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), cleavage of eIF4G by the viral protease leads to inhibition of protein synthesis directed by capped cellular mRNAs. In the present work, cleavage of both eIF4GI and eIF4GII has been analyzed by employing the proteases encoded within the genomes of several members of the family Retroviridae, e.g., Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV), mouse mammary tumor virus, human T-cell leukemia virus type 1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus. All of the retroviral proteases examined were able to cleave the initiation factor eIF4GI both in intact cells and in cell-free systems, albeit with different efficiencies. The eIF4GI hydrolysis patterns obtained with HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases were very similar to each other but rather different from those obtained with MoMLV protease. Both eIF4GI and eIF4GII were cleaved very efficiently by the MoMLV protease. However, eIF4GII was a poor substrate for HIV proteases. Proteolytic cleavage of eIF4G led to a profound inhibition of cap-dependent translation, while protein synthesis driven by mRNAs containing internal ribosome entry site elements remained unaffected or was even stimulated in transfected cells.
CaMKI is a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase that is widely expressed in eukaryotic cells and tissues but for which few, if any, physiological substrates are known. We screened a human lung cDNA expression library for potential CaMKI substrates by solid phase in situ phosphorylation ("phosphorylation screening"). Multiple overlapping partial length cDNAs encoding three proteins were detected. Two of these proteins are known: 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase and eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 4GII. To determine whether CaMKI substrates identified by phosphorylation screening represent authentic physiological targets, we examined the potential for [Ca2+]i- and CaMKI-dependent phosphorylation of eIF4GII in vitro and in vivo. Endogenous eIF4GII immunoprecipitated from HEK293T cells was phosphorylated by CaMKI, in vitro as was a recombinant fragment of eIF4GII encompassing the central and C-terminal regions. The latter phosphorylation occurred with favorable kinetics (Km = 1 microm; kcat = 1.8 s-1) at a single site, Ser1156, located in a segment of eIF4GII aligning with the phosphoregion of eIF4GI. Phosphopeptide mapping and back phosphorylation experiments revealed [Ca2+]i-dependent, CaMKI site-specific, eIF4GII phosphorylation in vivo. This phosphorylation was blocked by kinase-negative CaMKI consistent with a requirement for endogenous CaMKI for in vivo eIF4GII phosphorylation. We conclude that phosphorylation screening is an effective method for searching for intracellular targets of CaMKI and may have identified a new role of Ca2+ signaling to the translation apparatus.
Several picornaviruses shut down host cellular protein synthesis by proteolytic cleavage of the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4GI and eIF4GII isoforms. Viral RNA translation is maintained by a cap-independent mechanism. Here, we identify the human rhinovirus 2 2A(pro) cleavage site in eIF4GII in vitro as PLLNV(699)*GSR; this sequence lies seven amino acids C-terminal to the cleavage site previously identified in eIF4GI (LSTR681*GPP).
We have recently reported that HIV-1 protease (PR) cleaves the initiation factor of translation eIF4GI [Ventoso et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98 (2001) 12966-12971]. Here, we analyze the proteolytic activity of HIV-1 PR on eIF4GI and eIF4GII and its implications for the translation of mRNAs. HIV-1 PR efficiently cleaves eIF4GI, but not eIF4GII, in cell-free systems as well as in transfected mammalian cells. This specific proteolytic activity of the retroviral protease on eIF4GI was more selective than that observed with poliovirus 2A(pro). Despite the presence of an intact endogenous eIF4GII, cleavage of eIF4GI by HIV-1 PR was sufficient to impair drastically the translation of capped and uncapped mRNAs. In contrast, poliovirus IRES-driven translation was unaffected or even enhanced by HIV-1 PR after cleavage of eIF4GI. Further support for these in vitro results has been provided by the expression of HIV-1 PR in COS cells from a Gag-PR precursor. Our present findings suggest that eIF4GI intactness is necessary to maintain cap-dependent translation, not only in cell-free systems but also in mammalian cells.
The leader proteinase (L(pro)) of foot and mouth disease virus is a papain-like cysteine proteinase. After processing itself from the polyprotein, L(pro) then cleaves the host protein eukaryotic initiation factor (eIf) 4GI, thus preventing protein synthesis from capped mRNA in the infected cell. We have investigated L(pro) interaction with eIF4GI and its isoform, eIF4GII. L(pro), expressed as a catalytically inactive fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase, binds specifically to eIF4G isomers in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. Deletion and specific mutagenesis were used to map the binding domain on L(pro) to residues 183-195 of the C-terminal extension and to residue Cys(133). These residues of the C-terminal extension and Cys(133) are adjacent in the crystal structure but lie about 25 A from the active site. The region on eIF4GI recognized by the L(pro) C-terminal extension was mapped to residues 640-669 using eIF4GI fragments generated by proteolysis or by in vitro translation. The L(pro) cleavage site at Gly(674) downward arrow Arg(675) was not necessary for binding. Similar experiments with human rhinovirus 2A proteinase (2A(pro)), a chymotrypsin-like cysteine proteinase that also cleaves eIF4G isoforms, revealed that 2A(pro) can also bind to eIF4GI fragments lacking its cleavage site. These experiments strongly suggest a novel interaction between picornaviral proteinases and eIF4G isoforms.
Infection of mammalian cells with picornaviruses like entero-, rhino-, and aphthoviruses leads to an inhibition of cap-dependent cellular protein synthesis by the cleavage of both translation initiation factors, eIF4GI and eIF4GII. In entero- and rhinovirus infection this cleavage process is mediated by the viral 2A proteinase (2A(pro)). In order to discriminate between a direct mode of eIF4G cleavage and an indirect cleavage via activation of a cellular proteinase, a thermosensitive 2A(pro) mutant (ts-2A(pro)) of human rhinovirus 2 was employed. Temperature shift experiments of cytoplasmic HeLa cell extracts incubated with ts-2A(pro) strongly support a direct mode of cleavage of eIF4GI and eIF4GII by the viral 2A(pro).
