The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanisms that control the expression of the human LXRα gene in hepatic cells. A series of reporter plasmids containing consecutive 5' deletions of the hLXRα promoter upstream of the luciferase gene were constructed and the activity of each construct was measured in HepG2 cells. This analysis showed that the activity of the human LXRα promoter was significantly reduced by deleting the -111 to -42 region suggesting the presence of positive regulatory elements in this short proximal fragment. Bioinformatics data including motif search and ChIP-Seq revealed the presence of a potential binding motif for Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4 α (HNF-4α) in this area. Overexpression of HNF-4α in HEK 293T cells increased the expression of all LXRα promoter constructs except -42/+384. In line, silencing the expression of endogenous HNF-4α in HepG2 cells was associated with reduced LXRα protein levels and reduced activity of the -111/+384 LXRα promoter but not of the -42/+384 promoter. Using ChiP assays in HepG2 cells combined with DNAP assays we mapped the novel HNF-4α specific binding motif (H4-SBM) in the -50 to -40 region of the human LXRα promoter. A triple mutation in this H4-SBM abolished HNF-4α binding and reduced the activity of the promoter to 65% relative to the wild type. Furthermore, the mutant promoter could not be transactivated by HNF-4α. In conclusion, our data indicate that HNF-4α may have a wider role in cell and plasma cholesterol homeostasis by controlling the expression of LXRα in hepatic cells. 
Diabetic cardiomyopathy is a myocardial disease triggered by impaired insulin signalling, increased fatty acid uptake and diminished glucose utilisation. Liver X receptors (LXRs) are key transcriptional regulators of metabolic homeostasis. However, their effect in the diabetic heart is largely unknown.
We cloned murine Lxrα (also known as Nr1h3) behind the α-myosin heavy chain (αMhc; also known as Myh6) promoter to create transgenic (Lxrα-Tg) mice and transgene-negative littermates (wild-type [WT]). A mouse model of type 2 diabetes was induced by a high-fat diet (HFD, 60% energy from fat) over 16 weeks and compared with a low-fat diet (10% energy from fat). A mouse model of type 1 diabetes was induced via streptozotocin injection over 12 weeks.
HFD manifested comparable increases in body weight, plasma triacylglycerol and insulin resistance per OGTT in Lxrα-Tg and WT mice. HFD significantly increased left ventricular weight by 21% in WT hearts, but only by 5% in Lxrα-Tg. To elucidate metabolic effects in the heart, microPET (positron emission tomography) imaging revealed that cardiac glucose uptake was increased by 1.4-fold in WT mice on an HFD, but further augmented by 1.7-fold in Lxrα-Tg hearts, in part through 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and restoration of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4). By contrast, streptozotocin-induced ablation of insulin signalling diminished cardiac glucose uptake levels and caused cardiac dysfunction, indicating that insulin may be important in LXRα-mediated glucose uptake. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays identified natriuretic peptides, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), as potential direct targets of cardiac LXRα overexpression.
Cardiac-specific LXRα overexpression ameliorates the progression of HFD-induced left ventricular hypertrophy in association with increased glucose reliance and natriuretic peptide signalling during the early phase of diabetic cardiomyopathy. These findings implicate a potential protective role for LXR in targeting metabolic disturbances underlying diabetes.
Soyasaponin Ab (SA) has been reported to have anti-inflammatory effect. However, the effects of SA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) have not been reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of SA on LPS-induced ALI and clarify the possible mechanism. The mice were stimulated with LPS to induce ALI. SA was given 1h after LPS treatment. 12h later, lung tissues were collected to assess pathological changes and edema. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected to assess inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide (NO) production. In vitro, mice alveolar macrophages were used to investigate the anti-inflammatory mechanism of SA. Our results showed that SA attenuated LPS-induced lung pathological changes, edema, the expression of cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in lung tissues, as well as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and NO production in mice. Meanwhile, SA up-regulated the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase decreased by LPS in mice. SA also inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β production as well as NF-κB activation in alveolar macrophages. Furthermore, SA could activate Liver X Receptor Alpha (LXRα) and knockdown of LXRα by RNAi abrogated the anti-inflammatory effects of SA. In conclusion, the current study demonstrated that SA exhibited protective effects against LPS-induced acute lung injury and the possible mechanism was involved in activating LXRα, thereby inhibiting LPS-induced inflammatory response. 
Recent studies have shown that activation of liver X receptors (LXRs) attenuates the development of atherosclerosis, not only by regulating lipid metabolism but also by suppressing inflammatory signaling. Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2), an important inflammatory gene product, plays a role in the development of various inflammatory diseases. It was proposed that S1PR2 might be regulated by LXR-α. In the present study, the effect of LXR-α on tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced S1PR2 expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was investigated and the underlying mechanism was explored. The results demonstrated that TNF-α led to an increase in S1PR2 expression and triggered a downregulation of LXR-α expression in HUVECs as well. Downregulation of LXR-α with specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) remarkably enhanced the primary as well as TNF-α-induced expression of S1PR2 in HUVECs. Activation of LXR-α by agonist GW3965 inhibited both primary and TNF-α-induced S1PR2 expression. GW3965 also attenuated S1PR2-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction. The data further showed that TNF-α induced a significant decrease in miR-130a-3p expression. Overexpression of miR-130a-3p with mimic product reduced S1PR2 protein expression, and inhibition of miR-130a-3p by specific inhibitor resulted in an increase in S1PR2 protein expression. Furthermore, activation of LXRs with agonist enhanced the expression of miR-130a-3p, and knockdown of LXR-α by siRNA suppressed miR-130a-3p expression. These results suggest that LXR-α might downregulate S1PR2 expression via miR-130a-3p in quiescent HUVECs. Stimulation of TNF-α attenuates the activity of LXR-α and results in enhanced S1PR2 expression. 
The accumulation of cholesterol in macrophages could induce the formation of foam cells and increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis. We wonder if quercetin, one of flavonoids with anti-inflammation functions in different cell types, could elevate the development of foam cells formation in atherosclerosis. We treated foam cells derived from oxLDL induced THP-1 cells with quercetin, and evaluated the foam cells formation, cholesterol content and apoptosis of the cells. We found that quercetin induced the expression of ABCA1 in differentiated THP-1 cells, and increased the cholesterol efflux from THP-1 cell derived foam cells. Eventually, cholesterol level and the formation of foam cell derived from THP-1 cells decreased after quercetin treatment. In addition, quercetin activated PPARγ-LXRα pathway to upregulate ABCA1 expression through increasing protein level of PPARγ and its transcriptional activity. Inhibition of PPARγ activity by siRNA knockdown or the addition of chemical inhibitor, GW9662, abolished quercetin induced ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux in THP-1 derived macrophages. Our data demonstrated that quercetin increased cholesterol efflux from macrophages through upregulating the expressions of PPARγ and ABCA1. Taken together, increasing uptake of quercetin or quercetin-rich foods would be an effective way to lower the risk of atherosclerosis. 
A promising treatment for obesity involves the use of therapeutic agents that increase the level of the glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) which reduces appetite and food intake. Native GLP-1 is rapidly metabolized by the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) enzyme and, as such, GLP-1 mimetics or DPP-4 inhibitors represent promising treatment approaches. Interestingly, obese patient receiving such medications showed improved lipid profiles and cholesterol homeostasis, however the mechanism(s) involved are not known. Members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, including ABCA1 and ABCG1, play essential roles in reverse cholesterol transport and in high density lipoprotein (HDL) formation. These transporters are under the transcriptional regulation of liver X receptor alpha (LXR-α). We hypothesize that GLP-1 mimetics and/or DPP-4 inhibitors modulate ABCA1/ABCG1 expression in adipocytes through an LXR-α mediated process and thus affecting cholesterol homeostasis. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with the DPP-4 inhibitor vildagliptin (2 nM) or the GLP-1 mimetic exendin-4 (5 nM). Gene and protein expression of ABCA1, ABCG1 and LXR-α were determined and correlated with cholesterol efflux. Expression levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), leptin and the glucose transporter-4 (GLUT-4) were also determined. Treatment with both medications significantly increased the expression of ABCA1, ABCG1, LXR-α and GLUT-4, decreased IL-6 and leptin, and improved cholesterol efflux from adipocytes (P &lt; 0.05). Our data suggest that GLP-1-based therapy modulate ABCA1/ABCG1 expression in adipocytes potentially through an LXR-α mediated process. 
Sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1; gene name SREBF1) is known to be the master regulator of lipid homeostasis in mammals, including milk fat synthesis. The major role of SREBP1 in controlling milk fat synthesis has been demonstrated in bovine mammary epithelial cells. Except for a demonstrated role in controlling the expression of FASN, a regulatory role of SREBP1 on milk fat synthesis is very likely, but has not yet been demonstrated in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMEC). To explore the regulatory function of SREBP1 on de novo fatty acids and triacylglycerol synthesis in GMEC, we overexpressed the mature form of SREBP1 (active NH2-terminal fragment) in GMEC using a recombinant adenovirus vector (Ad-nSREBP1), with Ad-GFP (recombinant adenovirus of green fluorescent protein) as control, and infected the GMEC for 48 h. In infected cells, we assessed the expression of 20 genes related to milk fat synthesis using real time-quantitative PCR, the protein abundance of SREBP1 and FASN by Western blot, the production of triacylglycerol, and the fatty acid profile. Expression of SREBF1 was modest in mammary compared with the other tissues in dairy goats but its expression increased approximately 30-fold from pregnancy to lactation. The overexpression of the mature form of SREBP1 was confirmed by &gt;200-fold higher expression of SREBF1 in Ad-nSREBP1 compared with Ad-GFP. We observed no changes in amount of the precursor form of SREBP1 protein but a &gt;10-fold increase of the mature form of SREBP1 protein with Ad-nSREBP1. Compared with Ad-GFP cells (control), Ad-nSREBP1 cells had a significant increase in expression of genes related to long-chain fatty acid activation (ACSL1), transport (FABP3), desaturation (SCD1), de novo synthesis of fatty acids (ACSS2, ACLY, IDH1, ACACA, FASN, and ELOVL6), and transcriptional factors (NR1H3 and PPARG). We observed a &gt;10-fold increase in expression of INSIG1 but SCAP was downregulated by Ad-nSREBP1. Among genes related to milk fat synthesis and lipid droplet formation, only LPIN1 and DGAT1 were upregulated by Ad-nSREBP1. Compared with the Ad-GFP, the cellular triacylglycerol content was higher and the percentage of C16:0 and C18:1 increased, whereas that of C16:1, C18:0, and C18:2 decreased in Ad-nSREBP1 cells. Overall, the data provide strong support for a central role of SREBP1 in the regulation of milk fat synthesis in goat mammary cells. 
Nuclear hormone receptor liver X receptor-alpha (LXRα) has a vital role in cholesterol homeostasis and is reported to have a role in adipose function and obesity although this is controversial. Conversely, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are suggested to be a major source of adipocyte generation. Accordingly, we examined the role of LXRα in adipogenesis of MSCs. Adult murine MSCs (mMSCs) were isolated from wild-type (WT) and LXR-null mice. Using WT mMSCs, we further generated cell lines stably overexpressing GFP-LXRα (mMSC/LXRα/GFP) or GFP alone (mMSC/GFP) by retroviral infection. Confluent mMSCs were differentiated into adipocytes by the established protocol. Compared with MSCs isolated from WT mice, MSCs from LXR-null mice showed significantly increased adipogenesis, as determined by lipid droplet accumulation and adipogenesis-related gene expression. Moreover, mMSCs stably overexpressing GFP-LXRα (mMSC/LXRα/GFP) exhibited significantly decreased adipogenesis compared with mMSCs overexpressing GFP alone (mMSC/GFP). Since Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is reported to inhibit adipogenesis, we further examined it. The LXR-null group showed significantly decreased Wnt expression accompanied by a decrease of cellular beta-catenin (vs WT). The mMSC/LXRα/GFP group exhibited significantly increased Wnt expression accompanied by an increase of cellular beta-catenin (vs mMSC/GFP). These data demonstrate that LXRα has an inhibitory effect on adipogenic differentiation in mMSCs with Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. These results provide important insights into the pathophysiology of obesity and obesity-related consequences such as metabolic syndrome and may identify potential therapeutic targets. 
Betaine has been proven effective in treating nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in animal models, however, its molecular mechanisms remain elusive. The aims of this study were to explore the mechanisms mediating the anti-inflammatory and anti-lipogenic actions of betaine in fructose-fed rats. In this study, betaine improved insulin resistance, reduced body weight gain and serum lipid levels, and prevented hepatic lipid accumulation in fructose-fed rats. It up-regulated hepatic expression of liver X receptor-alpha (LXRα) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARα), with the attenuation of the changes of their target genes, including hepatic carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT) 1α, glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored high density lipoprotein binding protein 1, apolipoprotein B, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c and adipocyte differentiation-related protein, involved in fatty acid oxidation and lipid storage in these model rats. Furthermore, betaine alleviated ER stress and inhibited acetyl-CoA carboxylase α, CPT II, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 and fatty acid synthase expression involved in fatty acid synthesis in the liver of fructose-fed rats. Betaine suppressed hepatic gluconeogenesis in fructose-fed rats by moderating protein kinase B -forkhead box protein O1 pathway, as well as p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin activity. Moreover, betaine inhibited hepatic nuclear factor kappa B /nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, pyrin domain-containing-3 inflammasome activation-mediated inflammation in this animal model. These results demonstrated that betaine ameliorated hepatic lipid accumulation, gluconeogenesis, and inflammation through restoring LXRα and PPARα expression and alleviating ER stress in fructose-fed rats. This study provides the potential mechanisms of betaine involved in the treatment of NAFLD. 
Increasing evidence shows that diabetes causes cardiac dysfunction. We hypothesized that a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue, liraglutide, would attenuate cardiac dysfunction in diabetic rats. Twenty-four Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were divided into 2 groups fed either a normal diet (normal, n = 6) or a high-fat diet (HFD, n = 18) for 4 weeks. Then, the HFD rats were injected with streptozotocin (STZ) to create a diabetic rat model. Diabetic rats were divided into 3 subgroups receiving vehicle (diabetic, n = 6), a low dose of liraglutide (Llirag, 0.2 mg/kg/day, n = 6) or a high dose of liraglutide (Hlirag, 0.4 mg/kg/day, n = 6). Metabolic parameters, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, left ventricular (LV) function, and whole genome expression of the heart were determined. Diabetic rats developed insulin resistance, increased blood lipid levels and oxidative stress, and impaired LV function, serum adiponectin, NO. Liraglutide improved insulin resistance, serum adiponectin, NO, heart rate and LV function and reduced blood triglyceride, total cholesterol levels and oxidative stress. Moreover, liraglutide increased heart Nr1h3 , Ppar-α and Srebp expression and reduced Dgat , and Angptl3 expression. Liraglutide prevented in cardiac dysfunction by activating the PPARα pathway to inhibit Dgat expression and oxidative stress in diabetic rats.
Adipogenesis is a complex biological process involving synchronised interplay of different nuclear receptors. Aberration in the process leads to obesity and associated disorders. Addressing the complexity of molecular mechanisms, we worked on characterising the changes in NR1C3/PPARγ-, NR1H3/LXRα- and NCoAs/SRCs-associated microRNA, genes and proteins during different time points of adipogenesis. Glucose uptake of differentiating cells was checked at selected time points with FACS. Observations on gene expression pattern pointed a correlation in adipogenic-related genes and increased expression of PPARγ, but not LXRα. Western blot experiments also supported the gene expression pattern. MicroRNAs that vary during adipogenesis was selected using bioinformatics tools and database. Real-time PCR-based experiments showed a change in the expression of mmu-mir-23a-3p, 206-3p, 17-3p, 126a-3p and 1a-3p. Mmu-mir-23a-3p showed a gradual decrease in expression corresponding to the progression of adipogenesis. MicroRNA 23a-3p and 1a-3p showed positive association to the mRNA levels of NCoA1 and 3. Overall, the study elaborates time-dependent variations in nucleic acid and protein expression during adipogenesis in accordance to fatty acid and glucose metabolism.
Lipid metabolism disorders (dyslipidemia) are causes of male infertility, but little is known about their impact on male gametes when considering post-testicular maturation events, given that studies concentrate most often on endocrine dysfunctions and testicular consequences. In this study, three-month-old wild-type (wt) and Liver-X-Receptors knock out (Lxrα;β

                     ) males were fed four weeks with a control or a lipid-enriched diet containing 1.25% cholesterol (high cholesterol diet (HCD)). The HCD triggered a dyslipidemia leading to sperm post-testicular alterations and infertility. Sperm lipids were analyzed by LC-MS and those from Lxrα;β

It may lead to the identification of fertility prognostic markers in this pathophysiological situation, which could help clinicians to better understand male infertilities which are thus far classified as idiopathic.
Exposure to metabolic stress has been suggested to influence the susceptibility to metabolic disorders in offspring according to epidemiological and animal studies. Nevertheless, molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated impacts of diet-induced paternal obesity on metabolic phenotypes in offspring and its underlying molecular mechanism.
Male founder mice (F0), fed with control diet (CD) or high-fat diet (HFD), were mated with CD-fed females. F1 progenies were mated with outbred mice to generate F2 mice. All offspring were maintained on CD. Metabolic phenotypes, metabolism-related gene expression and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers were measured in serum or relevant tissues of F2 mice. DNA methylation in sperm and testis of the founder and in the liver of F2 mice was investigated.
Male founder obesity, instigated by HFD, led to glucose dysregulation transmitted down to F2. We found that F2 males to HFD founders were overweight and had a high fasting glucose relative to F2 to CD founders. F2 females to HFD founders, in contrast, had a reduced bodyweight relative to F2 to CD founders and exhibited an early onset of impaired glucose homeostasis. The sex-specific difference was associated with distinct transcriptional patterns in metabolism-related organs, showing altered hepatic glycolysis and decreased adipose Glucose transporter 4 (Glut4) in males and increased gluconeogenesis and lipid synthesis in females. Furthermore, the changes in females were linked to hepatic ER stress, leading to suppressed insulin signaling and non-obese hyperglycemic phenotypes. DNA methylation analysis revealed that the Nr1h3 locus was sensitive to HFD at founder germ cells and the alteration was also detected in the liver of F2 female.
Our findings demonstrate that male founder obesity influences impaired glucose regulation in F2 progeny possibly via ER stress in a sex-specific manner and it is, in part, contributed by altered DNA methylation at the Nr1h3 locus.
Macrophages play pivotal roles in the progression and regression of atherosclerosis. Accumulating evidence suggests that macrophage polarization into an anti-inflammatory M2 state is a key characteristic of atherosclerotic plaques undergoing regression. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this potential association of the M2 polarization with atherosclerosis regression remain poorly understood. Further, human genetic factors that facilitate these anti-atherogenic processes remain largely unknown. We report that the transcription factor MafB plays pivotal roles in promoting macrophage M2 polarization. Further, MafB promotes cholesterol efflux from macrophage foam cells by directly up-regulating its key cellular mediators. Notably, MafB expression is significantly up-regulated in response to various metabolic and immunological stimuli that promote macrophage M2 polarization or cholesterol efflux, and thereby MafB mediates their beneficial effects, in both liver x receptor (LXR)-dependent and independent manners. In contrast, MafB is strongly down-regulated upon elevated pro-inflammatory signaling or by pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic microRNAs, miR-155 and miR-33. Using an integrative systems biology approach, we also revealed that M2 polarization and cholesterol efflux do not necessarily represent inter-dependent events, but MafB is broadly involved in both the processes. These findings highlight physiological protective roles that MafB may play against atherosclerosis progression.
Inflammatory factors regulated by NF-κB play a significant role in PAH and myocardial hypertrophy. LXR activation may inhibit myocardial hypertrophy via suppressing inflammatory pathways; it is unknown whether LXR is also involved in PAH-induced myocardial hypertrophy or remodeling. To further explore the protective effect of LXR in PAH-induced cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling, a PAH model was developed, and T0901317, an agonist of LXR, was used to examine the effect of LXR activation. PAH rats demonstrated obvious cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling in the right ventricle, but significant improvement of cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling was observed in PAH rats treated with T0901317. Through RT-PCR, Western blot and ELISA examination, NF-κB, IL-6, TNF-α, and iNOS were found to be significantly reduced in PAH rats treated with T0901317 compared to PAH rats treated with DMSO. Apoptosis was also significantly reduced in PAH rats treated with T0901317. Thus, LXR activation may inhibit PAH-induced cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling by inhibiting NF-κB-mediated inflammatory pathways.
With emerging evidence connecting cholesterol dysregulation with disturbed pulmonary homeostasis, we are wondering if diet induced hypercholesterolemia would influence the susceptibility to chemical induced lung tumorigenesis in mice. Six to eight week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed with either a high-cholesterol atherogenic diet (HCD) or matching normal diet (ND), respectively. Following 3 weeks diet adapting, a multi-dose intraperitoneal injections of ethyl carbamate (urethane, 1 g/kg body weight) were established and lung tumorigenesis assessments were taken after 15 weeks latency period. Compared to the urethane treated ND-fed mice, the HCD-fed mice exhibited significantly decreased lung tumor multiplicity and attenuated pulmonary inflammation, which including reduced influx of leukocytes and down regulated tumor-promoting cyto-/chemokine profile in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, decreased TLR2/4 expression and NF-κB activation in the lung. As a sensor regulating intracellular cholesterol homeostasis, nuclear receptor LXR-α was up-regulated significantly in the urethane treated HCD-fed mice lungs compared to the ND-fed mice lungs, accompanied with decreased pulmonary free cholesterol content and suppressed tumor cell proliferation. These results suggested that intrapulmonary cholesterol homeostasis, other than systematic cholesterol level, is important in lung tumorigenesis, and LXR activation might partly contribute to the inhibitory role of atherogenic diet on lung tumorigenesis.
Liver X receptors (LXRα/β) and carbohydrate response element-binding proteins (ChREBPα/β) are key players in the transcriptional control of hepatic de novo lipogenesis. LXRα/β double knockout (LXRα-/-/β-/-) mice have reduced feeding-induced nuclear O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) signaling, ChREBPα activity, and lipogenic gene expression in livers, suggesting important roles for LXRs in linking hepatic glucose utilization to lipid synthesis. However, the role of LXRs in fructose-induced ChREBP activation and lipogenesis is currently unknown. In this study, we studied the effects of high fructose or high glucose feeding on hepatic carbohydrate metabolism and lipogenic gene expression in livers from fasted (24 h) and fasted-refed (12 h) wild type and LXRα knockout (LXRα-/-) mice. Hepatic lipogenic gene expression was reduced in glucose fed, but not fructose fed LXRα-/- mice. This was associated with lower expression of liver pyruvate-kinase (L-pk) and Chrebpβ, indicating reduced ChREBPα activity in glucose fed, but not fructose fed mice. Interestingly, ChREBP binding to the L-pk promoter was increased in fructose fed LXRα-/- mice, concomitant with increased glucose-6-phosphatase (G6pc) expression and O-GlcNAc modified LXRβ, suggesting a role for LXRβ in regulating ChREBPα activity upon fructose feeding. In conclusion, we propose that LXRα is an important regulator of hepatic lipogenesis and ChREBPα activity upon glucose, but not fructose feeding in mice.
The iodothyronine deiodinases are selenoenzymes that regulate the activity of thyroid hormone via specific inner- or outer-ring deiodination. In humans, type 1 deiodinase (D1) is highly expressed in the liver, but the mechanism by which its gene expression is regulated remains to be elucidated. Liver X receptor α (LXRα), a transcription factor of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is highly expressed in the liver, where it functions as a sensor for excess intracellular oxysterols. LXRα interacts with other nuclear receptors on promoters of genes that contain a binding core sequence for nuclear receptors. In addition, it is reported that the promoter of the gene encoding human D1 (hDIO1) contains the core sequence for one of nuclear receptors, thyroid hormone receptor (TR). We investigated the involvement of LXRα in the regulation of hDIO1, in the liver. We performed hDIO1 promoter-reporter assays using a synthetic LXR agonist, T0901317, and compared promoter activity between a human liver carcinoma cell line, HepG2, and a clone of human embryonic kidney cells, TSA201. We defined the region between nucleotides -131 and -114, especially nucleotides -126 and -125, of the hDIO1 promoter as critical for basal and LXRα-mediated specific transcriptional activation in HepG2 cells. An increase in hDIO1 expression was observed in LXRα-stimulated cells, but absent in cycloheximide-treated cells, indicating that new protein synthesis is required for LXRα-mediated regulation of hDIO1. On the other hand, electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that LXRα and RXRα bound to the hDIO1 promoter. We also demonstrated that LXRα and TRβ compete with each other on this specific region of the promoter. In conclusion, our results indicated that LXRα plays a specific and important role in activation of TH by regulating D1, and that LXRα binds to and regulates the hDIO1 promoter, competing with TRβ on specific sequences within the promoter.
Oxidative stress activates macroautophagy/autophagy and contributes to atherogenesis via lipophagic flux, a form of lipid removal by autophagy. However, it is not known exactly how endogenous antioxidant enzymes are involved in lipophagic flux. Here, we demonstrate that the antioxidant PRDX1 (peroxiredoxin 1) has a crucial role in the maintenance of lipophagic flux in macrophages. PRDX1 is more highly expressed than other antioxidant enzymes in monocytes and macrophages. We determined that Prdx1 deficiency induced excessive oxidative stress and impaired maintenance of autophagic flux in macrophages. Prdx1-deficient macrophages had higher intracellular cholesterol mass and lower cholesterol efflux compared with wild type. This perturbation in cholesterol homeostasis was due to impaired lipophagic cholesterol hydrolysis caused by excessive oxidative stress, resulting in the inhibition of free cholesterol formation and the reduction of NR1H3 (nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group H, member 3) activity. Notably, impairment of both lipophagic flux and cholesterol efflux was restored by the 2-Cys PRDX-mimics ebselen and gliotoxin. Consistent with this observation, apoe -/- mice transplanted with bone marrow from prdx1-/-apoe-/- mice had increased plaque formation compared with apoe-/- BM-transplanted recipients. This study reveals that PRDX1 is crucial to regulating lipophagic flux and maintaining macrophage cholesterol homeostasis against oxidative stress. We suggest that PRDX1-dependent control of oxidative stress may provide a strategy for treating atherosclerosis and autophagy-related human diseases.
Diabesity and fatty liver have been associated with low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and thus could impair macrophage-specific reverse cholesterol transport (m-RCT). Liver X receptor (LXR) plays a critical role in m-RCT. Abcg5/g8 sterol transporters, which are involved in cholesterol trafficking into bile, as well as other LXR targets, could be compromised in the livers of obese individuals. We aimed to determine m-RCT dynamics in a mouse model of diabesity, the db/db mice. These obese mice displayed a significant retention of macrophage-derived cholesterol in the liver and reduced fecal cholesterol elimination compared with nonobese mice. This was associated with a significant downregulation of the hepatic LXR targets, including Abcg5/g8. Pharmacologic induction of LXR promoted the delivery of total tracer output into feces in db/db mice, partly due to increased liver and small intestine Abcg5/Abcg8 gene expression. Notably, a favorable upregulation of the hepatic levels of ABCG5/G8 and NR1H3 was also observed postoperatively in morbidly obese patients, suggesting a similar LXR impairment in these patients. In conclusion, our data show that downregulation of the LXR axis impairs cholesterol transfer from macrophages to feces in db/db mice, whereas the induction of the LXR axis partly restores impaired m-RCT by elevating the liver and small intestine expressions of Abcg5/g8.
Post-prandial hyperlipidemia has emerged as a cardiovascular risk factor with limited therapeutic options. The Liver X receptors (Lxrs) are nuclear hormone receptors that regulate cholesterol elimination. Knowledge of their role in regulating the absorption and handling of dietary fats is incomplete. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of intestinal Lxrα in post-prandial intestinal lipid transport. Using Lxrα knockout (nr1h3-/-) and intestine-limited Lxrα over-expressing [Tg(fabp2a:EGFP-nr1h3)] zebrafish strains, we measured post-prandial lipid excursion with live imaging in larvae and physiological methods in adults. We also conducted a long-term high-cholesterol dietary challenge in adults to examine the chronic effect of modulating nr1h3 gene dose on the development of hypercholesterolemia and hepatic lipid accumulation. Over-expression of Lxrα in the intestine delays the transport of ingested lipids in larvae, while deletion of Lxrα increases the rate of lipid transport. Pre-treating wildtype larvae with the liver-sparing Lxr agonist hyodeoxycholic acid also delayed the rate of intestinal lipid transport in larvae. In adult males, deletion of Lxrα accelerates intestinal transport of ingested lipids. Adult females showed higher plasma Lipoprotein lipase (Lpl) activity compared to males, and lower post-gavage blood triacylglycerol (TAG) excursion. Despite the sexually dimorphic effect on acute intestinal lipid handling, Tg(fabp2a:EGFP-nr1h3) adults of both sexes are protected from high cholesterol diet (HCD)-induced hepatic lipid accumulation, while nr1h3-/- mutants are sensitive to the effects of HCD challenge. These data indicate that intestinal Lxr activity dampens the pace of intestinal lipid transport cell-autonomously. Selective activation of intestinal Lxrα holds therapeutic promise.
Liver X receptor (LXR) activation exerts an anti-tumor effect. However, whether the tumor LXR expression has prognostic significance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patient has not been addressed yet. Primary HCC and the adjacent non-tumor tissues were obtained from 169 patients who underwent routine curative surgical treatment. All patients were followed for prognosis analyses. Tumor LXR was detected by immunohistochemical analysis. In in vitro study, several HCC cell lines were cultured for cellular protein detection of LXR and other cytokines, including nuclear factor kappa (NFκB), Matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP-2 and -9). Meanwhile, the invasion ability of cultured HCC cell lines was performed. We found that LXR expression status in tumor samples is associated with the clinical characteristics, such as tumor stage and metastasis, of HCC patients. Prognosis analysis shows that tumor LXR expression status is closely related to the post-operative outcome in HCC patients who underwent surgical treatment. Patients with low LXR expression have a significantly lower mean 5-year overall survival rate and mean overall survival period than those with high LXR level. Our in vitro data reveal that HCC cell lines had increased NF-κB, MMP2, MMP9 and invasive ability than normal cell line, which are suppressed by LXR activation via NFκB pathway. Our data suggest that LXR could be used as a biomarker for HCC prognosis. Further study is warranted to explore the molecular mechanism under which LXR regulates tumor behaves.
Allicin, a major component of garlic, is regarded as a cardioprotective agent and is associated with increased endothelial function.
The effects of allicin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced vascular oxidative stress and inflammation in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and the mechanisms underlying these effects were studied. The protective effects were measured using cell viability, a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay and cell apoptosis as indicators, and the anti-oxidative activity was determined by measuring reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, oxidative products and endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities. HUVEC mitochondrial function was assessed by determining mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) collapse, cytochrome c production and mitochondrial ATP release. To investigate the potential underlying mechanisms, we also measured the expression of dynamic mitochondrial proteins using western blotting. Furthermore, we evaluated the Nrf2 antioxidant signaling pathway using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Our results demonstrated that allicin enhanced HUVEC proliferation, which was suppressed by LPS exposure, and LDH release. Allicin ameliorated LPS-induced apoptosis, suppressed ROS overproduction, reduced lipid peroxidation and decreased the endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities in HUVECs. These protective effects were associated with the inhibition of mitochondrial dysfunction as indicated by decreases in the MMP collapse, cytochrome c synthesis and mitochondrial ATP release. In addition, allicin attenuated the LPS-induced inflammatory responses, including endothelial cell adhesion and TNF-α and IL-8 production. Furthermore, allicin increased the expression of LXRα in a dose-dependent manner. Allicin-induced attenuation of inflammation was inhibited by LXRα siRNA treatment. Finally, allicin activated NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which controls the defense against oxidative stress and inflammation.
Taken together, the present data suggest that allicin attenuated the LPS-induced vascular injury process, which may be closely related to the oxidative stress and inflammatory response in HUVECs. Allicin modulated Nrf2 activation and protected the cells against LPS-induced vascular injury. Our findings suggest that allicin attenuated the LPS-induced inflammatory response in blood vessels.
Allicin is considered anti-atherosclerotic due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, which makes it an important drug for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis. However, the effects of allicin on foam cells are unclear. Thus, in this study, we examined the effects of allicin on lipid accumulation via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ)/liver X receptor α (LXRα) in THP‑1 macrophage-derived foam cells. THP‑1 cells were exposed to 100 nM phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) for 24 h, and then to oxydized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL; 50 mg/ml) to induce foam cell formation. The results of Oil Red O staining and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) revealed showed that pre-treatment of the foam cells with allicin decreased total cholesterol, free cholesterol (FC) and cholesterol ester levels in cells, and also decreased lipid accumulation. Moreover, allicin upregulated ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) expression and promoted cholesterol efflux. However, these effects were significantly abolished by transfection with siRNA targeting ABCA1. Furthermore, PPARγ/LXRα signaling was activated by allicin treatment. The allicin-induced upregulation of ABCA1 expression was also abolished by PPARγ inhibitor (GW9662) and siRNA or LXRα siRNA co-treatment. Overall, our data demonstrate that the allicin-induced upregulation of ABCA1 promotes cholesterol efflux and reduces lipid accumulation via PPARγ/LXRα signaling in THP‑1 macrophage-derived foam cells.
Nuclear receptors (NRs) are a class of transcription factors that regulate many cellular functions through manipulation of gene expression and also play important roles in tumorigenesis, proliferation, progression and prognosis in various kinds of cancers according to recent studies. This work aimed to determine the predictive ability of NRs in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).
A total of 308 MIBC patients with complete clinicopathological and RNASeq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort were collected for filtration. Genes showed clear correlations with overall survival (OS) and recurrence free survival (RFS) were further validated in 123 MIBC patients recruited consecutively from 2008 to 2012 in Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center (FUSCC) cohort. Cox proportional hazards regression model and Kaplan-Meier plot were used to assess the relative factors.
In TCGA cohort, we found that high NR1H3 (HR=0.779, 95% CI: 0.634 - 0.957), NR2C1 (HR=0.673, 95% CI: 0.458 - 0.989) and NR2F6 (HR=0.750, 95% CI: 0.574 - 0.980) expressions were independent factors of favorable OS, while only low NR1H3 (log-rank test, P=0.0076) and NR2F6 (log-rank test, P=0.0395) expressions had the ability to predict poor prognosis for RFS. Further, in FUSCC validating cohort, we confirmed that low NR1H3 expression level was independent factor of poor OS (HR=1.295, 95% CI: 1.064 - 1.576) and it had the ability to predict poor RFS (log-rank test, P=0.0059).
Low NR1H3 expression level is an independent prognostic factor of poor OS, and can also predict worse RFS in MIBC patients. Our "TCGA filtrating and local database validating" model can help reveal more prognostic biomarkers and cast a new light in understanding certain gene function in MIBC.
To investigate whether activation of the liver X receptors (LXRs) inhibits amyloid β1-40 (Aβ1-40) induced inflammatory and senescent responses in human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells.
Confluent cultures of human primary RPE and ARPE-19 cells pretreated with 5 μΜ of TO901317 (TO90), a synthetic agonist of LXR, or vehicle were incubated with 1 μΜ of Aβ1-40 or Aβ40-1. The optimum concentrations of Aβ1-40 and TO90 were determined by cell viability assay. Pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Expression and localization of an aging protein p16INK4a (p16) were analyzed by western blotting and immunofluorescence. Expressions of LXRs and one of their target genes ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) were examined by real-time PCR and western blotting. Phosphorylated transcription inhibition factor-κB-α (p-IκB-α) was assessed by western blotting.
A negative linear relationship between the Aβ1-40 concentration and the cell viability was evident, indicating Aβ1-40 decreased ARPE-19 cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Aβ1-40 enhanced the expression of IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 as well as p16 in both RPE cell lines at both mRNA and protein levels, whereas TO90 counteracted the detrimental effects. TO90 upregulated the expression of LXRα and its target gene ABCA1, but it did not affect the expression of LXRβ. Meanwhile, TO90 inhibited the phosphorylation of IκB-α mediated by Aβ1-40 stimulation.
Activation of the LXRα-ABCA1 axis may alleviate Aβ1-40 induced inflammatory and senescent responses in RPE cells. The beneficial effect appears associated with the inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway.
Peri-conceptional exposure to maternal obesogenic nutrition is associated with in utero programming of later-life overweight and metabolic disease in the offspring. We aimed to investigate whether dietary intervention with a modified fatty acid quality in an obesogenic high-calorie (HC) diet during the preconception and gestational phases can improve unfavourable effects of an adipogenic maternal environment. In NMRI mice, peri-conceptional and gestational obesity was induced by feeding a HC diet (controls), and they were compared with dams on a fat-modified (Fat-mod) HC diet of the same energy content but enriched with medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) and adjusted to a decreased ratio of n-6 to n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs). Effects on maternal and placental outcomes at delivery (day 17.5 post coitum) were investigated. Despite comparable energy assimilation between the two groups of dams, the altered fatty acid composition of the Fat-mod HC diet induced lower maternal body weight, weights of fat depots, adipocyte size, and hepatic fat accumulation compared to the unmodified HC diet group. Further, there was a trend towards lower fasting glucose, insulin and leptin concentrations in dams fed the Fat-mod HC diet. Phenotypic changes were accompanied by inhibition of transcript and protein expression of genes involved in hepatic de novo lipogenesis comprising PPARG2 and its target genes Fasn, Acaca, and Fabp4, whereas regulation of other lipogenic factors (Srebf1, Nr1h3, Abca1) appeared to be more complex. The modified diet led to a sex-specific placental response by upregulating PPARG-dependent fatty acid transport gene expression in female versus male placentae. Qualitative modification of the fatty acid spectrum of a high-energy maternal diet, using a combination of both MCFAs and n-3 LC-PUFAs, seems to be a promising interventional approach to ameliorate the adipogenic milieu of mice before and during gestation.
16-Dehydropregnenolone (DHP) has been developed and patented as a promising antihyperlipidemic agent by CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute (CSIR-CDRI), India. Although DHP is implicated in controlling cholesterol homeostasis, the mechanism underlying its pharmacological effect in hyperlipidemic disease models is poorly understood. In the present study, we postulated that DHP lowers serum lipids through regulating the key hepatic genes accountable for cholesterol metabolism. The hypothesis was tested on golden Syrian hamsters fed with high-fat diet (HFD) following oral administration of DHP at a dose of 72mg/kg body weight for a period of one week. The serum total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and total bile acids (TBA) in feces were measured. Real time comparative gene expression studies were performed for CYP7A1, LXRα and PPARα level in liver tissue of hamsters. The results revealed that the DHP profoundly decreased the levels of serum TC, TG, LDL-C and atherogenic index (AI), whilst elevated the HDL-C/TC ratio. Besides, DHP exhibited an anti-hyperlipidemic effect in the HFD induced hyperlipidemic hamsters by means of: (1) up-regulating the gene expression of CYP7A1 encoded cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, that promotes the catabolism of cholesterol to bile acid; (2) inducing the gene expression of transcription factors LXRα and PPARα; (3) increasing the TBA excretion through feces. Collectively, the findings presented confer the hypolipidemic activity of DHP via up-regulation of hepatic CYP7A1 pathway that promotes cholesterol-to-bile acid conversion and bile acid excretion.
Aging is associated with increased levels of circulating inflammatory markers and reduced muscle mass and strength.
We investigated whether intake of protein-enriched milk for 12 weeks would influence markers of inflammation among adults ≥70years of age with reduced physical strength.
In a double-blind randomized controlled intervention study, subjects were randomly allocated into two groups, receiving a protein-enriched milk (2×20g protein/d, n=14, mean (±SD) age 76.9±4.9 yrs) or an isocaloric carbohydrate drink (n=17, age 77.7±4.8 yrs) for 12 weeks. We measured serum and mRNA expression levels of inflammatory markers in PBMCs.
Significant differences in the mRNA expression of nuclear receptor subfamily, group H, member 3 (NR1H3, encoding the LXRα transcription factor) and interferon gamma (INFG) were observed between groups. The mRNA level of TNFRSF1A was significantly reduced, while the mRNA level of dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4) was significantly increased, in the control group. The serum level of TNFα increased significantly in the control group, while sTNFRSF1A increased significantly in both groups, but with no significant differences between groups.
Consumption of a low-fat, protein-enriched milk for 12 weeks had minor effects on inflammatory related markers in older adults compared to an isocaloric carbohydrate drink.
The adipokine adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (A-FABP) has been implicated in obesity-related cardio-metabolic complications. Here we show that A-FABP increases thermogenesis by promoting the conversion of T4 to T3 in brown adipocytes. We find that A-FABP levels are increased in both white (WAT) and brown (BAT) adipose tissues and the bloodstream in response to thermogenic stimuli. A-FABP knockout mice have reduced thermogenesis and whole-body energy expenditure after cold stress or after feeding a high-fat diet, which can be reversed by infusion of recombinant A-FABP. Mechanistically, A-FABP induces the expression of type-II iodothyronine deiodinase in BAT via inhibition of the nuclear receptor liver X receptor α, thereby leading to the conversion of thyroid hormone from its inactive form T4 to active T3. The thermogenic responses to T4 are abrogated in A-FABP KO mice, but enhanced by A-FABP. Thus, A-FABP acts as a physiological stimulator of BAT-mediated adaptive thermogenesis.
Maternal undernutrition programs fetal energy homeostasis and increases the risk of metabolic disorders later in life. This study aimed to identify the signs of hepatic metabolic programming in utero and during the juvenile phase after intrauterine undernutrition during midgestation.
Fifty-three pregnant goats were assigned to the control (100% of the maintenance requirement) or restricted (60% of the maintenance requirement from day 45 to day 100 of midgestation and realimentation thereafter) group to compare hepatic energy metabolism in the fetuses (day 100 of gestation) and kids (postnatal day 90).
Undernutrition increased the glucagon concentration and hepatic hexokinase activity, decreased the body weight, liver weight and hepatic expression of G6PC, G6PD, and PGC1α mRNAs, and tended to decrease the hepatic glycogen content and ACOX1 mRNA level in the dams. Maternal undernutrition decreased the growth hormone (GH) and triglyceride concentrations, tended to decrease the body weight and hepatic hexokinase activity, increased the hepatic PCK1, PCK2 and PRKAA2 mRNAs levels and glucose-6-phosphatase activity, and tended to increase the hepatic PRKAB1 and CPT1α mRNAs levels in the male fetuses. In the restricted female fetuses, the hepatic hexokinase activity and G6PC mRNA level tended to be increased, but PKB1 mRNA expression was decreased and the ACACA, CPT1α, NR1H3 and STK11 mRNA levels tended to be decreased. Maternal undernutrition changed the hepatic metabolic profile and affected the metabolic pathway involved in amino acid, glycerophospholipid, bile acid, purine, and saccharide metabolism in the fetuses, but not the kids. Additionally, maternal undernutrition increased the concentrations of GH and cortisol, elevated the hepatic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, and tended to decrease the hepatic glycogen content in the male kids. No alterations in these variables were observed in the female kids.
Maternal undernutrition affects the metabolic status in a sex- and stage-specific manner by changing the metabolic profile, expression of genes involved in glucose homeostasis and enzyme activities in the liver of the fetuses. The changes in the hormone levels in the male fetuses and kids, but not the female offspring, represent a potential sign of metabolic programming.
Total flavones of Epimedium (TFE) is the main active ingredient in Herba Epimedii, which is a well-known Chinese herbal medicine that is widely used to treat certain age-related diseases in oriental countries.
The aim of this work was to investigate the anti-aging properties of TFE related to lipid metabolism.
Both transcriptomics and metabonomics were applied in this work to investigate the anti-aging properties of TFE. Microarray and LC-MS analysis were conducted on liver samples of three groups of rats, including young (4 months), old (24 months), and old rats administrated TFE.
Transcriptomics analysis highlighted 287 transcripts related to the anti-aging effect of TFE, in which the expression ratio of 18 genes regulating lipid metabolism, including HMGCS1 and NR1H3, returned to normal levels after TFE treatment. In addition, 24 aging-related metabolites were discovered in a metabonomics study, and 15 of these were structurally identified, including palmitic amide, linoleamide, and oleamide. Bioinformatics and integral data analysis on the results of the transcriptomics and metabonomics suggest the involvement of 12 key metabolic pathways, half of which are highly related to lipid metabolism.
This study demonstrates that the role played by TFE in the lipid metabolism of aging rats is multifaceted and multi-layered.
Abruptio placentae is a complex multifactorial disease that is associated with maternal and neonatal death and morbidity. Abruptio placentae's high recurrence rate, high prevalence of heritable thrombophilia among women with abruptio placentae, and aggregation of cases in families of women with the disease support the possibility of a genetic predisposition. Previous genome-wide and candidate gene association studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation genes that potentially are associated with abruptio placentae risk. Perturbations in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation, which results in mitochondrial dysfunction, can lead to the impairment of differentiation and invasion of the trophoblast and to several obstetrics complications that include abruptio placentae.
The purpose of this study was to determine whether the results of a candidate genetic association study that indicated a link between DNA variants (implicated in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation) and abruptio placentae could be replicated.
The study was conducted among participants (507 abruptio placentae cases and 1090 control subjects) of the Placental Abruption Genetic Epidemiology study. Weighted genetic risk scores were calculated with the use of abruptio placentae risk-increasing alleles of 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 9 mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation genes (CAMK2B, NR1H3, PPARG, PRKCA, THRB, COX5A, NDUFA10, NDUFA12, and NDUFC2), which previously was reported in the Peruvian Abruptio Placentae Epidemiology study, a study with similar design and study population to the Placental Abruption Genetic Epidemiology study. Logistic regression models were fit to examine associations of weighted genetic risk scores (quartile 1, &lt;25th percentile; quartile 2, 25-50th percentile; quartile 3, 50-70th percentile, and quartile 4, &gt;75th percentile) with risk of abruptio placentae, adjusted for population admixture (the first 4 principal components), maternal age, infant sex, and preeclampsia. The weighted genetic risk score was also modeled as a continuous predictor. To assess potential effect modification, analyses were repeated among strata that were defined by preeclampsia status, maternal age (≥35 vs 18-34 years), and infant sex.
Abruptio placentae cases were more likely to have preeclampsia, shorter gestational age, and lower infant birthweight. Participants in quartile 2 (score, 12.6-13.8), quartile 3 (score, 13.9-15.0) and quartile 4 (score, ≥15.1) had a genetic risk score of 1.45-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.04-2.02; P=.03), a 1.42-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.98; P=.04), and a 1.75-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.27-2.42; P=7.0E-04) higher odds of abruptio placentae, respectively, compared with those in quartile 1 (score,&lt;12.6; P-for trend=.0003). The risk of abruptio placentae was 1.12-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.19; P=3.0×1004) higher per 1-unit increase in the score. Among women with preeclampsia, those in quartile 4 had a 3.92-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.48-10.36; P=.01) higher odds of abruptio placentae compared with women in quartile 1. Among normotensive women, women in quartile 4 had a 1.57-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.11-2.21; P=.01) higher odds of abruptio placentae compared with those in quartile 1 (P-for interaction=.12). We did not observe differences in associations among strata defined by maternal age or infant sex.
In this study, we replicated previous findings and provide strong evidence for DNA variants that encode for genes that are involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation pathways, which confers risk for abruptio placentae. These results shed light on the mechanisms that implicate DNA variants that encode for proteins in mitochondrial function that are responsible for abruptio placentae risk. Therapeutic efforts to reduce risk of abruptio placentae can be enhanced by improved biologic understanding of maternal mitochondrial biogenesis/oxidative phosphorylation pathways and identification of women who would be at high risk for abruptio placentae.
A recent study analyzed 2053 multiple sclerosis (MS) cases and 799 healthy controls to investigate whether five genetic variants (rs11039149, rs12221497, rs2279238, rs7120118 and rs7114704) in NR1H3 are associated with MS risk. However this study reported negative results. It is very important that the appropriate samples and approach should be used in replication studies, which may provide the correct interpretation of the results. Here, we evaluated the above findings using large-scale MS genome-wide association studies with a total of 27,148 samples including 9772 MS cases and 17,376 controls, and multiple expression quantitative trait loci datasets. The results suggest that rs7120118 and rs2279238 variants are significantly associated with MS risk, and could significantly regulate NR1H3 expression in kinds of human tissues and cells. In summary, these findings provide important supplementary information about the association between NR1H3 variants and MS risk.
Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a significant risk factor for glaucoma, the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. While previous studies have identified numerous genetic variants associated with IOP, these loci only explain a fraction of IOP heritability. Recently established of biobank repositories have resulted in large amounts of data, enabling the identification of the remaining heritability for complex traits. Here, we describe the largest genome-wide association study of IOP to date using participants of European ancestry from the UK Biobank. We identified 671 directly genotyped variants that are significantly associated with IOP (P &lt; 5 × 10-8). In addition to 103 novel loci, the top ranked novel IOP genes are LMX1B, NR1H3, MADD and SEPT9. We replicated these findings in an external population and examined the pleiotropic nature of these loci. These discoveries not only further our understanding of the genetic architecture of IOP, but also shed new light on the biological processes underlying glaucoma.
Because the cost of cereals is unstable and represents a large part of production charges for meat-type chicken, there is an urge to formulate alternative diets from more cost-effective feedstuff. We have recently shown that meat-type chicken source is prone to adapt to dietary starch substitution with fat and fiber. The aim of this study was to better understand the molecular mechanisms of this adaptation to changes in dietary energy sources through the fine characterization of transcriptomic changes occurring in three major metabolic tissues - liver, adipose tissue and muscle - as well as in circulating blood cells.
We revealed the fine-tuned regulation of many hepatic genes encoding key enzymes driving glycogenesis and de novo fatty acid synthesis pathways and of some genes participating in oxidation. Among the genes expressed upon consumption of a high-fat, high-fiber diet, we highlighted CPT1A, which encodes a key enzyme in the regulation of fatty acid oxidation. Conversely, the repression of lipogenic genes by the high-fat diet was clearly associated with the down-regulation of SREBF1 transcripts but was not associated with the transcript regulation of MLXIPL and NR1H3, which are both transcription factors. This result suggests a pivotal role for SREBF1 in lipogenesis regulation in response to a decrease in dietary starch and an increase in dietary PUFA. Other prospective regulators of de novo hepatic lipogenesis were suggested, such as PPARD, JUN, TADA2A and KAT2B, the last two genes belonging to the lysine acetyl transferase (KAT) complex family regulating histone and non-histone protein acetylation. Hepatic glycogenic genes were also down-regulated in chickens fed a high-fat, high-fiber diet compared to those in chickens fed a starch-based diet. No significant dietary-associated variations in gene expression profiles was observed in the other studied tissues, suggesting that the liver mainly contributed to the adaptation of birds to changes in energy source and nutrients in their diets, at least at the transcriptional level. Moreover, we showed that PUFA deposition observed in the different tissues may not rely on transcriptional changes.
We showed the major role of the liver, at the gene expression level, in the adaptive response of chicken to dietary starch substitution with fat and fiber.
Apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) is the main structural and functional protein component of high-density lipoprotein. ApoA-I has been shown to regulate lipid metabolism and inflammation in macrophages. Recently, we found the moderate expression of endogenous apoA-I in human monocytes and macrophages and showed that pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) increases apoA-I mRNA and stimulates ApoA-I protein secretion by human monocytes and macrophages. Here, we present data about molecular mechanisms responsible for the TNFα-mediated activation of apoA-I gene in human monocytes and macrophages. This activation depends on JNK and MEK1/2 signaling pathways in human monocytes, whereas inhibition of NFκB, JNK, or p38 blocks an increase of apoA-I gene expression in the macrophages treated with TNFα. Nuclear receptor PPARα is a ligand-dependent regulator of apoA-I gene, whereas LXRs stimulate apoA-I mRNA transcription and ApoA-I protein synthesis and secretion by macrophages. Treatment of human macrophages with PPARα or LXR synthetic ligands as well as knock-down of LXRα, and LXRβ by siRNAs interfered with the TNFα-mediated activation of apoA-I gene in human monocytes and macrophages. At the same time, TNFα differently regulated the levels of PPARα, LXRα, and LXRβ binding to the apoA-I gene promoter in THP-1 cells. Obtained results suggest a novel tissue-specific mechanism of the TNFα-mediated regulation of apoA-I gene in monocytes and macrophages and show that endogenous ApoA-I might be positively regulated in macrophage during inflammation.
Outpatients with tracheostomy can be managed with a low risk for severe airways infections despite colonization with pathogenic bacteria. No studies have been focused on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a condition known for recurrent exacerbations. The aim of our study was to verify whether at follow-up in tracheostomized COPD versus other disease outpatients, persistent P. aeruginosa colonization may influence the rate and treatment of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) or hospital admissions. Thirty-nine outpatients were considered: 24 were affected by COPD (age 66, 54-78 years, mean, range), 15 by restrictive lung disease (RLD) (57, 41-72 years). During an 18-month follow-up the number of LRTIs were recorded. Bacterial identifications were assessed at baseline and every month for 6 months in bronchial aspirates. The number of LRTI per patient was not significantly different between COPD [37, 1(0-6)] and RLD [18, 1(0-5)], [total, median (range)]. Persistent P. aeruginosa colonized 18 COPD (75%), 12 RLD patients (86%) and was not associated with an increased number of LRTI: 1(0-6) and 1(0-2), respectively. There were no differences in the number of hospital admissions: COPD 0(0-2), RLD 1(0-1), with a significant decrease versus before tracheostomy (P &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, the rate of LRTI and hospital admissions in COPD outpatients with chronic tracheostomy was low, similar to non-COPD patients and independent of P. aeruginosa colonization.
To assess the effects of flax addition and flax processing on feedlot performance and carcass characteristics, 128 yearling beef heifers (360 +/- 14 kg of initial BW) were blocked by weight and assigned randomly to feedlot diets that included no flax (control), whole flax (WHL), rolled flax (RLD; 1,300 microm), or ground flax (GRD; 700 microm). Heifers were fed a growth diet (31% corn, 30% corn silage, 18% barley malt pellets, 14% alfalfa, 4% linseed meal, and 3% supplement; DM basis) for 56 d, after which they were adapted to a finishing diet (79% corn, 7% corn silage, 7% alfalfa, 4.75% linseed meal, and 2.25% supplement; DM basis). In WHL, RLD, and GRD, flax replaced all linseed meal and partially replaced corn at 8% of diet DM. All diets provided 0.5 mg of melengestrol acetate, 2,000 IU of vitamin E, and 232 mg of monensin per heifer daily. Cattle were slaughtered by block after 96, 97, and 124 (2 blocks) d on feed. At 24 h postmortem, carcass data were collected, and a portion of the loin was removed, vacuum-packaged, and aged for 14 d. After aging, 2 steaks were removed from each loin for Warner-Bratzler shear force measurement, sensory panel evaluation, and fatty acid analysis (approximately 100 g of muscle was collected). Flax inclusion (WHL, RLD, and GRD vs. control) did not affect DMI (P = 0.79), fat thickness over the 12th rib (P = 0.32), or LM area (P = 0.23). Flax inclusion increased ADG (P = 0.006), G:F (P = 0.006), and USDA yield grade (P = 0.01). Flax processing (RLD and GRD vs. WHL) increased ADG (P = 0.05), G:F (P = 0.08), and apparent dietary NEm and NEg (P = 0.003). Muscle from heifers fed flax had greater phospholipid 18:3n-3 (P &lt; 0.001), 20:5n-3 (P &lt; 0.001), 22:5n-3 (P &lt; 0.001), and 22:6n-3 (P = 0.02) fractions, and greater neutral lipid 18:3n-3 (P &lt; 0.001). Feeding 8% flax to feedlot heifers increased gain and efficiency, and processing flax increased available energy and resulted in increased efficiency of gain. Feeding 8% flax also increased levels of n-3 fatty acids in fresh beef.
The steroid/hormone nuclear receptor superfamily comprises several subfamilies of receptors that interact with overlapping DNA sequences and/or related ligands. The thyroid/retinoid hormone receptor subfamily has recently attracted much interest because of the complex network of its receptor interactions. The retinoid X receptors (RXRs), for instance, play a very central role in this subfamily, forming heterodimers with several receptors. Here we describe a novel member of this subfamily that interacts with RXR. Using a v-erbA probe, we obtained a cDNA which encodes a novel 445-amino-acid protein, RLD-1, that contains the characteristic domains of nuclear receptors. Northern (RNA) blot analysis showed that in mature rats, the receptor is highly expressed in spleen, pituitary, lung, liver, and fat. In addition, weaker expression is observed in several other tissues. Amino acid sequence alignment and DNA-binding data revealed that the DNA-binding domain of the new receptor is related to that of the thyroid/retinoid subgroup of nuclear receptors. RLD-1 preferentially binds as a heterodimer with RXR to a direct repeat of the half-site sequence 5'-G/AGGTCA-3', separated by four nucleotides (DR-4). Surprisingly, this binding is dependent to a high degree on the nature of the spacing nucleotides. None of the known nuclear receptor ligands activated RLD-1. In contrast, a DR-4-dependent constitutive transcriptional activation of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene by the RLD-1/RXR alpha heterodimer was observed. Our data suggest a highly specific role for this novel receptor within the network of gene regulation by the thyroid/retinoid receptor subfamily.
Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) to Rauscher murine leukaemia virus (R-MuLV) encoded or induced determinants was induced in mice by three syngeneic R-MuLV-induced tumour cell lines, i.e. a myeloid tumour, RMB-1, an erythroid tumour, RED-1, and a lymphoid tumour, RLD-1. DTH to subcutaneously (s.c.) administered RMB-1 cells appeared on day 4, with a maximum DTH response on day 6 or 7. The induction of DTH could be prevented by intravenous (i.v.) pre-immunisation with R-MuLV-induced tumour cells several days before the s.c. immunisation. The three R-MuLV-induced tumour cell lines showed cross-reactivity in the DTH assay, whereas no cross-reactivity was found with syngeneic WEHI-3 cells. This indicates that the three R-MuLV-induced tumour cell lines share a virally encoded or induced antigenic determinant, which activates T-cells. When the RMB-1 cells used for immunisation had been cultured in medium supplemented with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), the subsequent DTH response was increased. This coincided with an increased expression of the R-MuLV-specific antigenic determinants on RMB-1 cells as demonstrated by Scatchard analysis. Furthermore, IFN-gamma increased the MHC class I antigen expression on RMB-1 cells, whereas the class II antigen expression remained undetectable.
RLD-1 and OR-1 are closely related orphan nuclear receptors that can be activated by certain oxysterols. To obtain cells stably expressing RLD-1 or OR-1, CHOK1 cells were successively transfected with a DGRE2-ALP reporter and GR-RLD-1 or GR-OR-1 chimeric constructs. The selected cell clones that showed low background activity of the reporter and maximum fold induction by 22R(OH)cholesterol were used for subsequent experiments. Treatment of the cells with PGE2, TPA, or 8-bromo-cAMP alone did not transactivate the reporter. However, the induction of the reporter by 22R(OH)cholesterol was markedly enhanced in the presence of PGE2, TPA, 8-bromo-cAMP, or forskolin in cells expressing GR-RLD-1. The enhancement was inhibited by H-89 and bisindolylmaleimide, both inhibitors of protein kinases. These results suggest that transactivation by ligand-activated RLD-1 may be further modulated/regulated through other signal transduction pathways involving phosphorylation catalyzed by protein kinases.
Reduced growth and viability is a common phenotype of plants with constitutively activated pathogen defenses. One branch of the plant innate immunity system, effector-triggered immunity, is especially potent and requires tight control to enable normal plant development. While some facets of this control that directly regulate resistance protein abundance or activity have been documented, general control of effector-triggered signaling sensitivity is poorly understood. We recently identified SUPPRESSOR OF rps4-RLD 1 (SRFR1), a novel negative regulator of avrRps4-triggered immunity. Mutations in SRFR1 were previously shown not to induce constitutive high expression of the defense gene PR1, and to be fully susceptible to the virulent Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000. SRFR1 encodes a tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein with weak similarity to transcriptional repressors in other organisms. By transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana, SRFR1 was localized to the nucleus. Here we investigate more carefully whether expression of defense genes is misregulated in srfr1 mutant plants. Consistent with the hypothesized function of SRFR1 as a negative transcriptional regulator, we find that mRNA levels of several defense genes are upregulated in srfr1 mutants.
Effector-triggered immunity provides plants with strong protection from pathogens. However, this response has the potential to be highly deleterious to the host and needs to be tightly controlled. The molecular mechanisms in the plant that regulate the balance between activation and suppression of resistance are not fully understood. Previously, we identified Arabidopsis suppressor of rps4-RLD 1 (srfr1) mutants with enhanced resistance to the bacterial effector AvrRps4. These mutants were recessive and retained full susceptibility to virulent bacteria, suggesting that SRFR1 functions as a negative regulator and that AvrRps4-triggered immunity was specifically enhanced in the mutants. Consistent with this, we show here that the response to flagellin, an elicitor of basal resistance, is unaltered in srfr1-1. In contrast, resistance to AvrRps4 in srfr1-1 requires EDS1, a central regulator of effector-triggered immunity via multiple resistance genes. SRFR1 is a single-copy gene encoding a pioneer tetratricopeptide repeat protein conserved between plants and animals. The SRFR1 tetratricopeptide repeat domain shows sequence similarity to those of transcriptional repressors in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans. Indeed, a sub-pool of SRFR1 transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaf cells localizes to the nucleus. Identification of SRFR1 may therefore provide insight into the regulation of the transcriptional reprogramming that is activated by effector-triggered immunity.
A phenanthrene- and citronellol-degrading bacterium, strain RLD-1(T), was isolated from the fly ash dumping site of a thermal power plant in Delhi, India. The 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that this strain belongs to the genus Pseudomonas; high levels of sequence similarity were found with respect to Pseudomonas citronellolis DSM 50332(T) (98.9 %), Pseudomonas jinjuensis DSM 16612(T) (97.6 %) and Pseudomonas nitroreducens DSM 14399(T) (97.5 %). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences placed the strain within the clade represented by these three strains. Strain RLD-1(T) showed low levels of DNA-DNA hybridization with respect to P. citronellolis DSM 50332(T) (36 %), P. jinjuensis DSM 16612(T) (4 %) and P. nitroreducens (13.7 %). Strain RLD-1(T) can also be distinguished from these three strains on the basis of several biochemical and physiological attributes. The novel strain contained high levels of cellular fatty acids 18 : 1omega7c, 16 : 0 and 16 : 1omega7c, along with 10 : 0 3-OH and 12 : 0 3-OH. Thus, strain RLD-1(T) represents a novel species of the genus Pseudomonas, for which the name Pseudomonas delhiensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is RLD-1(T) (=MTCC 7601(T)=CCM 7361(T)).
No prospective study has investigated whether individuals with respiratory impairments, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and restrictive lung disease (RLD), are at increased risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). We aimed to prospectively investigate whether those respiratory impairments are associated with increased AAA risk.
In 1987-1989, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study followed 14,269 participants aged 45-64 years, without a history of AAA surgery, through 2011. Participants were classified into four groups, "COPD" [forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) &lt;lower limit of normal (LLN)], "RLD" (FEV1/FVC ≥ LLN and FVC &lt; LLN), "respiratory symptoms with normal spirometry" (without RLD or COPD), and "normal" (without respiratory symptoms, RLD or COPD, reference group).
During the 284,969 person-years of follow-up, 534 incident AAA events were documented. In an age, sex, and race-adjusted proportional hazards model, individuals with respiratory impairments had a significantly higher risk of AAA than the normal reference group. After adjustment for AAA risk factors, including smoking status and pack-years of smoking, AAA risk was no longer significant in the respiratory symptoms with normal spirometry group [HR (95% CI), 1.25 (0.98-1.60)], but was still increased in the other two groups [RLD: 1.45 (1.04-2.02) and COPD: 1.66 (1.34-2.05)]. Moreover, continuous measures of FEV1/FVC, FEV1 and FVC were associated inversely with risk of AAA.
In the prospective population-based cohort study, obstructive and restrictive spirometric patterns were associated with increased risk of AAA independent of smoking, suggesting that COPD and RLD may increase the risk of AAA.
Repeat sequences are involved in regulation of gene expression both at the transcriptional and translational level. In the mammalian genomes, tri- and tetranucleotide repeats like ATA, AATA, GGAA and GAAA have been associated with diseases. In silico analysis of (GGAA)5 distribution across the species showed maximum number of this repeat in the mouse transcriptome compared to that in other species. Following this, we conducted minisatellite associated sequence amplification (MASA) to explore the buffalo's transcriptome using cDNA from different tissues and an oligo based on (GGAA)5 repeats. MASA uncovered twenty six mRNA transcripts showing homology to known genes in the database. qPCR studies showed the highest expression of twelve transcripts in the spleen. A transcript, pLRC107 with its partial sequence of 203 nucleotides showed sequence variation at several positions in spleen as compared to other four tissues examined. Transcript pLRC100 was found to represent the partial coding sequence of Bos taurus HECT {(homologous to E6-associated protein (UBE3A) carboxyl-terminus domain) and RCC1 (CHC1)-like domain (RLD) 1}, mRNA. We ascertained full length coding sequence of HECT gene and localized the same on buffalo chromosome 10 employing FISH. This gene was found to be conserved across the species. Another gene LRP8 uncovered in the process showed copy number variation between buffalo males (4-9) and females (34-54). The MASA approach enabled us to identify several genes in Bubalus bubalis without screening an entire cDNA library. The highest expression of 12 mRNA transcripts in spleen suggests their likely involvement with immuno transaction. A comprehensive knowledge of the repeat tagged transcriptomes is envisaged to help in understanding their significance in genome organization and evolution forming rich basis of functional and comparative genomics.
Most common diseases are attributed to multiple genetic variants, and the feasibility of identifying inherited risk factors is often restricted to the identification of alleles with high or intermediate effect sizes. In our previous studies, we identified single loci associated with hepatic fibrosis (Hfib1-Hfib4). Recent advances in analysis tools allowed us to model loci interactions for liver fibrosis. We analysed 322 F2 progeny from an intercross of the fibrosis-susceptible strain BALB/cJ and the resistant strain FVB/NJ. The mice were challenged with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) for 6 weeks to induce chronic hepatic injury and fibrosis. Fibrosis progression was quantified by determining histological fibrosis stages and hepatic collagen contents. Phenotypic data were correlated to genome-wide markers to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL). Thirteen susceptibility loci were identified by single and composite interval mapping, and were included in the subsequent multiple QTL model (MQM) testing. Models provided evidence for susceptibility loci with strongest association to collagen contents (chromosomes 1, 2, 8 and 13) or fibrosis stages (chromosomes 1, 2, 12 and 14). These loci contained the known fibrosis risk genes Hc, Fasl and Foxa2 and were incorporated in a fibrosis network. Interestingly the hepatic fibrosis locus on chromosome 1 (Hfib5) connects both phenotype networks, strengthening its role as a potential modifier locus. Including multiple QTL mapping to association studies adds valuable information on gene-gene interactions in experimental crosses and human cohorts. This study presents an initial step towards a refined understanding of profibrogenic gene networks. 
Glomerular disease often features altered histologic patterns of extracellular matrix (ECM). Despite this, the potential complexities of the glomerular ECM in both health and disease are poorly understood. To explore whether genetic background and sex determine glomerular ECM composition, we investigated two mouse strains, FVB and B6, using RNA microarrays of isolated glomeruli combined with proteomic glomerular ECM analyses. These studies, undertaken in healthy young adult animals, revealed unique strain- and sex-dependent glomerular ECM signatures, which correlated with variations in levels of albuminuria and known predisposition to progressive nephropathy. Among the variation, we observed changes in netrin 4, fibroblast growth factor 2, tenascin C, collagen 1, meprin 1-α, and meprin 1-β. Differences in protein abundance were validated by quantitative immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis, and the collective differences were not explained by mutations in known ECM or glomerular disease genes. Within the distinct signatures, we discovered a core set of structural ECM proteins that form multiple protein-protein interactions and are conserved from mouse to man. Furthermore, we found striking ultrastructural changes in glomerular basement membranes in FVB mice. Pathway analysis of merged transcriptomic and proteomic datasets identified potential ECM regulatory pathways involving inhibition of matrix metalloproteases, liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, notch, and cyclin-dependent kinase 5. These pathways may therefore alter ECM and confer susceptibility to disease. 
In atherosclerotic plaques, iron preferentially accumulates in macrophages where it can exert pro-oxidant activities.
The objective of this study was, first, to better characterize the iron distribution and metabolism in macrophage subpopulations in human atherosclerotic plaques and, second, to determine whether iron homeostasis is under the control of nuclear receptors, such as the liver X receptors (LXRs).
Here we report that iron depots accumulate in human atherosclerotic plaque areas enriched in CD68 and mannose receptor (MR)-positive (CD68(+)MR(+)) alternative M2 macrophages. In vitro IL-4 polarization of human monocytes into M2 macrophages also resulted in a gene expression profile and phenotype favoring iron accumulation. However, M2 macrophages on iron exposure acquire a phenotype favoring iron release, through a strong increase in ferroportin expression, illustrated by a more avid oxidation of extracellular low-density lipoprotein by iron-loaded M2 macrophages. In line, in human atherosclerotic plaques, CD68(+)MR(+) macrophages accumulate oxidized lipids, which activate LXRα and LXRβ, resulting in the induction of ABCA1, ABCG1, and apolipoprotein E expression. Moreover, in iron-loaded M2 macrophages, LXR activation induces nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2 expression, thereby increasing ferroportin expression, which, together with a decrease of hepcidin mRNA levels, promotes iron export.
These data identify a role for M2 macrophages in iron handling, a process regulated by LXR activation.
The nuclear receptor liver X receptor-α (LXRα) stimulates lipogenesis, leading to steatosis. Nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) contributes to cellular defense mechanism by upregulating antioxidant genes, and may protect the liver from injury inflicted by fat accumulation. However, whether Nrf2 affects LXRα activity is unknown. This study investigated the inhibitory role of Nrf2 in hepatic LXRα activity and the molecular basis.
A deficiency of Nrf2 enhanced the ability of LXRα agonist to promote hepatic steatosis, as mediated by lipogenic gene induction. In hepatocytes, Nrf2 overexpression repressed gene transactivation by LXR-binding site activation. Consistently, treatment of mice with sulforaphane (an Nrf2 activator) suppressed T0901317-induced lipogenesis, as confirmed by the experiments using hepatocytes. Nrf2 activation promoted deacetylation of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) by competing for p300, leading to FXR-dependent induction of small heterodimer partner (SHP), which was responsible for the repression of LXRα-dependent gene transcription. In human steatotic samples, the transcript levels of LXRα and SREBP-1 inversely correlated with those of Nrf2, FXR, and SHP.
Our findings offer the mechanism to explain how decrease in Nrf2 activity in hepatic steatosis could contribute to the progression of NAFLD, providing the use of Nrf2 as a molecular biomarker to diagnose NAFLD. As certain antioxidants have the abilities to activate Nrf2, clinicians might utilize the activators of Nrf2 as a new therapeutic approach to prevent and/or treat NAFLD.
Nrf2 activation inhibits LXRα activity and LXRα-dependent liver steatosis by competing with FXR for p300, causing FXR activation and FXR-mediated SHP induction. Our findings provide important information on a strategy to prevent and/or treat steatosis.
Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) is a nuclear transcription factor mainly expressed in the liver, intestine, kidney, and pancreas. Many of its hepatic and pancreatic functions have been described, but limited information is available on its role in the gastrointestinal tract. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant functions of HNF4α as well as its implication in intestinal lipid transport and metabolism. To this end, the HNF4A gene was knocked down by transfecting Caco-2 cells with a pGFP-V-RS lentiviral vector containing an shRNA against HNF4α. Inactivation of HNF4α in Caco-2 cells resulted in the following: (a) an increase in oxidative stress as demonstrated by the levels of malondialdehyde and conjugated dienes; (b) a reduction in secondary endogenous antioxidants (catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and heme oxygenase-1); (c) a lower protein expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor that controls the antioxidant response elements-regulated antioxidant enzymes; (d) an accentuation of cellular inflammatory activation as shown by levels of nuclear factor-κB, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and leukotriene B4; (e) a decrease in the output of high density lipoproteins and of their anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative components apolipoproteins (apo) A-I and A-IV; (f) a diminution in cellular lipid transport revealed by a lower cellular secretion of chylomicrons and their apoB-48 moiety; and (g) alterations in the transcription factors sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α, and liver X receptor α and β. In conclusion, HNF4α appears to play a key role in intestinal lipid metabolism as well as intestinal anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory defense mechanisms.
Reactive oxygen species, when released under controlled conditions and limited amounts, contribute to cellular proliferation, senescence, and survival by acting as signaling intermediates. In past decades there has been an epidemic diffusion of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that represents the result of the impairment of lipid metabolism, redox imbalance, and insulin resistance in the liver. To date, most studies and reviews have been focused on the molecular mechanisms by which fatty liver progresses to steatohepatitis, but the processes leading toward the development of hepatic steatosis in NAFLD are not fully understood yet. Several nuclear receptors, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) α/γ/δ, PPARγ coactivators 1α and 1β, sterol-regulatory element-binding proteins, AMP-activated protein kinase, liver-X-receptors, and farnesoid-X-receptor, play key roles in the regulation of lipid homeostasis during the pathogenesis of NAFLD. These nuclear receptors may act as redox sensors and may modulate various metabolic pathways in response to specific molecules that act as ligands. It is conceivable that a redox-dependent modulation of lipid metabolism, nuclear receptor-mediated, could cause the development of hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. Thus, this network may represent a potential therapeutic target for the treatment and prevention of hepatic steatosis and its progression to steatohepatitis. This review summarizes the redox-dependent factors that contribute to metabolism alterations in fatty liver with a focus on the redox control of nuclear receptors in normal liver as well as in NAFLD. 
Liver injury and regeneration involve complicated processes and are affected by various physio-pathological conditions. Surgically, severe liver injury after surgical resection often leads to fatal liver failure, especially with some underlying pathological conditions such as steatosis. Therefore, protection from the injury of hepatocytes and liver is a serious concern in various clinical settings.
We studied the effects of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) on cell survival and steatosis in mouse hepatocytes (AML12 mouse liver cells) and investigated their molecular mechanisms. We next studied whether or not FXR improves liver injury, regeneration and steatosis in a mouse model of partial hepatectomy (PH) with steatosis.
An FXR-specific agonist, GW4064, induced expressions of the p62/SQSTM1 gene and protein in AML12 mouse liver cells. Because we previously reported p62/SQSTM1 as a key molecule for antioxidation and cell survival in hepatocytes, we next examined the activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) and induction of the antioxidant molecules by GW4064. GW4064 activated Nrf2 and subsequently induced antioxidant molecules (Nrf2, catalase, HO-1, and thioredoxin). We also examined expressions of pro-survival and cell protective molecules associated with p62/SQSTM1. Expectedly, GW4064 induced phosphorylation of Akt, expression of the anti-apoptotic molecules (Bcl-xL and Bcl-2), and reduced harmful hepatic molecules (Fas ligand and Fas). GW4064 promoted hepatocyte survival, which was cancelled by p62/SQSTM1 siRNA. These findings suggest the potential relevance of the FXR-p62/SQSTM1 pathway for the survival and protection of hepatocytes. Furthermore, GW4064 induced the expression of small heterodimer partners (SHP) and suppressed liver X receptor (LXR)-induced steatosis in hepatocytes, expecting the in vivo protective effect of FXR on liver injury especially with steatosis. In the hepatectomy model of db/db mice with fatty liver, pre-treatment by GW4064 significantly reduced post-PH liver injury (serum levels of LDH, AST &amp; ALT and histological study) and improved steatosis. The key molecules, p62/SQSTM1, Nrf2 and SHP were upregulated in fatty liver tissue by GW4064 treatment.
The present study is the first to demonstrate the relevance of FXR-p62/SQSTM1 and -SHP in the protection against injury of hepatocytes and post-PH liver, especially with steatosis.
A long-standing paradox in the pathophysiology of metabolic diseases is the selective insulin resistance of the liver. It is characterized by a blunted action of insulin to reduce glucose production, contributing to hyperglycemia, while de novo lipogenesis remains insulin sensitive, participating in turn to hepatic steatosis onset. The underlying molecular bases of this conundrum are not yet fully understood. Here, we established a model of selective insulin resistance in mice by silencing an inhibitor of insulin receptor catalytic activity, the growth factor receptor binding protein 14 (Grb14) in liver. Indeed, Grb14 knockdown enhanced hepatic insulin signaling but also dramatically inhibited de novo fatty acid synthesis. In the liver of obese and insulin-resistant mice, downregulation of Grb14 markedly decreased blood glucose and improved liver steatosis. Mechanistic analyses showed that upon Grb14 knockdown, the release of p62/sqstm1, a partner of Grb14, activated the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which in turn repressed the lipogenic nuclear liver X receptor (LXR). Our study reveals that Grb14 acts as a new signaling node that regulates lipogenesis and modulates insulin sensitivity in the liver by acting at a crossroad between the insulin receptor and the p62-Nrf2-LXR signaling pathways.
Hypercholesterolemia is a key risk factor for atherosclerosis and leads to the uptake of native and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) by macrophages (Mϕs) and foam cell formation. Inflammatory processes accompany Mϕ foam cell formation in the artery wall, yet the relationship between Mϕ lipid loading and their response to inflammatory stimuli remains elusive. We investigated proinflammatory gene expression in thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal Mϕs, bone marrow-derived Mϕs and dendritic cells, and RAW264.7 cells. Loading with oxLDL did not induce peritoneal Mϕ apoptosis or modulate basal-level expression of proinflammatory genes. Upon stimulation of TLR4, the rapid induction of IFN-β was inhibited in cells loaded with oxLDL, whereas the induction of other proinflammatory genes by TLR4 (LPS), TLR3 (polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid), TLR2 (Pam3CSK4), and TLR9 (CpG) remained comparable within the first 2 h. Subsequently, the expression of a subset of proinflammatory genes (e.g., IL-1β, IL-6, CCL5) was reduced in oxLDL-loaded cells at the level of transcription. This phenomenon was partially dependent on NF erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) but not on nuclear liver X receptors α and β (LXRα,β), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), and activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3). LPS-induced NF-κB reporter activity and intracellular signaling by NF-κB and MAPK pathways were comparable in oxLDL-loaded Mϕs, yet the binding of p65/RelA (the prototypic NF-κB family member) was reduced at IL-6 and CCL5 promoters. This study revealed that oxLDL loading of Mϕs negatively regulates transcription at late stages of TLR-induced proinflammatory gene expression and implicates epigenetic mechanisms such as histone deacetylase activity.
Background This study aimed at investigating whether NLRP 3 (the Nod like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing 3 protein) inflammasome activation induced HMGB 1 (high mobility group box-1 protein) secretion and foam cell formation in human vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMC s) and atherosclerosis in ApoE-/- mice. Methods and Results VSMC s or ApoE-/- mice were treated with lipopolysaccharides ( LPS ) and/or ATP or LPS and high-fat diet to induce NLRP 3 inflammasome activation. HMGB 1 distribution and foam cell formation in VSMC s were characterized. Liver X receptor α and ATP -binding cassette transporter expression were determined. The impact of NLRP 3 or receptor for advanced glycation end product silencing, ZYVAD - FMK (caspase-1 inhibitor), glycyrrhizin ( HMGB 1 inhibitor) or receptor for advanced glycation end product antagonist peptide on HMGB 1 secretion, foam cell formation, liver X receptor α and ATP -binding cassette transporter expression was examined. Expression level of HMGB 1 in human atherosclerosis obliterans arterial tissues was characterized. Our results found that NLRP 3 inflammasome activation promoted foam cell formation and HMGB 1 secretion in VSMC s. Extracellular HMGB 1 was a key signal molecule in inflammasome activation-mediated foam cell formation. Furthermore, inflammasome activation-induced HMGB 1 activity and foam cell formation were achieved by receptor for advanced glycation end product/liver X receptor α / ATP -binding cassette transporter glycyrrhizin. Experiments in vivo found glycyrrhizin significantly attenuated the LPS /high-fat diet-induced atherosclerosis and serum HMGB 1 levels in mice. Finally, levels of HMGB 1 and NLRP 3 were increased in tunica media adjacent to intima of atherosclerosis obliteran arteries. Conclusions Our results revealed that HMGB1 is a key downstream signal molecule of NLRP 3 inflammasome activation and plays an important role in VSMC s foam cell formation and atherogenesis by downregulating liver X receptor α and ATP -binding cassette transporter expression through receptor for advanced glycation end product.
CCN family member 1 (CCN1) is an extracellular matrix cytokine and appears in atherosclerotic lesions. However, we have no evidence to support the role of CCN1 in regulating cholesterol metabolism and atherosclerosis.
Apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE-/- ) mice were used as in vivo model. Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-induced macrophage-foam cells were used as in vitro model. RT-PCR and western blot analysis were used for evaluating gene and protein expression, respectively. Conventional assay kits were used for assessing the levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and cytokines.
We show predominant expression of CCN1 in foamy macrophages in atherosclerotic aortas of apoE-/- mice. In apoE-/- mice, CCN1 treatment worsened hyperlipidaemia, systemic inflammation, and the progression of atherosclerosis. In addition, CCN1 decreased the capacity of reverse cholesterol transport and downregulated the protein expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and ABCG1 in atherosclerotic aortas. Notably, CCN1 decreased the protein expression of cholesterol clearance-related proteins, including ABCG5, ABCG8, liver X receptor α (LXRα), cholesterol 7α-hydrolase and LDL receptor in liver, and exacerbated hepatic lipid accumulation. In macrophages, treatment with oxLDL increased CCN1 expression. Inhibition of CCN1 activity by neutralizing antibody or small interfering RNA attenuated the oxLDL-induced lipid accumulation. In contrast, cotreatment with CCN1 or overexpression of CCN1 augmented oxLDL-induced lipid accumulation by impairing apolipoprotein AI- and high-density lipoprotein-dependent cholesterol efflux, which was attributed to downregulation of LXRα-dependent expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1.
Our findings suggest that CCN1 plays a pivotal role in regulating cholesterol metabolism and the development of atherosclerosis.
Apolipoprotein M (apoM) is a recently identified human apolipoprotein that is associated with the formation of high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Studies have demonstrated that statins may affect the expression of apoM; however, the regulatory effects of statins on apoM are controversial. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms by which statins regulate apoM remain unclear. In the present study, in vivo and in vitro models were used to investigate whether the anti-atherosclerotic effects of statins are associated with its apoM-regulating effects and the underlying mechanism. Hyperlipidemia was induced by in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice by providing a high-fat diet. Atorvastatin was administered to hyperlipidemic mice and HepG2 cells to investigate its effect on apoM expression. The liver X receptor α (LXRα) agonist T0901317 was also administered together with atorvastatin to hyperlipidemic mice and HepG2 cells. The results revealed that atorvastatin increased apoM expression, which was accompanied with decreased expression of LXRα in the liver of hyperlipidemic apolipoprotein E-deficient mice and HepG2 cells. Additionally, apoM upregulation was inhibited following treatment with T0901317. In summary, atorvastatin exhibited anti-atherosclerotic effects by upregulating apoM expression in hyperlipidemic mice, which may be mediated by the inhibition of LXRα.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major risk factor of many end-stage liver diseases. Alterations in microRNA expression have been reported in patients with NAFLD. However, the transcriptional mechanism(s) of dysregulated microRNAs under the state of NAFLD is poorly described, and microRNAs that regulate the pathogenesis of NAFLD synergistically with their regulators remain unknown. Here we report that microRNA-378 expression is significantly increased in fatty livers of mice and patients with NAFLD. Although microRNA-378 locates within the intron of Ppargc1β (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-beta), there was a significant uncoupling of Ppargc1β mRNA and microRNA-378 levels in both sources of fatty livers. Further studies identified a full-length primary transcript of microRNA-378. LXRα (liver X receptor alpha) functioned as a transcription activator of microRNA-378 and a repressor of Ppargc1β transcription. It is known that miR-378 is an inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and the function of Ppargc1β is opposite to that of miR-378. GW3965 treatment (LXRα agonist) of murine hepatocytes and mice increased microRNA-378 and reduced Ppargc1β, which subsequently impaired FAO and aggravated hepatosteatosis. In contrast, additional treatment of miR-378 inhibitor or Ppargc1β, which knocked down increased miR-378 or recovered expression of Ppargc1β, offset the effects of GW3965. Liver-specific ablation of Lxrα led to decreased miR-378 and increased Ppargc1β, which subsequently improved FAO and reduced hepatosteatosis. Conclusion: Our findings indicated that miR-378 possesses its own transcription machinery, which challenges the well-established dogma that miR-378 transcription is controlled by the promoter of Ppargc1β. LXRα selectively activates transcription of miR-378 and inhibits expression of Ppargc1β, which synergistically impairs FAO. In addition to lipogenesis, impaired FAO by miR-378 in part contributes to LXRα-induced hepatosteatosis.
We previously showed that complement 3 (C3) is highly expressed in mesenchymal tissues in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). We targeted C3 gene by zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN) gene-editing technology and investigated blood pressure and phenotype in SHR. Blood pressure was measured by tail-cuff and telemetry methods. Histology and expression of liver X receptor α (LXRα), renin, Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5), and E-cadherin were evaluated in kidneys. Mesangial cells (MCs) were removed from glomeruli from three strains, and we evaluated the phenotype in vitro. SHR showed the salt-sensitive hypertension that was abolished in C3 knockout (KO) SHR. Proliferation of MCs from SHR was higher than that from Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and showed a synthetic phenotype. Renal injury scores were higher in SHR than in WKY rats and C3 KO SHR. Expression of E-cadherin was lower, and expression of renin was higher in the nephrotubulus from SHR than WKY rats and C3 KO SHR. Expression of C3 α-chain protein and α-smooth muscle actin protein was significantly higher in renal medulla from SHR than from WKY rats. Expression of angiotensinogen, LXRα, renin, and KLF5 mRNA was increased in kidney from SHR compared with C3 KO SHR. Intrarenal angiotensin II levels were significantly higher in kidney from SHR than WKY rats and C3 KO SHR. Urinary epinephrine and norepinephrine excretions were significantly higher in SHR than in WKY rats and C3 KO SHR. These findings showed that increased C3 induces salt-sensitive hypertension with increases in urinary catecholamine excretion and intrarenal activation of the renin-angiotensin system by the dedifferentiation of mesenchymal tissues in kidney from SHR.
Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by abnormal myocardial structure or performance. It has been suggested that microRNA-1 (miR-1) may be abnormally expressed in the hearts of patients with diabetes. In the present study, the role of miR-1 in glucose-induced apoptosis and its underlying mechanism of action was investigated in rat cardiomyocyte H9C2 cells. Cells were transfected with anti-miR-1 or miR-1-overexpression plasmids and the expression of miR-1 and liver X receptor α (LXRα) were determined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. The proportion of apoptotic cells was determined using an Annexin-V-FITC apoptosis detection kit and the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ) was measured following staining with rhodamine 123. In addition, the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins was measured by western blot analysis. The results demonstrated that expression of miR-1 was significantly increased, whereas the expression of LXRα was significantly decreased in H9C2 cells following treatment with glucose. miR-1 knockdown significantly inhibited apoptosis, increased the ΔΨ and suppressed the cleavage of poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase, caspase-3 and caspase-9. It also significantly downregulated the expression of Bcl-2 and upregulated the expression of Bax. In addition, it was demonstrated that miR-1 regulates LXRα; transfection with anti-miR-1 significantly increased the expression of LXRα. Furthermore, treatment of cells with the LXR agonist GW3965 inhibited apoptosis in glucose-induced anti-miR-1 cells. These results suggest a novel function of miR-1: The regulation of cardiomyocyte apoptosis via LXRα, and provide novel insights into regarding the complex mechanisms involved in DCM.
Supplementation with Selenium (Se) has been shown to lower blood cholesterol and increase tissue concentrations of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH); however, the effects of Se supplementation, in combination with supplemental magnesium, on high fat-induced hyperlipidemia have not been studied. This study was designed to elucidate the effects of oral selenium and magnesium co-supplementation on antihyperlipidemic and hepatoprotective, antioxidative activities, and related gene expression in a hyperlipidemic rat model.
Forty male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups: one group served as control group (CT), provided control diet; The other groups were made hyperlipidemic with high-fat diet; specifically, a high-fat diet group (HF); low-dose selenium (0.05 mg/kg·bw) + low-dose magnesium (5.83 mg/kg·bw) supplement high-fat diet group (HF + LSe + LMg) and high-dose selenium (0.10 mg/kg·bw) + high-dose magnesium (58.33 mg/kg·bw) supplement high-fat diet group (HF + HSe + HMg). The first 4 weeks of the experiment was a hyperlipidemia inducing period using high-fat diet and the following 8 weeks involved in selenium and magnesium co-supplementation. On day 0, 20, 40 and 60 of the intervention, lipid profile was measured. At the end of the 12-week experiments, final blood and liver samples were collected for the measurements of lipid profile, antioxidative indexes, pathological examination, and liver lipid metabolism related gene expression.
The elevated levels of serum and liver total cholesterol (TC) and serum LDL-C induced by feeding high-fat diets were significantly reduced by low-dose Se and Mg co-supplementation. Both doses of selenium and magnesium co-supplementation notably decreased the blood and liver TG levels, liver function indexes ALT and AST and the ratio of TC/HDL-C and TG/HDL-C. In contrast, Se and Mg supplementation showed a substantial increase in Se-dependent glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and SOD activities and an significant reduce of level of MDA of hyperlipidemic rats. Oil Red O staining showed that selenium and magnesium co-supplementation significantly reduced hepatic intracellular triacylglycerol accumulation. H&amp;E staining also showed that selenium and magnesium co-supplementation can attenuate liver steatosis. Selenium and magnesium co-supplementation remarkably inhibited the mRNA expression level of hepatic lipogenesis genes liver X receptor alpha (LXRα),SREBP-1c and FASN (fatty acid synthase), regulated the mRNA expression levels of liver enzymes related to cholesterol metabolism, including the down regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) and the upregulation of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) in the liver of hyperlipidemia rats.
Oral selenium and magnesium co-supplementation inhibited an increase of lipid and liver profile and liver function index induced by a high-fat diet, and enhanced the activity of the antioxidant enzymes. Selenium combined with magnesium is a promising therapeutic strategy with lipid-lowering and antioxidative effects that protects the liver against hyperlipidemia.
To characterize the association between epilepsy, use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), and the risk of hyperlipidemia, we conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study with data obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. The effects of AEDs on lipogenic gene expression were also examined in vitro. We identified 3617 cases involving patients, whose epilepsy was newly diagnosed between 2000 and 2011, and selected a comparison cohort comprising 14,468 patients without epilepsy. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the association between epilepsy, AED use, and hyperlipidemia. The incidence rate of hyperlipidemia was higher in the epilepsy cohort than in the comparison cohort, with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 1.21 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-1.38] after adjusting for comorbidities and medications. Epilepsy patients not taking AEDs had a higher risk of hyperlipidemia (aHR 1.65; 95% CI 1.35-2.03). Among AEDs, only valproate treatment showed a higher risk of hyperlipidemia (aHR 1.53; 95% CI 1.01-2.33), although the dose-dependent effect did not reach statistical significance. In vitro studies with two hepatic cell lines showed that valproate may exert its effects by activating the liver X receptor alpha (LXRα) signaling pathway, inducing the expression of lipogenesis-related genes and increasing cellular lipid contents. In silico calculations concluded that valproate can bind stably with the ligand-binding domain of LXRα. Thus, valproate-induced hepatic lipogenic gene expression may occur through LXRα activation. Predicting the 'off-target' effects of valproate may prove valuable in developing antiepileptic agents with fewer adverse reactions. Monitoring blood lipid levels throughout the course of treatment is recommended.
Due to poor water solubility and high susceptibility to chemical degradation, the applications of quercetin have been limited. This study investigated the effects of pH on the formation of quercetin-loaded nanoemulsion (NQ) and compared the hypocholesterolemic activity between quercetin and NQ to utilize the quercetin as functional food ingredient. NQ particle size exhibited a range of 207⁻289 nm with polydispersity index range (&lt;0.47). The encapsulation efficiency increased stepwise from 56 to 92% as the pH increased from 4.0 to 9.0. Good stability of NQ was achieved in the pH range of 6.5⁻9.0 during 3-month storage at 21 and 37 °C. NQ displayed higher efficacy in reducing serum and hepatic cholesterol levels and increasing the release of bile acid into feces in rats fed high-cholesterol diet, compared to quercetin alone. NQ upregulated hepatic gene expression involved in bile acid synthesis and cholesterol efflux, such as cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), liver X receptor alpha (LXRα), ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 1 (ABCG1). These results suggest at least partial involvement of hepatic bile acid synthesis and fecal cholesterol excretion in nanoemulsion quercetin-mediated beneficial effect on lipid abnormalities.
The contribution of dietary fiber to decrease the risk of atherosclerosis may occur through other mechanisms besides the increased excretion of cholesterol. Although macrophages are crucial for lipid clearance, the excessive uptake of cholesterol crystals (CC) by these cells induce NLRP3 inflammasome and foam cell formation. Thus, we investigated whether the water-soluble DF from chayote (WSP) regulate CC-pretreated macrophage-like THP-1 cells. Linkage analysis indicated that WSP is composed mainly of pectic homogalacturonan and highly branched type I rhamnogalacturonan as well as hemicellulosic material including glucomannan, xyloglucan, and glucurono(arabino)xylan. WSP reduced interleukin (IL)-1β and chemokine release in CC-pretreated macrophages. Notably, WSP also reduced lipid accumulation in cells previously exposed to CC. Furthermore, WSP upregulated liver X receptor alpha expression, which may account for increased lipid efflux, and reduced matrix metallopeptidase 9 expression. WSP also reduced active caspase-1 protein levels, and downregulated NLRP3 and IL-1β gene expression in CC-pretreated cells, suggesting that this polysaccharide fraction regulates the priming signals required for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Thus, WSP regulate lipid efflux and suppress inflammasome priming in macrophages, suggesting that the health benefits of this dietary fiber could go beyond its physical properties on the gastrointestinal tract.
Uteroplacental insufficiency (UPI) causes intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and increases the risk of hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular disease, which are leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Little is known about the mechanism through which UPI increases cholesterol. Hepatic Cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1) is the rate-limiting and most highly regulated step of cholesterol catabolism to bile acids. Cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase is regulated by transcription factor liver X receptor α (Lxrα) and by microRNA-122. We previously showed that microRNA-122 inhibition of Cyp7a1 translation decreased cholesterol catabolism to bile acids in female IUGR rats at the time of weaning. We hypothesized that UPI would increase cholesterol and microRNA-122 and decrease Cyp7a1 protein and hepatic bile acids in young adult female IUGR rats. To test our hypothesis, we used a rat model of IUGR induced by bilateral uterine artery ligation. Both control and IUGR offspring were exposed to a maternal high-fat diet from before conception through lactation, and all offspring were weaned to a high-fat diet on postnatal day 21. At postnatal day 60, IUGR female rats had increased total and low-density lipoprotein serum cholesterol and hepatic cholesterol, decreased Lxrα and Cyp7a1 protein, and decreased hepatic bile acids. Hepatic microRNA-122 was not changed by UPI. Our findings suggest that UPI decreased cholesterol catabolism to bile acids in young adult female rats through a mechanism independent of microRNA-122.
Although increasingly strong evidence suggests a role of maternal total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) levels during pregnancy as a risk factor for atherosclerotic disease in the offspring, the underlying mechanisms need to be clarified for future clinical applications.
To test whether epigenetic signatures characterize early fetal atherogenesis associated with maternal hypercholesterolemia and to provide a quantitative estimate of the contribution of maternal cholesterol level to fetal lesion size.
This autopsy study analyzed 78 human fetal aorta autopsy samples from the Division of Human Pathology, Department of Advanced Biomedical Sciences, Federico II University of Naples, Naples, Italy. Maternal levels of total cholesterol, LDLC, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), triglycerides, and glucose and body mass index (BMI) were determined during hospitalization owing to spontaneous fetal death. Data were collected and immediately processed and analyzed to prevent degradation from January 1, 2011, through November 30, 2016.
Results of DNA methylation and messenger RNA levels of the following genes involved in cholesterol metabolism were assessed: superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP2), liver X receptor α (LXRα), and adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1).
Among the 78 fetal samples included in the analysis (59% male; mean [SD] fetal age, 25 [3] weeks), maternal cholesterol level explained a significant proportion of the fetal aortic lesion variance in multivariate analysis (61%; P = .001) independently by the effect of levels of HDLC, triglycerides, and glucose and BMI. Moreover, maternal total cholesterol and LDLC levels were positively associated with methylation of SREBP2 in fetal aortas (Pearson correlation, 0.488 and 0.503, respectively), whereas in univariate analysis, they were inversely correlated with SREBP2 messenger RNA levels in fetal aortas (Pearson correlation, -0.534 and -0.671, respectively). Epivariations of genes controlling cholesterol metabolism in cholesterol-treated human aortic endothelial cells were also observed.
The present study provides a stringent quantitative estimate of the magnitude of the association of maternal cholesterol levels during pregnancy with fetal aortic lesions and reveals the epigenetic response of fetal aortic SREBP2 to maternal cholesterol level. The role of maternal cholesterol level during pregnancy and epigenetic signature in offspring in cardiovascular primary prevention warrants further long-term causal relationship studies.
The energy homeostasis-associated gene (ENHO), retinoid X receptor alpha gene (RXRA), and liver X receptor alpha gene (LXRA) are involved in adipogenic/lipogenic regulation. We investigated whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms in these genes (ENHO rs2281997, rs72735260; RXRA rs749759, rs10776909, rs10881578; LXRA rs2279238, rs7120118, rs11039155) are associated with dyslipidaemia, related comorbidities and survival of haemodialysis (HD) patients also tested for T-helper (Th) cell interleukin genes (IL).
The study was carried out in 873 HD patients. Dyslipidaemia was diagnosed by the recommendations of the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) guidelines (2003); atherogenic dyslipidaemia was referred to if the TG/HDL cholesterol ratio was equal to or higher than 3.8. Genotyping of ENHO SNPs, LXRA SNPs, and IL12A rs568408 was carried out using HRM analysis. RXRA SNPs, IL12B rs3212227, and IL18 rs360719 were genotyped using PCR-RFLP analysis. The circulating adropin concentration was determined in 126 patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Survival probability was analysed using the Kaplan-Meier method in 440 patients followed through 7.5 years.
Dyslipidaemia by K/DOQI was diagnosed in 459 patients (91% revealed hyper-LDL- cholesterolaemia), atherogenic dyslipidaemia was diagnosed in 454 patients, and 231 patients were free of dyslipidaemia by both criteria. The variant allele (T) of ENHO rs2281997 was associated with the hyper-LDL cholesterolaemic pattern of dyslipidaemia by K/DOQI. The frequency of atherogenic dyslipidaemia was lower in T-allele bearers than in CC-genotype patients. The rs2281997 T allele was associated with lower cardiovascular mortality in HD patients showing atherogenic dyslipidaemia. ENHO, RXRA, and LXRA showed epistatic interactions in dyslipidaemia. Circulating adropin was lower in atherogenic dyslipidaemia than in non-atherogenic conditions. RXRA rs10776909 was associated with myocardial infarction. Bearers of LXRA rs2279238, rs7120118 or rs11039155 minor alleles showed higher mortality. ENHO SNP positions fell within the same DNase 1 hypersensitivity site expressed in the Th1 cell line. Epistatic interactions occurred between rs2281997 and Th1 IL SNPs (rs360719, rs568408).
Atherogenic dyslipidaemia occurs in HD patients in whom ENHO encodes less adropin. ENHO, RXRA, and LXRA SNPs, separately or jointly, are associated with dyslipidaemia, myocardial infarction, and survival in HD patients. Differences in the availability of transcription binding sites may contribute to these associations.
This study investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of dietary genistein (GEN) on fatty liver syndrome (FLS) in laying hens. Hens in the control group (CG) were fed a high-energy and low-choline (HELC) diet to establish the FLS model. The livers of the FLS hens were friable and swollen from hemorrhage. Hepatic steatosis and inflammatory cell infiltration were present around the liver blood vessels. Hens in the low-genistein (LGE) and high-genistein (he) groups were fed GEN at 40 and 400 mg/kg doses, respectively, as supplements to the HELC diet. GEN at 40 mg/kg significantly increased gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) mRNA expression in the hypothalamus, the serum estrogen (E2) level, and the laying rate, whereas 400 mg/kg of GEN decreased GnRH expression and the laying rate without significantly affecting E2, suggesting that high-dose GEN adversely affected the reproductive performance. Either high- or low-dose GEN treatment could alleviate metabolic disorders and inflammatory responses in FLS hens. GEN significantly decreased the serum ALT, creatinine, triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and free fatty acid (FFA) levels. Accordingly, the TG and long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) levels, including long-chain saturated fatty acids (LSFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and the n-6:n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) ratio in the liver were reduced after the GEN treatments, whereas the levels of C22:0, n-3 family fatty acids, C20:3n6, and C20:4n6 were increased. These results indicated that dietary GEN downregulated the expression of genes related to fatty acid synthesis [sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1c), liver X receptor alpha (LXRα), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and acetyl coenzyme A synthetase (ACC)] and the fatty acid transporter (FAT). Furthermore, GEN treatments upregulated the transcription of genes related to fatty acid β-oxidation [peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)α, PPARδ, ACOT8, ACAD8, and ACADs] in the liver and reduced PPARγ and AFABP expression in abdominal fat. Dietary GEN alleviated inflammatory cell infiltration in the livers of FLS hens and downregulated TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β expression. Moreover, GEN treatment increased SOD activity and decreased malondialdehyde activity in the liver. In conclusion, GEN supplementation in the feed inhibited fatty acid synthesis and enhanced β-oxidation in the liver through the PPAR-ACAD/ACOT and PPAR-LXRα-SREBP1c-ACC/FAS/FAT pathways. Dietary GEN alleviated metabolic disorder and inflammation in the FLS hens by improving the antioxidant capacity and fatty acid profile.
Peritoneal fibrosis (PF) is characterized by progressive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components in the peritoneum under high glucose conditions. Rapamycin has previously been shown to inhibit ECM accumulation of peritoneal mesothelial cells (PMCs) and prevent PF. Here we explored the undefined mechanisms by which rapamycin inhibits ECM accumulation of PMCs. We used high-glucose peritoneal dialysis solution (PDS) in a mouse peritoneal dialysis model to induce in vivo PF and in human PMCs in vitro to stimulate ECM accumulation. The mice that received chronic PDS infusions showed typical features of PF, including markedly increased peritoneal thickness, excessive matrix deposition, increased peritoneal permeability, and higher expressions of α-smooth muscle actin and collagen I. Rapamycin significantly ameliorated these pathological changes. There was a parallel decrease in lipid accumulation in the peritoneum of rapamycin-treated mice. Rapamycin significantly inhibited high-glucose PDS-induced ECM accumulation and reduced the lipid droplet in human PMCs in the presence of PDS. The effects of rapamycin on intracellular lipid metabolism correlated with a series of steps in lipid homeostasis; namely, a decrease in low density lipoprotein receptor-mediated lipid influx, which was mediated through the downregulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) and SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), and an increase in adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter A1-mediated lipid efflux, which was mediated through the upregulation of the liver X receptor α and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α. We conclude that rapamycin shows a clear protective effect on high-glucose PDS-induced PF by improving the disruption of intracellular lipid homeostasis.
Nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor activation inhibits fatty acid synthesis through the liver X receptor-α-sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c pathway universally in animals, but also has human-specific crosstalk with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α. The effects of farnesoid X receptor-ligands on both the synthesis and degradation of fatty liver through nuclear receptor-related regulation were investigated in both human and murine hepatocytes. A fatty liver culture cell model was established using a synthetic liver X receptor-α-ligand (To901317) for both human and mouse non-neoplastic hepatocytes. The hepatocytes were exposed to natural or synthetic farnesoid X receptor-ligands (bile acids, GW4064, obeticholic acid) together with or after To901317. Cellular triglyceride accumulation was significantly inhibited by the farnesoid X receptor-ligands along with inhibition of lipogenic genes and up-regulation of farnesoid X receptor-target small heterodimer partner in both human and mouse cells. The accumulated triglyceride was significantly degraded by the farnesoid X receptor-ligands only in the human cells accompanied with the up-regulations of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α and fatty acid β-oxidation. Farnesoid X receptor-ligands can be therapeutic agents for treating human fatty liver through dual effects on inhibition of lipogenesis and on enhancement of lipolysis.
Dietary intake of cereal fiber has been reported to benefit lipid metabolism through multiple mechanisms. The present study aimed to discover the potential mechanisms by which cereal fiber could modify the intestinal cholesterol metabolism.
Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a reference chow (RC) diet; high-fat, high-cholesterol (HFC) diet; HFC plus oat fiber diet; or HFC plus wheat bran fiber diet for 24 weeks. Serum lipids were measured by enzymatic methods. Western blot was used to determine the protein expressions involved in intestinal cholesterol metabolism.
Our results showed that HFC-induced elevations of serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were normalized in both groups that received cereal fiber. At the protein level, compared with the HFC diet group, the two cereal fibers, especially the oat fiber, significantly increased the protein expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, liver X receptor alpha, sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) 2, low-density lipoprotein receptor, adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette A1, and ATP-binding cassette G1, while decreasing the protein expression of Niemann-Pick C1-like protein 1, SREBP-1, fatty acid synthase, and acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase, which were involved in intestinal cholesterol metabolism.
Taken together, increased intake of cereal fiber improved blood cholesterol profiles and increased the intestinal cholesterol efflux and cholesterol clearance in C57BL/6 mice fed a HFC diet. Oat fiber had a stronger effect than wheat bran fiber on cholesterol metabolism by modulating the PPARα, LXRα, and SREBP signaling pathways.
Qiwei Tiexie capsule (QWTX) is a representative prescription of Tibetan medicine, which is widely used for long-term treatment of chronic liver disease and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
This study explored the effects and mechanism of QWTX on 3T3-L1 adipocytes and NAFLD.
The 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and NAFLD rat model were used in the study. In 3T3-L1 cells, the cytotoxicity of QWTX was tested by CKK-8, and glucose uptake and fat acid oxidation were assessed by 2-deoxy-D-[3H] glucose and [1-14C] palmitic acid, respectively. The expression levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1), liver X receptor α (LXRα), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), ikappa B α (IκBα), and AKT were determined by PCR and western blot. NAFLD was established by the administration of fat emulsion and sucrose for 9 weeks. The effects of QWTX on lipid metabolism, liver function, and hepatic morphology were observed in NAFLD rats by HE and transmission electron microscope. Serum level of nitric oxide (NO) and fee fatty acid (FFA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in the liver, as well as the expression levels of Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), NF-κB, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), CPT-1, LXRα, PPARα, PPARβ/δ, PPARγ, and iNOS were all detected.
QWTX showed no cell cytotoxicity in 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells, and increased the 14CO2 production rate to 4.15, which indicated the reducing the fatty accumulation. In NAFLD, QWTX attenuated liver steatosis, fat vacuoles and inflammation from the HE staining and electron micrograph tests. For the oxidative stress biomarkers, serum FFA level was reduced and serum NO level was enhanced after QWTX treatment. In liver tissue, SOD was decreased and MDA was significantly increased in NAFLD, and both of them were restored by QWTX. NF-κB and CYP2E1 were also upregulated in NAFLD, while downregulated by QWTX. Downregulation of LXRα, PPARγ and iNOS by QWTX were both observed in the 3T3-L1 adipocytes and NAFLD model.
QWTX protected the liver injury in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and NAFLD by regulating the LXRα, PPARγ, and NF-κB-iNOS-NO signal pathways.
Background: The neuroinflammatory responses of microglial cells play an important role in the process of brain dysfunction caused by heat stroke. MicroRNAs are reportedly involved in a complex signaling network and have been identified as neuroinflammatory regulators. In this study, we determined the biological roles of microRNA-155 in the inflammatory responses in heat-stressed microglia and explored the underlying mechanisms. Methods: MicroRNA-155 mimic and inhibitor were used to separately upregulate or downregulate microRNA-155 expression. The activation state of BV-2 microglial cells (BV-2 cells) was assessed via immunoreactions using the microglial marker CD11b and CD68. Levels of induced interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were measured using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling proteins was evaluated by Western blotting for inhibitory kappa B alpha (IκBα) and NF-κB p65 phosphorylation and indirect immunofluorescence analysis using a p65 phosphorylation antibody. A luciferase reporter assay was used to verify liver X receptor α (LXRα) as a target gene of microRNA-155. Results: Heat stress significantly induced IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α release and increased the expression of CD11b and CD68. In addition, IκBα and NF-κB p65 phosphorylation were dramatically increased by heat stress, and microRNA-155 expression was also elevated. High expression of microRNA-155 in heat-stressed microglial cells was inversely correlated with LXRα expression. We then determined the role of microRNA-155 in the heat stress-induced inflammatory responses. The results revealed that by targeting LXRα, microRNA-155 enhanced NF-κB signaling activation and facilitated immune inflammation in heat stress-treated BV-2 cells. Conclusion: MicroRNA-155 promotes heat stress-induced inflammatory responses in microglia. The underlying mechanisms may include facilitating inflammatory factors expression by increasing NF-κB pathway activation via targeting LXRα.
Chitooligosaccharide is beneficial for inhibiting dyslipidemia and reducing atherosclerotic and hyperlipidemic risk. The purpose of this study was to investigate the cholesterol-regulating effects and potential mechanisms of Chitooligosaccharide tablets (CFTs) in high-fat diet-induced hyperlipidemic rats. The results revealed that CFTs can regulate serum lipid levels in hyperlipidemic rats in a dosage-dependent manner. Synchronously, gene expressions related to cholesterol excretion were upregulated in a dosage-dependent manner, including cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), liver X receptor α (LXRA), peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor-α (PPARα) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), whereas cholesterol synthetic gene expressions including 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) and sterol-responsive element binding protein-2 (SREBP2) were reduced. This work highlights that CFTs have potential as natural products to prevent and treat metabolic hyperlipidemia syndrome, probably due to the reduction of cholesterol biosynthesis and through cholesterol elimination; they also improve the pathological changes of liver tissue in rats, alleviate liver damage, maintain normal lipid metabolism in the liver, ameliorate hepatic glycolipid disorders and accelerate TC operation, and reduce blood lipid levels.
β-Cell proliferation and expansion during pregnancy are crucial for maintaining euglycemia in response to increased metabolic demands placed on the mother. Prolactin and placental lactogen signal through the prolactin receptor (PRLR) and contribute to adaptive β-cell responses in pregnancy; however, the in vivo requirement for PRLR signaling specifically in maternal β-cell adaptations remains unknown. We generated a floxed allele of Prlr, allowing conditional loss of PRLR in β-cells. In this study, we show that loss of PRLR signaling in β-cells results in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), reduced β-cell proliferation, and failure to expand β-cell mass during pregnancy. Targeted PRLR loss in maternal β-cells in vivo impaired expression of the transcription factor Foxm1, both G1/S and G2/M cyclins, tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (Tph1), and islet serotonin production, for which synthesis requires Tph1. This conditional system also revealed that PRLR signaling is required for the transient gestational expression of the transcription factor MafB within a subset of β-cells during pregnancy. MafB deletion in maternal β-cells also produced GDM, with inadequate β-cell expansion accompanied by failure to induce PRLR-dependent target genes regulating β-cell proliferation. These results unveil molecular roles for PRLR signaling in orchestrating the physiologic expansion of maternal β-cells during pregnancy.
The transcription factor forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2, also known as hepatocyte nuclear factor 3β or transcription factor 3β), has been found to play pivotal roles in multiple phases of mammalian life, from the early development to the organofaction, and subsequently in homeostasis and metabolism in the adult. In the embryonic development period, FOXA2 is require d for the formation of the primitive node and notochord, and its absence results in embryonic lethality. Moreover, FOXA2 plays an important role not only in lung development, but also in T helper type 2 (Th2)-mediated pulmonary inflammation and goblet cell hyperplasia. In this article, the role of FOXA2 in lung development and Th2-mediated pulmonary inflammation, as well as in goblet cell hyperplasia, is reviewed. FOXA2 deletion in airway epithelium results into Th2-mediated pulmonary inflammation and goblet cell hyperplasia in developing lung. Leukotriene pathway and signal transducers and activators of transcription 6 pathway may mediate this inflammation through recruitment and activation of denditric cell during lung developments. FOXA2 is a potential treatment target for lung diseases with Th2 inflammation and goblet cell hyperplasia, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
Group IVA phospholipase A2 [cytosolic phospholipase A2α (cPLA2α)] is a key mediator of inflammation and tumorigenesis. In this study, by using a combination of chemical inhibition and genetic approaches in zebrafish and murine cells, we identify a mechanism by which cPLA2α promotes cell proliferation. We identified 2 cpla2α genes in zebrafish, cpla2αa and cpla2αb, with conserved phospholipase activity. In zebrafish, loss of cpla2α expression or inhibition of cpla2α activity diminished G1 progression through the cell cycle. This phenotype was also seen in both mouse embryonic fibroblasts and mesangial cells. G1 progression was rescued by the addition of arachidonic acid or prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), indicating a phospholipase-dependent mechanism. We further show that PGE2, through PI3K/AKT activation, promoted Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) phosphorylation and FOXO1 nuclear export. This led to up-regulation of cyclin D1 and down-regulation of p27(Kip1), thus promoting G1 progression. Finally, using pharmacologic inhibitors, we show that cPLA2α, rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF)/MEK/ERK, and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways cooperatively regulate G1 progression in response to platelet-derived growth factor stimulation. In summary, these data indicate that cPLA2α, through its phospholipase activity, is a critical effector of G1 phase progression through the cell cycle and suggest that pharmacological targeting of this enzyme may have important therapeutic benefits in disease mechanisms that involve excessive cell proliferation, in particular, cancer and proliferative glomerulopathies.
Growth factor-mediated hepatocyte proliferation is crucial in liver regeneration and the recovery of liver function after injury. The nuclear receptor, pregnane X receptor (PXR), is a key transcription factor for the xenobiotic-induced expression of genes associated with various liver functions. Recently, we reported that PXR activation stimulates xenobiotic-induced hepatocyte proliferation. In the present study, we investigated whether PXR activation also stimulates growth factor-mediated hepatocyte proliferation. In G0 phase-synchronized, immortalized mouse hepatocytes, serum or epidermal growth factor treatment increased cell growth and this growth was augmented by the expression of mouse PXR and co-treatment with pregnenolone 16α-carbonitrile (PCN), a PXR ligand. In a liver regeneration model using carbon tetrachloride, PCN treatment enhanced the injury-induced increase in the number of Ki-67-positive nuclei as well as Ccna2 and Ccnb1 mRNA levels in wild-type (WT) but not Pxr-null mice. Chronological analysis of this model demonstrated that PCN treatment shifted the maximum cell proliferation to an earlier time point and increased the number of M-phase cells at those time points. In WT but not Pxr-null mice, PCN treatment reduced hepatic mRNA levels of genes involved in the suppression of G0/G1- and G1/S-phase transition, e.g. Rbl2, Cdkn1a and Cdkn1b. Analysis of the Rbl2 promoter revealed that PXR activation inhibited its Forkhead box O3 (FOXO3)-mediated transcription. Finally, the PXR-mediated enhancement of hepatocyte proliferation was inhibited by the expression of dominant active FOXO3 in vitro. The results of the present study suggest that PXR activation stimulates growth factor-mediated hepatocyte proliferation in mice, at least in part, through inhibiting FOXO3 from accelerating cell-cycle progression. 
'Glucotoxicity' is a term used to convey the negative effect of hyperglycaemia on beta cell function; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms that impair insulin secretion and gene expression are poorly defined. Our objective was to define the role of transcription factor v-ets avian erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homologue 1 (Ets-1) in beta cell glucotoxicity.
Primary islets and Min6 cells were exposed to high glucose and Ets-1 expression was measured. Recombinant adenovirus and transgenic mice were used to upregulate Ets-1 expression in beta cells in vitro and in vivo, and insulin secretion was assessed. The binding activity of H3/H4 histone on the Ets-1 promoter, and that of forkhead box (FOX)A2, FOXO1 and Ets-1 on the Pdx-1 promoter was measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative real-time PCR assay.
High glucose induced upregulation of Ets-1 expression and hyperacetylation of histone H3 and H4 at the Ets-1 gene promoter in beta cells. Ets-1 overexpression dramatically suppressed insulin secretion and biosynthesis both in vivo and in vitro. Besides, Ets-1 overexpression increased the activity of FOXO1 but decreased that of FOXA2 binding to the pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX-1) homology region 2 (PH2), resulting in inhibition of Pdx-1 promoter activity and downregulation of PDX-1 expression and activity. In addition, high glucose promoted the interaction of Ets-1 and FOXO1, and the activity of Ets-1 binding to the Pdx-1 promoter. Importantly, PDX-1 overexpression reversed the defect in pancreatic beta cells induced by Ets-1 excess, while knockdown of Ets-1 prevented hyperglycaemia-induced dysfunction of pancreatic beta cells.
Our observations suggest that Ets-1 links glucotoxicity to pancreatic beta cell dysfunction through inhibiting PDX-1 expression in type 2 diabetes.
Previously we reported that valproic acid (VPA) acts in synergy with GOS to enhance cell death in human DU145 cells. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In this study, we observed that such synergistic cytotoxicity of GOS and VPA could be extended to human A375, HeLa, and PC-3 cancer cells. GOS and VPA co-treatment induced robust apoptosis as evidenced by caspase-8/-9/-3 activation, PARP cleavage, and nuclear fragmentation. GOS and VPA also markedly decreased cyclin A2 protein expression. Owing to the reduction of cyclin A2, Akt signaling was suppressed, leading to dephosphorylation of FOXO3a. Consequently, FOXO3a was activated and the expression of its target genes, including pro-apoptotic FasL and Bim, was upregulated. Supporting this, FOXO3a knockdown attenuated FasL and Bim upregulation and apoptosis induction in GOS+VPA-treated cells. Furthermore, blocking proteasome activity by MG132 prevented the downregulation of cyclin A2, dephosphorylation of Akt and FOXO3a, and induction of apoptosis in cells co-treated with GOS and VPA. In mouse model, GOS and VPA combination significantly inhibited the growth of A375 melanoma xenografts. Our findings indicate that GOS and VPA co-treatment induces apoptosis in human cancer cells by suppressing the cyclin-A2/Akt/FOXO3a pathway. 
Mucus hypersecretion and goblet cell hyperplasia are common features that characterize asthma. IL-13 increases mucin (MUC) 5AC, the major component of airway mucus, in airway epithelial cells. According to the literature, IL-13 receptor activation leads to STAT6 activation and consequent induction of chloride channel accessory 1 (CLCA1) gene expression, associated with the induction of MUC5AC. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is an enzyme that catalyzes oxidation of heme to biliverdin, and has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. We examined the effects of HO-1 on mucin production and goblet cell hyperplasia induced by IL-13. Moreover, we assessed the cell signaling intermediates that appear to be responsible for mucin production. Normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells were grown at air liquid interface (ALI) in the presence or absence of IL-13 and hemin, a HO-1 inducer, for 14 days. Protein concentration was analyzed using ELISA, and mRNA expression was examined by real-time PCR. Histochemical analysis was performed using HE staining, andWestern blotting was performed to evaluate signaling transduction pathway. Hemin (4 μM) significantly increased HO-1 protein expression (p b 0.01) and HO-1 mRNA expression (p b 0.001). IL-13 significantly increased goblet cells, MUC5AC protein secretion (p b 0.01) and MUC5AC mRNA (p b 0.001), and these were decreased by hemin by way of HO-1. Tin protoporphyrin (SnPP)-IX, a HO-1 inhibitor, blocked the effect of hemin restoring MUC5AC protein secretion (p b 0.05) and goblet cell hyperplasia. Hemin decreased the expression of CLCA1 mRNA (p b 0.05) and it was reversed by SnPP-IX, but could not suppress IL-13-induced phosphorylation of STAT6 or SAM pointed domain-containing ETS transcription factor (SPDEF) and Forkhead box A2 (FOXA2) mRNA expression. In summary, HO-1 overexpression suppressed IL-13-induced goblet cell hyperplasia and MUC5AC production, and involvement of CLCA1 in the mechanism was suggested.
To show the efficient generation of hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) differentiated from the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of rats.
Hepatic differentiation was achieved using a three-step protocol with several growth factors. First, rat iPSCs were differentiated into definitive endoderm cells using Activin A and Wnt3a treatment. Then fibroblast growth factor 4 and bone morphogenetic protein 2 were added to the culture medium and used to induce hepatic differentiation. Finally, hepatocyte growth factor, Oncostatin M and dexamethasone were used for hepatic maturation. The liver-related markers and functions of HLCs were assessed at the gene and protein levels.
After endodermal induction, the differentiated cells expressed endodermal markers forkhead box protein A2 and SRY-box containing gene 17 at the mRNA and protein levels. After 20 d of culture, the iPSCs were differentiated into HLCs. These differentiated cells expressed hepatic markers including α-fetoprotein, albumin CK8, CK18, CK19, and transcription factor HNF-4α. In addition, the cells expressed functional proteins such as α1-antitrypsin, cytochrome P450 1A2 and CYP 3A4. They acted like healthy hepatic cells, storing glycogen and taking up indocyanine green and low-density lipoproteins. Also, the rates of urea synthesis (20 d 1.202 ± 0.080 mg/dL vs 0 d 0.317 ± 0.021 mg/dL, P &lt; 0.01) and albumin secretion (20 d 1.601 ± 0.102 mg/dL vs 0 d 0.313 ± 0.015 mg/dL, P &lt; 0.01) increased significantly as differentiation progressed.
Rat iPSCs can differentiate into HLCs rapidly and efficiently. These differentiated cells may be an attractive resource for treatment of end-stage liver disease.
A lignan-rich diet is associated with a lower risk of human breast cancer. Enterolactone, an active polyphenol metabolites of lignan, was reported to have an antitumor effect. We investigated the mechanism for the effect of enterolactone against human breast cancer. Cellular changes, and associated genes induced by enterolactone, were investigated in MDA-MB-231 cells. Enterolactone showed an antiproliferative effect, and its IC50 was 261.9 ± 10.5 μM for a treatment period of 48 hr. The mRNA levels of the genes related to cell proliferation, Ki67, PCNA, and FoxM1, were reduced. Enterolactone induced accumulation of cells in the S phase, and a lower expression of Cyclin E1, Cyclin A2, Cyclin B1, and Cyclin B2 genes. There were almost no changes in the transcription levels of the genes that participate in G0/G1 phase regulation, CDK4, CDK6, and Cyclin D1. Furthermore, enterolactone interfered with the cytoskeleton by downregulating phosphorylation of the FAK/paxillin pathway, inhibiting migration and invasion of cells. The results suggest that enterolactone exerts an antitumor effect by regulating the expression of genes associated with cell proliferation and the cell cycle and by blocking the FAK/paxillin signaling pathway. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms behind the antitumor effect of enterolactone. 
Hepatocyte-like cells differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells (such as human embryonic stem (ES) cells and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells) are expected to be utilized in drug screening. However, the hepatocyte differentiation efficiency and hepatic functions of hepatocyte-like cells were not sufficient to perform ES/iPS cell-based drug discovery. Therefore, we decided to improve the method of hepatocyte differentiation from human ES/iPS cells. To enhance this hepatocyte differentiation efficiency, hepatocyte-related transcription factors, such as forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1α), were overexpressed during the hepatocyte differentiation process. In addition, to enhance the functions of hepatocyte-like cells, these cells were cultured in three dimensional (3D) conditions using a Nanopillar plate. By FOXA2 and HNF1α overexpression, human ES/iPS cells could efficiently (more than 80%) differentiate into albumin-positive hepatocyte-like cells. Various hepatic functions, including albumin secretion and drug metabolism capacities, of the hepatocyte-like cells were significantly enhanced by performing 3D cell culture. These results suggest that the method of hepatocyte differentiation could be improved by using gene transfer and 3D cell culture technologies. We believe that these new hepatocyte-like cells would be useful tools in drug development.
The enterohormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is required to amplify glucose-induced insulin secretion that facilitates peripheral glucose utilisation. Alteration in GLP-1 secretion during obesity has been reported but is still controversial. Due to the high adaptability of intestinal cells to environmental changes, we hypothesised that the density of GLP-1-producing cells could be modified by nutritional factors to prevent the deterioration of metabolic condition in obesity. We quantified L-cell density in jejunum samples collected during Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in forty-nine severely obese subjects analysed according to their fat consumption. In mice, we deciphered the mechanisms by which a high-fat diet (HFD) makes an impact on enteroendocrine cell density and function. L-cell density in the jejunum was higher in obese subjects consuming &gt;30 % fat compared with low fat eaters. Mice fed a HFD for 8 weeks displayed an increase in GLP-1-positive cells in the jejunum and colon accordingly to GLP-1 secretion. The regulation by the HFD appears specific to GLP-1-producing cells, as the number of PYY (peptide YY)-positive cells remained unchanged. Moreover, genetically obese ob/ob mice did not show alteration of GLP-1-positive cell density in the jejunum or colon, suggesting that obesity per se is not sufficient to trigger the mechanism. The higher L-cell density in HFD-fed mice involved a rise in L-cell terminal differentiation as witnessed by the increased expression of transcription factors downstream of neurogenin3 (Ngn3). We suggest that the observed increase in GLP-1-positive cell density triggered by high fat consumption in humans and mice might favour insulin secretion and therefore constitute an adaptive response of the intestine to balance diet-induced insulin resistance. 
Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft-tissue sarcoma in childhood. Here we studied 60 RMSs using whole-exome/-transcriptome sequencing, copy number (CN) and DNA methylome analyses to unravel the genetic/epigenetic basis of RMS. On the basis of methylation patterns, RMS is clustered into four distinct subtypes, which exhibits remarkable correlation with mutation/CN profiles, histological phenotypes and clinical behaviours. A1 and A2 subtypes, especially A1, largely correspond to alveolar histology with frequent PAX3/7 fusions and alterations in cell cycle regulators. In contrast, mostly showing embryonal histology, both E1 and E2 subtypes are characterized by high frequency of CN alterations and/or allelic imbalances, FGFR4/RAS/AKT pathway mutations and PTEN mutations/methylation and in E2, also by p53 inactivation. Despite the better prognosis of embryonal RMS, patients in the E2 are likely to have a poor prognosis. Our results highlight the close relationships of the methylation status and gene mutations with the biological behaviour in RMS. 
It has been shown that acetylcholine is both a neurotransmitter and acts as a local mediator, produced by airway cells including epithelial cells. In vivo studies have demonstrated an indirect role for acetylcholine in epithelial cell differentiation. Here, we aimed to investigate direct effects of endogenous non-neuronal acetylcholine on epithelial cell differentiation.
Human airway epithelial cells from healthy donors were cultured at an air-liquid interface (ALI). Cells were exposed to the muscarinic antagonist tiotropium (10 nM), interleukin (IL)-13 (1, 2 and 5 ng/mL), or a combination of IL-13 and tiotropium, during or after differentiation at the ALI.
Human airway epithelial cells expressed all components of the non-neuronal cholinergic system, suggesting acetylcholine production. Tiotropium had no effects on epithelial cell differentiation after air exposure. Differentiation into goblet cells was barely induced after air exposure. Therefore, IL-13 (1 ng/mL) was used to induce goblet cell metaplasia. IL-13 induced MUC5AC-positive cells (5-fold) and goblet cells (14-fold), as assessed by histochemistry, and MUC5AC gene expression (105-fold). These effects were partly prevented by tiotropium (47-92%). Goblet cell metaplasia was induced by IL-13 in a dose-dependent manner, which was inhibited by tiotropium. In addition, tiotropium reversed goblet cell metaplasia induced by 2 weeks of IL-13 exposure. IL-13 decreased forkhead box protein A2 (FoxA2) expression (1.6-fold) and increased FoxA3 (3.6-fold) and SAM-pointed domain-containing ETS transcription factor (SPDEF) (5.2-fold) expression. Tiotropium prevented the effects on FoxA2 and FoxA3, but not on SPDEF.
We demonstrate that tiotropium has no effects on epithelial cell differentiation after air exposure, but inhibits and reverses IL-13-induced goblet cell metaplasia, possibly via FoxA2 and FoxA3. This indicates that non-neuronal acetylcholine contributes to goblet cell differentiation by a direct effect on epithelial cells.
The forkhead box A (FOXA) family of pioneer transcription factors is critical for the development of many endoderm-derived tissues. Their importance in regulating biological processes in the lung and liver is extensively characterized, though much less is known about their role in intestine. Here we investigate the contribution of FOXA2 to coordinating intestinal epithelial cell function using postconfluent Caco2 cells, differentiated into an enterocyte-like model. FOXA2 binding sites genome-wide were determined by ChIP-seq and direct targets of the factor were validated by ChIP-qPCR and siRNA-mediated depletion of FOXA1/2 followed by RT-qPCR. Peaks of FOXA2 occupancy were frequent at loci contributing to gene ontology pathways of regulation of cell migration, cell motion, and plasma membrane function. Depletion of both FOXA1 and FOXA2 led to a significant reduction in the expression of multiple transmembrane proteins including ion channels and transporters, which form a network that is essential for maintaining normal ion and solute transport. One of the targets was the adenosine A2B receptor, and reduced receptor mRNA levels were associated with a functional decrease in intracellular cyclic AMP. We also observed that 30% of FOXA2 binding sites contained a GATA motif and that FOXA1/A2 depletion reduced GATA-4, but not GATA-6 protein levels. These data show that FOXA2 plays a pivotal role in regulating intestinal epithelial cell function. Moreover, that the FOXA and GATA families of transcription factors may work cooperatively to regulate gene expression genome-wide in the intestinal epithelium.
The Forkhead Box A2 (FOXA2) transcription factor is required for embryonic development and for normal functions of multiple adult tissues, in which the maintained expression of FOXA2 is usually related to preventing the progression of malignant transformation. In this study, we found that FOXA2 prevented the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in human breast cancer. We observed a strong correlation between the expression levels of FOXA2 and the epithelial phenotype. Knockdown of FOXA2 promoted the mesenchymal phenotype, whereas stable overexpression of FOXA2 attenuated EMT in breast cancer cells. FOXA2 was found to endogenously bind to and stimulate the promoter of E-cadherin that is crucial for epithelial phenotype of the tumor cells. Meanwhile, FOXA2 prevented EMT of breast cancer cells by repressing the expression of EMT-related transcription factor ZEB2 through recruiting a transcriptional corepressor TLE3 to the ZEB2 promoter. The stable overexpression of FOXA2 abolished metastasis of breast cancer cells in vivo. This study confirmed that FOXA2 inhibited EMT in breast cancer cells by regulating the transcription of EMT-related genes such as E-cadherin and ZEB2. 
Inhaled xenobiotics such as tobacco-specific carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone are mainly metabolized by phase I oxidase cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily A, polypeptide 13 (CYP2A13), phase II conjugate UDP glucuronosyltransferase 2 family, polypeptide B17 (UGT2B17), and phase III transporter ATP-binding cassette, subfamily B (MDR/TAP), member 1 (ABCB1), with genetic polymorphisms implicated in lung cancer. Their genetic interaction and pulmonary expression regulation are largely unknown. We analyzed joint association for CYP2A13 and ABCB1 polymorphisms in 2 independent lung cancer case populations (669 and 566 patients) and 1 common control population (749 subjects), and characterized the trans-acting function of the lung development-related transcription factor forkhead box A2 (FOXA2). We undertook FOXA2 overexpression and down-regulation in lung epithelial cell lines, analyzed functional impact on the transactivation of CYP2A13, UGT2B17, and ABCB1, and measured correlation for their expressions in lung tissues. We found a substantial reduction in cancer risk (OR 0.39; 95% CI 0.25-0.61; Pinteraction = 0.029) associated with combined genotypes for CYP2A13 R257C and a functionary regulatory variant in the cis element of ABCB1 synergistically targeted by GATA binding protein 6 and FOXA2. Genetic manipulation of FOXA2 consistently influenced its binding to and transactivation of the promoters of CYP2A13, UGT2B17, and ABCB1, whose mRNA and protein expressions were all consistently correlated with those of FOXA2 in both tumorous and normal lung tissues. We therefore establish FOXA2 as a core transcriptional modulator for pulmonary xenobiotic metabolic pathways and uncover an etiologically relevant interaction between CYP2A13 and ABCB1, furthering our understanding of expression and function of the xenobiotic metabolism system.
The development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of complex brain disorders such as drug addiction is likely to be advanced by a more complete understanding of the underlying molecular pathophysiology. Although the study of postmortem human brain represents a unique resource in this regard, it can be challenging to disentangle the relative contribution of chronic pathological processes versus perimortem events to the observed changes in gene expression. To begin to unravel this issue, we analyzed by quantitative PCR the midbrain expression of numerous candidate genes previously associated with cocaine abuse. Data obtained from chronic cocaine abusers (and matched control subjects) dying of gunshot wounds were compared with a prior study of subjects with deaths directly attributable to cocaine abuse. Most of the genes studied (i.e., tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine transporter, forkhead box A2, histone variant H3 family 3B, nuclear factor kappa B inhibitor alpha, growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible beta) were found to be differentially expressed in chronic cocaine abusers irrespective of immediate cause of death or perimortem levels of cocaine, suggesting that these may represent core pathophysiological changes arising with chronic drug abuse. On the other hand, chemokine C-C motif ligand 2 and jun proto-oncogene expression were unaffected in cocaine-abusing subjects dying of gunshot wounds, in contrast to the differential expression previously reported in cocaine-related fatalities. The possible influence of cause of death and other factors on the cocaine-responsiveness of these genes is discussed. 
DNA microarray data on thyroid tissue from patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and from healthy controls were compared in order to investigate the regulatory genes and uncover the underlying regulatory network in PTC. The DNA microarray data set, GSE3678, was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database. This included seven thyroid tissue samples from patients with PTC and seven samples from healthy controls. Raw data were processed and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using corresponding R packages. Gene regulation analysis was conducted using TRANSFAC® and TRED. A total of 171 DEGs were obtained. A regulatory network was then established, using 104 of the DEGs. Subsequently, pathway enrichment analyses of the genes were conducted using Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) online tool. Three differentially expressed transcription factors were identified: Trefoil factor 3, cut‑like homeobox 2 and forkhead box protein A2. The most significant pathways involving the 104 DEGs were pathways involved in cancer. Biological process analysis using DAVID, suggested that these genes were associated with the positive regulation of gene expression, gene transcription and metabolic processes. The present study identified a range of genes associated with the development of PTC. The results of the present study were beneficial for understanding the regulatory mechanisms involved in PTC, and for developing clinical diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for this disease.
Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a cytokine that mediates the influx of cells to sites of inflammation. Our group recently reported that propofol exerted an anti-inflammatory effect and could inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, the effect and possible mechanisms of propofol on MCP-1 expression remain unclear. LPS-stimulated HepG2 cells were treated with 50 μM propofol for 0, 6, 12, and 24 h, respectively. The transcript and protein levels were measured by real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot analyses, respectively. We found that propofol markedly decreased both MCP-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels in LPS-stimulated HepG2 cells in a time-dependent manner. Expression of apolipoprotein M (apoM) and forkhead box protein A2 (foxa2) was increased by propofol treatment in HepG2 cells. In addition, the inhibitory effect of propofol on MCP-1 expression was significantly abolished by small interfering RNA against apoM and foxa2 in LPS-stimulated HepG2 cells. Propofol attenuates LPS-induced MCP-1 production through enhancing apoM and foxa2 expression in HepG2 cells. 
Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a golden pigment from turmeric, has been linked with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antiviral, antibacterial, and antidiabetic properties. Most of the these activities have been assigned to methoxy, hydroxyl, α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety or to diketone groups present in curcumin. One of the major metabolites of curcumin is tetrahydrocurcumin (THC), which lacks α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety and is white in color. Whether THC is superior to curcumin on a molecular level is unclear and thus is the focus of this review. Various studies suggest that curcumin is a more potent antioxidant than THC; curcumin (but not THC) can bind and inhibit numerous targets including DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase-1, heme oxygenase-1, Nrf2, β-catenin, cyclooxygenase-2, NF-kappaB, inducible nitric oxide synthase, nitric oxide, amyloid plaques, reactive oxygen species, vascular endothelial growth factor, cyclin D1, glutathione, P300/CBP, 5-lipoxygenase, cytosolic phospholipase A2, prostaglandin E2, inhibitor of NF-kappaB kinase-1, -2, P38MAPK, p-Tau, tumor necrosis factor-α, forkhead box O3a, CRAC; curcumin can inhibit tumor cell growth and suppress cellular entry of viruses such as influenza A virus and hepatitis C virus much more effectively than THC; curcumin affects membrane mobility; and curcumin is also more effective than THC in suppressing phorbol-ester-induced tumor promotion. Other studies, however, suggest that THC is superior to curcumin for induction of GSH peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase, NADPH: quinone reductase, and quenching of free radicals. Most studies have indicated that THC exhibits higher antioxidant activity, but curcumin exhibits both pro-oxidant and antioxidant properties. 
Methylosome protein 50 (MEP50) is a component of methylosome where MEP50 binds protein substrates and activates the oncogenic protein arginine methyl transferase 5 (PRMT5). MEP50 is also a coactivator for androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen receptor (ER), and transforms cells in the presence of androgen or estrogen. To extend the understanding of how MEP50 transforms cells, we investigated whether MEP50 could transform cells independent of AR and ER, and clarified whether PRMT5 could contribute to the MEP50-caused tumor formation. Microarray and Western blot analyses revealed the association of MEP50 with many human cancers including lung cancer. Knockdown of MEP50 retarded cell growth and migration in selected lung cancer cell lines, which expressed very low level of AR and ER and were insensitive to inhibitors of AR and ER. Moreover, overexpression of Myc-MEP50 enhanced cell transforming activities of 293T cells which are known lack of expression of AR and ER. Mechanistic analyses showed that MEP50 controlled G2 progression, upregulated cyclin-dependent kinase 1(CDK1)/cyclin B1, and activated the survival cascade Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT. MEP50 promoted cell migration, and activated the cell migration pathways such as Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1)/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), and forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2)/slug/cadherin cascades. Further analyses revealed that MEP50 activated the survival factor PI3K through PRMT5-catalyzed dimethylation of PI3K. Collectively, it is concluded that MEP50 can transform cells independent of AR and ER, and PRMT5 has partial contribution to that process. 
SAM-pointed domain-containing ETS transcription factor (SPDEF) is expressed in normal prostate epithelium. While its expression changes during prostate carcinogenesis (PCa), the role of SPDEF in prostate cancer remains controversial due to the lack of genetic mouse models. In present study, we generated transgenic mice with the loss- or gain-of-function of SPDEF in prostate epithelium to demonstrate that SPDEF functions as tumor suppressor in prostate cancer. Loss of SPDEF increased cancer progression and tumor cell proliferation, whereas over-expression of SPDEF in prostate epithelium inhibited carcinogenesis and reduced tumor cell proliferation in vivo and in vitro. Transgenic over-expression of SPDEF inhibited mRNA and protein levels of Foxm1, a transcription factor critical for tumor cell proliferation, and reduced expression of Foxm1 target genes, including Cdc25b, Cyclin B1, Cyclin A2, Plk-1, AuroraB, CKS1 and Topo2alpha. Deletion of SPDEF in transgenic mice and cultures prostate tumor cells increased expression of Foxm1 and its target genes. Furthermore, an inverse correlation between SPDEF and Foxm1 levels was found in human prostate cancers. The two-gene signature of low SPDEF and high FoxM1 predicted poor survival in prostate cancer patients. Mechanistically, SPDEF bound to, and inhibited transcriptional activity of Foxm1 promoter by interfering with the ability of Foxm1 to activate its own promoter through auto-regulatory site located in the -745/-660 bp Foxm1 promoter region. Re-expression of Foxm1 restored cellular proliferation in the SPDEF-positive cancer cells and rescued progression of SPDEF-positive tumors in mouse prostates. Altogether, SPDEF inhibits prostate carcinogenesis by preventing Foxm1-regulated proliferation of prostate tumor cells. The present study identified novel crosstalk between SPDEF tumor suppressor and Foxm1 oncogene and demonstrated that this crosstalk is required for tumor cell proliferation during progression of prostate cancer in vivo.
Dysregulation of forkhead box protein A2 (Foxa2) expression in fetal ventral mesencephalon (VM)-derived neural precursor cells (NPCs) appears to be associated with the loss of their potential to differentiate into dopaminergic (DA) neurons after mitogenic expansion in vitro, hindering their efficient use as a transplantable cell source. Here, we report that epigenetic activation of Foxa2 in VM-derived NPCs by inducing histone hyperacetylation rescues the mitogenic-expansion-dependent decrease of differentiation potential to DA neurons. The silencing of Foxa2 gene expression after expansion is accompanied by repressive histone modifications, including hypoacetylation of histone H3 and H4 and trimethylation of H3K27 on the Foxa2 promoter, as well as on the global level. In addition, histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7) is highly expressed during differentiation and recruited to the Foxa2 promoter. Induction of histone acetylation in VM-derived NPCs by either knockdown of HDAC7 or treatment with the HDAC inhibitor apicidin upregulates Foxa2 expression via hyperacetylation of H3 and a decrease in H3K27 trimethylation on the promoter regions, leading to the expression of DA neuron developmental genes and enhanced differentiation of DA neurons. These effects are antagonized by the expression of shRNAs specific for Foxa2 but enhanced by shRNA for HDAC7. Collectively, these findings indicate that loss of differentiation potential of expanded VM-derived NPCs is attributed to a decrease in Foxa2 expression and suggest that activation of the endogenous Foxa2 gene by epigenetic regulation might be an approach to enhance the generation of DA neurons. 
The transcription factor FOXO3 is a well-established tumor suppressor whose activity, stability, and localization are regulated by phosphorylation and acetylation. Previous data by our laboratory demonstrated amplified thromboxane-A2 signaling was associated with poor prognoses in bladder cancer patients and overexpression of the thromboxane-A2 isoform-β receptor (TPβ), but not TPα, induced malignant transformation of immortalized bladder cells in vivo. Here, we describe a mechanism of TP mediated modulation of FOXO3 activity and localization by phosphorylation and deacetylation in a bladder cancer cell model. In vitro gain and loss of function studies performed in non-transformed cell lines, UROsta and SV-HUC, revealed knockdown of FOXO3 expression by shRNA increased cell migration and invasion, while exogenously overexpressing TPβ raised basal phosphorylated (p)FOXO3-S294 levels. Conversely, overexpression of ERK-resistant, mutant FOXO3 reduced increases in UMUC3 cell migration and invasion, including that mediated by TP agonist (U46619). Additionally, stimulation of UMUC3 cells with U46619 increased pFOXO3-S294 expression, which could be attenuated by treatment with a TP antagonist (PTXA2) or ERK inhibitor (U0126). Initially U46619 caused nuclear accumulation of pFOXO3-S294; however, prolonged stimulation increased FOXO3 cytoplasmic localization. U46619 stimulation decreased overall FOXO3 transcriptional activity, but was associated with increased expression of its pro-survival target, manganese superoxide dismutase. The data also shows that TP stimulation increased the expression of the histone deacetylase, SIRT1, and corresponded with decreased acetylated-FOXO3. Collectively, the data suggest a role for TP signaling in the regulation of FOXO3 activity, mediated in part through phosphorylation and deacetylation. 
The human forkhead box A1 (FOXA1) and A2 (FOXA2) transcription factors have been found to control estrogen and androgen signaling through co-regulating target genes with sex hormone receptors. Here we used an integrative strategy to examine the hypothesis that genetic variants at FOXA1/2 binding elements may be associated with sexual dimorphism of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk. Firstly we extracted chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) data of FOXA1, FOXA2 and estrogen receptor 1(ERα) from ENCODE database to obtain dual target regions of FOXA/ERα, and further intersected these regions with genes' promoters. Then we used MATCH program to predict FOXA binding elements, in which genetic variants were retrieved by dbSNP database (NCBI, build 134). A total of 15 candidate variants were identified in this stage. Secondly we performed a case-control study with 1,081 HCC patients and 2,008 matched controls and found a significant association of SERPINA6-rs1998056 with female HCC risk under common genetic models (e.g. GG versus CC: OR = 2.03, 95% CI = 1.26-3.27, P = 0.004). Moreover, results from our real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using 72 normal liver tissues adjacent to the tumors showed that SERPINA6 expression was significantly different among different genotypes of this variant (GG versus CC: P = 0.032; Group test: P = 0.060). In summary, our study suggested that SERPINA6-rs1998056 regulated by FOXA/ERα might be associated with female HCC risk.
Whole-lung scaffolds can be created by perfusion decellularization of cadaveric donor lungs. The resulting matrices can then be recellularized to regenerate functional organs. This study evaluated the capacity of acellular lung scaffolds to support recellularization with lung progenitors derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).
Whole rat and human lungs were decellularized by constant-pressure perfusion with 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate solution. Resulting lung scaffolds were cryosectioned into slices or left intact. Human iPSCs were differentiated to definitive endoderm, anteriorized to a foregut fate, and then ventralized to a population expressing NK2 homeobox 1 (Nkx2.1). Cells were seeded onto slices and whole lungs, which were maintained under constant perfusion biomimetic culture. Lineage specification was assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescent staining. Regenerated left lungs were transplanted in an orthotopic position.
Activin-A treatment, followed by transforming growth factor-β inhibition, induced differentiation of human iPSCs to anterior foregut endoderm as confirmed by forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2), SRY (Sex Determining Region Y)-Box 17 (SOX17), and SOX2 expression. Cells cultured on decellularized lung slices demonstrated proliferation and lineage commitment after 5 days. Cells expressing Nkx2.1 were identified at 40% to 60% efficiency. Within whole-lung scaffolds and under perfusion culture, cells further upregulated Nkx2.1 expression. After orthotopic transplantation, grafts were perfused and ventilated by host vasculature and airways.
Decellularized lung matrix supports the culture and lineage commitment of human iPSC-derived lung progenitor cells. Whole-organ scaffolds and biomimetic culture enable coseeding of iPSC-derived endothelial and epithelial progenitors and enhance early lung fate. Orthotopic transplantation may enable further in vivo graft maturation.
The forkhead box transcription factor A2 (FOXA2) is a member of the hepatocyte nuclear factor family and plays an important role in liver development and metabolic homeostasis, but its role in the metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been evaluated. In this study, we found that the expression of FOXA2 was decreased in 68.1% (49/72) of human HCC tissues compared with their paired non-cancerous adjacent tissues. Clinicopathological analysis revealed that reduced FOXA2 expression was correlated with aggressive characteristics (venous invasion, poor differentiation, high tumor node metastasis grade). FOXA2 level was even lower in portal vein tumor thrombus compared with primary tumor tissues and correlated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition in HCC cells. Overexpression of FOXA2 inhibited migration and invasion of Focus cells, whereas knockdown of FOXA2 in HepG2 showed the opposite effect. Moreover, upregulation of FOXA2 suppressed HCC metastasis to bone, brain and lung in two distinct mouse models. Finally, we proved that FOXA2 repressed the transcription of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and exerted its antimetastasis effect partially through downregulation of MMP-9. In conclusion, our findings indicate that FOXA2 plays a critical role in HCC metastasis and may serve as a novel therapeutic target for HCC. 
The transcription factor forkhead box A2 (FOXA2) plays a central role in the development of endoderm-derived organs. It has been reported that FOXA2 acts as a suppressor in many kinds of tumor. However, little is known about the role of FOXA2 in gastric cancer.
The expression of FOXA2 in gastric cancer tissue samples from 89 patients was assessed by immunohistochemistry, and the clinicopathological characteristics of the samples were analyzed. The human gastric cancer cell line, BGC-823, was used to investigate the effects of FOXA2 in gastric cancer in vitro and in vivo and the potential mechanism involved was explored.
FOXA2 expression in human gastric cancer cell lines and human gastric cancer tissues was lower compared with the normal gastric epithelium cell line GES1 and normal adult gastric tissues, respectively. Patients with high FOXA2 expression level had longer 5-year overall survival than those with low FOXA2 expression level. FOXA2 markedly inhibited growth of BGC-823 cells accompanied with the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Infection of BGC-823 cells by FOXA2 lentivirus resulted in reduced cell tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, expression of Mucin 5AC was up-regulated along with increased expression of exogenous FOXA2 in BGC-823 cells; in contrast, dedifferentiation markers, BMI, CD54 and CD24, were down-regulated.
These results suggest that FOXA2 induces the differentiation of gastric cancer and highlight FOXA2 as a novel therapeutic target and prognostic marker for human gastric cancer.
Higher order chromatin structures across the genome are maintained in part by the architectural proteins CCCTC binding factor (CTCF) and the cohesin complex, which co-localize at many sites across the genome. Here, we examine the role of these proteins in mediating chromatin structure at the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. CFTR encompasses nearly 200 kb flanked by CTCF-binding enhancer-blocking insulator elements and is regulated by cell-type-specific intronic enhancers, which loop to the promoter in the active locus. SiRNA-mediated depletion of CTCF or the cohesin component, RAD21, showed that these two factors have distinct roles in regulating the higher order organization of CFTR. CTCF mediates the interactions between CTCF/cohesin binding sites, some of which have enhancer-blocking insulator activity. Cohesin shares this tethering role, but in addition stabilizes interactions between the promoter and cis-acting intronic elements including enhancers, which are also dependent on the forkhead box A1/A2 (FOXA1/A2) transcription factors (TFs). Disruption of the three-dimensional structure of the CFTR gene by depletion of CTCF or RAD21 increases gene expression, which is accompanied by alterations in histone modifications and TF occupancy across the locus, and causes internalization of the gene from the nuclear periphery. 
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are thought to play important roles in regulating gene transcription, but few have well-defined expression patterns or known biological functions during mammalian development. Using a conservative pipeline to identify lncRNAs that have important biological functions, we identified 363 lncRNAs in the lung and foregut endoderm. Importantly, we show that these lncRNAs are spatially correlated with transcription factors across the genome. In-depth expression analyses of lncRNAs with genomic loci adjacent to the critical transcription factors Nkx2.1, Gata6, Foxa2 (forkhead box a2), and Foxf1 mimic the expression patterns of their protein-coding neighbor. Loss-of-function analysis demonstrates that two lncRNAs, LL18/NANCI (Nkx2.1-associated noncoding intergenic RNA) and LL34, play distinct roles in endoderm development by controlling expression of critical developmental transcription factors and pathways, including retinoic acid signaling. In particular, we show that LL18/NANCI acts upstream of Nkx2.1 and downstream from Wnt signaling to regulate lung endoderm gene expression. These studies reveal that lncRNAs play an important role in foregut and lung endoderm development by regulating multiple aspects of gene transcription, often through regulation of transcription factor expression. 
Forkhead Box A2 (FOXA2) exerts an influence on glucose homeostasis via activity in the liver. In addition, a key genome-wide association study (GWAS) recently demonstrated that genetic variation, namely rs6048205, at the FOXA2 locus is robustly associated with fasting glucose levels. Our hypothesis was that this DNA-binding protein regulates the expression of a set of molecular pathways critical to endocrine traits.
Drawing on our laboratory and bioinformatic experience with chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel sequencing, we analyzed our existing FOXA2 chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel sequencing data generated in human liver, using the algorithm hypergeometric optimization of motif enrichment, to gain insight into its global genomic binding pattern from a disease perspective.
We performed a pathway analysis of the gene list using the gene set enrichment analysis algorithm, which yielded a number of significant annotations. Motivated by the fact that the FOXA2 locus has been implicated by GWAS, we cross-referenced the occupancy sites with the National Institutes of Health GWAS catalog and found strong evidence for the enrichment of loci implicated in endocrine, neuropsychiatric, cardiovascular, and cancer trait categories, but interestingly there was no evidence for enrichment for inflammation related traits. Intriguingly, a FOXA2 occupancy site coincided with rs6048205, suggesting that this variant confers its effect, at least partially, via a perturbation of a FOXA2 feedback mechanism.
Our data strongly suggest that FOXA2 is acting as a master regulator of key pathways that are enriched for loci implicated by GWAS for most trait categories, with the clear exception of inflammation, suggesting that this factor exerts its effect in this context via noninflammatory processes.
Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) is up-regulated by glucose and diabetes and plays a critical role in glucotoxicity, inflammation, and beta-cell apoptosis, whereas we have found that TXNIP deficiency protects against diabetes. Interestingly, human islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) is also induced by glucose, aggregates into insoluble amyloid fibrils found in islets of most individuals with type 2 diabetes and promotes inflammation and beta-cell cytotoxicity. However, so far no connection between TXNIP and IAPP signaling had been reported. Using TXNIP gain and loss of function experiments, INS-1 beta-cells and beta-cell-specific Txnip knock-out mice, we now found that TXNIP regulates IAPP expression. Promoter analyses and chromatin-immunoprecipitation assays further demonstrated that TXNIP increases IAPP expression at the transcriptional level, and we discovered that TXNIP-induced FoxA2 (forkhead box A2) transcription factor expression was conferring this effect by promoting FoxA2 enrichment at the proximal FoxA2 site in the IAPP promoter. Moreover, we found that TXNIP down-regulates miR-124a expression, a microRNA known to directly target FoxA2. Indeed, miR-124a overexpression led to decreased FoxA2 expression and IAPP promoter occupancy and to a significant reduction in IAPP mRNA and protein expression and also effectively inhibited TXNIP-induced IAPP expression. Thus, our studies have identified a novel TXNIP/miR-124a/FoxA2/IAPP signaling cascade linking the critical beta-cell signaling pathways of TXNIP and IAPP and thereby provide new mechanistic insight into an important aspect of transcriptional regulation and beta-cell biology. 
Interleukin-13 (IL-13) plays a critical role in asthma mucus overproduction, while the mechanisms underlying this process are not fully elucidated. Previous studies showed that nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) is involved in the pathogenesis of asthma, but whether it can directly regulate IL-13-induced mucus (particularly MUC5AC) production is still not clear. Here we showed that IL-13 specifically induced NFAT3 activation through promoting its dephosphorylation in air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures of mouse tracheal epithelial cells (mTECs). Furthermore, both Cyclosporin A (CsA, a specific NFAT inhibitor) and LY294002 (a Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor) significantly blocked IL-13-induced MUC5AC mRNA and protein production through the inhibition of NFAT3 activity. We also confirmed that CsA could not influence the forkhead Box A2 (Foxa2) and mouse calcium dependent chloride channel 3 (mClca3) expression in IL-13-induced MUC5AC production, which both are known to be important in IL-13-stimulated mucus expression. Our study is the first to demonstrate that the PI3K-NFAT3 pathway is positively involved in IL-13-induced mucus production, and provided novel insights into the molecular mechanism of asthma mucus hypersecretion. 
The forkhead box A transcription factors, FOXA1 and FOXA2, function as pioneer factors to open condensed chromatin and facilitate binding of other proteins. We showed previously that these factors are key components of a transcriptional network that drives enhancer function at the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) locus in intestinal epithelial cells. The CFTR promoter apparently lacks tissue-specific regulatory elements and expression of the gene is controlled by multiple cis-acting elements, which coordinate gene expression in different cell types. Here we show that concurrent depletion of FOXA1 and FOXA2 represses CFTR expression and alters the three-dimensional architecture of the active locus by diminishing interactions between the promoter and intronic cis-acting elements. Reduction of FOXA1/A2 also modifies the enrichment profile of the active enhancer marks H3K27ac and H3K4me2 across the CFTR locus and alters chromatin accessibility at individual cis-elements. Moreover, loss of FOXA1/A2 suppresses the recruitment of other members of the transcriptional network including HNF1 and CDX2, to multiple cis-elements. These data reveal a complex molecular mechanism underlying the role of FOXA1/A2 in achieving high levels of CFTR expression in intestinal epithelial cells. 
In the present study, we describe forkhead box O3 (FOXO3)-specific, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells existent among peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of cancer patients. FOXO3 immunogenicity appears specific, as we did not detect reactivity toward FOXO3 among T cells in healthy individuals. FOXO3 may naturally serve as a target antigen for tumor-reactive T cells as it is frequently over-expressed in cancer cells. In addition, expression of FOXO3 plays a critical role in immunosuppression mediated by tumor-associated dendritic cells (TADCs). Indeed, FOXO3-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were able to specifically recognize and kill both FOXO3-expressing cancer cells as well as dendritic cells. Thus, FOXO3 was processed and presented by HLA-A2 on the cell surface of both immune cells and cancer cells. As FOXO3 programs TADCs to become tolerogenic, FOXO3 signaling thereby comprises a significant immunosuppressive mechanism, such that FOXO3 targeting by means of specific T cells is an attractive clinical therapy to boost anticancer immunity. In addition, the natural occurrence of FOXO3-specific CTLs in the periphery suggests that these T cells hold a function in the complex network of immune regulation in cancer patients.
Forkhead box A2 (Foxa2) has been recognized as one of the most potent transcriptional activators that is implicated in the control of feeding behavior and energy homeostasis. However, similar researches about the effects of genetic variations of Foxa2 gene on growth traits are lacking. Therefore, this study detected Foxa2 gene polymorphisms by DNA pool sequencing, PCR-RFLP and PCR-ACRS methods in 822 individuals from three Chinese cattle breeds. The results showed that four sequence variants (SVs) were screened, including two mutations (SV1, g. 7005 C&gt;T and SV2, g. 7044 C&gt;G) in intron 4, one mutation (SV3, g. 8449 A&gt;G) in exon 5 and one mutation (SV4, g. 8537 T&gt;C) in the 3'UTR. Notably, association analysis of the single mutations with growth traits in total individuals (at 24months) revealed that significant statistical difference was found in four SVs, and SV4 locus was highly significantly associated with growth traits throughout all three breeds (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01). Meanwhile, haplotype combination CCCCAGTC also indicated remarkably associated to better chest girth and body weight in Jiaxian Red cattle (P&lt;0.05). We herein described a comprehensive study on the variability of bovine Foxa2 gene that was predictive of molecular markers in cattle breeding for the first time. 
Inguinal hernia is a common disease, most cases of which are indirect inguinal hernia (IIH). Genetic factors play an important role for inguinal hernia. Increased incidences of inguinal hernia have been reported in patients with 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome, which is mainly caused by TBX1 gene mutations. Thus, we hypothesized that altered TBX1 gene expression may contribute to IIH development. In this study, the human TBX1 gene promoter was genetically analyzed in children with IIH (n=100) and ethnic-matched controls (n=167). Functions of DNA sequence variants (DSVs) within the TBX1 gene promoter were examined in cultured human fibroblast cells. The results showed that two heterozygous DSVs were found, both of which were single nucleotide polymorphisms. One DSV, g.4248 C&gt;T (rs41298629), was identified in a 2-year-old boy with right-sided IIH, but not in all controls, which significantly decreased TBX1 gene promoter activity. Another DSV, g.4199 C&gt;T (rs41260844), was found in both IIH patients and controls with similar frequencies (P&gt;0.05), which did not affect TBX1 gene promoter activity. Collectively, our data suggested that the DSV within the TBX1 gene promoter may change TBX1 level, contributing to IIH development as a rare risk factor. Underlying molecular mechanisms need to be established. 
MicroRNAs (miRs) are promising new therapeutics for glioblastoma. However, which miRs are most effective against glioblastomas and how these miRs should be delivered are major unanswered problems.
To identify potent antiglioma miRs, we selected 8 miRs based on a literature search and screened them against a panel of glioma stem cell (GSC) lines, representing all of the glioblastoma subtypes defined by The Cancer Genome Atlas. To address delivery, we tested the hypothesis that ex vivo cultured bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can package miRs into exosomes and that these engineered exosomes can systemically deliver antiglioma miRs to glioblastomas.
Of the screened miRs, we identified miR-124a as the most effective antiglioma agent against GSCs. We then transduced MSCs with lentivirus vectors containing miR-124a and isolated vesicles from the medium. Electron microscopy, western blotting, and Nanosight proved that the isolated vesicles were exosomes. Quantitative PCR documented that these exosomes contained high levels of miR-124a, which was not present in control exosomes. In vitro treatment of GSCs with exosomes containing miR-124a (Exo-miR124) resulted in a significant reduction in viability and clonogenicity of GSCs compared with controls. In vivo treatment of mice harboring intracranial GSC267 with systemically delivered Exo-miR124 resulted in 50% of animals living long term. No evidence of tumor was present on histological analysis of the survivors. Mechanistic studies showed that miR-124a acts by silencing Forkhead box (FOX)A2, resulting in aberrant intracellular lipid accumulation.
MSCs can be used as natural biofactories to produce Exo-miR124, which is an effective antiglioma agent worthy of further clinical evaluation.
Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (soluble) (PCK1) is a key gene in gluconeogenesis and glyceroneogenesis. Although its functions have been extensively studied in mice, bats and humans, little is known in ducks. Here, PCK1 functions were studied using a duck domestication model and a 48-h fasting experiment. We found PCK1 expression significantly decreased in two breeds of domestic ducks (Jinyun Pockmark ducks and Cherry Valley ducks) as compared with wild ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). Simultaneously, plasma levels of glucose, triglycerides and free fatty acid in domestic ducks were lower than in wild ducks. When compared with fed ducks, the plasma triglyceride level was observed to be significantly decreased, while the glucose and free fatty acid levels remained constant in 48-h fasting ducks. The expression analysis of gluconeogenic genes revealed that fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase genes (FBP1 and FBP2) and the glucose-6-phosphatase gene (G6PC2) were not changed, whereas PCK1 was significantly upregulated. In addition, the reported regulators of PCK1, including forkhead box A2 (FOXA2) gene and orphan nuclear receptor NR4A family genes (NR4A1, NR4A2 and NR4A3), exhibited similar expression levels between 48-h fasting ducks and fed ducks, suggesting that PCK1 is not regulated by these genes in the duck under fasting conditions. In conclusion, PCK1 expression may affect plasma levels of glucose, triglycerides and free fatty acid during the duck domestication process. This work demonstrates for the first time in duck that PCK1 is a key gene in maintaining plasma glucose homeostasis during fasting and that the upregulated expression of PCK1 may be responsible for constant plasma free fatty acid level by the glyceroneogenesis process.
Sonic hedgehog (SHH) is abundantly expressed and critical for morphogenesis in embryonic lungs; however, SHH expression drops to a much lower level in mice from E17.5 and in humans from the 21st gestational week. We find that SHH expression is robustly upregulated in the airway epithelia of children with asthma or mouse models with allergic airway disease. Specifically, airway-specific SMO loss of function significantly suppresses allergen-induced goblet cell phenotypes, whereas an airway-specific SMO gain of function markedly enhances the goblet cell phenotypes in mouse models with allergic airway disease. Notably, intratracheal administration with SHH-neutralizing antibody or cyclopamine robustly attenuates goblet cell phenotypes in mouse models with allergic airway disease. Finally, we identify that Muc5AC gene encoding MUC5AC mucin serves as a direct target of GLI transcriptional factors in response to SHH, whereas the SAM-pointed domain-containing ETS transcription factor and Forkhead box A2, critical transcriptional factors for goblet cell phenotypes, both function as the effectors of GLIs in response to SHH stimulation. Together, the upregulation of SHH expression in allergic bronchial epithelia contributes to goblet cell metaplasia; thus, blockage of SHH signaling is a rational approach in a therapeutic intervention of epithelial remodeling in chronic airway diseases.
Ultraviolet (UV) light generates two major DNA lesions: cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and pyrimidine-(6-4)-pyrimidone photoproducts (6-4PPs), but the specific participation of these two lesions in the deleterious effects of UV is a longstanding question. In order to discriminate the precise role of unrepaired CPDs and 6-4PPs in UV-induced responses triggering cell death, human fibroblasts were transduced by recombinant adenoviruses carrying the CPD-photolyase or 6-4PP-photolyase cDNAs. Both photolyases were able to prevent UV-induced apoptosis in cells deficient for nucleotide excision repair (NER) to a similar extent, while in NER-proficient cells UV-induced apoptosis was prevented only by CPD-photolyase, with no effects observed when 6-4PPs were removed by the specific photolyase. These results strongly suggest that both CPDs and 6-4PPs contribute to UV-induced apoptosis in NER-deficient cells, while in NER-proficient cells, CPDs are the only lesions responsible for UV-killing, probably due to the rapid repair of 6-4PPs by NER. As a consequence, the difference in skin photosensitivity, including carcinogenesis, of most of the xeroderma pigmentosum patients and of normal people is probably not only a quantitative aspect, but depends on the type of DNA damage induced by sunlight and its rate of repair.
The influence of low-activity NER genotypes (XPC PAT-/+, XPA-A23G, XPD Asp312Asn, XPD Lys751Gln) and GSTM1 (active or null) was evaluated on anti-benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide-(B[a]PDE)-DNA adduct formed in the lymphocyte plus monocyte fraction (LMF). The sample population consisted of 291 healthy subjects with low exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (B[a]P) through their smoking (n=126 smokers) or dietary habits (n=165 non-smokers with high (&gt;or=52 times/year) consumption of charcoaled meat or pizza). The bulky anti-B[a]PDE-DNA adduct levels were detected by HPLC/fluorescence analysis and genotypes by PCR. Anti-B[a]PDE-DNA was present (&gt;or=0.5 adducts/10(8) nucleotides) in 163 (56%) subjects (median (range) 0.77 (0.125-32.0) adducts/10(8) nucleotides), with smokers showing a significantly higher adduct level than non-smokers with high consumption of PAH-rich meals (P&lt;0.01). Our exposed-sample population with unfavourable XPC PAT+/- or +/+ and GSTM1 null genotypes has the significantly highest adduct level (P&lt;0.01). Taking into account tobacco smoke and diet as sources of exposure to B[a]P, low-activity XPC PAT+ shows a major role in smokers (P&lt;0.05) and GSTM1 null in non-smokers with frequent consumption of PAH-rich meals (P&lt;0.01). The modulation of anti-B[a]PDE-DNA adduct in the LMF by GSTM1 null and low-activity XPC PAT+ polymorphisms may be considered as potential genetic susceptibility factors that can modify individual responses to low PAH (B[a]P) genotoxic exposure, with the consequent risk of cancer in the general population.
We have detected frequent alternative splicing of a gene that encodes NER, a protein homologous to the retinoic acid receptors, in cancer cells. Western and immunohistochemical analyses disclosed accumulation of a large amount of the aberrant NER product, generated by alternative splicing that caused skipping of an exon corresponding to the DNA-binding domain, in the nucleoli of cells of cancer cell lines and primary cancer tissues. The aberrant protein was detected in 116 of 228 primary cancers developed in various tissues including breast and colon, but was absent in the corresponding normal tissues; it was also detected in 31 of 39 cancer cell lines. This observation may imply that the aberrant NER product has some relation to the development and/or progression of cancers in a variety of human tissues.
Prostate cancer is a common malignancy that disproportionately affects African-American men. Environmental factors and variation in genes responsible for chemical and dietary carcinogen metabolism and DNA damage repair may modulate risk. Fourteen single nucleotide polymorphisms in NAT2 and four NER genes (ERCC1, XPF/ERCC4, XPG/ERCC5 and CSB/ERCC6) were genotyped in a case-control study of 254 African-American prostate cancer cases and 301 healthy controls from Washington, DC. Smoking status, BMI, age and genetic ancestry were included as covariates in the association analyses. We found that individuals homozygous for the XPG/ERCC5 -72C/T promoter polymorphism had a significant reduction in risk, for prostate cancer (OR=0.12; 95% CI=0.03-0.48). A haplotype trend regression test also revealed a protective effect for the haplotype bearing the T allele (P=0.003). In silica analyses suggest a functional implication for the promoter variant since it deletes a GCF transcriptional factor-binding site responsible for the downregulation of transcription. The protective effect of the promoter SNP on risk for prostate cancer was independent of smoking. In contrast, none of the SNPs typed for NAT2, ERCC1, ERCC4 and ERCC6 showed significant association with risk. Additional tests for genotype interactions were not significant. We note that there may be other factors, such as dietary exposures, which may modulate prostate cancer risk in combination with genetic variation within the NAT2 and NER genes. Our results, in combination with previous observations of LOH for ERCC5 in prostate tumors, provide further evidence for a role of XPG/ERCC5 in the etiology of prostate cancer.
LXR and PPAR receptors belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcriptional activating factors. Using ligand-dependent transcription assays, we found that 5-tetradecyloxy-2-furancarboxylic acid (TOFA) transactivates chimeric receptors composed of the glucocorticoid receptor DNA binding domain and the ligand binding regions of PPARalpha, PPARbeta (NUC-1) and LXRbeta (NER) receptors. In the same assays, ligands for PPARs (oleic acid, WY-14643 and L-631,033) and LXRs (hydroxycholesterols) maintain their respective receptor selectivity. TOFA and hydroxycholesterols also stimulate transcription from a minimal fibrinogen promoter that is under the control of AP-1 or NF-kappaB transcription factor binding sites. In addition to their effects on transcription, these LXRbeta activators induce neuronal differentiation in rat pheochromocytoma cells. TOFA and the natural LXR agonist, 22 (R)-hydroxycholesterol, stimulate neurite outgrowth in 55 and 28% of cells, respectively. No neurite outgrowth was induced by the related 22(S)-hydroxycholesterol, which does not activate the LXR family. These results suggest that the hydroxycholesterol signaling pathway has a complex effect on transcription that mediates the activity of TOFA and hydroxycholesterol on neuronal differentiation in pheochromocytoma cells.
Excision repair cross complementing gene 1 (ERCC1) associated with xeroderma pigmentosum group F (XPF) is a heterodimeric endonuclease historically involved in the excision of bulky helix-distorting DNA lesions during nucleotide excision repair (NER) but also in the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks. ERCC1 deficient mice show severe growth retardation associated with premature replicative senescence leading to liver failure and death at four weeks of age. In humans, ERCC1 is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma and in the late G1 phase of hepatocyte cell cycle. To investigate whether ERCC1 could be involved in human hepatocyte cell growth and cell cycle progression, we knocked-down ERCC1 expression in the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Huh7 by RNA interference. ERCC1 knocked-down cells were delayed in their cell cycle and became multinucleated. This phenotype was rescued by ERCC1 overexpression. Multinucleation was not liver specific since it also occurred in HeLa and in human fibroblasts knocked-down for ERCC1. Multinucleated cells arose after drastic defects leading to flawed metaphase and cytokinesis. Interestingly, multinucleation did not appear after knocking-down other NER enzymes such as XPC and XPF, suggesting that NER deficiency was not responsible for multinucleation. Moreover, XPF mutant human fibroblasts formed multinucleated cells after ERCC1 knock-down but not after XPF knock-down. Therefore our results seem consistent with ERCC1 being involved in multinucleation but not XPF. This work reveals a new role for ERCC1 distinct from its known function in DNA repair, which may be independent of XPF. The role for ERCC1 in mitotic progression may be critical during development, particularly in humans.
S23906 belongs to a novel class of alkylating anticancer agents forming bulky monofunctional DNA adducts. A unique feature of S23906 is its "helicase-like" activity leading to the destabilization of the surrounding duplex DNA. We here characterize the recognition and repair of S23906 adducts by the nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery. All NER-deficient human cell lines tested showed increased sensitivity to S23906, which was particularly pronounced for cells deficient in XPC, CSB and XPA. In comparison, deficiencies in ERCC1 or XPF had lesser impact on the sensitivity to S23906. The sensitivity was, at least in part, linked to the conversion of unrepaired adducts into toxic DNA strand breaks as shown by single cell electrophoresis and gamma-H2AX formation. The pharmacological relevance of these findings was confirmed by the characterization of KB carcinoma cells with acquired S23906 resistance. These cells showed increased NER activity in vivo as well as toward damaged plasmid DNA in vitro. In particular, both global genome NER, as shown by unscheduled DNA synthesis, and transcription-coupled NER, as shown by transcriptional recovery, were up-regulated in the S23906-resistant cells. The increased NER activity was accompanied by up to 5-fold up-regulation of XPC, CSB and XPA proteins without detectable alterations of ERCC1 on the DNA, RNA or protein levels. Our results suggest that S23906 adducts are recognized and repaired by both NER sub-pathways in contrast to other members of this class, that are only recognized by transcription-coupled NER. We further show that NER activity can be up-regulated without changes in ERCC1 expression.
Genetic instability is a hallmark of cancer; the hypoxic tumor microenvironment has been implicated as a cause of this phenomenon. MicroRNAs (miR) are small nonprotein coding RNAs that can regulate various cellular pathways. We report here that two miRs, miR-210 and miR-373, are up-regulated in a hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha-dependent manner in hypoxic cells. Bioinformatics analyses suggested that these miRs could regulate factors implicated in DNA repair pathways. Forced expression of miR-210 was found to suppress the levels of RAD52, which is a key factor in homology-dependent repair (HDR); the forced expression of miR-373 led to a reduction in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) protein, RAD23B, as well as in RAD52. Consistent with these results, both RAD52 and RAD23B were found to be down-regulated in hypoxia, but in both cases, the hypoxia-induced down-regulation could be partially reversed by antisense inhibition of miR-210 and miR-373. Importantly, luciferase reporter assays indicated that miR-210 is capable of interacting with the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of RAD52 and that miR-373 can act on the 3' UTR of RAD23B. These results indicate that hypoxia-inducible miR-210 and miR-373 play roles in modulating the expression levels of key proteins involved in the HDR and NER pathways, providing new mechanistic insight into the effect of hypoxia on DNA repair and genetic instability in cancer.
Repair of oxidative DNA damage, particularly Base Excision Repair (BER), impairment is often associated with Alzheimer's disease pathology. Here, we aimed at investigating the complete Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER), a DNA repair pathway involved in the removal of bulky DNA adducts, status in an Alzheimer-like cell line. The level of DNA damage was quantified using mass spectrometry, NER gene expression was assessed by qPCR, and the NER protein activity was analysed through a modified version of the COMET assay. Interestingly, we found that in the presence of the Amyloid β peptide (Aβ), NER factors were upregulated at the mRNA level and that NER capacities were also specifically increased following oxidative stress. Surprisingly, NER capacities were not differentially improved following a typical NER-triggering of ultraviolet C (UVC) stress. Oxidative stress generates a differential and specific DNA damage response in the presence of Aβ. We hypothesized that the release of NER components such as DNA damage binding protein 2 (DDB2) and Xeroderma Pigmentosum complementation group C protein (XPC) following oxidative stress might putatively involve their apoptotic role rather than DNA repair function. 
Ubiquitylation of histones plays a pivotal role in DNA repair. The ubiquitin ligase Ring2 was recently shown to be the dominant ubiquitin ligase of histone H2A. In a series of experiments using the human bronchial epithelia cells (16HBE) and small interfering RNA (siRNA)-Ring2 cells exposed to benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), we measured dynamic changes in the levels of DNA damage, expressions of ubiquitinated histone H2A, and nucleotide excision repair (NER) subunit xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) groups A, C, and F (XPA, XPC, XPF). We found that in vitro exposure to BaP increased DNA damage in a time- and dose-dependent manner in 16HBE and siRNA-Ring2 cells. The results show that although decrease of Ring2 causes DNA hypersensitivity to BaP, the levels of XPA, XPC, and XPF were not affected. These results indicated that Ring2 may effect the DNA repair through other pathways but not through the expressions of NER protein.
Cholesterol is required in the brain for synaptogenesis and its turnover is critical for cerebral functions. Several proteins involved in cholesterol handling and metabolism are transcriptionally regulated by the nuclear liver X receptor (LXR) alpha and beta. Sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27) is a ubiquitously expressed enzyme involved in cholesterol metabolism. Notably, its deficiency causes a disease characterized by progressive neurologic impairment. With the final goal to understand the pathophysiological role of CYP27A1 in the CNS, we studied the expression pattern of Cyp27a1 and other related genes in primary cultures of rat glia and neurons. Secondly, given the pivotal role of LXR in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis, we investigated the effects of its activation on the expression of Cyp27a1.We found that primary astrocytes express different sterol hydroxylases and are able to uptake exogenous 27-hydroxycholesterol. We found that both microglia and astrocytes express preferentially Lxrbeta. However, despite this similarity, we observed cell-specific responsiveness of known and novel (including Cyp27a1) target genes to LXR activation. The increase of mRNA and protein levels in treated astrocytes is paralleled by transactivation of the proximal Cyp27a1 promoter in transfected astrocytes. We suggest that the astrocyte-restricted up-regulation of Cyp27a1 may be ascribable to differential expression of transcriptional co-activators. Given the role of astrocytes in maintaining brain homeostasis, we hypothesize that impairment of CYP27 activity in these cells may alter critical features of the astrocytes, from the handling and delivery of cholesterol to neurons to the release of signaling molecules.
Huntington's disease is caused by expansion of a polyglutamine tract found in the amino-terminal of the ubiquitously expressed protein huntingtin. Well studied in its mutant form, huntingtin has a wide variety of normal functions, loss of which may also contribute to disease progression. Widespread transcriptional dysfunction occurs in brains of Huntington's disease patients and in transgenic mouse and cell models of Huntington's disease.
To identify new transcriptional pathways altered by the normal and/or abnormal function of huntingtin, we probed several nuclear receptors, normally expressed in the brain, for binding to huntingtin in its mutant and wild-type forms.
Wild-type huntingtin could bind to a number of nuclear receptors; LXRalpha, PPARgamma, VDR and TRalpha1. Over-expression of huntingtin activated, while knockout of huntingtin decreased, LXR mediated transcription of a reporter gene. Loss of huntingtin also decreased expression of the LXR target gene, ABCA1. In vivo, huntingtin deficient zebrafish had a severe phenotype and reduced expression of LXR regulated genes. An LXR agonist was able to partially rescue the phenotype and the expression of LXR target genes in huntingtin deficient zebrafish during early development.
Our data suggest a novel function for wild-type huntingtin as a co-factor of LXR. However, this activity is lost by mutant huntingtin that only interacts weakly with LXR.
The Liver X Receptor (LXR) alpha and beta isoforms are members of the type II nuclear receptor family which function as a heterodimer with the Retinoid X Receptor (RXR). Upon agonist binding, the formation of the LXR/RXR heterodimer takes place and ultimately the regulation of a number of genes begins. The LXR isoforms share 77% sequence homology, with LXRalpha having highest expression in liver, intestine, adipose tissue, and macrophages and LXRbeta being ubiquitously expressed. The aim of this article is to review the reported medicinal chemistry strategies towards the optimisation of novel non-steroidal chemotypes as LXR agonists. An analysis of the structural features important for LXR ligand binding will be given, utilising both structural activity relationship data obtained from LXR assays as well as X-ray co-crystallographic data obtained with LXR ligands and the LXR ligand binding domain (LBD). The X-ray co-crystallographic data analysis will detail the key structural interactions required for LXR binding/agonist activity and reveal the differences observed between chemotype classes. It has been postulated that a LXRbeta selective compound may have a beneficial outcome on the lipid profile for a ligand by dissociating the favourable and unfavourable effects of LXR agonists. Whilst there have been a few examples of compounds showing a modest level of LXRalpha selectivity, obtaining a potent LXRbeta selective compound has been more challenging. Analysis of the SAR and X-ray co-crystallographic data suggests that the rational design of a LXRbeta selective compound will not be trivial.
We characterized the expression pattern of the nuclear receptors liver X receptor (LXR) alpha and beta during mouse embryonic development and in adulthood by in situ hybridization experiments. LXRalpha and LXRbeta are detected in the liver starting at 11.5 days postcoitum. Later, LXRalpha expression remains high in organs involved in lipid homeostasis, such as liver, intestine, and brown adipose tissue, whereas LXRbeta is more ubiquitously expressed and enriched in tissues of neuronal and endocrine origin.
The liver X receptors alpha and beta are orphan nuclear receptors that are key regulators in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis. Originally they were found to play an important role in reverse cholesterol transport, a pathway for the removal of excess cellular cholesterol. However several groups have now shown that the liver X receptors also functions in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, cellular differentiation, apoptosis and many immune responses. Tissue distribution of the two paralogues differs with liver X receptor beta ubiquitously expressed, while liver X receptor alpha is confined to the liver, kidney, intestine, spleen, adipose tissue, macrophages and skeletal muscle. The endogenous ligands for the liver X receptors are certain oxidized derivatives of cholesterol, the oxysterols. Upon activation by oxysterols, the receptors form obligate heterodimers with retinoid X receptors alpha, beta and gamma; and become competent to activate the transcription of target genes.
Overexpression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) in β cells causes impaired insulin secretion and β cell dysfunction associated with diminished pancreatic duodenal homeodomain transcription factor-1 (PDX-1) expression in vitro and in vivo. To identify the molecular mechanism responsible for this effect, the mouse Pdx-1 gene promoter (2.7 kb) was analyzed in β cell and non-β cell lines. Despite no apparent sterol regulatory element-binding protein-binding sites, the Pdx-1 promoter was suppressed by SREBP-1c in β cells in a dose-dependent manner. PDX-1 activated its own promoter. The E-box (-104/-99 bp) in the proximal region, occupied by ubiquitously expressed upstream stimulatory factors (USFs), was crucial for the PDX-1-positive autoregulatory loop through direct PDX-1·USF binding. This positive feedback activation was a prerequisite for SREBP-1c suppression of the promoter in non-β cells. SREBP-1c and PDX-1 directly interact through basic helix-loop-helix and homeobox domains, respectively. This robust SREBP-1c·PDX-1 complex interferes with PDX-1·USF formation and inhibits the recruitment of PDX-1 coactivators. SREBP-1c also inhibits PDX-1 binding to the previously described PDX-1-binding site (-2721/-2646 bp) in the distal enhancer region of the Pdx-1 promoter. Endogenous up-regulation of SREBP-1c in INS-1 cells through the activation of liver X receptor and retinoid X receptor by 9-cis-retinoic acid and 22-hydroxycholesterol inhibited PDX-1 mRNA and protein expression. Conversely, SREBP-1c RNAi restored Pdx-1 mRNA and protein levels. Through these multiple mechanisms, SREBP-1c, when induced in a lipotoxic state, repressed PDX-1 expression contributing to the inhibition of insulin expression and β cell dysfunction.
First discovered as orphan receptors, liver X receptors (LXRs) were subsequently identified as the nuclear receptor target of the cholesterol metabolites, oxysterols. There are 2 LXR receptors encoded by distinct genes: LXRalpha is most highly expressed in the liver, adipose, kidney, adrenal tissues, and macrophages and LXRbeta is ubiquitously expressed. Despite differential tissue distribution, these isoforms have 78% homology in their ligand-binding domain and appear to respond to the same endogenous ligands. Work over the past 10 years has shown that the LXR pathway regulates lipid metabolism and inflammation via both the induction and repression of target genes. Given the importance of cholesterol regulation and inflammation in the development of cardiovascular disease, it is not surprising that activation of the LXR pathway attenuates various mechanisms underlying atherosclerotic plaque development. In this brief review, we will discuss the impact of the LXR pathway on both cholesterol metabolism and atherosclerosis.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder, typified by the pathological accumulation of ß-amyloid peptides (Aß) and neurofibrillary tangles within the brain, culminating to cognitive impairment. Epidemiological and biochemical data have suggested a link between cholesterol content, APP (amyloid precursor protein) processing, Aß, inflammation and AD. The intricacy of the disease presents considerable challenges for the development of newer therapeutic agents. Liver X receptors (LXRa and LXRß) are oxysterol activated nuclear receptors that play essential role in lipid and glucose homeostasis, steroidogenesis and inflammatory responses. LXR signalling impacts the development of AD pathology through multiple pathways. Reports indicate that genetic loss of either lxra or lxrß in APP/PS1 transgenic mice results in increased amyloid plaque load. Studies also suggest that ligand activation of LXRs in Tg2576 mice enhanced, the expression of genes linked with cholesterol efflux e.g. apoe, abca-1, down regulated APP processing and Aß production with significant improvement in memory functions. LXR agonists have also depicted to inhibit neuroinflammation through modulation of microglial phagocytosis and by repressing the expression of cox2, mcp1 and iNos in glial cells. This review summarizes in brief the biology of LXRs, with an emphasis on their probable pathophysiological mechanisms that may elicit the defending role of these receptors in brains of AD patients.
L-Xylulose reductases belong to the superfamily of short chain dehydrogenases and reductases (SDRs) and catalyze the NAD(P)H-dependent reduction of L-xylulose to xylitol in L-arabinose and glucuronic acid catabolism. Here we report the identification of a novel L-xylulose reductase LXR3 in the fungus Trichoderma reesei by a bioinformatic approach in combination with a functional analysis. LXR3, a 31 kDa protein, catalyzes the reduction of L-xylulose to xylitol via NADPH and is also able to convert D-xylulose, D-ribulose, L-sorbose, and D-fructose to their corresponding polyols. Transcription of lxr3 is specifically induced by L-arabinose and L-arabitol. Deletion of lxr3 affects growth on L-arabinose and L-arabitol and reduces total NADPH-dependent LXR activity in cell free extracts. A phylogenetic analysis of known L-xylulose reductases shows that LXR3 is phylogenetically different from the Aspergillus niger L-xylulose reductase LxrA and, moreover, that all identified true L-xylulose reductases belong to different clades within the superfamily of SDRs. This indicates that the enzymes responsible for the reduction of L-xylulose in L-arabinose and glucuronic acid catabolic pathways have evolved independently and that even the fungal LXRs of the L-arabinose catabolic pathway have evolved in different clades of the superfamily of SDRs.
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c). In vitro, HIV impairs monocyte-macrophage cholesterol efflux, a major determinant of circulating HDL-c, by increasing ABCA1 degradation, with compensatory upregulation of ABCA1 messenger RNA (mRNA).
We examined expression of genes involved in cholesterol uptake, metabolism, and efflux in monocytes from 22 HIV-positive subjects on antiretroviral therapy (ART-Treated), 30 untreated HIV-positive subjects (ART-Naive), and 22 HIV-negative controls (HIV-Neg).
HDL-c was lower and expression of ABCA1 mRNA was higher in ART-Naive subjects than in both ART-Treated and HIV-Neg subjects (both P &lt; .01), with HDL-c inversely correlated with HIV RNA (ρ = -0.52; P &lt; .01). Expression of genes involved in cholesterol uptake (LDLR, CD36), synthesis (HMGCR), and regulation (SREBP2, LXRA) was significantly lower in both ART-Treated and ART-Naive subjects than in HIV-Neg controls.
In vivo, increased monocyte ABCA1 expression in untreated HIV-infected patients and normalization of ABCA1 expression with virological suppression by ART supports direct HIV-induced impairment of cholesterol efflux previously demonstrated in vitro. However, decreased expression of cholesterol sensing, uptake, and synthesis genes in both untreated and treated HIV infection suggests that both HIV and ART affect monocyte cholesterol metabolism in a pattern consistent with accumulation of intramonocyte cholesterol.
To investigate the effects of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway on skeletal muscle development and energy metabolism, AG490 and IL-11 were used as agonist and inhibitor in treating mice and the mouse skeletal muscle cells. Average body weight (ABW) was reduced significantly in the mice treated with AG490 (p&lt;0.05), while IL-11 had the opposite effect (p&lt;0.05), as compared with the controls, average body temperature (ABT) remained at normal levels in both groups. Western blotting was used to determine the protein levels of JAK2, STAT3, p-JAK2, and p-STAT3. AG490 caused significant decreases in p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 (p&lt;0.05), while IL-11 did the opposite (p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.01). Quantitative RT-PCR also showed significantly decreased expression levels of Myf5, MyoD, LXRa, and UCP3 in the AG490 group (p&lt;0.01), but in the IL-11 group, the expression of Myf5, MyoD, and UCP3 was increased (p&lt;0.05), except that LXRa whose expression did not change. In cultured skeletal muscle cells, the expression of MyoD, Myf5, LXRa, and UCP3 (p&lt;0.05) exhibited the same trend as that in the skeletal muscles of both treated groups (p&lt;0.05). These results implicate the JAK2/STAT3 in skeletal muscle development and energy metabolism.
Secretion of cholesterol into bile is important for the elimination of cholesterol from the body. Thyroid hormone (TH) increases biliary cholesterol secretion and hepatic gene expression of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette, subfamily G (WHITE), member 5 (ABCG5) and ATP-binding cassette, subfamily G (WHITE), member 8 (ABCG8), two half-transporters that act as a heterodimeric complex promoting sterol secretion. In addition, nuclear liver x receptor-alpha (LXRa), also regulated by TH, induces gene expression of ABCG5/G8. We here investigated if the TH-induced stimulation of biliary cholesterol secretion is mediated by the ABCG5/G8 complex in vivo, and if so, whether LXRa is involved. Mice homozygous for disruption of Abcg5 (Abcg5(-/-) ) or Lxra (Lxra(-/-) ) and their wild-type counterparts were treated with triiodothyronine (T3) for 14 days and compared to untreated mice of corresponding genetic backgrounds. Bile was collected by gallbladder cannulation, and liver samples were analyzed for gene expression levels. Basal biliary cholesterol secretion in Abcg5(-/-) mice was 72% lower than in Abcg5(+/+) mice. T3 treatment increased cholesterol secretion 3.1-fold in Abcg5(+/+) mice, whereas this response was severely blunted in Abcg5(-/-) mice. In contrast, biliary cholesterol secretion in T3-treated Lxra(+/+) and Lxra(-/-) mice was increased 3.5- and 2.6-fold, respectively, and did not differ significantly.
TH-induced secretion of cholesterol into bile is largely dependent on an intact ABCG5/G8 transporter complex, whereas LXRa is not critical for this effect.
Our goal was to determine whether genetic variation at genes affecting statin metabolism or targets of statin therapy would influence low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lowering with pravastatin, baseline heart disease, or cardiac endpoints on trial. We examined associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the liver X receptor alpha (LXRA, rs12221497), and the solute carrier organic anion transporter (SLCO1B1, rs4149056 and rs2306283) gene loci with these variables. We studied 5411 participants in PROSPER (PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk) (mean age 75.3 years), who had been randomized to pravastatin 40 mg/day or placebo and were followed for a mean of 3.2 years. No relationships between genetic variation at the LXRA gene locus with statin induced LDL lowering response or other parameters were noted. Both the SLCO1B1 rs4149056 (valine for alanine at 174) and the rs2306283 (asparagine for aspartic acid at 130) SNPs affect the amino acid sequence of the SLCO1B1 gene product. No effect of the rs2306283 SNP on any of the variables was noted. However the presence of the rs4149056 SNP was associated with significantly less LDL cholesterol lowering response to pravastatin (wildtype, 71.5% of the population, -37.0%; heterozygotes, 25.8% of the population, -36.0%; and homozygotes, 2.7% of the population, -31.8%, p=0.003 at 6 months, and p=0.022 at 12 months). Our data indicate that the presence of the rs4149056 non-synonymous SNP at the SLCO1B1 gene locus can significantly decrease the pravastatin induced LDL cholesterol lowering response.
Menopause is associated with changes in lipid levels resulting in increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events. Hormone therapy (HT) and atorvastatin have been used to improve lipid profile in postmenopausal women. Effects of HT, atorvastatin and APOE polymorphisms on serum lipids and APOE and LXRA expression were evaluated in 87 hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women, randomly selected for treatment with atorvastatin (AT, n=17), estrogen or estrogen plus progestagen (HT, n=34) and estrogen or estrogen plus progestagen associated with atorvastatin (HT+AT, n=36). RNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and mRNA expression was measured by TaqMan(®) PCR. APOE ɛ2/ɛ3/ɛ4 genotyping was performed using PCR-RFLP. Total cholesterol (TC), LDL-c and apoB were reduced after each treatment (p&lt;0.001). Triglycerides, VLDL-c and apoAI were reduced only after atorvastatin (p&lt;0.05), whereas triglycerides and VLDL-c were increased after HT (p=0.01). HT women had lower reduction on TC, LDL-c and apoB than AT and HT+AT groups (p&lt;0.05). APOE mRNA expression was reduced after atorvastatin treatment (p=0.03). Although LXRA gene expression was not modified by atorvastatin, it was correlated with APOE mRNA before and after treatments. Basal APOE mRNA expression was not influenced by gene polymorphisms, however the reduction on APOE expression was more pronounced in ɛ3ɛ3 than in ɛ3ɛ4 carriers. Atorvastatin down-regulates APOE mRNA expression and it is modified by APOE genotypes in PBMC from postmenopausal women.
Perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) are surface active fluorochemicals that, due to their exceptional stability to degradation, are persistent in the environment. Both PFOA and PFOS are eliminated slowly in humans, with geometric mean serum elimination half-lives estimated at 3.5 and 4.8 years, respectively. The biological activity of PFOA and PFOS in rodents is attributed primarily to transactivation of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARA), which is an important regulator of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. However, there are significant species-specific differences in the response to PFOA and PFOS exposure; non-rodent species, including humans, are refractory to several but not all of these effects. Many of the metabolic effects have been attributed to the activation of PPARA; however, recent studies using PPARα knockout mice demonstrate residual PPARA-independent effects, some of which may involve the activation of alternate nuclear receptors, including NR1I2 (PXR), NR1I3 (CAR), NR1H3 (LXRA), and NR1H4 (FXR). The objective of this investigation was to characterize the activation of multiple nuclear receptors and modulation of metabolic pathways associated with exposure to PFOA and PFOS, and to compare and contrast the effects between rat and human primary liver cells using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). Our results demonstrate that multiple nuclear receptors participate in the metabolic response to PFOA and PFOS exposure resulting in a substantial shift from carbohydrate metabolism to fatty acid oxidation and hepatic triglyceride accumulation in rat liver cells. This shift in intermediary metabolism was more pronounced for PFOA than PFOS. Furthermore, while there is some similarity in the activation of metabolic pathways between rat and humans, particularly in PPARA regulated responses; the changes in primary human cells were more subtle and possibly reflect an adaptive metabolic response rather than an overt metabolic regulation observed in rodents.
To use microarray analyses of gene expression to characterize the synovial molecular pathways regulated by the arthritis regulatory locus Cia25 and to determine how it operates to control disease severity and joint damage.
Synovial tissues from DA rats and DA.ACI(Cia25) rats obtained 21 days after induction of pristane-induced arthritis were used for RNA extraction and hybridization to Illumina RatRef-12 Expression BeadChips (22,228 genes). Genes with a P value≤0.01 and a fold difference in expression≥1.5 between DA rats and DA.ACI(Cia25) rats were considered significant.
Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) (7.4-fold), IL-6 (67-fold), Ccl2, Cxcl10, Mmp3, Mmp14, and innate immunity genes were expressed at increased levels in DA rats and at significantly lower levels in DA.ACI(Cia25) congenic rats. DA.ACI(Cia25) rats had increased expression of 10 nuclear receptor (NR) genes, including those known to interfere with NF-κB activity and cytokine expression, such as Lxra, Pparg, and Rxrg. DA.ACI(Cia25) rats also had increased expression of NR targets, suggesting increased NR activity. While Vdr was not differentially expressed, a Vdr expression signature was detected in congenic rats, along with up-regulation of mediators of vitamin D synthesis.
This is the first description of the association between increased synovial levels of NRs and arthritis protection. The expression of NRs was inversely correlated with the expression of key mediators of arthritis, suggesting reciprocally opposing effects either via NF-κB or at the genomic level in the synovial tissue. We consider that the NR signature may have an important role in maintaining synovial homeostasis and an inflammation-free tissue. These processes are regulated by the Cia25 gene and suggest a new function for this gene.
Liver X receptor-α (LXRA) is a nuclear receptor that regulates genes important in cholesterol homeostasis and inflammation. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the LXRA gene (NR1H3) have been earlier associated with metabolic phenotypes (dyslipidemia and elevated body mass index). Metabolic dysregulation is a major contributor to coronary disease; therefore, we assessed LXRA in International Verapamil Sustained Release SR Trandolapril Study Genetic Substudy (INVEST-GENES), a genetic-substudy of a large clinical trial in patients with hypertension and coronary artery disease.
Seven tag SNPs in the LXRA gene region (NR1H3) were selected for study: rs11039149, rs12221497, rs2279238, rs7120118, rs326213, rs11039159, and rs10501321. One thousand fifty-nine patients were genotyped from the INVEST-GENES case-control set (verapamil-sustained release-based or atenolol-based treatment strategies) that comprised of 297 cases frequency matched (approximately 2.5:1) with that of event-free controls by sex and race. The primary outcome was defined as first occurrence of all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using logistic regression.
Three of the seven SNPs were associated with significant effects on the primary outcome in nonBlacks. The variant G allele of rs11039149 and the variant A allele of rs12221497 were associated with reduced risk of experiencing the primary outcome [OR: 0.62, confidence interval (CI): 0.45-0.85, P=0.003 and OR: 0.60, CI: 0.39-0.91, P=0.016, respectively]. The rs2279238 genotype was associated with a significant increase in risk for the primary outcome (OR: 1.42, CI: 1.03-1.95, P=0.03). Furthermore, there was a significant genotype-treatment strategy interaction for carriers of the variant T allele of rs2279238 (OR for verapamil-sustained release strategy compared with atenolol strategy: 2.86, CI: 1.50-5.46, P=0.0015). Diplotype analyses showed that the SNPs are rarely coinherited and support the directionally opposite effects of the SNPs on the primary outcome.
LXRA genotypes were associated with variable risk for cardiovascular outcomes and pharmacogenetic effect in INVEST-GENES. These novel findings suggest that LXRA is a genetic/pharmacogenetic target that should be further explored.
Anthocyanins, which are found in some food, including Thai black sticky rice, are reported to have health-promoting properties. Oxidative stress plays a major role in the pathogenesis of many degenerative diseases induced by free radicals, such as cardiovascular disease, stroke and cancer. We evaluated the anthocyanin-rich extract (ARE) from Thai black sticky rice for antioxidative and antihyperlipidemic effects on HepG2 cells. Cell viability was investigated with the neutral red assay and the MTT assay, and oxidative stress was determined by the DCFH-DA assay. RT-PCR was used to evaluate the effect of ARE on LDLR, HMG-CoAR, PPAR (α1,γ) and LXRa gene expression. We found that ARE at high doses (≥ 800 mg/L) induces cytotoxicity. However, at 600-1000 mg/L it reduced intracellular oxidative stress (P &lt; 0.05) in a dose-dependent manner, and at 200 mg/L it significantly enhanced the expression of the LDLR gene in HepG2 cells. We concluded that ARE can be beneficial for health promotion by reducing oxidative stress and enhancing LDL clearance, regulating LDLR production on the cell surface membrane, thereby maintaining lipid homeostasis.
The differentiation of fibroblast-like pre-adipocytes to lipid-loaded adipocytes is regulated by a network of transcription factors, the most prominent one being the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ. However, many of the other 47 members of the nuclear receptor superfamily have an impact on adipogenesis, which in human cells has not been investigated in detail.
We analyzed by quantitative PCR all human nuclear receptors at multiple time points during differentiation of SGBS pre-adipocytes. The earliest effect was the down-regulation of the genes RARG, PPARD, REV-ERBA, REV-ERBB, VDR and GR followed by the up-regulation of PPARG, LXRA and AR. These observations are supported with data from 3T3-L1 mouse pre-adipocytes and primary human adipocytes. Investigation of the effects of the individual differentiation mix components in short-term treatments and of their omission from the full mix showed that the expression levels of the early-regulated nuclear receptor genes were most affected by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) ligand cortisol and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX. Interestingly, the effects of both compounds converged to repress the genes PPARD, REV-ERBA, REV-ERBB, VDR and GR, whereas cortisol and IBMX showed antagonistic interaction for PPARG, LXRA and AR causing a time lag in their up-regulation. We hypothesize that the well-known auto-repression of GR fine-tunes the detected early responses. Consistently, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that GR association increased on the transcription start sites of the genes RARG, REV-ERBB, VDR and GR.
Adipocyte differentiation is a process, in which many members of the nuclear receptor superfamily change their mRNA expression. The actions of cortisol and IBMX converged to repress several nuclear receptors early in differentiation, while up-regulation of other nuclear receptor genes showed a time lag due to antagonisms of the signals. Our results place GR and its ligand cortisol as central regulatory factors controlling early regulatory events in human adipogenesis that precedes the regulation of the later events by PPARG.
GSD-1 (glycogen storage disease type 1) is caused by an inherited defect in glucose-6-phosphatase activity, resulting in a massive accumulation of hepatic glycogen content and an induction of de novo lipogenesis. The chlorogenic acid derivative S4048 is a pharmacological inhibitor of the glucose 6-phosphate transporter, which is part of glucose-6-phosphatase, and allows for mechanistic studies concerning metabolic defects in GSD-1. Treatment of mice with S4048 resulted in an ~60% reduction in blood glucose, increased hepatic glycogen and triacylglycerol (triglyceride) content, and a markedly enhanced hepatic lipogenic gene expression. In mammals, hepatic expression of lipogenic genes is regulated by the co-ordinated action of the transcription factors SREBP (sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein)-1c, LXRα (liver X receptor α) and ChREBP (carbohydrate-response-element-binding protein). Treatment of Lxra-/- mice and Chrebp-/- mice with S4048 demonstrated that ChREBP, but not LXRα, mediates the induction of hepatic lipogenic gene expression in this murine model of GSD-1. Thus ChREBP is an attractive target to alleviate derangements in lipid metabolism observed in patients with GSD-1.
L-Xylulose reductase is part of the eukaryotic pathway for l-arabinose catabolism. A previously identified L-xylulose reductase in Hypocrea jecorina turned out to be not the 'true' one since it was not upregulated during growth on L-arabinose and the deletion strain showed no reduced L-xylulose reductase activity but instead lost the D-mannitol dehydrogenase activity. In this communication we identified the 'TRUE'L-xylulose reductase in Aspergillus niger. The gene, lxrA (JGI177736), is upregulated on L-arabinose and the deletion results in a strain lacking the NADPH-specific L-xylulose reductase activity and having reduced growth on l-arabinose. The purified enzyme had a K(m) for L-xylulose of 25 mM and a nu(max) of 650 U/mg.
Prenatal nutrition as influenced by the nutritional status of the mother has been identified as a determinant of adult disease. Feeding low-protein diets during pregnancy in rodents is a well-established model to induce programming events in offspring. We hypothesized that protein restriction would influence fetal lipid metabolism by inducing epigenetic adaptations. Pregnant C57BL/6J mice were exposed to a protein-restriction protocol (9% vs. 18% casein). Shortly before birth, dams and fetuses were killed. To identify putative epigenetic changes, CG-dinucleotide-rich region in the promoter of a gene (CpG island) methylation microarrays were performed on DNA isolated from fetal livers. Two hundred four gene promoter regions were differentially methylated upon protein restriction. The liver X-receptor (Lxr) alpha promoter was hypermethylated in protein-restricted pups. Lxr alpha is a nuclear receptor critically involved in control of cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. The mRNA level of Lxra was reduced by 32% in fetal liver upon maternal protein restriction, whereas expression of the Lxr target genes Abcg5/Abcg8 was reduced by 56% and 51%, respectively, measured by real-time quantitative PCR. The same effect, although less pronounced, was observed in the fetal intestine. In vitro methylation of a mouse Lxra-promoter/luciferase expression cassette resulted in a 24-fold transcriptional repression. Our study demonstrates that, in mice, protein restriction during pregnancy interferes with DNA methylation in fetal liver. Lxra is a target of differential methylation, and Lxra transcription is dependent on DNA methylation. It is tempting to speculate that perinatal nutrition may influence adult lipid metabolism by DNA methylation, which may contribute to the epidemiological relation between perinatal/neonatal nutrition and adult disease.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of longitudinal birth cohorts enable joint investigation of environmental and genetic influences on complex traits. We report GWAS results for nine quantitative metabolic traits (triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, glucose, insulin, C-reactive protein, body mass index, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure) in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (NFBC1966), drawn from the most genetically isolated Finnish regions. We replicate most previously reported associations for these traits and identify nine new associations, several of which highlight genes with metabolic functions: high-density lipoprotein with NR1H3 (LXRA), low-density lipoprotein with AR and FADS1-FADS2, glucose with MTNR1B, and insulin with PANK1. Two of these new associations emerged after adjustment of results for body mass index. Gene-environment interaction analyses suggested additional associations, which will require validation in larger samples. The currently identified loci, together with quantified environmental exposures, explain little of the trait variation in NFBC1966. The association observed between low-density lipoprotein and an infrequent variant in AR suggests the potential of such a cohort for identifying associations with both common, low-impact and rarer, high-impact quantitative trait loci.
The realization of optimized therapeutic delivery is impaired by the challenge of localized drug activity and by the dangers of systemic cytotoxicity which often contribute to patient treatment complications. Here we demonstrate the block copolymer-mediated deposition and release of multiple therapeutics which include an LXRα/β agonist 3-((4-methoxyphenyl)amino)-4-phenyl-1-(phenylmethyl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione (LXRa) and doxorubicin hydrochloride (Dox) at the air-water interface via Langmuir-Blodgett deposition, as well as copolymer-mediated potent drug elution toward the Raw 264.7 murine macrophage cell line. The resultant copolymer-therapeutic hybrid serves as a localized platform that can be functionalized with virtually any drug due to the integrated hydrophilic and hydrophobic components of the polymer structure. In addition, the sequestering function of the copolymer to anchor the drugs to implant surfaces can enhance delivery specificity when compared to systemic drug administration. Confirmation of drug functionality was confirmed via suppression of the interleukin 6 (Il-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) inflammatory cytokines (LXRa), as well as DNA fragmentation analysis (Dox). Furthermore, the fragmentation assays and gene expression analysis demonstrated the innate biocompatibility of the copolymeric material at the gene expression level via the confirmed absence of material-induced apoptosis and a lack of inflammatory gene expression. This modality enables layer-by-layer control of agonist and chemotherapeutic functionalization at the nanoscale for the localization of drug dosage, while simultaneously utilizing the copolymer platform as an anchoring mechanism for drug sequestering, all with an innate material thickness of 4 nm per layer, which is orders of magnitude thinner than existing commercial technologies. Furthermore, these studies comprehensively confirmed the potential translational applicability of copolymeric nanomaterials as localized multitherapeutic thin film platforms.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily and are activated by oxysterols and intermediates in the cholesterol synthetic pathway. The pivotal role of LXRs in the metabolic conversion of cholesterol to bile acids has been well established. Furthermore, insulin induces LXRa in hepatocytes, resulting in the suppression of key enzymes in gluconeogenesis, including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, and fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase (FBPase). LXRs also play an important role in fatty acid metabolism by activating the sterol regulatory element-bing protein 1c gene (SREBP1c). This articles reviews the molecular mechanisms by which LXRs act to influence the lipid and carbohydrate metabolism.
Genetic susceptibility in the causation of gallbladder diseases was recognized as early as 1937. A major gallstone susceptibility locus (Lith1) was identified in 1995 by quantitative trait locus mapping in mice. Two attractive positional and functional candidate genes in LXRA and ABCB11 are located in this interval. ABCB11 is associated with progressive familial cholestasis. This study was undertaken to investigate LXRA and ABCB11 as candidate genes for gallstone disease in humans. Eight hundred and ten patients who underwent cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstone disease (median age of onset, 50 years) were compared with 718 sex-matched control individuals. Control individuals were sonographically free of gallstones. Haplotype tagging and all known coding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped for ABCB11 (n=29) and LXRA (n=10). The investigated high-risk patient sample provides a power of greater than 80% for the detection of odds ratios down to 1.55. No evidence of association of the two genes in the single point tagging markers, coding variants or in the sliding window haplotype analysis was detected (all nominal single-point P values&gt;or=.08). In conclusion, in the investigated German sample, no evidence of association of ABCB11 and LXRA to gallstone susceptibility was detected. The gallstone trait is not allelic to progressive familial cholestasis at the ABCB11 locus. Systematic fine mapping of the Lith1 region is required to identify the causative genetic variants for gallstone in mice and humans.
The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) half-transporters ABCG5 and ABCG8 heterodimerize into a functional complex that mediates the secretion of plant sterols and cholesterol by hepatocytes into bile and their apical efflux from enterocytes. We addressed the putative rate-controlling role of Abcg5/Abcg8 in hepatobiliary cholesterol excretion in mice during (maximal) stimulation of this process. Despite similar bile salt (BS) excretion rates, basal total sterol and phospholipid (PL) output rates were reduced by 82% and 35%, respectively, in chow-fed Abcg5(-/-) mice compared with wild-type mice. When mice were infused with the hydrophilic BS tauroursodeoxycholate, similar relative increases in bile flow, BS output, PL output, and total sterol output were observed in wild-type, Abcg5(+/-), and Abcg5(-/-) mice. Maximal cholesterol and PL output rates in Abcg5(-/-) mice were only 15% and 69%, respectively, of wild-type values. An infusion of increasing amounts of the hydrophobic BS taurodeoxycholate increased cholesterol excretion by 3.0- and 2.4-fold in wild-type and Abcg5(-/-) mice but rapidly induced cholestasis in Abcg5(-/-) mice. Treatment with the liver X receptor (LXR) agonist T0901317 increased the maximal sterol excretion capacity in wild-type mice (fourfold), concomitant with the induction of Abcg5/Abcg8 expression, but not in Abcg5(-/-) mice. In a separate study, mice were fed chow containing 1% (wt/wt) cholesterol. As expected, hepatic expression of Abcg5 and Abcg8 was strongly induced (fivefold and fourfold) in wild-type but not LXR-alpha-deficient (Lxra(-/-)) mice. Surprisingly, hepatobiliary cholesterol excretion was increased to the same extent, i.e., 2.2-fold in wild-type mice and 2.0-fold in Lxra(-/-) mice, upon cholesterol feeding. Our data confirm that Abcg5, as part of the Abcg5/Abcg8 heterodimer, strongly controls hepatobiliary cholesterol secretion in mice. However, our data demonstrate that Abcg5/Abcg8 heterodimer-independent, inducible routes exist that can significantly contribute to total hepatobiliary cholesterol output.
Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is characterized by accumulation of neutral lipids in hepatocytes leading to micro and macro-vesicular steatosis and balloon cell degeneration. Hypercaloric alimentation and resultant obesity also cause similar changes as evident in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Thus, accumulation of lipids in hepatocytes is a pathologic hallmark of ALD and NAFLD. In contrast, quiescent hepatic stellate cells (HSC) are characterized by the intracellular content of not only vitamin A but also triglycerides, and HSC activation is associated with depletion of these lipids. In fact, our recent work demonstrates that adipogenic/ lipogenic transcriptional regulation rendered by PPARgamma, LXRa, and SREBP-1c is essential for the maintenance of the fat-storing, quiescence phenotype of HSC. Expression of these adipogenic transcription factors is lost in activated HSC and the treatment of the cells with the adipocyte differentiation cocktail or ectopic expression of PPARgamma or SREBP-1c causes a reversal of activated cells to the quiescent phenotype. In steatotic livers from ALD and NAFLD mouse models, the expression of these adipogenic transcription factors is induced while the normal control livers lack such expression. Thus, adipogenic regulation is essential for HSC quiescence while it makes hepatocytes steatotic. Interestingly, under the adipogenic conditions of ALD and NAFLD, HSC are still activated to cause fibrosis. This fat paradox in hepatocytes and HSC highlights contrasted significance of fat in these two cell types that depend on each other for their homeostatic control. It further suggests, activated HSC in steatotic livers may have defective insulin signaling or lipogenic regulation.
Fibrates are widely used hypolipidemic agents that activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a (PPARalpha) and regulate the expression of many genes involved in lipid metabolism. We studied the mechanism of the effect of clofibrate on cholesterol homeostasis. Rats were fed with chow containing clofibrate, cytochrome P-450 inhibitor ketoconazole, or clofibrate plus ketoconazole. Control rats were fed only with normal chow. The levels of six oxysterols in liver microsome were determined. The levels of mRNAs for liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha), ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1), PPARalpha and cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A) in the liver were analyzed by northern blotting. Clofibrate administration decreased plasma levels of total cholesterol and triglyceride and increased high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C). Clofibrate increased the levels of liver microsomal oxysterols including 25- and 27-hydroxycholesterol, which are potent activators of LXRalpha. Clofibrate also enhanced the expression of mRNAs for PPARalpha, LXRalpha, and ABCA1. Simultaneous administration of ketoconazole suppressed the effects of clofibrate on plasma lipids, hepatic oxysterol levels, and the expression of the genes. Clofibrate increases cytochrome P450 content and the resulting oxysterol generation may partly mediate the clofibrate-induced up-regulattion of LXRa and ABCA1, which are related to reverse cholesterol transport.
In order to identify changes in the gene expression profile during human monocyte/macrophage differentiation in the presence of GM-CSF, the expression level of various mRNA was studied using DNA microarray technology. We found LXR alpha (LXRa) to be the most highly induced transcriptional regulator during macrophage differentiation. The LXRa mRNA level was induced 40 fold which ranked it as the 10th highest among the approximately 5,600 genes studied. Although only restricted hepatic expression of LXRa mRNA had been reported, the macrophage expressed the highest level of LXRa among the nine human tissues and cultured cells studied. To further investigate transcriptional control, we have characterized the genomic structure of the human LXRa gene and determined the structure of its promoter region. The human LXRa gene consists of eleven exons, and analysis of the promoter region indicated the presence of conserved binding sites for myeloid zinc finger protein 1, which may be related to the extrahepatic expression of LXRa. LXRa is known to be activated by oxysterols, and the induced expression of the gene may be related to the foam cell formation in atherosclerotic lesions.
Treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist leads to enhanced bone turnover and accelerated bone loss in premenopausal women with endometriosis, uterine leiomyomatomas and hirsutism. Sodium etidronate is a powerful inhibitor of bone resorption which had been proven efficacious in the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the skeletal effects of 6 months of therapy with the depot preparation of the GnRH agonist triptorelin (decapeptil 3.75 mg intramuscularly every 4 weeks) in 24 hirsute patients, aged 24-33 years, with hyperandrogenic chronic anovulation. Ten patients also received cyclical etidronate in an oral dose of 400 mg/day for 2 weeks, followed by an 11-week period of 500 mg/day elemental oral calcium (one cycle). The remaining 14 patients received 500 mg/day of elemental calcium continuously. After 6 months all treatments were discontinued for at least a further 6 months. Bone mineral density (BMD) at lumbar spine and hip (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, Sophos LXRA, France) and biochemical markers (serum alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, urinary N-telopeptide and hydroxyproline/creatinine ratio) were evaluated at baseline, 6 months and 12 months. In the group given GnRH agonist alone BMD fell significantly at all measured skeletal sites during the first 6 months. In the patients treated with etidronate a significant decrease in BMD was observed at lumbar spine but not in the femoral neck and trochanter, and the changes at lumbar spine and trochanter were significantly smaller than those in the control group. At 6 months bone turnover was also increased in patients treated with GnRH and calcium. Cyclical etidronate prevented the increase in biochemical markers of bone formation and resorption, with the exception of calcium/creatinine excretion, which was significantly increased in both groups. Six months after treatment withdrawal BMD did not recover in either group. Biochemical markers (N-telopeptide, serum alkaline phosphatase) remained increased in those patients previously treated with calcium alone while they remained close to baseline values in the patients treated with cyclical etidronate. Our study indicates that: (1) GnRH agonist therapy causes remarkable bone loss in young individuals with androgen excess who are expected to have increased bone mass; (2) this bone loss can be partially prevented by intermittent cyclical etidronate therapy.
The microRNA-26 (miR-26) family is known to control adipogenesis in non-ruminants. The genomic loci of miR-26a and miR-26b have been localized in the introns of genes encoding for the proteins of the C-terminal domain RNA polymerase II polypeptide A small phosphatase (CTDSP) family. Insulin-induced gene 1 (INSIG1) encodes a protein with a key role in the regulation of lipogenesis in rodent liver. In the present study, we investigated the synergistic function of the miR-26 family and their host genes in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMEC). Downregulation of miR-26a/b and their host genes in GMEC decreased the expression of genes relate to fatty acid synthesis (PPARG, LXRA, SREBF1, FASN, ACACA, GPAM, LPIN1, DGAT1 and SCD1), triacylglycerol accumulation and unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. Luciferase reporter assays confirmed INSIG1 as a direct target of miR-26a/b. Furthermore, inhibition of the CTDSP family also downregulated the expression of INSIG1. Taken together, our findings highlight a functional association of miR-26a/b, their host genes and INSIG1, and provide new insights into the regulatory network controlling milk fat synthesis in GMEC. The data indicate that targeting this network via nutrition might be important for regulating milk fat synthesis in ruminants.
Fish currently supplies only 40% of the eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) required to allow all individuals globally to meet the minimum intake recommendation of 500 mg/d. Therefore, alternative sustainable sources are needed.
The main objective was to investigate the ability of genetically engineered Camelina sativa (20% EPA) oil (CO) to enrich tissue EPA and DHA relative to an EPA-rich fish oil (FO) in mammals.
Six-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed for 10 wk either a palm oil-containing control (C) diet or diets supplemented with EPA-CO or FO, with the C, low-EPA CO (COL), high-EPA CO (COH), low-EPA FO (FOL), and high-EPA FO (FOH) diets providing 0, 0.4, 3.4, 0.3, and 2.9 g EPA/kg diet, respectively. Liver, muscle, and brain were collected for fatty acid analysis, and blood glucose and serum lipids were quantified. The expression of selected hepatic genes involved in EPA and DHA biosynthesis and in modulating their cellular impact was determined.
The oils were well tolerated, with significantly greater weight gain in the COH and FOH groups relative to the C group (P &lt; 0.001). Significantly lower (36-38%) blood glucose concentrations were evident in the FOH and COH mice relative to C mice (P &lt; 0.01). Hepatic EPA concentrations were higher in all EPA groups relative to the C group (P &lt; 0.001), with concentrations of 0.0, 0.4, 2.9, 0.2, and 3.6 g/100 g liver total lipids in the C, COL, COH, FOL, and FOH groups, respectively. Comparable dose-independent enrichments of liver DHA were observed in mice fed CO and FO diets (P &lt; 0.001). Relative to the C group, lower fatty acid desaturase 1 (Fads1) expression (P &lt; 0.005) was observed in the COH and FOH groups. Higher fatty acid desaturase 2 (Fads2), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (Ppara), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (Pparg) (P &lt; 0.005) expressions were induced by CO. No impact of treatment on liver X receptor α (Lxra) or sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (Srebp1c) was evident.
Oil from transgenic Camelina is a bioavailable source of EPA in mice. These data provide support for the future assessment of this oil in a human feeding trial.
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the most prevalent noncommunicable diseases in humans. Different studies have identified dietary procyanidins as bioactive compounds with beneficial properties against CVD by improving lipid homeostasis, among other mechanisms. The aim of this work was to assess whether grape seed procyanidin consumption at a physiological dose during the perinatal period could influence the CVD risk of the offspring. Wistar rat dams were treated with a grape seed procyanidin extract (GSPE; 25mg/kg of body weight per day) or vehicle during gestation and lactation. The adult male offspring of GSPE-treated dams presented decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, increased total cholesterol-to-HDL-C ratios and an exacerbated fasting triglyceride-to-HDL-C ratios (atherogenic index of plasma) compared to the control group. Impaired reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) was evidenced by the accumulation of cholesterol in skeletal muscle and by decreased fecal excretion of cholesterol and bile acids, which was consistent with the observed mRNA down-regulation of the rate-limiting enzyme in the hepatic bile acid synthesis pathway Cyp7A1. Conversely, GSPE programming also resulted in up-regulated gene expression of different key components of the RCT process, such as hepatic Npc1, Abcg1, Abca1, Lxra, Srebp2, Lcat, Scarb1 and Pltp, and the repression of microRNA miR-33a expression, a key negative controller of hepatic RCT at the gene expression level. Our results show that maternal intake of grape procyanidins during the perinatal period impacts different components of the RCT process, resulting in increased CVD risk in the adult offspring. 
Liver X receptors (Lxrs) are master regulators of cholesterol catabolism, driving the elimination of cholesterol from the periphery to the lumen of the intestine. Development of pharmacological agents to activate Lxrs has been hindered by synthetic Lxr agonists' induction of hepatic lipogenesis and hypertriglyceridemia. Elucidating the function of Lxrs in regulating enterocyte lipid handling might identify novel aspects of lipid metabolism that are pharmacologically amenable. We took a genetic approach centered on the single Lxr gene nr1h3 in zebrafish to study the role of Lxr in enterocyte lipid metabolism. Loss of nr1h3 function causes anticipated gene regulatory changes and cholesterol intolerance, collectively reflecting high evolutionary conservation of zebrafish Lxra function. Intestinal nr1h3 activation delays transport of absorbed neutral lipids, with accumulation of neutral lipids in enterocyte cytoplasmic droplets. This delay in transport of ingested neutral lipids protects animals from hypercholesterolemia and hepatic steatosis induced by a high-fat diet. On a gene regulatory level, Lxra induces expression of acsl3a, which encodes acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 3a, a lipid droplet-anchored protein that directs fatty acyl chains into lipids. Forced overexpression of acls3a in enterocytes delays, in part, the appearance of neutral lipids in the vasculature of zebrafish larvae. Activation of Lxr in the intestine cell-autonomously regulates the rate of delivery of absorbed lipids by inducting a temporary lipid intestinal droplet storage depot. 
The essential fatty acids, omega-3 and omega-6, consumed during pregnancy can benefit maternal and offspring health. For instance, they could activate a network of genes related to the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (Ppara) and sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (Srebf1), which play a role in fatty acid oxidation and lipogenesis. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of diets with different omega-3/omega-6 ratio consumed over three generations on blood biochemical parameters and hepatic expression of Ppara- and Srebf1-related genes. During three consecutive generations adult Wistar rats were evaluated in the postpartum period (21 days after parturition). Regardless of prenatal dietary omega-3/omega-6 ratio, an upregulation in liver tissue was observed for Rxra, Lxra and Srebf1 and a downregulation for Fasn in all the evaluated generations. The diet with higher omega-3/omega-6 ratio decreased triacylglycerol serum levels and resulted in a constant non-esterified fatty acid level. Our results indicated that the PUFAs effect on the modulation of genes related to fatty acid oxidation and lipogenesis is cumulative through generations. 
Obesity and type 2 diabetes have a heritable component that is not attributable to genetic factors. Instead, epigenetic mechanisms may play a role. We have developed a mouse model of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) by in utero malnutrition. IUGR mice developed obesity and glucose intolerance with aging. Strikingly, offspring of IUGR male mice also developed glucose intolerance. Here, we show that in utero malnutrition of F1 males influenced the expression of lipogenic genes in livers of F2 mice, partly due to altered expression of Lxra. In turn, Lxra expression is attributed to altered DNA methylation of its 5' UTR region. We found the same epigenetic signature in the sperm of their progenitors, F1 males. Our data indicate that in utero malnutrition results in epigenetic modifications in germ cells (F1) that are subsequently transmitted and maintained in somatic cells of the F2, thereby influencing health and disease risk of the offspring. 
Vulnerability of the fetus upon maternal obesity can potentially occur during all developmental phases. We aimed at elaborating longer-term health outcomes of fetal overnutrition during the earliest stages of development. We utilized Naval Medical Research Institute (NMRI) mice to induce pre-conceptional and gestational obesity and followed offspring outcomes in the absence of any postnatal obesogenic influences. Male adult offspring developed overweight, insulin resistance, hyperleptinemia, hyperuricemia and hepatic steatosis; all these features were not observed in females. Instead, they showed impaired fasting glucose and a reduced fat mass and adipocyte size. Influences of the interaction of maternal diet∗sex concerned offspring genes involved in fatty liver disease, lipid droplet size regulation and fat mass expansion. These data suggest that a peri-conceptional obesogenic exposure is sufficient to shape offspring gene expression patterns and health outcomes in a sex- and organ-specific manner, indicating varying developmental vulnerabilities between sexes towards metabolic disease in response to maternal overnutrition. 
Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) has been inversely related to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk. The influence of menopause in the RCT process is poorly understood and the effects of cholesterol-lowering interventions, including statins and hormone therapy (HT), on genes controlling the RCT in postmenopausal women are also unknown.
The effects on serum lipids and expression profile of genes involved in RCT - APOA1, ABCA1, ABCG1, SCARB1 and LXRA - were evaluated by TaqMan(®) quantitative PCR in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 87 postmenopausal hypercholesterolemic women treated with atorvastatin (AT, n=17), estrogen or estrogen plus progestin (HT, n=34) and estrogen or estrogen plus progestin associated with atorvastatin (HT+AT, n=36).
Atorvastatin and HT treatments reduced the mRNA levels of APOA1 and SCARB1, respectively, whereas ABCA1 expression was reduced after all treatments. Although the expression of LXRA, an important transcription factor controlling the expression of genes involved in RCT, was not modified after any treatment, it was correlated with ABCA1, APOA1 and SCARB1 RNAm values before and after treatments, however no correlation with ABCG1 was observed. In a linear regression analysis, HT was related to an increase in apoAI levels after treatment when compared to atorvastatin and, moreover, higher SCARB1 and ABCA1 basal expression were also associated with decreased apoAI levels after treatments.
ABCA1 mRNA levels are decreased by atorvastatin and HT, however these treatments have a differential effect on APOA1 and SCARB1 expression in PBMC from postmenopausal women. Basal ABCA1 and SCARB1 expression profile could be helpful markers in predicting the effect of atorvastatin and HT on RCT, according to the changes in apoAI levels in this sample population.
Studies have shown that inflammation promoted atherosclerotic progression; however, it remains unclear whether inflammation promoted atherosclerotic progression properties by altering cholesterol metabolism in human macrophages. In the present study, we evaluated a potential mechanism of inflammation on atherogenic effects. We evaluated the ability of TNFa to affect Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) and cholesterol uptake and its mechanism(s) of action in human macrophages.
We initially determined the potential effects of TNFa on cholesterol efflux in the human macrophages. We also determined alterations in mRNA and protein levels of ABCA1, ABCG1, LXRa, CD-36, SR-A in human macrophages using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western immunoblot analyses. The cholesterol efflux rate and protein expression of ABCA1, ABCG1, LXRa, CD-36, SR-A were quantified in human macrophages under PKC-θ inhibition using PKC-θ siRNA. Our results showed that TNFa inhibited the rate of cholesterol efflux and down-regulation the expression levels of ABCA1, ABCG1 and LXRa and up-regulation the expression levels of CD-36, SR-A in human macrophages; PKC-θ inhibition by PKC-θ siRNA attenuated the effect of TNFa on ABCA1, ABCG1, LXRa, SR-A, CD-36 expression.
Our results suggest TNFa alter cholesterol metabolism in human macrophages through the inhibition of Reverse cholesterol transport and enhancing cholesterol uptake via PKC-θ-dependent pathway, implicating a potential mechanism of inflammation on atherogenic effects.
A direct comparison of cow and goat performance and milk fatty acid (FA) responses to diets that either induce milk fat depression or increase milk fat content in cows suggests species-specific regulation of lipid metabolism, including mammary lipogenesis. This experiment was conducted to highlight potential mechanisms responsible for the differences in mammary lipogenesis due to diet and ruminant species. Twelve Holstein cows and 12 Alpine goats were fed a basal diet containing no additional lipid (CTL) or a similar diet supplemented with corn oil [5% dry matter intake (DMI)] and wheat starch (COS), marine algae powder (MAP; 1.5% DMI), or hydrogenated palm oil (HPO; 3% DMI), according to a 4 × 4 Latin square design with 28-d experimental periods. Milk yield, milk composition, FA profile, and secretions were measured. On d 27 of each experimental period, the mRNA abundance of 21 genes involved in lipid metabolism or enzyme activities or both were measured in mammary tissue sampled by biopsy. The results showed significant differences in the milk fat response of cows and goats to the dietary treatments. In cows, fat content was lowered by COS (-45%) and MAP (-22%) and increased by HPO (+13%) compared with CTL, and in goats only MAP had an effect compared with CTL, with a decrease of 15%. In both species, COS and MAP lowered the yields (mmol/d per kilogram of body weight) of &lt;C16 and C16 FA. With COS, this decrease was compensated by an increase of &gt;C16 FA in goats but not in cows, and the &gt;C16 FA yield decreased with MAP in both species. Supplementation of HPO increased the yield of milk C16 FA (mmol/d per kilogram of body weight) in cows. These variations in milk fat content and FA secretion were not associated with modifications in the mammary expression of 21 genes involved in major lipid pathways, except for 3 transcription factors: PPARA, INSIG1, and SP1. This absence of large changes might be due to post-transcriptional regulation of these genes and related to the time of sampling of the mammary tissue relative to the previous meal and milking or to differences in the availability of substrate for the corresponding proteins. However, the abundance of 14 mRNA among the 21 encoding for genes studied in the mammary gland was significantly different among species, with 5 more abundant in cows (FADS3, ACSL1, PPARA, LXRA, and PPARG1) and 10 more abundant in goats (FASN, CD36, FABP3, LPL, GPAM, LPIN1, CSN2, MFGE8, and INSIG1). These species specificities of mammary lipid metabolism require further investigation.
The liver controls metabolic homeostasis in response to fasting and refeeding periods. Glucokinase (GCK) adjusts hepatic glucose phosphorylation to blood glucose levels, acting as a glucose sensor. Our objective was to determine whether PAS kinase (PASK), a nutrient sensor, could be affecting the expression or activity of liver GCK and the response to fasting and refeeding states of key hepatic metabolic pathways. PASK-deficient mice have impaired insulin signaling (AKT overactivation). Furthermore, PASK deficiency modified the expression of several transcription factors involved in the adjustment to fasting and refeeding. Foxo1 decreased under fasting conditions, while Ppara and Pparg were overexpressed in PASK-deficient mice. However, PEPCK protein levels were similar or higher, while the expression of Cpt1a decreased in PASK-deficient mice. By contrast, Lxra and Chrebp were overexpressed after refeeding, while the expression of Acc and Fas decreased in PASK-deficient mice. Likewise, with a decreased expression of Gck and increased nuclear location of the complex GCK-GCKR, GCK activity decreased in PASK-deficient mice. Therefore, PASK regulated some of the genes and proteins responsible for glucose sensing, such as glucokinase, and for insulin signalling, affecting glucose and lipid metabolism and consequently certain critical hepatic functions.
Chitooligosaccharide (COS) has shown potential antihyperlipidemic activity in a few studies as a functional food.
We investigated the cholesterol-lowering effect and potential mechanisms of chitooligosaccharide capsules (COSTC) in male SD rats fed a high-fat diet.
COSTC could ameliorate serum lipid levels. Simultaneously, the cholesterol-lowering effect is probably attributed to its role in two pathways: upregulating the gene expression and activity of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), liver X receptor alpha (LXRA), and peroxisome proliferation activated receptor-α (PPARα), which facilitates the conversion of cholesterol into bile acid; downregulating the gene expression and activity of enzymes including 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) and sterol-responsive element binding protein-2 (SREBP2) and upregulating the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) to reduce the denovo synthesis of cholesterol.
Studies have suggested that COSTC has potential usefulness as a natural supplement or functional food for preventing and treating hyperlipidemia.
The aim of this study was to investigate how the signaling pathway downstream of mTOR/S6K1 contributes to the regulation of SREBP-1c expression during lipogenesis in HepG2 cells.
The model of steatosis was established using human hepatocytes HepG2 and inducting them with sodium palmitate. mTOR, S6K1 and LXRα were inhibited by rapamycin, PF-4708671 and siRNA-LXRα, respectively. After a variety of different treatment, the levels of intracellular triglycerides, the accumulation of lipid droplets and the expression levels of related genes were detected.
Rapamycin, PF-4708671 and siRNA-LXRα treatment could decrease the accumulation of triglycerides and lipid droplets induced by sodium palmitate in HepG2 cells, and the inhibitory effect could be enhanced by the combination of them. Sodium palmitate stimulated the expression of genes encoding mTOR, S6K1, LXRα, SREBP-1c and SREBP-1c target enzymes (FAS and ACC1) in HepG2 cells. Moreover, these genes were sensitive to rapamycin. PF-4708671 also decreased the expression of these genes, except for the mTOR gene, and the extent of reduction could be enhanced by combination with rapamycin. Knockdown of LXRα decreased the expression of SREBP-1c, FAS and ACC1, but it had no effect on the expression of mTOR or S6K1. Furthermore, rapamycin and PF-4708671 enhanced the inhibitory effect of siRNA-LXRα.
mTOR/S6K1 regulates the SREBP-1c signaling pathway through LXRα in sodium palmitate-induced HepG2 cells, suggesting LXRα might be a potential therapeutic target for NAFLD.
Pork is the most popular meat in the world. Unfortunately, the selection pressure focused on high meat content led to a reduction in pork quality. The present study used RNA-seq technology to identify metabolic process genes related to pork quality traits and fat deposition. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between pigs of Pulawska and Polish Landrace breeds for two the most important muscles (semimembranosus and longissimus dorsi). A total of 71 significant DEGs were reported: 15 for longissimus dorsi and 56 for semimembranosus muscles. The genes overexpressed in Pulawska pigs were involved in lipid metabolism (APOD, LXRA, LIPE, AP2B1, ENSSSCG00000028753 and OAS2) and proteolysis (CST6, CTSD, ISG15 and UCHL1). In Polish Landrace pigs, genes playing a role in biological adhesion (KIT, VCAN, HES1, SFRP2, CDH11, SSX2IP and PCDH17), actin cytoskeletal organisation (FRMD6, LIMK1, KIF23 and CNN1) and calcium ion binding (PVALB, CIB2, PCDH17, VCAN and CDH11) were transcriptionally more active. The present study allows for better understanding of the physiological processes associated with lipid metabolism and muscle fiber organization. This information could be helpful in further research aiming to estimate the genetic markers.
Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) plays a central role in lipid transport and cholesterol metabolism, with surplus cholesterol being removed from the liver through bile acid (BA) synthesis. Furthermore, BAs are of critical importance in fat absorption by forming intestinal lipid-bile salt mixed micelles. To define ApoE's role in BA homeostasis, the metabolism of cholesterol and BA was investigated in liver tissue and gallbladder bile of ApoE-deficient mice given a chow or high-cholesterol/high-fat diet (HCHF) diet for 6 months. When compared to wild-type mice, muricholic acid (MCA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) increased approximately 15-, 82-, 22- and 38-fold, respectively, in hepatic tissue of ApoE-deficient mice given a chow or HCHF diet. Moreover, ApoE-deficient mice on an HCHF diet increased the amounts of hepatic free cholesterol, MCA and CDCA by 61%, 61% and 50% (P&lt;.05). Conversely, total cholesterol and cholesterol esters were unchanged, and the bile acids taurohyodeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid and hyodeoxycholic acid decreased to one third as compared to the chow diet (P&lt;.05). Additionally, quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assays revealed induced expression of the bile acid receptor (Fxr) and associated transcription factors, i.e.Fxr, Lrh, Lxra and Srebp1c. Transcript expression of Cyp2a12, Cyp1b1, Cyp2e1, Cyp3a16 and Cyp4a10 was also induced. Note that Cyp4a10 catalyzes ω-hydroxylation of arachidonic acid to epoxy- and hydroxyeicosatrienoic acids to control vascular tone. Altogether, MCA and CDCA synthesis is selectively induced in ApoE-deficient mice. These hydrophilic BAs alter micellar size and structure to lower intestinal cholesterol solubilization. Furthermore, CDCA and MCA are potent FXR agonist and antagonist, respectively, and function in a regulatory loop to mitigate impaired ApoE function.
A direct comparison of cow and goat performance and milk fatty acid (FA) responses to diets known to induce milk fat depression in the bovine has suggested interspecies differences in rumen and mammary lipid metabolism. Thus, this study was conducted to infer some potential mechanisms responsible for the differences in mammary lipogenesis due to diet and ruminant species. To meet this objective, 12 cows and 15 goats were fed a basal diet (control), a similar diet supplemented with 2.2% fish oil (FO), or a diet containing 5.3% sunflower oil and additional starch (+38%; SOS) according to a 3 × 3 Latin square design with 26-d experimental periods. Milk yield, milk composition, FA profile, and FA secretion were measured. On the last day of each period, the mRNA abundance of 19 key genes in mammary metabolism or the enzyme activity or both were measured in mammary tissue sampled by biopsy or at slaughter or both. The results show significant differences in the response of cows and goats to the dietary treatments. In cows, milk fat content and yield were lowered by FO and SOS (-31%), whereas only FO decreased milk fat content in goats (-21%) compared with the control. In cows and to a lesser extent in goats, FO and SOS decreased the secretion of &lt;C16 and C16 FA, and FO lowered &gt;C16 FA output (mmol/kg of BW). However, SOS increased the secretion of &gt;C16 FA in goats. These changes in milk fat content and FA secretion were not associated with modifications in mammary expression or the activity of 19 proteins involved in the major lipogenic pathways. This absence of variation may be attributable to posttranscriptional regulation for these genes or related to the time of sampling of the mammary tissue relative to the previous meal and milking. Otherwise, the abundances of 15 mRNA among the 19 encoding for genes involved in lipid metabolism in the mammary gland were different among species, with 9 more abundant in cows (FASN, FADS1, SCD1, GPD1, LALBA, SREBF1, LXRA, PPARA, and PPARG1) and 6 more abundant in goats (G6PD, GPAM, SCD5, XDH, CSN2, and SP1). Similarly, a significant effect of the species was observed in the 4 enzyme activities measured; glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and malic enzyme were higher in cows, and FA synthase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities were higher in goats. In conclusion, the differences between cow and goat performance and milk FA responses to the FO and SOS treatments were not related to changes in the measured mammary lipogenic gene expression. Furthermore, the data provide evidence that the major mammary lipogenic pathways differ between the caprine and the bovine, whose biological significance remains to be unraveled.
To evaluate the expression and correlations of liver X receptor alpha (LXRa) and its target gene sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) in placentas of preeclampsia (PE) and their significance in PE.
Pregnancies were divided into two groups, 60 cases (29 cases of mild and 31 cases of severe) of PE group and 56 cases of normal group. The level of mRNA and protein of LXRa and SREBP-1c were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the placentas.
RT-PCR and IHC results showed that the mRNA and protein expression of both LXRa and SREBP-1c increased gradually with the extent of PE among normal pregnancy, mild PE and severe PE groups, and the differences were of statistically significance (P&lt;0.01 or P&lt;0.05). There were positive correlations between the expression of LXRa mRNA and SREBP-1c mRNA, also between LXRa mRNA and LXRa protein (r=0.521, P&lt;0.01; r=0.422, P&lt;0.01). The expression of SREBP-1c mRNA positively correlated with its protein level (r=0.598, P&lt;0.01). There were positive correlations between the expression of LXRa protein and SREBP-1c protein (r=0.612, P&lt;0.01).
The expression of LXRa is elevated significantly in placentas of PE patients, and might contribute for promoting the transcription and translation of its target gene SREBP1-c, which is related to the occurrence and development of PE.
Quercetin has been reported to have the activities of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-virus, anti-cancer and so on. Many studies showed that quercetin could lower blood pressure and improve blood capillary elasticity, and it can also reduce LDL oxidation and prevent atherosclerosis. Although quercetin has been recognized to have the function of preventing atherosclerosis, little is known about its underlying mechanism. In this study, we try to explore whether quercetin up-regulates LXRa-mediated ABCA1 expression.
THP-1 cells were cultured. The expression of ABCA1 and LXRa were detected by real-time PCR and western blot. Cellular cholesterol efflux from THP-1 macrophages was analyzed using liquid scintillation counting assays.
Real-time PCR and Western blot showed quercetin increased the expression of ABCA1 and LXRα at both the mRNA and protein levels in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner in THP-1 macrophages. Liquid scintillation counting assays indicated quercetin increased the cholesterol efflux and decreased the cellular cholesterol content. Furthermore, the expression of LXRa was decreased after THP-1 macrophage transfected with LXRα siRNA. Meanwhile, the expression of ABCA1 was also recovered after incubated with the combination of LXRa siRNA and quercetin compared with quercetin alone.
Quercetin could increase ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux through LXRα pathway to eventually promote RCT in the THP-1 macrophage.
The testis-determining gene SRY is not well-conserved among mammals, particularly between mouse and other mammals, both in terms of protein structure and of expression regulation. To evaluate SRY phylogenic conservation in regards to its function, we expressed the goat gene (gSRY) in XX transgenic mouse gonads. Here, we show that gSRY induces testis formation, despite a goat expression profile. Our results demonstrate that sex-reversal can be induced in XX-mice by a non-mouse SRY thus suggesting a conserved molecular mechanism of action of this testis-determining gene across mammalian species.
In mammals, the Y-located SRY gene is known to induce testis formation from the indifferent gonad. A related gene, SOX9, also plays a critical role in testis differentiation in mammals, in birds and reptiles. It is now assumed that SRY acts upstream of SOX9 in the sex determination cascade, but the regulatory link which should exist between these two genes remains unknown. Studies on XX sex reversal in polled goats (PIS mutation: Polled Intersex Syndrome) have led to the discovery of a female-specific locus crucial for ovarian differentiation. This genomic region is composed of at least two genes, FOXL2 and PISRT1, which share a common transcriptional regulatory region, PIS. In this review, we present the expression pattern of these PIS-regulated genes in mice. The FOXL2 expression profile of mice is similar to that described in goats in accordance with a conserved role of this ovarian differentiating gene in mammals. On the contrary, the PISRT1 expression profile is different between mice and goats, suggesting different mechanisms of the primary switch in the testis determination process within mammals. A model based on two different modes of SOX9 regulation in mice and other mammals is proposed in order to integrate our results into the current scheme of gonad differentiation.
The testis-determining gene SRY is not well-conserved among mammals, and particularly between mouse and other mammals. To evaluate SRY function in a nonrodent species, we produced an antibody against goat SRY and used it to investigate the expression pattern of SRY throughout goat testicular development. By contrast with the mouse, SRY is primarily expressed in most cells of XY genital-ridges and not solely in pre-Sertoli cells. Between cord formation and prepuberty, SRY remains expressed in both Sertoli and germinal cells. During adulthood, SRY expression declines and then disappears from meiotic germ cells, only remaining present at low levels in some spermatogonia. Unlike the germinal lineage, SRY continues to be highly expressed in adult Sertoli cells with a typical nuclear staining. Our data indicate that in goat, the role of SRY may not be limited to testis determination and could have other functions in testicular maintenance and hence male fertility.
In mammalian embryonic gonads, SOX9 is required for the determination of Sertoli cells that orchestrate testis morphogenesis. To identify genetic networks directly regulated by SOX9, we combined analysis of SOX9-bound chromatin regions from murine and bovine foetal testes with sequencing of RNA samples from mouse testes lacking Sox9. We found that SOX9 controls a conserved genetic programme that involves most of the sex-determining genes. In foetal testes, SOX9 modulates both transcription and directly or indirectly sex-specific differential splicing of its target genes through binding to genomic regions with sequence motifs that are conserved among mammals and that we called 'Sertoli Cell Signature' (SCS). The SCS is characterized by a precise organization of binding motifs for the Sertoli cell reprogramming factors SOX9, GATA4 and DMRT1. As SOX9 biological role in mammalian gonads is to determine Sertoli cells, we correlated this genomic signature with the presence of SOX9 on chromatin in foetal testes, therefore equating this signature to a genomic bar code of the fate of foetal Sertoli cells. Starting from the hypothesis that nuclear factors that bind to genomic regions with SCS could functionally interact with SOX9, we identified TRIM28 as a new SOX9 partner in foetal testes.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and inflammatory disorders. In this study, we tested the effect of rhein, a lipophilic anthraquinone derived from a traditional Chinese herbal medicine Rheum palmatum L., on NAFLD-associated hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and the T helper (Th)1/Th2 cytokine imbalance in high-fat diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. We found that oral administration of rhein for 40 days significantly increased energy expenditure, reduced body weight, particularly body fat content, improved insulin resistance, and lowered circulating cholesterol levels in DIO mice without affecting food intake. Rhein treatment also reduced liver triglyceride levels, reversed hepatic steatosis, and normalized alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels in these mice. Gene analysis and Western blot showed that rhein markedly suppressed the expression of the lipogenic enzyme sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and its target genes in the liver. Luciferase reporter assay revealed that rhein suppressed the transcriptional activity of SREBP-1c through its upstream regulator, liver X receptor (LXR). This suggests that rhein exerts its effects by targeting LXR, which is also supported by its inability to reduce body weight in LXR knockout mice. Moreover, multiplex ELISA displayed a downregulated Th1 response after rhein treatment. Rhein shifted the Th1/Th2 responses by inhibiting T-box expressed in T-cells (T-bet) expression and enhancing GATA-binding protein-3 (GATA-3) expression through increased signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) phosphorylation. These data indicate that rhein ameliorated NAFLD and associated disorders through LXR-mediated negative energy balance, metabolic regulatory pathways, and immunomodulatory activities involved in hepatic steatosis. The combined effects of rhein to target hepatic metabolic and immune pathways may be beneficial for complex metabolic diseases such as NAFLD.
Two ATP-binding cassette transporter proteins, ABCA1 and ABCG1, may mediate an active efflux of cellular cholesterol and phospholipids. They are ubiquitously expressed and are subject to regulation by cholesterol loading or by treatment with agents that activate the nuclear hormone receptor LXR. Earlier studies in both primates and non-primates reported that treatment with endotoxin (bacterial lipopolysaccharide, LPS) reduces plasma levels of HDL cholesterol. To determine if such HDL reduction correlates with a change in ABCA1 or ABCG1 expression, their expressions were measured in THP-1 monocytes and mice treated with LPS. LPS treatment leads to a rapid, dose-dependent increase of ABCA1 but not ABCG1 mRNA expression. Analysis of mouse livers showed that LPS treatment decreases expression of CYP7A, another target gene of LXR. When THP-1 cells were transfected with the ABCA1 promoter construct (-928 to +101 bp), promoter activity was significantly increased by treatment of 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol but not by LPS. Together, these studies show that LPS regulates ABCA1 expression through an LXR-independent mechanism. Further studies showed that treatment with Rhodobacter sphaeroiders LPS, an LPS antagonist, or PD169316, a specific p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, prevented the induction of ABCA1 by LPS. Therefore, this suggests that both transport of LPS from the plasma membrane to an intracellular site and activation of p38 MAP kinase are involved in the LPS-mediated induction of ABCA1.
The prevalence of obesity and atherosclerosis has substantially increased worldwide over the past several decades. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), as fatty acids sensors, have been therapeutic targets in several human lipid metabolic diseases, such as obesity, atherosclerosis, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and liver X receptors (LXRs) were also reported as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of obesity and atherosclerosis, respectively. Further clarification of the internal relationships between these three lipid metabolic nuclear receptors is necessary to enable drug discovery. In this review, we mainly summarized the cross-talk of PPARs-CAR in obesity and PPARs-LXRs in atherosclerosis.
Despite the important role of apolipoprotein E (apoE) secretion from astrocytes in brain lipid metabolism and the strong association of apoE4, one of the human apoE isoforms, with sporadic and late onset forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) little is known about the regulation of astrocytic apoE. Utilizing annotated chemical libraries and a phenotypic screening strategy that measured apoE secretion from a human astrocytoma cell line, inhibition of pan class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) was identified as a mechanism to increase apoE secretion. Knocking down select HDAC family members alone or in combination revealed that inhibition of the class I HDAC family was responsible for enhancing apoE secretion. Knocking down LXRα and LXRβ genes revealed that the increase in astrocytic apoE in response to HDAC inhibition occurred via an LXR-independent pathway. Collectively, these data suggest that pan class I HDAC inhibition is a novel pathway for regulating astrocytic apoE secretion.
Liver X receptor (LXR) agonists inhibit various types of tumor growth and have been applied to preclinical research. In colon cancer cells, LXR agonists induce pyroptotic cell death through the predominant cytoplasmic localisation of LXRβ. In the present study, we determined whether tumor cell death induced by LXR agonists in colon cancer cells could elicit immunogenic cell death (ICD). LXR agonist-treated-colon cancer cells exhibited translocation of calreticulin (CRT) and release of HMGB1 and ATP into the medium. Expression levels of CRT and HMGB1 were also increased in T0901317-treated Balb/c mice. Furthermore, compared with control mice, mice vaccinated with T0901317-treated CT26 cells showed reduced tumor volumes and protection against a challenge with live tumor cells. Inhibition of CRT or HMGB1 expression in CT26 cells abolished this protection in Balb/c mice. In conclusion, the LXR agonist T0901317 induces ICD in colon cancer cells. CRT exposure and HMGB1 release play a critical role in the immunogenicity of this treatment.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are involved in maintaining epidermal barrier and suppressing inflammatory responses in model systems. The LXR agonist VTP-38543 showed promising results in improving barrier function and inflammatory responses in model systems.
To assess the safety, tolerability, cellular and molecular changes, and clinical efficacy of the topical VTP-38543 in adults with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (AD).
A total of 104 ambulatory patients with mild to moderate AD were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trial between December 2015 and September 2016. VTP-38543 cream in 3 concentrations (0.05%, 0.15%, and 1.0%) or placebo was applied twice daily for 28 days. Pretreatment and posttreatment skin biopsy specimens were obtained from a subset of 33 patients. Changes in SCORing of Atopic Dermatitis, Eczema Area and Severity Index, Investigator's Global Assessment, and tissue biomarkers (by real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunostaining) were evaluated.
Topical VTP-38543 was safe and well tolerated. VTP-38543 significantly increased messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of epidermal barrier differentiation (loricrin and filaggrin, P = .02) and lipid (adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette subfamily G member 1 and sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c, P &lt; .01) measures and reduced epidermal hyperplasia markers (thickness, keratin 16 mRNA). VTP-38543 nonsignificantly suppressed cellular infiltrates and down-regulated mRNA expression of several TH17/TH22-related (phosphatidylinositol 3, S100 calcium-binding protein A12) and innate immunity (interleukin 6) markers.
Topical VTP-38543 is safe and well tolerated. Its application led to improvement in barrier differentiation and lipids. Longer-term studies are needed to clarify whether a barrier-based approach can induce meaningful suppression of immune abnormalities.

The liver X receptors (LXRs) are ligand-activated nuclear receptors with established roles in the maintenance of lipid homeostasis in multiple tissues. LXRs exert additional biological functions as negative regulators of inflammation, particularly in macrophages. However, the transcriptional responses controlled by LXRs in other myeloid cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs), are still poorly understood. Here we used gain- and loss-of-function models to characterize the impact of LXR deficiency on DC activation programs. Our results identified an LXR-dependent pathway that is important for DC chemotaxis. LXR-deficient mature DCs are defective in stimulus-induced migration in vitro and in vivo Mechanistically, we show that LXRs facilitate DC chemotactic signaling by regulating the expression of CD38, an ectoenzyme important for leukocyte trafficking. Pharmacological or genetic inactivation of CD38 activity abolished the LXR-dependent induction of DC chemotaxis. Using the low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient (LDLR-/-) LDLR-/- mouse model of atherosclerosis, we also demonstrated that hematopoietic CD38 expression is important for the accumulation of lipid-laden myeloid cells in lesions, suggesting that CD38 is a key factor in leukocyte migration during atherogenesis. Collectively, our results demonstrate that LXRs are required for the efficient emigration of DCs in response to chemotactic signals during inflammation.
Dopaminergic (DA) neurons derived from bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) maybe a valuable source for cell replacement therapy in Parkinson disease. Recent studies showed that new functions of LXR and their ligands have been proposed to prevent PD in the adult nervous system. The present study was designed to observe the effect of liver X receptors (LXR) agonist on differentiation of rat BMSCs into DA neurons. Expressions of the neuronal markers (Tuj1 and Nestin), the specific marker of DA neurons (tyrosine hydroxylase, TH), LXR α and LXR β were measured by immunocytochemical assay and TH/Tuj1 positive cells were determined by quantitative cell count analyses. mRNA expressions of LXR α, LXR β, TH, DAT, Nurr1, Pitx3, En1 and Lmx1b were measured by qPCR. Compared with growth factors (GF) treated group, combined use of LXR and GF induced rat BMSCs to TH-expressing cells with 87.42% of efficiency in 6 days of period of induction. LXR agonist alone did not induce the differentiation. Compared with GF alone, combined use of LXR and GF increased expressions of LXR α and LXR β protein and mRNA and TH, DAT, Nurr1, and Pitx3 mRNA, decreased expressions of En1 and Lmx1b mRNA. Our experimental results indicated that LXR activation leads to improve induction efficiency and shorten induction period of rat BMSCs into DA neuron-like cells through regulating DA development-related genes expressions and that LXR can be considered as a candidate target for drug development to improve differentiation of BMSCs into DA neurons.
LXRβ-selective agonists are promising candidates to improve atherosclerosis without increasing plasma or hepatic TG levels. We have reported a series of tetrachlorophthalimide analogs as an LXRβ-selective agonist. However, they exhibited poor aqueous solubility probably due to its high hydrophobicity and highly rigid and plane structure. In this report, we present further structural development of tetrachloro(styrylphenyl)phthalimides as the LXRβ-selective agonists with improved aqueous solubility.
Ouabagenin (OBG) is an aglycone of the cardiotonic steroid ouabain and until now was considered a biologically inactive biosynthetic precursor. Herein, we revealed that OBG functions as a novel class of ligand for the liver X receptor (LXR). Luciferase reporter assays and in silico docking studies suggested that OBG has LXR-selective agonistic activity. In addition, OBG repressed the expression of epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), a LXR target gene, without causing hepatic steatosis, a typical side effect of conventional LXR ligands. This remarkable biological activity can be attributed to a unique mode of action; the LXR agonist activity mainly proceeds through the LXRβ subtype without affecting LXRα, unlike conventional LXR ligands. Thus, OBG is a novel class of LXR ligand that does not cause severe side effects, with potential for use as an antihypertensive diuretic or a tool compound for exploring LXR subtype-specific biological functions.
The retinoid X receptors (RXR), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), and liver X receptors (LXR) all have been shown to regulate bone homeostasis. Tributyltin (TBT) is an environmental contaminant that is a dual RXRα/β and PPARγ agonist. TBT induces RXR, PPARγ, and LXR-mediated gene transcription and suppresses osteoblast differentiation in vitro. Bone marrow multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells derived from female C57BL/6J mice were more sensitive to suppression of osteogenesis by TBT than those derived from male mice. In vivo, oral gavage of 12 week old female, C57Bl/6J mice with 10 mg/kg TBT for 10 weeks resulted in femurs with a smaller cross-sectional area and thinner cortex. Surprisingly, TBT induced significant increases in trabecular thickness, number, and bone volume fraction. TBT treatment did not change the Rankl:Opg RNA ratio in whole bone, and histological analyses showed that osteoclasts in the trabecular space were minimally reduced. In contrast, expression of cardiotrophin-1, an osteoblastogenic cytokine secreted by osteoclasts, increased. In primary bone marrow macrophage cultures, TBT marginally inhibited the number of osteoclasts that differentiated, in spite of significantly suppressing expression of osteoclast markers Nfatc1, Acp5, and Ctsk and resorptive activity. TBT induced expression of RXR- and LXR-dependent genes in whole bone and in vitro osteoclast cultures. However, only an RXR antagonist, but not an LXR antagonist, significantly inhibited TBTs ability to suppress osteoclast differentiation. These results suggest that TBT has distinct effects on cortical versus trabecular bone, likely resulting from independent effects on osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation that are mediated through RXR.
Phytosterols are stucturally correlated to the endogenous ligands of Liver X Receptor (LXR), a ligand-activated nuclear receptor that has emerged as an attractive drug target due to its ability to integrate metabolic and inflammatory signaling. Natural and semi-synthetic phytosterol derivatives characterized by the presence of side-chain oxygenated functions have shown to be able to modulate LXR activity. Here, we describe the efficient synthesis of four stigmastane derivatives, endowed with a hydroxyl group at C24 position, namely (24R)- and (24S)-stigmasta-5,28-diene-3β,24-ols (also referred to as saringosterols, 10a and 10b) and (24R)- and (24S)-stigmasta-5-ene-3β,24-ols (11a and 11b), starting from the readily available stigmasterol. Thanks to X-ray crystallography the absolute configuration of the newly created chiral centers was definitively assigned for all the four compounds. The subsequent luciferase assays with GAL-4 chimeric receptors evidenced the ability of the two 24(S)-epimers, 10b and 11b, to interact with LXRs, showing the same degree of affinity as (22R)-hydroxycholesterol (1). With regard to the isoform selectivity both the derivatives 10b and 11b showed a preference for LXRβ, up to 4-fold in terms of efficacy for 11b. The gene expression profiling of (24S)-stigmasta-5,28-diene-3β,24-ol (10a) and (24S)-stigmasta-5-ene-3β,24-ol (11a) demonstrated the capability of both the compounds to induce the expression of four well-known LXR target genes, such as ABCA1, SREBP1c, FASN, and SCD1 in U937 monocytic cell line, thus supporting the hypothesis they were LXR positive modulators.
Therapeutic harnessing of adaptive immunity via checkpoint inhibition has transformed the treatment of many cancers. Despite unprecedented long-term responses, most patients do not respond to these therapies. Immunotherapy non-responders often harbor high levels of circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)-an immunosuppressive innate cell population. Through genetic and pharmacological approaches, we uncovered a pathway governing MDSC abundance in multiple cancer types. Therapeutic liver-X nuclear receptor (LXR) agonism reduced MDSC abundance in murine models and in patients treated in a first-in-human dose escalation phase 1 trial. MDSC depletion was associated with activation of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses in mice and patients. The LXR transcriptional target ApoE mediated these effects in mice, where LXR/ApoE activation therapy elicited robust anti-tumor responses and also enhanced T cell activation during various immune-based therapies. We implicate the LXR/ApoE axis in the regulation of innate immune suppression and as a target for enhancing the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy in patients.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by beta-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation and neurofibrillary tangles formation in the brain which are associated to synaptic deficits and dementia. Liver X receptor (LXR) agonists have been demonstrated to revert of pathologic and cognitive defects in murine models of AD through the regulation of Apolipoprotein E, ATP-Binding Cassette A1 (ABCA1), by dampening neuroinflammation and also by reducing the levels of amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation in the brain. However, the role of LXR with regard to the regulation of synaptic function remains relatively understudied. In the present paper, we analyzed the in-vitro effect of the LXR agonist GW3965 on synaptic function upon exposure of primary hippocampal cultures to oligomeric amyloid-β (oAβ(1-42)). We showed that oAβ(1-42) exposure significantly decreased the density of mature (mushroom shaped) dendritic spines density and synaptic contacts number. oAβ(1-42) also modulates the expression of pre- (VGlut1, SYT1, SV2A) and post-synaptic (SHANK2, NMDA) proteins, it decreases the expression of PINK1, and increases ROCKII, and activates of caspase-3; these changes were prevented by the pre-treating neuronal cultures with GW3965. These results show further support the role of the LXR agonist GW3965 in synaptic physiology and highlight its potential as an alternative pharmacological strategy for AD.
Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) plays critical roles in inducing and exacerbating allergic diseases. Chemical compounds that induce TSLP production can enhance sensitization to antigens and exacerbate allergic inflammation. Hence, identifying such chemicals will be important to prevent an increase in allergic diseases. In the present study, we found, for the first time, that a steroid alkaloid derivative, code no. 02F04, concentration and time dependently induced mRNA expression and production of TSLP in a mouse keratinocyte cell line, PAM212. In particular, the activity of 02F04 was selective to TSLP. As an analogue of the liver X receptor (LXR) endogenous ligand, 02F04 rapidly increased ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) expression by regulating the nuclear receptor of LXR. However, instead of being inhibited by the LXR antagonist, 02F04-induced TSLP production was delayed and markedly suppressed by inhibitors of phospholipase C (PLC), pan-protein kinase C (PKC), PKCδ, Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, and IκΒ kinase 2 (IKK2). Treatment with 02F04 caused the formation of F-actin filaments surrounding the nucleus of PAM212 cells, which then disappeared following addition of ROCK inhibitor. 02F04 also induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 from 2h after treatment, with a maximum at 24h, and increased nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) promoter activity by 1.3-fold. Taken together, these results indicate that 02F04-induced TSLP production is regulated via distinct signal transduction pathways, including PLC, PKC, ROCK, ERK1/2, and NF-κB but not nuclear receptors. 02F04, with a unique skeletal structure in inducing TSLP production, can represent a potential new tool for investigating the role of TSLP in allergic diseases.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major public health concern worldwide. The aim of the present study was to observe the effect of diosgenin on NAFLD and investigate the underlying mechanisms. Diosgenin treatment increased the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) in HepG2 cells. Diosgenin significantly inhibited high glucose (HG)-induced triglyceride (TG) accumulation and sterol regulatory element‑binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) mRNA increase in HepG2 cells, which were partially abolished by the AMPK inhibitor compound C. Diosgenin also significantly inhibited the increase of liver X receptor (LXR) α mRNA induced by HG or T0901317. However, T0901317‑induced upregulation of LXRα and SREBP-1c mRNA was not blocked by compound C. Following a high-fat diet for 16 weeks, the body and liver weights of the experimental rats were significantly increased, but this effect was significantly suppressed by diosgenin. Diosgenin and fenofibrate ameliorated lipid deposition in the liver and reduced the increase of hepatic TG content. Diosgenin significantly decreased the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level, whereas fenofibrate significantly increased the ALT and aspartate aminotransferase levels. Diosgenin also increased AMPK and ACC phosphorylation and suppressed LXRα in the liver. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggested that diosgenin is a potential agent for preventing the development of NAFLD through the AMPK and LXR signaling pathways.
What is the central question of this study? The liver X receptor (LXR) has been reported to regulate several membrane transporters. It is imperative to investigate whether LXR activation regulates SGLT2-mediated glucose transport in human renal proximal tubular cells. What is the main finding and its importance? Liver X receptor activation inhibits SGLT2 transport function in normal and high-glucose conditions via reduction of SGLT2 protein expression. Liver X receptors (LXRs) are members of a nuclear receptor family consisting of two isoforms, LXRα and LXRβ. They play a major role in energy metabolism, including lipid and glucose metabolism. Recent studies reported that LXRs regulate plasma glucose, although the mechanism is still uncertain. The present study investigated whether LXR activation regulates sodium glucose cotransporter2 (SGLT2) in human renal proximal tubular cells. LXR agonists, T0901317 and GW3965, inhibited SGLT2-mediated glucose uptake in a concentration-dependent manner. The effect of T0901317 and GW3965 was attenuated by a LXR antagonist, fenofibrate. Activation of the retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist, bexarotene, potentiates the inhibitory effect of these ligands. Thus, the inhibitory effect of LXR agonists on SGLT2 was mediated and facilitated by LXR and RXR activation, respectively. In addition, the inhibitory effect of LXR agonists was not mediated by cytotoxicity. Exposing HK-2 cells, a renal proximal tubular cell line, to LXR agonists significantly reduced the maximal transport rate of SGLT2 without any effect on transporter affinity. Western blot analysis revealed that LXR activation significantly decreased protein expression of SGLT2 with no change in mRNA level. In addition, LXR activation inhibited canagliflozin-sensitive short-circuit current, which represents SGLT2-mediated glucose transport in a polarized human renal proximal tubular cell monolayer. Furthermore, LXR activation inhibited the transport function of SGLT2 in hyperglycaemic conditions. As such, this study represents evidence for the inhibitory effect of LXR activation on glucose transport in human renal proximal tubular cells.
The DAF-12 receptor in nematodes and the Liver X Receptor (LXR) in mammals are structurally related transcription factors that play key roles in determining the life span of the organism. Both types of receptors are activated by oxysterols, cholesterol metabolites with oxidized side chains. Restricting the movement of the oxysterol side chain to certain orientations may have profound effects in the activity profile, however this has not been explored so far. In a first attempt to obtain analogues of natural ligands of DAF-12 and LXR with restricted side chain mobility we introduced a 16,22-oxygen bridge in 26-hydroxycholesterol, a cholestenoic acid and a dafachronic acid (5-7). Diosgenin was used as starting material, the key step to obtain the 16,22 epoxy functionality was the one pot formation and reduction of a cyclic hemiketal via the oxocarbenium ion using sodium cyanoborohydride. All new compounds were characterized by NMR and mass spectrometry and assayed as ceDAF-12 or LXR ligands in transactivation cell-based assays. The dafachronic acid analogue 7 behaved as a ceDAF-12 agonist.
At least with regard to promotion and progression of cancer, oxysterols actually appear as typical Janus molecules, by inducing early inflammatory reaction against cancer expansion and apoptotic death of cancer cells, but on the other hand sustaining a complex survival signaling pathway that eventually turns in favor of the neoplastic process itself. The pro-tumoral and anti-tumoral properties of this class of compounds is mediated by both LXR-dependent and independent mechanisms. The extent of oxidative redox imbalance, moderate or extensive, likely plays a key role in determining the actual effects operated by oxysterols along the various steps of carcinogenesis.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) α and β are nuclear receptors whose transcriptional activity is regulated by oxysterols, the oxidized forms of cholesterol. Described in the late 1990s as lipid sensors, both LXRs regulate cholesterol and fatty acid homeostasis. Over the years, deep phenotypic analyses of mouse models deficient for LXRα and/or LXRβ have pointed out various other physiological functions including glucose homeostasis, immunology, and neuroprotection. This review enlightens the "endocrine" functions of LXRs; they deeply impact plasma glucose directly and by modulating insulin signaling, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, thyroid and pituitary hormone levels, and bone homeostasis. Besides, LXR signaling is also involved in adrenal physiology, steroid synthesis, and male and female reproduction. Hence, LXRs are definitely involved in the endocrine system and could thus be considered as endocrine receptors, even though oxysterols do not fully correspond to the definition of hormones. Finally, because they are ligand-regulated transcription factors, LXRs are potential pharmacological targets with promising beneficial metabolic effects.
Hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase 2B1b (SULT2B1b) sulfates cholesterol and oxysterols. Hepatic oval cells (HOCs), thought to be progenitor cells, can be triggered in chemically injured livers. The present study focused on the role of SULT2B1b in HOC proliferation after liver injury. Our experiments revealed that the expression of SULT2B1b was increased dramatically in a chemical-induced liver injury model, mainly in HOCs. Upon challenge with a hepatotoxic diet containing 0.1 % 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC), SULT2B1-/- mice presented alleviated liver injury and less HOC proliferation compared with wild-type (WT) mice, and these findings were verified by serum analysis, histopathology, immunofluorescence staining, RNA-seq, and Western blotting. HOCs derived from SULT2B1-/- mice showed lower proliferative capability than those from WT mice. SULT2B1b overexpression promoted growth of the WB-F344 hepatic oval cell line, whereas SULT2B1b knockdown inhibited growth of these cells. The IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway also was promoted by SULT2B1b. Liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry indicated that the levels of 22-hydroxycholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, and 24,25-epoxycholesterol were higher in the DDC-injured livers of SULT2B1-/- mice than in livers of WT mice. The above oxysterols are physiological ligands of liver X receptors (LXRs), and SULT2B1b suppressed oxysterol-induced LXR activation. Additional in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that LXR activation could inhibit HOC proliferation and the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway, and these effects could be reversed by SULT2B1b. Our data indicate that upregulation of SULT2B1b might promote HOC proliferation and aggravate liver injury via the suppression of oxysterol-induced LXR activation in chemically induced mouse liver injury.
There is growing evidence highlighting the ability of nuclear receptors to control not only metabolism, but also inflammation and cancer progression. In particular liver X receptors (LXRs), the nuclear receptors physiologically involved in cholesterol homeostasis, have been shown to regulate innate and adaptive immune responses in many pathological conditions, including cancer.We have recently demonstrated that LXR ligands (oxysterols) released by tumor cells may have an immunomodulatory role, affecting the immune cells involved in the antitumor immune response. Indeed, oxysterols inhibit the expression of the chemokine receptor CCR7 on dendritic cells (DC) in an LXR-dependent manner, thus impairing DC migration to secondary lymphoid organs, and therefore dampening the induction of successful antitumor responses.We have resorted to direct (i.e., luciferase-based LXR activation assay) and indirect (i.e., activation of LXR target genes in dendritic cells) methods in order to assess the presence of LXR ligands (oxysterols) in tumor-conditioned media.These two methods are also suitable to study strategies to block oxysterol release by tumor cells. 
Liver X receptor (LXR) has been exploited widely as a drug target in breast cancer treatment, and various mechanisms underlying the effects of LXR in this area are well studied. The activated LXR plays important roles in estrogen receptor α (ERα) breast cancer cells, such as reducing cell proliferation and arresting cell cycle progression. Different LXR ligands have diverse effects on the development of breast cancer, such as the inhibitory effect of oxysterol, which can return cells to normocholesterol conditions and target other metabolic genes. Moreover, 27-hydroxycholesterol, a locally produced cholesterol metabolite, reportedly promotes the proliferation of ERα breast cancer cells in vitro and facilitates tumor metastasis with other LXR ligands. Moreover, the expression of LXR also exerts potential effects on immune surveillance, tumor immunity, and tumor microenvironment. These advances in breast cancer research indicate that LXR may be a new therapeutic target to treat the refractory or drug-resistant subtypes of breast cancer. 
27-Hydroxycholesterol (27OH) is a strong suppressor of cholesterol synthesis and a weak activator of LXR in vitro. The regulatory importance of 27OH in vivo is controversial. Here we utilized male mice with increased levels of 27OH either due to increased production (CYP27A1 transgenic mice) or reduced metabolism (Cyp7b1-/- mice). We also used mice lacking 27OH due to a knockout of Cyp27a1. The latter mice were treated with cholic acid to compensate for reduced bile acid synthesis. The effects of the different levels of 27OH on Srebp- and other LXR-regulated genes in the liver were investigated. In the liver of CYP27tg mice we found a modest increase of the mRNA levels corresponding to the LXR target genes Cyp7b1 and Abca1. A number of other LXR-regulated genes were not affected. The effect on Abca1 mRNA was not seen in the liver of Cyp7b1-/- mice. There were little or no effects on cholesterol synthesis. In the liver of the Cyp27-/- mice treated with 0.025% cholic acid there was no significant effect of the knockout on the LXR target genes. In a previous work triple-knockout mice deficient in the biosynthesis of 24S-hydroxycholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol and 27OH were shown to have impaired response to dietary cholesterol, suggesting side-chain oxidized oxysterols to be mediators in cholesterol-induced effects on LXR target genes at a transcriptional level (Chen W. et al., Cell Metab. 5 (2007) 73-79). The hydroxylated oxysterol responsible for the effect was not defined. We show here that treatment of wildtype mice with dietary cholesterol under the same conditions as in the above study induced the LXR target genes Lpl, Abcg8 and Srebp1c in wild type mice but failed to activate the same genes in mice lacking 27-hydroxycholesterol due to a knockout of Cyp27. We failed to demonstrate the above effects at the protein level (Abcg8) or at the activity level (Lpl). The results suggest that 27OH is not an important regulator of Srebp- or LXR regulated genes under basal conditions in mouse liver. On the other hand 27OH appears to mediate cholesterol-induced effects on some LXR target genes at a transcriptional level under some in vivo conditions.
Cell migration via chemokine receptor CCR7 expression is an essential function of the immune system. We previously showed that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), an important immunomodulatory molecule, increases CCR7 expression and function in monocytes. Here, we explore the role of the liver X receptor α (LXRα) activation on CCR7 expression in Mono-Mac-1 (MM-1) cells in the presence of PGE2. To do this, MM-1 cells were stimulated with the LXRα synthetic agonist T0901317 in the presence or absence of PGE2. CCR7 mRNA transcription was measured using quantitative RT-PCR and protein expression was examined using flow cytometry. CCR7 function was analyzed using migration assays in response to CCL19/CCL21, which are natural ligands for CCR7. Our results show that agonist-mediated activation of LXRα in the presence of PGE2 increases CCR7 mRNA transcription and MM-1 cell migratory capacity in response to CCL19/21. In addition, our results demonstrate that engagement of the E-prostanoids 2 and 4 (EP2/EP4) receptors present on MM-1 cells is responsible for the observed increase in CCR7 mRNA expression and function during LXRα activation. Examination of monocyte migration in response to lipid derivatives such as PGE2 and oxysterols that are produced at sites of chronic inflammation would contribute to understanding the excessive monocyte migration that characterizes atherosclerosis. 
Oxysterols are cholesterol-oxygenated derivatives generated in the organism and also present in foods because of cholesterol oxidation during processing and storage. They are the natural ligands of liver X receptors (LXRs) and are generally recognized as hypocholesterolemic and anti-inflammatory molecules although this latter property is still controversial. Most oxysterol studies have been performed in macrophages, whereas the effects of oxysterols in neutrophils are poorly known. In this study, human neutrophils were exposed to two different oxysterols, 7-keto-cholesterol (7-k-chol) and 25-hydroxy-cholesterol (25-OH-chol), and their possible participation in inflammatory process was evaluated.
Human neutrophils were incubated with 7-k-chol and 25-OH-chol, and ROS production, translocation of the NADPH oxidase cytosolic components, hemoxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and lysozyme secretion were analyzed.
An increase in ROS production was observed within a short period of time (minutes) with both molecules. These oxysterols also stimulated the cellular membrane translocation of the NADPH oxidase cytosolic components, p47phox and p67phox. On the other hand, HO-1 expression, a cytoprotector enzyme, is inhibited in human neutrophils upon oxysterols treatment. Moreover, both oxysterols were associated with high lysozyme enzyme secretion at 5 and 18 h of incubation.
The present paper describes for the first time that two oxysterols (7-k-chol and 25-OH-chol) enhance the ROS production within a short period of time in human neutrophils, stimulate the translocation of the cytosolic components of NADPH oxidase to the cellular membrane and increase lysozyme secretion. These data suggest that both oxysterols are able to activate pro-inflammatory effects in human neutrophils which contrasts with the role assigned to the oxysterols when they act through LXR at long time of incubation.
Macrophages play a crucial role in atherosclerosis progression. Classically activated M1 macrophages have been found in rupture-prone atherosclerotic plaques whereas alternatively activated macrophages, M2, localize in stable plaque. Macrophage accumulation of cholesterol and of its oxidized derivatives (oxysterols) leads to the formation of foam cells, a hallmark of atherosclerotic lesions. In this study, the effects of oxysterols in determining the functional polarization of human macrophages were investigated. Monocytes, purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy donors, were differentiated into macrophages (M0) and treated with an oxysterol mixture, cholesterol, or ethanol, every 4 H for a total of 4, 8, and 12 H. The administration of the compounds was repeated in order to maintain the levels of oxysterols constant throughout the treatment. Compared with ethanol treatment, the oxysterol mixture decreased the surface expression of CD36 and CD204 scavenger receptors and reduced the amount of reactive oxygen species whereas it did not affect either cell viability or matrix metalloprotease-9 activity. Moreover, the oxysterol mixture increased the expression of both liver X receptor α and ATP-binding cassette transporter 1. An enhanced secretion of the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10 accompanied these events. The results supported the hypothesis that the constant levels of oxysterols and, in particular, of 27-hydroxycholesterol stimulate macrophage polarization toward the M2 immunomodulatory functional phenotype, contributing to the stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques.
Targeting the tumor microenvironment focusing on immune cells has recently become a standard of care for some tumors. Indeed, antibodies blocking immune checkpoints (e.g., anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD1 mAbs) have been approved by regulatory agencies for the treatment of some solid tumors based upon successes in many clinical trials. Although tumor metabolism has always attracted the attention of tumor biologists, only recently have oncologists renewed their interest in this field of tumor biology research. This has highlighted the possibility to pharmacologically target rate-limiting enzymes along key metabolic pathways of tumor cells, such as lipogenesis and aerobic glycolysis. Altered tumor metabolism has also been shown to influence the functionality of the tumor microenvironment as a whole, particularly the immune cell component of thereof. Cholesterol, oxysterols and Liver X receptors (LXRs) have been investigated in different tumor models. Recent in vitro and in vivo results point to their involvement in tumor and immune cell biology, thus making the LXR/oxysterol axis a possible target for novel antitumor strategies. Indeed, the possibility to target both tumor cell metabolism (i.e., cholesterol metabolism) and tumor-infiltrating immune cell dysfunctions induced by oxysterols might result in a synergistic antitumor effect generating long-lasting memory responses. This review will focus on the role of cholesterol metabolism with particular emphasis on the role of the LXR/oxysterol axis in the tumor microenvironment, discussing mechanisms of action, pros and cons, and strategies to develop antitumor therapies based on the modulation of this axis. 
Cholesterol is a major component of membrane lipids. Thus, adjusting the membrane cholesterol composition is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake by LDL receptors are tightly regulated at the transcriptional level through negative feedback control, which is mediated by sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). In particular, SREBP-2 is activated in a cholesterol-dependent manner and, thus, is significantly involved in regulating the expression of those genes associated with cholesterol metabolism. Cholesterol metabolites such as oxysterols are involved in regulating sterol metabolism by binding to the nuclear receptor, liver X receptor (LXR). Cholesterol catabolites, i.e., bile acids, are agonists for another nuclear receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and a bile acid receptor, TGR5. Activated FXR regulates bile acid metabolism and TGR5 improves glucose metabolism through the actions of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). 
Since the first cloning of the human estrogen receptor (ER) α in 1986 and the subsequent cloning of human ERβ, there has been extensive investigation of the role of estrogen/ER. Estrogens/ER play important roles not only in sexual development and reproduction but also in a variety of other functions in multiple tissues. Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs) are ER lignds that act as agonists or antagonists depending on the target genes and tissues, and until recently, only synthetic SERMs have been recognized. However, the discovery of the first endogenous SERM, 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC), opened a new dimension of ER action in health and disease. In addition to the identification of 27HC as a SERM, oxysterols have been recently demonstrated as indirect modulators of ER through interaction with the nuclear receptor Liver X Receptor (LXR) β. In this review, the recent progress on these novel roles of oxysterols in ER modulation is summarized. 
The schweinfurthins have potent antiproliferative activity in multiple glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cell lines; however, the mechanism by which growth is impeded is not fully understood. Previously, we demonstrated that the schweinfurthins reduce the level of key isoprenoid intermediates in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Herein, we describe the effects of the schweinfurthins on cholesterol homeostasis. Intracellular cholesterol levels are greatly reduced in cells incubated with 3-deoxyschweinfurthin B (3dSB), an analog of the natural product schweinfurthin B. Decreased cholesterol levels are due to decreased cholesterol synthesis and increased cholesterol efflux; both of these cellular actions can be influenced by liver X-receptor (LXR) activation. The effects of 3dSB on ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 levels and other LXR targets are similar to that of 25-hydroxycholesterol, an LXR agonist. Unlike 25-hydroxycholesterol, 3dSB does not act as a direct agonist for LXR α or β. These data suggest that cholesterol homeostasis plays a significant role in the growth inhibitory activity of the schweinfurthins and may elucidate a mechanism that can be targeted in human cancers such as GBM. 
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic hepatic disorder affecting up to 25% of the general population. Several intracellular events leading to NAFLD and progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) have been identified, including lipid accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Emerging evidence has suggested the cooperation of both hepatic free fatty acids (FFAs) and cholesterol (FC) accumulation in NAFLD development. Oxysterols, oxidized derivatives of cholesterol were reported as activating ligands of Liver X Receptors. Interestingly, serum levels of agonist oxysterols such as 25-HC and 27-HC are significantly increased in NAFLD patients. By contrast, 22-s- HC is considered an antagonist ligand of LXRα. 22-s-Hc down-regulated expression of the FAS gene through an LXRE located in the promoter and abolished the effect of the synthetic LXRα agonist. In addition it has been reported that 22-s-HC attenuated hepatic steatogenesis in a mouse model of high-fat-induced fatty liver. Very recently, it has been demonstrated that the inhibition of LXRα by 22-s-HC dramatically represses steatosis and HIF-1 mediated activation of MCP-1 in ethanol-induced fatty liver injury in hepatocytes as well as in Kupferr cells. Our data demonstrated that High fat diet (HF) caused liver steatosis while an atherogenic diet (ATH) diet induced hepatocellular ballooning, but only the Ath+HF diet resulted in steatohepatitis with associated mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired mitochondriogenesis. We identified in the the oxysterol cholestane-3beta,5alpha,6beta-triol (Triol) the molecule able to impair mitochondrial respiration and mitochondriogenesis by down-regulation of PGC1-alpha, mTFA and NRF1 signal. It seems that the role of oxysterols in the pathogenesis of human diseases, particularly in fat induced injury, should take into account the possible disruption of the balance between activation and inhibition of LXR signalling. Development of LXRα that specifically control inflammation and hepatic lipogenesis may provide novel therapeutics that block the development and progression of NAFLD. 
Prevalence of vitamin D (VD) deficiency and its association with the risk of cardiovascular disease prompted us to evaluate the effect of VD status on lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic microswine.
Yucatan microswine were fed with VD-deficient (0 IU/d), VD-sufficient (1000 IU/d), or VD-supplemented (3000 IU/d) high-cholesterol diet for 48 weeks. Serum lipids and 25(OH)-cholecalciferol levels were measured biweekly. Histology and biochemical parameters of liver and arteries were analyzed. Effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on cholesterol metabolism was examined in human hepatocyte carcinoma cell line (HepG2) and human monocytic cell line (THP-1) macrophage-derived foam cells. VD deficiency decreased plasma high-density lipoprotein levels, expression of liver X receptors, ATP-binding membrane cassette transporter A1, and ATP-binding membrane cassette transporter G1 and promoted cholesterol accumulation and atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic microswine. VD promoted nascent high-density lipoprotein formation in HepG2 cells via ATP-binding membrane cassette transporter A1-mediated cholesterol efflux. Cytochrome P450 (CYP)27B1 and VD receptor were predominantly present in the CD206(+) M2 macrophage foam cell-accumulated cores in coronary artery plaques. 1,25(OH)2D3 increased the expression of liver X receptors, ATP-binding membrane cassette transporter A1, and ATP-binding membrane cassette transporter G1 and promoted cholesterol efflux in THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells. 1,25(OH)2D3 decreased intracellular free cholesterol and polarized macrophages to M2 phenotype with decreased expression of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6 under lipopolysaccharide stimulation. 1,25(OH)2D3 markedly induced CYP27A1 expression via a VD receptor-dependent c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) 1/2 signaling pathway and increased 27-hydroxycholesterol levels, which induced liver X receptors, ATP-binding membrane cassette transporter A1, and ATP-binding membrane cassette transporter G1 expression and stimulated cholesterol efflux that was inhibited by VD receptor antagonist and JNK1/2 signaling inhibitor in THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cell.
VD protects against atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic swine via controlling cholesterol efflux and macrophage polarization via increased CYP27A1 activation.
24(S)-Hydroxycholesterol (24S-OHC), which is enzymatically produced in the brain, has been known to play an important role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis in the brain and has been proposed as a possible biomarker of neurodegenerative disease. Recent studies have revealed diverse functions of 24S-OHC and gained increased attention. For example, 24S-OHC at sublethal concentrations has been found to induce an adaptive response via activation of the liver X receptor signaling pathway, thereby protecting neuronal cells against subsequent oxidative stress. It has also been found that physiological concentrations of 24S-OHC suppress amyloid-β production via downregulation of amyloid precursor protein trafficking in neuronal cells. On the other hand, high concentrations of 24S-OHC have been found to induce a type of nonapoptotic programmed cell death in neuronal cells expressing little caspase-8. Because neuronal cell death induced by 24S-OHC has been found to proceed by a unique mechanism, which is different from but in some ways similar to necroptosis-necroptosis being a type of programmed necrosis induced by tumor necrosis factor α-neuronal cell death induced by 24S-OHC has been called "necroptosis-like" cell death. 24S-OHC-induced cell death is dependent on the formation of 24S-OHC esters but not on oxidative stress. This review article discusses newly reported aspects of 24S-OHC in neuronal cell death and sheds light on the possible importance of controlling 24S-OHC levels in the brain for preventing neurodegenerative disease. 
The identification of new pathways governing myelination provides innovative avenues for remyelination. Liver X receptors (LXRs) α and β are nuclear receptors activated by oxysterols that originated from the oxidation of cholesterol. They are crucial for cholesterol homeostasis, a major lipid constituent of myelin sheaths that are formed by oligodendrocytes. However, the role of LXRs in myelin generation and maintenance is poorly understood. Here, we show that LXRs are involved in myelination and remyelination processes. LXRs and their ligands are present in oligodendrocytes. We found that mice invalidated for LXRs exhibit altered motor coordination and spatial learning, thinner myelin sheaths, and reduced myelin gene expression. Conversely, activation of LXRs by either 25-hydroxycholesterol or synthetic TO901317 stimulates myelin gene expression at the promoter, mRNA, and protein levels, directly implicating LXRα/β in the transcriptional control of myelin gene expression. Interestingly, activation of LXRs also promotes oligodendroglial cell maturation and remyelination after lysolecithin-induced demyelination of organotypic cerebellar slice cultures. Together, our findings represent a conceptual advance in the transcriptional control of myelin gene expression and strongly support a new role of LXRs as positive modulators in central (re)myelination processes. 
The aim of this review is to explore the role of mitochondria in regulating macrophage sterol homeostasis and inflammatory responses within the aetiology of atherosclerosis. Macrophage generation of oxysterol activators of liver X receptors (LXRs), via sterol 27-hydroxylase, is regulated by the rate of flux of cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membrane, via a complex of cholesterol trafficking proteins. Oxysterols are key signalling molecules, regulating the transcriptional activity of LXRs which coordinate macrophage sterol metabolism and cytokine production, key features influencing the impact of these cells within atherosclerotic lesions. The precise identity of the complex of proteins mediating mitochondrial cholesterol trafficking in macrophages remains a matter of debate, but may include steroidogenic acute regulatory protein and translocator protein. There is clear evidence that targeting either of these proteins enhances removal of cholesterol via LXRα-dependent induction of ATP binding cassette transporters (ABCA1, ABCG1) and limits the production of inflammatory cytokines; interventions which influence mitochondrial structure and bioenergetics also impact on removal of cholesterol from macrophages. Thus, molecules which can sustain or improve mitochondrial structure, the function of the electron transport chain, or increase the activity of components of the protein complex involved in cholesterol transfer, may therefore have utility in limiting or regressing atheroma development, reducing the incidence of coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction. 
Cholesterol metabolism is important for neuronal function in the central nervous system (CNS). The oxysterol 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) is a cholesterol metabolite that crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and may be a useful substitutive marker for neurodegenerative diseases. However, the effects of 27-OHC on learning and memory and the underlying mechanisms are unclear. To determine this mechanism, we investigated learning and memory and cholesterol metabolism in rat brain following the injection of various doses of 27-OHC into the caudal vein. We found that 27-OHC increased cholesterol levels and upregulated the expression of liver X receptor-α (LXR-α) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporter protein family member A1 (ABCA1). In addition, 27-OHC decreased the expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CR) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) in rat brain tissues. These findings suggest that 27-OHC may negatively modulate cognitive effects and cholesterol metabolism in the brain.
Liver X receptor is a ligand-activated transcription factor, which is mainly involved in cholesterol homeostasis, bile acid and triglycerides metabolism, and, as recently discovered, in the glucose metabolism by direct regulation of liver glucokinase. Its modulation by exogenous factors, such as drugs, industrial by-products, and chemicals is documented. Owing to the abundance of these synthetic molecules in the environment, and to the established target role of this receptor, a number of representative compounds of phthalate, organophosphate and fibrate classes were tested as ligands/modulators of human liver X receptor, using an integrated approach, combining an in silico molecular docking technique with an optical SPR biosensor binding study. The compounds of interest were predicted and proved to target the oxysterols-binding site of human LXRα with measurable binding kinetic constants and with affinities ranging between 4.3 × 10(-7) and 4.3 × 10(-8)M. Additionally, non-cytotoxic concentration of these chemicals induced relevant changes in the LXRα gene expression levels and other target genes (SREBP-1c and LGK) in human liver hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2), as demonstrated by q-RT-PCR.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of DNA-binding transcription factors and act as sensors of cholesterol homeostasis. Under normal conditions, when intracellular cholesterol concentration increases, cells synthesize oxysterols and activate the LXR transcriptional network to drive cholesterol efflux and reduce cholesterol influx and synthesis. During normal and cancer cell proliferation, there is a net uncoupling between intracellular cholesterol increase and LXR activation resulting from the reduced intracellular oxysterol concentration. This review dissects the novel mechanisms of a previously unrecognized metabolic uncoupling, supporting the activation of the LXR axis as a bona fide therapeutic approach in cancer.
The transcription of the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) gene, which plays a key anti-atherogenic role, is known to be induced by agonists of liver X receptors (LXRs). LXRs form obligate heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and interact with their recognition sequences in the regulatory regions of key genes implicated in the control of cholesterol, fatty acid and glucose homeostasis. We have previously shown a novel role for c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in the LXRs-mediated induction of macrophage gene expression. Protein kinase C (PKC) is often found to regulate the action of nuclear receptors and cross talk between this kinase family and JNK and/or PI3K has been shown in several settings. We have, therefore, investigated a potential role for PKC in the action of LXR/RXR agonist 22-(R)-hydroxycholesterol (22-(R)-HC)/9-cis-retinoic acid (9cRA) in THP-1 macrophages, including the induction of ABCA1 expression. The pan PKC inhibitor bisindoylmaleimide was found to attenuate the induction of ABCA1 protein expression, the activation of the JNK signaling pathway and the stimulation of activator protein-1 (AP-1) DNA binding activity in macrophages treated with 22-(R)-HC and 9cRA. The role of PKC in the action of these ligands was confirmed further by the use of more isotype-specific inhibitors. These studies, therefore, reveal a potentially important role for PKC in the action of 22-(R)-HC and 9cRA in human macrophages.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are nuclear receptors that act as ligand-dependent transcription factors forming permissive heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs). In this study we aimed to assess the effect of LXR/RXR activation on the transcriptional induction of pro-inflammatory genes including cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and microsomal prostaglandin E2 synthase-1 (mPGES-1) in activated macrophages. Our study shows that LXR ligands such as oxysterols, GW3965 or TO901317, as well as RXR ligands like 9cis retinoic acid or SR11237, decreased LPS-induced expression of COX-2 and mPGES-1. Consequently, LPS-dependent PGE2 production was substantially reduced in macrophages treated with LXR/RXR ligands. The inhibitory effects of LXR/RXR activation on LPS-induced expression of COX-2 and mPGES-1 in macrophages, occurred by a mechanism involving interference with transcriptional activation of these genes. LXR/RXR activation interfered with the activity of transcription factors essential in the up-regulation of the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in these cells, such as NFκB, but also Egr-1, which had not been previously associated with LXR-mediated gene repression. As this transcription factor is involved in the regulation of a variety of genes involved in inflammatory processes, LXR and RXR-mediated interference with Egr-1 signaling could represent an important event mediating the anti-inflammatory effects of these receptors in macrophages. 
Huntington disease (HD), an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by an abnormal expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeat in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene, is characterized by extensive neurodegeneration of striatum and cortex and severe diffuse atrophy at MRI. The expression of genes involved in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway and the amount of cholesterol, lanosterol, lathosterol and 24S-hydroxycholesterol were reduced in murine models of HD. In case of HD-patients, the decrease of plasma 24OHC follows disease progression proportionally to motor and neuropsychiatric dysfunction and MRI brain atrophy, together with lanosterol and lathosterol (markers of cholesterol synthesis), and 27-hydroxycholesterol. A significant reduction of total plasma cholesterol was observed only in advanced stages. It is likely that mutant HTT decreases the maturation of SREBP and the up-regulation LXR and LXR-targeted genes (SREBP, ABCG1 and ABCG4, HMGCoA reductase, ApoE) resulting into a lower synthesis and transport of cholesterol from astrocytes to neurons via ApoE. In primary oligodendrocytes, mutant HTT inhibited the regulatory effect of PGC1α on cholesterol metabolism and on the expression of MBP. HTT seems to play a regulatory role in lipid metabolism. The impairment of the cholesterol metabolism was found to be proportional to the CAG repeat length and to the load of mutant HTT. A dysregulation on PGC1α and mitochondria dysfunction may be involved in an overall reduction of acetyl-CoA and ATP synthesis, contributing to the cerebral and whole body cholesterol impairment. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Brain Lipids. 
Chronic ethanol consumption causes hepatic steatosis and inflammation, which are associated with liver hypoxia. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a hypoxia response factor that determines recruitment and activation of monocytes to the site of tissue injury. The level of MCP-1 is elevated in the serum and liver of patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD); however, the molecular details regarding the regulation of MCP-1 expression are not yet understood completely. Here, we show the role of liver X receptor α (LXRα) in the regulation of MCP-1 expression during the development of ethanol-induced fatty liver injury, using an antagonist, 22-S-hydroxycholesterol (22-S-HC). First, administration of 22-S-HC attenuated the signs of liver injury with decreased levels of MCP-1 and its receptor CCR2 in ethanol-fed mice. Second, hypoxic conditions or treatment with the LXRα agonist GW3965 significantly induced the expression of MCP-1, which was completely blocked by treatment with 22-S-HC or infection by shLXRα lentivirus in the primary hepatocytes. Third, over-expression of LXRα or GW3965 treatment increased MCP-1 promoter activity by increasing the binding of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α to the hypoxia response elements, together with LXRα. Finally, treatment with recombinant MCP-1 increased the level of expression of LXRα and LXRα-dependent lipid droplet accumulation in both hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. These data show that LXRα and its ligand-induced up-regulation of MCP-1 and MCP-1-induced LXRα-dependent lipogenesis play a key role in the autocrine and paracrine activation of MCP-1 in the pathogenesis of alcoholic fatty liver disease, and that this activation may provide a promising new target for ALD therapy.
Cholesterol is a risk factor for breast cancer although the mechanisms by which this occurs are not well understood. One hypothesis is that dyslipidemia results in increased cholesterol content in cell membranes, thus impacting upon membrane fluidity and subsequent signaling. In addition, studies demonstrate that the metabolite, 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC), can function as an estrogen, increasing the proliferation of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cells. This was unexpected because 27HC and other oxysterols activate the liver X receptors (LXR), resulting in a reduction of intracellular cholesterol. Resolution of this paradox will require dissection of the molecular mechanisms by which ER and LXR converge in breast cancer cells. Regardless, the observation that 27HC influences breast cancer provides a rationale for strategies that target cholesterol metabolism. 
Despite increased survivorship among patients, breast cancer remains the most common cancer among women and is the second leading cause of cancer death in women. The magnitude of this problem provides a strong impetus for new chemopreventative strategies and/or lifestyle changes that reduce cancer incidence. It is of significance, therefore, that several studies positively correlate obesity to the development of breast cancer. Importantly, obesity is also highly associated with elevated cholesterol, and cholesterol itself is a risk factor for breast cancer. Furthermore, patients taking statins demonstrate a lower breast cancer incidence and decreased recurrence. The recent observation that 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC) is produced in a stoichiometric manner from cholesterol, together with our recent demonstration that it exerts partial agonist activity on both the estrogen and liver X receptors, suggested a potential mechanistic link between hyper-cholesterolemia and breast cancer incidence. Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we have recently shown that elevation of circulating 27HC significantly increases tumor growth and metastasis in murine models of breast cancer. Further, we have demonstrated in appropriate animal models that the impact of high-fat diet on tumor pathogenesis can be mitigated by statins or by small molecule inhibitors of CYP27A1. These findings suggest that pharmacological or dietary modifications that lower total cholesterol, and by inference 27HC, are likely to reduce the impact of obesity/metabolic syndrome on breast cancer incidence.
Recent studies have revealed critical roles that nuclear receptors like LXR-α (Liver X Receptor- alpha) plays as a class of post-transcriptional gene regulator in skin development and diseases. Keeping in view the fact that LXR-α plays crucial role in keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, it becomes imperative to dissect the pathways and role of LXR-α genomics in the pathogenesis of psoriasis with ultimate aim to explore novel preventive/therapeutic strategies as treatment options. To explore the effects of agonists and activators of LXR-α on its own gene expression and the putative targets in psoriatic keratinocytes. Identification of promoter sequences for (vitamin D receptor) VDR and Catalase were done using in silico analysis followed by β-galactosidase (β-gal) reporter plasmid assay in keratinocytes from clinically heathy subjects. Determination of relative levels of LXR-α,VDR and catalase in control versus treated cells upon activation of LXR-α with Atorvastatin + 22R hydroxycholestrol and Ascorbic acid + 22R hydroxycholestrol was done by PCR and Cell Proliferation Assay. The cells transfected with the reporter plasmid element for VDR and catalase showed more than 5 and 4 fold increase respectively in the β-gal activity compared to the control. An increase of 55% in LXR-α gene expression at RNA level was observed in Atorvastatin + 22-R hydroxycholestrol compared to 24% in Ascorbic acid + 22-ROH cholesterol. The expression of the VDR and Catalase was significantly increased in both treated keratinocytes compared to its normal counterpart.
Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is characterized histopathologically by the deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles-containing hyperphosphorylated tau protein in the brain. Parkinson's disease (PD), the most common movement disorder, is characterized by the aggregation of α-synuclein protein in Lewy body inclusions and the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Based on their pathological signatures, AD and PD can be considered as two different disease entities. However, a subpopulation of PD patients also exhibit Aβ plaques, and AD patients exhibit α-synuclein aggregates. This overlap between PD and AD suggests that common pathological pathways exist for the two diseases. Identification of factors and cellular mechanisms by which these factors can trigger pathological hallmarks for AD/PD overlap may help in designing disease-modifying therapies that can reverse or stop the progression of AD and PD. For the last decade, work in our laboratory has shown that fluctuations in the levels of cholesterol oxidation products (oxysterols) may correlate with the onset of AD and PD. In this review, we will provide results from our laboratory and data from literature that converge to strongly suggest the involvement of cholesterol and cholesterol oxidation products in the pathogenesis of AD and PD. We will specifically delineate the role of and the underlying mechanisms by which increased levels of the oxysterol 27-hydroxycholesterol contribute to the pathogenesis of AD, PD, and AD/PD overlap. 
The Liver X Receptors (LXRs) are critical transcriptional regulators of cellular metabolism that promote cholesterol efflux and lipogenesis in response to excess intracellular cholesterol. In contrast, the Sterol Response Element Binding Protein-2 (SREBP2) promotes the synthesis and uptake of cholesterol. Oxysterols are products of cholesterol oxidation that accumulate in conditions associated with increased cellular levels of reactive oxygen species, such as hypoxia and oxidative stress, activating LXR and inhibiting SREBP2. While hypoxia and oxidative stress are commonly implicated in placental injury, the impact of the transcriptional regulation of cholesterol homeostasis on placental function is not well characterized.
We measured the effects of the synthetic LXR ligand T0901317 and the endogenous oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol (25OHC) on differentiation, cytotoxicity, progesterone synthesis, lipid droplet formation, and gene expression in primary human trophoblasts.
Exposure to T0901317 promoted lipid droplet formation and inhibited differentiation, while 25OHC induced trophoblast toxicity, promoted hCG and progesterone release at lower concentrations with inhibition at higher concentrations, and had no effect on lipid droplet formation. The discrepant effect of these ligands was associated with distinct changes in expression of LXR and SREBP2 target genes, with upregulation of ABCA1 following 25OHC and T090317 exposure, exclusive activation of the lipogenic LXR targets SREBP1c, ACC1 and FAS by T0901317, and exclusive inhibition of the SREBP2 targets LDLR and HMGCR by 25OHC.
These findings implicate cholesterol oxidation as a determinant of trophoblast function and activity, and suggest that placental gene targets and functional pathways are selectively regulated by specific LXR ligands.
Preeclampsia is a serious pregnancy complication. Soluble endoglin (sEng) is released from the placenta and contributes to the maternal endothelial dysfunction seen in preeclampsia. Recently oxysterols, which activate the Liver X Receptor (LXR), have been implicated in producing sEng, by upregulating matrix metalloproteinase-14 (MMP14; cleaves endoglin to produce sEng) and down-regulating tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3; inhibitor of MMP14). The functional experiments in that study were performed on JAR cells (human choriocarcinoma cell line) and placental explants.
We characterized LXR in severe preeclamptic placentas, and assessed whether oxysterols increase release of sEng from primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), primary trophoblasts and placental explants. Given pravastatin is thought to block oxysterol production and inhibit the LXR, we examined whether pravastatin reduces sEng release.
LXRα and β were localized to the syncytiotrophoblast and villous tips and were significantly up-regulated in preeclamptic placenta. Oxysterols upregulated sEng production in HUVECs and placental explants although the increases were far more modest than that recently reported. Oxysterols did not upregulate sEng in primary trophoblasts. Furthermore, mRNA expression of MMP14 and TIMP-3 were not altered by oxysterols in any tissue. Surprisingly, pravastatin did not decrease oxysterol-induced upregulation of sEng.
LXR is up-regulated in preeclamptic placenta. Oxysterols upregulate sEng production from human tissues, but the increase is modest, suggesting this may not be the main mechanism for the very significant elevations in sEng seen in preeclampsia. Pravastatin does not decrease sEng production.
Oxysterols modestly up-regulate sEng production which is not quenched by pravastatin.
Cross-talk between sterol regulatory pathways and inflammatory pathways has been demonstrated to significantly impact the development of both atherosclerosis and infectious disease. The oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) plays multiple roles in lipid biosynthesis and immunity. We recently used a systems biology approach to identify 25HC as an innate immune mediator that had a predicted role in atherosclerosis and we demonstrated a role for 25HC in foam cell formation. Here, we show that this mediator also has several complex roles in the antiviral response. The host response to viruses involves gene regulatory circuits with multiple feedback loops and we show here that 25HC acts as an amplifier of inflammatory signaling in macrophages. We determined that 25HC amplifies inflammatory signaling, at least in part, by mediating the recruitment of the AP-1 components FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene (FOS) and jun proto-oncogene (JUN) to the promoters of a subset of Toll-like receptor-responsive genes. Consistent with previous reports, we found that 25HC inhibits in vitro infection of airway epithelial cells by influenza. Surprisingly, we found that deletion of Ch25h, the gene encoding the enzyme responsible for 25HC production, is protective in a mouse model of influenza infection as a result of decreased inflammatory-induced pathology. Thus, our study demonstrates, for the first time to our knowledge, that in addition to its direct antiviral role, 25HC also regulates transcriptional responses and acts as an amplifier of inflammation via AP-1 and that the resulting alteration in inflammatory response leads to increased tissue damage in mice following infection with influenza. 
Abnormal lipid metabolism may contribute to the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) protein mediates the transport of cholesterol and phospholipids from cells to apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) to generate nascent HDL particles. Previous studies revealed that overexpression of ABCA1 or apoA-I alleviated hepatic lipid levels by modifying lipid transport. Here, we examined the effect of apoA-I and ABCA1 overexpression on genes involved in fatty acid synthesis in QSG-7701 hepatocytes and in mice. Human apoA-I and ABCA1 were overexpressed by transfection in QSG-7701 hepatocytes. Human apoA-I was also overexpressed via an adenoviral vector in C57BL/6J mice fed a methionine choline-deficient diet. Overexpression of either apoA-I or ABCA1 resulted in an increase in cholesterol efflux and a decrease in cellular cholesterol, fatty acids, and triglycerides. Overexpression of these genes also resulted in a reduction in 27-hydroxycholesterol levels and a decrease in the mRNA levels of fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1. Overexpression of apoA-I in mice reduced hepatic lipid levels, 27-hydroxycholesterol levels, and the mRNA levels of fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1. These results suggest that expression of apoA-I or ABCA1 can reduce steatosis by decreasing lipid storage and modifying lipid transport in hepatocytes and may also inhibit fatty acid synthesis by decreasing 27-hydroxycholesterol levels.
Oxysterols are involved in maintaining cellular cholesterol levels. Recently, oxysterols have been demonstrated to modulate the function of immune cells and tumor growth. These effects can be dependent on the activation of the oxysterol-binding liver X receptors (LXRs) or, as recently demonstrated for T and B cells, DCs and neutrophils, can be independent of LXR activation. LXR-dependent oxysterol effects can be ascribed to the activation of LXRα, LXRβ or LXRαβ isoforms, which induces transcriptional activation or trans-repression of target genes. The prevalent activation of one isoform seems to be cell-, tissue-, or context-specific, as shown in some pathologic processes, i.e., infectious diseases, atherosclerosis, and autoimmunity. Oxysterol-LXR signaling has recently been shown to inhibit antitumor immune responses, as well as to modulate tumor cell growth. Here, we review the mechanisms that link oxysterols to tumor growth, and discuss possible networks at the basis of LXR-dependent and -independent oxysterol effects on immune cells and tumor development. 
Cholesterosis is a disease of cholesterol metabolism characterized by the presence of excessive lipid droplets in the cytoplasm. These lipid droplets are mainly composed of cholesterol esters derived from free cholesterol. The removal of excess cholesterol from gallbladder epithelial cells (GBECs) is very important for the maintenance of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis and the preservation of gallbladder function. Several lines of evidence have indicated that the activation of either peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) or liver X receptor α (LXRα) relates to cholesterol efflux. While pioglitazone can regulate the activation of PPARγ, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol can activate LXRα and is a metabolic intermediate in the biosynthesis of steroid hormones. However, the effect of 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol in combination with pioglitazone on cholesterosis of the gallbladder is unclear. GBECs were treated with pioglitazone, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol or PPARγ siRNA followed by Western blot analysis for ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), PPARγ and LXRα. Cholesterol efflux to apoA-I was determined, and Oil Red O staining was performed to monitor variations in lipid levels in treated GBECs. Our data showed that 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol can modestly up-regulate LXRα while simultaneously increasing ABCA1 by 56%. The combination of 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and pioglitazone resulted in a 3.64-fold increase in ABCA1 expression and a high rate of cholesterol efflux. Oil Red O staining showed an obvious reduction in the lipid droplets associated with cholesterosis in GBECs. In conclusion, the present findings indicate that the anti-lipid deposition action of 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol combined with pioglitazone involves the activation of the PPARγ-LXRα-ABCA1 pathway, increased ABCA1 expression and the efflux of cholesterol from GBECs. Thus, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol synergistically combined with pioglitazone to produce a remarkable effect on lipid deposition in cholesterosis GBECs.
Cholesterol plays an indispensable role in regulating the properties of cell membranes in mammalian cells. Accumulation of cholesterol and its intermediates, such as oxysterols, lead to activation of the nuclear receptors LXRs (liver X receptors). LXR is an important regulator of cholesterol homoeostasis by controlling its transport and its neo-synthesis. Accumulating evidence indicates that the endogenous ligands of LXRs, oxysterols, play an active and important role in regulating the fate and function of immune cells. Indeed, LXRs are negative regu-lators of innate immunity by interfering with macrophage activation. Recent advances have highlighted a controversial role for LXR in cancer. In this issue of the Biochemical Journal, Wang et al. propose that LXR agonist directly controls IFN-γ (interferon-γ) expression, which limits tumour growth. This protective effect mediated by LXR appears to be dependent on IFN-γ. Thus, despite accumulation of endogenous ligand of LXR in cancer, activation of LXR seems protective. This novel evidence provides a new perspective for targeting LXR in cancer, although controversial studies can be also found in the literature. In order to avoid side effects associated with LXR agonists, molecular and cellular studies are required to decipher this unexpected action of LXRs. 
The liver X receptors (LXRs) are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily that regulate sterol metabolism and inflammation. We sought to identify previously unknown genes regulated by LXRs in macrophages and to determine their contribution to atherogenesis. Here we characterize a novel LXR target gene, the lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) gene. Surprisingly, the ability of LXRs to control LBP expression is cell-type specific, occurring in macrophages but not liver. Treatment of macrophages with oxysterols or loading with modified LDL induces LBP in an LXR-dependent manner, suggesting a potential role for LBP in the cellular response to cholesterol overload. To investigate this further, we performed bone marrow transplant studies. After 18 weeks of Western diet feeding, atherosclerotic lesion burden was assessed revealing markedly smaller lesions in the LBP(-/-) recipients. Furthermore, loss of bone marrow LBP expression increased apoptosis in atherosclerotic lesions as determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling staining. Supporting in vitro studies with isolated macrophages showed that LBP expression does not affect cholesterol efflux but promotes the survival of macrophages in the setting of cholesterol loading. The LBP gene is a macrophage-specific LXR target that promotes foam cell survival and atherogenesis.
24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24S-OHC) which is enzymatically produced in the brain plays important physiological roles in maintaining brain cholesterol homeostasis. We found that 24S-OHC at sub-lethal concentrations down-regulated amyloid precursor protein (APP) trafficking via enhancement of the complex formation of APP with up-regulated glucose-regulated protein 78, an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone. In accordance with this mechanism, 24S-OHC suppressed amyloid-β production in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, 24S-OHC at sub-lethal concentrations induced adaptive responses via transcriptional activation of the liver X receptor signaling pathway, thereby protecting neuronal cells against the forthcoming oxidative stress induced by 7-ketocholesterol. On the other hand, we found that high concentrations of 24S-OHC induced apoptosis in T-lymphoma Jurkat cells which endogenously expressed caspase-8, and induced necroptosis - a form of programmed necrosis - in neuronal SH-SY5Y cells which expressed no caspase-8. In this Article, we show the diverse functions of 24S-OHC and consider the possible importance of controlling 24S-OHC levels in the brain for preventing neurodegenerative diseases. 
The regulation of the ABCD2 gene is recognized as a possible therapeutic target for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, a rare neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene. Up-regulation of ABCD2 expression has indeed been demonstrated to compensate for ABCD1 deficiency, restoring peroxisomal β-oxidation of very-long-chain fatty acids. Besides the known inducers of the ABCD2 gene (phenylbutyrate and histone deacetylase inhibitors, fibrates, dehydroepiandrosterone, thyroid hormone and thyromimetics), this review will focus on LXR antagonists and 22S-hydroxycholesterol, recently described as inducers of ABCD2 expression. Several LXR antagonists have been identified and their possible indication for neurodegenerative disorders will be discussed. 
Lipid peroxidation products have been known to induce cellular adaptive responses and enhance tolerance against subsequent oxidative stress through up-regulation of antioxidant compounds and enzymes. 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24SOHC) which is endogenously produced oxysterol in the brain plays an important role in maintaining brain cholesterol homeostasis. In this study, we evaluated adaptive responses induced by brain-specific oxysterol 24SOHC in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Cells treated with 24SOHC at sub-lethal concentrations showed significant reduction in cell death induced by subsequent treatment with 7-ketocholesterol (7KC) in both undifferentiated and retinoic acid-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. These adaptive responses were also induced by other oxysterols such as 25-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol which are known to be ligands of liver X receptor (LXR). Co-treatment of 24SOHC with 9-cis retinoic acid, a retinoid X receptor ligand, enhanced the adaptive responses. Knockdown of LXRβ by siRNA diminished the adaptive responses induced by 24SOHC almost completely. The treatment with 24SOHC induced the expression of LXR target genes, such as ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and G1 (ABCG1). The 24SOHC-induced adaptive responses were significantly attenuated by siRNA for ABCG1 but not by siRNA for ABCA1. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that 24SOHC at sub-lethal concentrations induces adaptive responses via transcriptional activation of LXR signaling pathway, thereby protecting neuronal cells from subsequent 7KC-induced cytotoxicity. 
Intracellular lipid accumulation, inflammatory responses, and subsequent apoptosis are the major pathogenic events of metabolic disorders, including atherosclerosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases. Recently, a novel regulatory oxysterol, 5-cholesten-3b, 25-diol 3-sulfate (25HC3S), has been identified, and hydroxysterol sulfotransferase 2B1b (SULT2B1b) has been elucidated as the key enzyme for its biosynthesis from 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) via oxysterol sulfation. The product 25HC3S and the substrate 25HC have been shown to coordinately regulate lipid metabolism, inflammatory responses, and cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. 25HC3S decreases levels of the nuclear liver oxysterol receptor (LXR) and sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), inhibits SREBP processing, subsequently downregulates key enzymes in lipid biosynthesis, decreases intracellular lipid levels in hepatocytes and THP-1-derived macrophages, prevents apoptosis, and promotes cell proliferation in liver tissues. Furthermore, 25HC3S increases nuclear PPARγ and cytosolic IκBα and decreases nuclear NF-κB levels and proinflammatory cytokine expression and secretion when cells are challenged with LPS and TNFα. In contrast to 25HC3S, 25HC, a known LXR ligand, increases nuclear LXR and decreases nuclear PPARs and cytosol IκBα levels. In this review, we summarize our recent findings, including the discovery of the regulatory oxysterol sulfate, its biosynthetic pathway, and its functional mechanism. We also propose that oxysterol sulfation functions as a regulatory signaling pathway. 
The two Liver X Receptors, LXRα and LXRβ, are nuclear receptors belonging to the superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors. They share more than 78% homology in amino acid sequence, a common profile of oxysterol ligands and the same heterodimerization partner, Retinoid X Receptor. LXRs play crucial roles in several metabolic pathways: lipid metabolism, in particular in preventing cellular cholesterol accumulation; glucose homeostasis; inflammation; central nervous system functions and water transport. As with all nuclear receptors, the transcriptional activity of LXR is the result of an orchestration of numerous cellular factors including ligand bioavailability, presence of corepressors and coactivators and cellular context i.e., what other pathways are activated in the cell at the time the receptor recognizes its ligand. In this mini-review we summarize the factors regulating the transcriptional activity and the mechanisms of action of these two receptors. 
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are ligand-activated members of the nuclear receptor superfamily that regulate the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism and inflammation, although their role in inflammation and immunity is less well known. It has been reported that oxysterols/LXRs may act as anti-inflammatory molecules, although opposite actions have also been reported. In this study, we investigated the effect of platelet-activating factor (PAF), a proinflammatory molecule, on LXRα signalling in human neutrophils. We found that PAF exerted an inhibitory effect on mRNA expression of TO901317-induced LXRα, ATP-binding cassette transporter A1, ATP-binding cassette transporter G1, and sterol response element binding protein 1c. This negative action was mediated by the PAF receptor, and was dependent on the release of reactive oxygen species elicited by PAF, as it was enhanced by pro-oxidant treatment and reversed by antioxidants. Current data also support the idea that PAF induces phosphorylation of the LXRα molecule in an extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2-mediated fashion. These results suggest that a possible mechanism by which PAF exerts its proinflammatory effect is through the downregulation of LXRα and its related genes, which supports the notion that LXRα ligands exert a modulatory role in the neutrophil-mediated inflammatory response.
Several studies have suggested an etiological role for hypercholesterolemia in the pathogenesis of breast cancer and prostate cancer (PCa). However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie and mediate the hypercholesterolemia-fostered increased risk for breast cancer and PCa are yet to be determined. The discovery that the most abundant cholesterol oxidized metabolite in the plasma, 27 hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC), is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) and an agonist of Liver X receptors (LXR) partially fills the void in our understanding and knowledge of the mechanisms that may link hypercholesterolemia to development and progression of breast cancer and PCa. The wide spectrum and repertoire of SERM and LXR-dependent effects of 27-OHC in the context of all facets and aspects of breast cancer and prostate cancer biology are reviewed in this manuscript in a very comprehensive manner. This review highlights recent findings pertaining to the role of 27-OHC in breast cancer and PCa and delineates the signaling mechanisms involved in the governing of different facets of tumor biology, that include tumor cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as well as tumor cell invasion, migration, and metastasis. We also discuss the limitations of contemporary studies and lack of our comprehension of the entire gamut of effects exerted by 27-OHC that may be relevant to the pathogenesis of breast cancer and PCa. We unveil and propose potential future directions of research that may further our understanding of the role of 27-OHC in breast cancer and PCa and help design therapeutic interventions against endocrine therapy-resistant breast cancer and PCa.
Investigating differentially expressed proteins in a milieu rich in cholesterol oxidation products, we found via mass spectrometry-based proteomics that surface levels of heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) were upregulated on monocytic cells in the presence of 27-hydroxycholesterol (27OHChol). The elevated levels of cytoplasmic membrane HSP60 were verified via Western blot analysis and visualized by confocal microscopy. Treatment with 27OHChol also resulted in increased levels of cellular HSP60 without altering its transcription. Cholesterol, however, did not affect cell-surface levels and cellular amount of HSP60. GSK 2033, an LXR antagonist, inhibited expression of live X receptor α, but not of HSP60, induced by 27OHChol. Treatment with 27OHChol also resulted in increased release of HSP60 from monocytic cells, but the release was significantly reduced by inhibitors of endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi protein trafficking, brefeldin A and monensin. Results of the current study indicate that 27OHChol upregulates not only cell-surface and cellular levels of HSP60 but also its release from monocytic cells, thereby contributing to activation of the immune system.
Oxysterols are oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol formed in the human body or ingested in the diet. By modulating the activity of many proteins [e.g., liver X receptors (LXRs), oxysterol-binding proteins (OSBPs), some ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters], oxysterols can affect many cellular functions and influence various physiological processes (e.g., cholesterol metabolism, membrane fluidity regulation, intracellular signaling pathways). Therefore, the role of oxysterols is also important in pathological conditions (e.g., atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus type 2, neurodegenerative disorders). Finally, current evidence suggests that oxysterols play a role in malignancies such as breast, prostate, colon, and bile duct cancer. This review summarizes the physiological importance of oxysterols in the human body with a special emphasis on their roles in various tumors.
Impaired cholesterol/lipoprotein metabolism is linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cerebral cholesterol homeostasis is maintained by the highly efficient blood-brain barrier (BBB) and flux of the oxysterols 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol, potent liver-X-receptor (LXR) activators. HDL and their apolipoproteins are crucial for cerebral lipid transfer, and loss of ATP binding cassette transporters (ABC)G1 and G4 results in toxic accumulation of oxysterols in the brain. The HDL-associated apolipoprotein (apo)M is positively correlated with pre-β HDL formation in plasma; its presence and function in the brain was thus far unknown. Using an in vitro model of the BBB, we examined expression, regulation, and functions of ABCG1, ABCG4, and apoM in primary porcine brain capillary endothelial cells (pBCEC). RT Q-PCR analyses and immunoblotting revealed that in addition to ABCA1 and scavenger receptor, class B, type I (SR-BI), pBCEC express high levels of ABCG1, which was up-regulated by LXR activation. Immunofluorescent staining, site-specific biotinylation and immunoprecipitation revealed that ABCG1 is localized both to early and late endosomes and on apical and basolateral plasma membranes. Using siRNA interference to silence ABCG1 (by 50%) reduced HDL-mediated [3H]-cholesterol efflux (by 50%) but did not reduce [3H]-24(S)-hydroxycholesterol efflux. In addition to apoA-I, pBCEC express and secrete apoM mainly to the basolateral (brain) compartment. HDL enhanced expression and secretion of apoM by pBCEC, apoM-enriched HDL promoted cellular cholesterol efflux more efficiently than apoM-free HDL, while apoM-silencing diminished cellular cholesterol release. We suggest that ABCG1 and apoM are centrally involved in regulation of cholesterol metabolism/turnover at the BBB.
A new methodology to obtain C-25 and C-26 steroidal acids starting from pregnenolone is described. Construction of the side chain was achieved by applying the Mukaiyama aldol reaction with a non-hydrolytic work-up to isolate the trapped silyl enol ether with higher yields. Using this methodology we synthesized three new steroidal acids as potential ligands of DAF-12, Liver X and Glucocorticoid nuclear receptors and studied their activity in reporter gene assays. Our results show that replacement of the 21-CH3 by a 20-keto group in the side chains of the cholestane scaffold of DAF-12 or Liver X receptors ligands causes the loss of the activity.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily that have been shown to regulate various physiological functions such as lipid metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis. Concordant reports have elicited the possibility to target them to cure many human diseases including arteriosclerosis, cancer, arthritis, and diabetes. The high relevance of modulating LXR activities to treat numerous skin diseases, mainly those with exacerbated inflammation processes, contrasts with the lack of approved therapeutic use. This review makes an assessment to sum up the findings regarding the physiological roles of LXRs in skin and help progress towards the therapeutic and safe management of their activities. It focuses on the possible pharmacological targeting of LXRs to cure or prevent selected skin diseases.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one of the most severe motor neuron (MN) disorders in adults. Phenotype of ALS patients is highly variable and may be influenced by modulators of energy metabolism. Recent works have implicated the liver X receptors α and β (LXRs), either in the propagation process of ALS or in the maintenance of MN survival. LXRs are nuclear receptors activated by oxysterols, modulating cholesterol levels, a suspected modulator of ALS severity. In a cohort of 438 ALS patients and 330 healthy controls, the influence of LXR genes on ALS risk and phenotype was studied using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The two LXRα SNPs rs2279238 and rs7120118 were shown to be associated with age at onset in ALS patients. Consistently, homozygotes were twice more correlated than were heterozygotes to delayed onset. The onset was thus delayed by 3.9 years for rs2279238 C/T carriers and 7.8 years for T/T carriers. Similar results were obtained for rs7120118 (+2.1 years and +6.7 years for T/C and C/C genotypes, respectively). The LXRβ SNP rs2695121 was also shown to be associated with a 30% increase of ALS duration (p = 0.0055, FDR = 0.044). The tested genotypes were not associated with ALS risk. These findings add further evidence to the suspected implication of LXR genes in the disease process of ALS and might open new perspectives in ALS therapeutics.
Bile acids are extensively investigated for their potential in the treatment of human disorders. The liver X receptors (LXRs), activated by oxysterols and by a secondary bile acid named hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA), have been found essential in the regulation of lipid homeostasis in mammals. Unfortunately, LXRα activates lipogenic enzymes causing accumulation of lipid in the liver. In addition to LXRs, HDCA has been also shown to function as ligand for GPBAR1, a G protein coupled receptor for secondary bile acids whose activation represents a promising approach to liver steatosis. In the present study, we report a library of HDCA derivatives endowed with modulatory activity on the two receptors. The lead optimization of HDCA moiety was rationally driven by the structural information on the binding site of the two targets and results from pharmacological characterization allowed the identification of hyodeoxycholane derivatives with selective agonistic activity toward LXRα and GPBAR1 and notably to the identification of the first example of potent dual LXRα/GPBAR1 agonists. The new chemical entities might hold utility in the treatment of dyslipidemic disorders.
Hypercholesterolemia is associated with cognitively deteriorated states. Here, we show that excess 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OH), a cholesterol metabolite passing from the circulation into the brain, reduced in vivo brain glucose uptake, GLUT4 expression, and spatial memory. Furthermore, patients exhibiting higher 27-OH levels had reduced 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake. This interplay between 27-OH and glucose uptake revealed the engagement of the insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP). 27-OH increased the levels and activity of IRAP, countered the IRAP antagonist angiotensin IV (AngIV)-mediated glucose uptake, and enhanced the levels of the AngIV-degrading enzyme aminopeptidase N (AP-N). These effects were mediated by liver X receptors. Our results reveal a molecular link between cholesterol, brain glucose, and the brain renin-angiotensin system, all of which are affected in some neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, reducing 27-OH levels or inhibiting AP-N maybe a useful strategy in the prevention of the altered glucose metabolism and memory decline in these disorders.
25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) is enzymatically produced by cholesterol 25-hydorxylase in various organs and is involved in many processes, including lipid metabolism, inflammation and the immune response. However, the role of 25-HC in the migration and invasion of lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) cells remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that 0.1 μM 25-HC promoted ADC cell migration and invasion without affecting cell proliferation, especially after coculture with THP1-derived macrophages. Further investigation showed that 0.1 μM 25-HC significantly stimulated interleukin-1β (IL-1β) secretion in a coculture system and increased the expression of LXR and Snail. IL-1β also mimicked the effect of 25-HC. LXR knockdown notably blocked the 25-HC-induced Snail expression, migration and invasion in both the monoculture system and the coculture system, but it did not impact the effect of IL-1β, which suggested that IL-1β functioned in an LXR-independent manner. These results suggested that 25-HC promoted ADC cell migration and invasion in an LXR-dependent manner in the monoculture system but that in the coculture system, the 25-HC-induced IL-1β secretion enhanced the effect of 25-HC in an LXR-independent manner.
The oxysterol 27-Hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) is a major cholesterol metabolite that can cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) from peripheral circulation to the brain. Currently, the role of 27-OHC on cholesterol homeostasis in astrocytes and the underlying mechanisms are not defined. Since all brain cholesterol is essentially synthesized in brain itself and astrocytes as net producers of cholesterol are essential for normal brain function, here we investigated the effects of 27-OHC on cholesterol synthesis and transport in C6 glioma cells. C6 cells were treated with 5, 10 and 20μM 27-OHC for 24h and the cell viability and apoptosis, the cholesterol levels and metabolism-related mediators, genes and proteins were subsequently assessed using cell-counting kit (CCK)-8, Amplex red, ELISA, real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively. We found that 27-OHC decreased cholesterol levels by down-regulating the expression of sterol-regulated element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1a), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CR) and low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and promoted cholesterol transport by up-regulating the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors-γ (PPAR-γ), liver X receptor-α (LXR-α), ATP-binding cassette transporter protein family member A1 (ABCA1) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE)genes. Our results suggested that 27-OHC may represent a sensitive modulator of cholesterol metabolism disorder by suppressing cholesterol synthesis and stimulating cholesterol transport in astrocytes.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) have been increasingly recognized as a potential therapeutic target to treat pathological conditions ranging from vascular and metabolic diseases, neurological degeneration, to cancers that are driven by lipid metabolism. Amidst intensifying efforts to discover ligands that act through LXRs to achieve the sought-after pharmacological outcomes, several lead compounds are already being tested in clinical trials for a variety of disease interventions. While more potent and selective LXR ligands continue to emerge from screening of small molecule libraries, rational design, and empirical medicinal chemistry approaches, challenges remain in minimizing undesirable effects of LXR activation on lipid metabolism. This review provides a summary of known endogenous, naturally occurring, and synthetic ligands. The review also offers considerations from a molecular modeling perspective with which to design more specific LXRβ ligands based on the interaction energies of ligands and the important amino acid residues in the LXRβ ligand binding domain.
Nuclear receptors (NRs) regulate numerous aspects of the endocrine system. They mediate endogenous and exogenous cues, ensuring a homeostatic control of development and metabolism. Gene duplication, loss and mutation have shaped the repertoire and function of NRs in metazoans. Here, we examine the evolution of a pivotal orchestrator of cholesterol metabolism in vertebrates, the liver X receptors (LXRs). Previous studies suggested that LXRα and LXRβ genes emerged in the mammalian ancestor. However, we show through genome analysis and functional assay that bona fide LXRα and LXRβ orthologues are present in reptiles, coelacanth and chondrichthyans but not in cyclostomes. These findings show that LXR duplicated before gnathostome radiation, followed by asymmetric paralogue loss in some lineages. We suggest that a tighter control of cholesterol levels in vertebrates was achieved through the exploitation of a wider range of oxysterols, an ability contingent on ligand-binding pocket remodeling.
Liver X receptor (LXR)α is a nuclear receptor that responds to oxysterols and cholesterol overload by stimulating cholesterol efflux, transport, conversion to bile acids, and excretion. LXRα binds to and is regulated by synthetic (T-0901317, GW3695) and endogenous (oxysterols) ligands. LXRα activity is also modulated by FAs, but the ligand binding specificity of FA and acyl-CoA derivatives for LXRα remains unknown. We investigated whether LXRα binds FA or FA acyl-CoA with affinities that mimic in vivo concentrations, examined the effect of FA chain length and the degree of unsaturation on binding, and investigated whether FAs regulate LXRα activation. Saturated medium-chain FA (MCFA) displayed binding affinities in the low nanomolar concentration range, while long-chain fatty acyl-CoA did not bind or bound weakly to LXRα. Circular dichroic spectra and computational docking experiments confirmed that MCFA bound to the LXRα ligand binding pocket similar to the known synthetic agonist of LXRα (T0901317), but with limited change to the conformation of the receptor. Transactivation assays showed that MCFA activated LXRα, whereas long-chain FA caused no effect. Our results suggest that LXRα functions as a receptor for saturated FA or acyl-CoA of C10 and C12 in length.
The endogenous oxysterol 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (22RHC, 1) is an LXR agonist which upregulates genes of critical involvement in human cholesterol- and lipid metabolism. In contrast, its synthetic epimer 22(S)-hydroxycholesterol (22SHC, 8) has shown specific antagonistic effects in recent studies, avoiding unwanted side effects provided by potent LXR agonists. In terms of LXR modulation, the aim of this study was to compare 22SHC (8), 22RHC (1) and synthesized ligands with keto- and amide functionality in the 22nd position of the cholesterol scaffold. 22SHC (8) and 22RHC (1) performed as expected while 22-ketocholesterol (22KC, 10) revealed an attractive in vitro profile for further investigation in terms of anti-atherosclerotic properties as selective upregulation of the ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCA1 was observed. A new synthesized amide derivate, Fernholtz cyclohexylamide (13) was shown to reduce lipogenesis in a dose-responsive manner and abolish the effect of the potent LXR agonist T0901317 when administered simultaneously.
When inhaled, ozone (O3) interacts with cholesterols of airway epithelial cell membranes or the lung-lining fluid, generating chemically reactive oxysterols. The mechanism by which O3-derived oxysterols affect molecular function is unknown. Our data show that in vitro exposure of human bronchial epithelial cells to O3 results in the formation of oxysterols, epoxycholesterol-α and -β and secosterol A and B (Seco A and Seco B), in cell lysates and apical washes. Similarly, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from human volunteers exposed to O3 contained elevated levels of these oxysterol species. As expected, O3-derived oxysterols have a pro-inflammatory effect and increase NF-κB activity. Interestingly, expression of the cholesterol efflux pump ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1), which is regulated by activation of the liver X receptor (LXR), was suppressed in epithelial cells exposed to O3 Additionally, exposure of LXR knock-out mice to O3 enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine production in the lung, suggesting LXR inhibits O3-induced inflammation. Using alkynyl surrogates of O3-derived oxysterols, our data demonstrate adduction of LXR with Seco A. Similarly, supplementation of epithelial cells with alkynyl-tagged cholesterol followed by O3 exposure causes observable lipid-LXR adduct formation. Experiments using Seco A and the LXR agonist T0901317 (T09) showed reduced expression of ABCA1 as compared with stimulation with T0901317 alone, indicating that Seco A-LXR protein adduct formation inhibits LXR activation by traditional agonists. Overall, these data demonstrate that O3-derived oxysterols have pro-inflammatory functions and form lipid-protein adducts with LXR, thus leading to suppressed cholesterol regulatory gene expression and providing a biochemical mechanism mediating O3-derived formation of oxidized lipids in the airways and subsequent adverse health effects.
Small-molecule inhibitors targeting growth factor receptors have failed to show efficacy for brain cancers, potentially due to their inability to achieve sufficient drug levels in the CNS. Targeting non-oncogene tumor co-dependencies provides an alternative approach, particularly if drugs with high brain penetration can be identified. Here we demonstrate that the highly lethal brain cancer glioblastoma (GBM) is remarkably dependent on cholesterol for survival, rendering these tumors sensitive to Liver X receptor (LXR) agonist-dependent cell death. We show that LXR-623, a clinically viable, highly brain-penetrant LXRα-partial/LXRβ-full agonist selectively kills GBM cells in an LXRβ- and cholesterol-dependent fashion, causing tumor regression and prolonged survival in mouse models. Thus, a metabolic co-dependency provides a pharmacological means to kill growth factor-activated cancers in the CNS.
The widespread involvement of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway in human malignancies has driven efforts to develop Hh pathway inhibitors as anti-cancer agents. The majority of these agents antagonize Smoothened (Smo), a plasma membrane-associated signal transducer molecule. However, several such Smo antagonists have failed in clinical trials to benefit patients with cancers that arise from aberrant Hh signaling (which often bypasses Smo). In this study, we report that a naturally occurring oxysterol, 20α, 22(R)-dihydroxycholesterol (Oxy16), a known metabolite in the biosynthesis of steroid hormones, strongly inhibits Hh signaling induced in C3H10T1/2 embryonic fibroblasts and NIH3T3-E1 fibroblasts through a mechanism that is independent of liver X receptor (LXR) activation. We demonstrate that Oxy16 inhibits Hh signaling in Suppressor of Fused (Sufu) null mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells, indicating that its inhibitory effect on Hh signaling is epistatic to Sufu. We further demonstrate that Oxy16 inhibits Gli1 transcriptional activity in NIH3T3-E1 cells overexpressing Gli1 and a Gli-dependent reporter construct. Altogether, data presented here suggest that Oxy16 may be a suitable starting point for the development of new drugs that inhibit Hh signaling downstream of Smo. By targeting aberrant Hh signaling, such novel Hh pathway inhibitors could significantly broaden the range of clinical applications compared to existing Smo antagonists. Furthermore, the present study adds a new facet to the spectrum of Hh pathway modulation that naturally occurring oxysterol derivatives are capable of, ranging from allosteric activation of the pathway via Smo binding to inhibition of the pathway downstream of Smo.

Liver X receptors (LXRs) are nuclear receptors that play central roles in the transcriptional control of lipid metabolism. The ability of LXRs to integrate metabolic and inflammation signalling makes them attractive targets for intervention in human metabolic diseases. Several oxidized metabolites of cholesterol (oxysterols) are endogenous LXR ligands, that modulate their transcriptional responses. While 25R-cholestenoic acid is an agonist of the LXRs, the synthetic analogue 27-norcholestenoic acid that lacks the 25-methyl is an inverse agonist. This change in the activity profile is triggered by a disruption of a key interaction between residues His435 and Trp457 that destabilizes the H11-H12 region of the receptor and favors the binding of corepressors. The introduction of fluorine atoms on the oxysterol side chain can favor both hydrophobic interactions as well as hydrogen bonds with the fluorine atoms and may thus induce changes in the receptor that may lead to changes in the activity profile. To evaluate these effects we have synthesized two fluorinated 27-nor-steroids, analogues of 27-norcholestenoic acid, the 25,25-difluoroacid and the corresponding 26-alcohol. The key step was a Reformatsky reaction on the C-24 cholenaldehyde, with ethyl bromodifluoroacetate under high intensity ultrasound (HIU) irradiation, followed by a Barton-McCombie type deoxygenation. Activity was evaluated in a luciferase reporter assay in the human HEK293T cells co-transfected with full length human LXRβ expression vector. The 25,25-difluoro-27-norcholestenoic acid was an inverse agonist and antagonist similar to its non-fluorinated analogue while its reduced derivative 25,25-difluoro-27-norcholest-5-ene-3β,26-diol was an agonist. Molecular dynamics simulation of the ligand-receptor complexes showed that the difluoroacid disrupted the His435-Trp457 interaction although the resulting conformational changes were different from those induced by the non-fluorinated analogue. In the case of the difluoroalcohol, the fluorine atoms actively participated in the interaction with several residues in the ligand binding pocket leading to a stabilization of the active receptor conformation.
In the search of new therapeutical strategies against non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the identification of new prognostic factors is crucial.
In this study, we analyzed the prognostic value of the liver X receptor-alpha (LXR-alpha), a nuclear receptor of a family of cholesterol derivatives called oxysterols, in patients with radically resected NSCLC.
We retrospectively reviewed 140 stage II and III surgically treated NSCLC patients that were grouped by percentage of LXR-alpha-positive cells value above or below its median value. Tumor-related survival was evaluated as primary end point.
The 5-year overall and tumor-related survival rates were 40% and 46%, respectively. The median percentage of LXR-alpha-positive cells was 20%. Patients with stage II NSCLC had higher LXR-alpha values than those with stage III (P = .04). Univariate analysis demonstrated that both TNM stage and LXR-alpha were significantly related to tumor-related survival (P = .006 and P = .004, respectively). The 5-year tumor-related survival rates in stage II and III NSCLC were 56% and 34%, respectively. The 5-year tumor-related survival rates in high and low LXR-alpha value were 57% and 32%, respectively. The multivariate analysis showed that both TNM stage and LXR-alpha were independent prognostic factors (P = .01 and P = .007, respectively) with hazard ratio of 1.92 and 0.49, respectively.
LXR-alpha seems to be an independent prognostic factor indicating a better survival in completely resected stage II and III NSCLC patients.
The anthracycline-mediated cardiotoxicity is still not completely understood. To examine the impact of cholesterol metabolism and transport in this context, cholesterol and oxysterol levels as well as the expression of the cholesterol transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1 were analyzed in doxorubicin-treated HL-1 murine cardiomyocytes as well as in mouse model for acute doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Doxorubicin-treated HL-1 cells exhibited enhanced cholesterol (153±20% of control), oxysterol (24S-hydroxycholesterol: 206±29% of control) and cholesterol precursor levels (lathosterol: 122±12% of control; desmosterol: 188±10% of control) indicating enhanced cholesterol synthesis. Moreover, abca1 and abcg1 were upregulated on mRNA, protein and functional level caused by a doxorubicin-mediated activation of the nuclear receptor LXR. In addition, the oxysterols not only induced the abca1 and abcg1 in HL-1 cells but also enhanced the expression of endothelin-1 and transforming growth factor-β, which have already been identified as important factors in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. These in vitro findings were verified in a murine model for acute doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, demonstrating elevated cardiac (2.1±0.2vs. 3.6±1.0ng/mg) and systemic cholesterol levels (105.0±8.4vs. 130.0±4.3mg/dl), respectively, as well as enhanced oxysterol levels such as cardiac 24S-hydroxycholesterol (2.1±0.2vs. 3.6±1.0ng/mg). In line with these findings cardiac mRNA expression of abca1 (303% of control) and abcg1 (161% of control) was induced. Taken together, our data demonstrate enhanced cholesterol and oxysterol levels by doxorubicin, resulting in a LXR-dependent upregulation of abca1 and abcg1. In this context, the cytotoxic effects of oxysterols and their impact on cardiac gene expression should be considered as an important factor in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.
Liver X receptor (LXR) is transcriptional factor that plays an important role in the regulation of energy metabolism such as cholesterol, lipid, and glucose metabolism as well as membrane transporters and channels. Using both in vitro and in vivo models, LXR regulation of the expression and function of renal organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) was observed. Synthetic LXR agonist (GW3965) and endogenous LXR agonist (22R-hydroxycholesterol) significantly reduced the uptake of 3H-MPP+, a prototypic substrate of OCT2, in both OCT2- Chinese hamster ovary K1 and human renal proximal tubular cells (RPTEC/TERT1). GW3965 decreased transport activity of OCT2 via a reduction of the maximal transport rate of MPP+ without affecting transporter affinity. The inhibitory effect of GW3965 was attenuated by co-treatment with LXR antagonist (fenofibrate) indicating the inhibition was LXR-dependent mechanism. In addition, co-treatment with a retinoic X receptor (RXR) ligand, 9-cis retinoic acid enhanced the inhibitory effect of GW3965, indicating negative regulation of OCT2 transport activity by the LXR/RXR complex. Treatment RPTEC/TERT1 cells with GW3965 significantly reduced OCT2 protein expression without changing mRNA expression. In parallel, the effect of LXR activation on OCT2 function was investigated in intact mouse kidney. Treating mice with 50 mg/kg BW T0901317 for 14 days significantly decreased 3H-MPP+ uptake into renal cortical slices, correlating with decreased OCT2 protein expression in renal cortex without changes in mRNA expression levels. Taken together, LXR/RXR activation downregulates the protein expression and function of OCT2 in renal proximal tubule, suggesting LXR might affect the total profile of renal excretion of cationic compounds.
The nuclear receptors liver X receptor (LXR) α and LXRβ are involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism, inflammation, immunity, cellular proliferation, and apoptosis. Oxysterols are endogenous LXR ligands, and also interact with other nuclear and membrane receptors. We previously reported that a phytosterol derivative with a 1α-hydroxy group acts as a potent LXR agonist with intestine-selective action and that 25-hydroxy and 26/27-hydroxy metabolites of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) exhibit partial LXR agonism. In this study, we report that 1α-hydroxy derivatives of 7-DHC, 1α-OH-7-DHC and 1,25-(OH)2-7-DHC, act as LXR modulators. Luciferase reporter gene assays showed that 1α-OH-7-DHC activates LXRα and LXRβ and that 1,25-(OH)2-7-DHC activates both LXRs and vitamin D receptor. Examination of cofactor peptide association showed that the 1α-hydroxy derivatives, specifically 1,25-(OH)2-7-DHC, induce association of coactivator/corepressor peptide in a different manner from the agonist T0901317. Docking modeling and alanine mutational analysis of LXRα demonstrated that 1,25-(OH)2-7-DHC interacts with LXRα residues in a manner distinct from potent agonists, such as T0901317 and 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol. 1α-OH-7-DHC and 1,25-(OH)2-7-DHC induced expression of LXR target genes in a cell type- and gene-selective manner. 1,25-(OH)2-7-DHC effectively suppressed lipopolysaccharide-stimulated proinflammatory gene expression in an LXR-dependent manner. Therefore, 1α-hydroxy derivatives, such as 1,25-(OH)2-7-DHC, are unique LXR modulators with selective agonistic activity and potent transrepression function. These oxysterols have potential as LXR-targeted therapeutics for inflammatory disease.
Because macrophages respond to a variety of pathological and pharmacological reagents, understanding the role of P450s in macrophages is important for therapeutic intervention. There has been a lack of research on CYP4 in macrophages, but fatty acid accumulation and lipid trafficking in macrophages have been suggested to be a main cause of atherosclerosis. All human CYP4 genes (n=12) were screened in THP1 macrophages by gene-specific reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Only CYP4V2 exhibited strong expression of both mRNA and protein. Expression levels of both CYP4V2 mRNA and protein were significantly reduced after treatment with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) antagonist GW9662. However, the expression levels of CYP4V2 were not changed by PPARα antagonist (GW6471) and liver X receptor alpha antagonist (22-S hydroxycholesterol). A metabolite of the CYP4V2 enzyme, 12-hydroxydodecanoic acid, was detected in THP1 macrophages, and this metabolite was significantly decreased after treatment with the PPARγ inhibitor GW9662 (&gt;80% decreased, p&lt;0.05). In summary, fatty acid metabolizing protein CYP4V2 was identified in human THP1 macrophages, and its expression was regulated by PPARγ. Further study is required to understand the role of CYP4V2 with regard to fat accumulation in the activated macrophage and atherosclerotic plaque development.
Concentration of maternal BICOID (BCD) establishes the anterior pattern in the Drosophila embryo. Successive deletions in the bcd promoter allowed us to localize an enhancer sequence in the 5'-UTR and a down-regulating element downstream of the ATG initiator codon, and identify a 49 bp region sufficient to drive transcription of a reporter gene specifically in nurse cells. This fragment contains two binding sites for the Serendipity (Sry) d zinc finger activator, that mediate its cooperative binding. Both sites (sdbs) are essential for bcd expression. Further analysis showed that the bcd promoter configuration is decisive for Sry d activating function. Replacement of sdbs by binding sites for Sry b, the Sry d paralog, restores bcd transcription in sry d mutant ovaries, demonstrating that the functional divergence between these two proteins during evolution was mainly driven by changes in their DNA-specific recognition properties, resulting in the control of separate developmental pathways.
SOX genes are a family of genes that encode for proteins which are characterised by the presence of a HMG-domain related to that of the mammalian sex-determining gene (SRY). By definition, the DNA binding domain of SOX genes is at least 50% identical to the 79 amino acid HMG domain of the SRY gene. We report here two HMG-box sequences from two microbat species (R. ferrumequinum and P. Pipistrellus) which were PCR amplified using a primer pair specific to the mouse Sry HMG-box. The high percentage of identity of this sequences with the human and mouse SOX30 HMG-box suggests that they are the SOX30 HMG-box for these two bat species.
Long-term parenteral nutrition (PN) administration can lead to PN-associated liver diseases (PNALD). Although multiple risk factors have been identified for PNALD, to date, the roles of bile acids (BAs) and the pathways involved in BA homeostasis in the development and progression of PNALD are still unclear. We have established a mouse PN model with IV infusion of PN solution containing soybean oil-based lipid emulsion (SOLE). Our results showed that PN altered the expression of genes involved in a variety of liver functions at the mRNA levels. PN increased liver gene expression of Cyp7a1 and markedly decreased that of Cyp8b1, Cyp7b1, Bsep, and Shp. CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 are important for synthesizing the total amount of BAs and regulating the hydrophobicity of BAs, respectively. Consistently, both the levels and the percentages of primary BAs as well as total non-12α-OH BAs increased significantly in the serum of PN mice compared with saline controls, whereas liver BA profiles were largely similar. The expression of several key liver-X receptor-α (LXRα) target genes involved in lipid synthesis was also increased in PN mouse livers. Retinoid acid-related orphan receptor-α (RORα) has been shown to induce the expression of Cyp8b1 and Cyp7b1, as well as to suppress LXRα function. Western blot showed significantly reduced nuclear migration of RORα protein in PN mouse livers. This study shows that continuous PN infusion with SOLE in mice leads to dysregulation of BA homeostasis. Alterations of liver RORα signaling in PN mice may be one of the mechanisms implicated in the pathogenesis of PNALD. 
The liver X receptors (LXRs), LXRα and LXRβ, are transcription factors with well-established roles in the regulation of lipid metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis. In addition, LXRs influence innate and adaptive immunity, including responses to inflammatory stimuli, proliferation and differentiation, migration, apoptosis and survival. However, the majority of work describing the role of LXRs in immune cells has been carried out in mouse models, and there are a number of known species-specific differences concerning LXR function. Here we review what is known about the role of LXRs in human immune cells, demonstrating the importance of these receptors in the integration of lipid metabolism and immune function, but also highlighting the need for a better understanding of the species, isoform, and cell-type specific effects of LXR activation. 
Adequate intake of dietary fibers has proven metabolic and cardiovascular benefits, molecular mechanisms remain still limited. This study was aimed to investigate the effects of cereal dietary fiber on obesity-related liver lipotoxicity in C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat/cholesterol (HFC) diet and underlying mechanism. Forty-eight adult male C57BL/6J mice were randomly given a reference chow diet, or a high fat/cholesterol (HFC) diet supplemented with or without oat fiber or wheat bran fiber for 24 weeks. Our results showed mice fed oat or wheat bran fiber exhibited lower weight gain, lipid profiles and insulin resistance, compared with HFC diet. The two cereal dietary fibers potently decreased protein expressions of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 and key factors involved in lipogenesis, including fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase in target tissues. At molecular level, the two cereal dietary fibers augmented protein expressions of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha and gamma, liver X receptor alpha, and ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 in target tissues. Our findings indicated that cereal dietary fiber supplementation abrogated obesity-related liver lipotoxicity and dyslipidemia in C57BL/6J mice fed a HFC diet. In addition, the efficacy of oat fiber is greater than wheat bran fiber in normalizing these metabolic disorders and pathological profiles.
The expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is highly regulated in normal cells, whereas some cancer cells have high constitutive levels. Understanding naturally-occurring ways of downregulating EGFR in cancer cells was investigated. Phosphatidic acid (PA) or Nuclear Receptors (NR) PPARα/RXRα/LXRα, enhance EGFR expression, mediated by the promoter region -856(A) to -226(T). Unexpectedly, the combination of NRs and PA caused repression. PA induces a conformational change in the nuclear receptor PPARα (increase of alpha-helices at the expense of decreasing beta-sheets), as evidenced by circular dichroism. This represses the naturally-enhancing capability of PPARα on EGFR transcription. PPARα-overexpressing cells in the presence of PA &gt; 300 nM or the enzyme that produces it, phospholipase D (PLD), downregulate EGFR expression. The reasons are two-fold. First, PA displaces PPARα binding to the EGFR promoter at those concentrations. Second, NR heterodimer-dependent promoter activity is weakened in the presence of PA in vivo. Since other genes considered (β-catenin, cyclin D3, PLD2 and ACOX-1) are also downregulated with a PA + PPARα combination, the transrepression appears to be a global phenomenon. Lastly, the reported effect is greater in MCF-7 than in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, which could provide a novel basis for regulating excessive expression of EGFR in luminal cancer cells.
Liver disease is the second most common cause of mortality in HIV-infected persons. Exactly how HIV infection per se affects liver disease progression is unknown. Here we have investigated mRNA expression of 49 nuclear hormone receptors (NRs) and 35 transcriptional coregulators in HepG2 cells upon stimulation with the HIV matrix protein p17. This viral protein regulated mRNA expression of some NRs among which LXRα and its transcriptional co-activator MED1 were highly induced at mRNA level. Dissection of p17 downstream intracellular pathway demonstrated that p17 mediated activation of Jak/STAT signaling is responsible for the promoter dependent activation of LXR. The treatment of both HepG2 as well as primary hepatocytes with HIV p17 results in the transcriptional activation of LXR target genes (SREBP1c and FAS) and lipid accumulation. These effects are lost in HepG2 cells pre-incubated with a serum from HIV positive person who underwent a vaccination with a p17 peptide as well as in HepG2 cells pre-incubated with the natural LXR antagonist gymnestrogenin. These results suggest that HIV p17 affects NRs and their related signal transduction thus contributing to the progression of liver disease in HIV infected patients. 
Liver X receptors (LXRs) contribute not only to maintain cholesterol homeostasis but also to control cell growth. However, the molecular mechanisms behind the LXR-mediated anti-proliferative effects are largely unknown. Here we show, by immunohistochemistry, that LXRα and LXRβ are differentially distributed in oral stratified squamous epithelia. By immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses, we also reveal that LXRα is abundantly expressed in human oral squamous cell carcinoma (HOSCC) tissues and cell lines. Cell counting, BrdU labeling and cell cycle assay indicated that LXR stimulation led to significant reduction of proliferation in HOSCC cells. Importantly, our study highlights, by using RNA interference, that the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1)-accelerated cholesterol efflux is critical for the growth inhibitory action of LXRs in HOSCC cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that LXR activation reduces the growth of xenograft tumour of HOSCC cells in mice accompanied by the upregulation of ABCA1 expression and the decline of cholesterol levels in the tumour. These findings strongly suggested that targeting the LXR-regulated cholesterol transport, yielding in lowering intracellular cholesterol levels, could be a promising therapeutic option for certain types of cancers. 
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are key regulators of lipid homeostasis and are involved in multiple testicular functions. The Lxrα(-/-);Lxrβ(-/-) mice have illuminated the roles of both isoforms in maintenance of the epithelium in the seminiferous tubules, spermatogenesis, and T production. The requirement for LXRβ in Sertoli cells have been emphasized by early abnormal cholesteryl ester accumulation in the Lxrβ(-/-) and Lxrα(-/-);Lxrβ(-/-) mice. Other phenotypes, such as germ cell loss and hypogonadism, occur later in life in the Lxrα(-/-);Lxrβ(-/-) mice. Thus, LXRβ expression in Sertoli cells seems to be essential for normal testicular physiology. To decipher the roles of LXRβ within the Sertoli cells, we generated Lxrα(-/-);Lxrβ(-/-):AMH-Lxrβ transgenic mice, which reexpress Lxrβ in Sertoli cells in the context of Lxrα(-/-);Lxrβ(-/-) mice. In addition to lipid homeostasis, LXRβ is necessary for maintaining the blood-testis barrier and the integrity of the germ cell epithelium. LXRβ is also implicated in the paracrine action of Sertoli cells on Leydig cells to modulate T synthesis. The Lxrα(-/-);Lxrβ(-/-) and Lxrα(-/-);Lxrβ(-/-):AMH-Lxrβ mice exhibit lipid accumulation in germ cells after the Abcg8 down-regulation, suggesting an intricate LXRβ-dependent cooperation between the Sertoli cells and germ cells to ensure spermiogenesis. Further analysis revealed also peritubular smooth muscle defects (abnormal lipid accumulation and disorganized smooth muscle actin) and spermatozoa stagnation in the seminiferous tubules. Together the present work elucidates specific roles of LXRβ in Sertoli cell physiology in vivo beyond lipid homeostasis. 
The liver X receptors (LXRs) are important regulators of lipid, cholesterol, and glucose homeostasis by transcriptional regulation of many key genes in these processes, and the transcriptional activities of LXRs are finely controlled by cooperating with retinoid X receptors and many other coregulators. Here, we report that the LIM protein Ajuba binds to the hinge and the ligand binding domains of LXRα via its C-terminal tandem LIM motifs and enhances LXR target gene expression in liver cells. Depletion of Ajuba in HepG2 cells and in mouse primary hepatocytes decreases LXR target gene expression, whereas stable expression of Ajuba in HepG2 cells results in increased expression of these genes. Mechanistic investigations found that Ajuba selectively interacts with LXRα/retinoid X receptor-γ heterodimer to form a ternary complex, which displays a higher transactivation activity to LXR target genes. Moreover, Ajuba and LXR mutually affect their DNA binding activity at endogenous target chromatins and the cooperation between Ajuba and LXRα is dependent on the functional LXR response elements located in the target promoters. Together, our studies demonstrate that Ajuba is a novel coactivator for LXRs and may play important role in lipid and glucose metabolism. 
Liver X receptor (LXR) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, and it regulates various biologic processes, including de novo lipogenesis, cholesterol metabolism, and inflammation. Selective inhibition of LXR may aid the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of three cinnamamide derivatives on ligand-induced LXRα activation and explored whether these derivatives could attenuate steatosis in mice. N-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl) 3,4-dimethoxycinnamamide (TFCA) decreased the luciferase activity in LXRE-tk-Luc-transfected cells and also suppressed ligand-induced lipid accumulation and expression of the lipogenic genes in murine hepatocytes. Furthermore, it significantly attenuated hepatic neutral lipid accumulation in a ligand-induced fatty liver mouse system. Modeling study indicated that TFCA inhibited activation of the LXRα ligand-binding domain by hydrogen bonding to Arg305 in the H5 region of that domain. It regulated the transcriptional control exerted by LXRα by influencing coregulator exchange; this process involves dissociation of the thyroid hormone receptor-associated proteins (TRAP)/DRIP coactivator and recruitment of the nuclear receptor corepressor. These results show that TFCA has the potential to attenuate ligand-induced lipogenesis and fatty liver by selectively inhibiting LXRα in the liver. 
The dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism and inflammation plays a significant role in the progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Anthocyanins are polyphenols widely distributed in food and exert various biological effects including antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antihyperlipidemic effects. However, it remains unclear whether anthocyanins are associated with DN, and the mechanisms involved in the reciprocal regulation of inflammation and cholesterol efflux are yet to be elucidated. In this study, we evaluated the regulation of cholesterol metabolism and the anti-inflammatory effects exerted by anthocyanins (cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside chloride [C3G] or cyanidin chloride [Cy]) and investigated the underlying molecular mechanism of action using high-glucose (HG)-stimulated HK-2 cells. We found that anthocyanins enhanced cholesterol efflux and ABCA1 expression markedly in HK-2 cells. In addition, they increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and liver X receptor alpha (LXRα) expression and decreased the HG-induced expression of the proinflammatory cytokines intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1), and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGFβ1), as well as NFκB activation. Incubation with the PPARα-specific inhibitor GW6471 and LXRα shRNA attenuated the anthocyanin-mediated promotion of ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux, suggesting that anthocyanins activated PPARα-LXRα-ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux in HK-2 cells. Moreover, the knockout of LXRα abrogated the anti-inflammatory effect of anthocyanins, whereas the PPARα antagonist GW6471 does not have this effect. Further investigations revealed that LXRα might interfere with anthocyanin-induced decreased ICAM1, MCP1, and TGFβ1 expression by reducing the nuclear translocation of NFκB. Collectively, these findings suggest that blocking cholesterol deposition and inhibiting the LXRα pathway-induced inflammatory response might be one of the main mechanisms by which anthocyanins exert their protective effects in DN. 
Meiosis-activating sterols (MAS) are substrates of SC4MOL and NSDHL in the cholesterol pathway and are important for normal organismal development. Oncogenic transformation by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or RAS increases the demand for cholesterol, suggesting a possibility for metabolic interference. To test this idea in vivo, we ablated Nsdhl in adult keratinocytes expressing KRAS(G12D). Strikingly, Nsdhl inactivation antagonized the growth of skin tumors while having little effect on normal skin. Loss of Nsdhl induced the expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1, reduced the expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), decreased intracellular cholesterol, and was dependent on the liver X receptor (LXR) α. Importantly, EGFR signaling opposed LXRα effects on cholesterol homeostasis, whereas an EGFR inhibitor synergized with LXRα agonists in killing cancer cells. Inhibition of SC4MOL or NSDHL, or activation of LXRα by sterol metabolites, can be an effective strategy against carcinomas with activated EGFR-KRAS signaling.
The activation of liver X receptor (LXR) α or LXRβ negatively regulates the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in mammalian cells. We recently reported that 25-hydroxycholesterol, a representative LXR-activating oxysterol, suppresses IL-6 production in mouse mast cells (MCs) following its engagement of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI). This finding suggests that murine MCs express functional LXRs; however, the mechanisms underlying the LXR-dependent repression of the MC-mediated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, are poorly understood. Therefore, we employed the synthetic LXR ligand GW3965 to examine the functions of LXRα and LXRβ in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by murine bone marrow-derived MCs (BMMCs).
We prepared BMMCs from wild-type (WT), LXRα(-/-), and LXRα/β(-/-) mice. Each group of BMMCs was pretreated with GW3965 and then stimulated with IgE+antigen (Ag) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Cytokine production was then analyzed using specific ELISA kits.
The activation of LXRs by GW3965 significantly attenuated the production of IL-1α and IL-1β, but not of IL-6, in the WT and LXRα(-/-) BMMCs stimulated with IgE+Ag. However, GW3965 treatment decreased the production of IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in WT and LXRα(-/-) BMMCs upon stimulation with LPS, while the GW3965-mediated suppression of cytokine production was nearly absent from the LXRα/β(-/-) BMMCs.
These findings demonstrate, for the first time, that the activation of LXRs by GW3965 attenuates the antigen- or LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1α and IL-1β, in murine MCs and that LXRβ plays an important role in the LXR-mediated repression of cytokine production.
Adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is a crucial cholesterol transporter and plays a central role in the high density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol metabolism and lipid clearance from the foam cell. Lipoxin A4 (LXA4) is an endogenous lipid mediator that requires cell-cell interaction or cell-platelet interaction for its synthesis. The roles of LXA4 on inflammatory responses are well described, while its effects on mediating ABCA1 and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we showed that LXA4 significantly increases expression of ABCA1 and LXRα in a dose-dependent manner in THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells. Cellular cholesterol content was decreased while cholesterol efflux was increased by LXA4 treatment. However, after short interfering RNA of LXRα, the effects of LXA4 on ABCA1 expression and cholesterol metabolism were significantly abolished. These results provide evidence that LXA4 increases ABCA1 expression and promotes cholesterol efflux through LXRα pathway in THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells. 
Steatotic liver grafts, although accepted, increase the risk of poor posttransplantation liver function. However, the growing demand for adequate donor organs has led to the increased use of so-called marginal grafts. Liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha) is important in fatty acid metabolism and interrelated with the specific ischemia-reperfusion injury in fatty liver transplantation. This study aimed to investigate whether LXRalpha RNA interference (RNAi) could improve the organ function of liver transplant recipients.
Fifty Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with a high-fat diet and 56% alcohol. The livers of these animals had greater than 60% macrovesicular steatosis and were used as liver donors. The experimental donors were treated with 7X107 TU LXRalpha-RNAi-LV of a mixture injection and control donors with negative control-LV vector injection into the portal vein 72 hours before the operation. The effects of LXRalpha-RNAi-LV were assessed by serum aminotransferases, histology, immunostaining, and protein levels. The transcription of LXRalpha mRNA was assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.
Compared with controls, LXRalpha RNAi inhibited the expression of LXRalpha at the mRNA (0.53+/-0.03 vs 0.94+/-0.02, P&lt;0.05) and protein levels (0.51+/-0.08 vs 1.09+/-0.12, P&lt;0.05). LXRalpha RNAi also decreased the expressions of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) and CD36. LXRalpha RNAi consequently reduced fatty acid accumulation in hepatocytes. Compared with control animals, LXRalpha RNAi-treated group had lower serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, interleukin-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels and milder pathologic damages. TUNEL analysis revealed a significant reduction of apoptosis in the livers of rats treated with LXRalpha-RNAi-LV, and overall survival as determined by the Kaplan-Meier method was improved among rats treated with LXRalpha-RNAi-LV (P&lt;0.05).
LXRalpha-RNAi-LV treatment significantly downregulated LXRalpha expression and improve steatotic liver graft function and recipient survival after a fatty liver transplantation in rats.
ANGPTL8 is a liver-derived secretory protein that leads to elevated serum triglyceride and the level of circulating ANGPTL8 is strongly associated with obesity and diabetes. Here we investigated the mechanisms of activation and inhibition of ANGPTL8 expression in hepatocytes. The expression of ANGPTL8 was significantly increased in HepG2 cells exposed to palmitic acid, tunicamycin, or T0901317, and was reversed in cells treated with AICAR. Palmitic acid, tunicamycin, and T0901317 increased LXRα and SREBP-1c mRNA expression. The inhibitory effect of AICAR on the expression of T0901317-induced ANGPTL8 was most strongly evident in cells that were transfected with SREBP-1 siRNA. AICAR increased phosphorylation of PPARα and the effect of AICAR was not observed in cells treated with PPARα inhibitor. Metformin had a similar effect on ANGPTL8 expression to that of AICAR. These data suggest that AMPK can suppress the expression of LXR/SREBP-1 signal-induced ANGPTL8 in HepG2 cells. 
The liver X receptor (LXR) isoform LXR‑α has a significant role in lipid metabolism and innate immunity. Overexpression of neuron‑derived orphan nuclear receptor‑1 (NOR‑1) in macrophages reduces the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. However, to date, the mechanisms via which NOR‑1 inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‑induced inflammation in Kupffer cells (KCs) via LXR‑α have not been elucidated. T0901317 is the most potent LXR‑α ligand, leading to its activation. In the present study, KCs were isolated from C57BL/6 mice and randomly divided into five groups: Control, T0901317, LPS, LPS + T0901317 and LPS + T0901317 + NOR‑1 small hairpin (sh)RNA groups. In order to investigate the role of NOR‑1 in inflammation, shRNA targeting NOR‑1 was used to specifically knock down NOR‑1 mRNA in KCs. The expression levels of LXR‑α and NOR‑1 in KCs were determined by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses. The protein levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‑α and interleukin (IL)‑10 in the supernatant of KCs were evaluated by ELISA. The results revealed that LXR‑α expression in the T0901317 group was higher than that in the control group; furthermore, LXR‑α expression was higher in KCs treated with LPS + T0901317 compared with that in KCs treated with LPS only. The expression levels of NOR‑1 in each group showed a similar trend. shRNA targeting of NOR‑1 suppressed the mRNA expression of NOR‑1, but had no influence on LXR‑α mRNA expression. NOR‑1 protein expression was augmented in the LPS + T0901317 group compared with that in the LPS + T09 + shRNA group. In the supernatant of KCs, the TNF‑α levels in the LPS + T0901317 group were lower than those in the LPS group, whereas the IL‑10 levels were higher in the LPS + T0901317 group compared with those in the LPS group. The results of the present study suggested that ligand T0901317 promotes LXR‑α expression, which consequently suppresses LPS‑induced inflammation by elevating NOR‑1 expression in KCs.
It has been suggested that retinoic acid (RA) has a potential role in the prevention of atherosclerotic CVD. In the present study, we used J774A.1 cell lines and primary peritoneal macrophages to investigate the protective effects of RA on foam cell formation and atherogenesis in apoE-deficient (apoE- / -) mice. A total of twenty male apoE- / - mice (n 10 animals per group), aged 8 weeks, were fed on a high-fat diet (HFD) and treated with vehicle or 9-cis-RA for 8 weeks. The atherosclerotic plaque area in the aortic sinus of mice in the 9-cis-RA group was 40·7 % less than that of mice in the control group (P&lt; 0·01). Mouse peritoneal macrophages from the 9-cis-RA group had higher protein expression levels of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and G1 (ABCG1) than those from the control group. Serum total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations were lower in the 9-cis-RA group than in the control group (P&lt; 0·05). In vitro studies showed that incubation of cholesterol-loaded J774A.1 macrophages with 9-cis-RA (0·1, 1 and 10 μmol/l) induced cholesterol efflux in a dose-dependent manner. The 9-cis-RA treatment markedly attenuated lipid accumulation in macrophages exposed to oxidised LDL. Moreover, treatment with 9-cis-RA significantly increased the protein expression levels of ABCA1 and ABCG1 in J774A.1 macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, 9-cis-RA dose-dependently enhanced the protein expression level of liver X receptor-α (LXRα), the upstream regulator of ABCA1 and ABCG1. Taken together, the present results show that 9-cis-RA suppresses foam cell formation and prevents HFD-induced atherogenesis via the LXRα-dependent up-regulation of ABCA1 and ABCG1.
Pathological cardiac hypertrophy is characterized by a shift in metabolic substrate utilization from fatty acids to glucose, but the molecular events underlying the metabolic remodeling remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of liver X receptors (LXRs), which are key regulators of glucose and lipid metabolism, in cardiac hypertrophic pathogenesis. Using a transgenic approach in mice, we show that overexpression of LXRα acts to protect the heart against hypertrophy, fibrosis, and dysfunction. Gene expression profiling studies revealed that genes regulating metabolic pathways were differentially expressed in hearts with elevated LXRα. Functionally, LXRα overexpression in isolated cardiomyocytes and murine hearts markedly enhanced the capacity for myocardial glucose uptake following hypertrophic stress. Conversely, this adaptive response was diminished in LXRα-deficient mice. Transcriptional changes induced by LXRα overexpression promoted energy-independent utilization of glucose via the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, resulting in O-GlcNAc modification of GATA4 and Mef2c and the induction of cytoprotective natriuretic peptide expression. Our results identify LXRα as a key cardiac transcriptional regulator that helps orchestrate an adaptive metabolic response to chronic cardiac stress, and suggest that modulating LXRα may provide a unique opportunity for intervening in myocyte metabolism. 
Atherosclerosis, the major pathology of cardiovascular disease, is caused by multiple factors involving psychological stress. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which is released by neurosecretory cells in the hypothalamus, peripheral nerve terminals and epithelial cells, regulates various stress-related responses. Our current study aimed to verify the role of CRH in macrophage foam cell formation, the initial critical stage of atherosclerosis. Our quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR, and Western blot results indicate that CRH down-regulates ATP-binding cassette transporter-1 (ABCA1) and liver X receptor (LXR)-α, a transcription factor for ABCA1, in murine peritoneal macrophages and human monocyte-derived macrophages. Oil-red O (ORO) staining and intracellular cholesterol measurement of macrophages treated with or without oxidized LDL (oxLDL) and with or without CRH (10 nM) in the presence of apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1) revealed that CRH treatment promotes macrophage foam cell formation. The boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY)-conjugated cholesterol efflux assay showed that CRH treatment reduces macrophage cholesterol efflux. Western blot analysis showed that CRH-induced down-regulation of ABCA1 is dependent on phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473) induced by interaction between CRH and CRH receptor 1(CRHR1). We conclude that activation of this pathway by CRH accelerates macrophage foam cell formation and may promote stress-related atherosclerosis. 
20(S)-protopanaxatriol (PPT) is an aglycone of ginsenosides isolated from Panax ginseng and has several interesting activities, including anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress effects. Herein, PPT was identified as an inhibitor against the ligand-dependent transactivation of liver X receptor α (LXRα) using a Gal4-TK-luciferase reporter system. LXRα is a transcription factor of nuclear hormone receptor family and stimulates the transcription of many metabolic genes, such as lipogenesis- or reverse cholesterol transport (RCT)-related genes. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that PPT inhibited the LXRα-dependent transcription of lipogenic genes, such as sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), fatty acid synthase, and stearoyl CoA desaturase 1. These inhibitory effects of PPT are, at least in part, a consequence of the reduced recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the LXR response element (LXRE) of the SREBP-1c promoter. Furthermore, LXRα-dependent triglyceride accumulation in primary mouse hepatocytes was significantly reduced by PPT. Interestingly, PPT did not inhibit the LXRα-dependent transcription of ABCA1, a crucial LXRα target gene involved in RCT. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that PPT repressed recruitment of the lipogenic coactivator TRAP80 to the SREBP-1c LXRE, but not the ABCA1 LXRE. Overall, these data suggest that PPT has selective inhibitory activity against LXRα-mediated lipogenesis, but not LXRα-stimulated RCT. 
Curcumin, a traditional Chinese derivative from the rhizomes of Curcuma longa, is beneficial to health by modulating lipid metabolism and suppressing atherogenesis. A key part of atherosclerosis is the failure of macrophages to restore their cellular cholesterol homeostasis and the formation of foam cells. In this study, results showed that curcumin dramatically increased the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1), promoted cholesterol efflux from THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells, and reduced cellular cholesterol levels. Curcumin activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and SIRT1, and then activated LXRα in THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells. Inhibiting AMPK/SIRT1 activity by its specific inhibitor or by small interfering RNA could inhibit LXRα activation and abolish curcumin-induced ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux. Thus, curcumin enhanced cholesterol efflux by upregulating ABCA1 expression through activating AMPK-SIRT1-LXRα signaling in THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells. This study describes a possible mechanism for understanding the antiatherogenic effects of curcumin on attenuating the progression of atherosclerosis. 
Here, we investigated the role of LXRα in capsaicin mediated anti-inflammatory effects. Results revealed that capsaicin inhibits LPS-induced IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α production in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Moreover, capsaicin increases LXRα expression through PPARγ pathway. Inhibition of LXRα activation by siRNA diminished the inhibitory action of capsaicin on LPS-induced IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α production. Additionally, LXRα siRNA abrogated the inhibitory action of capsaicin on p65 NF-κB protein expression. Thus, we propose that the anti-inflammatory effects of capsaicin are LXRα dependent, and LXRα may potentially link the capsaicin mediated PPARγ activation and NF-κB inhibition in LPS-induced inflammatory response.
Peripheral neural sensory mechanisms play a crucial role in metabolic regulation but less is known about the mechanisms underlying vagal sensing itself. Recently, we identified an enrichment of liver X receptor alpha and beta (LXRα/β) in the nodose ganglia of the vagus nerve. In this study, we show mice lacking LXRα/β in peripheral sensory neurons have increased energy expenditure and weight loss when fed a Western diet (WD). Our findings suggest that the ability to metabolize and sense cholesterol and/or fatty acids in peripheral neurons is an important requirement for physiological adaptations to WDs. 
Fourteen novel compounds were prepared and their antagonistic activities against liver X receptors (LXR) α/β were tested in vitro. Compound 26 had an IC50 value of 6.4 µM against LXRα and an IC50 value of 5.6 µM against LXRβ. Docking studies and the results of structure-activity relationships support the further development of this chemical series as LXRα/β antagonists. 
We studied the effects of alfalfa saponin extract (ASE) on low density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr), liver X receptor α (LXRα), and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in normal and hyperlipidemic Buffalo rat liver (BRL) cells. Normal and hyperlipidemic BRL cells were divided into eight groups: normal, or normal cells treated with 50, 100, and 150 mg/L ASE, hyperlipidemic, or hyperlipidemic cells treated with 50, 100, and 150 mg/L ASE. After treatment for 24 h, Ldlr, LXRα, and FXR mRNA expression levels were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Data showed that mRNA expression of Ldlr in normal BRL cells was significantly up-regulated by ASE treatment and mRNA expressions of LXRα and FXR were significantly down-regulated both in normal and hyperlipidemic BRL cells after ASE treatment. Thus, ASE might ameliorate hepatic steatosis by regulating genes involved in cholesterol metabolism, including up-regulation of Ldlr as well as down-regulation of LXRα and FXR. 
Macrophage foam cell formation is the most prominent characteristic of the early stages of atherosclerosis. Ubiquitin Fold Modifier 1 (UFM1) is a new member of the ubiquitin-like protein family, and its underlying mechanism of action in macrophage foam cell formation is poorly understood. Our current study focuses on UFM1 and investigates its role in macrophage foam cell formation.
Using real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot analysis, we first analyzed the UFM1 expression in mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPMs) from ApoE－/－ mice in vivo and in human macrophages treated with oxLDL in vitro. Subsequently, the effects of UFM1 on macrophages foam cell formation were determined by Nile Red staining and direct lipid analysis. We then examined whether UFM1 affects the process of lipid metabolism in macrophages. Lastly, with the method of small interfering RNA (siRNA), we delineated the mechanism of UFM1 to attenuate lipid accumulation in THP-1 macrophages.
UFM1 is dramatically upregulated under atherosclerosis conditions both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, UFM1 markedly decreased macrophage foam cell formation. Mechanistic studies revealed that UFM1 increased the macrophage cholesterol efflux, which was due to the increased expression of ATP-binding cassette transporters A1 (ABCA1) and G1 (ABCG1). Furthermore, the upregulation of ABCA1 and ABCG1 by UFM1 resulted from liver X receptor α (LXRα) activation, which was confirmed by the observation that LXRα siRNA prevented the expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1. Consistent with this, the UFM1-mediated attenuation of lipid accumulation was abolished by such inhibition.
Taken together, our results showed that UFM1 could suppress foam cell formation via the LXRα-dependent pathway.
To investigate the effect of transplanted fetal liver epithelial progenitor (FLEP) cells on liver fibrosis in mice.
FLEP cells were isolated from embryonal day (ED) 14 BALB/c mice and transplanted into female syngenic BALB/c mice (n = 60). After partial hepatectomy (PH), diethylnitrosamine (DEN) was administered to induce liver fibrosis. Controls received FLEP cells and non-supplemented drinking water, the model group received DEN-spiked water, and the experimental group received FLEP cells and DEN. Mice were killed after 1, 2, and 3 mo, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), hyaluronic acid (HA), and laminin (LN) in serum, and hydroxyproline (Hyp) content in liver were assessed. Alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) of liver was tested by immunohistochemistry. Transplanted male mice FLEP cells were identified by immunocytochemistry for sry (sex determination region for Y chromosome) protein.
Serum ALT, AST, HA, and LN were markedly reduced by transplanted FLEP cells. Liver Hyp content and alpha-SMA staining in mice receiving FLEP cells were lower than that of the model group, which was consistent with altered liver pathology. Transplanted cells proliferated and differentiated into hepatocytes and bile duct epithelial cells with 30%-50% repopulation in the liver fibrosis induced by DEN after 3 mo.
Transplanted FLEP cells proliferate and differentiate into hepatocytes and bile duct epithelial cells with high repopulation capacity in the fiberized liver induced by DEN, which restores liver function and reduces liver fibrosis.
The autoimmune nature of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is well established. We tested the hypothesis that fetal microchimerism indicated by the persistence of circulating fetal cells in women years after pregnancy might contribute to the aetiopathogenesis of PBC through a graft-versus-host-like response. We extracted DNA from the peripheral blood cells of 36 women carefully selected from 173 consecutive PBC patients, who were matched with 36 healthy women by age, age of last son, and number of children. Both patients and controls had to have male offspring, and no history of miscarriages or blood transfusions; they could not be twins. We tested all of the samples for the presence of two specific Y-chromosome sequences (SY154 and SRY) by amplifying DNA in a nested polymerase chain reaction. Y-chromosome-specific DNA was detected in the peripheral blood cell DNA of 13 (36%) of the 36 women with PBC and in 11 (31%) of the 36 healthy controls. The two groups of PBC patients with and without male DNA sequences were similar in terms of their clinical, biochemical, and serological features. Y-chromosome sequences were found in three of the four PBC women with associated systemic sclerosis. All of the 24 Y-positive samples contained SY154 sequences, but only three PBC patients and six controls showed the presence of both SY154 and SRY sequences. This discrepancy may suggest that not only fetal cells but also fragments of fetal DNA are present in maternal circulation. Overall, our data do not support the hypothesis that fetal microchimerism plays a significant role in the onset or progression of PBC.
The drug discovery research for cholestatic liver diseases has been hampered by the lack of a well-established human cholangiocyte model. Functional cholangiocyte-like cells differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells are expected to be a promising candidate for such research, but there remains no well-established method for differentiating cholangiocytes from human iPS cells. In this study, we searched for a suitable extracellular matrix to promote cholangiocyte differentiation from human iPS cells, and found that both laminin 411 and laminin 511 were suitable for this purpose. The gene expression levels of the cholangiocyte markers, aquaporin 1 (AQP1), SRY-box 9 (SOX9), cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 (GPBAR1), Jagged 1 (JAG1), secretin receptor (SCTR), and γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT1) were increased by using laminin 411 or laminin 511 as a matrix. In addition, the percentage of AQP1-positive cells was increased from 61.8% to 92.5% by using laminin 411 or laminin 511. Furthermore, the diameter and number of cysts consisted of cholangiocyte-like cells were increased when using either matrix. We believe that the human iPS cell-derived cholangiocyte-like cells, which were generated by using our differentiation technology, would be useful for the drug discovery research of cholestatic liver diseases.
Based on our recent finding that disruption of bile acid (BA) homeostasis in mice results in the induction of hepatic long noncoding RNA H19 expression, we sought to elucidate the role of H19 in cholestatic liver fibrosis. Hepatic overexpression of H19RNA augmented bile duct ligation (BDL)-induced liver fibrosis, which was accompanied by the elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, and BA levels. Multiple genes related to liver fibrosis, inflammation, and biliary hyperplasia were increased in H19-BDL versus null-BDL mice, whereas genes in BA synthesis were decreased. Livers and spleens of H19-BDL mice showed significant enrichment of CD3+γδ+, interleukin-4, and interleukin-17 producing CD4+ and CD8+ immune cell populations. H19 down-regulated hepatic zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) but up-regulated epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 9 expression. Mechanistically, ZEB1 repressed EpCAM promoter activity and gene transcription. H19RNA impeded ZEB1's inhibitory action by interacting with ZEB1 protein to prevent its binding to the EpCAM promoter. Hepatic overexpression of ZEB1 or knockdown of EpCAM diminished H19-induced fibrosis; the latter was also prevented in H19-/- mice. H19RNA was markedly induced by bile acids in mouse small cholangiocytes and to a lesser extent in mouse large cholangiocytes. The up-regulation of H19RNA and EpCAM correlated positively with the down-regulation of ZEB1 in primary sclerosing cholangitis and primary biliary cirrhosis liver specimens.
The activation of hepatic H19RNA promoted cholestatic liver fibrosis in mice through the ZEB1/EpCAM signaling pathway. (Hepatology 2017;66:1183-1196).
The antiretroviral combination of emtricitabine-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in individuals at high risk for acquiring human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in July 2012. Since then, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for the use of PrEP have been published and implemented into clinical practice throughout the United States. A number of published open-label and PrEP demonstration projects have evaluated the real-world use of PrEP including analysis of the barriers to its use and addressing major concerns. Despite the approval of FTC/TDF for PrEP, its use for this indication relies on patient and provider acceptance, and its effectiveness requires patient adherence and retention in care during periods of high-risk behaviors. Concerns regarding the use of PrEP in healthy individuals persist and include medication adverse effects including renal dysfunction and bone mineral density loss; risk compensation leading to HIV infections, sexually transmitted infections, and unintended pregnancies; and the development of drug resistance in the event of seroconversion. The cost-effectiveness of PrEP continues to be assessed with the greatest cost-effectiveness remaining in those at highest risk of acquiring HIV. Additionally, cases of HIV acquisition in individuals who are adherent to PrEP highlight scenarios in which PrEP is not 100% effective including against the transmission of drug-resistant HIV strains. This review examines data on the implementation of PrEP outside the setting of clinical trials with the aim of providing clinicians with a summary of the current barriers and opportunities for PrEP use with a specific focus on the role of pharmacists in the optimization of PrEP implementation.
No controlled trial in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection on long-term entecavir (ETV) treatment, comparing switching to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) with continuing the therapy, has been reported. Twenty-seven nucleos(t)ide-naïve patients with chronic HBV who underwent ETV therapy for ≥5 years and maintained virological response were included and randomized into two groups: one group continued ETV, and the other switched to TDF, in a 1:2 ratio. The primary endpoint was changed from baseline in serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) level at week 48. The baseline characteristics were not different between nineteen patients in the TDF group and eight patients in the ETV group. Mean decreases in HBsAg level at week 48 were 0.023 and 0.042 log10  IU/mL in the TDF and ETV groups, respectively (P = 0.94). The mean drops in hepatitis B core-related antigens were also not different between the TDF and ETV groups at week 48 (P = 0.80). HBV DNA was sustainedly &lt;2.1 log 10  copies/mL in all patients throughout the study period. In contrast, the mean aminotransferase levels were significantly higher in the TDF group than in the ETV group at weeks 12, 24, and 36, although being within the reference range. Estimated glomerular filtration rate was lower in the TDF group than in the ETV group at weeks 24 (P = 0.016) and 48 (P = 0.003). In conclusion, we could not find the effect on reducing HBsAg level by switching to TDF in chronic hepatitis B patients with maintained virological response to ETV for ≥5 years.
HIV-load decrease and suppression over time is associated with consistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Our study aimed to evaluate the difference in viral load and adherence of patients treated with a combination of either Tenofovir (TDF), Lamivudine (3TC) and Efavirenz (EFV) or TDF / Zidovudine (AZT), 3TC and Nevirapine (NVP) regimens at 24 and 48 weeks.
A longitudinal study was conducted from May 2016 to June 2017 among 256 HIV infected adult patients who were enrolled at two approved treatment hospitals in Yaoundé, before the start of first-line ART. Whole blood samples were collected using standard operating procedures. HIV-loads were determined by a quantitative RealTime PCR assay. Adherence was evaluated by pharmacy refill data records. Statistical analyses were performed using the PRISM 5.0 software.
Off the 256 HIV infected patients enrolled, 180 (70%) patients completed the study and 76 (30%) patients were lost to follow-up. The success rate in achieving viral load &lt; 40 copies/ml was 1.8 times higher with the EFV regimen at 24 weeks and was 1.2 times higher in the NVP regimen at 48 weeks. At 48 weeks the treatment failure rate was 12.0 and 40.0% in patients on EFV and the NVP regimen, respectively. The rate of adherence varied in both ART based regimens with 84.0 to 74.0% for EFV and 65.5 to 62.5% for NVP, at 24 and 48 weeks respectively.
In our study and setting, the rate of viral load decrease was higher in the NVP based regimen than with the EFV regimen. The adherence rate to ART was higher in the EFV regimen, compared to the NVP regimen. This adds to evidence that the EFV regimen is the preferred ART combination for non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs).
There is a growing interest in the development of functional ingredients, including those with high indigestible carbohydrate content. Unripe plantain flour (UPF) is a source of indigestible carbohydrates, type II resistant starch (RS) in particular. A major drawback of UPF, however, is that its RS content decreases sharply after wet heat treatment. Here, we explore the possibility of preparing an extruded UPF-based functional ingredient that retains limited starch digestibility features and high dietary fiber content. Both an unripe plantain pulp flour (UPFP) and a whole (pulp and peel) unripe plantain flour (UPFW) were prepared, extruded under identical conditions and evaluated for their gelatinization degree, total starch (TS), resistant starch (RS), and total dietary fiber (TDF) content; functional properties, such as pasting profile, water retention capacity, and solubility, and oil absorption index were also analyzed. The extruded functional ingredient was added to a yogurt and the rheological characteristics and in vitro starch digestibility of the product were evaluated. The extruded UPFW showed a lower gelatinization degree than the extruded UPFP, which may be due to the higher non-starch polysaccharide content of the former. A high TDF content was recorded in both extrudates (12.4% in UPFP and 18.5% in UPFW), including a significant RS fraction. The water retention capacity and solubility indices were higher in the extruded flours, particularly in UPFW, while only marginal differences in oil retention capacity were observed among the products. The addition of UPFP or UPFW (1.5 g TDF, w/v) to a yogurt did not alter the viscosity of the product, an important characteristic for the consumer's approval. Moreover, the composite yogurt showed a relatively low starch digestion rate. Extrusion of UPFs may be an alternative for the production of functional ingredients with important DF contents.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HIV coinfection is associated with risk of progression to chronic liver disease. We assessed liver stiffness in HBV-HIV coinfected youths.
A cross-sectional study in HBV-HIV coinfected youths aged 18 to 25 years who received a tenofovir (TDF)-containing antiretroviral therapy regimen for &gt;96 weeks. Measurements included HBV DNA level, HBV serology profiles, and transient elastography (TE). The cutoff for TE results included ≥5.9 kPa for F2-moderate fibrosis, ≥7.4 kPa for F3-severe fibrosis, and ≥9.6 kPa for F4-cirrhosis.
From March to December 2016, 15 HBV-HIV coinfected youths with a median duration on TDF-containing regimens of 3.3 years were enrolled. Five (33%) youths had significant liver fibrosis, 3 with F2-moderate, 1 with F3-advanced fibrosis, and 1 with F4-cirrhosis. Other 5 without liver fibrosis had hepatitis B surface e antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B surface e antigen (HBeAg) loss. Higher mean alanine transaminase (ALT) was observed among the group with F2-F4 when compared to those with F0.
Liver fibrosis was evidenced in HBV-HIV coinfected youths in Thailand. Transient elastography might be considered for those who do not achieve HBsAg loss or have persistent ALT elevation while on treatment.
Mental health (MH) disorders are more prevalent among persons living with HIV compared to the general population, and may contribute to suboptimal adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP), the phosphorylated anabolite of tenofovir (TFV), is a biomarker with a 17-day half-life in red blood cells. TFV-DP can be measured in dried blood spots (DBS) using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to assess adherence and cumulative drug exposure to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)-based ART. From a larger clinical cohort (N = 807), TFV-DP concentrations and a paired HIV viral load were available from 521 participants at their enrollment visit. We used multivariable linear regression to evaluate the association between TFV-DP in DBS and engagement in MH care. After adjusting for clinical covariates, participants with MH disorders who were engaged in MH care had 40% higher TFV-DP compared to participants with MH disorders who were not engaged in MH care (p &lt; 0.001), and similar TFV-DP to participants without MH disorders (p = 0.219). Further research is needed to identify the mechanism(s) for these findings, with the goal of optimizing engagement and retention in MH care strategies to improve ART adherence and clinical outcomes in PLWH with MH disorders.
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is one the most potent nucleot(s)ide analogues for treating chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Phenotypic resistance caused by genotypic resistance to TDF has not been reported. This study aimed to characterize HBV mutations that confer tenofovir resistance.
Two patients with viral breakthrough during treatment with TDF-containing regimens were prospectively enrolled. The gene encoding HBV reverse transcriptase was sequenced. Eleven HBV clones harboring a series of mutations in the reverse transcriptase gene were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. Drug susceptibility of each clone was determined by Southern blot analysis and real-time PCR. The relative frequency of mutants was evaluated by ultra-deep sequencing and clonal analysis.
Five mutations (rtS106C [C], rtH126Y [Y], rtD134E [E], rtM204I/V, and rtL269I [I]) were commonly found in viral isolates from 2 patients. The novel mutations C, Y, and E were associated with drug resistance. In assays for drug susceptibility, the IC50 value for wild-type HBV was 3.8 ± 0.6 µM, whereas the IC50 values for CYE and CYEI mutants were 14.1 ± 1.8 and 58.1 ± 0.9 µM, respectively. The IC90 value for wild-type HBV was 30 ± 0.5 µM, whereas the IC90 values for CYE and CYEI mutants were 185 ± 0.5 and 790 ± 0.2 µM, respectively. Both tenofovir-resistant mutants and wild-type HBV had similar susceptibility to the capsid assembly modulator NVR 3-778 (IC50 &lt;0.4 µM vs. IC50 = 0.4 µM, respectively).
Our study reveals that the quadruple (CYEI) mutation increases the amount of tenofovir required to inhibit HBV by 15.3-fold in IC50 and 26.3-fold in IC90. These results demonstrate that tenofovir-resistant HBV mutants can emerge, although the genetic barrier is high.
Tenofovir is the most potent nucleotide analogue for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection and there has been no hepatitis B virus mutation that confers &gt;10-fold resistance to tenofovir up to 8 years. Herein, we identified, for the first time, a quadruple mutation that conferred 15.3-fold (IC50) and 26.3-fold (IC90) resistance to tenofovir in 2 patients who experienced viral breakthrough during tenofovir treatment.
We describe the characteristics of patients infected with HIV-1 as second-line antiretroviral therapy, with persisting low-level viremia. This was a descriptive retrospective study, conducted from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2016, from the Cohort of the Infectious Diseases Department of Bobo-Dioulasso University Hospital. Patients infected with HIV-1, a second line of stable ARV treatment, with ≥95% compliance for at least 12 months, asymptomatic with CVp between 50 and 1000 copies/ml in two consecutive samplings at least 3 months apart. Out of 244 patients in second-line therapy, 79 met our inclusion criteria. The mean age of the patients was 42±10.2 years. Women (35.8 years) were younger than men (43.8 years) (p=0.001). Most were married (48.1%), 23.5% of whom were polygamous. The majority of patients (38/79) in the study had a CD4 count of &lt;200 cells/ mm3. The median duration of ARV therapy since the beginning of the therapeutic history has been 4.8 (2.5-11 years). CVp greater than 10,000 copies/ml at the start of second-line therapy (p=0.003) and TDF+FTC + DRV + RTV combination (p=0.001) were associated with persistent low viremia. A genotypic resistance test is needed for these patients in order to better adapt the ARV treatment.
Nous décrivons les caractéristiques des patients infectés par le VIH-1 en deuxième ligne de traitement antirétroviral, avec une virémie persistante de bas niveau. Il s’agissait d’une étude rétrospective à visée descriptive, menée du 1er janvier 2010 au 31 décembre 2016, à partir de la cohorte du service des maladies infectieuses du CHU de Bobo-Dioulasso. Ont été inclus les patients infectés par le VIH-1, en deuxième ligne de traitement ARV stable, ayant une observance ≥ 95 % depuis au moins 12 mois, asymptomatiques, avec une charge virale plasmatique comprise entre 50 et 1 000 copies/ml sur deux prélèvements consécutifs à au moins 3 mois d’intervalle. Sur 244 patients en deuxième ligne de traitement antirétroviral, 79 répondaient à nos critères d’inclusion. L’âge moyen des patients était de 42 ± 10,2 ans. Les femmes (35,8 ans) étaient moins âgées que les hommes (43,8 ans) (p = 0,001). La plupart des patients étaient mariés (48,1 %), parmis lesquels certains vivaient dans des régimes polygames (23,5 %). La majorité des patients (38/79) de l’étude avaient un taux de CD4 ≤ 200 cellules/mm3. La durée médiane du traitement ARV depuis le début de l’histoire thérapeutique était de 4,8 ans (2,5- 11 ans). La charge virale plasmatique supérieure à 10 000 copies/ml au début du traitement (p = 0,003), et la combinaison TDF+FTC+DRV+RTV (p = 0,001) étaient associées à la virémie persistante de bas niveau. La réalisation d’un test génotypique de résistance s’impose pour ces patients afin de mieux adapter le traitement antirétroviral.
This study aimed to use a theoretical approach to understand the determinants of behaviour in patients not home self-administering intravenous antibiotics.
Outpatient care: included patients were attending an outpatient clinic for intravenous antibiotic administration in the northeast of Scotland.
Patients were included if they had received more than 7 days of intravenous antibiotics and were aged 16 years and over. Twenty potential participants were approached, and all agreed to be interviewed. 13 were male with a mean age of 54 years (SD +17.6).
Key behavioural determinants that influenced patients' behaviours relating to self-administration of intravenous antibiotics.
Qualitative, semistructured in-depth interviews were undertaken with a purposive sample of patients. An interview schedule, underpinned by the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), was developed, reviewed for credibility and piloted. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed thematically using the TDF as the coding framework.
The key behavioural determinants emerging as encouraging patients to self-administer intravenous antibiotics were the perceptions of being sufficiently knowledgeable, skilful and competent and that self-administration afforded the potential to work while administering treatment. The key determinants that impacted their decision not to self-administer were lack of knowledge of available options, a perception that hospital staff are better trained and anxieties of potential complications.
Though patients are appreciative of the skills and knowledge of hospital staff, there is also a willingness among patients to home self-administer antibiotics. However, the main barrier emerges to be a perceived lack of knowledge of ways of doing this at home. To overcome this, a number of interventions are suggested based on evidence-based behavioural change techniques.
Recent studies have suggested a potential increase in the incidence of osteoporosis for patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), but this issue remains controversial.
The retrospective cohort study of 1224 Asian chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients greater than 18 years without baseline osteopenia/osteoporosis seen at four US centers from 2008 to 2016. Patients were categorized into three groups-treatment-naive patients who initiated therapy with TDF (1) or entecavir (ETV) (2), or untreated patients (3). Patients were followed until the development of osteopenia/osteoporosis or end of the study.
Of the 1224 study patients, 276 were treated with TDF, 335 with ETV, and 613 were untreated. The prevalence of cirrhosis was lower for untreated patients (2.6% vs 16.3% for TDF and 17.6% for ETV; P &lt; 0.001). The 8-year cumulative incidence rate of osteopenia/osteoporosis was 13.17% for TDF, 15.09% for ETV, and 10.17% for untreated patients, with no statistically significant difference among the three groups ( P = 0.218). On multivariate Cox regression controlling for demographics, osteoporosis risk factors, albumin, and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels, neither TDF (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.34 and 1.59) nor ETV (adjusted HR = 0.98; 95% CI: 0.51 and 1.90) were associated with increased osteopenia/osteoporosis risk compared with untreated patients.
Our retrospective study suggests that there is no significant increase in the incidence of osteopenia/osteoporosis for patients with CHB treated with TDF or ETV during a median follow-up of about 4 to 5 years. However, further study with longer follow-up is needed as an anti-HBV therapy, which is often lifelong or long-term and the development of osteopenia/osteoporosis can be a slow process.
Persistence on preexposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention (PrEP) medication has rarely been reported for periods greater than one year, or in real-world settings. This study used pharmacy fill records for PrEP users from a national chain pharmacy to describe persistence on PrEP medication over a two-year period, and to explore correlates with PrEP medication persistence in a real-world setting.
We analysed de-identified pharmacy fill records of 7148 eligible individuals who initiated PrEP in 2015 at a national chain pharmacy. A standard algorithm was employed to identify TDF-FTC use for PrEP indication. We considered three time periods for persistence, defined as maintaining refills in PrEP care: year 1 (zero to twelve months), year 2 (thirteen to twenty-four months) and initiation to year 2 (zero to twenty-four months). Individuals with 16 or more days of TDF-FTC PrEP dispensed in a 1-month period for at least three-quarters of a given time period (e.g. nine of twelve months or eighteen of twenty-four months) were classified as persistent on PrEP medication for the period.
Persistence was 56% in year 1, 63% in year 2 and 41% from initiation to year 2. Individuals aged 18 to 24 had the lowest persistence, with 29% from initiation to year 2. Men had higher persistence than women, with 42% compared to 20% persistent from initiation to year 2. Individuals with commercial insurance and individuals who utilized a community-based specialty pharmacy from the national chain also had higher persistence. Male gender, age &gt;18 to 24 years, average monthly copay of $20 or less, commercial insurance, and utilization of a community-based specialty pharmacy were positively associated in adjusted models with persistence in year 1 and from initiation to year 2; the same correlates, with the exception of utilization of a community-based specialty pharmacy, were associated with higher persistence in year 2.
We found substantial non-persistence on PrEP medication in both year 1 and year 2. Across the entire 2-year period, only two out of every five users persisted on PrEP. Demographic, financial and pharmacy factors were associated with persistence. Further research is needed to explore how social, structural or individual factors may undermine or enhance persistence on PrEP, and to develop interventions to assist persistence on PrEP.
Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in preventing HIV acquisition among men who have sex with men (MSM). However, limited research has examined initiation and adherence to PrEP among Black MSM (BMSM) in the United States (US) who are disproportionately represented among newly HIV infected and late to care individuals. This research reports on the HIV Prevention Trials Network 073 (HPTN 073) study aimed to examine PrEP initiation, utilization and adherence among Black MSM utilizing the theoretically principled, culturally informed and client-centered care coordination (C4) model.
The HPTN 073 study enrolled and followed 226 HIV-uninfected Black MSM in three US cities (Los Angeles, CA; Washington DC; and Chapel Hill, NC) from February 2013 through September 2015. Study participants were offered once daily oral emtricitabine/tenofovir (FTC/TDF) PrEP combined with C4 and followed up for 52 weeks. Participants received HIV testing, risk reduction education and clinical monitoring.
Of the 226 men enrolled, 178 participants initiated PrEP (79%), and of these 64% demonstrated PrEP utilization at week 26 (mid-point of the study) based on pharmacokinetic testing. Condomless anal sex with an HIV-infected or unknown status casual male partner was statistically significantly associated with a greater likelihood of PrEP initiation (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 4.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7, 11.7). Greater age (≥25 vs. &lt;25, OR 2.95, 95% CI 1.37 -6.37), perception of having enough money (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.7 to 7.7) and knowledge of male partner taking PrEP before sex (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.03 to 4.79) were statistically significantly associated with increased likelihood of PrEP adherence at week 26. Annualized HIV incidence was 2.9 (95% CI 1.2 to 7.9) among those who initiated PrEP, compared to 7.7 (95% CI 2.5 to 24.1) among those who did not initiate PrEP (p = 0.18).
Results suggest a high level of PrEP initiation among at-risk Black MSM, a group historically characterized as hard to reach. The data support the importance of addressing contextual factors that affect PrEP initiation and adherence, and of additional research on the ultimate benefit of PrEP in HIV prevention among Black MSM.
People with bipolar disorder require long-term treatment but it is estimated that 40% of these people do not adhere to prescribed medication regimens. Non-adherence increases the risk of relapse, hospitalisation and suicide. Some evidence syntheses report barriers to mental health treatment adherence but rarely delineate between modifiable and non-modifiable barriers. They also fail to distinguish between the patients' perspective and that of other stakeholders such as clinicians despite of their different understanding and priorities about adherence. Facilitators of adherence, which are also important for informing adherence intervention design, are also lacking from syntheses and few syntheses focus on medications for bipolar disorder.This systematic review aims to identify modifiable barriers and facilitators (determinants) of medication adherence in bipolar disorder. We also plan to report determinants of medication adherence from perspectives of patients, carers, healthcare professionals and other third parties. A unique feature of this systematic review in the context of mental health is the use of the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to organise the literature identified determinants of medication adherence.
The protocol adheres to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols and ENhancing Transparency in REporting the synthesis of Qualitative research (ENTREQ) guidelines. This review will include both qualitative and quantitative primary studies exploring determinants of medication adherence in bipolar disorder. We will search the following databases using a preplanned strategy: CINAHL, Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), Embase, LiLACS, Medline, PsychINFO, PubMed without date restrictions. We will report the quality of included studies. We will use framework synthesis using the TDF as an a priori 'framework'. We will map the literature identified modifiable determinants to the domains of TDF.
Ethical approval is not required as primary data will not be collected. The results will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed publication.

To investigate the impact of switching from stable Combined Antiretroviral Therapy (cART) to single-tablet regimen (RPV/FTC/TDF=EVIPLERA® /COMPLERA®) on patient- reported outcomes in HIV-infected adults who cannot tolerate previous cART, in a real-world setting.
PRO-STR is a 48-week observational, prospective, multicenter study. Presence and magnitude of symptoms (main endpoint), health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL), adherence, satisfaction with treatment and patient preferences were assessed.
Three hundred patients with 48-week follow-up, who switched to EVIPLERA® (mean age: 46.6 years; male: 74.0%; 74.7% switched from a non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase-inhibitor, 25.3% from a protease inhibitor + ritonavir) were included. There was no statistical difference in median CD4+ cell count (baseline: 678.5 cells/mm3; 48-week: 683.0 cells/mm3) neither in virological suppression (≤50 copies/mL) (baseline: 98.3%; 48-week: 95.3%). The most frequent reasons for switching were neuropsychiatric (62.3%), gastrointestinal (19.3%) and biochemical/metabolic (19.3%) events. Only 7.7% of patients permanently discontinued therapy. At 48-week, all outcomes showed an improvement compared to baseline. Overall, there was a significant decrease (pvalue≤ 0.05) in number and magnitude of symptoms, while HRQoL, satisfaction and adherence improved significantly. Most patients prefered EVIPLERA® than previous cART. According to the type of intolerance, HRQoL was improved, but only significantly in patients with neuropsychiatric and gastrointestinal symptoms. Adherence improved significantly in patients with metabolic disturbances and satisfaction with EVIPLERA® was higher in the three groups.
Switching to EVIPLERA® from non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase-inhibitor or protease inhibitor-based regimens due to toxicity, improved the presence/magnitude of symptoms, HRQoL, and preference with treatment. EVIPLERA® maintained a virological response, CD4+ cell count and maintained or improved adherence.
We compared time to treatment change (TC), viral suppression (VS) and change in CD4+ T-cell counts of first-line antiretroviral regimens (ART).
We analyzed HIV treatment-naïve adults from the Cohort of the Spanish HIV/AIDS Research Network (CoRIS) initiating the most commonly used ART regimens from September 2014 to November 2015. We used proportional hazards models on the sub-distribution hazard to estimate sub-distribution hazard ratios (sHR) for time to TC, logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for VS (viral load&lt;50 copies/ml), and linear regression to assess mean differences in CD4 changes from ART initiation.
Among 960 individuals, tenofovir (TDF)/emtricitabine (FTC)/rilpivirine (RPV) was the most frequently prescribed regimen (24.2%), followed by elvitegravir (EVG)/cobicistat (COBI)/TDF/FTC (22.8%), abacavir (ABC)/lamivudine (3TC)/dolutegavir (DTG) (17.4%), TDF/FTC+darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) or darunavir/cobicistat (DRV/c) (12.1%), TDF/FTC/efavirenz (EFV) (8.8%), TDF/FTC+raltegravir (RAL) (7.7%) and TDF/FTC+DTG (7.0%). Initiating ART with TDF/FTC+DRV/r or DRV/c (adjusted sHR: 2.96; 95% CI: 1.44 - 6.08), TDF/FTC/EFV (2.18; 0.98 - 4.82), TDF/FTC+RAL (2.37; 1.08 - 5.22) and TDF/FTC+DTG (6.34; 3.18 - 12.64) was associated with a higher risk of TC compared to ABC/3TC/DTG. At 24 weeks, VS was lower in TDF/FTC+DRV/r or DRV/c (adjusted OR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.18; 0.74) compared to ABC/3TC/DTG, and CD4increase was lower in patients initiating with TDF/FTC/RPV (adjusted mean difference: -75.9, 95% CI: -130.6; -21.2) compared to those who did with ABC/3TC/DTG.
Time to TC, VS and change in CD4+ T-cell counts varies by initial regimen. These differences may be useful for making decision when initiating ART.
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of 144-week tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) therapy in treatment-naïve chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients in Korean.
In total, 579 treatment-naïve CHB patients at 11 medical centers were enrolled retrospective and prospective from September 2015 to January 2016 by design (NCT02533544). We evaluated the complete virologic response (CVR) rate and the renal safety of TDF.
The overall CVR rate was 69.4%, 87.0%, and 89.7% at weeks 48, 96, and 144, respectively. In the HBeAg-positive CHB patients, the CVR rate at weeks 48, 96, and 144 was 61.4%, 83.1%, and 89.6%, respectively. The rates of HBeAg loss and seroconversion at weeks 48, 96, and 144 were 16.6%, 23.5%, 34.1%, and 7.6%, 8.9%, 13.3%, respectively. In HBeAg-negative CHB patients, the CVR rate at weeks 48, 96, and 144 was 82.5%, 93.2%, and 90.0%, respectively. The rate of alanine aminotransferase normalization was 36.9%, 45.4%, and 46.8% at weeks 48, 96, and 144, respectively. Of the CHB patients, 0.9% showed an elevated creatinine (&gt; 0.5 mg/dL from baseline). Age (≥ 60 years) was significantly associated with a decline in renal function at week 144 (P &lt; 0.0001). Comorbidities (diabetes or hypertension) showed the tendency to reduce renal function (P = 0.0624). Hepatocellular carcinoma developed in 10 (1.7%) patients and was related to cirrhosis.
TDF therapy induced sustained viral suppression and had a favorable safety profile over a 3-year period. However, close monitoring of renal function should be mandatory in treating CHB patients receiving TDF, particularly older patients.
To determine the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and their association with antiretroviral therapy (ART) among HIV-infected adults in a rural sub-county hospital in Kenya.
This was a descriptive survey of patient charts characterising cardiovascular risk among adult patients (&gt; 18 years) at Ukwala sub-county hospital between June 2013 and January 2015. Post-stratification survey weights were applied to obtain prevalence levels. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) for each variable related to cardiovascular risk factors were calculated using logistic regression models.
Overall, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus was 0.4%, 0.3% of patients had had a previous cardiovascular event (heart attack or stroke), 40.4% had pre-hypertension, while 10.4% had stage 1 and 2.9% stage 2 hypertension. Up to 14% of patients had elevated non-fasting total cholesterol levels. Factors associated with hypertension were male gender (AOR 1.59, p = 0.0001), being over 40 years of age (AOR 1.78, p = 0.0001) and having an increased waist circumference (OR 2.56, p = 0.0014). Raised total cholesterol was more likely in those on tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) (AOR 2.2, p = 0.0042), azidothymidine (AZT) (AOR 2.5, p = 0.0004) and stavudine (D4T) -containing regimens (AOR 3.13, p = 0.0002).
An elevated prevalence of undiagnosed cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and raised total cholesterol levels was found among people living with HIV. There was an association between raised total cholesterol and nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) -based ART regimens. Our findings provide further rationale for integrating routine cardiovascular risk-factor screening into HIV-care services.
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is active against both HBV and HIV. Whether the introduction of TDF-containing combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has improved the outcome of HIV/HBV-coinfected patients remains unclear in areas of higher HBV endemicity.
We retrospectively reviewed medical records of newly diagnosed antiretroviral-naïve HIV-infected patients between 2007 and 2015. Four groups of patients were defined, according to the HBV status and availability of TDF for HIV treatment in Taiwan in 2011. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality.
During the 9-year study period, 1,723 HIV-infected patients were included, with a median age of 31 years and baseline CD4 count of 273 cells per μL. The HBV seroprevalence had declined from 18.1% (125/692) in the pre-TDF era to 10.1% (104/1031) in the post-TDF era. The respective mortality rate for HIV/HBV-coinfected and HIV-monoinfected patients in the pre-TDF era was 23.2 (95% CI, 12.5-43.1) and 9.6 (95% CI, 6.1-15.0) deaths per 1000 person-years of follow-up [PYFU], and the respective mortality rate in the post-TDF era was 15.7 (95% CI, 7.0-34.8) and 8.0 (95% CI, 5.5-11.6) deaths per 1000 PYFU. The adjusted hazard ratio for mortality in multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis among HIV/HBV-coinfected patients compared to HIV-monoinfected patients was 2.79 (95% CI, 1.25-6.22) in pre-TDF era and 1.11 (95% CI, 0.45-2.72) in post-TDF era.
In this country of high HBV endemicity, the adverse impact of chronic HBV infection on the survival observed in the pre-TDF era has significantly diminished among HIV/HBV-coinfected patients compared to HIV-monoinfected patients in the era of TDF-containing cART.
Provision of oral health care (OHC), including oral hygiene (OH) or oral/dental treatment, to dependent older people (DOP) is frequently insufficient. We aimed to assess barriers and facilitators perceived by different healthcare professionals towards providing OHC to DOP.
A systematic review was performed. Studies reporting on knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs acting as barriers and facilitators for provision of OHC were included. One database (PubMed) was searched and data extraction independently performed by two reviewers. Thematic analysis was used and identified themes translated to the domains and constructs of the theoretical domains framework (TDF) and aligned with the domains of the behavior change wheel (BCW). Analyses were stratified for the two target behaviors (providing oral hygiene and providing oral/dental treatment) and according to different stakeholders' perspective. For quantitative analysis, frequency effect sizes (FES) were calculated.
In total, 1621 articles were identified and 41 (32 quantitative, 7 qualitative, 2 mixed method) studies included. Within these 41 studies, there were 7333 participants (4367 formal caregivers, 67 informal caregivers, 1100 managers of care, 1322 dentists, 340 DOP). Main barriers for providing OH were "lack of knowledge" (FES 65%, COM-B domain: capability, TDF domain: knowledge) and "patients refusing care" (62%, opportunity, environmental context and resources). Main facilitators were "OHC training/education" (41%, capability, skills) and "presence of a dental professional" (21%, opportunity, environmental context and resources). Main barriers for provision of dental treatment were "lack of suitable facilities for treatment/transportation of patients" (76%) and "patients refusing care" (53%) (both: opportunity, environmental context and resources). Main facilitators were "regular visiting dentist" (35%) and "routine assessment/increased awareness by staff" (35%) (both: opportunity, environmental context and resources).
A number of barriers and facilitators for providing different aspects of OHC were identified for different stakeholders.
Our findings help provide the evidence to develop implementation strategies for providing high-quality systematic OHC to DOP.

Antiretrovirals with long half-lives, such as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) and efavirenz (EFV), are suitable for reduced frequency dosing, with potential for improved adherence and reduced toxicity and costs. The objective of this study was to investigate the noninferiority of the TDF/FTC/EFV fixed-dose combination on alternate-days versus standard regimen in virologically suppressed patients.
A randomized-controlled open-label noninferiority trial enrolling HIV-1-infected patients treated for at least 6 months with TDF/FTC/EFV fixed-dose combination, virologically suppressed (&lt;40 HIV-RNA copies/ml) with EFV plasma concentrations greater than 1000 ng/ml, were randomized to maintain TDF/FTC/EFV standard-of-care regimen (SOC, Arm A) or to switch to TDF/FTC/EFV on AlTernAte Days (ATAD, Arm B).
Primary end-point was the proportion of patients with less than 40 HIV-RNA copies/ml at week 48.
One hundred and ninety-seven patients were randomized (98 in the SOC and 99 in the ATAD arm). One hundred and seventy-nine (90.3%) were men, median age 43.2 years, 133 (67.5%) MSM. CD4 T-cell count at baseline was 706 cells/μl in SOC and 632 cells/μl in ATAD arm. At week 48, 95 (96.9%) patients in SOC and 93 (93.9%) in ATAD had a virological response (-3.0% overall risk difference, 95% CI: -8.86%/2.86%). Median change from baseline at week 48 in CD4 T-cell count was 29.4 cells/μl (95% CI: 2.5/56.4) in SOC (P = 0.008) and 61.0 cells/μl (95% CI: 32.1/89.9) in ATAD (P &lt; 0.001). Median change of EFV concentration at week 48 from baseline was -6.5 ng/ml (95% CI: -103/55) in SOC (P = 0.877) and -1124 ng/ml (95% CI: -1375/-928) in ATAD arm (P &lt; 0.001).
Despite a significant decrease of EFV exposure, TDF/FTC/EFV on ATAD was noninferior to SOC regimen through 48 weeks.
HIV with HBV co-infection can result in greater HIV-related immunosuppression, morbidity and mortality. Currently, there are few studies to evaluate direct treatment effects on mortality and attrition rates between first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) based-on tenofovir (TDF) and/or lamivudine (3TC) in a real-world setting. We used Cox proportional hazard models to evaluate direct treatment effects of the first-line ART containing stavudine (d4T), azidothymidine (AZT) and TDF on death and attrition among HIV patients with HBV coinfection. A total of 3912 patients met study eligibility criteria. The overall mortality rate and attrition rate was 2.85 (95% CI: 2.55-3.16) and 8.87 (95% CI: 8.32-9.41) per 100 person-years, respectively. The ART containing TDF had a significantly lower risk of death [adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.44-0.77] when compared to the ART containing d4T, but the risk of death was not significantly different when compared to the ART containing AZT (AHR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.69-1.20). Patients with HIV/HBV coinfection receiving the ART containing TDF had significantly lower risk rates of attrition compared to those receiving the ART containing d4T (AHR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.60-0.86) or AZT (AHR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.58-0.77). Compared with the ART containing d4T, the ART containing AZT was significant and not significant associated with a lower risk of death and attrition, respectively. The ART containing TDF had significant effects on both of death and attrition among HIV patients with HBV coinfection.
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can act as scaffolds that promote the interaction of proteins, RNA, and DNA. There is increasing evidence of sequence-specific interactions of lncRNAs with DNA via triple-helix (triplex) formation. This process allows lncRNAs to recruit protein complexes to specific genomic regions and regulate gene expression. Here we propose a computational method called Triplex Domain Finder (TDF) to detect triplexes and characterize DNA-binding domains and DNA targets statistically. Case studies showed that this approach can detect the known domains of lncRNAs Fendrr, HOTAIR and MEG3. Moreover, we validated a novel DNA-binding domain in MEG3 by a genome-wide sequencing method. We used TDF to perform a systematic analysis of the triplex-forming potential of lncRNAs relevant to human cardiac differentiation. We demonstrated that the lncRNA with the highest triplex-forming potential, GATA6-AS, forms triple helices in the promoter of genes relevant to cardiac development. Moreover, down-regulation of GATA6-AS impairs GATA6 expression and cardiac development. These data indicate the unique ability of our computational tool to identify novel triplex-forming lncRNAs and their target genes.
Concomitant dosing of ledipasvir (LDV) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) results in an increased tenofovir (TFV) area under the curve (AUC). The aim of this study was to examine whether there was a correlation between the renal biomarkers retinol binding protein-4 (RBP-4) and β2 microglobulin (β2M) and tenofovir AUC.
The ION-4 trial enrolled HIV/hepatitis C virus-coinfected patients on nonpharmacologically boosted antiretroviral regimens with TDF-containing backbones. We assessed for a correlation between tenofovir AUC and urinary biomarkers and also for changes in serologic biomarkers with respect to clinically relevant changes in renal function (creatinine clearance decrease &gt;25%, change in creatinine &gt;0.2 mg/dL, change in proteinuria from negative/trace to ≥1+).
Three hundred thirty-five patients were enrolled in the ION-4 study; their demographic characteristics have been previously described. Both RBP-4 and β2M exhibited positive correlations with tenofovir AUC. Baseline and study levels of RBP-4 and β2M were higher for patients with increases in urine proteinuria and an absolute creatinine increase.
TFV exposure is associated with increased proximal tubule urine biomarkers in participants on ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and nonpharmacologically boosted TDF-based antiretroviral regimens. Baseline proximal tubule biomarkers may predict nephrotoxicity risk if events are prevalent. Further studies assessing the predictive role of these urine biomarkers may help guide medical decision-making and risk/benefit assessments in patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction.
Accurate assessment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients receiving entecavir (ETV)/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is likely to play a pivotal role in post-treatment follow-up strategy. We aimed to develop a simple and reliable predictive model for HCC risk in these patients.
A database of 1242 consecutive treatment-naive CHB patients who initially underwent ETV/TDF between February 2007 and January 2017 at four referral hospitals in South Korea was analyzed. The HCC risk model was constructed on the basis of a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model in the derivation dataset (n=944) and was validated using Harrell's C-statistic in a validation dataset (n=298).
The 3/5-year cumulative incidence rates of HCC were 3.9/6.5 and 4.2/11.6% in the derivation and the validation dataset, respectively (P=0.08). In the derivation dataset, we identified four factors associated with HCC, namely, age, albumin, sex, and liver cirrhosis. The AASL (age, albumin, sex, liver cirrhosis)-HCC scoring system was developed on the basis of these factors, and simplified to an integer scoring system. AASL-HCC scores were found to have high discriminating performance for the prediction of HCC development at 5 years in the derivation (C-statistics=0.802, 95% confidence interval: 0.716-0.888) and validation dataset (C-statistics=0.805, 95% confidence interval: 0.671-0.939). When AASL-HCC scores were classified as 5 or less, 6-19, and at least 20 (low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups, respectively), the 5-year cumulative incidence rates of HCC were 0, 4.2, and 17.6%, respectively, in the derivation dataset.
The AASL-HCC model was simple and reliable for HCC risk prediction in treatment-naive CHB patients receiving ETV/TDF, and is easily applicable in the clinical setting.
Digital pills, gelatin capsules with radiofrequency transmitters activated by stomach chloride ions, directly measure antiretroviral therapy adherence. In individuals with substance use disorders and HIV, real-time nonadherence detected by digital pills creates a platform to deliver substance use and adherence interventions. In this study, we determined the bioequivalence of tenofovir (TFV), administered as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) in healthy human volunteers administered a commercial drug product and a digital pill formulation. We adhered generally to the US FDA Analytical Procedures and Methods for Validation for Drugs and Biologics guidelines. Ten HIV-uninfected adults without reported allergy to TFV, emtricitabine, or rilpivirine were enrolled. Participants ingested a digital pill containing TDF/emtricitabine/rilpivirine. Peripheral venous blood samples were collected at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h postingestion. After a 14-day washout period, the same participants ingested Complera™. Serial venous blood samples were collected using the same protocol as the digital pill. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry was used to determine a maximum concentration (Cmax), area under curve from time zero to last measured concentration (AUCo-t), and area under curve from time zero to infinity (AUCoo) of TFV. Ten participants with an average age of 27 and body mass index of 25.4 successfully completed the study. Predose TFV was undetectable before the second administration of Complera confirming adequate washout period after ingestion of the digital pill. The geometric means of AUCo-t, AUCoo, and Cmax for test and reference products were within the 95% confidence intervals and, therefore, bioequivalent. TFV overencapsulated in digital pills are bioequivalent to TFV in commercial formulations.
Since 2016, French guidelines have recommended the single-tablet regimen of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/emtricitabine (FTC)/rilpivirine (RPV) as HIV post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), but few data support this usage. We evaluated the tolerability, treatment completion and occurrence of HIV seroconversion associated with this combination in occupational and non-occupational PEP.
We conducted an observational, prospective, multicentre, open-label, non-randomized study in five French HIV centres. Adults requiring PEP according to national French guidelines were prescribed TDF/FTC/RPV one pill once a day for 28 days. Clinical and biological tolerability was assessed at week 4; occurrence of HIV seroconversion was evaluated after week 16.
From March 2016 to March 2017, 163 courses of PEP were prescribed for 150 sexual exposures (44% heterosexual and 56% MSM) and 13 non-sexual exposures. Five participants stopped PEP after a few days because the source person was HIV uninfected. Of the remaining 158 individuals, 15 (9.5%) were lost to follow-up at week 4, 7 (4.4%) prematurely discontinued PEP [patient's decision/non-adherence (n = 3) or adverse events (gastrointestinal intolerance n = 3, fatigue n = 1)] and 136 (86.1%) completed the 28 day treatment. Overall, 69.6% of participants declared at least one adverse event, mostly of mild to moderate intensity and no serious adverse events or hepatic or renal toxicity occurred. No HIV seroconversion occurred at week 16.
The low rate of premature treatment interruption, the good tolerability and the absence of documented HIV seroconversion support the current French guidelines of a 28 day course of TDF/FTC/RPV for sexual and non-sexual PEP.
Comparison of changes in body composition, adipokines and inflammatory markers after initial therapy with a nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (N(t)RTI)- sparing or containing regimen are scarce.
Randomised Clinical Trial.
This is the body composition substudy of NEAT 001/ANRS 143, a randomised trial comparing darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) plus either raltegravir (RAL) or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) in 805 ART naïve HIV-infected adults. The primary endpoint was percentage change in limb fat at week 96. Secondary endpoints were associations among these changes and metabolic markers (IL-6, insulin, leptin, adiponectin, FGF-23).
126 subjects (61 DRV/r + RAL and 65 DRV/r + TDF/FTC) were included. The rate of change in BMI between groups for RAL versus TDF/FTC at week 96 was 1.5% per 48-week period (p = 0.015). The rate of change in limb fat mass, trunk fat mass, total body fat and total lean mass was for RAL versus TDF/FTC at week 96 was 2.5% (p = 0.38), 7.3% ((p = 0.021), 4.9% (p = 0.061) and 1.3% (p = 0.12) respectively. Baseline insulin and leptin levels were correlated with baseline limb fat and trunk fat mass [r = 0.31 (p = 0.0043)/r = 0.28 (p = 0.0011) for limb fat, and r = 0.63 (p&lt;0.0001)/r = 0.50(p&lt;0.0001) for trunk fat]. After adjustment, a 10% faster increase in leptin between baseline and week 48 was associated with a more rapid increase in limb fat at week 48 (0.5% per 48 weeks, p&lt;0.001), total body fat mass (0.6% per 48 weeks, p&lt;0.001), and trunk fat mass (0.3% per 48 weeks, p = 0.0026).
After week 96 a N(t)RTI sparing regimen of DRV/r + RAL produced a numerically greater percentage increase in body composition variables with only change in trunk fat mass and BMI being significant.
Higher levels of parathyroid hormone have been associated with the use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) in people with and without HIV infection. Yet, alterations in calcium levels have never been elucidated in detail.
To compare the association of parathyroid hormone with serum calcium levels and other markers of calcium and bone metabolism in people living with HIV on TDF- and non-TDF-containing antiretroviral therapy.
A retrospective single center cohort study in Munich, Germany. Median and interquartile ranges and absolute and relative frequencies were used to describe continuous and categorical variables, respectively. The Mann-Whitney U test and chi2-test were used for comparisons. Multivariate median regression was performed in a stepwise backward approach.
1,002 patients were included (786 (78.4%) male; median age 48 (40-55) years). 564 patients (56.3%) had a TDF-containing ART regimen. PTH concentrations were 46.9 (33.0-64.7) pg/mL and 35.2 (26.4-55.4) pg/mL (P=0.001), 43.3 (30.8-59.8) pg/mL and 31.8 (22.3-49.6) pg/mL (P &lt; 0.001), 46.1 (29.5-65.4) pg/mL and 33.4 (22.6-50.1) pg/mL (P &lt; 0.001), and 37.8 (25.3-57.9) pg/mL and 33.8 (20.1-45.3) pg/mL (P=0.012) within the first, second, third, and fourth quartile of corrected calcium levels for patients with and without TDF-containing ART, respectively. In multivariate median regression, PTH concentration was significantly associated with Cacorr. (-32.2 (-49.8 to -14.8); P &lt; 0.001), female sex (5.2 (1.2-9.2); P=0.010), 25(OH)D (-0.4 (-0.5 to -0.3); P &lt; 0.001), and TDF-use (9.2 (6.0-12.5); P &lt; 0.001).
Higher levels of PTH seem to be needed to maintain normal calcium levels in PLWH on TDF-containing ART compared to non-TDF-containing ART. Optimal concentrations for 25-hydroxy vitamin D and calcium might therefore be different in people using TDF than expected from general populations but also people living with HIV with non-TDF-containing antiretroviral therapy. This might require different supplementation strategies but warrants further investigation.
The aim of this study was to identify modifications in the feeding behaviour of goats browsing a tropical deciduous forest (TDF) when natural gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) infection was suppressed. Continuous bite monitoring through direct observation was implemented in 12 Criollo goats (adults, non-pregnant) foraging for 4 h per day during the rainy season. In the first Period (P1, one observation point) all goats were maintained with natural GIN infection. In the second Period (P2, three observation points), goats were equally distributed into 2 groups: i) moxidectin treated group (TG) used in a suppressive scheme; and ii) naturally infected group (IG). For each observation point, goats were monitored at three timepoints per day (80 min each), for three consecutive days, to estimate their intake of dry matter (DM), condensed tannins (CT), crude protein, metabolizable energy and digestible DM. Live weight (LW), faecal samples and blood samples were obtained every 28 days to determine LW change, faecal egg counts (FEC) and packed cell volume (PCV). During P1 and P2, the TG and IG had similar LW change and PCV. During both periods, the intake of DM, CT and all macronutrients were similar for TG and IG. The suppression of GIN infection did not modify the feeding behaviour of goats. Therefore, a therapeutic self-medicative behaviour was not identified in Criollo goats browsing a TDF.
In the present study, the efficacy and safety of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) switch therapy were assessed in patients with chronic hepatitis B exhibiting a suboptimal response to adefovir (ADV)-based combination therapy. First, the efficacy of the TDF switch therapy was retrospectively evaluated in 50 patients with chronic hepatitis B who failed to respond to ADV-based combination treatment. Among those, 48 patients with a median age of 35 years were hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive and 17, 14 and 19 patients were previously treated with lamivudine (LAM) plus ADV, telbivudine plus ADV and entecavir (ETV) plus ADV, respectively. A total of 41 patients were treated with TDF alone and 9 with TDF plus ETV. The median time of follow-up was 102 weeks. The primary end-point was the cumulative probability of achieving a complete virologic response (CVR). The secondary end-points were the rate of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalization, HBeAg seroconversion in HBeAg-positive patients, and the plasma levels of creatinine and creatine kinase. The mean serum hepatitis B virus DNA levels prior to initiation of the TDF switch therapy were 4.8±1.6 log10IU/ml. The cumulative probability of achieving a VR at 24, 48, 96 and 108 weeks was 52.0, 76.0, 89.8 and 94.9%, respectively. The cumulative probability of normalization of ALT at 12, 24, 36, 48, 60,72, 84, 96, 108, 120 and 132 weeks was 34, 44, 50, 58, 66, 70, 74, 80, 90, 92 and 94%, respectively. HBeAg seroconversion was achieved in 5 patients. During the follow-up, 6 patients suffered from a virologic breakthrough, 3 patients failed to respond to the TDF treatment and the remaining patients were able to obtain VR following the continuation of TDF treatment. Slightly elevated serum levels of creatinine were observed in one patient, whereas creatine kinase activity did not increase in any of the subjects. In conclusion, TDF switch therapy is efficient and safe for patients with chronic hepatitis B with a suboptimal response to ADV-based combination therapy.
There are growing concerns of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)-associated renal toxicity. We evaluated the effect of long-term TDF exposure on renal function in a cohort of HIV-1-infected Nigerians between 2006 and 2015. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of renal impairment at different time over 144 weeks of antiretroviral therapy (ART).
Data of 4897 patients, median age 42 years (interquartile range: 36-49), and 61% females were analyzed. The prevalence of renal impairment increased from 10% at week 24 to 45% at 144 weeks in TDF-exposed participants compared to an increase from 8% at 24 weeks to 14% at 144 weeks in TDF-unexposed participants. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate exposure predicted the risk of renal impairment at 144 weeks of ART (odds ratio: 2.36; 95% confidence interval: 1.28-4.34).
Long-term exposure to TDF-based ART significantly increases the likelihood of renal impairment. The continued use of TDF-based regimen in our setting should be reviewed. We recommend the urgent introduction of tenofovir alafenamide-based regimen in the HIV treatment guidelines of Nigeria and other resource-limited countries.
Our understanding of HIV-1 and antiretroviral treatment (ART) is strongly biased towards subtype B, the predominant subtype in North America and western Europe. Efforts to characterize the response to first-line treatments in other HIV-1 subtypes have been hindered by the availability of large study cohorts in resource-limited settings. To maximize our statistical power, we combined HIV-1 sequence and clinical data from every available study population associated with the Joint Clinical Research Centre (JCRC) in Uganda. These records were combined with contemporaneous ART-naive records from Uganda in the Stanford HIVdb database.
Treatment failures were defined by the presence of HIV genotype records with sample collection dates after the ART start dates in the JCRC database. Drug resistances were predicted by the Stanford HIVdb algorithm, and HIV subtype classification and recombination detection was performed with SCUEAL. We used Bayesian network analysis to evaluate associations between drug exposures and subtypes, and binomial regression for associations with recombination.
This is the largest database of first-line treatment failures ([Formula: see text]) in Uganda to date, with a predicted statistical power of 80% to detect subtype associations at an odds ratio of [Formula: see text]. In the subset where drug regimen data were available, we observed that use of 3TC was associated with a higher rate of first line treatment failure, whereas regimens containing AZT and TDF were associated with reduced rates of failure. In the complete database, we found limited evidence of associations between HIV-1 subtypes and treatment failure, with the exception of a significantly lower frequency of failures among A/D recombinants that comprised about 7% of the population. First-line treatment failure was significantly associated with reduced numbers of recombination breakpoints across subtypes.
Expanding access to first-line ART should confer the anticipated public health benefits in Uganda, despite known differences in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 subtypes. Furthermore, the impact of ART may actually be enhanced by frequent inter-subtype recombination in this region.
Objective: To observe the efficacy and safety related measures by blocking mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus with high viral load and HBeAg positivity during pregnancy in Guizhou province. Methods: Outpatient and inpatient cases of the Department of Infectious Diseases and Obstetrics of Guizhou Medical University Affiliated Hospitals from May 2016 to July 2017 were retrospectively divided into intervention group, non-intervention group and non- hepatitis B pregnant women group; with 75 cases in each group. HBsAg and HBeAg were positive in the intervention group. Pregnant women with HBV DNA ≥10(6) IU/ml were treated with anti-HBV therapy for 24 to 28 weeks of gestation until delivery. According to oral drugs, they were divided into tenofovir (TDF) group or telbivudine (LDT) group, non-intervention group (HBsAg and HBeAg positive), HBV DNA positive pregnant women, pregnant women with no anti-HBV drugs, non-hepatitis B pregnant women (normal pregnant women without HBV infection). Infants and young children born to the three groups of women were immunized with the national viral hepatitis B action plan. The gestational weeks and Apgar scores at birth, delivery mode, feeding mode, sex and 7-months-old age were observed and counted. Serum hepatitis B markers (HBVM) and HBV DNA were quantitatively detected. HBVM was detected by time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay (TRFIA), and HBV DNA was detected by real-time PCR (FQ-PCR). The changes of liver parameters, HBsAg, HBeAg, HBV DNA, adverse drug reactions and treatment response of pregnant intervention group before medication (12-24 weeks of gestation), 4 weeks of medication (28-32 weeks of gestation), 36-40 weeks of gestation (36-40 weeks of gestation) were statistically calculated. A t-test was used to compare the data between the measurements. Data measurements within the groups were analyzed using rank -sum test. Results: In the intervention group, therapeutic medications showed no differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between TDF group and LDT group, including liver parameters, HBsAg, HBeAg and log10HBV DNA level. Compared with pre-treatment (TDF group: 4.84 ± 2.01; LDT group: 5.08 ± 1.99), TDF and LDT were significantly lower at the end of pregnancy (TDF group: 3.06 ± 0.66; LDT group: 3.51 ± 1.20). P &lt; 0.05); and the treatment response rate was 100%. There were no serious adverse events in the intervention group. Infants and young children (7-months-old) in the intervention group had negative HBsAg, HBeAg and HBV DNA. The mother-to-child transmission rate of HBV was zero, with blocking rate of 100%. In addition, both infants and young children had different degrees of hepatitis B protective antibodies (anti-HBs, M: 144.33), and their antibody titers were higher than that of non-intervention group (anti-HBs, M: 65.91) and non-hepatitis B pregnant women (anti-HBs, M: 58.43). The difference was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05), and there was no significant correlation between the use of antiviral and the way of delivery and feeding. Outcomes of mother-to-child transmission of HBV infection in infants and young children (7-months-old) delivered by three groups of pregnant women in the non-intervention groups had 20.0% (15/75)/ 17.3% (13/75) HBsAg/HBeAg positivity rate, and 17.3% (13/75) HBV DNA positivity rate. Overall, mother-to-child transmission rate of HBV infection was 20% (15/75). Furthermore, the relationship between mother's HBV DNA load and infant HBV infection in the non-intervention group showed mother's HBV DNA ≥10(6) IU/ml. Conclusion: In the non-intervention group, mother-to-child transmission of HBV occurred, and infected mothers HBV DNA was ≥106 IU/ml before delivery. This suggests that HBeAg positive and high load HBV DNA replication were independent risk factors for mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B. Therefore, prenatal drug intervention and postpartum standard immune blockade are necessary for high-risk pregnant women with hepatitis B to achieve zero mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B in real- clinical practice.
目的： 观察贵州地区HBeAg阳性高载量乙型肝炎孕妇母婴阻断的有效性、安全性及相关母婴结局。方法： 回顾性收集2016年5月至2017年07月感染科、产科的门诊及住院病例，分为干预组、非干预组及非乙型肝炎孕妇组，每组75例。干预组为HBsAg及HBeAg均阳性，HBV DNA≥10(6) IU/ml乙型肝炎孕妇并于孕24～28周开始至分娩前进行抗HBV治疗，根据口服药物又分为：替诺福韦（TDF）组或替比夫定（LDT）组；非干预组为HBsAg及HBeAg均阳性，HBV DNA阳性乙型肝炎孕妇，孕期未用抗HBV药物；非乙型肝炎孕妇为正常未感染HBV孕妇。3组产妇所生婴幼儿均接受国家标准规范的乙型肝炎计划免疫接种，观察及统计出生时所孕孕周，出生时Apgar评分、分娩方式、喂养方式、性别及7个月龄时定量检测血清乙型肝炎标志物（HBVM）及HBV DNA。应用时间分辨荧光免疫定量分析法检测HBVM，荧光定量PCR技术检测HBV DNA；统计孕期干预组在用药前（孕12～24周），用药4周（孕28～32周），分娩前（孕36～40周）肝功能指标、HBsAg、HBeAg、HBV DNA变化及药物不良反应，治疗应答情况。计量资料数据组间比较采用t检验，组内比较采用秩和检验进行统计分析。结果： 干预组治疗用药：TDF组和LDT组在人口统计学和临床特征方面没有差异，包括肝功能检测指标、HBsAg、HBeAg及log(10)HBV DNA水平。log(10)HBV DNA与治疗前（TDF组：4.84 ± 2.01；LDT组：5.08±1.99）相比，TDF与LDT在孕期治疗结束时（TDF组：3.06±0.66；LDT组：3.51±1.20）均显著降低（P &lt; 0.05），治疗应答率100%。干预组服药均未出现严重不良反应。3组孕妇所分娩的婴幼儿HBV母婴传播感染结局：非干预组婴儿7个月龄时检测HBsAg阳性率为20.0%（15/75）,HBeAg阳性率为17.3%（13/75）及HBV DNA阳性率为17.3%（13/75)，其HBV母婴传播感染率为20%（15/75）。进一步分析非干预组婴幼儿HBV感染与母亲HBV DNA载量的关系，发现母婴传播感染者其母亲HBV DNA均≥10(6) IU/ml。干预组婴儿7个月龄时检测HBsAg、HBeAg及HBV DNA均阴性，HBV母婴传播感染率为0，HBV母婴阻断率为100%，而且其婴幼儿均有不同程度的乙型肝炎保护性抗体出现（抗-HBs，均值为144.33 mIU/ml），其抗体滴度高于非干预组及非乙型肝炎孕妇，与非干预组（抗-HBs，均值为65.91 mIU/ml）及非乙型肝炎孕妇（抗-HBs，均值为58.43 mIU/ml）比较，差异有统计学意义（P &lt; 0.05），与抗病毒药及分娩方式及喂养方式之间无明显相关性。结论： 非干预组发生了HBV母婴传播，母婴传播感染者其母亲分娩前HBV DNA均≥10(6) IU/ml. 提示HBeAg阳性，高载量HBV DNA复制是发生乙型肝炎母婴传播的独立危险因素。因此，针对乙型肝炎高危孕妇，需产前药物干预及产后标准联合免疫阻断，才能从真正临床上实现乙型肝炎母婴零传播。.
Current pharmacologic adherence monitoring for antiretrovirals involves expensive, labor-intensive liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based methods. Antibody-based assays can monitor and support adherence in real time. We developed a tenofovir (TFV)-based immunoassay and further validated it in a directly observed therapy (DOT) study.
Pharmacologic DOT study of TFV disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/emtricitabine (FTC) administered to HIV-noninfected volunteers.
The TARGET study provided directly observed TDF 300 mg/FTC 200 mg 7 (high adherence), 4 (moderate), and 2 doses/week (low) to 30 volunteers (10/group) in Thailand, collecting a total of 637 urine samples over 6 weeks of administration and during washout. ELISA measured urine TFV levels by the immunoassay and LC-MS/MS-based concentrations served as the gold standard. A mixed-effects regression model evaluated cutoffs for a point-of-care assay. Performance characteristics of the immunoassay were compared with LC-MS/MS at a chosen cutoff.
Median TFV levels were 12,000 ng/mL by the immunoassay 1 day after dosing; 5000 ng/mL 2 days after dosing; 1500 ng/mL 3 days after dosing; and below the lower limit of quantification thereafter (≥4 days). An immunoassay cutoff of 1500 ng/mL accurately classified 98% of patients who took a dose 24 hours ago as adherent. The specificity and sensitivity of the immunoassay compared with LC-MS/MS at the 1500 ng/mL cutoff were 99% and 94%; the correlation between TFV levels by the 2 assays was high (0.92, P &lt; 0.00001).
We have developed a novel TFV immunoassay that is highly specific, sensitive, and correlates strongly with LC-MS/MS measurements in a large DOT study. Adherence benchmarks from this DOT study will guide the development of a low-cost rapid point-of-care test for pre-exposure prophylaxis and antiretroviral treatment adherence monitoring and interventions.
Incompatibility studies of antiretroviral drugs, viz., lamivudine (3TC), emtricitabine (FTC), abacavir sulfate (ABC), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), zidovudine (ZDV), efavirenz (EFV) and nevirapine (NVP) were carried out in the presence of ten selected excipients, i.e., microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium starch glycolate, croscarmellose sodium, colloidal silica, povidone K-30 and hydroxypropyl cellulose. Among all, ABC showed reaction with lactose monohydrate, resulting in the formation of two interaction products, while sodium lauryl sulphate enhanced the degradation of TDF. The interaction products of ABC-Lactose were separated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and subjected to liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) studies for their characterization. One of the products was also isolated and subjected to 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies for structural confirmation. The toxicity of both was predicted using TOPKAT and ADMET™ software and compared to the drug.
Dual therapy based on dolutegravir and ritonavir-boosted darunavir (DTG/DRV/r) is a combination of well-known drugs with a high genetic barrier to HIV resistance.
A retrospective analysis of all HIV-1 infected treatment-experienced patients who switched to DTG/DRV/r from May 2014 till March 2017 in 4 Polish centres-results of a 48-week treatment.
The study group consisted of 59 men and 17 women. Median baseline parameters were: age- 42.7 years, CD4 cells count- 560.5 cells/μl, CD4 cells nadir- 150 cells/μl, number of prior antiretroviral regimens- 3. The introduction of dual therapy was primarily due to virologic failure (30 patients), adverse events on previous regimens (17 patients) and therapy simplification (27 patients). At week 48 the treatment was continued in 70/76 of patients and the median CD4 cells count increased from 560.5 to 641.0 cells/μl. The therapy was discontinued in six patients (1 -virologic failure, 1 -decrease of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), 1 -myalgia, 3 -lost to follow-up). At week 48 six patients had detectable viremia, but only in one patient viremia was higher than 200 copies/ml. At week 48 the level of serum total cholesterol of the investigated subjects was statistically significantly higher than at the moment of dual therapy introduction (185.8 mg/dl vs. 174.8 mg/dl- p&lt;0.05). However, in patients previously not treated with TDF, there were no changes in lipid parameters during therapy. Proteinuria was observed in 13.2% of patients before the switch to dual therapy and in 7.1% of patients at week 48.
The investigated dual therapy was effective and safe. The observed increase in lipid parameters only concerned the patients who had used a TDF-based regimen prior to analysed dual treatment.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) significantly reduces the risk of HIV acquisition. TDF is a known nephrotoxin however, renal dysfunction from TDF is mostly reversible following discontinuation.
To describe the renal function, risk factors for renal disease and associated clinical testing practices in a cohort of PrEP patients.
A retrospective review was conducted of all PrEP patients commenced on TDF/FTC at an inner metropolitan sexual health clinic in Sydney, Australia between April 2016 and July 2017, with follow-up data obtained at 3-monthly intervals until 18 months.
525 patients met inclusion criteria. Patients were almost exclusively male and median age was 34 years (IQR: 28 to 42). At baseline, 1.5% had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;70 mL/min/1.73m2. A small significant drop in eGFR of -2.5 mL/min/1.73m2 (p&lt;0.05) occurred between PrEP commencement and the first follow-up period, followed by a progressive decline in eGFR of -0.38 mL/min/1.73m2 per month (95%CI: -0.57 to -0.20; p&lt;0.001). Renal impairment (eGFR &lt;70 mL/min/1.73m2) occurred in 6.5% of patients and persisted across consecutive follow-up periods in five (1.0%) patients. Patients aged ≥40 years had a greater risk of renal impairment than younger patients (HR 3.9, 95%CI: 1.8 to 8.4; p&lt;0.001), despite similar rates of eGFR decline (p = 0.19). PrEP was discontinued in two patients (0.4%) due to renal function concerns.
PrEP use led to an initial drop in eGFR and a more gradual progressive decline subsequently, but significant renal impairment remained uncommon up to 18 months of follow-up.
Soybean hulls (SBH) are a fiber-rich co-product of the soybean oil extraction process that corresponds to 8% of the soybean seed. Despite being readily available and priced competitively, SBH are underutilized in monogastric nutrition. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate SBH as a dietary fiber in canine diets. Four diets were formulated with either SBH, beet pulp (BP), or cellulose (CL) as the main source of dietary fiber (15% total dietary fiber [TDF]), with the control diet formulated with no supplemental fiber (NF). Animal procedures were approved by the University of Illinois Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Eight adult female Beagle (mean age = 4.6 ± 0.6 yr; mean BW = 12.8 ± 1.7 kg) were used in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design. Each period consisted of 14 d, with 10 d of diet adaptation followed by 4 d of total fecal and urine collections. At the end of each period, a blood sample was collected and analyzed for serum chemistry. Food was offered twice daily and fed to maintain body weight. Food intake (g/d) on a dry matter basis (DMB) did not differ among treatments. Fecal score was lower (P &lt; 0.05) for dogs fed CL (2.0) in contrast with other dietary treatments (2.3), using a 5-point scale (1 = hard, dry pellets; 5 = diarrhea). Fecal as-is and DM output did not differ for dogs fed BP, CL, or SBH, and were approximately 50% greater (P &lt; 0.05) than dogs fed NF. Apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of dry matter, organic matter, and gross energy were greater (P &lt; 0.05) for dogs fed NF when compared with dogs fed BP, CL, or SBH. Dogs fed CL had greater (P &lt; 0.05) AHF ATTD (94%) compared with all other treatments (mean = 91%). Dogs fed CL and NF had greater (P &lt; 0.05) CP ATTD, 87% and 86%, respectively, while dogs fed SBH were intermediate (83%) and dogs fed BP were lowest (79%). Total short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentration was greatest in dogs fed BP (582.5 μmol/g) and SBH (479.7 μmol/g) when compared with NF and CL (267.0 and 251.1 μmol/g, respectively). Serum metabolites were within-reference ranges and dogs remained healthy throughout the study. In conclusion, SBH resulted in similar macronutrient ATTD when compared with BP and CL. Dogs fed SBH were also observed to have an increase in fecal SCFA concentration. In general, high level addition of SBH were well-utilized by the dog, resulting in no untoward effects on dog health, nutrient digestibility, or fecal characteristics.
Dietary fibers have gained renewed interest in companion animal nutrition as a means to manage pet obesity and improve gut and host health. Soybean hulls (SBH), a coproduct of the soybean oil extraction process, is an accessible and economical fiber source. However, limited research is available on the use of SBH in feline nutrition. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the effects of a high SBH inclusion level on daily food intake, apparent total tract (ATT) macronutrient digestibility, fecal quality, and fecal fermentative end products in diets of adult cats. Four diets were formulated with either SBH, beet pulp (BP), or cellulose (CL) as the main source of dietary fiber, with the control diet formulated with no added fiber (NF). The fiber treatments were formulated to achieve approximately 15% total dietary fiber (TDF). Eight adult male cats (mean age = 10.5 yr ± 0.1; mean BW = 6.1 ± 0.8 kg) were used in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design. Each period consisted of 14 d, with 10 d of diet adaptation followed by 4 d of total fecal and urine collections. Food was offered twice daily and cats were fed to maintain BW. Food intake on a DM basis (DMB) was lower (P &lt; 0.05) in cats fed BP (55.2 g/d) when compared with SBH (70.8 g/d). As-is fecal output did not differ in cats fed BP or SBH, and when expressed on a DMB, fecal output did not differ among fiber treatments. The ATT digestibility of DM, OM, and GE was greater (P &lt; 0.05) in cats fed NF when compared with those fed BP, CL, or SBH. Cats fed CL had the greatest (P &lt; 0.05) ATT CP digestibility (88.5%), followed by cats fed NF (84.9) and SBH (81.7%) with the lowest values (77%) noted for cats fed BP. Acid-hydrolyzed fat (AHF) digestibility was greater for cats fed CL (92.9%) than for cats fed BP (86.9%) and SBH (88.6%). The TDF ATT digestibility was lowest for cats fed NF and CL (8.5% and 15.1%, respectively), followed by SBH (18.0%), with BP having the highest digestibility (33.7%). Total short-chain fatty acid concentration was greatest (P &lt; 0.05) in cats fed BP (699.7 μmole/g) when compared with the other 3 treatments, whereas phenol and indole concentrations did not differ among treatments. In conclusion, a high inclusion level (15% TDF) of SBH appears acceptable in diets for adult cats, resulting in no negative effects on daily food intake, fecal scores, and similar ATT digestibility for most macronutrients when compared with BP and CL.
The efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) monotherapy as maintenance therapy in multidrug-resistant (MDR) hepatitis B virus (HBV) patients after complete virologic suppression (CVS) has not been well evaluated. We evaluated the efficacy of maintenance TDF monotherapy compared with conventional TDF plus entecavir combination therapy after CVS of MDR HBV.
In this single-center retrospective study, patients with MDR HBV who were previously treated with entecavir plus TDF combination therapy and achieved CVS were included. Patients were either maintained on entecavir plus TDF combination therapy or switched to TDF monotherapy after CVS. The primary endpoint was the virologic breakthrough, and secondary outcomes were liver cirrhosis (LC) or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. To overcome immortal time bias, time-varying Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was performed.
A total of 201 patients were included, and 153 patients were maintained on entecavir plus TDF combination therapy (combination group); 48 patients were converted from combination therapy to TDF monotherapy (single group) after CVS. Five patients experienced a virologic breakthrough, one patient in the single group owing to poor transient compliance and four patients in the combination group (P = 0.51). One new case of LC developed in the single group; five cases of LC developed in the combination group (P = 0.35). No new HCC development occurred in the single group, while seven cases of HCC developments were noted in the combination group. However, these results were not statistically significant (P = 0.54).
For patients with suppressed HBV DNA, the efficacy of TDF monotherapy as maintenance therapy is comparable to that of entecavir plus TDF combination therapy.
AIDS Clinical Trial Group study A5202 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00118898) was a phase 3b, randomized, partially blinded equivalence study of open-label atazanavir/ritonavir or efavirenz, plus either placebo-controlled tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine or abacavir/lamivudine, in treatment-naive adults living with HIV-1, evaluating efficacy, safety, and tolerability. We report an analysis of the contribution of participant characteristics to the disposition of tenofovir plasma concentrations. Tenofovir concentration data from a total of 817 individuals (88% of the total number of eligible patients randomly assigned to receive treatment in the TDF-containing arms of A5202) were available for analysis. Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. One- and two-compartment models with first-order absorption and first-order elimination were evaluated. An exponential error model was used for examination of interindividual variability (IIV), and a proportional and mixed-error model was assessed for residual variability. The final structural model contained two compartments with first-order absorption and elimination. IIV was estimated for apparent clearance (CL/F) and the first-order absorption rate constant (ka ), and a proportional residual variability model was selected. The final mean parameter estimates were as follows: ka = 2.87 h-1, CL/F = 37.2 liters/h, apparent volumes of the central and peripheral compartments = 127 and 646 liters, respectively, and apparent intercompartmental clearance = 107 liters/h. In addition to race/ethnicity, creatinine clearance and assignment to atazanavir/ritonavir or efavirenz were significantly associated with CL/F (P &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, race/ethnicity is associated with tenofovir oral CL in HIV-1 positive, treatment-naive adults. This covariate relationship raises questions about the possibility of differences in efficacy and risk of adverse events in different patient populations and suggests that examining preexposure prophylaxis regimens and tenofovir exposure in different race/ethnicity groups be considered.
Reducing doses of antiretroviral drugs, including stavudine (d4T), may lower toxicity, while preserving efficacy. There are substantial concerns about renal and bone toxicities of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF).
HIV-1-infected treatment-naive adults in India, South Africa, and Uganda.
A phase-4, 96-week, randomized, double-blind, noninferiority trial compared d4T 20 mg twice daily and TDF, taken in combination with lamivudine (3TC) and efavirenz (EFV). The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies per milliliter at 48 weeks. Adverse events assessments included measures of bone density and body fat. The trial is registered on Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02670772).
Between 2012 and 2014, 536 participants were recruited per arm. At week 96, trial completion rates were 75.7% with d4T/3TC/EFV (n = 406) and 82.1% with TDF/3TC/EFV (n = 440, P = 0.011). Noncompletion was largely due to virological failure [6.2% (33) with d4T/3TC/EFV versus 5.4% (29) with TDF/3TC/EFV; P = 0.60]. For the primary endpoint, d4T/3TC/EFV was noninferior to TDF/3TC/EFV (79.3%, 425/536 versus 80.8% 433/536; difference = -1.49%, 95% CI: -6.3 to 3.3; P &lt; 0.001). Drug-related adverse event discontinuations were higher with d4T (6.7%, 36), than TDF (1.1%, 6; P &lt; 0.001). Lipodystrophy was more common with d4T (5.6%, 30) than TDF (0.2%, 1; P &lt; 0.001). Creatinine clearance increased in both arms, by 18.1 mL/min in the d4T arm and 14.2 mL/min with TDF (P = 0.03). Hip bone density measures, however, showed greater loss with TDF.
Low-dose d4T combined with 3TC/EFV demonstrated noninferior virological efficacy compared with TDF/3TC/EFV, but mitochondrial toxicity remained high. Little renal toxicity occurred in either arm. Implications of bone mineral density changes with TDF warrant investigation.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) flares have been reported due to alterations in the immune system during pregnancy. Recent studies in non-pregnant chronic hepatitis B (CHB) carriers have indicated that serum HBV RNA is a novel viral marker to assess treatment response and risk of disease flares.
To analyze serum HBV RNA levels in association with established HBV markers in pregnant and/or post-partum CHB carriers.
In this prospective cohort study, serum and plasma were collected from 46 pregnant and/or post-partum CHB patients. Clinical data included demographics, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) status (Abbott), quantitative hepatitis B s antigen (qHBsAg) levels (Abbott), HBV DNA (Abbott, sensitivity 10 IU/mL), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), liver stiffness measurement (LSM, post-partum), and treatment regime. Serum HBV total RNA and pre-genomic (pg)RNA were quantified using in-house assays, and HBV genotype was determined by direct population sequencing of HBV surface gene. Parametric and non-parametric statistical methods were used for analysis.
In this study, we found that serum HBV total RNA levels correlated with the HBeAg status, HBV DNA, qHBsAg, ALT, and LSM while serum HBV pgRNA levels did not (p &lt; 0.05, N = 46). Additionally, HBV total RNA &amp; pgRNA levels increased, HBV DNA levels decreased, and qHBsAg levels remained unchanged throughout tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) treatment (N = 2).
The associations between serum HBV total RNA with other validated markers indicates it may be a complementary HBV marker to monitor liver disease and HBV replication during pregnancy.
Thermal diffusion flowmetry (TDF) is an appealing candidate for monitoring of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in neurocritical-care patients as it provides absolute measurements with a high temporal resolution, potentially allowing for bedside intervention that could mitigate secondary injury. We performed a systematic review of TDF-regional(r)CBF measurements and their association with (1) patient functional outcome, (2) other neurophysiological parameters, and (3) imaging-based tissue outcomes. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, BIOSIS, GlobalHealth, and the Cochrane Databases from inception to October 2018 and relevant conference proceedings published over the last 5 years. Nine articles that explored the relationship between TDF-rCBF, mortality, and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) or GOS-Extended (GOS-E) at various intervals were included. Despite being based on an overall weak body of evidence, our analysis suggests a link between sustained low or high CBF and poor functional outcome. Twenty-five studies reporting associations with neurophysiological parameters were included. The available data also point to an association between low or high TDF-rCBF and intracranial hypertension. TDF-rCBF appears to correlate well with regional brain tissue oxygenation measurements. We found no studies reporting on imaging-based tissue outcome in relation to TDF. In conclusion, despite being based on a relatively weak body of evidence, the available literature suggests a link between consistently abnormal TDF-rCBF values, intracranial hypertension, and poor functional outcome. TDF-rCBF also appears to correlate well with regional measurements of brain tissue oxygenation. Currently, such monitoring should be considered experimental, requiring much further evaluation prior to widespread adoption.
Over-occupancy at the two tertiary pediatric care hospitals in Alberta, Canada is steadily increasing with simultaneous decline in occupancy of pediatric beds at regional hospitals. Over-occupancy negatively impacts timeliness and potentially, the safety of patient care provided at these two tertiary hospitals. In contrast, underutilization of pediatric beds at regional hospitals poses the risk of losing beds provincially, dilution of regional pediatric expertise and potential erosion of confidence by regional providers. One approach to the current situation in provincial pediatric care capacity is development of telemedicine based innovative models of care that increase the population of patients cared for in regional pediatric beds. A Telemedicine Rounding and Consultation (TRAC) model involves discussing patient care or aspects of their care using telemedicine by employing visual displays, audio and information sharing between tertiary and regional hospitals. To facilitate implementation of a TRAC model, it is essential to understand the perceived barriers among its potential users in local context. The current study utilizes qualitative methodologies to assess these perceived clinician barriers to inform a future pilot and evaluation of this innovative virtual pediatric tertiary-regional collaborative care model in Alberta.
We will use a qualitative descriptive design guided by the Theoretical Domain Framework (TDF) to systematically identify the tertiary and regional clinical stakeholder's perceived barriers and enablers to the implementation of proposed TRAC model of inpatient pediatric care. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups with pediatricians, nurses and allied health professionals, administrators, and family members will be conducted to identify key barriers and enablers to implementation of the TRAC model using TDF. Appropriate behaviour change techniques will be identified to develop potential intervention strategies to overcome identified barriers. These intervention strategies will facilitate implementation of the TRAC model during the pilot phase.
The proposed TRAC model has the potential to address the imbalance between utilization of regional and tertiary inpatient pediatric facilities in Alberta. Knowledge generated regarding barriers and enablers to the TRAC model and the process outlined in this study could be used by health services researchers to develop similar telemedicine-based interventions in Canada and other parts of the world.
Hyperparathyroidism has been described in people living with HIV undergoing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART), but differences in calcium levels have never been investigated in detail. We aimed to compare the prevalence of hypocalcemia between patients with and without TDF-containing ART. The patients and methods were a retrospective cohort study in HIV-infected adult patients receiving dolutegravir and either abacavir (ABC)/lamivudine (3TC) or TDF/emtricitabine in a single center in Munich, Germany. Of 172 patients, 126 (73.3%) were male and the median age was 48.5 years (interquartile range 42-54). Average calcium levels were 2.24 (2.21-2.29) mmol/l and 2.21 (2.16-2.26) mmol/l (P &lt; 0.001) with a prevalence of at least one episode of total calcium &lt;2.12 mmol/l of 16.2 and 34.4% in the groups treated with ABC/3TC and TDF/emtricitabine, respectively (P = 0.006). TDF use was independently associated with the occurrence of albumin-corrected calcium levels of &lt;2.12 mmol/l (odds ratio: 6.7 [1.3-35.6]; P = 0.025). Hypocalcemia seems to occur more often in TDF-treated patients. Further research into hypocalcemia with TDF and potential cardiovascular effects may be of benefit based on these findings.
Modern antiretroviral combination therapy (cART) has transformed HIV from a life-threatening infection into a chronic disease. However, the life-long treatment has side effects that frequently have a negative impact on patients' quality of life. Thus, there are some efforts to "simplify" therapy, i.e. apply regimens with three or fewer antiretroviral substances. However, neurologists are relatively sceptical towards this cART "simplification", because the capacity of simplified regimens to access the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) might be too weak to effectively suppress viral load in this compartment. Thus, data of a big Neuro-AIDS cohort of 4992 HIV-positive patients consecutively recruited over three decades were retrospectively analysed in terms of neurocognitive performance of patients switched to simplified therapy regimens. To test whether simplified drug regimens result in new neuropsychological deficits or the worsening of pre-existing ones in HIV+ patients. Three groups of HIV+ patients were switched from triple therapy to three different two drug regimens (n = 177 to lamivudine/PI, n = 37 to INI/PI, and n = 303 to dual PI); three other groups of patients put from one to an alternative triple combination (n = 290 ABC/3TC/PI, n = 244 TDF/FTC/PI, and n = 158 TDF/FTC/NNRTI) for whatever reason served as controls. All patients were followed up over 4 years maximum. Every patient group improved immunologically and virologically after the switch. However, patients who switched to INI/PI combinations remained stable in neuropsychological tests, while a considerable percentage of patients who switched to other treatments demonstrated a decline. Remarkably, a high percentage of the patients switched to "simplified drug regimens" was not well-controlled virologically before the switch. HIV-positive patients with simplified therapy regimens show some benefit in terms of systemic infection surrogate markers (CD4 ± cell count and plasma viral load); however, neurocognitive deficits do not improve, but remain stable in most cases.
Limitations to the use of long-term Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin (HBIg) following liver transplantation for hepatitis B (HBV) have led to the substitution of HBIg with oral nucleo(s)tide analogue prophylaxis. We prospectively assessed the long-term safety and efficacy of switching to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) from HBIg.
An open-label, multicenter switch study was conducted to evaluate the substitution of TDF for HBIg whilst continuing lamivudine (LAM) therapy in preventing the recurrence of HBV in patients who had been maintained as hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative posttransplantation for at least 12 months.
Eighteen patients were enrolled (median age 66 years, range 42-78 years); 84% were male, and 78% on calcineurin inhibitors. Median time after transplantation was 14 years (range 5-19), and median duration of HBIg/LAM prior to the switch was 10 years (range 1-14). Median follow-up was 5 years (range 5-8). Of 18 patients, 16 (89%) remained HBsAg and HBV DNA negative at the end of follow-up. Two patients had re-emergence of HBsAg without a detectable HBV DNA and no clinical sequelae. Creatinine clearance significantly reduced (median 59 mL/min to 51 mL/min, P = 0.03), necessitating dose reduction of TDF in six (33%) participants, with two eventually ceasing TDF. One patient switched back to HBIg by choice. All patients who changed therapy maintained an undetectable HBsAg.
Substitution of HBIg with TDF in patients on LAM is well tolerated and effective for the long-term prevention of HBV recurrence posttransplantation. Renal dysfunction occurs frequently in the posttransplant setting and can require dose adjustment of TDF or change of therapy.
There are no globally agreed upon treatment guidelines for patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) with multidrug resistance (MDR). We conducted a multicenter, prospective, real-world cohort study of effects of tenofovir disoproxyl fumarate (TDF) monotherapy and TDF-based combination therapy, as rescue therapy, in patients with multidrug-resistant chronic HBV infections.
We recruited patients with chronic HBV infection with resistance to antivirals from 8 tertiary hospitals in Korea. Patients (n=423) received rescue therapy with TDF monotherapy (n=174) or TDF-based combination therapy (n=249). The median follow-up period was 180 weeks. A virologic response was defined as a serum HBV DNA level of &lt;20 IU/mL.
Cumulative rates of virologic response did not differ significantly between the groups that received TDF monotherapy vs combination therapy at 48 weeks (71.7% vs 68.9%), 96 weeks (85.1% vs 84.2%), 144 weeks (92.1% vs 92.7%), 192 weeks (93.4% vs 95.7%), or 240 weeks (97.7% vs 97.2%). Serum levels of HBV DNA below 4.0 log10 IU/mL (odds ratio, 2.478; 95% CI 1.959-3.135; P &lt; .001) and the absence of mutations associated with resistance to adefovir (odds ratio, 1.570; 95% CI 1.279-1.926; P &lt; .001) were associated with virologic response in patients with MDR. There was no significant difference of virologic response among patients of different ages, sex, patients with vs without cirrhosis, positivity for hepatitis B e antigen, or renal function (all P &gt; .05).
In a multicenter, real-world cohort study, long-term use of TDF monotherapy showed non-inferior antiviral efficacy compared with that of TDF-based combination therapy in patients with MDR.
We conducted this study to compare the efficacy and safety of entecavir and tenofovir in the treatment of treatment-naïve HBV e antigen (HBeAg)-positive patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) for 144 weeks.
A total of 320 treatment-naïve HBeAg-positive CHB patients who received randomly a single regimen of either entecavir capsule (ETV) (n = 160) or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate capsule (TDF) (n = 160) for 144 weeks were consecutively enrolled from 14 tertiary hospitals or university hospitals in China between January 2012 and December 2014.
Two groups showed no difference in baseline characteristics. After 144 weeks of treatment, HBV DNA levels were similarly suppressed in both groups (ETV vs TDF; -6.6485 vs -6.692 log10IU/mL, P = .807). At the same time, both groups showed no difference in terms of the serologic and biochemical response. Of all patients, 2 dropped out due to adverse events and 5 experienced serious adverse reactions.
Both capsules (ETV or TDF) were equally effective in nucleos(t)ide-naive CHB patients with a comparable side-effect profile even in a long-term of 144 weeks.
Tenofovir-associated renal toxicity is influenced by several factors, including plasma exposure and genetic variants in transporter-encoding genes. Tenofovir plasma exposure has been associated with a polymorphism in SLC28A2 gene (encoding the concentrative nucleoside transporter 2, CNT2): particularly, SLC28A2 124 CT/TT genotype patients show higher plasma tenofovir concentrations, compared to CC group. In literature, substrate studies are lacking; for this reason, our aim was to understand if tenofovir and tenofovir-alafenamide are CNT2 substrates. We performed an in vitro study using CNT2 expressing MDCKII cells. We observed that tenofovir and tenofovir-alafenamide are not substrates of CNT2. Tenofovir-alafenamide influx pathway remains to be clarified.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-emtricitabine (TDF-FTC) reduces bone mineral density in HIV-uninfected men who have sex with men (MSM). We hypothesized that PrEP with TDF-FTC would increase bone turnover markers (BTMs) at week 24 and that vitamin D supplementation from week 24 to 48 would blunt this increase. Participants were from a cohort of 398 MSM and transgender women who received daily TDF-FTC for PrEP. At week 24, a prospective intervention group initiated vitamin D3 4000 IU daily. Concurrent controls were selected from the cohort who took ≤ 400 IU/day of vitamin D3 matched by age, race, and BMI. The primary endpoint was the change in procollagen-I N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) from week 24 to 48. Paired T-tests were used to compare changes in BTMs between intervention and controls. Among 48 intervention-control pairs, median age was 33 years. At baseline, 68.9% of the intervention group and 77.3% of controls were vitamin D sufficient (≥20 ng/mL, p = 0.94). P1NP, C-telopeptide, parathyroid hormone, and 25-OH vitamin D3 did not increase significantly at week 24. P1NP fell by a mean (±SD) of -27.6±49.9 pg/mL from week 24 to 48 with vitamin D and -2.5±40.2 pg/mL in controls (p = 0.01). There were no significant between groups differences in the week 24-48 change in C-telopeptide, parathyroid hormone, or 25-OH vitamin D3. Vitamin D3 supplementation with 4000 IU/day resulted in a significant reduction in the BTM P1NP compared to controls, suggesting that this intervention has potential to improve bone health during PrEP.
Pharmacologic adherence measures were critical to the interpretation of the tenofovir (TFV)-disoproxil-fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) PrEP trials. These measures are being incorporated into PrEP demonstration projects, but currently-available metrics in plasma, cells, hair or urine involve expensive and time-intensive mass-spectrometry (MS)-based methods. No point-of-care method to assess PrEP adherence in real-time has yet been implemented. Antibody-based tests allow for low-cost, easy-to-perform, point-of-care drug detection. In this study, we developed an antibody-based TFV immunoassay and evaluated its test characteristics among individuals taking TDF/FTC.
We synthesized possible immunogens based on TFV's molecular structure, injected rabbits with the conjugated derivatives, and bled them monthly for subsequent ELISA-testing for TFV-specific antibodies. We purified an antibody with specific TFV binding and created dose-response curves for ELISA-quantification. We then quantified TFV in urine from human participants not taking TDF/FTC and from individuals taking daily TDF/FTC 300 mg/200 mg for 7 days with a 7-day washout period using ELISA with this TFV-specific antibody. ELISA results were compared with the gold-standard test for TFV detection/quantification using liquid-chromatography-tandem-MS (LC-MS/MS).
None of the urine samples from 115 participants not taking TDF/FTC showed ELISA- reactivity, indicating 100% specificity (95% CI 97-100%) of the immunoassay. Among participants taking TDF/FTC, 67 of 70 samples positive by LC-MS/MS were positive by the ELISA-immunoassay for an estimated diagnostic sensitivity of 96% (95% CI 88-99%). The precision of the assay was high (coefficient of variationb15%). The rank correlation between ELISA and LC-MS/MS values in the 70 quantitative urine TFV levels positive by LC-MS/MS across a wide range of concentrations among participants on TDF/FTC was high (r = 0.96).
Our antibody-based immunoassay for measuring TFV in urine performed well compared to the gold-standard of LC-MS/MS among individuals taking TDF/FTC. A sensitive and specific immunoassay paves the way for real-time monitoring/feedback on recent adherence to TFV-based regimens, which should optimize interpretation and outcomes during PrEP and ART roll-out.
As a global biodiversity hotspot, the subtropical evergreen broadleaved forest (SEBF) in southern China is strongly influenced by the humid monsoon climate, with distinct hot-wet and cool-dry season. However, hydraulic strategies of this forest are not well understood. Branch and leaf hydraulic safety margins (HSMbranch and HSMleaf, respectively), as well as seasonal changes in predawn and midday leaf water potential (Ψpd and Ψmd), stomatal conductance (Gs), leaf to sapwood area ratio (AL/AS), and turgor loss point (Ψtlp) were examined for woody species in a mature SEBF. For comparison, we compiled these traits of tropical dry forests (TDF) and Mediterranean-type woodlands (MW) from the literatures because they experience hot-dry season. We found that on average SEBF showed larger HSMbranch and HSMleaf than TDF and MW. During the dry season, TDF and MW species displayed a significant decrease in Ψpd and Ψmd. However, SEBF species showed a slight decrease in Ψpd but an increase in Ψmd. Similar to TDF and MW species, Gs was substantially lower in the dry season for SEBF species, but this might be primarily because of the low atmospheric temperature (low vapor pressure deficit). On the other hand, AL/AS and Ψtlp were not significant different between seasons for any SEBF species. Most SEBF species had leaves that were more resistant to cavitation than branches. Additionally, species with stronger leaf-to-branch vulnerability segmentation tended to have smaller HSMleaf but larger HSMbranch. Our results suggest that subtropical evergreen broadleaved forest is at low hydraulic risk under the current climate.
To establish an evidence-based dietetics service in an in-centre haemodialysis unit utilising implementation science.
The service was developed through the Knowledge-to-Action Framework. The steps of the Action Cycle were addressed through a literature review, identification of evidence-based guidelines, benchmarking and local staff engagement. The theoretical domains framework (TDF) was used to identify barriers/enablers, and behaviour change wheel to determine appropriate interventions. To monitor, evaluate outcomes and assess sustained knowledge use we employed multidisciplinary team engagement and database use. Audit data were collected at baseline, 6 and 12 months on nutrition assessment (Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment), intervention timeliness and alignment to dietetic workforce recommendations. Descriptive statistics, McNemar tests and a linear mixed model were applied.
Barriers existed in the knowledge, skills, environmental context and resources TDF domains. Suitable interventions were identified with training on nutritional management of haemodialysis patients delivered to 148 nurses, and nutrition management recommendations summarised into local procedural resources. A database to prompt and monitor outcome measures was created and indicated that over 18 months post-service commencement, eligible patients received nutrition assessment at least 6-monthly, aligning with recommendations. Prevalence of malnutrition was 28% (n = 9/32) at baseline, 23% (n = 5/22) at 6 months and 20% (n = 4/20) at 12 months (P = 0.50).
We demonstrated benefits to service development and implementation with implementation science providing a structured and methodical approach to translating guidelines into practice. Development of training, resources and prompts for outcome measures has supported the establishment of an evidence-based dietetics service in a haemodialysis unit.
Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) guidelines recommend early oral feeding with nutritionally adequate diets after surgery. However, studies have demonstrated variations in practice and poor adherence to these recommendations among patients who have undergone colorectal surgery. Given doctors are responsible for prescribing patients' diets after surgery, this study explored factors which influenced medical staffs' decision-making regarding postoperative nutrition prescription to identify potential behaviour change interventions.
This qualitative study involved one-on-one, semi-structured interviews with medical staff involved in prescribing nutrition for patients following colorectal surgery across two tertiary teaching hospitals. Purposive sampling was used to recruit participants with varying years of clinical experience. The Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) underpinned the development of a semi-structured interview guide. Interviews were audio recorded, with data transcribed verbatim before being thematically analysed. Emergent themes and sub-themes were discussed by all investigators to ensure consensus of interpretation.
Twenty-one medical staff were interviewed, including nine consultants, three fellows, four surgical trainees and five junior medical doctors. Three overarching themes emerged from the data: (i) Prescription preferences are influenced by perceptions, experience and training; (ii) Modifying prescription practices to align with patient-related factors; and (iii) Peers influence prescription behaviours and attitudes towards nutrition.
Individual beliefs, patient-related factors and the social influence of peers (particularly seniors) appeared to strongly influence medical staffs' decision-making regarding postoperative nutrition prescription. As such, a multi-faceted approach to behaviour change is required to target individual and organisational barriers to enacting evidence-based feeding recommendations.
A unique chronic hepatitis B patient was followed over 189 months of nucleoside/nucleotide analogue (NAs) therapies with the analysis of multiple drug-resistance HBV mutants.
Clonal sequencing (≥ 20 clones/sample) was performed on sera sampled at 41 time-points, and the phenotypic features of eight representative mutants were analyzed.
Lamivudine (LAM)-, adefovir dipivoxil (ADV)-, entecavir (ETV)-, and repeat ADV-resistance mutants emerged upon individual sequential NA monotherapy. The efficacy of NA combination rescue therapies ranked as LAM+ADV &lt; ETV+ADV &lt; ETV+tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). Specifically, LAM+ADV and ETV+ADV suppressed viral loads to &lt; 100 IU/mL for a long period of time, either with or without late stage HBV DNA fluctuations. Furthermore, ETV+TDF suppressed the viral load to &lt; 10 IU/mL. During the LAM+ADV and ETV+ADV combination therapies, ETV-resistance mutants dominated at most time-points, and MDR mutants that harbored LAM-, ETV- and ADV-resistance mutations were intermittently detected. Interestingly, the rtA181T-causative sW172stop to sW172non-stop mutation transition was observed at HBV DNA fluctuations. In a phenotypic analysis, two MDR strains had cross-resistance to LAM, ETV, and ADV, and a lower susceptibility to TDF (&lt; 10-fold decrease compared to the wild-type strain). In contrast, the natural replication capacity was inversely associated with the number of primary resistant mutations which would limit MDR mutant development.
Taken together, viral drug susceptibility, replication capacity, and perhaps immunological adaptation may play coordinated roles in the fitness of drug-resistance mutants. ETV+TDF therapy is the preferred option for treating chronic hepatitis B patients with multiple drug failure.
Bamboo shoot shell (BSS) was enzymatically decomposed to yield insoluble dietary fiber (IDF), soluble dietary fiber (SDF) and total dietary fiber (TDF), which were investigated for their hypoglycemic properties using in vitro and in vivo methods. The results indicated that SDF exhibited significantly higher glucose adsorbing capacity than those of IDF and TDF. Moreover, SDF showed similar inhibition potential against α-amylase with acarbose. TDF displayed the greater capacities of delaying glucose diffusion and inhibition of α-glucosidase than those of SDF. In the diabetic mice, after 4-week administration of BSS fibers or metformin, the blood glucose levels were significantly reduced and the oral glucose tolerance was improved. TDF and IDF hardly influenced the blood insulin level, while SDF could significantly increase blood insulin level. The results showed that BSS fibers could be a potentially available dietary ingredient in functional food.
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) monotherapy has displayed non-inferior efficacy to TDF plus entecavir (ETV) combination therapy in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) resistant to ETV and/or adefovir (ADV). Nonetheless, the virologic response rate was suboptimal in patients receiving up to 144 weeks of TDF monotherapy. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of TDF monotherapy given for up to 240 weeks.
One trial enrolled patients with ETV resistance without ADV resistance (n = 90), and another trial included patients with ADV resistance (n = 102). Most patients (91.2%) also had lamivudine resistance. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive TDF monotherapy or TDF + ETV combination therapy for 48 weeks, and then TDF monotherapy until week 240. We compared efficacy between the studies and safety in the pooled population at 240 weeks.
At week 240, the proportion of patients with serum HBV DNA &lt;15 IU/ml was not significantly different between the ETV and ADV resistance groups in the full analysis set (84.4% vs. 73.5%; p = 0.07), which was significantly different by on-treatment analysis (92.7% vs. 79.8%; p = 0.02). Virologic blips associated with poor medication adherence occurred in 7 patients throughout the 240 weeks. None developed additional HBV resistance mutations. Among the 170 HBV e antigen (HBeAg)-positive patients at baseline, 12 (7.1%) achieved HBeAg seroconversion at week 240. None achieved HBV surface antigen seroclearance. Significant decreases from baseline were observed at week 240 in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (-3.21 ml/min/1.73 m2 by the CKD-EPI equation, p &lt;0.001) and bone mineral density (g/cm2) at the femur (-2.48%, p &lt;0.001).
Up to 240 weeks of TDF monotherapy provided an increasing virologic response rate in heavily pretreated patients with HBV resistant to ETV and/or ADV. However, it was associated with poor serological responses and decreasing renal function and bone mineral density. (ClinicalTrials.gov No, NCT01639066 and NCT01639092).
In patients chronically infected with hepatitis B virus resistant to multiple drugs including lamivudine, entecavir, and/or adefovir, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) monotherapy showed non-inferior efficacy compared with the combination therapy of TDF plus entecavir. Nonetheless, short-term TDF monotherapy was associated with suboptimal virologic response, and its long-term safety was uncertain. This study displayed that 240 weeks of TDF monotherapy provided a virologic response in most of those patients, but it was associated with poor serological responses and decreasing renal function and bone mineral density.
With the phase-out of stavudine (d4T), change to first-line regimens with zidovudine (AZT) or tenofovir (TDF) in resource-limited settings (RLS) might increase risks of cross-resistance to nucleos(t) ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI). This would restrict the scope of switching to the World Health Organisation (WHO)-recommended standard second-line combinations (SLC) without HIV drug resistance (HIVDR)-testing in routine clinical practice.
An observational study was conducted among 101 Cameroonian patients (55.4% male, median [IQR] age 34 [10-41] years) failing first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 2016, and stratified into three groups according to NRTIs exposure: exposure to both thymidine analogues AZT "and" D4T (group-A, n = 55); exposure to both TDF and AZT "or" D4T (group-B, n = 22); exposure solely to D4T (group-C, n = 24). Protease-reverse transcriptase HIVDR was interpreted using the HIVdb penalty scores (≥60: high-resistance; 20-59: intermediate-resistance; &lt; 20: susceptible). The acceptable threshold for potential-efficacy was set at 80%.
The median [IQR] CD4, viral RNA, and time on ART, were respectively 129 [29-466] cells/μl, 71,630 [19,041-368,000] copies/ml, and 4 [2-5] years. Overall HIVDR-level was 89.11% (90/101), with 83.2% harbouring M184 V (high-level 3TC/FTC-resistance) and only 1.98% (2/101) major HIVDR-mutations to ritonavir-boosted protease-inhibitors (PI/r). Thymidine-analogue mutations (TAMs)-1 [T215FY (46.53%), M41 L (22.77%), L210 W (8.91%)], with cross-resistance to AZT and TDF, were higher compared to TAMs-2 [D67N (21.78%), K70R (19.80%), K219QE (18.81%)]. As expected, K65R was related with TDF-exposure: 0% (0/55) in group-A, 22.72% (5/22) group-B, 4.17% (1/24) group-C (p = 0.0013). The potential-efficacy of AZT vs. TDF was respectively 43.64% (24/55) vs. 70.91% (39/55) in group-A (p = 0.0038); 63.64% (14/22) vs. 68.28% (15/22) in group-B (p = 1.0000); and 37.50% (9/24) vs. 83.33% (20/24) in group-C (p = 0.0032). CRF02_AG was the prevailing subtype (63.40%), followed by CRF11.cpx (8.91%), A1 (7.92%), G (5.94%); without any significant effect of the subtype-distribution on HIVDR (92.2% in CRF02_AG vs. 83.8% in non-AG; p = 0.204).
First-line ART-failure exhibits high-level NRTI-resistance, with potential lower-efficacy of AZT compared to TDF. Significantly, using our 80% efficacy-threshold, only patients without NRTI-substitution on first-line could effectively switch to SLC following the WHO-approach. Patients with multiple NRTI-substitutions (exposed to both thymidine-analogues and TDF) on first-line ART would require HIVDR-testing to select active NRTIs for SLC.
Entecavir (ETV) resistance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) conventionally requires rt184, 202, or 250 mutations plus lamivudine-resistance mutation (rtM204V/I ± L180M). This study aimed to clarify whether rtL180M+A181C+M204V mutations may contribute to HBV ETV resistance.
Serum samples were collected from 22,009 patients who underwent resistance testing in Beijing 302 Hospital from 2007 to 2016. HBV reverse transcriptase (RT) gene was screened by direct sequencing and verified by clonal sequencing. Phenotypic analysis was performed for evaluating replication capacity and drug susceptibility.
Classical ETV-resistance mutations of HBV were detected in 1252 patients who were receiving ETV therapy. The rtA181C mutation was detected with rtL180M+M204V mutations in 18 lamivudine-experienced ETV-treated patients, and the emergence of the mutations was associated with virological breakthrough or inadequate virological response to ETV. Patient-derived representative rtA181C-containing mutants, rtL180M+A181C+M204V, rtL180M+A181C+M204V+M250V, and rtL180M+A181C+S202G+M204V, exhibited 45.7%, 25.9%, and 25.0% replication capacity and 85.6-, 356.1-, and 307.1-fold decreased susceptibility to ETV respectively compared to the wild-type strain, while the three mutants remained sensitive to tenofovir (TDF). Artificial elimination of rtA181C largely restored the rtL180M+A181C+M204V mutant's sensitivity to ETV. Molecular modelling of viral RT binding to ETV showed that the rtL180M+A181C+M204V mutant had a less stable conformation compared to rtL180M+M204V mutant. In clinical practice, undetectable serum HBV DNA was achieved in two of five longitudinally followed rtA181C-positive patients who received switching-to TDF therapy, but not in the other three who received add-on adefovir therapy during observation.
Both clinical and experimental data support rtL180M+A181C+M204V as a novel non-classical ETV-resistance mutation pattern.
Antiretroviral therapy (ART) durability, time to modification or cessation, has declined. The study objective was to determine whether kidney dysfunction is contributing to reduced durability.
This retrospective follow-up study of CNICS evaluated treatment-naive PLWH initiating ART between 2007 and 2014. Regimen modification was defined as cessation/modification of any part of the 3-drug ART regimen. We evaluated the role of kidney dysfunction in initial regimen modification as both a mediator and effect measure modifier. Associations of the variables with the ART modification were examined using univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models.
Of 4515 PLWH included in the analysis, 1967 modified their ART. Of those receiving TDF-based ART (n = 3888), 1580 (41%) modified their regimen compared with 387 (62%) receiving other regimens. Overall, the median eGFR decreased by 5 mL/min/1.73 m (quartiles: first = -16, third = 0) from baseline to follow-up. Of the 128 patients with low baseline eGFR (&lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m), the final eGFR remained low in 73% while it increased to above 60 mL/min/1.73 m in 27%. Of the 4387 with normal baseline eGFR, only 135 (3%) had a final eGFR &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m. Those with low eGFR at the baseline and/or final visits were more likely to modify ART than others (hazards ratio = 1.75, 95% confidence interval: 1.39 to 2.19, P &lt; 0.001). Relative to other regimens, TDF-based ART was less likely to be modified when accounting for numerous clinical and demographic traits.
For patients in our study initiated on ART, including TDF-based ART, in the last decade, kidney dysfunction is not a major factor leading to regimen modification.
HPTN 067 assessed the feasibility of daily and non-daily dosing of open-label emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF)-based pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).
Factors associated with sex-related PrEP adherence were assessed among men who have sex with men (MSM) randomized to one of 3 PrEP dosing arms in HPTN 067 in New York City. Sex-related PrEP adherence was defined per protocol as at least 1 PrEP tablet taken within 4 days pre-sex and at least 1 additional PrEP tablet taken within 24 hours post-sex, assessed via electronic drug monitoring and weekly interviews. Demographic data and behavioral measures were evaluated for association with sex-related PrEP adherence. Logistic regression for clustered data was used to estimate the unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios.
Of 176 randomized MSM participants, 59% were Black, 10% White, 25% Hispanic, and 6% other; median age was 31 years. In the multivariable analyses, higher sex-related PrEP adherence was significantly associated with daily dosing arm, older age, employment, and higher PrEP adherence behavioral skills. Lower sex-related PrEP adherence was significantly associated with identifying as Black or Hispanic (compared with White), opiate use, and reporting "I forgot" as an adherence barrier.
This analysis identified populations of MSM who might benefit from additional support to optimize PrEP adherence, including those who are younger, unemployed, or opiate users. MSM with lower PrEP behavioral skills may benefit from targeted interventions. Further study is needed to assess racial and ethnic disparities in PrEP adherence, which may reflect broader social and economic inequalities not captured in this study.
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), a drug broadly used in combination antiretroviral therapy, is associated with renal dysfunction but the prevalence varied from country to country and it is not known in Ethiopia. The objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence of renal dysfunction and risk factors associated with it and the mean change in estimated glomerular filtration rate in human immunodeficiency virus infected patients receiving TDF based antiretroviral regimen at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital.
It was a hospital based prospective cohort study. The study participants were treatment naïve HIV infected patients initiating TDF containing combination antiretroviral therapy or switched to it because of adverse events. Multivariable logistic analysis was used to identify variables which have significant association.
A total of 63 study participants were studied, 16 (25.4%) of whom had fall in eGFR greater than 25% relative to baseline. Only age greater than 50 years, baseline CD4 count less than 200 cells/mm3, and baseline proteinuria were significantly associated with renal dysfunction in multivariable logistic regression. There was -8.4 ml/min/1.73m2 mean change in estimated glomerular filtration rate relative to baseline at six months of study.
The renal dysfunction (defined as decline in eGFR greater than 25%) was found in a quarter of the study population. The long term impact and the clinical implication of it are not clear. Future prospective study is required with large sample size and long duration to ascertain the prevalence of decline greater than 25% in estimated glomerular filtration rate and its progression to chronic kidney disease.
Data on the longer-term effectiveness of second line combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are lacking. We sought to assess the probability and determinants of 2nd line ART failure in SSA.
A retrospective, multi-center study of 2nd line ART initiated between 2005 and 2017 at four ART centers in Ethiopia, Ghana and Uganda. Main outcome measure was virologic failure (VF) defined as VL&gt;1000 copies/ml after &gt;6 months on 2nd line therapy. Predictors of VF and virologic re-suppression on 2nd line were evaluated using Cox Proportional Hazards and multivariable logistic regression models, respectively.
2191 subjects started 2nd line therapy, 61.5% females. Switching from 1st line (56.4% NVP-based, 70.3% including thymidine-analogues) to 2nd line therapy occurred after mean of 4.1 years. 98.9% of patients started boosted PI with NRTI backbone (TDF+3TC/FTC 67.3%, AZT+3TC 18.5%, others 14.2%). There were 267 (12.0%) VF with a 5-year estimated probability of 15.0% (95% CI 13.2-16.9). Key determinants of VF were concomitant rifampicin use (aHR 2.50 [95% CI 1.54-4.05]) and clinical/immunological failure versus virologic failure as reason for switching therapy (aHR, 0.53 [0.33-0.86]). 138 of 267 (51.7%) subsequently achieved virologic re-suppression and predictors included HIV RNA levels at 2nd-line failure: +1 log higher aOR 0.59 [0.43-0.80], experiencing change within 2nd line ART before VF: aOR 0.17 [0.05-0.56], and more recent calendar year of 2nd line initiation: aOR 0.85 [0.75-0.94].
The effectiveness of current 2nd line ART regimens in SSA is good but challenged by interactions with TB therapy.
To evaluate the impact of the combination of BRL 37344 and tadalafil (TDF) on the reduction of overactive bladder (OB) symptoms.
Thirty mice were randomized into 5 groups (G) of 6 animals each. L-NAME was used to induce DO. G1: Control; G2: L-NAME; G3: L-NAME + TDF; G4: L-NAME + BRL 37344; G5: L-NAME + TDF + BRL 37344. After 30 days of treatment, the animals were submitted to cystometry to evaluate non-voiding contractions (NVC), threshold pressure (TP), baseline pressure (BP), frequency of micturition (FM) and threshold volume (TV). Differences between the groups were analyzed with ANOVA followed by the Tukey test.
NVC increased in G2 (4.33±2.58) in relation to G1 (1.50±0.55). NVC decreased in G3 (2.00±1.10), G4 (1.50±1.52) and G5 (2.00±1.26) compared to G2 (p&lt;0.05). FM decreased in G3 (0.97±0.71), G4 (0.92±0.38) and G5 (1.05±0.44) compared to G2 (p&lt;0.05). However, the combination of TDF and BRL37344 was not more effective at increasing NVC and improving FM than either drug alone. The five groups did not differ significantly with regard to TV.
The combination of BRL 37344 and TDF produced no measurable additive effect on reduction of OB symptoms.
Translating scientific advances in genomic medicine into evidence-based clinical practice is challenging. Studying the natural translation of genomics into 'early-adopting' health system sectors is essential. We will (a) examine 29 health systems (Australian and Melbourne Genomics Health Alliance flagships) integrating genomics into practice and (b) combine this learning to co-design and test an evidence-based generalisable toolkit for translating genomics into healthcare.
Twenty-nine flagships integrating genomics into clinical settings are studied as complex adaptive systems to understand emergent and self-organising behaviours among inter-related actors and processes. The Effectiveness-Implementation Hybrid approach is applied to gather information on the delivery and potential for real-world implementation. Stages '1' and '2a' (representing hybrid model 1) are the focus of this protocol. The Translation Science to Population Impact (TSci Impact) framework is used to study policy decisions and service provision, and the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) is used to understand individual level behavioural change; both frameworks are applied across stages 1 and 2a. Stage 1 synthesises interview data from 32 participants involved in developing the genomics clinical practice systems and approaches across five 'demonstration-phase' (early adopter) flagships. In stage 2a, stakeholders are providing quantitative and qualitative data on process mapping, clinical audits, uptake and sustainability (TSci Impact), and psychosocial and environmental determinants of change (TDF). Findings will be synthesised before codesigning an intervention toolkit to facilitate implementation of genomic testing. Study methods to simultaneously test the comparative effectiveness of genomic testing and the implementation toolkit (stage 2b), and the refined implementation toolkit while simply observing the genomics intervention (stage 3) are summarised.
Ethical approval has been granted. The results will be disseminated in academic forums and used to refine interventions to translate genomics evidence into healthcare. Non-traditional academic dissemination methods (eg, change in guidelines or government policy) will also be employed.
Brain imaging with diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) is sensitive to microstructural white matter (WM) changes associated with brain aging and neurodegeneration. In its third phase, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI3) is collecting data across multiple sites and scanners using different dMRI acquisition protocols, to better understand disease effects. It is vital to understand when data can be pooled across scanners, and how the choice of dMRI protocol affects the sensitivity of extracted measures to differences in clinical impairment. Here, we analyzed ADNI3 data from 317 participants (mean age: 75.4 ± 7.9 years; 143 men/174 women), who were each scanned at one of 47 sites with one of six dMRI protocols using scanners from three different manufacturers. We computed four standard diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) indices including fractional anisotropy (FADTI) and mean, radial, and axial diffusivity, and one FA index based on the tensor distribution function (FATDF), in 24 bilaterally averaged WM regions of interest. We found that protocol differences significantly affected dMRI indices, in particular FADTI. We ranked the diffusion indices for their strength of association with four clinical assessments. In addition to diagnosis, we evaluated cognitive impairment as indexed by three commonly used screening tools for detecting dementia and AD: the AD Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the Clinical Dementia Rating scale sum-of-boxes (CDR-sob). Using a nested random-effects regression model to account for protocol and site, we found that across all dMRI indices and clinical measures, the hippocampal-cingulum and fornix (crus)/stria terminalis regions most consistently showed strong associations with clinical impairment. Overall, the greatest effect sizes were detected in the hippocampal-cingulum (CGH) and uncinate fasciculus (UNC) for associations between axial or mean diffusivity and CDR-sob. FATDF detected robust widespread associations with clinical measures, while FADTI was the weakest of the five indices for detecting associations. Ultimately, we were able to successfully pool dMRI data from multiple acquisition protocols from ADNI3 and detect consistent and robust associations with clinical impairment and age.
The purpose of this study was to identify and compare barriers and enablers to the implementation of the Children's Hospital Early Warning Score (CHEWS) on a pediatric inpatient unit pre- and post-implementation.
A qualitative descriptive design, guided by the Theoretical Domains Framework, was used to conduct semi-structured focus groups and individual interviews with nurses on a pediatric inpatient unit to identify barriers and enablers in the pre- and post- CHEWS implementation phases. Data were analyzed using a directed content analysis approach followed by inductive thematic analysis.
Two pre-implementation focus groups (N = 15) and 8 post-implementation individual interviews with nurses were conducted. We identified pre- and post- CHEWS implementation barriers related to clinical decision making, interprofessional relationships, the unit context, and negative emotions, and enablers related to quality of care and patient safety. The identified barriers and enablers to implementation were categorized within 13 TDF domains.
Our findings illustrate a range of barriers and enablers to CHEWS implementation during the pre- and post-implementation phases. Tailored strategies are needed to overcome barriers related to nurses' perceptions of CHEWS impeding clinical decision-making and interprofessional collaboration. By addressing the identified barriers, we can leverage nurses' motivations for using CHEWS to improve the quality of patient care and enhance patient safety.
The barriers and enablers identified in this study can be used to select implementation strategies to support the use of early warning systems in pediatric nursing practice.
Hepatitis D is the most severe form of chronic viral hepatitis. Treatment guidelines recommend 1 year of peginterferon alfa, which is effective in 25-30% of patients only. Whether prolonged therapy with peginterferon alfa-2a for 96 weeks and combination therapy with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) would increase hepatitis D virus (HDV) RNA suppression is unknown. We aimed to explore whether prolonged treatment of HDV with 96 weeks of peginterferon would increase HDV RNA response rates and reduces post-treatment relapses.
We did two parallel, investigator-initiated, multicentre, double-blind randomised, controlled trials at 14 study sites in Germany, Greece, Romania, and Turkey. Patients with chronic HDV infection and compensated liver disease who were aged 18 years or older were eligible for inclusion. All patients were HBsAg positive for at least 7 months, anti-HDV positive for at least 3 months, and HDV-RNA positive at the local laboratory at the screening visit. Patients were ineligible if alanine aminotransferase levels were higher than ten times above the upper limit of normal and if platelet counts were lower than 90 000 per μL, or if they had received interferon therapy or treatment with a nucleoside and nucleotide analogue within the preceding 6 months. Patients were randomly assigned by blinded stratified block randomisation (1:1) to receive 180 μg of peginterferon alfa-2a weekly plus either TDF (300 mg once daily) or placebo for 96 weeks. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with undetectable HDV RNA at the end of treatment assessed by intention to treat. The trials are registered as NCT00932971 and NCT01088659.
Between June 24, 2009, and Feb 28, 2011, we randomly assigned 59 HDV RNA-positive patients to receive peginterferon alfa-2a plus TDF and 61 to receive peginterferon alfa-2a plus placebo, including 48 (40%) patients with cirrhosis to the two treatment groups (23 in the peginterferon alfa-2a plus TDF group and 25 in the peginterferon alfa-2a plus placebo group). The primary endpoint was achieved in 28 (48%) of 59 patients in the peginterferon alfa-2a plus TDF group and in 20 (33%) of 61 patients in the peginterferon alfa-2a plus placebo group (odds ratio 1·84, 95% CI 0·86-3·91, p=0·12). We recorded 944 adverse events (459 in the peginterferon alfa-2a plus TDF group and 485 in the peginterferon alfa-2a plus placebo group). The most common adverse events were haematological, behavioural (eg, fatigue), musculoskeletal, influenza-like syndromes, and psychiatric complaints.
Addition of TDF resulted in no significant improvement in HDV RNA response rates at the end of treatment. These findings highlight that alternative treatment options are needed for hepatitis D.

Urinary biomarkers of kidney injury may have potential to identify subclinical injury attributable to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) toxicity.
This observational study included 198 HIV-infected participants from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study and the Women's Interagency HIV Study, who initiated TDF between 2009 and 2015 and had urine samples collected at baseline before and after TDF initiation.
We used linear mixed-effects models controlling for urine creatinine and time on TDF to evaluate the effects of TDF initiation on changes in 14 urinary biomarkers.
Within 1 year after TDF initiation, concentrations of trefoil factor 3 [+78%; 95% confidence interval (CI) +38%, +129%), alpha-1 microglobulin (α1m) (+32%; 95% CI +13%, +55%), clusterin (+21%; 95% CI +6%, +38%), uromodulin (+19%; 95% CI +4%, +36%), and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) (+13%; 95% CI +1%, +26%) significantly increased, whereas interleukin-18 (IL-18) significantly decreased (-13%, 95% CI -7%, -25%). Subsequent to the first year of TDF use, biomarker concentrations stabilized, and these changes were not statistically significant. When stratifying by baseline viremia (HIV-1 RNA &lt; vs. ≥80 copies/ml), concentration changes for most biomarkers during the first year of TDF use were greater among aviremic vs. viremic participants, with significant differences in α1m (+80 vs. +22%), KIM-1 (+43 vs. +10%), beta-2 microglobulin (+83 vs. -10%), YKL-40 (+33 vs. -5%), and IL-18 (+20 vs. -27%).
TDF initiation was associated with substantial changes in urinary biomarkers of kidney injury within the first year of use, particularly among aviremic participants. A urinary biomarker panel may be a clinically useful tool to detect and monitor the heterogeneous effects of TDF on the kidney.
Evaluate long-term rates of virological failure and treatment interruption for people living with HIV (PLWHIV) with viral suppression on first-line efavirenz + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate + emtricitabine/lamivudine (EFV + TDF + FTC/3TC), and compare these according to patient characteristics.
PLWHIV enrolled in the Collaboration of Observational HIV Epidemiological Research Europe cohort collaboration, who started first-line EFV + TDF + FTC/3TC at age at least 16 years and had viral suppression (&lt;200 copies/ml) within 9 months were included. Rates of virological failure (≥200 copies/ml) and (complete) treatment interruption were estimated according to years since initial suppression. We used Poisson regression to examine associations of baseline characteristics with rates of virological failure or treatment interruption.
Among 19 527 eligible PLWHIV with median (interquartile range) follow-up 3.7 (2.0-5.6) years after initial viral suppression, the estimated rate of the combined incidence of virological failure or treatment interruption fell from 9.0/100 person-years in the first year to less than 4/100 person-years beyond 3 years from suppression; considering only those remaining on EFV + TDF + FTC/3TC, the combined rate dropped from 8.2/100 person-years in the first year to less than 3.5/100 person-years beyond 3 years. PLWHIV with injecting drug-related or heterosexual transmission were at higher risk of virological failure or treatment interruption, as were those of Black ethnicity. PLWHIV aged less than 35 years were at higher risk of virological failure and treatment interruption.
PLWHIV starting first-line EFV + TDF + FTC/3TC had low rates of virological failure and treatment interruption up to 10 years from initial suppression. Demographic characteristics can be used to identify subpopulations with higher risks of these outcomes.
Adherence to nebulizer treatment in adults with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is poor, and interventions are needed. This research aimed to identify the factors affecting nebulizer adherence using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and to compare these for participants with different levels of adherence.
Data-prompted interviews using the TDF.
Eighteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with adults with CF during which objectively measured adherence data were discussed. Framework analysis was used to code the data into TDF domains, and inductive qualitative content analysis was used to code different beliefs and experiences. Aspects of the TDF that differed between participants with different adherence levels were explored.
Factors influencing adherence to treatment included all 14 domains of the TDF, 10 of which appeared to vary by adherence level: Skills; Memory and decision-making; and Behavioural regulation; Environmental context and resources; Social influences; Beliefs about consequences; Beliefs about capability; Reinforcement; Social role and identify; Intentions; Optimism; and Emotions.
This study is the first to use objectively measured adherence data in a data-prompted interview using the TDF framework to systematically assess the full range of factors potentially influencing adherence. The results highlighted that interventions need to consider issues of capability, opportunity, and motivation. Interventions that challenge dysfunctional beliefs about adherence and which support the development of routines or habits and problem-solving may be particularly useful for adults with CF. Statement of contribution What is already known? Adherence to medication in adults with cystic fibrosis is poor. Previous research has identified a range of contributing factors in relation to subjective reports of adherence. There is a wide discrepancy between self-reported adherence and objectively measured adherence. What this study adds A data-prompted interview using objectively measured adherence data enabled the systematic assessment of potential factors that could be targeted in an intervention to increase adherence. There were some differences in the factors that were identified by high and low adherers. There is not one-size fits all intervention for adherence to medication in cystic fibrosis.
Objective: To investigate the impact of immediate cessation of antiviral therapy on postpartum liver function and the factors influencing postpartum abnormality in mothers with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted. One hundred eighty-eight pregnant women with HBV DNA level &gt; 2×106 IU/ml were enrolled from June 2014 to June 2018. Demographic information and clinical data of liver function and HBV DNA load during gravidity, intrapartum and postpartum period were collected. According to the antiviral treatment recommendations during pregnancy, the women were divided into three groups, namely, tenofovir (TDF), telbivudine (LdT) and control group. Liver function abnormalities among the three groups were compared within 6 months after delivery, and the factors influencing abnormal liver function were analyzed by unconditional logistic regression. Results: Of the 188 cases, 72 cases were in the TDF group, 80 cases in the LdT group, and 36 cases in the control group. Pregnant women in the TDF and LdT groups received oral TDF (300 mg/d) and LdT (600 mg/d) from 28 ± 4 weeks of gestation till delivery. Among the 188 patients, 30 (16.0%) had abnormal postpartum liver function abnormality. The incidence of postpartum liver function abnormality [alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 2 × upper limit of normal (ULN)] in the TDF, LdT, and control groups was 19.4%, 12.5%, and 16.7%, respectively. The postpartum peak levels of ALT (median, range) in the three groups were 34.5 (12.0-946.0) U/L, 37.5 (12.0-733.8) U/L, and 39.0 (7.0-513.0) U/L, respectively. There was no significant difference between the two indexes among the three groups (P &gt; 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in the degree of postpartum liver function abnormalities between the three groups (P = 0.944). Most of the liver function abnormalities were mild to moderate (2 × ULN≤ALT &lt; 10 × ULN), and usually resolved spontaneously or by treatment. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that baseline ALT level during pregnancy was an independent factor associated with postpartum liver function abnormality (OR = 1.031, CI 95%: 1.005-1.058; χ(2) = 5.340, P = 0.021), whereas age, antiviral therapy, HBeAg-positivity, baseline HBV DNA levels, gravidity, parity, preterm delivery and delivery mode were not significantly associated with postpartum liver function abnormality. Conclusion: Cessation of antiviral therapy after delivery did not significantly increase the risk of postpartum liver function abnormality in pregnant women with chronic HBV infection. The ALT level during pregnancy is a factor influencing postpartum liver function abnormality.
目的： 探讨妊娠期抗病毒治疗的慢性乙型肝炎病毒（HBV）感染孕妇分娩后立即停药对产后肝功能的影响及产后肝功能异常的影响因素。 方法： 采用回顾性队列研究，于2014年6月至2018年6月纳入188例慢性HBV感染且HBV DNA &gt; 2×10(6) IU/ml的孕妇为研究对象，收集人口学信息，妊娠期、分娩、产后的肝功能及HBV DNA载量等临床数据，按孕期抗病毒治疗情况分为替诺福韦酯（TDF）组、替比夫定（LdT）组和未抗病毒对照组，比较三组孕妇产后6个月内肝功能异常情况，并采用非条件logistic回归分析产后肝功能异常的影响因素。 结果： 纳入的188例孕妇中，TDF组72例、LdT组80例和对照组36例。TDF组和LdT组孕妇从妊娠28±4周（基线）开始分别口服TDF（300 mg/d）和LdT（600 mg/d）至分娩后停药。188例孕妇中有30例（16.0%）产后出现肝功能异常。TDF组、LdT组和对照组产后肝功能异常[丙氨酸氨基转移酶（ALT）≥ 2×正常值上限（ULN））]的发生率分别为19.4%、12.5%和16.7%，产后ALT峰值水平中位数（范围）分别为34.5 (12.0～946.0) U/L、37.5 (12.0～733.8) U/L和39.0（7.0～513.0）U/L，两指标在三组间差别均无统计学意义（P值均&gt; 0.05）。三组孕妇产后肝功能异常程度差异无统计学意义（P = 0.944），绝大多数的肝功能异常均为轻中度异常（2×ULN≤ALT &lt; 10×ULN），且通常经抗病毒治疗和/或护肝治疗后好转，也可自行好转。经多因素分析，孕期基线ALT水平是产后肝功能异常的独立影响因素（比值比= 1.031, 95%可信区间为1.005～1.058，P = 0.021），年龄、抗病毒治疗、HBeAg阳性、基线HBV DNA水平、孕次、产次、早产和分娩方式均与产后肝功能异常无显著相关性。 结论： 慢性HBV感染孕妇分娩后停用抗病毒药未明显增加产后肝功能异常的风险，妊娠期ALT水平是产后肝功能异常的影响因素。.
Objective: To analyze the clinical characteristics of hepatic flare and evaluate efficacy of antiviral treatment in pregnant women with chronic HBV infection. Methods: A single-center, open-label, prospective study was conducted, and pregnant women with chronic HBV infection were enrolled. Liver function, HBV serum markers and HBV DNA of pregnant women with chronic HBV infection were reviewed during every 4 to 12 weeks of gestation period. The proportion and clinical characteristics of hepatitis flare during pregnancy were observed. Logistic regression analysis was used to predict hepatic flare in pregnant women with chronic HBV infection. Antiviral therapy with telbivudine (LdT) or tenofovir dipivoxil (TDF) was used to treat hepatic flare during pregnancy. Sequential entecavir (ETV) or TDF was applied after the delivery. Treatment course and drug withdrawal in pregnant women with hepatic flare was the same as those of the general patients with chronic hepatitis B. Liver function, HBV serum markers and HBV DNA were measured in pregnant women with hepatic flare at different time points (4, 12, 24 and 52 weeks). A t-test was used to compare the hepatic flare in pregnant women with and without hepatitis group. HBsAg and HBeAg were used to quantify the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of pregnant women with hepatic flare during pregnancy. Area under the ROC curve was used to calculate the optimal cut-off value corresponding to the maximum sensitivity and specificity of the ROC curve. Results: Of the 220 pregnant women with chronic HBV infection, 55 (25%) had hepatitis flare during pregnancy and received antiviral treatment. Among the 55 women with hepatic flare during gestation, 47 (85.46%) had hepatic flare in the mid-second trimester (12-24 weeks); average peak value of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 220.62 U/L, and the average peak value of ALT in 32 cases (58.18%) of pregnant women with hepatic flare was between 2-5 × ULN. HBsAg and HBeAg quantification were significantly lower in pregnant women with hepatic flare during pregnancy than with non-hepatitis (t = -3.745, P &lt; 0.001; t = -2.186, P = 0.030). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that pregnant women with HBeAg &lt; 3.065 log10 s/co were 7.576 times more likely to have hepatic flare during pregnancy (95% confidence interval: 3.779-15.190). ALT normalization, undetectable HBV DNA levels, HBeAg loss and HBeAg seroconversion in 55 pregnant women with hepatic flare at 52-week treatment was 100% (55/55), 74.55% (41/55), 47.27% (26/55) and 41.82% (23/55), respectively. HBsAg quantification at 52 weeks was significantly lower than baseline HBsAg quantification (3.32 + 0.37) log(10) IU/ml and (3.95 + 0.40) log(10) IU/ml; t = 8.465, P &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Hepatic flare often occurs in the second trimester of pregnancy in pregnant women with chronic HBV infection and baseline HBeAg quantification is an independent predictor of hepatic flare. HBeAg seroconversion rate increased at 52 weeks after antiviral therapy.
目的： 分析慢性HBV感染孕妇妊娠期肝炎发作的临床特点并评价其抗病毒治疗的疗效。 方法： 单中心、前瞻性、开放性临床研究，慢性HBV感染孕妇妊娠期每4～12周复查肝功能、HBV血清标志物和HBV DNA，观察其妊娠期肝炎发作的比例及临床特点，采用logistic回归分析预测慢性HBV感染孕妇妊娠期肝炎发作。妊娠期肝炎发作孕妇应用替比夫定（LdT）或替诺福韦酯（TDF）抗病毒治疗，分娩后换用恩替卡韦（ETV）或继续应用TDF，治疗时间和停药标准同一般慢性乙型肝炎患者。妊娠期肝炎发作孕妇在治疗不同时间点（4、12、24和52周）检测肝功能、HBV血清标志物和HBV DNA。孕妇妊娠期肝炎发作与无肝炎发作组间比较应用t检验。绘制HBsAg和HBeAg定量对孕妇妊娠期肝炎发作的受试者工作特征（ROC）曲线，计算ROC曲线下面积，找出ROC曲线上敏感度和特异度相加最大时对应的最佳界值。 结果： 220例慢性HBV感染孕妇中，55例（25%）孕妇妊娠期肝炎发作并抗病毒治疗。55例妊娠期肝炎发作孕妇中，47例（85.46%）孕妇在妊娠中期（12～24周）肝炎发作，丙氨酸氨基转移酶（ALT）峰值平均值220.62 U/L；32例（58.18%）孕妇的ALT峰值在2～5×正常值上限。妊娠期肝炎发作孕妇入组时HBsAg和HBeAg定量均显著性低于无肝炎发作孕妇入组时HBsAg和HBeAg定量（t = -3.745，P&lt;0.001；t = -2.186，P = 0.030），多因素logistic回归分析中，入组时HBeAg≤3.065 log(10) s/co孕妇是HBeAg&gt;3.065 log(10) S/CO孕妇发生妊娠期肝炎发作风险的7.576倍（95%可信区间：3.779～15.190）。55例妊娠期肝炎发作孕妇抗病毒治疗52周，ALT复常率、HBV DNA阴转率、HBeAg阴转率和HBeAg血清学转换率分别是100%（55/55）、74.55%（41/55）、47.27%（26/55）和41.82%（23/55）；52周HBsAg定量与基线HBsAg定量比较有明显的下降，分别为（3.32±0.37）log(10) IU/ml和（3.95±0.40） log(10) IU/ml，t =8.465，P&lt;0.001，差异有统计学意义。 结论： 慢性HBV感染孕妇妊娠期肝炎发作多发生在妊娠中期，入组时HBeAg定量是孕妇妊娠期肝炎发作独立的预测因素。妊娠期肝炎发作孕妇抗病毒治疗52周HBeAg血清学转换率高。.
Understanding antiretroviral disposition in the male genital tract, a distinct viral compartment, can provide insight for HIV eradication. Population pharmacokinetic modeling was conducted to investigate the disposition of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), and emtricitabine and their metabolites in blood and semen. Blood plasma and seminal plasma (SP) concentrations of tenofovir and emtricitabine, and tenofovir-diphosphate and emtricitabine-triphosphate concentrations in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and seminal mononuclear cells, were measured. Sequential compartmental modeling described drug disposition in blood and semen. Our modeling suggests slower apparent tenofovir-diphosphate PBMC elimination and faster tenofovir SP elimination following TAF administration, compared to TDF, likely reflecting flip-flop kinetics. Additionally, TAF metabolism to TFV appeared slower in semen compared to blood; however, SP elimination of TAF-derived TFV appeared faster than its BP elimination. These findings provide valuable insight for further mechanistic study of cellular entry and drug metabolism in the male genital tract. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
One way to slow the spread of resistant bacteria is by improved stewardship of antibiotics: using them more carefully and reducing the number of prescriptions. With an estimated 7%-10% of antibiotic prescriptions globally originating from dental practices and up to 80% prescribed unnecessarily, dentistry has an important role to play. To support the design of new stewardship interventions through knowledge transfer between contexts, this study aimed to identify factors associated with the decision to prescribe antibiotics to adults presenting with acute conditions across primary care (including dentistry).
Two reviews were undertaken: an umbrella review across primary healthcare and a systematic review in dentistry. Two authors independently selected and quality assessed the included studies. Factors were identified using an inductive thematic approach and mapped to the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Comparisons between dental and other settings were explored. Registration number: PROSPERO_CRD42016037174.
Searches identified 689 publications across primary care and 432 across dental care. Included studies (nine and seven, respectively) were assessed as of variable quality. They covered 46 countries, of which 12 were low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Across the two reviews, 30 factors were identified, with 'patient/condition characteristics', 'patient influence' and 'guidelines &amp; information' the most frequent. Two factors were unique to dental studies: 'procedure possible' and 'treatment skills'. No factor related only to LMICs.
A comprehensive list of factors associated with antibiotic prescribing to adults with acute conditions in primary care settings around the world has been collated and should assist theory-informed design of new context-specific stewardship interventions.
Achieving functional cure of chronic HBV infection (Hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] clearance, eventually followed by acquisition of anti-hepatitis B surface antigen [Anti-HBs]) in individuals with HIV and HBV infections is a rare event. In this setting, factors related to HBV cure have not yet been fully characterized.
HIV-infected individuals with chronic HBV infection enrolled in the French Dat'AIDS cohort (NCT02898987), who started combined antiretroviral (cART)-anti-HBV treatment were retrospectively analyzed for HBsAg loss and Anti-HBs seroconversion.
Overall, 1419 naïve-subjects received three different cART-anti-HBV treatment schedule: (1) 3TC or FTC only (n = 150), (2) TDF with or without 3TC or FTC (n = 489) and (3) 3TC or FTC as first line followed by adding/switching to TDF as second line (n = 780). Individuals were followed-up for a median of 89 months (IQR, 56-118). HBV-DNA was &lt; 15 IU/mL in 91% of individuals at the end of the follow-up. Overall, 97 individuals cleared HBsAg (0.7/100 patient-years), of whom, 67 seroconverted for Anti-HBs (0.5/100 patient-years). A high CD4 nadir, a short delay between HBV diagnosis and treatment, a longer time on HBV therapy, an African origin and TDF-based therapy were independent predictors of HBsAg clearance (Probability of odds ratio [OR]&gt;1, &gt;95%) suggested by Bayesian analysis. Also, TDF-based regimen as first line (OR, 3.03) or second line (OR, 2.95) increased rates of HBsAg clearance compared to 3TC or FTC alone, with a 99% probability.
HBsAg clearance rate was low in HIV-HBV co-infected cART-anti-HBV treated individuals, but was slightly improved on TDF-based regimen.
Tenofovir (TDF) is an inhibitor of reverse transcriptase nucleotide analogue, although it has good tolerability and high anti-retroviral activity, its effect on the kidney has been a concern.
To describe a girl infected with HIV who presented Fanconi syndrome during antiretroviral therapy with TDF.
We describe a HIV-1-infected girl, who after 18 months treatment with TDF presented loss of strength and pain of the lower extremities with functional impairment. Laboratory findings were consistent with Fanconi syndrome. Radiographs showed bilateral hip fracture and wrists. Full recovery of Fanconi syndrome was achieved four months after changing antiretroviral therapy.
TDF-prescribing physicians must be prepared to detect signs and symptoms of renal dysfunction and immediately consider switching to another antiviral drug.
Doravirine is a novel, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) with demonstrated efficacy in treatment-naïve adults with HIV-1.
In this open-label, active-controlled, non-inferiority trial, adults with HIV-1 virologically suppressed for ≥6 months on 2 NRTIs plus a boosted protease inhibitor (PI), boosted elvitegravir, or an NNRTI were randomized (2:1) to switch to once-daily, single-tablet doravirine 100mg with lamivudine 300mg and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300mg (DOR/3TC/TDF) or to continue their current therapy (Baseline Regimen) for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL (FDA Snapshot approach), with the primary comparison between DOR/3TC/TDF at week 48 and Baseline Regimen at week 24, and a secondary comparison between the groups at week 24 (non-inferiority margin, -8%).
670 participants (447 DOR/3TC/TDF, 223 Baseline Regimen) were treated and included in the analyses. At week 24, 93.7% on DOR/3TC/TDF vs 94.6% on Baseline Regimen had HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL (difference -0.9 [-4.7, 3.0]). At week 48, 90.8% on DOR/3TC/TDF had HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL, demonstrating non-inferiority vs Baseline Regimen at week 24 (difference -3.8 [-7.9, 0.3]). In participants on ritonavir-boosted PI at entry, mean reductions in fasting LDL-C and non-HDL-C at week 24 were significantly greater for DOR/3TC/TDF vs Baseline Regimen (p&lt;0.0001). Adverse events occurred in 68.9% on DOR/3TC/TDF and 52.5% on Baseline Regimen by week 24, leading to treatment discontinuation in 2.5% and 0.4%, respectively.
Switching to once-daily DOR/3TC/TDF is a generally well-tolerated option for maintaining viral suppression in patients considering a change in therapy.

HIV viral load (VL) and resistance testing are limited in sub-Saharan Africa, so individuals may have prolonged time on failing first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART). Our objective was to describe the evolution of drug resistance mutations among adults failing first-line ART in Zambia.
We analyzed data from a trial of VL monitoring in Lusaka, Zambia. From 2006 to 2011, 12 randomized sites provided either routine VL monitoring (intervention) or discretionary (control) after ART initiation. Samples were collected prospectively following the same schedule in each arm but analyzed retrospectively in the control group. For those with virologic failure (VF) (&gt;400 copies/mL), HIV genotyping was performed retrospectively on baseline (BL) and on all subsequent specimens until censored due to study completion, withdrawal, or death.
Of 1,973 enrollees, 165 (8.4%) developed VF. 464 genotype results were available including 132 (80%) at BL, 116 (70%) at VF, and 125 (76%) had at least one result between VF and censoring. Major NRTI or NNRTI mutations increased from 26% (BL) to 82% (VF) to 89% at last genotype (LG). M184 mutations increased from 2% to 59% to 71%; K65R from 2% to 11% to 13%; 2 or more TAMs from 1% to 3% to 12%. Among those on a failing TDF-based regimen, TDF resistance increased from 42% to 58%.
We found substantial resistance to NRTIs and NNRTIs at VF with incremental increases after VF while still on a failing first-line ART; this resistance may compromise attainment of the UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals.
Internationally, public health strategies encourage health care professionals to deliver opportunistic behaviour change interventions. The present study: (1) examines the barriers and enablers to delivering interventions during routine consultations, and (2) provides recommendations for the design of interventions to increase delivery of opportunistic behaviour change interventions.
Qualitative interview study.
Twenty-eight semi-structured interviews were conducted with patient-facing health care professionals. The Behaviour Change Wheel informed a framework analysis in which findings were mapped onto the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Intervention functions and behaviour change techniques (BCTs) targeting each TDF domain were identified.
Health care professionals understood the importance of opportunistic behaviour change interventions (beliefs about consequences), but were sceptical about their capabilities to facilitate behaviour change with patients (beliefs about capabilities). Some clinicians were unwilling to discuss behaviours perceived as unrelated to the patient's visit (social/professional role and identity). Discipline-specific tasks were prioritized, and delivering interventions was perceived as psychologically burdensome. One-to-one contact was favoured over busy hospital settings (environmental context and resources). Seven intervention functions (training, restriction, environmental restructuring, enablement, education, persuasion, and modelling) and eight BCT groupings (antecedents, associations, comparison of outcomes, covert learning, feedback and monitoring, natural consequences, reward and threat, and self-belief) were identified.
Across disciplines, health care professionals see the value of opportunistic behaviour change interventions. Barriers related to workload, the clinical environment, competence, and perceptions of the health care professional role must be addressed, using appropriate intervention functions and BCTs, in order to support health care professionals to increase the delivery of interventions in routine practice. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Brief, opportunistic interventions can be a cost effective way of addressing population health problems. Public health policies compel health care professionals to deliver behaviour change interventions opportunistically. Health care professionals do not always deliver interventions opportunistically during routine medical consultations; however the barriers and enablers are currently unclear. What does this study add? This is the first study to examine cross-disciplinary barriers and enablers to delivering opportunistic behaviour change interventions. Across diverse professional groups, working in different medical professions, participants saw the value of delivering opportunistic behaviour change interventions. Targeting key theoretical domains that are shared across professional groups may be useful for increasing the delivery of opportunistic behaviour change interventions.
Long-term treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) has demonstrated suppression of viral replication outside of China. This study aims to assess efficacy, resistance and safety of TDF for up to 240 weeks in Chinese patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.
Patients (HBeAg-positive or HBeAg-negative) who were randomised to receive TDF 300 mg or adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) 10 mg once daily in the 48-week double-blind phase (N = 498) were eligible to enter the open-label TDF phase (TDF-TDF and ADV-TDF groups) for additional 192 weeks.
Overall, 457/512 (89.3%) randomised patients completed 240 weeks of treatment. Virological suppression was achieved in 84.5% and 87.9% in HBeAg-positive patients and 89.6% and 89.5% in HBeAg-negative patients in TDF-TDF and ADV-TDF groups, respectively, at week 240. The majority of patients from both groups had normalized alanine transaminase levels. More patients had HBeAg loss (41.7% vs. 36.4%) and HBeAg seroconversion (32.0% vs. 28.3%) in TDF-TDF than in ADV-TDF group, respectively. Only one HBeAg-positive patient in TDF-TDF group had HBsAg loss at week 240. No evidence of resistance to TDF was observed. The incidence of adverse events was similar in both groups (TDF-TDF, 56.4% vs. ADV-TDF, 51.6%). One patient had serum creatinine elevation ≥ 0.5 mg/dL above baseline, and three patients had confirmed grade 3/4 phosphorus abnormalities (&lt; 2 mg/dL).
In Chinese patients with chronic HBV, long-term treatment with TDF showed sustained viral suppression without development of resistance up to 240 weeks. No new safety concerns were found with TDF in this patient population. Clinical Trial Registration ClinicalTrial.gov Identifier NCT01300234; GSK Clinical Study Register 114648.
Robust data on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence among HIV/hepatitis B virus (HBV)-coinfected individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) are needed to inform HCC screening strategies. We aimed to evaluate the incidence and risk factors of HCC among HIV/HBV-coinfected individuals on tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)-containing ART in a large multi-cohort study.
We included all HIV-infected adults with a positive hepatitis B surface antigen followed in one of four prospective European cohorts. The primary outcome was the occurrence of HCC. Demographic and clinical information was retrieved from routinely collected data, and liver cirrhosis was defined according to results from liver biopsy or non-invasive measurements. Multivariable Poisson regression was used to assess HCC risk factors.
3,625 HIV/HBV-coinfected patients, of whom 72% have initiated TDF-containing ART were included. Over 32,673 patient-years (py), 60 individuals (1.7%) developed an HCC. The incidence of HCC remained stable over time among individuals on TDF, whereas it increased steadily among those not on TDF. Among individuals on TDF, the incidence of HCC was 5.9 per 1,000 py (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.60-9.10) in cirrhotics and 1.17 per 1,000 py (0.56-2.14) among non-cirrhotics. Age at initiation of TDF (adjusted incidence rate ratio per 10 years increase: 2.2, 95% CI 1.6-3.0) and the presence of liver cirrhosis (4.5, 2.3-8.9) were predictors of HCC. Among non-cirrhotic individuals, the incidence of HCC was above the commonly used screening threshold of 2 cases per 1,000 py only in patients aged &gt;46 years at TDF initiation.
Whereas the incidence of HCC was high in cirrhotic HIV/HBV-coinfected individuals, it remained below the HCC screening threshold in patients initiating TDF without cirrhosis at an age &lt;46 years. Lay summary: We investigated the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in HIV/HBV-coinfected individuals from a large multi-cohort study in Europe. Over 32,673 patient-years, 60 individuals (1.7%) developed an HCC. The incidence of HCC remained low in patients initiating TDF without cirrhosis at an age &lt;46 years.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections and sequelae present significant health problems worldwide. Two groups of medications are available for chronic HBV infection treatment: (1) interferons (IFNs) and (2) nucleos(t)ide analogues. This study aimed to evaluate entecavir (ETV) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) efficacies in chronic HBV patients, who achieved virological response during Peg-IFN treatment but did not sustain this response and relapsed a year after treatment end. In this study, 74 patients with chronic HBV infection who had virological responses to 180 μg/week Peg-IFNα-2a treatment were included; 38 (20 and 18 HBeAg positive and negative, respectively) of these patients were treated with 245 mg/day TDF, and 36 (20 and 16 HBeAg positive and negative, respectively) were treated with 0.5 mg/day ETV upon relapse after initial treatment discontinuation. In HBeAg-positive patients biochemical response rates were higher for TDF at weeks 96 and 144 (p = 0.044 and 0.019, respectively). However, biochemical response rates were similar for TDF and ETV in HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative groups at other weeks (p &gt; 0.05). Virological and serological response rates were similar in patients treated with TDF and ETV in HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative groups (p &gt; 0.05).
The optimal management of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with partial virologic response (PVR) to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the long-term efficacy of prolonged TDF therapy in treatment-naïve CHB patients with PVR to TDF therapy in real practice.
We retrospectively investigated the efficacy of prolonged TDF therapy in treatment-naïve CHB patients with PVR to TDF. PVR was defined as a decrease in serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA over 2 log10 IU/mL from baseline, with detectable HBV DNA by real-time polymerase chain reaction at week 48.
We included 232 patients who underwent TDF therapy for over 48 weeks. Forty-two patients (18.1%) showed PVR. In multivariate analysis, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positivity, and high levels of serum HBV DNA at baseline and week 12 were independent predictive factors for PVR during TDF therapy. Out of 42 patients with PVR, 39 (92.9%) achieved virologic response (VR) during continuous TDF treatment; the cumulative VR rates at 24, 36, and 48 months were 79.8%, 88.2%, and 95.6%, respectively. With an additional 12 months of therapy, VR was achieved in 28/31 (90.3%) patients with HBV DNA &lt; 100 IU/mL, compared to 5/11 (45.5%) patients with HBV DNA ≥ 100 IU/mL, at week 48.
The vast majority of patients achieved VR through prolonged TDF therapy, thus TDF treatment can be maintained in nucleos(t)ide-naïve patients with PVR at week 48, especially in those with low viremia.
Which antiviral agent between entecavir (ETV) vs. tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is superior in improving prognosis for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is unclear. Here, we assessed the ability of these two antivirals to prevent liver-disease progression in treatment-naïve CHB patients.
From 2012 to 2014, treatment-naïve CHB patients who received ETV or TDF as a first-line antiviral agent were recruited from four academic teaching hospitals. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at enrollment were excluded. Cumulative probabilities of HCC and death or orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) were assessed.
In total, 2,897 patients (1,484 and 1,413 in the ETV and TDF groups, respectively) were recruited. The annual HCC incidence was statistically not different between the ETV and TDF groups (1.92 vs. 1.69 per 100 person-years [PY], respectively; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.975 [p=0.852] by multivariate analysis). Propensity score (PS)-matched and inverse probability of treatment weighting (ITPW) analyses yielded similar patterns of results (HR, 1.021 [p=0.884] and 0.998 [p=0.988], respectively). The annual incidence of death or OLT was statistically not different between the ETV and TDF groups (0.52 vs. 0.53 per 100PY, respectively; adjusted HR, 1.202 [p=0.451]). PS-matched and ITPW analyses yielded similar patterns of results (HR, 1.248 [p=0.385] and 1.239 [p=0.360], respectively). These findings were consistently reproduced in patients with compensated cirrhosis (all p&gt;0.05).
The overall prognosis in terms of HCC and death or OLT were statistically not different between the ETV and TDF groups. Further studies are needed to validate our results. LAY SUMMARY: - Which antiviral agent between entecavir (ETV) vs. tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is superior in improving prognosis for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is unclear. - The overall prognosis in terms of HCC and death or OLT was statistically not different between the ETV and TDF groups.
Evidence supports the integration of geriatric assessment in the care of older adults with cancer. The G8 screening tool is a validated instrument to target a geriatric assessment. Use of the G8 tool in clinical practice, however, is suboptimal. We systematically analyzed the barriers and facilitators to G8 tool use in oncology clinics and selected interventions tailored to the local context to enhance its uptake.
This qualitative study used semistructured interviews and site observations.
St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Canada.
Ten participants including G8 tool adopters and stakeholders at St. Michael's Hospital were interviewed.
An interview guide based on the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) was developed to identify beliefs about G8 tool use. Barriers and facilitators to G8 tool use were mapped to the TDF domains and corresponding intervention functions from the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, and Behavior model. Evidence-based implementation strategies were selected from two databases.
Key TDF domains influencing G8 tool use behavior were social/professional role, goals, beliefs about consequences, and social influences. The behavior change domains were mapped to four mechanisms of change: persuasion (conduct local consensus discussions), modeling (identify and prepare a champion), education (distribute educational materials), and enablement (use materials to prepare patients to be active participants in understanding the evidence behind the G8 tool and answering questions accurately).
This study identified barriers to G8 tool use. Local consensus discussions, identifying and preparing a champion, using educational materials, and preparing patients to be active participants may be implementation strategies to improve G8 tool use. J Am Geriatr Soc 67:898-904, 2019.
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is an important component of antiretroviral therapy (ART) that has been widely used. The aim of this study was to observe the long-term impact of TDF-based ART on lipid metabolism profiles and renal functions in Chinese patients.
414 and 124 HIV-infected, ART-naïve patients who initiated TDF-based regimens and non-TDF regimens respectively were retrospectively included. Demographic characteristics and clinical information of each patient was collected. Changes of lipid profiles and renal function, as well as the risk factors of hyperlipidemia and renal dysfunction were analyzed.
After 96 weeks of ART, HIV viral loads were undetectable in 97.34% (403/414) of patients exposed to TDF. The plasma total cholesterol (TCH) increased from 3.97 ± 0.83 mmol/L to 4.53 ± 0.87 mmol/L (P &lt; 0.001), which did not show a significant difference comparing with non-TDF exposed group. By contrast, the plasma triglyceride (TG) levels increased, but were still lower than that in non-TDF exposed group (0.26 ±1.24 vs. 0.89 ± 1.78, P &lt; 0.001). The mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decreased from 127.29 ± 24.04ml∙min-1∙1.73 m-2 at baseline to 118.84 ± 22.74 ml∙min-1∙1.73 m-2(P &lt; 0.001) in TDF exposed group, while it increased in non-TDF exposed group. In TDF group, high body mass index (BMI) (OR=1.13, P = 0.01), high baseline TG (OR=2.33, P&lt;0.001) and receiving protease inhibitors (PIs) (OR = 7.58, P &lt; 0.001) were associated with hypertriglyceridemia after ART, while high baseline TCH predicted hypercholesterolemia (OR=3.58, P&lt;0.001). MSM (OR = 0.22, P = 0.02) and baseline eGFR (OR = 0.90, P &lt; 0.001) was associated renal dysfunction after ART.
TDF-based regimens are of good therapeutic effect among Chinese. These regimens showed better plasma lipid profile but mild renal dysfunction as compared to non-TDF based regimens. Patients with high BMI, high baseline TG, high baseline TCH and low baseline eGFR should be closely monitored when using TDF-based ART.
With over 3 million US prostate cancer survivors, ensuring high-quality, coordinated cancer survivorship care is important. However, implementation of recommended team-based cancer care has lagged, and determinants of quality care across primary and specialty care remain unclear. Guided by the theoretical domains framework (TDF), we explored multidisciplinary determinants of quality survivorship care in an integrated delivery system.
We conducted semistructured interviews with primary (4) and specialty (7) care providers across 6 Veterans Health Administration clinic sites. Using template analysis, we coded interview transcripts into the TDF, mapping statements to specific constructs within each domain. We assessed whether each construct was perceived a barrier or facilitator, examining results for both primary care providers (PCPs) and prostate cancer specialists.
Cancer specialists and PCPs identified 2 primary TDF domains impacting their prostate cancer survivorship care: Knowledge and Environmental context and resources. Both groups noted knowledge (about survivorship care) and procedural knowledge (about how to deliver survivorship care) as positive determinants or facilitators, whereas resources/material resources (to deliver survivorship care) was noted as a negative determinant or barrier to care. Additional domains more commonly referenced by cancer specialists included Social/professional role and identity and Goals, while PCPs reported the domain Beliefs about capabilities as relevant.
We used the TDF to identify several behavioral domains acting as determinants of high-quality, team-based prostate cancer survivorship care. These results can inform prostate cancer survivorship care plan content, and may guide tailored, multidisciplinary implementation strategies to improve survivorship care across the primary and specialty care interface.
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of telbivudine (LdT) and tenofovir (TDF) for preventing hepatitis B virus (HBV) vertical transmission for HBV-positive pregnant women.Pregnant women (n = 145) from January 2013 to June 2017 were enrolled when they met inclusion criteria, which included HBV DNA ≥1.0 × 10 copies/mL and increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. Groups A (n = 58) and B (n = 51) were treated with LdT and TDF, respectively. Group C (n = 36) received no antiviral treatment. All infants were vaccinated with hepatitis B immunoglobulin and HBV vaccine. Vertical transmission of HBV was indicated by the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in infants 6 months and 12 months after birth.There is no difference of clinical characteristics of patients among the 3 groups. Serum HBV DNA levels of the 3 groups were similar at baseline (Group A vs. Group B vs. Group C, 7.88 ± 0.65 vs. 7.91 ± 0.75 vs. 7.69 ± 0.53 P = .25). In addition, the after anti-HBV treatment in Groups A and B were significantly decreased. Also, the serum HBV DNA levels in both Groups A and B were lower than that of Group C (P &lt; .01, both). The HBV infection rate in Group A treated with LdT was not different from Group B treated with TDF. The dynamic changes of serum ALT level were similar. ALT levels were similar among the 3 Groups (P = .171), while there is statistically significant difference between A and C, and between B and C before delivery (P &lt; .01). For the infants, there were no significant differences among body weight, height, head circumference, or Apgar score. However, the HBsAg positivity rates of infants in Groups A, B, C at postpartum 24 weeks and 48 weeks was 0%, 0%, and 11.1%, respectively (P &lt; .001).Administration of LdT or TDF to HBV-infected mothers are effective and safe to block mother-to-infant HBV transmission.
Tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) in dried blood spots (DBS) is associated with viral suppression in persons living with HIV (PLWH) taking tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). However, its value as a predictor of future viremia remains unknown.
Blood for plasma HIV viral load (VL) and TFV-DP in DBS were prospectively collected (up to 3 visits within 48 weeks) in PLWH on TDF. TFV-DP cut points were selected using logistic prediction models maximizing the area under the receiver operation characteristic curve, and the estimated adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of future viremia (≥20 copies/mL) were compared to the highest TFV-DP category.
Among 451 participants included in the analysis, the aOR of future viremia for participants with TFV-DP &lt;800 and 800 to &lt;1650 fmol/punch were 4.7 (95% CI 2.6, 8.7; p&lt;0.0001) and 2.1 (95% CI 1.3, 3.3; p=0.002) vs. ≥1650 fmol/punch, respectively. These remained significant for participants who were virologically-suppressed at the time of the study visit (4.2, 95% CI 1.5, 12.0; p=0.007 and 2.2, 95% CI 1.2, 4,0; p=0.01).
TFV-DP in DBS predicts future viremia in PLWH on TDF, even in those who are virologically-suppressed. This highlights the utility of this biomarker to inform about adherence beyond HIV VL.
Fifty years of research (1968-2018) toward the identification of selective antiviral drugs have been primarily focused on antiviral compounds active against DNA viruses (HSV, VZV, CMV, HBV) and retroviruses (HIV). For the treatment of HSV infections the aminoacyl esters of acyclovir were designed, and valacyclovir became the successor of acyclovir in the treatment of HSV and VZV infections. BVDU (brivudin) still stands out as the most potent among the marketed compounds for the treatment of VZV infections (i.e., herpes zoster). In the treatment of HIV infections 10 tenofovir-based drug combinations have been marketed, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) have also proved effective in the treatment of HBV infections. As a spin-off of our anti-HIV research, a CXCR4 antagonist AMD-3100 was found to be therapeutically useful as a stem cell mobilizer, and has since 10 years been approved for the treatment of some hematological malignancies.
Emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (FTC/TAF) (200 mg/10 mg and 200 mg/25 mg) is a fixed-dose combination of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) indicated for use in combination with other antiretroviral therapies (ARTs) for the treatment of HIV type 1 infection in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older (and weighing ≥ 35 kg). It is available as 200 mg/10 mg and 200 mg/25 mg film-coated tablets; the recommended dose is one 200 mg/10 mg tablet daily when used in combination with a ritonavir‐ or cobicistat (COBI)-boosted protease inhibitor. Otherwise, the recommended dose is one 200 mg/25 mg tablet daily. The manufacturer submitted a price of $28.57 per tablet regardless of strength, which is slightly lower (by $0.51) than the unit cost of FTC/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), the backbone component that FTC/TAF is expected to replace. The manufacturer is requesting that FTC/TAF be listed in combination with other ARTs for treatment of treatment‐naive and virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older.
Compared with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) has been associated with improvement in markers of renal dysfunction in individual randomised trials; however the comparative incidence of clinically significant renal events remains unclear.
We used a pooled data approach to increase the person-years of drug exposure analysed, maximizing our ability to detect differences in clinically significant outcomes.
We pooled clinical renal safety data across 26 treatment naïve and antiretroviral switch studies in order to compare the incidence of proximal renal tubulopathy (PRT) and discontinuation due to renal adverse events (AEs) between participants taking TAF-containing regimens versus those taking TDF-containing regimens. We performed secondary analyses from seven large randomised studies (two treatment-naïve and five switch studies) to compare incidence of renal AEs, treatment-emergent proteinuria, changes in serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, and urinary biomarkers (albumin, beta-2-microglobulin, and retinol binding protein to creatinine ratios).
Our integrated analysis included 9,322 adults and children with HIV (n = 6360 TAF, n = 2962 TDF) with exposure of 12,519 person-years to TAF and 5947 to TDF. There were no cases of PRT in participants receiving TAF versus 10 cases in those receiving TDF (p &lt; 0.001), and fewer individuals on TAF (3/6360) versus TDF (14/2962) (p &lt; 0.001) discontinued due to a renal AE. Participants initiating TAF- vs. TDF-based regimens had more favourable changes in renal biomarkers through 96 weeks of therapy.
These pooled data from 26 studies, with over 12,500 person-years of follow-up in children and adults, support the comparative renal safety of TAF over TDF.
We herein present the case of a 66-year-old Japanese man with Fanconi's syndrome. He had been receiving adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) for the treatment of entecavir (ETV)-resistant chronic hepatitis B (CHB) for four years in his 8-year treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but was referred to our hospital after increased levels of bone pain in his ribs, knees, and ankles. Renal dysfunction, hypophosphatemia, and increased levels of bone alkaline phosphatase were found by a hematology test after admission for treatment of HCC. Radiography and 99m Tc-labeled hydroxymethylene diphosphonate (HMDP) scintigraphy revealed multiple insufficiency fractures in the ribs, knees, ankles, and heels. After switching from ADV to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and treatment with calcitriol and sodium dihydrogenphosphate, the patient's serum phosphate levels slightly increased and renal dysfunction did not improve, but after six months his clinical symptoms disappeared. To detect and prevent adverse effects from ADV, physicians and pharmacists should carefully monitor renal function and serum phosphate levels in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) treated for a long time with ADV.
One strategy to treat chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection could be to increase the functions of virus-specific T cells. We performed a multicenter phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GS-4774, a yeast-based therapeutic vaccine engineered to express HBV antigens, given with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) to untreated patients with chronic HBV infection.
We performed an open-label study at 34 sites in Canada, Italy, New Zealand, Romania, South Korea and United States from July 2014 to August 2016. Adults who were positive for HB surface antigen (HBsAg) &gt; 6 months and levels of HBV DNA ≥2000 IU/mL who had not received antiviral treatment for HBV within 3 months of screening were randomly assigned (1:2:2:2) to groups given oral TDF 300 mg daily alone (n=27; controls) or with 2, 10, or 40 yeast units GS-4774 (n=168), administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks until week 20 for a total of 6 doses. Blood samples were collected and analyzed and patients received regular physical examinations. Efficacy was measured by decrease in HBsAg from baseline to week 24. Specific responses to HBV (production of IFNG, TNF, and IL2 and degranulation) were measured in T cells derived from 12 HBeAg-negative patients with genotype D infections, after overnight or 10 days stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with peptides from the entire HBV proteome. T-regulatory cells were analyzed for frequency and phenotype. Data from studies of immune cells were compared with data on reductions in HBsAg, HBV-DNA, and alanine aminotransferase in blood samples from patients.
GS-4774 was safe and well-tolerated but did not produce significant decreases in levels of HBsAg. Production of interferon gamma (IFNG), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin 2 (IL2) increased significantly at weeks 24 and 48, compared to baseline, in HBV-specific CD8+ T cells from patients given GS 4774 but not from controls. GS-4774 had greater effects on CD8+ than CD4+ T cells, which were not affected at all or very weakly by TDF with or without GS-4774. GS-4774 did not affect responses of T cells to other viruses tested. HBV core peptides induced the greatest production of IFNG by T cells following overnight stimulation, whereas HBV envelope antigens did not induce a response. Following 10 days stimulation, production of IFNG and TNF increased with time of exposure to GS-4774; the greatest levels of responses were to HBV envelope antigens followed by core and polymerase peptides. We observed a correlation in patients given GS-4774 between increased T-cell functions and reductions in numbers of T-regulatory cells.
In a phase 2 study of patients with chronic HBV infection given TDF with or without GS-4774, we found that vaccination can increase production of IFNG, TNF, and IL2 by CD8+ T cells exposed to antigenic peptides, with little effect on CD4+ T cells. Although GS-4774 did not reduce levels of HBsAg in patients, its strong immune stimulatory effect on CD8+ T cells might be used in combination with other antiviral agents to boost the anti-virus immune response.

China has continued to expand antiretroviral therapy (ART) services and optimise ART guidelines in an effort to significantly reduce and prevent mortality and transmission rates among HIV patients. However, no study to date has compared treatment outcomes of initial differential antiretroviral regimens among HIV patients in a real-world setting in China. This study aimed to compare the effects of different ART regimens on treatment outcomes among adults.
Observational retrospective cohort study.
Data from 2011 to 2013 in Guangxi, China.
Patients aged ≥18 years (n=25 732) were selected.
A total of 25 732 patients were included in this study. The average mortality and attrition rate were 2.64 and 4.98, respectively, per 100 person-years. Using Cox proportional hazard models, zidovudine-based (AZT-based) regimen versus stavudine-based (D4T-based) regimen had an adjusted HR (AHR) for death of 0.65 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.73); the AHR of tenofovir-based (TDF-based) versus D4T-based regimens was 0.81 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.92), and of lopinavir-ritonavir-based (LPV/r-based) versus D4T-based regimens, 1.19 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.37). AZT-based versus D4T-based regimens had an AHR for dropout of 0.89 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.97); this ratio for TDF-based versus D4T-based regimens was 0.88 (95% CI 0.80 to 0.98), and for LPV/r-based versus D4T-based regimens, 1.42 (95% CI 1.27 to 1.58). AZT-based and TDF-based regimens had a lower risk compared with D4T-based regimens, while LPV/r-based regimens had a higher risk. High gastrointestinal reactions and poor adherence were observed among HIV patients whose initial ART regimen was LPV/r-based.
Our study found that the treatment outcomes of initial ART regimens that were AZT-based or TDF-based were significantly better than D4T-based or LPV/r-based regimens. This finding could be related to the higher rates of gastrointestinal reactions and poorer adherence associated with the LPV/r-based regimens compared with other initial ART regimens.
This study aims to investigate the prevalence and types of drug resistance mutations among patients failing first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART).
Plasma samples from 112 patients with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) were collected for virus RNA extract and gene amplification. The mutations related to drug resistance were detected and the incidence was statistically analyzed, and the drug resistance rate against common drugs was also evaluated.
103 cases were successfully amplified, and the main drug resistance mutations in the reverse transcriptase (RT) region were M184V (50.49%), K103N (28.16%), Y181C (25.24%), and K65R (27.18%), while no drug main resistance mutation was found in the protease (PR) region. The incidence of drug resistance mutations was significantly different among patients with different ages, routes of infection, duration of treatment, initial ART regimens and viral load. The drug resistance rate to the common drugs was assessed, including Efavirenz (EFV, 71.84%), Nevirapine (NVP, 74.76%), Lamivudine (3TC, 66.02%), Zidovudine (AZT, 4.85%), Stavudine (D4T, 16.51%), and Tenofovir (TDF, 21.36%).
The drug resistance mutations to NRTIs and NNRTIs are complex and highly prevalent, which was the leading cause of first-line ART failure. This study provides significant theoretical support for developing the second-line and third-line therapeutic schemes.
In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) use from 28 weeks gestational age to 2 months postpartum to prevent mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus, there was no significant effect of maternal TDF use on maternal or infant bone mineral density 1 year after delivery/birth. Clinical Trials Registration. NCT01745822.
Rilpivirine (RPV) has a better lipid profile than efavirenz (EFV) in naïve patients (1). Switching to RPV may be convenient for many patients, while maintaining a good immunovirological control (2). The aim of this study was to analyze lipid changes in HIV-patients at 24 weeks after switching to Eviplera® (emtricitabine/RPV/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [FTC/RPV/TDF]).
Retrospective, multicentre study of a cohort of asymptomatic HIV-patients who switched from a regimen based on 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI)+protease inhibitor (PI)/non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or ritonavir boosted PI monotherapy to Eviplera® during February-December, 2013; all had undetectable HIV viral load for ≥3 months prior to switching. Patients with previous failures on antiretroviral therapy (ART) including TDF and/or FTC/3TC, with genotype tests showing resistance to components of Eviplera®, or who had changed the third drug of the ART during the study period were excluded. Changes in lipid profile and cardiovascular risk (CVR), and efficacy and safety at 24 weeks were analyzed.
Among 305 patients included in the study, 298 were analyzed (7 cases were excluded due to lack of data). Men 81.2%, mean age 44.5 years, 75.8% of HIV sexually transmitted. 233 (78.2%) patients switched from a regimen based on 2 NRTI+NNRTI (90.5% EFV/FTC/TDF). The most frequent reasons for switching were central nervous system (CNS) adverse events (31.0%), convenience (27.6%) and metabolic disorders (23.2%). At this time, 293 patients have reached 24 weeks: 281 (95.9%) have continued Eviplera®, 6 stopped it (3 adverse events, 2 virologic failures, 1 discontinuation) and 6 have been lost to follow up. Lipid profiles of 283 cases were available at 24 weeks and mean (mg/dL) baseline vs 24 weeks are: total cholesterol (193 vs 169; p=0.0001), HDL-c (49 vs 45; p=0.0001), LDL-c (114 vs 103; p=0.001), tryglycerides (158 vs 115; p=0.0001), total cholesterol to HDL-c ratio (4.2 vs 4.1; p=0.3). CVR decreased (8.7 vs 7.5%; p= 0.0001). CD4 counts were similar to baseline (653 vs 674 cells/µL; p=0.08), and 274 (96.8%) patients maintained viral suppression.
At 24 weeks after switching to Eviplera®, lipid profile and CVR improved while maintaining a good immunovirological control. Most subjects switched to Eviplera® from a regimen based on NNRTI, mainly EFV/FTC/TDF. CNS adverse events, convenience and metabolic disorders were the most frequent reasons for switching.
Nevirapine (NVP) induces cytochrome P450 3A4 by which rilpivirine (RPV) is metabolized. Switching NVP to RPV could result in decreased RPV exposure with subsequent virological failure and dyslipidemia because NVP is regarded as the least dyslipidemic, non-nucleoside, reverse transcriptase inhibitor. This trial evaluated the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, safety and cardiovascular risks of switching NVP to RPV.
Prospective open label controlled trial. HIV-1 patients with HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL on once daily NVP, emtricitabine/tenofovir (FTC/TDF) switched to single tablet RPV/FTC/TDF. Eligible patients on NVP, FTC/TDF were controls. Primary endpoint was week 12 HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL by intention to treat analysis. Secondary endpoints were week 24 HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL, NVP and RPV pharmacokinetics, safety and fasting lipids, Framingham risk scores (FRS) and Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP-III) lipid goals.
Of 189 eligible patients, we included 50 RPV switchers and 139 NVP controls. Week 12 HIV-RNA was &lt;50 copies/mL in 46/50 switchers (92.0%) which was not different from the hypothesized 90% week 12 suppression rate (p=.431). Forty-four of 50 switchers had week 24 HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL compared to 126/139 controls (difference: 2.6%, 95% CI -7.6% to 12.8%, p=.593). NVP plasma concentrations were below detection level in all at week 3. Mean week 1 RPV trough concentration was 0.083 mg/L and comparable to phase III trial data (p=0.747). Adverse events occurred in 36 switchers, the majority (82.0%) were grade one. Two switchers discontinued RPV for side effects. Significant changes over 24 weeks (p&lt;0.001) were observed in switchers on total cholesterol (TC, -0.67 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.50 to 0.83), low density lipoprotein (LDL)-C (-0.36, 95% CI -0.21 to -0.51) and high density lipoprotein (HDL)-C (-0.28, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.35). The TC/HDL-C ratio increased 0.20 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.37; p=.029) and systolic blood pressure decreased 6.0 mmHg (95% CI -1.7 to -10.3; p=.007). The median FRS did not change over 24 weeks (8.4% vs. 7.7%; p=.119). More patients achieved LDL-C (+15%; p=.016) and TC (+25%; p&lt;0.001) ATP-III treatment goals at week 24 on RPV.
A NVP to RPV switch does not influence RPV exposure and results in adequate ongoing HIV-1 suppression. RPV could be an option for patients at risk for cardiovascular diseases.
Emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir (EVP) is a fixed-dose combination of antiretrovirals (ARV) approved by the European Medicines Agency in November 2011 and introduced in Italy in February 2013. It is a once-a-day single tablet and is licensed in Europe for use only in ARV-naïve patients with a viral load (VL) ≤100,000 copies/mL.
To identify factors that may be associated with the use of EVP as first-line regimen in HIV-infected individuals starting cART from ARV-naïve in Italy.
Clinical sites in ICONA Foundation Study in which ≥1 person had started EVP were selected for this analysis. From these we included all patients who started an EVP-based cART regimen as well as those starting other cART regimens after the date of introduction of EVP at the site (after February 2013 in any case) and with a VL ≤100,000 copies/mL from ARV-naïve. Characteristics at the time of starting cART were compared using chi-square test and unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression analysis. Factors investigated included: gender, mode of HIV transmission, time from HIV diagnosis, CD4 count, nation of birth, AIDS, HCV-status, age, CD8 count, VL, diabetes, smoking, total and HDL cholesterol, eGFR, blood glucose, level of education and employment and site location. Factors showing unadjusted associations with a p-value of 10% or smaller, were retained in the multivariable model.
We identified 183 patients starting EVP and 173 starting the control regimen from 23 sites. The number of patients starting EVP included at each site ranged from 1 to 12 and the number of those starting the control regimen was similar. The most frequently used drugs in the concurrent group were: TDF (75%), FTC (74%), DRV (39%), ATV/r (26%), LPV/r (9%), EFV (13%) and RAL (14%). In univariable analysis, there were differences in median CD4 count (390 cells/mm(3) in EVP versus 348 in controls, p=0.002), time from HIV diagnosis to starting cART (11 versus 3 months, p=0.001) and prevalence of students (6% versus 3%, p=0.07). No differences were observed for all other factors examined. The table shows estimates of the odds ratios (OR) for factors included in the multivariable model.
CD4 count was higher in EVP-treated patients compared to controls. Guidelines suggest avoiding initiation of EVP in presence of high VL, possibly explaining this residual difference in CD4. There was also a tendency to prescribe EVP to people with perceived lower adherence or hesitant to start or perhaps with a slow progressing disease.
Treatment with ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors and nucleoside analogues frequently leads to rises in lipids, which might increase the cardiovascular risk. The aim of this study was to describe changes in lipid levels among HIV positive patients participating in the GARDEL study.
The GARDEL study compared the efficacy and safety of a dual therapy (DT) combination of LPV/r 400/100 mg BID+3TC 150 mg BID to a triple therapy (TT) with LPV/r 400/100 mg BID+3TC or FTC and a third investigator-selected NRTI in fixed-dose combination among HIV+ treatment naïve patients. We compared changes in lipid levels from baseline to week 48 in both arms.
Patient's characteristics were well balanced regarding mean baseline total cholesterol (157 mg/dL DT, 154 mg/dL TT), triglycerides (142 mg/dL DT, 139 mg/Dl TT), LDL-C (94 mg/dL DT, 91 mg/dL TT) and HDL-C (36 mg/dL DT, 35 mg/dL TT). Changes in total cholesterol, LDL-C and HDL-C were higher in DT arm, compared to TT (32% DT vs 26% TT for cholesterol; 25% DT vs 16% TT for LDL and 33% DT vs 28% TT for HDL). Increase in triglycerides was higher in TT compared to DT (55% DT vs 92% TT) (Table 1). In TT arm LDL-C and total cholesterol elevations were lower among patients receiving TDF compared to those treated with ZDV or ABC.
Changes in lipid parameters were observed in both arms. Albeit the increase was numerically higher for cholesterol (total and LDL-C) in DT arm while TT arm had higher increases in TG; no difference was observed when week 48 values were compared with the NCEP ATP III goals for cardiovascular risk reduction (1). So, the DT strategy, even missing the lipid-lowering effect observed with tenofovir, does not seem to add significant risk to patients treated with this novel strategy.
Previous studies have described improvements on lipid parameters when switching from other antiretroviral drugs to tenofovir (TDF) and impairments in lipid profile when discontinuing TDF. [1-3] It is unknown, however, if TDF has an intrinsic lipid-lowering effect or such findings are due to the addition or removal of other offending agents or other reasons.
This was a randomized, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (NCT 01458977). Subjects with HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL during at least 6 months on stable DRV/r (800/100 mg QD) or LPV/r (400/100 mg BID) monotherapy, with confirmed fasting total cholesterol ≥200 or LDL-cholesterol ≥130 mg/dL and not taking lipid-lowering drugs were randomized to (A) adding TDF/FTCduring 12 weeks followed by 24 weeks without TDF/FTC, or (B) continuing without TDF/FTC for 12 weeks, adding TDF/FTC for 12 weeks and then withdrawing TDF/FTC for 12 additional weeks. Randomization was stratified by DRV/r or LPV/r use at study entry. All subjects received a specific dietary counselling. Primary endpoints were changes in median fasting total, LDL and HDL-cholesterol 12 weeks after TDF/FTC addition. Analyses were performed by ITT.
46 subjects with a median age of 43 (40-48) years were enrolled in the study: 70% were male, 56% received DRV/r and 44% LPV/r. One subject withdrew the study voluntarily at week 4 and another one interrupted due to diarrhoea at week 24. Treatment with TDF/FTC decreased total, LDL and HDL-cholesterol from 235.9 to 204.9 (p&lt;0.001), 154.7 to 127.6 (p&lt;0.001) and 50.3 to 44.5 mg/dL (p&lt;0.001), respectively. In comparison, total, LDL and HDL-cholesterol levels remained stable during placebo exposure. Week 12 total cholesterol (p&lt;0.001), LDL-cholesterol (p&lt;0.001) and HDL-cholesterol (p=0.011) levels were significantly lower in TDF/FTC versus placebo. Treatment with TDF/FTC reduced the fraction of subjects with abnormal fasting total-cholesterol (≥200 mg/dL) from 86.7% to 56.8% (p=0.001) and LDL-cholesterol (≥130 mg/dL) from 87.8% to 43.9% (p&lt;0.001), which was not observed with placebo. There were no virological failures, and CD4 and triglyceride levels remained stable regardless of exposure.
Coformulated TDF/FTC has an intrinsic lipid-lowering effect, likely attributable to TDF.
A network meta-analysis can provide estimates of relative efficacy for treatments not directly studied in head-to-head randomized controlled trials. We estimated the relative efficacy and safety of dolutegravir (DTG) versus third agents currently recommended by guidelines, including ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (ATV/r), ritonavir-boosted darunavir (DRV/r), efavirenz (EFV), cobicistat-boosted elvitegravir (EVG/c), ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r), raltegravir (RAL), and rilpivirine (RPV), in treatment-naive HIV-1-infected patients.
A systematic review of published literature was conducted to identify phase 3/4 randomized controlled clinical trials (up to August 2013) including at least one third agent of interest in combination with a backbone nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) regimen. Bayesian fixed-effect network meta-analysis models adjusting for the type of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine [TDF/FTC] or abacavir/lamivudine [ABC/3TC]) were used to evaluate week 48 efficacy (HIV-RNA suppression to &lt;50 copies/mL and change in CD4+ cells/µL) and safety (lipid changes, adverse events, and discontinuations due to adverse events) of DTG relative to all other treatments. Sensitivity analyses assessing the impact of NRTI treatment adjustment and random-effects models were performed.
Thirty-one studies including 17,000 patients were combined in the analysis. Adjusting for the effect of NRTI backbone, treatment with DTG resulted in significantly higher odds of virologic suppression (HIV RNA&lt;50 copies/mL) and increase in CD4+ cells/µL versus ATV/r, DRV/r, EFV, LPV/r, and RPV. Dolutegravir had better or equivalent changes in total cholesterol, LDL, triglycerides, and lower odds of adverse events and discontinuation due to adverse events compared to all treatments. Random-effects and unadjusted models resulted in similar conclusions.
Three clinical trials of DTG have demonstrated comparable or superior efficacy and safety to DRV, RAL, and EFV in HIV-1-infected treatment-naive patients. This network meta-analysis suggests DTG is also favorable or comparable to other commonly used third agents (ATV/r, LPV/r, RPV, and EVG/c).
NRTI-sparing regimens may avoid long-term mitochondrial, bone and renal toxicities and maintain viral suppression.
In the RADAR study, 85 antiretroviral-naïve HIV-infected patients were randomized to receive either raltegravir (RAL) (n = 42) or tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) (n = 43), each with ritonavir-boosted darunavir (DRV/r). Virologic efficacy was assessed at weeks 24 and 48. Bone mineral density (BMD) was assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan at baseline and week 48, and bone turnover markers (BTM) assessed at weeks 0, 16 and 48.
Using an intention-to-treat analysis, 62.5% of RAL subjects and 83.7% of TDF/FTC subjects were responders (VL&lt;48 copies/mL) at week 48 (p = 0.045; chi-square test). The proportions of patients achieving VL&lt;200 copies/mL were similar: 72.5% and 86.0% (p = 0.175). Premature treatment discontinuation was the main cause for failure. No treatment-emergent resistance was observed. Changes from baseline in RAL vs. TDF/FTC for CD4+ (+199 vs. +216 cells/µL, p = 0.63), total cholesterol/HDL (-0.25 vs. -0.71 mg/dL (p = 0.270), and eGFR (-4.4 vs. -7.9 ml/min, p = 0.44) were comparable between groups. Changes in subtotal BMD to week 48 were: +9.2 with RAL vs. -7 g/cm2 with TDF/FTC (p = 0.002). Mean CTX changes were +0.04 vs. +0.24 ng/mL (p = 0.001), and mean P1NP changes were +3.59 vs. +30.09 ng/mL (p = 0.023). BTM changes at week 16 predicted change in BMD by week 48 (R = -0.394, p = 0.003 for CTX; and R = -0.477, p&lt;0.001 for P1NP).
The NRTI-sparing regimen RAL+DRV/r did not achieve similar week 48 virologic efficacy compared with TDF/FTC+DRV/r, but was better with regard to markers of bone health.

Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter, active-controlled study.
Antiretroviral naive adults with HIV-1 RNA ≥5000 copies per milliliter and a CD4 count ≥50 cells per microliter were randomized 2:1 to receive an STR of elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (E/C/F/TAF) or elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (E/C/F/TDF), plus placebo for 48 weeks.
Patients on both E/C/F/TAF (n = 112) and E/C/F/TDF (n = 58) had high rates of virologic suppression (&lt;50 HIV copies per milliliter) at week 24 (86.6%; 89.7%) and at week 48 (88.4%; 87.9%), and had similar improvements in CD4 at week 48 (177; 204), respectively. Both treatments were well tolerated, and most adverse events were self-limiting and of mild to moderate severity. Compared with patients on E/C/F/TDF, patients on E/C/F/TAF had smaller reductions in estimated creatinine clearance (-5.5 vs. -10.1 mL/min, P = 0.041), significantly less renal tubular proteinuria, and smaller changes in bone mineral density for hip (-0.62% vs. -2.39%, P &lt; 0.001) and spine (-1.00% vs. -3.37%, P &lt; 0.001). Patients on E/C/F/TAF had higher increases in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein, but the total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein ratio was unchanged for both.
Treatment-naive patients given the STR that contained either TAF or TDF achieved a high rate of virologic success. Compared with those receiving TDF, patients on E/C/F/TAF experienced significantly smaller changes in estimated creatinine clearance, renal tubular proteinuria, and bone mineral density.
Simplification of antiretroviral therapy in patients with suppressed viremia may minimize long-term adverse effects. The study's primary objective was to determine whether abacavir/lamivudine + atazanavir (ABC/3TC+ATV) was virologically non-inferior to tenofovir/emtricitabine + atazanavir/ritonavir (TDF/FTC+ATV/r) over 24 weeks in a population of virologically suppressed, HIV-1 infected patients.
This open-label, multicenter, non-inferiority study enrolled antiretroviral experienced, HIV-infected adults currently receiving a regimen of TDF/FTC+ATV/r for ≥ 6 months with no history of virologic failure and whose HIV-1 RNA had been ≤ 75 copies/mL on 2 consecutive measurements including screening. Patients were randomized 1 ∶ 2 to continue current treatment or simplify to ABC/3TC+ATV.
The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with HIV-RNA&lt;50 copies/mL at Week 24 by the Time to Loss of Virologic Response (TLOVR) algorithm. Secondary endpoints included alternative measures of efficacy, adverse events (AEs), and fasting lipids. Exploratory endpoints included inflammatory, coagulation, bone, and renal biomarkers.
After 24 weeks, ABC/3TC+ATV (n = 199) was non-inferior to TDF/FTC+ATV/r (n = 97) by both the primary analysis (87% in both groups) and all secondary efficacy analyses. Rates of grade 2-4 AEs were similar between the two groups (40% vs 37%, respectively), but an excess of hyperbilirubinemia made the rate of grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities higher in the TDF/FTC+ATV/r group (30%) compared with the ABC/3TC+ATV group (13%). Lipid levels were stable except for HDL cholesterol, which increased significantly in the ABC/3TC+ATV group. Bone and renal biomarkers improved significantly between baseline and Week 24 in patients taking ABC/3TC+ATV, and the difference between groups was significant at Week 24. No significant changes occurred in any inflammatory or coagulation biomarker within or between treatment groups.
After 24 weeks, simplification to ABC/3TC+ATV from TDF/FTC+ATV/r maintained viral suppression was well-tolerated, and led to improvements in bone and renal biomarkers and HDL cholesterol.

Nonionic surfactant vesicles (niosomes) were formulated with an aim of enhancing the oral bioavailability of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), an anti-HIV drug. Niosomes were formulated by conventional thin film hydration technique with different molar ratios of surfactant, cholesterol, and dicetyl phosphate. The formulated niosomes were found spherical in shape, ranging from 2.95 μm to 10.91 μm in size. Vesicles with 1 : 1 : 0.1 ratios of surfactant : cholesterol : dicetyl phosphate with each grade of span were found to have higher entrapment efficiencies, which were further selected for in vitro and in vivo studies. Vesicles formulated with sorbitan monostearate were found to have maximum drug release (99.091%) at the end of 24 hours and followed zero order release kinetics. The results of in vivo study revealed that the niosomes significantly enhanced the oral bioavailability of TDF in rats after a dose of 95 mg/kg. The average relative bioavailability of niosomes in relation to plane drug solution was found to be 2.58, indicating more than twofold increase in oral bioavailability of TDF. Significant increase in mean residential time (MRT) was also found, reflecting release retarding efficacy of the vesicles. In conclusion, niosomes could be a promising delivery for TDF with improved oral bioavailability and prolonged release profiles.
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of antiretroviral simplification from a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor-based regimen [protease inhibitor+RTV+two nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs); ≥6 months of exposure prior to study entry with no prior treatment failure] to the single-tablet regimen (STR) rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (RPV/FTC/TDF) in virologically suppressed, HIV-1-infected participants.
Phase 3b, randomized, open-label, international, 48-week switch study.
Participants were randomized 2 : 1 to switch to RPV/FTC/TDF immediately or stay on their baseline protease inhibitor+RTV+2NRTIs regimen with a delayed switch to RPV/FTC/TDF at week 24. The primary endpoint was noninferiority (12% margin) of RPV/FTC/TDF compared with protease inhibitor+RTV+ two NRTIs in maintaining plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/ml at week 24 by Snapshot analysis.
A total of 476 participants were randomized and received at least one dose of study drug. Demographics and baseline characteristics were similar between arms. The primary objective of noninferiority at week 24 was met: HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/ml by Snapshot analysis, 93.7% of RPV/FTC/TDF versus 89.9% of protease inhibitor+RTV+ two NRTIs (difference 3.8%, 95% confidence interval -1.6 to 9.1%). Through week 48, 89.3% of participants in the immediate switch group maintained virologic suppression. High rates of suppression were maintained with RPV/FTC/TDF regardless of participant's pre-antiretroviral HIV-1 RNA level. Overall development of resistance mutations after switching to RPV/FTC/TDF was low. Decreases in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglycerides were significantly greater among RPV/FTC/TDF recipients than those in the protease inhibitor+RTV+ two NRTIs group.
Switching to the STR RPV/FTC/TDF from an RTV-boosted protease inhibitor regimen in virologically suppressed, HIV-1-infected participants maintained virologic suppression with a low risk of virologic failure, while improving total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides.
Limited comparative, prospective data exist regarding cardiovascular risk factors in HIV-infected women starting antiretroviral therapy in Africa.
In 7 African countries, 741 women with CD4 &lt;200 cells/mm were randomized to tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) plus either nevirapine (NVP, n = 370) or lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r, n = 371). Lipids and blood pressure (BP) were evaluated at entry, 48, 96, and 144 weeks. Multivariable linear and logistic regression models were used to evaluate mean risk factor changes and clinically relevant risk factor changes.
At entry, both NVP and LPV/r groups were similar regarding age [mean = 33.5 (SD = 7.1) years], CD4 [129 (67) cells/mm], and HIV-1 RNA [5.1 (0.6) log10 copies/mL]. Nearly, all women had normal lipids and BP except for high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. Over 144 weeks, the LPV/r compared with NVP group had significantly greater mean lipid increases (eg, non-HDL: +29 vs. +13 mg/dL) and smaller HDL increases (+12 vs. +21 mg/dL). In contrast, the NVP compared with LPV/r group had greater mean increases in BP (eg, diastolic BP: +5 vs. -0.5 mm Hg). Significantly, more women assigned LPV/r had week 144 "abnormal" lipid levels (eg, HDL 29.7% vs. 14.8% and triglycerides 28.6% vs. 8.2%), and significantly, more women assigned NVP had "abnormal" BP (eg, diastolic BP 22.7% vs. 6.5%). Most differences remained significant when adjusted for baseline risk factor, age, CD4, and HIV-1 RNA.
In HIV-infected women initiating antiretroviral therapy in Africa, LPV/r + TDF/FTC was associated with less favorable changes in lipids, and use of NVP + TDF/FTC was associated with less favorable changes in BP.
Abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) are widely used as first-line antiretroviral therapies. However, there are limited data comparing the safety of these therapies with long-term use. The objective of this study was to assess the long-term safety of these commonly used first-line nucleoside/nucleotide combinations each administered with efavirenz (EFV).
This open-label, 96-week, randomized study compared the safety (renal, bone and metabolic) and efficacy of ABC/3TC and TDF/FTC plus EFV in HLA-B*5701-negative antiretroviral-naive adults.
A total of 385 subjects were enrolled, and 249 (65%) subjects completed the study. The difference in changes from baseline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (calculated by the Modified Diet in Renal Disease equation) between treatment arms was not significant. There was a significant difference between the arms (P &lt; 0.0001) for markers of tubular dysfunction (retinol-binding protein and ß-2 microglobulin) favouring ABC/3TC. Hip bone mineral density decreased from baseline in both arms, with a significantly greater decline with TDF/FTC (ABC/3TC -2.2% and TDF/FTC -3.5%; P &lt; 0.001 at week 96). Subjects in the ABC/3TC arm had greater increases from baseline in median total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides. Adverse events were similar between arms. The virological failure rate was low in both arms.
ABC/3TC and TDF/FTC in combination with EFV minimally affected estimated glomerular filtration rate over 96 weeks. TDF/FTC was associated with greater increases in tubular dysfunction and bone turnover marker levels, greater decreases in hip bone mineral density, and smaller increases in serum lipid levels.
The efficacy and safety of raltegravir (RAL) with tenofovir (TDF)/emtricitabine (FTC) have been well studied in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. However, limited clinical data are available on the use of RAL with abacavir (ABC)/lamivudine (3TC) or zidovudine (ZDV)/3TC. We investigated HIV-1-infected Korean adults, including 13 antiretroviral-naïve patients and 15 antiretroviral-experienced patients, treated with RAL plus ABC/3TC or ZDV/3TC. Virological suppression was achieved in 12 of the 13 (92%) antiretroviral-naïve patients within 24 weeks and in all (100%) patients within 96 weeks. In 13 of the 15 treatment-experienced patients, ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) was replaced with RAL because of hyperlipidemia (n = 11) and diarrhea (n = 2). A significant decrease in median total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels was observed in these patients (P &lt; 0.01, each). No adverse event related to RAL was observed in any of the 28 patients. The RAL plus ABC/3TC or ZDV/3TC regimens were effective and safe in antiretroviral-naïve Korean HIV-infected patients, and replacing LPV/r with RAL significantly improved lipid abnormalities in patients previously treated with regimens including LPV/r. 
Cocoa products present great health potential due to their high content of polyphenols, mainly of flavanols. However, the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and other health effects of regularly consuming cocoa products seem to depend on the intake and health status of the consumer, etc. and need to be further clarified. A randomised, controlled, cross-over, free-living study was carried out in healthy (n 24) and moderately hypercholesterolaemic (&gt;2000 mg/l, n 20) subjects to assess the influence of regularly consuming (4 weeks) two servings (15 g each) of a cocoa product rich in fibre (containing 33·9 % of total dietary fibre (TDF) and 13·9 mg/g of soluble polyphenols) in milk v. consuming only milk (control) on (1) serum lipid and lipoprotein profile, (2) serum malondialdehyde levels, carbonyl groups, ferric reducing/antioxidant power, oxygen radical absorbance capacity and free radical-scavenging capacity, (3) IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-10, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and vascular and intracellular cell adhesion molecule levels, and (4) systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate. Throughout the study, the diet and physical activity of the volunteers, as well as any possible changes in weight or other anthropometric parameters, were also evaluated. The intake of TDF increased (P&lt; 0·001) to the recommended levels. Serum HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were increased (P&lt; 0·001), whereas glucose (P= 0·029), IL-1β (P= 0·001) and IL-10 (P= 0·001) levels were decreased. The rest of the studied cardiovascular parameters, as well as the anthropometric ones, remained similar. In conclusion, regularly consuming a cocoa product with milk improves cardiovascular health by increasing HDL-C levels and inducing hypoglycaemic and anti-inflammatory effects in healthy and hypercholesterolaemic individuals without causing weight gain.
The combination rilpivirine (RPV)/emtricitabine (FTC)/tenofovir (TDF) is a once-daily, single-tablet regimen (STR) containing one nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor associated with two nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors. It is approved by regulatory agencies (eg, US Food and Drug Association, European Medicines Agency) in all countries in which it is manufactured, except Switzerland, as first-line highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for the treatment of naïve patients with HIV infection and a viral load HIV-RNA level of ≤100,000 copies/mL. Two large trials (ECHO and THRIVE) comparing RPV with efavirenz, along with different background regimens, led to approval of the drug, while a more recent trial (STaR) explored the use of STR. RPV showed noninferiority to efavirenz in all the studies, including superiority as an STR in patients with HIV-RNA ≤100,000 copies/mL in the STaR study. A positive CD4 cell response was observed in all the studies, both in the RPV and efavirenz groups. The incidence of virologic failures was higher for RPV, but was mostly referred to patients with HIV-RNA &gt;100,000 copies/mL. There were fewer adverse events (AEs) with the RPV-based regimens versus efavirenz-based regimens, with a lower discontinuation rate because of AEs, especially psychiatric-neurological AEs, and a significantly lower rate of blood-lipid abnormalities. In the SPIRIT study (a switch study), significantly greater improvements from baseline in serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and trygliceride were demonstrated in patients switching to RPV/FTC/TDF from a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI/r)-based regimen, than in those who continued treatment with a PI/r regimen. RPV's better tolerability, associated with its once-daily STR formulation, is key to improving patients' adherence and quality of life, which are among the most important factors affecting the therapeutic efficacy of an antiretroviral regimen. In summary, RPV/FTC/TDF STR is a valuable treatment option for the majority of antiretroviral-naïve HIV-infected patients. Furthermore, the use of this STR in the therapeutic switch, like in the SPIRIT study, can result in another valuable option by which to reduce AEs and improve patients' quality of life. 
This is an 8-year cohort study of 24 HIV-infected patients aged 5-17 years to assess body composition and metabolic changes after switching from lamivudine + stavudine (d4T) + protease inhibitors (PI) to lamivudine + tenofovir (TDF) + efavirenz (EFV). Body composition (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) and cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose and insulin were measured annually. Linear mixed models and generalized linear mixed models were used to evaluate time changes of the outcome of interest. Body mass index increased linearly by 0.3 kg/m(2)/year (p &lt; 0.001); waist circumference increased non-linearly from 68 to 74 cm (p = 0.004 for the linear term and p = 0.04 for the quadratic term). Percent body fat, percent trunk fat and percent bone mineral content increased linearly by 0.6%/year (p = 0.005), 1.2%/year (p &lt; 0.001) and 0.02%/year (p = 0.04), respectively. Percent arm fat remained stable (p = 0.5), and percent leg fat decreased linearly by 1.2%/year (p &lt; 0.001). The probability of low HDL was 0.2% at baseline and remained stable during the study. The probability of high triglycerides was 3% at baseline and increased linearly to become 11% at the 8th year of follow-up (p = ns). The probability of high glucose was 1% for the whole study duration.
patients, after switching from d4T to TDF and from PI to EFV, show most of the changes in anthropometry and body composition associated with normal growth and no frankly pathological change in metabolic parameters.
In the United States, emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) is a preferred nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone with lamivudine/abacavir (3TC/ABC) as a commonly used alternative. For patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) virologically suppressed on a boosted protease inhibitor (PI) + 3TC/ABC regimen, the merits of switching to FTC/TDF as the NRTI backbone are unknown.
SWIFT was a prospective, randomized, open-label 48-week study to evaluate efficacy and safety of switching to FTC/TDF. Subjects receiving 3TC/ABC + PI + ritonavir (RTV) with HIV-1 RNA &lt; 200 c/mL ≥3 months were randomized to continue 3TC/ABC or switch to FTC/TDF. The primary endpoint was time to loss of virologic response (TLOVR) with noninferiority measured by delta of 12%. Virologic failure (VF) was defined as confirmed rebound or the last HIV-1 RNA measurement on study drug ≥200 c/mL.
In total, 311 subjects were treated in this study (155 to PI + RTV + FTC/TDF, 156 to PI + RTV + 3TC/ABC). Baseline characteristics were similar between the arms: 85% male, 28% black, median age, 46 years; and median CD4 532 cells/mm(3). By TLOVR through week 48, switching to FTC/TDF was noninferior compared to continued 3TC/ABC (86.4% vs 83.3%, treatment difference 3.0% (95% confidence interval, -5.1% to 11.2%). Fewer subjects on FTC/TDF experienced VF (3 vs 11; P = .034). FTC/TDF showed greater declines in fasting low-density lipoproteins (LDL), total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides (TG) with significant declines in LDL and TC beginning at week 12 with no TC/HDL ratio change. Switching to FTC/TDF showed improved NCEP thresholds for TC and TG and improved 10-year Framingham TC calculated scores. Decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate [corrected] (eGFR) was observed in both arms with a larger decrease in the FTC/TDF arm.
Switching to FTC/TDF from 3TC/ABC maintained virologic suppression, had fewer VFs, improved lipid parameters and Framingham scores but decreased eGFR. CLINICALTRIALS.GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT00724711.
The aim of this study was to investigate the effect on fasting lipid parameters of switching to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) plus emtricitabine (FTC) from abacavir (ABC) plus lamivudine (3TC; both fixed-dose combinations), while maintaining ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r).
This was an open-label randomized two-arm 12-week controlled study in virologically suppressed HIV-infected patients with elevated cholesterol (≥5.2 mmol/l). Patients stable on ABC/3TC plus LPV/r either continued treatment or switched to TDF/FTC plus LPV/r for 12 weeks. Standard efficacy and safety end points (including fasting lipids) were assessed.
In total, 85 subjects were treated (n=42 ABC/FTC and n=43 TDF/3TC). A statistically significant decrease in total cholesterol was observed in the TDF/FTC group: from median (IQR) 6.22 mmol/l (5.91-6.77) at baseline to 5.75 mmol/l (5.04-6.18) at week 12 (median [IQR] change from baseline -0.73 mmol/l [-1.20- -0.18]; P&lt;0.001). No notable change was observed for the ABC/3TC group. The difference between groups at week 12 was -0.82 mmol/l (P&lt;0.001). For TDF/FTC (but not for ABC/3TC), statistically significant reductions (P&lt;0.05) from baseline were observed in total, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)- and non-HDL cholesterol (at weeks 4 and 12). Statistically significant decreases were observed in median estimated creatinine clearance (Cockcroft-Gault) from baseline to week 12 for patients who switched to TDF/FTC (-5.47 ml/min) versus the ABC/3TC group (-2.15 ml/min; P=0.016 between groups). Virological suppression was maintained in both groups. No new safety issues were identified.
Switching to TDF/FTC from ABC/3TC was associated with rapid improvements in fasting lipid parameters and continued virological control in patients receiving LPV/r as the third component of antiretroviral therapy. The effect of these changes on clinical end points remains unclear and would need to be evaluated in a longer-term study.
The albedo is the white part of the citrus peel, which acts as a water reservoir for the juice sacs, seeds and leaves in times of drought. As the functionality of the albedo is unknown, we examined in this study the hypolipidemic and bifidogenic potentials of dietary fiber (DF) prepared from the Mikan (Japanese mandarin orange: Citrus unshiu) albedo. The albedo was obtained from Mikan harvested in Arida, Wakayama Prefecture, and total DF (TDF), water soluble DF (SDF) and water insoluble DF (IDF) were extracted. Albedo TDF contained arabinose (37.21%), galactose (16.05%), xylose (18.30%) and glucose (13.94%), but did not contain detectable amounts of galacturonic acid. Albedo SDF inhibited the enzymatic digestion of triolein by pancreatic lipase in vitro. The SDF, at a concentration of 80 mg per 6 mL of substrate solution, significantly inhibited the activity of this enzyme (&gt;50%). As compared to a control group on a 5% cellulose diet, rats fed a diet containing 1% albedo TDF for 4 wk showed significantly decreased serum triacylglycerol concentrations, increased fecal lipid excretion, and no changes in hepatic lipid content (triacylglycerol, total cholesterol, and phospholipid) or serum concentrations of total cholesterol or phospholipid. Consumption of albedo TDF also increased the number of bifidobacteria in the cecum. In this report, we have demonstrated that consumption of albedo TDF increased the levels bifidobacteria in the rat cecum, and decreased serum triacylglycerol concentrations due to the accelerated lipid excretion into the feces caused by the inhibition of pancreatic lipase.
Three dietary fiber (DF) powders; soluble dietary fiber (SDF), insoluble dietary fiber (IDF) and total dietary fiber (TDF) were prepared from cocoa bean shells (CBS) by enzymatic treatment. These DFs were evaluated for their effects on glucose adsorption, glucose diffusion, starch hydrolysis, cholesterol binding, sodium cholate binding and oil binding capacities using in vitro model systems by simulating gastric intestinal conditions. The results showed that SDF generally exhibited significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher glucose adsorption capacity (GAC), α-amylase inhibition activity, cholesterol and sodium cholate binding capacity, but less significant (&gt;0.05) glucose dialysis retardation index (GDRI) and oil binding capacity, when compared with IDF and TDF which both showed similar effects. Moreover, it was discovered that the three CBS dietary fiber powders contained intrinsic antioxidants (phenolic compounds). The study suggested that CBS could be an alternative cheap source of DF with additional benefits. Thus, CBS fibers could be incorporated as low calorie bulk ingredients in high-fiber diet to reduce calorie and cholesterol levels and control blood glucose level.
We investigated the potential differential effects of antiretroviral therapies on unbalanced chemokine homeostasis and on the progression of atherosclerosis in HIV-infected patients. A two-year prospective study was performed in 67 consecutive HIV-infected patients initiating antiretroviral therapy with abacavir/lamivudine or tenofovir/emtricitabine. Circulating levels of inflammatory biomarkers, progression of subclinical atherosclerosis and expression levels of selected chemokines genes in circulating leukocytes were assessed. Control subjects showed significantly lower plasma concentrations of CRP, tPA, IL-6, and MCP-1 than HIV-infected patients at a baseline. After two years of followup, the observed decreases in plasma inflammatory biomarker levels were only significant for MCP-1, tPA, and IL-6. The decrease in plasma MCP-1 concentration was associated with the progression of atherosclerosis, and this effect was negligible only in patients receiving TDF-based therapy. Multivariate analysis confirmed that treatment with TDF was positively and significantly associated with a higher likelihood of subclinical atherosclerosis progression. However, the expression levels of selected genes in blood cells only showed associations with the viral load and total and HDL-cholesterol levels. Current antiretroviral treatments may partially attenuate the influence of HIV infection on certain inflammatory pathways, though patients receiving TDF therapy must be carefully monitored with respect to the presence and/or progression of atherosclerosis.
Once-daily (QD) ritonavir 100 mg-boosted fosamprenavir 1400 mg (FPV/r100) or atazanavir 300 mg (ATV/r100), plus tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) 300 mg/200 mg, have not been compared as initial antiretroviral treatment. To address this data gap, we conducted an open-label, multicenter 48-week study (ALERT) in 106 antiretroviral-naïve, HIV-infected patients (median HIV-1 RNA 4.9 log10 copies/mL; CD4+ count 191 cells/mm3) randomly assigned to the FPV/r100 or ATV/r100 regimens.
At baseline, the FPV/r100 or ATV/r100 arms were well-matched for HIV-1 RNA (median, 4.9 log10 copies/mL [both]), CD4+ count (mean, 176 vs 205 cells/mm3). At week 48, intent-to-treat: missing/discontinuation = failure analysis showed similar responses to FPV/r100 and ATV/r100 (HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL: 75% (40/53) vs 83% (44/53), p = 0.34 [Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test]); mean CD4+ count change-from-baseline: +170 vs +183 cells/mm3, p = 0.398 [Wilcoxon rank sum test]). Fasting total/LDL/HDL-cholesterol changes-from-baseline were also similar, although week 48 median fasting triglycerides were higher with FPV/r100 (150 vs 131 mg/dL). FPV/r100-treated patients experienced fewer treatment-related grade 2-4 adverse events (15% vs 57%), with differences driven by ATV-related hyperbilirubinemia. Three patients discontinued TDF/FTC because their GFR decreased to &lt;50 mL/min.
The all-QD regimens of FPV/r100 and ATV/r100, plus TDF/FTC, provided similar virologic, CD4+ response, and fasting total/LDL/HDL-cholesterol changes through 48 weeks. Fewer FPV/r100-treated patients experienced treatment-related grade 2-4 adverse events.
Study 903 is a phase 3 trial with a completed 144-week, double-blind phase comparing tenofovir DF (TDF) with stavudine (d4T), in combination with lamivudine (3TC) and efavirenz (EFV), and an ongoing 336-week open-label extension phase.
Patients in 3 countries completing the d4T treatment phase were allowed to switch d4T to TDF and receive once-daily TDF+3TC+EFV in the extension phase.
At the time of switch, 100% and 99% of patients (n = 85; 60% male, 64% White; mean age 37 years; mean CD4 = 650 cells/mm3) had HIV RNA &lt;400 and &lt;50 copies/mL. At 144 weeks after the switch, 89% (missing = failure) had HIV RNA &lt;400 copies/mL and 87% had HIV RNA &lt;50 copies/mL. Mean CD4 cell count increased 155 cells/mm3. No patient had virologic failure. Significant decreases from switch to week 144 in mean fasting total cholesterol (-22 mg/dL, p &lt; .0001) and triglycerides (-78 mg/dL, p &lt; .0001) were observed. Mean limb fat increased significantly from 4.5 kg to 5.8 kg, 144 weeks after switch (p &lt; .0001).
In virologically suppressed patients, switching d4T to TDF as part of a once-daily regimen with 3TC and EFV resulted in maintenance of virologic suppression and continued CD4 cell increases through 144 weeks, with significant improvements in metabolic parameters.
To evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of a simplification regimen with tenofovir DF (TDF), lamivudine (3TC), and efavirenz (EFV) in HAART-experienced HIV-1-infected subjects with sustained viral suppression.
Patients with HIV-1 RNA &lt;200 copies/mL during the previous 6 months and who switched their current twice-daily or three-times-daily HAART to a simplified once-daily regimen of TDF (300 mg), 3TC (300 mg), and EFV (600 mg) were included.
154 patients (70% males, mean age 42 years) were included. Previous HAART included a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimen in 55% of the patients and a thymidine analog in 87%. The percentage of patients with viral load &lt;200 copies/mL in the intent-to-treat (ITT) data set was 83% at 6 months and 75% at 12 months (98% and 96%, respectively, in the on-treatment [OT] analysis). Five patients (3%) were identified as virologic failures according to the study protocol. The mean CD4 T-cell count increased significantly 12 months after simplification (from 570 to 632 cells/mm3; p &lt; .01). At 12 months, mean triglyceride levels decreased from 233 to 170 mg/dL (p &lt; .01) and mean cholesterol levels decreased from 205 to 189 mg/dL (p &lt; .01). Thirty-three patients (21%) discontinued the study treatment prior to completing the 12-month follow-up.
Simplification to a once-daily regimen containing TDF, 3TC, and EFV is virologically and immunologically effective, well-tolerated, and safe with benefits in the lipid profile in the majority of patients.
Stavudine (d4T)-containing regimens are associated with a potential for lipoatrophy and dyslipidaemia. We assessed the safety and efficacy of reducing the dose of stavudine compared with switching to tenofovir or maintaining the standard dose of d4T.
Clinically stable HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy containing stavudine 40 mg twice daily with a plasma HIV RNA &lt; 200 copies/ml for at least 6 months were randomized to maintain stavudine 40 mg twice daily (d4T40 arm), to reduce to 30 mg twice daily (d4T30 arm), or to switch from d4T to tenofovir (TDF arm).
Fifty-eight (93% male) patients were included: 22 in the d4T40 arm, 19 in the d4T30 arm and 17 in TDF arm. At baseline, median time on d4T was 6 years (interquartile range [IQR] 2.6-7.1), median age 43 years (IQR 36-51) and median CD4+ T-cell count was 587/mm3 (IQR 329-892). At week 24, median limb fat changes (g) were as follows: d4T40 = -182 (95% CI: -469- -5); d4T30 = 527 (95% CI: -343-694); and TDF = 402 (95% CI: 130-835; d4T40 versus TDF, P = 0.0003). Significant differences between median values of laboratory parameters were detected: triglycerides (mg/dl): d4T40 = 19; d4T30 = -23 and TDF = -79 (d4T40 versus TDF, P = 0.03); and total cholesterol (mg/dl): d4t40 = 22, d4T30 = -4, and TDF = -28 (d4T40 versus TDF, P = 0.04). No significant difference was observed in mitochondrial function assessed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
Although both strategies were associated with a trend toward a decrease in plasma lipids and an increase in body fat, the only significant changes were observed among those who switched to tenofovir.
To assess the safety and efficacy of a 4-drug, 3-tablet, once-daily (qd) regimen consisting of abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine (ABC/3TC/ZDV; 2 tablets) and tenofovir (TDF) in antiretroviral-naïve patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA 30,000 copies/mL at 48 weeks.
All participants received ABC/3TC/ZDV (300/150/300 mg) and TDF (300 mg) qd in this pilot, open-label, multicenter study. Intent-to-treat (ITT) analyses were conducted to evaluate virologic and immunologic efficacy.
Of the 123 participants enrolled, 52 (42%) prematurely discontinued study for adverse events (14), were lost to follow-up (13), had virologic nonresponse (12), and withdrew for other reasons (13). At week 48, by ITT missing=failure analysis, 41% (51/123) and 51% (63/123) of participants had plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL and &lt;400 copies/mL, respectively; by ITT-observed analysis, 75% (51/68) and 93% (63/68) had plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL and &lt;400 copies/mL, respectively; 11% (14/123) met virologic nonresponse criteria. Median week 48 change in CD4+ cell count from baseline was +127 cells/mm3. Median week 48 changes from baseline for fasting lipids were as follows: cholesterol (-9 mg/dL), HDL (+1 mg/dL), LDL (-9 mg/dL), and triglycerides (-4 mg/dL).
A high rate of premature discontinuations contributed to the overall suboptimal virologic response to ABC/3TC/ZDV+TDF qd; however, the regimen was not associated with high rates of virologic failure previously observed with TDF+ABC/3TC.
Investigate the metabolic and mitochondrial effects of switching a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen with a high mitochondrial toxicity profile to a HAART with a theoretically low mitochondrial toxicity.
Six consecutive HAART-experienced patients receiving at least one dideoxy-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) switched to enfuvirtide plus tenofovir plus saquinavir/ritonavir (T20+TDF+SQV/r). Blood samples were collected at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks after the switch, and viral load (VL) and lymphocyte CD4+ T-cell count were determined. Metabolic parameters consisted of fasting serum triglycerides, cholesterol (total and fractions), glucose, insulin, C-peptide and lactate. Mitochondrial assessment consisted on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) quantification, COX-II mitochondrial protein expression rate, mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III and IV activities, and oxygen consumption in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. For baseline mitochondrial comparisons, we included six HIV-infected patients naive for ART.
Switched patients exhibited a mean increase of 26 CD4+ T-cells/mm3 and a mean decrease of 1.1 log in VL (P = NS for both). Lactate, lipids and glycaemia remained stable during the study; only insulin levels increased significantly (P &lt; 0.05). Switched patients exhibited, at baseline, low mitochondrial measurements, being significant only for complex III and IV activities with respect to naive patients (P &lt; 0.05 for both). MtDNA content did not rise significantly during the study. However, we observed increases in COX-II mitochondrial protein synthesis (124%, P &lt; 0.05), complex III activity (127%, P &lt; 0.05), complex IV activity (86%, P = 0.37) and oxygen consumption (194%, P &lt; 0.05).
Switching a HAART-containing dideoxy-NRTI to T20+TDF+SQV/r minimally alters metabolic parameters and exerts beneficial effects on mitochondrial function at 24 weeks. Mitochondrial improvement should be considered as an additional advantage of this rescue therapy.
SPARING ANTIPROTEASES: An antiprotease-sparing strategy can improve compliance and adhesion to antiretroviral treatments. Several studies have demonstrated that switching to neviparin or efavirenz can maintain viral suppression and allow satisfactory rise in CD4 counts with a significant reduction in the neviparin group. A switch to a tritherapy with nucleosides (abacavir) can increase the risk of virological failure but allows an improvement in lipid anomalies, simplified treatment, and better patient adhesion. LIPODYSTROPHY SYNDROMES: These syndromes develop in 30 to 50% of the cases depending on the study and appear to be linked to the duration of exposure to antiretroviral agents. Along with the associated metabolic anomalies, lipodystrophy plays a role in the cardiovascular risk related to these treatments. NEW ANTIRETROVIRAL DRUGS: Several clinical trials have been devoted to new antiretroviral drugs. DAPD was found to have a dose-dependent antiretroviral effect with good tolerance. A new antiprotease (BMS 232 632) offers the advantage of a single daily dose with good tolerance and good effectiveness compared with the reference treatment including nelfinavir. TDF (tenofovir disoproxyl fumarate) is a nucleotidic analogue of reverse transcriptase. Given in a single daily dose monotherapy regimen, it can provide prolonged retroviral suppression. Compared with nelfinavir, ABT 378 gave significantly higher viral loads &lt; 400 copies/ml at 24 weeks with an identical clinical tolerance but with an advantage for cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
Legumes have reported benefits in terms of reduced risk for coronary heart disease and of colonic health. A novel legume fiber, cocoa bran, also may have favorable health effects on serum lipid levels, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol oxidation, and fecal bulk.
Twenty-five healthy normolipidemic subjects (13 men and 12 women) (mean +/- SEM age, 37 +/- 2 years; mean +/- SEM body mass index [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters], 24.6 +/- 0.7) ate cocoa-bran and chocolate-flavored low-fiber breakfast cereals for 2-week periods, with 2-week washout, in a double-blind crossover study. The cocoa-bran cereal provided 25.0 g/d of total dietary fiber (TDF). The low-fiber cereal (5.6 g/d TDF) was of similar appearance and energy value. Fasting blood samples were obtained at the start and end of each period, and 4-day fecal collections were made from days 11 through 14.
High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level was higher (7.6% +/- 2.9%; P =.02) and the LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio was lower (6.7% +/- 2.3%; P =.007) for cocoa-bran compared with low-fiber cereal at 2 weeks. No effect was seen on LDL cholesterol oxidation. Mean fecal output was significantly higher for cocoa-bran than for low-fiber cereal (56 +/- 14 g/d; P&lt;.001) and equal to the increase seen in the same subjects with wheat fiber in a previous study.
A chocolate-flavored cocoa-bran cereal increased fecal bulk similarly to wheat bran and was associated with a reduction in the LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio. In view of the low-fat, high-fiber nature of the material, these results suggest a possible role for this novel fiber source in the diets of normal, hyperlipidemic, and constipated subjects.
The theca cells (TC) first become identifiable in preantral follicles after the granulosa cells (GC) begin to divide. It remains unknown when the TC first respond to LH and acquire the capacity to produce androgens. The signal initiating TC differentiation is also unknown since pre-theca cells do not contain LH receptors. Since the first wave of follicle development in the rat occurs postnatally, we correlated the function of dispersed ovarian cells from 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, and 10-day-old rats with the morphological differentiation of TC. The largest follicles in ovaries from 4-day-old rats were primary follicles without associated TC. These cells were unable to produce cAMP or steroids in vitro in response to hCG. At 5 days, the first theca were associated with follicles containing 2-3 layers of GC. These cells were responsive to hCG, producing cAMP, progesterone, androstenedione, and androsterone. Responses to hCG increased progressively through 10 days of age. Cholesterol side-chain cleavage (P450scc), 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD), and 17 alpha-hydroxylase/C17-20 lyase (P450(17 alpha)) enzymes were localized exclusively to the theca interna. Messenger RNAs for LH receptor, P450scc, 3 beta-HSD, and P450(17 alpha) were expressed prior to the time the TC become responsive to LH or morphologically differentiated. To determine the source of the signal regulating TC differentiation, dispersed cells from 4-day-old rat ovaries that were unresponsive to LH were treated with preantral follicle-conditioned medium containing thecal differentiating factor (TDF) activity. The TDF activity stimulated androgen production and expression of LH receptor, P450scc, 3 beta-HSD, and P450(17 alpha) mRNAs. These data demonstrate that a paracrine signal from the preantral follicle can initiate TC differentiation prior to expression of LH receptors. TC become responsive to LH and capable of producing androgens coincident with morphological differentiation.
We have recently presented data demonstrating that preantral follicles secrete a peptide (or family of peptides) that stimulates ovarian theca-interstitial cell (TIC) androgen production by an LH-independent mechanism. The purpose of the study reported here was to study the gonadotropin and developmental regulation of this thecal differentiating factor(s) (TDF) and to determine whether follicle-conditioned medium (FCM) containing TDF bioactivity could stimulate LH receptor and steroidogenic enzyme mRNA expression in TIC. Preantral follicles devoid of theca were obtained by limited enzymatic dispersal of 26-day-old rat ovaries. Follicles were cultured (5 follicles/well) in 96-well plates containing serum-free medium to generate FCM containing bioactive TDF. To bioassay for TDF activity, isolated TIC were cultured (2 days) with 50% FCM; then androsterone production was measured by RIA. Recombinant FSH (rFSH, 0.3-100 mlU/ml) increased TDF bioactivity in a dose-dependent fashion, stimulating maximum androsterone production (20 ng/ml) at 30 mlU/ml. To determine the time course of the production of TDF bioactivity, FCM was collected from follicle cultures treated with and without rFSH at 1, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, and 48 h. FCM from follicles cultured without rFSH caused a progressive increase in androsterone production to a peak (8 ng/ml) at 18 h followed by a decline to baseline by 48 h. A similar time course was observed for the first 18 h with the rFSH-treated FCM, but androsterone production continued to increase to a level twice that of the untreated FCM (18 ng/ml) at 36 h of culture. In the presence of 100 mlU/ml of rFSH, TDF bioactivity was produced by preantral follicles with &gt; or = 2 layers of granulosa cells but not by small antral follicles, preovulatory follicles, or corpora lutea, demonstrating that production of TDF bioactivity is developmentally regulated. To determine whether FCM could stimulate mRNA expression in TIC, LH receptor, cholesterol side-chain cleavage (P450scc), 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD), and 17 alpha-hydroxylase (P450(17) alpha) mRNAs were measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays. FCM stimulated LH-receptor, P450scc, 3 beta-HSD, and P450(17) alpha mRNAs above controls. Our data demonstrate that the production of TDF bioactivity is increased by FSH during a specific stage in follicular development when the theca interna is rapidly differentiating, but its production stops when the follicle develops an antrum. Treatment of TIC with FCM stimulates the expression of the mRNAs coding for LH receptors and the steroidogenic enzymes P450scc, 3 beta-HSD, and P450(17) alpha, mimicking the events that occur during normal thecal differentiation. Thus, it seems likely that TDF is involved in the regulation of initial thecal differentiation in preantral follicles.
To evaluate some possible mechanisms whereby total dietary fibre (TDF) may affect lipid metabolism in humans, six normolipidaemic males ingested on separate days a low-fibre test meal (2.8 g TDF) containing 70 g fat and 756 mg cholesterol, enriched with 10 g TDF in the form of either pea fibre or soybean fibre. Fasting and post-meal blood samples were obtained for 7 h and chylomicrons (CM) were isolated. Lipoproteins (VLDL+CM remnants, LDL, HDL) were isolated from the baseline samples and the samples of the 2-3 h triglyceride peaks. As compared to the postprandial response given by the control low-fibre test meal, adding fibre induced no change in serum glucose, insulin or Apo A1 and Apo B variations. The serum triglyceride response was not altered by adding fibres but the 2-3 h chylomicron triglyceride rise was increased (P &lt; or = 0.05) by soybean fibre. VLDL+CM remnants, LDL and HDL triglyceride variations were unchanged with fibres. Cholesterolaemia decreased postprandially for 6 h, and was further lowered in the presence of pea fibre. This resulted from a marked decrease in serum esterified cholesterol. The chylomicron cholesterol and phospholipid rise was lowered in the presence of either fibre. The postprandial changes in the free cholesterol concentrations of the various lipoprotein classes were not altered by fibre whereas changes from baseline in esterified cholesterol concentrations were reduced by soybean fibre in LDL and amplified by soybean and pea fibres in HDL. The results obtained show that dietary fibre present in legumes may alter postprandial lipaemia and lipoproteins in humans to a variable extent. These effects could be related to some long-term metabolic effects.
Six normolipidemic males ingested on separate days a low-fiber test meal [2.8 g dietary fiber (TDF)] containing 70 g fat and 756 mg cholesterol, enriched or not with 10 g TDF as oat bran, rice bran, or wheat fiber or 4.2 g TDF as wheat germ. Fasting and postmeal blood samples were obtained for 7 h and chylomicrons were isolated. Adding fibers to the test meal induced no change in serum glucose or insulin responses. The serum triglyceride response was lower (P less than or equal to 0.05) in the presence of oat bran, wheat fiber, or wheat germ and chylomicron triglycerides were reduced with wheat fiber. All fiber sources reduced chylomicron cholesterol. Cholesterolemia decreased postprandially for 6 h and was further lowered in the presence of oat bran. Serum apolipoprotein (apo) A-1 and apo B concentrations were not affected. Thus, dietary fibers from cereals may reduce postprandial lipemia in humans to a variable extent.
We report data from NEWART, a randomised phase 4 clinical trial comparing virologic efficacy and safety of nevirapine (NVP) vs. ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (ATV/r) on a background of tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) in HIV-1-infected treatment-naïve patients. This study enrolled patients according to CD4-based initiation criteria for NVP (&lt;250 cells/mm(3) for women and &lt;400 cells/mm(3) for men), to reduce the likelihood of symptomatic hepatic events. NEWART was designed to support and confirm results from ARTEN, an international trial with similar design and study endpoints.
A total of 152 patients were randomised 1 : 1 to open-label NVP 200 mg twice daily or ATV/r (300/100 mg) once daily, plus once daily TDF/FTC (300/200 mg). All participants met CD4(+) guidelines at entry. The primary endpoint for non-inferiority was virologic response prior to and at week 48 (confirmed HIV plasma viral load &lt;50 copies/ml, without rebound or change in ARVs). Safety data, including plasma lipids, were recorded throughout the study.
The primary endpoint was achieved in 46/75 (61.3%) and 50/77 (64.9%) of patients taking NVP and ATV/r, respectively. Frequency of adverse events (AEs) was similar between arms, with 88.0% of NVP-treated patients and 94.8% of ATV/r-treated patients experiencing at least one AE. Nine patients (12%) in each arm experienced an AE that led to discontinuation. At week 48, a significantly greater increase was seen in mean plasma HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) in the NVP arm (9.6 mg/dl) vs. the ATV/r arm (3.5 mg/dl); p = 0.016. Also, total cholesterol (TC):HDL-C ratio on-treatment was -0.38 and -0.02 for the NVP and ATV/r arms, respectively (p = 0.038).
Efficacy results were consistent with the ARTEN study demonstrating that NVP was non-inferior to ATV/r when taken in combination with TDF/FTC. Rates of AEs were similar between the two arms, whereas HDL-C increased and TC:HDL-C decreased significantly more in patients taking NVP than ATV/r.
The aim of the study was to compare the effects on lipids, body composition and renal function of once-daily ritonavir-boosted saquinavir (SQV/r) or atazanavir (ATV/r) in combination with tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) over 48 weeks.
An investigator-initiated, randomized, open-label, multinational trial comparing SQV/r 2000/100 mg and ATV/r 300/100 mg once daily, both in combination with TDF/FTC, in 123 treatment-naïve HIV-1-infected adults was carried out. The primary endpoint was to demonstrate noninferiority of SQV/r compared with ATV/r with respect to the change in fasting cholesterol after 24 weeks. Secondary outcome measures were changes in metabolic abnormalities, body composition, renal function, and virological and immunological efficacy over 48 weeks. Patients who had used at least one dose of trial drug were included in the analysis.
Data for 118 patients were analysed (57 patients on SQV/r and 61 on ATV/r). At week 24, changes in lipids were modest, without increases in triglycerides, including a significant rise in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and a nonsignificant decrease in the total:HDL cholesterol ratio in both arms with no significant difference between arms. Lipid changes at week 48 were similar to the changes observed up to week 24, with no significant change in the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index. Adipose tissue increased regardless of the regimen, particularly in the peripheral compartment and to a lesser extent in the central abdominal compartment, with an increase in adipose tissue reaching statistical significance in the ATV/r arm. A slight decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was observed in both arms during the first 24 weeks, with no progression thereafter. The immunological and virological responses were similar over the 48 weeks.
Combined with TDF/FTC, both SQV/r 2000/100 mg and ATV/r 300/100 mg had comparable modest effects on lipids, had little effect on glucose metabolism, conserved adipose tissue, and similarly reduced eGFR. The virological efficacy was similar.
The aim of this study was to assess changes in the size and cholesterol content of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and changes in lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) activity in HIV-infected patients switching to tenofovir + emtricitabine (TDF+FTC) or abacavir + lamivudine (ABC+3TC).
This was a substudy of a multicentre randomized trial comparing TDF+FTC with ABC+3TC-based regimens in patients with virological suppression. Fasting lipids and apolipoproteins (apo), LDL size and cholesterol content and Lp-PLA2 activity were measured at baseline and at week 48.
A total of 62 patients, naive for the compared drugs, were included. At baseline, groups were comparable except for total Lp-PLA2 activity (P=0.047) and for a tendency towards the use of a major baseline thymidine analogue in the TDF+FTC arm (25 versus 18 patients; P=0.054). In the ABC+3TC arm a significant increase in total cholesterol (0.64 mmol/l; P=0.003), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c, 0.13 mmol/l; P=0.031), triglycerides (0.39 mmol/l; P=0.036), apo A-I (0.12 g/l; P=0.006), apo B (0.16 g/l; P=0.015) and non-HDL-c (0.50 mmol/l; P=0.009) concentrations was observed at week 48 compared with the TDF+FTC treatment arm. In addition, an increase in the cholesterol content of small, dense LDL subfractions (0.48 mmol/l; P=0.003) and a decrease in LDL size (-2.6 nm; P=0.011) was observed in the ABC arm without changes in the TDF patients. Total PLA2, LDL-PLA2 and HDL-PLA2 activity decreased in the TDF arm, but multivariate analysis showed baseline PLA2 values and previous use of thymidine analogues as the factors associated with these changes. Estimated cardiovascular risk did not change in either arm.
A more atherogenic LDL profile, including a decrease in LDL size, was found in the ABC group and not in TDF patients.
Selection of first-line antiretroviral therapy requires consideration of efficacy as well as effects on lipids given the increased concern about cardiovascular risk in HIV-1 patients.
ARTEN is a randomized, open-label, non-inferiority trial that compares nevirapine (NVP) 200 mg twice daily or 400 mg once daily to atazanavir/ritonavir (ATZ/r) 300 mg/100 mg once daily, each combined with fixed-dose tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) 300 mg/emtricitabine (FTC) 200 mg once daily, in antiretroviral-naive HIV-1 patients with CD4(+) T-cell counts &lt;400 (men) and &lt;250 cells/mm(3) (women). The primary end point was plasma HIV RNA&lt;50 copies/ml at two consecutive visits prior to week 48.
A total of 569 patients were randomized and treated. Overall, 66.8% of NVP and 65.3% of ATZ/r patients achieved the primary end point (difference 1.9%, 95% CI -5.9-9.8%). Similar rates of serious adverse events were observed (9.6% on NVP versus 8.8% on ATZ/r), although discontinuations due to adverse events were more frequent with NVP than ATZ/r (13.6% versus 3.6%, respectively). None of the 28 patients virologically failing ATZ/r selected resistance mutations, while they were selected in 29/44 patients virologically failing NVP. NVP induced a significantly greater increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) and apolipoprotein A1 from baseline than ATZ/r, whereas triglycerides increased significantly more with ATZ/r than NVP. Mean change from baseline in TC:HDL-c ratio was -0.24 for NVP and 0.13 for ATZ/r (P=0.0001).
NVP demonstrated at week 48 non-inferior antiviral efficacy compared with ATZ/r when given along with TDF/FTC, despite more drug-related discontinuations with NVP than ATZ/r. NVP was associated with a lower atherogenic lipid profile than ATZ/r although resistance mutations were more frequently selected with NVP than ATZ/r.
Despite significant improvements in the treatment of coronary heart disease (CHD), it is still a major cause of mortality and morbidity among the Iranian population. Epidemiological studies have documented that risk factors including smoking and the biochemical profile are responsible for the development of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Psychological factors have been discussed as potential risk factors for coronary heart disease. Among emotional factors, depression correlates with coronary heart disease, particularly myocardial infarction.
This case-control study was conducted on 120 cases (69 males and 51 females) of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and 120 controls, with a mean age of 62.48 ± 15.39 years. Cases and controls were matched by age, residence and sex.
The results revealed that severe depression was independently associated with the risk of AMI (P = 0.025, OR = 2.6, 95% CI 1.1-5.8). The analysis of variables indicated that risk factors for developing depression were unmarried, low levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), total dietary fiber (TDF) and carbohydrates. The levels of these dietary factors were lowest in severely depressed patients compared to those categorised as moderate or mild cases. Furthermore, severely depressed subjects were associated with higher levels of total cholesterol, high systolic blood pressure (SBP) and WHR. Age, income, a family history of coronary heart disease, education level, sex, employment and smoking were not associated with severe depression.
The present study demonstrated that severe depression symptoms are independent risk factors for AMI. Furthermore, severe depression was associated with an unhealthy diet and AMI risk factors.
Several studies have reported improvement in lipids after antiretroviral therapy switches to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)-containing regimens. We assessed lipid-lowering effects of TDF by adding it to a stable antiretroviral therapy regimen in this double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. We demonstrated that nonhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholestrol, and total cholestrol improved significantly over TDF vs. placebo treatment in HIV-infected individuals with dyslipidemia. Adding TDF to stable, virologically suppressive antiretroviral therapy regimens improved lipid parameters, supporting a lipid-lowering effect of TDF.
Certain antiretrovirals are known to affect lipid and glucose homeostasis. The aim of this study was to assess the effect on insulin sensitivity (determined by peripheral glucose uptake using a hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp) of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) administration compared with placebo for 2 weeks in HIV-1-seronegative healthy male volunteers. Changes in lipids, adiponectin, leptin, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and the adhesion molecules E-selectin and P-selectin were also assessed.
This was a single-centre, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study that used a two-sequence, two-period cross-over design. A total of 19 HIV-negative males were recruited to the study and randomized 1:1 to receive either 2 weeks of TDF (300 mg once daily) followed by 2 weeks of placebo or placebo initially followed by tenofovir. Clamps were performed at baseline, after 2 weeks and after 4 weeks.
All three clamps were completed by 16 participants. During the euglycaemic clamp, there were no significant changes in insulin sensitivity after 2 weeks of TDF administration compared with placebo or baseline. There was a significant reduction in the mean total cholesterol (9.4%) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL; 8.1%) cholesterol following 2 weeks of TDF compared with placebo. Levels of adiponectin, leptin, PAI-1, P-selectin and E-selectin were not significantly altered.
TDF use for 2 weeks does not affect insulin sensitivity, as assessed by the hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp in HIV-negative male volunteers. TDF use resulted in modest, but statistically significant, reductions in total and LDL cholesterol.
Dietary fiber rich chicken meat patties were developed by incorporating wheat and oat bran to chicken meat at 5, 10 and 15% levels. Oat bran contained higher amount of soluble dietary fiber (SDF) and unsaturated fatty acids (USFA) than wheat bran, whereas total dietary fiber (TDF), insoluble dietary fiber (IDF) and saturated fatty acids (SFA) were higher in wheat bran. Incorporation of bran significantly increased the water holding capacity (WHC) and emulsion stability (ES). Oat bran showed better effect on WHC and ES than wheat bran. Addition of bran resulted in significant increase in cooking yield, firmness, TDF, USFA and reduction in sensory attributes, moisture, protein, fat and cholesterol content. IDF was higher in wheat bran added patties and SDF and SFA/USFA ratio in oat bran added patties. It is concluded that oat and wheat bran can be incorporated up to 10 and 15% level, respectively for preparation of baked and steamed chicken patties.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of raltegravir vs efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy after 96 weeks in treatment-naive patients with HIV-1 infection.
Multicenter, double-blind, randomized study of raltegravir (100, 200, 400, or 600 mg twice a day) vs efavirenz (600 mg every day), both with tenofovir/lamivudine (TDF/3TC), for 48 weeks, after which raltegravir arms were combined and all dosed at 400 mg twice a day. Eligible patients had HIV-1 RNA &gt; or =5000 copies per milliliter and CD4 T cells &gt; or =100 cells per microliter.
One hundred ninety-eight patients were randomized and treated; 160 received raltegravir and 38 received efavirenz. At week 96, 84% of patients in both groups achieved HIV-1 RNA &lt;400 copies per milliliter; 83% in the raltegravir group and 84% in the efavirenz group achieved &lt;50 copies per milliliter (noncompleter = failure). Both groups showed similar increases in CD4 T cells (221 vs 232 cells/uL, respectively). An additional 2 patients (1 in each group) met the protocol definition of virologic failure between weeks 48 and 96; no known resistance mutations were observed in the raltegravir recipient; the efavirenz recipient had nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance mutations. Investigator reported drug-related clinical adverse events (AEs) were less frequent with raltegravir (51%) than efavirenz (74%). Drug-related AEs occurring in &gt;10% of patients in either group were nausea in both groups and dizziness and headache in the efavirenz group. Laboratory AEs remained infrequent. Raltegravir had no adverse effect on total or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or on triglycerides. Neuropsychiatric AEs remained less frequent with raltegravir (34%) than efavirenz (58%). There were no drug-related serious AEs in patients receiving raltegravir.
In antiretroviral therapy-naive patients, raltegravir with TDF/3TC had potent antiretroviral activity, which was similar to efavirenz/TDF/3TC and was sustained to week 96. Raltegravir was generally well tolerated; drug-related AEs were less frequent in patients treated with raltegravir compared with efavirenz.
To assess the efficacy and safety of a treatment switch from a twice-daily (BID) regimen containing zidovudine (ZDV) and lamivudine (3TC) plus a third agent to a once daily (QD) regimen containing the fixed-dose combination of tenofovir DF/emtri?citabine (TDF/FTC, Truvada) plus a divergent third QD agent in HIV-1 infected patients.
Prospective, 48-week, non-randomised, single-group, open-label, study. Fifty-one patients on stable ZDV/3TC-containing HAART, with HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/ml and CD4+ T-cell count &gt;50 cells/microl, were switched to TDF/FTC plus a third agent. Plasma HIV-1 RNA, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts were assessed at baseline and weeks 4, 12, 24, 36 and 48 post-switch.
During the 48-week study, 10 patients discontinued prematurely, including three due to adverse events (AEs). At week 48, plasma HIV-1 RNA was &lt;50 copies/ml in 40 patients (78.4%). No patient experienced virological failure (defined as HIV-1 RNA &gt; or =50 copies/ml at two consecutive post-baseline measurements) during the study. Immunologic control was maintained, with no significant changes in CD4+ or CD8+ T-cell counts. A statistically significant improvement from baseline in haemoglobin level was observed at week 48 (median change 0.8 g/dl; p&lt;0.001). There was also a statistically significant decrease in total cholesterol concentration at week 48 (-26.0 mg/dl; p = 0.001) in a subset of patients (n = 22) entering the study with elevated total cholesterol. Treatment was well tolerated and no treatment-related grade 3 or 4 AEs were seen. -
Results from this study support switching from a ZDV/3TC-containing HAART regimen to a completely QD regimen of TDF/FTC plus a third agent. Virologic and immunologic control are maintained, with apparent benefits in haemoglobin.
Evaluate efficacy, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, adherence, and treatment satisfaction of atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) 300 mg/100mg and tenofovir DF/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) 300 mg/200mg once daily in antiretroviral-naïve HIV-infected patients.
Single-arm, open-label, multicenter 48-week study.
100 patients were evaluated; 17 patients discontinued early including 6 for adverse events. There were 2 deaths (multi-organ failure, lactic acidosis). At 48 weeks, 81% achieved HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL (ITT, M=F). No K65R or ATV/r associated mutations emerged; M184V developed in one patient. Median CD4 increase was 217 cells/mm3. The most common adverse events (&gt; or = 10%) were diarrhea, nausea, scleral icterus, fatigue, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and vomiting. Grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia occurred in 5%. Median increases at 48 weeks in total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, and triglycerides were 11, 3, 2, and 5 mg/dL, respectively. Two patients had confirmed graded increases in serum creatinine (one grade 1, one grade 2). Median (IQR) creatinine clearance change from baseline at 48 weeks was -7 (-19, 2) mL/min. Geometric mean (95% CI) ATV trough concentrations exceeded suggested therapeutic range. At 48 weeks, 92% of patients reported complete adherence by 1-week recall and 90% reported being "very satisfied" with the regimen.
ATV/r+TDF/FTC was safe, well tolerated, and convenient for patients. Larger comparative trials are ongoing.
To assess the safety and efficacy of rilpivirine in combination with emtricitabine and tenofovir (RPV/FTC/TDF) as a once-daily single-tablet regimen (STR) in HIV-1-infected children and adolescents we performed a multicenter case series study of HIV-1-infected patients. Inclusion criteria were initiation of therapy with RPV/FTC/TDF before the age of 18. Patients were divided into undetectable viral load (uVL) group, HIV-1 RNA &lt; 20 copies/mL on stable combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), and detectable viral load (dVL) group, HIV-1 RNA ≥ 20 copies/mL at RPV/FTC/TDF initiation. Patients were monitored from the date of RPV/FTC/TDF initiation until June 30, 2015, RPV/FTC/TDF discontinuation or failure to follow-up. Seventeen patients (8 in uVL and 9 in dVL group) with age between 11.6 and 17.6 were included. Reasons for switching were toxicity (n = 4) and simplification (n = 4) in uVL; viral failure (n = 8) and cART initiation (n = 1) in the dVL group. After a median follow-up of 90 (uVL) and 40 weeks (dVL), 7/8 (86%) patients maintained and 8/9 (89%) achieved and maintained HIV-1 suppression. Median CD4 count increased from 542 to 780/μL (uVL, P = 0.069) and 480 to 830/μL (dVL, P = 0.051). Five patients (2 in uVL and 3 in dVL) improved their immunological status from moderate to no immunosuppression. Serum lipid profiles improved in both groups; cholesterol dropped significantly in the dVL group (P = 0.008). Grade 1 laboratory adverse events (AEs) were observed in 3 patients. No clinical AEs occurred. Adherence was complete in 9 patients (5 in uVL and 4 in dVL); 1 adolescent interrupted treatment. Once-daily STR with RPV/FTC/TDF may be a safe and effective choice in selected HIV-1-infected adolescents and children. 
The aim of the study was to investigate the in vivo effect of abacavir (ABC) on platelet oxidative stress.
We performed a randomized pilot study including 39 HIV-1-infected patients, 17 on zidovudine/lamivudine (ZDV/3TC) and 22 on tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC). Ten patients on ZDV/3TC and eight patients on TDF/FTC were randomly allocated to switching the nucleoside backbone to ABC/3TC. At baseline and after 6 months, platelet oxidative stress was assessed by platelet NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2)-derived peptide (sNOX2-dp), a marker of NOX2 activation, and platelet prostaglandin F2α (8-iso-PGF2α ). Platelet activation was measured by soluble CD40L (sCD40L).
At baseline, no differences between ZDV/3TC or TDF/FTC recipients were found. After 6 months, patients switching from ZDV/3TC showed a decrease of sNOX2-dp (from 20.9±5.7 to 12.5±3.8 pg/ml, p=0.002) and 8-iso-PGF2α (from 154.3±41.9 to 122.9±28.0 pmol/l, p=0.025). No effects on platelet oxidative stress biomarkers were observed in subjects from TDF/FTC, who showed a significant increase in blood glucose (p=0.043) and total cholesterol (p=0.027). ABC showed no effect on sCD40L levels in both groups.
ABC reduced platelet sNOX2-dp and 8-iso-PGF2α in HIV-1 subjects switching from ZDV/3TC but not in those from TDF/FTC after 6 months. No changes in platelet activation were found in both groups.
Tea dietary fiber (TDF) was prepared from tea residues and modified to get cellulose-modified TDF (CTDF) by cellulase or micronized TDF (MTDF) by ultrafine grinding. The in vitro lipid-binding capacities of the three fibers and their effects on serum and hepatic lipid profiles in mice fed a high cholesterol diet were evaluated. The results showed that the three fibers had excellent lipid-binding capacities, and the cholesterol- and sodium cholate-binding capacities of CTDF and MTDF were significantly higher than those of TDF. Animal studies showed that, compared to model control, the three fibers significantly decreased mice average daily gain, gain: feed, and liver index, reduced total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride, and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol of serum and liver, increased serum and hepatic high density lipoprotein-cholesterol to TC ratio, and promoted the excretion of fecal lipids, and they also significantly increased the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase of serum and liver, and decreased lipid peroxidation; moreover, the effects of CTDF and MTDF were better than that of TDF. It was concluded that the three fibers could improve serum and hepatic lipid profiles in mice fed a high cholesterol diet and the mechanism of action might be due to the promotion of fecal excretion of lipids through their lipid-binding ability and the inhibition of lipid peroxidation. These findings suggest that tea dietary fiber has the potential to be used as a functional ingredient to control cardiovascular disease. 
HIV-seropositive patients show high incidence of coronary heart disease and oxidative stress has been described as relevant key in atherosclerosis development. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of omega 3 fatty acids on different markers of oxidative stress in HIV-seropositive patients. We performed a randomized parallel controlled clinical trial in The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, a public health hospital. 70 HIV-seropositive patients aged 20 to 55 on clinical score A1, A2, B1 or B2 receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) were studied. They were randomly assigned to receive omega 3 fatty acids 2.4 g (Zonelabs, Marblehead MA) or placebo for 6 months. At baseline and at the end of the study, anthropometric measurements, lipid profile, glucose and stress oxidative levels [nitric oxide catabolites, lipoperoxides (malondialdehyde plus 4-hydroxialkenals), and glutathione] were evaluated. Principal HAART therapy was EFV/TDF/FTC (55%) and AZT/3TC/EFV (15%) without difference between groups. Treatment with omega 3 fatty acids as compared with placebo decreased triglycerides (-0.32 vs. 0.54 mmol/L; p = 0.04), but oxidative stress markers were not different between groups.
We analysed the efficacy and safety of switching from a regimen based on nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) or integrase inhibitors (INI) to ABC/3TC + RPV in virologically suppressed HIV-infected patients. This multicentre, retrospective study comprised asymptomatic HIV-infected patients who switched from 2 NRTI + NNRTI or 2 NRTI + INI to ABC/3TC + RPV between February 2013 and December 2013; all had undetectable HIV viral load prior to switching. Efficacy and safety, and changes in lipids and cardiovascular risk (CVR) were analysed at 48 weeks. Of 85 patients (74.1 % men, mean age 49.5 years), 83 (97.6 %) switched from a regimen based on NNRTI (EFV 74, RPV 5, ETV 2, NVP 2), and 45 (53 %) switched from TDF/FTC to ABC/3TC. The main reasons for switching were toxicity (58.8 %) and convenience (29.4 %). At 48 weeks, 78 (91.8 %) patients continued taking the same regimen; efficacy was 88 % by intention to treat, and 96 % by per protocol. Two patients were lost to follow-up and five ceased the new regimen (4 due to adverse effects and 1 virologic failure). Mean CD4 cell counts increased (744 vs. 885 cells/μL; p = 0.0001), and there were mean decreases in fasting total cholesterol (-15.9 mg/dL; p &lt; 0.0001) and LDL-cholesterol (-11.0 mg/dL; p &lt; 0.004), with no changes in HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, total cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol ratio, and CVR. ABC/3TC + RPV is effective and safe in virologically-suppressed patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Forty-eight weeks after switching the lipid profile improved with decreases in total and LDL cholesterol.
We carried out a retrospective, multicenter study of a cohort of 298 asymptomatic HIV-infected patients who switched from a regimen based on 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors + protease inhibitor (PI)/nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or ritonavir-boosted PI monotherapy to emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/RPV/TDF) to analyze lipid changes. At 24 weeks, 284 (95.3%) patients were still taking the same regimen, maintaining similar CD4 counts as at baseline (651 versus 672 cells/mm(3), P = .08), and 98.9% of them with an undetectable viral load. Eight of the other 14 patients were lost to follow up and 6 (2.0%) ceased the new regimen: 3 due to adverse effects, 2 due to virologic failure, and 1 due to abandonment. The mean levels of fasting total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides fell at 12 and 24 weeks, with no changes detected in the TC to HDL-C ratio.
The treatment of HIV disease has led to a new division of management costs by shifting most of the necessary resources from inpatient treatment to outpatient management. Among the initiatives aimed at rationalising the resources available, we compared efficacy, tolerability and pharmacoeconomic impact of different regimes of antiretroviral therapy (ART). The survey covered the first 50 patients, clinically stable and with good viro-immunological response, who switched in June 2012 from an ART based on the triple combination of tenofovir (TDF), emtricitabine (FTC) and a protease inhibitor boosted with ritonavir (PI/r) or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), to a treatment based on abacavir (ABC), lamivudine (3TC) and a PI/r or NNRTI. Of the 50 patients who operated the switch, 39 replaced a PI with nevirapine (NVP), for which the largest group of patients was treated with ABC + 3TC + NVP. On 31 May 2015, all patients completed the observation period of 96 weeks, with a mean observation period of 132 weeks and clinical-laboratory checks every four months. Laboratory analysis revealed an optimal maintenance of viral suppression and absolute and relative number of CD4 + lymphocytes and improving trend of creatinine, proteinuria, serum phosphate and bone alkaline phosphatase. There was a variable effect on lipids, with a drop in triglycerides associated with a modest increase in total cholesterol. Much of the HIV-positive population reporting to our hospitals (&gt;50%) comprises individuals who have for years been in stable viraemic suppression, making a satisfactory immune recovery while in good overall clinical condition. This type of patient was the target of the present survey. At the end of 96 weeks of observation the new regimes were well tolerated and did not lead to viro-immunological or clinical deterioration. Pharmacoeconomic analysis showed better containment of the overall costs. No patient needed to be hospitalised during the observation period. 
To determine the prevalence of dyslipidemia in HIV-infected patients using the first-line antiretroviral (ARV) drugs triple regimen.
HIV-infected patients aged ≥15 years and attending Care and Treatment Clinic (CTC) at Muhimbili National Hospital, in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, were recruited for the study. Blood samples from patients were collected during their regular visits at the CTC and assayed for determination of total cholesterol, triglycerides (TGs), high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and CD4 counts.
The median CD4 count was 346 cells/mm(3) (2-2600). Triple therapy combinations of ARV drugs used by patients included zidovudine (ZDV)/lamivudine (3TC)/efavirenz (EFV; 42.4%), ZDV/3TC/nevirapine (NVP; 33.8%), tenofovir (TDF)/emtricitabine/EFV (19.9%), and TDF/3TC/EFV (3.9%). The overall prevalence of dyslipidemia in patients was 77.5%. There were varied prevalence of derangement of individual lipids among patients. Age, body mass index, CD4 count, sex, and duration of ARV drug use were the predictors of poor lipid profiles.
The findings of this study indicate the need for routine monitoring of lipids among HIV-infected patients.
Current guidelines recommend treatment optimization in virologically suppressed patients through switching/ simplification strategies to minimize long-term toxicities and improve adherence. The assessment of inflammation/ coagulation profiles may support therapeutic decisions. We undertook a prospective, non-randomized study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of switching to ABC/3TC from ZDV/3TC or TDF/FTC backbones, in 40 HIV-1 infected patients with HIV-RNA levels &lt;37 copies/mL (&gt;24 months). Main endpoints were viral load levels, CD4+ T cells and toxicities after 48 weeks. Serum inflammation/coagulation markers (ESR, CRP, D-dimer and fibrinogen) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, adiponectin, resistin) were evaluated. Baseline characteristics were similar in the two arms, with significantly lower values of e-GFR in patients on TDF/FTC. Markers of inflammation/ coagulation and cytokine profile were also similar, except for higher values of resistin in patients on TDF/ FTC. During follow up, CD4+ T cells increased and viral load remained undetectable in both groups. Patient from ZDV/3TC had significantly greater changes in total cholesterol and serum creatinine. Markers of inflammation/ coagulation remained unchanged. Adiponectin significantly increased in patients from ZDV/3TC. Switching to ABC/3TC was effective and safe. Inflammatory markers remained low in both groups. Some changes in metabolic, kidney and cytokine profiles were apparently specific for baseline cART treatment. 
Benefits and harms of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) in HIV-infected, antiretroviral treatment (ART)-naïve patients of any age have not been systematically reviewed since recent milestone trials were published.
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, SCI, LILACS, WHO GHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing TDF-based treatments with any other ART-regimen (last search 01/2015). Trial characteristics and results were extracted, risks of bias systematically assessed, and treatment effects synthesized in meta-analyses using random-effects models.
We included 22 RCTs (8297 patients). We found no differences between groups for mortality, AIDS, fractures, CD4 cell count, and virological failure; and inconclusive information due to inadequate reporting for cardiovascular events, renal failure, proteinuria, rash, and quality of life. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-based regimens significantly reduced total cholesterol (mean difference -18.42 mg/dl; 95% confidence interval [CI] -22.80 to -14.0), LDL-cholesterol (-9.53 mg/dl; -12.16 to -6.89), HDL-cholesterol (-2.97 mg/dl; -4.41 to -1.53), and triglycerides (-29.77 mg/dl; -38.61 to -20.92), bone mineral density (BMD) (hip: -1.41%; -1.87 to -0.94), and glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (-3.47 ml/minute; -5.89 to -1.06) over 48 weeks of follow-up. Effects were similar in trials comparing fixed-dose TDF/FTC-based regimens with ABC/3TC-based regimens. We found no influence of baseline viral load on virological failure.
Moderate-quality evidence suggests similar effects of TDF-based treatment regimens and other ART on virological failure. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-based regimens are associated with a more favorable lipid profile, but with increased risk of reduced BMD and eGFR. Improved reporting quality is vital to allow assessment of clinical outcomes in future trials.
Elevated endothelial arginase activity decreases nitric oxide (NO) production by competing with the substrate l-arginine, previously reported, and reciprocally regulating endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity. Thus, arginase inhibitors may help treat vascular diseases associated with endothelial dysfunction. A screening of metabolites from medicinal plants revealed that (2S)-5,2',5'-trihydroxy-7,8-dimethoxy flavanone (TDF) was a noncompetitive inhibitor of arginase. We investigated whether TDF reciprocally regulated endothelial NO production and its possible mechanism. TDF noncompetitively inhibited arginase I and II activity in a dose-dependent manner. TDF incubation decreased arginase activity and increased NO production in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and isolated mouse aortic vessels and reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in the endothelium of the latter. These TDF-mediated effects were associated with increased eNOS phosphorylation and dimerization but not with changes in protein content. Endothelium-dependent vasorelaxant responses to acetylcholine (Ach) were significantly increased in TDF-incubated aortic rings and attenuated by incubation with soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor. Phenylephrine-induced vasoconstrictor responses were markedly attenuated in TDF-treated vessels from wild-type mice. In atherogenic-prone ApoE(-/-) mice, TDF attenuated the high-cholesterol diet (HCD)-induced increase in arginase activity, which was accompanied by restoration of NO production and reduction of ROS generation. TDF incubation induced eNOS dimerization and phosphorylation at Ser1177. In addition, TDF improved Ach-dependent vasorelaxation responses and attenuated U46619-dependent contractile responses but did not change sodium nitroprusside-induced vasorelaxation or N-NAME-induced vasoconstriction. The findings suggest that TDF may help treat cardiovascular diseases by reducing pathophysiology derived from HCD-mediated endothelial dysfunction. 
Raltegravir (RAL) plus tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) is a recommended initial antiretroviral regimen. A substantial proportion of persons diagnosed with HIV infection and starting antiretrovirals in the U.S. are African-American (AA); however, the effects of this regimen on metabolic parameters have largely been studied in white patients.
Single-arm, open-label study of untreated AA HIV-infected patients administered RAL with TDF/FTC for 104 weeks. Changes in fasting lipids, insulin resistance, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), limb and trunk fat, and bone mineral density (BMD) were assessed at weeks 56 and 104.
Thirty (85% men) participants were included. Median entry characteristics included age of 38 years, CD4 323 cells/mm3, HIV RNA level 29,245 copies/ml, and body mass index 28.1 kg/m2. At 56 and 104 weeks, significant increases in VAT, trunk fat, limb fat, and overall fat were observed. Bone mineral density decreased by 1.5% by week 104.There were no significant changes in non-HDL-cholesterol, fasting triglycerides, or insulin resistance. A median CD4 cell count increase of 318 cells/mm3 (IQR 179, 403; full range 40, 749) (P&lt;0.001) was observed. Assuming missing=failure, 78 and 70% had HIV RNA levels&lt;40 copies/ml at weeks 56 and 104, respectively. There were no treatment-related discontinuations and no new antiretroviral resistance mutations were detected.
In this cohort of AAs, initiation of RAL with TDF/FTC was associated with significant general increases in fat. Significant changes in lipids or insulin resistance were not observed and there was a small decline in BMD. Therapy was well tolerated and effective. These results are consistent with findings of studies of initial antiretroviral therapy in racially diverse cohorts and inform treatment selection for AA patients starting therapy for HIV infection.
HIV treatment guidelines endorse switching or simplification of antiretroviral therapy in therapy-experienced patients with suppressed viraemia; ritonavir discontinuation may also enhance tolerability and reduce long-term adverse events (AEs). This open-label, multicentre, noninferiority study enrolled HIV-1-infected, treatment-experienced adults with confirmed HIV-1 RNA ≤ 75 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL currently receiving tenofovir/emtricitabine + atazanavir/ritonavir (TDF/FTC + ATV/r) for ≥ 6 months with no reported history of virological failure.
Participants were randomized 1:2 to continue current treatment or switch to abacavir/lamivudine + atazanavir (ABC/3TC + ATV). Endpoints included the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL by time to loss of virological response (TLOVR), AEs, fasting lipids, and inflammatory, coagulation, bone and renal biomarkers.
After 48 weeks, 76% (152 of 199) of ABC/3TC + ATV-treated and 79% (77 of 97) of TDF/FTC + ATV/r-treated participants had HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL (TLOVR; P = 0.564). Other efficacy analyses yielded similar results. Rates of new grade 2-4 AEs were 45% in both groups, but an excess of hyperbilirubinaemia made the rate of treatment-emergent grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities higher with TDF/FTC + ATV/r (36%) compared with ABC/3TC + ATV (19%). Most fasting lipid levels remained stable over time; high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol increased modestly in ABC/3TC + ATV-treated participants. Bone and renal biomarkers improved significantly between baseline and week 48 in participants taking ABC/3TC + ATV and were stable in participants taking TDF/FTC + ATV/r. No significant changes occurred in any inflammatory or coagulation biomarker within or between treatment groups.
The ABC/3TC + ATV treatment-switch group had similar viral suppression rates up to 48 weeks to the TDF/FTC + ATV/r comparator group, with lower rates of moderate- to high-grade hyperbilirubinaemia and improvements in bone and renal biomarkers.
It is unknown if tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), which is often coformulated with the lipid-neutral emtricitabine (FTC), has a lipid-lowering effect.
We performed a randomized, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected subjects with HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL during ≥6 months on stable darunavir/ritonavir (800/100 mg once daily) or lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily) monotherapy, fasting total cholesterol (TC) ≥200 mg/dL or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) ≥130 mg/dL, and no lipid-lowering drugs. In arm 1, TDF/FTC was added for 12 weeks, followed by 12 weeks of placebo (washout) and 12 additional weeks of placebo (placebo period). Subjects in arm 2 added placebo for 12 weeks (placebo period) followed by TDF/FTC for 12 weeks and placebo for 12 additional weeks (washout). The primary endpoint was change in median fasting TC levels.
Of 46 subjects enrolled, 56% received darunavir/ritonavir and 44% lopinavir/ritonavir. Exposure to TDF/FTC reduced TC from 234 to 205 mg/dL (P &lt; .001), LDL-c from 155 to 128 mg/dL (P &lt; .001), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) from 50.3 to 44.5 mg/dL (P &lt; .001). It also decreased the proportion of subjects with fasting TC ≥200 mg/dL from 86.7% to 56.8% (P = .001), and LDL-c ≥130 mg/dL from 87.8% to 43.9% (P &lt; .001). After 12 weeks, TDF/FTC exposure was associated with lower TC and LDL-c levels than placebo (P = .001 and P = .002, respectively). The TC/HDL-c ratio and triglyceride levels did not change with TDF/FTC exposure.
Coformulated TDF/FTC has an intrinsic lipid-lowering effect, likely attributable to TDF.
NCT01458977.
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is approved for children but concerns remain about long-term renal and bone toxicity. We evaluated the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of TDF in treatment-experienced children during 96 weeks.
This was a prospective, open-label study in HIV-infected children 3-18 years of age (≥15 kg), with viral suppression on their first-line regimen without tenofovir. Children were given TDF/lamivudine/efavirenz once daily at entry; TDF was prescribed according to weight bands. Age-, gender- and CD4-matched controls receiving TDF-sparing regimens were concomitantly enrolled. Tenofovir pharmacokinetic assessment was performed at week 4. CD4 counts, HIV-1 RNA viral load and safety assessments were determined at baseline, 24, 48 and 96 weeks.
Eighty children were enrolled (40 per group); 35 (44%) were male. Median age was 12.2 (range 3.1-17.7) years. The median administered dose was 214 mg/m. Tenofovir geometric mean AUC0-24 hours, Cmax and C24 hours were 2.66 [90% confidence interval (CI) 2.49-2.84] μg hours/mL, 0.26 (0.24-0.29) μg/mL and 0.057 (0.052-0.062) μg/mL, respectively. Estimated glomerular filtration rate did not significantly change overtime. The fractional excretion of calcium slightly increased but fractional excretion of phosphate was unchanged among children in TDF group. The bone mineral density Z score decreased in the first 24 weeks of TDF treatment and was stable afterward. The TDF group had lower cholesterol levels (P = 0.001). Thirty-nine of 40 children remained virologically suppressed. No serious adverse event related to tenofovir.
TDF substitution in children and adolescents who were otherwise stable while receiving a first-line nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based regimen achieved adequate exposure without clinically significant renal or bone adverse events over 96 weeks. While reassuring, these preliminary safety findings may not exclude delayed effects on renal function and bone density.
Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) is the first ritonavir-boosted protease-inhibitor used in second-line anti-retroviral treatment (ART) in resource-limited regions. To evaluate the efficacy and safety outcomes of LPV/r in treatment-naïve and -experienced HIV-infected adults and pregnant women, we performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Ten cohorts from 8 articles involving 2,584 ART-naïve patients, 5 cohorts from 4 articles involving 1,124 ART-experienced patients, and 8 cohorts from 7 articles involving 2,191 pregnant women were selected for the meta-analyses. For ART-naïve patients, the virologic response rate (72.3%) of LPV/r combined with tenofovir (TDF) plus lamivudine/emtricitabine (3TC/FTC) arms was significantly greater than that of LPV/r plus non-TDF-FTC arms (65.5%, p = 0.047). For ART-experienced patients, the use of LPV/r revealed a 55.7% probability of virologic success. The incidence of abnormal total cholesterol (6.9%) for ART-experienced patients was significantly lower than that for ART-naïve patients (13.1%, p &lt; 0.001). The use of LPV/r in pregnant women revealed a mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) rate of 1.1%, preterm birth rate of 13.2%, and low birth weight rate of 16.2%. Our meta-analysis indicated that LPV/r was an efficacious regimen for ART-naïve patients and was more tolerable for ART-experienced patients. LPV/r also displayed a significant effect in preventing MTCT. 
Drug choice and metabolic changes with antiretroviral therapy contribute to cardiovascular risk in persons with HIV-1 infection.
A randomized, 12 week, open-label, comparative study of the impact on lipids of continuation of abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) plus efavirenz (EFV) or replacement with the single tablet regimen of EFV/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF (EFV/FTC/TDF) in hypercholesterolaemic subjects on successful antiretroviral therapy, with a 12-week extension with all subjects on EFV/FTC/TDF.
157 subjects received study drug, 79 switched to EFV/FTC/TDF and 78 subjects continued ABC/3TC+EFV. At Week 12, 73 subjects on ABC/3TC+EFV switched to EFV/FTC/TDF. The switch was well tolerated and no subject experienced viral rebound. Median baseline fasting total cholesterol was 6.32 mmol/L. 12 weeks following switch, the difference in the means (LSM) between treatment groups (EFV/FTC/TDF minus ABC/3TC+EFV) in total cholesterol change from baseline was -0.74 mmol/l (95% CI -1.00, -0.47, p &lt; 0.001). The median change from baseline in total cholesterol following switch in the EFV/FTC/TDF arm was -0.86 mmol/l (p &lt; 0.001) compared with +0.01 mmol/l (p = 0.45) in the continuation arm at Week 12. Significant (p &lt; 0.001) differences between treatment groups following switch were seen for all lipid fractions from baseline to Week 12: LDL cholesterol (-0.47 mmol/L [-0.70, -0.25]), HDL cholesterol (-0.15 mmol/L [-0.21, -0.08]), triglycerides (-0.43 mmol/L [-0.75, -0.11]), and non HDL cholesterol (-0.56 mmol/L [-0.80, -0.31]). In the extension phase, similar declines in total cholesterol were observed with a median change from Week 12 to Week 24 of -0.73 mmol/L (p &lt; 0.001).
Switching from ABC/3TC+EFV to EFV/FTC/TDF in persons with hypercholesterolemia maintains virological control and significantly improves key lipid parameters.

Little is known about how different antiretrovirals effect inflammation and monocyte activation in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
We examined plasma specimens obtained during a randomized, double-blinded trial in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive HIV-infected adults which compared the efficacy of elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (EVG/c/FTC/TDF) with that of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (EFV/FTC/TDF). From a random sample achieving an HIV type 1 RNA load of &lt;50 copies/mL by week 48, changes over 24 and 48 weeks in levels of biomarkers of monocyte activation (soluble CD14 [sCD14] and soluble CD163 [sCD163]), systemic inflammation (soluble tumor necrosis factor α receptor I [sTNF-RI], interleukin 6 [IL-6], and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP]), and vascular inflammation (lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 [Lp-PLA2]) were compared. Multivariable linear regression was used.
A total of 200 participants were included. Significant differences favoring EVG/c/FTC/TDF were noted for changes in sCD14, hsCRP, and Lp-PLA2 levels. Factors independently associated with a larger decrease in the sCD14 level included random assignment to receive EVG/c/FTC/TDF, higher baseline sCD14 level, and larger decreases in hsCRP and sCD163 levels; factors associated with a larger Lp-PLA2 decrease included higher baseline Lp-PLA2 and IL-6 levels, smaller increases in total cholesterol and triglycerides levels, a larger decrease in the sCD14 level, and a smaller decrease in the sCD163 level.
EVG/c/FTC/TDF led to greater decreases in sCD14, hsCRP, and Lp-PLA2 levels, compared with EFV/FTC/TDF. Randomization group independently predicted the change in sCD14 level, and changes in monocyte activation independently predicted the change in Lp-PLA2 level. There appears to be a more favorable effect of the integrase inhibitor EVG over efavirenz on immune activation, which may affect vascular inflammation.
Enzymatic- gravimetric method was used to obtain three fractions of dietary from defatted rice bran. The functional and physiological properties such as viscosity, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and glucose dialysis retardation index (GDRI), cholesterol and bile salt adsorption capacity of the resultant fractions were evaluated. Insoluble dietary fibre (IDF) and soluble dietary fibre (SDF) when compared showed that SDF exhibited significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher viscosity (2.35 mPa.s), greater GDRI value (17.65 %) at 60 min and significantly lowered concentration of cholesterol at pH 7 (29.90 %, p &lt; 0.05). However IDF showed the highest CEC and its adsorption capacity of bile salt was higher than SDF (18.20 % vs. 13.76 %; p &lt; 0.05), while CEC and cholesterol absorption capacity of TDF were similar to SDF. These properties indicate that rice bran soluble, insoluble and total fibres are functional ingredients which can be added to various food products and dietetic, low-calorie high-fiber foods to enhance their nutraceutical properties and health benefits. 
The advent of combined antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the past decade has led to HIV suppression in most cases. Virological failure was the main reason for ART switch a few years ago; however, toxicity and treatment simplification have now gained importance due to the availability of more effective and convenient drugs. This study assessed the reasons for ART switch in daily practice.
Observational retrospective study that included patients whose ART was switched between January 2011 and July 2012. Patients with any other switch during the follow-up period (until September 2013) were excluded.
A total of 246 patients were included. Main reasons for ART switch were simplification (33%) and toxicity (31%), followed by clinical trial inclusion (13%), virological failure (6%), drug interaction (4%), patient decision (3%), lack of adherence (2%), pregnancy (1%) and other (8%). Eighty patients switched to a simpler regimen (median age 48 [40-53], mean CD4 count 608±265 cells/cl, 89% &lt;50 copies/ml, mean number of previous regimens 6±5, mean time on previous ART 3±2 years). In this case, previous ART mostly included 2NRTI+1PI/r (54%) (Figure 1). The simplification strategy mainly contained nuke-sparing regimens (60%) based on PI (DRV/r 48%): monotherapy 46%, dual therapy 13% (PI/r+maraviroc 9%, PI/r+NNRTI 4%) and triple therapy 1% (PI/r+maraviroc+raltegravir). The second preferred simplification option was 2NRTI+1NNRTI (24%). Seventy-seven patients switched due to toxicities (median age 47 [43-53], mean CD4 count 606±350 cells/μl, &lt;50 copies/ml 82%, mean number of previous regimens 4±3, mean time on previous ART 3±3 years). Renal (25%) and CNS (18%) toxicities were the main reasons for ART switch, followed by diarrhoea (16%), liver enzyme elevation (ALT 10%; AST 9%; bilirubin 7%), lipid elevation (cholesterol 5%; triglycerides 8%), nausea (7%) and other (=5%) (Figure 2). All patients with renal toxicity were under TDF and in most cases this drug was removed from the new regimen (with 3TC/ABC or nuke-sparing). Among patients with CNS toxicity, 79% were taking EFV; the main new treatment was a second-generation NNRTI (ETR)+2NRTI. Toxicities were completely resolved in 66% of patients, partially resolved in 22% and not resolved in only 12%; the median time from ART switch to toxicity resolution was 4 (2-8) months.
The main reasons for ART switch in daily practice are simplification and toxicities, renal and CNS toxicities being the most prevalent. The preferred simplification strategies are nuke-sparing regimens, mainly DRV/r-based monotherapy and dual therapy. ART switch leads to a complete resolution of toxicities in most cases in the short term.
According to recent evidence about boosted protease inhibitors (PIs/r)-simplified regimens, the combination of 3TC and DRV/r 800/100 mg could represent a feasible option for optimizing antiretroviral therapy (ART) in treatment-experienced HIV+ patients.
We retrospectively evaluated patients switching to 3TC+DRV/r, with at least six months of viral suppression, no resistance mutation to DRV or 3TC and not HBV-coinfected: incidence of ART discontinuation and of virological failure (VF: 2 consecutive HIV-RNA determinations&gt;49 cps/mL or a single one≥1000 cps/mL) and the probability of remaining discontinuation-free during one-year follow-up (FU), as well as changes in laboratory parameters at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months were estimated.
We included 94 patients: 74 males, mostly MSM (39.4%), with 49 years old, 9 years of HIV disease, 8 years of ART (median values). Median nadir CD4 count and zenith viral load (log10) were 194 cells/µL and 4.90, respectively. Ten patients were HCV-coinfected and 38 had at least a previous VF. Seventy-four patients were on an NRTIs-based triple regimen (mainly TDF/FTC or 3TC/ABC) whereas 14 on another PI-based dual therapy (mainly LPV/r). Incidence of treatment discontinuation was 12.4 per 100 patients-year follow-up (PYFU), but only 2 patients experienced a VF (3.5 per 100 PYFU). Mean time free from discontinuation was 5 years (95% CI 4-6), with a cumulative one-year estimated probability of staying on 3TC+DRV/r of 85.9%. At three months, a trend of increased CD4 cells count (+42 cells/µL, p 0.059) was observed, but not confirmed at later time point; an increase of total cholesterol (TC, +17mg/dL, p 0.008) and LDL (+19 mg/dL, p 0.002), and a decreased level of AST and ALT (-2 UI/L, p 0.045; -5 UI/L, p 0.009, respectively) were also detected. Total bilirubin was reduced (-0.71 mg/dL, p 0.038). At 6 and 12 months, alteration of lipid profile was similar, with also an increased TC/HDL ratio (+0.48, p=0.030, at six months) and HDL/LDL ratio (-0.04, p=0.035, at 12 months). A significant decrease in ALT levels (-6 UI/L, 0.013) and a diminishing trend for AST and total bilirubin, as well as a significant increase in renal function (GFR +4mL/min, p 0.048) were observed at 12 months.
These observations on 3TC+DRV/r-based dual therapy simplification in virologically suppressed patients show a good profile of efficacy and safety. An extended FU time is needed in order to establish the real impact of this promising therapeutic choice.
To assess efficacy and safety of treatment simplification to co-formulated Rilpivirine/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir (RPV/FTC/TDF) in virologically suppressed patients.
Endpoints of the analysis were: (a) treatment discontinuation of RPV/FTC/TDF for any reasons and (b) occurrence of virological failure (VF) defined as confirmed HIV-RNA &gt;50 cp/mL).
Overall, 508 patients from five Italian reference centres were included: male gender 71.9%; median age 47 years (IQR 40-52); IVDU as HIV risk 17.7%; HCV-AB positive 23.4%; CDC-C stage 17.5%; median CD4 cells/µL at switch 655 (IQR: 487-843); median number of previous regimens three (IQR 2-7). In a median follow-up of 196 days (IQR: 84-287), 31 patients discontinued RPV/FTC/TDF (virological failure n=5, hypersensitivity reaction n=2, GI-toxicity n=6, liver toxicity n=1, CNS-toxicity n=4, kidney toxicity n=5, patient's decision/lost in follow-up n=10). Moreover, VF occurred in eight patients (five discontinued regimen, while three remained on RPV/FTC/TDF). At survival analysis, the probabilities of treatment discontinuation or VF were 5.5% and 1.2% at 6 months, 13.2% and 2.8% at 12 months, respectively (Figure 1). At adjusted Cox model, factors associated with discontinuation were: &lt;200 CD4 cells/µL at switch (HR 5.3, 95% CI 1.1-25.9, p=0.038), number of pre-switch regimens (for each extra regimen: HR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.10, p=0.024), male gender (HR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.9, p=0.032). Only the number of pre-switch regimens was associated with VF (HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.06-1.21, p=0.001). Type of pre-switch regimen was not associated with discontinuation or failure, but no VF was observed if switching from co-formulated Efavirenz/FTC/TDF or from Raltegravir containing regimens. Switching to RPV/FTC/TDF led to significant improvement in fasting lipids levels: the decrease in cholesterol, LDL and triglycerides was observed switching from any regimen, but was more marked from boosted PI. In contrast, a moderate increase in transaminase (switching from all regimens except NNRTI-containing) and creatinine (except from TDF-containing regimens) were observed.
Our data suggest that switching to RPV/FTC/TDF in virologically suppressed patients could be a good strategy with low risk of virological failure or treatment discontinuation; the switch is also associated with significant improvement in lipid profile.
TDF/FTC/RPV has been shown effective in both naïve and PI-pre-treated patients. Less is known about a switch strategy in subjects receiving EFV.
We evaluated viro-immunologic outcomes, Quality of Life (QoL) and costs of an unselected cohort of patients switching from a TDF/FTC/EFV STR (≥6 months duration) to a TDF/FTC/RPV STR. The considered outcome measures were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as measured with the EQ5D questionnaire and the overall direct health costs. 64 patients with a baseline viral load&lt;50 copies/mL were randomized to immediately switch therapy or to continue TDF/FTC/EFV for four months and then switch to TDF/FTC/RPV. Six patients in the deferred switch group did not actually change cART.
Patients were mostly males (73.4%) with a mean age of 46 years, a baseline mean HIV-RNA of 6.4 copies/mL and a mean baseline CD4 count of 588 cells/µL. For the considered follow-up period, the mean cost per patient resulted 2,563 for TDF/FTC/RPV and 2,572 for TDF/FTC/EFV. Viremia remained undetectable and CD4 stable in all patients. Over time the mean QoL increased in the RPV arm ad slightly decreased in the EFV arm, after four months the mean per patient QALYs was 0.849 for RPV and 0.841 for EFV, respectively (Figure 1). A sharp increment of QoL was observed in the deferred-switch arm after switch, too. VAS analysis of health status perception also increased overall from 82.78 to 83.79 due to the improvement in the RPV arm. Mean cholesterol levels improved in the RPV arm from 203 to 170 mg/dL, while an increment from 190 to 207 mg/dL was observed in the EFV arm. HDL levels lowered from 49 to 45 and rose from 53 to 54 mg/dL in the RPV and EFV arms, respectively. Triglycerides levels improved both in the RPV arm (from 138 to 112 mg/dL) and in the EFV arm (from 110 to 103 mg/dL).
Switching from TDF/FTC/EFV to TDF/FTC/RPV is a safe, well tolerated strategy that improves the overall health status of HIV-treated patients. The switch does not expose patients to a risk of virologic failure due to possible PK interactions of the drugs. RPV compared to EFV proved to be cost-effective showing lower cost and higher outcome measure values.
Two elvitegravir/cobicistat-based therapies combined with emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (EVG/c/FTC/TDF) or emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (EVG/c/FTC/TAF) are currently available for HIV patients. This study evaluated the modifications in the lipid profile of patients who received these treatments in the last three years at our institution. A retrospective observational study in HIV-infected patients who received EVG/c/FTC/TDF or EVG/c/FTC/TAF from January 2015 to January 2018 at a reference hospital in northwestern Spain was carried out. Epidemiological, clinical and immunovirological data were recorded. A statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software. A total of 384 EVG/c-based therapies were initiated during the study period, 151 EVG/c/FTC/TDF and 233 EVG/c/FTC/TAF. A significantly negative influence in all the lipid profile parameters in experienced patients and total cholesterol (TC), and LDL-C in naïve patients were observed after 48 weeks of treatment with EVG/c/FTC/TAF, while these parameters remained stable in the EVG/c/FTC/TDF group. During follow-up, a greater proportion of patients had lipid levels above the normal range (63.1% TC, 56.2% LDL-C) and new lipid-modifying drugs were prescribed (11.9%) in the EVG/c/FTC/TAF group. The number of cardiovascular risk factors (OR 1.66 [95% CI 1.01-2.72]; P = 0.043) was recognised as an independent predictor of lipid-lowering prescription for patients treated with both EVG/c/FTC/TDF and EVG/c/FTC/TAF. For patients treated with EVG/c/FTC/TAF, the mean total cholesterol to HDL ratio in the first 48 weeks of the study treatment was associated with a higher likelihood of lipid-lowering prescription in multivariate analysis (OR 1.6 [95% CI 1.12-2.52]; P = 0.011). Significant changes in lipid profile have been observed in patients who have received EVG/c/FTC/TAF. It was necessary to prescribe almost twice the number of lipid-lowering drugs to patients who received EVG/c/FTC/TAF (11.9%) vs EVG/c/FTC/TDF (4.7%).
Doravirine (DOR), a novel non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), is active against wild-type Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1 and the most common NNRTI-resistant variants, and has a favorable and unique in vitro resistance profile.
DRIVE-AHEAD is a phase 3, double-blind, non-inferiority trial. Antiretroviral treatment-naive adults with ≥1000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL were randomized (1:1) to once-daily, fixed-dose DOR at 100 mg, lamivudine at 300 mg, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) at 300 mg (DOR/3TC/TDF) or to efavirenz at 600 mg, emtricitabine at 200 mg, and TDF at 300 mg (EFV/FTC/TDF) for 96 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of participants with &lt;50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL at week 48 (Food and Drug Administration snapshot approach; non-inferiority margin 10%).
Of the 734 participants randomized, 728 were treated (364 per group) and included in the analyses. At week 48, 84.3% (307/364) of DOR/3TC/TDF recipients and 80.8% (294/364) of EFV/FTC/TDF recipients achieved &lt;50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL (difference 3.5%, 95% CI, -2.0, 9.0). DOR/3TC/TDF recipients had significantly lower rates of dizziness (8.8% vs 37.1%), sleep disorders/disturbances (12.1% vs 25.2%), and altered sensorium (4.4% vs 8.2%) than EFV/FTC/TDF recipients. Mean changes in fasting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) were significantly different between DOR/3TC/TDF and EFV/FTC/TDF (-1.6 vs +8.7 mg/dL and -3.8 vs +13.3 mg/dL, respectively).
In HIV-1 treatment-naive adults, DOR/3TC/TDF demonstrated non-inferior efficacy to EFV/FTC/TDF at week 48 and was well tolerated, with significantly fewer neuropsychiatric events and minimal changes in LDL-C and non-HDL-C compared with EFV/FTC/TDF.

Efavirenz (EFV), the most popular nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, has been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction in most in vitro studies. However, in real life the prevalence of EFV-induced mitochondrial toxicity is relatively low. We hypothesized that the agents given in combination with EFV moderate the effect of EFV on mitochondrial function. To test this hypothesis, we cultured a human T lymphoblastoid cell line (CEM cells) with EFV alone and in combination with emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) to investigate the effects on mitochondrial respiration and function and cholesterol biosynthesis. There was a statistically significant concentration- and time-dependent apoptosis, reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential, and increase in production of reactive oxygen species in cells treated with either EVF alone or in combination with TDF plus FTC. Compared to dimethyl sulfoxide-treated cells, EFV-treated cells had significant reduction in oxygen consumption rate contributed by basal mitochondrial respiration and decreased protein expression of electron transport chain complexes (CI, CII, and CIV). Treatment with EFV resulted in a decrease in mitochondrial DNA content and perturbation of more coding genes (n = 13); among these were 11 genes associated with lipid or cholesterol biosynthesis. Our findings support the growing body of knowledge on the effects of EFV on mitochondrial respiration and function and cholesterol biosynthesis. Interestingly, combining TDF and FTC with EFV did not alter the effects of EFV on mitochondrial respiration and function and cholesterol biosynthesis. The gap between the prevalence of EFV-induced mitochondrial toxicity in in vitro and in vivo studies could be due to individual differences in the pharmacokinetics of EFV.
To analyse lipid changes and tolerability in a cohort of HIV-infected patients who switched their antiretroviral regimens to rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir (RPV/FTC/TDF) in a real-world setting.
PRO-STR is a 48 week prospective observational post-authorization study in 25 hospitals. Patients with a viral load &lt;1000 copies/mL, receiving at least 12 months of combination ART (cART), with constant posology for at least the prior 3 months, were categorized according to previous treatment [NNRTI or ritonavir-boosted PI (PI/r)]. Analytical tests were performed at the baseline visit, between week 16 and week 32, and at week 48.
A total of 303 patients were included (mean age 46.6 years; male 74.0%; previous treatment 74.7% NNRTI and 25.3% PI/r). Both groups exhibited significantly reduced lipid profiles, except for HDL cholesterol, for which a non-significant increase was observed. [NNRTI patients: total cholesterol (baseline: 195.5 ± 38.4 mg/dL; week 48: 171.0 ± 35.5 mg/dL), total cholesterol/HDL ratio (baseline: 4.2 ± 1.2; week 48: 4.0 ± 1.2), HDL (baseline: 49.1 ± 12.0 mg/dL; week 48: 49.2 ± 45.8 mg/dL), LDL (baseline: 119.2 ± 30.2 mg/dL; week 48: 114.2 ± 110.7 mg/dL), and triglycerides (baseline: 136.6 ± 86.8 mg/dL; week 48: 113.4 ± 67.8 mg/dL); PI/r patients: total cholesterol (baseline: 203.2 ± 48.8 mg/dL; week 48: 173.4 ± 36.9 mg/dL), total cholesterol/HDL ratio (baseline: 4.7 ± 1.6; week 48: 4.0 ± 1.2), HDL (baseline: 46.4 ± 12.5 mg/dL; week 48: 52.1 ± 54.4 mg/dL), LDL (baseline: 127.0 ± 36.3 mg/dL; week 48: 111.4 ± 35.8 mg/dL), and triglycerides (baseline: 167.6 ± 107.7 mg/dL; week 48: 122.7 ± 72.1 mg/dL)]. The most common intolerances were neuropsychiatric in the NNRTI patients and gastrointestinal and metabolic in the PI/r patients, and these intolerances were significantly reduced in both groups at week 48 [NNRTI: neuropsychiatric (baseline: 81.3%; week 48: 0.0%); PI/r: gastrointestinal (baseline: 48.7%; week 48: 0.0%) and metabolic (baseline: 42.1%; week 48: 0.0%)].
RPV/FTC/TDF improved the lipid profiles and reduced the intolerances after switching from NNRTI or PI-based regimens, in a cohort of HIV-infected patients.
Rilpivirine is associated with a good efficacy and safety profile. However, data from real-life settings are scarce.
We investigated the durability, safety and efficacy of Rilpivirine-based antiretroviral therapy in a prospective, observational, multicenter study.
We enrolled 499 HIV-infected patients, 360 (72.1%) males, mean age 43.4 ± 10.5 years, mean CD4 600 ± 327 cell/μL, mean HIV-RNA 3.80 ± 1.15 log10 cp/mL. After a median follow up of 16 months, 81 (16.2%) interruptions were reported, 36 (7.2%) of which for adverse events (16 of grade ≥3), most commonly neurological and gastrointestinal. We observed virological failures in only 8 (1.6%) patients. Naive patients showed a significant reduction in eGFR at week 24, 48 and 72 and in total cholesterol (TC)/HDL ratio at week 48 (p=0.007). In patients switching from PI we found a significant decrease at week 24 and 48 in TC and triglycerides at week 24, 48 and 72. eGFR showed a significant decrease at week 48 and 72. TC/HDL ratio showed a statistically significant decrease at week 24 (p=0.0008) and 72 (p=0.04). A significant increase at week 24 and 48 in AST and ALT values was observed. Patients switching from TDF/FTC/EFV showed a reduction in HDL, total cholesterol and triglycerides at week 24 and 48 and in eGFR at all follow up times. TC/HDL ratio showed a significant decrease at week 48 (p=0.01). CDC stage C and antiretroviral-experience (especially Protease Inhibitors) were associated with RPV discontinuation.
In conclusion, our data confirm Rilpivirine efficacy, safety and tolerability with improvement in lipid profile. Although hepatic and renal events rarely caused discontinuation, liver and kidney parameters should be monitored.
To investigate efficacy and safety of a single-tablet regimen of darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (D/C/F/TAF) 800/150/200/10 mg vs. darunavir/cobicistat plus emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxyl fumarate (TDF) (control) in antiretroviral-treatment-naive, HIV-1-infected adults.
Phase-3, randomized, active-controlled, double-blind, international, multicenter, noninferiority study (NCT02431247).
Seven hundred and twenty-five participants were randomized (1 : 1) to D/C/F/TAF (362) or control (363). The primary objective was to demonstrate noninferiority of D/C/F/TAF vs. control for percentage viral load less than 50 copies/ml (FDA-snapshot analysis) at 48 weeks (10% margin).
At week 48, D/C/F/TAF was noninferior to control (91.4 vs. 88.4% achieved viral load &lt;50 copies/ml, respectively; difference 2.7%; 95% CI -1.6 to 7.1; P &lt; 0.0001), with 4.4 vs. 3.3% of patients, respectively, having viral load greater or equal to 50 copies/ml. No treatment-emergent mutations associated with darunavir or TAF/TDF resistance were observed in either group. One patient (D/C/F/TAF) was identified with M184I/V conferring resistance to emtricitabine. Incidences of grades 3 and 4 adverse events (5 vs. 6%), serious adverse events (5 vs. 6%) and adverse event-related discontinuations (2 vs. 4%) were low and similar between groups. Mean decrease in urine protein/creatinine ratio was greater with D/C/F/TAF than control (-22.42 vs. -10.34 mg/g, P = 0.033). Mean percentage change in bone mineral density with D/C/F/TAF vs. control was 0.21 vs. -2.73%, P &lt; 0.0001 (hip), -0.68 vs. -2.38%, P = 0.004 (lumbar spine), and -0.26 vs. -2.97%, P &lt; 0.0001 (femoral neck). Median change from baseline in total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio was 0.20 vs. 0.08, P = 0.036.
D/C/F/TAF achieved a high virologic suppression rate (91.4%) and was noninferior to darunavir/cobicistat with F/TDF. D/C/F/TAF also demonstrated the bone and renal safety advantages of TAF in combination with darunavir/cobicistat.
Antiretroviral drugs have been associated with changes in lipids, fat mass and dat distribution. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) has been shown to have a more favorable metabolic profile than other drugs in its class. However, the metabolic effects of TDF in preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) are unknown.
We evaluated the effects of TDF/emtricitabine (FTC) on lipids and body composition in a blinded, placebo-controlled PrEP trial. Participants enrolled in a metabolic subcohort (N = 251, TDF/FTC; N = 247, placebo) consented to fasting lipid panels, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans for body composition, and pharmacologic testing of drug metabolites at baseline and every 24 weeks thereafter.
Lean body mass was stable and unaffected by TDF/FTC. Body weight increased in both groups but was lower on TDF/FTC through week 72. This difference was explained by lower fat accumulation on TDF/FTC. The net median percent difference (standard error, P value) for TDF/FTC vs placebo at week 24 was -0.8% (0.4%, P = .02), +0.3% (0.4%, P = .46), and -3.8% (1.4%, P = .009) for total, lean, and fat mass, respectively. There was no apparent differential regional fat accumulation on TDF/FTC. Decreases in cholesterol, but not triglycerides, were seen in TDF/FTC participants, with detectable drug levels compared to placebo.
TDF/FTC for PrEP showed cholesterol reductions and appeared to transiently suppress the accumulation of weight and body fat compared to placebo. There was no evidence of altered fat distribution or lipodystrophy during daily oral TDF/FTC PrEP.

Abacavir-lamivudine (ABC/3TC) and tenofovir-emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) represent in the guidelines of several countries, including Italy and United States, the preferred nucleoside/nucleotide backbones of antiretroviral regimens. We assessed their profile in pregnancy using data from a national observational study.
Laboratory measures (CD4, HIV-RNA, lipid profile, glucose, hemoglobin, and alanine transferase) and pregnancy outcomes (preterm delivery, low birthweight, nonelective cesarean section, birthweight Z-score, congenital defects, HIV transmission, maternal weight gain, and pregnancy complications) were compared after prenatal exposure to ABC/3TC or TDF/FTC.
The study evaluated 913 pregnancies (ABC/3TC: 252; TDF/FTC: 661). At entry in pregnancy, women on TDF/FTC were older (33.6 vs. 32.4 years, P = 0.005), less frequently on treatment (66.9% vs. 80.2%, P &lt; 0.001), and had lower CD4 counts (475/mm vs. 533/mm, P = 0.003) and higher plasma HIV-RNA levels (2.48 vs. 2.22 log10 copies/mL, P = 0.003). Women on ABC/3TC had more commonly hypertension/nephropathy (5.2% vs. 2.0%, P = 0.013). No major differences were observed in the main pregnancy outcomes and in rates of undetectable HIV-RNA at third trimester. In a subgroup analysis that evaluated at third trimester only cases with regular 3-drug treatment during pregnancy, women on TDF/FTC had lower hemoglobin levels (median: 11.1 vs. 11.8 g/dL, P = 0.002) and women on ABC/3TC had higher levels of total cholesterol (median: 230 vs. 216 mg/dL, P = 0.023) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (133 vs. 111 mg/dL, P = 0.030).
In this study, use of TDF/FTC and ABC/3TC in pregnancy was associated with similar pregnancy outcomes and with some differences in laboratory measures that might guide physicians' prescriptions in mothers with hematologic or metabolic risk factors.
Insulin resistance and lipid changes are common after antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation. Observational studies suggest that vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk of developing diabetes and improves lipid profiles.
This 48-week prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated high-dose vitamin D3 (4000 IU daily) plus calcium supplementation (1000 mg calcium carbonate daily) in HIV-infected participants initiating ART with efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir (EFV/FTC/TDF). Changes in insulin resistance (as estimated by homeostatic model assessment), fasting lipid profile, and components of the metabolic syndrome were assessed at baseline, 24 weeks, and 48 weeks. Stratified Wilcoxon rank sum tests and stratified normal score tests were used to evaluate differences between treatment arms, stratified by screening 25-OH vitamin D stratum (≤/&gt;20 ng/mL).
A total of 165 participants enrolled: 79 in the vitamin D/calcium (Vit D/Cal) arm and 86 in the placebo arm. Only the placebo arm experienced a modest increase in insulin resistance at week 24 (P &lt; .001). While increases in total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significant in both arms at weeks 24 and 48, increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol at week 24 were only identified in the placebo arm (P = .011). Body mass index remained stable, whereas modest increases in waist circumference were observed in the placebo arm. Metabolic syndrome was present in 19 participants (12%) at baseline and 20 participants (14%) at week 48, without differences between arms.
Vit D/Cal supplementation over 48 weeks did not alter the lipid profile or glucose metabolism experienced with initiation of EFV/FTC/TDF in ART-naïve persons. Vitamin D supplementation is unlikely to be an effective strategy to attenuate metabolic dysregulations with ART initiation.
In the general population, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol efflux capacity (HCEC) relates inversely to incident cardiovascular events. Previous studies have suggested that HCEC is decreased in HIV and that antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation might improve HCEC.
To evaluate HCEC in the context of ART initiation and immune activation in HIV.
Baseline HCEC from 10 ART-naive HIV-infected males and 12 prospectively matched non-HIV-infected males were analyzed. In the HIV cohort, HCEC 6 months after elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (E/C/F/TDF) therapy was evaluated. HCEC served as the primary outcome and was measured by the ability of J774 mouse macrophages to efflux cholesterol. Our ex vivo assay used two cholesterol acceptors [apolipoprotein B (apoB)-depleted sera or purified HDL] and modulation of cellular efflux pathways using a liver X receptor (LXR) agonist.
The median age was 34 years [interquartile range (IQR), 27 to 51], and baseline HDL was 46 mg/dL (IQR, 38 to 61). HCEC was significantly greater in the non-HIV-infected subjects than in the HIV-infected subjects at baseline. HCEC, assessed using apoB-depleted sera, significantly increased after ART (no LXR agonist, baseline: median, 8.1%; IQR, 7.0% to 11.9%; after ART: median, 12.9%; IQR, 10.4% to 21.1%; P = 0.006; LXR agonist, baseline, 1.3% ± 1.3%; after ART, 2.5% ± 1.0%; P = 0.02), although not to the levels in the non-HIV-infected subjects (no LXR agonist: median, 14.9%; IQR, 11.5% to 19.1%; LXR agonist: 5.8% ± 1.3%). HCEC, assessed using purified HDL, did not significantly increase after ART. The change in HCEC with ART related inversely to the change in the percentage of CD14-CD16+ (nonclassical) monocytes (ρ = -0.74, P = 0.04) and directly to the change in the percentage of CD14+CD16- (classical) monocytes (ρ = 0.72, P = 0.045).
Our data suggest improvement of HCEC with E/C/F/TDF and a relationship between the ART-induced decrease in immune activation and ART-induced improvement in HCEC.
This study evaluates the effectiveness, safety and costs of switching to a rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (RPV/FTC/TDF) regimen in treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected patients with sustained virological suppression.
Observational, prospective study. Study population included all treatment-experienced patients with sustained virological suppression who switched to RPV/FTC/TDF during 2013 in a tertiary hospital. Patients were followed until they completed 96 weeks of treatment. The effectiveness end-point was defined as the proportion of patients who maintained virological suppression at week 96 by intention-to-treat analysis (discontinuation=failure). The safety of RPV/FTC/TDF (incidence of adverse events leading to discontinuation and laboratory abnormalities) and adherence to this regimen were evaluated, and the cost of switching was analysed.
One-hundred forty-six patients were included. At week 96, 71.9% of patients remained virologically suppressed; 6.8% experienced virological failure. During follow-up, 25.3% of patients discontinued RPV/FTC/TDF (14.4% because of adverse events, mainly renal impairment). Throughout the 96 weeks, there were significant decreases in total cholesterol (TC) (14.0 mg/dL, P&lt;.001), TC/HDL cholesterol ratio (0.4 mg/dL, P=.019) and triglycerides (42.0 mg/dL, P&lt;.001). A slight decrease in glomerular filtration rate was observed (4.3 mL/min/1.73 m2 , P&lt;.001). Switching to RPV/FTC/TDF improved adherence in the subgroup of patients whose previous treatment was based on a twice-daily schedule, although differences did not reach statistical significance. Switching to RPV/FTC/TDF reduced the annual per-patient antiretroviral cost by €1744 (P&lt;.001).
In virologically suppressed patients, the switch to a RPV/FTC/TDF regimen was associated with a mild but maintained improvement in lipid parameters and a significant reduction in costs. However, the relatively high rates of virological failure and treatment discontinuation because of adverse events make this combination a less favourable choice over other regimens currently available.
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and entecavir (ETV) are first-line treatments for chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Studies suggest lipid lowering effect of TDF in human immunodeficiency virus positive (HIV+) individuals, but the effect on lipids and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in CHB is unknown.
To compare TDF vs ETV effects on lipid levels in CHB.
In this retrospective cohort study, data on serum lipids and CVD risk factors at baseline and ~1 year on TDF or ETV were collected from CHB carriers. We used propensity score matched models to assess the effect on total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C, HDL and triglycerides (TGL).
In 348 patients, median age was 57 (IQR: 47-65 years), 63% were male, 77% were Asian, 19% were cirrhotic, 25% were HBeAg positive at baseline, and 72% received TDF vs 28% ETV. ETV-treated patients were older (median age: 60 vs 55, P&lt;.01), had similar smoking and hypertension rates, but diabetes and dyslipidemia were more prevalent (19% vs 9%, P=.01; 14% vs 6%, P=.05, respectively). In propensity score matched models for age, gender, usage of lipid lowering agents, dyslipidemia and diabetes, TDF-treated patients were more likely to show a 20% decrease in TC (95% CI: 3%-25%), LDL-C (95% CI: 1%-25%) and HDL-C (CI: 10%-30%) levels compared with those on ETV. No change in TGL was observed in either group.
A greater decline in TC, LDL-C and HDL was observed in CHB carriers receiving TDF compared with ETV. These data may influence anti-viral choice in CHB carriers at risk for CVD.
To investigate metabolic changes associated with second-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) following virological failure of first-line ART.
SECOND-LINE was an open-label randomized controlled trial. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) with 2-3 nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (N[t]RTI group) or raltegravir (RAL group). 210 participants had a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-scan at baseline, week 48 and 96. We categorized participants according to second-line ART backbone: thymidine analogue (ta-NRTI) + lamivudine/emtricitabine (3[F]TC; ta-NRTI group); tenofovir (TDF)+3(F)TC (TDF group); TDF+ta-NRTI ±3(F)TC (TDF+ta-NRTI group); RAL. Changes in fasted total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, TC/HDL-cholesterol ratio, triglycerides and glucose from baseline to week 96 were examined. We explored the association between metabolic and DXA-assessed soft-tissue changes. Linear regression methods were used.
We analysed 454 participants. Participants in RAL group had greater TC increases, TC (adjusted mean difference [aMD]=0.65, 95% CI 0.33, 0.96), LDL-c (aMD=0.38, 95% CI 0.15, 0.61) and glucose (aMD=0.47, 95% CI -0.01, 0.92) compared to TDF group, and had greater increases in TC (aMD=0.65, 95% CI 0.28, 1.03), HDL-c (aMD=0.12, 95% CI 0.02, 0.23) and LDL-c (aMD=0.41, 95% CI 0.13, 0.69) compared to TDF+ta-NRTI group. TC/HDL ratio and triglycerides increased in all groups without significant differences between groups. A 1 kg increase in trunk fat mass was associated with an increase in TC.
We observed metabolic changes of limited clinical significance in the relatively young population enrolled in this study. However, the metabolic changes observed may have greater clinical significance in older people living with HIV or those with other concomitant cardiovascular risks.
In 2 double-blind phase 3 trials, 1733 antiretroviral-naive adults were randomized to tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), each coformulated with elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine (E/C/F). At 144 weeks, TAF was superior to TDF in virologic efficacy, with 84.2% vs 80.0% having HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL (difference 4.2%; 95% confidence interval: 0.6% to 7.8%). TAF had less impact than TDF on bone mineral density and renal biomarkers. No participants on TAF had renal-related discontinuations vs 12 on TDF (P &lt; 0.001), with no cases of proximal tubulopathy for TAF vs 4 for TDF. There were greater increases in lipids with TAF vs TDF, with no difference in the total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein ratio. For initial HIV therapy, E/C/F/TAF is superior to E/C/F/TDF in efficacy and bone and renal safety.
A novel dietary fiber (MsCDF) based core of maize straw (Core) was prepared by using high boiling solvent of sodium peroxide by high pressure pretreatment (HBSHP). The composition of MsCDF, and several physicochemical properties for MsCDF related to its nutritional quality were investigated. The results revealed that the MsCDF contains high contents total dietary fiber (TDF), soluble dietary fiber (SDF), insoluble dietary fiber (IDF) and two main monosaccharaides, xylose and glucose. Meanwhile, the studies of physicochemical properties of MsCDF indicated that MsCDF performed well water-holding capacity (WHC), oil-holding capacity (OHC), Swelling, solubility (SOL), Glucose dialysis retardation index (GDRI) and adsorption capacity on cholesterol. The results of this study serve as evidence that MsCDF can be used as a functional food additive, Core can be used as a crude material to produce MsCDF and the technology of HBSHP can be used to modify the physico-chemical properties of Core.
Antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens for HIV infection are frequently changed. We conducted a systematic review of randomized trials (RCTs) on the benefits and harms of switching to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)-based regimens in ART-experienced patients.
We included RCTs in HIV-infected adults comparing switching to a TDF-containing regimen with maintaining or switching to another regimen. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, LILACS, SCI, and the WHO Global Health Library. We assessed bias with the Cochrane tool and synthesized data using random-effects meta-analyses and Peto's approach. For further analyses, we added data from a previous systematic review in treatment-naïve patients.
17 RCTs with 2210 patients were included. All but one study had a high risk of bias. There was no significant association of switching to TDF-based regimens with mortality, fractures, CD4-cell count, body fat, virological failure, LDL-, and HDL-cholesterol. TDF-based regimens decreased total cholesterol (mean difference -12.05 mg/dL; 95% CI -20.76 to -3.34), trigylcerides (-14.33 mg/dL; -23.73 to -4.93), and bone mineral density (BMD; hip: -2.46%; -3.9 to -1.03; lumbar spine -1.52%; -2.69 to -0.34). Effects on estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) were inconsistent and depended on the measurement. Adding 22 RCTs from 8297 treatment-naïve patients gave consistent results with then significant reductions of LDL (-7.57 mg/dL; -10.37 to -4.78), HDL (-2.38 mg/dL; -3.83 to -0.93), and eGFR (-3.49 ml/min; -5.56 to -1.43).
Switching to TDF-based regimens is associated with reductions of BMD and lipid levels and possibly lowered kidney function. The evidence is limited by the high risk of bias.
Objective Recently, tenofovir disoproxil fumatate (TDF)-related side effects, such as renal nephrotoxicity and reduction of bone mineral density, have been reported. Consequently, increased switching from fixed-dose tablet TDF and emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) to abacavir and lamivudine (ABC/3TC) has occurred. Interestingly, while TDF has a lipid-lowering property, one of the ABC-related side effects is hyperlipidemia. Therefore, such switching could cause lipid elevation. To evaluate the change in lipid levels associated with switching from TDF/FTC to ABC/3TC in virologically-suppressed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Methods This is a retrospective, single-center study. We included the HIV-infected patients whose therapy included a drug switch from TDF/FTC to ABC/3TC between September 2009 and December 2012 at Ryukyu University Hospital. The exclusion criteria were HIV-RNA &gt;40 copies/mL on the switching day, and a documented therapy change to a lipid-lowering agent or any other antiretroviral agents within 3 months before or after switching. We compared the low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), total cholesterol (TC), and triglyceride (TG) levels before switching to three months after. Results A total of 18 patients met the inclusion criteria. The LDL, HDL, and TC levels significantly increased three months following the switch (p&lt;0.05), with median (interquartile range) values of 17 (7, 32), 6 (2, 13), and 27 (10, 45) mg/dL, respectively. The TG values did not markedly change. Conclusion Switching from TDF/FTC to ABC/3TC resulted in significantly increased LDL, HDL, and TC levels.
This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability and potential savings of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) simplification from an unboosted protease inhibitor (PI) regimen with atazanavir or fosamprenavir to a single-tablet regimen (STR) based on rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (RPV/FTC/TDF) among HIV-1-infected patients with HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL. This was a retrospective, multicentre, open-label, 12-week trial. Plasma HIV-1-RNA levels, CD4+ cell counts, cholesterol, triglycerides, bilirubin, glycaemia, creatinine and physical examination were performed at baseline and at scheduled follow-up. All patient costs were calculated and were estimated for 52 weeks of therapy. Fifty-one patients were enrolled [28 male (54.9%)]. At baseline, 30 patients (58.8%) were treated with FTC/TDF, 20 (39.2%) with abacavir/lamivudine and 1 (2.0%) with lamivudine/zidovudine. Thirty-three patients (64.7%) received atazanavir. All patients maintained HIV-RNA &lt;50 copies/mL; the median CD4+ cell count remained stable. Mean triglycerides decreased from 124 mg/dL (range, 39-625) at enrolment to 108.7 mg/dL (range, 39-561) at study end (P = 0.25). At baseline, mean cholesterol was 172.8 ± 38.1 mg/dL and decreased to 161.9 ± 38.6 mg/dL (P = 0.038); likewise, median total bilirubin decreased from 1.07 mg/dL (range, 0.2-4.7) to 0.6 mg/dL (range, 0.13-3.1) (P &lt;0.001). cART-related annual cost reduction with a STR was €3155.47 per patient (-24%). Non-cART patient management expenses were €402.68 vs. €299.10 for atazanavir or fosamprenavir and STR regimens, respectively. Switching to RPV/FTC/TDF from an unboosted PI in virologically suppressed HIV-infected patients is safe and is associated with a reduction in triglycerides, cholesterol and cART-related costs.
Renal toxicity due to tenofovir (TDF) has been largely described in patients with HIV infection. However, other antiretroviral drugs (such as atazanavir [ATV], especially when boosted by ritonavir, ATV/r) could perpetuate some degrees of renal impairment with or without TDF co-administration. Also, possible benefits of stopping TDF in patients without renal diseases is not well known. This study aimed at exploring evolution of renal function and lipid profile after switching from tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) to abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC), maintaining the ATV/r component of the regimen.
Patients in the Italian MASTER Cohort, who switched from TDF/FTC plus ATV/r to ABC/3TC plus ATV/r were included, provided that major renal diseases were not diagnosed before switching (i.e., baseline). Serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), total cholesterol, HDL and triglycerides were evaluated at baseline and at month 18 after switching.
126 patients were selected (80% males). Patients were mostly Italians (92%). 79% had undetectable HIV-RNA and 44% were co-infected by HBV and/or HCV. Median age at switch was 47 years (IQR 43-55). A small but significant decrease in serum creatinine [from 1.06 mg/dl (SD: 0.3) to 0.94 mg/dl (SD: 0.2); p&lt;0.001] with an improvement in eGFR [from 86.8 ml/min (SD: 33) to 96.4 ml/min (SD: 37); p&lt;0.001] were observed in per protocol analysis at month 18. Also ITT analysis showed a decrease in mean serum creatinine [from 1.08 mg/dl (SD: 0.35) to 0.95 mg/dl (SD: 0.24); p&lt;0.001] with an improvement in mean eGFR [from 86.9 ml/min/1.73m2 (SD: 24.11) to 95.8 ml/min/1.73m2 (SD: 19.99); p&lt;0.001]. Total cholesterol increased [from 188 mg/dl (SD: 42) to 206 mg/dl (SD: 44); p&lt;0.001] but also HDL increased as well [from 46 mg/dl (SD: 14) to 54 mg/dl (SD: 19); p=0.015]. An increase in triglycerides concentration was observed [from 162 mg/dl (SD: 144) to 214 mg/dl (SD: 109); p=0.027] in per protocol analysis. Also ITT analysis showed increases of both total cholesterol [from 187 mg/dl (SD: 43.69) to 203 mg/dl (SD: 44.10); p&lt;0.001] and HDL fraction [from 46 mg/dl (SD: 15.49) to 52 mg/dl (SD: 17.13); p=0.002] at month 18.
This analysis reports an improvement in eGFR and an increase in total cholesterol and HDL fraction at month 18 after switching to ABC/3TC plus ATV/r. Given the fact that renal function was not significantly affected at baseline, our findings may suggest the utility of a proactive switch from TDF to ABC, when otherwise indicated, in patients who cannot avoid using a nucleoside backbone.
Sex-determining region Y is a crucial gene that initiates male sex determination in mammals. Mutations of the Sp1-binding site in the 5' flanking region of SRY are associated with clinical male-to-female sex reversal syndrome, although such occurrences are rare and, until now, have not been reported in animal models. In this study, we mutated Sp1-binding sites in the 5' flanking region of the rabbit SRY gene using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. As expected, the SRY-Sp1 knockout rabbits had female external and internal genitalia and exhibited normal female copulatory behaviors, but they were infertile, and the adults displayed reduced follicles. Interestingly, we successfully obtained offspring from sex-reversed SRY-Sp1 knockout rabbits using embryo transfer. In summary, our study demonstrates that Sp1 is a major regulator in SRY gene transcription, and mutations of the Sp1 binding sites (Sp1-B and Sp1-C) in the 5' flanking region of SRY induce sex reversal in rabbits, which can be used as targets for clinical research of male-to-female sex reversal syndrome. Additionally, we provide the first evidence that sex reversal syndrome patients have the potential to become pregnant with the use of embryo transfer.
The African clawed frog Xenopus laevis has a female heterogametic ZZ/ZW-type sex-determining system. We previously discovered a W-linked female sex-determining gene dm-W that is involved in ovary formation, probably through the up-regulation of the estrogen synthesis genes cyp19a1 and foxl2. We also reported that a unique "mass-in-line structure", which disappears from ZZ gonads during early testicular development, might serve as the basis for ovary differentiation in ZW gonads. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying early masculinization are poorly understood. To elucidate the development of bipotential gonads into testes after sex determination in this species, we focused on the orthologs of five mammalian sex-related genes: three nuclear factor genes, dax1, sf1 (also known as ad4bp), and sox9, and two genes encoding members of the tumor growth factor-β (TGF-β) family, anti-Müllerian hormone (amh) and inhibin βb (inhbb). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that the expression of dax1, sox9, amh, and inhbb or sf1 was greatly or slightly higher in ZZ than in ZW gonads during early sex development. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that amh and inhbb mRNAs were expressed in somatic cells on the inner and outer sides of cell masses in the mass-in-line structure, respectively, in the developing ZZ gonads. Interestingly, estrogen exposure prevented the disappearance of the mass-in-line structure in early developing ZZ tadpoles. These findings suggest that TGF-β signaling is involved in the destruction of the mass-in-line structure, which may be maintained by estrogen.
The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of placental-specific markers, extracellular fetal DNA (sex-determining region Y and hypermethylated RASSF1A sequences) and circulating C19MC microRNAs (miR-516-5p, miR-517-5p, miR-518b, miR-520a-5p, miR-520h, miR-525, and miR-526a) for the diagnosis and consecutive follow-up of gestational trophoblastic disease/neoplasia. Increased levels of extracellular fetal DNA and C19MC microRNAs were detected in patients with active disease when compared with the period when the patients reached remission of the disease. The positive correlation between plasma levels of hypermethylated RASSF1A sequence, C19MC microRNAs, and human chorionic gonadotropin serum levels was found. MiR-520a-5p had the best performance to detect patients with active disease (a positive predictive value of 100% at a null false positive ratio (FPR)). MiR-516-5p and miR-525 were able to diagnose 100% of women with active disease at the FPR 3.9%/7.7%. The overall predictive capacity of single miR-526a (81.8% at null FPR), miR-517-5p (90.9% at 15.4% FPR), miR-518b (100% at 38.5% FPR), and miR-520h (90.9% at 26.9% FPR) biomarkers to detect active disease cases was slightly lower. Transient increase in C19MC microRNA plasma levels after the first cycle of chemotherapy indicated the decay of placental trophoblast residual tissue. The increased levels of extracellular fetal DNA and placental-specific C19MC microRNAs are associated with gestational trophoblastic disease/neoplasia. Screening of extracellular placental-specific biomarkers may represent an additional option to identify a significant proportion of women with active disease and to monitor the therapy response. Non-invasive follow-up of the decomposing residual tissue in the form of extracellular nucleic acids of placental origin packed into apoptotic bodies derived from placental trophoblasts is available.
In human, SRY (sex-determining region of the Y chromosome) is the major gene for the testis-determining factor which is found in normal XY males and in the rare XX males, and it is absent in normal XX females and many XY females. There are several methods which can indicate a male genotype by the presence of the amplified product of SRY gene. The aim of this study was to identify the SRY gene for embryo sex determination in human during pregnancy using loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method.
A total of 15 blood samples from pregnant women at eight weeks of pregnancy were collected, and Plasma DNA was extracted. LAMP assay was performed using DNA obtained for detection of SRY gene. Furthermore, colorimetric LAMP assay for rapid and easy detection of SRY gene was developed.
LAMP results revealed that the positive reaction was highly specific only with samples containing XY chromosomes, while no amplification was found in samples containing XX chromosomes. A total of 15 blood samples from pregnant women were seven male embryos (46.6%) and eight female embryos (53.4%). All used visual components in the colorimetric assay could successfully make a clear distinction between positive and negative ones.
The LAMP assay developed in this study is a valuable tool capable of monitoring the purity and detection of SRY gene for sex determination.
In this work, we present for the first time, the use of a simple fractal capacitive biosensor for the quantification and detection of sex-determining region Y (SRY) genes. This section of genetic code, which is found on the Y chromosome, finds importance for study as it causes fetuses to develop characteristics of male sex-like gonads when a mutation occurs. It is also an important genetic code in men, and disorders involving the SRY gene can cause infertility and sexual malfunction that lead to a variety of gene mutational disorders. We have therefore designed silicon-based, label-free fractal capacitive biosensors to quantify various proteins and genes. We take advantage of a good dielectric material, Parylene C for enhancing the performance of the sensors. We have integrated these sensors with a simple microchannel for easy handling of fluids on the detection area. The read-out value of an Agilent LCR meter used to measure capacitance of the sensor at a frequency of 1 MHz determined gene specificity and gene quantification. These data revealed that the capacitance measurement of the capacitive biosensor for the SRY gene depended on both the target and the concentration of DNA. The experimental outcomes in the present study can be used to detect DNA and its variations in crucial fields that have a great impact on our daily lives, such as clinical and veterinary diagnostics, industrial and environmental testing and forensic sciences.
In the zebrafish, no sex-determining gene has been identified, while some sex-related genes, such as cyp19a1a and amh, show sexually dimorphic expression. Interestingly, most of these genes are expressed in the somatic cells. With increasing evidence suggesting roles of germ cells in gonadal differentiation, there is an increasing interest in the factors released by the germ cells for the bidirectional communication between the two compartments. We have reported that Gdf9/gdf9 is an oocyte-specific factor in the zebrafish, similar to that of mammals. Whether and how Gdf9 is involved in gonadal differentiation is unknown. In this study, we compared the expression levels of gdf9, cyp19a1a, and amh among several other sex-related genes in the gonads before, during, and after sex differentiation. The expression of gdf9 started in the gonads before sex differentiation, and its level surged in the differentiated ovary. Its expression pattern was similar to that of cyp19a1a, but reciprocal to amh expression. Using recombinant zebrafish Gdf9 (rzfGdf9), we further showed that Gdf9 significantly suppressed the expression of amh while increased that of activin beta subunits (inhbaa and inhbb) in vitro. Although gdf9 and cyp19a1a showed co-expression during gonadal differentiation, we only observed a slight but not significant response of cyp19a1a to rzfGdf9. Knocking down the expression of gdf9 and cyp19a1a with vivo-morpholinos caused a male-skewed sex ratio. Our data suggested that Gdf9 is likely involved in promoting oocyte/ovary differentiation in the zebrafish and it may act by suppressing amh expression, at least partly, in the somatic cells.
In most eutherian mammals, sex determination is governed by the Y-linked gene Sry, but in African pygmy mice Mus minutoides, Sry action is overridden by a variant X chromosome (X*), yielding X*Y females. We hypothesized that X*Y sex reversal may be underpinned not only by neomorphic X chromosome functionality, but also by a compromised Sry pathway. Here, we show that neither M. minutoides SRY nor its target, the Sox9-TESCO enhancer, had appreciable transcriptional activity in in vitro assays, correlating with sequence degradation compared to Mus musculus counterparts. However, M. minutoides SRY activated its cognate TESCO to a moderate degree, and can clearly engage the male pathway in M. minutoides in the wild, indicating that SRY and TESCO may have co-evolved in M. minutoides to retain function above a threshold level. We suggest that weakening of the SRY/TESCO nexus may have facilitated the rise and spread of a variant X* chromosome carrying female-inducing modifier gene(s).
SRY, a sex-determining gene, induces testis development in chromosomally female (XX) individuals. However, mouse XX Sertoli cells carrying Sry (XX/Sry Sertoli cells) are incapable of fully supporting germ cell development, even when the karyotype of the germ cells is XY. While it has therefore been assumed that XX/Sry Sertoli cells are not functionally equivalent to XY Sertoli cells, it has remained unclear which specific functions are affected. To elucidate the functional difference, we compared the gene expression of XY and XX/Sry Sertoli cells. Lactate and cholesterol metabolisms, essential for nursing the developing germ cells, were down-regulated in XX/Sry cells, which appears to be caused at least in part by the differential expression of histone modification enzymes SMCX/SMCY (H3K4me3 demethylase) and UTX/UTY (H3K27me3 demethylase) encoded by the sex chromosomes. We suggest that down-regulation of lactate and cholesterol metabolism that may be due to altered epigenetic modification affects the nursing functions of XX/Sry Sertoli cells.
The SRY gene is present within the sex-determining region of the Y chromosome which is responsible for maleness in mammals. The nonuniform usage of synonymous codons in the mRNA transcript for encoding a particular amino acid is the codon usage bias (CUB). Analysis of codon usage pattern is important to understand the genetic and molecular organisation of a gene. It also helps in heterologous gene expression, design of primer and synthetic gene. However, the analysis of codon usage bias of SRY gene was not yet studied. We have used bioinformatic tools to analyse codon usage bias of SRY gene across mammals. Codon bias index (CBI) indicated that the overall extent of codon usage bias was weak. The relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis suggested that most frequently used codons had an A or C at the third codon position. Compositional constraint played an important role in codon usage pattern as evident from correspondence analysis (CA). Significant correlation among nucleotides constraints indicated that both mutation pressure and natural selection affect the codon usage pattern. Neutrality plot suggested that natural selection might play a major role, while mutation pressure might play a minor role in codon usage pattern in SRY gene in different species of mammals.
The group C SOX transcription factors SOX4, -11 and -12 play important and mutually overlapping roles in development of a number of organs. Here, we examined the role of SoxC genes during gonadal development in mice. All three genes were expressed in developing gonads of both sexes, predominantly in somatic cells, with Sox4 being most strongly expressed. Sox4 deficiency resulted in elongation of both ovaries and testes, and an increased number of testis cords. While female germ cells entered meiosis normally, male germ cells showed reduced levels of differentiation markers Nanos2 and Dnmt3l and increased levels of pluripotency genes Cripto and Nanog, suggesting that SOX4 may normally act to restrict the pluripotency period of male germ cells and ensure their proper differentiation. Finally, our data reveal that SOX4 (and, to a lesser extent, SOX11 and -12) repressed transcription of the sex-determining gene Sox9 via an upstream testis-specific enhancer core (TESCO) element in fetal gonads, raising the possibility that SOXC proteins may function as transcriptional repressors in a context-dependent manner.
DNA methylation is a major epigenetic modification, playing a crucial role in the development and differentiation of higher organisms. DNA methylation is also known to regulate transcription by gene repression. Various developmental genes such as c-mos, HoxB5, Sox11, and Sry show tissue-specific gene expression that was shown to be regulated by promoter DNA methylation. The aim of the present study is to investigate the establishment of chromatin marks (active or repressive) in relation to heterogeneous methylation in the promoter regions of these developmentally important genes.
Chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed to immuno-precipitate chromatin by antibodies against both active (H3K4me3) and repressive (H3K9me3) chromatin regions. The analysis of ChIP results showed that both the percentage input and fold enrichment of activated chromatin was higher in tissues expressing the respective genes as compared to the tissues not expressing the same set of genes. This was true for all the genes selected for the study (c-mos, HoxB5, Sox11, and Sry). These findings illustrate that inconsistent DNA methylation patterns (sporadic, mosaic and heterogeneous) may also influence gene regulation, thereby resulting in the modulation of chromatin conformation.
These findings illustrate that various patterns of DNA methylation (asynchronous, mosaic and heterogeneous) correlates with chromatin modification, resulting in the gene regulation.
Sex determination is important in archeology and anthropology for the study of past societies, cultures, and human activities. Sex determination is also one of the most important components of individual identification in criminal investigations. We developed a new method of sex determination by detecting a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the amelogenin gene using amplified product-length polymorphisms in combination with sex-determining region Y analysis. We particularly focused on the most common types of postmortem DNA damage in ancient and forensic samples: fragmentation and nucleotide modification resulting from deamination. Amplicon size was designed to be less than 60 bp to make the method more useful for analyzing degraded DNA samples. All DNA samples collected from eight Japanese individuals (four male, four female) were evaluated correctly using our method. The detection limit for accurate sex determination was determined to be 20 pg of DNA. We compared our new method with commercial short tandem repeat analysis kits using DNA samples artificially fragmented by ultraviolet irradiation. Our novel method was the most robust for highly fragmented DNA samples. To deal with allelic dropout resulting from deamination, we adopted "bidirectional analysis," which analyzed samples from both sense and antisense strands. This new method was applied to 14 Jomon individuals (3500-year-old bone samples) whose sex had been identified morphologically. We could correctly identify the sex of 11 out of 14 individuals. These results show that our method is reliable for the sex determination of highly degenerated samples.
Steroidogenic factor 1 (NR5A1, SF-1, Ad4BP) is a transcriptional regulator of genes involved in adrenal and gonadal development and function. Mutations in NR5A1 have been among the most frequently identified genetic causes of gonadal development disorders and are associated with a wide phenotypic spectrum. In 46,XY individuals, NR5A1-related phenotypes may range from disorders of sex development (DSD) to oligo/azoospermia, and in 46,XX individuals, from 46,XX ovotesticular and testicular DSD to primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). The most common 46,XY phenotype is atypical or female external genitalia with clitoromegaly, palpable gonads, and absence of Müllerian derivatives. Notably, an undervirilized external genitalia is frequently seen at birth, while spontaneous virilization may occur later, at puberty. In 46,XX individuals, NR5A1 mutations are a rare genetic cause of POI, manifesting as primary or secondary amenorrhea, infertility, hypoestrogenism, and elevated gonadotropin levels. Mothers and sisters of 46,XY DSD patients carrying heterozygous NR5A1 mutations may develop POI, and therefore require appropriate counseling. Moreover, the recurrent heterozygous p.Arg92Trp NR5A1 mutation is associated with variable degrees of testis development in 46,XX patients. A clear genotype-phenotype correlation is not seen in patients bearing NR5A1 mutations, suggesting that genetic modifiers, such as pathogenic variants in other testis/ovarian-determining genes, may contribute to the phenotypic expression. Here, we review the published literature on NR5A1-related disease, and discuss our findings at a single tertiary center in Brazil, including ten novel NR5A1 mutations identified in 46,XY DSD patients. The ever-expanding phenotypic range associated with NR5A1 variants in XY and XX individuals confirms its pivotal role in reproductive biology, and should alert clinicians to the possibility of NR5A1 defects in a variety of phenotypes presenting with gonadal dysfunction.

SRY-mutation-caused sex reversal is a rare disease and mostly associated with a de novo mutation since the patients with defective SRY is infertile. There are many reports about SRY-mutation associated 46, XY ovarian disorder of sex development (DSD), but few described their molecular mechanism. Here we report a de novo mutation 224G&gt;T (R75M) in SRY associated with a phenotypic female, 46, XY karyotype and dysgerminoma. The wild and mutated SRY were cloned into recombinant plasmid and expressed in cells in vitro, the result showed the mutated SRY is greatly accumulated in cytoplasm while the wild type SRY is mostly localized in nucleus. To make sure no other genes were involved, we performed the trio-based whole exome sequencing using the DNA samples from the proband and the parents, and no mutations were identified especially in DHH, NR0B1, NR5A1, SOX9 and MAP3K1, indicating the de novo mutation in SRY is the single defect responsible for the female sex reversal. We also used bioinformatics simulation analysis to predict impact of the mutation on SRY function, and find the R75 in wild type SRY can form a hydrogen bond with serine at 91 (S91) that make the SRY protein well fit into the minor groove of target DNA, while the M75 in the mutated SRY can't. Finally, we reviewed SRY mutations based on the available references and analyzed the mutation distribution patterns according to density and continuity, which may be useful for further study of the SRY structure, function, and its relatedness with DSD.
In this study, we examined the doses of the stature homeobox (SHOX), vesicle-associated membrane protein 7 (VAMP7), and SRY genes to establish a protocol for using peripheral blood samples deposited on filter paper for the screening of sex chromosome aneuploidy in neonates. We also measured correlations with karyotypes to assess this method as a neonatal screening strategy.
This was an observational, descriptive, comparative blind study. Thirty-two healthy young adults (17 women, 15 men; age, ≥18 years), four patients with known sex chromosome aneuploidy (positive control group), and 1000 healthy newborns were included. Gene dosages were determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Values with standard deviations (SDs) of three or more were considered abnormal.
Men and women differed in the gene dosage of the SRY gene. Cases with Turner syndrome showed values below 3 SDs for SHOX and VAMP7 genes, and cases with Klinefelter syndrome showed values above 3 SDs for SHOX and VAMP7 genes. Two suspected cases of sex chromosome aneuploidy were diagnosed using our neonatal screening strategy; these cases were confirmed as Turner syndrome and 47,XYY syndrome by karyotyping.
Our data establish a basis for the determination of chromosomal sex and neonatal screening of sex chromosome aneuploidy using RT-PCR.
