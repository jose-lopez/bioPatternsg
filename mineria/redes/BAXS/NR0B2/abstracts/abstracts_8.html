The use of antioxidant molecules in the QUIN model reduces cellular damage through the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related to factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway. The Nrf2 transcription factor is considered the master regulator of antioxidant genes expression, and its activation occurs by an increase in the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels or in the presence of electrophilic compounds. However, Nrf2 activation also occurs in an oxidative stress-independent process caused by the disruption of the Keap1-Nrf2 complex by the direct interaction of Keap1 with certain proteins, such as DPP3 and p62. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of QUIN on Nrf2 activation over short periods of time. QUIN administration increased Nrf2 activation at 30 min in the striatum without increasing ROS production or modifying the redox cellular state. Moreover, QUIN increased Keap1 and Nrf2 nuclear levels and increased the protein-protein interaction between Keap1 and DPP3 and Keap1 and p62 30 min after QUIN administration. Finally, we found that Nrf2 activation primarily occurs in striatal neurons. Our results show that QUIN administration in vivo stimulates Nrf2 expression and activation in the absence of oxidative stress primarily in neurons and increases the interaction of p62 and DPP3 with Keap1, which could participate in Nrf2 activation.
Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type IV is caused by a heterozygous mutation, Glu325Lys (E325K), in the KLF1 transcription factor. A molecular understanding of this disease is absent, partly due to its rarity. We expanded erythroid cells from a patient's peripheral blood and analyzed its global expression pattern. We find that a large number of erythroid pathways are disrupted, particularly those related to membrane transport, globin regulation, and iron utilization. The altered genetics lead to significant deficits in differentiation. Glu325 is within the KLF1 zinc finger domain at an amino acid critical for site specific DNA binding. The change to Lys is predicted to significantly alter the target site recognition sequence, both by subverting normal recognition and by enabling interaction with novel sites. Consistent with this, we find high level ectopic expression of genes not normally present in the red cell. These altered properties explain the patients' clinical and phenotypic features and elucidate the dominant character of the mutation.
We have identified regulatory mechanisms in which an RNA transcript forms a DNA duplex·RNA triple helix with a gene or one of its regulatory elements, suggesting potential auto-regulatory mechanisms in vivo. We describe an interaction at the human β-globin locus, in which an RNA segment embedded in the second intron of the β-globin gene forms a DNA·RNA triplex with the HS2 sequence within the β-globin locus control region, a major regulator of globin expression. We show in human K562 cells that the triplex is stable in vivo. Its formation causes displacement from HS2 of major transcription factors and RNA Polymerase II, and consequently in loss of factors and polymerase that bind to the human ε- and γ-globin promoters, which are activated by HS2 in K562 cells. This results in reduced expression of these genes. These effects are observed when a small length of triplex-forming RNA is introduced into cells, or when a full-length intron-containing human β-globin transcript is expressed. Related results are obtained in human umbilical cord blood-derived erythroid progenitor-2 cells, in which β-globin expression is similarly affected by triplex formation. These results suggest a model in which RNAs conforming to the strict sequence rules for DNA·RNA triplex formation may participate in feedback regulation of genes in cis.
Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) are the recommended treatment for many solid tumors; however, resistance is a major clinical obstacle for their efficacy. High levels of the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2 like-2 (Nrf2) in cancer cells suggest a vital role in chemoresistance, and regulation of autophagy is one mechanism by which Nrf2 mediates chemoresistance. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying this activity are unclear, understanding them may ultimately improve therapeutic outcomes following HDACi treatment. In this study, we found that HDACi treatment increased Nrf2 mRNA and protein levels and enhanced Nrf2 transcriptional activity. Conversely, Nrf2 knockdown or inhibition blocked HDACi-induced autophagy. In addition, a microRNA (miRNA) array identified upregulation of miR-129-3p in response to Nrf2 overexpression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed miR-129-3p to be a direct Nrf2 target. RepTar and RNAhybrid databases indicated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) as a potential miR-129-3p target, which we experimentally confirmed. Finally, Nrf2 inhibition or miR-129-3p in combination with HDACis increased cell death in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, these results demonstrated that Nrf2 regulates mTOR during HDACi-induced autophagy through miRNA-129-3p and inhibition of this pathway could enhance HDACi-mediated cell death.
Water extract of Hydrangea paniculata (HP) stem, rich in coumarin glycosides, has been demonstrated to have renal protective effect in several experimental kidney injury animal models. Currently, it is under pre-clinical development as a class 5 herbal drug against membranous nephropathy. However, whether it also benefits diabetic nephropathy (DN) is not clear.
This study was performed to investigate the protective effect of HP on streptozotocin-induced experimental DN, and further understand its molecular mechanisms.
In the present study, type 1 diabetes rat model was established by the intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. HP was orally administered every day for three months. Biochemical analysis and histopathological staining were conducted to evaluate the renal functions. In vivo pharmacokinetic study was conducted to analyse the metabolites of HP with high blood drug concentration. In vitro assay using these metabolites was performed to analyse their ability to reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production induced under high glucose (HG) condition by flow cytometry. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was conducted to analyse the mRNA level of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) and IL6 and western blot was performed to analyse the phosphorylation status of smad 2/3 in HK2 cells under TGFβ1 stimulation.
The treatment with HP significantly reduced the blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine content, and urine albumin excretion in diabetic rats, and increased the creatinine clearance rate. Periodic acid-schiff and methenamine staining and immunohistochemistry revealed that HP also ameliorated glomerulosclerosis and tubular vacuolar degeneration, as well as the deposition of fibronectin and collagen IV in the glomeruli. Pharmacokinetic study results revealed that the major coumarin compounds from HP were metabolised into umbelliferone and esculetin. By in vitro assay, umbelliferone and esculetin were found to significantly decrease ROS production induced by HG content, as well as increase the mRNA level of Nrf2. HP and its metabolites also can down-regulate fibronectin secretion in HK2 cells stimulated by TGFβ1 and inhibit smad2/3 phosphorylation.
HP has beneficial effect on DN by increasing Nrf2 expression and inhibiting TGF-smad signal activation. Further, it can be a novel herbal drug against DN.
PU.1 is an ETS-family transcription factor that plays a broad range of roles in hematopoiesis. A direct regulator of myeloid, dendritic-cell, and B cell functional programs, and a well-known antagonist of terminal erythroid cell differentiation, it is also expressed in the earliest stages of T-cell development of each cohort of intrathymic pro-T cells. Its expression in this context appears to give T-cell precursors initial, transient access to myeloid and dendritic cell developmental competence and therefore to represent a source of antagonism or delay of T-cell lineage commitment. However, it has remained uncertain until recently why T-cell development is also intensely dependent upon PU.1. Here, we review recent work that sheds light on the molecular biology of PU.1 action across the genome in pro-T cells and identifies the genes that depend on PU.1 for their correct regulation. This work indicates modes of chromatin engagement, pioneering, and cofactor recruitment ("coregulator theft") by PU.1 as well as gene network interactions that not only affect specific target genes but also have system-wide regulatory consequences, amplifying the impact of PU.1 beyond its own direct binding targets. The genes directly regulated by PU.1 also suggest a far-reaching transformation of cell biology and signaling potential between the early stages of T-cell development when PU.1 is expressed and when it is silenced. These cell-biological functions can be important to distinguish fetal from adult T-cell development and have the potential to illuminate aspects of thymic function that have so far remained the most mysterious.
Sirtuins (SIRTs) are NAD+-dependent deacylases that play a key role in transcription, DNA repair, metabolism, and oxidative stress resistance. Increasing NAD+ availability regulates endogenous SIRT activity, leading to increased resistance to oxidative stress and decreased mitochondrial reactive oxygen production in multiple cell types and disease models. This protection, at least in part, depends on the activation of antioxidant mitochondrial proteins. We now show that increasing total NAD+ content in astrocytes leads to the activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor, erythroid-derived 2, like 2 (Nfe2l2 or Nrf2) and up-regulation of the antioxidant proteins heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and sulfiredoxin 1 (SRXN1). Nrf2 activation also occurs as a result of SIRT6 overexpression. Mutations in Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) cause familial forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Astrocytes isolated from mutant human SOD1-overexpressing mice induce motor neuron death in coculture. Treatment with nicotinamide mononucleotide or nicotinamide riboside increases total NAD+ content in ALS astrocytes and abrogates their toxicity toward cocultured motor neurons. The observed neuroprotection depends on SIRT6 expression in astrocytes. Moreover, overexpression of SIRT6 in astrocytes by itself abrogates the neurotoxic phenotype of ALS astrocytes. Our results identify SIRT6 as a potential therapeutic target to prevent astrocyte-mediated motor neuron death in ALS.-Harlan, B. A., Pehar, M., Killoy, K. M., Vargas, M. R. Enhanced SIRT6 activity abrogates the neurotoxic phenotype of astrocytes expressing ALS-linked mutant SOD1.
SOX6 is a HMG-box transcription factor expressed in a wide range of tissues. Recent data show that SOX6 expression is altered in different cancers, in the majority of cases being downregulated. To date, no data are available about SOX6 role in hematological malignancies. Here we demonstrate that SOX6 overexpressing BCR-ABL1+ B-ALL cells are unable to promote leukemia in a mouse model. Starting from this observation, we extended our study to a panel of human leukemic cells carrying genetic lesions distinctive of different types of leukemias and myeloproliferative disorders (the BCR-ABL1 translocation and the JAK2V617F amino acid substitution) to dissect the cellular events induced by SOX6. The inhibition of proliferation is the invariant outcome of SOX6 overexpression but it is achieved via two different cellular responses: terminal differentiation in erythroid-biased cells, irrespectively of their mutation, and apoptosis in megakaryocytic-primed and lymphoid cells. Within this context, cells carrying the highest copy number of the JAK2V617F allele better counteract the SOX6-imposed growth arrest. The interrogation of the GEPIA (Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis) human dataset reveals that SOX6 is downregulated in a cohort of AML patients, uncovering a wide anti-proliferative role of SOX6 in a variety of mutant backgrounds.
The major signaling pathway in human cells is related to the antioxidant defense system. The main component of this system is a transcription factor, Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-Related Factor 2 (NRF2). It regulates this system in different cellular situations under stimulation by oxidative stress or antioxidants. Thus, detecting the stimulation of NRF2 via a screening strategy may enable us to discover stimulating agents of NRF2-related signaling pathway. With this in mind, we designed a whole cell bioreporter containing the NRF2 response elements that are inserted in a luciferase vector, immediately upstream of a luciferase gene whose promoter has been removed. This bioreporter is activated by stimulators such as 3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione (D3T), butyl hydroxyanisole (BHA) and ascorbic acid reacting as antioxidant agents. It was observed that the regulatory region of the NRF2 gene, which is identified by NRF2 protein, is located inside its coding region. This designed bioreporter can detect the presence of antioxidant agents. It also exhibits a significant linear correlation over different doses of these agents ranging from 0.8 to 80 μM for ascorbic acid, 0.1 to 100 μM for D3T, and 0.1 to 100 μM for BHA. This detection system is proven to be more sensitive than Real-time PCR, suggesting it to be a highly sensitive system among the available methods.
Lifestyle and genetic factors contribute to the initiation of oxidative stress and inflammation in diabetes mellitus (DM). Oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation worked in an orchestrated manner and reported to be strongly associated with the formation of the hyperlipidemic condition in DM patients. Isoquercetin, a bioactive constituent isolated from guava leaves has attracted considerable attention because of its antidiabetic activity. The antidiabetic activity of guava leaves may be due to the presence of isoquercetin at a significant level. However, how isoquercetin regulates different pathways in DM is insufficiently studied. We have selected versatile regulators of oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways to fully analyze if isoquercetin effectively modulated the genes of these pathways. At the end of our experimental duration, rats were dissected and analyzed for the oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, inflammatory and lipid markers. The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway is believed to be the key regulator of expression of various antioxidant enzyme genes and it is directly or indirectly related to nuclear factor Kappa- B (NF-kB) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathways. Therefore, we tend to study the effects of STZ on Nrf2, NF-kB and AMPK pathway and how the isoquercetin treatment performs at a molecular level to overcome the burden of DM. The results of our study provided convincing evidence of significant pharmacological properties of isoquercetin in context of its ability to inhibit the oxidative stress elicited by the STZ through generation of the free radicals and regulation of the expression of Nrf2 pathway-associated proteins and genes and it also reduced the burden of hyperlipidemia and inflammation. By taking the above results into consideration isoquercetin can be studied further to elucidate its antidiabetic effects at various levels.
Gastric cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide and is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. Although significant progress has been made in the diagnosis and treatment for the cancer, less improvement has been made in overall survival rate. Thus, there is an urgent need for a better understanding of the biological aspects of the cancer. The transcription factor transcription factor 7-like 1 (TCF7L1) is an embryonic stem cell signature gene that is upregulated in multiple aggressive cancer types, but its role in gastric cancer has seldom been discussed. In the present study, by using the Cancer Genome Atlas dataset analysis, we demonstrated that patients with higher expression of TCF7L1 could be used to reflect prognosis. An examination of the mechanisms demonstrated that TCF7L1 could positively regulate antioxidant response in gastric cancer cells by positively regulating Keap1/NRF2 [Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2] pathway. Collectively, our data demonstrated that TCF7L1 is a novel marker for predicting overall survival of gastric cancer and provided the possible underlying molecular mechanism.
Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) is a major regulator of the oxidative stress response and it is negatively regulated by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). The Keap1-Nrf2 axis has a fundamental role in carcinogenesis. In previous studies, the widely used diabetes drug metformin has appeared to have a critical role in the regulation of Nrf2 function. In this study, we assessed the expression of Nrf2 and Keap1 immunohistochemically in 157 patients with type 2 diabetes who underwent breast cancer surgery with curative intent. In total, 78 (49.7%) of these patients were taking metformin alone or combined with other oral anti-diabetic medication at the time of breast cancer diagnosis. We found that high-level cytoplasmic Nrf2 expression predicted dismal overall survival and breast cancer-specific survival, but only in the patients who were not taking metformin at the time of diagnosis. Similarly, low-level nuclear Keap1 expression had an adverse prognostic value in terms of overall survival and breast cancer-specific survival in patients without metformin. On the other hand, high-level nuclear Keap1 expression was associated with prolonged overall survival and breast cancer-specific survival. The results may be explained in terms of non-functioning or displaced Keap1, although more mechanistic pre-clinical and prospective clinical studies are warranted.
In previous studies, Gentianella acuta (Michx.) Hulten was reported to contain xanthones, iridoids, terpenoids, and sterols and is mainly used to cure hepatitis, jaundice, fever, headache, and angina pectoris. In this study, we used bioassay guided fractionation to identify compounds from G. acuta and investigated their activity against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced apoptosis of H9c2 cells using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method. The levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic (GCLC) expression were assessed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Protein expression was evaluated using western blot. The results showed that all four compounds had protective effects on H9c2 cells. The transcription levels of HO-1 and GCLC significantly increased in H9c2 cells pretreated with norswertianolin (1), swetrianolin (2), demethylbellidifolin (3), and bellidifolin (4). However, compared to the model group, the transcription levels of Nrf2 were not enhanced by pretreatment with compounds 1, 2, and 4. The protein expression levels of HO-1 and GCLC in H9c2 cells were greater than that in the H2O2-treated group, and the expression of Nrf2 was not significantly changed except by swetrianolin treatment; inhibitors can reverse the protective effect by ZnPP (15 μM), BSO (10 μM), and brusatol (10 μM). The results indicated that the four compounds isolated from G. acuta inhibited the oxidative injury induced by H2O2 by activating the Nrf2/ARE pathway in H9c2 cells and provide evidence that G. acuta may be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
Autism is a neurodevelopmental disease which is characterized by its core behavioral symptoms such as impairment in social interaction and stereotyped repetitive behavior. Th17 immune responses and oxidative stress are reported to be elevated in both human autistic subjects and BTBR T + Itpr3tf/J (BTBR) mice. On the other hand, activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor (Nrf2), a master transcription factor is essential for the management of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant genes. Sulforaphane activates Nrf2 and thus is considered a potential approach to treat several neurological disorders including autism. In the current work, we used sulforaphane in asocial BTBR mice and its social counterpart C57/BL6 (C57) mice to assess its therapeutic potential and molecular mechanisms (Th17 immune responses, and oxidant-antioxidant balance) through which it acts. Our results demonstrate that BTBR treated with sulforaphane had reduced self-grooming/marble burying behavior, and increased social interaction in three chambered sociability test as compared to untreated BTBR mice. Further, sulforaphane-treated BTBR mice had reduced Th17 immune responses (STAT3, RORC, IL-17 A and IL-23R expression in CD4 + T cells), oxidative stress parameters in neutrophils/cerebellum (NFkB, iNOS, and lipid peroxides). Furthermore, sulforaphane-treated BTBR and C57 mice had upregulated enzymatic antioxidant defenses in neutrophils/cerebellum (SOD, GPx and GR expression and activity). We reason that activation of Nrf2 by sulforaphane corrected Th17 immune dysfunction and oxidant-antioxidant imbalance in periphery and brain in BTBR mice. These mechanisms lead to improvement in autism-like symptoms in BTBR mice.
Inflammation and oxidative stress are considered major factors in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that Schizandrin A (Sch A), a lignin compound isolated from Schisandra chinesnesis, exhibits prominent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of Sch A against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms. Sch A treatment significantly improved the neurological score and reduced infarct volume 24 h after reperfusion. It dose-dependently inhibited the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase, reduced the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α interleukin [IL]-1β and IL-6), and increased anti-inflammatory cytokines (transforming growth factor-β and interleukin-10). Furthermore, it increased the activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase, decreased reactive oxygen species production and 4-hydroxynonenal and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine levels. Transcription of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and downstream genes (heme oxygenase-1 and NAD[P]H: quinone oxidoreductase 1) increased. Knockdown of Nrf2 by siRNA inhibited the neuroprotective effects of Sch A. In addition, Sch A increased phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) both in vivo and in vitro. Activation of the Nrf2 pathway as well as the protective effects of Sch A in an oxygen and glucose deprivation-induced injury model was abolished by AMPK knockdown. Our study indicates that Sch A protects against cerebral I/R injury by suppressing inflammation and oxidative stress, and that this effect is regulated by the AMPK/Nrf2 pathway.
Red blood cells mature within the erythroblastic island (EI) niche that consists of specialized macrophages surrounded by differentiating erythroblasts. Here we establish an in vitro system to model the human EI niche using macrophages that are derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and are also genetically programmed to an EI-like phenotype by inducible activation of the transcription factor, KLF1. These EI-like macrophages increase the production of mature, enucleated erythroid cells from umbilical cord blood derived CD34+ haematopoietic progenitor cells and iPSCs; this enhanced production is partially retained even when the contact between progenitor cells and macrophages is inhibited, suggesting that KLF1-induced secreted proteins may be involved in this enhancement. Lastly, we find that the addition of three secreted factors, ANGPTL7, IL-33 and SERPINB2, significantly enhances the production of mature enucleated red blood cells. Our study thus contributes to the ultimate goal of replacing blood transfusion with a manufactured product.
We investigated the role of stattic as an adjuvant molecule to increase the cytotoxicity of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) through specific inhibition of molecular targets, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in HT-29 colon cancer cells. Cytotoxicity and apoptotic effects were investigated by methylthiazolyldiphenyl-​tetrazolium bromide assay and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was applied to assess the messenger RNA (mRNA) level of STAT3, Nrf2, and apoptotic genes including Bax, Bcl-xl, and Bcl-2. The antitumor effect of 5-FU in combination with stattic induced synergistic effect in HT-29 cells with combination indexes (CIs) 0.49. Flow cytometric results related to apoptotic confirmed that there was up to 40% increase in the population of apoptotic cells in HT-29 colon cancer cells incubated with 5-FU and stattic compared with control groups. Our data from gene expression determined a substantial diminish in the mRNA levels of the Nrf2 and antiapoptotic gene Bcl-2 along with a noticeable increase in the level of the proapoptotic Bax in HT-29 colon cells that underwent cotreatment with 5-FU and stattic (P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, the results exhibited that stattic can be used as adjuvant chemotherapy besides the 5-FU. This therapeutic approach in colon cancer could mediate 5-FU chemoresistance via modulating therapeutic targets (ie, STAT3 and Nrf2 pathways) and decreased 5-FU-related adverse effects.
Luteolin, a dietary flavone, modulates various signaling pathways involved in carcinogenesis. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism that underlies the apoptotic effects of luteolin mediated by DNA demethylation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) promoter and the interaction of Nrf2 and p53, a tumor suppressor, in human colon cancer cells. Luteolin increased the expression of apoptosis-related proteins and antioxidant enzymes. In DNA methylation, luteolin inhibited the expression of DNA methyltransferases, a transcription repressor, and increased the expression and activity of ten-eleven translocation (TET) DNA demethylases, a transcription activator. Methyl-specific polymerase chain reaction and bisulfite genomic sequencing indicated that luteolin decreased the methylation of the Nrf2 promoter region, which corresponded to the increased mRNA expression of Nrf2. In addition, luteolin increased TET1 binding to the Nrf2 promoter, as determined using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. TET1 knockdown decreased the percentages of luteolin-treated cells in sub-G1 phase and cells with fragmented nuclei. Furthermore, complex formation between p53 and Nrf2 was involved in the apoptotic effects of luteolin. These results provide insight into the mechanism that underlies the anticancer effects of luteolin on colon cancer, which involve the upregulation of Nrf2 and its interaction with the tumor suppressor.
A robust scalable method for producing enucleated red blood cells (RBCs) is not only a process to produce packed RBC units for transfusion but a potential platform to produce modified RBCs with applications in advanced cellular therapy. Current strategies for producing RBCs have shortcomings in the limited self-renewal capacity of progenitor cells, or difficulties in effectively enucleating erythroid cell lines. We explored a new method to produce RBCs by inducibly expressing c-Myc in primary erythroid progenitor cells and evaluated the proliferative and maturation potential of these modified cells.
Primary erythroid progenitor cells were genetically modified with an inducible gene transfer vector expressing a single transcription factor, c-Myc, and all the gene elements required to achieve dox-inducible expression. Genetically modified cells had enhanced proliferative potential compared to control cells, resulting in exponential growth for at least 6 weeks. Inducibly proliferating erythroid (IPE) cells were isolated with surface receptors similar to colony forming unit-erythroid (CFU-Es), and after removal of ectopic c-Myc expression cells hemoglobinized, decreased in cell size to that of native RBCs, and enucleated achieving cultures with 17% enucleated cells. Experiments with IPE cells at various levels of ectopic c-Myc expression provided insight into differentiation dynamics of the modified cells, and an optimized two-stage differentiation strategy was shown to promote greater expansion and maturation.
Genetic engineering of adult erythroid progenitor cells with an inducible c-Myc vector established an erythroid progenitor cell line that could produce RBCs, demonstrating the potential of this approach to produce large quantities of RBCs and modified RBC products.
In the development of dental fluorosis, oxidative stress is considered as the key mechanism. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress can induce oxidative stress and activate the important antioxidative factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in a PKR-like ER kinase (PERK)-dependent manner, but combining ER stress and oxidative stress, the role of PERK-Nrf2 signaling pathway involved in fluoride-regulated ameloblasts is not fully defined. Here, we studied the effect of fluoride on PERK-Nrf2 signaling pathway in mouse ameloblasts. We found that low-dose and continuous fluoride exposure increased binding immunoglobulin protein expression and activated PERK-activating transcription factor 4 signaling pathway. Meanwhile, the expression of Nrf2 and its target genes (glutamylcysteine synthetase and glutathione S-transferase-P1) enhanced following ER stress. Tunicamycin increased the expression of PERK, leading to Nrf2 nuclear import, and tauroursodeoxycholate suppressed Nrf2 activation through PERK during ER stress, indicating that PERK activation is required for Nrf2 nuclear entry. Furthermore, tert-butylhydroquinone triggered the overexpression of Nrf2 to reduce ER stress, but luteolin inhibited Nrf2 nuclear localization to elevate ER stress. In summary, this study proved that fluoride under certain dose can induce ER stress and promote Nrf2 nuclear import via PERK activation and suggested that antioxidation mechanism mediated by PERK-Nrf2 can alleviate fluoride-induced ER stress effectively.
We investigated whether administration of the δ-opioid receptor (DOR) agonist H-Dmt-Tic-NH-CH(CH2-COOH)-Bid (UFP-512), which also activates nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), alleviated chronic inflammatory and/or neuropathic pain and inhibited the depressive-like behaviors associated with persistent neuropathic pain. The possible mechanisms implicated were also assessed. We evaluated the following effects in male C57BL/6J mice with inflammatory pain induced by complete Freund's adjuvant or neuropathic pain caused by the chronic constriction of sciatic nerve: (1) the antinociceptive effects of UFP-512; (2) the effects of UFP-512 on the expression of Nrf2, heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (Akt), inducible nitric oxide synthase, DOR, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) in the spinal cord of animals with inflammatory or neuropathic pain; (3) the antinociceptive effects of the coadministration of UFP-512 with the Nrf2 activator sulforaphane (SFN); and (4) the antidepressant effects of UFP-512 in animals with depressive-like behaviors associated with neuropathic pain. Our results demonstrated that the intraperitoneal administration of UFP-512 inhibited chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain and reduced the depressive-like behaviors associated with persistent neuropathic pain. The antiallodynic effects of UFP-512 were significantly augmented when it was coadministered with SFN in both types of chronic pain. The administration of UFP-512 increased/reestablished the spinal cord protein levels of Nrf2 and HO-1 in mice with inflammatory or neuropathic pain. However, while during inflammatory pain UFP-512 inhibited spinal c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation induced by peripheral inflammation. This DOR agonist blocked the spinal activated PI3K/Akt signaling pathway under chronic neuropathic pain conditions, but it did not alter the enhanced protein levels of p-JNK or p-ERK1/2 induced by sciatic nerve injury. These results revealed the antinociceptive and antidepressant effects of UFP-512 in animals with chronic pain and the different mechanism of action of this DOR agonist in the presence of inflammatory or neuropathic pain. Our data also suggest the administration of UFP-512 as an alternative for the treatment of chronic pain and the depressive-like behaviors associated with neuropathic pain.
Diabetic cardiomyopathy is one of the main causes of heart failure and death in patients with diabetes mellitus. Reactive oxygen species produced excessively in diabetes mellitus cause necrosis, apoptosis, ferroptosis, inflammation, and fibrosis of the myocardium as well as impair the cardiac structure and function. It is increasingly clear that oxidative stress is a principal cause of diabetic cardiomyopathy. The transcription factor nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (NRF2) activates the transcription of more than 200 genes in the human genome. Most of the proteins translated from these genes possess anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-ferroptotic, and anti-fibrotic actions. There is a growing body of evidence indicating that NRF2 and its target genes are crucial in preventing high glucose-induced oxidative damage in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Recently, many natural and synthetic activators of NRF2 are shown to possess promising therapeutic effects on diabetic cardiomyopathy in animal models of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Targeting NRF2 signaling by pharmacological entities is a potential approach to ameliorating diabetic cardiomyopathy. However, the persistent high expression of NRF2 in cancer tissues also protects the growth of cancer cells. This "dark side" of NRF2 increases the challenges of using NRF2 activators to treat diabetic cardiomyopathy. In addition, some NRF2 activators were found to have off-target effects. In this review, we summarize the current status and challenges of NRF2 as a potential therapeutic target for diabetic cardiomyopathy.
Histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) and HDAC9 are class IIa HDACs that function as signal-responsive repressors of the epigenetic program for pathological cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.  The conserved deacetylase domains of HDAC5 and HDAC9 are not required for inhibition of cardiac hypertrophy.  Thus, the biological function of class IIa HDAC catalytic activity in the heart remains unknown.  Here, we demonstrate that catalytic activity of HDAC5, but not HDAC9, suppresses mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and subsequent induction of NF-E2 Related Factor 2 (NRF2)-dependent antioxidant gene expression in cardiomyocytes.  Treatment of cardiomyocytes with TMP195 or TMP269, which are selective class IIa HDAC inhibitors, or shRNA-mediated knockdown of HDAC5 but not HDAC9, leads to stimulation of NRF2-mediated transcription in a ROS-dependent manner.  Conversely, ectopic expression of catalytically active HDAC5 decreases cardiomyocyte oxidative stress and represses NRF2 activation.  These findings establish a role for the catalytic domain of HDAC5 in the control of cardiomyocyte redox homeostasis, and define TMP195 and TMP269 as a novel class of NRF2 activators that function by suppressing the enzymatic activity of an epigenetic regulator.
: Carnosic acid (CA) is a phytochemical found in some dietary herbs, such as Rosmarinus officinalis L., and possesses antioxidative and anti-microbial properties. We previously demonstrated that CA functions as an activator of nuclear factor, erythroid 2 (NF-E2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2), an oxidative stress-responsive transcription factor in human and rodent cells. CA enhances the expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) and antioxidant genes, such as HO-1 in an Nrf2-dependent manner in U373MG human astrocytoma cells. However, CA also induces NGF gene expression in an Nrf2-independent manner, since 50 μM of CA administration showed striking NGF gene induction compared with the classical Nrf2 inducer tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) in U373MG cells. By comparative transcriptome analysis, we found that CA activates activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) in addition to Nrf2 at high doses. CA activated ATF4 in phospho-eIF2α- and heme-regulated inhibitor kinase (HRI)-dependent manners, indicating that CA activates ATF4 through the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway. Furthermore, CA activated Nrf2 and ATF4 cooperatively enhanced the expression of NGF and many antioxidant genes while acting independently to certain client genes. Taken together, these results represent a novel mechanism of CA-mediated gene regulation evoked by Nrf2 and ATF4 cooperation.
Low protein diets (LPD; 0.6 g/kg/day), prescribed for nondialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, have demonstrated numerous benefits. LPDs may modulate inflammation and oxidative stress through the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which encodes antioxidant and phase II detoxifying enzymes. LPDs also inhibit or antagonize nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) activity, which orchestrates inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of LPD on Nfr2 and NF-κB messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in nondialysis CKD patients.
In this longitudinal study, a LPD was prescribed for 30 nondialysis CKD patients for 6 months. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed to evaluate Nrf2, NF-κB, and NADPH quinine oxidoreductase-1 mRNA expression. Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) levels, a marker of lipid peroxidation, were also evaluated.
(Age 55.5 ± 14.0 years; body mass index 29.1 ± 5.9 kg/m2; glomerular filtration rate 35.6 ± 12.2 mL/minute). After 6 months of nutritional intervention, Nrf2 mRNA expression increased from 0.85 (0.47-1.56) to 1.28 (0.63-2.63) nmol/mL (P = .03), and TBARS levels were significantly decreased from 1.78 (1.31-2.38) to 1.30 (1.07-2.22) nmol/mL (P = .04). NF-κB mRNA expression showed no significant difference after 6 months, but the Nrf2/NF-κB ratio was increased.
In this study, a LPD appeared to modulate Nrf2 expression and decrease the levels of TBARS in nondialysis CKD patients. However, more studies are needed to confirm the effectiveness of LPD on the modulation of transcription factors involved with oxidative stress and inflammation in nondialysis CKD patients.
Enhancing the supply of rumen-protected Met (RPM) during the peripartum period alleviates inflammation and oxidative stress status in dairy cows. We tested the hypothesis that RPM could increase abundance of genes and proteins related to glutathione (GSH) metabolism and the antioxidant transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2 (NFE2L2) in subcutaneous adipose tissue. Multiparous Holstein cows were fed a basal diet [control prepartum diet = 1.47 Mcal/kg of dry matter (DM) and 15.3% crude protein; control postpartum diet = 1.67 Mcal/kg of DM and 17.7% crude protein] or the control plus ethyl-cellulose RPM at a rate of 0.09 and 0.10% of DM intake before expected calving and after calving, respectively. Sixty cows were assigned to treatments based on parity, previous 305-d milk yield, and body condition score at 28 d from parturition. Diets were fed from -28 to 30 d. Biopsies of subcutaneous adipose tissue collected on d -10, 10, and 30 relative to parturition from 7 cows in each group were used for measuring concentrations of GSH, reactive oxygen species, superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde, and mRNA and protein abundance (Western blotting). A repeated-measures ANOVA was used for statistics. The statistical model included the random effect of block and fixed effects of treatment, time, and its interaction. There was a diet × time effect for reactive oxygen species due to lower concentrations in Met versus control cows specifically at d -10. Cows fed Met also had lower concentrations of malondialdehyde in subcutaneous adipose tissue. Compared with controls, overall mRNA abundance of the GSH metabolism-related genes cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS), glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit (GCLM), glutathione reductase (GSR), and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) was greater in cows fed Met. Furthermore, supply of Met resulted in an overall upregulation of protein abundance of glutathione peroxidase (GPX) 1, GPX3, glutathione S-transferase mu 1 (GSTM1), and glutathione S-transferase α 4 (GSTA4), all related to GSH metabolism. There was a diet × time effect for protein abundance of NFE2L2 and its repressor Kelch-like ECH associated protein 1 (KEAP1) due to lower values at 30 d in cows fed Met versus controls. The abundance of phosphorylated NFE2L2 was lower at 30 d in response to Met. Overall, the data suggest that exogenous Met may play a role in activating GSH metabolism and the antioxidant NFE2L2 pathways in subcutaneous adipose tissue.
Licochalcone A (Lico A), isolated from Xinjiang licorice Glycyrrhiza inflate, has been shown to have antioxidative potential via the activation of nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activation, which is involved in the prevention of acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity. The purpose of the current study was to further explore the protective effect of Lico A against lipopolysaccharide/d-galactosamine (LPS/GalN)-induced acute liver injury (ALI) and its underlying molecular mechanisms. Our results found that treatment with Lico A significantly reduced in LPS/GalN-induced hepatotoxicity by lessening lethality, alleviating histopathological liver changes, decreasing the alanine transaminase, and aspartate aminotransferase levels, attenuating the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, and regulating oxidative markers. Furthermore, Lico A efficiently alleviated LPS-induced inflammatory response by inhibiting TLR4-MAPK and -NF-κB, as well as the Txnip-NLRP3 signaling pathway. Meanwhile, Lico A induced the activation of Nrf2 and QSTM1 (P62) signaling and promoted autophagy involved in AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-the transcription factor EB (TFEB) signaling, which may contribute to its hepatoprotective activity. Additional mechanistic investigations to evaluate the dependence of the hepatoprotective role of Lico A on Nrf2 revealed that a lack of Nrf2 promoted Lico A-induced autophagy, which contributed to the hepatoprotective effect of Lico A in Nrf2-/- mice. In addition, cotreatment with autophagy inhibitor (3-methyladenine, 3-MA) alleviated but did not abrogate the hepatoprotective effect of Lico A, which may be attributed to its ability to activate Nrf2. Our study firstly suggests that Lico A has protective potential against LPS/GalN-induced hepatotoxicity, which may be strongly associated with activation of Nrf2 and autophagy.
Chlorogenic acid (CA), the ester of caffeic acid and quinic acid, is one of the most abundant polyphenols in coffee, and has multiple pharmacological functions. The present study is designed to explore the protection provided by CA against hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 )-induced oxidative damages in the rat pheochromocytoma cells, and the underlying mechanisms engaged in this process. CA displays robust free radical-scavenging activity in vitro. More importantly, CA strikingly rescues the cells from the H2 O2 -mediated oxidative insults. Mechanistic studies revealed that CA upregulates a panel of phase II cytoprotective species, such as heme oxygenase-1, NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1, glutathione, thioredoxin reductase 1, and thioredoxin 1. This neuroprotection is dependent on the activation of the transcription factor Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), as knockdown of Nrf2 abolishes such effect. Our results demonstrate that CA provides dual neuroprotection via directly neutralizing free radicals and indirectly inducing expression of Nrf2-driven cytoprotective enzymes, and suggest a potential therapeutic usage of CA as a neuroprotective agent. Coffee is one of the most popular drinks in the world, and our discovery may also contribute to understanding the beneficial effects of regular coffee consumption. © 2019 BioFactors, 2019.
Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 3 (NRF3), a nuclear transcription factor, has been implicated in various cellular processes including carcinogenesis. However, mechanisms underlying its regulation in carcinogenesis are unclear. Herein, we found that NRF3 is lowly expressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues and cells, and NRF3 low-expressions in CRC tissue samples are associated with CRC carcinogenesis and poor patient outcomes. Nrf3-knockdown increased CRC cell growth, colony formation, and cell motility and invasion, and Nrf3-knockin dramatically decreased CRC cell growth and colony formation. Mechanistically, NRF3 increased CRC cell apoptosis and arrested cell G2/M stage. NRF3 was found to be reversely with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and p38. Strikingly, Nrf3-knockin dramatically decreased phosphorylated-EGFR at Tyrosine845 (pEGFR Tyr845) and phosphorylated-p38 at Threonine180/Tyrosine182 (p-p38 Thr180/Tyr182) expressions, and Nrf3-knockdown increased pEGFR Tyr845 and p-p38 Thr180/Tyr182. Moreover, NRF3 regulated EGFR and p38 down-stream molecules, protein kinase B (AKT), activating transcription factor (ATF) 2, and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) expressions. NRF3 loss-increased CRC growth through EGFR and p38 was confirmed in nude mice. Collectively, NRF3-loss in CRC cell increases EGFR and p38 phosphorylation activation, enhances cell proliferation and decreases cell apoptosis, and finally promotes CRC malignance.
Even though the TET enzymes catalyze the generation of 5-hydroxymethyl-cytosines required for lineage commitment and subsequent differentiation of stem cells into erythroid cells, the mechanisms that link extra-cellular signals to TET activation and DNA hydroxymethylation are unknown. We demonstrate that hematopoietic cytokines phosphorylate TET2 leading to its activation in erythroid progenitors. Specifically, cytokine receptor associated, JAK2, phosphorylates TET2 at tyrosines 1939 and 1964. Phosphorylated TET2 interacts with erythroid transcription factor, KLF1, and this interaction with TET2 is increased upon exposure to erythropoietin. The activating JAK2V617F mutation seen in myeloproliferative disease patient samples and in mouse models is associated with increased TET activity and cytosine hydroxymethylation as well as genome wide loss of cytosine methylation. These epigenetic and functional changes are also associated with increased expression of several oncogenic transcripts. Thus, we demonstrate that JAK2 mediated TET2 phosphorylation provides a mechanistic link between extracellular signals and epigenetic changes during hematopoiesis.
Influence of Glutathione S-transferase Mu1 (GSTM1) has long been studied in breast cancer and GSTM1 null genotype was correlated with breast cancer risk. Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor-2 (NRF2) is a transcription factor that forms a complex with Kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1 (KEAP1). Recent studies have demonstrated that expression of these proteins is deregulated in several malignancies. Thus, in the present study we aim to distinguish GSTM1 heterozygous from wild type genotype in breast cancer patients and evaluate the presence and clinical significance of NRF2 and KEAP1 polymorphisms, alone or in association, with breast cancer prognosis, in cases confirmed to have GSTM1-present genotype. Study population consisted in 52 patients with breast cancer. Genomic DNA was extracted, GSTM1 was genotyped through multiplex PCR and gene dose was evaluated through real-time PCR. All cases were sequenced, through Sanger sequencing, for specific regions of NRF2 and KEAP1. Genotyping and clinicopathological data were correlated and statistical analysis was performed. GSTM1 wild type was identified in 1 case and 26 cases were identified as heterozygous, these data were correlated with Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2) status (p value = 0.017). We also verified that most cancers diagnosed at younger ages had the presence of KEAP1 and/or NRF2 polymorphisms. The association of GSTM1 heterozygous genotype with rs1048290 and rs35652124 seems to be associated with HER2+ (p &lt; 0.05). Our results suggest that GSTM1 * 1/0 genotype and the cumulative presence of at least one allele mutated in KEAP1 and/or NRF2 polymorphisms might be associated with worse prognosis for breast cancer patients.
Insertional mutagenesis is a powerful means of identifying cancer drivers in animal models. We used the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon/transposase system to identify activated oncogenes in hematologic cancers in wild-type mice and mice that express a stabilized cyclin E protein (termed cyclin ET74AT393A). Cyclin E governs cell division and is misregulated in human cancers. Cyclin ET74AT393A mice develop ineffective erythropoiesis that resembles early-stage human myelodysplastic syndrome, and we sought to identify oncogenes that might cooperate with cyclin E hyperactivity in leukemogenesis. SB activation in hematopoietic precursors caused T-cell leukemia/lymphomas (T-ALL) and pure red blood cell erythroleukemias (EL). Analysis of &gt;12,000 SB integration sites revealed markedly different oncogene activations in EL and T-ALL: Notch1 and Ikaros were most common in T-ALL, whereas ETS transcription factors (Erg and Ets1) were targeted in most ELs. Cyclin E status did not impact leukemogenesis or oncogene activations. Whereas most SB insertions were lost during culture of EL cell lines, Erg insertions were retained, indicating Erg's key role in these neoplasms. Surprisingly, cyclin ET74AT393A conferred growth factor independence and altered Erg-dependent differentiation in EL cell lines. These studies provide new molecular insights into erythroid leukemia and suggest potential therapeutic targets for human leukemia.
this review aimed to investigate the effects of green tea polyphenols (GTP) in Ulcerative colitis and Crohn´s Disease.
The databases used were MEDLINE-and EMBASE (October 2009 to September 2018). Studies that reported the use of green tea and its effects on IBD were included.
Ten articles were included in this review.
GTP play a role in reducing TNF-α, Interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-8, and 17; downregulate cyclooxygenase-mediated I kappa B kinase and transcription of NFκB. They regulate the pathways mediated by the Nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and signal transducer and the activator of transcription 1/3, and also minimize the lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, GTP can stimulate antioxidant enzymes. These actions reduce inflammatory and oxidant patterns in IBD resulting in improvement of the disease scores.
We suggest that professionals and researchers take into account the use of GTP in further researches and in clinical practice in order to verify the real effects in humans.
Oxidative stress is extremely important in the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV). In response to oxidative stress, adaptive antioxidant defenses are upregulated in the liver. The balance between antioxidant response and oxidative stress plays a key role in hepatic injury in HCV infection.
The objective of this study was to assess the hepatic expression of the antioxidant genes GFER (growth factor erv1-like) and NQO1 (NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1) and the regulatory gene NFE2L2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2) in liver biopsy specimens obtained from chronic HCV patients with regard to selected clinical parameters and histology, and to determine whether GFER and NQO1 expression is dependent on NFE2L2.
The study group consisted of 42 patients with chronic HCV. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to analyze the expression of antioxidant and regulatory genes in liver biopsy samples.
Positive correlation was observed between the hepatic expression of NFE2L2 and NQO1 in the chronic HCV patients (p &lt; 0.0001). The hepatic expression of NFE2L2 was significantly lower in patients with advanced liver fibrosis (p = 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the hepatic expression of GFER and NQO1 in relation to the progression of liver steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis.
The hepatic expression of NFE2L2 is associated with NQO1 and low stage of hepatic fibrosis in patients infected with HCV.
Doxorubicin (DOX) is one of the most effective chemotherapeutic drugs; however, the incidence of cardiotoxicity compromises its therapeutic index. Oxidative stress and apoptosis are believed to be involved in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Chitosan oligosaccharides (COS), the enzymatic hydrolysates of chitosan, have been reported to possess diverse biological activities including antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties. The objective of the present study was to investigate the potential role of COS against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, and the effects of COS on apoptosis and oxidative stress in rats and H9C2 cells. Furthermore, we also shed light on the involved pathways during the whole process. For this purpose, first, we demonstrated that COS exhibited a significant protective effect on cardiac tissue by not only inducing a decrease in body and heart growth but also ameliorated oxidative damage and ECG alterations in DOX-treated rats. Second, we found that COS reversed the decrease of cell viability induced by DOX, reduced the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and Bcl-2/Bax ratio. COS treatment also results in reduced caspase-3 and caspase-9 expressions, and an increase in the phosphorylation of MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) in DOX-exposed H9C2 cells. Additionally, cellular homeostasis was re-established via stabilization of MAPK mediated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/antioxidant-response element (Nrf2/ARE) signaling and transcription of downstream cytoprotective genes. In summary, these findings suggest that COS could be a potential candidate for the prevention and treatment of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.
Allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), a dietary phytochemical found in some cruciferous vegetables, is commonly used as an antimicrobial, anticancer, and antioxidant agent. In the present study, we investigated the effects of AITC on insulin resistance and transcription factors in a diabetic rat model. A total of 42 Wistar rats were divided into six groups and orally treated for 12 weeks as follows: (i) control; (ii) AITC (100 mg/kg body weight [BW]); (iii) high fat diet (HFD); (iv) HFD + AITC (100 mg/kg BW); (v) HFD + streptozotocin (STZ, 40 mg/kg BW); and (vi) HFD + STZ + AITC. Administration of AITC reduced blood glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and creatinine levels, but increased (P &lt; 0.001) total antioxidant capacity. In AITC-treated rats, the glucose transporter-2, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, p-insulin receptor substrate-1, and nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2 in the liver and kidney were increased while nuclear factor-kappa B was downregulated (P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, AITC possesses antidiabetic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities in HFD/STZ-induced T2DM in rats. These findings may further justify the importance of AITC in phytomedicine.
Acute erythroid leukemia (AEL) is a high-risk leukemia of poorly understood genetic basis, with controversy regarding diagnosis in the spectrum of myelodysplasia and myeloid leukemia. We compared genomic features of 159 childhood and adult AEL cases with non-AEL myeloid disorders and defined five age-related subgroups with distinct transcriptional profiles: adult, TP53 mutated; NPM1 mutated; KMT2A mutated/rearranged; adult, DDX41 mutated; and pediatric, NUP98 rearranged. Genomic features influenced outcome, with NPM1 mutations and HOXB9 overexpression being associated with a favorable prognosis and TP53, FLT3 or RB1 alterations associated with poor survival. Targetable signaling mutations were present in 45% of cases and included recurrent mutations of ALK and NTRK1, the latter of which drives erythroid leukemogenesis sensitive to TRK inhibition. This genomic landscape of AEL provides the framework for accurate diagnosis and risk stratification of this disease, and the rationale for testing targeted therapies in this high-risk leukemia.
p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF), a histone acetyltransferase, is involved in many cellular processes such as differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and reaction to cell damage by modulating the activities of several genes and proteins through the acetylation of either the histones or transcription factors. Here, we examined a pathogenic role of PCAF and its potential as a novel therapeutic target in the progression of renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis induced by non-diabetic unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) in male C57BL/6 mice. Administration of garcinol, a PCAF inhibitor, reversed a UUO-induced increase in the renal expression of total PCAF and histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation and reduced positive areas of trichrome and α-smooth muscle actin and collagen content. Treatment with garcinol also decreased mRNA levels of transforming growth factor-β, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, and fibronectin. Furthermore, garcinol suppressed nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-6, whereas it preserved the nuclear expression of nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like factor 2 (Nrf2) and levels of Nrf2-dependent antioxidants including heme oxygense-1, catalase, superoxide dismutase 1, and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1. These results suggest that the inhibition of inordinately enhanced PCAF could mitigate renal fibrosis by redressing aberrant balance between inflammatory signaling and antioxidant response through the modulation of NF-κB and Nrf2.
The TRP ion channel TRPM2 has an essential function in cell survival and protects the viability of a number of cell types after oxidative stress. It is highly expressed in many cancers including breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancer, melanoma, leukemia, and neuroblastoma, suggesting it promotes cancer cell survival. TRPM2 is activated by production of ADP-ribose (ADPR) following oxidative stress, which binds to the C-terminus of TRPM2, resulting in channel opening. In a number of cancers including neuroblastoma, TRPM2 has been shown to preserve viability and mechanisms have been identified. Activation of TRPM2 results in expression of transcription factors and kinases important in cell proliferation and survival including HIF-1/2α, CREB, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor-2 (Nrf2), and Pyk2, and Src phosphorylation. Together, HIF-1/2α and CREB regulate expression of genes encoding proteins with roles in mitochondrial function including members of the electron transport complex involved in ATP production. These contribute to lower mitochondrial ROS production while expression of antioxidants regulated by HIF-1/2α, FOXO3a, CREB, and Nrf2 is maintained. CREB is also important in control of expression of key proteins involved in autophagy. When TRPM2-mediated calcium influx is inhibited, mitochondria are dysfunctional, cellular bioenergetics are reduced, production of ROS is increased, and autophagy and DNA repair are impaired, decreasing tumor growth and increasing chemotherapy sensitivity. Inhibition of TRPM2 expression or function results in decreased tumor proliferation and/or viability in many malignancies including breast, gastric, pancreatic, prostate, head and neck cancers, melanoma, neuroblastoma, and T-cell and acute myelogenous leukemia. However, in a small number of malignancies, activation of TRPM2 rather than inhibition has been reported to reduce tumor cell survival. Here, TRPM2-mediated Ca2+ signaling and mechanisms of regulation of cancer cell growth and survival are reviewed and controversies discussed. Evidence suggests that targeting TRPM2 may be a novel therapeutic approach in many cancers.
Krüppel-like factor 1 (KLF1) is an essential transcription factor for erythroid development, as demonstrated by Klf1 knockout mice which die around E14 due to severe anemia. In humans, &gt;140 KLF1 variants, causing different erythroid phenotypes, have been described. The KLF1 Nan variant, a single amino acid substitution (p.E339D) in the DNA binding domain, causes hemolytic anemia and is dominant over wildtype KLF1. Here we describe the effects of the KLF1 Nan variant during fetal development. We show that Nan embryos have defects in erythroid maturation. RNA-sequencing of the KLF1 Nan fetal liver cells revealed that Exportin 7 (Xpo7) was among the 782 deregulated genes. This nuclear exportin is implicated in terminal erythroid differentiation; in particular it is involved in nuclear condensation. Indeed, KLF1 Nan fetal liver cells had larger nuclei and reduced chromatin condensation. Knockdown of XPO7 in wildtype erythroid cells caused a similar phenotype. We propose that reduced expression of XPO7 is partially responsible for the erythroid defects observed in KLF1 Nan erythroid cells.
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent and serious complication of sepsis; however, there are currently no effective therapies. Inflammation and oxidative stress are the major mechanisms implicated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced AKI. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) has been reported to have remarkable anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Here, we examined the renoprotective effects of DEX and potential underlying mechanisms in rats with LPS-induced AKI. We analyzed renal function and structure; serum inflammatory cytokine; renal oxidant and antioxidant levels; and renal expression of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β)/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway-related proteins in rats 4 hr after administration of LPS. Pretreatment with DEX improved renal function and significantly reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers. Treatment with DEX and the GSK-3β inhibitor SB216367 promoted phosphorylation of GSK-3β, induced Nrf2 nuclear translocation, and increased transcription of the Nrf2 target genes heme oxygenase-1 and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase-1, primarily in renal tubules. Alpha-2-adrenergic receptor (α2-AR) antagonist atipamezole and imidazoline I 2 receptor (I 2 R) antagonist idazoxan reversed the effects of DEX. These results suggest that the renoprotective effects of DEX are mediated via α2-AR and I 2 R-dependent pathways that reduce inflammation and oxidative stress through GSK-3β/Nrf2 signaling.
This study examined the impact of the tyrosine kinase Lyn on erythropoietin-induced intracellular signaling in erythroid cells. In J2E erythroleukemic cells, Lyn coimmunoprecipitated with numerous proteins, including SHP-1, SHP-2, ras-GTPase-activating protein, signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 5a, STAT5b, and mitogen-activated protein kinase; however, introduction of a dominant-negative Lyn (Y397F Lyn) inhibited the interaction of Lyn with all of these molecules except SHP-1. Cells containing the dominant-negative Lyn displayed altered intracellular phosphorylation patterns, including mitogen-actiated protein kinase, but not erythropoietin receptor, Janus-activated kinase (JAK) 2, or STAT5. As a consequence, erythropoietin-initiated differentiation and basal proliferation were severely impaired. Y397F Lyn reduced the protein levels of erythroid transcription factors erythroid Kruppel-like factor and GATA-1 up to 90%, which accounts for the inability of J2E cells expressing Y397F Lyn to synthesize hemoglobin. Although Lyn was shown to bind several sites on the cytoplasmic domain of the erythropoietin receptor, it was not activated when a receptor mutated at the JAK2 binding site was ectopically expressed in J2E cells indicating that JAK2 is the primary kinase in erythropoietin signaling and that Lyn is a secondary kinase. In normal erythroid progenitors, erythropoietin enhanced phosphorylation of Lyn; moreover, exogenous Lyn increased colony forming unit-erythroid, but not burst forming uniterythroid, colonies from normal progenitors, demonstrating a stage-specific effect of the kinase. Significantly, altering Lyn activity in J2E cells had a profound effect on the development of erythroleukemias in vivo: the mortality rate was markedly reduced and latent period extended when either wild-type Lyn or Y397F Lyn was introduced into these cells. Taken together, these data show that Lyn plays an important role in intracellular signaling in nontransformed and leukemic erythroid cells.
Hormonal status can influence diverse metabolic pathways. Small heterodimer partner (SHP) is an orphan nuclear receptor that can modulate the activity of several transcription factors. Estrogens are here shown to directly induce expression of the SHP in the mouse and rat liver and in human HepG2 cells. SHP is rapidly induced within 2 h following treatment of mice with ethynylestradiol (EE) or the estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha)-selective compound propyl pyrazole triol (PPT). SHP induction by these estrogens is completely absent in ERalphaKO mice. Mutation of the human SHP promoter defined HNF-3, HNF-4, GATA, and AP-1 sites as important for basal activity, whereas EE induction required two distinct elements located between -309 and -267. One of these elements contains an estrogen response element half-site that bound purified ERalpha, and ERalpha with a mutated DNA binding domain was unable to stimulate SHP promoter activity. This ERalpha binding site overlaps the known farnesoid X receptor (FXR) binding site in the SHP promoter, and the combination of EE plus FXR agonists did not produce an additive induction of SHP expression in mice. Surprisingly, induction of SHP by EE did not inhibit expression of the known SHP target genes cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) or sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase (CYP8B1). However, the direct regulation of SHP expression may provide a basis for some of the numerous biological effects of estrogens.
The filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans nudC gene has an essential function in movement of nuclei following mitosis and is required for normal colony growth. Here, the molecular cloning and role in hematopoiesis of a human gene (designated HnudC) homologous to A. nidulans nudC is reported. The amino terminus of the larger human protein (HNUDC = 45 kDa) does not overlap with A. nidulans NUDC (22 kDa). However, NUDC and the C-terminal 94 amino acids of HNUDC are 67% identical. The C-terminal region of the HnudC gene fully complements the A. nidulans temperature-sensitive nudC3 mutation, suggesting that nudC has an essential function in cell growth that is conserved from filamentous fungi to humans. In initial studies, HNUDC levels were much higher in erythroid precursors compared to most other human tissues. Therefore, the potential role of HnudC in hematopoiesis was explored. In normal human bone marrow, HNUDC protein and mRNA are highly expressed in early myeloid and erythroid precursors and decline as these cells terminally differentiate. To determine whether hematopoietic growth factors induce HnudC expression, TF-1 cells were stimulated by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. This induced a significant increase in HNUDC protein and HnudC mRNA, suggesting that enhancement of HnudC expression in response to growth factor stimulation may be mediated at the transcription level. Furthermore, HNUDC was significantly enhanced in lysates of bone marrow aspirates from patients with acute myelogenous and acute lymphoblastic leukemia compared to aspirates from normal controls, suggesting that HnudC is involved in malignant hematopoietic cell growth as well. These data demonstrate that HNUDC is highly expressed in normal and malignant human hematopoietic precursors and suggest it is of functional importance in the proliferation of these cells.
Myricetin is a natural flavonoid used in various health management systems. In this present study myricetin tested to evaluate the effect on lipids and lipid metabolism enzymes in normal and streptozotocin (STZ) with cadmium (Cd) induced diabetic nephrotoxic rats. Diabetic nephrotoxic rats were significantly (P&lt;0.05) increased the levels of urinary albumin and lipid profiles: total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), free fatty acids (FFAs), phospholipids (PLs), low density lipoprotein (LDL), very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), and decreased in the levels of high-density lipoproteins (HDL). In addition, the activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) were decreased significantly, whereas the 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HmgCoA) reductase activity was increased. The upregulation of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1a (SREBP-1a), SREBP-1c, SREBP-2, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and downregulation peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α) proteins expression levels were noticed. An administration of myricetin (1.0 mg/kg body weight (b/w)) for 12 weeks was brought the above parameters towards normal level. Histopathological study of kidney samples showed that extracellular mesangial matrix expansion, glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis in diabetic nephrotoxic rats was suppressed by myricetin treatment. Further our results indicate that administration of myricetin afforded remarkable protection against STZ-Cd induced alterations in lipid metabolism and thereby reduced the diabetic nephropathy in experimental rats. 
Hepatic cholesterol accumulation and autophagy defects contribute to hepatocyte injury in fatty liver disease. Bile acid synthesis is a major pathway for cholesterol catabolism in the liver. This study aims to understand the molecular link between cholesterol and bile acid metabolism and hepatic autophagy activity.
The effects of cholesterol and cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) expression on autophagy and lysosome function were studied in cell models. The effects and mechanism of disrupting enterohepatic bile acid circulation on hepatic autophagy were studied in mice.
The results first showed differential regulation of hepatic autophagy by free cholesterol and cholesterol ester, whereby a modest increase of cellular free cholesterol, but not cholesterol ester, impaired lysosome function and caused marked autolysosome accumulation. We found that CYP7A1 induction, either by cholestyramine feeding in mice or adenovirus-mediated CYP7A1 expression in hepatocytes, caused strong autophagy induction. Mechanistically, we showed that CYP7A1 expression markedly attenuated growth factor/AKT signaling activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), but not amino acid signaling to mTOR in vitro and in vivo. Metabolomics analysis further found that CYP7A1 induction not only decreased hepatic cholesterol but also altered phospholipid and sphingolipid compositions. Collectively, these results suggest that CYP7A1 induction interferes with growth factor activation of AKT/mTOR signaling possibly by altering membrane lipid composition. Finally, we showed that cholestyramine feeding restored impaired hepatic autophagy and improved metabolic homeostasis in Western diet-fed mice.
This study identified a novel CYP7A1-AKT-mTOR signaling axis that selectively induces hepatic autophagy, which helps improve hepatocellular integrity and metabolic homeostasis.
The C. elegans Ce-fkh-1 gene has been cloned on the basis of its sequence similarity to the winged-helix DNA binding domain of the Drosophila fork head and mammalian HNF-3alpha,beta,gamma genes, and mutations in the zygotically active pha-4 gene have been shown to block formation of the pharynx (and rectum) at an early stage in embryogenesis. In the present paper, we show that Ce-fkh-1 and pha-4 are the same gene. We show that PHA-4 protein is present in nuclei of essentially all pharyngeal cells, of all five cell types. PHA-4 protein first appears close to the point at which a cell lineage will produce only pharyngeal cells, independently of cell type. We show that PHA-4 binds directly to a 'pan-pharyngeal enhancer element' previously identified in the promoter of the pharyngeal myosin myo-2 gene; in transgenic embryos, ectopic PHA-4 activates ectopic myo-2 expression. We also show that ectopic PHA-4 can activate ectopic expression of the ceh-22 gene, a pharyngeal-specific NK-2-type homeodomain protein previously shown to bind a muscle-specific enhancer near the PHA-4 binding site in the myo-2 promoter. We propose that it is the combination of pha-4 and regulatory molecules such as ceh-22 that produces the specific gene expression patterns during pharynx development. Overall, pha-4 can be described as an 'organ identity factor', completely necessary for organ formation, present in all cells of the organ from the earliest stages, capable of integrating upstream developmental pathways (in this case, the two distinct pathways that produce the anterior and posterior pharynx) and participating directly in the transcriptional regulation of organ specific genes. Finally, we note that the distribution of PHA-4 protein in C. elegans embryos is remarkably similar to the distribution of the fork head protein in Drosophila embryos: high levels in the foregut/pharynx and hindgut/rectum; low levels in the gut proper. Moreover, we show that pha-4 expression in the C. elegans gut is regulated by elt-2, a C. elegans gut-specific GATA-factor and possible homolog of the Drosophila gene serpent, which influences fork head expression in the fly gut. Overall, our results provide evidence for a highly conserved pathway regulating formation of the digestive tract in all (triploblastic) metazoa.
The new classification of malignant fibrous histiocytoma leaves only a small group of tumors without further line of differentiation, so-called pleomorphic sarcomas, not otherwise specified (NOS) as a pseudo-entity. This study focused on these tumors and analyzed the association of gene expression profiles to clinical outcome.
Ten fresh samples of pleomorphic NOS sarcomas were evaluated histopathologically and by means of microarray analysis. Analysis of expression profiles was performed by clustering methods as well as by statistical analysis of primary vs recurrent tumors, irradiated vs nonirradiated tumors, tumors of patients above and below 60 years of age, male and female, and of tumors that developed metastatic or recurrent disease during the clinical course and those that did not.
Tumor clustering did not correlate to any histopathological or clinical finding. Detailed gene expression analysis showed a variety of genes whose upregulation (platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha polypeptide, solute carrier family 39 member 14, solute carrier family 2 member 3, pleiotrophin, trophinin, pleckstrin and Sec7 domain containing 3, enolase 2, biglycan, SH3 and cysteine-rich domain, matrix metalloproteinases 16) and whose downregulation (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 4, hairy/enhancer of split related with YRPW motif 2, protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor-type Z polypeptide 1, SH3 domain GRB2-like 2, microtubule-associated protein 7, potassium voltage-gated channel shaker-related subfamily member 1, RUN and FYVE domain containing 3, Sin3A-associated protein 18 kDa, proline-rich 4, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ID, myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia translocated to 3, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5, nucleoside diphosphate-linked moiety X-type motif 9, NudC domain containing 3, imprinted in Prader-Willi syndrome, TAF6-like RNA polymerase II p300/CBP-associated factor 65 kDa, WD repeat and SOCS box-containing 2, adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factor 3, KRR1, proliferation-associated 2G4; CD36, complement component (3b/4b) receptor 1, solute carrier family 4 sodium bicarbonate cotransporter member 4, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), GATA binding protein 3, LPL, glutathione peroxidase 3, D: -aspartate oxidase, apolipoprotein E, sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase acid-like 3A) were associated with poor clinical outcome in terms of development of metastatic or recurrent disease.
The classification of these tumors may undergo further changes in the future. Gene expression profiling can provide additional information to categorize pleomorphic sarcoma (NOS) and reveal potential prognostic factors in this "entity."
Bats live longer than similar-sized mammals, but the number of lineages that have independently evolved extreme longevity has not previously been determined. Here we reconstruct the evolution of size-corrected longevity on a recent molecular phylogeny and find that at least four lineages of bats have lifespans more than fourfold those of similar-sized placental mammals, with the ancestral bat projected to live 2.6 times as long. We then evaluate a series of phylogenetic generalized least-squares models containing up to nine variables hypothesized to influence extrinsic mortality. These analyses reveal that body mass and hibernation predict longevity. Among hibernators, longevity is predicted by the absolute value of the median latitude of the species range and cave use, while cave use and lack of sexual dimorphism predict longevity among non-hibernators. The importance of torpor in extending lifespan is further supported by the one lineage with extreme longevity that does not hibernate but exhibits flexible thermoregulation, the common vampire bat. We propose several potential mechanisms that may enable bats to live so long, and suggest that the ability to tolerate a wide range of body temperatures could be important for surviving viral or other pathogen infections.
Recent discoveries show that early in life effects often have long-lasting influences, sometimes even spanning several generations. Such intergenerational effects of early life events appear not easily reconcilable with strict genetic inheritance. However, an integrative evolutionary medicine of early life effects needs a sound view of inheritance in development and evolution. Here, we show how to articulate the gene-centred and non-gene-centred visions of inheritance. We first recall the coexistence of two gene concepts in scientific discussions, a statistical one (focused on patterns of parent-offspring resemblance, and implicitly including non-DNA-sequence-based resemblance), and a molecular one (based on the DNA sequence). We then show how all the different mechanisms of inheritance recently discovered can be integrated into an inclusive theory of evolution where different mechanisms would enable adaptation to changing environments at different timescales. One surprising consequence of this integrative vision of inheritance is that early in life effects start much earlier than fertilization. This article is part of the theme issue 'Developing differences: early-life effects and evolutionary medicine'.
Studying ontogeny in both extant and extinct species can unravel the mechanisms underlying mammal diversification and specialization. Among mammalian clades, Cetartiodactyla encompass species with a wide range of adaptations, and ontogenetic evidence could clarify longstanding debates on the origins of modern specialized families. Here, we study the evolution of dental eruption patterns in early diverging cetartiodactyls to assess the ecological and biological significance of this character and shed new light on phylogenetic issues. After investigation of the ontogenetic dental series of 63 extinct genera, our parsimony reconstructions of eruption state evolution suggest that the eruption of molars before permanent premolars represents a plesiomorphic condition within Cetartiodactyla. This result substantially differs from a previous study based on modern species only. As a result, the presence of this pattern in most ruminants might represent an ancestral condition contributing to their specialized herbivory, rather than an original adaptation. In contrast, the late eruption of molars in hippopotamoids is more likely related to biological aspects, such as increases in body mass and slower pace of life. Our study mainly shows that eruption sequences reliably characterize higher level cetartiodactyl taxa and could represent a new source of phylogenetic characters, especially to disentangle the origin of hippopotamoids and cetaceans.
Each year, large numbers of bats move across Europe between their summer and winter areas, yet even though many of them are endangered and legally protected, we are unaware about many aspects of their migratory behaviour. Here, taking Nyctalus noctula as a model species, we used stable hydrogen isotopic values in fur ( δ2Hf) as an endogenous marker to shed light on the migratory behaviour of more than 1000 bats from hibernacula across Central Europe. Specifically, we asked the following questions: how flexible is migration in temperate zone bats? Which general migration pattern do noctule bats follow? How repeatable and thus predictable is the migratory behaviour of individuals? Do morphological correlates of migration occur in bats? Our study confirmed that noctule bats engage in partial and female-biased migration across Europe, suggesting the strongest migration pressures for northern populations. Further, we revealed a combination of partial and differential migration patterns with highly variable migration distances which lead to a pronounced mixing of different source populations in hibernacula where mating occurs. Most individuals were consistent in their migration strategy over time, i.e. 86% could be repeatedly assigned to either long-distance or regional origin across years. This is consistent with our finding that the between-individual component explained 84% of the variation in δ2Hf values, suggesting specialized individual migratory behaviours and a strong natal philopatry. We discovered a positive correlation between forearm length and migration distance and support for sex-specific effects of migration on body condition. Our study elucidated migration patterns over large geographical scales, demonstrating that considerable numbers of migratory bats originating from distant populations depend on hibernacula across Central Europe, calling for international conservation management.
Bats and birds are key providers of ecosystem services in forests. How climate and habitat jointly shape their communities is well studied, but whether biotic predictors from other trophic levels may improve bird and bat diversity models is less known, especially across large bioclimatic gradients. Here, we achieved multi-taxa surveys in 209 mature forests replicated in six European countries from Spain to Finland, to investigate the importance of biotic predictors (i.e. the abundance or activity of defoliating insects, spiders, earthworms and wild ungulates) for bat and bird taxonomic and functional diversity. We found that nine out of 12 bird and bat diversity metrics were best explained when biotic factors were added to models including climate and habitat variables, with a mean gain in explained variance of 38% for birds and 15% for bats. Tree functional diversity was the most important habitat predictor for birds, while bats responded more to understorey structure. The best biotic predictors for birds were spider abundance and defoliating insect activity, while only bat functional evenness responded positively to insect herbivory. Accounting for potential biotic interactions between bats, birds and other taxa of lower trophic levels will help to understand how environmental changes along large biogeographical gradients affect higher-level predator diversity in forest ecosystems.
It is well-established that the mass and function of human brown adipose tissue (BAT) declines with age. A key factor involved in age-related impairment of BAT is oxidative stress; however, there is a paucity of studies to date that have explored this relationship. Here, we characterized the age-related molecular and functional alterations in BAT in vivo in mice of different ages, and treated human brown adipocytes with H2 O2 to dissect the direct effect of oxidative stress in vitro. We further explored the structural and functional changes in BAT in an oxidative stress-induced mouse model of aging. We found that the progressive deterioration of BAT was linked to oxidative stress, and observed that the adipogenesis and thermogenic program were significantly impaired upon H2 O2 treatment in vitro. Moreover, antioxidant supplementation (e.g., vitamin E) attenuated oxidative stress and rescued BAT activity decline, suggesting that age-related injury in BAT function can be partly alleviated by antioxidant treatment. Finally, we found that oxidative stress-induced BAT dysfunction is linked to the enhancement of autophagy. These results point to oxidative stress as being an important factor in age-dependent functional impairment of BAT.
Interspecific differences in traits can alter the relative niche use of species within the same environment. Bats provide an excellent model to study niche use because they use a wide variety of behavioral, acoustic, and morphological traits that may lead to multi-species, functional groups. Predatory bats have been classified by their foraging location (edge, clutter, open space), ability to use aerial hawking or substrate gleaning and echolocation call design and flexibility, all of which may dictate their prey use. For example, high frequency, broadband calls do not travel far but offer high object resolution while high intensity, low frequency calls travel further but provide lower resolution. Because these behaviors can be flexible, four behavioral categories have been proposed: (a) gleaning, (b) behaviorally flexible (gleaning and hawking), (c) clutter-tolerant hawking, and (d) open space hawking. Many recent studies of diet in bats use molecular tools to identify prey but mainly focus on one or two species in isolation; few studies provide evidence for substantial differences in prey use despite the many behavioral, acoustic, and morphological differences. Here, we analyze the diet of 17 sympatric species in the Chihuahuan desert and test the hypothesis that peak echolocation frequency and behavioral categories are linked to differences in diet. We find no significant correlation between dietary richness and echolocation peak frequency though it spanned close to 100 kHz across species. Our data, however, suggest that bats which use both gleaning and hawking strategies have the broadest diets and are most differentiated from clutter-tolerant aerial hawking species.
Following diagnosis of neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) anaphylaxis, identifying safe alternatives for subsequent anaesthesia is critical. A patient with anaphylaxis to one NMBA can also have an allergic reaction to other NMBAs (cross-reactivity). Whilst drug provocation testing is standard for identifying or excluding allergy, there is significant risk. In vitro, after an allergen activates basophils, basophils express surface activation markers that can be measured by basophil activation testing (BAT). We compared cross-reactivity between NMBAs assessed by BAT against that by skin testing.
All patients attending an anaesthetic allergy clinic in Sydney, Australia between May 2017 and July 2018 diagnosed with NMBA anaphylaxis qualified for this study comparing intradermal skin tests and BAT with a panel of NMBAs (rocuronium, vecuronium, pancuronium, suxamethonium, cisatracurium).
Of the 61 patients participating, sensitisation on skin testing and on BAT completely matched in only nine patients (15%). Sensitisation was not in agreement for pancuronium, cisatracurium and rocuronium, but was in agreement for vecuronium and suxamethonium. Nine patients with negative skin tests subsequently tolerated cisatracurium, and one false positive on BAT to cisatracurium was detected.
The utility of BAT in identifying safe NMBAs for subsequent anaesthesia needs further evaluation. BAT detects a different cross-reactivity profile to skin tests. Negative skin testing and BAT might increase confidence in performing drug provocation testing, but this and follow-up of subsequent anaesthesia in our cohort is necessary to determine the clinical significance of BAT sensitisation.
Nowadays, polymer reaction engineers seek robust and effective tools to synthesize complex macromolecules with well-defined and desirable microstructural and architectural characteristics. Over the past few decades, several promising approaches, such as controlled living (co)polymerization systems and chain-shuttling reactions have been proposed and widely applied to synthesize rather complex macromolecules with controlled monomer sequences. Despite the unique potential of the newly developed techniques, tailor-making the microstructure of macromolecules by suggesting the most appropriate polymerization recipe still remains a very challenging task. In the current work, two versatile and powerful tools capable of effectively addressing the aforementioned questions have been proposed and successfully put into practice. The two tools are established through the amalgamation of the Kinetic Monte Carlo simulation approach and machine learning techniques. The former, an intelligent modeling tool, is able to model and visualize the intricate inter-relationships of polymerization recipes/conditions (as input variables) and microstructural features of the produced macromolecules (as responses). The latter is capable of precisely predicting optimal copolymerization conditions to simultaneously satisfy all predefined microstructural features. The effectiveness of the proposed intelligent modeling and optimization techniques for solving this extremely important 'inverse' engineering problem was successfully examined by investigating the possibility of tailor-making the microstructure of Olefin Block Copolymers via chain-shuttling coordination polymerization.
Materials that are both biodegradable and bio-sourced are becoming serious candidates for substituting traditional petro-sourced plastics that accumulate in natural systems. New biocomposites have been produced by melt extrusion, using bacterial polyester (poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate)) as a matrix and cellulose particles as fillers. In this study, gas-phase esterified cellulose particles, with palmitoyl chloride, were used to improve filler-matrix compatibility and reduce moisture sensitivity. Structural analysis demonstrated that intrinsic properties of the polymer matrix (crystallinity, and molecular weight) were not more significantly affected by the incorporation of cellulose, either virgin or grafted. Only a little decrease in matrix thermal stability was noticed, this being limited by cellulose grafting. Gas-phase esterification of cellulose improved the filler's dispersion state and filler/matrix interfacial adhesion, as shown by SEM cross-section observations, and limiting the degradation of tensile properties (stress and strain at break). Water vapor permeability, moisture, and liquid water uptake of biocomposites were increased compared to the neat matrix. The increase in thermodynamic parameters was limited in the case of grafted cellulose, principally ascribed to their increased hydrophobicity. However, no significant effect of grafting was noticed regarding diffusion parameters.
Most large raptors on migration avoid crossing the sea because of the lack of atmospheric convection over temperate seas. The osprey Pandion haliaetus is an exception among raptors, since it can fly over several hundred kilometres of open water. We equipped five juvenile ospreys with GPS-Accelerometer-Magnetometer loggers. All birds were able to find and use thermal uplift while crossing the Mediterranean Sea, on average 7.5 times per 100 km, and could reach altitudes of 900 m above the sea surface. Their climb rate was 1.6 times slower than over land, and birds kept flapping most of the time while circling in the thermals, indicating that convections cells were weaker than over land. The frequency of thermal soaring was correlated with the difference between the sea surface and air temperature, indicating that atmospheric convection occurred when surface waters were warmer than the overlaying air. These observations help explain the transoceanic cosmopolitan distribution of osprey, and question the widely held assumption that water bodies represent strict barriers for large raptors.
Brown adipocytes, which exist in brown adipose tissue (BAT), are activated by adrenergic stimulation, depending on the activity of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). Beige adipocytes emerge from white adipose tissue (WAT) in response to chronic adrenergic stimulation. We investigated obesity-related changes in responses of both types of adipocytes to adrenergic stimulation in mice. Feeding of mice with high-fat diets (HFD: 45%-kcal fat) for 14 weeks resulted in significantly higher body and WAT weight compared to feeding with normal diets (ND: 10%-kcal fat). Injection with β3-adrenergic receptor agonist CL316,243 (CL; 0.1 mg/kg, once a day) for one week elevated the mRNA and protein expression levels of UCP1 in BAT, irrespective of diet. In WAT, CL-induced UCP1 expression in ND mice; however, the responses to CL treatment were attenuated in HFD mice, indicating that CL-induced browning of WAT was impaired in obese mice. Flow cytometric analysis revealed a significant decrease in platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) α-expressing beige adipocyte progenitors in WAT of HFD mice compared with those of ND mice. Expression of PDGF-B, a PDGFRα ligand, increased in WAT following CL-injection in ND mice, but not in HFD mice. Treatment of mice with a PDGFR inhibitor significantly decreased CL-dependent UCP1 protein induction in WAT. Our study demonstrates that ß3-adrenergic stimulation-dependent beige adipocyte induction in WAT is impaired by obesity in mice, potentially due to obesity-dependent reduction in the number of PDGFRα-expressing progenitors and decreased PDGF-B expression.
From bats to whales, millions of mammals migrate every year. However, their navigation capacity for accomplishing long-distance movements remains remarkably understudied and lags behind by five decades compared to other animals [1, 2]-partly because, unlike for other taxa, such as birds and sea turtles, no small-scale orientation assay has so far been developed. Yet recently, bats became a model to investigate which cues mammals use for long-range navigation, and, surprisingly for nocturnal animals, sunset cues, and particularly polarized-light cues, appear to be crucial for calibration of the magnetic-compass system in non-migratory bats [3-5]. This does not appear to hold for a species of migratory bat, however [6], and thus the nature of the information used by migratory bats for navigation remains unclear. Here, we asked whether the position of the solar disk per se is relevant for compass orientation in a migratory bat, Pipistrellus pygmaeus. Using a new experimental assay that measures takeoff orientation, we tested the orientation of bats exposed to a shifted sunset azimuth using a mirror at dusk. Bats exposed to a 180°-rotated azimuth of the setting sun and released after translocation during the same night shifted their heading direction by ∼180° compared to control bats. However, first-year migrants had no clear orientation either as controls or after the same treatment. This suggests that learning the migratory direction is a key component in the navigational system of naive bats in this species. Our study provides rare evidence for the specific cues and mechanisms that migratory mammals use for navigation.
It has been suggested that a balanced nutritional intake may be useful in preventing or even reversing sarcopenia.
To describe cross-sectional associations between dietary nutrient intake and sarcopenia.
Subjects recruited from the SarcoPhAge study population completed a food frequency questionnaire. The micronutrient and macronutrient intake was evaluated in both sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic participants. The Nutritional Belgian Recommendations of 2016 were used, i.e., adequate intake and estimated average requirement (EAR). For micronutrients, the prevalence of insufficient intake was estimated as the proportion of subjects whose intake was below the EAR.
A total of 331 subjects (mean age of 74.8 ± 5.9 years, 58.9% women) had complete data and were included in this study. Among them, 51 were diagnosed with sarcopenia (15.4%). In the fully adjusted model, analyses revealed that sarcopenic subjects consumed significantly lower amounts of two macronutrients (proteins, lipids) and five micronutrients (potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, iron, and vitamin K) than non-sarcopenic subjects (all p values &lt; 0.005). A significantly increased prevalence of insufficiency was found for sarcopenic subjects compared to non-sarcopenic subjects for potassium, magnesium, iron, calcium and vitamins E and C (all p values &lt; 0.005). The prevalence of sarcopenic subjects who were also below the Nutritional Belgian Recommendations for protein and lipids was significantly higher than that of non-sarcopenic subjects.
Sarcopenic subjects seem to consume significantly reduced amounts of many micronutrients and macronutrients compared to non-sarcopenic subjects. These results suggest that a poorly balanced diet may be associated with sarcopenia and poor musculoskeletal health, although prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.
Activation of the sympathetic nervous system increases sodium retention in resistant hypertension. Baroreflex activation therapy (BAT) is an interventional method to reduce sympathetic overactivity in patients with resistant hypertension. This study aimed to assess the effect of BAT on urinary sodium excretion.
From 2012 to 2015, consecutive patients with resistant hypertension and blood pressure (BP) above target despite polypharmacy strategies were consecutively included in this observational study. BAT was provided with the individual adaption of programmed parameters over the first months. 24-h urinary sodium excretion (UNa) was estimated at baseline and after 6 months using the Kawasaki formula in patients undergoing BAT. Additionally, the fractional sodium excretion, plasma renin activity, and aldosterone levels were assessed.
Forty-two patients completed the 6-month follow-up period. Office systolic and ambulatory 24-h systolic BP at baseline were 169 ± 27 mmHg and 148 ± 16 mmHg despite a median intake of 7(3-9) antihypertensive drugs. After 6 months of BAT, systolic office BP decreased to 150 ± 29 mmHg (p &lt; 0.01), 24-h systolic BP to 142 ± 22 mmHg (p = 0.04) and 24-h UNa increased by 37% compared to baseline (128 ± 66 vs. 155 ± 83 mmol/day, p &lt; 0.01). These findings were accompanied by a significant increase in fractional sodium excretion (0.74% [0.43-1.47] to 0.92% [0.61-1.92]; p = 0.02). However, in contrast to the significant BP reduction, eGFR, plasma sodium, renin activity and aldosterone levels did not change during BAT. The increase in sodium excretion was correlated with the change in eGFR (r = 0.371; p = 0.015).
The present study revealed a significant increase of estimated 24-h UNa which may contribute to the long-term BP-lowering effects of this interventional method.
Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) remain the leading cause of perioperative anaphylaxis in Australia. Standard evaluation comprises history, skin tests, and in vitro specific immunoglobulin E tests. Drug provocation tests to suspected NMBA culprits are associated with a significant risk. Basophil activation testing (BAT) is a potentially useful in vitro test that is not commercially available in Australia or as part of standard evaluation.
All patients attending the Anaesthetic Allergy Clinic in Sydney, Australia between May 2017 and July 2018 exposed to an NMBA before the onset of anaphylaxis during their anaesthetic qualified for the study. We recruited 120 patients sequentially who received standard evaluation plus BAT using CD63, CD203c, and CD300a as surface activation markers.
BAT results were expressed as % upregulation above the negative control and stimulation index (mean fluorescence index of stimulated sample divided by the negative control). We calculated cut-offs of 4.45% and 1.44 for CD63, and 8.80% and 1.49 for CD203c, respectively. Sensitivity was 77% with specificity of 76%. A subgroup of 10 patients with NMBA anaphylaxis had no sensitisation on skin tests. BAT using CD63 and CD203c showed sensitisation in six of these 10, and adding CD300a identified sensitisation in nine patients. BAT was positive in seven of nine patients with anaphylaxis of unknown aetiology.
BAT may be a useful supplement to the standard evaluation in diagnosing NMBA anaphylaxis in patients with suggestive histories, but no sensitisation on skin tests. Ongoing study of this specific group of patients is required to clarify its utility in clinical practice.
Proximity to humans is a primary stressor for wildlife, especially in urban habitats where frequent disturbance may occur. Several bat species often roost in buildings but while the effects of disturbance inside the roost are well documented, little is known about those occurring in the proximity of roosts. We tested the effects of anthropogenic stressors on bats by monitoring reactions to disturbance in a colony of greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum). We assessed disturbance by recording and quantifying the presence of people, domestic cats and noise sources near the roost. Disturbance outside the roost caused the disruption of roosting clusters; when cats entered the roost, bats decreased indoor flight activity. Emergence timing was delayed when people were close to the roost exit, and the delay increased along with the number of people. The occurrence of a cat increased the degree of group clustering during emergence. Cats entered the roost especially when young bats were present, and bat remains occurred in 30% of the cat scats we examined. We show that the occurence of human activities near roosts and free-ranging domestic cats are important albeit overlooked sources of disturbance.
Several N-Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC)-boryl sulfides with B-substituents were prepared. The added steric hindrance leads to much improved selectivities as only the NHC-boryl mono-sulfides were obtained. The B-substituted NHC-boranes are also conducive to more selective S to N NHC-boryl shift, provided that the NHC used is not too sterically demanding.
Major guidelines emphasise the potential of visco-elastic methods to overcome the limitations of conventional laboratory assays in the peri-operative setting. Their sensitivity regarding mild bleeding disorders (MBDs), the most common bleeding disorders in the general population, is however unknown.
The aim of this study was to investigate the sensitivity of thromboelastometry for diagnosis of MBD.
A single-centre prospective cohort study.
Haematology outpatient unit of a tertiary general hospital in Central Switzerland.
All consecutive patients referred over a 32-month period with a suspected bleeding disorder were included and thromboelastometry was conducted using a ROTEM delta (EXTEM, INTEM and FIBTEM). Diagnostic work-up was performed according to current guidelines including the ISTH bleeding assessment tool (ISTH BAT).
Distribution of clotting time (CT) and maximum clot firmness (MCF) results in relation to the presence of MBD.
Two hundred and seventeen patients were assessed; the median [IQR] age was 39 years [28 to 57]; 151 patients were women (70%). MBD was diagnosed in 97 patients (45%), no MBD was found in 100 patients (46%) and a systemic disorder recognised in 20 patients (9%). Presence of MBD was not associated with a significant difference in thromboelastometry variables (0.2 s in CT EXTEM, 95% CI -2.3 to 2.7; -0.2 mm in MCF EXTEM, 95% CI -1.8 to 1.5; -0.7 s in CT INTEM, 95% CI -12.6 to 11.2; 0.6 mm in MCF INTEM, 95% CI -1.2 to 1.3; 0.8 mm in MCF FIBTEM, 95% CI -1.6 to 1.4) and most results were within the established reference ranges.
Our data did not support the use of thromboelastometry as a diagnostic tool in patients with MBD.
Pareidolic associations are commonly used in medical education to enhance perception of radiological abnormalities. A number of animal-inspired neuroradiological pareidolias have been defined which should alert clinicians to specific movement disorder diagnoses.
A review of the published literature detailing neuroradiological abnormalities in movement disorder syndromes was conducted, looking specifically for established animal-inspired pareidolic associations.
A number of animal-inspired neuroradiological patterns with specific movement disorder associations have been defined. These include eye of the tiger sign, face of the panda sign, swallow tail sign, hummingbird sign, Mickey Mouse sign, ears of the lynx sign, dragonfly cerebellum, tadpole sign, tigroid/leopard skin sign, and bat wing sign.
Pareidolias represent a quick and easy way of enhancing perception, thereby improving the efficiency and accuracy of image analysis. Movement disorder physicians should keep in mind these associations, given that they will likely facilitate scan analysis.
The Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident led to the contamination by radiocesium (137Cs) of large drained areas. Cesium-137 concentrations in rivers result from complex transfer processes, depending on multiple forcings. Better knowledge of the factors controlling these concentrations is therefore a prerequisite to improve predictions of 137Cs transfers within river catchments. This study aimed at analyzing the spatial and temporal variability of 137Cs concentrations in rivers and identifying the key factors controlling their variability. Published values of 137Cs concentrations in rivers in the north of FDNPP were collected, characterizing 122 sampling sites from May 2011 to October 2014. It resulted in three datasets: dissolved concentrations CW (Bq/L), concentrations in suspended sediment CSS (Bq/kg) and total concentrations CT (Bq/L). The resulting database reflected a large variety of catchments and hydrological conditions. Observed 137Cs concentrations varied by 2-4 orders of magnitude and were poorly explained (R2 = 0.13-0.38) by the average contamination density. Indices summarizing the complex spatial and temporal properties of the catchments were proposed as candidate explanatory variables of concentrations in rivers. They were selected by stepwise regression for each dataset (CW, CSS, CT). For the three datasets, the selection and combination of 5-10 indices significantly better explained this variability (R2 = 0.69-0.83). Deposit indices were identified as first drivers of concentrations in rivers. A deposit index was selected for each dataset, indicating no effect of the contamination distribution for CW, whereas CT and CSS required considering the distribution of contamination and connectivity, as well as the presence of dams for CSS. The others selected variables significantly contributed to explain the concentration variability. This meta-analysis emphasizes the importance of structural (e.g. slope, land-cover) and functional (e.g. delay, season, rainfall) properties in the dissimilarities of catchments responses, stressing that assessments could be improved by including more these properties in models.
Low-energy collision-induced dissociation (CID) of deprotonated l-cysteine S-sulfate, [cysS-SO3]-, delivered in the gas phase by electrospray ionization, has been found to provide a means to form deprotonated l-cysteine sulfenic acid, which is a fleeting intermediate in biological media. The reaction mechanism underlying this process is the focus of the present contribution. At the same time, other novel species are formed, which were not observed in previous experiments. To understand fragmentation pathways of [cysS-SO3]-, reactive chemical dynamics simulations coupled with a novel algorithm for automatic determination of intermediates and transition states were performed. This approach has allowed the identification of the mechanisms involved and explained the experimental fragmentation pathways. Chemical dynamics simulations have shown that a roaming-like mechanism can be at the origin of l-cysteine sulfenic acid.
The human innate immune factor MxA represents an effective interspecies barrier for zoonotic influenza A viruses (IAVs) of animal origin. Accordingly, human but not avian IAVs efficiently escape the antiviral activity of MxA due to adaptive mutations in their viral nucleoprotein. Partial MxA resistance can be acquired in intermediate hosts such as swine, which possess an antivirally active Mx1 protein. Intriguingly, Mx1 of the bat Carollia perspicillata, a host of the recently discovered bat influenza A-like virus H18N11, is antivirally active against avian IAVs, thus raising the question whether H18N11 has undergone a preadaptation to human MxA. Here, by utilizing a chimeric bat influenza virus, PR8-H18N11, we demonstrate that MxA efficiently blocks viral replication in vitro as well as in MxA transgenic mice. Nevertheless, the H18N11 nucleoprotein exhibits partial MxA resistance in a polymerase reconstitution assay, suggesting that a certain degree of MxA preadaptation occurred. Together, our data indicate a currently reduced risk for H18N11 to overcome the human restriction factor MxA. Further adaptive mutations in NP are required to facilitate full MxA escape.
This study aims to screen the MSI detection loci suitable for the East Asian colorectal cancer patients. and explore its intratumoral heterogeneity.
A total of 271 pathological tissues specimens of colorectal cancer were collected. The MSI status was detected using different PCR reagent kits with different detection loci. Then, the results were compared with the immunohistochemical (IHC) staining results. Microdissection of pathological tissues specimens detected to be MSI-H was performed to examine whether there was intratumoral heterogeneity of MSI status.
Thirty-nine out of 271 cases were dMMR. dMMR occurred mostly in patients with right-hemi colon cancer (P &lt; 0.0001). Compared with dMMR patients, the clinical stages of pMMR patients were more inclined to be in the late stage with lymph node metastasis (P &lt; 0.0001). MSI-H tumors were significantly associated with KRAS mutation (P = 0.036) and PD-L1 expression (P = 0.038). Compared with Promega panel and 24-locus detection, the consistency between NCI MSI panel and IHC staining results were the highest with the Kappa value of 0.850. The sensitivity of detection decreased from 87.18% to 56.41% with the increase in detection loci. Single locus analysis showed that the first two loci with the highest sensitivity were both mononucleotide loci, namely, BAT-26 (95.45%) and BAT-25 (86.36%). The dinucleotide locus with highest sensitivity was D2S123 (50%). The main detection loci of MSI-H showed no intratumoral heterogeneity.
The combination of 2 mononucleotide loci (BAT25, BAT26) and 3 dinucleotide loci (D2S123, D5S346, D17S250) might be the most suitable loci for MSI detection in East Asian population. There is no intratumoral heterogeneity in the main MSI loci.
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) has been proposed as a target to treat obesity and metabolic disease. Currently, 18 F-Fluordeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is the standard for BAT-imaging. MRI might be a promising alternative, as it is not associated with ionizing radiation, offers a high resolution, and allows to discriminate different types of soft tissue.
We sought to evaluate whether supraclavicular BAT (scBAT) volume, fat-fraction (FF), and relaxation rate (R2*) determined by MRI can predict its metabolic activity, which was assessed by measurement of cold-induced thermogenesis (CIT).
Prospective cohort study.
Twenty healthy volunteers (9 female, 11 male), aged 18-47 years, with a body mass index (BMI) of 18-30 kg/m2 .
Multiecho gradient MRI for water-fat separation was used on a 3T device to measure the FF and T2 * of BAT.
Prior to imaging, CIT was determined by measuring the difference in energy expenditure (EE) during warm conditions and after cold exposure. Volume, FF, and R2* of scBAT was assessed and compared with CIT. In 11 participants, two MRI sessions with and without cold exposure were performed and the dynamic changes in FF and R2* assessed.
Linear regression was used to evaluate the relation of MRI measurements and CIT. P-values below 0.05 were considered significant; data are given as mean ± SD.
R2* correlated positively with CIT (r = 0.64, R2 = 0.41 P = 0.0041). Volume and FF did not correlate significantly with CIT. After mild cold exposure EE increased significantly (P = 0.0002), with a mean CIT of 147 kcal/day. The mean volume of scBAT was 72.4 ± 38.4 ml, mean FF was 74.3 ± 5.8%, and the mean R2* (1/T2 *) was 33.5 ± 12.7 s-1 .
R2* of human scBAT can be used to estimate CIT. FF of scBAT was not associated with CIT.

Animals can use inadvertent social information to improve fitness-relevant decisions, for instance about where to forage or with whom to interact. Since bats emit high-amplitude species-specific echolocation calls when flying, they provide a constant flow of inadvertent social information to others who can decode that acoustic information. Of particular interest is the rate of feeding buzzes-characteristic call sequences preceding any prey capture-which correlates with insect abundance. Previous studies investigating eavesdropping in bats yielded very different and in part contradictory results likely because they commonly focused on single species only, differed substantially in playback buzz rate and did usually not account for (baseline) conspecific activity. Our goal was to overcome these limitations and systematically test which inadvertent social information bats integrate when eavesdropping on others and how this integration affects space use and both intra- and interspecific interactions, respectively. We used a community-wide approach and investigated the effects of a broad range of playback feeding buzz rates and conspecific activity on eavesdropping responses in 24 bat species combinations in the wild. For the first time, we reveal that finely graded and density-dependent eavesdropping responses are not limited to particular foraging styles or call types, but instead are ubiquitous among insectivorous bats. All bats integrated social information about calling species identity, prey abundance and conspecific activity to estimate the cost-benefit ratio of prospective interactions, yet in a species-specific manner. The effect of buzz rate was multifaceted, as bats responded differently to different buzz rates, and responses were additionally modulated by heterospecific recognition. Conspecific activity, in contrast, had a negative effect on the eavesdropping responses of all bats. These findings can explain the inconsistent results of previous studies and advance our understanding of the complex nature of conspecific and heterospecific interactions within bat communities. A comprehensive understanding of how bats incorporate social information into their decision-making will help researchers to explain species distribution patterns and eventually to unravel mechanisms of species coexistence.
Tiere können Informationen nutzen, die von anderen Tiere unbeabsichtigt preisgegeben werden (sog. unbeabsichtigte soziale Informationen, engl.: inadvertent social information), um überlebenswichtige Entscheidungen zu treffen, z.B. darüber, wo es sich lohnt, nach Nahrung zu suchen oder mit wem es sich lohnt zu interagieren. Da Fledermäuse extrem laute, artspezifische Rufe aussenden, um im Flug zu navigieren und Beute zu jagen, bieten sie einen kontinuierlichen akustischen Strom an unbeabsichtigter sozialer Information an, der von anderen entschlüsselt werden kann. Besonders interessant für andere Fledermäuse sind die sog. ‚Fangrufe’ (engl.: feeding buzz) - charakteristische Ruffolgen, die jedem Beutefang vorausgehen und deren Häufigkeit mit der Insektenhäufigkeit korreliert. Frühere Studien, die die Verwendung von unbeabsichtigter sozialer Information unter Fledermäusen untersucht haben, kamen zu unterschiedlichen, teils gegensätzlichen Ergebnissen. Diese Heterogenität ist vermutlich dadurch verursacht, dass diese Studien meist nur einzelne Arten betrachteten, sich erheblich in der wiedergegebenen Fangruf-Häufigkeit unterschieden und die Ausgangs-Aktivität der jeweiligen Fledermausart meist nicht berücksichtigten. Unser Ziel war es, diese Limitierungen zu überwinden und systematisch zu testen, welche unbeabsichtigten sozialen Informationen Fledermäuse integrieren, wenn sie die Rufe anderer Fledermäuse hören. Weiterhin wollten wir feststellen, wie diese Integration die Raumnutzung der Fledermäuse und inner- als auch zwischenartliche Interaktionen beeinflusst. Dazu nutzten wir einen Forschungsansatz, der die gesamte Fledermaus-Artengemeinschaft miteinbezieht. Im Freiland untersuchten wir den Einfluss einer großen Bandbreite von Fangruf-Häufigkeiten und der Aktivität von Artgenossen auf die Reaktion von 24 Fledermausart-Kombinationen. Wir konnten zum ersten Mal zeigen, dass fein abgestimmte Verhaltensänderungen als Antwort auf die Rufe anderer Fledermäuse nicht auf einen bestimmten Jagd- oder Ruftyp beschränkt, sondern vielmehr weitverbreitet innerhalb der insektenfressenden Fledermäuse sind. Alle untersuchten Fledermäuse integrierten soziale Informationen über die Art der rufenden Fledermaus, über die Beutehäufigkeit und über die momentane Aktivität der Artgenossen in artspezifischer Art und Weise, um das Kosten-Nutzen-Verhältnis zukünftiger Interaktionen abzuschätzen. Der Effekt der widergegebenen Fangruf-Häufigkeit war sehr divers, da Fledermäuse unterschiedlich auf verschiedene Fangruf-Häufigkeiten reagierten und ihre Reaktionen zudem in Folge heterospezifischer Arterkennung angepasst haben. Die momentane Aktivität der Artgenossen hatte dagegen generell einen negativen Effekt auf das Lauschverhalten aller untersuchten Fledermausarten, so dass unsere Playbacks bei hoher natürlicher Aktivität der Artgenossen fast immer zu einer Abnahme der Aktivität führten. Unsere Erkenntnisse können die uneinheitlichen Ergebnisse früherer Studien erklären und erweitern unser Verständnis der komplexen inner- und zwischenartlichen Interaktionen innerhalb von Fledermausgemeinschaften. Ein umfassendes Wissen darüber, wie Fledermäuse soziale Informationen in ihre Entscheidungen miteinbeziehen, wird dazu beitragen, die Verbreitungsmuster von Arten zu erklären und Mechanismen der Koexistenz von Arten zu entschlüsseln.
White adipose tissue (WAT) is a central factor in the development of type 2 diabetes, but there is a paucity of translational models to study mature adipocytes. We describe a method for the culture of mature white adipocytes under a permeable membrane. Compared to existing culture methods, MAAC (membrane mature adipocyte aggregate cultures) better maintain adipogenic gene expression, do not dedifferentiate, display reduced hypoxia, and remain functional after long-term culture. Subcutaneous and visceral adipocytes cultured as MAAC retain depot-specific gene expression, and adipocytes from both lean and obese patients can be cultured. Importantly, we show that rosiglitazone treatment or PGC1α overexpression in mature white adipocytes induces a brown fat transcriptional program, providing direct evidence that human adipocytes can transdifferentiate into brown-like adipocytes. Together, these data show that MAAC are a versatile tool for studying phenotypic changes of mature adipocytes and provide an improved translational model for drug development.
This Review discusses the structure-property relationships in chiral molecules, macromolecules (polymers), and supramolecules (crystals, liquid crystals, or thin films) containing main-group elements. Chirality is a major property in our world, having a prominent influence on processes in biology, chemistry, and physics. Its impact in optics due to its interaction with electromagnetic waves gave rise to a multitude of effects, such as the Cotton effect and circularly polarized luminescence, making possible applications such as 3D displays and polarized sunglasses. Herein, a particular emphasis will be given to the influence of chirality on the conducting and optical properties of molecules or materials containing frontier heteroelements, particularly boron, silicon, phosphorus, and sulfur. These synergic materials are expected to become game-changers in the field of materials science by bringing new properties into the realm of reality, such as chirality-induced spin-selectivity, circularly polarized luminescence, and electrical magnetochiral anisotropy. This Review should be of interest for chemists and also physicists working in the fields of molecular and supramolecular chemistry, and molecular materials in the broadest sense.

                        Aims:
                     This study was designed to determine if vitamin D receptor (VDR), carrier globulin/binding protein (GC), and cytochrome P-450 family 2, subfamily R, polypeptide 1 (CYP2R1) gene polymorphisms are risk factors in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients from Northeast India. 
                        Materials and Methods:
                     A total of 351 HCV-infected patients were enrolled of which 167 were diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), 124 with liver cirrhosis (LC), and 60 with HCC together with 102 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. VDR (BsmI, ApaI, and TaqI), GC (rs4588, rs7051), and CYP2R1 (rs10741657) gene polymorphisms were genotyped for all subjects. Statistical data were analyzed using SPSS ver. 22.0. 
                        Results:
                     The frequency of the ApaI CC genotype, ApaI C allele, and bAt haplotype of the VDR gene was significantly higher in HCC and LC patients than controls. After adjusting for other covariates (age, gender, platelet count, AST, ALT, serum albumin, and viral load) logistic regression analysis showed that the ApaI CC genotype and bAt haplotype were independent predictors of HCC development. No significant associations was found for the GC and CYP2R1 polymorphisms examined with the occurrence of HCC. 
                        Conclusions:
                     The presence of the VDR ApaI CC genotype and bAt haplotype appear to be important indicators in the development of HCC among HCV-infected patients. Larger studies are needed to further clarify and establish this potential causal relationship.
Risk-based approaches to managing allergens in foods are being developed by the food industry and regulatory authorities to support food-allergic consumers to avoid ingestion of their problem food, especially in relation to the traces of unintended allergens. The application of such approaches requires access to good quality data from clinical studies to support identification of levels of allergens in foods that are generally safe for most food-allergic consumers as well as analytical tools that are able to quantify allergenic food protein. The ThRAll project aims to support the application of risk-based approaches to food-allergen management in two ways. First, a harmonized quantitative MS-based prototype reference method will be developed for the detection of multiple food allergens in standardized incurred food matrices. This will be undertaken for cow's milk, hen's egg, peanut, soybean, hazelnut, and almond incurred into two highly processed food matrices, chocolate and broth powder. This activity is complemented by a second objective to support the development and curation of data on oral food challenges, which are used to define thresholds and minimum eliciting doses. This will be achieved through the development of common protocols for collection and curation of data that will be applied to allergenic foods for which there are currently data gaps.
Brown adipose tissue (BAT), an organ that burns energy through uncoupling thermogenesis, is a promising therapeutic target for obesity. However, there are still no safe anti-obesity drugs that target BAT in the market. In the current study, we performed large scale screening of 636 compounds which were approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to find drugs that could significantly increase uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) mRNA expression by real-time PCR. Among those UCP1 activators, most of them were antibiotics or carcinogenic compounds. We paid particular attention to fluvastatin sodium (FS), because as an inhibitor of the cellular hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, FS has already been approved for treatment of hypercholesteremia. We found that in the cellular levels, FS treatment significantly increased UCP1 expression and BAT activity in human brown adipocytes. Consistently, the expression of oxidative phosphorylation-related genes was significantly increased upon FS treatment without differences in adipogenic gene expression. Furthermore, FS treatment resisted to high-fat diet (HFD)-induced body weight gain by activating BAT in the mice model. In addition, administration of FS significantly increased energy expenditure, improved glucose homeostasis and ameliorated hepatic steatosis. Furthermore, we reveal that FS induced browning in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT) known to have a beneficial effect on energy metabolism. Taken together, our results clearly demonstrate that as an effective BAT activator, FS may have great potential for treatment of obesity and related metabolic disorders.
Obesity is a major risk for diabetes. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) mediates production of heat while white adipose tissue (WAT) function in the storage of fat. Roles of BAT in the treatment of obesity and related disorders warrants more investigation. Peroxisome proliferator activator receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) is the master regulator of both BAT and WAT adipogenesis and has roles in glucose and fatty acid metabolism. Adipose tissue is the major expression site for PPAR-γ. In this study, the effects of rosiglitazone on the brown adipogenesis and the association of MAPK and PI3K pathways was investigated during the in vitro adipogenic differentiation of telomerase transformed mesenchymal stromal cells (iMSCs). Our data indicate that 2 µM rosiglitazone enhanced adipogenesis by over-expression of PPAR-γ and C/EBP-α. More specifically, brown adipogenesis was enhanced by the upregulation of EBF2 and UCP-1 and evidenced by multilocular fatty droplets morphology of the differentiated adipocytes. We also found that rosiglitazone significantly activated MAPK and PI3K pathways at the maturation stage of differentiation. Overall, the results indicate that rosiglitazone induced overexpression of PPAR-γ that in turn enhanced adipogenesis, particularly browning adipogenesis. This study reports the browning effects of rosiglitazone during the differentiation of iMSCs into adipocytes in association with the activation of MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways.
Argon microbubbles will exist in the primary sodium of the next generation of sodium-cooled fast reactors (SFR). Due to its opacity, acoustic methods will be used for the in-service inspection in these reactors, but the presence of such bubbles will greatly affect ultrasonic wave propagation. Moreover, these bubbles can lead to the formation of gas pockets in the reactor and impact cavitation and boiling phenomena. It is therefore necessary to characterise what is called the 'microbubble cloud' by providing the volume fraction and the bubble size distribution. Safety requirements in this field call for robust inspection methods based on very few assumptions about the bubble populations. The objective of this study is to assess the performance of spectroscopic methods in the presence of bubbles with high polydispersity and to monitor an evolving cloud of microbubbles. The histogram and void fractions were estimated according to the regularised inversion of the complex wave number's integral equation. To reduce the need for prior information on the bubble cloud, a specific procedure was used to estimate the maximum radius of the population. The results are presented on the basis of the experimental data obtained and then compared with optical measurements.
The development and expansion of wind energy is considered a key global threat to bat populations. Bat carcasses are being found underneath wind turbines across North and South America, Eurasia, Africa, and the Austro-Pacific. However, relatively little is known about the comparative impacts of techniques designed to modify turbine operations in ways that reduce bat fatalities associated with wind energy facilities. This study tests a novel approach for reducing bat fatalities and curtailment time at a wind energy facility in the United States, then compares these results to operational mitigation techniques used at other study sites in North America and Europe. The study was conducted in Wisconsin during 2015 using a new system of tools for analyzing bat activity and wind speed data to make near real-time curtailment decisions when bats are detected in the area at control turbines (N = 10) vs. treatment turbines (N = 10). The results show that this smart curtailment approach (referred to as Turbine Integrated Mortality Reduction, TIMR) significantly reduced fatality estimates for treatment turbines relative to control turbines for pooled species data, and for each of five species observed at the study site: pooled data (-84.5%); eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis, -82.5%); hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus, -81.4%); silver-haired bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans, -90.9%); big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus, -74.2%); and little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus, -91.4%). The approach reduced power generation and estimated annual revenue at the wind energy facility by ≤ 3.2% for treatment turbines relative to control turbines, and we estimate that the approach would have reduced curtailment time by 48% relative to turbines operated under a standard curtailment rule used in North America. This approach significantly reduced fatalities associated with all species evaluated, each of which has broad distributions in North America and different ecological affinities, several of which represent species most affected by wind development in North America. While we recognize that this approach needs to be validated in other areas experiencing rapid wind energy development, we anticipate that this approach has the potential to significantly reduce bat fatalities in other ecoregions and with other bat species assemblages in North America and beyond.
Gramicidin S (GS), one of the oldest commercially used peptide antibiotics, is known for its robust antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. Although it was discovered well over 70 years ago, its clinical potential was limited to topical applications because of its high hemolytic activity. To overcome this side effect, significant efforts have been invested in the chase for GS analogues with high therapeutic index (e.g., high antimicrobial activity and low hemolytic activity) in the past decades. In this Perspective, the structural properties and biological profiles (including the recently discovered activities) of representative GS analogues designed by different approaches are described and analyzed. We also present how the general structure-activity relationships were established and how they could help in the design of more efficient GS analogues.
Bats are an ecologically and taxonomically diverse group accounting for roughly a fifth of mammalian diversity worldwide. Many of the threats bats face (e.g., habitat loss, bushmeat hunting, and climate change) reflect the conservation challenges of our era. However, compared to other mammals and birds, we know significantly less about the population status of most bat species, which makes prioritizing and planning conservation actions challenging. Over a third of bat species assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) are considered threatened or data deficient, and well over half of the species have unknown or decreasing population trends. That equals 988 species, or 80% of bats assessed by IUCN, needing conservation or research attention. Delivering conservation to bat species will require sustained efforts to assess population status and trends and address data deficiencies. Successful bat conservation must integrate research and conservation to identify stressors and their solutions and to test the efficacy of actions to stabilize or increase populations. Global and regional networks that connect researchers, conservation practitioners, and local stakeholders to share knowledge, build capacity, and prioritize and coordinate research and conservation efforts, are vital to ensuring sustainable bat populations worldwide.
Bats, the second-largest mammalian order, are widely distributed and provide crucial ecosystem services. Their reproductive biology comprises noteworthy characteristics, such as long-term sperm storage, delayed implantation or even delayed fetal development. The understanding of these mechanisms remains limited. Research in reproductive biology may become crucial for the conservation of endangered bat species. Indeed, the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species currently lists 76 bat species as endangered or critically endangered, for which conservation measures should be taken. The development of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) in bats would thus open new perspectives. In this context we here describe the first successful cryopreservation of bat sperm in the Seba's short-tailed bat (Carollia perspicillata). Epididymal sperm of 30 males was pooled in 6 sample sets and diluted using four different cryo-diluents: Canifreeze, modified Canifreeze, BotuCrio® and Test egg yolk extender. Glycerol and a mixture of glycerol and methylformamide were used as cryoprotectants. Best post-thaw results were achieved when sperm was diluted in Test egg yolk extender containing a mixture of glycerol and methylformamide as cryoprotectant. Post-thaw sperm motility, progressive motility and acrosome integrity of 42.0 ± 3.4%, 28.3 ± 6.3% and 87.7 ± 1.7%, respectively were superior to all other variants tested. It remains to be determined if the post-thaw quality of cryopreserved bat spermatozoa achieved in this study is sufficient for the use in artificial inseminations and produces acceptable pregnancy rates. Successful cryopreservation of spermatozoa in C. perspicillata may serve as the first model to establish gamete rescue programs and develop ART in other, critically endangered bat species.
A search for heavy, narrow resonances decaying to a Higgs boson and a photon (Hγ) has been performed in proton-proton collision data at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9  fb^{-1} collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016. Events containing a photon and a Lorentz-boosted hadronically decaying Higgs boson reconstructed as a single, large-radius jet are considered, and the γ+jet invariant mass spectrum is analyzed for the presence of narrow resonances. To increase the sensitivity of the search, events are categorized depending on whether or not the large-radius jet can be identified as a result of the merging of two jets originating from b quarks. Results in both categories are found to agree with the predictions of the standard model. Upper limits on the production rate of Hγ resonances are set as a function of their mass in the range of 720-3250 GeV, representing the most stringent constraints to date.
Sleep apnea elicits brain and physiological changes and its duration varies across the night. This study investigates the changes in the relative powers in electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency bands before and at apnea termination and as a function of apnea duration. The analysis was performed on 30 sleep records (375 apnea events) of older adults diagnosed with sleep apnea. Power spectral analysis centered on two 10-s EEG epochs, before apnea termination (BAT) and after apnea termination (AAT), for each apnea event. The relative power changes in EEG frequency bands were compared with changes in apnea duration, defined as Short (between 10 and 20 s), Moderate (between 20 and 30 s) and Long (between 30 and 40 s). A significant reduction in EEG relative powers for lower frequency bands of alpha and sigma were observed for the Long compared to the Moderate and Short apnea duration groups at BAT, and reduction in relative theta, alpha and sigma powers for the Long compared to the Moderate and Short groups at AAT. The proportion of apnea events showed a significantly decreased trend with increased apnea duration for non-rapid eye movement sleep but not rapid eye movement sleep. The proportion of central apnea events decreased with increased apnea duration, but not obstructive episodes. The findings suggest EEG arousal occurred both before and at apnea termination and these transient arousals were associated with a reduction in relative EEG powers of the low-frequency bands: theta, alpha and sigma. The clinical implication is that these transient EEG arousals, without awakenings, are protective of sleep. Further studies with large datasets and different age groups are recommended.
The ability of bats to act as reservoir for viruses that are highly pathogenic to humans suggests unique properties and functional characteristics of their immune system. However, the lack of bat specific reagents, in particular antibodies, has limited our knowledge of bat's immunity. Here, we report a panel of cross-reactive antibodies against MHC-II, NK1.1, CD3, CD21, CD27, and immunoglobulin (Ig), that allows flow cytometry analysis of B, T and NK cell populations in two different fruit-eating bat species namely, Pteropus alecto and E. spelaea. Results confirmed predominance of T cells in the spleen and blood of bats, as previously reported by us. However, the percentages of B cells in bone marrow and NK cells in spleen varied greatly between wild caught P. alecto bats and E. spelaea colony bats, which may reflect inherent differences of their immune system or different immune status. Other features of bat B cells were investigated. A significant increase in sIg+ B cell population was observed in the spleen and blood from LPS-injected bats but not from poly I:C-injected bats, supporting T-independent polyclonal B cell activation by LPS. Furthermore, using an in vitro calcium release assay, P. alecto B cells exhibited significant calcium release upon cross-linking of their B cell receptor. Together, this work contributes to improve our knowledge of bat adaptive immunity in particular B cells.
A comment on D'Auria E., De Amici M., Licari A., Caimmi S., Mantegazza C., Zuccotti G. and Marseglia G., Basophil activation test in children with autoimmune chronic spontaneous urticaria: Iis it ready for clinical practice?, Immunobiology 224 (1), 2019, 30-33.
Fat-specific protein 27 (FSP27) α is the major isoform of FSP27 in white adipose tissue (WAT), and is essential for large unilocular lipid droplet (LD) formation in white adipocytes. In contrast, FSP27β is abundantly expressed in brown adipose tissue (BAT), and plays an important role in small multilocular LD formation. In FSP27 KO mice in which FSP27α and β are both depleted, WAT is characterized by multilocular LD formation, and by increased mitochondrial abundance and energy expenditure, whereas BAT conversely manifests large oligolocular LDs and reduced energy expenditure.
We investigated the effects of autophagy in WAT and BAT of wild type (WT) and FSP27 knockout (KO) mice. In addition, we examined the effects of FSP27α and FSP27β to the induction of autophagy in COS cells.
Food deprivation induced autophagy in BAT of WT mice, as well as in WAT of FSP27 KO mice, suggesting that enhanced autophagy is characteristic of adipocytes with small multilocular LDs. Pharmacological inhibition of autophagy attenuated the fasting-induced loss of LD area in adipocytes with small multilocular LDs (BAT of WT mice and WAT of FSP27 KO mice), without affecting that in adipocytes with large unilocular or oligolocular LDs (WAT of WT mice or in BAT of FSP27 KO mice). Overexpression of FSP27α inhibited autophagy induction by serum deprivation in COS cells, whereas that of FSP27β had no such effect.
The present results thus showed that FSP27α inhibits autophagy and might thereby contribute to the energy-storage function of WAT.
This study aimed to develop a novel therapeutic vaccine based on a unique B cell epitope and investigate its therapeutic potential against chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in animal models.
A series of peptides and carrier proteins were evaluated in HBV-tolerant mice to obtain an optimised therapeutic molecule. The immunogenicity, therapeutic efficacy and mechanism of the candidate were investigated systematically.
Among the HBsAg-aa119-125-containing peptides evaluated in this study, HBsAg-aa113-135 (SEQ13) exhibited the most striking therapeutic effects. A novel immunoenhanced virus-like particle carrier (CR-T3) derived from the roundleaf bat HBV core antigen (RBHBcAg) was created and used to display SEQ13, forming candidate molecule CR-T3-SEQ13. Multiple copies of SEQ13 displayed on the surface of this particulate antigen promote the induction of a potent anti-HBs antibody response in mice, rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys. Sera and purified polyclonal IgG from the immunised animals neutralised HBV infection in vitro and mediated efficient HBV/hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) clearance in the mice. CR-T3-SEQ13-based vaccination induced long-term suppression of HBsAg and HBV DNA in HBV transgenic mice and eradicated the virus completely in hydrodynamic-based HBV carrier mice. The suppressive effects on HBsAg were strongly correlated with the anti-HBs level after vaccination, suggesting that the main mechanism of CR-T3-SEQ13 vaccination therapy was the induction of a SEQ13-specific antibody response that mediated HBV/HBsAg clearance.
The novel particulate protein CR-T3-SEQ13 suppressed HBsAg effectively through induction of a humoural immune response in HBV-tolerant mice. This B cell epitope-based therapeutic vaccine may provide a novel immunotherapeutic agent against chronic HBV infection in humans.
Genetic and epigenetic variations are commonly known to underlie phenotypic plastic responses to environmental cues. However, the role of epigenetic variation in plastic responses harboring ecological significance in nature remains to be assessed. The shade avoidance response (SAR) of plants is one of the most prevalent examples of phenotypic plasticity. It is a phenotypic syndrome including stem elongation and multiple other traits. Its ecological significance is widely acknowledged, and it can be adaptive in the presence of competition for light. Underlying genes and pathways were identified, but evidence for its epigenetic basis remains scarce. We used a proven and accessible approach at the population level and compared global DNA methylation between plants exposed to regular light and three different magnitudes of shade in seven highly inbred lines of snapdragon plants (Antirrhinum majus) grown in a greenhouse. Our results brought evidence of a strong SAR syndrome for which magnitude did not vary between lines. They also brought evidence that its magnitude was not associated with the global DNA methylation percentage for five of the six traits under study. The magnitude of stem elongation was significantly associated with global DNA demethylation. We discuss the limits of this approach and why caution must be taken with such results. In-depth approaches at the DNA sequence level will be necessary to better understand the molecular basis of the SAR syndrome.
Bone can adapt to its habitual load history at various levels of its hierarchical structural and material organization. However, it is unclear how strongly a bone's structural characteristics (e.g. cross-sectional shape) are linked to microstructural characteristics (e.g. distributions of osteons and their vascular canals) or ultrastructural characteristics [e.g. patterns of predominant collagen fiber orientation (CFO)]. We compared the cross-sectional geometry, microstructure and ultrastructure of pigeon (Columba livia domestica) humeri, and third metacarpals (B3M) and humeri of a large bat (Pteropus poliocephalus). The pigeon humerus is habitually torsionally loaded, and has unremodeled ('primary') bone with vessels (secondary osteons are absent) and high 'laminarity' because a large majority of these vessels course circularly with respect to the bone's external surface. In vivo data show that the bat humerus is also habitually torsionally loaded; this contrasts with habitual single-plane bending of the B3M, where in vivo data show that it oscillates back and forth in the same direction. In contrast to pigeon humeri where laminar bone is present, the primary tissue of these bat bones is largely avascular, but secondary osteons are present and are usually in the deeper cortex. Nevertheless, the load history of humeri of both species is prevalent/predominant torsion, producing diffusely distributed shear stresses throughout the cross-section. We tested the hypothesis that despite microstructural/osteonal differences in these pigeon and bat bones, they will have similar characteristics at the ultrastructural level that adapt each bone for its load history. We postulate that predominant CFO is this characteristic. However, even though data reported in prior studies of bones of non-flying mammals suggest that CFO would show regional variations in accordance with the habitual 'tension regions' and 'compression regions' in the direction of unidirectional habitual bending, we hypothesized that alternating directions of bending within the same plane would obviate these regional/site-specific adaptations in the B3M. Similarly, but for other reasons, we did not expect regional variations in CFO in the habitually torsionally loaded bat and pigeon humeri because uniformly oblique-to-transverse CFO is the adaptation expected for the diffusely distributed shear stresses produced by torsion/multidirectional loads. We analyzed transverse sections from mid-diaphyses of adult bones for CFO, secondary osteon characteristics (size, shape and population density), cortical thickness in quadrants of the cortex, and additional measures of cross-sectional geometry, including the degree of circular shape that can help distinguish habitual torsion from bending. Results showed the expected lack of regional CFO differences in quasi-circular shaped, and torsionally loaded, pigeon and bat humeri. As expected, the B3M also lacked CFO variations between the opposing cortices along the plane of bending, and the quasi-elliptical cross-sectional shape and regional microstructural/osteonal variations expected for bending were not found. These findings in the B3M show that uniformity in CFO does not always reflect habitual torsional loads. Osteon morphology and distribution, and presence of laminar histology also do not distinguish torsion from bending in these bat and pigeon wing bones.
The involvement of different parameters on Gibberella zeae lipase (GZEL) membrane binding were characterized by using monomolecular film technology and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Among four kinds of phospholipid monolayers, 1,2‑dimyristoyl‑sn‑glycero‑3‑phosphoethanolamine have the highest maximum insertion pressure (MIP) value. Comparing the GZEL adsorption to phosphatidylcholine monolayers with different acyl chains in sn-1 and sn-2 positions, the higher MIP values were found for 1,2‑dilauroyl‑sn‑glycero‑3‑phosphocholine. Significantly improvement between 1,2‑dioleoyl‑sn‑glycero‑3‑phosphocholine and 1,2‑distearoyl‑sn‑glycero‑3‑phosphocholine suggested that the presence of fatty acid unsaturation may affect protein adsorption by changing the chemical structure in each phospholipid. The MIP value was shown higher (48.6 mN m-1) at pH 5 and pH 6 (47.5 ± 1.9 mN m-1) but decreased significantly (34.2 mN m-1) at pH 9. This may indicate that the proportion of helices in the protein decreases with the alteration of the catalytic center, thus affecting the binding of the protein to its substrate. The MIP values obviously decreased with increasing salt ion concentration, suggesting that excessive salt ion concentration may destabilize the secondary and tertiary structures of the protein, thereby affecting the characteristics of its adsorption at the interfaces. Present studies improve our understanding on the protein-membrane interaction of this enzyme.
During mammalian pregnancy and lactation, the maternal demand for calcium is increased to satisfy fetus and newborn skeletal growth. In addition to the dietary intake, females use the calcium contained in their bones to supply this increased demand, leading to a decrease in maternal bone mineral content. In reproductive insectivorous female bats, bone loss has been described as a physiological cost of reproduction, due to the reported increased risk of bone fracture. This physiological cost may be the mechanism underlying the conflict between increasing litter size and maintaining wing skeletal integrity, which would help to explain the small litter size of most bat species. If bone loss is a linking cost between reproduction and survival in bats, and most bat species have small litter sizes, one would expect to find a loss of bone and an increasing probability of bone fracture during pregnancy and lactation in other non-insectivorous bats. In this study, we tested for the existence of this cost in the Great-fruit eating bat, Artibeus lituratus. We analyzed trabecular structure, bone strength and bone mineral content for the humerus bone, hypothesizing that bone loss during reproduction in females would increase the risk of fracture. Our results showed a decrease of 22-31% in bone trabecular area in lactating females, rapidly compensated following weaning. Bone strength did not differ among reproductive and non-reproductive groups and seems to be more influenced by bone organic components rather than mineral contents. Since we observed bone loss during reproduction yet the humerus strength seems to be unaffected, we suggest that bone loss may not represent a physiological cost during reproduction for this frugivorous bat.
Age-related increased adiposity is an important contributory factor in the development of insulin resistance (IR) and is associated with metabolic defects. Caloric restriction (CR) is known to induce weight loss and to decrease adiposity while preventing metabolic risk factors. Here, we show that moderate 20% CR delays early deleterious effects of aging on white and brown adipose tissue (WAT and BAT, respectively) function and improves peripheral IR. To elucidate the role of CR in delaying early signs of aging, young (3 months), middle-aged (12 months), and old (20 months) mice fed al libitum and middle-aged and old mice subjected to early-onset CR were used. We show that impaired plasticity of subcutaneous WAT (scWAT) contributes to IR, which is already evident in middle-aged mice. Moreover, alteration of thyroid axis status with age is an important factor contributing to BAT dysfunction in middle-aged animals. Both defects in WAT and BAT/beige cells are ameliorated by CR. Accordingly, CR attenuated the age-related decline in scWAT function and decreased the extent of fibro-inflammation. Furthermore, CR promoted scWAT browning. In brief, our study identifies the contribution of scWAT impairment to age-associated metabolic dysfunction and identifies browning in response to food restriction, as a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent the adverse metabolic effects in middle-aged animals.
[11C]-acetate positron emission tomography is used to assess oxidative metabolism in various tissues including the heart, tumor, and brown adipose tissue. For brown adipose tissue, a monoexponential decay model is commonly employed. However, no systematic assessment of kinetic models has been performed to validate this model or others. The monoexponential decay model and various compartmental models were applied to data obtained before and during brown adipose tissue activation by cold exposure in healthy men. Quality of fit was assessed visually and by analysis of residuals, including the Akaike information criterion. Stability and accuracy of compartmental models were further assessed through simulations, along with sensitivity and identifiability of kinetic parameters.
Differences were noted in the arterial input function between the warm and cold conditions. These differences are not taken into account by the monoexponential decay model. They are accounted for by compartmental models, but most models proved too complex to be stable. Two and three-tissue models with no more than four distinct kinetic parameters, including blood volume fraction, provided the best compromise between fit quality and stability/accuracy.
For healthy men, a three-tissue model with four kinetic parameters, similar to a heart [11C]-palmitate model seems the most appropriate based on model stability and its ability to describe the main [11C]-acetate pathways in BAT cells. Further studies are required to validate this model in women and people with metabolic disorders.
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays a role in energy expenditure and is involved in nutrient metabolism. C-X-C chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12)-CXCR4 pathway regulates the immune, nervous, and cardiovascular systems and affects the adipose tissue. Here, we investigated the role of this pathway as an activator of BAT. Uncoupling protein 1 mRNA and protein levels and oxygen consumption increased in the brown adipocytes treated with 100 nM CXCL12 peptide. CXCL12-mediated upregulation in P38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) levels was reduced by each inhibitor. Thus, the CXCL12-CXCR4 pathway activated the brown adipocytes through P38 and ERK that acted downstream of this pathway. Mice with CXCR4 defects only in the brown adipocytes were generated and fed with high-fat diet (HFD). Body weight and blood glucose after glucose injection increased in these mice. Long-term exposure to HFD deteriorated blood glucose level after glucose injection. Insulin sensitivity was exacerbated in the knockout mice fed with HFD. Serum lipid parameters and CXCL12 level in knockout mice were similar to those in control mice. These results suggest that the CXCL12-CXCR4 pathway induces brown adipocyte activity and affects nutrient metabolism under HFD load.
Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a member of the FGF subfamily that acts through the FGF receptor 1 with the co-receptor β-Klotho, functions as an important metabolic regulator of peripheral glucose tolerance and lipid homeostasis in an endocrine or autocrine and/or paracrine manner. Previous studies showed that FGF21 ameliorated and prevented the development of metabolic disorders, such as obesity and diabetes mellitus. In the present study, we demonstrated that berberine, a naturally occurring compound, stimulated FGF21 expression in brown adipose tissue (BAT). Furthermore, the up-regulated expression of FGF21 in brown adipocytes in response to berberine was due, at least in part, to the activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase pathway. We also found that berberine reversed high-fat diet-induced obesity concomitant with its regulation of the expression of Fgf21 and the core clock component brain and muscle Arnt-like 1 (Bmal1) in BAT. Berberine significantly up-regulated the gene expression and production of FGF21 in a dose-dependent manner in C3H10T1/2 brown adipocytes. Furthermore, the knockdown of Bmal1 prevented the up-regulated expression of FGF21 in response to berberine in C3H10T1/2 brown adipocytes, suggesting that Bmal1 links the regulatory mechanisms of FGF21 in response to berberine. The present results suggest that berberine stimulates the expression of FGF21 by modulating molecular clock Bmal1 in BAT, which may, in turn, attenuate diet-induced obesity. They also indicate the potential of berberine as a therapeutic agent for obesity and obesity-associated metabolic disorders related to circadian misalignments.
Rabies is a fatal zoonotic disease that causes a heavy burden on societies. Namibia, a country in southern Africa, is aiming at controlling the disease in its main reservoir, the domestic dog. To facilitate the implementation comprehensive information on the ecology and epidemiology of the disease and surveillance is of utmost importance. The study presented assesses the baseline data for both human and animal rabies surveillance in Namibia in recent times and establishes correlations with ecological and socio-economic data in order to provide an up-to-date picture on the epidemiology of rabies in Namibia. For instance, it was important to identify the main drivers in the epidemiology, and whether the control strategy by mass vaccination of dogs is undermined by cycles of rabies in wildlife. Rabies in humans was reported mainly from the Northern Communal Areas (NCAs), with a total of 113 cases from 2011 to 2017, representing an incidence of between 1.0 and 2.4 annual human rabies deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. Kavango, the region with the highest human rabies incidence was also the region with the lowest animal rabies surveillance intensity. Generally, the vast majority (77%) of dog samples originated from communal farm land, followed by urban areas (17%), while only a small fraction (3%) was submitted from freehold farm areas. In contrast, kudu and eland submissions were almost exclusively from freehold farmland (76%) and urban areas (19%), whereas the submission of cattle samples was evenly distributed among freehold farms (46%) and communal farm land (46%). The likelihood of sample submission decreased exponentially with distance to one of the two laboratories. Overall, 67% (N = 1,907) of all samples submitted tested rabies-positive, with the highest positivity rate observed in kudus (89%) and jackals (87%). The transmission cycle of rabies in dogs appears restricted to the northern communal areas of Namibia, whilst rabies in wildlife species is predominately reported from farmland in central Namibia, mostly affecting kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) and livestock with a likely reservoir in wildlife canids such as jackals or bat-eared foxes. The analysis confirms the presence of two independent transmission cycles in Namibia with little geographic overlap, thus allowing for a sustainable control of rabies in dogs in the NCAs.
With a continuous increase in the approval of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED), not only pacemakers (PM) and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) but especially devices for treating chronic heart failure, more and more possibilities of device-device interactions arise, which in isolated cases can lead to death of the patient. Because of the still low numbers of patients overall, there are very few scientific studies and only isolated case reports on this topic. Devices which are at risk of interaction with a previously implanted PM are wearable cardioverter defibrillators (WCD) and subcutaneous ICDs (S-ICD). These two devices both use the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) in their algorithm for detecting ventricular arrhythmia. These surface ECGs seem to be prone to unipolar pacemaker stimulation artefacts. By correct programming of implanted pacemakers in the bipolar stimulation mode it is possible to avoid ECG artefacts and inadequate treatment. In baroreceptor activation therapy (BAT) there seem to be no device interactions so far, even though this device shows substantial highly frequent artefacts in the ECG. The cardiac contractility modulation (CCM) system has also until now not shown interactions with transvenous or subcutaneous ICD devices, even though randomized trials are missing.
To analyze epidemiological and anthropometric features of patients with brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation detected by fluorine18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT).
From 2005 to 2017, 818 18F-FDG PET/CT studies positive for BAT detection were retrospectively included, 742 examinations performed on the adult population and 76 PET/CT on the pediatric population. A Chi-squared test was performed to compare features distribution between the adult and pediatric patients.
Adults showed a higher rate of BAT detection in females (79% vs. 61%, P&lt;0.001) and in hyperglycaemic patients (&gt;100mg/dL) (24% vs. 16%, P=0.02), no significant difference was found with regard to overweight patients (BMI&gt;25kg/m2) (22% vs. 20%, P=.55). Considering females only, the adults showed a higher rate of BAT detection both in hyperglycaemic (83% vs. 42%, P&lt;0.001) and overweight patients (80% vs. 67%, P=0.005). In both populations BAT activation happened more frequently in cold seasons; there was no significant distribution difference with regard to season of birth (P=0.2).
Sex, glycemia and BMI play a major role in predicting BAT activation, with significant differences between adults and pediatric patients. Cold exposure is confirmed as an important predicting factor, while season of birth is not significant.
In endothermic animals, brown adipose tissue (BAT) is activated to produce heat for defending body temperature in response to cold. BAT's ability to expend energy has made it a potential target for novel therapies to ameliorate obesity and associated metabolic disorders in humans. Though this tissue has been well studied in small animals, BAT's thermogenic capacity in humans remains largely unknown due to the difficulties of measuring its volume, activity, and distribution. Identifying and quantifying active human BAT is commonly performed using 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) scans following cold-exposure or pharmacological activation. Here we describe a detailed image-analysis approach to quantify total-body human BAT from 18F-FDG PET/CT scans using an open-source software. We demonstrate the drawing of user-specified regions of interest to identify metabolically active adipose tissue while avoiding common non-BAT tissues, to measure BAT volume and activity, and to further characterize its anatomical distribution. Although this rigorous approach is time-consuming, we believe it will ultimately provide a foundation to develop future automated BAT quantification algorithms.
Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV) are closely related members within the genus Henipavirus, family Paramyxoviridae, for which fruit bats serve as the reservoir. The initial emergence of NiV infections in pigs and humans in Malaysia, and HeV infections in horses and humans in Australia, posed severe impacts on human and animal health, and continues threatening lives of humans and livestock within Southeast Asia and Australia. Recently, henipavirus-specific antibodies have also been detected in fruit bats in a number of sub-Saharan African countries and in Brazil, thereby considerably increasing the known geographic distribution of henipaviruses. Africa is progressively being recognized as a new high prevalence zone for henipaviruses, as deduced from serological and molecular evidence of past infections in Madagascar, Ghana, Republic of Congo, Gulf of Guinea, Zambia, Tanzania, Cameroon, and Nigeria lately. Serological data suggest henipavirus spillover from bats to livestock and human populations in Africa without reported clinical disease in any of these species. All virus isolation attempts have been abortive, highlighting the need for further investigations. The genome of the Ghanaian bat henipavirus designated Ghana virus (GhV), which was detected in a pteropid Eidolon helvum bat, is the only African henipavirus that has been completely sequenced limiting our current knowledge on the genetic diversity and pathogenesis of African henipaviruses. In this review, we summarize the available data on the circulation of henipaviruses in Africa, discuss potential sources for virus spillover, and highlight existing research gaps.
Risk of zoonoses by animal bites and scratches. The objectives of this study are to identify zoonosis risks related to animal bites and scratches in France. Pet-transmitted zoonoses, as pasteurellosis, cat scratches disease and various specific bacterial infections, are predominant, resulting usually in localized infections or, sometimes, in serious systemic infections (as those caused by Capnocytophaga canimorsus) in immunocompromised patients. On the other hand, the rat bite fever due to Strepto bacillus monoliformis is rarely diagnosed in humans. Because the France is a country free from rabies in non-flying mammals, exposure risk is limited to patients in contact with animals (predominantly non-vaccinated dogs or cats) illicitly imported from rabies enzootic areas. But, population may be exposed to infections by lyssaviruses isolated from bats, as European bat lyssaviruses type 1 (EBLV-1) transmitted by serotine bats (happily insectivorous and having little contact with humans), and more seriously in French Guyana, rabies virus transmitted by vampire bats. Lastly, exposure risk to Asian macaque monkeys infected by herpesvirus B present in some zoological parks in France is negligible for general population.
Risque de zoonoses par morsures et griffures animales. Les objectifs de cet article sont d’identifier les risques zoonotiques associés à des morsures et griffures animales en France. Les zoonoses transmises par des animaux de compagnie, comme la pasteurellose d’inoculation, la maladie des griffes du chat et diverses infections bactériennes spécifiques sont prédominantes, provoquant habituellement des infections localisées, parfois des infections systémiques sévères (comme celles causées par Capnocytophaga canimorsus) chez des patients immunodéprimés. En revanche, la « fièvre de la morsure du rat » due à Streptobacillus monoliformis est rarement diagnostiquée chez les humains. La France étant indemne de rage des mammifères non volants, le risque d’exposition est limité à des contacts avec des animaux (surtout des chiens et des chats non vaccinés) illicitement introduits de zones d’enzootie rabique. La population reste néanmoins exposée à des infections par des lyssavirus isolés chez des chiroptères, comme le lyssavirus de la chauve-souris européenne de type 1 (EBLV-1) transmis par des sérotines (heureusement insectivores et n’ayant que peu de contact avec l’homme) et, plus gravement en Guyane, le virus rabique transmis par des chauves-souris vampires.Enfin, le risque d’exposition à des singes macaques asiatiques infectés par l’herpèsvirus B découverts dans certains parcs zoologiques en France peut être qualifié de négligeable pour la population générale.
To determine whether brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity in school-age children differs between the sexes and to explore the impact of dietary intake, sedentary behavior, and picky/fussy eating.
Children aged 8.5-11.8 years of age (n = 36) underwent infrared thermography to determine the temperature of the skin overlying the main superficial BAT depot in the supraclavicular region before and after 5 minutes of mild cold exposure (single-hand immersion in cool tap water at about 20°C). The relationships between the supraclavicular region temperature and parental reports of food consumption, eating behavior, and inactivity were explored.
The supraclavicular region temperature was higher in boys (n = 16) at baseline, and after cold exposure. Boys displayed a greater thermogenic response to cold. Strong negative correlations were observed between the supraclavicular region temperature and body mass index percentile, and differences in supraclavicular region temperature between girls and boys persisted after adjustment for body mass index percentile. A negative linear relationship was observed between protein and vegetable intake and supraclavicular region temperature in girls only, but did not persist after adjustment for multiple comparisons. There was no difference in the adjusted supraclavicular region temperature between active or inactive children, or picky and nonpicky eaters.
These findings indicate sexual dimorphism in BAT thermogenic activity and a sex-specific impact of diet. Future studies should aim to quantify the contribution of BAT to childhood energy expenditure, energy imbalance, and any role in the origins of childhood obesity.
This Letter describes a search for Higgs boson pair production using the combined results from four final states: bbγγ, bbττ, bbbb, and bbVV, where V represents a W or Z boson. The search is performed using data collected in 2016 by the CMS experiment from LHC proton-proton collisions at sqrt[s]=13  TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9  fb^{-1}. Limits are set on the Higgs boson pair production cross section. A 95% confidence level observed (expected) upper limit on the nonresonant production cross section is set at 22.2 (12.8) times the standard model value. A search for narrow resonances decaying to Higgs boson pairs is also performed in the mass range 250-3000 GeV. No evidence for a signal is observed, and upper limits are set on the resonance production cross section.
In a context where structure elucidation of ion pairs in solution remains a contemporary challenge, this work explores an original approach where accurate gas phase spectroscopic data are used to refine high level quantum chemistry calculations of ion pairs in solution, resulting in an unprecedented level of accuracy in vibrational frequency prediction. First, gas phase studies focus on a series of isolated contact ion pairs (M+, Ph-CH2-COO-, with M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) for which conformer-selective IR spectra in the CO2- stretch region are recorded. These experiments reveal the interactions at play in isolated contact ion pairs, and provide vibrational frequencies enabling us to assess the accuracy of the theoretical approach used, i.e., mode-dependent scaled harmonic frequency calculations at the RI-B97-D3/dhf-TZVPP level. This level of calculation is then employed on large water clusters embedding either a free acetate ion or its contact or solvent-shared pairs with a sodium cation in order to simulate the individual vibrational spectra of these species in solution. This study shows that the stretching modes of carboxylate are sensitive to both solvent-shared and contact ion pair formation. FTIR spectra of solutions of increasing concentrations indeed reveal several spectral changes consistent with the presence of specific types of solvent-shared and contact ion pairs. By providing relevant guidelines for the interpretation of solution phase IR spectra, this work illustrates the potential of the approach for the elucidation of supramolecular structures in electrolyte solutions.
Polycipiviridae is a recently recognized viral family within the order Picornavirales with unusual genome organization and phylogenetic placement. Viruses belonging to this family were only reported from arthropod hosts. We describe here the first full genome of a distant polycipivirus-related virus identified in frugivorous bat stools in Cambodia.
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays an important role in thermoregulation and many metabolic processes in small mammals, especially in cold adaptation. However, in warm adaptation, ambient temperature cannot directly activate BAT by sympathetic nervous system. Mongolian gerbils exhibit a wider thermoneutral zone (26.5-38.9 °C). We hypothesized that BAT atrophied near the lower critical temperature and further atrophied near the upper critical temperature. Male gerbils were acclimated to 23 °C, 27 °C or 37 °C, respectively, for 3 weeks. Results showed that regulatory non-shivering thermogenesis did not change in gerbils acclimated to 27 °C compared with 23 °C group, whereas it was reduced by 43.5% in gerbils acclimated to 37 °C. Bigger lipid droplet in BAT was observed in gerbils acclimated to 27 °C and 37 °C compared with 23 °C group, while the expression of uncoupling protein 1 and tyrosine hydroxylase was only reduced in gerbils acclimated to 37 °C. Further, thermoneutral acclimation did not change BAT thermogenesis by down-regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α, PR domain containing 16, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α or peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ gene expression in BAT. In addition, body temperature was reduced in gerbils acclimated to 37 °C compared with 23 °C group, which was associated with a decreased resting metabolic rate and regulatory non-shivering thermogenesis. In conclusion, BAT does not atrophy near the lower critical temperature, whereas it atrophies near the upper critical temperature, suggesting that BAT may play thermoregulatory role within the TNZ in Mongolian gerbils.
It is well recognized that poor muscle function and poor physical performance are strong predictors of clinically relevant adverse events in older people. Given the large number of approaches to measure muscle function and physical performance, clinicians often struggle to choose a tool that is appropriate and validated for the population of older people they deal with. In this paper, an overview of different methods available and applicable in clinical settings is proposed. This paper is based on literature reviews performed by members of the European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis (ESCEO) working group on frailty and sarcopenia. Face-to-face meetings were organized afterwards where the whole group could amend and discuss the recommendations further. Several characteristics should be considered when choosing a tool: (1) purpose of the assessment (intervention, screening, diagnosis); (2) patient characteristics (population, settings, functional ability, etc.); (3) psychometric properties of the tool (test-retest reliability, inter-rater reliability, responsiveness, floor and ceiling effects, etc.); (4) applicability of the tool in clinical settings (overall cost, time required for the examination, level of training, equipment, patient acceptance, etc.); (5) prognostic reliability for relevant clinical outcomes. Based on these criteria and the available evidence, the expert group advises the use of grip strength to measure muscle strength and the use of 4-m gait speed or the Short Physical Performance Battery test to measure physical performance in daily practice. The tools proposed are relevant for the assessment of muscle weakness and physical performance. Subjects with low values should receive additional diagnostic workups to achieve a full diagnosis of the underlying condition responsible (sarcopenia, frailty or other).
Measurements are presented of associated production of a W boson and a charm quark ( W+c ) in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 Te . The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.7 fb-1 collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. The W bosons are identified by their decay into a muon and a neutrino. The charm quarks are tagged via the full reconstruction of D∗(2010)± mesons that decay via D∗(2010)±→D0+π±→K∓+π±+π± . A cross section is measured in the fiducial region defined by the muon transverse momentum pTμ&gt;26Ge , muon pseudorapidity |ημ|&lt;2.4 , and charm quark transverse momentum pTc&gt;5Ge . The inclusive cross section for this kinematic range is σ(W+c)=1026±31(stat)+76-72(syst) pb . The cross section is also measured differentially as a function of the pseudorapidity of the muon from the W boson decay. These measurements are compared with theoretical predictions and are used to probe the strange quark content of the proton.
Nipah and Hendra viruses (NiV and HeV) exhibit high lethality in humans and are BSL-4 paramyxoviruses in the growing genus, Henipavirus The attachment (G) and fusion (F) envelope glycoproteins are both required for viral entry into cells and for cell-cell fusion, pathognomonic of henipaviral infections. Here we compared the fusogenic capacities between homologous and heterologous pairs of NiV and HeV glycoproteins. Importantly, to accurately measure their fusogenic capacities, as these depend on glycoprotein cell surface expression (CSE) levels, we inserted identical extracellular tags to both fusion (FLAG tags) or both attachment (HA tags) glycoproteins. Importantly, these tags were placed in extracellular sites where they did not affect glycoprotein expression or function. NiV and HeV glycoproteins induced comparable levels of homologous HEK293T cell-cell fusion. Surprisingly however, while the heterologous NiV F/HeV G (NF/HG) combination yielded a hypofusogenic phenotype, the heterologous HeV F/NiV G (HF/NG) combination yielded a hyperfusogenic phenotype. Pseudotyped viral entry levels primarily corroborated the fusogenic phenotypes of the glycoprotein pairs analyzed. Furthermore, we constructed G and F chimeras that allowed us to map the overall regions in G and F that contributed to these hyperfusogenic or hypofusogenic phenotypes. Importantly, the fusogenic phenotypes of the glycoprotein combinations negatively correlated with the avidities of F/G interactions, supporting the F/G dissociation model of henipaviral-induced membrane fusion, even in the context of heterologous glycoprotein pairs.IMPORTANCE The Nipah (NiV) and Hendra (HeV) henipaviruses are BSL-4 pathogens transmitted from bats. NiV and HeV often lead to human death and animal diseases. The formation of multinucleated cells (syncytia) is a hallmark of henipaviral infections and is caused by fusion of cells coordinated by interactions of the viral attachment (G) and fusion (F) glycoproteins. We found via various assays that viral entry and syncytia formation depend on the viral origin of the glycoproteins, with HeV F and NiV G promoting higher membrane fusion levels than their counterparts. This is important knowledge, since both viruses use the same bat vector species and potential co-infections of these or subsequent hosts may alter the outcome of disease.
The floral transition is a complex developmental event, fine-tuned by various environmental and endogenous cues to ensure the success of offspring production. Leaves are key organs in sensing floral inductive signals, such as a change in light regime, and in the production of the mobile florigen. CONSTANS and FLOWERING LOCUS T are major players in leaves in response to photoperiod. Morphological and molecular events during the floral transition have been intensively studied in the shoot apical meristem. To better understand the concomitant processes in leaves, which are less described, we investigated the nuclear changes in fully developed leaves during the time course of the floral transition.
We highlighted new putative regulatory candidates of flowering in leaves. We observed differential expression profiles of genes related to cellular, hormonal and metabolic actions, but also of genes encoding long non-coding RNAs and new natural antisense transcripts. In addition, we detected a significant increase in ploidy level during the floral transition, indicating endoreduplication.
Our data indicate that differentiated mature leaves, possess physiological plasticity and undergo extensive nuclear reprogramming during the floral transition. The dynamic events point at functionally related networks of transcription factors and novel regulatory motifs, but also complex hormonal and metabolic changes.
The worldwide increase of graphene family materials raises the question of the potential consequences resulting from their release in the environment and future consequences on ecosystem health, especially in the aquatic environment in which they are likely to accumulate. Thus, there is a need to evaluate the biological and ecological risk but also to find innovative solutions leading to the production of safer materials. This work focuses on the evaluation of functional group-safety relationships regarding to graphene oxide (GO) in vivo genotoxic potential toward X. laevis tadpoles. For this purpose, thermal treatments in H₂ atmosphere were applied to produce reduced graphene oxide (rGOs) with different surface group compositions. Analysis performed indicated that GO induced disturbances in erythrocyte cell cycle leading to accumulation of cells in G0/G1 phase. Significant genotoxicity due to oxidative stress was observed in larvae exposed to low GO concentration (0.1 mg.L-¹). Reduction of GO at 200 °C and 1000 °C produced a material that was no longer genotoxic at low concentrations. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis indicated that epoxide groups may constitute a good candidate to explain the genotoxic potential of the most oxidized form of the material. Thermal reduction of GO may constitute an appropriate "safer-by-design" strategy for the development of a safer material for environment.
Bats are implicated as natural reservoirs for a wide range of zoonotic viruses including SARS and MERS coronaviruses, Ebola, Marburg, Nipah, Hendra, Rabies and other lyssaviruses. Accordingly, many One Health surveillance and viral discovery programs have focused on bats. In this report we present viral metagenomic data from bats collected in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia [KSA]. Unbiased high throughput sequencing of fecal samples from 72 bat individuals comprising four species; lesser mouse-tailed bat (Rhinopoma hardwickii), Egyptian tomb bat (Taphozous perforatus), straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum), and Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) revealed molecular evidence of a diverse set of viral families: Picornaviridae (hepatovirus, teschovirus, parechovirus), Reoviridae (rotavirus), Polyomaviridae (polyomavirus), Papillomaviridae (papillomavirus), Astroviridae (astrovirus), Caliciviridae (sapovirus), Coronaviridae (coronavirus), Adenoviridae (adenovirus), Paramyxoviridae (paramyxovirus), and unassigned mononegavirales (chuvirus). Additionally, we discovered a bastro-like virus (Middle East Hepe-Astrovirus), with a genomic organization similar to Hepeviridae. However, since it shared homology with Hepeviridae and Astroviridae at ORF1 and in ORF2, respectively, the newly discovered Hepe-Astrovirus may represent a phylogenetic bridge between Hepeviridae and Astroviridae.
Bioinspired robotic systems are often designed by assuming that the kinematics of the biological system of interest are well approximated by an open kinematic chain subject to box constraints. These box-constrains are typically generated by designer interpretation of biomotion and anatomical studies or pragmatic fabrication constraints. In contrast to this standard design paradigm, this paper presents a methodology for learning joint geometry which restricts the range of motion of generic ball joints to only the reachable set observed during biomotion experiments. This reachable set is identified by constructing an analytical-empirical potential energy function over the experimental observations. The energy function effectively 'pushes' configurations close to the set of observations. This energy function is then thresholded to identify the zero-potential (ZP) configuration set, and joint geometry is constructed using the resulting contour. We construct an entire bat wing using this method, and demonstrate through motion capture experiments that the learned geometry successfully restricts motions to the ZP set.
It is well established that hibernating mammals rely predominantly on lipid stores to fuel metabolism throughout the hibernation season. However, it is unclear if other endogenous fuels contribute to the rapid, ~400-fold increase in metabolic rate during the early phase of arousal from torpor. We investigated this using cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS), a technique that provides a real-time indication of fuel use by measuring the ratio of 13C to 12C in the exhaled CO2 of arousing 13-lined ground squirrels ( Ictidomys tridecemlineatus). We simultaneously measured ventilation and surface temperature change in various body regions using infrared thermography, and interpreted these data in light of changing plasma metabolite abundances at multiple torpor-arousal stages. We found that hibernating squirrels fueled the initial ~60 min of arousal using mixed fuels - lipids and likely carbohydrates - before switching to predominantly lipid oxidation. This fuel switch coincided with times of maximal rates of ventilation and rewarming of different body surface regions, including brown adipose tissue (BAT). Infrared thermography revealed zonal rewarming, whereby the BAT region was first to warm, followed by the thoracic and head regions, and finally the posterior half of the body. Consistent with the CRDS results, plasma metabolite dynamics during early arousal suggested a large reliance on fatty acids with a contribution of carbohydrates and glycerol. High oxidative flux rates and efficient O2 use may make carbohydrates an advantageous metabolic fuel during the early phase of arousal, when metabolic demands are high but ventilation rates, and thus O2 supply, are relatively low.
The guanidine 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene (TBD) and the substituted derivatives [TBD-SiR2]+ and TBD-BR2 reacted with SO2 to give different FLP-SO2 adducts. Molecular structures, elucidated by X-ray diffraction, showed some structural similarities with the analogous CO2 adducts. Thermodynamic stabilities were both experimentally evidenced and computed through DFT calculations. The underlying parameters governing the relative stabilities of the different SO2 and CO2 adducts were then discussed from a theoretical standpoint, with a focus on the influence of the Lewis acidic moiety.
Spleen is one of the important lymphoid organs with wide variations of morphological and physiological functions according to species. Morphology and function of the spleen in bats, which are hosts to several viral strains without exhibiting clinical symptoms, remain to be fully elucidated. This study aims to examine the spleen morphology of fruit bats associated with their physiological functions. Spleen histological observations were performed in three fruit bats species: Cynopterus titthaecheilus (n = 9), Rousettus leschenaultii (n = 3) and Pteropus vampyrus (n = 3). The spleens of these fruit bats were surrounded by a thin capsule. Red pulp consisted of splenic cord and wide vascular space filled with blood. Ellipsoids in all three studied species were found numerously and adjacent to one another forming macrophages aggregates. White pulp consisted of periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths (PALS), lymphoid follicles and marginal zone. The lymphoid follicle contained a germinal centre and a tingible body macrophage that might reflect an active immune system. The marginal zone was prominent and well developed. This study reports some differences in spleen structure of fruit bats compared to other bat species previously reported and discusses possible physiological implications of the spleen based on its morphology.
Hemoplasma DNA was found in 22% (12/55) of samples from six bat species in Chile, including one of three big-eared brown bats (Histiotus macrotus), one of three small big-eared brown bats (Histiotus montanus), and 10 of 27 Chilean myotis (Myotis chiloensis). Characterization of the 16S rRNA gene identified three genotypes phylogenetically related to other bat, rodent, and human hemoplasmas.
A search is presented for resonant production of second-generation sleptons ( μ~L , ν~μ ) via the R-parity-violating coupling λ211' to quarks, in events with two same-sign muons and at least two jets in the final state. The smuon (muon sneutrino) is expected to decay into a muon and a neutralino (chargino), which will then decay into a second muon and at least two jets. The analysis is based on the 2016 data set of proton-proton collisions at s=13TeV recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1 . No significant deviation is observed with respect to standard model expectations. Upper limits on cross sections, ranging from 0.24 to 730 fb , are derived in the context of two simplified models representing the dominant signal contributions leading to a same-sign muon pair. The cross section limits are translated into coupling limits for a modified constrained minimal supersymmetric model with λ211' as the only nonzero R-parity violating coupling. The results significantly extend restrictions of the parameter space compared with previous searches for similar models.
A search for dark matter produced in association with a Higgs boson decaying to a pair of bottom quarks is performed in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 Te collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. The analyzed data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1 . The signal is characterized by a large missing transverse momentum recoiling against a bottom quark-antiquark system that has a large Lorentz boost. The number of events observed in the data is consistent with the standard model background prediction. Results are interpreted in terms of limits both on parameters of the type-2 two-Higgs doublet model extended by an additional light pseudoscalar boson a (2HDM+ a ) and on parameters of a baryonic Z' simplified model. The 2HDM+ a model is tested experimentally for the first time. For the baryonic Z' model, the presented results constitute the most stringent constraints to date.
The exclusive photoproduction of Υ(nS) meson states from protons, γp→Υ(nS)p (with n=1,2,3 ), is studied in ultraperipheral p Pb collisions at a centre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of sNN=5.02TeV . The measurement is performed using the Υ(nS)→μ+μ- decay mode, with data collected by the CMS experiment corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 32.6 nb-1 . Differential cross sections as functions of the Υ(nS) transverse momentum squared pT2 , and rapidity y, are presented. The Υ(1S) photoproduction cross section is extracted in the rapidity range |y|&lt;2.2 , which corresponds to photon-proton centre-of-mass energies in the range 91&lt;Wγp&lt;826GeV . The data are compared to theoretical predictions based on perturbative quantum chromodynamics and to previous measurements.
Hedgerows provide valuable habitats and corridors for many species in farmland, yet a lack of appropriate management may threaten their benefits to biodiversity. Although agri-environment scheme (AES) prescriptions on hedgerow management have the potential to reverse the detrimental effect of over-trimming on wildlife, their effectiveness has rarely been addressed. The aims of the study were to (i) assess moth responses to trimming regimes; and (ii) investigate the influence of the surrounding landscape on moth assemblages. We specifically tested the effectiveness of the trimming regime recommended by the targeted AES that was implemented on farms near greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) colonies since it represented the most sympathetic hedgerow management option among English AES options. We sampled adult micro- and macro-moths along 64 hedgerows located within 20 English farms using light traps, and classified moths into two guilds reflecting their larval food preferences, namely grass/herb- and shrub/tree-feeders. Our results suggest that reducing trimming has a positive impact on macro-moth species richness as well as on shrub/tree-feeder abundance and species richness. It also benefited four moth species that are significantly declining in Britain. Furthermore, while the proportion of woodland at a large spatial scale (3.0 km radius around the sampling sites) was positively associated with the abundance of macro-moths and grass/herb-feeders, woodland connectivity had a positive effect on the species richness of grass/herb- and shrub/tree-feeders at large and medium (1.5 km radius) scales, respectively. Both the abundance and species richness of macro-moths and the abundance of shrub/tree-feeders were negatively affected by the presence of arable fields adjacent to hedgerows. Overall, these findings reveal the wider biodiversity benefits of targeted AESs focusing on habitat improvement for R. ferrumequinum, and the importance of woodland in the wider landscape. We therefore strongly recommend implementing a multi-scale management approach (i.e. from field to landscape) through the use of adequate AES prescriptions to conserve moths in agricultural landscapes.
This study aimed to examine whether brown adipose tissue (BAT) or skeletal muscle activity mediates the relationship between personal level of environmental temperature (Personal-ET) and wrist skin temperature (WT). Moreover, we examined whether BAT and skeletal muscle have a mediating role between Personal-ET and WT (as a proxy of peripheral vasoconstriction/vasodilation).
The levels of BAT were quantified by cold-induced 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan and measured the Personal-ET and WT by using iButtons (Maxim Integrated, Dallas, Texas) in 75 participants (74.6% women).
The study found that BAT volume and metabolic activity played a positive and significant role (up to 25.4%) in the association between Personal-ET and WT. In addition, at the coldest temperatures, the participants with lower levels of WT (inducing higher peripheral vasoconstriction) had higher levels of BAT outcomes, whereas in warm temperatures, participants with higher levels of WT (inducing higher peripheral vasodilation) had lower levels of BAT outcomes. The study did not find any mediating role of skeletal muscle activity.
BAT volume and metabolic activity play a role in the relationship between Personal-ET and WT. Moreover, the data suggest that there are two distinct phenotypes: individuals who respond better to the cold, both through nonshivering thermogenesis and peripheral vasoconstriction, and individuals who respond better to the heat.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is highly prevalent around the world and has a large impact on its patients, leading to a poor health-related quality of life (HRQL) and exercise capacity. Even under optimal medications, there are still many patients with poor HRQL. Body acupuncture therapy (BAT) is a non-invasive and a popular therapy. Therefore, we aimed to comprehensively analyze the effects of BAT in COPD.
Eight electronic databases were searched. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effect of BAT, medication (M), and pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). The primary outcome was HRQL evaluated by St. George's respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ) or COPD assessment test (CAT).
Of the 922 articles, 12 studies were included with attesting a total of 798 participants. The result obtained indicated a significant improvement that favored the BAT + M group over the M group in CAT scores (MD: -4.77; 95% CI: -6.53 to -3.01; p &lt; 0.00001).
BAT is an effective adjunctive non-pharmacological treatment to improve HRQL in patients under medical treatment for COPD. We suggested that BAT should be considered as one of the methods of management in patients with COPD.
Bombali virus (genus Ebolavirus) was identified in organs and excreta of an Angolan free-tailed bat (Mops condylurus) in Kenya. Complete genome analysis revealed 98% nucleotide sequence similarity to the prototype virus from Sierra Leone. No Ebola virus-specific RNA or antibodies were detected from febrile humans in the area who reported contact with bats.
We retrieved Nipah virus (NiV) sequences from 4 human and 3 fruit bat (Pteropus medius) samples from a 2018 outbreak in Kerala, India. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that NiV from humans was 96.15% similar to a Bangladesh strain but 99.7%-100% similar to virus from Pteropus spp. bats, indicating bats were the source of the outbreak.
Body composition and hepatic fat correlate with future risk for metabolic syndrome. In children, many conventional techniques for quantifying body composition and hepatic fat have limitations. MRI is a noninvasive research tool to study body composition and hepatic fat in infants; however, conventional Cartesian MRI is sensitive to motion, particularly in the abdomen because of respiration. Therefore we developed a free-breathing MRI technique to quantify body composition and hepatic fat in infants.
In infants, we aimed to (1) compare the image quality between free-breathing 3-D stack-of-radial MRI (free-breathing radial) and 3-D Cartesian MRI in the liver and (2) determine the feasibility of using free-breathing radial MRI to quantify body composition and hepatic proton-density fat fraction (PDFF).
Ten infants ages 2-7 months were scanned with free-breathing radial (two abdominal; one head and chest) and Cartesian (one abdominal) MRI sequences. The median preparation and scan times were reported. To assess feasibility for hepatic PDFF quantification, a radiologist masked to the MRI technique scored abdominal scans for motion artifacts in the liver using a 3-point scale (1, or non-diagnostic, to 3, or no artifacts). Median visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) volume and PDFF, and hepatic PDFF were measured using free-breathing radial MRI. We assessed repeatability of free-breathing radial hepatic PDFF (coefficient of repeatability) between back-to-back scans. We determined differences in the distribution of image-quality scores using McNemar-Bowker tests. P&lt;0.05 was considered significant.
Nine infants completed the entire study (90% completion). For ten infants, the median preparation time was 32 min and scan time was 24 min. Free-breathing radial MRI demonstrated significantly higher image-quality scores compared to Cartesian MRI in the liver (radial scan 1 median = 2 and radial scan 2 median = 3 vs. Cartesian median = 1; P=0.01). Median measurements using free-breathing radial were VAT=52.0 cm3, VAT-PDFF=42.2%, SAT=267.7 cm3, SAT-PDFF=87.1%, BAT=1.4 cm3, BAT-PDFF=26.1% and hepatic PDFF=3.4% (coefficient of repeatability &lt;2.0%).
In this study, free-breathing radial MRI in infants achieved significantly improved liver image quality compared to Cartesian MRI. It is feasible to use free-breathing radial MRI to quantify body composition and hepatic fat in infants.
Hamate hook fractures are usually caused by direct trauma while using a tennis racket or a baseball bat. We report stress fracture of the hamate hook in a water polo player without any specific trauma. We consider that the stress fracture occurred via indirect mechanisms through the flexor tendons. Strong ulnar deviation of the wrist during ball release and strong grip on a ball with outstretched fingers, which are unique to water polo, were the likely causes of the stress fracture of the hamate hook.
Pre-commitment tools - allowing users of gambling services to pre-set a limit for how much money they may spend - are relatively common. However, there exist no clear evidence of their effectiveness in preventing gamblers from spending more money than they otherwise planned. The aim of the study was to compare gambling intensity between users of an online gambling service prompted to set a deposit limit and non-prompted customers, both in the whole sample and among most active users based on the total number of gambling days. Prospective customers of a publicly governed gambling operator from Finland were randomized to receive a prompt to set a voluntary deposit limit of optional size either (1) at registration, (2) before or (3) after their first deposit, or (4) to an unprompted control condition. Data on customers from Finland with online slots as a preferred gambling category (N = 4328) were tracked in the platform for 90 days starting at account registration, gambling intensity being measured with aggregated net loss. The intervention groups did not differ from each other in either proportion of participants with positive net loss or size of positive net loss. The pooled intervention group did not differ from the control group regarding proportion of gamblers with positive net loss (OR = 1.0; p = 0.921) or size of net loss (B = -0.1; p = 0.291). The intervention groups had higher rates of limit-setters compared to the control condition (ORat-registration/pre-deposit/post-deposit = 11.9/9.2/4.1). Customers who have increased/removed a previously set deposit limit had higher net loss than the limit-setters who have not increased/removed their limit (Bat-registration/pre-deposit/post-deposit/control = 0.7/0.6/1.0/1.3), and unprompted limit-setters lost more than unprompted non-setters (B = 1.0). Prompting online gamblers to set a voluntary deposit limit of optional size did not affect subsequent net loss compared to unprompted customers, motivating design and evaluation of alternative pre-commitment tools. Setting a deposit limit without a prompt or increasing/removing a previously set limit may be a marker of gambling problems and may be used to identify customers in need of help.
Diverticulosis of the colon is the most common condition in Western societies and it is the most common anatomic alteration of the human colon. Recurrent abdominal pain is experienced by about 20% of patients with diverticulosis, but the pathophysiologic mechanisms of its occurrence are not completely understood. In the last years, several fine papers have showed clearly the role of low-grade inflammation both in the occurrence of symptoms in people having diverticulosis, both in symptom persistence following acute diverticulitis, even if the evidence available is not so strong. We do not know yet what the trigger of this low-grade inflammation occurrence is. However, some preliminary evidence found colonic dysbiosis linked to low-grade inflammation and therefore to symptom occurrence in those patients. The aim of this paper is to summarize current evidences about the role of inflammation in symptom occurrence in symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease and in symptom persistence after an episode of acute diverticulitis.
Viral metagenomics analysis of samples from bats has been carried out as part of bat rabies surveillance in Croatia. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of a novel circo-like virus isolated from a sample of Miniopterus schreibersii bat guano determined by Illumina next-generation sequencing.
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is rich in mitochondria and plays important roles in energy expenditure, thermogenesis, and glucose homeostasis. We find that levels of mitochondrial protein succinylation and malonylation are high in BAT and subject to physiological and genetic regulation. BAT-specific deletion of Sirt5, a mitochondrial desuccinylase and demalonylase, results in dramatic increases in global protein succinylation and malonylation. Mass spectrometry-based quantification of succinylation reveals that Sirt5 regulates the key thermogenic protein in BAT, UCP1. Mutation of the two succinylated lysines in UCP1 to acyl-mimetic glutamine and glutamic acid significantly decreases its stability and activity. The reduced function of UCP1 and other proteins in Sirt5KO BAT results in impaired mitochondria respiration, defective mitophagy, and metabolic inflexibility. Thus, succinylation of UCP1 and other mitochondrial proteins plays an important role in BAT and in regulation of energy homeostasis.
Coronaviruses are positive-stranded RNA viruses that infect a variety of hosts, resulting in a range of symptoms from gastrointestinal illness to respiratory distress. Bats are reservoirs for a high diversity of coronaviruses, and focused surveillance detected several strains genetically similar to MERS-coronavirus, SARS-coronavirus, and the human coronaviruses 229E and NL63. The bat fauna of central Asia, which link China to eastern Europe, are relatively less studied than other regions of the world. Kazakhstan is the world's ninth largest country; however, little is understood about the prevalence and diversity of bat-borne viruses. In this study, bat guano was collected from bat caves in three different sites of southern Kazakhstan that tested positive for coronaviruses. Our phylogenetic reconstruction indicates these are novel bat coronaviruses that belong to the genus Alphacoronavirus. In addition, two distinct lineages of Kazakhstan bat coronaviruses were detected. Both lineages are closely related to bat coronaviruses from China, France, Spain, and South Africa, suggesting that co-circulation of coronaviruses is common in multiple bat species with overlapping geographical distributions. Our study highlights the need for collaborative efforts in understudied countries to increase integrated surveillance capabilities toward better monitoring and detection of infectious diseases.
Echolocating bats emit biosonar calls and use echoes arising from call reflections, for orientation. They often pattern their calls into groups which increases the rate of sensory feedback. Insectivorous bats emit call groups at a higher rate when orienting in cluttered compared to uncluttered environments. Frugivorous bats increase the rate of call group emission when they echolocate in noisy environments. In frugivorous bats, it remains unclear if call group emission represents an exclusive adaptation to avoid acoustic interference by signals of conspecifics or if it represents an adaptation that allows to orient under demanding environmental conditions. Here, we compared the emission pattern of the frugivorous bat Carolliaperspicillata when the bats were flying in narrow versus wide or cluttered versus non-cluttered corridors. The bats emitted larger call groups and they increased the call rate within call groups when navigating in narrow or cluttered environments. These adaptations resemble the ones shown when the bats navigate in noisy environments. Thus, call group emission represents an adaptive behavior when the bats orient in complex environments.
ε-Viniferin, a resveratrol dimer, is a naturally occurring stilbene that has been studied so far for its potential beneficial effects on human health. Its low water solubility, its photo-sensitivity and its low bioavailability make its applications in the food industry complicated. To overcome these limitations, ε-viniferin was encapsulated in phospholipid-based multi-lamellar liposomes (MLLs) called spherulites or onions. In the best case, an encapsulation efficiency of 58 ± 3% and a bioactive loading of 4.2 ± 0.5% were reached. Encapsulation of ε-viniferin drastically increased its water solubility by more than 5 orders to reach 17.4 g L-1 and provided protection against its UV-induced isomerization. While ε-viniferin was shown to be significantly toxic to Caco-2 intestinal-like cells for concentrations higher than 25 μM, once encapsulated in MLLs, those cells did not experience any mortality even for the highest tested stilbene concentration (100 μM) as revealed by red neutral assay.
High-throughput RNA sequencing is a powerful tool that allows us to perform gene prediction and analyze tissue-specific overexpression of genes, but also at species level comparisons can be performed, although in a more restricted manner. In the present study complete liver transcriptomes of five tropical bat species were De novo assembled and annotated. Highly expressed genes in the five species were involved in glycolysis and lipid metabolism pathways. Cross-species differential expression analysis was conducted using single copy orthologues shared across the five species. Between 22 and 29 orthologs were upregulated for each species. We detected upregulated expression in Artibeus jamaicensis genes related to fructose metabolism pathway. Such findings can be correlated with A. jamaicensis dietary habits, as it was the unique frugivorous species included. This is the first report of transcriptome assembly by RNA-seq in these species, except for A. jamaicensis and as far as our knowledge is the first cross-species comparisons of transcriptomes and gene expression in tropical bats.
Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT) is present in a significant number of adult humans and can be activated by exposure to cold. Measurement of active BAT presence, activity, and volume are desirable for determining the efficacy of potential treatments intended to activate BAT. The repeatability of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) measurements of BAT presence, activity, and volume under controlled conditions has not been extensively studied. Eleven female volunteers underwent double baseline FDG PET imaging performed following a simple, regional cold intervention intended to activate brown fat. The cold intervention involved the lightly-clothed participants intermittently placing their feet on a block of ice while sitting in a cooled room. A repeat study was performed under the same conditions within a target of two weeks. FDG scans were obtained and maximum standardized uptake value adjusted for lean body mass (SULmax), CT Hounsfield units (HU), BAT metabolic volume (BMV), and total BAT glycolysis (TBG) were determined according to the Brown Adipose Reporting Criteria in Imaging STudies (BARCIST) 1.0. A Lin's concordance correlation (CCC) of 0.80 was found for BMV between test and retest imaging. Intersession BAT SULmax was significantly correlated (r = 0.54; p &lt; 0.05). The session #1 mean SULmax of 4.92 ± 4.49 g/mL was not significantly different from that of session #2 with a mean SULmax of 7.19 ± 7.34 g/mL (p = 0.16). BAT SULmax was highly correlated with BMV in test and retest studies (r ≥ 0.96, p &lt; 0.001). Using a simplified ice-block cooling method, BAT was activated in the majority (9/11) of a group of young, lean female participants. Quantitative assessments of BAT SUL and BMV were not substantially different between test and retest imaging, but individual BMV could vary considerably. Intrasession BMV and SULmax were strongly correlated. The variability in estimates of BAT activity and volume on test-retest with FDG should inform sample size choice in studies quantifying BAT physiology and support the dynamic metabolic characteristics of this tissue. A more sophisticated cooling method potentially may reduce variations in test-retest BAT studies.
According to recent studies, kidney stones are associated with metabolic syndrome. We focused on brown adipocytes and β3 stimulant-induced brown-like adipocytes to investigate how these adipocytes influence kidney stone disease. For the interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) removal experiment, mice were subjected to either iBAT removal or sham operation (X-BAT group or Sham group), and after 3 weeks, renal crystal deposition was induced by intra-abdominal injection of glyoxylate (GOX) for 6 days. For the β3 stimulant experiment, mice were administered intra-abdominal injections of the β3 stimulant (β3 group) or saline (Control group) for 6 days. Thereafter, renal crystal deposition was induced by intra-abdominal injection of GOX for 6 days. iBAT removal decreased the expression of Sod1 and increased that of Ccl2, Emr1, and Tnf in the kidneys. Renal crystal deposition was 2.06-fold higher in the X-BAT group than in the Sham group. The β3 stimulant differentiate white adipocytes into brown-like adipocytes. In the kidneys of β3 group, the expression of Ccl2 and Emr1 decreased and that of Sod1 increased. Renal crystal deposition was 0.17-fold lower in the β3 group than in the Control group. In summary, iBAT removal promoted kidney inflammation and renal crystal formation. β3 stimulant-induced brown-like adipocytes reduced inflammation and improved antioxidant action in the kidneys, which suppressed renal crystal formation. This is the first report on the therapeutic role of brown and brown-like adipocytes for kidney stone formation.
Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) influences energy balance by exerting effects on food intake and glucose metabolism, through mechanisms that are partially dependent on the vagal pathway. The aim of this study was to characterize the effects of chronic GLP-1 stimulation on energy homeostasis and glucose metabolism in the absence of vagal innervation Truncal vagotomized (VGX) and sham operated rats (SHAM) received an intraperitoneal GLP-1 infusion (3.5 pmol/kg/min) trough mini-osmotic pumps. To dissect the effects derived from vagal denervation on food intake, an additional group was included consisting of sham operated rats that were PAIR FED to VGX. Food intake and body weight were recorded throughout the experimental period, while the percentage of white and brown adipose tissue, fasting glucose, insulin, gastro-intestinal hormonal profile, hypothalamic, and BAT gene expression were assessed at endpoint. VGX rats had significantly lower food intake, body weight gain, and leptin levels when compared with SHAM rats. Despite having similar body weight, PAIR-FED rats had lower fasting leptin, insulin and insulin resistance, while having higher ghrelin levels than VGX. GLP-1 infusion did not influence food intake or body weight, but was associated with lower leptin levels in VGX and lower pancreatic α-cells ki-67 staining in SHAM. Concluding, this study corroborates that the vagus nerve may modulate whole body energy homeostasis by acting in peripheral signals. Our data suggest that in the absence of vagal or parasympathetic tonus, GLP-1 mediated inhibition of cell proliferation markers in α-cells is prevented, meanwhile leptin suppression, associated with a negative energy balance, is partially overridden.
Kyasanur forest disease virus (KFDV) is a tick-borne flavivirus identified in 1957 in the Karnataka state of India causing fatalities in monkeys and humans. Even after the introduction of a vaccine in the endemic areas, hundreds of cases are reported every year. Being a high-risk category pathogen, the studies on this virus in India were limited till the past decade. The growth characteristics of this virus in various mammalian cell lines have not yet been studied. In this study, we have demonstrated the growth pattern of virus in BHK-21, Vero E6, Vero CCL81, rhabdomyosarcoma, porcine stable kidney, and Pipistrellus ceylonicus bat embryo cell lines, and found BHK-21 to be the best. We have developed KFDV plaque reduction neutralization test for the first time.
In two experiments, we explored the nature of the bias observed in the bat/ball problem of the cognitive reflection test (Frederick, 2005, J. Econ. Perspect., 19, 25), how to override it, and its relation to executive functioning. Based on the original bat/ball problem, we designed two additional isomorphic items. In Experiment 1, for four age groups, including 7-, 11-, and 15-year-olds and adults, we determined that the bias is related to the System 1 intervention; the performance in this item was not a matter of mathematical ability and it could be facilitated by changing the order in which the problems were presented. In Experiment 2, we determined that for 15-year-olds, good and bad performances in the item were related to executive functioning, particularly response-distractor inhibition, updating information in working memory, and the regulation of attention; however, subtle differences were identified when the problem was performed in a facilitative context compared with a non-facilitative context. The results indicated that cognitive abilities are a necessary but non-sufficient condition to resolve the problem.
Four bacterial strains, with the capability of inhibiting Pseudogymnoascus destructans, the causative agent of white-nose syndrome, were isolated from male Townsend's big-eared bats (Corynorhinus townsendii, Family: Vespertilionidae) in New Mexico. Isolates AC161, AC162, AC208, and AC230T were characterised as a novel clade using morphological, phenotypic and phylogenetic analysis. A draft genome of the type strain was completed to determine its taxonomy and secondary metabolite biosynthetic potential. Multi-locus sequence analysis nests AC230T with neighbours Streptomyces scopuliridis (NRRL B-24574T), Streptomyces lushanensis (NRRL B-24994T), Streptomyces odonnellii (NRRL B-24891T) and Streptomyces niveus (NRRL 2466T). Further phylogenetic analysis showed the MLSA distances between AC230T and its near neighbours are much greater than the generally accepted threshold (&gt; 0.007) for bacterial species delineation. DNA-DNA relatedness between AC230T and its near neighbours ranged between 25.7 ± 2.1 and 29.9 ± 2.4%. The DNA G+C content of the genomic DNA of the type strain is 71.7 mol%. Isolate AC230T presents a white to ivory hue on most ISP media and its micromorphology exhibits ovoid spores with smooth surfaces in flexuous chains. Based on our study of AC230T, the strain warrants the assignment to a novel species, for which the name Streptomyces corynorhini sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is AC230T (= JCM 33171T, = ATCC TSD155T).
Amino-acid N-choloyltransferase was purified from human liver. The procedure resulted in about 100-fold enriched activity and glycine- and taurine-dependent activities co-purified and did not separate to any extent in any of the steps. The final enzyme preparation had an apparent molecular mass of 100 kDa by gel filtration, 118 kDa by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and was composed of two identical subunits which had a molecular mass of 52 kDa, as judged by dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis. The glycine- and taurine-dependent activities showed optima at pH 7.2 and pH 6.5, respectively. Apparent Km values of purified enzyme were 3.2 and 0.6mM for glycine and taurine, respectively. The Km value for choloyl-CoA was 50 microM for the glycine-dependent activity and 87 microM for the taurine-dependent activity. Bile acid derivatives and cholesterol had an inhibitory effect on both glycine- and taurine-dependent activity in vitro; on the other hand, the reaction was stimulated by the addition of glutathione, EDTA and L-cysteine. Amino acid substrate specificity was restricted to glycine, taurine, beta-alanine and D-alpha-alanine. As well as choloyl-CoA, its deoxy derivatives were also good substrates for the enzyme.
The microbial production of free fatty acids (FFAs) and reduced derivatives is an attractive process for the renewable production of diesel fuels. Toward this goal, a plasmid-free strain of Escherichia coli was engineered to produce FFAs by integrating three copies of a thioesterase gene from Umbellularia californica (BTE) under the control of an inducible promoter onto the chromosome. In batch culture, the resulting strain produced identical titers to a previously reported strain that expressed the thioesterase from a plasmid. The growth rate, glucose consumption rate, and FFA production rate of this strain were studied in continuous cultivation under carbon limitation. The highest yield of FFA on glucose was observed at a dilution rate of 0.05 h(-1) with the highest specific productivity observed at a dilution rate of 0.2 h(-1). The observed yields under the lowest dilution rate were 15% higher than that observed in batch cultures. An increase in both productivity and yield (≈ 40%) was observed when the composition of the nutrients was altered to shift the culture toward non-carbon limitation. A deterministic model of the production strain has been proposed and indicates that maintenance requirements for this strain are significantly higher than wild-type E. coli.
Signal molecules of the diffusible signal factor (DSF) family have been shown recently to be involved in regulation of pathogenesis and biofilm formation in diverse Gram-negative bacteria. DSF signals are reported to be active not only on their cognate bacteria, but also on unrelated bacteria and the pathogenic yeast, Candida albicans. DSFs are monounsaturated fatty acids of medium chain length containing an unusual cis-2 double bond. Although genetic analyses had identified genes involved in DSF synthesis, the pathway of DSF synthesis was unknown. The DSF of the important human pathogen Burkholderia cenocepacia (called BDSF) is cis-2-dodecenoic acid. We report that BDSF is synthesized from a fatty acid synthetic intermediate, the acyl carrier protein (ACP) thioester of 3-hydroxydodecanoic acid. This intermediate is intercepted by protein Bcam0581 and converted to cis-2-dodecenoyl-ACP. Bcam0581 is annotated as a homologue of crotonase, the first enzyme of the fatty acid degradation pathway. We demonstrated Bcam0581to be a bifunctional protein that not only catalysed dehydration of 3-hydroxydodecanoyl-ACP to cis-2-dodecenoyl-ACP, but also cleaved the thioester bond to give the free acid. Both activities required the same set of active-site residues. Although dehydratase and thioesterase activities are known activities of the crotonase superfamily, Bcam0581 is the first protein shown to have both activities.
The palmitoylation/depalmitoylation cycle of posttranslational processing is a potential therapeutic target for selectively inhibiting the growth of hematologic cancers with somatic NRAS mutations. To investigate this question at the single-cell level, we constructed murine stem cell virus vectors and assayed the growth of myeloid progenitors. Whereas cells expressing oncogenic N-Ras(G12D) formed cytokine-independent colonies and were hypersensitive to GM-CSF, mutations within the N-Ras hypervariable region induced N-Ras mislocalization and attenuated aberrant progenitor growth. Exposing transduced hematopoietic cells and bone marrow from Nras and Kras mutant mice to the acyl protein thioesterase inhibitor palmostatin B had similar effects on protein localization and colony growth. Importantly, palmostatin B-mediated inhibition was selective for Nras mutant cells, and we mapped this activity to the hypervariable region. These data support the clinical development of depalmitoylation inhibitors as a novel class of rational therapeutics in hematologic malignancies with NRAS mutations.
The goal of this research was to develop recombinant Escherichia coli to improve fatty acid synthesis (FAS). Genes encoding acetyl-CoA carboxylase (accA, accB, accC), malonyl-CoA-[acyl-carrier-protein] transacylase (fabD), and acyl-acyl carrier protein thioesterase (EC 3.1.2.14 gene), which are all enzymes that catalyze key steps in the synthesis of fatty acids, were cloned and over-expressed in E. coli MG1655. The acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) enzyme catalyzes the addition of CO(2) to acetyl-CoA to generate malonyl-CoA. The enzyme encoded by the fabD gene converts malonyl-CoA to malonyl-[acp], and the EC 3.1.2.14 gene converts fatty acyl-ACP chains to long chain fatty acids. All the genes except for the EC 3.1.2.14 gene were homologous to E. coli genes and were used to improve the enzymatic activities to over-express components of the FAS pathway through metabolic engineering. All recombinant E. coli MG1655 strains containing various gene combinations were developed using the pTrc99A expression vector. To observe changes in metabolism, the in vitro metabolites and fatty acids produced by the recombinants were analyzed. The fatty acids (C16) from recombinant strains were produced 1.23-2.41 times higher than that from the wild type.
The liver controls central processes of lipid and bile acid homeostasis. We aimed to investigate whether alterations in lipid metabolism contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic cholestatic liver disease in mice.
We used microarray and metabolic profiling analyses to identify alterations in systemic and hepatic lipid metabolism in mice with disruption of the gene ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 4 (Abcb4(-/-) mice), a model of inflammation-induced cholestatic liver injury, fibrosis, and cancer.
Alterations in Abcb4(-/-) mice, compared with wild-type mice, included deregulation of genes that control lipid synthesis, storage, and oxidation; decreased serum levels of cholesterol and phospholipids; and reduced hepatic long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs (LCA-CoA). Feeding Abcb4(-/-) mice the side chain-modified bile acid 24-norursodeoxycholic acid (norUDCA) reversed their liver injury and fibrosis, increased serum levels of lipids, lowered phospholipase and triglyceride hydrolase activities, and restored hepatic LCA-CoA and triglyceride levels. Additional genetic and nutritional studies indicated that lipid metabolism contributed to chronic cholestatic liver injury; crossing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α-deficient mice with Abcb4(-/-) mice (to create double knockouts) or placing Abcb4(-/-) mice on a high-fat diet protected against liver injury, with features similar to those involved in the response to norUDCA. Placing pregnant Abcb4(-/-) mice on high-fat diets prevented liver injury in their offspring. However, fenofibrate, an activator of PPARα, aggravated liver injury in Abcb4(-/-) mice.
Alterations in lipid metabolism contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of cholestatic liver disease in mice.
Finding the target: activity-based proteomic profiling probes based on the depalmitoylation inhibitors palmostatin B and M have been synthesized and were found to target acyl protein thioesterase 1 (APT1) and 2 (APT2) in cells.
Acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) thioesterases play a crucial role in the metabolism of activated fatty acids, coenzyme A, and other metabolic precursor molecules including arachidonic acid and palmitic acid. These enzymes hydrolyze coenzyme A from acyl-CoA esters to mediate a range of cellular functions including β-oxidation, lipid biosynthesis, and signal transduction. Here, we present the crystal structure of a hexameric hot-dog domain-containing acyl-CoA thioesterase from Bacillus halodurans in the apo-form and provide structural and comparative analyses to the coenzyme A-bound form to identify key conformational changes induced upon ligand binding. We observed dramatic ligand-induced changes at both the hot-dog dimer and the trimer-of-dimer interfaces; the dimer interfaces in the apo-structure differ by over 20% and decrease to about half the size in the ligand-bound state. We also assessed the specificity of the enzyme against a range of fatty acyl-CoA substrates and have identified a preference for short-chain fatty acyl-CoAs. Coenzyme A was shown both to negatively regulate enzyme activity, representing a direct inhibitory feedback, and consistent with the structural data, to destabilize the quaternary structure of the enzyme. Coenzyme A-induced conformational changes in the C-terminal helices of enzyme were assessed through mutational analysis and shown to play a role in regulating enzyme activity. The conformational changes are likely to be conserved from bacteria through to humans and provide a greater understanding, particularly at a structural level, of thioesterase function and regulation.
Viruses that are of great importance for global public health, including HIV, influenza and rotavirus, appear to exploit a remarkable organelle, the peroxisome, during intracellular replication in human cells. Peroxisomes are sites of lipid biosynthesis and catabolism, reactive oxygen metabolism, and other metabolic pathways. Viral proteins are targeted to peroxisomes (the spike protein of rotavirus) or interact with peroxisomal proteins (HIV's Nef and influenza's NS1) or use the peroxisomal membrane for RNA replication. The Nef interaction correlates strongly with the crucial Nef function of CD4 downregulation. Viral exploitation of peroxisomal lipid metabolism appears likely. Mostly, functional significance and mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Recently, peroxisomes were discovered to play a crucial role in the innate immune response by signaling the presence of intracellular virus, leading to the first rapid antiviral response. This review unearths, interprets and connects old data, in the hopes of stimulating new and promising research.
Steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein related lipid transfer (START) domains are small globular modules that form a cavity where lipids and lipid hormones bind. These domains can transport ligands to facilitate lipid exchange between biological membranes, and they have been postulated to modulate the activity of other domains of the protein in response to ligand binding. More than a dozen human genes encode START domains, and several of them are implicated in a disease.
We report crystal structures of the human STARD1, STARD5, STARD13 and STARD14 lipid transfer domains. These represent four of the six functional classes of START domains.
Sequence alignments based on these and previously reported crystal structures define the structural determinants of human START domains, both those related to structural framework and those involved in ligand specificity.

The Phaeodactylum tricornutum (P. tricornutum) thioesterase PtTE was encoded by a 648 bp open reading frame. The deduced 216 amino acids showed no similarity with plant acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) thioesterases and bacterial thioesterases. Southern blot analysis revealed that one copy of PtTE was present in the P. tricornutum genome, and Real-time quantitative PCR showed that PtTE was up-regulated upon nitrogen deprivation. Thioesterase activity of PtTE was established by heterologous expression of PtTE cDNA in Escherichia coli (E. coli) XL1-Blue and K27fadD88, a mutant strain of fatty acid β-oxidation pathway. The substrate specificity of PtTE was determined by fatty acid profile analyses of the culture supernatant and membrane lipid of recombinant strains. Recombinant PtTE in E.coli enhanced total fatty acid content of XL1-Blue by 21%, and also changed the fatty acid compositions of membrane lipid and culture supernatant. These changes were directed predominantly towards C18:0 and C18:1 fatty acids. Overexpression of PtTE alone in P. tricornutum did not alter the fatty acid composition of P. tricornutum, but enhanced total fatty acid content by 72%. This novel thioesterase gene shows its potential in metabolic engineering for enhancing lipid yield of microalgae. This is so far the first report of thioesterase from eukaryotic microalgae.
Reports suggest that excessive ceramide accumulation in mitochondria is required to initiate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and subsequent cell death, but how ceramide accumulates is unclear. Here we report that liver mitochondria exhibit ceramide formation from sphingosine and palmitoyl-CoA and from sphingosine and palmitate. Importantly, this activity was markedly decreased in liver from neutral ceramidase (NCDase)-deficient mice. Moreover, the levels of ceramide were dissimilar in liver mitochondria of WT and NCDase KO mice. These results suggest that NCDase is a key participant of ceramide formation in liver mitochondria. We also report that highly purified liver mitochondria have ceramidase, reverse ceramidase, and thioesterase activities. Increased accessibility of palmitoyl-CoA to the mitochondrial matrix with the pore-forming peptide zervamicin IIB resulted in 2-fold increases in palmitoyl-CoA hydrolysis by thioesterase. This increased hydrolysis was accompanied by an increase in ceramide formation, demonstrating that both outer membrane and matrix localized thioesterases can regulate ceramide formation. Also, ceramide formation might occur both in the outer mitochondrial membrane and in the mitochondrial matrix, suggesting the existence of distinct ceramide pools. Taken together, these results suggest that the reverse activity of NCDase contributes to sphingolipid homeostasis in this organelle in vivo.
In mammals, many aspects of metabolism are under circadian control. At least in part, this regulation is achieved by core-clock or clock-controlled transcription factors whose abundance and/or activity oscillate during the day. The clock-controlled proline- and acidic amino acid-rich domain basic leucine zipper proteins D-site-binding protein, thyrotroph embryonic factor, and hepatic leukemia factor have previously been shown to participate in the circadian control of xenobiotic detoxification in liver and other peripheral organs. Here we present genetic and biochemical evidence that the three proline- and acidic amino acid-rich basic leucine zipper proteins also play a key role in circadian lipid metabolism by influencing the rhythmic expression and activity of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). Our results suggest that, in liver, D-site-binding protein, hepatic leukemia factor, and thyrotroph embryonic factor contribute to the circadian transcription of genes specifying acyl-CoA thioesterases, leading to a cyclic release of fatty acids from thioesters. In turn, the fatty acids act as ligands for PPARα, and the activated PPARα receptor then stimulates the transcription of genes encoding proteins involved in the uptake and/or metabolism of lipids, cholesterol, and glucose metabolism.
Infection of the zebrafish with Mycobacterium marinum is regarded as a well-established experimental model to study the pathogenicity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Herein, a M. marinum transposon mutant library was screened for attenuated M. marinum phenotypes using a Dictyostelium discoideum assay. In one attenuated mutant, the transposon was located within tesA, encoding a putative type II thioesterase. Thin-layer chromatography analyses indicated that the tesA::Tn mutant failed to produce two major cell wall-associated lipids. Mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance clearly established the nature of missing lipids as phthioglycol diphthioceranates and phenolic glycolipids, respectively, indicating that TesA is required for the synthesis of both lipids. When injected into the zebrafish embryo bloodstream, the mutant was found to be highly attenuated, thus validating the performance and relevance of the Dictyostelium screen. Consistent with these in vivo findings, tesA::Tn exhibited increased permeability defects in vitro, which may explain its failure to survive in host macrophages. Unexpectedly, virulence was retained when bacteria were injected into the notochord. Histological and ultrastructural studies of the infected notochord revealed the presence of actively proliferating mycobacteria, leading to larval death. This work presents for the first time the notochord as a compartment highly susceptible to mycobacterial infection.
Curacin A is a polyketide synthase (PKS)-non-ribosomal peptide synthetase-derived natural product with potent anticancer properties generated by the marine cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula. Type I modular PKS assembly lines typically employ a thioesterase (TE) domain to off-load carboxylic acid or macrolactone products from an adjacent acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain. In a striking departure from this scheme the curacin A PKS employs tandem sulfotransferase and TE domains to form a terminal alkene moiety. Sulfotransferase sulfonation of β-hydroxy-acyl-ACP is followed by TE hydrolysis, decarboxylation, and sulfate elimination (Gu, L., Wang, B., Kulkarni, A., Gehret, J. J., Lloyd, K. R., Gerwick, L., Gerwick, W. H., Wipf, P., Håkansson, K., Smith, J. L., and Sherman, D. H. (2009) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 131, 16033-16035). With low sequence identity to other PKS TEs (&lt;15%), the curacin TE represents a new thioesterase subfamily. The 1.7-Å curacin TE crystal structure reveals how the familiar α/β-hydrolase architecture is adapted to specificity for β-sulfated substrates. A Ser-His-Glu catalytic triad is centered in an open active site cleft between the core domain and a lid subdomain. Unlike TEs from other PKSs, the lid is fixed in an open conformation on one side by dimer contacts of a protruding helix and on the other side by an arginine anchor from the lid into the core. Adjacent to the catalytic triad, another arginine residue is positioned to recognize the substrate β-sulfate group. The essential features of the curacin TE are conserved in sequences of five other putative bacterial ACP-ST-TE tridomains. Formation of a sulfate leaving group as a biosynthetic strategy to facilitate acyl chain decarboxylation is of potential value as a route to hydrocarbon biofuels.
Elevated levels of cardiac mitochondrial uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) and decreased cardiac efficiency (hydraulic power/oxygen consumption) with abnormal cardiac function occur in obese, diabetic mice. To determine whether cardiac mitochondrial uncoupling occurs in non-genetic obesity, we fed rats a high fat diet (55% kcal from fat) or standard laboratory chow (7% kcal from fat) for 3 weeks, after which we measured cardiac function in vivo using cine MRI, efficiency in isolated working hearts and respiration rates and ADP/O ratios in isolated interfibrillar mitochondria; also, measured were medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) and citrate synthase activities plus uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3), mitochondrial thioesterase 1 (MTE-1), adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) and ATP synthase protein levels. We found that in vivo cardiac function was the same for all rats, yet oxygen consumption was 19% higher in high fat-fed rat hearts, therefore, efficiency was 21% lower than in controls. We found that mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation rates were 25% higher, and MCAD activity was 23% higher, in hearts from rats fed the high fat diet when compared with controls. Mitochondria from high fat-fed rat hearts had lower ADP/O ratios than controls, indicating increased respiratory uncoupling, which was ameliorated by GDP, a UCP3 inhibitor. Mitochondrial UCP3 and MTE-1 levels were both increased by 20% in high fat-fed rat hearts when compared with controls, with no significant change in ATP synthase or ANT levels, or citrate synthase activity. We conclude that increased cardiac oxygen utilisation, and thereby decreased cardiac efficiency, occurs in non-genetic obesity, which is associated with increased mitochondrial uncoupling due to elevated UCP3 and MTE-1 levels.
In rodent models of diet-induced obesity, prolonged high-fat feeding increases the cellular uptake of fatty acids and causes lipotoxicity in the heart and skeletal muscle, where substrate overload to beta-oxidation generates mitochondrial stress. We examined the hypothesis that, because of its catalytic properties, acyl-CoA thioesterase (ACOT) would counteract these detrimental situations by modulating intracellular acyl-CoA levels. Rats were fed a low- or high-fat diet for up to 20 weeks, and the expressions of ACOT isoforms and fatty acid beta-oxidation enzymes were analyzed by western blotting. The expressions of ACOT1, ACOT2 and ACOT7 proteins in the heart and soleus muscle were significantly increased, by 2.0-7.6-fold, in rats fed the high-fat diet as compared with the low-fat diet group. These effects were accompanied by increases in carnitine palmitoyltransferase and acyl-CoA oxidase expression. However, ACOT was not induced in the extensor digitorum longus muscle or the liver. Subcellular fractionation of heart and soleus muscle homogenates confirmed expression of both the cytosolic and mitochondrial ACOT isoforms. These results underscore the functional relationship between ACOT and fatty acid oxidation, and suggest adaptive upregulation of ACOT to protect against fatty acid oversupply in the heart and skeletal muscle.
Acyl-CoA thioesterases (ACOTs) are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of fatty acyl-CoAs to free fatty acids and CoA-SH. In this study, we show that the expression profile of the ACOT isoforms changes remarkably during the differentiation of cultured rat brown adipocytes. Immunocytochemistry suggested that cytosolic ACOT1 was present in the preadipocytes, while mitochondrial ACOT2 was additionally expressed as the cells differentiated, concurrent with the accumulation of lipid droplets in the cytoplasm. Western blotting confirmed that, in contrast to ACOT1, the ACOT2 expression level was very low in the preadipocytes. However, after differentiation, the ACOT1 level fell to one-half of the baseline level and ACOT2 increased 18-fold. ACOT2 expression in the differentiated adipocytes was further enhanced by treatment with lipids or troglitazone. These changes in the ACOT2 expression level correlated well with changes in the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2, a mitochondrial β-oxidation enzyme. These results indicate that, in differentiating brown adipocytes, cytosolic ACOT1 becomes downregulated as the cellular use of acyl-CoA increases, while mitochondrial ACOT2 is upregulated as the β-oxidation capacity increases. ACOT isoform expression may be regulated during brown adipocyte differentiation to support the fat storage and combustion characteristics of this cell type.
Several hydrolases of the SGNH superfamily, including the lipase SrLip from Streptomyces rimosus (Q93MW7), the acyl-CoA thioesterase I TesA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Q9HZY8) and the two lipolytic enzymes EstA (from P. aeruginosa, O33407) and EstP (from Pseudomonas putida, Q88QS0), were examined for promiscuity. These enzymes were tested against four chemically different classes of a total of 34 substrates known to be hydrolysed by esterases, thioesterases, lipases, phospholipases, Tweenases and proteases. Furthermore, they were also analysed with respect to their amino acid sequences and structural homology, and their phylogenetic relationship was determined. The Pseudomonas esterases EstA and EstP each have an N-terminal domain with catalytic activity together with a C-terminal autotransporter domain, and so the hybrid enzymes EstA(N)-EstP(C) and EstP(N)-EstA(C) were constructed by swapping the corresponding N- and C-terminal domains, and their hydrolytic activities were compared. Interestingly, substrate specificity and kinetic measurements indicated a significant influence of the autotransporter domains on the catalytic activities of these enzymes in solution. TesA, EstA and EstP were shown to function as esterases with different affinities and catalytic efficacies towards p-nitrophenyl butyrate. Of all the enzymes tested, only SrLip revealed lipase, phospholipase, esterase, thioesterase and Tweenase activities.
To examine the regulation of hepatic acetogenesis in neonatal swine, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I) activity was measured in the presence of varying palmitoyl-CoA (substrate) and malonyl-CoA (inhibitor) concentrations, and [1-(14)C]-palmitate oxidation was simultaneously measured. Accumulation rates of (14)C-labeled acetate, ketone bodies, and citric acid cycle intermediates within the acid-soluble products were determined using radio-HPLC. Measurements were conducted in mitochondria isolated from newborn, 24-h (fed or fasted), and 5-mo-old pigs. Acetate rather than ketone bodies was the predominant radiolabeled product, and its production increased twofold with increasing fatty acid oxidation during the first 24-h suckling period. The rate of acetogenesis was directly proportional to CPT I activity. The high activity of CPT I in 24-h-suckling piglets was not attributable to an increase in CPT I gene expression, but rather to a large decrease in the sensitivity of CPT I to malonyl-CoA inhibition, which offset a developmental decrease in affinity of CPT I for palmitoyl-CoA. Specifically, the IC(50) for malonyl-CoA inhibition and K(m) value for palmitoyl-CoA measured in 24-h-suckling pigs were 1.8- and 2.7-fold higher than measured in newborn pigs. The addition of anaplerotic carbon from malate (10 mM) significantly reduced (14)C accumulation in acetate (P &lt; 0.003); moreover, the reduction was much greater in newborn (80%) than in 24-h-fed (72%) and 5-mo-old pigs (55%). The results demonstrate that acetate is the primary product of hepatic mitochondrial beta-oxidation in Sus scrofa and that regulation during early development is mediated primarily via kinetic modulation of CPT I.
The normal heart responds to changes in its metabolic milieu by changing relative oxidation rates of energy-providing substrates. We hypothesized that this flexibility is lost when genetically obese rats are fed a high-caloric, high-fat "Western" diet (WD). Male Zucker obese (ZO) and Zucker lean (ZL) rats were fed either control or WD composed of 10 kcal% and 45 kcal% fat, respectively, for 7 or 28 days. Cardiac triglycerides and mRNA transcript levels were measured in situ. Substrate oxidation rates and cardiac power were measured ex vivo. Hearts from ZO rats fed WD for 7 days showed decreased cardiac power and increased cardiac triglyceride content, but no change in oleate oxidation rates or mRNA transcript levels of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK-4), uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3), and mitochondrial (MTE-1) and cytosolic thioesterase-1(CTE-1). When fed WD for 28 days, ZO rats showed no further decrease in cardiac power and no further increase in intramyocardial triglyceride levels compared to ZO rats fed the same diet for 7 days only, but did show significantly increased oleate oxidation rates and transcript levels of CTE-1, MTE-1, PDK-4, and UCP-3. In contrast, hearts from ZL rats fed WD showed increased rates of oleate oxidation and increased transcript levels of the fatty acid responsive genes investigated, and no further deterioration of contractile function. We conclude that exposing a genetic model of obesity to the nutrient stress of WD results in an early reversible loss of metabolic flexibility of the heart that is accompanied by contractile dysfunction.
Respiratory muscle contractile performance is impaired by diabetes, mechanisms of which included altered carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, oxidative stress and changes in membrane electrophysiology. The present study examined to what extent these cellular perturbations involve changes in gene expression.
Diaphragm muscle from streptozotocin-diabetic rats was analyzed with Affymetrix gene expression arrays. Diaphragm from diabetic rats had 105 genes with at least +/-2-fold significantly changed expression (55 increased, 50 decreased), and these were assigned to gene ontology groups based on over-representation analysis using DAVID software. There was increased expression of genes involved in palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase activity (a component of lipid metabolism) (P = 0.037, n = 2 genes, fold change 4.2 to 27.5) and reduced expression of genes related to carbohydrate metabolism (P = 0.000061, n = 8 genes, fold change -2.0 to -8.5). Other gene ontology groups among upregulated genes were protein ubiquitination (P = 0.0053, n = 4, fold change 2.2 to 3.4), oxidoreductase activity (P = 0.024, n = 8, fold change 2.1 to 6.0), and morphogenesis (P = 0.012, n = 10, fold change 2.1 to 4.3). Other downregulated gene groups were extracellular region (including extracellular matrix and collagen) (P = 0.00032, n = 13, fold change -2.2 to -3.7) and organogenesis (P = 0.032, n = 7, fold change -2.1 to -3.7). Real-time PCR confirmed the directionality of changes in gene expression for 30 of 31 genes tested.
These data indicate that in diaphragm muscle type 1 diabetes increases expression of genes involved in lipid energetics, oxidative stress and protein ubiquitination, decreases expression of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, and has little effect on expression of ion channel genes. Reciprocal changes in expression of genes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism may change the availability of energetic substrates and thereby directly modulate fatigue resistance, an important issue for a muscle like the diaphragm which needs to contract without rest for the entire lifetime of the organism.
Mutations in human CGI-58/ABHD5 cause Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome (CDS), characterized by excessive storage of triacylglycerol in tissues. CGI-58 is an alpha/beta-hydrolase fold enzyme expressed in all vertebrates. The carboxyl terminus includes a highly conserved consensus sequence (HXXXXD) for acyltransferase activity. Mouse CGI-58 was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with two amino terminal 6-histidine tags. Recombinant CGI-58 displayed acyl-CoA-dependent acyltransferase activity to lysophosphatidic acid, but not to other lysophospholipid or neutral glycerolipid acceptors. Production of phosphatidic acid increased with time and increasing concentrations of recombinant CGI-58 and was optimal between pH 7.0 and 8.5. The enzyme showed saturation kinetics with respect to 1-oleoyl-lysophosphatidic acid and oleoyl-CoA and preference for arachidonoyl-CoA and oleoyl-CoA. The enzyme showed slight preference for 1-oleoyl lysophosphatidic acid over 1-palmitoyl, 1-stearoyl, or 1-arachidonoyl lysophosphatidic acid. Recombinant CGI-58 showed intrinsic fluorescence for tryptophan that was quenched by the addition of 1-oleoyl-lysophosphatidic acid, oleoyl-CoA, arachidonoyl-CoA, and palmitoyl-CoA, but not by lysophosphatidyl choline. Expression of CGI-58 in fibroblasts from humans with CDS increased the incorporation of radiolabeled fatty acids released from the lipolysis of stored triacylglycerols into phospholipids. CGI-58 is a CoA-dependent lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase that channels fatty acids released from the hydrolysis of stored triacylglycerols into phospholipids.
The crystal structure of the esterase EstA from the cold-adapted bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. 643A was determined in a covalently inhibited form at a resolution of 1.35 A. The enzyme has a typical SGNH hydrolase structure consisting of a single domain containing a five-stranded beta-sheet, with three helices at the convex side and two helices at the concave side of the sheet, and is ornamented with a couple of very short helices at the domain edges. The active site is located in a groove and contains the classic catalytic triad of Ser, His and Asp. In the structure of the crystal soaked in diethyl p-nitrophenyl phosphate (DNP), the catalytic serine is covalently connected to a phosphonate moiety that clearly has only one ethyl group. This is the only example in the Protein Data Bank of a DNP-inhibited enzyme with covalently bound monoethylphosphate.
Efficiency, defined as the amount of work produced for a given amount of oxygen consumed, is a key determinant of endurance capacity, and can be altered by metabolic substrate supply, in that fatty acid oxidation is less efficient than glucose oxidation. It is unclear, however, whether consumption of a high-fat diet would be detrimental or beneficial for endurance capacity, due to purported glycogen-sparing properties. In addition, a high-fat diet over several months leads to cognitive impairment. Here, we tested the hypothesis that short-term ingestion of a high-fat diet (55% kcal from fat) would impair exercise capacity and cognitive function in rats, compared with a control chow diet (7.5% kcal from fat) via mitochondrial uncoupling and energy deprivation. We found that rats ran 35% less far on a treadmill and showed cognitive impairment in a maze test with 9 d of high-fat feeding, with respiratory uncoupling in skeletal muscle mitochondria, associated with increased uncoupling protein (UCP3) levels. Our results suggest that high-fat feeding, even over short periods of time, alters skeletal muscle UCP3 expression, affecting energy production and physical performance. Optimization of nutrition to maximize the efficiency of mitochondrial ATP production could improve energetics in athletes and patients with metabolic abnormalities.
TTHA1846 is a conserved hypothetical protein from Thermus thermophilus HB8 with a molecular mass of 15.1 kDa that belongs to the thioesterase superfamily (Pfam 03061). Here, the 1.9 A resolution crystal structure of TTHA1846 from T. thermophilus is reported. The crystal structure is a dimer of dimers. Each subunit adopts the so-called hot-dog fold composed of five antiparallel beta-strands flanked on one side by a rather long alpha-helix and shares structural similarity to a number of thioesterases. Unexpectedly, TTHA1846 binds one metal ion and one ligand per subunit. The ligand density was modelled as coenzyme A (CoA). Its structure was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and electron-density mapping. X-ray absorption fine-structure (XAFS) measurement of the crystal unambiguously characterized the metal ion as zinc. The zinc ion is tetrahedrally coordinated by the side chains of Asp18, His22 and Glu50 and the CoA thiol group. This is the first structural report of the interaction of CoA with a zinc ion. From structural and database analyses, it was speculated that the zinc ion may play an inhibitory role in the enzymatic activity.
Centaurin beta5 with unclear function belongs to protein family of centaurins. Human centaurin beta5 is encoded by gene CENTB5 whose intron 14-15 contains low variable minisatellite UPS29, and mouse homolog CENTB5 in analogous intron contains imperfect microsatellite repeat (CATG)19. Earlier we found the association between an occurrence of short UPS29 alleles with some forms of Parkinson disease and epilepsy. Besides this, both human and mice CENTB5 are localized in the same synteny group with SCNN1D and ACOT7 genes which are known to be expressed predominantly in nervous system. Mutations in these genes are connected with neurodegenerative processes and epilepsy. It is known that intra-intronic sequences can modulate genes of their location and neighbor and even remote genes. Using RT-PCR we carried out simultaneous analysis of CENTB5, SCNN1D and ACOT7 genes expression. Potential possibility of human intra-intronic tandem repeat UPS29 and of mouse intra-intronic tandem repeat (CATG)19 to regulate/modulate CENTB5, SCNN1D and ACOT7 activity was evaluated in silico. It was found that all these genes were expressed in all studied organs and tissues. It is suggested that minisatellite locus UPS29 can regulate an activity of CENTB5, SCNN1D and ACOT7 in nervous system cells.
Herein, we report on an in vitro kinetic activity analysis that demonstrates that the protein known as the Akt C-terminal modulator protein is a broad-range, high-activity acyl-CoA thioesterase. In vitro tests of possible activity regulation by product inhibition or by Akt1 binding gave negative results. Truncation mutants confined the thioesterase activity to the C-terminal domain, consistent with our threading model. The N-terminal domain of unknown fold and function was found to contribute to solubility.
Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) catalyzes the condensation of l-serine and palmitoyl-CoA, which is the rate-limiting step in the de novo synthesis of sphingolipids. SPT activity is commonly measured by monitoring the incorporation of radiolabeled l-serine into 3-ketodihydrosphingosine. In this article, we introduce several adaptations of the established protocol to improve sensitivity, reproducibility, and practicability of the assay. A significant improvement of this new protocol is the possibility to measure SPT activity in total cell lysate instead of microsomes. The assay is furthermore extended by the introduction of a nonradioactive, HPLC-based detection protocol. The suggested HPLC method offers several advantages, most importantly, a 20-fold lower detection limit compared with the radioactive assay and the possibility to use an internal standard to correct for variation in the extraction.
Crystallography is commonly used for studying the structures of protein-protein complexes. However, a crystal structure does not define a unique protein-protein interface, and distinguishing a 'biological interface' from 'crystal contacts' is often not straightforward. A number of computational approaches exist for distinguishing them, but their error rate is high, emphasizing the need to obtain further data on the biological interface using complementary structural and functional approaches. In addition to reviewing the computational and experimental approaches for addressing this problem, we highlight two relevant examples. The first example from our laboratory involves the structure of acyl-CoA thioesterase 7, where each domain of this two-domain protein was crystallized separately, but both yielded a non-functional assembly. The structure of the full-length protein was uncovered using a combination of complementary approaches including chemical cross-linking, analytical ultracentrifugation and mutagenesis. The second example involves the platelet glycoprotein Ibalpha-thrombin complex. Two groups reported the crystal structures of this complex, but all the interacting interfaces differed between the two structures. Our computational analysis did not fully resolve the reasons for the discrepancies, but provided interesting insights into the system. This review highlights the need to complement crystallographic studies with complementary experimental and computational approaches.
Gene fscTE, encoding a putative type II thioesterase (TEII), was associated with the FR-008/candicidin gene cluster. Deletion of fscTE reduced approximately 90% of the FR-008/candicidin production, while the production level was well restored when fscTE was added back to the mutant in trans. FscTE was unable to compensate for the release of the maturely elongated polyketide as site-directed inactivation of the type I thioesterase (TEI) totally abolished FR-008/candicidin production. Direct biochemical analysis of FscTE in parallel with its homologue TylO from the tylosin biosynthetic pathway demonstrated their remarkable preferences for acyl-thioesters (i.e., propionyl-S-N-acetylcysteamine [SNAC] over methylmalonyl-SNAC and acetyl-SNAC over malonyl-SNAC) and thus concluded that TEII could maintain effective polyketide biosynthesis by selectively removing the nonelongatable residues bound to acyl carrier proteins. Overexpression of FscTE under the strong constitutive ermE*p promoter in the wild-type strain did not suppress FR-008/candicidin formation, which confirmed its substrate specificity in vivo. Furthermore, successful complementation of the fscTE mutant was obtained with fscTE and tylO, whereas no complementation was detected with nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) TEII tycF and srfAD, reflecting substrate specificities of TEIIs distinctive from those of either polyketide synthases or NRPSs.
Palmitoylation is the post-translational addition of a palmitate moiety to a cysteine residue through a covalent thioester bond. The addition and removal of this modification is controlled by both palmitoyl acyl-transferases and thioesterases. Using bioinformatic analysis, we identified 22 DHHC family palmitoyl acyl-transferase homologs in the Drosophila genome. We used in situ hybridization,RT-PCR, and published FlyAtlas microarray data to characterize the expression patterns of all 22 fly homologs. Our results indicate that all are expressed genes, but several, including CG1407, CG4676, CG5620, CG6017/dHIP14, CG6618, CG6627 and CG17257 appear to be enriched in neural tissues suggesting that they are important for neural function. Furthermore, we have found that several may be expressed in a sex-specific manner with adult male specific expression of CG4483 and CG17195. Using tagged versions of the DHHC genes, we demonstrate that fly DHHC proteins are primarily located in either the Golgi Apparatus or Endoplasmic Reticulum in S2 cells, except for CG1407, which was found on the plasma membrane. We also characterized the subcellular localization and expression of the three known thioesterases: Palmitoyl-protein Thioesterase 1 (Ppt1), Palmitoyl-protein Thioesterase 2 (Ppt2)and Acyl-protein Thioesterase 1 (APT1). Our results indicate that Ppt1 and Ppt2 are the major lysosomal thioesterases while APT1 is the likely cytoplasmic thioesterase. Finally, in vivo rescue experiments show that Ppt2 expression cannot rescue the neural inclusion phenotypes associated with loss of Ppt1, further supporting distinct functions and substrates for these two thioesterases. These results will serve as the basis for a more complete understanding of the protein palmitoylome's normal cellular functions in the fly and will lead to further insights into the molecular etiology of diseases associated with the mis-regulation of palmitoylation.
The objective of this study was to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the thioesterase (TE) domain of the bovine fatty acid synthase (FASN) gene and to evaluate the extent to which they were associated with beef fatty acid composition. The four exons in FASN that encode for the TE domain were sequenced, and three SNPs, AF285607:g.17924A&gt;G, g.18663T&gt;C and g.18727C&gt;T, were identified. Purebred Angus bulls (n = 331) were classified into three genotype groups, g.17924AA (n = 121), g.17924AG (n = 168) and g.17924GG (n = 42). The g.17924A&gt;G genotype was significantly associated with fatty acid composition of longissimus dorsi muscle of Angus bulls. Cattle with the g.17924GG genotype had lower myristic acid (C14:0; P &lt; 0.0001), palmitic acid (C16:0, P &lt; 0.05) and total saturated fatty acid contents (P &lt; 0.01), greater health index (P &lt; 0.001), oleic acid content (C18:1; P &lt; 0.001) and total monounsaturated fatty acid concentration (P &lt; 0.01) in the total lipids and triacylglycerols fraction than did those with the g.17924AA genotype. Because of the linkage disequilibrium between SNPs g.17924A&gt;G and g.18663T&gt;C, similar significant associations of fatty acid contents with the g.18663T&gt;C genotypes were observed. In conclusion, the SNPs g.17924A&gt;G and g.18663T&gt;C may be used as DNA markers to select breeding stock that have a healthier fatty acid composition.
Lipidosin is an 80-kDa protein with long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase activity expressed in the brain, adrenal gland, testis, and ovary, which are selectively damaged in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD). Western blot analysis of the cerebrum and cerebellum revealed a gradual increase in the expression of lipidosin postnatally. Light microscopic immunohistochemistry using a panel of specific monoclonal antibodies showed that the lipidosin-immunopositive cells were ubiquitously distributed in the brain and were denser in the gray matter than in the white matter. Lipidosin immunoreactivity was colocalized with GFAP immunoreactivity but not with ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase 1 (= PGP9.5) immunoreactivity, a neuronal marker, and lipidosin-producing cells detected by an antisense probe specific for lipidosin mRNA were also GFAP immunopositive. These data together with Western blot analysis of primary cultured astrocytes indicate that lipidosin is expressed in astrocytes. Immunoelectron microscopic analysis revealed that lipidosin immunoreactivity was widely distributed from perivascular endfeet to perisynaptic processes without being limited to peroxisomes. Lipidosin immunoreactivity was greatly increased in astrocytes in the area of remyelination following experimental demyelination induced by the administration of cuprizone to mice. These data suggest that lipidosin was involved in fatty acid metabolism during reconstruction of the myelin sheath.
Although the authors recently reported that nafamostat, a clinically used serine protease inhibitor, was mainly hydrolysed by carboxylesterase in human liver microsomes, the involvement of human liver cytosol has not been elucidated. The current study examined the in vitro metabolism of nafamostat with human liver cytosols. Kinetic analysis indicated that the Vmax and Km values in the liver cytosols were 9.82 nmolmin(-1) mg(-1) protein and 197 microM for a liver sample HL-1, and 15.1 nmolmin(-1) mg(-1) protein and 157 microM for HL-2, respectively. The Vmax/Km values in both cytosols were at least threefold higher than those in the corresponding microsomes. The liver cytosolic activity for nafamostat hydrolysis was inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (43% inhibition at 100 microM), whereas diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) and bis(p-nitrophenyl)phosphate (BNPP) failed to inhibit the activity. Furthermore, the hydrolytic activity was also reduced by palmitoyl-CoA (67% inhibition at 100 microM) but not by acetyl-CoA. Effects of PMSF, DFP and BNPP on cytosolic palmitoyl-CoA hydrolytic activity were comparable with those of the cytosolic nafamostat hydrolytic activity. In addition, the palmitoyl-CoA hydrolytic activity was competitively inhibited by nafamostat with the apparent Ki value of 164 microM for the liver cytosol from HL-2. These results suggest that an isoform of long-chain acyl-CoA hydrolase may be responsible for the nafamostat hydrolysis in human liver cytosol.
Acyl-CoA thioesterases (Acots) catalyze the hydrolysis of fatty acyl-CoA to free fatty acid and CoA and thereby regulate lipid metabolism and cellular signaling. We present a comprehensive structural and functional characterization of mouse acyl-CoA thioesterase 7 (Acot7). Whereas prokaryotic homologues possess a single thioesterase domain, mammalian Acot7 contains a pair of domains in tandem. We determined the crystal structures of both the N- and C-terminal domains of the mouse enzyme, and inferred the structure of the full-length enzyme using a combination of chemical cross-linking, mass spectrometry, and molecular modeling. The quaternary arrangement in Acot7 features a trimer of hotdog fold dimers. Both domains of Acot7 are required for activity, but only one of two possible active sites in the dimer is functional. Asn-24 and Asp-213 (from N- and C-domains, respectively) were identified as the catalytic residues through site-directed mutagenesis. An enzyme with higher activity than wild-type Acot7 was obtained by mutating the residues in the nonfunctional active site. Recombinant Acot7 was shown to have the highest activity toward arachidonoyl-CoA, suggesting a function in eicosanoid metabolism. In line with the proposal, Acot7 was shown to be highly expressed in macrophages and up-regulated by lipopolysaccharide. Overexpression of Acot7 in a macrophage cell line modified the production of prostaglandins D2 and E2. Together, the results link the molecular and cellular functions of Acot7 and identify the enzyme as a candidate drug target in inflammatory disease.
Rv0098 is part of an operon, Rv0096-Rv0101, from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) that is essential for Mtb's survival in mouse macrophages. This operon also contains an acyl carrier protein and one of the only two nonribosomal peptide synthases in Mtb. Rv0098 is annotated in the genome as a hypothetical protein and was proposed to be an acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) dehydratase. The structure of Rv0098, together with subsequent biochemical analysis, indicated that Rv0098 is a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA thioesterase (FcoT). However, FcoT lacks a general base or a nucleophile that is always found in the catalytic site of type II and type I thioesterases, respectively. The active site of Mtb FcoT reveals the structural basis for its substrate specificity for long-chain acyl-CoA and allows us to propose a catalytic mechanism for the enzyme. The characterization of Mtb FcoT provides a putative function of this operon that is crucial for Mtb pathogenicity.
Acyl-CoA thioesterases (ACOTs) catalyze the hydrolysis of acyl-CoAs to free fatty acids and coenzyme A. Recent studies have demonstrated that one gene named Acot7, reported to be mainly expressed in brain and testis, is transcribed in several different isoforms by alternative usage of first exons. Strongly decreased levels of ACOT7 activity and protein in both mitochondria and cytosol was reported in patients diagnosed with fatty acid oxidation defects, linking ACOT7 function to regulation of fatty acid oxidation in other tissues. In this study, we have identified five possible first exons in mouse Acot7 (Acot7a-e) and show that all five first exons are transcribed in a tissue-specific manner. Taken together, these data show that the Acot7 gene is expressed as multiple isoforms in a tissue-specific manner, and that expression in tissues other than brain and testis is likely to play important roles in fatty acid metabolism.
The cytosolic acyl-coenzyme A thioesterase I (Acot1) is an enzyme that hydrolyzes long-chain acyl-CoAs of C(12)-C(20)-CoA in chain length to the free fatty acid and CoA. Acot1 was shown previously to be strongly upregulated at the mRNA and protein level in rodents by fibrates. In this study, we show that Acot1 mRNA levels were increased by 90-fold in liver by treatment with Wy-14,643 and that Acot1 mRNA was also increased by 15-fold in the liver of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha) knockout animals. Our study identified a direct repeat 1 (DR1) located in the Acot1 gene promoter in mouse, which binds the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) and HNF4alpha. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showed that the identified DR1 bound PPARalpha/retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRalpha) and HNF4alpha, whereas the binding in ChIP was abrogated in the PPARalpha and HNF4alpha knockout mouse models. Reporter gene assays showed activation of the Acot1 promoter in cells by the PPARalpha agonist Wy-14,643 after cotransfection with PPARalpha/RXRalpha. However, transfection with a plasmid containing HNF4alpha also resulted in an increase in promoter activity. Together, these data show that Acot1 is under regulation by an interplay between HNF4alpha and PPARalpha.
SNARE proteins direct membrane fusion events required for platelet granule secretion. These proteins are oriented in cell membranes such that most of the protein resides in a cytosolic compartment. Evaluation of SNARE protein localization in activated platelets using immunonanogold staining and electron microscopy, however, demonstrated expression of SNAP-23 and syntaxin-2 on the extracellular surface of the platelet plasma membrane. Flow cytometry of intact platelets confirmed trypsin-sensitive SNAP-23 and syntaxin-2 localization to the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane. Acyl-protein thioesterase 1 and botulinum toxin C light chain released SNAP-23 and syntaxin-2, respectively, from the surface of intact platelets. When resting platelets were incubated with both acyl-protein thioesterase 1 and botulinum toxin C light chain, a complex that included both SNAP-23 and syntaxin-2 was detected in supernatants, indicating that extracellular SNARE proteins retain their ability to bind one another. These observations represent the first description of SNARE proteins on the extracellular surface of a cell.
T(3) regulates energy metabolism by stimulating metabolic rate and decreasing metabolic efficiency. The discovery of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3), its homology to UCP1, and regulation by T(3) rendered it a possible molecular determinant of the action of T(3) on energy metabolism, but data are controversial. This controversy may in part be attributable to discrepancies observed between the regulation by T(3) of UCP3 expression in rats, humans, and mice. To clarify this issue, we studied 1) the induction kinetics of the UCP3 gene by T(3) in rat skeletal muscle, 2) the influence of fatty acids, and 3) the structure and regulation of the various UCP3 promoters by T(3). Within 8 h of single-dose T(3) administration, hypothyroid rats showed a rise in serum fatty acid levels concomitant with a rapid increase in UCP3 expression in gastrocnemius muscle, followed by inductions of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta (PPARdelta) (within 24 h) and PPAR target gene expression (after 24 h). This T(3)-induced early UCP3 expression depended on fatty acid-PPAR signaling because depleting serum fatty acid levels abolished its expression, restorable by administration of the PPARdelta agonist L165,041 (4-[3-(4-acetyl-3-hydroxy-2-propylphenoxy)propoxy]phenoxy]acetic acid). In transfected rat L6 myoblasts, only the rat UCP3 promoter positively responded to T(3) and L165,041 together in the presence of MyoD, thyroid hormone receptor beta1 (TRbeta1), PPARdelta, or PPARdelta plus the TR dimerization partner retinoid X receptor alpha. All promoters share a response element common to TR and PPAR (TRE 1), but the observed species differences may be attributable to different localizations of the MyoD response element, which in the rat maps to exon 1.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha) is a transcriptional regulator of the expression of mitochondrial thioesterase I (MTE-I) and uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3), which are induced in the heart at the mRNA level in response to diabetes. Little is known about the regulation of protein expression of MTE-I and UCP3 or about MTE-I activity; thus, we investigated the effects of diabetes and treatment with a PPAR alpha agonist on these parameters. Rats were either made diabetic with streptozotocin (55 mg/kg ip) and maintained for 10-14 days or treated with the PPAR alpha agonist fenofibrate (300 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks. MTE-I and UCP3 protein expression, MTE-1 activity, palmitate export, and oxidative phosphorylation were measured in isolated cardiac mitochondria. Diabetes and fenofibrate increased cardiac MTE-I mRNA, protein, and activity ( approximately 4-fold compared with controls). This increase in activity was matched by a 6-fold increase in palmitate export in fenofibrate-treated animals, despite there being no effect in either group on UCP3 protein expression. Both diabetes and fenofibrate caused significant decreases in state III respiration of isolated mitochondria with pyruvate + malate as the substrate, but only diabetes reduced state III rates with palmitoylcarnitine. Both diabetes and specific PPAR alpha activation increased MTE-I protein, activity, and palmitate export in the heart, with little effect on UCP3 protein expression.
Trimetazidine (TMZ) is effective for the treatment of ischemic cardiomyopathy; however, little is known about the effect of TMZ in established injury-induced heart failure. When rats with established infarct-induced heart failure were treated for 12 weeks with TMZ there was no effect on left ventricular function or dilation, or on mRNA expression of fatty acid oxidation enzymes. On the other hand, TMZ significantly reduced atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA levels compared with untreated rats.
The maintenance of cellular levels of free fatty acids and acyl-CoAs, the activated form of free fatty acids, is extremely important, as imbalances in lipid metabolism have serious consequences for human health. Acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) thioesterases (ACOTs) hydrolyze acyl-CoAs to the free fatty acid and CoASH, and thereby have the potential to regulate intracellular levels of these compounds. We previously identified and characterized a mouse ACOT gene cluster comprised of six genes that apparently arose by gene duplications encoding acyl-CoA thioesterases with localizations in cytosol (ACOT1), mitochondria (ACOT2), and peroxisomes (ACOT3-6). However, the corresponding human gene cluster contains only three genes (ACOT1, ACOT2, and ACOT4) coding for full-length thioesterase proteins, of which only one is peroxisomal (ACOT4). We therefore set out to characterize the human genes, and we show here that the human ACOT4 protein catalyzes the activities of three mouse peroxisomal ACOTs (ACOT3, 4, and 5), being active on succinyl-CoA and medium to long chain acyl-CoAs, while ACOT1 and ACOT2 carry out similar functions to the corresponding mouse genes. These data strongly suggest that the human ACOT4 gene has acquired the functions of three mouse genes by a functional convergent evolution that also provides an explanation for the unexpectedly low number of human genes.
Lecithin retinol acyl transferase (LRAT) has the essential role of catalyzing the transfer of an acyl group from the sn-1 position of lecithin to vitamin A to generate all-trans-retinyl esters (tREs). In vitro studies had shown previously that LRAT also can exchange palmitoyl groups between RPE65, a tRE binding protein essential for vision, and tREs. This exchange is likely to be of regulatory significance in the operation of the visual cycle. In the current study, the substrate specificity of LRAT is explored with palmitoylated amino acids and dipeptides as RPE65 surrogates. Both O- and S-substituted palmitoylated analogues are excellent substrates for tLRAT, a readily expressed and readily purified form of LRAT. Using vitamin A as the palmitoyl acceptor, tREs are readily formed. The cognate of these reactions occurs in crude retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) membranes as well. RPE membranes containing LRAT transfer palmitoyl groups from radiolabeled [1-(14)C]-l-alpha-dipalmitoyl diphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) to RPE65. Palmitoyl transfer is abolished by preincubation with a specific LRAT antagonist both in membranes and with purified tLRAT. These experiments are consistent with an expanded role for LRAT function as a protein palmitoyl transferase.
A number of reports indicate that a long-chain free fatty acid export system may be operating in mitochondria. In this study, we sought evidence of its existence in rat heart mitochondria. To determine its potential role, we also sought evidence of its activation or inhibition in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rat heart mitochondria. If confirmed, it could be a novel mechanism for regulation of long-chain fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in mitochondria. To obtain evidence of its existence, we tested whether heart mitochondria presented with palmitoyl-carnitine can generate and export palmitate. We found that intact mitochondria indeed generate and export palmitate. We have also found that the rates of these processes are markedly higher in STZ-diabetic rat heart mitochondria, in which palmitoyl-carnitine oxidation is also increased. Since mitochondrial thioesterase-1 (MTE-1) hydrolyzes acyl-CoA to CoA-SH + free fatty acid, and uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3), reconstituted in liposomes, transports free fatty acids, we examined whether these proteins are also increased in STZ-diabetic rat heart mitochondria. We found that both of these proteins are indeed increased. Gene expression profile analysis revealed striking expression of mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid transport and oxidation genes, accompanying overexpression of MTE-1 and UCP-3 in STZ-diabetic rat hearts. Our findings provide the first direct evidence for the existence of a long-chain free fatty acid generation and export system in mitochondria and its activation in STZ-diabetic rat hearts in which FAO is enhanced. We suggest that its activation may facilitate, and inhibition may limit, enhancement of FAO.
We detected a novel CLN1 mutation (c.125-15t&gt;g) in two Italian siblings. The clinical phenotype is that of a variant late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis and consisted of early-onset visual loss, psychomotor deterioration, and seizures. Ultrastructurally, granular osmiophilic deposits were found in skin biopsy of both patients. The novel mutation occurs in the acceptor sequences for splicing and leads to skipping of multiple exons. This predicts a protein lacking part or all of the active site of the enzyme and the palmitate-binding pocket. Consequently, biochemical activity of the palmitoyl protein thioesterase-1 enzyme was drastically reduced. The new mutation was not identified in a large set of ethnically matched control chromosomes. Our findings support the notion that CLN1 patients are not rare in Southern Europe and facilitate DNA-based mutation and carrier testing in this family.
The recent finding that the FDA-approved antiobesity agent orlistat (tetrahydrolipstatin, Xenical) is a potent inhibitor of the thioesterase domain of fatty acid synthase (FAS) led us to develop a concise and practical asymmetric route to pseudosymmetric 3,4-dialkyl-cis-beta-lactones. The well-documented up-regulation of FAS in cancer cells makes this enzyme complex an interesting therapeutic target for cancer. The described route to 3,4-dialkyl-beta-lactones is based on a two-step process involving Calter's catalytic, asymmetric ketene dimerization of acid chlorides followed by a facial-selective hydrogenation leading to cis-substituted-beta-lactones. Importantly, the ketene dimer intermediates were found to be stable to flash chromatography, enabling opportunities for subsequent transformations of these optically active, reactive intermediates. Subsequent alpha-epimerization and alpha-alkylation or acylation led to trans-beta-lactones and beta-lactones bearing alpha-quaternary carbons, respectively. Several of the ketene dimers and beta-lactones displayed antagonistic activity (apparent Ki in the low micromolar range) in competition with a fluorogenic substrate toward a recombinant form of the thioesterase domain of fatty acid synthase. The best antagonist, a simple phenyl-substituted cis-beta-lactone 3d, displayed an apparent Ki (2.5 +/- 0.5 microM) of only approximately 10-fold lower than that of orlistat (0.28 +/- 0.06 microM). In addition, mechanistic studies of the ketene dimerization process by ReactionView infrared spectroscopy support previous findings that ketene formation is rate determining.
Microbial fatty acids are an attractive source of precursors for a variety of renewable commodity chemicals such as alkanes, alcohols, and biofuels. Rerouting lipid biosynthesis into free fatty acid production can be toxic, however, due to alterations of membrane lipid composition. Here we find that membrane lipid composition can be altered by the direct incorporation of medium-chain fatty acids into lipids via the Aas pathway in cells expressing the medium-chain thioesterase from Umbellularia californica (BTE). We find that deletion of the aas gene and sequestering exported fatty acids reduces medium-chain fatty acid toxicity, partially restores normal lipid composition, and improves medium-chain fatty acid yields. 
Dysregulated metabolism is an emerging hallmark of cancer development, and upregulated lipid synthesis is one of the important tumor metabolic features. However, lipolysis may also contribute to cancer pathogenesis by altering free fatty acid (FFA) metabolism. In the present study, we investigated the importance of the lipolytic enzyme acyl-CoA thioesterase 8 (ACOT8) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. Bioinformatic analysis of published microarrays regarding clinical specimens revealed that both ACOT8 gene copy number and mRNA expression were increased in HCC tissues when compared to these variables in non-tumor tissues. ACOT8 silencing with specific shRNA stably expressed in Huh7 and Hep3B HCC cell lines showed that ACOT8 protein expression and overall thioesterase activity were reduced following ACOT8 knockdown. In vitro tumorigenic assays revealed that ACOT8 knockdown inhibited anchorage-dependent and ‑independent growth of HCC cell lines. This growth inhibition was partially rescued by addition of the FFA, myristic acid, indicating the importance of FFA in cancer metabolism. In summary, lipolytic enzyme ACOT8 is frequently upregulated in HCC clinical specimens. More importantly, ACOT8 silencing leads to inhibition of cell growth in HCC in vitro. 
For metabolic engineering of cyanobacteria, there is an urgent need to construct a group of efficient heterologous gene expression platforms and to evaluate their expression efficiencies. Here we constructed three integrative vectors, the pKW1188-derived pFQ9F, pFQ9R and pFQ20, for integration of heterologous genes into the genome of the model cyanobacteria strain Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803. The pFQ16, an RSF1010-derived broad host range shuttle vector, was constructed for conjugative transfer of genes to various cyanobacteria strains. All the four platforms constructed here applied the rbc (encodes Ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) and the rbc terminator to promote and terminate the gene transcription. Besides, a "Shine-Dalgarno -AUG" fusion translation strategy was used to keep the high protein translation efficiency. Using lacZ as a reporter gene, the expression efficiency of pFQ20 was evaluated and showed a strong beta-galactosidase expression (109 Miller). Furthermore, the platform pFQ20 was used to express the E. coli tesA' gene and showed significant protein bands through the Western Blot test. The expression platforms constructed in this study offer useful molecular tools for metabolic engineering of cyanobacteria in the future.
Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) biosynthesis is pertinent to production of biofuels, industrial compounds, and pharmaceuticals from renewable resources. To expand on Escherichia coli SCFA products, we previously implemented a coenzyme A (CoA)-dependent pathway that condenses acetyl-CoA to a diverse group of short-chain fatty acyl-CoAs. To increase product titers and reduce premature pathway termination products, we conducted in vivo and in vitro analyses to understand and improve the specificity of the acyl-CoA thioesterase enzyme, which releases fatty acids from CoA. A total of 62 putative bacterial thioesterases, including 23 from the cow rumen microbiome, were inserted into a pathway that condenses acetyl-CoA to an acyl-CoA molecule derived from exogenously provided propionic or isobutyric acid. Functional screening revealed thioesterases that increase production of saturated (valerate), unsaturated (trans-2-pentenoate), and branched (4-methylvalerate) SCFAs compared to overexpression of E. coli thioesterase tesB or native expression of endogenous thioesterases. To determine if altered thioesterase acyl-CoA substrate specificity caused the increase in product titers, six of the most promising enzymes were analyzed in vitro. Biochemical assays revealed that the most productive thioesterases rely on promiscuous activity but have greater specificity for product-associated acyl-CoAs than for precursor acyl-CoAs. In this study, we introduce novel thioesterases with improved specificity for saturated, branched, and unsaturated short-chain acyl-CoAs, thereby expanding the diversity of potential fatty acid products while increasing titers of current products. The growing uncertainty associated with protein database annotations denotes this study as a model for isolating functional biochemical pathway enzymes in situations where experimental evidence of enzyme function is absent. 
Increasing concerns about limited fossil fuels and global environmental problems have focused attention on the need to develop sustainable biofuels from renewable resources. Although microbial production of diesel has been reported, production of another much in demand transport fuel, petrol (gasoline), has not yet been demonstrated. Here we report the development of platform Escherichia coli strains that are capable of producing short-chain alkanes (SCAs; petrol), free fatty acids (FFAs), fatty esters and fatty alcohols through the fatty acyl (acyl carrier protein (ACP)) to fatty acid to fatty acyl-CoA pathway. First, the β-oxidation pathway was blocked by deleting the fadE gene to prevent the degradation of fatty acyl-CoAs generated in vivo. To increase the formation of short-chain fatty acids suitable for subsequent conversion to SCAs in vivo, the activity of 3-oxoacyl-ACP synthase (FabH), which is inhibited by unsaturated fatty acyl-ACPs, was enhanced to promote the initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis by deleting the fadR gene; deletion of the fadR gene prevents upregulation of the fabA and fabB genes responsible for unsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis. A modified thioesterase was used to convert short-chain fatty acyl-ACPs to the corresponding FFAs, which were then converted to SCAs by the sequential reactions of E. coli fatty acyl-CoA synthetase, Clostridium acetobutylicum fatty acyl-CoA reductase and Arabidopsis thaliana fatty aldehyde decarbonylase. The final engineered strain produced up to 580.8 mg l(-1) of SCAs consisting of nonane (327.8 mg l(-1)), dodecane (136.5 mg l(-1)), tridecane (64.8 mg l(-1)), 2-methyl-dodecane (42.8 mg l(-1)) and tetradecane (8.9 mg l(-1)), together with small amounts of other hydrocarbons. Furthermore, this platform strain could produce short-chain FFAs using a fadD-deleted strain, and short-chain fatty esters by introducing the Acinetobacter sp. ADP1 wax ester synthase (atfA) and the E. coli mutant alcohol dehydrogenase (adhE(mut)). 
Ibuprofen and related 2-arylpropanoic acid (2-APA) drugs are often given as a racemic mixture and the R-enantiomers undergo activation in vivo by metabolic chiral inversion. The chiral inversion pathway consists of conversion of the drug to the coenzyme A ester (by an acyl-CoA synthetase) followed by chiral inversion by α-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR; P504S). The enzymes responsible for hydrolysis of the product S-2-APA-CoA ester to the active S-2-APA drug have not been identified. In this study, conversion of a variety of 2-APA-CoA esters by human acyl-CoA thioesterase-1 and -2 (ACOT-1 and -2) was investigated. Human recombinant ACOT-1 and -2 (ACOT-1 and -2) were both able to efficiently hydrolyse a variety of 2-APA-CoA substrates. Studies with the model substrates R- and S-2-methylmyristoyl-CoA showed that both enzymes were able to efficiently hydrolyse both of the epimeric substrates with (2R)- and (2S)- methyl groups. ACOT-1 is located in the cytosol and is able to hydrolyse 2-APA-CoA esters exported from the mitochondria and peroxisomes for inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase-1 and -2 in the endoplasmic reticulum. It is a prime candidate to be the enzyme responsible for the pharmacological action of chiral inverted drugs. ACOT-2 activity may be important in 2-APA toxicity effects and for the regulation of mitochondrial free coenzyme A levels. These results support the idea that 2-APA drugs undergo chiral inversion via a common pathway. 
Carbon feedstocks from fossilized sources are being rapidly depleted due to rising demand for industrial and commercial applications. Many petroleum-derived chemicals can be directly or functionally substituted with chemicals derived from renewable feedstocks. Several short chain organic acids may fulfill this role using their functional groups as a target for chemical catalysis. Saccharomyces cerevisiae was engineered to produce short chain carboxylic acids (C6 to C10 ) from glucose using the heterologous Homo sapiens type I fatty acid synthase (hFAS). This synthase was activated by phosphopantetheine transfereases AcpS and Sfp from Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, respectively, both in vitro and in vivo. hFAS was produced in the holo-form and produced carboxylic acids in vitro, confirmed by NADPH and ADIFAB assays. Overexpression of hFAS in a yeast FAS2 knockout strain, deficient in de novo fatty acid synthesis, demonstrated the full functional replacement of the native fungal FAS by hFAS. Two active heterologous short chain thioesterases (TEs) from Cuphea palustris (CpFatB1) and Rattus norvegicus (TEII) were evaluated for short chain fatty acid (SCFA) synthesis in vitro and in vivo. Three hFAS mutants were constructed: a mutant deficient in the native TE domain, a mutant with a linked CpFatB1 TE and a mutant with a linked TEII TE. Using the native yeast fatty acid synthase for growth, the overexpression of the hFAS mutants and the short-chain TEs (linked or plasmid-based) increased in vivo caprylic acid and total SCFA production up to 64-fold (63 mg/L) and 52-fold (68 mg/L), respectively, over the native yeast levels. Combined over-expression of the phosphopantetheine transferase with the hFAS mutant resulted in C8 titers of up to 82 mg/L and total SCFA titers of up to 111 mg/L.
Acyl-CoA thioesterases (ACOTs) are a group of enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of fatty acyl-CoAs to free fatty acids and CoA, with the potential to regulate the intracellular levels of these molecules. In this study, we show that a cytosolic isoform, ACOT7, is expressed at a significant level in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) of mice. While crude preparations of the mesenteric visceral fat contained significant levels of palmitoyl-CoA thioesterase activity, enzyme activity was concentrated 6.9-fold in MLNs compared with the residual adipose portion after excision of MLNs. When MLN homogenates were centrifuged, 82% of the enzyme activity was recovered in the cytosolic fraction, concomitant with almost exclusive recovery of ACOT7. Immunoprecipitation using anti-ACOT7 antibody estimated that 87% of enzyme activity in the homogenates was accounted for by ACOT7. On MLN sections, the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid follicles were immunostained with the antibody. In MLNs of mice fasted for 16 h, ACOT7 levels were induced 1.8-fold, which reflected a 1.5-fold increase in enzyme activity. These findings suggest that ACOT7 may be involved in dietary intake-associated responses in fatty acid metabolism in MLNs.
Metastasis is a major cause of cancer recurrence or death. This study attempted to quantitatively identify different proteins in metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. The N/T quotient [number of metastatic lymph nodes (n)/tumor diameter (cm)] was used to select samples with an extreme metastatic phenotype. Among the six fresh frozen lung adenocarcinoma specimens, the three showing the highest N/T quotient represented the metastatic group, and others with the greatest tumor diameters without metastasis represented the non-metastatic group. After 2-dimensional electrophoresis, the significantly different protein spots were selected by image analysis and analyzed with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Acyl-CoA thioesterase 8 isoform c (ACOT8) was one of most overexpressed proteins in the metastatic group, and it was validated by Western blot and immunohistochemical staining on 108 paraffin-embedded tumor samples. High ACOT8 expression was correlated with lymph node metastasis (p=0.002), recurrence (p=0.034), predominant histologic subtypes (p=0.007), and higher stage (p=0.005). In multivariate analysis, high ACOT8 expression was significantly associated with increased risks of lymph node metastasis (p=0.009) and cancer-related death (p=0.030), independent of clinical factors. ACOT8 may be a candidate prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target of lung adenocarcinoma.
The influence of fatty acids on the β-oxidation system and thioesterase of Lactococcus lactis was investigated in this study. The results showed that fatty acids (C8:0-C16:0) significantly inhibited the growth of Lactococcus lactis, and laurate (C12:0) had the highest bactericidal effects. We detected the maximum activity of β-oxidation at different incubation times (8, 12, and 18h) to be 6.460, 7.751, and 8.203, respectively, and the maximum activity of thioesterase at different incubation times (8, 12, and 18h) to be 19.498, 27.180, and 12.800, respectively. Fatty acids were seen to induce the β-oxidation system and activity of thioesterase; decanoic acid (C10:0) and palmitic acid (C16:0) were also seen to induce the β-oxidation system of Lactococcus lactis, but the induced ability was significantly different. Octanoic acid (C8:0) and palmitic acid (C16:0) were seen to induce thioesterase activity in Lactococcus lactis. When 1mM palmitic acid (C16:0) was added to M17 broth, the activity of thioesterase increased 5-fold after 2min; however, adding octanoic acid (C8:0) changed the activity little. Evidence showed that the ability to induce the β-oxidation system and thioesterase activity was related to the fatty acids' chain lengths.
Numerous neurological diseases are associated with dysregulated lipid metabolism; however, the basic metabolic control of fatty acid metabolism in neurons remains enigmatic. Here we have shown that neurons have abundant expression and activity of the long-chain cytoplasmic acyl coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) thioesterase 7 (ACOT7) to regulate lipid retention and metabolism. Unbiased and targeted metabolomic analysis of fasted mice with a conditional knockout of ACOT7 in the nervous system, Acot7(N-/-), revealed increased fatty acid flux into multiple long-chain acyl-CoA-dependent pathways. The alterations in brain fatty acid metabolism were concomitant with a loss of lean mass, hypermetabolism, hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia, and behavioral hyperexcitability in Acot7(N-/-) mice. These failures in adaptive energy metabolism are common in neurodegenerative diseases. In agreement, Acot7(N-/-) mice exhibit neurological dysfunction and neurodegeneration. These data show that ACOT7 counterregulates fatty acid metabolism in neurons and protects against neurotoxicity.
Thioesterase activity is typically required for the release of products from polyketide synthase enzymes, but no such enzyme has been characterized in deep-sea bacteria associated with the production of polyunsaturated fatty acids. In this work, we have expressed and purified the Orf6 thioesterase from Photobacterium profundum. Enzyme assays revealed that Orf6 has a higher specific activity toward long-chain fatty acyl-CoA substrates (palmitoyl-CoA and eicosapentaenoyl-CoA) than toward short-chain or aromatic acyl-CoA substrates. We determined a high resolution (1.05 Å) structure of Orf6 that reveals a hotdog hydrolase fold arranged as a dimer of dimers. The putative active site of this structure is occupied by additional electron density not accounted for by the protein sequence, consistent with the presence of an elongated compound. A second crystal structure (1.40 Å) was obtained from a crystal that was grown in the presence of Mg(2+), which reveals the presence of a binding site for divalent cations at a crystal contact. The Mg(2+)-bound structure shows localized conformational changes (root mean square deviation of 1.63 Å), and its active site is unoccupied, suggesting a mechanism to open the active site for substrate entry or product release. These findings reveal a new thioesterase enzyme with a preference for long-chain CoA substrates in a deep-sea bacterium whose potential range of applications includes bioremediation and the production of biofuels.
Acyl-CoA thioesterases (Acots) are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of fatty acyl-CoAs to free fatty acids and coenzyme A, and have the potential to regulate the intracellular levels of these molecules. In this study, we show that a cytosolic isoform, Acot1, is expressed and distributed in immature adipocytes located in the perivascular region of the white adipose tissue (WAT) of rats. Immunoblot analyses detected Acot1 in all of the WATs examined, while immunohistochemistry revealed positively stained layered structures surrounding the adventitia of blood vessels in the subcutaneous WAT. When the subcutaneous WAT was digested with collagenase and centrifuged, Acot1 was recovered in the stromal vascular fraction (SVF), and not in the large mature adipocytes. In the SVF, undigested cells attached to short tubular fragments of blood vessels showed positive immunostaining, as well as a proportion of the dispersed cells. These fibroblast-like cells contained fine particulate lipid droplets, stained by oil-red O dye, in their cytoplasm, or expressed fatty acid-binding protein 4, an adipocyte marker. After induction of adipocyte differentiation following a 15-day preculture without insulin, the dedifferentiated cells showed increased Acot1 expression with a diffuse distribution throughout the cytosol. These findings suggest that Acot1 expression is transiently upregulated at an early stage of adipocyte maturation, possibly to maintain cytosolic acyl-CoAs below a certain level until the cells acquire their full capability for fat storage. 
Thioesterase superfamily member 2 (THEM2) is essential for cell proliferation of mammalian cells. It belongs to the hotdog-fold thioesterase superfamily and catalyzes the hydrolysis of the thioester bonds of acyl-CoA in vitro. In this study, THEM2 protein from zebrafish (fTHEM2) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by Ni-affinity and gel-filtration chromatography. fTHEM2 crystals were obtained using the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method with PEG 10 000 as precipitant. X-ray diffraction data were collected to 1.80 Å resolution using a synchrotron-radiation source. The crystals belonged to the monoclinic space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a=77.1, b=74.4, c=96.6 Å, β=93.7°.
Thioesterase superfamily member 1 (Them1; synonyms acyl-CoA thioesterase 11 and StarD14) is highly expressed in brown adipose tissue and limits energy expenditure in mice. Them1 is a putative fatty acyl-CoA thioesterase that comprises tandem hot dog-fold thioesterase domains and a lipid-binding C-terminal steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid transfer (START) domain. To better define its role in metabolic regulation, this study examined the biochemical and enzymatic properties of Them1. Purified recombinant Them1 dimerized in solution to form an active fatty acyl-CoA thioesterase. Dimerization was induced by fatty acyl-CoAs, coenzyme A (CoASH), ATP, and ADP. Them1 hydrolyzed a range of fatty acyl-CoAs but exhibited a relative preference for long-chain molecular species. Thioesterase activity varied inversely with temperature, was stimulated by ATP, and was inhibited by ADP and CoASH. Whereas the thioesterase domains of Them1 alone were sufficient to yield active recombinant protein, the START domain was required for optimal enzyme activity. An analysis of subcellular fractions from mouse brown adipose tissue and liver revealed that Them1 contributes principally to the fatty acyl-CoA thioesterase activity of microsomes and nuclei. These findings suggest that under biological conditions, Them1 functions as a lipid-regulated fatty acyl-CoA thioesterase that could be targeted for the management of metabolic disorders.
These studies investigate the role of uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) in cardiac energy metabolism, cardiac O(2) consumption (MVO(2)), cardiac efficiency (CE), and mitochondrial uncoupling in high fat (HF)-fed or leptin-deficient mice. UCP3KO and wild-type (WT) mice were fed normal chow or HF diets for 10 weeks. Substrate utilization rates, MVO(2), CE, and mitochondrial uncoupling were measured in perfused working hearts and saponin-permeabilized cardiac fibers, respectively. Similar analyses were performed in hearts of ob/ob mice lacking UCP3 (U3OB mice). HF increased cardiac UCP3 protein. However, fatty acid (FA) oxidation rates were similarly increased by HF diet in WT and UCP3KO mice. By contrast, MVO(2) increased in WT, but not in UCP3KO with HF, leading to increased CE in UCP3KO mice. Consistent with increased CE, mitochondrial coupling was increased in the hearts of HF-fed UCP3KO mice. Unexpectedly, UCP3 deletion in ob/ob mice reduced FA oxidation but had no effect on MVO(2) or CE. In addition, FA-induced mitochondrial uncoupling was similarly enhanced in U3OB compared with ob/ob hearts and was associated with elevated mitochondrial thioesterase-1 protein content. These studies show that although UCP3 may mediate mitochondrial uncoupling and reduced CE after HF feeding, it does not mediate uncoupling in leptin-deficient states.
The mammalian brown fat inducible thioesterase variant 2 (BFIT2), also known as ACOT11, is a multimodular protein containing two consecutive hotdog-fold domains and a C-terminal steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid transfer domain (StarD14). In this study, we demonstrate that the N-terminal region of human BFIT2 (hBFIT2) constitutes a mitochondrial location signal sequence, which undergoes mitochondrion-dependent posttranslational cleavage. The mature hBFIT2 is shown to be located in the mitochondrial matrix, whereas the paralog "cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA hydrolase" (CACH, also known as ACOT12) was found in the cytoplasm. In vitro activity analysis of full-length hBFIT2 isolated from stably transfected HEK293 cells demonstrates selective thioesterase activity directed toward long chain fatty acyl-CoA thioesters, thus distinguishing the catalytic function of BFIT2 from that of CACH. The results from a protein-lipid overlay test indicate that the hBFIT2 StarD14 domain binds phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate.
We wish to delineate a novel, and rapidly expanding, group of inborn errors of metabolism with neurological/muscular presentations: the defects in phospholipids, sphingolipids and long chain fatty acids biosynthesis. At least 14 disorders have been described so far. Clinical presentations are diverse but can be divided into (1) diseases of the central nervous system; (2) peripheral neuropathies; and (3) muscular/cardiac presentations. (1) Leukodystrophy and/or iron deposits in basal ganglia is a common feature of phospholipase A2 deficiency, fatty acid hydroxylase deficiency, and pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. Infantile epilepsy has been reported in GM3 synthetase deficiency. Spastic quadriplegia with ichthyosis and intellectual disability are the presenting signs of the elongase 4 deficiency and the Sjogren-Larsson syndrome caused by fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase deficiency. Spastic paraplegia and muscle wasting are also seen in patients with mutations in the neuropathy target esterase gene. (2) Peripheral neuropathy is a prominent feature in PHARC syndrome due to α/β-hydrolase 12 deficiency, and in hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy type I due to serine palmitoyl-CoA transferase deficiency. (3) Muscular/cardiac presentations include recurrent myoglobinuria in phosphatidate phosphatase 1 (Lipin1) deficiency; cardiomyopathy and multivisceral involvement in Barth syndrome secondary to tafazzin mutations; congenital muscular dystrophy due to choline kinase deficiency, Sengers syndrome due to acylglycerol kinase deficiency and Chanarin Dorfman syndrome due to α/β- hydrolase 5 deficiency. These synthesis defects of complex lipid molecules stand at the frontier between classical inborn errors of metabolism and other genetic diseases involving the metabolism of structural proteins.
Heart produces ATP through long-chain fatty acids beta oxidation.
To analyze whether in ventricular myocardium, high-fat diet may modify the expression of proteins associated with energy metabolism before myocardial function was affected.
Wistar Kyoto rats were divided into two groups: (a) rats fed standard diet (control; n = 6) and (b) rats fed high-fat diet (HFD; n = 6). Proteins from left ventricles were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis, mass spectrometry and Western blotting.
Rats fed with HFD showed higher body weight, insulin, glucose, leptin and total cholesterol plasma levels as compared with those fed with standard diet. However, myocardial functional parameters were not different between them. The protein expression of 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, acyl-CoA hydrolase mitochondrial precursor and enoyl-CoA hydratase, three long-chain fatty acid β-oxidation-related enzymes, and carnitine-O-palmitoyltransferase I was significantly higher in left ventricles from HFD rats. Protein expression of triosephosphate isomerase was higher in left ventricles from HFD rats than in those from control. Two α/β-enolase isotypes and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate isomerase were significantly increased in HFD rats as compared with control. Pyruvate and lactate contents were similar in HFD and control groups. Expression of proteins associated with Krebs cycle and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation was higher in HFD rats.
Expression of proteins involved in left ventricle metabolic energy was enhanced before myocardial functionality was affected in rats fed with HFD. These findings may probably indicate higher cardiac energy requirement due to weight increase by HFD.
Acyl coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) thioesterases hydrolyze thioester bonds in acyl-CoA metabolites. The majority of mammalian thioesterases are α/β-hydrolases and have been studied extensively. A second class of Hotdog-fold enzymes has been less well described. Here, we present a structural and functional analysis of a new mammalian mitochondrial thioesterase, Them5. Them5 and its paralog, Them4, adopt the classical Hotdog-fold structure and form homodimers in crystals. In vitro, Them5 shows strong thioesterase activity with long-chain acyl-CoAs. Loss of Them5 specifically alters the remodeling process of the mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin. Them5(-/-) mice show deregulation of lipid metabolism and the development of fatty liver, exacerbated by a high-fat diet. Consequently, mitochondrial morphology is affected, and functions such as respiration and β-oxidation are impaired. The novel mitochondrial acyl-CoA thioesterase Them5 has a critical and specific role in the cardiolipin remodeling process, connecting it to the development of fatty liver and related conditions.
Microbial biosynthesis of fatty acid like chemicals from renewable carbon sources has attracted significant attention in recent years. Free fatty acids can be used as precursors for the production of fuels or chemicals. Wild type E. coli strains produce fatty acids mainly for the biosynthesis of lipids and cell membranes and do not accumulate free fatty acids as intermediates in lipid biosynthesis. However, free fatty acids can be produced by breaking the fatty acid elongation through the overexpression of an acyl-ACP thioesterase. Since acetyl-CoA might be an important factor for fatty acid synthesis (acetate formation pathways are the main competitive pathways in consuming acetyl-CoA or pyruvate, a precursor of acetyl-CoA), and the long chain fatty acid CoA-ligase (FadD) plays a pivotal role in the transport and activation of exogenous fatty acids prior to their subsequent degradation, we examined the composition and the secretion of the free fatty acids in four different strains including the wild type MG1655, a mutant strain with inactivation of the fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway (fadD mutant (ML103)), and mutant strains with inactivation of the two major acetate production pathways (an ack-pta (acetate kinase/phosphotransacetylase), poxB (pyruvate oxidase) double mutant (ML112)) and a fadD, ack-pta, poxB triple mutant (ML115). The engineered E. coli cells expressing acyl-ACP thioesterase with glucose yield is higher than 40% of theoretical yield. Compared to MG1655(pXZ18) and ML103(pXZ18), acetate forming pathway deletion strains such as ML112(pXZ18) and ML115(pXZ18) produced similar quantity of total free fatty acids, which indicated that acetyl-CoA availability does not appear to be limiting factor for fatty acid production in these strains. However, these strains did show significant differences in the composition of free fatty acids. Different from MG1655(pXZ18) and ML103(pXZ18), acetate formation pathway deletion strains such as ML112(pXZ18) and ML115(pXZ18) produced similar level of C14, C16:1 and C16 free fatty acids, and the free fatty acid compositions of both strains did not change significantly with time. In addition, the strains bearing the fadD mutation showed significant differences in the quantities of free fatty acids found in the broth. Finally, we examined two potential screening methods for selecting and isolating high free fatty acids producing cells.
The importance of peroxisomes in lipid metabolism is now well established and peroxisomes contain approximately 60 enzymes involved in these lipid metabolic pathways. Several acyl-CoA thioesterase enzymes (ACOTs) have been identified in peroxisomes that catalyze the hydrolysis of acyl-CoAs (short-, medium-, long- and very long-chain), bile acid-CoAs, and methyl branched-CoAs, to the free fatty acid and coenzyme A. A number of acyltransferase enzymes, which are structurally and functionally related to ACOTs, have also been identified in peroxisomes, which conjugate (or amidate) bile acid-CoAs and acyl-CoAs to amino acids, resulting in the production of amidated bile acids and fatty acids. The function of ACOTs is to act as auxiliary enzymes in the α- and β-oxidation of various lipids in peroxisomes. Human peroxisomes contain at least two ACOTs (ACOT4 and ACOT8) whereas mouse peroxisomes contain six ACOTs (ACOT3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 12). Similarly, human peroxisomes contain one bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAAT), whereas mouse peroxisomes contain three acyltransferases (BAAT and acyl-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferases 1 and 2: ACNAT1 and ACNAT2). This review will focus on the human and mouse peroxisomal ACOT and acyltransferase enzymes identified to date and discuss their cellular localizations, emerging structural information and functions as auxiliary enzymes in peroxisomal metabolic pathways.
The goal of the present study was to increase the content of intracellular long-chain fatty acids in two bacterial strains, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 and Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655, by co-overexpressing essential enzymes that are involved in the fatty acid synthesis metabolic pathway. Recently, microbial fatty acids and their derivatives have been receiving increasing attention as an alternative source of fuel. By introducing two genes (accA and fabD) of P. aeruginosa into the two bacterial strains and by co-expressing with them the fatty acyl-acyl carrier protein thioesterase gene of Streptococcus pyogenes (strain MGAS10270), we have engineered recombinant strains that are efficient producers of long-chain fatty acids (C16 and C18). The recombinant strains exhibit a 1.3-1.7-fold increase in the production of long-chain fatty acids over the wild-type strains. To enhance the production of total long-chain fatty acids, we researched the carbon sources for optimized culture conditions and results were used for post-culture incubation period. E. coli SGJS17 (containing the accA, fabD, and thioesterase genes) produced the highest content of intracellular total fatty acids; in particular, the unsaturated fatty acid content was about 20-fold higher than that in the wild-type E. coli.
Mammalian acyl-CoA thioesterases (Acots) catalyze the hydrolysis of fatty acyl-CoAs to form free fatty acids plus CoA, but their metabolic functions remain undefined. Thioesterase superfamily member 1 (Them1; synonyms Acot11, StarD14, and brown fat inducible thioesterase) is a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA thioesterase that is highly expressed in brown adipose tissue and is regulated by both ambient temperature and food consumption. Here we show that Them1(-/-) mice were resistant to diet-induced obesity despite greater food consumption. Them1(-/-) mice exhibited increased O(2) consumption and heat production, which were accompanied by increased rates of fatty acid oxidation in brown adipose tissue and up-regulation of genes that promote energy expenditure. Them1(-/-) mice were also protected against diet-induced inflammation in white adipose tissue, as well as hepatic steatosis, and demonstrated improved glucose homeostasis. The absence of Them1 expression in vivo and in cell culture led to markedly attenuated diet- or chemically induced endoplasmic reticulum stress responses, providing a mechanism by which Them1 deficiency protects against insulin resistance and lipid deposition. Taken together, these data suggest that Them1 functions to decrease energy consumption and conserve calories. In the setting of nutritional excess, the overproduction of free fatty acids by Them1 provokes insulin resistance that is associated with inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress.
The crystal structure of Rv0098, a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA thioesterase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis with bound dodecanoic acid at the active site provided insights into the mode of substrate binding but did not reveal the structural basis of substrate specificities of varying chain length. Molecular dynamics studies demonstrated that certain residues of the substrate binding tunnel are flexible and thus modulate the length of the tunnel. The flexibility of the loop at the base of the tunnel was also found to be important for determining the length of the tunnel for accommodating appropriate substrates. A combination of crystallographic and molecular dynamics studies thus explained the structural basis of accommodating long chain substrates by Rv0098 of M. tuberculosis.
Acyl-ACP thioesterase enzymes, which cleave fatty acyl thioester bonds to release free fatty acids, contribute to much of the fatty acid diversity in plants. In Arabidopsis thaliana, a family of four single hot-dog fold domain, plastid-localized acyl-lipid thioesterases (AtALT1-4) generate medium-chain (C6-C14) fatty and β-keto fatty acids as secondary metabolites. These volatile products may serve to attract insect pollinators or deter predatory insects. Homologs of AtALT1-4 are present in all plant taxa, but are nearly all uncharacterized. Despite high sequence identity, AtALT1-4 generate different lipid products, suggesting that ALT homologs in other plants also have highly varied activities. We investigated the catalytic diversity of ALT-like thioesterases by screening the substrate specificities of 15 ALT homologs from monocots, eudicots, a lycophyte, a green microalga, and the ancient gymnosperm Gingko biloba, via expression in Escherichia coli. Overall, these enzymes had highly varied substrate preferences compared to one another and to AtALT1-4, and could be classified into four catalytic groups comprising members from diverse taxa. Group 1 ALTs primarily generated 14:1 β-keto fatty acids, Group 2 ALTs produced 6-10 carbon fatty/β-keto fatty acids, Group 3 ALTs predominantly produced 12-14 carbon fatty acids, and Group 4 ALTs mainly generated 16 carbon fatty acids. Enzymes in each group differed significantly in the quantities of lipids and types of minor products they generated in E. coli. Medium-chain fatty acids are used to manufacture insecticides, pharmaceuticals, and biofuels, and ALT-like proteins are ideal candidates for metabolic engineering to produce specific fatty acids in significant quantities.
Acyl-CoAs are essential intermediates in the biosynthetic pathways of a number of industrially and pharmaceutically important molecules. When these pathways are reconstituted in a heterologous microbial host for metabolic engineering purposes, the acyl-CoAs may be subject to undesirable hydrolysis by the host's native thioesterases, resulting in a waste of cellular energy and decreased intermediate availability, thus impairing bioconversion efficiency. 4-hydroxycoumarin (4HC) is a direct synthetic precursor to the commonly used oral anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin) and rodenticides. In our previous study, we have established an artificial pathway for 4HC biosynthesis in Escherichia coli, which involves the thioester intermediate salicoyl-CoA. Here, we utilized the 4HC pathway as a demonstration to examine the negative effect of salicoyl-CoA degradaton, identify and inactivate the responsible thioesterase, and eventually improve the 4HC production. We screened a total of 16 E. coli thioesterases and tested their hydrolytic activity towards salicoyl-CoA in vitro. Among all the tested candidate enzymes, YdiI was found to be the dominant contributor to the salicoyl-CoA degradation in E. coli. Remarkably, the ydiI knockout strain carrying the 4HC pathway exhibited an up to 300% increase in 4HC production. An optimized 4HC pathway construct introduced in the ydiI knockout strain led to the accumulation of 935mg/L of 4HC in shake flasks, which is about 1.5 folds higher than the wild-type strain. This study demonstrates a systematic strategy to alleviate the undesirable hydrolysis of thioester intermediates, allowing production enhancement for other biosynthetic pathways with similar issues.
Due to the strict enantioselectivity of firefly luciferase, only d-luciferin can be used as a substrate for bioluminescence reactions. Unfortunately, luciferin racemizes easily and accumulation of nonluminous l-luciferin has negative influences on the light emitting reaction. Thus, maintaining the enantiopurity of luciferin in the reaction mixture is one of the most important demands in bioluminescence applications using firefly luciferase. In fireflies, however, l-luciferin is the biosynthetic precursor of d-luciferin, which is produced from the L-form undergoing deracemization. This deracemization consists of three successive reactions: l-enantioselective thioesterification by luciferase, in situ epimerization, and hydrolysis by thioesterase. In this work, we introduce a deracemizative luminescence system inspired by the biosynthetic pathway of d-luciferin using a combination of firefly luciferase from Luciola cruciata (LUC-G) and fatty acyl-CoA thioesterase II from Escherichia coli (TESB). The enzymatic reaction property analysis indicated the importance of the concentration balance between LUC-G and TESB for efficient d-luciferin production and light emission. Using this deracemizative luminescence system, a highly sensitive quantitative analysis method for l-cysteine was constructed. This LUC-G-TESB combination system can improve bioanalysis applications using the firefly bioluminescence reaction by efficient deracemization of D-luciferin.
Acyl-CoA thioesterase 7 (ACOT7) is an intracellular enzyme that converts acyl-CoAs to FFAs. ACOT7 is induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS); thus, we investigated downstream effects of LPS-induced induction of ACOT7 and its role in inflammatory settings in myeloid cells. Enzymatic thioesterase activity assays in WT and ACOT7-deficient macrophage lysates indicated that endogenous ACOT7 contributes a significant fraction of total acyl-CoA thioesterase activity toward C20:4-, C20:5-, and C22:6-CoA, but contributes little activity toward shorter acyl-CoA species. Lipidomic analyses revealed that LPS causes a dramatic increase, primarily in bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate species containing long (≥C20) polyunsaturated acyl-chains in macrophages, and that the limited effect observed by ACOT7 deficiency is restricted to glycerophospholipids containing 20-carbon unsaturated acyl-chains. Furthermore, ACOT7 deficiency did not detectably alter the ability of LPS to induce cytokines or prostaglandin E2 production in macrophages. Consistently, although ACOT7 was induced in macrophages from diabetic mice, hematopoietic ACOT7 deficiency did not alter the stimulatory effect of diabetes on systemic inflammation or atherosclerosis in LDL receptor-deficient mice. Thus, inflammatory stimuli induce ACOT7 and remodeling of phospholipids containing unsaturated long (≥C20)-acyl chains in macrophages, and, although ACOT7 has preferential thioesterase activity toward these lipid species, loss of ACOT7 has no major detrimental effect on macrophage inflammatory phenotypes.≥.
Epigenetic mechanisms are critical for normal immune development and epigenetic alterations might therefore be possible contributors to immune diseases. To investigate if DNA methylation in whole blood is associated with total and allergen-specific IgE levels.
We performed an epigenome-wide association study to investigate the association between DNA methylation and IgE level, allergen-specific IgE and self-reported immune diseases and allergies in 728 individuals.
We identified and replicated 15 CpG sites associated with IgE, mapping to biologically relevant genes, including ACOT7, ILR5A, KCNH2, PRG2 and EPX. A total of 331 loci were associated with allergen-specific IgE, but none of these CpG sites were associated with self-reported allergies and immune diseases.
This study shows that IgE levels are associated with DNA methylation levels at numerous CpG sites, which might provide new leads for investigating the links between IgE and allergic inflammation.
Mycobacteria contain a large number of highly divergent species and exhibit unusual lipid metabolism profiles, believed to play important roles in immune invasion. Thioesterases modulate lipid metabolism through the hydrolysis of activated fatty-acyl CoAs; multiple copies are present in mycobacteria, yet many remain uncharacterized. Here, we undertake a comprehensive structural and functional analysis of a TesB thioesterase from Mycobacterium avium (MaTesB). Structural superposition with other TesB thioesterases reveals that the Asp active site residue, highly conserved across a wide range of TesB thioesterases, is mutated to Ala. Consistent with these structural data, the wild-type enzyme failed to hydrolyze an extensive range of acyl-CoA substrates. Mutation of this residue to an active Asp residue restored activity against a range of medium-chain length fatty-acyl CoA substrates. Interestingly, this Ala mutation is highly conserved across a wide range of Mycobacterium species but not found in any other bacteria or organism. Our structural homology analysis revealed that at least one other TesB acyl-CoA thioesterase also contains an Ala residue at the active site, while two other Mycobacterium TesB thioesterases harbor an Asp residue at the active site. The inactive TesBs display a common quaternary structure that is distinct from that of the active TesB thioesterases. Investigation of the effect of expression of either the catalytically active or inactive MaTesB in Mycobacterium smegmatis exposed, to the best of our knowledge, the first genotype-phenotype association implicating a mycobacterial tesB gene. This is the first report that mycobacteria encode active and inactive forms of thioesterases, the latter of which appear to be unique to mycobacteria.
Many polyketides show biological activities and have thus been applied in clinics, as food additives, and in agriculture. Type II thioesterases (TEIIs) play an important role in polyketide biosynthesis. Most TEIIs belong to α/β-hydrolase family and usually contain a catalytic triad Ser-His-Asp. In polyketide biosynthesis, TEIIs can play an editing role by removal of aberrant non-extendable acyl units in elongation steps, a starter unit selection role by removal of unfavored starter acyl units in initiation steps, and a releasing role by removal of final product in termination steps. Complementation of TEIIs has been observed and applied.
ABHD11 (α/β-hydrolase domain containing 11) is a non-annotated enzyme belonging to the family of metabolic serine hydrolases (mSHs). Its natural substrates and products are unknown. Using competitive activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) to identify novel inhibitors of human (h)ABHD11, three compounds from our chemical library exhibited low nanomolar potency towards hABHD11. Competitive ABPP of various proteomes revealed fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) as the sole off-target among the mSHs. Our fluorescent activity assays designed for natural lipase substrates revealed no activity of hABHD11 towards mono- or diacylglycerols. A broader profiling using para-nitrophenyl (pNP)-linked substrates indicated no amidase/protease, phosphatase, sulfatase, phospholipase C or phosphodiesterase activity. Instead, hABHD11 readily utilized para-nitrophenyl butyrate (pNPC4), indicating lipase/esterase-type activity that could be exploited in inhibitor discovery. Additionally, a homology model was created based on the crystal structure of bacterial esterase YbfF. In contrast to YbfF, which reportedly hydrolyze long-chain acyl-CoA, hABHD11 did not utilize oleoyl-CoA or arachidonoyl-CoA. In conclusion, the present study reports the discovery of potent hABHD11 inhibitors with good selectivity among mSHs. We developed substrate-based activity assays for hABHD11 that could be further exploited in inhibitor discovery and created the first homology-based hABHD11 model, offering initial insights into the active site of this poorly characterized enzyme. 
Astrocytes play a vital role in brain lipid metabolism; however the impact of the phenotypic shift in astrocytes to a reactive state on arachidonic acid metabolism is unknown. Therefore, we determined the impact of dibutyryl-cAMP (dBcAMP) treatment on radiolabeled arachidonic acid ([1-(14)C]20:4n-6) and palmitic acid ([1-(14)C]16:0) uptake and metabolism in primary cultured murine cortical astrocytes. In dBcAMP treated astrocytes, total [1-(14)C]20:4n-6 uptake was increased 1.9-fold compared to control, while total [1-(14)C]16:0 uptake was unaffected. Gene expression of long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (Acsl), acyl-CoA hydrolase (Acot7), fatty acid binding protein(s) (Fabp) and alpha-synuclein (Snca) were determined using qRT-PCR. dBcAMP treatment increased expression of Acsl3 (4.8-fold) and Acsl4 (1.3-fold), which preferentially use [1-(14)C]20:4n-6 and are highly expressed in astrocytes, consistent with the increase in [1-(14)C]20:4n-6 uptake. However, expression of Fabp5 and Fabp7 were significantly reduced by 25% and 45%, respectively. Acot7 (20%) was also reduced, suggesting dBcAMP treatment favors acyl-CoA formation. dBcAMP treatment enhanced [1-(14)C]20:4n-6 (2.2-fold) and [1-(14)C]16:0 (1.6-fold) esterification into total phospholipids, but the greater esterification of [1-(14)C]20:4n-6 is consistent with the observed uptake through increased Acsl, but not Fabp expression. Although total [1-(14)C]16:0 uptake was not affected, there was a dramatic decrease in [1-(14)C]16:0 in the free fatty acid pool as esterification into the phospholipid pool was increased, which is consistent with the increase in Acsl3 and Acsl4 expression. In summary, our data demonstrates that dBcAMP treatment increases [1-(14)C]20:4n-6 uptake in astrocytes and this increase appears to be due to increased expression of Acsl3 and Acsl4 coupled with a reduction in Acot7 expression.
HIV-1 Nef interacts with several cellular proteins, among which the human peroxisomal thioesterase 8 (ACOT8). This interaction may be involved in the endocytosis regulation of membrane proteins and might modulate lipid composition in membrane rafts. Nef regions involved in the interaction have been experimentally characterized, whereas structural details of the ACOT8 protein are unknown. The lack of structural information hampers the comprehension of the functional consequences of the complex formation during HIV-1 infection. We modelled, through in silico predictions, the ACOT8 structure and we observed a high charge complementarity between Nef and ACOT8 surfaces, which allowed the identification of the ACOT8 putative contact points involved in the interaction. The predictions were validated by in vitro assays through the development of ACOT8 deletion mutants. Coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence analyses showed that ACOT8 Arg(45)-Phe(55) and Arg(86)-Pro(93) regions are involved in Nef association. In addition, K91S mutation abrogated the interaction with Nef, indicating that Lys(91) plays a key role in the interaction. Finally, when associated with ACOT8, Nef may be preserved from degradation. These findings improve the comprehension of the association between HIV-1 Nef and ACOT8, helping elucidating the biological effect of their interaction. 
Encoding acyl-CoA thioesterase-7 (Acot7) is one of ∼60 genes expressed ubiquitously across tissues but relatively silenced, or disallowed, in pancreatic β-cells. The capacity of ACOT7 to hydrolyze long-chain acyl-CoA esters suggests potential roles in β-oxidation, lipid biosynthesis, signal transduction, or insulin exocytosis. We explored the physiological relevance of β-cell-specific Acot7 silencing by re-expressing ACOT7 in these cells. ACOT7 overexpression in clonal MIN6 and INS1(832/13) β-cells impaired insulin secretion in response to glucose plus fatty acids. Furthermore, in a panel of transgenic mouse lines, we demonstrate that overexpression of mitochondrial ACOT7 selectively in the adult β-cell reduces glucose tolerance dose dependently and impairs glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. By contrast, depolarization-induced secretion was unaffected, arguing against a direct action on the exocytotic machinery. Acyl-CoA levels, ATP/ADP increases, membrane depolarization, and Ca(2+) fluxes were all markedly reduced in transgenic mouse islets, whereas glucose-induced oxygen consumption was unchanged. Although glucose-induced increases in ATP/ADP ratio were similarly lowered after ACOT7 overexpression in INS1(832/13) cells, changes in mitochondrial membrane potential were unaffected, consistent with an action of Acot7 to increase cellular ATP consumption. Because Acot7 mRNA levels are increased in human islets in type 2 diabetes, inhibition of the enzyme might provide a novel therapeutic strategy.
Salinamide A belongs to a rare class of bicyclic depsipeptide antibiotics in which the installation of a (4-methylhexa-2,4-dienoyl)glycine handle across a hexadepsipeptide core contributes to its chemical complexity and biological properties. Herein, we report the genetic and biochemical basis for salinamide construction in the marine bacterium Streptomyces sp. CNB-091, which involves a novel intermolecular transesterification reaction catalyzed by a type I thioesterase. Heterologous expression studies revealed the central role of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase Sln9 in constructing and installing the distinctive acylglycine "basket handle" of salinamide. Biochemical characterization of the Sln9 thioesterase domain established that transesterification of the serine residue of desmethylsalinamide E with acylated glycyl thioesters yields desmethylsalinamide C. 
Biologically derived fatty acids have gained tremendous interest as an alternative to petroleum-derived fuels and chemical precursors. We previously demonstrated the synthesis of short chain fatty acids in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by introduction of the Homo sapiens fatty acid synthase (hFAS) with heterologous phosphopantetheine transferases and heterologous thioesterases. In this study, short chain fatty acid production was improved by combining a variety of novel enzyme and metabolic engineering strategies. The use of a H. sapiens-derived thioesterase and phosphopantetheine transferase were evaluated. In addition, strains were engineered to disrupt either the full β-oxidation (by deleting FAA2, PXA1, and POX1) or short chain-specific β-oxidation (by deleting FAA2, ANT1, and PEX11) pathways. Prohibiting full β-oxidation increased hexanoic and octanoic acid levels by 8- and 79-fold relative to the parent strain expressing hFAS. However, by targeting only short chain β-oxidation, hexanoic and octanoic acid levels increased further to 31- and 140-fold over the parent. In addition, an optimized hFAS gene increased hexanoic, octanoic, decanoic and total short chain fatty acid levels by 2.9-, 2.0-, 2.3-, and 2.2-fold, respectively, relative to the non-optimized counterpart. By combining these unique enzyme and metabolic engineering strategies, octanoic acid was increased more than 181-fold over the parent strain expressing hFAS.
Lipids are naturally derived products that offer an attractive, renewable alternative to petroleum-based hydrocarbons. While naturally produced long-chain fatty acids can replace some petroleum analogs, medium-chain fatty acid would more closely match the desired physical and chemical properties of currently employed petroleum products. In this study, we engineered Yarrowia lipolytica, an oleaginous yeast that naturally produces lipids at high titers, to produce medium-chain fatty acids. Five different acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) thioesterases with specificity for medium-chain acyl-ACP molecules were expressed in Y. lipolytica, resulting in formation of either decanoic or octanoic acid. These novel fatty acid products were found to comprise up to 40 % of the total cell lipids. Furthermore, the reduction in chain length resulted in a twofold increase in specific lipid productivity in these engineered strains. The medium-chain fatty acids were found to be incorporated into all lipid classes.
Thioesterase superfamily member 2 (THEM2) is an essential protein for mammalian cell proliferation. It belongs to the hotdog-fold thioesterase superfamily and catalyzes hydrolysis of thioester bonds of acyl-CoA in vitro, while its in vivo function remains unrevealed. In this study, Zebra fish was selected as a model organism to facilitate the investigations on THEM2. First, we solved the crystal structure of recombinant fTHEM2 at the resolution of 1.80 Å, which displayed a similar scaffolding as hTHEM2. Second, functional studies demonstrated that fTHEM2 is capable of hydrolyzing palmitoyl-CoA in vitro. In addition, injection of morpholino against fTHEM2 at one-cell stage resulted in distorted early embryo development, including delayed cell division, retarded development and increased death rate. The above findings validated our hypothesis that fTHEM2 could serve as an ideal surrogate for studying the physiological functions of THEM2. 
Seeds of members of the genus Cuphea accumulate medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs; 8:0-14:0). MCFA- and palmitic acid- (16:0) rich vegetable oils have received attention for jet fuel production, given their similarity in chain length to Jet A fuel hydrocarbons. Studies were conducted to test genes, including those from Cuphea, for their ability to confer jet fuel-type fatty acid accumulation in seed oil of the emerging biofuel crop Camelina sativa. Transcriptomes from Cuphea viscosissima and Cuphea pulcherrima developing seeds that accumulate &gt;90% of C8 and C10 fatty acids revealed three FatB cDNAs (CpuFatB3, CvFatB1, and CpuFatB4) expressed predominantly in seeds and structurally divergent from typical FatB thioesterases that release 16:0 from acyl carrier protein (ACP). Expression of CpuFatB3 and CvFatB1 resulted in Camelina oil with capric acid (10:0), and CpuFatB4 expression conferred myristic acid (14:0) production and increased 16:0. Co-expression of combinations of previously characterized Cuphea and California bay FatBs produced Camelina oils with mixtures of C8-C16 fatty acids, but amounts of each fatty acid were less than obtained by expression of individual FatB cDNAs. Increases in lauric acid (12:0) and 14:0, but not 10:0, in Camelina oil and at the sn-2 position of triacylglycerols resulted from inclusion of a coconut lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase specialized for MCFAs. RNA interference (RNAi) suppression of Camelina β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase II, however, reduced 12:0 in seeds expressing a 12:0-ACP-specific FatB. Camelina lines presented here provide platforms for additional metabolic engineering targeting fatty acid synthase and specialized acyltransferases for achieving oils with high levels of jet fuel-type fatty acids. 
Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of years of life lost. Genetic factors contribute to stroke prevalence, and candidate gene and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified variants associated with ischemic stroke risk. These variants often have small effects without obvious biological significance. Exome sequencing may discover predicted protein-altering variants with a potentially large effect on ischemic stroke risk.
To investigate the contribution of rare and common genetic variants to ischemic stroke risk by targeting the protein-coding regions of the human genome.
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) analyzed approximately 6000 participants from numerous cohorts of European and African ancestry. For discovery, 365 cases of ischemic stroke (small-vessel and large-vessel subtypes) and 809 European ancestry controls were sequenced; for replication, 47 affected sibpairs concordant for stroke subtype and an African American case-control series were sequenced, with 1672 cases and 4509 European ancestry controls genotyped. The ESP's exome sequencing and genotyping started on January 1, 2010, and continued through June 30, 2012. Analyses were conducted on the full data set between July 12, 2012, and July 13, 2013.
Discovery of new variants or genes contributing to ischemic stroke risk and subtype (primary analysis) and determination of support for protein-coding variants contributing to risk in previously published candidate genes (secondary analysis).
We identified 2 novel genes associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke: a protein-coding variant in PDE4DIP (rs1778155; odds ratio, 2.15; P = 2.63 × 10(-8)) with an intracellular signal transduction mechanism and in ACOT4 (rs35724886; odds ratio, 2.04; P = 1.24 × 10(-7)) with a fatty acid metabolism; confirmation of PDE4DIP was observed in affected sibpair families with large-vessel stroke subtype and in African Americans. Replication of protein-coding variants in candidate genes was observed for 2 previously reported GWAS associations: ZFHX3 (cardioembolic stroke) and ABCA1 (large-vessel stroke).
Exome sequencing discovered 2 novel genes and mechanisms, PDE4DIP and ACOT4, associated with increased risk for ischemic stroke. In addition, ZFHX3 and ABCA1 were discovered to have protein-coding variants associated with ischemic stroke. These results suggest that genetic variation in novel pathways contributes to ischemic stroke risk and serves as a target for prediction, prevention, and therapy.
Acyl-CoA formation initiates cellular fatty acid metabolism. Acyl-CoAs are generated by the ligation of a fatty acid to Coenzyme A mediated by a large family of acyl-CoA synthetases (ACS). Conversely, acyl-CoAs can be hydrolyzed by a family of acyl-CoA thioesterases (ACOT). Here, we have determined the transcriptional regulation of all ACS and ACOT enzymes across tissues and in response to metabolic perturbations. We find patterns of coordinated regulation within and between these gene families as well as distinct regulation occurring in a tissue- and physiologically-dependent manner. Due to observed changes in long-chain ACOT mRNA and protein abundance in liver and adipose tissue, we determined the consequence of increasing cytosolic long-chain thioesterase activity on fatty acid metabolism in these tissues by generating transgenic mice overexpressing a hyperactive mutant of Acot7 in the liver or adipose tissue. Doubling cytosolic acyl-CoA thioesterase activity failed to protect mice from diet-induced obesity, fatty liver or insulin resistance, however, overexpression of Acot7 in adipocytes rendered mice cold intolerant. Together, these data suggest distinct modes of regulation of the ACS and ACOT enzymes and that these enzymes act in a coordinated fashion to control fatty acid metabolism in a tissue-dependent manner. 
Type 1, α/β hydrolase-like thioesterase (TE) domains are essential offloading enzymes, releasing covalently bound products from fatty acid, polyketide, and non-ribosomal peptide biosynthetic complexes. The release step can occur by attack of an exogenous nucleophile effecting hydrolysis or transesterification or by an intramolecular O-, N-, or C-nucleophile, effecting macrolactonization, macrolactamization or Claisen-like condensation of the product. Thus in addition to ensuring turnover of the pathway, TEs provide access to increased chemical diversity. We review the diversity, structure, and mechanism of PKS and NRPS TEs and discuss recent works that highlight the role of TEs as potential arbitrators in offloading. In particular, we examine cases where TEs act as logic gates that ask a particular question about the substrate and use this information to determine the substrate's fate. As the TE mechanism occurs via two steps, we analyze both the loading and release steps independently as logic gates. The use of logic gates provides an important perspective when evaluating the evolution of TEs within a pathway, as well as highlighting work towards the goal of predicting TE function in unknown and engineered pathways.
Fatty acid synthase (FASN), the enzyme responsible for de novo synthesis of free fatty acids, is up-regulated in many cancers. FASN is essential for cancer cell survival and contributes to drug resistance and poor prognosis. However, it is not expressed in most nonlipogenic normal tissues. Thus, FASN is a desirable target for drug discovery. Although different FASN inhibitors have been identified, none has successfully moved into clinical use. In this study, using in silico screening of an FDA-approved drug database, we identified proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) as effective inhibitors of the thioesterase activity of human FASN. Further investigation showed that PPIs inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of cancer cells. Supplementation of palmitate, the end product of FASN catalysis, rescued cancer cells from PPI-induced cell death. These findings provide new evidence for the mechanism by which this FDA-approved class of compounds may be acting on cancer cells.
Butenoic acid is a C4 short-chain unsaturated fatty acid mainly used in the preparation of resins, pharmaceuticals, and fine chemicals. However, butenoic acid derived from petroleum is costly and unfriendly to the environment. Here, we report a novel biosynthetic strategy to produce butenoic acid by utilizing the intermediate of fatty acid biosynthesis pathway in engineered Escherichia coli. A thioesterase gene (B. thetaiotaomicron thioesterase (bTE)) from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron was heterologously expressed in E. coli to specifically convert butenoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP), a fatty acid biosynthesis intermediate, to butenoic acid. The titer of butenoic acid ranged from 0.07 to 11.4 mg/L in four different E. coli strains with varied expressing vectors. Deletion of endogenous fadD gene (encoding acyl-CoA synthetase) to block fatty acid oxidation improved the butenoic acid production in all strains to some extent. The highest butenoic acid accumulation of 18.7 mg/L was obtained in strain XP-2 (BL21-∆fadD/pET28a-bTE). Moreover, partially inhibiting the enoyl-ACP reductase (FabI) of strain XP-2 by triclosan increased butenoic acid production by threefold, and the butenoic acid titer was further increased to 161.4 mg/L by supplying glucose and tryptone in the M9 medium. Fed-batch fermentation of this strain further enhanced butenoic acid production to 4.0 g/L within 48 h. The butenoic acid tolerance assay revealed that this strain could tolerate 15-20 g/L of butenoic acid. 
The deployment of next-generation renewable biofuels can be enhanced by improving their compatibility with the current infrastructure for transportation, storage and utilization. Propane, the bulk component of liquid petroleum gas, is an appealing target as it already has a global market. In addition, it is a gas under standard conditions, but can easily be liquefied. This allows the fuel to immediately separate from the biocatalytic process after synthesis, yet does not preclude energy-dense storage as a liquid. Here we report, for the first time, a synthetic metabolic pathway for producing renewable propane. The pathway is based on a thioesterase specific for butyryl-acyl carrier protein (ACP), which allows native fatty acid biosynthesis of the Escherichia coli host to be redirected towards a synthetic alkane pathway. Propane biosynthesis is markedly stimulated by the introduction of an electron-donating module, optimizing the balance of O2 supply and removal of native aldehyde reductases. 
Acyl-CoA thioesterase (Acot)2 localizes to the mitochondrial matrix and hydrolyses long-chain fatty acyl-CoA into free FA and CoASH. Acot2 is expressed in highly oxi-dative tissues and is poised to modulate mitochondrial FA oxidation (FAO), yet its biological role is unknown. Using a model of adenoviral Acot2 overexpression in mouse liver (Ad-Acot2), we show that Acot2 increases the utilization of FA substrate during the daytime in ad libitum-fed mice, but the nighttime switch to carbohydrate oxidation is similar to control mice. In further support of elevated FAO in Acot2 liver, daytime serum ketones were higher in Ad-Acot2 mice, and overnight fasting led to minimal hepatic steatosis as compared with control mice. In liver mitochondria from Ad-Acot2 mice, phosphorylating O₂ consumption was higher with lipid substrate, but not with nonlipid substrate. This increase depended on whether FA could be activated on the outer mitochondrial membrane, suggesting that the FA released by Acot2 could be effluxed from mitochondria then taken back up again for oxidation. This circuit would prevent the build-up of inhibitory long-chain fatty acyl-CoA esters. Altogether, our findings indicate that Acot2 can enhance FAO, possibly by mitigating the accumulation of FAO intermediates within the mitochondrial matrix.
Palmitoylation describes the enzymatic attachment of a 16-carbon atom fatty acid to a target protein. Such lipidation events occur in all eukaryotes and can be of reversible (S-palmitoylation) or irreversible (N-palmitoylation) nature. In particular S-palmitoylation is dynamically regulated by two opposing types of enzymes which add (palmitoyl acyltransferases - PAT) or remove (acyl protein thioesterases) palmitate from proteins. Protein palmitoylation is an important process that dynamically regulates the assembly and compartmentalization of many neuronal proteins at specific subcellular sites. Enzymes that regulate protein palmitoylation are critical for several biological processes. To date, eight palmitoylation related genes have been reported to be associated with human disease. This review intends to give an overview on the pathological changes which are associated with defects in the palmitoylation/depalmitoylation process. 
Mandelic acid is a chiral metabolite of the industrial pollutant styrene and is used in chemical skin peels, as a urinary antiseptic and as a component of other medicines. In humans, S-mandelic acid undergoes rapid chiral inversion to R-mandelic acid by an undefined pathway but it has been proposed to proceed via the acyl-CoA esters, S- and R-2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetyl-CoA, in an analogous pathway to that for Ibuprofen. This study investigates chiral inversion of mandelic acid using purified human recombinant enzymes known to be involved in the Ibuprofen chiral inversion pathway. Both S- and R-2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetyl-CoA were hydrolysed to mandelic acid by human acyl-CoA thioesterase-1 and -2 (ACOT1 and ACOT2), consistent with a possible role in the chiral inversion pathway. However, human α-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR; P504S) was not able to catalyse exchange of the α-proton of S- and R-2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetyl-CoA, a requirement for chiral inversion. Both S- and R-2-phenylpropanoyl-CoA were epimerised by AMACR, showing that it is the presence of the hydroxy group that prevents epimerisation of R- and S-2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetyl-CoAs. The results show that it is unlikely that 2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetyl-CoA is an intermediate in the chiral inversion of mandelic acid, and that the chiral inversion of mandelic acid is via a different pathway to that of Ibuprofen and related drugs. 
In human liver, unconjugated bile acids can be formed by the action of bile acid-CoA thioesterases (BACTEs), whereas bile acid conjugation with taurine or glycine (amidation) is catalyzed by bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferases (BACATs). Both pathways exist in peroxisomes and cytosol. Bile acid amidation facilitates biliary excretion, whereas the accumulation of unconjugated bile acids may become hepatotoxic. We hypothesized that the formation of unconjugated and conjugated bile acids from their common substrate bile acid-CoA thioesters by BACTE and BACAT is regulated via the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha). Livers from wild-type and PPARalpha-null mice either untreated or treated with the PPARalpha activator WY-14,643 were analyzed for BACTE and BACAT expression. The total liver capacity of taurochenodeoxycholate and taurocholate formation was decreased in WY-14,643-treated wild-type mice by 60% and 40%, respectively, but not in PPARalpha-null mice. Suppression of the peroxisomal BACAT activity was responsible for the decrease in liver capacity, whereas cytosolic BACAT activity was essentially unchanged by the treatment. In both cytosol and peroxisomes, the BACTE activities and protein levels were upregulated 5- to 10-fold by the treatment. These effects caused by WY-14,643 treatment were abolished in PPARalpha-null mice. The results from this study suggest that an increased formation of unconjugated bile acids occurs during PPARalpha activation.
Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha) has an important role in regulating the expression of liver-specific genes. Because bile acids are produced from cholesterol in liver and many enzymes involved in their biosynthesis are preferentially expressed in liver, the role of HNF4alpha in the regulation of bile acid production was examined. In mice, unconjugated bile acids are conjugated with taurine by the liver-specific enzymes, bile acid-CoA ligase and bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAT). Mice lacking hepatic HNF4alpha expression exhibited markedly decreased expression of the very long chain acyl-CoA synthase-related gene (VLACSR), a mouse candidate for bile acid-CoA ligase, and BAT. This was associated with markedly elevated levels of unconjugated and glycine-conjugated bile acids in gallbladder. HNF4alpha was found to bind directly to the mouse VLACSR and BAT gene promoters, and the promoter activities were dependent on HNF4alpha-binding sites and HNF4alpha expression. In conclusion, HNF4alpha plays a central role in bile acid conjugation by direct regulation of VLACSR and BAT in vivo.
Bile acid CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAT) is responsible for the amidation of bile acids with the amino acids taurine and glycine. Rat liver BAT (rBAT) cDNA was isolated from a rat liver lambdaZAP cDNA library and expressed in Sf9 insect cells using a baculoviral vector. rBAT displayed 65% amino acid sequence homology with human BAT (hBAT) and 85% homology with mouse BAT (mBAT). Similar to hBAT, expressed rBAT was capable of forming both taurine and glycine conjugates with cholyl-CoA. mBAT, which is highly homologous to rBAT, forms only taurine conjugated bile acids (Falany, C. N., H. Fortinberry, E. H. Leiter, and S. Barnes. 1997. Cloning and expression of mouse liver bile acid CoA: Amino acid N-acyltransferase. J. Lipid Res. 38: 86-95). Immunoblot analysis of rat tissues detected rBAT only in rat liver cytosol following homogenization and ultracentrifugation. Subcellular localization of rBAT detected activity and immunoreactive protein in both cytosol and isolated peroxisomes. Rat bile acid CoA ligase (rBAL), the enzyme responsible for the formation of bile acid CoA esters, was detected only in rat liver microsomes. Treatment of rats with clofibrate, a known peroxisomal proliferator, significantly induced rBAT activity, message, and immunoreactive protein in rat liver. Peroxisomal membrane protein-70, a marker for peroxisomes, was also induced by clofibrate, whereas rBAL activity and protein amount were not affected. In summary, rBAT is capable of forming both taurine and glycine bile acid conjugates and the enzyme is localized primarily in peroxisomes in rat liver.
Bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BACAT) catalyzes the conjugation of bile acids to glycine and taurine for excretion into bile. By use of site-directed mutagenesis and sequence comparisons, we have identified Cys-235, Asp-328, and His-362 as constituting a catalytic triad in human BACAT (hBACAT) and identifying BACAT as a member of the type I acyl-CoA thioesterase gene family. We therefore hypothesized that hBACAT may also hydrolyze fatty acyl-CoAs and/or conjugate fatty acids to glycine. We show here that recombinant hBACAT also can hydrolyze long- and very long-chain saturated acyl-CoAs (mainly C16:0-C26:0) and by mass spectrometry verified that hBACAT also conjugates fatty acids to glycine. Tissue expression studies showed strong expression of BACAT in liver, gallbladder, and the proximal and distal intestine. However, BACAT is also expressed in a variety of tissues unrelated to bile acid formation and transport, suggesting important functions also in the regulation of intracellular levels of very long-chain fatty acids. Green fluorescent protein localization experiments in human skin fibroblasts showed that the hBACAT enzyme is mainly cytosolic. Therefore, the cytosolic BACAT enzyme may play important roles in protection against toxicity by accumulation of unconjugated bile acids and non-esterified very long-chain fatty acids.
The farnesoid X receptor (FXR; NR1H4) regulates bile acid and lipid homeostasis by acting as an intracellular bile acid-sensing transcription factor. Several identified FXR target genes serve critical roles in the synthesis and transport of bile acids as well as in lipid metabolism. Here we used Affymetrix micro-array and Northern analysis to demonstrate that two enzymes involved in conjugation of bile acids to taurine and glycine, namely bile acid-CoA synthetase (BACS) and bile acid-CoA: amino acid N-acetyltransferase (BAT) are induced by FXR in rat liver. Analysis of the human BACS and BAT genes revealed the presence of functional response elements in the proximal promoter of BACS and in the intronic region between exons 1 and 2 of the BAT gene. The response elements resemble the consensus FXR binding site consisting of two nuclear receptor half-sites organized as an inverted repeat and separated by a single nucleotide (IR-1). These response elements directly bind FXR/retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimers and confer the activity of FXR ligands in transient transfection experiments. Further mutational analysis confirms that the IR-1 sequence of the BACS and BAT genes mediate transactivation by FXR/RXR heterodimers. Finally, Fisher rats treated with the synthetic FXR ligand GW4064 clearly show increased transcript levels of both the BACS and BAT mRNA. These studies demonstrate a mechanism by which FXR regulates bile acid amidation, a critical component of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids.
Familial hypercholanemia (FHC) is characterized by elevated serum bile acid concentrations, itching, and fat malabsorption. We show here that FHC in Amish individuals is associated with mutations in tight junction protein 2 (encoded by TJP2, also known as ZO-2) and bile acid Coenzyme A: amino acid N-acyltransferase (encoded by BAAT). The mutation of TJP2, which occurs in the first PDZ domain, reduces domain stability and ligand binding in vitro. We noted a morphological change in hepatic tight junctions. The mutation of BAAT, a bile acid-conjugating enzyme, abrogates enzyme activity; serum of individuals homozygous with respect to this mutation contains only unconjugated bile acids. Mutations in both TJP2 and BAAT may disrupt bile acid transport and circulation. Inheritance seems to be oligogenic, with genotype at BAAT modifying penetrance in individuals homozygous with respect to the mutation in TJP2.
Human bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (hBAT), an enzyme catalyzing the conjugation of bile acids with the amino acids glycine or taurine has significant sequence homology with dienelactone hydrolases and other alpha/beta hydrolases. These enzymes have a conserved catalytic triad that maps onto the mammalian BATs at residues Cys-235, Asp-328, and His-362 of the human sequence, albeit that the hydrolases contain a serine instead of a cysteine. In the present study, the function of the putative catalytic triad of hBAT was examined by chemical modification with the cysteine alkylating reagent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and by site-directed mutagenesis of the triad residues followed by enzymology studies of mutant and wild-type hBATs. Treatment with NEM caused inactivation of wild-type hBAT. However, preincubation of wild-type hBAT with the substrate cholyl-CoA before NEM treatment prevented loss of N-acyltransferase activity. Substitution of His-362 or Asp-328 with alanine results in inactivation of hBAT. Although substitution of Cys-235 with serine generated an hBAT mutant with lower N-acyltransferase activity, it substantially increased the bile acid-CoA thioesterase activity compared with wild type. In summary, data from this study support the existence of an essential catalytic triad within hBAT consisting of Cys-235, His-362, and Asp-328 with Cys-235 serving as the probable nucleophile and thus the site of covalent attachment of the bile acid molecule.
Peroxisomes function in beta-oxidation of very long and long-chain fatty acids, dicarboxylic fatty acids, bile acid intermediates, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxanes, pristanic acid, and xenobiotic carboxylic acids. These lipids are mainly chain-shortened for excretion as the carboxylic acids or transported to mitochondria for further metabolism. Several of these carboxylic acids are slowly oxidized and may therefore sequester coenzyme A (CoASH). To prevent CoASH sequestration and to facilitate excretion of chain-shortened carboxylic acids, acyl-CoA thioesterases, which catalyze the hydrolysis of acyl-CoAs to the free acid and CoASH, may play important roles. Here we have cloned and characterized a peroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterase from mouse, named PTE-2 (peroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterase 2). PTE-2 is ubiquitously expressed and induced at mRNA level by treatment with the peroxisome proliferator WY-14,643 and fasting. Induction seen by these treatments was dependent on the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha. Recombinant PTE-2 showed a broad chain length specificity with acyl-CoAs from short- and medium-, to long-chain acyl-CoAs, and other substrates including trihydroxycoprostanoyl-CoA, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA, and branched chain acyl-CoAs, all of which are present in peroxisomes. Highest activities were found with the CoA esters of primary bile acids choloyl-CoA and chenodeoxycholoyl-CoA as substrates. PTE-2 activity is inhibited by free CoASH, suggesting that intraperoxisomal free CoASH levels regulate the activity of this enzyme. The acyl-CoA specificity of recombinant PTE-2 closely resembles that of purified mouse liver peroxisomes, suggesting that PTE-2 is the major acyl-CoA thioesterase in peroxisomes. Addition of recombinant PTE-2 to incubations containing isolated mouse liver peroxisomes strongly inhibited bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase activity, suggesting that this thioesterase can interfere with CoASH-dependent pathways. We propose that PTE-2 functions as a key regulator of peroxisomal lipid metabolism.
To extend our knowledge of how the synthesis of free bile acids and bile salts is regulated within the hepatocyte, bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase and bile acid-CoA thioesterase activities were measured in subcellular fractions of human liver homogenates. Some bile acids, both conjugated and unconjugated, have been reported to be natural ligands for the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), an orphan nuclear receptor. The conversion of [(14)C]choloyl-CoA and [(14)C]chenodeoxycholoyl-CoA into the corresponding tauro- and glyco-bile acids or the free bile acids was measured after high-pressure liquid radiochromatography. There was an enrichment of the N-acyltransferase in the cytosolic and the peroxisomal fraction. Bile acid-CoA thioesterase activities were enriched in the cytosolic, peroxisomal, and mitochondrial fractions. The highest amidation activities of both choloyl-CoA and chenodeoxycholoyl-CoA were found in the peroxisomal fraction (15-58 nmol/mg protein/min). The K(m) was higher for glycine than taurine both in cytosol and the peroxisomal fraction.These results show that the peroxisomal de novo synthesis of bile acids is rate limiting for peroxisomal amidation, and the microsomal bile acid-CoA synthetase is rate limiting for the cytosolic amidation. The peroxisomal location may explain the predominance of glyco-bile acids in human bile. Both a cytosolic and a peroxisomal bile acid-CoA thioesterase may influence the intracellular levels of free and conjugated bile acids.
In human liver homogenate the formation of bile acid-CoA thioesters is localized both to the microsomal fraction catalysed by an ATP-dependent synthetase and to the peroxisomal fraction catalysed by the thiolase in the last step of the beta-oxidative cleavage of the 5beta-cholestanoyl side chain. The cytosolic bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase catalyse the conjugation of the CoA-activated bile acids with taurine or glycine prior to secretion into bile. The formation of bile acid-CoA esters is considered the rate-limiting step in bile acid amidation. So far, a bile acid-CoA cleaving activity has not been assessed in the research of bile acid amidation in human liver. In this work, a bile acid-CoA cleaving activity has been demonstrated at a rate that may influence the concentration of bile acid-CoA thioesters, free bile acids and amidated bile acids within the hepatocyte. Recently, it was shown that free chenodeoxycholic acid, formed by the thioesterase, is the physiological ligand of the farnesoid X receptor. A multiorganelle distribution of the bile acid-CoA hydrolytic activity was found. In the postnuclear fraction of human liver homogenate, apparent Km and Vmax for the cleavage of choloyl-CoA were 7.7 x 10-5 mol/L and 3.6 nmol x mg-1 x min-1 respectively. The corresponding values for chenodeoxycholoyl-CoA cleavage were 7.1 x 10-5 mol/L and 4.8 nmol x mg-1 x min-1. Hydrolytic activities were detected in the microsomal and the peroxisomal fractions where the bile acid-CoA esters are formed as well as in cytosol housing the N-acyltransferase activity. Compared to the bile acid-CoA synthetase activities, the hydrolytic activities were considerably higher, both in the postnuclear fraction and in the microsomal fraction. The thioesterase activities were in the same range as detected for the N-acyltransferase activities both in the postnuclear fraction and in the cytosolic fraction. The mere presence of thioesterase in microsomes, peroxisomes and cytosol seems counterproductive to bile acid amidation. The thioesterases may have an indirect regulatory function on the bile acid synthesis and are important for the regulation of bile acid synthesis by providing free chenodeoxycholic acid, the most potent activator of the farnesoid X receptor.
We have previously reported the purification and characterization of the peroxisome proliferator-induced very-long-chain acyl-CoA thioesterase (MTE-I) from rat liver mitochondria [L.T. Svensson, S.E. H. Alexson and J.K. Hiltunen (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 12177-12183]. Here we describe the cloning of the corresponding cDNA. One full-length clone was isolated that contained an open reading frame of 1359 bp encoding a polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 49707 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence contains a putative mitochondrial leader peptide of 42 residues. Expression of the cDNA in Chinese hamster ovary cells, followed by immunofluorescence, immunoelectron microscopy and Western blot analyses, showed that the product was targeted to mitochondria and processed to a mature protein of 45 kDa, which is similar to the molecular mass of the protein isolated from rat liver mitochondria. The recombinant enzyme showed the same acyl-CoA chain-length specificity as the isolated rat liver enzyme. Sequence analysis showed no similarity to known esterases, but a high degree (approx. 40%) of identity with bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase cloned from human and rat liver. A putative active-site serine motif (Gly-Xaa-Ser-Xaa-Gly) of several carboxylesterases and lipases was identified. Western and Northern blot analyses showed that MTE-I is constitutively expressed in heart and is strongly induced in liver by feeding rats with di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate, a peroxisome proliferator, suggesting a role for the enzyme in lipid metabolism.
We have fused the open reading frames of his3-complementing genes from Saccharomyces kluyveri and Schizosac-charomyces pombe to the strong TEF gene promotor of the filamentous fungus Ashbya gossypii. Both chimeric modules and the cognate S. kluyveri HIS3 gene were tested in transformations of his3 S. cerevisiae strains using PCR fragments flanked by 40 bp target guide sequences. The 1.4 kb chimeric Sz. pombe module (HIS3MX6) performed best. With less than 5% incorrectly targeted transformants, it functions as reliably as the widely used geniticin resistance marker kanMX. The rare false-positive His+ transformants seem to be due to non-homologous recombination rather than to gene conversion of the mutated endogenous his3 allele. We also cloned the green fluorescent protein gene from Aequorea victoria into our pFA-plasmids with HIS3MX6 and kanMX markers. The 0.9 kb GFP reporters consist of wild-type GFP or GFP-S65T coding sequences, lacking the ATG, fused to the S. cerevisiae ADH1 terminator. PCR-synthesized 2.4 kb-long double modules flanked by 40-45 bp-long guide sequences were successfully targeted to the carboxy-terminus of a number of S. cerevisiae genes. We could estimate that only about 10% of the transformants carried inactivating mutations in the GFP reporter.
A mouse liver lambda Zap XR cDNA library was screened using the coding region of human bile acid CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAT) cDNA as a probe. Ten positive clones were isolated and purified, two of which apparently possessed complete open reading frames for BAT based on sequence analysis of the ends of the cDNAs. One clone (mBAT#9) was selected for sequence analysis and characterization. mBAT#9 is 1869 basepairs in length and the full-length cDNA possesses a 189 basepair 5'-nontranslated region, an open-reading frame of 1260 basepairs, and a 404 basepair 3'-nontranslated region followed by a poly(A) tail. The open-reading frame codes for a 420 amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 46,525 daltons. The structural gene for mBAT was mapped to mouse Chromosome 4. The amino acid sequence of mBAT is 69% identical and 84% similar to that of hBAT, and 86% identical and 95% similar to that of kan-1, a putative rat liver BAT. Enzymatically active mBAT was expressed in E. coli using the bacterial expression vector pKK233-2. Immunoblot analysis of expressed mBAT with rabbit anti-human BAT polyclonal antibodies detected a single protein with a molecular mass of approximately 45,000 daltons. Cytosol from cells transformed with mBAT#9/pKK233-2 possessed significant amounts of BAT-catalyzed conjugating activity with taurine as substrate but the expressed enzyme did not use glycine or fluoro-beta-alanine as substrates. The K(m) value for taurine was 1.9 mM +/- 0.1 mM in reactions with cholyl CoA as a cosubstrate. The specificity of mBAT for taurine as a substrate was confirmed by the demonstration, using HPLC-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, that mouse gallbladder bile contained only taurine conjugates of bile acids. The identification of the types of amino acid conjugates of bile acids present in mouse bile had not been previously reported. These results indicate that a taurine-specific form of BAT has been cloned and expressed from mouse liver.
We identified kan-1 complementary DNA (cDNA), the sequence of which is identical to bile acid CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAT), a liver enzyme that catalyzes the conjugation of bile acids with glycine or taurine. Kan-1(BAT) messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of the resected specimens obtained from 37 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients were studied in an attempt to evaluate prognostic significance in HCC patients after partial hepatectomy. Using Northern blot hybridization, kan-1(BAT) mRNA levels were quantified in tumorous and nontumorous tissues, and the ratio of the former to the latter was defined as the kan-1(BAT) ratio. Twelve patients had a kan-1(BAT) ratio &lt; 0.5 (low kan-1[BAT] ratio), and 25 patients had a ratio &gt;0.5 (high kan-1[BAT] ratio). The patients with a low kan-1(BAT) ratio demonstrated poorer survival than the patients with a high kan-1(BAT) ratio (P = .0013). The overall estimated hazard ratio for death in patients with a low kan-1(BAT) ratio was 68.05 according to a multivariate model (P = .0005). Thus, the kan-1(BAT) ratio may serve as a new molecular prognostic marker in HCC patients, following hepatic resection.
We isolated a cDNA clone, kan-1, from a rat liver cDNA library using a reverse transcriptase PCR cloning method. The kan-1 cDNA encoded a polypeptide of 420 amino acids, and was 70 and 69% identical in nucleotide and amino acid sequences respectively with human liver bile acid-CoA-amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAT). Thus Kan-1 is probably a rat homologue of human BAT (rBAT). Kan-1/rBAT mRNA was mainly expressed in the livers of adult rats and rats immediately after, but not before, birth. It was expressed in the hepatocytes, the sinusoidal endothelial cells and the Kupffer cells of the liver. An anti-Kan-1/rBAT polyclonal antibody detected a protein of molecular mass 46 kDa in the liver. After partial hepatectomy, the levels of Kan-1/rBAT mRNA decreased at 6 and 12 h in the regenerating liver. In a sepsis model, hepatic expression of Kan-1/rBAT mRNA decreased at 6 and 12 h after caecal ligation and puncture. The kinetics of Kan-1/rBAT mRNA expression suggests that it may play a role in acute-phase reactions.
In order to establish whether a single enzyme in human liver was capable of conjugating bile acids with both glycine and taurine, a cDNA encoding human liver bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (hBAT) has been isolated and characterized. A specific immunoaffinity-purified rabbit anti-hBAT polyclonal antibody was used to screen a lambda Zap XR human liver cDNA library resulting in the isolation of two unique clones. hBAT8 and hBAT9 (1669 and 1491 base pairs in length, respectively) were isolated following screening of 4 x 10(5) clones of the cDNA library. Restriction mapping and sequence analysis demonstrated that the cDNAs were identical except hBAT8 contained an additional 178 bases of 5' sequence; hBAT8 was completely sequenced, characterized, and used for all subsequent studies. hBAT8 consisted of a 184-nucleotide 5'-nontranslated region, an open reading frame of 1,254 bases predicting a protein of 418 amino acids with a molecular mass of 46,296 Da, and a 3'-nontranslated region of 209 nucleotides followed by a poly(A)+ tail. The identity of the cDNA was confirmed by the following findings: 1) the open reading frame began with an ATG codon and was followed by a nucleotide sequence which, when translated, corresponded exactly to the first 17 NH2-terminal amino acids of purified human liver BAT; 2) cytosol of Escherichia coli XL1-Blue cells transfected with hBAT8 subcloned into an expression vector, pKK233-2, demonstrated significant enzymatic activity for the conjugation of both taurine and glycine with cholic acid; 3) bacterial expression of hBAT8 generated a protein that comigrated with hBAT from human liver during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and cross-reacted with a specific polyclonal rabbit anti-hBAT antibody during immunoblot analysis; 4) kinetic characteristics of the expressed enzyme were very similar to those reported for purified liver BAT. These data demonstrate that a single cDNA is present in human liver which codes for a protein capable of catalyzing the conjugation of cholic acid with both glycine and taurine.
Effects of dietary manipulations on the biliary bile acid glycine:taurine (G:T) ratio and the activity of hepatic bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1) in the post-mitochondrial fraction of liver homogenates were examined in the rat. The G:T ratio in rats fed on the diet containing 100 g pectin/kg (2.18) was markedly higher than that in the animals fed on the diet containing 100 g cellulose/kg (0.09). The diets containing either 10 g cholesterol/kg or 5 g sodium cholate/kg, especially the latter, also increased the G:T ratio (0.77 and 2.33 respectively) compared with a control diet free of these steroids (0.34). When the saturating concentrations of taurine (20 mM) and glycine (100 mM) were the substrates, dietary pectin relative to cellulose significantly increased the activity of both taurine- and glycine-dependent bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase, but neither dietary bile acid nor cholesterol influenced it. In spite of the marked difference in the G:T ratio among the rats given various types of experimental diet, the bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase reaction produced taurine-but little glycone-conjugated bile acid when both taurine and glycine coexisted at physiological concentration ranges in the assay media. Dietary manipulations modified the hepatic taurine concentrations and the changes were inversely correlated with those in the G:T ratio. However, hepatic concentration of taurine (1.67-4.82 mumol/g) in rats given various types of experimental diet was comparable with or even higher than the reported Michaelis constant (Km) value of N-acyltransferase for this compound (0.8-2.5 mM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
The enzymatic formation of D-cysteinolic acid conjugated chenodeoxycholic acid in liver preparation from a marine teleost, wild and cultured red seabream, Pagrosomus major, was investigated. [24-14C]Chenodeoxycholic acid was incubated with taurine, glycine, or D-cysteinolic acid in the liver preparation in the presence of CoA, ATP, NAD+ and FAD. D-Cysteinolic acid could be conjugated efficiently with chenodeoxycholic acid to give chenodeoxycholyl-D-cysteinolic acid in both wild and cultured red seabream liver preparations, though the production rate was slower than that of the formation of chenodeoxycholyltaurine. Under the conditions employed, glycine was not utilized as the substrate for the conjugation at all. The formation of chenodeoxycholyl-D-cystenolic acid was decreased by the addition of various concentrations of taurine to the incubation mixture. These results suggest that bile acid-CoA: amino acid N-acyltransferase in red seabream is not able to distinguish taurine and D-cysteinolic acid as the substrate, probably because of their structural similarity. Consequently, D-cystenolic acid conjugated bile acids found in the bile of wild red seabream were thought to be synthesized in the liver of the fish utilizing the unusual amino acid, which originated from foods, prior to secretion into the bile.
Bile acid CoA synthetase has been discovered in rat kidney. Incubation of kidney microsomes with [14C]chenodeoxycholic acid and CoA produced a single peak with the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) retention time of CDC-CoA. This peak, when incubated with purified bile acid CoA: amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAT) from human liver and either taurine or glycine, led to the formation of CDC-taurine or CDC-glycine, respectively. Kinetic analysis revealed apparent Kms for CDC and CoA of 2.5 microM and 2.6 microM, respectively. This activity appeared specific for bile acids as it was not inhibited by benzoic acid or salicylic acid, known substrates for other rat kidney CoA synthetases. This demonstrates that the kidney has the potential for bile acid metabolism and may have a role in bile acid physiology.
A novel location of the bile-acid-conjugating enzyme bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAT) has been discovered in the cytosolic fraction of rat kidney. Both taurine and glycine were utilized as substrates. Formation of bile acid N-acyl amidates was verified by h.p.l.c. by comparison with authentic standards and by specific hydrolysis using cholylglycine hydrolase. Immunoblot analysis using a human liver anti-BAT polyclonal antibody indicated that rat kidney BAT has the same molecular mass as rat liver BAT. These findings suggest that the kidney has a role in bile acid metabolism and physiology.
The bile acid-conjugating enzyme, bile acid-CoA: amino acid N-acyltransferase, was purified 480-fold from the soluble fraction of homogenized frozen human liver. Purification was accomplished by a combination of anion exchange chromatography, chromatofocusing, glycocholate-AH-Sepharose affinity chromatography, and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) gel filtration. Following purification, the reduced, denatured enzyme migrated as a single 50-kDa protein band by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A similar molecular mass was obtained for the native enzyme by HPLC gel filtration. Elution from the chromatofocusing column suggested an apparent isoelectric point of 6.0 (+/- 0.2). Using a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the purified enzyme, Western blot analysis using 100,000 x g human liver supernatant confirmed that the affinity-purified polyclonal antibody was specific for human liver bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase. The purified enzyme utilized glycine, taurine, and 2-fluoro-beta-alanine (a 5-fluorouracil catabolite), but not beta-alanine, as substrates. Kinetic studies revealed apparent Km values for taurine, 2-fluoro-beta-alanine, and glycine of 1.1, 2.2, and 5.8 mM, respectively, with corresponding Vmax values of 0.33, 0.19, and 0.77 mumol/min/mg protein. These data demonstrate that a single monomeric enzyme is responsible for the conjugation of bile acids with glycine or taurine in human liver.
1. Bile acid CoA:amino acid:N-acyltransferase (BAT) was partially purified from dog, human, pig and rat livers. The interspecies variation in substrate specificity and kinetics were determined for glycine and taurine. 2. BAT activity from dog liver formed bile acid conjugates with taurine exclusively, whereas BAT activity from each of the other species formed conjugates with both taurine and glycine. 3. Biliary composition of glycine and taurine bile acid conjugates could partly be accounted for by substrate affinity (Km) and turnover number (Vmax) of BAT activity. 4. A monospecific anti-human BAT polyclonal antibody reacted on Western blot analysis with a 40 kDa band in a 100,000 g supernatant fraction from rat liver. 5. Immunoabsorption chromatography using an anti-human BAT antibody-Sepharose affinity column showed that both the immunoreactive protein band and BAT activity were removed from the 100,000 g supernatant fraction from human and rat livers.
Our laboratory has demonstrated recently that conjugates of 2-fluoro-beta-alanine (FBAL) and bile acids are the major biliary metabolites of 5-fluorouracil (FUra) in cancer patients. Bile acids are normally conjugated with glycine or taurine, and therefore the identification of the FBAL-bile acid conjugates suggested that FBAL may also be a substrate for the bile acid conjugating enzyme, bile acid CoA:amino acid:N-acyltransferase. Enzyme activity detected using glycine and taurine as substrates was purified 8-fold from human liver cytosol using a DEAE-cellulose column. This preparation when tested for its activity towards beta-alanine and FBAL using cholyl CoA as the bile acid substrate only catalyzed the formation of FBAL-cholate. beta-Alanine was not a substrate. Confirmation of FBAL-cholate as the enzymatic product was demonstrated by (1) coelution of the product of this reaction on HPLC with authentic FBAL-cholate, (2) specific hydrolysis of this product by cholylglycine hydrolase, and (3) molecular weight of the product (497) being identical to that of the authentic FBAL-cholate. Kinetic experiments demonstrated that the enzyme had an affinity for FBAL (Km 1.45 mM) comparable to taurine (Km 1.32 mM), but greater than glycine (Km 6.45 mM). Formation of FBAL-cholate was inhibited competitively by taurine (Ki 1.27 mM) and glycine (Ki 4.47 mM), suggesting that a single enzyme is responsible for conjugation of glycine, taurine and FBAL with bile acids. These data indicate that the formation of the FBAL-bile acid conjugates in patients receiving FUra results from high affinity of the bile acid conjugating enzyme for FBAL.
A rapid, specific, and sensitive radioassay for measuring bile acid CoA:glycine/taurine: N-acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1) has been developed. In this assay, 3H-labeled amino acids (glycine or taurine) are conjugated with unlabeled bile acid CoA derivatives to form 3H-labeled bile acid amidates. Following incubation, the 3H-labeled bile acid amidate is separated from the unreacted amino acid by an n-butanol extraction method. The extraction procedure was developed by evaluating the effects of buffer concentration and pH on the recovery of radiolabeled bile acid amidate standards in the presence of human hepatic cytosol. Highest recovery (greater than 90%) of bile acid amidate standards occurred under acidic conditions (pH 2) in the presence of 1% (w/v) SDS. When the radioassay and accompanying n-butanol extraction procedure were utilized to study the amidation of glycine or taurine with cholic acid in human hepatic cytosol, a single peak of radioactivity corresponding with either authentic glycocholate or taurocholate was detected in the n-butanol phase by high-performance liquid chromatography. This assay for bile acid CoA:glycine/taurine: N-acyltransferase activity was linear with incubation time and protein concentration. This assay should be useful in the biochemical studies of this enzyme, as well as in the examination of bile acid amidation in clinical liver specimens.
Bile acid-CoA:amino-acid N-acyltransferase activity was measured in subcellular fractions of rat liver homogenate. The conversion of [14C]choloyl-CoA and [14C]chenodeoxycholoyl-CoA into the corresponding [14C]tauro- and glyco-bile acids was calculated after isolation of the product by high performance liquid chromatography. There was an enrichment of bile acid-CoA:amino-acid N-acyltransferase activity in the light mitochondrial (L) fraction and to a lesser extent in the microsomal fraction. Surprisingly, no enrichment was found in the cytosolic fraction. Subfractionation of the L-fraction by Nycodenz gradient centrifugation, showed that the activity of the N-acyltransferase had a bimodal distribution and co-sedimented with peroxisomes (particulate catalase) and microsomes (esterase). The highest specific amidation activity of both choloyl-CoA and chenodeoxycholoyl-CoA was always found in the most peroxisome-rich fractions. [14C]Taurocholate formation in the peroxisomal fraction was 2.2 mumol/mg of protein/min. Striking differences were observed in the Km values and the saturation concentrations for glycine and taurine. The peroxisomal amidation of [14C]choloyl-CoA had a Km for taurine of 0.9 x 10(-3) M and for glycine of 17 x 10(-3) M. The results are consistent with the possibility that most of de novo synthesized bile acids conjugate to taurine by a peroxisomal bile acid-taurine N-acyltransferase in rat liver. The bile acids deconjugated in the gut and recirculating to the liver may be activated and amidated by the microsomal enzyme system prior to biliary secretion.
Bile acid-CoA:glycine-taurine N-acyltransferase was found to catalyze a reaction in the absence of glycine or taurine in which the substrate cholyl-CoA is cleaved with the release of CoA and the formation of a covalently bound enzyme-cholate intermediate. This unstable intermediate was trapped by a rapid mixing and denaturation procedure. The denatured protein was digested with trypsin and the cholate-labeled tryptic peptide was isolated. This cholate-peptide is considered to originate from the active site region of the enzyme based on the following criteria: cholyl-CoA does not react with any of the 20 common amino acids, the hydrolysis of cholyl-CoA is known to occur on the enzyme, the lack of reaction of the enzyme with just cholate, and the fact that labeling is extensive even at low (substrate level) concentrations of cholyl-CoA. The isolated cholate-peptide was submitted to amino acid analysis. It contained 32 amino acid residues and was devoid of cysteine, methionine, and tyrosine. Amino acid analysis of the N-acyltransferase was conducted. The enzyme was also shown to possess a blocked N terminus.
Administration of large doses of estrogens has been shown to result in decreased conjugation and increased sulfation of bile acids as well as cholestasis. There have been no previous studies on the effects of low doses of estrogens on these parameters of bile acid metabolism. Therefore, rats were given ethinylestradiol, 0.06 to 600 micrograms/kg/day subcutaneously for up to 21 days and the in vitro activity of the hepatic conjugation and sulfation enzymes was measured. Conjugating enzyme activity was unchanged at doses below 600 micrograms/kg/day. In contrast, hepatic sulfation of conjugated bile acids increased significantly after 21 days treatment with 0.6 micrograms/kg/day. The magnitude of the increase was both time- and dose-dependent. Increased sulfotransferase activity was noted only in the liver and was specific for conjugated bile acids; there was no change in the rate of sulfation of the unconjugated bile acids or in renal sulfotransferase activity. Increased hepatic bile acid sulfotransferase activity occurred in the presence of normal bile flow and bile acid secretion. These data indicate that treatment with doses of ethinylestradiol comparable to those present in oral contraceptives may lead to readily detectable time- and dose-dependent changes in bile acid sulfation without producing cholestasis. The data also suggest that there may be significant differences in the enzymatic sulfation of conjugated and unconjugated bile acids in the liver.
An in vitro study of bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase activity of rat liver was undertaken in order to determine whether separate amino acid-specific enzymes catalyzed the formation of glycine and taurine conjugates of bile acids as postulated by others. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of 200-fold purified enzyme localized the glycine- and taurine-dependent activities to a single band. Both activities were optimal at pH 7.8 and showed similar loss of activity at pH 6.0, pH 9.0, in the presence of 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and at temperatures exceeding 50 degrees. With the purified fraction, Km for glycine was 31 mM and Km for taurine was 0.8 mM. Km for several bile acid-CoA substrates was approximately 20 micron and independent of the amino acid acceptor. Only amino acids with terminal alpha- or beta-amino groups were active as acyl acceptors. Acyl donors were limited to bile acid-CoA derivatives. The data support the conclusion that the rat has a single bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase. The substrate kinetics are consistent with previous observations that taurine conjugates predominate in rat bile at normal hepatocellular concentrations of glycine and taurine.
An improved method for assaying choloyl-CoA synthetase activity (E.C. 6.2.1.7) and two methods for specific measurement of bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase activity (E.C. 2.3.1) are described. The methods are shown to be reproducible, linear with respect to time and enzyme protein, and result in estimates of enzymic activity that conform to the theoretical stoichiometry of the individual reactions. Utilizing these methods, the subcellular distribution of the rat liver enzymic activity catalyzing the formation of glycine and taurine conjugates of bile acids is shown. Choloyl-CoA synthetase is associated with the microsomal membranes and bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase activity with the postmicrosomal supernatant. No significant amino acid N-acyltransferase activity is present in the lysosome fraction. These studies provide methods that will permit further study of the individual enzymic reactions involved in the intrahepatic conjugation of bile acids with amino acids.
  Fish oil rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids is known to affect hepatic lipid metabolism. Several studies have demonstrated that fish oil may affect the bile acid metabolism as well as lipid metabolism, whereas only scarce data are available. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of fish oil on the gene expression of the transporters and enzymes related to bile acid as well as lipid metabolism in the liver and small intestine.
  Seven-week old male C57BL/6 mice were fed diets enriched in 10% soybean oil or 10% fish oil for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, blood, liver and small intestine were obtained.
  Hepatic mRNA expression of lipids (Abcg5/8, multidrug resistance gene product 2) and bile acids transporters (bile salt export pump, multidrug resistance associated protein 2 and 3, organic solute transporter α) was induced in fish oil-fed mice. Hepatic Cyp8b1, Cyp27a1 and bile acid CoA : amino acid N-acyltransferase were increased in fish oil-fed mice compared with soybean-oil fed mice. Besides, intestinal cholesterol (Abcg5/8) and bile acid transporters (multidrug resistance associated protein 2 and organic solute transporter α) were induced in fish oil-fed mice.
  Fish oil induced the expression of cholesterol and bile acid transporters not only in liver but in intestine. The upregulation of Abcg5/g8 by fish oil is caused by an increase in cellular 27-HOC through Cyp27a1 induction. The hepatic induction of bile acid synthesis through Cyp27a1 may upregulate expression of bile acid transporters in both organs.
Bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAAT) conjugates bile salts to glycine or taurine, which is the final step in bile salt biosynthesis. In addition, BAAT is required for reconjugation of bile salts in the enterohepatic circulation. Recently, we showed that BAAT is a peroxisomal protein, implying shuttling of bile salts through peroxisomes for reconjugation. However, the subcellular location of BAAT remains a topic of debate. The aim of this study was to obtain direct proof for reconjugation of bile salts in peroxisomes. Primary rat hepatocytes were incubated with deuterium-labeled cholic acid (D(4)CA). Over time, media and cells were collected and the levels of D(4)CA, D(4)-tauro-CA (D(4)TCA), and D(4)-glyco-CA (D(4)GCA) were quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Subcellular accumulation of D(4)-labeled bile salts was analyzed by digitonin permeabilization assays and subcellular fractionation experiments. Within 24 hours, cultured rat hepatocytes efficiently (&gt;90%) converted and secreted 100 μM D(4)CA to D(4)TCA and D(4)GCA. The relative amounts of D(4)TCA and D(4)GCA produced were dependent on the presence of glycine or taurine in the medium. Treatment of D(4)CA-exposed hepatocytes with 30-150 μg/mL digitonin led to the complete release of D(4)CA, D(4)GCA, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (cytosolic marker). Full release of D(4)TCA, catalase, and BAAT was only observed at 500 μg/mL digitonin, indicating the presence of D(4)TCA in membrane-enclosed organelles. D(4)TCA was detected in fractions of purified peroxisomes, which did not contain D(4)CA and D(4)GCA.
We established a novel assay to study conjugation and intra- and transcellular transport of bile salts. Using this assay, we show that cholic acid shuttles through peroxisomes for taurine-conjugation.
Caveolae are a subtype of cholesterol-enriched lipid microdomains/rafts that are routinely detected as vesicles pinching off from the plasma membrane. Caveolin-1 is an essential component of caveolae. Hepatic caveolin-1 plays an important role in liver regeneration and lipid metabolism. Expression of caveolin-1 in hepatocytes is relatively low, and it has been suggested to also reside at other subcellular locations than the plasma membrane. Recently, we found that the peroxisomal membrane contains lipid microdomains. Like caveolin-1, hepatic peroxisomes are involved in lipid metabolism. Here, we analyzed the subcellular location of caveolin-1 in rat hepatocytes. The subcellular location of rat hepatocyte caveolin-1 was analyzed by cell fractionation procedures, immunofluorescence, and immuno-electron microscopy. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged caveolin-1 was expressed in rat hepatocytes. Lipid rafts were characterized after Triton X-100 or Lubrol WX extraction of purified peroxisomes. Fenofibric acid-dependent regulation of caveolin-1 was analyzed. Peroxisome biogenesis was studied in rat hepatocytes after RNA interference-mediated silencing of caveolin-1 and caveolin-1 knockout mice. Cell fractionation and microscopic analyses reveal that caveolin-1 colocalizes with peroxisomal marker proteins (catalase, the 70 kDa peroxisomal membrane protein PMP70, the adrenoleukodystrophy protein ALDP, Pex14p, and the bile acid-coenzyme A:amino acid N-acyltransferase BAAT) in rat hepatocytes. Artificially expressed GFP-caveolin-1 accumulated in catalase-positive organelles. Peroxisomal caveolin-1 is associated with detergent-resistant microdomains. Caveolin-1 expression is strongly repressed by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha agonist fenofibric acid. Targeting of peroxisomal matrix proteins and peroxisome number and shape were not altered in rat hepatocytes with 70%-80% reduced caveolin-1 levels and in livers of caveolin-1 knockout mice.
Caveolin-1 is enriched in peroxisomes of hepatocytes. Caveolin-1 is not required for peroxisome biogenesis, but this unique subcellular location may determine its important role in hepatocyte proliferation and lipid metabolism.
The distribution of some enzymes between peroxisomes and cytosol, or a dual localization in both these compartments, can be difficult to reconcile. We have used photobleaching in live cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fusion proteins to show that imported bona fide peroxisomal matrix proteins are retained in the peroxisome. The high mobility of the GFP-fusion proteins in the cytosol and absence of peroxisomal escape makes it possible to eliminate the cytosolic fluorescence by photobleaching, to distinguish between exclusively cytosolic proteins and proteins that are also present at low levels in peroxisomes. Using this technique we found that GFP tagged bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAAT) was exclusively localized in the cytosol in HeLa cells. We conclude that the cytosolic localization was due to its carboxyterminal non-consensus peroxisomal targeting signal (-SQL) since mutation of the -SQL to -SKL resulted in BAAT being efficiently imported into peroxisomes.
To test the hypothesis that dexamethasone (Dex) treatment would restore rat hepatic bile acid coenzyme A-amino acid N-acyltransferase (rBAT) expression in septic rats after cecal ligation and puncture by increasing expression of retinoic acid X receptor alpha (RXRalpha), we assessed survival rate and bile and bile salt concentration in the Dex-treated septic group and compared these results with those for a nontreated septic group, a Dex-treated nonseptic group, and a sham group. Dexamethasone treatment (0.01 mg/kg) significantly improved the survival rate and increased the bile and bile salt concentration in the bile ducts of septic rats (P = &lt;0.05). In our assessment of bile salt-related genes, during sepsis, there were decreases in protein and mRNA expression of rBAT and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). Treatment with Dex restored expression of rBAT and RXR[alpha] but not CYP7A1, bile salt export pump, or multidrug resistance associated protein 2 (MRP2). Na+-taurocholate cotransport protein and organic anion transporting polypeptide 1 were unchanged. In addition, treatment with Dex also restored the DNA-binding activity of RXR/farnesoid-X receptor to rBAT promoter containing inverted repeat 1 sequence. In an experiment to confirm our findings, RXR[alpha] siRNA was found to significantly block Dex-induced increases in expression of rBAT in hepatocytes taken from septic rats (P &lt; 0.01).
Dex restored the expression of rBAT in septic rats by enhancing RXR[alpha], a process that might explain the mechanism underlying Dex's anticholestatic effect.
MS, with or without pre-analysis peptide fractionation, can be used to decipher the residues on proteins where oxidative modifications caused by peroxynitrite, singlet oxygen or electrophilic lipids have occurred. Peroxynitrite nitrates tyrosine and tryptophan residues on the surface of actin. Singlet oxygen, formed by the interaction of UVA light with tryptophan, can oxidize neighbouring cysteine, histidine, methionine, tyrosine and tryptophan residues. Dose-response inactivation by 4HNE (4-hydroxynonenal) of hBAT (human bile acid CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase) and CKBB (cytosolic brain isoform of creatine kinase) is associated with site-specific modifications. FT-ICR (Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance)-MS using nanoLC (nano-liquid chromatography)-ESI (electrospray ionization)-MS or direct-infusion ESI-MS with gas-phase fractionation identified 14 4HNE adducts on hBAT and 17 on CKBB respectively. At 4HNE concentrations in the physiological range, one member of the catalytic triad of hBAT (His362) was modified; for CKBB, although all four residues in the active site that were modifiable by 4HNE were ultimately modified, only one, Cys283, occurred at physiological concentrations of 4HNE. These results suggest that future in vivo studies should carefully assess the critical sites that are modified rather than using antibodies that do not distinguish between different modified sites.
The hepatic enzyme bile acid CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAT) catalyzes the formation of amino acid-conjugated bile acids. In the present study, protein carbonylation of BAT, consistent with modification by reactive oxygen species and their products, was increased in hepatic homogenates of apolipoprotein E knock-out mice. 4-Hydroxynonenal (4HNE), an electrophilic lipid generated by oxidation of polyunsaturated long-chain fatty acids, typically reacts with the amino acids Cys, His, Lys, and Arg to form adducts, some of which (Michael adducts) preserve the aldehyde (i.e., carbonyl) moiety. Because two of these amino acids (Cys and His) are members of the catalytic triad of human BAT, it was proposed that 4HNE would cause inactivation of this enzyme. As expected, human BAT (1.6 microM) was inactivated by 4HNE in a dose-dependent manner. To establish the sites of 4HNE's reaction with BAT, peptides from proteolysis of 4HNE-treated, recombinant human BAT were analyzed by peptide mass fingerprinting and by electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry using a hybrid linear ion trap Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer. The data revealed that the active-site His (His362) dose-dependently formed a 4HNE adduct, contributing to loss of activity, although 4HNE adducts on other residues may also contribute.
In the present study, we identified three novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 147C&gt;T in exon 2 (silent), 602G&gt;C in exon 3 (Arg201Pro), and 1134C&gt;T in exon 4 (silent), in the gene of bile acid CoA: amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAAT) by resequencing the entire coding region and the exon-intron junctions of 100 Japanese individuals. The allelic frequencies were 0.005 for 147C&gt;T, 0.095 for 602G&gt;C, and 0.015 for 1134C&gt;T. The two known SNPs, 59G&gt;A (Arg20Gln, rs1572983) and UTR1513G&gt;A (rs2229594), were detected at a frequency of 0.500 and 0.425, respectively. In the haplotype analysis for the 59G&gt;A and 602G&gt;C polymorphisms, the allelic frequency of 59G-602G, 59G-602C, 59A-602G and 59A-602C was 0.405, 0.095, 0.500 and 0.000, respectively. On the other hand, the allelic frequency of the nonsynonymous SNP 602G&gt;C was 0.194 in a Caucasian population.
Sepsis causes intrahepatic cholestasis and leads to hepatic failure. However, the pathophysiology of hepatic events is unclear. Expression of rat hepatic bile acid coenzyme A-amino acid N-acyltransferase (rBAT), a major enzyme for the conjugation of bile acids, is significantly decreased during sepsis. rBAT transcriptional regulation is mainly by a heterodimer of farnesoid-X receptor (FXR) and retinoid-X receptor-alpha (RXR-alpha) via the inverted repeat 1 sequence. During sepsis, nuclear receptors and translocation of RXR-alpha from cytosol to nucleus decrease. The purpose of this study was to further clarify the mechanisms of RXR-alpha-mediated rBAT regulation during polymicrobial sepsis and with dexamethasone treatment. Polymicrobial sepsis was induced in rats by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Liver tissues obtained 3, 6, 9, and 18 h after CLP were studied, and hepatocytes were isolated from rats with sepsis. Post-CLP decreases were observed in mRNA levels of rBAT (6 h), protein levels of rBAT (6 h), RXR-alpha (6 h), and FXR (9 h). DNA binding activity of FXR/RXR significantly decreased at 6 h after CLP. Dexamethasone reversed sepsis-inhibited RXR-alpha expression and the binding activity of FXR/RXR to rBAT DNA as well as rBAT protein expression. The results suggest that suppression of rBAT occurs at the transcriptional level, and the decrease in RXR-alpha by septic insult may play a critical role in rBAT suppression at the early stage of polymicrobial sepsis.
Bile acid coenzyme A:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAT) is responsible for the amidation of bile acids with the amino acids glycine and taurine. To quantify total BAT activity in liver subcellular organelles, livers from young adult male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were fractionated into multiple subcellular compartments. In male and female rats, 65-75% of total liver BAT activity was found in the cytosol, 15-17% was found in the peroxisomes, and 5-10% was found in the heavy mitochondrial fraction. After clofibrate treatment, male rats displayed an increase in peroxisomal BAT specific activity and a decrease in cytosolic BAT specific activity, whereas females showed an opposite response. However, there was no overall change in BAT specific activity in whole liver homogenate. Treatment with rosiglitazone or cholestyramine had no effect on BAT activity in any subcellular compartment. These experiments indicate that the majority of BAT activity in the rat liver resides in the cytosol. Approximately 15% of BAT activity is present in the peroxisomal matrix. These data support the novel finding that clofibrate treatment does not directly regulate BAT activity but does alter the subcellular localization of BAT.
Bile acid-coenzyme A:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAAT) is the sole enzyme responsible for conjugation of primary and secondary bile acids to taurine and glycine. Previous studies indicate a peroxisomal location of BAAT in peroxisomes with variable amounts up to 95% detected in cytosolic fractions. The absence or presence of a cytosolic pool of BAAT has important implications for the intracellular transport of unconjugated/deconjugated bile salts. We used immunofluorescence microscopy and digitonin permeabilization assays to determine the subcellular location of endogenous BAAT in primary human and rat hepatocytes. In addition, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged rat Baat (rBaat) and human BAAT (hBAAT) were transiently expressed in primary rat hepatocytes and human fibroblasts. Catalase and recombinant GFP-SKL and DsRed-SKL were used as peroxisomal markers. Endogenous hBAAT and rBaat were found to specifically localize to peroxisomes in human and rat hepatocytes, respectively. No significant cytosolic fraction was detected for either protein. GFP-tagged hBAAT and rBaat were efficiently sorted to peroxisomes of primary rat hepatocytes. Significant amounts of GFP-tagged hBAAT or rBaat were detected in the cytosol only when coexpressed with DsRed-SKL, suggesting that hBAAT/rBaat and DsRed-SKL compete for the same peroxisomal import machinery. When expressed in fibroblasts, GFP-tagged hBAAT localized to the cytosol, confirming earlier observations.
hBAAT and rBaat are peroxisomal enzymes present in undetectable amounts in the cytosol. Unconjugated or deconjugated bile salts returning to the liver need to shuttle through the peroxisome before reentering the enterohepatic circulation.
Bile acids are converted to their glycine and taurine N-acyl amidates by enzymes in the liver in a two-step process. This increases their aqueous solubility, particularly in the acidic environment of the upper part of the small intestine. Bile acid coenzyme A (CoA) thioesters synthesized by bile acid CoA ligase (see Shonsey et al., 2005) are substrates of bile acid CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferases (BAT) in the formation of bile acid N-acyl amidates. This chapter describes the methods used to purify BAT from human liver, to isolate and clone cDNAs encoding BAT from human, mouse, and rat liver cDNA libraries, the expression of BAT, the assays used to measure BAT activity, and the chemical syntheses of bile acid N-acylamidates. In addition, an enzyme that catalyzes further metabolism of glycine-conjugated bile acids is described.
Intrahepatic cholestasis, or impairment of bile flow, is an important manifestation of inherited and acquired liver disease. In recent years, human genetic and molecular studies have identified several genes, the disruption of which results in cholestasis. ATP8B1 (FIC1), ABCB11 (BSEP), and ABCB4 (MDR3) are disrupted in forms of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) and related disorders. Mutations in BAAT, TJP2 (ZO-2), and EPHX1 have been identified in patients with hypercholanemia. A CLDN1 mutation was recently reported in patients with ichthyosis, leukocyte vacuoles, alopecia and sclerosing cholangitis (ILVASC), and North American Indian childhood cirrhosis (NAIC) is associated with a missense mutation in CIRH1A. Alagille syndrome patients carry mutations in JAG1, and mutations in VPS33B have been identified in patients with arthrogryposis, renal dysfunction and cholestasis syndrome (ARC). Identification of these genes, and characterization of the proteins they encode, is enhancing our understanding of the biology of the enterohepatic circulation in health and disease.
In late sepsis, it has been established that the liver plays a major role in the initiation of multiorgan failure, which is the most lethal complication in hospitals. The molecular mechanism underlying liver failure that results from sepsis remains elusive. This study was undertaken to identify the bona fide differentially expressed genes in the 18-h septic liver by suppression subtractive hybridization, and the data were corroborated by Northern blot analysis. The differential gene expression profile renders a clue as to the genes involved in septic liver failure. The cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model of a polymicrobial septic rat was used, with the late sepsis referring to animals sacrificed at 18 h after CLP. We have identified three upregulated genes (TII-kininogen, serine protease inhibitor 2.2 [Spi2.2], and alpha 2 macroglobulin [alpha M]) and six down-regulated genes (hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase [3 alpha HSD], EST189895/mouse RNase4, bile acid-CoA-amino acid N-acyltransferase [kan-1/rBAT], IF1, albumin, and alpha 2u-globulins [alpha 2u-G PGCL1]). Among these genes, the 3 alpha HSD and kan-1/rBAT are involved in bile acid metabolism. The IF1 plays a crucial role in any disease that involves ATP hydrolysis by F1F0-ATPase. The alpha 2M, TII-kininogen, and Spi2.2 are protease inhibitors. The functions of the alpha 2u-G PGCL1 and EST189895/mouse RNase4 genes are unknown. The present results suggest that the roles of disturbance of bile acid metabolism/synthesis and the abolishment of ATP production may contribute to liver failure during late sepsis.
The skin secretions of many frogs have genetically-encoded, endogenous antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Other species, especially aposematic poison frogs, secrete exogenously derived alkaloids that serve as potent defense molecules. The origins of these defense systems are not clear, but a novel bile-acid derived metabolite, tauromantellic acid, was recently discovered and shown to be endogenous in poison frogs (Mantella, Dendrobates, and Epipedobates). These observations raise questions about the evolutionary history of AMP genetic elements, the mechanism and function of tauromatellic acid production, and links between these systems. To understand the diversity and expression of AMPs among frogs, we assembled skin transcriptomes of 13 species across the anuran phylogeny. Our analyses revealed a diversity of AMPs and AMP expression levels across the phylogenetic history of frogs, but no observations of AMPs in Mantella We examined genes expressed in the bile-acid metabolic pathway and found that CYP7A1 (Cytochrome P450), BAAT (bile acid-CoA: amino acid N-acyltransferase), and AMACR (alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase) were highly expressed in the skin of M. betsileo and either lowly expressed or absent in other frog species. In particular, CYP7A1 catalyzes the first reaction in the cholesterol catabolic pathway and is the rate-limiting step in regulation of bile acid synthesis, suggesting unique activation of the bile acid pathway in Mantella skin. The activation of the bile acid pathway in the skin of Mantella and the lack of observed AMPs fuel new questions about the evolution of defense compounds and the ectopic expression of the bile-acid pathway.
Pectin has been known to lower circulating cholesterol by interacting with bile acid (BA) metabolism. The current study was aimed to investigate intestinal BA transport at the molecular level in a pig model. Twelve young pigs (11.05 ± 0.11 kg) were randomly divided into 2 groups and fed corn-soybean meal diets with either 5% pectin or cornstarch for 72 d. In pigs fed with pectin, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were lowered but high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) was increased (P &lt; 0.05). Serum triglycerides tended to be lower in the pectin-fed animals (P = 0.093), whereas no change was noted in serum total bile acid. Along the length of the intestine, the size and composition of BA pools vary. The ratio of primary, secondary, taurine-conjugated, and glycine-conjugated BAs in the ileal pool was about 46:15:9:30, whereas it was 28:61:1:11 in the cecum and 22:65:3:9 in the colon (P &lt; 0.05). In the feces, lithocholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) made up of over 97% of the total BA pool. Overall, the ileum had the greatest expression of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and apical sodium-coupled bile acid transporter (ASBT) than the duodenum, jejunum, cecum, and colon (P &lt; 0.05), whereas organic solute transporters α/β (OSTα/β) gene expression was peaked in the ileum and jejunum (P &lt; 0.05). Expression multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) gradually decreased towards the end of the intestine (P &lt; 0.05). Greater expression of G protein-coupled bile acid receptor and multidrug resistance protein 3 (MRP3) was found in the cecum and colon (P &lt; 0.05). In pigs fed with 5% pectin, only cecal UDCA (P = 0.097) and hyocholic acid (P = 0.088) showed a decreasing tendency. But FXR, ASBT, and MRP2 were upregulated in the ileum and FXR, OSTα/β, MRP2, and MRP3 in the cecum of PEC-fed pigs (P &lt; 0.05). Liver enzymes involved in BA biosynthesis (CYP7A1, CYP27A1, bile acid-CoA synthase, and bile acid-CoA:amino acid N acyltransferase) were not affected by pectin consumption. In conclusion, the abundant distribution of BA transporters and the greater BA pool size suggests the ileum as the major site for intestinal BA reabsorption in pigs. In the ileum, pectin increased in-and-out BA transport on the apical membrane by increasing ASBT and MRP2, but it increased the overall BA transport in the cecum by increasing OSTα/β and MRP3.
Tsumura-Suzuki obese diabetic (TSOD) is a good model of metabolic syndrome showing typical lesions found in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and develops spontaneous hepatic tumors with a high frequency. Majority of the developing tumors overexpress glutamine synthetase (GS), which is used as a marker of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study is to assess the status of expression of metabolism-related genes and the level of bile acids in the TSOD mice-derived tumors and to determine the association with metabolic dysregulation between human HCC and TSOD mice-derived tumors.
GS-positive hepatic tumors or adjacent normal tissues from 71-week-old male TSOD mice were subjected to immunohistochemical staining, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), quantitation of cholic acid and taurocholic acid.
We found that downregulation of the rate-limiting enzyme for betaine synthesis (BADH), at both mRNA and protein levels in GS-positive TSOD mice-derived tumors. Furthermore, the bile acid receptor FXR and the bile acid excretion pump BSEP (Abcb11) were found to be downregulated, whereas BAAT and Akr1c14, involved in primary bile acid synthesis and bile acid conjugation, were found to be upregulated at mRNA level in GS-positive TSOD mice-derived tumors. BAAT and Akr1c14 were also overexpressed at protein levels. Total cholic acid was found to be increased in GS-positive TSOD mice-derived tumors.
Our results strongly support the significance of TSOD mice as a model of spontaneously developing HCC.
Activin A, a multifunctional cytokine, plays an important role in hepatocyte growth suppression and is involved in liver size control. The present study was aimed to determine the cell location of activin A in the normal rat liver microenvironment and the contribution of activin A signaling to the hepatocyte phenotype to obtain insight into molecular mechanisms. Immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization analyses identified hepatocytes as the major activin A-positive cell population in normal liver and identified mast cells as an additional activin A source. To investigate paracrine and autocrine activin A-stimulated effects, hepatocytes were cocultured with engineered activin A-secreting cell lines (RF1, TL8) or transduced with an adeno-associated virus vector encoding activin βA, which led to strikingly altered expression of cell cycle-related genes (Ki-67, E2F transcription factor 1 [E2F1], minichromosome maintenance complex component 2 [Mcm2], forkhead box M1 [FoxM1]) and senescence-related genes (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B [p15INK4b/CDKN2B], differentiated embryo-chondrocyte expressed gene 1 [DEC1]) and reduced proliferation and induction of senescence. Microarray analyses identified 453 differentially expressed genes, many of which were not yet recognized as activin A downstream targets (e.g., ADAM metallopeptidase domain 12 [Adam12], semaphorin 7A [Sema7a], LIM and cysteine-rich domains-1 [Lmcd1], DAB2, clathrin adaptor protein [Dab2]). Among the main activin A-mediated molecular/cellular functions are cellular growth/proliferation and movement, molecular transport, and metabolic processes containing highly down-regulated genes, such as cytochrome P450, subfamily 2, polypeptide 11 (Cyp2C11), sulfotransferase family 1A, member 1 (Sult1a1), glycine-N-acyltransferase (Glyat), and bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (Baat). Moreover, Ingenuity Pathway Analyses identified particular gene networks regulated by hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4α and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) as key targets of activin A signaling. Conclusion: Our in vitro models demonstrated that activin A-stimulated growth inhibition and cellular senescence is mediated through p15INK4b/CDKN2B and is associated with up- and down-regulation of numerous target genes involved in multiple biological processes performed by hepatocytes, suggesting that activin A fulfills a critical role in normal liver function.

The nuclear hormone receptor, Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) regulates the transcription of genes associated with bile acid metabolism and disposition.
This study investigates possible changes in the expression of target genes responsible for amino acid conjugation, i.e., Bile Acid-CoA Synthetase (BACS) and bile acid-CoA: amino acid Nacetyltransferase (BAT). These genes have been shown to be inducible by FXR agonists in rat models, however, to date no studies have been conducted in a human hepatocyte model.
In human hepatocytes, treatment with the FXR agonists GW4064 (1.0 µM) and WAY362450 (0.1 µM) did not significantly induce the mRNA expression of BACS and BAT genes. However, other target genes associated with FXR activation, such as Bile Salt Export Pump (BSEP), Short Heterodimer Partner (SHP), Multidrug Resistance-associated Protein 2 (MRP2) and Multidrug Resistance Protein 3 (MDR3), were upregulated. Interestingly, a follow up study conducted in rat hepatocytes indicated that GW4064 induced the BACS gene while WAY362450 induced the BAT gene, confirming literature results that these genes can be induced in rat.
In conclusion, there appears to be some species differences in the activation of FXR target genes.
Certain modified diets containing saturated fatty acids, cholesterol or fructose lead to the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-related fibrosis in rodents; however, progression to cirrhosis is rare. Experimental liver cirrhosis models have relied on genetic manipulation or administration of hepatotoxins. This study aimed to establish a reliable dietary model of NASH-related cirrhosis in a relatively short period. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (9 weeks of age) were randomly assigned to normal, high-fat (HF), or two types (1.25% or 2.5% cholesterol) of high-fat and high-cholesterol (HFC) diets for 18 weeks. All HFC diets contained 2% cholic acid by weight. Histopathological analysis revealed that the HFC diets induced obvious hepatic steatosis, inflammation with hepatocyte ballooning and advanced fibrosis (stage 3-4) in all 12 rats at 27 weeks of age. In contrast, all five rats given the HF diet developed mild steatosis and inflammation without fibrosis. The amount of cholesterol in the liver and hepatocellular mitochondrial and microsomal fractions was significantly higher in rats fed the HFC diets than the normal or HF diets. The HFC diets significantly suppressed mRNA levels of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, adenosine triphosphate binding cassette transporter G5, bile acid CoA: amino acid N-acyltransferase and bile salt export pump, as well as the enzymatic activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase in the liver. In conclusion, the HFC diets induced liver cirrhosis in conjunction with hepatic features of NASH in Sprague-Dawley rats within 18 weeks, and altered gene expression and enzyme activity to accumulate lipid and bile acid in the liver.
Bile acid CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAAT) is the terminal enzyme in the synthesis of bile salts from cholesterol and catalyzes the conjugation of taurine or glycine to bile acid CoA thioesters to form bile acid N-acylamidates. BAAT has a dual localization to the cytosol and peroxisomes, possibly due to an inefficient carboxy-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS), -serine-glutamine-leucine (-SQL). Mutational analysis was used to define the role of the carboxy terminus in peroxisomal localization and kinetic activity. Amidation activity of BAAT and BAAT lacking the final two amino acids (AAs) (BAAT-S) were similar, whereas the activity of BAAT with a canonical PTS sequence (BAAT-SKL) was increased &gt;2.5-fold. Kinetic analysis of BAAT and BAAT-SKL showed that BAAT-SKL had a lower Km for taurine and glycine as well as a greater Vmax There was no difference in the affinity for cholyl-CoA. In contrast to BAAT, BAAT-SKL forms bile acid N-acylamidates with β-alanine. BAAT-S immunoprecipitated when incubated with peroxisomal biogenesis factor 5 (Pex5) and rabbit anti-Pex5 antibodies; however, deleting the final 12 AAs prevented coimmunoprecipitation with Pex5, indicating the Pex5 interaction involves more than the -SQL sequence. These results indicate that even small changes in the carboxy terminus of BAAT can have significant effects on activity and substrate specificity.
Evidence indicates that the polymorphisms in genes involved in bile acid metabolism may play an important role in the development of anti-tuberculosis drug-induced hepatotoxicity (ATDH) in tuberculosis (TB) patients treated with anti-tuberculosis drugs.
To investigate the association between genetic variants of CYP7A1, BAAT and UGT1A1 and the risk of ATDH in a Chinese cohort.
In this nested case-control study, 89 TB patients with ATDH and 356 matched ATDH-free TB patients constituted cases and controls, respectively. Genetic polymorphisms of CYP7A1, BAAT and UGT1A1 were determined using the TaqMan single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping assay. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using a conditional logistic regression model.
Significant differences were found in genotype distributions of rs1457043 in CYP7A1 between patients with and those without ATDH (P = 0.014). Genotype and haplotype analysis showed that patients carrying an AG genotype of rs1457043 and G-C or G-A haplotypes of rs1457043-rs8192870 in CYP7A1 were at a higher risk of ATDH than those with GG genotype and A-C haplotype, with ORs of respectively 2.05 (95%CI 1.18-3.15) and 2.40 (95%CI 1.62-3.57).
Genetic polymorphisms of CYP7A1 may be associated with susceptibility to ATDH in the Chinese population.
Serum bile acids (BAs) are elevated following bariatric surgery and have emerged as a potential glucose-lowering beneficial factor. The change of BA components and its underlying mechanisms may be of great significance during bariatric surgery. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of different bariatric procedures on serum BA composition and explore the potential mechanisms using a diabetic rat model.
Duodenal-jejunal bypass (DJB), sleeve gastrectomy (SG), and sham operation were performed in diabetic rats induced by high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ). Body weight, food intake, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and insulin tolerance test (ITT) were measured at indicated time points. Serum BAs composition and the expression of cholesterol 7α hydroxylase (CYP7A1), bile acid: CoA synthase (BACS) and bile acid-CoA: amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAAT) at both transcriptional and protein levels in the liver were evaluated at 12 weeks postoperatively.
Compared with sham group, DJB and SG both achieved rapid and sustained improvements in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. They also resulted in increased serum BAs, especially the taurine-conjugated BAs by elevated conjugation. No obvious difference was detected between DJB and SG except that SG achieved decreased weight gain and food intake.
The preferentially elevated serum taurine-conjugated BAs were similar after different bariatric surgeries, and the enhanced conjugation of BAs in the liver might account for the changed serum BAs profiles.
Bile acid amidation defects were predicted to present with fat/fat soluble vitamin malabsorption with minimal cholestasis. We identified and treated five patients (one male, four females) from four families with defective bile acid amidation due to a genetically confirmed deficiency in bile acid CoA:amino acid N-acyl transferase (BAAT) with the conjugated bile acid, glycocholic acid (GCA). Fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry analysis of urine and bile at baseline revealed predominantly unconjugated cholic acid and absence of the usual glycine and taurine conjugated primary bile acids. Treatment with 15 mg/kg GCA resulted in total duodenal bile acid concentrations of 23.3 ± 19.1 mmol/L (mean ± SD) and 63.5 ± 4.0% of the bile acids were secreted in bile in the conjugated form, of which GCA represented 59.6 ± 9.3% of the total biliary bile acids. Unconjugated cholic acid continued to be present in high concentrations in bile because of partial intestinal deconjugation of orally administered GCA. Serum total bile acid concentrations did not significantly differ between pretreatment and posttreatment samples and serum contained predominantly unconjugated cholic acid. These findings confirmed efficient intestinal absorption, hepatic extraction, and biliary secretion of the administered GCA. Oral tolerance tests for vitamin D2 (1,000 IU vitamin D2/kg) and tocopherol (100 IU/kg tocopherol acetate) demonstrated improvement in fat-soluble vitamin absorption after GCA treatment. Growth improved in 3/3 growth-delayed prepubertal patients.
Oral glycocholic acid therapy is safe and effective in improving growth and fat-soluble vitamin absorption in children and adolescents with inborn errors of bile acid metabolism due to amidation defects.
Excessive intrahepatic accumulation of bile acids (BAs) is a key mechanism underlying cholestasis. The aim of this study was to quantitatively explore the relationship between cytotoxicity of BAs and their intracellular accumulation in sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes (SCRH). Following exposure of SCRH (on day-1 after seeding) to various BAs for 24h, glycine-conjugated BAs were most potent in exerting toxicity. Moreover, unconjugated BAs showed significantly higher toxicity in day-1 compared to day-3 SCRH. When day-1/-3 SCRH were exposed (0.5-4h) to 5-100μM (C)DCA, intracellular levels of unconjugated (C)DCA were similar, while intracellular levels of glycine conjugates were up to 4-fold lower in day-3 compared to day-1 SCRH. Sinusoidal efflux was by far the predominant efflux pathway of conjugated BAs both in day-1 and day-3 SCRH, while canalicular BA efflux showed substantial interbatch variability. After 4h exposure to (C)DCA, intracellular glycine conjugate levels were at least 10-fold higher than taurine conjugate levels. Taken together, reduced BA conjugate formation in day-3 SCRH results in lower intracellular glycine conjugate concentrations, explaining decreased toxicity of (C)DCA in day-3 versus day-1 SCRH. Our data provide for the first time a direct link between BA toxicity and glycine conjugate exposure in SCRH.
Previous studies showed glucose and insulin signaling can regulate bile acid (BA) metabolism during fasting or feeding. However, limited knowledge is available on the effect of calorie restriction (CR), a well-known anti-aging intervention, on BA homeostasis. To address this, the present study utilized a "dose-response" model of CR, where male C57BL/6 mice were fed 0, 15, 30, or 40% CR diets for one month, followed by BA profiling in various compartments of the enterohepatic circulation by UPLC-MS/MS technique. This study showed that 40% CR increased the BA pool size (162%) as well as total BAs in serum, gallbladder, and small intestinal contents. In addition, CR "dose-dependently" increased the concentrations of tauro-cholic acid (TCA) and many secondary BAs (produced by intestinal bacteria) in serum, such as tauro-deoxycholic acid (TDCA), DCA, lithocholic acid, ω-muricholic acid (ωMCA), and hyodeoxycholic acid. Notably, 40% CR increased TDCA by over 1000% (serum, liver, and gallbladder). Interestingly, 40% CR increased the proportion of 12α-hydroxylated BAs (CA and DCA), which correlated with improved glucose tolerance and lipid parameters. The CR-induced increase in BAs correlated with increased expression of BA-synthetic (Cyp7a1) and conjugating enzymes (BAL), and the ileal BA-binding protein (Ibabp). These results suggest that CR increases BAs in male mice possibly through orchestrated increases in BA synthesis and conjugation in liver as well as intracellular transport in ileum. 
The final step in bile acid synthesis involves conjugation with glycine and taurine, which promotes a high intraluminal micellar concentration to facilitate lipid absorption. We investigated the clinical, biochemical, molecular, and morphologic features of a genetic defect in bile acid conjugation in 10 pediatric patients with fat-soluble vitamin deficiency, some with growth failure or transient neonatal cholestatic hepatitis.
We identified the genetic defect that causes this disorder using mass spectrometry analysis of urine, bile, and serum samples and sequence analysis of the genes encoding bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAAT) and bile acid-CoA ligase (SLC27A5).
Levels of urinary bile acids were increased (432 ± 248 μmol/L) and predominantly excreted in unconjugated forms (79.4% ± 3.9%) and as sulfates and glucuronides. Glycine or taurine conjugates were absent in the urine, bile, and serum. Unconjugated bile acids accounted for 95.7% ± 5.8% of the bile acids in duodenal bile, with cholic acid accounting for 82.4% ± 5.5% of the total. Duodenal bile acid concentrations were 12.1 ± 5.9 mmol/L, which is too low for efficient lipid absorption. The biochemical profile was consistent with defective bile acid amidation. Molecular analysis of BAAT confirmed 4 different homozygous mutations in 8 patients tested.
Based on a study of 10 pediatric patients, genetic defects that disrupt bile acid amidation cause fat-soluble vitamin deficiency and growth failure, indicating the importance of bile acid conjugation in lipid absorption. Some patients developed liver disease with features of a cholangiopathy. These findings indicate that patients with idiopathic neonatal cholestasis or later onset of unexplained fat-soluble vitamin deficiency should be screened for defects in bile acid conjugation.
Cholate-CoA ligase (CCL) and bile acid-CoA: amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAAT) sequentially mediate bile-acid amidation. Defects can cause intrahepatic cholestasis. Distinction has required gene sequencing. We assessed potential clinical utility of immunostaining of liver for CCL and BAAT. Using commercially available antibodies against BAAT and CCL, we immunostained liver from an infant with jaundice, deficiency of amidated bile acids, and transcription-terminating mutation in BAAT. CCL was normally expressed. BAAT expression was not detected. Immunostaining may facilitate diagnosis in bile-acid amidation defects.
Keratinocyte (KC) gene expression is regulated by members of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily including retinoic acid receptors, retinoid X receptors (RAR and RXR, respectively), and peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPAR). In addition to ligand, NR transcriptional activity is controlled by interaction with proteins, collectively known as coregulators, which function as corepressors or coactivators. To improve our understanding of coregulators expressed in epidermis, we screened a KC cDNA library for PPARalpha-interacting proteins. The screen yielded previously unknown proteins including one we named COPR1, for comodulator of PPAR and RXR. COPR1 and its longer variant COPR2 target the AF-2 domains of NR but exhibit quantitative differences in their functional interactions with RAR, RXRalpha and PPAR. They decrease but do not completely repress the activity of RXRalpha and PPARalpha because of a proline-acid-rich autonomous activation domain. An NR box motif contributes to but is not solely responsible for functional and physical association with RXRalpha. The activation domain, their relatively small size (COPR1, 26.9 kDa; COPR2, 32.4 kDa), and strict dependence on AF-2 for interaction distinguish COPR1 and COPR2 from the SMRT/NCoR type of corepressor and may represent a means of control that dampens rather than completely represses NR-mediated gene expression.
High altitude environments are of particular interest in the studies of local adaptation as well as their implications in physiology and clinical medicine in human. Some Chinese pig breeds, such as Tibetan pig (TBP) that is well adapted to the high altitude and Dahe pig (DHP) that dwells at the moderate altitude, provide ideal materials to study local adaptation to altitudes. Yet, it is still short of in-depth analysis and understanding of the genetic adaptation to high altitude in the two pig populations. In this study we conducted a genomic scan for selective sweeps using FST to identify genes showing evidence of local adaptations in TBP and DHP, with Wuzhishan pig (WZSP) as the low-altitude reference. Totally, we identified 12 specific selective genes (CCBE1, F2RL1, AGGF1, ZFPM2, IL2, FGF5, PLA2G4A, ADAMTS9, NRBF2, JMJD1C, VEGFC and ADAM19) for TBP and six (OGG1, FOXM, FLT3, RTEL1, CRELD1 and RHOG) for DHP. In addition, six selective genes (VPS13A, GNA14, GDAP1, PARP8, FGF10 and ADAMTS16) were shared by the two pig breeds. Among these selective genes, three (VEGFC, FGF10 and ADAMTS9) were previously reported to be linked to the local adaptation to high altitudes in pigs, while many others were newly identified by this study. Further bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that majority of these selective signatures have some biological functions relevant to the altitude adaptation, for examples, response to hypoxia, development of blood vessels, DNA repair and several hematological involvements. These results suggest that the local adaptation to high altitude environments is sophisticated, involving numerous genes and multiple biological processes, and the shared selective signatures by the two pig breeds may provide an effective avenue to identify the common adaptive mechanisms to different altitudes. 
Autophagy is a tightly regulated lysosomal degradation pathway for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to stresses. Beclin 1 and its interacting proteins, including the class III phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase Vps34, play crucial roles in autophagy regulation in mammals. We identified nuclear receptor binding factor 2 (Nrbf2) as a Beclin 1-interacting protein from Becn1(-/-);Becn1-EGFP/+ mouse liver and brain. We also found that Nrbf2-Beclin 1 interaction required the N terminus of Nrbf2. We next used the human retinal pigment epithelial cell line RPE-1 as a model system and showed that transiently knocking down Nrbf2 by siRNA increased autophagic flux under both nutrient-rich and starvation conditions. To investigate the mechanism by which Nrbf2 regulates autophagy, we demonstrated that Nrbf2 interacted and colocalized with Atg14L, suggesting that Nrbf2 is a component of the Atg14L-containing Beclin 1-Vps34 complex. Moreover, ectopically expressed Nrbf2 formed cytosolic puncta that were positive for isolation membrane markers. These results suggest that Nrbf2 is involved in autophagosome biogenesis. Furthermore, we showed that Nrbf2 deficiency led to increased intracellular phosphatidylinositol-3 phosphate levels and diminished Atg14L-Vps34/Vps15 interactions, suggesting that Nrbf2-mediated Atg14L-Vps34/Vps15 interactions likely inhibit Vps34 activity. Therefore, we propose that Nrbf2 may interact with the Atg14L-containing Beclin 1-Vps34 protein complex to modulate protein-protein interactions within the complex, leading to suppression of Vps34 activity, autophagosome biogenesis, and autophagic flux. This work reveals a novel aspect of the intricate mechanism for the Beclin 1-Vps34 protein-protein interaction network to achieve precise control of autophagy. 
The Beclin 1-Vps34 complex, the core component of the class III phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K-III), binds Atg14L or UVRAG to control different steps of autophagy. However, the mechanism underlying the control of PI3K-III activity remains elusive. Here we report the identification of NRBF2 as a component in the specific PI3K-III complex and a modulator of PI3K-III activity. Through its microtubule interaction and trafficking (MIT) domain, NRBF2 binds Atg14L directly and enhances Atg14L-linked Vps34 kinase activity and autophagy induction. NRBF2-deficient cells exhibit enhanced vulnerability to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that is reversed by re-introducing exogenous NRBF2. NRBF2-deficient mice develop focal liver necrosis and ductular reaction, accompanied by impaired Atg14L-linked Vps34 activity and autophagy, although the mice show no increased mortality. Our data reveal a key role for NRBF2 in the assembly of the specific Atg14L-Beclin 1-Vps34-Vps15 complex for autophagy induction. Thus, NRBF2 modulates autophagy via regulation of PI3K-III and prevents ER stress-mediated cytotoxicity and liver injury. 
Omega6 (n6) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and their metabolites are involved in cell signaling, inflammation, clot formation, and other crucial biological processes. Genetic components, such as variants of fatty acid desaturase (FADS) genes, determine the composition of n6 PUFAs.
To elucidate undiscovered biological pathways that may influence n6 PUFA composition, we conducted genome-wide association studies and meta-analyses of associations of common genetic variants with 6 plasma n6 PUFAs in 8631 white adults (55% women) across 5 prospective studies. Plasma phospholipid or total plasma fatty acids were analyzed by similar gas chromatography techniques. The n6 fatty acids linoleic acid (LA), γ-linolenic acid (GLA), dihomo-GLA, arachidonic acid, and adrenic acid were expressed as percentage of total fatty acids. We performed linear regression with robust SEs to test for single-nucleotide polymorphism-fatty acid associations, with pooling using inverse-variance-weighted meta-analysis. Novel regions were identified on chromosome 10 associated with LA (rs10740118; P=8.1×10(-9); near NRBF2), on chromosome 16 with LA, GLA, dihomo-GLA, and arachidonic acid (rs16966952; P=1.2×10(-15), 5.0×10(-11), 7.6×10(-65), and 2.4×10(-10), respectively; NTAN1), and on chromosome 6 with adrenic acid after adjustment for arachidonic acid (rs3134950; P=2.1×10(-10); AGPAT1). We confirmed previous findings of the FADS cluster on chromosome 11 with LA and arachidonic acid, and further observed novel genome-wide significant association of this cluster with GLA, dihomo-GLA, and adrenic acid (P=2.3×10(-72), 2.6×10(-151), and 6.3×10(-140), respectively).
Our findings suggest that along with the FADS gene cluster, additional genes may influence n6 PUFA composition.
A protein named nuclear receptor binding factor-2 (NRBF-2) was identified by yeast two-hybrid screening, as an interaction partner of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha as well as several other nuclear receptors. NRBF-2 exhibited a gene activation function, when tethered to a heterologous DNA binding domain, in both mammalian cells and yeast.
Macroautophagy is a physiological cellular response to nutrient stress, which leads to the engulfment of cytosolic contents by a double-walled membrane structure, the phagophore. Phagophores seal to become autophagosomes, which then fuse with lysosomes to deliver their contents for degradation. Macroautophagy is regulated by numerous cellular factors, including the Class III PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) Vps34 (vacuolar protein sorting 34). The autophagic functions of Vps34 require its recruitment to a complex that includes Vps15, Beclin-1 and Atg14L (autophagy-related 14-like protein) and is known as Vps34 Complex I. We have now identified NRBF2 (nuclear receptor-binding factor 2) as a new member of Vps34 Complex I. NRBF2 binds to complexes that include Vps34, Vps15, Beclin-1 and ATG-14L, but not the Vps34 Complex II component UVRAG (UV radiation resistance-associated gene). NRBF2 directly interacts with Vps15 via the Vps15 WD40 domain as well as other regions of Vps15. The formation of GFP-LC3 (light chain 3) punctae and PE (phosphatidylethanolamine)-conjugated LC3 (LC3-II) in serum-starved cells was inhibited by NRBF2 knockdown in the absence and presence of lysosomal inhibitors, and p62 levels were increased. Thus NRBF2 plays a critical role in the induction of starvation-induced autophagy as a specific member of Vps34 Complex I. 
We previously identified nuclear receptor binding protein 2 (NRBP2) in a screen for genes induced by differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells. Here we show that during embryonic mouse brain development NRBP2 was expressed in the walls of the third and fourth ventricles, and in the hippocampus. In the adult brain, Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and neurons in the CA3 region of the hippocampus were main sites of NRBP2 expression. Analysis of a pediatric medulloblastoma showed that clusters of NRBP2 positive tumor cells co-expressed neurofilament, but not GFAP. Thus, NRBP2 was associated with neuronal differentiation both in normal and malignant brain tissue. We report that NRBP2 is a 55-60 kDa protein with mainly cytoplasmic location. In vitro, NRBP2 protein levels increased as neural stem/progenitor cells differentiated, and its down regulation by siRNA rendered neural progenitor cells more vulnerable to apoptosis. NRBP2 has no previously assigned function and our studies suggest a role for NRBP2 in neural progenitor cell survival.
The class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex I (PI3KC3-C1) is central to autophagy initiation. We previously reported the V-shaped architecture of the four-subunit version of PI3KC3-C1 consisting of VPS (vacuolar protein sorting) 34, VPS15, BECN1 (Beclin 1), and ATG (autophagy-related) 14. Here we show that a putative fifth subunit, nuclear receptor binding factor 2 (NRBF2), is a tightly bound component of the complex that profoundly affects its activity and architecture. NRBF2 enhances the lipid kinase activity of the catalytic subunit, VPS34, by roughly 10-fold. We used hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry and negative-stain electron microscopy to map NRBF2 to the base of the V-shaped complex. NRBF2 interacts primarily with the N termini of ATG14 and BECN1. We show that NRBF2 is a homodimer and drives the dimerization of the larger PI3KC3-C1 complex, with implications for the higher-order organization of the preautophagosomal structure.
Epidemiological studies suggest that levels of n-3 and n-6 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are associated with risk of cardio-metabolic outcomes across different ethnic groups. Recent genome-wide association studies in populations of European ancestry have identified several loci associated with plasma and/or erythrocyte polyunsaturated fatty acids. To identify additional novel loci, we carried out a genome-wide association study in two population-based cohorts consisting of 3521 Chinese participants, followed by a trans-ethnic meta-analysis with meta-analysis results from 8962 participants of European ancestry. Four novel loci (MYB, AGPAT4, DGAT2 and PPT2) reached genome-wide significance in the trans-ethnic meta-analysis (log10(Bayes Factor) ≥ 6). Of them, associations of MYB and AGPAT4 with docosatetraenoic acid (log10(Bayes Factor) = 11.5 and 8.69, respectively) also reached genome-wide significance in the Chinese-specific genome-wide association analyses (P = 4.15 × 10(-14) and 4.30 × 10(-12), respectively), while associations of DGAT2 with gamma-linolenic acid (log10(Bayes Factor) = 6.16) and of PPT2 with docosapentaenoic acid (log10(Bayes Factor) = 6.24) were nominally significant in both Chinese- and European-specific genome-wide association analyses (P ≤ 0.003). We also confirmed previously reported loci including FADS1, NTAN1, NRBF2, ELOVL2 and GCKR. Different effect sizes in FADS1 and independent association signals in ELOVL2 were observed. These results provide novel insight into the genetic background of polyunsaturated fatty acids and their differences between Chinese and European populations. 
Autophagy is an important lysosomal degradation pathway that aids in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis by breaking down and recycling intracellular contents. Dysregulation of autophagy is linked to a growing number of human diseases. The Beclin 1-Vps34 protein-protein interaction network is critical for autophagy regulation and is therefore essential to cellular integrity. Manipulation of autophagy, in particular via modulation of the action of the Beclin 1-Vps34 complexes, is considered a promising route to combat autophagy-related diseases. Here we summarize recent findings on the core components and structural architecture of the Beclin 1-Vps34 complexes, and how these findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie the multiple functions of these complexes and for devising therapeutic strategies.
Genome-wide association studies have identified SNPs near ZNF365 at 10q21.2 that are associated with both breast cancer risk and mammographic density. To identify the most likely causal SNPs, we fine mapped the association signal by genotyping 428 SNPs across the region in 89,050 European and 12,893 Asian case and control subjects from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium. We identified four independent sets of correlated, highly trait-associated variants (iCHAVs), three of which were located within ZNF365. The most strongly risk-associated SNP, rs10995201 in iCHAV1, showed clear evidence of association with both estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (OR = 0.85 [0.82-0.88]) and ER-negative (OR = 0.87 [0.82-0.91]) disease, and was also the SNP most strongly associated with percent mammographic density. iCHAV2 (lead SNP, chr10: 64,258,684:D) and iCHAV3 (lead SNP, rs7922449) were also associated with ER-positive (OR = 0.93 [0.91-0.95] and OR = 1.06 [1.03-1.09]) and ER-negative (OR = 0.95 [0.91-0.98] and OR = 1.08 [1.04-1.13]) disease. There was weaker evidence for iCHAV4, located 5' of ADO, associated only with ER-positive breast cancer (OR = 0.93 [0.90-0.96]). We found 12, 17, 18, and 2 candidate causal SNPs for breast cancer in iCHAVs 1-4, respectively. Chromosome conformation capture analysis showed that iCHAV2 interacts with the ZNF365 and NRBF2 (more than 600 kb away) promoters in normal and cancerous breast epithelial cells. Luciferase assays did not identify SNPs that affect transactivation of ZNF365, but identified a protective haplotype in iCHAV2, associated with silencing of the NRBF2 promoter, implicating this gene in the etiology of breast cancer. 
Multi-subunit tethering complexes control membrane fusion events in eukaryotic cells. Class C core vacuole/endosome tethering (CORVET) and homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) are two such complexes, both containing the Sec1/Munc18 protein subunit VPS33A. Metazoans additionally possess VPS33B, which has considerable sequence similarity to VPS33A but does not integrate into CORVET or HOPS complexes and instead stably interacts with VIPAR. It has been recently suggested that VPS33B and VIPAR comprise two subunits of a novel multi-subunit tethering complex (named "CHEVI"), perhaps analogous in configuration to CORVET and HOPS. We utilized the BioID proximity biotinylation assay to compare and contrast the interactomes of VPS33A and VPS33B. Overall, few proteins were identified as associating with both VPS33A and VPS33B, suggesting that these proteins have distinct sub-cellular localizations. Consistent with previous reports, we observed that VPS33A was co-localized with many components of class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3KC3) complexes: PIK3C3, PIK3R4, NRBF2, UVRAG and RUBICON. Although VPS33A clearly co-localized with several subunits of CORVET and HOPS in this assay, no proteins with the canonical CORVET/HOPS domain architecture were found to co-localize with VPS33B. Instead, we identified that VPS33B interacts directly with CCDC22, a member of the CCC complex. CCDC22 does not co-fractionate with VPS33B and VIPAR in gel filtration of human cell lysates, suggesting that CCDC22 interacts transiently with VPS33B/VIPAR rather than forming a stable complex with these proteins in cells. We also observed that the protein complex containing VPS33B and VIPAR is considerably smaller than CORVET/HOPS, suggesting that the CHEVI complex comprises just VPS33B and VIPAR.
Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease characterized by the deposition of amyloid plaque in the brain. The autophagy-associated PIK3C3-containing phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns3K) complex has been shown to interfere with APP metabolism and amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) homeostasis via poorly understood mechanisms. Here we report that NRBF2 (nuclear receptor binding factor 2), a key component and regulator of the PtdIns3K, is involved in APP-CTFs homeostasis in AD cell models. We found that NRBF2 interacts with APP in vivo and its expression levels are reduced in hippocampus of 5XFAD AD mice; we further demonstrated that NRBF2 overexpression promotes degradation of APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs), and reduces Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 levels in human mutant APP-overexpressing cells. Conversely, APP-CTFs, Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 levels were increased in Nrbf2 knockdown or nrbf2 knockout cells. Furthermore, NRBF2 positively regulates autophagy in neuronal cells and NRBF2-mediated reduction of APP-CTFs levels is autophagy dependent. Importantly, nrbf2 knockout attenuates the recruitment of APP and APP-CTFs into phagophores and the sorting of APP and APP-CTFs into endosomal intralumenal vesicles, which is accompanied by the accumulation of the APP and APP-CTFs into RAB5-positive early endosomes. Collectively, our results reveal the potential connection between NRBF2 and the AD-associated protein APP by showing that NRBF2 plays an important role in regulating degradation of APP-CTFs through modulating autophagy.
NRBF2/Atg38 has been identified as the fifth subunit of the macroautophagic/autophagic class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns3K) complex, along with ATG14/Barkor, BECN1/Vps30, PIK3R4/p150/Vps15 and PIK3C3/Vps34. However, its functional mechanism and regulation are not fully understood. Here, we report that NRBF2 is a fine tuning regulator of PtdIns3K controlled by phosphorylation. Human NRBF2 is phosphorylated by MTORC1 at S113 and S120. Upon nutrient starvation or MTORC1 inhibition, NRBF2 phosphorylation is diminished. Phosphorylated NRBF2 preferentially interacts with PIK3C3/PIK3R4. Suppression of NRBF2 phosphorylation by MTORC1 inhibition alters its binding preference from PIK3C3/PIK3R4 to ATG14/BECN1, leading to increased autophagic PtdIns3K complex assembly, as well as enhancement of ULK1 protein complex association. Consequently, NRBF2 in its unphosphorylated form promotes PtdIns3K lipid kinase activity and autophagy flux, whereas its phosphorylated form blocks them. This study reveals NRBF2 as a critical molecular switch of PtdIns3K and autophagy activation, and its on/off state is precisely controlled by MTORC1 through phosphorylation.
The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase Vps34 is part of several protein complexes. The structural organization of heterotetrameric complexes is starting to emerge, but little is known about organization of additional accessory subunits that interact with these assemblies. Combining hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy (EM), we have characterized Atg38 and its human ortholog NRBF2, accessory components of complex I consisting of Vps15-Vps34-Vps30/Atg6-Atg14 (yeast) and PIK3R4/VPS15-PIK3C3/VPS34-BECN1/Beclin 1-ATG14 (human). HDX-MS shows that Atg38 binds the Vps30-Atg14 subcomplex of complex I, using mainly its N-terminal MIT domain and bridges the coiled-coil I regions of Atg14 and Vps30 in the base of complex I. The Atg38 C-terminal domain is important for localization to the phagophore assembly site (PAS) and homodimerization. Our 2.2 Å resolution crystal structure of the Atg38 C-terminal homodimerization domain shows 2 segments of α-helices assembling into a mushroom-like asymmetric homodimer with a 4-helix cap and a parallel coiled-coil stalk. One Atg38 homodimer engages a single complex I. This is in sharp contrast to human NRBF2, which also forms a homodimer, but this homodimer can bridge 2 complex I assemblies.
Bacterial response to metals can require complex regulation. We report an overlapping regulation for copper and zinc resistance genes in the denitrifying bacterium, Pseudomonas stutzeri RCH2, by three two-component regulatory proteins CopR1, CopR2 and CzcR. We conducted genome-wide evaluations to identify gene targets of two paralogous regulators, CopR1 and CopR2, annotated for copper signaling, and compared the results with the gene targets for CzcR, implicated in zinc signaling. We discovered that the CopRs and CzcR have largely common targets, and crossregulate a core set of P. stutzeri copper and zinc responsive genes. We established that this crossregulation is enabled by a conserved binding motif in the upstream regulatory regions of the target genes. The crossregulation is physiologically relevant as these regulators synergistically and antagonistically target multicopper oxidases, metal efflux and sequestration systems. CopR1 and CopR2 upregulate two cop operons encoding copper tolerance genes, while all three regulators downregulate a putative copper chaperone, Psest_1595. CzcR also upregulated the oprD gene and the CzcIABC Zn2+ efflux system, while CopR1 and CopR2 downregulated these genes. Our study suggests that crossregulation of copper and zinc homeostasis can be advantageous, and in P. stutzeri this is enabled by shared binding motifs for multiple response regulators.
Bats comprise 20% of all mammalian species and display a number of characteristics, including true flight, echolocation, and a heightened ability to resist viral load that uniquely position this group for comparative genomic studies. Here we searched for evidence of genomic variation consistent with sensory rewiring through bat evolution. We focused on two species with divergent sensory preferences. Myotis davidii is a bat species that echolocates and possesses dim- but not daylight-adapted vision whereas the black flying fox (Pteropus alecto) has highly developed day vision but does not echolocate. Using the naked mole rat as a reference, we found five functional genes (CYP1A2, RBP3, GUCY2F, CRYBB1, and GRK7) encoding visual proteins that have degenerated into pseudogenes in M. davidii but not P. alecto. In a second approach genome-wide codon usage bias (CUB) was compared between the two bat species. This CUB ranking systematically enriched for vision-related (CLN8, RD3, IKZF1, LAMC3, CRX, SOX8, VAX2, HPS1, RHO, PRPH2, and SOX9) and hearing-related (TPRN, TMIE, SLC52A3, OTOF, WFS1, SOD1, TBX18, MAP1A, OTOS, GPX1, and USH1G) machinery in M. davidii but not P. alecto. All vision and hearing genes selectively enriched in M. davidii for which orthologs could be identified also were more biased in the echolocating M. lucifugus than the nonecholocating P. vampyrus. We suggest that the existence of codon bias in vision- and hearing-related genes in a species that has evolved echolocation implies CUB is part of evolution's toolkit to rewire sensory systems. We propose that the two genetic changes (pseudogene formation and CUB) collectively paint a picture of that incorporates a combination of destruction and gain-of-function. Together, they help explain how natural selection has reduced physiological costs associated with the development of a smaller eye poorly adapted to day vision but that also contribute to enhanced dim light vision and the hearing adaptations consonant with echolocation. 
The aim of the present study was to explore whether the supercritical-carbon dioxide fluid extract from flowers and buds of Chrysanthemum indicum (SEC) exhibits antidepressant-like effects in a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced mice model. Firstly, SEC was found to reverse a CUMS-induced decrease in the body weight gain in mice. Next, SEC was found to alleviate CUMS-induced depressive-like behavior, evidenced by the reversal of the decrease in the sucrose consumption in the sucrose preference test (SPT), the increase in the locomotor activity in the open field test (OPF), and the alleviation of immobility duration in both the forced swimming test (FST), and tail-suspension test (TST). SEC also attenuated CUMS-induced hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by decreasing the levels of serum corticosterone and (CORT) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and hypothalamus corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH). In addition, SEC was found to suppress the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 in the hippocampal of CUMS mice. Interestingly, further investigations demonstrated that SEC inhibited CUMS-induced activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes pathways but upregulated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression and promoted phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) in hippocampal. In summary, SEC was able to alleviate depressive-like behavior in a CUMS-induced mice model, accompanied by inhibitory roles in the hyperactivity of the HPA axis and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Modulating the NF-κB/NLRP3 and BDNF/CREB/ERK pathways contributed to SEC-mediated antidepressant-like effects.
Humans are exposed to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) from sources of both continuing discharges and environmental legacies, and the health effects of low dose exposure remain unknown. We assessed the effects of PFOS at 0.2-200 nmol/L on osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs). PFOS affected hBMSCs differentiation in a nonmonotonic dose-response relationship, where the effects peaked at 100 nmol/L. PFOS repressed calcium deposition on day 14 of osteogenic differentiation. The molecular osteogenic biomarkers, osteopontin, osteonectin and osteocalcin, and the transcription factor β-catenin, were also decreased on differentiation day 7. In hBMSCs co-treated by PFOS and WNT signaling agonist, LiCl, the osteogenic marker levels were higher than those treated by PFOS alone. Moreover, the osteogenic effect of PFOS was repressed by DKK1, the WNT signaling antagonist. PFOS additionally supported the receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand/osteoprotegerin ratio. In contrast, PFOS enhanced adipogenesis in regard to lipid droplet formation and marker gene expression of PPARγ, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α (C/EBPα), lipoprotein lipase and leptin. Microarray analysis identified 597 differentially expressed genes at p &lt; .05 and log2 (fold change) &gt; 0.3. These results demonstrated that PFOS repressed osteogenesis and enhanced adipogenesis, which could well explain the homeostatic imbalance seen in human bone associated with exposure to PFOS.
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration causes immunoactivation, which negatively affects production and fertility, but experimental exposure via an acute bolus is unlikely to resemble natural infections. Thus, the objectives were to characterize effects of chronic endotoxemia on production parameters and follicular development in estrous-synchronized lactating cows. Eleven Holstein cows (169 ± 20 d in milk; 681 ± 16 kg of body weight) were acclimated to their environmental surroundings for 3 d and then enrolled in 2 experimental periods (P). During P1 (3 d) cows consumed feed ad libitum and baseline samples were obtained. During P2 (7 d), cows were assigned to continuous infusion of either (1) saline-infused and pair-fed (CON-PF; 40 mL/h of saline i.v.; n = 5) or (2) LPS infused and ad libitum fed (LPS-AL; Escherichia coli O55:B5; 0.017, 0.020, 0.026, 0.036, 0.055, 0.088, and 0.148 μg/kg of body weight/h i.v. on d 1 to 7, respectively; n = 6). Controls were pair-fed to the LPS-AL group to eliminate confounding effects of dissimilar nutrient intake. Infusing LPS temporally caused mild hyperthermia on d 1 to 3 (+0.49°C) relative to baseline. Dry matter intake of LPS-AL cows decreased (28%) on d 1 of P2, then progressively returned to baseline. Relative to baseline, milk yield from LPS-AL cows was decreased on d 1 of P2 (12%). No treatment differences were observed in milk yield during P2. Follicular growth, dominant follicle size, serum progesterone (P4), and follicular P4 and 17β-estradiol concentrations were similar between treatments. Serum 17β-estradiol tended to increase (115%) and serum amyloid A and LPS-binding protein were increased (118 and 40%, respectively) in LPS-AL relative to CON-PF cows. Compared with CON-PF, neutrophils in LPS-AL cows were initially increased (45%), then gradually decreased. In contrast, monocytes were initially decreased (40%) and progressively increased with time in the LPS-AL cows. Hepatic mRNA abundance of cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily C (CYP2C) or CYP3A was not affected by LPS, nor was there a treatment effect on toll-like receptor 4 or LBP; however, acyloxyacyl hydrolase and RELA subunit of nuclear factor kappa B tended to be increased in LPS-AL cows. These data suggest lactating dairy cows become tolerant to chronic and exponentially increasing LPS infusion in terms of production and reproductive parameters.
To reveal how cells exit human pluripotency, we designed a CRISPR-Cas9 screen exploiting the metabolic and epigenetic differences between naïve and primed pluripotent cells. We identify the tumor suppressor, Folliculin(FLCN) as a critical gene required for the exit from human pluripotency. Here we show that FLCN Knock-out (KO) hESCs maintain the naïve pluripotent state but cannot exit the state since the critical transcription factor TFE3 remains active in the nucleus. TFE3 targets up-regulated in FLCN KO exit assay are members of Wnt pathway and ESRRB. Treatment of FLCN KO hESC with a Wnt inhibitor, but not ESRRB/FLCN double mutant, rescues the cells, allowing the exit from the naïve state. Using co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis we identify unique FLCN binding partners. The interactions of FLCN with components of the mTOR pathway (mTORC1 and mTORC2) reveal a mechanism of FLCN function during exit from naïve pluripotency.
Multiple syndromes share congenital heart and craniofacial muscle defects, indicating there is an intimate relationship between the adjacent cardiac and pharyngeal muscle (PM) progenitor fields. However, mechanisms that direct antagonistic lineage decisions of the cardiac and PM progenitors within the anterior mesoderm of vertebrates are not understood. Here, we identify that retinoic acid (RA) signaling directly promotes the expression of the transcription factor Nr2f1a within the anterior lateral plate mesoderm. Using zebrafish nr2f1a and nr2f2 mutants, we find that Nr2f1a and Nr2f2 have redundant requirements restricting ventricular cardiomyocyte (CM) number and promoting development of the posterior PMs. Cre-mediated genetic lineage tracing in nr2f1a; nr2f2 double mutants reveals that tcf21+ progenitor cells, which can give rise to ventricular CMs and PM, more frequently become ventricular CMs potentially at the expense of posterior PMs in nr2f1a; nr2f2 mutants. Our studies reveal insights into the molecular etiology that may underlie developmental syndromes that share heart, neck and facial defects as well as the phenotypic variability of congenital heart defects associated with NR2F mutations in humans.
Tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) represents one of the greatest threats to human health., Interferons (IFNs) in combination with the first-line of anti-TB drugs have been used for treating TB for decades in the clinic, but how Mtb infection regulates interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in human macrophages (Mϕs) remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the expression-signature and associated innate signaling mechanisms of ISGs in Mtb-infected human monocyte-derived Mϕs (hMDMs) and THP-1-derived Mϕs (THP-1-Mϕs). Among 28 of the detected ISGs, 90% of them exerted a significant increase in Mtb-infected Mϕs. Additionally, we found that cytosolic cyclic (GMP-AMP) synthase (cGAS), toll-like receptor-2 (TLR-2) and TLR-4 signaling pathways participated in ISG induction. Their downstream elements of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) were selectively involved in Mtb-mediated ISG production. Finally, the numerous types of ISG expression in hMDMs of TB patients were more susceptible to restimulation of Mtb infection or/and IFN treatment than that of healthy people. Hence, different signaling pathways define different ISG expression during Mtb infection and this helps to illustrate how ISGs are elucidated and to better understand the host immune responses to Mtb infection in Mϕs.

                    Background/Aim: Radiolabelling of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) could be beneficial in cancer diagnosis and therapy, however it may cause structural changes and consequently deteriorate their immunoreactivity. Materials and Methods: The therapeutic mAb ramucirumab (RAM) was technetium-99m labelled using either a direct or an indirect method with the use of two bifunctional chelating agents (HYNIC, DTPA). The radiochemical purity was assessed using instant thin-layer chromatography (ITLC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique. The affinity of radiolabelled RAM was tested on human cancer cell lines. Results: The radiolabelling provided the following stable compounds: [
                    99m
                    Tc]RAM, [
                    99m
                    Tc]HYNIC-RAM and [
                    99m
                    Tc]DTPA-RAM. Their radiochemical purity was over 95%. All prepared radiopharmaceuticals showed moderate affinity to the targeted receptor, in vitro. However, their affinity was one order lower compared to that of the natural mAb. Moreover, directly and DTPA-radiolabelled RAM demonstrated less favourable binding kinetics. Conclusion: Radiolabelling negatively affected the affinity of RAM to its targeted receptor.
                
Inflammation is a prominent feature of the neuropathology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Emerging evidence suggests that inflammatory cascades contributing to the disease progression are not restricted to the central nervous system (CNS) but also occur peripherally. Indeed, alterations in T cell responses and their secreted cytokines have been detected in ALS patients and in animal models of ALS. One key cytokine responsible for the shift in T cell responses is interleukin-33 (IL-33), which stimulates innate type 2 immune cells to produce a large amount of Th2 cytokines that are possibly beneficial in the recovery processes of CNS injuries. Since the levels of IL-33 have been shown to be decreased in patients affected with ALS, we sought to determine whether a long-term recombinant IL-33 treatment of a transgenic mouse model of ALS expressing G93A-superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1-G93A) alters the disease progression and ameliorates the ALS-like disease pathology. SOD1-G93A mice were treated with intraperitoneal injections of IL-33 and effects on disease onset and inflammatory status were determined. Spinal cord (SC) neurons, astrocytes and T-cells were exposed to IL-33 to evaluate the cell specific responses to IL-33. Treatment of SOD1-G93A mice with IL-33 delayed the disease onset in female mice, decreased the proportion of CD4+ and CD8 + T cell populations in the spleen and lymph nodes, and alleviated astrocytic activation in the ventral horn of the lumbar SC. Male SOD1-G93A mice were unresponsive to the treatment. In vitro studies showed that IL-33 is most likely not acting directly on neurons and astrocytes, but rather conveying its effects through peripheral T-cells. Our results suggest that strategies directed to the peripheral immune system may have therapeutic potential in ALS. The effect of gender dimorphisms to the treatment efficacy needs to be taken into consideration when designing new therapeutic strategies for CNS diseases.
Ultraviolet (UV) radiation of the sunlight, especially UVA and UVB, is the primary environmental cause of skin damage, including topical inflammation, premature skin aging, and skin cancer. Previous reports show that activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in human skin fibroblasts and keratinocytes after UV exposure induces the expression and release of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and subsequently leads to the production of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) and growth factor basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Here, we demonstrated that TNFR2-SKEE and TNFR2-SKE, oligopeptides from TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2)-binding site of TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2), strongly inhibited the interaction of TNFR1 as well as TNFR2 with TRAF2. In particular, TNFR2-SKE suppressed UVB- or TNF-α-induced nuclear translocalization of activated NF-κB in mouse fibroblasts. It decreased the expression of bFGF, MMPs, and COX2, which were upregulated by TNF-α, and increased procollagen production, which was reduced by TNF-α. Furthermore, TNFR2-SKE inhibited the UVB-induced proliferation of keratinocytes and melanocytes in the mouse skin and the infiltration of immune cells into inflamed tissues. These results suggest that TNFR2-SKE may possess the clinical potency to alleviate UV-induced photoaging in human skin.
Compelling evidence shows that deregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators in the progression of melanoma. miR-145-5p has been suggested to exhibit antitumorigenic activity in melanoma. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the biological activity of miR-145-5p in melanoma remains to be further understood. Herein, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to examine the miR-145-5p expression in malignant melanoma tissues and cells. The interaction between miR-145-5p and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was explored by bioinformatics analyses, luciferase reporter assay, and Western blot. The effects of miR-145-5p or combined with TLR4 on cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion abilities were investigated by (4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, colony formation, wound healing, and transwell assays, respectively. The melanoma xenograft tumor models were established to determine the biological activity of miR-145-5p in melanoma in vivo. In addition, the changes of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway were analyzed by detecting the NF-κB activity and the NF-κB p65 protein level. We observed that the miR-145-5p expression was underexpressed in melanoma tissues and cells. miR-145-5p suppressed the TLR4 expression by binding to its 3'untranslated region in melanoma cells. Moreover, TLR4 overexpression abolished the inhibition of cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion abilities induced by miR-145-5p in melanoma cells. Meanwhile, miR-145-5p was confirmed to restrain melanoma tumor growth in vivo by targeting TLR4. Furthermore, miR-145-5p overexpression inactivated the NF-κB pathway in melanoma in vitro and in vivo, which was reversed by TLR4 overexpression. We concluded that miR-145-5p hindered the occurrence and metastasis of melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo by targeting TLR4 via inactivation of the NF-κB pathway.
The major neoplastic and proliferative component of GCTB is the stromal tumor cells; that they have shown no evidence of bone destruction, instead the massive tissue destruction appears to be a result of tumor induced osteoclastogenesis. The discovery of receptor activator of nuclear factor kB (RANK) and RANK binding ligand (RANKL) uncovered the bone homeostasis and molecular mechanism by which multiple compounds (including vitamin D) regulated osteoclast differentiation; a function mediated by osteoblastic cells and osteoclast-precursor cells.
In a country burdened by vitamin D deficiency, causal relation between hypovitaminosis D and GCTB was hypothesized based on the vitamin D mediated RANKL expression and osteoclastogenesis, as India is also a population with higher incidence of GCTB as compared to Western populations described in the literature. The possibility of vitamin D regulated osteoclastogenesis in GCTB is postulated on the evidence from molecular research linking it to the RANK/RANKL/OPG pathway. The aim of this study was to analyse the prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency in patients with primary GCTB and to elucidate any difference in serum Vitamin 25(OD)D3 levels amongst the matched control population data.
130 patients of primary GCTBs were matched to 310 controls from the general health check population and serum levels of 25(OH)D3 were analyzed. Statistical analysis performed on the non-parametric data and Mann Whitney U Test used to derive inference with significance set at p &lt; 0.05. 56 females and 76 males with median Vitamin D level in the GCTB group was 15.9 ng/ml (Mean 19.41; Range 1.03 to 92) as compared to the control population with median level of 22.2 ng/ml (Mean 25.1; Range 2.6 to 87.9). The results were significant (p value &lt; 0.05) as compared to the control population in all decades except the third decade (p value 0.0548).
The differential expression of RANKL and OPG in response to levels of vitamin D has been established. The stromal cells of osteolytic GCTB express high levels of RANKL, which is a key signal regulator in development of this disease and bone destruction typical of GCTBs. This has resulted in research targeting this pathway for therapeutic approach in GCTBs. As vitamin D supplementation is simple and safe, increased awareness to assess and if necessary correct vitamin D status of patients is warranted, however the question as to whether patients with low vitamin D levels are more prone to develop GCTB and thus would profit from vitamin D supplementation remains unanswered. To conclude, it is essential to assess vitamin D levels in patients with GCTB as deficiency is pronounced. Future research on this hypothesis might lead to an association between Vitamin D deficiency and the onset/natural history of GCTB that may in the future help us cure or prevent GCTBs.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are members of a nuclear receptor family of ligand-dependent transcription factors. Three isoforms of PPAR named PPARα, PPARβ/δ, and PPARγ have been described, each encoded by a separate gene: PPARA, PPARD, and PPARG, respectively. In the present study, we examined the profiles of PPAR and retinoid X receptor (RXR; PPAR heterodimer partner) mRNA expression and PPAR DNA binding activity in porcine trophoblast tissue collected on days 15, 20, 25, and 30 of pregnancy and in day-20 embryos. Placenta trophoblast cells isolated on day 25 of pregnancy were used to determine effects of (1) cytokines on PPAR and RXR mRNA expression and (2) PPAR agonists on prostaglandin (PG) E2 synthesis and the expression of genes involved in steroidogenesis, fatty acid binding, and PG transport, as well as on cell proliferation. The mRNA expression of PPARA and RXRB was greater in trophoblast tissue collected on days 25 and 30 of pregnancy compared with day 15 (P &lt; 0.05), while DNA binding activity of PPARα decreased between day 15 and 25 (P &lt; 0.05). Increased concentrations of PPARD and RXRA transcripts were observed in trophoblasts collected on day 20 compared to trophoblasts from days 15 and 30 (P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, concentrations of DNA-bound PPARβ/δ and PPARγ proteins increased in day-30 trophoblasts compared to day 15 (P &lt; 0.01) and day 20 (P &lt; 0.05), respectively. On day 20 of gestation, the mRNA expression of PPARD, PPARG, and RXRA and protein levels of PPARα and PPARγ isoforms were greater in trophoblast than embryonic tissue (P &lt; 0.01). Interleukin 1β and/or interferon γ, but not IL6 and leukemia inhibitory factor, upregulated PPAR and RXR mRNA expression in placenta trophoblast cells in vitro (P &lt; 0.05). Rosiglitazone (a PPARγ agonist) stimulated prostaglandin E synthase mRNA expression in trophoblast cells and PGE2 accumulation in incubation medium (P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, activation of PPAR isoforms differentially affected the expression of genes involved in steroidogenesis, fatty acid binding, and PG transport in studied cells. Finally, PPARα and PPARγ agonists stimulated trophoblast cell proliferation (P &lt; 0.05), and this effect was abolished by the addition of a respective PPAR antagonist (P &lt; 0.05). Overall, these results point to a role of PPAR isoforms in porcine placenta development and function.
We investigated the effects of 29-kDa amino-terminal fibronectin fragment (29-kDa FN-f) on xylosyltransferase-1 (XT-1), an essential anabolic enzyme that catalyzes the initial and rate-determining step in glycosaminoglycan chain synthesis, in human primary chondrocytes.
Proteoglycan and XT-1 expression in cartilage tissue was analyzed using safranin O staining and immunohistochemistry. The effects of 29-kDa FN-f on XT-1 expression and its relevant signaling pathway were analyzed by quantitative real-time-PCR, immunoblotting, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and immunoprecipitation assays. The receptors for 29-kDa FN-f were investigated using small interference RNA and blocking antibodies.
The expression of XT-1 was significantly lower in human osteoarthritis cartilage than in normal cartilage. Intra-articular injection of 29-kDa FN-f reduced proteoglycan levels and XT-1 expression in murine cartilage. In addition, in 29-kDa FN-f-treated cells, XT-1 expression was significantly suppressed at both the mRNA and protein levels, modulated by the transcription factors specificity protein 1 (Sp1), Sp3, and activator protein 1 (AP-1). The 29-kDa FN-f suppressed the binding of Sp1 to the promoter region of XT-1 and enhanced the binding of Sp3 and AP-1. Inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathways restored the 29-kDa FN-f-inhibited XT-1 expression, along with the altered expression of Sp1 and Sp3. Blockading toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2) and integrin α5β1 via siRNA and blocking antibodies revealed that the effects of 29-kDa FN-f on XT-1 expression were mediated through the TLR-2 and integrin α5β1 signaling pathways.
These results demonstrate that 29-kDa FN-f negatively affects cartilage anabolism by regulating glycosaminoglycan formation through XT-1.
Aptamers are oligonucleotide or peptide molecules that bind to a target molecule with high affinity and specificity. The present study aimed to evaluate the target specificity and applicability for in vivo molecular imaging of an aptamer labeled with a radioisotope.
The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/ErbB2) aptamer was radiolabeled with 18F-fluoride. HER2-positive tumor cell uptake of the aptamer was evaluated in comparison to negative controls by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Using 18F-labeled HER2-specific aptamer positron emission tomography (PET), in vivo molecular images of BT474 tumor-bearing mice were taken at 60, 90 and 120 minutes after injection.
In flow cytometric analysis, HER2 aptamer showed strong binding to HER2-positive BT474 cells, while binding to HER2-negative MDA-MB231 cells was quite low. Likewise, in confocal microscopic images, the aptamer was bound to HER2-positive breast cancer cells, with minimal binding to HER2-negative cells. In vivo PET molecular imaging of BT474 tumor-bearing mice revealed significant higher uptake of the 18F-labeled HER2 specific aptamer into the tumor compared to the that of HER2-negative cell tumor(p = 0.033). HER2 aptamer was able to preferentially bind to HER2-positive breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo, by recognizing HER2 structure on the surface of these cells.
The 18F-labeled aptamer enabled appropriate visualization of HER2 expression by human breast cancer cells. The results suggest that a radiolabeled HER2 aptamer could potentially be applied in the development of treatment strategies or in targeted therapy against HER2-positive breast cancer cells.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are members of the nuclear receptor family of ligand-dependent transcription factors. PPARs are important regulators of glucose and fatty acid metabolism, apoptosis, angiogenesis, cell proliferation and differentiation, and immune response. Their possible role in the female reproductive tract was demonstrated. In the present study, cultured luminal epithelial (LE) and stromal (ST) cells of the porcine endometrium were used to examine (1) the effect of conceptus exposed medium (CEM) on mRNA and protein expression and DNA binding activity of PPARA, PPARD, and PPARG isoforms, and (2) the effect of PPARA, PPARD, and PPARG agonists on the expression of selected genes, apoptosis, and cell proliferation. The addition of CEM stimulated PPARA expression and DNA binding activity of this isoform in LE and ST cells (P &lt; 0.05). Increased expression of PPARD mRNA in the presence of CEM was detected in ST cells (P &lt; 0.05), while the concentration of PPARG transcripts decreased in response to CEM in both cell types (P &lt; 0.05). LE and ST cells of the pig endometrium possess PPARA, PPARD, and PPARG proteins, with clear nuclear staining visible predominately in ST cells. In LE cells, activation of PPARG with 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin(PG)J2 down-regulated the expression of genes encoding amino acid transporter 1 (SLC38A1), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and enzymes involved in PG synthesis (P &lt; 0.05). In ST cells, activation of PPARD isoform with both agonists used (L-165,041 and cPGI2) and PPARG isoform with 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 increased vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) mRNA expression (P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, GW9578 (PPARA agonist) and 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 stimulated glucose transporter 1 (SLC2A1) gene expression in ST cells. 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 was also effective in up-regulation of the ratio of BAX/BCL2 mRNA expression and active caspase-3 concentration in ST cells (P &lt; 0.05). Finally, GW9578 stimulated LE and ST cell proliferation, while rosiglitazone (PPARG agonist) increased the number of viable ST but not LE cells. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that conceptus products differentially modulate PPARs expression and activity in the porcine endometrium. Activation of PPARs may in turn affect nutrient transport, PG synthesis, angiogenesis, apoptosis, or cell proliferation in this tissue. Therefore, PPAR isoforms seem to play an important role in development and function of the porcine uterus.
The molecular pathogenesis of salivary gland acinic cell carcinoma (AciCC) is poorly understood. The secretory Ca-binding phosphoprotein (SCPP) gene cluster at 4q13 encodes structurally related phosphoproteins of which some are specifically expressed at high levels in the salivary glands and constitute major components of saliva. Here we report on recurrent rearrangements [t(4;9)(q13;q31)] in AciCC that translocate active enhancer regions from the SCPP gene cluster to the region upstream of Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4 Group A Member 3 (NR4A3) at 9q31. We show that NR4A3 is specifically upregulated in AciCCs, and that active chromatin regions and gene expression signatures in AciCCs are highly correlated with the NR4A3 transcription factor binding motif. Overexpression of NR4A3 in mouse salivary gland cells increases expression of known NR4A3 target genes and has a stimulatory functional effect on cell proliferation. We conclude that NR4A3 is upregulated through enhancer hijacking and has important oncogenic functions in AciCC.
Alterations of the 5-HT1A receptor and BDNF have consistently been associated with affective disorders. Two functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs6295 of the serotonin 1A receptor gene (HTR1A) and rs6265 of brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene (BDNF), may impact transcriptional regulation and expression of the 5-HT1A receptor. Here we investigated interaction effects of rs6295 and rs6265 on 5-HT1A receptor binding. Forty-six healthy subjects were scanned with PET using the radioligand [carbonyl-11C]WAY-100635. Genotyping was performed for rs6265 and rs6295. Subjects showing a genotype with at least three risk alleles (G of rs6295 or A of rs6265) were compared to control genotypes. Cortical surface binding potential (BPND) was computed for 32 cortical regions of interest (ROI). Mixed model was applied to study main and interaction effects of ROI and genotype. ANOVA was used for post hoc analyses. Individuals with the risk genotypes exhibited an increase in 5-HT1A receptor binding by an average of 17% (mean BPND 3.56 ± 0.74 vs. 2.96 ± 0.88). Mixed model produced an interaction effect of ROI and genotype on BPND and differences could be demonstrated in 10 ROI post hoc. The combination of disadvantageous allelic expression of rs6295 and rs6265 may result in a 5-HT1A receptor profile comparable to affective disorders as increased 5-HT1A receptor binding is a well published phenotype of depression. Thus, epistasis between BDNF and HTR1A may contribute to the multifactorial risk for affective disorders and our results strongly advocate further research on this genetic signature in affective disorders.
Renal fibrosis is a significant characteristic of chronic kidney diseases. Surfactant protein A (SP-A) is a recently identified fibrosis-associated factor in lung fibrosis; however, whether SP-A has the same role in renal fibrosis has remained elusive. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of SP-A and its receptor calreticulin (CRT) in the pathogenesis of kidney fibrosis. The HK-2 human tubular epithelial cell line was cultured and treated with SP-A and SP-A + anti-CRT. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at 30, 60 and 120 min was examined. Furthermore, cell apoptosis was assessed using an Annexin V assay and the expression of various proteins was measured using western blot analysis. In addition, the cell culture supernatants were collected and the expression of type I collagen was examined using ELISA. Compared with the control group, SP-A treatment significantly increased the ROS production, type I collagen secretion and cell apoptosis, which was partially inhibited by addition of anti-CRT. Furthermore, downregulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2 and -9 as well as upregulation of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 indicated that SP-A treatment increased the degree of fibrosis in HK-2 cells, while addition of anti-CRT alleviated the fibrotic conditions. Finally, SP-A treatment significantly increased the expression of phosphorylated (p)-p38, p-p-65 and NADPH oxidase 2, which was partially inhibited by addition of anti-CRT. In conclusion, SP-A may participate in the pathogenesis of kidney fibrosis through binding to CRT and activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase/nuclear factor-κB-associated oxidative stress signaling pathway.
HNF4α is a culprit gene product for a monogenic and dominantly-inherited form of diabetes, referred to as MODY1 (Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young type 1). Reduced HNF4α activities have been linked to impaired insulin secretion and β-cell function. Numerous mutations have been identified from the patients and they have been instructive as to the individual residue's role in protein structure-function and dysfunction. As a member of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily, HNF4α is made of characteristic modular domains and it functions exclusively as a homodimer despite its sequence homology to RXR, a common heterodimer partner of non-steroidal NRs. Transcription factors commonly dimerize to enhance their molecular functions mainly by facilitating the recognition of double helix target DNAs that display an intrinsic pseudo-2-fold symmetry and the recruitment of the remainder of the main transcriptional machinery. HNF4α is no exception and its dimerization is maintained by the ligand binding domain (LBD) mainly through the leucine-zipper-like interactions at the stalk of two interacting helices. Although many MODY1 mutations have been previously characterized, including DNA binding disruptors, ligand binding disruptors, coactivator binding disruptors, and protein stability disruptors, protein dimerization disruptors have not been formally reported. In this report, we present a set of data for the two MODY1 mutations found right at the dimerization interface (L332 P and L328del mutations) which clearly exhibit the disruptive effects of directly affecting dimerization, protein stability, and transcriptional activities. These data reinforced the fact that MODY mutations are loss-of-function mutations and HNF4α dimerization is essential for its optimal function and normal physiology.
The E-cadherin loss has frequently been associated with transcriptional repression mediated by transcription factors, such as the Zinc Finger E-Box Binding Homeobox-2 (ZEB2). Invasive micropapillary carcinomas (IMPCs) of the breast are aggressive neoplasms frequently related to lymph node metastasis and poor overall survival. In the canine mammary gland, IMPCs has just been reported and, based on its behavioral similarity with the human IMPCs, appears to be a good spontaneous model to this human entity. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between E-cadherin and ZEB2 in a spontaneous canine model of invasive micropapillary carcinoma of the mammary gland. The correlation among gene expression (ZEB2 and CDH1) and clinicopathological findings was also explored. Nineteen cases of IMPC of the canine mammary gland were obtained, protein and mRNA expression were investigated through immunohistochemistry and RNA In Situ Hybridization, respectively. To better understand the relationship between E-cadherin and ZEB2, immunofluorescence was performed in canine IMPCs. Immunohistochemically, most of IMPCs showed 1+ (14/19, 73.7%) for E-cadherin; and positivity for ZEB2 was diagnosed in 47.4% of the IMPCs. Regarding the RNA In Situ Hybridization (ISH), most of IMPCs showed 4+ and 0+ for E-cadherin (CDH1) and ZEB2 respectively. Through immunofluorescence, the first and second more frequent combinatorial group were E-cadherin+ZEB2- and E-cadherin+ZEB2+; neoplastic cells showing concomitantly weak expression for E-cadherin and positivity for ZEB2 were frequently observed. A negative correlation was observed between E-cadherin and progesterone receptor expression in IMPCs. Based on these results, canine mammary IMPCs show E-cadherin lost and, at times reveals nuclear positivity for the transcription factor ZEB2 that seems to exert transcriptional repression of the CDH1.
Inflammation plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of depression. However, not all individuals exposed to inflammatory challenge develop depression, and identifying those at risk is necessary to develop targeted monitoring, prevention, and treatment strategies. Within a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study (n = 115), we examined whether leukocyte transcriptome profiles predicted inflammation-induced depressed mood in volunteers who received low-dose intravenous endotoxin (n = 58; aged 18-50). At baseline, transcription factor (TF) activities were assessed using genome-wide transcriptional profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and promoter-based bioinformatic analyses. Then, participants were administered endotoxin. Self-reported depressed mood was assessed using the Profile of Mood States. Based on extant studies linking transcriptional profiles to depressive disorder, we examined whether post-endotoxin depressed mood is predicted by baseline activity of TFs related to immune activation, sympathetic activation, and glucocorticoid insensitivity: respectively, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), and glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Twenty-one participants (36%) experienced an increase in depressed mood from baseline to 2 h post endotoxin, when depressive response peaks. Bioinformatics analyses controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index, and physical sickness response revealed that post-endotoxin depressed mood was predicted by increased baseline activity of TFs related to inflammation (NF-kB) and beta-adrenergic signaling (CREB) and by decreased activity of GR-related TFs (P's &lt; 0.001). Inflammation-induced depressed mood is predicted by peripheral transcriptome profiles related to immune activation, sympathetic activation, and glucocorticoid insensitivity. With further replication, these stress-related molecular profiles could be used for a novel genomic approach for identifying individuals at high-risk for the inflammatory subtype of depression.
Acacetin (5,7-dihydroxy-4'-methoxyflavone), a potential neuroprotective agent, has an inhibitory effect on lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammatory reactions. However, whether acacetin has an effect on inflammatory corpuscle 3 (NLRP3) after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury has not been fully determined. This study used an improved suture method to establish a cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury model in C57BL/6 mice. After ischemia with middle cerebral artery occlusion for 1 hour, reperfusion with intraperitoneal injection of 25 mg/kg of acacetin (acacetin group) or an equal volume of saline (0.1 mL/10 g, middle cerebral artery occlusion group) was used to investigate the effect of acacetin on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. Infarct volume and neurological function scores were determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining and the Zea-Longa scoring method. Compared with the middle cerebral artery occlusion group, neurological function scores and cerebral infarction volumes were significantly reduced in the acacetin group. To understand the effect of acacetin on microglia-mediated inflammatory response after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, immunohistochemistry for the microglia marker calcium adapter protein ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) was examined in the hippocampus of ischemic brain tissue. In addition, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6 expression in ischemic brain tissue of mice was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Expression of Iba1, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β and interleukin-6 was significantly lower in the acacetin group compared with the middle cerebral artery occlusion group. Western blot assay results showed that expression of Toll-like receptor 4, nuclear factor kappa B, NLRP3, procaspase-1, caspase-1, pro-interleukin-1β, and interleukin-1β were significantly lower in the acacetin group compared with the middle cerebral artery occlusion group. Our findings indicate that acacetin has a protective effect on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, and its mechanism of action is associated with inhibition of microglia-mediated inflammation and the NLRP3 signaling pathway.
Objective- Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) transformation to an osteochondrogenic phenotype is an initial step toward arterial calcification, which is highly correlated with cardiovascular disease-related morbidity and mortality. TLR2 (Toll-like receptor 2) plays a pathogenic role in the development of vascular diseases, but its regulation in calcification of arteries and VSMCs remains unclear. We postulate that TLR2-mediated inflammation participates in mediating atherosclerotic arterial calcification and VSMC calcification. Approach and Results- We found that ApoE-/- Tlr2-/- genotype in mice suppressed high-fat diet-induced atherosclerotic plaques formation during initiation but progressively lost its preventative capacity, compared with ApoE-/- mice. However, TLR2 deficiency prohibited high-fat diet-induced advanced atherosclerotic calcification, chondrogenic metaplasia, and OPG (osteoprotegerin) downregulation in the calcified lesions. Incubation of VSMCs in a calcifying medium revealed that TLR2 agonists significantly increased VSMC calcification and chondrogenic differentiation. Furthermore, TLR2 deficiency suppressed TLR2 agonist-mediated VSMC chondrogenic differentiation and consequent calcification, which were triggered via the concerted actions of IL (interleukin)-6-mediated RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand) induction and OPG suppression. Inhibition experiments with pharmacological inhibitors demonstrated that IL-6-mediated RANKL induction is signaled by p38 and ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2) pathways, whereas the OPG is suppressed via NF-κB (nuclear factor κB) dependent signaling mediated by ERK1/2. Conclusions- We concluded that on ligand binding, TLR2 activates p38 and ERK1/2 signaling to selectively modulate the upregulation of IL-6-mediated RANKL and downregulation of OPG. These signaling pathways act in concert to induce chondrogenic transdifferentiation of VSMCs, which in turn leads to vascular calcification during the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.
Hepatocyte transplantation is an attractive alternative to liver transplantation. Thus far, however, extensive liver repopulation by adult hepatocytes has required ongoing genetic, physical, or chemical injury to host liver. We hypothesized that providing a regulated proliferative and/or survival advantage to transplanted hepatocytes should enable repopulation in a normal liver microenvironment. Here, we repopulated livers of DPPIV- (dipeptidyl peptidase-4) rats and Ugt1a1 (uridinediphosphoglucuronate glucuronosyltransferase 1a1)-deficient Gunn rats (model of Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1), both models without underlying liver injury, for up to 1 year by transplanting lenti-hYAP-ERT2 (mutated estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain 2)-transduced hepatocytes (YAP-Hc). Yap (yes-associated protein) nuclear translocation/function in YAP-Hc was regulated by tamoxifen. Repopulating YAP-Hc and host hepatocytes were fluorescence-activated cell sorting-purified and their transcriptomic profiles compared by RNAseq. After 1 year of liver repopulation, YAP-Hc clusters exhibited normal morphology, integration into hepatic plates and hepatocyte-specific gene expression, without dysplasia, dedifferentiation, or tumorigenesis. RNAseq analysis showed up-regulation of 145 genes promoting cell proliferation and 305 genes suppressing apoptosis, including hepatocyte growth factor and connective tissue growth factor among the top 30 in each category and provided insight into the mechanism of cell competition that enabled replacement of host hepatocytes by YAP-Hc. In Gunn rats transplanted with YAP-Hc+tamoxifen, there was a 65%-81% decline in serum bilirubin over 6 months versus 8%-20% with control-Hc, representing a 3-4-fold increase in therapeutic response. This correlated with liver repopulation as demonstrated by the presence of Ugt1a1-positive hepatocyte clusters in livers and western blot analysis of tissue homogenates. Conclusion: Tamoxifen-regulated nuclear translocation/function of hYAP-ERT2 enabled long-term repopulation of DPPIV-/- and Gunn rat livers by hYAP-ERT2-transduced hepatocytes without tumorigenesis. This cell transplantation strategy may offer a potential therapy for most of the inherited monogenic liver diseases that do not exhibit liver injury.
Betaglycan (BG) is a membrane-bound co-receptor of the TGF-β family that selectively binds transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) isoforms and inhibin A (InhA) to enable temporal-spatial patterns of signaling essential for their functions in vivo Here, using NMR titrations of methyl-labeled TGF-β2 with BG's C-terminal binding domain, BGZP-C, and surface plasmon resonance binding measurements with TGF-β2 variants, we found that the BGZP-C-binding site on TGF-β2 is located on the inner surface of its extended finger region. Included in this binding site are Ile-92, Lys-97, and Glu-99, which are entirely or mostly specific to the TGF-β isoforms and the InhA α-subunit, but they are unconserved in other TGF-β family growth factors (GFs). In accord with the proposed specificity-determining role of these residues, BG bound bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) weakly or not at all, and TGF-β2 variants with the corresponding residues from BMP-2 bound BGZP-C more weakly than corresponding alanine variants. The BGZP-C-binding site on InhA previously was reported to be located on the outside of the extended finger region, yet at the same time to include Ser-112 and Lys-119, homologous to TGF-β2 Ile-92 and Lys-97, on the inside of the fingers. Therefore, it is likely that both TGF-β2 and InhA bind BGZP-C through a site on the inside of their extended finger regions. Overall, these results identify the BGZP-C-binding site on TGF-β2 and shed light on the specificity of BG for select TGF-β-type GFs and the mechanisms by which BG influences their signaling.
Acute liver injury (ALI) is a life-threatening syndrome accompanied by overwhelming inflammation. Amygdalin (AGD) has been reported to possess various biological activities, particularly anti-inflammatory activity. The current study was designed to assess the protective effects and underlying mechanisms of AGD against ALI induced by d-galactosamine (GalN) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mice. The results indicated that AGD treatment effectively reduced the lethality, ameliorated the histopathological liver changes, reduced the malondialdehyde (MDA) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels, and decreased the alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels resulting from LPS/GalN challenge. Moreover, AGD significantly inhibited LPS/GalN-induced inflammatory responses in mice with ALI by reducing not only the secretion of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 but also the protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Additionally, our results demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of AGD was due to the suppressed activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and nucleotide-binding domain (NOD-)like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activity. Furthermore, AGD treatment substantially increased nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) nuclear translocation and enhanced NAD (P) H: quinoneoxidoreductase 1 protein expression, which was reversed by a Nrf2 inhibitor, in HepG2 cells. In summary, our investigations suggested that the ability of AGD to ameliorate LPS/GalN-induced ALI may involve the inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-κB signalling pathways and the upregulation of the Nrf2/NQO1 signalling pathway.
Glucocorticoids are steroid hormones that regulate inflammation, growth, metabolism, and apoptosis via their cognate receptor, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). GR, acting mainly as a transcription factor, activates or represses the expression of a large number of target genes, among them, many genes of anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory molecules, respectively. Transrepression activity of glucocorticoids also accounts for their anti-inflammatory activity, rendering them the most widely prescribed drug in medicine. However, chronic and high-dose use of glucocorticoids is accompanied with many undesirable side effects, attributed predominantly to GR transactivation activity. Thus, there is a high need for selective GR agonist, capable of dissociating transrepression from transactivation activity. Protopanaxadiol and protopanaxatriol are triterpenoids that share structural and functional similarities with glucocorticoids. The molecular mechanism of their actions is unclear. In this study applying induced-fit docking analysis, luciferase assay, immunofluorescence, and Western blot analysis, we showed that protopanaxadiol and more effectively protopanaxatriol are capable of binding to GR to activate its nuclear translocation, and to suppress the nuclear factor-kappa beta activity in GR-positive HeLa and HEK293 cells, but not in GR-low level COS-7 cells. Interestingly, no transactivation activity was observed, whereas suppression of the dexamethasone-induced transactivation of GR and induction of apoptosis in HeLa and HepG2 cells were observed. Thus, our results indicate that protopanaxadiol and protopanaxatriol could be considered as potent and selective GR agonist.
The hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis directly controls the stress response. Dysregulation of this neuroendocrine system is a common feature among psychiatric disorders. Steroid hormone receptors, like glucocorticoid receptor (GR), function as transcription factors of a diverse set of genes upon activation. This activity is regulated by molecular chaperone heterocomplexes. Much is known about the structure and function of these GR/heterocomplexes. There is strong evidence suggesting altered regulation of steroid receptor hormones by chaperones, particularly the 51 kDa FK506-binding protein (FKBP51), may work with environmental factors to increase susceptibility to various psychiatric illnesses including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and anxiety. This review highlights the regulation of steroid receptor dynamics by the 90kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90)/cochaperone heterocomplexes with an in depth look at how the structural regulation and imbalances in cochaperones can cause functional effects on GR activity. Links between the stress response and circadian systems and the development of novel chaperone-targeting therapeutics are also discussed.
Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily and upregulates expression of many genes in the liver, pancreas, small intestine, and colon. HNF4α is also highly expressed in proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) in kidney. PTECs reabsorb various substances through transporters, ion channels, and receptors, but the target genes for HNF4α in PTECs have not been investigated in detail. In the present study, we aimed to identify novel HNF4α target genes that are highly expressed in PTECs. Expression of many solute carrier transporter genes was upregulated by HNF4α in human PTEC-derived HK-2 cells. Notably, expression of megalin (LRP2), an endocytic receptor of various molecules involved in development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), was strongly induced by HNF4α, and the transactivation potential of the megalin promoter was dependent on HNF4α expression. Moreover, HNF4α was found to directly bind to an HNF4α binding site near the transcription start site in the megalin gene. These results indicate that HNF4α plays an important role in maintaining reabsorption and metabolism in PTECs by positive regulation of several solute carrier transporter and megalin genes at the transcriptional level.
Breast cancer metastases to the gastrointestinal tract are rare, with a median time interval from the diagnosis of the primary tumor to metastasis up to 7 years. The stomach is the most frequent metastatic site and invasive lobular carcinoma is the type with the highest affinity to the digestive system. We report the case of an 84-year-old female patient, with a past medical history 20 years earlier of invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast, who presented for dyspepsia. Upper endoscopy revealed hypertrophic gastric folds compatible with primary linitis plastica. Histology showed proliferation of malignant poorly cohesive cells. Immunohistochemistry stain showed intense positivity of estrogen receptors and anti-GATA-binding protein 3 nuclear antibodies, and absence of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. These findings confirmed the diagnosis of a metachronous metastasis of the invasive lobular breast adenocarcinoma. Considering metastases from breast cancer is crucial when patients with any subtle gastric symptom and a past medical history of invasive lobular adenocarcinoma of the breast seek medical advice, even though more than 20 years after primary breast cancer. Immunohistochemistry is the key to final diagnosis as these lesions can endoscopically and histologically mimic primary linitis plastica.
There is a critical need to generate functional hepatocytes to aid in liver repair and regeneration upon availability of a renewable, and potentially personalized, source of human hepatocytes (hHEP). Currently, the vast majority of primary hHEP are obtained from human tissue through cadavers. Recent advances in stem cell differentiation have opened up the possibility to obtain fully functional hepatocytes from embryonic or induced pluripotent stem cells, or adult stem cells. With respect to the latter, human bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (hBMSCs) can serve as a source of autogenetic and allogenic multipotent stem cells for liver repair and regeneration. A major aspect of hBMSC differentiation is the extracellular matrix (ECM) composition and, in particular, the role of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the differentiation process. In this study, we examine the influence of four distinct culture conditions/protocols (T1-T4) on GAG composition and hepatic markers. α-Fetoprotein and hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α were expressed continually over 21 days of differentiation, as indicated by real time quantitative PCR analysis, while albumin (ALB) expression did not begin until day 21. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) appears to be more effective than activin A in promoting hepatic-like cells through the mesenchymal-epithelial transition, perhaps due to the former binding to the HGF receptor to form a unique complex that diversifies the biological functions of HGF. Of the four protocols tested, uniform hepatocyte-like morphological changes, ALB secretion, and glycogen storage were found to be highest with protocol T2, which involves both early- and late-stage combinations of growth factors. The total GAG profile of the hBMSC ECM is rich in heparan sulfate (HS) and hyaluronan, both of which fluctuate during differentiation. The GAG profile of primary hHEP showed an HS-rich ECM, and thus, it may be possible to guide hBMSC differentiation to more mature hepatocytes by controlling the GAG profile expressed by differentiating cells.
Forkhead box A1 (FOXA1) belongs to the forkhead class transcription factor family, playing pioneering function for hormone receptors in breast and prostate cancers, and mediating activation of linage specific enhancers. Interplay between FOXA1 and breast cancer specific signaling pathways has been reported previously, indicating a regulation network on FOXA1 in breast cancer cells. Here in this study, we aimed to identify which are the proteins that could potentially control FOXA1 function in breast cancer cell lines expressing different molecular markers. We first established a luciferase reporter system reflecting FOXA1 binding to DNA. Then, we applied high throughput chemical screening of multiple protein targets and mass spectrometry in breast cancer cell lines expressing different molecular markers: ER positive/HER2 negative (MCF-7), ER positive/HER2 positive (BT474), and ER negative/HER2 positive (MDA-MB-453). Regardless of estrogen receptor status, HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) enriched cell lines showed similar response to kinase inhibitors, indicating the control of FOXA1 by cell signaling kinases. Among these kinases, we identified additional receptor tyrosine kinases and cyclin-dependent kinases as regulators of FOXA1. Furthermore, we performed proteomics experiments from FOXA1 inmunoprecipitated protein complex to identify that FOXA1 interacts with several proteins. Among all the targets, we identified cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) as a positive factor to interact with FOXA1 in BT474 cell line. In silico analyses confirmed that cyclin-dependent kinases might be the kinases responsible for FOXA1 phosphorylation at the Forkhead domain and the transactivation domain. These results reveal that FOXA1 is potentially regulated by multiple kinases. The cell cycle control kinase CDK1 might control directly FOXA1 by phosphorylation and other kinases indirectly by means of regulating other proteins.
Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) is a major public health concern worldwide. The present study aimed to provide evidence to assist in the development of specific novel biomarkers for PMOP. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between PMOP and normal controls by integrated microarray analyses of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and the optimal diagnostic gene biomarkers for PMOP were identified with LASSO and Boruta algorithms. Classification models, including support vector machine (SVM), decision tree and random forests models, were established to test the diagnostic value of identified gene biomarkers for PMOP. Functional annotations and protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network constructions were also conducted. Integrated microarray analyses (GSE56815, GSE13850 and GSE7429) of the GEO database were employed, and 1,320 DEGs were identified between PMOP and normal controls. An 11‑gene combination was also identified as an optimal biomarker for PMOP by feature selection and classification methods using SVM, decision tree and random forest models. This combination was comprised of the following genes: Dehydrogenase E1 and transketolase domain containing 1 (DHTKD1), osteoclast stimulating factor 1 (OSTF1), G protein‑coupled receptor 116 (GPR116), BCL2 interacting killer, adrenoceptor β1 (ADRB1), neogenin 1 (NEO1), RB binding protein 4 (RBBP4), GPR87, cylicin 2, EF‑hand calcium binding domain 1 and DEAH‑box helicase 35. RBBP4 (degree=12) was revealed to be the hub gene of this PMOP‑specific PPI network. Among these 11 genes, three genes (OSTF1, ADRB1 and NEO1) were speculated to serve roles in PMOP by regulating the balance between bone formation and bone resorption, while two genes (GPR87 and GPR116) may be involved in PMOP by regulating the nuclear factor‑κB signaling pathway. Furthermore, DHTKD1 and RBBP4 may be involved in PMOP by regulating mitochondrial dysfunction and interacting with ESR1, respectively. In conclusion, the findings of the current study provided an insight for exploring the mechanism and developing novel biomarkers for PMOP. Further studies are required to test the diagnostic value for PMOP prior to use in a clinical setting.
Obesity is prevalent in modern society because of a lifestyle consisting of high dietary fat and sucrose consumption combined with little exercise. Among the consequences of obesity are the emerging epidemics of hepatic steatosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) is a transcription factor that stimulates gene expression related to de novo lipogenesis in the liver. In response to a high-fat diet, the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ2, another nuclear receptor, is increased, which leads to the development of NAFLD. β-Conglycinin, a soy protein, prevents NAFLD induced by diets high in sucrose/fructose or fat by decreasing the expression and function of these nuclear receptors. β-Conglycinin also improves NAFLD via the same mechanism as for prevention. Fish oil contains n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. Fish oil is more effective at preventing NAFLD induced by sucrose/fructose because SREBP-1c activity is inhibited. However, the effect of fish oil on NAFLD induced by fat is controversial because fish oil further increases PPARγ2 expression, depending upon the experimental conditions. Alcohol intake also causes an alcoholic fatty liver, which is induced by increased SREBP-1c and PPARγ2 expression and decreased PPARα expression. β-Conglycinin and fish oil are effective at preventing alcoholic fatty liver because β-conglycinin decreases the function of SREBP-1c and PPARγ2, and fish oil decreases the function of SREBP-1c and increases that of PPARα.
Dioxins are highly toxic and persistent halogenated organic pollutants belonging to two families i.e., Polychlorinated Dibenzo-p-Dioxins (PCDDs) and Polychlorinated Dibenzo Furans (PCDFs). They can cause cancer, reproductive and developmental issues, damage to the immune system, and can deeply interfere with the endocrine system. Dioxins toxicity is mediated by the Aryl-hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) which mediates the cellular metabolic adaptation to these planar aromatic xenobiotics through the classical transcriptional regulation pathway, including AhR binding of ligand in the cytosol, translocation of the receptor to the nucleus, dimerization with the AhR nuclear translocator, and the binding of this heterodimeric transcription factor to dioxin-responsive elements which regulate the expression of genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism. 2,3,7,8-TCDD is the most toxic among dioxins showing the highest affinity toward the AhR receptor. Beside this classical and well-studied pathway, a number of papers are dealing with the role of epigenetic mechanisms in the response to environmental xenobiotics. In this review, we report on the potential role of epigenetic mechanisms in dioxins-induced cellular response by inspecting recent literature and focusing our attention on epigenetic mechanisms induced by the most toxic 2,3,7,8-TCDD.
Overexpression of chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) has been found to be associated with increased cell proliferation, metastasis and also act as an indicator of poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer. Therefore, new agents that can abrogate CXCR4 expression have potential against breast cancer metastasis. In this study, we examined the potential effect of thymoquinone (TQ), derived from the seeds of Nigella sativa, on the expression and regulation of CXCR4 in breast cancer cells. TQ was found to inhibit the expression of CXCR4 in MDA-MB-231 triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. It was noted that suppression of CXCR4 by TQ was possibly transcriptionally regulated, as treatment with this drug caused down-regulation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) activation and suppression of NF-κB binding to the CXCR4 promoter. Pretreatment with a proteasome inhibitor and/or lysosomal stabilization did not affect TQ induced suppression of CXCR4. Down-regulation of CXCR4 was further correlated with the inhibition of CXCL12-mediated migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells. Interestingly, it was observed that the deletion of p65 could reverse the observed anti-invasive/anti-migratory effects of TQ in breast cancer cells. TQ also dose-dependently inhibited MDA-MB-231 tumor growth and tumor vascularity in a chick chorioallantoic membrane assay model. We also observed TQ (2 and 4 mg/kg) treatment significantly suppressed multiple lung, brain, and bone metastases in a dose-dependent manner in a metastasis breast cancer mouse model. Interestingly, H&amp;E and immunohistochemical analysis of bone isolated from TQ treated mice indicated a reduction in number of osteolytic lesions and the expression of metastatic biomarkers. In conclusion, the results indicate that TQ primarily exerts its anti-metastatic effects by down-regulation of NF-κB regulated CXCR4 expression and thus has potential for the treatment of breast cancer.
White adipose tissue (WAT) have a relevant metabolic and inflammatory function, in overweight or obesity conditions. In this regard, the WAT under over feeding nutrition present a significant increment in oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory status and depletion of n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid. Hydroxytyrosol (HT) is a polyphenol with important cytoprotective effects, and this molecule can modulate the gene expression, transcription factors and enzymatic activity.
Therefore, the purpose of this study was evaluate the anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-lipogenic effects of HT supplementation mice and the molecular adaptations involved, on dysfunctional WAT from high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice.
Male C57BL/6 J mice received (i) control diet (10% fat); (ii) control diet + HT (daily doses of 5 mg kg body weight), (iii) HFD (60% fat); or (iv) HFD + HT for 12 weeks. HFD-fed mice exhibited: (i) WAT hypertrophy; (ii) oxidative stress and depletion of antioxidant defenses, (iii) increased lipogenesis and pro-inflammatory status, (iv) depletion of n-3 LCPUFA and (v) up-regulation of NF-κB and SREBP 1c with down-regulation Nrf2, and PPAR-γ. HT supplementation attenuated the metabolic impairment produced by HFD in WAT, attenuating increment of NF-κB and SREBP 1c, and increasing the activity of Nrf2 and PPAR-γ.
Supplementation with HT improve the WAT dysfunction induced by HDF in mice through the modulation of transcription factors NF-κB, Nrf2, SREBP-1c and PPAR-γ as well as their target genes, involved in inflammation, antioxidant defenses and lipogenesis.
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a serious threat for reproductive-aged women. Metformin has been used for the treatment of PCOS. However, its molecular mechanism in decidualization process of PCOS has not been well featured.
RT-qPCR analysis was used to detect expression patterns of progesterone receptor (PGR), estradiol receptor alpha (ERα), Cytokeratin 8 and Vimentin in endometrial tissues of PCOS and non-PCOS patients. RT-qPCR assay was also employed to determine mRNA expression of prolactin, Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9). Cytokine secretion were measured by matching ELISA kits. Protein expression of p-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, p-p38 MAPK, p38 MAPK, and PGR (PGRA and PGRB) was tested by western blot assay.
PGR expression was upregulated in PCOS patients. Metformin alleviated estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) (EP)-induced decidualization of endometrial stromal cells. Abnormal cytokine secretion was observed in EP-stimulated endometrial stromal cells in the absence or presence of metfromin. Metformin suppressed EP-induced MMP-2 and MMP-9 upregulation. Metformin alleviated EP-triggered p38 MAPK inactivation and PGR (PGRA and PGRB) expression. Metfromin had no effect on ERK1/2 signaling in EP-stimulated endometrial stromal cells.
Metformin alleviated EP-induced decidualization of endometrial stromal cells by modulating secretion of multiple cytokines, inhibiting expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9, activating p38-MAPK signaling and reducing PGR expression, providing a deep insight into the molecular basis of metfromin therapy for PCOS patients.
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading contributor to the global burden of disease. However, the causal relationship of risk factors, such as genetic predisposition or experience of augmented stress, remain unknown. Numerous studies in humans and rodents have implicated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in MDD pathology, as a genetic risk factor and a factor regulated by stress. Until now, the majority of preclinical studies have employed genetically modified mice as their model of choice. However, mice display a limited behavioural repertoire and lack expression of circulating BDNF, which is present in rats and humans. Therefore, heterozygous BDNF (BDNF+/- ) rats were tested for affective behaviours and accompanying expression of key genes associated with affective disorders in the brain. We found that BDNF+/- rats, which have reduced BDNF levels in brain and plasma, displayed symptoms of anhedonia, a core symptom of MDD, and anxiety-like behaviour, but no behavioural despair or cognitive impairments. This was accompanied by changes in the expression of genes that are implicated in modulation of the stress response and affective disorders. Hence, glucocorticoid receptor, neuregulin 1 and disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 gene expression were upregulated in the prefrontal cortex of BDFN+/- rats, whereas FK506 binding protein 5 levels were decreased in the hippocampus. We conclude that a reduction in BDNF levels alters expression of genes associated with affective disorders, which may contribute to the development of depressive-like symptoms.
The uncarboxylated form of osteocalcin (GluOC) regulates glucose and lipid metabolism in mice. We previously showed that low-dose (≤10 ng/ml) GluOC induces the expression of adiponectin and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) via a cAMP-PKA-ERK-CREB signaling pathway in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We also noticed that high-dose (≥20 ng/ml) GluOC inhibits the expression of adiponectin and PPARγ in these cells. We have here explored the mechanism underlying these effects of high-dose GluOC. High-dose GluOC triggered morphological changes in 3T3-L1 adipocytes suggestive of the induction of cell death. It activated the putative GluOC receptor GPRC6A and thereby induced the production of cAMP and activation of protein kinase A (PKA), similar to signaling by low-dose GluOC with the exception that the catalytic subunit of PKA also entered the nucleus. Cytosolic PKA induced phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) at serine-133 via extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Nuclear PKA appeared to mediate the inhibitory phosphorylation of salt-inducible kinase 2 (SIK2) at serine-358 and thereby to alleviate the inhibitory phosphorylation of the CREB co-activator p300 at serine-89. The activation of CREB and p300 resulted in increased expression of the transcription factor FoxO1 and consequent upregulation of Fas ligand (FasL) at the plasma membrane. The interaction of FasL with Fas on neighboring adipocytes triggered the phosphorylation at threonine-357/serine-358 and homotrimerization of mixed-lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL), a key regulator of necroptosis, as well as Ca2+ influx via transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7), the generation of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxides, and dephosphorylation of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) at serine-637, resulting in mitochondrial fragmentation. Together, our results indicate that high-dose GluOC triggers necroptosis through upregulation of FasL at the plasma membrane in a manner dependent of activation of CREB-p300, followed by the activation of Fas signaling in neighboring adipocytes.
The nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family of transcription factors, which includes NFAT1, NFAT2, and NFAT4, are well-known to play important roles in T cell activation. Most of NFAT proteins are controlled by calcium influx upon T cell receptor and costimulatory signaling results increase of IL-2 and IL-2 receptor. NFAT3 however is not shown to be expressed in T cells and NFAT5 has not much highlighted in T cell functions yet. Recent studies demonstrate that the NFAT family proteins involve in function of lineage-specific transcription factors during differentiation of T helper 1 (Th1), Th2, Th17, regulatory T (Treg), and follicular helper T cells (Tfh). They have been studied to make physical interaction with the other transcription factors like GATA3 or Foxp3 and they also regulate Th cell signature gene expressions by direct binding on promotor region of target genes. From last decades, NFAT functions in T cells have been targeted to develop immune modulatory drugs for controlling T cell immunity in autoimmune diseases like cyclosporine A, FK506, etc. Due to their undesirable side defects, only limited application is available in human diseases. This review focuses on the recent advances in development of NFAT targeting drug as well as our understanding of each NFAT family protein in T cell biology. We also discuss updated detail molecular mechanism of NFAT functions in T cells, which would lead us to suggest an idea for developing specific NFAT inhibitors as a therapeutic drug for autoimmune diseases.
Bladder cancer is a malignant tumor in the urinary system with high mortality and recurrence rates. However, the causes and recurrence mechanism of bladder cancer are not fully understood. In this study, we used integrated bioinformatics to screen for key genes associated with the development of bladder cancer and reveal their potential molecular mechanisms.
The GSE7476, GSE13507, GSE37815 and GSE65635 expression profiles were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, and these datasets contain 304 tissue samples, including 81 normal bladder tissue samples and 223 bladder cancer samples. The RobustRankAggreg (RRA) method was utilized to integrate and analyze the four datasets to obtain integrated differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and the gene ontology (GO) functional annotation and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were performed. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and module analyses were performed using Cytoscape software. The OncoLnc online tool was utilized to analyze the relationship between the expression of hub genes and the prognosis of bladder cancer.
In total, 343 DEGs, including 111 upregulated and 232 downregulated genes, were identified from the four datasets. GO analysis showed that the upregulated genes were mainly involved in mitotic nuclear division, the spindle and protein binding. The downregulated genes were mainly involved in cell adhesion, extracellular exosomes and calcium ion binding. The top five enriched pathways obtained in the KEGG pathway analysis were focal adhesion (FA), PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, proteoglycans in cancer, extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction and vascular smooth muscle contraction. The top 10 hub genes identified from the PPI network were vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), TOP2A, CCNB1, Cell division cycle 20 (CDC20), aurora kinase B, ACTA2, Aurora kinase A, UBE2C, CEP55 and CCNB2. Survival analysis revealed that the expression levels of ACTA2, CCNB1, CDC20 and VEGFA were related to the prognosis of patients with bladder cancer. In addition, a KEGG pathway analysis of the top 2 modules identified from the PPI network revealed that Module 1 mainly involved the cell cycle and oocyte meiosis, while the analysis in Module 2 mainly involved the complement and coagulation cascades, vascular smooth muscle contraction and FA.
This study identified key genes and pathways in bladder cancer, which will improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the development and progression of bladder cancer. These key genes might be potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers for the treatment of bladder cancer.
Ischemic stroke often induces excessive neuronal autophagy, resulting in brain damage; meanwhile, inflammatory responses stimulated by ischemia exacerbate neural injury. However, interactions between neuronal autophagy and microglial inflammation following ischemic stroke are poorly understood. CX3CL1/fractalkine, a membrane-bound chemokine expressed on neurons, can suppress microglial inflammation by binding to its receptor CX3CR1 on microglia. In the present study, to investigate whether autophagy could alter CX3CL1 expression on neurons and consequently change microglial inflammatory activity, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was established in Sprague-Dawley rats to model ischemic stroke, and tissues from the ischemic penumbra were obtained to evaluate autophagy level and microglial inflammatory activity. MCAO rats were administered 3-methyladenine (autophagy inhibitor) or Tat-Beclin 1 (autophagy inducer). Western blot assays were conducted to quantify expression of Beclin-1, nuclear factor kappa B p65 (NF-κB), light chain 3B (LC3B), and CX3CL1 in ischemic penumbra. Moreover, immunofluorescence staining was performed to quantify numbers of LC3B-, CX3CL1-, and Iba-1-positive cells in ischemic penumbra. In addition, enzyme linked immunosorbent assays were utilized to analyze concentrations of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). A dry/wet weight method was used to detect brain water content, while 2,3,5,-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining was utilized to measure infarct volume. The results demonstrated that autophagy signaling (Beclin-1 and LC3B expression) in penumbra was prominently activated by MCAO, while CX3CL1 expression on autophagic neurons was significantly reduced and microglial inflammation was markedly activated. However, after inhibition of autophagy signaling with 3-methyladenine, CX3CL1 expression on neurons was obviously increased, whereas Iba-1 and NF-κB expression was downregulated; TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and PGE2 levels were decreased; and cerebral edema was obviously mitigated. In contrast, after treatment with the autophagy inducer Tat-Beclin 1, CX3CL1 expression on neurons was further reduced; Iba-1 and NF-κB expression was increased; TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and PGE2 levels were enhanced; and cerebral edema was aggravated. Our study suggests that ischemia-induced neuronal autophagy facilitates microglial inflammatory injury after ischemic stroke, and the efficacy of this process may be associated with downregulated CX3CL1 expression on autophagic neurons.
Virus-induced signaling adaptor (VISA), which mediates the production of type I interferon, is crucial for the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptor (RLR) signaling pathway. Upon viral infection, RIG-I recognizes double-stranded viral RNA and interacts with VISA to mediate antiviral innate immunity. However, the mechanisms underlying RIG/VISA-mediated antiviral regulation remain unclear. In this study, we confirmed that receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) interacts with VISA and attenuates the RIG/VISA-mediated antiviral innate immune signaling pathway. Overexpression of RACK1 inhibited the interferon-β (IFN-β) promoter; interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE); nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation; and dimerization of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) mediated by RIG-I, VISA, and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). A reduction in RACK1 expression level upon small interfering RNA knockdown increased RIG/VISA-mediated antiviral transduction. Additionally, RACK1 disrupted formation of the VISA-tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), VISA-TRAF3, and VISA-TRAF6 complexes during RIG-I/VISA-mediated signal transduction. Additionally, RACK1 enhanced K48-linked ubiquitination of VISA, attenuated its K63-linked ubiquitination, and decreased VISA-mediated antiviral signal transduction. Together, these results indicate that RACK1 interacts with VISA to repress downstream signaling and downregulates virus-induced IFN-β production in the RIG-I/VISA signaling pathway.
Autophagy is important for hepatic homeostasis, nutrient regeneration, and organelle quality control. We investigated the mechanisms by which liver injury occurred in the absence of autophagy function. We found that mice deficient in autophagy because of the lack of autophagy-related gene 7 or autophagy-related gene 5, key autophagy-related genes, manifested intracellular cholestasis with increased levels of serum bile acids, a higher ratio of tauromuricholic acid/taurocholic acid in the bile, increased hepatic bile acid load, abnormal bile canaliculi, and altered expression of hepatic transporters. In determining the underlying mechanism, we found that autophagy sustained and promoted the basal and up-regulated expression of farnesoid X receptor (Fxr) in the fed and starved conditions, respectively. Consequently, expression of Fxr and its downstream genes, particularly bile salt export pump, and the binding of FXR to the promoter regions of these genes, were suppressed in autophagy-deficient livers. In addition, codeletion of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in autophagy deficiency status reversed the FXR suppression. Furthermore, the cholestatic injury of autophagy-deficient livers was reversed by enhancement of FXR activity or expression, or by Nrf2 deletion. Conclusion: Together with earlier reports that FXR can suppress autophagy, our findings indicate that autophagy and FXR form a regulatory loop and deficiency of autophagy causes abnormal FXR functionality, leading to the development of intracellular cholestasis and liver injury.
Progesterone Receptor Membrane Component 1 (PGRMC1) interacts with PGRMC2 and disrupting this interaction in spontaneously immortalized granulosa cells (SIGCS) leads to an inappropriate entry into the cell cycle, mitotic arrest and ultimately cell death. The present study revealed that PGRMC1 and PGRMC2 localize to the cytoplasm of murine granulosa cells of non-atretric follicles with their staining intensity being somewhat diminished in granulosa cells of atretic follicles. Compared to controls (Pgrmc1fl/fl), the rate at which granulosa cells entered the cell cycle increased in non-atretic and atretic follicles of mice in which Pgrmc1 was conditionally deleted (Pgrmc1d/d) from granulosa cells. This increased rate of entry into the cell cycle was associated with a ≥ 2 fold increase in follicular atresia and the nuclear localization of Nuclear Factor-Kappa-B Transcription Factor P65; (NFΚB/p65, or RELA). GTPase Activating Protein Binding Protein 2 (G3BP2) binds NFΚB/p65 through an interaction with NFΚB Inhibitor Alpha (IκBα), thereby maintaining NFΚB/p65's cytoplasmic localization and restricting its transcriptional activity. Since PGRMC1 and PGRMC2 bind G3BP2, studies were designed to assess the functional relationship between PGRMC1, PGRMC2 and NFΚB/p65 in SIGCs. In these studies, disrupting the interaction between PGRMC1 and PGRMC2 increased the nuclear localization of NFΚB/p65, and depleting PGRMC1, PGRMC2 or G3BP2 increased NFΚB transcriptional activity and the progression into the cell cycle. Taken together, these studies suggest that PGRMC1 and 2 regulate granulosa cell cycle entry in follicles by precisely controlling the localization and thereby the transcriptional activity of NFΚB/p65.
Recent studies reported that cAMP-binding protein Epac1-deficient mice were protected against various forms of cardiac stress, suggesting that pharmacological inhibition of Epac1 could be beneficial for the treatment of cardiac diseases. To test this assumption, we characterized an Epac1-selective inhibitory compound and investigated its potential cardioprotective properties.
We used the Epac1-BRET (bioluminescence resonance energy transfer) for searching for non-cyclic nucleotide Epac1 modulators. A thieno[2.3-b]pyridine derivative, designated as AM-001 was identified as a non-competitive inhibitor of Epac1. AM-001 has no antagonist effect on Epac2 or protein kinase A (PKA) activity. This small molecule prevents the activation of the Epac1 downstream effector Rap1 in cultured cells, in response to the Epac1 preferential agonist, 8-CPT-AM. In addition, we found that AM-001 inhibited Epac1-dependent deleterious effects such as cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and death. Importantly, AM-001-mediated inhibition of Epac1 reduces infarct size after mouse myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Finally, AM-001 attenuates cardiac hypertrophy, inflammation and fibrosis, and improves cardiac function during chronic β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) activation with isoprenaline (ISO) in mice. At the molecular level, ISO increased Epac1-G protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5) interaction and induced GRK5 nuclear import and histone deacetylase type 5 (HDAC5) nuclear export to promote the activity of the prohypertrophic transcription factor, myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2). Inversely, AM-001 prevented the non-canonical action of GRK5 on HDAC5 cytoplasmic shuttle to downregulate MEF2 transcriptional activity.
Our study represents a "proof-of-concept" for the therapeutic effectiveness of inhibiting Epac1 activity in cardiac disease using small-molecule pharmacotherapy.
Capsazepine is a synthetic analogue of capsaicin that can function as an antagonist of TRPV1. Capsazepine can exhibit diverse effects on cancer (prostate cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, oral cancer, and osteosarcoma) growth and survival, and can be therapeutically used against other major disorders such as colitis, pancreatitis, malaria, and epilepsy. Capsazepine has been reported to exhibit pleiotropic anti-cancer effects against numerous tumor cell lines. Capsazepine can modulate Janus activated kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of the transcription (STAT) pathway, intracellular Ca2+ concentration, and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-JNK-CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) pathways. It can inhibit cell proliferation, metastasis, and induce apoptosis. Moreover, capsazepine can exert anti-inflammatory effects through the downregulation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nuclear transcription factor-kappa B (NF-κB), as well as the blockage of activation of both transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) and transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily A, and member 1 (TRPA1). This review briefly summarizes the diverse pharmacological actions of capsazepine against various cancers and inflammatory conditions.
Building brain reserves before dementia onset could represent a promising strategy to prevent Alzheimer's disease (AD), while how to initiate early cognitive stimulation is unclear. Given that the immature brain is more sensitive to environmental stimuli and that brain dynamics decrease with ageing, we reasoned that it would be effective to initiate cognitive stimulation against AD as early as the fetal period.
After conception, maternal AD transgenic mice (3 × Tg AD) were exposed to gestational environment enrichment (GEE) until the day of delivery. The cognitive capacity of the offspring was assessed by the Morris water maze and contextual fear-conditioning tests when the offspring were raised in a standard environment to 7 months of age. Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR, immunoprecipitation, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, electrophysiology, Golgi staining, activity assays and sandwich ELISA were employed to gain insight into the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of GEE on embryos and 7-10-month-old adult offspring.
We found that GEE markedly preserved synaptic plasticity and memory capacity with amelioration of hallmark pathologies in 7-10-m-old AD offspring. The beneficial effects of GEE were accompanied by global histone hyperacetylation, including those at bdnf promoter-binding regions, with robust BDNF mRNA and protein expression in both embryo and progeny hippocampus. GEE increased insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and activated its receptor (IGF1R), which phosphorylates Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase IV (CaMKIV) at tyrosine sites and triggers its nuclear translocation, subsequently upregulating histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and BDNF transcription. The upregulation of IGF1 mimicked the effects of GEE, while IGF1R or HAT inhibition during pregnancy abolished the GEE-induced CaMKIV-dependent histone hyperacetylation and BDNF upregulation.
These findings suggest that activation of IGF1R/CaMKIV/HAT/BDNF signaling by gestational environment enrichment may serve as a promising strategy to delay AD progression.
Chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor I (COUP-TFI) is an orphan receptor and member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Among a series of methylene substituted diindolylmethanes (C-DIMs) containing substituted phenyl and heteroaromatic groups, we identified 1,1-bis(3'-indolyl)-1-(4-pyridyl)-methane (DIM-C-Pyr-4) as an activator of COUP-TFI. Structure activity studies with structurally diverse heteroaromatic C-DIMs showed that the pyridyl substituted compound was active and the 4-pyridyl substituent was more potent than the 2- or 3-pyridyl analogs in transactivation assays in breast cancer cells. The DIM-C-Pyr-4 activated chimeric GAL4-COUP-TFI constructs containing full length, C- or N-terminal deletions, and transactivation was inhibited by phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and protein kinase A inhibitors. However, DIM-C-Pyr-4 also induced transactivation and interactions of COUP-TFI and steroid receptor coactivators-1 and -2 in mammalian two-hybrid assays, and ligand-induced interactions of the C-terminal region of COUP-TFI were not affected by kinase inhibitors. We also showed that DIM-C-Pyr-4 activated COUP-TFI-dependent early growth response 1 (Egr-1) expression and this response primarily involved COUP-TFI interactions with Sp3 and to a lesser extent Sp1 bound to the proximal region of the Egr-1 promoter. Modeling studies showed interactions of DIM-C-Pyr-4 within the ligand binding domain of COUP-TFI. This report is the first to identify a COUP-TFI agonist and demonstrate activation of COUP-TFI-dependent Egr-1 expression.
Protease-activated receptors (PARs) evolved to react to extracellular proteolytic activity. In mammals, three of the four PARs (PAR1, PAR3, and PAR4) that are expressed respond to the prototypical procoagulant enzyme thrombin, whereas PAR2 was assumed to resist activation by thrombin. To date, involvement of cell surface thrombin-recruiting co-receptors such as thrombomodulin (TM), which potentially facilitates PAR2 cleavage, has not been addressed. Thus, we examined whether TM-bound thrombin cleaved PAR2 and tested biological responses such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) DNA binding activity and cytokine release.
We examined 293T cells overexpressing PAR2 and TM for thrombin recruitment by TM promoting PAR2 cleavage. To test for the TM-thrombin interactions required for PAR2 cleavage and to map cleavage sites on PAR2, mutant constructs of TM or PAR2 were engineered. Biological effects because of PAR2 activation were investigated using an NF-κB reporter system and cytokine release.
We identified that, at low to moderate concentrations, thrombin cleaved PAR2 in a TM co-receptor-dependent manner with cleavage efficiency comparable to that of trypsin. In TM's presence, thrombin efficiently cleaved both, PAR1 and PAR2, albeit kinetics differed. Whereas the majority of surface expressed PAR1 was immediately cleaved off, prolonged exposure to thrombin resulted in few additional cleavage. In contrast, PAR2 cleavage was sustained upon prolonged exposure to thrombin. However, TM EGF-like domain 5 was required and TM chondroitin sulfate (CS) proteoglycan sites serine 490 and serine 492 assisted in PAR2 cleavage, while thrombin preferentially cleaved at arginine 36 on PAR2's N-terminus. Note that thrombin-induced activation of NF-κB via PAR2 resulted in release of interleukin-8. Thus, we provide a novel concept of how thrombin efficiently cleaves PAR2 in a TM-dependent manner, resulting in pro-inflammatory interleukin-8 release. This unexpected pro-inflammatory role of TM, promoting cleavage and activation of PAR2 by thrombin, may lead to novel therapeutic options for treating inflammatory and malignant diseases.
Hemophilia B is a classical monogenic X-chromosomal recessively transmitted bleeding disorder caused by genetic variants within the coagulation factor IX gene. Although hemophilia B has been described in dogs, it has not yet been reported in the Hovawart. Here we describe the identification of a Hovawart family transmitting typical signs of an X-linked bleeding disorder. Five males were reported to suffer from recurrent hemorrhagic episodes. A blood sample of one of these males with only 2% of the normal concentration of plasma factor IX together with samples of seven relatives were provided. Next generation sequencing of the mother and grandmother revealed a single nucleotide deletion in the F9 promoter. Genotyping of the deletion in 1,298 dog specimens including 720 Hovawarts revealed that the mutant allele was only present in the aforementioned Hovawart family. The deletion is located 73 bp upstream of the F9 start codon in the conserved overlapping DNA binding sites of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α and androgen receptor. The deletion only abolished binding of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α, while androgen receptor binding was unaffected as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using human hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α and androgen receptor with double-stranded DNA probes encompassing the mutant promoter region. Luciferase reporter assays using wild type and mutated promoter fragment constructs transfected into Hep G2 cells showed a significant reduction in expression from the mutant promoter. The data provide evidence that the deletion in the Hovawart family caused a rare type of hemophilia B resembling human hemophilia B Leyden.
Liraglutide is a GLP-1 analog (glucagon like peptide-1) used primarily in the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) and obesity. The literature starts to suggest that liraglutide may reduce the effects of ischemic stroke by activating anti-apoptotic pathways, as well as limiting the harmful effects of free radicals. The GLP-1R expression has been reported in the cerebral cortex, especially occipital and frontal lobes, the hypothalamus, and the thalamus. Liraglutide reduced the area of ischemia caused by MCAO (middle cerebral artery occlusion), limited neurological deficits, decreased hyperglycemia caused by stress, and presented anti-apoptotic effects by increasing the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl proteins and reduction of Bax and Bad protein expression. The pharmaceutical managed to decrease concentrations of proapoptotic factors, such as NF-κB (Nuclear Factor-kappa β), ICAM-1 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1), caspase-3, and reduced the level of TUNEL-positive cells. Liraglutide was able to reduce the level of free radicals by decreasing the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), and increasing the superoxide dismutase level (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and catalase. Liraglutide may affect the neurovascular unit causing its remodeling, which seems to be crucial for recovery after stroke. Liraglutide may stabilize atherosclerotic plaque, as well as counteract its early formation and further development. Liraglutide, through its binding to GLP-1R (glucagon like peptide-1 receptor) and consequent activation of PI3K/MAPK (Phosphoinositide 3-kinase/mitogen associated protein kinase) dependent pathways, may have a positive impact on Aβ (amyloid beta) trafficking and clearance by increasing the presence of Aβ transporters in cerebrospinal fluid. Liraglutide seems to affect tau pathology. It is possible that liraglutide may have some stem cell stimulating properties. The effects may be connected with PKA (phosphorylase kinase A) activation. This paper presents potential mechanisms of liraglutide activity in conditions connected with neuronal damage, with special emphasis on Alzheimer's disease and cerebral ischemia.
At low temperatures, the liver increases glucose utilization and expresses RNA-binding motif 3 (RBM3) to cope with cold exposure. In this study, the expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), bone marrow differentiation factor 88 (MYD88), and phosphorylated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) was consistent with fluctuations in insulin in fasted cold-exposed mice. We also found up-regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) in acute cold exposure with a decrease in core body temperature. RBM3 transcription and translation were activated 2 h after cold exposure. The anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2/Bax ratio also increased, while expression of apoptosis factors: cleaved caspase-3, cleaved poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase 1 (PARP-1) and cytochrome-c (Cyt-c) was unchanged. Liver glycogen was depleted after 2 h of cold exposure, and blood glucose decreased after 4 h. Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) phosphorylation continued to increase to promote hepatic glycogen synthesis. We found a high level of protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation after 6 h of cold exposure. In addition, we demonstrated that after cold exposure for 2 h, in the liver, continued phosphorylation of fructose-2,6-diphosphate (PFKFB2) and decreased accumulation of glycogen intermediates fructose-1,6-diphosphate (FDP) and pyruvic acid (PA). In summary, the liver responds to cold exposure through a number of different pathways, including activation of HSP70/TLR4 signaling pathways, up-regulation of RBM3 expression, and increased glycolysis and glycogen synthesis. We propose a possible signaling pathway in which regulation of RBM3 expression by the liver affects the AKT metabolic signaling pathway. Lay summary In response to changes in ambient temperature, mice regulate global metabolism and gene expression through hormones. This study focused on the effects of environmental hypothermia on molecular pathways of glucose metabolism in the liver, which is the important metabolic organ in mice. This provides a basis for further study of mice against cold exposure damage.
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are postulated to play significant role in the pathogenesis, progression as well as drug resistance of breast cancer. Nucleostemin (NS) is thought to be a key molecule for stemness, and the clinical impact of NS immunoreactivity in breast cancer can indicate its actual role and future therapeutic potentials.The current study is an observational study with an attempt to evaluate the correlation between NS expression (protein and gene expression levels) and different clinicopathological attributes of invasive breast cancer. For that reason, we investigated NS immunohistochemistry expression on commercial tissue microarray (TMA) of 102 patients and 51 archival specimens from patients admitted to Saqr Hospital, Ras Al Khaimah and diagnosed in Al Baraha Hospital, Dubai, UAE. In addition, the association between NS (GNL3) gene expression and different prognostic parameters as well as patient outcome was also evaluated using 2 large publicly available databases.Interestingly, we found NS expression to be associated with less differentiated and more advance stage. In addition, NS expression was significantly higher in larger size (P = .001) and LN-positive tumors (P = .007). Notably, NS expression was significantly correlated to P53 positive (P = .037) status. Furthermore, NS was found to be more expressed in the highly aggressive breast cancer subtypes including human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtypes. Moreover, our results also showed that high GNL3 gene expression to be associated with poor patient outcome and higher chances of tumor recurrence.Our results highlight NS expression as a marker of aggressive phenotype and poor outcome and indicate its possible use as a potential target for CSC-associated breast cancer management.
T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CAR T cells) targeting human CD19 (hCD19) have shown clinical efficacy against B cell malignancies1,2. CAR T cells have been less effective against solid tumours3-5, in part because they enter a hyporesponsive ('exhausted' or 'dysfunctional') state6-9 triggered by chronic antigen stimulation and characterized by upregulation of inhibitory receptors and loss of effector function. To investigate the function of CAR T cells in solid tumours, we transferred hCD19-reactive CAR T cells into hCD19+ tumour-bearing mice. CD8+CAR+ tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and CD8+ endogenous tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes expressing the inhibitory receptors PD-1 and TIM3 exhibited similar profiles of gene expression and chromatin accessibility, associated with secondary activation of nuclear receptor transcription factors NR4A1 (also known as NUR77), NR4A2 (NURR1) and NR4A3 (NOR1) by the initiating transcription factor NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells)10-12. CD8+ T cells from humans with cancer or chronic viral infections13-15 expressed high levels of NR4A transcription factors and displayed enrichment of NR4A-binding motifs in accessible chromatin regions. CAR T cells lacking all three NR4A transcription factors (Nr4a triple knockout) promoted tumour regression and prolonged the survival of tumour-bearing mice. Nr4a triple knockout CAR tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes displayed phenotypes and gene expression profiles characteristic of CD8+ effector T cells, and chromatin regions uniquely accessible in Nr4a triple knockout CAR tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes compared to wild type were enriched for binding motifs for NF-κB and AP-1, transcription factors involved in activation of T cells. We identify NR4A transcription factors as having an important role in the cell-intrinsic program of T cell hyporesponsiveness and point to NR4A inhibition as a promising strategy for cancer immunotherapy.
Catalpol, an iridoid glucoside mainly found in the root of Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch, is known to possess various pharmacological effects. Here, we investigated its inhibitory potential against inflammatory responses in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2 microglia. Our results showed that catalpol significantly suppressed LPS-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2. Consistent with these results, catalpol downregulated LPS-stimulated expression of their regulatory enzymes, such as inducible NO synthase and cyclooxygenase-2. Catalpol also inhibited LPS-induced production and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β. Additionally, catalpol suppressed the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway by disrupting the phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitor of κB-α and blocking the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65. Moreover, catalpol inhibited LPS-induced expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and myeloid differentiation factor 88, which was related to suppression of the binding of LPS with TLR4 on the cell surface. Furthermore, catalpol markedly reduced LPS-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Collectively, these results suggest that catalpol can repress LPS-mediated inflammatory action in BV2 microglia through inactivating NF-κB signaling by antagonizing TLR4 and eliminating ROS, indicating that catalpol can have potential benefits by inhibiting the onset and/or treatment of inflammatory diseases.
Hypoxia-inducible factor-2 (HIF-2) is a heterodimeric transcription factor formed through dimerization between an oxygen-sensitive HIF-2α subunit and its obligate partner subunit ARNT. Enhanced HIF-2 activity drives some cancers, whereas reduced activity causes anemia in chronic kidney disease. Therefore, modulation of HIF-2 activity via direct-binding ligands could provide many new therapeutic benefits. Here, we explored HIF-2α chemical ligands using combined crystallographic, biophysical, and cell-based functional studies. We found chemically unrelated antagonists to employ the same mechanism of action. Their binding displaced residue M252 from inside the HIF-2α PAS-B pocket toward the ARNT subunit to weaken heterodimerization. We also identified first-in-class HIF-2α agonists and found that they significantly displaced pocket residue Y281. Its dramatic side chain movement increases heterodimerization stability and transcriptional activity. Our findings show that despite binding to the same HIF-2α PAS-B pocket, ligands can manifest as inhibitors versus activators by mobilizing different pocket residues to allosterically alter HIF-2α-ARNT heterodimerization.
Targeting the "undruggable" proteome remains one of the big challenges in drug discovery. Recent innovations in the field of targeted protein degradation and manipulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system open up new therapeutic approaches for disorders that cannot be targeted with conventional inhibitor paradigms. Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are bivalent ligands in which a compound that binds to the protein target of interest is connected to a second molecule that binds an E3 ligase via a linker. The E3 protein is usually either Cereblon or Von Hippel-Lindau. Several examples of selective PROTAC molecules with potent effect in cells and in vivo models have been reported. The degradation of specific proteins via these bivalent molecules is already allowing for the study of biochemical pathways and cell biology with more specificity than was possible with inhibitor compounds. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent developments in the field of small molecule mediated protein degradation, including transcription factors, kinases and nuclear receptors. We discuss the potential benefits of protein degradation over inhibition as well as the challenges that need to be overcome.
The nucleoli of Dictyostelium discoideum have a comparatively unique, non-canonical, localization adjacent to the inner nuclear membrane. The verified nucleolar proteins of this eukaryotic microbe are detailed while other potential proteins are introduced. Heat shock protein 32 (Hsp32), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 6 (eIF6), and tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1) are essential for cell survival. NumA1, a breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein-C Terminus domain-containing protein linked to cell cycle, functions in the regulation of nuclear number. The cell cycle checkpoint kinase 2 homologue forkhead-associated kinase A (FhkA) and BRG1-associated factor 60a homologue Snf12 are also discussed. While nucleoli appear homogeneous ultrastructurally, evidence for nucleolar subcompartments exists. Nucleolar localization sequences (NoLS) have been defined that target proteins to either the general nucleolar area or to a specific intranucleolar domain. Protein translocations during mitosis are protein-specific and support the multiple functions of the Dictyostelium nucleolus. To enrich the picture, binding partners of NumA1, the most well-characterized nucleolar protein, are examined: nucleolar Ca2+-binding protein 4a (CBP4a), nuclear puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase A (PsaA) and Snf12. The role of Dictyostelium as a model for understanding the contribution of nucleolar proteins to various diseases and cellular stress is discussed throughout the review.
RNA virus invasion induces a cytosolic RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling pathway by promoting assembly of the Mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) signalosome and triggers the rapid production of type I interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines. During this process, the pivotal kinase TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) is recruited to the MAVS signalosome to transduce a robust innate antiviral immune response by phosphorylating transcription factors interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor (NF)-κB and promoting their nuclear translocation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the negative regulation of TBK1 are largely unknown. In the present study, we found that THO complex subunit 7 homolog (THOC7) negatively regulated the cellular antiviral response by promoting the proteasomal degradation of TBK1. THOC7 overexpression potently inhibited Sendai virus- or polyI:C-induced IRF3 dimerization and phosphorylation and IFN-β production. In contrast, THOC7 knockdown had the opposite effects. Moreover, we simulated a node-activated pathway to show that THOC7 regulated the RIG-I-like receptors (RLR)-/MAVS-dependent signaling cascade at the TBK1 level. Furthermore, THOC7 was involved in the MAVS signalosome and promoted TBK1 degradation by increasing its K48 ubiquitin-associated polyubiquitination. Together, these findings suggest that THOC7 negatively regulates type I IFN production by promoting TBK1 proteasomal degradation, thus improving our understanding of innate antiviral immune responses.
Imaging agents and drug carriers are commonly targeted toward cancer cell through functionalization with specific recognition molecules. Quantum dots (QDs) are fluorescent semiconductor nanocrystals whose extraordinary brightness and photostability make them attractive for direct fluorescent labeling of biomolecules or optical encoding of the membranes and cells. Here, we analyse the cytotoxicity of QD-encoded microcapsules, validate an approach to the activation of the microcapsule's surface for further functionalization with monoclonal antibody Trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the extracellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and already in clinical use for the treatment of HER2 positive breast cancer. In addition, we characterize the cell-specific targeting activity of the resultant bio-conjugate by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and real-time analysis of interaction of the conjugates with live HER2 overexpressing human breast cancer cells. We demonstrate, that encapsulation of QDs into the polymer shell using the layer-by-layer deposition method yields highly fluorescent polyelectrolyte microcapsules with a homogeneous size distribution and biocompatibility upon in vitro treatment of cancer cells. Carbodiimide surface activation ensures optimal disperse and optical characteristics of the QD-encoded microcapsules before antibody conjugation. The prepared conjugates of the microcapsules with cancer-specific monoclonal antibody targeting HER2 provide sufficiently sensitive and specific antibody-mediated binding of the microcapsules with live cancer cells, which demonstrated their potential as prospective cancer cell-targeting agents.
Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 17 is an autosomal dominant ataxia caused by expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the TATA-box binding protein (TBP). Substantial studies have shown involvement of compromised mitochondria biogenesis regulator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), nuclear factor-Y subunit A (NFYA), and their downstream target genes in the pathogenesis of polyQ-expansion diseases. The extracts of Paeonia lactiflora (P. lactiflora) and Glycyrrhiza uralensis (G. uralensis) have long been used as a Chinese herbal medicine (CHM). Shaoyao Gancao Tang (SG-Tang) is a formulated CHM made of P. lactiflora and G. uralensis at a 1:1 ratio. In the present study, we demonstrated the aggregate-inhibitory and anti-oxidative effect of SG-Tang in 293 TBP/Q79 cells. We then showed that SG-Tang reduced the aggregates and ameliorated the neurite outgrowth deficits in TBP/Q79 SH-SY5Y cells. SG-Tang upregulated expression levels of NFYA, PGC-1α, NRF2, and their downstream target genes in TBP/Q79 SH-SY5Y cells. Knock down of NFYA, PGC-1α, and NRF2 attenuated the neurite outgrowth promoting effect of SG-Tang on TBP/Q79 SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, SG-Tang inhibited aggregation and rescued motor-deficits in SCA17 mouse model. The study results suggest the potential of SG-Tang in treating SCA17 and probable other polyQ diseases.
The nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD) is an innate pattern recognition receptor that recognizes pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns. The 29-kDa amino-terminal fibronectin fragment (29-kDa FN-f) is a matrix degradation product found in the synovial fluids of patients with osteoarthritis (OA). We investigated whether NOD2 was involved in 29-kDa FN-f-induced pro-catabolic gene expression in human chondrocytes. The expression of mRNA and protein was measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qrt-PCR) and Western blot analysis. Small interfering RNAs were used for knockdown of NOD2 and toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2). An immunoprecipitation assay was performed to examine protein interactions. The NOD2 levels in human OA cartilage were much higher than in normal cartilage. NOD1 and NOD2 expression, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), were upregulated by 29-kDa FN-f in human chondrocytes. NOD2 silencing showed that NOD2 was involved in the 29-kDa FN-f-induced expression of TLR-2. Expressions of IL-6, IL-8, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, -3, and -13 were also suppressed by TLR-2 knockdown. Furthermore, NOD2 and TLR-2 knockdown data demonstrated that both NOD2 and TLR-2 modulated the expressions of their adaptors, receptor-interacting protein 2 (RIP2) and myeloid differentiation 88, in 29-kDa FN-f-treated chondrocytes. 29-kDa FN-f enhanced the interaction of NOD2, RIP2 and transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), an indispensable signaling intermediate in the TLR-2 signaling pathway, and activated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), subsequently leading to increased expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cartilage-degrading enzymes. These results demonstrate that 29-kDa FN-f modulated pro-catabolic responses via cross-regulation of NOD2 and TLR-2 signaling pathways.
Resistance to the anthelmintic macrocyclic lactone ivermectin (IVM) has a great impact on the control of parasitic nematodes. The mechanisms by which nematodes adapt to IVM remain to be deciphered. We have identified NHR-8, a nuclear hormone receptor involved in the xenobiotic response in Caenorhabditis elegans, as a new regulator of tolerance to IVM. Loss-of-function nhr-8(ok186) C. elegans mutants subjected to larval development assays and electropharyngeogram measurements, displayed hypersensitivity to IVM, and silencing of nhr-8 in IVM-resistant worms increased IVM efficacy. In addition, compared to wild-type worms, nhr-8 mutants under IVM selection pressure failed to acquire tolerance to the drug. In addition, IVM-hypersensitive nhr-8(ok186) worms displayed low transcript levels of several genes from the xenobiotic detoxification network and a concomitant low Pgp-mediated drug efflux activity. Interestingly, some pgp and cyp genes known to impact IVM tolerance in many nematode species, were down regulated in nhr-8 mutants and inversely upregulated in IVM-resistant worms. Moreover, pgp-6 overexpression in nhr-8(ok186) C. elegans increased tolerance to IVM. Importantly, NHR-8 function was rescued in nhr-8(ok186) C. elegans with the homolog of the parasitic nematode Haemonchus contortus, and silencing of Hco-nhr-8 by RNAi on L2 H. contortus larvae increased IVM susceptibility in both susceptible and resistant H. contortus isolates. Thus, our data show that NHR-8 controls the tolerance and development of resistance to IVM in C. elegans and the molecular basis for this relates to the NHR-8-mediated upregulation of IVM detoxification genes. Since our results show that Hco-nhr-8 functions similarly to Cel-nhr-8, this study helps to better understand mechanisms underlying failure in drug efficacy and open perspectives in finding new compounds with NHR-8 antagonist activity to potentiate IVM efficacy.
Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) was combined with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify the differential proteomics of grass carp gills after hypoxic stress to better understand the roles of proteins in the hypoxic response and to explore the possible molecular mechanisms. Protein spots were obtained from a hypoxia-stressed group (372 ± 11 individuals) and a control group (406 ± 14 individuals) using the lmage Master 2D Platinum 7.0 analysis software. Fifteen protein spots were expressed differentially in the hypoxia-stressed group and varied significantly after exposure to the hypoxic conditions. In addition, these differential proteins were identified by mass spectrometry and then searched in a database. We found the expression and upregulation of the toll-like receptor 4, ephx1 protein, isocitrate dehydrogenase, L-lactate dehydrogenase, GTP-binding nuclear protein Ran, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; however, the expression of the keratin type II cytoskeletal 8, type I cytokeratin, ARP3 actin-related protein 3 homolog, thyroid hormone receptor alpha-A, ATP synthase subunit beta, citrate synthase, tropomyosin 2, and tropomyosin 3 were downregulated. Six proteins were found in the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) signaling pathway. We concluded that the grass carp gill is involved in response processes, including energy generation, metabolic processes, cellular structure, antioxidation, immunity, and signal transduction, to hypoxic stress. To our knowledge, this is the first study to conduct a proteomics analysis of expressed proteins in the gills of grass carp, and this study will help increase the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in hypoxic stress responses in fish at the protein level.
Bile acids serve a critical role in the induction of gastric intestinal metaplasia (IM) and gastric carcinogenesis. The present study investigated the effects of bile acids on the induction of gastric IM formation. The results demonstrated that the expression levels of caudal‑related homeobox transcription factor 2 (CDX2), mucin 2 (MUC2) and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) were increased in vitro and in vivo following treatment with bile acids, and CDX2 transcriptionally activated MUC2 expression. Furthermore, knockdown of FXR attenuated bile acid‑enhanced CDX2 promoter activity and protein expression. Conversely, the FXR agonist GW4064 synergistically enhanced bile acid‑induced CDX2 promoter activity. Bile acid treatment led to an increase in nuclear factor (NF)‑κB activity and protein expression. Treatment with GW4064 or the FXR antagonist Z‑guggulsterone enhanced or attenuated bile acid‑induced NF‑κB activity, respectively. In addition, quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed that bile acids led to enhanced binding of p50 to the CDX2 promoter, whereas this effect was not observed for p65. Treatment with GW4064 or Z‑guggulsterone enhanced and attenuated the binding activity of p50 to the CDX2 promoter, respectively. These results indicated that bile acids may activate the FXR/NF‑κB signalling pathway, thereby upregulating CDX2 and MUC2 expression in normal gastric epithelial cells.
Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator, is the most widely used endocrine therapy for patients with ER‑positive breast cancer. However, ~30% of tamoxifen‑treated breast cancers do not initially respond to tamoxifen, and neither do they eventually develop tamoxifen resistance. Bcl‑2‑associated athanogene 1 (BAG‑1) is a multifunctional protein that interacts with a wide range of molecules to protect cells from apoptosis otherwise induced by cytotoxic drugs, growth factor withdrawal, radiation and stress. The aim of the present study was to investigate the function of BAG‑1 in tamoxifen resistance. Immunohistochemistry techniques were used to determine BAG‑1 expression in 119 stage I‑III primary breast cancer tissues and it was identified that BAG‑1 was significantly overexpressed in ER‑positive breast cancer (P=0.001). Knockdown of BAG‑1 by short interfering RNA was revealed to downregulate ER, and upregulate phospho (p)‑protein kinase B (Akt) and p‑mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) levels. Furthermore, significantly decreased tamoxifen‑induced apoptosis (41.70±1.93 vs. 55.03±2.39%; P=0.012) was observed in T47D cells following the silencing of BAG‑1. In contrast, overexpression of BAG‑1 long enhanced apoptosis (65.10±2.35 vs. 55.03±2.39%; P=0.039) in T47D cells treated with tamoxifen. Combination treatment of tamoxifen and an mTOR inhibitor restored the inhibitory effects of tamoxifen in T47D cells exhibiting low BAG‑1 expression levels (66.87±2.27 vs. 57.07±2.46%; P=0.037). In conclusion, there results of the present study indicated that suppression of BAG‑1 expression may activate the phosphoinositide 3‑kinase/Akt/mTOR pathway and protect ER‑positive breast cancer cells from tamoxifen‑induced inhibition of proliferation. ER‑positive breast cancer cells exhibiting low BAG‑1 expression appeared to be more sensitive to treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Furthermore, the results indicated that combination treatment targeting ER with tamoxifen and targeting mTOR with rapamycin may significantly potentiate the inhibitory effect in BAG‑1‑silenced cells.
Chronic lead (Pb) exposure has been shown to reduce the expression of some synaptic proteins which are involved in vesicular trafficking and affect presynaptic neurotransmitter release. However, the precise mechanisms by Pb impairs neurotransmitter release are still not well defined. In the current study, we aimed to elucidate the changes of Huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1) in Pb exposed rats and PC12 cells models and its molecular mechanism. Repressor element-1 silencing transcription (REST) modulates the expression of genes containing the repressor element 1 (RE-1) cis-regulatory DNA sequence. HAP1 promoter region contains a RE-1 binding motif. We also observed whether Pb exposure regulated the HAP1 transcription level through influencing the expression of REST. Mother rats were exposed to 0.5 and 2 g/L Pb acetate (PbAc) in drinking water from the first day of gestation until postnatal 21 days, then the offspring rats were continued to drink PbAc for 1 year, while the control groups received drinking water. PC12 cells were divided into 3 groups: 0 μM, 1 μM and 100 μM PbAc. The results revealed that Pb levels in blood and brain of Pb exposed groups were significantly higher than that of the control group. The ability of learning and memory in Pb exposed rats was decreased. Pb exposure reduced the expression of HAP1 and increased the REST expression. Silencing REST could reverse the decreasing of HAP1 in Pb exposed PC12 cells. Our findings raise a possibility that the decreasing of HAP1 expression by Pb exposure may affect neurotransmitter release and results in impairments in spatial learning and memory ability.
Resveratrol is a polyphenolic nutraceutical that exhibits pleiotropic activities in human subjects. The efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of resveratrol have been documented in over 244 clinical trials, with an additional 27 clinical trials currently ongoing. Resveretrol is reported to potentially improve the therapeutic outcome in patients suffering from diabetes mellitus, obesity, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, multiple myeloma, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, cardiovascular diseases, kidney diseases, inflammatory diseases, and rhinopharyngitis. The polyphenol is reported to be safe at doses up to 5 g/d, when used either alone or as a combination therapy. The molecular basis for the pleiotropic activities of resveratrol are based on its ability to modulate multiple cell signaling molecules such as cytokines, caspases, matrix metalloproteinases, Wnt, nuclear factor-κB, Notch, 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase, intercellular adhesion molecule, vascular cell adhesion molecule, sirtuin type 1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α, insulin-like growth factor 1, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3, Ras association domain family 1α, pAkt, vascular endothelial growth factor, cyclooxygenase 2, nuclear factor erythroid 2 like 2, and Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1. Although the clinical utility of resveratrol is well documented, the rapid metabolism and poor bioavailability have limited its therapeutic use. In this regard, the recently produced micronized resveratrol formulation called SRT501, shows promise. This review discusses the currently available clinical data on resveratrol in the prevention, management, and treatment of various diseases and disorders. Based on the current evidence, the potential utility of this molecule in the clinic is discussed.
Periodontal ligament fibroblasts (PDLFs) have osteogenic capacity, producing bone matrix proteins. Application of bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) to PDLFs is a promising approach for periodontal regeneration. However, in chronic bone metabolic disorders, such as periodontitis, proper control of accompanying inflammation is essential for optimizing the effects of BMPs on PDLFs. We have previously shown that low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS), a medical technology that induces mechanical stress using sound waves, significantly promotes osteogenesis in mesenchymal stem cells. Here, we demonstrate that LIPUS promotes the BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of PDLFs. In contrast, BMP2-induced osteogenic differentiation was not altered by LIPUS, probably due to the LIPUS-induced secretion of Noggin, a BMP2 antagonist, from PDLFs. To examine if LIPUS affects inflammatory responses of PDLFs to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from Porphyromonas gingivalis (LPS-PG), we also simultaneously treated PDLFs with LIPUS and LPS-PG. Treatment with LIPUS significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of ERKs, TANK-binding kinase 1, and interferon regulatory factor 3 in LPS-PG-stimulated PDLFs, in addition to inhibiting the degradation of IκB. Furthermore, LIPUS treatment reduced messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha), IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, C-C motif chemokine ligand 2, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1), CXCL10 and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand, and also diminished IL-1ß and tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa)-induced inflammatory reactions. Phosphorylation of Rho-associated kinase 1 (ROCK1) was induced by LIPUS, while ROCK1-specific inhibitor prevented the promotive effects of LIPUS on p38 phosphorylation, mRNA expression of CXCL1 and Noggin, and osteogenesis. The suppressive effects of LIPUS on LPS-PG-stimulated inflammatory reactions were also prevented by ROCK1 inhibition. Moreover, LIPUS treatment blocked inhibitory effects of LPS-PG and IL-1ß on osteogenesis. These results indicate that LIPUS suppresses inflammatory effects of LPS-PG, IL-1ß, and TNFa and also promotes BMP9-induced osteogenesis through ROCK1 in PDLFs.
Objective: To investigate the role and mechanism of the regulation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) by heparin binding-epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) in paclitaxel resistance of ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo. Methods: (1) The detection of NF-κB expression: parental (A2780) and paclitaxel-resistant (A2780/Taxol) ovarian carcinoma cells were divided into four groups, named A2780 group, A2780+cross-reacting material 197 (CRM197, HB-EGF inhibitor) group, A2780/Taxol group and A2780/Taxol+CRM197 group. Among four groups, the expression level HB-EGF and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) were examined by immunofluorescence double staining on confocal microscopy. Western blot was used to detect the expression level of NF-κB. In vivo, A2780 and A2780/Taxol cells were injected intraperitoneally to nude mouse to determine the expression level of NF-κB of the tumors from these four groups by immunohistochemistry method. (2) The detection on the function of NF-κB: A2780/Taxol cells were divided into four groups, named transfected with empty vector+saline group, NF-κB small interference RNA (siRNA)+saline group, empty vector+CRM197 group and NF-κB siRNA+CRM197 group respectively. Among four groups, the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) of A2780/Taxol cells to paclitaxel, the expression level of plasma membrane glycoprotein (P-gp) and the effect of intracellular rhodomine123 (Rh123) accumulation were detected. Results: (1) The detection of NF-κB expression: the expression scores of HB-EGF protein among four groups were 5.6±1.3, 2.1±1.2, 11.7±3.5 and 6.2±1.4; the expression scores of EGFR protein were 5.1±1.6, 2.8±0.6, 10.4±3.1 and 5.6±1.9, respectively. The expression levels of NF-κB protein in the cells of the group named A2780, A2780+CRM197, A2780/Taxol and A2780/Taxol+CRM197 group were 1.89±0.23, 0.74±0.12, 3.45±0.16 and 1.31±0.08, respectively; the expression scores of NF-κB protein in the tissue tumors from four groups were 3.3±1.1, 1.4±0.4, 8.7±2.3 and 3.6±1.2, respectively. The expression level of HB-EGF, EGFR and NF-κB protein between A2780 and A2780/Taxol groups in vivo and in vitro were higher than these in A2780+CRM197 and A2780/Taxol+CRM197 group, while the expression level of HB-EGF, EGFR and NF-κB protein in A2780 group were lower than those in A2780/Taxol groups in vivo and in vitro (P&lt;0.05). (2) The examination of NF-κB function: the IC(50) of A2780/Taxol cells to paclitaxel in groups transfected with empty vector+saline, NF-κB siRNA+saline, empty vector+CRM197 and NF-κB siRNA+CRM197 group were respectively (39.4±0.8), (7.6±0.6), (6.7±0.5) and (4.2±0.4) μmol/L, while the expression levels of P-gp protein among four groups were respectively 3.11±0.23,1.45±0.16, 1.73±0.21 and 0.68±0.14, the cellular Rh123 accumulation among four groups were respectively 110±15, 246±19, 231±22 and 296±24. The expression levels of IC(50) and P-gp protein in groups transfected with NF-κB siRNA+saline, empty vector+CRM197 and NF-κB siRNA+CRM197 group were significantly higher than those in group transfected with empty vector+saline group (P&lt;0.01), while the cellular Rh123 accumulation among three groups were significantly lower than that in group transfected with empty vector+saline (P&lt;0.01). Conclusions: The expression of NF-κB may contributes to the paclitaxel resistance to ovarian cancer. HB-EGF may induce the paclitaxel resistance of ovarian cancer by the regulation of EGFR/NF-κB/P-gp pathway.

Protein kinase C-θ (PKCθ) is an important component of proximal T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. We previously identified the amino-terminal C2 domain of PKCθ as a phosphotyrosine (pTyr)-binding domain. Using a mutant form of PKCθ that cannot bind pTyr (PKCθHR2A), we showed that pTyr binding by PKCθ was required for TCR-induced T cell activation, proliferation, and TH2 cell differentiation but not for T cell development. Using tandem mass spectrometry and coimmunoprecipitation, we identified the kinase ζ-associated protein kinase of 70 kDa (Zap70) as a binding partner of the PKCθ pTyr-binding pocket. Tyr126 of Zap70 directly bound to PKCθ, and the interdomain B residues Tyr315 and Tyr319 were indirectly required for binding to PKCθ, reflecting their role in promoting the open conformation of Zap70. PKCθHR2A-expressing CD4+ T cells displayed defects not only in known PKCθ-dependent signaling events, such as nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation and TH2 cell differentiation, but also in full activation of Zap70 itself and in the activating phosphorylation of linker of activation of T cells (LAT) and phospholipase C-γ1 (PLCγ1), signaling proteins that are traditionally considered to be activated independently of PKC. These findings demonstrate that PKCθ plays an important role in a positive feedback regulatory loop that modulates TCR-proximal signaling and, moreover, provide a mechanistic explanation for earlier reports that documented an important role for PKCθ in T cell Ca2+ signaling. This PKCθ-Zap70 interaction could potentially serve as a promising and highly selective immunosuppressive drug target in autoimmunity and organ transplantation.
The polarization of macrophages is regulated by transcription factors such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1). In this manuscript, we delineated the role of the transcription factor Fos-related antigen 1 (Fra-1) during macrophage activation and development of arthritis. Network level interaction analysis of microarray data derived from Fra-1- or Fra-2-deficient macrophages revealed a central role of Fra-1, but not of Fra-2 in orchestrating the expression of genes related to wound response, toll-like receptor activation and interleukin signaling. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing and standard ChIP analyses of macrophages identified arginase 1 (Arg1) as a target of Fra-1. Luciferase reporter assays revealed that Fra-1 down-regulated Arg1 expression by direct binding to the promoter region. Using macrophage-specific Fra-1- or Fra-2- deficient mice, we observed an enhanced expression and activity of Arg1 and a reduction of arthritis in the absence of Fra-1, but not of Fra-2. This phenotype was reversed by treatment with the arginase inhibitor Nω-hydroxy-nor-L-arginine, while ʟ-arginine supplementation increased arginase activity and alleviated arthritis, supporting the notion that reduced arthritis in macrophage-specific Fra-1-deficient mice resulted from enhanced Arg1 expression and activity. Moreover, patients with active RA showed increased Fra-1 expression in the peripheral blood and elevated Fra-1 protein in synovial macrophages compared to RA patients in remission. In addition, the Fra-1/ARG1 ratio in synovial macrophages was related to RA disease activity. In conclusion, these data suggest that Fra-1 orchestrates the inflammatory state of macrophages by inhibition of Arg1 expression and thereby impedes the resolution of inflammation.
Ginsenosides of Korean Red Ginseng extracts (RGE) and its saponin components suppress secretion of inflammasome-mediating cytokines, whereas the nonsaponin fraction (NS) of RGE oppositely stimulates cytokine secretion. Although direct exposure of NS to macrophages in mice induces cytokine production, oral administration of NS has not been studied in inflammasome-related disease in animal models.
Mice were fed RGE or NS for 7 days and then developed peritonitis. Peritoneal cytokines were measured, and peritoneal exudate cells (PECs) were collected to assay expression levels of a set of toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cytokines in response to NS ingestion. In addition, the role of intestinal bacteria in NS-fed mice was assessed. The effect of preexposure to NS in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) on cytokine production was further confirmed.
NS ingestion attenuated secretion of peritoneal cytokines resulting from peritonitis. In addition, the isolated PECs from NS-fed mice presented lower TLR transcription levels than PECs from control diet-fed mice. BMDMs treated with NS showed downregulation of TLR4 mRNA and protein expression, which was mediated by the TLR4-MyD88-NFκB signal pathway. BMDMs pretreated with NS produced less cytokines in response to TLR4 ligands.
NS administration directly inhibits TLR4 expression in inflammatory cells such as macrophages, thereby reducing secretion of cytokines during peritonitis.
The nuclear hormone receptor retinoic acid receptor-related-orphan-receptor-gamma t (RORγt) is the key transcription factor required for Th17 cell differentiation and for production of IL-17 family cytokines by innate and adaptive immune cells. Dysregulated Th17 immune responses have been associated with the pathogenesis of several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. In this article, we describe the in vitro pharmacology of a potent and selective low molecular weight RORγt inhibitor identified after a structure-based hit-to-lead optimization effort. The compound interfered with co-activator binding to the RORγt ligand binding domain and impaired the transcriptional activity of RORγt as evidenced by blocked IL-17A secretion and RORE-mediated transactivation of a luciferase reporter gene. The inhibitor effectively reduced IL-17A production by human naive and memory T-cells and attenuated transcription of pro-inflammatory Th17 signature genes, such as IL17F, IL22, IL26, IL23R, and CCR6. The compound selectively suppressed the Th17/IL-17 pathway and did not interfere with polarization of other T helper cell lineages. Furthermore, the inhibitor was selective for RORγt and did not modify the transcriptional activity of the closely related family members RORα and RORβ. Using human keratinocytes cultured with supernatants from compound treated Th17 cells we showed that pharmacological inhibition of RORγt translated to suppressed IL-17-regulated gene expression in keratinocyte cell cultures. Furthermore, in ex vivo immersion skin cultures our RORγt inhibitor suppressed IL-17A production by Th17-skewed skin resident cells which correlated with reduced human β defensin 2 expression in the skin. Our data suggests that inhibiting RORγt transcriptional activity by a low molecular weight inhibitor may hold utility for the treatment of Th17/IL-17-mediated skin pathologies.
The peptide derived from Anchovy hydrolysates, Pro-Ala-Tyr-Cys-Ser (PAYCS), was reported to display a neuroprotective effect in vitro in our previous study. The in vivo memory improving effects of PAYCS were investigated in this study. Prior to the scopolamine-induced amnesia mice trial, the stability of PAYCS during digestion was detected and the digestive products were identified. The results showed that PAYCS was susceptible to proteolytic degradation after incubation with pepsin and pancreatin and Pro-Ala-Tyr (PAY) was released and survived during the simulated GI digestion. The results of scopolamine-induced amnesia model trials showed that PAYCS and PAY treatment exhibited cognitive improvement effects in the behavioral tests and different pathways were determined. The results indicated that only PAYCS facilitated cholinergic activity by up-regulating the amount of acetylcholine (Ach) and acetylcholine receptor (AChR). Additionally, both PAYCS and PAY enhanced the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Furthermore, PAYCS was found to be beneficial for the expression of the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived2)-like 2 protein (Nrf2), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). This indicated that PAYCS could regulate the oxidative stress by activating the Nrf2/antioxidant response elements (Nrf2/ARE) pathway. In our study, we demonstrated that the memory improving effects conferred by PAYCS on amnesia mice were linked to the attenuation of the cholinergic system and the activation of Nrf2/ARE and BDNF/CREB signaling.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by abnormal hepatic accumulation of triacylglycerides in the absence of alcohol consumption, in association with oxidative stress (OS), a pro-inflammatory state and insulin resistance (IR), which are attenuated by n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAs) C20-C22 (LCPUFAs) supplementation. Main causes of NAFLD comprise high caloric intake and a sedentary lifestyle, with high intakes of saturated FAs.
The review includes several searches considering the effects of n-3 LCPUFAs in NAFLD in vivo and in vitro models, using the PubMed database from the National Library of Medicine-National Institutes of Health.
The LCPUFAs eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5 n-3, EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6 n-3, DHA) have a positive effect in diminishing liver steatosis, OS, and the levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and pro-inflammatory cytokines, with improvement of insulin sensitivity and adiponectin levels. The molecular pathways described for n-3 LCPUFAs in cellular and animal models and humans include peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α activation favouring FA oxidation, diminution of lipogenesis due to sterol responsive element binding protein-1c downregulation and inflammation resolution. Besides, nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2 activation is elicited by n-3 LCPUFA-derived oxidation products producing direct and indirect antioxidant responses, with concomitant anti-fibrogenic action.
The discussed effects of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation support its use in NAFLD, although having a limited value in NASH, a contention that may involve n-3 LCPUFA oxygenated derivatives. Clinical trials establishing optimal dosages, intervention times, type of patients and possible synergies with other natural products are needed in future studies.
The timely regulation of inflammatory M1 macrophage polarization toward regenerative M2 macrophages suggests the possibility of immunotherapy after myocardial infarction (MI). C1q/TNF-related protein-9 (CTRP9) has anti-inflammatory effects and can ameliorate heart function in mice after long-term myocardial infarction. The role of CTRP9 in macrophage polarization remains completely unclear. This study determined whether CTRP9 can preserve post-MI early cardiac function through the regulation of macrophage polarization. In the present study, an adenovirus-delivered CTRP9 supplement promoted macrophage polarization at Day 3 post MI and improved cardiac function at Day 7 post MI. Pretreatment with gCTRP9 promoted the M1 to M2 polarization transition and attenuated inflammation after lipopolysaccharide + interferon-γ stimulation; the effects were partly abrogated by the adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) inhibitor compound C and were obviously reinforced by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, a nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) inhibitor. Meanwhile, CTPR9 markedly reduced the expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), and NF-κB p65 phosphorylation by promoting AMPK phosphorylation in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, the competitive binding of gCTRP9 and LPS to the myeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD2)/TLR4 complex was associated with direct binding to MD2, thereby inhibiting the downstream signaling molecule MyD88. Taken together, we demonstrated that CTRP9 improved post-MI early cardiac function, at least in part, by modulating M1/M2 macrophage polarization, largely via the TLR4/MD2/MyD88 and AMPK-NF-κB pathways.
Mitophagy is a vital form of autophagy for selective removal of dysfunctional or redundant mitochondria. Accumulating evidence implicates elimination of dysfunctional mitochondria as a powerful means employed by autophagy to keep the immune system in check. The process of mitophagy may restrict inflammatory cytokine secretion and directly regulate mitochondrial antigen presentation and immune cell homeostasis. In this review, we describe distinctive pathways of mammalian mitophagy and highlight recent advances relevant to its function in immunity. In addition, we further discuss the direct and indirect evidence linking mitophagy to inflammation and autoimmunity underlying the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC).

The rapid nuclear translocation of signaling proteins upon stimulation is important for the regulation of de-novo gene expression. However, the molecular mechanisms of this translocation is not well understood, although some studies suggest that much of this translocation may be mediated by beta-like importins (Imps). Here we undertook to study the stimulated nuclear shuttling of JNK and p38 MAPKs.
For this purpose, we used coimmunoprecipitation, proximity ligation assay, gel filtration and immunostaining to examine the mechanism of nuclear translocation of these proteins.
We found that JNK and p38 MAPKs translocate into the nucleus in a Ran dependent, but NLS- or NTS-independent manner, unrelated to their catalytic activity. We show that this translocation involves three β-like Imps, 3, 7 and 9. Knockdown of these Imps inhibits the nuclear translocation of the MAPKs, and thereby, phosphorylation of their transcription factor targets. We further demonstrate that the translocation requires the stimulated formation of heterotrimers composed of Imp3/Imp7/MAPK or Imp3/Imp9/MAPK. JNK1/2 and p38α/β bind to either Imp7 or Imp9 upon stimulated post-translational modifications of the two Imps, while Imp3 joins the complex after its stimulation-induced phosphorylation. Once formed, these heterotrimers move to the nuclear envelope where Imp3 remains, while Imp7 or Imp9 escort the MAPKs into the nucleus.
These results suggest that β-like Imps are central mediators of stimulated nuclear translocation of signaling proteins, providing a central level of regulation of the induction of cellular processes such as transcription upon stimulation.
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease that is typically diagnosed in children. The aim of the present study was to identify potential genes involved in the pathogenesis of childhood T1D. Two datasets of mRNA expression in children with T1D were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in children with T1D were identified. Functional analysis was performed and a protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed, as was a transcription factor (TF)‑target network. The expression of selected DEGs was further assessed using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) analysis. Electronic validation and diagnostic value analysis of the identified DEGs [cytokine inducible SH2 containing protein (CISH), SR‑related CTD associated factor 11 (SCAF11), estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), Rho GTPase activating protein 25 (ARHGAP25), major histocompatibility complex, class II, DR β4 (HLA‑DRB4) and interleukin 23 subunit α (IL23A)] was performed in the GEO dataset. Compared with the normal control group, a total of 1,467 DEGs with P&lt;0.05 were identified in children with T1D. CISH and SCAF11 were determined to be the most up‑ and downregulated genes, respectively. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D (HNRNPD; degree=33), protein kinase AMP‑activated catalytic subunit α1 (PRKAA1; degree=11), integrin subunit α4 (ITGA4; degree=8) and ESR1 (degree=8) were identified in the PPI network as high‑degree genes. ARHGAP25 (degree=12), HNRNPD (degree=10), HLA‑DRB4 (degree=10) and IL23A (degree=9) were high‑degree genes identified in the TF‑target network. RT‑qPCR revealed that the expression of HNRNPD, PRKAA1, ITGA4 and transporter 2, ATP binding cassette subfamily B member was consistent with the results of the integrated analysis. Furthermore, the results of the electronic validation were consistent with the bioinformatics analysis. SCAF11, CISH and ARHGAP25 were identified to possess value as potential diagnostic markers for children with T1D. In conclusion, identifying DEGs in children with T1D may contribute to our understanding of its pathogenesis, and such DEGs may be used as diagnostic biomarkers for children with T1D.
Death receptor 3 (DR3) (a.k.a. tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily 25) plays a key role in the immune system by activating nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells signaling pathway. Here we present the crystal structures of human and mouse DR3 intracellular death domain (DD) at 2.7 and 2.5 Å resolutions, respectively. The mouse DR3 DD adopts a classical six-helix bundle structure while human DR3 DD displays an extended fold. Though there is one-amino-acid difference in the linker between maltose-binding protein (MBP) tag and DR3 DD, according to our self-interaction analysis, the hydrophobic interface discovered in MBP-hDR3 DD crystal structure is responsible for both hDR3 DD and mDR3 DD homotypic interaction. Furthermore, our biochemical analysis indicates that the sequence variation between human and mouse DR3 DD does not affect its structure and function. Small-angle X-ray scattering analysis shows the averaged solution structures of both human and mouse MBP-DR3 DD are the combination of different conformations with different proportion. Through switching to the open conformation, DR3 DD could improve the interaction with downstream element TNFR-associated death domain (TRADD). Here we propose an activation-dependent structural rearrangement model: the DD region is folded as the six-helix bundles in the resting state, while upon extracellular ligand engagement, it switches to the open conformation, which facilitates its self-association and the recruitment of TRADD. Our results provide detailed insights into the architecture of DR3 DD and the molecular mechanism of activation. DATABASES: All refined structure coordinates as well as the corresponding structure factors have been deposited in the PDB under the accession codes 5YGS, 5YEV, 5YGP, 5ZNY, 5ZNZ.
Mutations in the TBK1 (TANK binding kinase 1) gene are causally linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). TBK1 phosphorylates the cargo receptors OPTN and SQSTM1 regulating a critical step in macroautophagy/autophagy. Disruption of the autophagic flux leads to accumulation of cytosolic protein aggregates, which are a hallmark of ALS. hiPSC-derived TBK1-mutant motoneurons (MNs) showed reduced TBK1 levels and accumulation of cytosolic SQSTM1-positive aggresomes. By screening a library of nuclear-receptor-agonists for modifiers of the SQSTM1 aggregates, we identified 4-hydroxy(phenyl)retinamide (4HPR) as a potent modifier exerting detrimental effects on mutant-TBK1 motoneurons fitness exacerbating the autophagy overload. We have shown by TEM that TBK1-mutant motoneurons accumulate immature phagophores due a failure in the elongation phase, and 4HPR further worsens the burden of dysfunctional phagophores. 4HPR-increased toxicity was associated with the upregulation of SQSTM1 in a context of strongly reduced ATG10, while rescue of ATG10 levels abolished 4HPR toxicity. Finally, we showed that 4HPR leads to a downregulation of ATG10 and to an accumulation of SQSTM1+ aggresomes also in hiPSC-derived C9orf72-mutant motoneurons. Our data show that cultured human motoneurons harboring mutations in TBK1 gene display typical ALS features, like decreased viability and accumulation of cytosolic SQSTM1-positive aggresomes. The retinoid 4HPR appears a strong negative modifier of the fitness of TBK1 and C9orf72-mutant MNs, through a pathway converging on the mismatch of initiated autophagy and ATG10 levels. Thus, autophagy induction appears not to be a therapeutic strategy for ALS unless the specific underlying pathway alterations are properly addressed.

The aim of this study was to describe the expression of special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2 (SATB2) in ovarian endometrioid carcinoma (EC). SATB2 is a nuclear matrix-associated transcription factor that is associated with abnormal expression in certain cancers but has not been reported for ovarian carcinoma. SATB2 mRNA and protein expression was first assessed in a pilot cohort of 26 samples by Affymetrix microarray and by routine immunohistochemistry on a small tissue microarray. A large multicenter validation cohort representing the well-characterized cases of 235 ovarian EC from the Canadian Ovarian Experimental Unified Resource (COEUR) was then used to validate this result and to assess the prognostic impact of SATB2 expression. SATB2 staining was scored as negative, weak, moderate, and strong intensity, and by percentage of stained cells. No SATB2 expression was observed in clear cell carcinomas but 10% (n = 3) of the ECs in the pilot cohort showed SATB2 expression. In the validation cohort, strong expression was observed in 11% of ECs, while weak or moderate expression levels were detected in 12% of cases. Evaluation of SATB2 expression with clinicopathological parameters revealed an association with patient age and Federation International of Gynecology and Obstetrics grade but not with disease stage or postoperative residual disease. Any expression of SATB2, independent of intensity, was also associated with longer survival and improved progression-free survival with hazard ratio (HR) = 0.14 (95% CI 0.03-0.56) and HR = 0.16 (95% CI 0.02-1.24) respectively. A greater beneficial effect was observed in patients with stage III/IV disease compared to patients with stage I/II disease. Furthermore, direct comparison of SATB2 with other reported prognostic biomarkers such as progesterone receptor, CDX2 and β-catenin within this cohort showed that SATB2 had the strongest association with survival. Given the current lack of accurate prognostic factors for these patients, SATB2 has promising clinical utility and warrants further study.
Terminal follicular differentiation and ovulation are essential steps of reproduction. They are induced by the increase in circulating LH, and lead to the expulsion from the ovary of oocytes ready to be fertilized. This review summarizes our current understanding of cellular and molecular pathways that control ovulation using a broad mammalian literature, with a specific focus to the mare, which is unique in some aspects of ovarian function in some cases. Essential steps and key factors are approached. The first part of this review concerns LH, receptors and signaling, addressing the description of the equine gonadotropin and cloning, signaling pathways that are activated following the binding of LH to its receptors, and implication of transcription factors which better known are CCAAT-enhancer-binding proteins (CEBP) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). The second and major part is devoted to the cellular and molecular actors within follicular cells during preovulatory maturation. We relate to 1) molecules involved in vascular permeability and vasoconstriction, 2) involvement of neuropeptides, such as kisspeptin, neurotrophins and neuronal growth factor, neuropeptide Y (NPY), 3) the modification of steroidogenesis, steroids intrafollicular levels and enzymes activity, 4) the local inflammation, with the increase in prostaglandins synthesis, and implication of leukotrienes, cytokines and glucocorticoids, 5) extracellular matrix remodelling with involvement of proteases, antiproteases and inhibitors, as well as relaxin, and finaly 6) the implication of oxytocine, osteopontin, growth factors and reactive oxygen species. The third part describes our current knowledge on molecular aspect of in vivo cumulus-oocyte-complexe maturation, with a specific focus on signaling pathways, paracrine factors, and intracellular regulations that occur in cumulus cells during expansion, and in the oocyte during nuclear and cytoplasmic meiosis resumption. Our aim was to give an overall and comprehensive map of the regulatory mechanisms that intervene within the preovulatory follicle during differentiation and ovulation.
Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is critical for whole-body energy metabolism regulation. Recent studies have suggested that physical exercise ameliorates depressive-like behaviors via AMPK activation; however, the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, we examined the effects and underlying mechanisms of AMPK activation on depressive-like behavior in olfactory bulbectomized (OBX) mice. We treated OBX mice with the AMPK activator, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribonucleotide (AICAR) on the 7th or 14th day after bilateral bulbectomy and evaluated depressive-like behavior using the tail-suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST) on the 21st day. The expression of phosphorylated AMPK, protein kinase C ζ (PKCζ), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) in the hippocampus was assessed by western blotting. Hippocampal neurogenesis and localization of AMPK and phosphorylated NF-κB were examined by immunohistochemistry. Chronic AICAR treatment suppressed the prolonged immobility of OBX mice in the TST and FST, and increased the levels of phosphorylated AMPK, PKCζ, NF-κB, CREB, and BDNF. Hippocampal neurogenesis in OBX mice was promoted by chronic AICAR treatment. Co-administration of AICAR with the PKCζ inhibitor or the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 2 (TrkB) antagonist, ANA-12, inhibited these effects. Phosphorylated AMPK was detected in mature and immature hippocampal neurons and microglia, while phosphorylated NF-κB was detected only in neurons in AICAR-treated OBX mice. These data indicate that AMPK activation produces anti-depressant effects, which are mediated by elevated hippocampal neurogenesis potentially via PKCζ/NF-κB/BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling in neurons.
[68Ga]Ga-ABY-025/PET-CT targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) has demonstrated its potential clinical value for the detection and quantification of HER2 in a phase I clinical study with breast cancer patients. Previously, the radiopharmaceutical was prepared manually, however larger scale of multicenter clinical trials and routine healthcare requires automation of the production process to limit the operator radiation dose, improve tracer manufacturing robustness, and provide on-line documentation for good manufacturing practice (GMP) compliance. The production of [68Ga]Ga-ABY-025 was implemented on the Modular-Lab PharmTrace synthesis platform (Eckert &amp; Ziegler) and disposable cassettes were developed. Pharmaceutical grade 68Ge/68Ga generator (GalliaPharm®) was used in the study. The active pharmaceutical ingredient starting material ABY-025 (GMP grade) was provided by Affibody AB. The patient examinations were conducted using a Discovery MI PET/CT scanner (20 cm FOV, GE Healthcare). Reproducible and GMP compliant fully automated production of [68Ga]Ga-ABY-025 was developed. The radiochemical purity of the product was 98.7 ± 0.6% with total peptide content of 315 ± 15 µg (n = 3). Radionuclidic purity, sterility, endotoxin content, residual solvent content, and sterile filter integrity were controlled and met acceptance criteria. The product was stable at ambient temperature for at least 2 h. The primary tumor and metastasis were detected with SUVmax values of 8.3 and 16.0, respectively. Automated production of [68Ga]Ga-ABY-025 was established and the process was validated enabling standardized multicenter phase II and III clinical trials and routine clinical use. Patient examinations conformed to the radiopharmaceutical biodistribution observed in the previous phase I study.
Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase interacting factor 2/estrogen receptor α-binding protein (TdIF2/ERBP) is a multifunctional nucleolar protein. The nucleolar localization of TdIF2/ERBP is important for its functions because it promotes ribosomal RNA transcription. However, signal sequences that direct TdIF2/ERBP to the nucleolus are not well characterized. We examined the TdIF2/ERBP sequence using truncation and mutation analyses to determine whether the nucleosome binding and C-terminal domains of TdIF2/ERBP possess nucleolar localization signals (NoLSs). In these domains, four NoLSs that could direct the mCherry protein to the nucleolus were detected. In addition, a short stretch of hydrophobic residues (VLLVL) in the center of TdIF2/ERBP acted as a nucleolar exclusion signal, which reduced the nucleolar accumulation of mCherry-NoLS fusion proteins. These results would contribute to improving the prediction of NoLSs from protein sequences. The short, transferrable localization signals would be valuable tools for understanding the association between localization and functions of nucleolar proteins. Abbreviations TdIF2: terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase interacting factor 2; ERBP: estrogen receptor α-binding protein; EGFP: enhanced green fluorescent protein; NLS: nuclear localization signal; NoLS: nucleolar localization signal; NoES: nucleolar exclusion signal; DAPI: 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.
Diesel exhaust particles (DEPs) are common environmental air pollutants known to impair expression and activity of drug detoxifying proteins, including hepatic ATP-binding cassette (ABC) drug transporters. The present study was designed to determine whether organic DEP extract (DEPe) may also target ABC drug transporters in bronchial cells. DEPe (10 μg/mL) was demonstrated to induce mRNA and protein expression of the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) 3 in cultured bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells, whereas mRNA levels of other MRPs, multidrug resistance gene 1 or breast cancer resistance protein were unchanged, reduced or not detected. DEPe also increased MRP3 mRNA expression in normal human bronchial epithelial cells. Inhibition of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway by AhR antagonist or AhR silencing, as well as the silencing of nuclear-factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) repressed DEPe-mediated MRP3 induction. This underlines the implication of the AhR and Nrf2 signaling cascades in DEPe-mediated MRP3 regulation. DEPe was additionally demonstrated to directly inhibit MRP activity in BEAS-2B cells, in a concentration-dependent manner. Taken together, these data indicate that DEPs may impair expression and activity of MRPs, notably MRP3, in human bronchial cells, which may have consequences in terms of lung barrier and toxicity for humans exposed to diesel pollution.
Fibroblast growth factor 21(FGF21) plays an important role in the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism. MS-275, as a class I-specific histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, has also been reported to affect energy metabolism. In this current study, we investigated the effects of MS-275 on hepatic FGF21 expression in vitro and in vivo, and explored whether cAMP-responsive element-binding protein H（CREBH） was involved in the action of MS-275. Our results showed that MS-275 stimulated hepatic FGF21 mRNA and protein expressions in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as well as FGF21 secretion in primary mouse hepatocytes. Serum concentration and hepatic expression of FGF21 were elevated after injection of MS-275, along with increased expressions of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and ketogenic production (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gammacoactivator1α,PGC-1α; Carnitine palmitoyl-transferase 1a,CPT1a;3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2,Hmgcs2) as well as improved blood lipid profile. As a proved transcription factor of FGF21, the expression of CREBH was initiated by MS-275, with increased Histone H3 Lysine 18 acetylation(H3K18ac) signals and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF-4α) recruitment in CREBH promoter. Adenovirus-mediated knockdown of CREBH abolished MS-275-induced hepatic FGF21 and lipid metabolism-related gene expressions.These results suggest that MS-275 induces hepatic FGF21 by H3K18ac-mediated CREBH expression.
Glial activation and neuroinflammation play significant roles in apoptosis as well as in the development of cognitive and memory deficits. Neuroinflammation is also a critical feature in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer and Parkinson's diseases. Previously, hesperetin has been shown to be an effective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. In the present study, in vivo and in vitro analyses were performed to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of hesperetin in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, neuronal apoptosis and memory impairments. Based on our findings, LPS treatment resulted in microglial activation and astrocytosis and elevated the expression of inflammatory mediators such as phosphorylated-Nuclear factor-κB (p-NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in the cortical and hippocampal regions and in BV2 cells. However, hesperetin cotreatment markedly reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokines by ameliorating Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4)-mediated ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1/glial fibrillary acidic protein (Iba-1/GFAP) expression. Similarly, hesperetin attenuated LPS-induced generation of reactive oxygen species/lipid per oxidation (ROS/LPO) and improved the antioxidant protein level such as nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and Haem-oxygenase (HO-1) in the mouse brain. Additionally, hesperetin ameliorated cytotoxicity and ROS/LPO induced by LPS in HT-22 cells. Moreover, hesperetin rescued LPS-induced neuronal apoptosis by reducing the expression of phosphorylated-c-Jun N-terminal kinases (p-JNK), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein (Bax), and Caspase-3 protein and promoting the Bcl-2 protein level. Furthermore, hesperetin enhanced synaptic integrity, cognition, and memory processes by enhancing the phosphorylated-cAMP response element binding protein (p-CREB), postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95), and Syntaxin. Overall, our preclinical study suggests that hesperetin conferred neuroprotection by regulating the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway against the detrimental effects of LPS.
In the present study, we evaluated the performance of different protocols for the hepatic differentiation of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) in microfluidic biochips. Strategies for complete and partial on-chip differentiation were tested. Unlike full on-chip differentiation, the transfer of iPSCs from Petri dishes to biochips during the differentiation process produced a heterogeneous tissue with enhanced hepatic features compared with control cultures in Petri dishes. The tissue in biochips was constituted of cells expressing either stabilin-1 or albumin, while no stabilin-1 was detected in controls. Functional analysis also revealed double the production rate for albumin in biochips (about 2,000 ng per day per 106 cells). Besides this, tissues obtained in biochips and controls exhibited the metabolism of a specific bile acid. Whole transcriptome analysis with nanoCAGE exhibited a differential expression of 302 genes between control and biochip cultures and a higher degree of hepatic differentiation in biochips, together with increased promoter motif activity for typical liver transcription factors such as estrogen related receptor alpha ( ESRRA), hepatic nuclear factor 1 ( HNF1A), hepatic nuclear factor 4 ( HNF4A), transcription factor 4 ( TCF4), and CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha ( CEBPA). Gene set enrichment analysis identified several pathways related to the extracellular matrix, tissue reorganization, hypoxia-inducible transcription factor, and glycolysis that were differentially modulated in biochip cultures. However, the presence of CK19/ALB-positive cells and the ɑ-fetoprotein levels measured in the cultures still reflect primitive differentiation patterns. Overall, we identified key parameters for improved hepatic differentiation on-chip, including the maturation stage of hepatic progenitors, inoculation density, adhesion time, and perfusion flow rate. Optimization of these parameters further led to establish a protocol for reproducible differentiation of hiPSCs into hepatocyte-like cells in microfluidic biochips with significant improvements over Petri dish cultures.
sFLT1 (soluble VEGF [vascular endothelial growth factor] receptor-1) levels are increased in preeclampsia-a pathological condition of pregnancy. The mechanism of sFLT1 overexpression by gestational tissues, particularly the decidua, remains unknown. Mass spectrometry measurement of the active retinoid metabolite, all-trans retinoic acid (RA), showed significantly lower levels of RA in preeclamptic versus normotensive decidua. In this study, we investigated the involvement of RA in regulating decidual sFLT1 expression. When decidual stromal cells (DSCs) isolated from the decidua basalis of normotensive and preeclampsia placentas were treated with BMS493-a pan-RAR (RA nuclear receptor) antagonist-upregulation of sFLT1 expression was observed. Conversely, treatment with RA resulted in downregulation of sFLT1 in normotensive DSCs and preeclampsia DSCs. Unlike treatment with cAMP, which induces decidualization while downregulating sFLT1, RA treatment did not alter DSC expression of prolactin-a marker of decidualization-or FOXO1 (forkhead box protein 01)-a transcription factor required for prolactin upregulation. TFAP2A (transcription factor AP-2-alpha [activating enhancer-binding protein 2 alpha]), a different transcription factor was upregulated in normotensive DSCs but not in preeclampsia DSCs after RA treatment. Collectively, our data show that RA suppresses sFLT1 expression in DSCs independently of cellular decidualization. These findings suggest that reduced decidual RA levels may contribute to preeclampsia pathogenesis by allowing sFLT1 accumulation at the maternal-fetal interface.
The collagenase B type IV (Col4B) gene is highly expressed in the osteoclast, the primary bone-resorbing cell. However, factors that regulate expression of the Col4B gene are not well characterized. A murine P1 genomic clone containing a 94 kb sequence insert which contains the Col4B gene was isolated. A 4 kb EcoR1 DNA fragment containing the 5' flanking sequence of the gene was further subcloned and restriction mapped. Putative transcription factors such as SRY, Lyf-1, and GATA1 and 2, binding motifs were identified by sequence analysis in this promoter region. Enhancer and suppressor regions were mapped by transient expression of Col4B gene promoter deletion mutant-luciferase reporter gene constructs in HepG2 cells. Col4B mRNA expression in different murine tissues was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and demonstrated high levels of expression in bone, clavaria, spleen and thymus. This promoter provides a valuable tool for targeting gene expression to the osteoclast.
The structure of the RT6 mono(ADP-ribosyl)transferase gene was studied. Analysis of cDNA clones revealed eight exons and suggested two independent transcriptional start sites. The existence of the downstream initiation site was confirmed by S1-nuclease protection and localized to position +29 of exon 2. The corresponding 5' flanking regions were found to contain typical promoter structures such as TATA- and CCAAT-boxes. Comparison with sequences deposited in the TRANSFAC database of transcription factor binding sites revealed few putative regulatory elements in the region associated with exon 1 (promoter 1). In contrast, several elements contained in the regulatory regions of other T cell-specific genes, such as ets, lyf-1 and ikaros were found in in promoter 2. Analysis of RT6-transcripts showed this region to be the most active promoter in spleen cells of adult rats. Finally, transient transfection assays with reporter gene constructs showed promoter 2 to mediate T-cell specific transcription.
The class II transactivator (CIITA) is essential for the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens. The tissular patterns of CIITA and MHC class II gene expression are tightly correlated: CIITA mRNA is highly expressed in B cells, and is induced by interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) in macrophage and epithelial cell lines. We first isolated two overlapping cosmids encoding human CIITA which, when co-transfected, are able to restore MHC class II expression in a B-lymphoblastoid cell line (B-LCL) defective for CIITA. Subsequently, a 1.8 kilobase (kb) fragment of the CIITA promoter was isolated and sequenced. A motif presenting a strong similarity to an initiator was detected, as well as putative binding sites for Sp1, GATA-2, LyF-1, ets-1, AP1, and MZF1 transcription factors, and two GAS motifs. When introduced in front of a luciferase reporter gene, this promoter is able to direct a high luciferase activity in a human B-LCL. In contrast, luciferase expression was not stimulated after IFN-gamma treatment when the construct was transfected in macrophage or in epithelial cell lines. However, an induction of the human CIITA gene was observed in mouse macrophage and fibrosarcoma cell lines, when the cells were transfected with a cosmid containing the human CIITA gene, but lacking the 1.8 kb promoter described above. Taken together, these data suggest the existence of an intragenic promoter driving an IFN-gamma-inducible expression of CIITA.
Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1; CD31) is a cell adhesion molecule involved in transendothelial migration and expressed by hemopoietic and endothelial cells. To understand the mechanisms underlying its regulated expression, a genomic clone containing 1555 bp of the 5'-flanking region and the first exon of the human PECAM-1 gene has been isolated. The 5'-flanking region of the PECAM-1 gene lacks a consensus TATA box, but contains consensus motifs for Sp1, EGR1, ets, helix-loop-helix (HLH) box, GATA, AP-2, C/EBP, YY1, CCACC, LyF-1, imperfect octamer, heptamer, high mobility group proteins (HMG) box, and nuclear factor-kappaB, as well as shear stress-, retinoic acid-, glucocorticoid-, and acute phase-responsive elements, and an Alu sequence. Successive 5' to 3' or 3' to 5' deletions revealed tissue-specific promoter activity within the two contiguous 0.22-kb NheI/BglII and 0.44-kb BglII/PstI fragments. The transcriptional activity displayed by the 0.22-kb NheI/BglII fragment was specific for the myeloid lineage, whereas the promoter activity of the 0.44-kb BglII/PstI fragment was apparently restricted to endothelial cells. The transcriptional activity of the 0.22-kb NheI/BglII fragment was confirmed by 5' RACE (rapid amplification of 5' cDNA ends) and S1 nuclease protection experiments that revealed previously unidentified transcription start sites. The 0.22-kb NheI/BglII promoter exhibited PMA inducibility in myeloid cells and contained a PMA-responsive element recognized by Sp1 and EGR-1 transcription factors. Isolation and characterization of the human PECAM-1 promoter represent an initial step in elucidating the controlled expression of the PECAM-1 gene.
Much research has been conducted to investigate the effects of environmental and nutritional treatments on ovarian development in poultry. However, to investigate the ovary, the hen must be killed, and thus, lifelong egg production can only be inferred. To date, the ability to noninvasively determine ovarian status has not been available. Improvements in ultrasound technology now make it possible to observe ovarian condition in vivo, thereby allowing for repeated sampling of the same bird over an entire egg production cycle. In the current study, large yellow follicles (LYF; diameter greater than 10 mm) were characterized in broiler breeder hens using Aloka ultrasound diagnostic equipment. Ultrasound images were used to determine the number and diameter of the LYF as well as the presence of an egg in the oviduct. Immediately following ultrasonography, hens were killed and dissected to determine the number and diameter of LYF. From the ultrasound images, the number of LYF +/- 1 was predicted with 96.3% accuracy in Experiment 1 and 93.3% accuracy in Experiment 2. Diameter measurements were used to classify follicles hierarchically. Of the birds determined via dissection to have multiple hierarchies, 77.8% were identified with ultrasound. All regressing or regressed ovaries were correctly identified with ultrasound.
Senescence marker protein-30 (SMP30) gene expression declines during aging in mouse liver. SMP30 also plays a role as Ca(2+)-binding protein localized in cytosol of hepatocytes. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of regulation of SMP30 gene expression we have cloned its gene promoter and carried out DNA-protein interaction analyses by DNase I footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. We have identified a total of eight nuclear factor binding sites within 0.8 kb upstream of transcription start site. Three of these sites are novel DNA sequences with no homology to the existing transcription factor binding site database. Interaction of nuclear factors to these novel cognate sites are DNA sequence-specific. The other five sites correspond to binding sites of known transcription factors, Sp1, AP2, CCAAT box, Lyf-1, and GATA-1. Coordinated orchestration of these factors may contribute to regulation of SMP30 gene expression.
MUNC18-1 (n-Sec1) is a brain-specific protein and is known to play a role in neurotransmitter release by mediating docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles to presynaptic membranes. The protein is also implicated in the cellular excretion process of hormones and other biological substances in other mammalian tissues and yeasts. We have studied the structure of mouse munc18-1 gene by sequencing the genomic munc18-1 gene and its 5'-flanking region. munc18-1 gene comprises 19 exons whose size ranges from 50 base pairs (2nd exon) to 1676 base pairs (19th exon) with a total gene size of approximately 56 kilobases. In the 5'-flanking region, there are several transcription factor binding sites such as for HSF2, Lyf-1, and Sp1 but no TATA or CAAT sequences. munc18-1 gene was mapped on mouse chromosome 2 between two anchor markers D2Mit152 and D2Mit242. Transfection experiments employing these and upstream sequences suggest the presence of a sequence(s) that negatively regulates the expression of munc18-1 gene.
The lymphocyte-specific DNA-binding protein LyF-1 interacts with a critical control element in the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT) promoter as well as with the promoters for other genes expressed during early stages of B- and T-cell development. We have purified LyF-1 and have obtained a partial amino acid sequence from proteolytic peptides. The amino acid sequence suggests that LyF-1 is a zinc finger protein encoded by the Ikaros gene, which previously was implicated in T-cell development. Recombinant Ikaros expressed in Escherichia coli bound to the TdT promoter, and antisera directed against the recombinant protein specifically blocked the DNA-binding activity of LyF-1 in crude extracts. Further analysis revealed that at least six distinct mRNAs are derived from the Ikaros/LyF-1 gene by alternative splicing. Only two of the isoforms possess the N-terminal zinc finger domain that is necessary and sufficient for TdT promoter binding. Although both of these isoforms bound to similar sequences in the TdT, lambda 5, VpreB, and lck promoters, one isoform contains an additional zinc finger that resulted in altered recognition of some binding sites. At least four of the Ikaros/LyF-1 isoforms were detectable in extracts from B- and T-cell lines, with the relative amounts of the isoforms varying considerably. These data reveal that the LyF-1 protein is encoded by specific mRNAs derived from the alternatively-spliced Ikaros gene, suggesting that this gene may be important for the early stages of both B- and T-lymphocyte development.
Expression of the human CD8 alpha gene is restricted to cells of the lymphoid lineage and developmentally regulated during thymopoiesis. As an initial step towards understanding the molecular basis for tissue-specific expression of this gene, we surveyed the surrounding chromatin structure for potential cis-acting regulatory regions by DNase I hypersensitivity mapping and found four hypersensitive sites, three of which were T cell restricted. By using a reporter-based expression approach, a T-cell-specific enhancer was identified by its close association with a prominent T-cell-restricted hypersensitive sites in the last intron of the CD8 alpha gene. Deletion studies demonstrated that the minimal enhancer is adjacent to a negative regulatory element. DNA sequence analysis of the minimal enhancer revealed a striking cluster of consensus binding sites for Ets-1, TCF-1, CRE, GATA-3, LyF-1, and bHLH proteins which were verified by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In addition, the 5' end of the enhancer was composed of an Alu repeat which contained the GATA-3, bHLH, and LyF-1 binding sites. Site-directed mutation of the Ets-1 and GATA-3 sites dramatically reduced enhancer activity. The functional importance of the other binding sites only became apparent when combinations of mutations were analyzed. Taken together, these results suggest that the human CD8 alpha gene is regulated by the interaction of multiple T-cell nuclear proteins with a transcriptional enhancer located in the last intron of the gene. Comparison of the CD8 alpha enhancer with other recently identified T-cell-specific regulatory elements suggests that a common set of transcription factors regulates several T-cell genes.
Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT) is a template-independent DNA polymerase that is expressed transiently during the earliest stages of B- and T-cell ontogeny. Previously, we characterized the promoter for the murine TdT gene and identified a novel DNA-binding protein, called LyF-1, that interacts with a DNA sequence element found to be critical for transcriptional activity in lymphoid cell lines. Here, we present a more detailed analysis of this 30-bp control element, called the TdT D' element, which is centered approximately 60 bp upstream of the transcription start site. We found that both the murine and human D' elements are recognized by multiple proteins, including LyF-1 and at least two Ets family proteins, Ets-1 and Fli-1. Additional protein-DNA interactions were identified through studies using unfractionated nuclear extracts, in which the D' element was apparently incorporated into a multiprotein complex, possibly containing an Ets protein as a core component. By analyzing a series of substitution mutations, two adjacent binding sites for LyF-1 were identified in the murine D' element, with the Ets protein binding site closely coinciding with the proximal, lower-affinity LyF-1 site. Transient transfection analysis with these mutations revealed that only a 10-bp region, containing precisely the Ets and proximal LyF-1 binding sites, was needed for D' activity. These results suggest an important role for an Ets family protein in the expression of the TdT gene. The role of LyF-1 is less clear; it might act in conjunction with the Ets protein bound at the D' element or it might be unnecessary for D' activity.
We have studied transcriptional control of the murine terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT) gene, which is activated specifically in immature B and T lymphocytes. This analysis has led to the identification and purification of a 50-kDa sequence-specific DNA-binding protein, LyF-1, that interacts with the approximate consensus sequence PyPyTGGGAGPu and is enriched in cells at most stages of B- and T-cell differentiation. LyF-1 binds tightly to an element in the TdT promoter that we show is required for transcription in lymphocytes. LyF-1 also interacts with an element in the immunoglobulin mu enhancer, called microB, that was recently shown to be important for lymphocyte-specific enhancer activity. Moreover, LyF-1 binds to the promoters for the lymphocyte-specific genes lambda 5, VpreB, and lck, all of which we speculate have additional features in common with the TdT promoter. Thus, LyF-1 may be a general transcriptional activator for genes whose expression is restricted to the B- and/or T-lymphocyte lineages.
The expression of Pax-5 gene is altered in human myeloma cells (malignant plasma cells). This altered expression is considered to be closely involved in oncogenesis of human myeloma. To investigate the possible mechanism(s) underlying this alteration, we first cloned the 1,050 bp fragment in the 5' upstream region of human Pax-5 gene by PCR-mediated gene walking method. The cloned fragment has predicted regulatory motifs for Lyf-1(Ik-1), IK-2, bHLH, E-47, Sox-5, Oct-1, GATA-1,-2, and -3, but it lacks a TATA box. By constructing deletion mutants of this fragment, its basal promoter activity was analyzed by transfecting these mutants to Cos 7 cells. The maximal promoter activity was recovered by the fragment that extends between -70 to -820 upstream of the transcription start site. Also, three DNA fragments from this cloned sequence were used as templates in gel shift assay; these fragments covered most of the predicted regulatory sites. Specific binding activities were found in each DNA fragment. Therefore, we could clone the functionally active fragment of 5' upstream region of human Pax-5 gene.
The product of the B-cell-specific B29 gene (B29, Ig beta, CD79b) is essential for Ig-mediated B-cell activation via the B-cell antigen receptor complex (BCR) on human and murine B lymphocytes. To better understand the regulation of this pivotal gene, we have analyzed the human genomic DNA sequence upstream of the B29 ATG start codon for transcriptional control activity. The human B29 gene lacks either a TATA or a CAAT box and transcription is initiated at multiple sites. The minimal promoter of the human B29 gene is contained within a 193-bp region 5' of these multiple start sites. This minimal promoter exhibits B-cell-specific activity and contains SP1, ETS, OCT, and IKAROS/LYF-1 transcription factor motifs. All these motifs are strikingly conserved in sequence and placement relative to the previously characterized murine B29 promoter. Additional upstream gene segments dramatically affected B29 minimal promoter activity. A newly identified motif called the B29 conserved sequence (BCS), found upstream of both human and murine B29 promoters, appears to stimulate B29 transcription through a novel mechanism. A single BCS had little effect either on the minimal B29 promoter or on a heterologous promoter. Instead, the BCS stimulated transcription by counteracting 5' negative regulatory DNA sequences that block the activity of the B29 minimal promoter in its absence. These findings indicate that B29 gene expression is controlled by the complex interplay of positive and negative regulatory elements.
The mouse Bp3 antigen is a variably glycosylated phosphatidylinositol-linked cell surface glycoprotein expressed on early B and T lineage cells, myeloid cells, intestinal epithelial cells, and a discrete population of reticular cells in peripheral lymphoid tissues. The deduced amino acid sequence of Bp3 cDNA shares significant similarity to human and mouse CD38 and molluscan ADP-ribosyl cyclase, enzymes that generate the calcium mobilizing agent cyclic ADP-ribose from NAD. In this study, we cloned and characterized the Bp3 gene. The gene consists of nine exons and spans approximately 27 kilobases. The overall exon organization is very similar to that reported for the ADP-ribosyl cyclase gene in the mollusc Aplysia kurodai. The Bp3 gene is located on mouse chromosome 5 very near the gene for CD38, suggesting that this family arose by gene duplication. The major transcriptional start site of the Bp3 gene in a pro-B cell line (-17 from the ATG start codon) contains a weak initiator sequence. The upstream region lacks a TATA box, but contains consensus recognition sequences for the PU. 1, Ikaros/LyF-1, E2A, and TCF-1 transcriptional factors that regulate gene expression in lymphoid and myeloid cells. Consensus motifs for cytokine responsive factors NF-IL6/C-EBP, H-APF-1/APRF, and AP-1 are also present in the flanking region, and interleukin-6 treatment enhances expression of the Bp3 antigen by a myeloblastoid cell line.
Activation of natriuretic peptide receptor-A (NPRA) produces the second messenger cGMP, which plays a pivotal role in maintaining blood pressure and cardiovascular homeostasis. In the present study, we have examined the role of trans-acting factor Ets-1 in transcriptional regulation of Npr1 gene (coding for NPRA). Using deletional analysis of the Npr1 promoter, we have defined a 400 base pair (bp) region as the core promoter, which contains consensus binding sites for transcription factors including: Ets-1, Lyf-1, and GATA-1/2. Overexpression of Ets-1 in mouse mesangial cells (MMCs) enhanced Npr1 gene transcription by 12-fold. However, overexpression of GATA-1 or Lyf-1 repressed Npr1 basal promoter activity by 50% and 80%, respectively. The constructs having a mutant Ets-1 binding site or lacking this site failed to respond to Ets-1 activation of Npr1 gene transcription. Collectively, the present results demonstrate that Ets-1 greatly stimulates Npr1 gene promoter activity, implicating its critical role in the regulation and function of NPRA at the molecular level.
Immunoglobulin class switching is characteristic to the tetrapod lineage, but the nature of this process has been elucidated only in mammals, where I-exon transcription initiates and directs the recombination in the IgH locus. Here, it is shown that an I-exon occurs 5' of the nu (IgY constant region) gene of the duck (Anas platyrhynchos): it is longer than mammalian I-exons and comprised primarily of tandem repeats. The Inu promoter was identified and shown to be responsive to stimulation with IL-4 but not LPS. It contains Oct, LYF-1, ATF, and C/EBP motifs. Site directed mutagenesis indicates that 2 C/EBP motifs are uniquely necessary for the response of the promoter to IL-4, as tested in the mouse pre-B cell line, 70Z/3. These results support the conclusion that the signal transduction pathways controlling I-exon promoter responses to cytokines have been highly conserved in vertebrate evolution.
A CD40 homolog cDNA encoding 300 amino acid residues was isolated from a Japanese flounder leukocyte cDNA library. The amino acid sequence identities of Japanese flounder CD40 and previously reported CD40s of cow, human, mouse, and chicken range from 32 to 35%. The positions of cysteine residues, CD40 ligand binding amino acid residues, and four cysteine-rich domains are well conserved in Japanese flounder CD40. The Japanese flounder CD40 gene is composed of nine exons and eight intervening introns spread over 6 kb. The nucleotide sequence of the 5'-flanking region of this gene revealed the presence of several regulatory regions, including a TATA-like box, AP-1-, CEBPB-, IRF-1-, LYF-1-, NF-kappaBp-, SP-1-, and Stat-1-like motifs. In healthy fish, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detected constitutive expression of CD40 in all tested tissues (leukocytes, kidney, spleen, liver, intestine, brain, gill, and skin). The mRNA of CD40 was predominantly expressed in several tissues that contained lymphocytes (leukocytes, kidney, spleen, intestine, and gill). Expression of the Japanese flounder CD40 molecule was induced in peripheral blood leukocytes from 1 to 6 h following Con A (50 microg/ml)/phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (0.35 microg/ml) stimulation, with a peak at 1 h after stimulation, and increased at 1, 3, and 6 h after induction by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (500 microg/ml) compared with the control.
A second CD3 gene, i.e. CD3epsilon, has been cloned and sequenced in Japanese flounder. The full length cDNA is 1006 bp and encodes 164 amino acids. When compared with other known CD3epsilon peptide sequences, the most conserved region of the Japanese flounder CD3epsilon chain peptide is the cytoplasmic domain and the least conserved is the extracellular domain. A phylogenetic analysis based on the deduced amino acid sequence grouped the two Japanese flounder CD3 sequences with CD3epsilon and CD3gamma(delta, respectively. The Japanese flounder CD3epsilon gene has Lyf-1, GATAs, Oct-1, CEBPs, AP-1, and NF-AT but lacks TATA and CCAAT elements in the 5' flanking region. The Japanese flounder CD3 cluster (consisting of CD3epsilon and CD3gamma(delta) spans only 10.4 kb. The two genes are oppositely transcribed only 3.8 kb apart. Both Japanese flounder CD3 genes have five exons. The two Japanese flounder CD3 genes were predominantly expressed in PBLs, kidney, spleen, and gills. A polyclonal rabbit antiserum that reacts with the CD3 marker on human T cells also reacted with Japanese flounder CD3epsilon. The epitope highly conserved between mammalian and non-mammalian CD3epsilons, this antibody bound to a single 15 kDa peptide.
Frizzled-related protein (Frp) is a newly identified family of secreted proteins involved in the Wnt signaling pathway. To date, little is known about the underlying mechanisms regulating Frp expression. In this study the promoter region of mouse frizzled related protein 4 (sFrp4) gene was cloned, sequenced, and analyzed using transient reporter assays along with site-directed mutagenesis. Two clusters of cis-acting elements, STAT3/Lyf-1/MZF1 (site 1) and C/EBP-beta/ GATA-1/CREB (site 2) located in the promoter region from -238 to -144 were found to be essential for the promoter activity of sFrp4. In addition to sites 1 and 2, putative transcriptional factor binding sites for TFIID, SP1/GC and ATF/CREB exhibited positive, while the site for NRSE exhibited negative regulatory functions, as determined by the alkaline phosphatase activities of the reporter assay. We also demonstrate that the ATF/CREB site may cooperatively interact with the NRSF-like element in regulating sFrp4 promoter activity. The data of our study, which is the first promoter analysis of mouse Frp genes, provide the basis for understanding the functions and the regulation of Frp and its role in regulating Wnt signals.
Tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2 (TFPI-2), a serine protease inhibitor abundant in the extracellular matrix, is expressed in high amounts in low-grade, non-invasive glioma cells but in low amounts in high-grade, highly invasive glioma cells. Overexpression of TFPI-2 by highly invasive glioma cells reduces their invasiveness and thus may be useful in cancer therapy. The mechanisms underlying the transcriptional regulation of TFPI-2 are not well elucidated. We previously reported that the -312 to +1 region of TFPI-2 was critical for the minimal, inducible regulation of TFPI-2 in gliomas. This region harbors sites for several transcription factors, including SP1 (-192 to -183 and -135 to -128), AP-1 (-310 to -300, -213 to -204, and -163 to -154), NF-kappaB (-229 to -221), an NF-kappaB-like site (-291 to -281), and Lyf-1 (-260 to -252). Here we transiently transfected low-grade Hs683 glioma cells with mutant constructs to clarify the role of these transcription factors in TFPI-2 regulation. Addition of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol, IFN-gamma, or IFN-alpha induced the expression of TFPI-2 wild-type promoter construct as well as TFPI-2 protein and mRNA in Hs683 cells. Mutations at either of two AP-1 sites (-310 to -300 and -163 to -154) or either of two SP1 sites (-192 to -183 and -135 to -128) resulted in reduced TFPI-2 activity, regardless of the presence of stimulator compounds, and reduction in DNA-protein binding (by electrophoretic mobility shift assay).
Human glia maturation factor-gamma (hGMFG) was recently identified as a gene that is homologous to glia maturation factor-beta (GMFB). In this study, we determined the organization of the 9.5-kb hGMFG gene and characterized its promoter activity. The 5'-flanking region of the first exon has putative elements for binding transcription factors Sp-1, GATA-1, AML-1a, Lyf-1 and Ets-1, but there were no TATA or CAAT boxes within a 226-bp sequence upstream from the initiation codon. Primer extension analysis and 5'RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA 5' ends) identified multiple transcription initiation sites within the region -84 to -70 nucleotides from the first ATG codon in a Kozak consensus sequence. A core promoter region was determined by transfecting a series of deletion constructs with a dual luciferase reporter system into rat astrocyte-derived ACT-57 cells. We found that 226 bp of the core promoter region exhibited bidirectional promoter activity.
Our earlier studies (Gene 268 (2001) 183) showed that transcription of the mouse gamma-glutamyl hydrolase (gamma GH) gene is under the control of two separate promoters widely distributed within the genome. We now report on further studies examining the functional characteristics of the more efficient promoter (promoter A) which is contiguous with an exon 1 (exon A1a) alternate within the main body of the gene. Functional deletion analysis of promoter A in pGL3 transfected in NIH3T3 cells defined a 189 bp region of sequence 26 bp upstream of exon A1a as mediating core promoter transcriptional activity. Further functional deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis attributed the activity of this core region to the presence of five SP1 sites within the most upstream 130 bp of sequence and the presence of three cis-active elements, Ets-1, Lyf-1 and E2F in the remaining downstream 59 bp of sequence. Electrophoretic gel-mobility shift assays showed that differences in the binding of trans-acting factors to these three elements accounts for the tumor-specific expression of this gene. Finally, analysis by fluorescent in situ hybridization revealed that promoter A and the main body of the mouse gamma GH gene are located between A3 and A5 on chromosome 4. This is an interesting finding in light of our earlier results which located promoter B and two associated alternates of exon 1 of this gene on chromosome 17.
IL-28Rα and IL10Rβ collectively construct a fully functional hetero-dimeric receptor for type III interferons (IFNs). IL-28Rα is the private chain for type III IFNs since their involvement in any other pathway has not been reported yet and they are highly expressed in response to certain viral attack or cancers. IL-28Rα is specific in their expression pattern and it expresses within few cell types only. The regulatory mechanisms governing the expression of IL-28Rα at the molecular level are not completely known yet and need to be scrutinized at primary levels. In the present study, various in-silico techniques were applied and it was observed that AP1-2, STAT 1-6, P-53, LyF-1 (lymphoid transcription factor), c-Jun, PU.1, CREB (cAMP response element-binding), PLAG (pleotropic adenoma gene), MYOD (myoblast determination protein 1), NOFL and KLFS as transcription factors that are selected with preference. Interestingly AP-2, c-Jun, LyF-1, STAT, NF-Y and P53 have also been reported in literature recently as some of the key regulatory elements as well. Based on the fact that interlinking between different interferon stimulation genes (ISGs) is also not very clear and induction of one type of interferon can affect the efficacy of the other, we found that IFN-λ4 induction can increase the expression of IL-28Rα, similar to IFN-λ3 but contrary to type I IFNs, which has either no effect on the expression of IL-28Rα or can down regulate its expression at higher concentrations (data not published). 
Repertoires of proteins and small peptides play numerous physiological roles as hormones, antimicrobial peptides, and cellular signaling factors. The beta-thymosins are a group of small acidic peptides involved in processes such as actin sequestration, neuronal development, wound healing, tissue repair, and angiogenesis. Recent characterization of the beta thymosins as immunological regulators in invertebrates led to our identification and characterization of a beta-thymosin homologue (Tβ) from Haliotis discus discus. The cDNA possessed an ORF of 132 bp encoding a protein of 44 amino acids with a molecular mass of 4977 Da. The amino acid sequence shows high identity with another molluskan beta-thymosin and has a characteristic actin binding motif (LKKTET) and glutamyl donors. Phylogenetic analysis showed a close relationship with molluskan homologues, as well as its distinct identity and common ancestral origin. Genomic analysis revealed a 3 exon-2 intron structure similar to the other homologues. In silico promoter analysis also revealed significant transcription factor binding sites, providing evidence for the expression of this gene under different cellular conditions, including stress or pathogenic attack. Tissue distribution profiling revealed a ubiquitous presence in all the examined tissues, but with the highest expression in mantle and hemocyte. Immune challenge with lipopolysaccharide, poly I:C and Vibrio parahemolyticus induced beta-thymosin expression in gill and hemocytes, affirming an immune-related role in invertebrates.
Ikaros (also known as Lyf-1) was initially described as a lymphoid-specific transcription factor. Although Ikaros has been shown to regulate hematopoietic stem cell renewal, as well as the development and function of cells from multiple hematopoietic lineages, including the myeloid lineage, Ikaros has primarily been studied in context of lymphoid development and malignancy. This review focuses on the role of Ikaros in myeloid cells. We address the importance of post-transcriptional regulation of Ikaros function; the emerging role of Ikaros in myeloid malignancy; Ikaros as a regulator of myeloid differentiation and function; and the selective expression of Ikaros isoform-x in cells with myeloid potential. We highlight the challenges of dissecting Ikaros function in lineage commitment decisions among lymphoid-myeloid progenitors that have emerged as a major myeloid differentiation pathway in recent studies, which leads to reconstruction of the traditional map of murine and human hematopoiesis.
Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) is one of the master transcription factors involved in the stringent regulation of interferon production following virus infection. The aim of our study was to explore new isoforms of IRF-3 and further characterize transcriptional regulation. Two new TSSs of IRF-3 were identified by 5' RACE experiments. The expression profiles of new isoforms were tested using RT-PCR. Additionally, the promoter activity and potential transcription factor binding sites of the promoter regions were analyzed. Here we report two novel spliced variants of IRF-3 starting from intron 2 of the wild type of IRF-3, Int2V1 and Int2V2. We localized the transcription start sites (TSS) in the second intron of IRF-3 in pheochromocytoma tissue and thus identified two distinct transcripts. RT-PCR results showed they were expressed in most of tissues and cell lines tested. The expressions levels of them are varying in different tissues and cells. Furthermore, Int2V2 were expressed higher than Int2V1 in all tissues. Luciferase analysis in Hela and 293T cell line defined the promoter regions of the new transcripts had higher promoter activities. Both of the relative luciferase activities were over 100 times higher than that of pGL3-Basic vector. Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that it contains Sp1, GATA-1/2, IRF-1/2 and Lyf-1 transcription factor binding sites in the promoter regions. The discovery of new transcripts of IRF-3 provides a further insight into the alternative splicing of IRF-3. The novel isoforms expanded the splice variants numbers of IRF-3.
Interferon (IFN)-lambdas, including INF-lambda1, -lambda2, and -lambda3, are a newly described group of cytokines distantly related to the type I IFNs and IL-10 family members. IFN-lambda1, -lambda2, and -lambda3 bind to the same receptor (known as IL28RA) to exert their antiviral, antitumor and immunomodulatory effects. Here, we identified IL28RA genes from the genome of human, chimpanzee, macaque, orangutan, mouse, horse, rat, dog, chicken, and found that only one IL28RA existed in each genome. All the identified IL28RAs are single-pass type I membrane proteins except chicken IL28RA. They belong to the type II cytokine receptor family and contain one fibronectin type-III domain. We found human IL28RA was expressed in lymphs, testes, lymphoma, teratocarcinoma, pediatric pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, germinal center B cells, embryonic stem cells, fetal lung, and also expressed in bladder, blood and breast cancers, glioma, head and neck cancer and lung cancer tissues. Three tumor-related transcriptional factor binding sites (AP-2, c-Jun and P53) were identified within the 1.0-kb regions upstream of the transcriptional start site of human IL28RA. Meta-analysis of the prognostic value of IL28RA genes in various cancers found that the expression of IL28RA was indeed related to the cancer prognosis in certain cancers. The STAT1 binding sites in the promoter region of IL28RA implied a specific mechanism for the amplifying effects of IFN-lambdas. The LyF-1 binding sites in the promoter region of IL28RA imply that IFN-lambdas were involved in the differentiation of early B and T cells.
More than ten bradykinin-related peptides and their cDNAs have been identified from amphibians, but their genes are unknown. In present study, four cDNAs encoding one, two, four and six copies of bradykinin-related peptides were cloned from the frog (Odorrana grahami) skin cDNA library, respectively. Three bradykinin-related peptides (bradykinin, Thr6-bradykinin, Leu5Thr6-bradykinin) were deduced from these four cDNA sequences. Based on the cDNA sequence, the gene sequence encoding an amphibian bradykinin-related peptide from O. grahami was determined. It is composed of 7481 base pairs including two exons and two introns. The first exon codes signal peptide and the second exon codes acidic spacer peptide and Thr6-bradykinin. The promoter region of the bradykinin gene contains several putative recognition sites for nuclear factors, such as SRY, GATA-1, LYF-1, DeltaE, CDXA, NKX-2.5, MIF1 and S8. The current work may facilitate to understand the regulation and possible functions of amphibian skin bradykinin-related peptides.
The expression of glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCP II) is reduced in selective brain regions in schizophrenic patients. To investigate transcriptional mechanisms regulating the human GCP II gene, a 3460 bp DNA fragment comprised of the proximal 3228 bp of 5' untranscribed sequence and first 232 bp of 5' UTR portion of this gene was cloned into the mammalian luciferase reporter gene vector pGL3-Basic. Transfection assays in human astrocyte-derived SVG and human prostate tumor-derived LNCaP cells demonstrated that constructs with 3460, 1590 and 761 bp portions of 5' region of human GCP II gene were able to drive the luciferase reporter gene. Additional deletion constructs showed that in the SVG cell line, constructs with 511 and 411 bp of GCP II gene fragments yielded highest transcriptional activity, with declining activity upon further removal of 5' sequences. 15 bp of the promoter 5' to a 225 bp GCP II fragment were essential for luciferase expression. Thus, in the SVG cells, the proximal 240 bp of the human GCP II promoter (232 bp of the 5' UTR and 8 bp of 5' untranscribed sequences) may represent the core promoter. Further, while a LyF-1 site lies within and overlaps a transcription start site in the 15 bp sequence, site-directed mutagenesis shows that LyF-1 is not the transcription initiator for the "TATA and CAAT" box lacking GCP II gene in the SVG cells. Finally, pattern differences in GCP II gene promoter expression in SVG and LNCaP cells suggest that sequences beyond 240 bp may be important for tissue-specific GCP II expression.
Nuclear receptors (NRs) rely on coregulator proteins to modulate transcription of target genes. NR coregulators can be broadly subdivided into coactivators which potentiate transcription and corepressors which silence gene expression. The prevailing view of coregulator action holds that in the absence of agonist the receptor interacts with a corepressor via the corepressor nuclear receptor (CoRNR, "corner") box motifs within the corepressor. Upon agonist binding, a conformational change in the receptor causes the shedding of corepressor and the binding of a coactivator which interacts with the receptor via NR boxes within the coregulator. This view was challenged with the discovery of RIP140 which acts as a NR corepressor in the presence of agonist and utilizes NR boxes. Since then a number of other corepressors of agonist-bound NRs have been discovered. Among them are LCoR, PRAME, REA, MTA1, NSD1, and COPR1 Although they exhibit a great diversity of structure, mechanism of repression and pathophysiological function, these corepressors frequently have one or more NR boxes and often recruit histone deacetylases to exert their repressive effects. This review highlights these more recently discovered corepressors and addresses their potential functions in transcription regulation, disease pharmacologic responses and xenobiotic metabolism.
To compare responses of a soil bacterium to Cu and Cd.
In minimal medium, Cd caused a dose-dependent growth stasis of logarithmic phase cells of Pseudomonas putida, strain KT2440, whereas Cu did not compromise growth up to 10 mg l(-1). Proteomics showed changes in accumulation of both membrane and soluble proteins by 6 h of treatment; increased Krebs cycle enzymes were apparent. Transcript analysis showed Cd- and Cu-induced different genes. Cd-induced genes encoding the transcriptional regulator CzrR2; an outer membrane protein associated with lipopolysaccharide stability, H1; two oxidative stress protective proteins and the P-type ATPase, CadA2, associated with Cd(2+) efflux. The genes most responsive to Cu encoded the regulator CopR1 and the outer membrane resistance protein regulated by CopR1, CopB1; a putative porin, PorD and the Cu-binding protein, PacZ or CopZ, and CopA2.
These findings support that a soil pseudomonad restricts internalization of the metals by using different sets of binding proteins and efflux pumps. Activation of mechanisms to protect against oxidative stress also was evident especially with Cd exposure.
The differential cellular responses to Cd and Cu suggest that risk assessment for Cd and Cu should be different.
Retinoid acid receptor (RAR)-dependent signalling pathways are essential for the regulation and maintenance of essential biological functions and are recognized targets of disruptive anthropogenic compounds. Recent studies put forward the inability of mollusc RARs to bind and respond to the canonical vertebrate ligand, retinoic acid: a feature that seems to have been lost during evolution. Yet, these studies were carried out in a limited number of molluscs. Therefore, using an in vitro transactivation assay, the present work aimed to characterize phylogenetically relevant mollusc RARs, as monomers or as functional units with RXR, not only in the presence of vertebrate bone fine ligands but also known endocrine disruptors, described to modulate retinoid-dependent pathways. In general, none of the tested mollusc RARs were able to activate reporter gene transcription when exposed to retinoic acid isomers, suggesting that the ability to respond to retinoic acid was lost across molluscs. Similarly, the analysed mollusc RAR were unresponsive towards organochloride pesticides. In contrast, transcriptional repressions were observed with the RAR/RXR unit upon exposure to retinoids or RXR-specific ligands. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations further corroborate the obtained results and suggest that the repressive behaviour, observed with mollusc and human RAR/RXR heterodimers, is possibly mediated by ligand biding to RXR.
Ecdysteroid hormones influence the development and reproduction of arthropods by binding a heterodimeric complex of nuclear receptors, the ecdysone receptor (EcR) and the retinoid-X-receptor/ultraspiracle (RXR/USP). Here, we report on the in vivo role(s) of the ecdysone receptor complex, SchgrEcR/SchgrRXR, in the female reproductive physiology of a major phytophagous pest insect, i.e. the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria. Tissue and temporal distribution profiles were analysed during the first gonadotrophic cycle of adult female locusts. RNA interference was used as a reverse genetics tool to investigate the in vivo role of the ecdysone receptor complex in ovarian maturation, oogenesis, fertility and fecundity. We discovered that silencing the ecdysone receptor complex in S. gregaria resulted in impaired ovulation and oviposition, indicative for a crucial role of this complex in chorion formation. We also found evidence for a feedback of SchgrEcR/SchgrRXR on juvenile hormone biosynthesis by the corpora allata. Furthermore, we observed a tissue-dependent effect of the SchgrEcR/SchgrRXR knockdown on the transcript levels of the insulin receptor and neuroparsin 3 and 4. The insulin receptor transcript levels were upregulated in the brain, but not the fat body and gonads. Neuroparsins 3 and 4 transcript levels were down regulated in the brain and fat body, but not in the gonads.
Retinoid X receptors (RXRs) are members of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily that mediate signalling by 9-cis retinoic acid, a vitamin A derivative. RXRs play key roles not only as homodimers but also as heterodimeric partners, e.g., for retinoic acid receptors, vitamin D receptors, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. The NR family may also play important roles in the development of emphysema. However, the role of RXRs in the pathogenesis of emphysema is not well defined.
We developed a novel RXR partial agonist (NEt-4IB) and investigated its effect and mechanism compared to a full agonist (bexarotene) in a murine model of emphysema. For emphysema induction, BALB/c mice received intraperitoneal cigarette smoke extract (CSE) or intratracheal porcine pancreas elastase (PPE). Treatment with RXR agonists was initiated before or after emphysema induction.
Treatment with NEt-4IB significantly suppressed the increase in static lung compliance and emphysematous changes in CSE-induced emphysema and PPE-induced established and progressive emphysema. NEt-4IB significantly suppressed PPE-induced neutrophilic airway inflammation and the levels of keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC), C-X-C motif ligand5 (CXCL5), interferon (IFN)-γ and IL-17. NEt-4IB also improved the matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)/tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) imbalance and the reduced anti-oxidant activity in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. NEt-4IB suppressed PPE-induced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in the airway. Treatment with NEt-4IB and bexarotene significantly suppressed the increase in static lung compliance and emphysematous changes. However, adverse effects of RXR agonists, including hypertriglyceridemia and hepatomegaly, were observed in bexarotene-treated mice but not in NEt-4IB-treated mice.
These data suggest that RXRs play crucial roles in emphysema and airway inflammation, and novel partial RXR agonists could be potential therapeutic strategies for the treatment of PPE- and CSE-induced emphysema.
Diabetic nephropathy (DN) causes mesangial matrix expansion, which results in glomerulosclerosis and renal failure. Collagen IV (COL4) is a major component of the mesangial matrix that is positively regulated by bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4)/suppressor of mothers against decapentaplegic (Smad1) signaling. Because previous studies showed that retinoids treatment had a beneficial effect on kidney disease, we investigated the therapeutic potential of retinoids in DN, focusing especially on the regulatory mechanism of BMP4. Diabetes was induced with streptozotocin in 12-wk-old male Crl:CD1(ICR) mice, and, 1 mo later, we initiated intraperitoneal injection of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) three times weekly. Glomerular matrix expansion, which was associated with increased BMP4, phosphorylated Smad1, and COL4 expression, worsened in diabetic mice at 24 wk of age. ATRA administration alleviated DN and downregulated BMP4, phosopho-Smad1, and COL4. In cultured mouse mesangial cells, treatment with ATRA or a retinoic acid receptor-α (RARα) agonist significantly decreased BMP4 and COL4 expression. Genomic analysis suggested two putative retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) for the mouse Bmp4 gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and reporter assays indicated a putative RARE of the Bmp4 gene, located 11,488-11,501 bp upstream of exon 1A and bound to RARα and retinoid X receptor (RXR), which suppressed BMP4 expression after ATRA addition. ATRA suppressed BMP4 via binding of a RARα/RXR heterodimer to a unique RARE, alleviating glomerular matrix expansion in diabetic mice. These findings provide a novel regulatory mechanism for treatment of DN.
The delta opioid receptor (DOR), a physiologically relevant prototype for G protein-coupled receptors, is retained in intracellular compartments in neuronal cells. This retention is mediated by a nerve growth factor (NGF)-regulated checkpoint that delays the export of DOR from the trans-Golgi network. How DOR is selectively retained in the Golgi, in the midst of dynamic membrane transport and cargo export, is a fundamental unanswered question. Here we address this by investigating sequence elements on DOR that regulate DOR surface delivery, focusing on the C-terminal tail of DOR that is sufficient for NGF-mediated regulation. By systematic mutational analysis, we define conserved dual bi-arginine (RXR) motifs that are required for NGF- and phosphoinositide-regulated DOR export from intracellular compartments in neuroendocrine cells. These motifs were required to bind the coatomer protein I (COPI) complex, a vesicle coat complex that mediates primarily retrograde cargo traffic in the Golgi. Our results suggest that interactions of DOR with COPI, via atypical COPI motifs on the C-terminal tail, retain DOR in the Golgi. These interactions could provide a point of regulation of DOR export and delivery by extracellular signaling pathways.
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, is an intractable disease of the gastrointestinal tract. Multiple environmental factors, including food ingredients, have been implicated in the development of these diseases. For example, animal fat-rich diets are predisposing factors for ulcerative colitis, whereas n-3 unsaturated fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) show protective effects in experimental colitis and are negatively correlated with the incidence of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Given that DHA exhibits agonistic activity on retinoid X receptor (RXR), activation of RXR could be a therapeutic strategy for IBD. However, conventional full RXR agonists are known to show considerable adverse effects. We therefore took advantage of a partial RXR agonist, CBt-PMN, to minimize the adverse effects, and evaluated its efficacy in dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis. Administration of CBt-PMN efficiently ameliorated the symptoms of colitis. This effect was attributed to the down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Tnf and Il6 in colon-infiltrating monocytes. Down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines by CBt-PMN was also evident in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Among many RXR-associated nuclear receptors, activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ) and nuclear hormone receptor 77 (Nur77) suppressed cytokine production by BMDMs. These observations suggest that the activation of PPARδ/RXR and Nur77/RXR heterodimers by CBt-PMN through the permissive mechanism is responsible for diminishing the monocyte-mediated inflammatory response in the gut. Our data highlight the importance of RXR activation in the regulation of colitis.
Obesity is one of the most important risk factors for chronic metabolic disorders. Molecular mechanisms underlying obesity-related metabolic disorders have not been completely elucidated. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily and are key metabolic regulators of the whole-body energy metabolism. Certain enzymes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism are directly regulated by PPARs via their interaction with specific response elements in their gene promoters. Many food factors act as ligands of PPARs and regulate carbohydrate and lipid metabolism by regulating the activities of these nuclear receptors, leading to the attenuation of obesity-related metabolic disorders. In this review, we describe our current knowledge of the role of PPARs in the regulation of whole-body energy metabolism and several examples of food factors that act as ligands of PPARs, which may be useful in the management of obesity and the accompanying energy metabolism abnormalities. Abbreviations: WAT: white adipose tissue; PPAR: Peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor; RXR: retinoid X receptors; mTORC1: mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1; PPRE: PPAR-responsive regulatory elements; NAFLD: nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; LPL: lipoprotein lipase; FGF21: fibroblast growth factor 21; BAT: brown adipose tissue; UCP1: uncoupling protein 1; LPC(16:0): 1-palmitoyl lysophosphatidylcholine; C/EBP: CCAAT-enhancer binding proteins; STAT5A: signal transduction and activator of transcription 5A; APO apolipoptotein; CBP: cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein; PGC1A: PPARγ coactivator protein 1a; HFD: high-fat diet; TG: triglyceride; VLDL: very low density lipoprotein; HDL: high density lipoprotein.
1-[(3,5,5,8,8-pentamethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-yl)amino]benzotriazole-5-carboxylic acid (CBt-PMN), a partial agonist of retinoid X receptor (RXR), has attracted attention due to its potential to treat type 2 diabetes and central nervous system diseases with reduced adverse effects of existing full agonists. Herein, we report the crystal structure of CBt-PMN-bound ligand-binding domain of human RXRα (hRXRα) and its biochemical characterization. Interestingly, the structure is a tetramer in nature, in which CBt-PMNs are clearly found binding in two different conformations. The dynamics of the hRXRα/CBt-PMN complex examined using molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the flexibility of the AF-2 interface depends on the conformation of the ligand. These facts reveal that the dual conformation of CBt-PMN in the complex is probably the reason behind its partial agonistic activity.
Carotenoids are C-30, C-40 or C-50 terpenoids produced by a number of bacteria, fungi, and plants. In addition to acting as vitamin A precursors such as β-carotene, their dietary intake and blood plasma/serum and tissue levels have been associated in several epidemiological studies to the reduced incidence of chronic diseases, including the reduction of type 2 diabetes and other cardiometabolic diseases, as well as some types of cancer. Lutein and zeaxanthin also appear to play a role in the amelioration of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the main cause of blindness in the elderly, and may be regarded as conditionally essential nutrients for the elderly. Furthermore, some studies have proposed that carotenoids may improve cognitive functions. Though the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated, it is perceived that direct antioxidant effects and protection from UV-light, as well as rather indirect effects, acting on transcription factors such as NF-κB, Nrf-2, and nuclear receptors such as RAR/RXR (retinoic acid receptor/retinoid X receptor), altering gene expression, all can play a role. Despite individual intervention trials suggesting negative effects of high doses of β-carotene on smokers, perhaps due to effects related to cytochrome enzyme activation, there is accumulating evidence that these colourful pigments indeed contribute to a healthy life and well-being. However, further research is warranted to better understand factors influencing variable inter-individual responses following carotenoid consumption and to establish more detailed recommendations regarding their dietary intake and toward establishing health claims.
All trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) is used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and it is a promising agent also in solid tumors. The pharmacological activity of ATRA is mediated by the ligand-activated RAR and RXR transcription factors. In the present study, we define the basal and ATRA dependent RARα interactome in a RARα-overexpressing breast cancer cellular model, identifying 28 nuclear proteins. We focus our attention on the S100A3 calcium-binding protein, which interacts with RARα constitutively. In ATRA-sensitive breast cancer cells, S100A3 binds to RARα in basal conditions and binding is reduced by the retinoid. The interaction of S100A3 with RARα is direct and in lung cancer, APL and acute-myeloid-leukemia (AML) cells. In APL, S100A3 interacts not only with RARα, but also with PML-RARα. The interaction surface maps to the RARα ligand-binding domain, where the I396 residue plays a crucial role. Binding of S100A3 to RARα/PML-RARα controls the constitutive and ATRA-dependent degradation of these receptors. S100A3 knockdown decreases the amounts of RARα in breast- and lung cancer cells, inducing resistance to ATRA-dependent anti-proliferative/differentiating effects. Conversely, S100A3 knockdown in PML-RARα+ APL and PML-RARα- AML cells reduces the amounts of RARα/PML-RARα and increases basal and ATRA-induced differentiation. In this cellular context, opposite effects on RARα/PML-RARα levels and ATRA-induced differentiation are observed upon S100A3 overexpression. Our results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms controlling RARα activity and have practical implications, as S100A3 represents a novel target for rational drug combinations aimed at potentiating the activity of ATRA.
Retinoic acid (RA) promotes differentiation in multiple neurogenic cell types by promoting gene reprogramming through retinoid receptors and also by inducing cytosolic signaling events. The nuclear RXR receptors are one of the main mediators of RA cellular effects, classically by joining the direct receptors of RA, the nuclear RAR receptors, in RAR/RXR dimers which act as transcription factors. Distinct RXR genes lead to RXRα, RXRβ and RXRγ subtypes, but their specific roles in neuronal differentiation remain unclear. We firstly investigated both RXRs and RARs expression profiles during RA-mediated neuronal differentiation of human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y, and found varying levels of retinoid receptors transcript and protein contents along the process. In order to understand the roles of the expression of distinct RXR subtypes to RA signal transduction, we performed siRNA-mediated silencing of RXRα and RXRβ during the first stages of SH-SY5Y differentiation. Our results showed that RXRα is required for RA-induced neuronal differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells, since its silencing compromised cell cycle arrest and prevented the upregulation of neuronal markers and the adoption of neuronal morphology. Besides, silencing of RXRα affected the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. By contrast, silencing of RXRβ improved neurite extension and led to increased expression of tau and synaptophysin, suggesting that RXRβ may negatively regulate neuronal parameters related to neurite outgrowth and function. Our results indicate distinct functions for RXR subtypes during RA-dependent neuronal differentiation and reveal new perspectives for studying such receptors as clinical targets in therapies aiming at restoring neuronal function.
Loss of the gene von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) is associated with loss of primary cilia and is causally linked to elevated levels of Aurora kinase A (AURKA). We developed an image-based high-throughput screening (HTS) assay using a dual-labeling image analysis strategy that identifies both the cilium and the basal body. By using this strategy, we screened small-molecule compounds for the targeted rescue of cilia defects associated with VHL deficiency with high accuracy and reproducibility. Bexarotene was identified and validated as a positive regulator of the primary cilium. Importantly, the inability of an alternative retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist to rescue ciliogenesis, in contrast to bexarotene, suggested that multiple bexarotene-driven mechanisms were responsible for the rescue. We found that bexarotene decreased AURKA expression in VHL-deficient cells, thereby restoring the ability of these cells to ciliate in the absence of VHL Finally, bexarotene treatment reduced the propensity of subcutaneous lesions to develop into tumors in a mouse xenograft model of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), with a concomitant decrease in activated AURKA, highlighting the potential of bexarotene treatment as an intervention strategy in the clinic to manage renal cystogenesis associated with VHL deficiency and elevated AURKA expression.
To assess the effects of marginal vitamin A deficiency (MVAD) on rat Meibomian gland morphology as well as retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) amounts and localization.
Eight adult female rats were randomized into MVAD and vitamin A normal (VAN) groups, and fed vitamin A-deficient and normal control diets, respectively, for 3 weeks before mating. At postnatal week 4 (P4w), eight newborn animals in both groups were euthanized, respectively. Then, serum retinol levels were analyzed. Meibomian glands from P4w animals were further assessed upon hematoxylin and eosin staining. RAR and RXR gene and protein expression amounts were detected by real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), immunofluorescence and western blotting, respectively.
Secretory cell nuclei had reduced areas, while the multilayered squamous epithelium of the ductule was overtly thinner in MVAD rats compared with VAN animals. RXR-α showed highest mRNA amounts among all RA receptors; compared with control values, RXR-α showed overtly decreased mRNA amounts in animals with MVAD. In addition, compared with normal rats, MVAD rats had starkly lower RXR-α and RXR-γ expression levels. Furthermore, only the RXR-α protein was detected in the nucleus of cells forming the multilayered squamous epithelium of the ductule in VAN rats.
RARs and RXRs may be involved in the regulation of Meibomian gland function. RXR-α and 9-cis RA signaling affects Meibomian gland function, and the mechanisms of retinoids on secretory cells and the ductule epithelium may differ.
MVAD: marginal vitamin A deficiency; RAR: retinoic acid receptor; RXR: retinoid X receptor; VAN: vitamin A normal; RA: retinoic acid; RAREs: retinoic acid responsive elements; HPLC: high performance liquid chromatography; atRA: all-trans retinoic acid; MGD: Meibomian gland dysfunction; CRABPs: cellular retinoic acid-binding proteins.
Ampullariidae are unique among gastropods in that females normally show a primordium of the copulatory apparatus (CApp). The aims of this study were (a) to quantitatively evaluate the development and growth of the female CApp with age; (b) to compare the effects of RXR and PPARγ agonists in adult females of known age and (c) to explore the effect of masculinizing RXR agonists on the expression of RXR in the CApp. It was found that the CApp grows and develops with age. A significant increase in penile sheath length (PsL) and also in a developmental index (DI) was observed in 7-8 months old females, as compared with 4-5 months old ones. A reported endogenous agonist of RXR, 9-cis retinoic acid (9cis-RA), as well as two organotin compounds, tributyltin (TBT) and triphenyltin (TPT) which have been also reported to bind to RXR, were injected and its masculinizing effects were measured. Also, the effect of a PPARγ agonist, rosiglitazone, was studied. All studied RXR agonists, but not the PPARγ agonist, were effective in increasing PsL, penile length (PL) and DI. Finally, the expression of the RXR in the CApp was studied (Western blot) in control, TBT, TPT, and 9cis-RA treated females. A significantly increased expression of RXR was only observed after 9cis-RA treatment. It is concluded that (a) development and growth of the CApp is significantly affected by female age; (b) reported RXR agonists, but not a PPARγ agonist, cause female masculinization of young females. An appraisal of previous studies of female masculinization in the Ampullariidae has also been made and it is emphasized that the masculinizing effect of aging should be considered, particularly when interpreting field data.
Retinoid X Receptors (RXRs) act as dimer partners for several nuclear receptors including itself, binding to genomic DNA response elements and regulating gene transcription with cell and gene specificity. As homodimers, RXRs bind direct repeats of the half-site (A/G)G(G/T)TCA separated by 1 nucleotide (DR1) and little variability of this consensus site is observed for natural DR1s. However, these variations are responsible of the modulation of RXR receptors function through differential binding affinity and conformational changes. To further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying RXR-DNA interactions, we examined how RXR DBDs bind to different DR1s using thermodynamics, X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We show that the half-site sequences modulate the binding cooperativity that results from the protein-protein contacts between the two DBDs. Chemical shifts perturbation NMR experiments revealed that sequence variations in half-sites induce changes that propagate from the protein-DNA interface to the dimerization interface throughout the DBD fold.
Tumorigenesis is driven by stem cell (SC) overpopulation. Because ALDH is both a marker for SCs in many tissues and a key enzyme in retinoid acid (RA) signaling, we studied RA signaling in normal and malignant colonic SCs.
RA signaling regulates growth and differentiation of ALDH+ colonic SCs; dysregulation of RA signaling contributes to SC overpopulation and colorectal cancer (CRC) development.
We analyzed normal and malignant colonic tissues and CRC cell lines to see if retinoid receptors (RXR &amp; RAR) are exclusively expressed in ALDH+ SCs, and if RA signaling changes during CRC development. We determined whether RA signaling regulates cancer SC (CSC) proliferation, differentiation, sphere formation, and population size.
RXR &amp; RAR were expressed in ALDH+ colonic SCs, but not in MCM2+ proliferative cells. Western blotting/immunostaining of CRCs revealed that RA signaling components become overexpressed in parallel with ALDH overexpression, which coincides with the known overpopulation of ALDH+ SCs that occurs during, and drives, CRC development. Treatment of SCs with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) decreased proliferation, sphere formation and ALDH+ SC population size, and induced differentiation along the neuroendocrine cell (NEC) lineage.
Retinoid signaling, by regulating ALDH+ colonic CSCs, decreases SC proliferation, sphere formation, and population size, and increases SC differentiation to NECs. Dysregulation of RA signaling in colonic SCs likely contributes to overpopulation of ALDH+ SCs and CRC growth.
That retinoid receptors RXR and RAR are selectively expressed in ALDH+ SCs indicates RA signaling mainly occurs via ALDH+ SCs, which provides a mechanism to selectively target CSCs.
The discovery of novel ligand chemotypes allows to explore uncharted regions in chemical space, thereby potentially improving synthetic accessibility, potency, and the drug-likeness of molecules. Here, we demonstrate the scaffold-hopping ability of the new Weighted Holistic Atom Localization and Entity Shape (WHALES) molecular descriptors compared to seven state-of-the-art molecular representations on 30,000 compounds and 182 biological targets. In a prospective application, we apply WHALES to the discovery of novel retinoid X receptor (RXR) modulators. WHALES descriptors identified four agonists with innovative molecular scaffolds, populating uncharted regions of the chemical space. One of the agonists, possessing a rare non-acidic chemotype, revealed high selectivity on 12 nuclear receptors and comparable efficacy as bexarotene on induction of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1, angiopoietin like protein 4 and apolipoprotein E. The outcome of this research supports WHALES as an innovative tool to explore novel regions of the chemical space and to detect novel bioactive chemotypes by straightforward similarity searching.
Sarcomas are rare and heterogeneous cancer variants of mesenchymal origin. Their genetic heterogeneity coupled with uncertain histogenesis makes them difficult to treat and results in poor prognosis. In this work, we show that structure-based drug discovery involving computational modeling can be used to identify a new retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist ligand with a bis(indolyl)methane scaffold. This agent co-self-assembles with an amphiphilic diblock copolymer resulting in nanoparticles (Nano-RXR) with excellent kinetic stability, which were evaluated for efficacy and safety in transformed sarcoma cells, 63-3 Cre and 141-10 Cre of pig origin, and in rodent xenograft models. Responses at gene and protein levels established the treatment approach as a highly effective RXR agonist across cell, rodent, and "Oncopig" models. Interestingly, Nano-RXR was not only able to modulate metabolic and transporter genes related to orphan nuclear receptors but also played a major role in modulating programmed cell death in sarcomas developed in Oncopigs.
Strobilation is a unique asexual reproduction mode of scyphozoan jellyfish, through which benthic polyp develops into pelagic medusa. It is an orderly metamorphosis process triggered by environmental signals. However, the knowledges of molecular mechanisms under the drastic morphological and physiological changes are still limited. In this study, the transcriptomes from polyps to juvenile medusae at different stages were characterized by RNA-seq in scyphozoan jellyfish Rhopilema esculentum. Among 96,076 de novo assembled unigenes, 7090 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified during the developmental stages. The co-expression pattern analysis of DEGs yielded 15 clusters with different expression patterns. Among them, a cluster with 388 unigenes was related to strobila. In this specific cluster, the GO terms related to "sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor activity" and "sequence-specific DNA binding" were significantly enriched. Transcription factors, including segmentation protein even-skipped-like, segmentation polarity protein engrailed-like, homeobox proteins Otx-like, Twist-like and Cnox2-Pc-like, as well as genes such as RxR-like and Dmrtf-like, were identified to be potentially involved in strobilation. Their expression patterns and the other 11 TFs/genes involved in strobilation were confirmed with qRT-PCR methods. The present study pointed out the role of transcription factors in strobilation and produced a list of novel candidate genes for further studies. It could provide valuable information for understanding the molecular mechanisms of jellyfish strobilation.
The identity of the endogenous RXR ligand has not been conclusively determined, even though several compounds of natural origin, including retinoids and fatty acids, have been postulated to fulfill this role. Filling this gap, 9-cis-13,14-dihydroretinoic acid (9CDHRA) was identified as an endogenous RXR ligand in mice. This review examines the physiological relevance of various potential endogenous RXR ligands, especially 9CDHRA. The elusive steps in the metabolic synthesis of 9CDHRA, as well as the nutritional/nutrimetabolic origin of 9CDHRA, are also explored, along with the suitability of the ligand to be the representative member of a novel vitamin A class (vitamin A5).
Classically, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signals in secreted integral membrane proteins impose the requirement to assemble with other cognate subunits to form functional assemblies before they can exit the ER. We report that GluK5 has two ER retention signals in its cytoplasmic C-terminus: an arginine-based signal and a di-leucine motif previously thought to be an endocytic motif. GluK5 assembles with GluK2, but surprisingly GluK2 association does little to block the ER retention signals. We find instead that the ER retention signals are blocked by two proteins involved in intracellular trafficking, SAP97 and CASK. We show that SAP97, in the presence of CASK and the receptor complex, assumes an extended conformation. In the extended conformation, SAP97 makes its SH3 and GuK domains available to bind and sterically mask the ER retention signals in the GluK5 C-terminus. SAP97 and CASK are also necessary for sorting receptor cargoes into the local dendritic secretory pathway in neurons. We show that the ER retention signals of GluK5 play a vital role in sorting the receptor complex in the local dendritic secretory pathway in neurons. These data suggest a new role for ER retention signals in trafficking integral membrane proteins in neurons. SIGNIFICANCE: We present evidence that the ER retention signals in the kainate receptors containing GluK5 impose a requirement for sorting into local dendritic secretory pathways in neurons, as opposed to traversing the somatic Golgi apparatus. There are two ER retention signals in the C-terminus of GluK5. We show that both are blocked by physical association with SAP97 and CASK. The SH3 and GuK domains of SAP97, in the presence of CASK, bind directly to each ER retention signal and form a complex. These results support an entirely new function for ER retention signals in the C-termini of neuronal receptors, such as NMDA and kainate receptors, and define a mechanism for selective entry of receptors into local secretory pathways.
Asthma is thought to be caused by malfunction of type 2 T helper cell (Th2)-mediated immunity, causing excessive inflammation, mucus overproduction, and apoptosis of airway epithelial cells. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) functions in heme catabolism and is both cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory. We hypothesized that this dual function may be related to asthma's etiology. Using primary airway epithelial cells (pAECs) and an asthma mouse model, we demonstrate that severe lung inflammation is associated with rapid pAEC apoptosis. Surprisingly, NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inhibition, retinoid X receptor (RXR) deficiency, and HO-1 induction were associated with abrogated apoptosis. MCC950, a selective small-molecule inhibitor of canonical and noncanonical NLRP3 activation, reduced RXR expression, leading to decreased pAEC apoptosis that was reversed by the RXR agonist adapalene. Of note, HO-1 induction in a mouse model of ovalbumin-induced eosinophilic asthma suppressed Th2 responses and reduced apoptosis of pulmonary pAECs. In vitro, HO-1 induction desensitized cultured pAECs to ovalbumin-induced apoptosis, confirming the in vivo observations. Critically, the HO-1 products carbon monoxide and bilirubin suppressed the NLRP3-RXR axis in pAECs. Furthermore, HO-1 impaired production of NLRP3-RXR-induced cytokines (interleukin [IL]-25, IL-33, thymic stromal lymphopoietin, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) in pAECs and lungs. Finally, we demonstrate that HO-1 binds to the NACHT domain of NLRP3 and the RXRα and RXRβ subunits and that this binding is not reversed by Sn-protoporphyrin. Our findings indicate that HO-1 and its products are essential for pAEC survival to maintain airway epithelium homeostasis during NLRP3-RXR-mediated apoptosis and inflammation.
Macrophages polarize into distinct phenotypes in response to complex environmental cues. We found that the nuclear receptor PPARγ drove robust phenotypic changes in macrophages upon repeated stimulation with interleukin (IL)-4. The functions of PPARγ on macrophage polarization in this setting were independent of ligand binding. Ligand-insensitive PPARγ bound DNA and recruited the coactivator P300 and the architectural protein RAD21. This established a permissive chromatin environment that conferred transcriptional memory by facilitating the binding of the transcriptional regulator STAT6 and RNA polymerase II, leading to robust production of enhancer and mRNAs upon IL-4 re-stimulation. Ligand-insensitive PPARγ binding controlled the expression of an extracellular matrix remodeling-related gene network in macrophages. Expression of these genes increased during muscle regeneration in a mouse model of injury, and this increase coincided with the detection of IL-4 and PPARγ in the affected tissue. Thus, a predominantly ligand-insensitive PPARγ:RXR cistrome regulates progressive and/or reinforcing macrophage polarization.
In the classical pathway of retinoic acid (RA) mediated gene transcription, RA binds to a nuclear hormone receptor dimer composed of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR), to induce the expression of its downstream target genes. In addition to nuclear receptors, there are other intracellular RA binding proteins such as cellular retinoic acid binding proteins (CRABP1 and CRABP2) and cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, whose contributions to the RA signaling pathway have not been fully understood. The objective of this study was to compare the significance of various RA binding receptors, i.e. CRABP1, CRABP2, CYP and RAR in the RA signaling pathway. In this regard, we developed a mathematical model of the RA pathway, which is one of the few models, if not the only one, that includes all main intracellular RA binding receptors. We then performed a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) to investigate the contribution of the RA receptors to RA-induced mRNA production, when the cells were treated with a wide range of RA levels, from physiological to pharmacological concentrations.
Our results show that CRABP2 and RAR are the most and the least important proteins, respectively, in controlling the model performance at physiological concentrations of RA (1-10 nM). However, at higher concentrations of RA, CYP and RAR are the most sensitive parameters of the system. Furthermore, we found that depending on the concentrations of all RA binding proteins, the rate of metabolism of RA can either change or remain constant following RA therapy. The cellular levels of CRABP1 are more important than that of CRABP2 in controlling RA metabolite formation at pharmacological conditions (RA = 0.1-1 μM). Finally, our results indicate a significant negative correlation between total mRNA production and total RA metabolite formation at pharmacological levels of RA.
Our simulations indicate that the significance of the RA binding proteins in the RA pathway of gene expression strongly depends on intracellular concentration of RA. This study not only can explain why various cell types respond to RA therapy differently, but also can potentially help develop pharmacological methods to increase the efficacy of the drug.
A novel pathway of vitamin D activation by CYP11A has previously been elucidated. To define the mechanism of action of its major dihydroxy-products, we tested the divergence and overlap between the gene expression profiles of human epidermal keratinocytes treated with either CYP11A1-derived 20,23(OH)₂D3 or classical 1,25(OH)₂D3. Both secosteroids have significant chemical similarity with the only differences being the positions of the hydroxyl groups. mRNA was isolated and examined by microarray analysis using Illumina's HumanWG-6 chip/arrays and subsequent bioinformatics analyses. Marked differences in the up- and downregulated genes were observed between 1,25(OH)₂D3- and 20,23(OH)₂D3-treated cells. Hierarchical clustering identified both distinct, opposite and common (overlapping) gene expression patterns. CYP24A1 was a common gene strongly activated by both compounds, a finding confirmed by qPCR. Ingenuity pathway analysis identified VDR/RXR signaling as the top canonical pathway induced by 1,25(OH)₂D3. In contrast, the top canonical pathway induced by 20,23(OH)₂D3 was AhR, with VDR/RXR being the second nuclear receptor signaling pathway identified. QPCR analyses validated the former finding by revealing that 20,23(OH)₂D3 stimulated CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 gene expression, effects located downstream of AhR. Similar stimulation was observed with 20(OH)D3, the precursor to 20,23(OH)₂D3, as well as with its downstream metabolite, 17,20,23(OH)₃D3. Using a Human AhR Reporter Assay System we showed marked activation of AhR activity by 20,23(OH)₂D3, with weaker stimulation by 20(OH)D3. Finally, molecular modeling using an AhR LBD model predicted vitamin D3 hydroxyderivatives to be good ligands for this receptor. Thus, our microarray, qPCR, functional studies and molecular modeling indicate that AhR is the major receptor target for 20,23(OH)₂D3, opening an exciting area of investigation on the interaction of different vitamin D3-hydroxyderivatives with AhR and the subsequent downstream activation of signal transduction pathways in a cell-type-dependent manner.
Carotenoids and retinoids are known to alter the allergic response with important physiological roles in the skin and the immune system. In the human organism various carotenoids are present, some of which are retinoid precursors. The bioactive derivatives of these retinoids are the retinoic acids, which can potently activate nuclear hormone receptors such as the retinoic acid receptor and the retinoid X receptor. In this study, we aimed to assess how plasma carotenoid and retinoid concentrations along with the ratio of their isomers are altered in atopic dermatitis (AD) patients (n = 20) compared to healthy volunteers (HV, n = 20). The study indicated that plasma levels of the carotenoids lutein (HV 198 ± 14 ng/mL, AD 158 ± 12 ng/mL, p = 0.02; all values in mean ± SEM), zeaxanthin (HV 349 ± 30 ng/mL, AD 236 ± 18 ng/mL, p ≤ 0.01), as well as the retinoids retinol (HV 216 ± 20 ng/mL, AD 167 ± 17 ng/mL, p = 0.04) and all-trans-retinoic acid (HV 1.1 ± 0.1 ng/mL, AD 0.7 ± 0.1 ng/mL, p = 0.04) were significantly lower in the AD-patients, while lycopene isomers, α-carotene, and β-carotene levels were comparable to that determined in the healthy volunteers. In addition, the ratios of 13-cis- vs. all-trans-lycopene (HV 0.31 ± 0.01, AD 0.45 ± 0.07, p = 0.03) as well as 13-cis- vs. all-trans-retinoic acid (HV 1.4 ± 0.2, AD 2.6 ± 0.6, p = 0.03) were increased in the plasma of AD-patients indicating an AD-specific 13-cis-isomerisation. A positive correlation with SCORAD was calculated with 13-cis- vs. all-trans-lycopene ratio (r = 0.40, p = 0.01), while a negative correlation was observed with zeaxanthin plasma levels (r = -0.42, p = 0.01). Based on our results, we conclude that in the plasma of AD-patients various carotenoids and retinoids are present at lower concentrations, while the ratio of selected lycopene isomers also differed in the AD-patient group. An increase in plasma isomers of both lycopene and retinoic acid may cause an altered activation of nuclear hormone receptor signaling pathways and thus may be partly responsible for the AD-phenotype.
Nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) functions as the major bile acid sensor coordinating cholesterol metabolism, lipid homeostasis, and absorption of dietary fats and vitamins. Because of its central role in metabolism, FXR represents an important drug target to manage metabolic and other diseases, such as primary biliary cirrhosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. FXR and nuclear receptor retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) form a heterodimer that controls the expression of numerous downstream genes. To date, the structural basis and functional consequences of the FXR/RXR heterodimer interaction have remained unclear. Herein, we present the crystal structures of the heterodimeric complex formed between the ligand-binding domains of human FXR and RXRα. We show that both FXR and RXR bind to the transcriptional coregulator steroid receptor coactivator 1 with higher affinity when they are part of the heterodimer complex than when they are in their respective monomeric states. Furthermore, structural comparisons of the FXR/RXRα heterodimers and the FXR monomers bound with different ligands indicated that both heterodimerization and ligand binding induce conformational changes in the C terminus of helix 11 in FXR that affect the stability of the coactivator binding surface and the coactivator binding in FXR. In summary, our findings shed light on the allosteric signal transduction in the FXR/RXR heterodimer, which may be utilized for future drug development targeting FXR.
The availability of a reference genome assembly for Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, SNP genotyping platforms and low cost sequencing are enhancing the understanding of both life history and production-related traits in this important commercial species. We collected and analyzed transcriptomes from selected tissues of Atlantic salmon to inform future functional and comparative genomics studies. Messenger RNA (mRNA) was isolated from pituitary gland, brain, ovary, and liver before Illumina sequencing produced a total of 640 million 150-bp paired-end reads. Following read mapping, feature counting, and normalization, cluster analysis identified genes highly expressed in a tissue-specific manner. We identified a cluster of 508 tissue specific genes for pituitary gland, 3395 for brain, 2939 for ovary, and 539 for liver. Functional profiling identified gene clusters describing the unique functions of each tissue. Moreover, highly-expressed transcription factors (TFs) present in each tissue-specific gene cluster were identified. TFs belonging to homeobox and bhlh families were identified for pituitary gland, pou and zf-c2h2 families for brain, arid, and zf-c2h2 for ovary and rxr-like family for liver. The data and analysis presented are relevant to the emerging Functional Annotation of All Salmonid Genomes (FAASG) initiative that is seeking to develop a detailed understanding of both salmonid evolution and the genomic elements that drive gene expression and regulation.
Several feeding trials with Atlantic salmon fed naturally high phytosterol concentrations due to dietary rapeseed oil inclusion have shown changes in lipid metabolism and increased hepatic lipid storage in the fish. An in vitro trial with Atlantic salmon hepatocytes was, therefore, performed to study the possible direct effects of phytosterols on lipid storage and metabolism. The isolated hepatocytes were exposed to seven different sterol treatments and gene expression, as well as lipid accumulation by Oil Red O dyeing, was assessed. Fucosterol, a sterol found in many algae species, had an effect on the size of individual lipid droplets, leading to smaller lipid droplets than in the control without added sterols. A sterol extract from soybean/rapeseed led to an increase in the percentage of hepatocytes with visible lipid droplets at 20× magnification, while hepatocytes of both the sterol extract-treated groups and fucosterol-treated groups had a larger proportion of their area covered with lipids compared to control cells. Brassicasterol, a sterol characteristic of rapeseed oil, was the only sterol treatment leading to a change in gene expression, affecting the expression of the nuclear receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (pparg) and retinoid X receptor (rxr). The current study thus shows that phytosterols can have direct, although subtle, effects on both hepatic lipid storage and gene expression of Atlantic salmon in vitro.
We evaluated the potential of retinol and retinoic acid (RA) to enhance intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels in a murine cultured macrophage cell line, RAW264, to investigate whether the RA signaling pathway is involved in the β-carotene-induced GSH enhancement.
We examined GSH levels in RAW264 cells cultured in media supplemented with β-carotene and various inhibitors (ER50891 for RA receptor (RAR)α, CD2665 for RARβ/γ, or HX531 for all subtypes of retinoid X receptor (RXR)), to verify each inhibitor's activity against β-carotene, as well as in media supplemented with various stimulants (AM80 for RARα, CD2314 for RARβ, CD437 for RARγ, or SR11237 for RXR), to compare their activity with that of β-carotene. We also examined the GSH level and glutamate-cysteine-ligase (GCL) expression in RAW264 cells cultured in all-trans RA- or retinol-supplemented media. Enhanced GSH production was not inhibited by any tested antagonist, and, apart from β-carotene, no agonist induced GSH production. Retinol, but not all-trans RA, enhanced GSH synthesis and increased GCL expression, similar to that observed with β-carotene.
The RA signaling pathway may not be involved in the β-carotene-induced enhancement of GSH levels in RAW264 cells, whereas, like β-carotene, retinol can enhance the GSH level and GCL expression.
Adipocyte is an important place for lipid storage. Defects in lipid storage in adipocytes can lead to lipodystrophy and lipid accumulation in muscle, liver, and other organs. It is the condition of mixed dyslipidemia which may favor the development of insulin resistance via lipotoxic mechanisms. Our objective of the study was to investigate the potential role of R-limonene (LM) on differentiation, lipid storage, and 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) uptake in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Genes and proteins associated with differentiation, lipid accumulation, 2DG uptake and its signaling pathways in the adipocytes were analyzed using qPCR and western blot methods. LM treatment increased differentiation, lipid accumulation, and the expression of adipogenic and lipogenic markers such as C/EBP-α, C/EBP-β, PPARγ, SREBP-1, RXR, FAS, and adiponectin. However, the LM concentration at 10μM decreased (p &lt; 0.05) adipogenesis and lipogenesis via regulating key transcriptional factors. LM treatment increased activation of Akt by increasing its phosphorylation, but p44/42 activation was not altered. MK-2206, an Akt specific inhibitor, reduced the activation of Akt phosphorylation whereas LM treatment aborted the MK-2206 mediated inhibition of Akt activation. LM enhanced glucose uptake in differentiated adipocytes. Overall data suggested that LM treatment favored lipid storage and glucose uptake in adipocytes via activation of key transcriptional factors through activation of Akt phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.
Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) are tightly regulated by the corepressors nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) and silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors. Three conserved corepressor/NR signature box motifs (CoRNR1-3) forming the nuclear receptor interaction domain have been identified in these corepressors. Whereas TRs regulate multiple normal physiological and developmental pathways, mutations in TRs can result in endocrine diseases and be associated with cancers due to impairment of corepressor release. Three mutants that are located in helix H11 of TRs are of special interest: TRα-M388I, a mutant associated with the development of renal clear cell carcinomas (RCCCs), and TRβ-Δ430 and TRβ-Δ432, two deletion mutants causing resistance to thyroid hormone syndrome.
Several cell-based and biophysical methods were used to measure the affinity between wild-type and mutant TRα and TRβ and all the CoRNR motifs from corepressors to quantify the effects of different thyroid hormone analogues on these interactions. This study was coupled with the measurement of interactions between wild-type and mutant TRs in the context of a heterodimer with RXR to a NCoR fragment in the presence of the same ligands. Structural insights into the binding mode of corepressors to TRs were assessed in parallel by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
The study shows that TRs interact more avidly with the silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors than with NCoR peptides, and that TRα binds most avidly to S-CoRNR3, whereas TRβ binds preferentially to S-CoRNR2. In the studied TR mutants, a transfer of the CoRNR-specificity toward CoRNR1 was observed, coupled with a significant increase in the binding strength. In contrast to 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3), the agonist TRIAC and the antagonist NH-3 were very efficient at dissociating the abnormally strong interactions between mutant TRβs and corepressors. A strong impairment of T3-binding for TRβ mutants was shown compared to TRIAC and NH-3 and could explain the different efficiencies of the different ligands in releasing corepressors from the studied TRβ mutants. Consequently, TRIAC was found to be more effective than T3 in facilitating coactivator recruitment and decreasing the dominant activity of TRβ-Δ430.
This study helps to clarify the specific interaction surfaces involved in the pathologic phenotype of TR mutants and demonstrates that TRIAC is a potential therapeutic agent for patients suffering from resistance to thyroid hormone syndromes.
All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is an effective drug for the induction therapy of acute promyelocytic leukemia. However, the treatment is associated with adverse events such as retinoic acid syndrome (RAS) in some patients, whose histologic characteristics included organ infiltration by leukemic cells. Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) is often upregulated in tumor cells and plays a role in tumor cell migration and invasion by degrading the extracellular matrix. In this study, we examined the possible modulatory effects of ATRA on MMP-2 expression and secretion in human myeloid leukemia cell line THP-1. The cells were treated with various concentrations of ATRA, and MMP-2 expression and secretion were examined. MMP-2 expression and secretion started to increase with ATRA concentration as low as 0.1 nM and gradually increased thereafter. Agonists of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) or retinoid X receptor (RXR) alone could enhance MMP-2 secretion, and RAR or RXR antagonists alone could reverse ATRA-induced MMP-2 secretion. ATRA increased intracellular calcium ion levels, and a calcium-channel blocker inhibited ATRA-induced MMP-2 secretion. Dexamethasone suppressed ATRA-induced MMP-2 secretion. Our results suggest that ATRA enhances MMP-2 expression and secretion in human myeloid leukemia THP-1 cells in a calcium ion dependent manner through RAR/RXR signaling pathways, and this enhanced expression and secretion may be associated with the possible mechanisms of RAS.
Vitamin D is a precursor for secosteroidal hormones, which demonstrate pleiotropic biological activities, including the regulation of growth and the differentiation of normal and malignant cells. Our previous studies have indicated that the inhibition of melanoma proliferation by a short side-chain, low calcemic analog of vitamin D-21(OH)pD is not fully dependent on the expression of vitamin D receptor (VDR). We have examined the effects of classic vitamin D metabolites, 1,25(OH)₂D₃ and 25(OH)D₃, and two low calcemic vitamin D analogs, (21(OH)pD and calcipotriol), on proliferation, mRNA expression and vitamin D receptor (VDR) translocation in three human melanoma cell lines: WM98, A375 and SK-MEL-188b (subline b of SK-MEL-188, which lost responsiveness to 1,25(OH)₂D₃ and became VDR-/-CYP27B1-/-). All tested compounds efficiently inhibited the proliferation of WM98 and A375 melanoma cells except SK-MEL-188b, in which only the short side-chain vitamin D analog-21(OH)pD was effective. Overall, 21(OH)pD was the most potent compound in all three melanoma cell lines in the study. The lack of responsiveness of SK-MEL-188b to 1,25(OH)₂D₃, 25(OH)D₃ and calcipotriol is explained by a lack of characteristic transcripts for the VDR, its splicing variants as well as for vitamin D-activating enzyme CYP27B1. On the other hand, the expression of VDR and its splicing variants and other vitamin D related genes (RXR, PDIA3, CYP3A4, CYP2R1, CYP27B1, CYP24A1 and CYP11A1) was detected in WM98 and A375 melanomas with the transcript levels being modulated by vitamin D analogs. The expression of VDR isoforms in WM98 cells was stimulated strongly by calcipotriol. The antiproliferative activities of 21(OH)pD appear not to require VDR translocation to the nucleus, which explains the high efficacy of this noncalcemic pregnacalciferol analog in SK-MEL-188b melanoma, that is, VDR-/-. Therefore, we propose that 21(OH)pD is a good candidate for melanoma therapy, although the mechanism of its action remains to be defined.
The vitamin A derivative 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA) has been used for the treatment and prevention of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). However, the precise mechanism by which 9-cis-RA treatment ameliorates CTCL remains elusive. Our research shows that 9-cis-RA inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in CTCL cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. 9-Cis-RA also induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest by downregulation of cyclin D1. We confirmed that 9-cis-RA significantly decreased phosphorylation of JAK1, STAT3, and STAT5 and downregulated Bcl-xL and cyclin D1, indicating that 9-cis-RA inhibited the activation of JAK/STAT signaling. Meanwhile, 9-cis-RA also activated classical RA-mediated transcription by retinoic acid receptors (RAR) and/or retinoid X receptors (RXR) in a CTCL cell line. Thus, 9-cis-RA may be effective for chemotherapy and may prevent human CTCL by inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis by inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway and activation of the RAR/RXR pathway.
The Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI; Morey, 1991) contains scales that were designed to make predictions about how an individual might respond to treatment, thereby allowing clinicians to attune treatment plans to a client's specific needs. The present study utilized two features of the PAI as predictors of treatment process and outcome in a sample of 47 outpatient veterans: the Treatment Rejection (RXR) scale and the Treatment Process Index (TPI). Data were collected for three treatment process and outcome measures: treatment utilization (ratio of appointments attended to appointments scheduled), therapist-rated therapeutic alliance, and symptom change over time. Results indicated that RXR significantly predicted utilization over and above the TPI. The TPI significantly predicted the rate of distress symptom decline over time, but RXR did not. Lastly, neither RXR nor the TPI were significant predictors of therapist-rated alliance.
Malignant melanoma was the leading cause of mortality among the skin-associated cancer owing to its highly metastatic feature, increasing incidence and drug resistance requirement. Retinoids played important roles in the treatment of cancer via the activation of retinoid acid receptor (RAR) or retinoid X receptor (RXR). Our present study showed that the third-generation retinoid adapalene exhibited strong inhibitory effects on the proliferation of melanoma cells than other retinoids, such as all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), isotretinoin, acitretin and bexarotene, and adapalene exerted significant inhibitory effects on the colony formation of melanoma cells. Further study confirmed that adapalene treatment triggered dramatic S phase arrest and apoptosis, and S phase arrest was the potential mechanism of apoptosis induction. In addition, adapalene treatment dramatically regulated the expression of S phase-related protein, and increased the protein level of DNA damage marker，which were consistent with the results of the induction of the tail moment in comet assays. Meanwhile, DNA damage response was activated and the DNA repair pathway was simultaneously inhibited by adapalene treatment, which might furtherly potentiate S phase arrest and subsequent apoptosis. Taken together, these results showed that adapalene exhibited strong anti-cancer activity, and might be a candidate agent for the clinical treatment of melanoma.
Tumor-stromal communication within the microenvironment contributes to initiation of metastasis and may present a therapeutic opportunity. Using serial single-cell RNA sequencing in an orthotopic mouse prostate cancer model, we find up-regulation of prolactin receptor as cancer cells that have disseminated to the lungs expand into micrometastases. Secretion of the ligand prolactin by adjacent lung stromal cells is induced by tumor cell production of the COX-2 synthetic product prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). PGE2 treatment of fibroblasts activates the orphan nuclear receptor NR4A (Nur77), with prolactin as a major transcriptional target for the NR4A-retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimer. Ectopic expression of prolactin receptor in mouse cancer cells enhances micrometastasis, while treatment with the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib abrogates prolactin secretion by fibroblasts and reduces tumor initiation. Across multiple human cancers, COX-2, prolactin, and prolactin receptor show consistent differential expression in tumor and stromal compartments. Such paracrine cross-talk may thus contribute to the documented efficacy of COX-2 inhibitors in cancer suppression.
Human and veterinary pharmaceuticals have been observed in natural aquatic environments around the world, and many have been shown to impact fish health. Presently, we examined the influence of pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and Na+ or Ca2+ on the bioavailability and toxicity of waterborne pharmaceuticals in larval zebrafish. Drugs included sertraline (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor; SSRI), fluoxetine (SSRI), diclofenac (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) and ethinyl estradiol (estrogen; EE2). The 96 h-LC50s for sertraline, fluoxetine and diclofenac were influenced by pH over an environmentally relevant range (pH 5.8-8.2). Toxicity was related to the predicted concentration of non-ionized compounds, which more readily cross cell membranes than ionized compounds. For example, sertraline was 4.1-fold more toxic (as measured by 96 h-LC50s) at pH 8.2 compared to pH 5.8, while the predicted amount of non-ionized sertraline was also greater at pH 8.2 (based on previously reported pKa values). Experiments with radiolabelled drugs demonstrated that sertraline uptake was also 5.4-fold higher at pH 8.2 compared to pH 5.8. Terrigenous and autochthonous DOC samples (as low as 1 mg/L) protected against sertraline uptake and toxicity, although they were more effective at lower (environmentally relevant) drug concentrations. In contrast, the uptake of EE2, which was principally non-ionized in all water chemistries tested, was not altered by pH or DOC. There was no change in sertraline toxicity with the addition of 12 mM Na+ or 3 mM Ca2+. In conclusion, the influence of pH and DOC on drug uptake and toxicity in fish appears to be predictable based on the physicochemical properties of the drug (e.g. pKa, polar surface area). The influence of water chemistry on drug bioavailability in fish is likely relevant to all aquatic life.
Recent discovery of potent antibacterial antisense PNA-peptide conjugates encouraged development of a fast and efficient synthesis protocol that facilitates structure-activity studies. The use of an Fmoc/Boc protection scheme for both PNA monomers and amino acid building blocks in combination with microwave-assisted solid-phase synthesis proved to be a convenient procedure for continuous assembly of antisense PNA-peptide conjugates. A validated antisense PNA oligomer (CTCATACTCT; targeting mRNA of the acpP gene) was linked to N-terminally modified drosocin (i.e., RXR-PRPYSPRPTSHPRPIRV; X = aminohexanoic acid) or to a truncated Pip1 peptide (i.e., RXRRXR-IKILFQNRRMKWKK; X = aminohexanoic acid), and determination of the antibacterial effects of the resulting conjugates allowed assessment of the influence of different linkers as well as differences between the L- and D-forms of the peptides. The drosocin-derived compound without a linker moiety exhibited highest antibacterial activity against both wild-type Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (MICs in the range 2-4 μg/mL ∼ 0.3-0.7 μM), while analogues displaying an ethylene glycol (eg1) moiety or a polar maleimide linker also possessed activity toward wild-type K. pneumoniae (MICs of 4-8 μg/mL ∼ 0.6-1.3 μM). Against two colistin-resistant E. coli strains the linker-deficient compound proved most potent (with MICs in the range 2-4 μg/mL ∼ 0.3-0.7 μM). The truncated all-L Pip1 peptide had moderate inherent activity against E. coli, and this was unaltered or reduced upon conjugation to the antisense PNA oligomer. By contrast, this peptide was 8-fold less potent against K. pneumoniae, but in this case some PNA-peptide conjugates exhibited potent antisense activity (MICs of 2-8 μg/mL ∼ 0.3-1.2 μM). Most interestingly, the antibacterial activity of the D-form peptide itself was 2- to 16-fold higher than that of the L-form, even for the colistin- and tigecycline-resistant E. coli strains (MIC of 1-2 μg/mL ∼ 0.25-0.5 μM). Low activity was found for conjugates with a two-mismatch PNA sequence corroborating an antisense mode of action. Conjugates containing a D-form peptide were also significantly less active. In conclusion, we have designed and synthesized antisense PNA-drosocin conjugates with potent antibacterial activity against colistin- and tigecycline-resistant E. coli and K. pneumonia without concomitant hemolytic properties. In addition, a truncated D-form of Pip1 was identified as a peptide exhibiting potent activity against both wild-type and multidrug-resistant E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii (MICs within the range 1-4 μg/mL ∼ 0.25-1 μM) as well as toward wild-type Staphylococcus aureus (MIC of 2-4 μg/mL ∼ 0.5-1.0 μM).
Trialkyltins and triaryltins function as nuclear retinoid X receptors (RXR) agonists due to their affinity to the ligand-binding domain of RXR subtypes and function as transcriptional activators. We present the data on combined effects of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), retinoic acid receptor (RAR) ligand and tributyltin chloride or triphenyltin chloride (RXR ligands) on protein pattern in MDA-MB-231 cells. Proteomic strategies based on bottom-up method were applied in this study. The total cell proteins were extracted, separated on 2D SDS-PAGE and their characterization was achieved by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS/MS. By employing PDQuest™ software, we identified more than 30 proteins differently affected by the above compounds. For further studies, we selected specific proteins associated either with metabolic pathway (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) or to cellular processes as apoptosis, regulation of gene transcription or epithelial-mesenchymal transition (annexin 5, nucleoside diphosphate kinase B and vimentin). We have found that treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with triorganotins reduced the expression of studied proteins. Moreover, the treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with triorganotin compounds together with ATRA resulted in an additional reduction of annexin 5, vimentin and nucleoside diphosphate kinase B. These results demonstrate that RXR/RAR heterodimer may act under this experimental design as permissive heterodimer allowing activation of RXR by triorganotins.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a life-threatening subtype of stroke with high mortality and disabilities. Retinoid X receptor (RXR) has been shown to be neuroprotective against ischemia/reperfusion injury. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the selective RXR agonist bexarotene on neuroinflammation in a rat model of SAH.
Two hundred male Sprague-Dawley rats were used. The endovascular perforation induced SAH. Bexarotene was administered intraperitoneally at 1 h after SAH induction. To investigate the underlying mechanism, the selective RXR antagonist UVI3003 and RXR siRNA or SIRT6 inhibitor OSS128167 was administered via intracerebroventricular 1 h before SAH induction. Post-SAH assessments including SAH grade, neurological score, brain water content, Western blot, and immunofluorescence were performed.
The endogenous RXR and sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) protein levels were increased after SAH. Bexarotene treatment significantly reduced brain edema and improved the short-/long-term neurological deficit after SAH. Mechanistically, bexarotene increased the levels of PPARγ and SIRT6; decreased the expression of phosphorylated FoxO3a (p-FoxO3a), IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-a; and inhibited the microglia activation and neutrophils infiltration at 24 h after SAH. Either UVI3003, OSS128167, or RXR siRNA abolished the neuroprotective effects of bexarotene and its regulation on protein levels of PPARγ/SIRT6/p-FoxO3a after SAH.
The activation of RXR by bexarotene attenuated neuroinflammation and improved neurological deficits after SAH. The anti-neuroinflammatory effect was at least partially through regulating PPARγ/SIRT6/FoxO3a pathway. Bexarotene may be a promising therapeutic strategy in the management of SAH patients.
As universal heterodimer partners of many nuclear receptors, the retinoid X receptors (RXRs) constitute key transcription factors. They regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, inflammation, and metabolic homeostasis and have recently been proposed as potential drug targets for neurodegenerative and inflammatory diseases. Owing to the hydrophobic nature of RXR ligand binding sites, available synthetic RXR ligands are lipophilic, and their structural diversity is limited. Here, we disclose the computer-assisted discovery of a novel RXR agonist chemotype and its systematic optimization toward potent RXR modulators. We have developed a nanomolar RXR agonist with high selectivity among nuclear receptors and superior physicochemical properties compared to classical rexinoids that appears suitable for in vivo applications and as lead for future RXR-targeting medicinal chemistry.
Rexinoids, selective ligands for retinoid X receptors (RXR), have shown promise in preventing many types of cancer. However, the limited efficacy and undesirable lipidemic side-effects of the only clinically approved rexinoid, bexarotene, drive the search for new and better rexinoids. Here we report the evaluation of novel pyrimidinyl (Py) analogues of two known chemopreventive rexinoids, bexarotene (Bex) and LG100268 (LG268) in a new paradigm. We show that these novel derivatives were more effective agents than bexarotene for preventing lung carcinogenesis induced by a carcinogen. In addition, these new analogues have an improved safety profile. PyBex caused less elevation of plasma triglyceride levels than bexarotene, while PyLG268 reduced plasma cholesterol levels and hepatomegaly compared with LG100268. Notably, this new paradigm mechanistically emphasizes the immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities of rexinoids. We reveal new immunomodulatory actions of the above rexinoids, especially their ability to diminish the percentage of macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the lung and to redirect activation of M2 macrophages. The rexinoids also potently inhibit critical inflammatory mediators including IL6, IL1β, CCL9, and nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) induced by lipopolysaccharide. Moreover, in vitro iNOS and SREBP (sterol regulatory element-binding protein) induction assays correlate with in vivo efficacy and toxicity, respectively. Our results not only report novel pyrimidine derivatives of existing rexinoids, but also describe a series of biological screening assays that will guide the synthesis of additional rexinoids. Further progress in rexinoid synthesis, potency, and safety should eventually lead to a clinically acceptable and useful new drug for patients with cancer.
Retinoid X receptors (RXRs) belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily, and upon ligand activation, these receptors control gene transcription via either homodimerization with themselves or heterodimerization with the partner-nuclear receptor. The protective effects of RXRs and RXR agonists have been reported in several neurodegenerative diseases, including in the retina. This study was aimed to prioritize compounds from natural and synthetic origin retinoids as potential RXR agonists by molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation strategies. The docking studies indicated bexarotene as a lead compound that can activate various RXR receptor isoforms (α, β, and γ) and has a strong binding affinity to the receptor protein than retinoic acid, which is known as a natural endogenous RXR agonist. Dynamic simulation studies confirmed that the hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions were highly stable in all the three isoforms of the RXR-bexarotene complex. To further validate the significance of the RXR receptor in neurons, in vitro pharmacological treatment of neuronal SH-SY5Y cells with bexarotene was performed. In vitro data from SH-SY5Y cells confirmed that bexarotene activated RXR-simulated neurite outgrowth significantly. We conclude that bexarotene could be potentially used as an exogenous activator of RXRs and emerge as a good drug target for several neurodegenerative disorders.
Gene expression profiling is a useful tool to predict and interrogate mechanisms of toxicity. RNA-Seq technology has emerged as an attractive alternative to traditional microarray platforms for conducting transcriptional profiling. The objective of this work was to compare both transcriptomic platforms to determine whether RNA-Seq offered significant advantages over microarrays for toxicogenomic studies. RNA samples from the livers of rats treated for 5 days with five tool hepatotoxicants (α-naphthylisothiocyanate/ANIT, carbon tetrachloride/CCl4, methylenedianiline/MDA, acetaminophen/APAP, and diclofenac/DCLF) were analyzed with both gene expression platforms (RNA-Seq and microarray). Data were compared to determine any potential added scientific (i.e., better biological or toxicological insight) value offered by RNA-Seq compared to microarrays. RNA-Seq identified more differentially expressed protein-coding genes and provided a wider quantitative range of expression level changes when compared to microarrays. Both platforms identified a larger number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in livers of rats treated with ANIT, MDA, and CCl4 compared to APAP and DCLF, in agreement with the severity of histopathological findings. Approximately 78% of DEGs identified with microarrays overlapped with RNA-Seq data, with a Spearman's correlation of 0.7 to 0.83. Consistent with the mechanisms of toxicity of ANIT, APAP, MDA and CCl4, both platforms identified dysregulation of liver relevant pathways such as Nrf2, cholesterol biosynthesis, eiF2, hepatic cholestasis, glutathione and LPS/IL-1 mediated RXR inhibition. RNA-Seq data showed additional DEGs that not only significantly enriched these pathways, but also suggested modulation of additional liver relevant pathways. In addition, RNA-Seq enabled the identification of non-coding DEGs that offer a potential for improved mechanistic clarity. Overall, these results indicate that RNA-Seq is an acceptable alternative platform to microarrays for rat toxicogenomic studies with several advantages. Because of its wider dynamic range as well as its ability to identify a larger number of DEGs, RNA-Seq may generate more insight into mechanisms of toxicity. However, more extensive reference data will be necessary to fully leverage these additional RNA-Seq data, especially for non-coding sequences.
The retinoic X receptor (RXR) plays a crucial role in the superfamily of nuclear receptors (NRs) by acting as an obligatory partner of several nuclear receptors; its role as a transcription factor is thus critical in many signalling pathways, such as metabolism, cell development, differentiation and cellular death. The first published structure of the apo ligand-binding domain (LBD) of RXRα, which is still used as a reference today, contained inaccuracies. In the present work, these inaccuracies were corrected using modern crystallographic tools. The most important correction concerns the presence of a π-bulge in helix H7, which was originally built as a regular α-helix. The presence of several CHAPS molecules, which are visible for the first time in the electron-density map and which stabilize the H1-H3 loop, which contains helix H2, are also revealed. The apo RXR structure has played an essential role in deciphering the molecular mode of action of NR ligands and is still used in numerous biophysical studies. This refined structure should be used preferentially in the future in interpreting experiments as well as for modelling and structural dynamics studies of the apo RXRα LBD.
The possibility that a wide variety of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and their derivatives are present in the environment necessitates detailed evaluation of their toxicities. A number of PCBs and monohydroxylated PCBs (OH-PCBs) have been reported to have affinities for several nuclear receptors, and some of these compounds have been shown to have harmful effects in animals. In this study, we focused on the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and the retinoic acid receptor (RAR), which play critical roles in development and homeostasis. Specifically, we measured the agonistic activities of 91 OH-PCBs on these receptors by using yeast cells transfected with human RXRβ or RARγ. Of the tested OH-PCBs, 20 exhibited agonistic activity on RXRβ and 35 on RARγ, although their activities were lower than those of the respective endogenous ligands. Most of the OH-PCBs that showed potent activity on RXRβ were tri- or tetrachlorinated compounds, whereas most of the active compounds on RARγ were di-, tri-, or tetrachlorinated compounds. The optimal position for the hydroxyl group relative to the bond linking the aromatic rings was ortho for RXRβ and meta for RARγ. The activities of the OH-PCBs on RXRβ depended strongly on the position of the hydroxyl group, whereas those on RARγ did not. Taken together with the results of our previous studies of compounds with effects on other nuclear receptors, these results provide critical information for further research on receptor-mediated toxicity, endocrine-disrupting effects, and structure-activity relationships.
Retinoid X receptors (RXRs) play an important role in transcription, are involved in numerous cellular networks from cell proliferation to lipid metabolism and are essential for normal eye development. RXRs form homo or heterodimers with other nuclear receptors, bind to DNA response elements and regulate several biological processes including neurogenesis. Mounting evidence suggests that RXR activation by selective RXR modulators (sRXRms) may be neuroprotective in the central nervous system. However, their potential neuroprotective role in the retina and specifically in glaucoma remains unexplored. This study investigated changes in RXR expression in the human and mouse retina under glaucomatous stress conditions and investigated the effect of RXR modulation on the RGCs using pharmacological approaches. RXR protein levels in retina were downregulated in both human glaucoma and experimental RGC injury models while RXR agonist, bexarotene treatment resulted in upregulation of RXR expression particularly in the inner retinal layers. Retinal electrophysiological recordings and histological analysis indicated that inner retinal function and retinal laminar structure were preserved upon treatment with bexarotene. These protective effects were associated with downregulation of ER stress marker response upon bexarotene treatment under glaucoma conditions. Overall, retinal RXR modulation by bexarotene significantly protected RGCs in vivo in both acute and chronic glaucoma models.
The fatty acid sensing nuclear receptor families retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) hold therapeutic potential in neurodegeneration. Valuable pleiotropic activities of Wy14,643 in models of such conditions exceed its known PPAR agonistic profile. Here, we characterize the compound as an RXR agonist explaining the pleiotropic effects and report its systematic structure-activity relationship analysis with the discovery of specific molecular determinants driving activity on PPARs and RXRs. We have designed close analogues of the drug comprising selective and dual agonism on RXRs and PPARs that may serve as superior pharmacological tools to study the role and interplay of the nuclear receptors in various pathologies. A systematically optimized high potency RXR agonist revealed activity in vivo and active concentrations in brain. With its lack of RXR/liver X receptor-mediated side effects and superior profile compared to classical rexinoids, it establishes a new class of innovative RXR modulators to overcome key challenges in RXR targeting drug discovery.
