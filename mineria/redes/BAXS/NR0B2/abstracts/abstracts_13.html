<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>	<meta charset="utf-8">	<title>generación de archivo html</title></head><body>Small heterodimer partner (SHP) is a transcriptional corepressor regulating diverse metabolic processes. Here, we show that SHP acts as an intrinsic negative regulator of iron homeostasis. SHP-deficient mice maintained on a high-iron diet showed increased serum hepcidin levels, decreased expression of the iron exporter ferroportin as well as iron accumulation compared to WT mice. Conversely, overexpression of either SHP or AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a metabolic sensor inducing SHP expression, suppressed BMP6-induced hepcidin expression. In addition, an inhibitory effect of AMPK activators metformin and AICAR on BMP6-mediated hepcidin gene expression was significantly attenuated by ablation of SHP expression. Interestingly, SHP physically interacted with SMAD1 and suppressed BMP6-mediated recruitment of the SMAD complex to the hepcidin gene promoter by inhibiting the formation of SMAD1 and SMAD4 complex. Finally, overexpression of SHP and metformin treatment of BMP6 stimulated mice substantially restored hepcidin expression and serum iron to baseline levels. These results reveal a previously unrecognized role for SHP in the transcriptional control of iron homeostasis.
Orphan nuclear receptors are members of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily and are so named because their endogenous physiological ligands are either unknown or may not exist. Because of their important regulatory roles in many key physiological processes, dysregulation of signalings controlled by these receptors is associated with many diseases including cancer. Over years, studies of orphan NRs have become an area of great interest because their specific physiological and pathological roles have not been well-defined, and some of them are promising drug targets for diseases. The recently identified synthetic small molecule ligands, acting as agonists or antagonists, to these orphan NRs not only help to understand better their functional roles but also highlight that the signalings mediated by these ligand-independent NRs in diseases could be therapeutically intervened. This review is a summary of the recent advances in elucidating the emerging functional roles of orphan NRs in cancers, especially prostate cancer. In particular, some orphan NRs, RORγ, TR2, TR4, COUP-IFII, ERRα, DAX1 and SHP, exhibit crosstalk or interference with androgen receptor (AR) signaling in either normal or malignant prostatic cells, highlighting their involvement in prostate cancer progression as androgen and AR signaling pathway play critical roles in this process. We also propose that a better understanding of the mechanism of actions of these orphan NRs in prostate gland or prostate cancer could help to evaluate their potential value as therapeutic targets for prostate cancer.
The nuclear receptor superfamily consists of the steroid and non-steroid hormone receptors and the orphan nuclear receptors. Small heterodimer partner (SHP) is an orphan family nuclear receptor that plays an essential role in the regulation of glucose and cholesterol metabolism. Recent studies reported a previously unidentified role for SHP in the regulation of innate immunity and inflammation. The innate immune system has a critical function in the initial response against a variety of microbial and danger signals. Activation of the innate immune response results in the induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines to promote anti-microbial effects. An excessive or uncontrolled inflammatory response is potentially harmful to the host, and can cause tissue damage or pathological threat. Therefore, the innate immune response should be tightly regulated to enhance host defense while preventing unwanted immune pathologic responses. In this review, we discuss recent studies showing that SHP is involved in the negative regulation of toll-like receptor-induced and NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3)-mediated inflammatory responses in innate immune cells. Understanding the function of SHP in innate immune cells will allow us to prevent or modulate acute and chronic inflammation processes in cases where dysregulated innate immune activation results in damage to normal tissues. 
Fibroblast growth factor-19 (FGF19) is an intestinal hormone that mediates postprandial metabolic responses in the liver. The unusual orphan nuclear receptor, small heterodimer partner (SHP), acts as a co-repressor for many transcriptional factors and has been implicated in diverse biological pathways including FGF19-mediated repression of bile acid synthesis. To explore global functions of SHP in mediating FGF19 action, we identify genome-wide SHP binding sites in hepatic chromatin in mice treated with vehicle or FGF19 by ChIP-seq analysis.
The overall pattern of SHP binding sites between these two groups is similar, but SHP binding is enhanced at the sites by addition of FGF19. SHP binding is detected preferentially in promoter regions that are enriched in motifs for unexpected non-nuclear receptors. We observe global co-localization of SHP sites with published sites for SREBP-2, a master transcriptional activator of cholesterol biosynthesis. FGF19 increases functional interaction between endogenous SHP and SREBP-2 and inhibits SREBP-2 target genes, and these effects were blunted in SHP-knockout mice. Furthermore, FGF19-induced phosphorylation of SHP at Thr-55 is shown to be important for its functional interaction with SREBP-2 and reduction of liver/serum cholesterol levels.
This study reveals SHP as a global transcriptional partner of SREBP-2 in regulation of sterol biosynthetic gene networks and provides a potential mechanism for cholesterol-lowering action of FGF19.
Small heterodimer partner (SHP; NR0B2) is a unique orphan nuclear receptor (NR) that contains a putative ligand-binding domain but lacks a DNA-binding domain. SHP is a transcriptional corepressor affecting diverse metabolic processes including bile acid synthesis, cholesterol and lipid metabolism, glucose and energy homeostasis, and reproductive biology via interaction with multiple NRs and transcriptional factors (TFs). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most deadly human cancers worldwide with few therapeutic options and poor prognosis. Recently, it is becoming clear that SHP plays an antitumor role in the development of liver cancer. In this review, we summarize the most recent findings regarding the new SHP interaction partners, new structural insights into SHP's gene repressing activity, and SHP protein posttranslational modifications by bile acids. We also discuss the pleiotropic role of SHP in regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, DNA methylation, and inflammation that are related to antitumor role of SHP in HCC. Improving our understanding of SHP's antitumor role in the development of liver cancer will provide new insights into developing novel treatments or prevention strategies. Future research will focus on developing more efficacious and specific synthetic SHP ligands for pharmaceutical applications in liver cancer and several metabolic diseases such as hypercholesterolemia, obesity, diabetes, and fatty liver disease.
The orphan nuclear receptor TLX regulates neural stem cell self-renewal in the adult brain and functions primarily as a transcription repressor through recruitment of Atrophin corepressors, which bind to TLX via a conserved peptide motif termed the Atro box. Here we report crystal structures of the human and insect TLX ligand-binding domain in complex with Atro box peptides. In these structures, TLX adopts an autorepressed conformation in which its helix H12 occupies the coactivator-binding groove. Unexpectedly, H12 in this autorepressed conformation forms a novel binding pocket with residues from helix H3 that accommodates a short helix formed by the conserved ALXXLXXY motif of the Atro box. Mutations that weaken the TLX-Atrophin interaction compromise the repressive activity of TLX, demonstrating that this interaction is required for Atrophin to confer repressor activity to TLX. Moreover, the autorepressed conformation is conserved in the repressor class of orphan nuclear receptors, and mutations of corresponding residues in other members of this class of receptors diminish their repressor activities. Together, our results establish the functional conservation of the autorepressed conformation and define a key sequence motif in the Atro box that is essential for TLX-mediated repression. 
Gallstone disease is one of the most prevalent and costly gastrointestinal disorders worldwide. Gallstones are formed in the biliary system by cholesterol secretions in bile, which result from excess cholesterol, a deficiency in bile salts or a combination of the two. The present study examined the effects of proteasome inhibition on gallstone formation using the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib (BT) and carfilzomib (CF). C57BL/6J mice were fed a lithogenic diet to generate gallstones and injected with BT or CF for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks of the lithogenic diet, 8 out of the 10 mice in the control group had developed gallstones, whereas none of the mice who received proteasome inhibitors had developed gallstones. Notably, the expression of genes associated with cholesterol synthesis (sterol regulatory element‑binding protein‑2 and 3‑hydroxy‑3‑methylglutaryl‑CoA reductase), cholesterol secretion [ATP‑binding cassette subfamily G member 5 (ABCG5) and ABCG8] and bile acid synthesis [cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily A member 1 (Cyp7a1), Cyp7b1, Cyp27a1 and Cyp8b1] was reduced in the livers of mice injected with BT or CF. Cyp7a1 encodes cholesterol 7α‑hydroxylase, the rate‑limiting enzyme in the synthesis of bile acid from cholesterol. The present study therefore measured the expression levels of transcription factors that are known to inhibit Cyp7a1 expression, namely farnesoid X receptor (FXR), pregnane X receptor (PXR) and small heterodimer partner (SHP). Although FXR, PXR and SHP expression was predicted to increase in the presence of proteasome inhibitors, the expression levels were actually reduced; thus, it was concluded that they were not involved in the proteasome inhibition‑induced regulation of Cyp7a1. Further investigation of the mitogen‑activated protein kinase and protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathways in human hepatoma cells revealed that proteasome inhibition‑induced c‑Jun N‑terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation reduced CYP7A1 and CYP27A1 expression. In addition, reduced PKA phosphorylation as a result of proteasome inhibition regulated ABCG5 and ABCG8 expression. In conclusion, these findings suggest that proteasome inhibition regulates cholesterol and biliary metabolism via the JNK and PKA pathways, and is a promising therapeutic strategy to prevent gallstone disease.
Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is an increasingly used bariatric surgery, which is reported to be effective for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Recently, activation of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), which is a nuclear receptor of bile acid (BA), was reported to contribute to the resolution of NAFLD. However, it is unclear whether SG has an effect on expression of FXR in the liver. We aimed to investigate the expression of FXR and its related factors in the liver after SG and to clarify the relationship between changes in FXR expression and NAFLD in an obese rat model.
Thirty male Zucker fatty rats were divided into three groups: sham-operated (SO) control, pair-fed (PF) control, and SG. Eight weeks after the surgery, metabolic parameters, plasma levels of total BA and liver enzymes, liver triglyceride (TG) content, and mRNA expression of FXR and its related factors, such as small heterodimer partner (SHP) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), were measured.
Metabolic parameters in the SG group were significantly improved compared with the SO group. Liver enzymes and TG were significantly lower in the SG group than in the SO group. Plasma levels of BA were significantly higher in the SG group than in the SO and PF groups. mRNA expression of FXR, SHP, and PPARα in the liver was significantly higher in the SG group than in the SO group.
These results suggest that the effects of SG on NAFLD should be associated with the expression of the FXR pathway in the liver in a Zucker fatty rat model.
The vitamin D-deficient model, established in the C57BL/6 mouse after 8 weeks of feeding vitamin D-deficient diets in the absence or presence of added calcium, was found associated with elevated levels of plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) and plasma and liver cholesterol, and a reduction in cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1, rate-limiting enzyme for cholesterol metabolism) and renal Oat3 mRNA/protein expression levels. However, there was no change in plasma calcium and phosphate levels. Appraisal of the liver revealed an up-regulation of mRNA expressions of the small heterodimer partner (Shp) and attenuation of Cyp7a1, which contributed to hypercholesterolemia in vitamin D-deficiency. When vitamin D-sufficient or D-deficient mice were further rendered hypercholesterolemic with 3 weeks of feeding the respective, high fat/high cholesterol (HF/HC) diets, treatment with 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2 D3 ], active vitamin D receptor (VDR) ligand, or vitamin D (cholecalciferol) to HF/HC vitamin D-deficient mice lowered the cholesterol back to baseline levels. Cholecalciferol treatment partially restored renal Oat3 mRNA/protein expression back to that of vitamin D-sufficient mice. When the protein expression of protein kinase C (PKC), a known, negative regulator of Oat3, was examined in murine kidney, no difference in PKC expression was observed for any of the diets with/without 1,25(OH)2 D3 /cholecalciferol treatment, inferring that VDR regulation of renal Oat3 did not involve PKC in mice. As expected, plasma calcium levels were not elevated by cholecalciferol treatment of vitamin D-deficient mice, while 1,25(OH)2 D3 treatment led to hypercalcemia. In conclusion, vitamin D-deficiency resulted in down-regulation of liver Cyp7a1 and renal Oat3, conditions that are alleviated upon replenishment of cholecalciferol.
The increasing incidence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has resulted in it becoming a common cause of liver-related mortality; however, no efficient treatment has been established. It has been reported that bariatric surgery improves metabolic comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus and NASH. Although the mechanism is unclear, it is thought that the changes in bile acid (BA) signaling via its nuclear receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), produce various metabolic effects. We sought to investigate the effects and mechanisms of bariatric surgery on NASH improvement.
Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed by a high-fat and high-fructose diet, which results in obesity, insulin resistance, and NASH. Rats underwent duodenal-jejunal bypass (DJB), which is a main component of bariatric procedures. The liver pathological findings and the expression level of mRNA of FXR were investigated. The plasma BA level was measured in peripheral and portal vein blood.
DJB suppressed weight gain, improved insulin resistance, and ameliorated NASH mainly in a point of inflammation. The plasma BA level along with the expression of FXR and its target transcriptional factor, small heterodimer partner (SHP), in the liver were elevated.
DJB has a direct effect on NASH improvement, and there is a possibility that an anti-inflammatory effect is functioning as a part of the mechanism. The increase of plasma bile acid level followed by the stimulation of FXR signaling may contribute to this phenomenon.
High-mobility-group protein 2 (HMGB2) expression is upregulated in human liver cancer. However, little is known about its regulatory function. Here we establish HMGB2 as a new modulator of the pluripotency of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Similar to OCT4 and SOX2, HMGB2 protein is highly expressed in undifferentiated CGR8 cells, whereas it undergoes rapid decline during embryonic body (EB) formation. HMGB2 interacts with OCT4, increases protein expression of OCT4 and SOX2, and enhances their transcriptional activities. We also show that miRNA-127 is a translational repressor of HMGB2 protein expression by targeting its 3'UTR. We further elucidate a trancrptional mechanism controlling HMGB2 mRNA expression by nuclear receptor SHP and transcription factor E2F1. Diminishing HMGB2 expression by ectopic expression of miR-127 or SHP, or treatment with a small molecule inhibitor inflachromene (ICM), decreases OCT4 and SOX2 expression and facilitates CGR8 differentiation. In addition, HMGB2 is markedly induced in liver tumor initiating cells (TICs). Diminishing HMGB2 expression by shHMGB2, miR-127 or SHP impaires spheroid formation. Importantly, HMGB2 expression is elevated in various human cancers. Conclusion: HMGB2 acts upstream of the OCT4/SOX2 signaling to control ESCs pluripotency. Diminishing HMGB2 expression by miR-127 or SHP may provide a potential means to decrease the pluripotency of tumor initiating cells.
Small heterodimer partner (SHP) is an important transcriptional factor involved in the regulation of glucose, lipid, and bile acid metabolism in the liver. SHP has been reported to be down-regulated in ovariectomized (Ovx) mice and up-regulated by estrogens suggesting a link between estrogens and SHP. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of exercise training on SHP and key molecular markers of cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis in Ovx rats under cholesterol feeding.
Our main experimental group was composed of Ovx rats fed a high-cholesterol diet (Ovx-Chol) that was compared to a group of Ovx rats fed a standard diet (Ovx-SD) and a group of sham operated rats fed the cholesterol diet (Sham-Chol). These three groups of Ovx and sham rats were subdivided into either voluntary wheel running (Tr) or sedentary (Sed) groups for 5 weeks. The mRNA expression of all genes was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
Liver total cholesterol levels were not affected by exercise training in any of the experimental conditions. Cholesterol feeding in both sham and Ovx rats resulted in significantly higher hepatic cholesterol accumulation than in Ovx-SD (P &lt; 0.001). Hepatic low density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) involved in cholesterol uptake from circulation was not influenced by training. A main effect of training was, however, found for transcripts of SHP and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1, P &lt; 0.050). CYP7A1 is the main gene involved in bile acid biosynthesis from cholesterol.
These results suggest that voluntary wheel running modulates cholesterol metabolism in Ovx animals through up-regulation of SHP and bile acid formation.
Fibrates and their receptor, namely peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), have been reported to regulate bile acid (BA) synthesis and transport. However, the effect of fibrate treatment and PPARα activation on BA homeostasis remains controversial. In this study, both wild-type (WT) and PPARα-null male mice were treated with clofibrate (CLOF) for 4 days to evaluate the effects of short-term PPARα activation on BA homeostasis. Although a decrease in total BAs (ΣBAs) was observed in livers of CLOF-treated WT mice, it was not observed in PPARα-null mice. CLOF-mediated decrease in ΣBAs in the liver was not likely due to the reduction in BA synthesis or BA uptake, as evidenced by an increase in the BA synthetic enzyme (Cyp7a1) and 2 BA uptake transporters (Na (+)-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide [Ntcp] and organic anion transporting polypeptide [Oatp]1b2). Instead, the decrease in liver BAs by CLOF is largely a result of increased biliary excretion of BAs, which was associated with a significant induction of the canalicular efflux transporter (bile salt export pump [Bsep]) in the liver. The PPARα-mediated increase in Cyp7a1 in CLOF-treated WT mice was not due to farnesoid X receptor (Fxr)-small heterodimer partner (Shp) signaling in the liver, but due to suppression of Fxr- fibroblast growth factor15 signaling in the ileum. Additionally, CLOF also suppressed intestinal BA transporters (apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter and organic solute transporterβ) and cholesterol efflux transporters (Abcg5 and Abcg8) in a PPARα-dependent manner. In summary, this study provides the first comprehensive analysis on the effect of a short-term CLOF treatment on BA homeostasis, and revealed an essential role of PPARα in regulating BA synthesis, transport and signaling.
The nuclear receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), has been recently considered as a tumor suppressor in HCC. IL-6/Janus kinase 2 (Jak-2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway has been implicated as a key player in many cancer types. This study aimed at investigating the potential effect of the FXR agonist, obeticholic acid (OCA), on HCC and the involvement of IL-6/STAT3 pathway. The potential regulation of STAT3 by its main feedback inhibitor target gene, the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), triggered by OCA was also explored. Cytotoxicity studies were performed on HepG2, Huh7, and SNU-449 cell lines using OCA alone and combined with the FXR antagonist guggulsterone (Gugg). OCA cytotoxic effect was significantly hampered in presence of Gugg. OCA also caused cell cycle arrest and inhibited invasion and migration of HCC cells. Decrease in STAT3 phosphorylation and SOCS3 upregulation were also observed. Moreover, Jak-2, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels were decreased. These results were correlated with an upregulation of FXR and small heterodimer partner (SHP) levels. Effects of OCA on IL-6/STAT3 main key players were reversed in presence of Gugg. Overall, these findings suggest a potential effect of OCA in HCC via interfering with IL-6/STAT3 signalling pathway in vitro.
TWIST1, an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) transcription factor, is critical for oncogene-driven non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumorigenesis. Given the potential of TWIST1 as a therapeutic target, a chemical-bioinformatic approach using connectivity mapping (CMAP) analysis was used to identify TWIST1 inhibitors. Characterization of the top ranked candidates from the unbiased screen revealed that harmine, a harmala alkaloid, inhibited multiple TWIST1 functions, including single-cell dissemination, suppression of normal branching in 3D epithelial culture, and proliferation of oncogene driver-defined NSCLC cells. Harmine treatment phenocopied genetic loss of TWIST1 by inducing oncogene-induced senescence or apoptosis. Mechanistic investigation revealed that harmine targeted the TWIST1 pathway through its promotion of TWIST1 protein degradation. As dimerization is critical for TWIST1 function and stability, the effect of harmine on specific TWIST1 dimers was examined. TWIST1 and its dimer partners, the E2A proteins, which were found to be required for TWIST1-mediated functions, regulated the stability of the other heterodimeric partner posttranslationally. Harmine preferentially promoted degradation of the TWIST1-E2A heterodimer compared with the TWIST-TWIST1 homodimer, and targeting the TWIST1-E2A heterodimer was required for harmine cytotoxicity. Finally, harmine had activity in both transgenic and patient-derived xenograft mouse models of KRAS-mutant NSCLC. These studies identified harmine as a first-in-class TWIST1 inhibitor with marked anti-tumor activity in oncogene-driven NSCLC including EGFR mutant, KRAS mutant and MET altered NSCLC.Implications: TWIST1 is required for oncogene-driven NSCLC tumorigenesis and EMT; thus, harmine and its analogues/derivatives represent a novel therapeutic strategy to treat oncogene-driven NSCLC as well as other solid tumor malignancies.

Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a master regulator of bile acid homeostasis through transcriptional regulation of genes involved in bile acid synthesis and cellular membrane transport. Impairment of bile acid efflux due to cholangiopathies results in chronic cholestasis leading to abnormal elevation of intrahepatic and systemic bile acid levels. Obeticholic acid (OCA) is a potent and selective FXR agonist that is 100-fold more potent than the endogenous ligand chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). The effects of OCA on genes involved in bile acid homeostasis were investigated using sandwich-cultured human hepatocytes. Gene expression was determined by measuring mRNA levels. OCA dose-dependently increased fibroblast growth factor-19 (FGF-19) and small heterodimer partner (SHP) which, in turn, suppress mRNA levels of cholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the rate-limiting enzyme for de novo synthesis of bile acids. Consistent with CYP7A1 suppression, total bile acid content was decreased by OCA (1 μmol/L) to 42.7 ± 20.5% relative to control. In addition to suppressing de novo bile acids synthesis, OCA significantly increased the mRNA levels of transporters involved in bile acid homeostasis. The bile salt excretory pump (BSEP), a canalicular efflux transporter, increased by 6.4 ± 0.8-fold, and the basolateral efflux heterodimer transporters, organic solute transporter α (OSTα ) and OSTβ increased by 6.4 ± 0.2-fold and 42.9 ± 7.9-fold, respectively. The upregulation of BSEP and OSTα and OSTβ, by OCA reduced the intracellular concentrations of d8 -TCA, a model bile acid, to 39.6 ± 8.9% relative to control. These data demonstrate that OCA does suppress bile acid synthesis and reduce hepatocellular bile acid levels, supporting the use of OCA to treat bile acid-induced toxicity observed in cholestatic diseases.
Bile acids are regulators of lipid and glucose metabolism, and modulate inflammation in the liver and other tissues. Primary bile acids such as cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are produced in the liver, and converted into secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid by gut microbiota. Here we investigated the possible roles of bile acids in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis and the impact of the gut microbiome on bile acid signalling in NAFLD.
Serum bile acid levels and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), liver gene expression profiles and gut microbiome compositions were determined in patients with NAFLD, high-fat diet-fed rats and their controls.
Serum concentrations of primary and secondary bile acids were increased in patients with NAFLD. In per cent, the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) antagonistic DCA was increased, while the agonistic CDCA was decreased in NAFLD. Increased mRNA expression for cytochrome P450 7A1, Na+-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide and paraoxonase 1, no change in mRNA expression for small heterodimer partner and bile salt export pump, and reduced serum FGF19 were evidence of impaired FXR and fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4)-mediated signalling in NAFLD. Taurine and glycine metabolising bacteria were increased in the gut of patients with NAFLD, reflecting increased secondary bile acid production. Similar changes in liver gene expression and the gut microbiome were observed in high-fat diet-fed rats.
The serum bile acid profile, the hepatic gene expression pattern and the gut microbiome composition consistently support an elevated bile acid production in NAFLD. The increased proportion of FXR antagonistic bile acid explains, at least in part, the suppression of hepatic FXR-mediated and FGFR4-mediated signalling. Our study suggests that future NAFLD intervention may target the components of FXR signalling, including the bile acid converting gut microbiome.
The interference of bile acid secretion through bile salt export pump (BSEP) inhibition is one of the mechanisms for troglitazone (TGZ)-induced hepatotoxicity. Here, we investigated the impact of single or repeated oral doses of TGZ (200 mg/kg/day, 7 days) on bile acid homoeostasis in wild-type (WT) and Bsep knockout (KO) rats. Following oral doses, plasma exposures of TGZ were not different between WT and KO rats, and were similar on day 1 and day 7. However, plasma exposures of the major metabolite, troglitazone sulfate (TS), in KO rats were 7.6- and 9.3-fold lower than in WT on day 1 and day 7, respectively, due to increased TS biliary excretion. With Bsep KO, the mRNA levels of multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp2), Mrp3, Mrp4, Mdr1, breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp), sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide, small heterodimer partner, and Sult2A1 were significantly altered in KO rats. Following seven daily TGZ treatments, Cyp7A1 was significantly increased in both WT and KO rats. In the vehicle groups, plasma exposures of individual bile acids demonstrated variable changes in KO rats as compared with WT. WT rats dosed with TGZ showed an increase of many bile acid species in plasma on day 1, suggesting the inhibition of Bsep. Conversely, these changes returned to base levels on day 7. In KO rats, alterations of most bile acids were observed after seven doses of TGZ. Collectively, bile acid homeostasis in rats was regulated through bile acid synthesis and transport in response to Bsep deficiency and TGZ inhibition. Additionally, our study is the first to demonstrate that repeated TGZ doses can upregulate Cyp7A1 in rats.
Hypercholesterolaemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and it has been found that some probiotic bacteria possess cholesterol-lowering capabilities. In this study, the ability of the Lab4 probiotic consortium to hydrolyse bile salts, assimilate cholesterol and regulate cholesterol transport by polarised Caco-2 enterocytes was demonstrated. Furthermore, in wild-type C57BL/6J mice fed a high fat diet, 2-weeks supplementation with Lab4 probiotic consortium plus Lactobacillus plantarum CUL66 resulted in significant reductions in plasma total cholesterol levels and suppression of diet-induced weight gain. No changes in plasma levels of very low-density lipoprotein/low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, cytokines or bile acids were observed. Increased amounts of total and unconjugated bile acids in the faeces of the probiotic-fed mice, together with modulation of hepatic small heterodimer partner and cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase mRNA expression, implicates bile salt hydrolase activity as a potential mechanism of action. In summary, this study demonstrates the cholesterol-lowering efficacy of short-term feeding of the Lab4 probiotic consortium plus L. plantarum CUL66 in wild-type mice and supports further assessment in human trials.
Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has been known that UDCA has prominent effects on liver, however, there is little known about its influence on autoimmune disease. Here, the benefit of UDCA on arthritis rheumatoid (RA) in vivo was tested.
RA mouse were induced using collagen II (CIA, collagen induced arthritis) where the disease severity or UDCA-related signaling pathway such as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) or small heterodimer partner interacting leucine zipper protein (SMILE) was evaluated by westerblot and immunohistochemical staining. Gene expression was measured by realtime-polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
The administration of UDCA effectively alleviated the arthritic score and incidence with decreased cartilage damage and lipid metabolic parameters. UDCA also suppressed the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. It was confirmed that UDCA upregulated the expression of SMILE and transcriptional activity of PPARγ via controlling AMPK or p38 activity.
In the present study, the therapeutic effect of UDCA inducing SMILE through AMPK activation in rheumatoid arthritis mouse as well as other autoimmune disease was proposed.
Lysosome-mediated autophagy is essential for cellular survival and homeostasis upon nutrient deprivation, but is repressed after feeding. Despite the emerging importance of transcriptional regulation of autophagy by nutrient-sensing factors, the role for epigenetic control is largely unexplored. Here, we show that Small Heterodimer Partner (SHP) mediates postprandial epigenetic repression of hepatic autophagy by recruiting histone demethylase LSD1 in response to a late fed-state hormone, FGF19 (hFGF19, mFGF15). FGF19 treatment or feeding inhibits macroautophagy, including lipophagy, but these effects are blunted in SHP-null mice or LSD1-depleted mice. In addition, feeding-mediated autophagy inhibition is attenuated in FGF15-null mice. Upon FGF19 treatment or feeding, SHP recruits LSD1 to CREB-bound autophagy genes, including Tfeb, resulting in dissociation of CRTC2, LSD1-mediated demethylation of gene-activation histone marks H3K4-me2/3, and subsequent accumulation of repressive histone modifications. Both FXR and SHP inhibit hepatic autophagy interdependently, but while FXR acts early, SHP acts relatively late after feeding, which effectively sustains postprandial inhibition of autophagy. This study demonstrates that the FGF19-SHP-LSD1 axis maintains homeostasis by suppressing unnecessary autophagic breakdown of cellular components, including lipids, under nutrient-rich postprandial conditions.
Medical conditions accompanying obesity often require drug therapy, but whether and how obesity alters the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and thus drug pharmacokinetics is poorly defined. Previous studies have shown that high-fat diet (HFD) feeding and subsequent obesity in mice lead to altered expression of transcriptional regulators for cytochrome P450 CYP2D6, including hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α, a transcriptional activator of CYP2D6) and small heterodimer partner (SHP, a transcriptional repressor of CYP2D6). The objective of this study was to examine whether diet-induced obesity alters CYP2D6 expression by modulating HNF4α and SHP expression. Male CYP2D6-humanized transgenic (Tg-CYP2D6) mice were fed with HFD or matching control diet for 18 weeks. Hepatic mRNA expression of CYP2D6 decreased to a small extent in the HFD group (by 31%), but the differences in CYP2D6 protein and activity levels in hepatic S9 fractions were found insignificant between the groups. Although hepatic SHP expression did not differ between the groups, HNF4α mRNA and protein levels decreased by ∼30% in the HFD group. Among major mouse endogenous cytochrome P450 genes, Cyp1a2 and Cyp2c37 showed significant decreases in the HFD group, whereas Cyp2e1 expression did not differ between groups. Cyp2b10 and Cyp3a11 expression was higher in the HFD group, with corresponding 2.9-fold increases in hepatic CYP3A activities in HFD-fed mice. Together, these results suggest that obesity has minimal effects on CYP2D6-mediated drug metabolism, although it modulates the expression of mouse endogenous P450s in a gene-specific manner.
The nuclear receptors farnesoid X receptor (FXR; NR1H4) and small heterodimer partner (SHP; NR0B2) play crucial roles in bile acid homeostasis. Global double knockout of FXR and SHP signaling (DKO) causes severe cholestasis and liver injury at early ages. Here, we report an unexpected beneficial impact on glucose and fatty acid metabolism in aged DKO mice, which show suppressed body weight gain and adiposity when maintained on normal chow. This phenotype was not observed in single Fxr or Shp knockouts. Liver-specific Fxr/Shp double knockout mice fully phenocopied the DKO mice, with lower hepatic triglyceride accumulation, improved glucose/insulin tolerance, and accelerated fatty acid use. In both DKO and liver-specific Fxr/Shp double knockout livers, these metabolic phenotypes were associated with altered expression of fatty acid metabolism and autophagy-machinery genes. Loss of the hepatic FXR/SHP axis reprogrammed white and brown adipose tissue gene expression to boost fatty acid usage.
Combined deletion of the hepatic FXR/SHP axis improves glucose/fatty acid homeostasis in aged mice, reversing the aging phenotype of body weight gain, increased adiposity, and glucose/insulin tolerance, suggesting a central role of this axis in whole-body energy homeostasis. (Hepatology 2017;66:498-509).
Cholestasis promotes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the liver, however, the effect of ER stress on hepatic bile acid metabolism is unknown. We aim to determine the effect of ER stress on hepatic bile acid synthesis and transport in mice.
ER stress was induced pharmacologically in C57BL/6J mice and human hepatoma (HepG2) cells. The hepatic expression of genes controlling bile acid synthesis and transport was determined. To measure the activity of the primary bile acid synthetic pathway, the concentration of 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-1 was measured in plasma.
Induction of ER stress in mice and HepG2 cells rapidly suppressed the hepatic expression of the primary bile acid synthetic enzyme, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase. Plasma levels of 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-1 were reduced in mice subjected to ER stress, indicating impaired bile acid synthesis. Induction of ER stress in mice and HepG2 cells increased expression of the bile salt export pump (adenosine triphosphate binding cassette [Abc]b11) and a bile salt efflux pump (Abcc3). The observed regulation of Cyp7a1, Abcb11, and Abcc3 occurred in the absence of hepatic inflammatory cytokine activation and was not dependent on activation of hepatic small heterodimer partner or intestinal fibroblast growth factor 15. Consistent with suppressed bile acid synthesis and enhanced bile acid export from hepatocytes, prolonged ER stress decreased the hepatic bile acid content in mice.
Induction of ER stress in mice suppresses bile acid synthesis and enhances bile acid removal from hepatocytes independently of established bile acid regulatory pathways. These data show a novel function of the ER stress response in regulating bile acid metabolism.
The multidrug resistance 2 knockout (Mdr2-/- ) mouse is a well-established model of cholestatic cholangiopathies. Female Mdr2-/- mice develop more severe hepatobiliary damage than male Mdr2-/- mice, which is correlated with a higher proportion of taurocholate in the bile. Although estrogen has been identified as an important player in intrahepatic cholestasis, the underlying molecular mechanisms of gender-based disparity of cholestatic injury remain unclear. The long noncoding RNA H19 is an imprinted, maternally expressed, and estrogen-targeted gene, which is significantly induced in human fibrotic/cirrhotic liver and bile duct-ligated mouse liver. However, whether aberrant expression of H19 accounts for gender-based disparity of cholestatic injury in Mdr2-/- mice remains unknown. The current study demonstrated that H19 was markedly induced (∼200-fold) in the livers of female Mdr2-/- mice at advanced stages of cholestasis (100 days old) but not in age-matched male Mdr2-/- mice. During the early stages of cholestasis, H19 expression was minimal. We further determined that hepatic H19 was mainly expressed in cholangiocytes, not hepatocytes. Both taurocholate and estrogen significantly activated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 signaling pathway and induced H19 expression in cholangiocytes. Knocking down H19 not only significantly reduced taurocholate/estrogen-induced expression of fibrotic genes and sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 in cholangiocytes but also markedly reduced cholestatic injury in female Mdr2-/- mice. Furthermore, expression of small heterodimer partner was substantially inhibited at advanced stages of liver fibrosis, which was reversed by H19 short hairpin RNA in female Mdr2-/- mice. Similar findings were obtained in human primary sclerosing cholangitis liver samples.
H19 plays a critical role in the disease progression of cholestasis and represents a key factor that causes the gender disparity of cholestatic liver injury in Mdr2-/- mice. (Hepatology 2017;66:869-884).
The molecular mechanisms underlying the cholesterol-lowering properties of oats are only partly known. To study possible pathways involved, we investigated gene expressions in the liver and small intestine of mice fed oats.
Cholesterol and bile acids were analyzed in plasma and feces from LDL-receptor deficient (LDLr-/- ) mice fed Western diet with wholegrain oats. A transcriptome analysis of mRNA from liver and jejunum was performed together with quantitative RT-PCR. Oat-fed mice had lower levels of plasma lipids and increased levels of bile acids and cholesterol in feces compared with controls. Two hundred thirty nine genes in jejunum and 25 genes in liver were differentially expressed (FDR corrected p &lt; 0.05). The most affected biological process in jejunum was lipid biosynthesis and regulation. The apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT, Slc10a) and the intracellular bile acid binding protein (Fabp6) were both upregulated, whereas small heterodimer partner-1 (Shp-1) and apolipoprotein CII (Apoc2) were downregulated.
Whole oats attenuated responses typically induced by high-fat diet. Increased expression of genes for intestinal bile acid uptake following oat consumption suggests retention in the gut lumen rather than decreased uptake capacity as cause for the increased bile acid excretion and the concomitant reduction of plasma cholesterol.
We describe here a novel chemotype with substituted benzimidazole scaffold for nonsteroidal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) antagonists starting from the identification of a screening hit, BB-4. Structure diversity in four regions A-D of BB-4 or 1 is discussed. In particular, regions A and C had an effect on an antagonism against FXR as demonstrated by the derivatives represented by 7 and 15, respectively. Thus, compound 19 arising from the combination of regions A and C underscored an important fact on antagonism against FXR, also showing the reduced small heterodimer partner and the increased cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase expression levels.
The liver is an essential organ for nutrient and drug metabolism - possessing the remarkable ability to sense environmental and metabolic stimuli and provide an optimally adaptive response. Early growth response 1 (Egr1), an immediate early transcriptional factor which acts as a coordinator of the complex response to stress, is induced during liver injury and controls the expression of a wide range of genes involved in metabolism, cell proliferation, and role of Egr1 in liver injury and repair, deficiency of Egr1 delays liver regeneration process. The known upstream regulators of Egr1 include, but are not limited to, growth factors (e.g. transforming growth factor β1, platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor), nuclear receptors (e.g. hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α, small heterodimer partner, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ), and other transcription factors (e.g. Sp1, E2F transcription factor 1). Research efforts using various animal models such as fatty liver, liver injury, and liver fibrosis contribute greatly to the elucidation of Egr1 function in the liver. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents the second leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide due to the heterogeneity and the late stage at which cancer is generally diagnosed. Recent studies highlight the involvement of Egr1 in HCC development. The purpose of this review is to summarize current studies pertaining to the role of Egr1 in liver metabolism and liver diseases including liver cancer.
The humanized liver mouse model is being exploited increasingly for human drug metabolism studies. However, its model stability, intercommunication between human hepatocytes and mouse nonparenchymal cells in liver and murine intestine, and changes in extrahepatic transporter and enzyme expressions have not been investigated. We examined these issues in FRGN [fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (Fah-/-), recombination activating gene 2 (Rag2-/-), and interleukin 2 receptor subunit gamma (IL-2rg -/-) triple knockout] on nonobese diabetic (NOD) background] and chimeric mice: mFRGN and hFRGN (repopulated with mouse or human hepatocytes, respectively). hFRGN mice showed markedly higher levels of liver cholesterol, biliary bilirubin, and bile acids (liver, bile, and plasma; mainly human forms, but also murine bile acids) but lower transforming growth factor beta receptor 2 (TGFBR2) mRNA expression levels (10%) in human hepatocytes and other proliferative markers in mouse nonparenchymal cells (Tgf-β1) and cholangiocytes [plasma membrane-bound, G protein-coupled receptor for bile acids (Tgr5)], suggestive of irregular regeneration processes in hFRGN livers. Changes in gene expression in murine intestine, kidney, and brain of hFRGN mice, in particular, induction of intestinal farnesoid X receptor (Fxr) genes: fibroblast growth factor 15 (Fgf15), mouse ileal bile acid binding protein (Ibabp), small heterodimer partner (Shp), and the organic solute transporter alpha (Ostα), were observed. Proteomics revealed persistence of remnant murine proteins (cyotchrome P450 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1) and other enzymes and transporters) in hFRGN livers and suggest the likelihood of mouse activity. When compared with normal human liver tissue, hFRGN livers showed lower SHP mRNA and higher CYP7A1 (300%) protein expression, consequences of tβ- and tα-muricholic acid-mediated inhibition of the FXR-SHP cascade and miscommunication between intestinal Fgf15 and human liver fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4), as confirmed by the unchanged hepatic pERK/total ERK ratio. Dysregulation of hepatocyte proliferation and bile acid homeostasis in hFRGN livers led to hepatotoxicity, gallbladder distension, liver deformity, and other extrahepatic changes, making questionable the use of the preparation for drug metabolism studies.
Cardiac dysfunction in patients with liver cirrhosis is strongly associated with increased serum bile acid concentrations. Here we show that excess bile acids decrease fatty acid oxidation in cardiomyocytes and can cause heart dysfunction, a cardiac syndrome that we term cholecardia. Farnesoid X receptor; Small Heterodimer Partner double knockout mice, a model for bile acid overload, display cardiac hypertrophy, bradycardia, and exercise intolerance. In addition, double knockout mice exhibit an impaired cardiac response to catecholamine challenge. Consistent with this decreased cardiac function, we show that elevated serum bile acids reduce cardiac fatty acid oxidation both in vivo and ex vivo. We find that increased bile acid levels suppress expression of proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α, a key regulator of fatty acid metabolism, and that proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α overexpression in cardiac cells was able to rescue the bile acid-mediated reduction in fatty acid oxidation genes. Importantly, intestinal bile acid sequestration with cholestyramine was sufficient to reverse the observed heart dysfunction in the double knockout mice.
Decreased proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α expression contributes to the metabolic dysfunction in cholecardia so that reducing serum bile acid concentrations may be beneficial against the metabolic and pathological changes in the heart. (Hepatology 2017;65:189-201).
Bile acids (BAs) play critical physiological functions in cholesterol homeostasis, and deregulation of BA metabolism causes cholestatic liver injury. The long noncoding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) was recently shown as a potential tumor suppressor; however, its basic hepatic function remains elusive. Using RNA pull-down with biotin-labeled sense or anti-sense MEG 3RNA followed by mass spectrometry, we identified RNA-binding protein polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1) as a MEG3 interacting protein and validated their interaction by RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP). Bioinformatics analysis revealed putative binding sites for PTBP1 within the coding region (CDS) of small heterodimer partner (SHP), a key repressor of BA biosynthesis. Forced expression of MEG3 in hepatocellular carcinoma cells guided and facilitated PTBP1 binding to the Shp CDS, resulting in Shp mRNA decay. Transient overexpression of MEG3 RNA in vivo in mouse liver caused rapid Shp mRNA degradation and cholestatic liver injury, which was accompanied by the disruption of BA homeostasis, elevation of liver enzymes, as well as dysregulation of BA synthetic enzymes and metabolic genes. Interestingly, RNA sequencing coupled with quantitative PCR (qPCR) revealed a drastic induction of MEG3 RNA in Shp-/- liver. SHP inhibited MEG3 gene transcription by repressing cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) transactivation of the MEG3 promoter. In addition, the expression of MEG3 and PTBP1 was activated in human fibrotic and cirrhotic livers.
MEG3 causes cholestasis by serving as a guide RNA scaffold to recruit PTBP1 to destabilize Shp mRNA. SHP in turn represses CREB-mediated activation of MEG3 expression in a feedback-regulatory fashion. (Hepatology 2017;65:604-615).
We report on the molecular interactions of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) with prenylflavonoids, an emerging class of FXR modulators. FXR is an attractive therapeutic target for mitigating metabolic syndromes (MetS) because FXR activates the inhibitory nuclear receptor, small heterodimer partner (SHP), thereby inhibiting both gluconeogenesis and de novo lipogenesis. We and others have shown that xanthohumol (XN), the principal prenylflavonoid of the hop plant (Humulus lupulus L.), is a FXR agonist based on its ability to affect lipid and glucose metabolism in vivo and to induces FXR target genes in biliary carcinoma cells and HEK293 cells. However, studies are currently lacking to rationalize the molecular mechanisms of FXR modulation by prenylflavonoids. We addressed this deficiency and report the first systematic study of FXR prenylflavonoid interactions. We combined hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) with computational studies for dissecting molecular recognition and conformational impact of prenylflavonoid interactions on the ligand binding domain (LBD) of human FXR. Four prenylflavonoids were tested: xanthohumol, a prenylated chalcone, two prenylated flavonones, namely isoxanthohumol (IX) and 8-prenylnaringenin (8PN), and a semisynthetic prenylflavonoid derivative, tetrahydroxanthohumol (TX). Enhancement of the HDX protection profile data by in silico predicted models of FXR prenylflavonoid complexes resulted in mapping of the prenylflavonoid interactions within the canonical ligand binding pocket. Our findings provide a foundation for the exploration of the chemical scaffolds of prenylated chalcones and flavanones as leads for future structure activity studies of this important nuclear receptor with potential relevance for ameliorating lipid metabolic disorders associated with obesity and MetS.
Bile acid homeostasis is essential and imbalance may lead to liver damage and liver failure. The bile acid induced intestinal factor fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) has been identified as a key protein for mediating negative feedback inhibition of bile acid synthesis. The aim of the study was to define FGF19 and bile acid concentrations in portal and systemic blood in the fasted and postprandial state. We also addressed the question if physiological portal levels of FGF19 can be extrapolated from the concentration in systemic blood.
Portal and systemic blood was collected from 75 fasted patients undergoing liver surgery and from three organ donors before and after enteral nutrition. Serum concentration of FGF19 was determined with ELISA and bile acid concentration with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
Concentration of bile acids was twice as high in portal compared to systemic blood in the fasted group and 3-5 times higher in the postprandial group. FGF19 increased after enteral nutrition but did not differ between portal and systemic blood, in either group. In addition, a strong, positive correlation between bile acids and FGF19 was found.
Our results confirm that bile acids drive the postprandial increase of circulating FGF19 but a hepatic clearance of FGF19 is unlikely. We conclude that systemic concentrations of FGF19 reflect portal concentrations of FGF19.
Cysteine dioxygenase 1 (CDO1) converts cysteine to cysteine sulfinic acid, which can be further converted by cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase (CSAD) to hypotaurine for taurine production. This cysteine catabolic pathway plays a major role in regulating hepatic cysteine homeostasis. Furthermore, taurine is used for bile acid conjugation, which enhances bile acid solubility and physiological function in the gut. Recent studies show that this cysteine catabolic pathway is repressed by bile acid signaling, but the molecular mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. The mechanisms of bile acid and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) regulation of hepatic CSAD expression were studied in mice and hepatocytes. We showed that hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) bound the mouse CSAD proximal promoter and induced CSAD transcription. FXR-induced small heterodimer partner (SHP) repressed mouse CSAD gene transcription via interacting with HNF4α as a repressor. Consistent with this model, cholic acid feeding, obeticholic acid administration, and liver HNF4α knockdown reduced hepatic CSAD expression, while liver SHP knockout and apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) inhibitor treatment induced hepatic CSAD expression in mice. Furthermore, TNF-α also inhibited CSAD expression, which may be partially mediated by reduced HNF4α in mouse hepatocytes. In contrast, bile acids and GW4064 did not inhibit CSAD expression in human hepatocytes. This study identified mouse CSAD as a novel transcriptional target of HNF4α. Bile acids and cytokines repress hepatic CSAD, which closely couples taurine production to bile acid synthesis in mice. The species-specific regulation of CSAD reflects the differential preference of bile acid conjugation to glycine and taurine in humans and mice, respectively.
Gastric intestinal metaplasia (IM) induced by bile acid is a precancerous lesion of gastric adenocarcinoma and is associated with the expression of caudal-related homeobox 2 (CDX2). In the present study, the role of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) on the regulation of CDX2 in gastric cells was investigated and the underlying molecular mechanisms were examined. Human gastric cell lines were treated with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) or FXR agonist GW4064. Cells were treated with CDCA in the presence or absence of the FXR antagonist or FXR siRNA transfection. Next, cells were treated with CDCA in the presence or absence of SHP siRNA transfection and FXR, CDX2 and SHP mRNA and protein levels were determined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed to examine the relationship between FXR and SHP and the expressions of FXR and CDX2 in gastritis and IM tissues were detected using immunohistochemistry. The results revealed that CDCA was able to induce CDX2 expression, which could be blocked by inhibition or knockdown of FXR. Mechanistically, FXR directly induced the expression of small heterodimer partner (SHP). SHP knockdown significantly decreased CDCA-induced CDX2 expression. ChIP results indicated that FXR could directly bind SHP promoter and promote SHP expression. Finally, immunohistochemistry results demonstrated that the expression levels of CDX2 and FXR in human IM lesions were significantly higher, compared with those in gastritis lesions, and were positively correlated. Collectively, these results revealed that the activation of FXR and sequential direct transcriptional induction of SHP were involved in the expression of CDX2 induced by bile acid in gastric IM lesions.
The beneficial effects of red wine against cardiovascular disease are associated with the abundant antioxidant polyphenols such as procyanidins. Recently, procyanidins extracted from the litchi pericarp (LPPC), a new source of procyanidins showed strong antioxidant activities in vitro, have been isolated and identified in our laboratory. The aim of present study was to investigate the anti-atherosclerotic effects of LPPC on atherosclerosis and hyperlipidemia in apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE KO) mice fed a high fat diet (HFD, 21% fat, 0.15% cholesterol) for 24 weeks. The results showed that LPPC intervention alleviated atherosclerosis, fat accumulation and hyperlipidemia in ApoE KO mice. Furthermore, real-time RT-PCR results showed that LPPC can regulate several key genes involved in hepatic lipid homeostasis, such as increasing mRNA levels of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and small heterodimer partner (SHP) which emerge as key regulators of lipid homeostasis at the transcriptional level, decreasing mRNA levels of 3-hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase which mediates cholestrol biosynthesis, and up-regulating the mRNA expressions of ATP-binding cassette transporter-1 (ABCA1) which modulates cholesterol efflux. Thus, these results elucidated that LPPC could alleviate the lipid disorder especially hypercholesteromia and ameliorate atherosclerosis in ApoE-KO mice fed a WTD via regulating gene expression involved in hepatic lipid homeostasis effectively.
The bile acid activated transcription factor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) regulates numerous metabolic processes and is a rising target for the treatment of hepatic and metabolic disorders. FXR agonists have revealed efficacy in treating non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), diabetes and dyslipidemia. Here we characterize imatinib as first-in-class allosteric FXR modulator and report the development of an optimized descendant that markedly promotes agonist induced FXR activation in a reporter gene assay and FXR target gene expression in HepG2 cells. Differential effects of imatinib on agonist-induced bile salt export protein and small heterodimer partner expression suggest that allosteric FXR modulation could open a new avenue to gene-selective FXR modulators.
Fructose malabsorption is a common digestive disorder in which absorption of fructose in the small intestine is impaired. An abnormality of the main intestinal fructose transporter proteins has been proposed as a cause for fructose malabsorption. However the underlying molecular mechanism for this remains unclear. In this study, we investigated whether carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) plays a role in intestinal fructose absorption through the regulation of genes involved in fructose transport and metabolism and ion transport.
Wild type (WT) and Chrebp knockout (KO) mice (6 or 8 weeks old) were fed a control diet (55% starch, 15% maltodextrin 10) or high-fructose diet (HFrD, 60% fructose, 10% starch) for 3-12 days. Body weight and food intake were measured, signs of fructose malabsorption were monitored, and the expression of genes involved in fructose transport/metabolism and ion transport was evaluated. Furthermore, transient transfection and chromatin immunoprecipitation were performed to show the direct interaction between ChREBP and carbohydrate response elements in the promoter of Slc2A5, which encodes the fructose transporter GLUT5.
Chrebp KO mice fed the control diet maintained a constant body weight, whereas those fed a HFrD showed significant weight loss within 3-5 days. In addition, Chrebp KO mice fed the HFrD exhibited a markedly distended cecum and proximal colon containing both fluid and gas, suggesting incomplete fructose absorption. Fructose-induced increases of genes involved in fructose transport (GLUT5), fructose metabolism (fructokinase, aldolase B, triokinase, and lactate dehydrogenase), and gluconeogenesis (glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase) were observed in the intestine of WT but not of Chrebp KO mice. Moreover the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3, which is involved in Na+ and water absorption in the intestine, was significantly decreased in HFrD-fed Chrebp KO mice. Consistent with this finding, the high-fructose diet-fed Chrebp KO mice developed severe diarrhea. Results of chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed a direct interaction of ChREBP with the Glut5 promoter, but not the Nhe3 promoter, in the small intestine. Ectopic co-expression of ChREBP and its heterodimer partner Max-like protein X activated the Glut5 promoter in Caco-2BBE cells.
ChREBP plays a key role in the dietary fructose transport as well as conversion into lactate and glucose through direct transcriptional control of genes involved in fructose transport, fructolysis, and gluconeogenesis. Moreover, ablation of Chrebp results in a severe diarrhea in mice fed a high-fructose diet, which is associated with the insufficient induction of GLUT5 in the intestine.
Arthroplasty has been widely performed worldwide. However, peri-prosthetic osteolysis and aseptic loosening induced by macrophages activated by wear particles still remain a predominant cause of long term prosthetic failure. Our study aimed to identify the role of small heterodimer partner (SHP) in secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by macrophages through Toll-like Recepters (TLR)s signaling pathway activated by wear particles both in vivo and in vitro. The effect of SHP on activation of TLR4 pathway and secretion of cytokines was observed in RAW264.7 cells and SHP gene over-expressed mice. Expression of TLR4, TRAF6, NEMO complex and proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α in macrophages stimulated by wear particles was up-regulated, while SHP was down-regulated. On the other hand, inhibition of SHP up-regulated the expression of NEMO complex and proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α in RAW264.7 stimulated by wear particles, while over-expression of SHP gene showed an opposite result. Over-expression of SHP gene could inhibit cranial osteolysis induced by wear particles in mice model. In conclusion, SHP down-regulates TLR4 signaling pathway to reduce osteolysis induced by titanium particles via in vitro and in vivo experimental models.
This article is a report on a symposium entitled "Physiological Regulation of Drug Metabolism and Transport" sponsored by the American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics and held at the Experimental Biology 2017 meeting in Chicago, IL. The contributions of physiologic and pathophysiological regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters to interindividual variability in drug metabolism are increasingly recognized but in many cases are not well understood. The presentations herein discuss the phenomenology, consequences, and mechanism of such regulation. CYP2D6 transgenic mice were used to provide insights into the mechanism of regulation of this enzyme in pregnancy, via hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α, small heterodimer partner, and retinoids. Regulation of intestinal and hepatic drug-processing enzymes by the intestinal microbiota via tryptophan and its metabolites was investigated. The potential impact of parasitic infections on human drug metabolism and clearance was assessed in mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni or Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi AS, both of which produced widespread and profound effects on murine hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Finally, the induction of Abcc drug efflux transporters by fasting was investigated. This was demonstrated to occur via a cAMP, protein kinase A/nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2/Sirtuin 1 pathway via antioxidant response elements on the Abcc genes.
Vitamin D3 and the synthetic vitamin D analogs, 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3 [1α(OH)D3 ], 1α-hydroxyvitamin D2 [1α(OH)D2 ] and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3 ] were appraised for their vitamin D receptor (VDR) associated-potencies as cholesterol lowering agents in mice in vivo. These precursors are activated in vivo: 1α(OH)D3 and 1α(OH)D2 are transformed by liver CYP2R1 and CYP27A1 to active VDR ligands, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2 D3 ] and 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 [1,25(OH)2 D2 ], respectively. 1α(OH)D2 may also be activated by CYP24A1 to 1α,24-dihydroxyvitamin D2 [1,24(OH)2 D2 ], another active VDR ligand. 25(OH)D3 , the metabolite formed via CYP2R1 and or CYP27A1 in liver from vitamin D3 , is activated by CYP27B1 in the kidney to 1,25(OH)2 D3 . In C57BL/6 mice fed the high fat/high cholesterol Western diet for 3 weeks, vitamin D analogs were administered every other day intraperitoneally during the last week of the diet. The rank order for cholesterol lowering, achieved via mouse liver small heterodimer partner (Shp) inhibition and increased cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1) expression, was: 1.75 nmol/kg 1α(OH)D3  &gt; 1248 nmol/kg 25(OH)D3 (dose ratio of 0.0014) &gt; &gt; 1625 nmol/kg vitamin D3 . Except for 1.21 nmol/kg 1α(OH)D2 that failed to lower liver and plasma cholesterol contents, a significant negative correlation was observed between the liver concentration of 1,25(OH)2 D3 formed from the precursors and liver cholesterol levels. The composite results show that vitamin D analogs 1α(OH)D3 and 25(OH)D3 exhibit cholesterol lowering properties upon activation to 1,25(OH)2 D3 : 1α(OH)D3 is rapidly activated by liver enzymes and 25(OH)D3 is slowly activated by renal Cyp27b1 in mouse.
Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (Gsk3β [Gsk3b]) is a ubiquitously expressed kinase with distinctive functions in different types of cells. Although its roles in regulating innate immune activation and ischaemia and reperfusion injuries (IRIs) have been well documented, the underlying mechanisms remain ambiguous, in part because of the lack of cell-specific tools in vivo.
We created a myeloid-specific Gsk3b knockout (KO) strain to study the function of Gsk3β in macrophages in a murine liver partial warm ischaemia model.
Compared with controls, myeloid Gsk3b KO mice were protected from IRI, with diminished proinflammatory but enhanced anti-inflammatory immune responses in livers. In bone marrow-derived macrophages, Gsk3β deficiency resulted in an early reduction of Tnf gene transcription but sustained increase of Il10 gene transcription on Toll-like receptor 4 stimulation in vitro. These effects were associated with enhanced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, which led to an accelerated and higher level of induction of the novel innate immune negative regulator small heterodimer partner (SHP [Nr0b2]). The regulatory function of Gsk3β on AMPK activation and SHP induction was confirmed in wild-type bone marrow-derived macrophages with a Gsk3 inhibitor. Furthermore, we found that this immune regulatory mechanism was independent of Gsk3β Ser9 phosphorylation and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt signalling pathway. In vivo, myeloid Gsk3β deficiency facilitated SHP upregulation by ischaemia-reperfusion in liver macrophages. Treatment of Gsk3b KO mice with either AMPK inhibitor or SHP small interfering RNA before the onset of liver ischaemia restored liver proinflammatory immune activation and IRI in these otherwise protected hosts. Additionally, pharmacological activation of AMPK protected wild-type mice from liver IRI, with reduced proinflammatory immune activation. Inhibition of the AMPK-SHP pathway by liver ischaemia was demonstrated in tumour resection patients.
Gsk3β promotes innate proinflammatory immune activation by restraining AMPK activation.
Glycogen synthase kinase 3β promotes macrophage inflammatory activation by inhibiting the immune regulatory signalling of AMP-activated protein kinase and the induction of small heterodimer partner. Therefore, therapeutic targeting of glycogen synthase kinase 3β enhances innate immune regulation and protects liver from ischaemia and reperfusion injury.
During middle age, women are less susceptible to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) than men. Thus, we investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms behind these sexual differences using an established rat model of NASH. Mature female and male stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive 5/Dmcr rats were fed control or high-fat-cholesterol (HFC) diets for 2, 8, and 14 weeks. Although HFC-induced hepatic fibrosis was markedly less severe in females than in males, only minor gender differences were observed in expression levels of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP)7A1, CYP8B1 CYP27A1, and CYP7B1, and multidrug resistance-associated protein 3, and bile salt export pump, which are involved in fibrosis-related bile acid (BA) kinetics. However, the BA detoxification-related enzymes UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and sulfotransferase (SULT) 2A1, and the nuclear receptors constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR), were strongly suppressed in HFC-fed males, and were only slightly changed in HFC-diet fed females. Expression levels of the farnesoid X receptor and its small heterodimer partner were similarly regulated in a gender-dependent fashion following HFC feeding. Hence, the pronounced female resistance to HFC-induced liver damage likely reflects sustained expression of the nuclear receptors CAR and PXR and the BA detoxification enzymes UGT and SULT.
We previously reported that alcohol drinkers with and without cirrhosis showed a significant increase in fecal bile acid secretion compared to nondrinkers. We hypothesized this may be due to activation by alcohol of hepatic cyclic adenosine monophosphate responsive element-binding protein 3-like protein 3 (CREBH), which induces cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1). Alternatively, the gut microbiota composition in the absence of alcohol might increase bile acid synthesis by up-regulating Cyp7a1. To test this hypothesis, we humanized germ-free (GF) mice with stool from healthy human subjects (Ctrl-Hum), human subjects with cirrhosis (Cirr-Hum), and human subjects with cirrhosis and active alcoholism (Alc-Hum). All animals were fed a normal chow diet, and none demonstrated cirrhosis. Both hepatic Cyp7a1 and sterol 12α-hydroxylase (Cyp8b1) messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were significantly induced in the Alc-Hum and Ctrl-Hum mice but not in the Cirr-Hum mice or GF mice. Liver bile acid concentration was correspondingly increased in the Alc-Hum mice despite fibroblast growth factor 15, fibroblast growth receptor 4, and small heterodimer partner mRNA levels being significantly induced in the large bowel and liver of the Ctrl-Hum mice and Alc-Hum mice but not in the Cirr-Hum mice or GF mice. This suggests that the normal pathways of Cyp7a1 repression were activated in the Alc-Hum mice and Ctrl-Hum mice. CREBH mRNA was significantly induced only in the Ctrl-Hum mice and Alc-Hum mice, possibly indicating that the gut microbiota up-regulate CREBH and induce bile acid synthesis genes. Analysis of stool bile acids showed that the microbiota of the Cirr-Hum and Alc-Hum mice had a greater ability to deconjugate and 7α-dehydroxylate primary bile acids compared to the microbiota of the Cirr-Hum mice. 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing of the gut microbiota showed that the relative abundance of taxa that 7-α dehydroxylate primary bile acids was higher in the Ctrl-Hum and Alc-Hum groups. Conclusion: The composition of gut microbiota influences the regulation of the rate-limiting enzymes in bile acid synthesis in the liver. (Hepatology Communications 2017;1:61-70).
Bile acids (BAs), the most important endogenous and signaling molecules regulate the target transporters and enzymes at transcriptional level, participate in a wide variety of processes throughout the entire gastrointestinal tract to orchestrate homeostasis in vivo. BAs and their metabolism and transportation appear to follow the clear circadian rhythms, and they are recently proposed also as the potential chronobiological signals that can affect the molecular clock mechanism. Cholecystectomy are believed to affect the circadian rhythms of BAs and the relevant enterohepatic transporters and enzymes systems and their regulatory signaling pathways, for the reason that the circadian cycle of gallbladder filling and emptying play a pivotal role in controlling the flow of bile into the intestine and the enterohepatic circulation of BAs. Here, in the present study, the circadian rhythms about BAs concentration and composition and the mRNA expression of genes involved in BAs transportation, metabolism and regulation in liver and ileum of mice with or without gallbladder were evaluated. As a result, it has been found that, mice with gallbladder exhibited significant and distinct circadian oscillations in BAs concentration, mRNA expression of enterohepatic transporters and enzymes systems and farnesoid X receptor-mediated regulatory pathways both in liver and ileum during gallbladder emptying period (1:00 AM and 1:00 PM), despite food was restricted during these periods; the circadian rhythmicity of BAs pool and hepatic and ileal BAs diminished but the BAs composition had no significant alteration in liver and ileum after cholecystectomy as compared with sham-operated mice; in parallel to the alteration of BAs levels in liver and ileum after cholecystectomy, the day/night circadian oscillations in the mRNA expression of the relevant transporting and metabolic genes and the farnesoid X receptor signaling pathway-mediated â€œintestine-liverâ€ regulatory axis also shifted. In conclusion, the BAs concentration and the corresponding genes exhibit significant circadian rhythms in mice with gallbladder, and the circadian oscillations of most of the investigation factors are flattened and altered following by cholecystectomy, which could mainly ascribe to the disappearance of the filling and emptying cycle of gallbladder and might result in pathological states or drug chronopharmacology alternation. We expect that this study would provide a cue for patients with cholecystectomy.

Activation of the bile acid (BA) receptors farnesoid X receptor (FXR) or G protein-coupled bile acid receptor (GPBAR1; TGR5) improves metabolic homeostasis. In this study, we aim to determine the impact of pharmacological activation of bile acid receptors by INT-767 on reversal of diet-induced metabolic disorders, and the relative contribution of FXR vs. TGR5 to INT-767's effects on metabolic parameters.
Wild-type (WT), Tgr5-/-, Fxr-/-, Apoe-/- and Shp-/- mice were used to investigate whether and how BA receptor activation by INT-767, a semisynthetic agonist for both FXR and TGR5, could reverse diet-induced metabolic disorders.
INT-767 reversed HFD-induced obesity dependent on activation of both TGR5 and FXR and also reversed the development of atherosclerosis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Mechanistically, INT-767 improved hypercholesterolemia by activation of FXR and induced thermogenic genes via activation of TGR5 and/or FXR. Furthermore, INT-767 inhibited several lipogenic genes and de novo lipogenesis in the liver via activation of FXR. We identified peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (CEBPα) as novel FXR-regulated genes. FXR inhibited PPARγ expression by inducing small heterodimer partner (SHP) whereas the inhibition of CEBPα by FXR was SHP-independent.
BA receptor activation can reverse obesity, NAFLD, and atherosclerosis by specific activation of FXR or TGR5. Our data suggest that, compared to activation of FXR or TGR5 only, dual activation of both FXR and TGR5 is a more attractive strategy for treatment of common metabolic disorders.
While Myc is an essential regulator of growth in normal cells, it is also frequently associated with cancer progression, therapy-resistance and lethal outcomes in most human cancers. In prostate cancer (PCa), Myc transcription factors are implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of the full spectrum of PCa, from adenocarcinoma to advanced castration-resistant and neuroendocrine phenotypes. Though a high-value therapeutic target, clinically approved anti-Myc drugs have yet to be discovered. To elicit its oncogenic effects, Myc must form a heterodimer with its partner Max, which together bind DNA and activate transcription of a spectrum of target genes that promote cell growth, proliferation, metabolism, and apoptosis while blocking differentiation. In this study, we identified a binding site on the DNA-binding domain of the structurally ordered Myc-Max complex and employed a computer-aided rational drug discovery approach to identify small molecules that effectively inhibit Myc-Max functionality. A large-scale virtual screening protocol implementing structure-based methodologies was utilized to select a set of top-ranked compounds that were subsequently evaluated experimentally and characterized mechanistically for their ability to inhibit Myc-Max transcriptional activity and subsequent downstream functions, to reduce viability in PCa cell lines, disrupt protein-DNA interactions and to induce apoptosis as their mechanism of action. Among compounds identified that effectively inhibit Myc-Max activity with low to mid-micromolar range potency and no or minimal generic cytotoxicity, VPC-70067, a close analog of the previously identified Myc inhibitor 10058-F4, served as proof-of-concept that our in silico drug discovery strategy performed as expected. Compound VPC-70063, of a chemically different scaffold, was the best performer in a panel of in vitro assays, and the forerunner for future hit-to-lead optimization efforts. These findings lay a foundation for developing more potent, specific and clinically optimized Myc-Max inhibitors that may serve as promising therapeutics, alone or in combination with current anti-cancer treatments, for treatment of specific phenotypes or heterogeneous tumors.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is frequently accompanied by fatty liver disease. Lipid accumulation within the liver is considered as one of the risk factors for insulin resistance. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is used to treat liver dysfunction; however, the effect and mechanism of HGF on hepatic lipid metabolism are still not fully understood.
Male C57BL/6 mice were induced with a high-fat diet for 12 weeks, followed by a 4-week treatment of HGF or vehicle saline. The levels of fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance were calculated for insulin sensitivity. Biochemical plasma parameters were also measured to assess the effect of HGF on lipid accumulation. Additionally, genes in the lipid metabolism pathway were evaluated in palmitic acid-treated HepG2 cells and high-fat diet mice.
HGF treatment significantly decreased the levels of fasting blood glucose, hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol contents. Additionally, HGF-regulated expression levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c/fatty acid synthase, peroxidase proliferator-activated receptor-α, and upstream nuclear receptors, such as farnesoid X receptor and small heterodimer partner. Furthermore, c-Met inhibitor could partially reverse the effects of HGF.
HGF treatment can ameliorate hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis through regulation of lipid metabolism. These effects might occur through farnesoid X receptor-small heterodimer partner axis-dependent transcriptional activity.
β-Carotene-15, 15'-oxygenase (BCO1) and β-carotene-9', 10'-oxygenase (BCO2) are essential enzymes in carotenoid metabolism. While BCO1/BCO2 polymorphisms have been associated with alterations to human and animal carotenoid levels, experimental studies have suggested that BCO1 and BCO2 may have specific physiological functions beyond the cleavage of carotenoids. In the present study, we investigated the effect of ablation of both BCO1/BCO2 in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its underlying molecular mechanism(s). BCO1/BCO2 double knock out (DKO) mice developed hepatic steatosis (8/8) and had significantly higher levels of hepatic and plasma triglyceride and total cholesterol compared to WT (0/8). Hepatic changes in the BCO1/BCO2 DKO mice were associated with significant: 1) increases in lipogenesis markers, and decreases in fatty acid β-oxidation markers; 2) upregulation of cholesterol metabolism markers; 3) alterations to microRNAs related to TG accumulation and cholesterol metabolism; 4) increases in an hepatic oxidative stress marker (HO-1) but decreases in anti-oxidant enzymes; and 5) decreases in farnesoid X receptor (FXR), small heterodimer partner (SHP), and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). The present study provided novel experimental evidence that BCO1 and BCO2 could play a significant role in maintaining normal hepatic lipid and cholesterol homeostasis, potentially through the regulation of the FXR/miR-34a/SIRT1 pathway.
UL148 is a viral endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident glycoprotein that contributes to human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) cell tropism. The influence of UL148 on tropism correlates with its potential to promote the expression of glycoprotein O (gO), a viral envelope glycoprotein that participates in a heterotrimeric complex with glycoproteins H and L that is required for infectivity. In an effort to gain insight into the mechanism, we used mass spectrometry to identify proteins that coimmunoprecipitate from infected cells with UL148. This approach led us to identify an interaction between UL148 and SEL1L, a factor that plays key roles in ER-associated degradation (ERAD). In pulse-chase experiments, gO was less stable in cells infected with UL148-null mutant HCMV than during wild-type infection, suggesting a potential functional relevance for the interaction with SEL1L. To investigate whether UL148 regulates gO abundance by influencing ERAD, small interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing of either SEL1L or its partner, Hrd1, was carried out in the context of infection. Knockdown of these ERAD factors strongly enhanced levels of gO but not other viral glycoproteins, and the effect was amplified in the presence of UL148. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of ERAD showed similar results. Silencing of SEL1L during infection also stabilized an interaction of gO with the ER lectin OS-9, which likewise suggests that gO is an ERAD substrate. Taken together, our results identify an intriguing interaction of UL148 with the ERAD machinery and demonstrate that gO behaves as a constitutive ERAD substrate during infection. These findings have implications for understanding the regulation of HCMV cell tropism.IMPORTANCE Viral glycoproteins in large part determine the cell types that an enveloped virus can infect and hence play crucial roles in transmission and pathogenesis. The glycoprotein H/L heterodimer (gH/gL) is part of the conserved membrane fusion machinery that all herpesviruses use to enter cells. In human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), gH/gL participates in alternative complexes in virions, one of which is a trimer of gH/gL with glycoprotein O (gO). Here, we show that gO is constitutively degraded during infection by the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway and that UL148, a viral factor that regulates HCMV cell tropism, interacts with the ERAD machinery and slows gO decay. Since gO is required for cell-free virus to enter new host cells but dispensable for cell-associated spread that resists antibody neutralization, our findings imply that the posttranslational instability of a viral glycoprotein provides a basis for viral mechanisms to modulate tropism and spread.
Under fasting conditions, activation of several hepatic genes sets the stage for gluconeogenesis in the liver. cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) are essential for this transcriptional induction of gluconeogenic genes. PGC-1α induction is mediated by activation of a CREB/CRTC2 signaling complex, and recent findings have revealed that small heterodimer partner-interacting leucine zipper protein (SMILE), a member of the CREB/ATF family of basic region-leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors, is an insulin-inducible corepressor that decreases PGC-1α expression and abrogates its stimulatory effect on hepatic gluconeogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism whereby SMILE suppresses PGC-1α expression is unknown. Here, we investigated SMILE's effects on the CREB/CRTC2 signaling pathway and glucose metabolism. We found that SMILE significantly inhibits CREB/CRTC2-induced PGC-1α expression by interacting with and disrupting the CREB/CRTC2 complex. Consequently, SMILE decreased PGC-1α-induced hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression. Furthermore, SMILE inhibited CREB/CRTC2-induced phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) gene expression by directly repressing the expression of these genes and by indirectly inhibiting the expression of PGC-1α via CREB/CRTC2 repression. Indeed, enhanced gluconeogenesis and circulating blood glucose levels in mice injected with an adenovirus construct containing a constitutively active CRTC2 variant (CRTC2-S171A) were significantly reduced by WT SMILE, but not by leucine zipper-mutated SMILE. These results reveal that SMILE represses CREB/CRTC2-induced PGC-1α expression, an insight that may help inform potential therapeutic approaches targeting PGC-1α-mediated regulation of hepatic glucose metabolism.
Activation of farnesoid X receptor (Fxr, Nr1h4) is a major mechanism in suppressing bile-acid synthesis by reducing the expression levels of genes encoding key bile-acid synthetic enzymes (e.g., cytochrome P450 [CYP]7A1/Cyp7a1 and CYP8B1/Cyp8b1). FXR-mediated induction of hepatic small heterodimer partner (SHP/Shp, Nr0b2) and intestinal fibroblast growth factor 15 (Fgf15; FGF19 in humans) has been shown to be responsible for this suppression. However, the exact contribution of Shp/Fgf15 to this suppression, and the associated cell-signaling pathway, is unclear. By using novel genetically modified mice, the current study showed that the intestinal Fxr/Fgf15 pathway was critical for suppressing both Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1 gene expression, but the liver Fxr/Shp pathway was important for suppressing Cyp8b1 gene expression and had a minor role in suppressing Cyp7a1 gene expression. Furthermore, in vivo administration of Fgf15 protein to mice led to a strong activation of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) and, to a smaller degree, Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in the liver. In addition, deficiency of either the ERK or JNK pathway in mouse livers reduced the basal, but not the Fgf15-mediated, suppression of Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1 gene expression. However, deficiency of both ERK and JNK pathways prevented Fgf15-mediated suppression of Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1 gene expression.
The current study clearly elucidates the underlying molecular mechanism of hepatic versus intestinal Fxr in regulating the expression of genes critical for bile-acid synthesis and hydrophobicity in the liver.
The small/short heterodimer partner (SHP, NR0B2) is a nuclear receptor corepressor lacking a DNA binding domain. SHP is induced by bile acid-activated farnesoid X receptor (FXR) resulting in CYP7A1 gene suppression. In contrast, Pregnane X receptor (PXR) activation by its ligands was recently suggested to inhibit SHP gene transactivation to maximize the induction of PXR target genes. However, there are also conflicting reports in literature whether PXR or rodent Pxr activation down-regulates SHP/Shp expression. Moreover, the PXR-mediated regulation of the SHP gene has been studied only at the SHP mRNA and transactivation (gene reporter assay) levels. In this study, we studied the effect of rifampicin, a prototype PXR ligand, on SHP mRNA, and protein expression in three primary human hepatocyte cultures. We found that SHP mRNA is not systematically down-regulated in hepatocyte in culture after 24 h treatment with rifampicin. Consistently, we did not observe down-regulation of SHP protein in primary human hepatocytes after 24 and 48 h of incubation with rifampicin. We can conclude that although we observed slight down-regulation of SHP mRNA and protein in several hepatocyte preparations, the phenomenon is unlikely critical for PXR-mediated induction of its target genes.
Genes involved in the physiological control of energy and triglyceride synthesis, such as malic enzyme 1, NADP(+)-dependent, cytosolic (ME1) and nuclear receptor subfamily 0, group B, member 2 (NR0B2), are key candidates that may have effects on meat and carcass quality traits. These genes were sequenced in Aberdeen Angus beef cattle, and the possibility of associations between SNPs and economically important carcass and meat quality traits was tested. Six novel SNPs, five in ME1 and one in NR0B2, were identified. A SNP in exon eight of ME1 resulted in a non-synonymous amino acid change from valine to isoleucine. Phenotypic data were recorded on 536 commercial Aberdeen Angus-cross beef cattle, which comprised 28 carcass quality, tenderness and sensory traits. The majority of the SNPs were associated with at least one of these traits, including an association between the NR0B2 SNP and fat class, and associations between at least one of the ME1 SNPs and eye muscle area, sirloin weight before maturation, sirloin steak tail length, and juiciness.
Diethylnitrosamine (DEN) is a hepatic procarcinogen which is frequently used as an inducer of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in mice. Although mice after DEN exposure are among the most widely used models for liver tumorigenesis, a detailed, mechanistic characterization of the longitudinal changes in the respective tumor genomes has never been performed. Here we established the chronological order of genetic alterations during DEN carcinogenesis by examining mice at different points in time. Tumor samples were isolated by laser microdissection and subjected to array-comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) and sequencing analysis. Chromosomal gains and losses were observed in tumors by week 32 and increased significantly by week 56. Loss of distal chromosome 4q, including the tumor suppressors Runx3 and Nr0b2/Shp, was a frequent early event and persisted during all tumor stages. Surprisingly, sequencing revealed that β-catenin mutations occurred late and were clearly preceded by chromosomal instability. Thus, contrary to common belief, β-catenin mutations and activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway are not involved in tumor initiation in this model of chemical hepatocarcinogenesis.
Our study suggests that the majority of the current knowledge about genomic changes in HCC is based on advanced tumor lesions and that systematic analyses of the chronologic order including early lesions may reveal new, unexpected findings.
Small heterodimer partner (SHP, NR0B2) is a unique member of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily that contains the dimerization and ligand-binding domain found in other family members, but lacks the conserved DNA-binding domain. The ability of SHP to bind directly to multiple NRs is crucial for its physiological function as a transcriptional inhibitor of gene expression. A wide variety of interacting partners for SHP have been identified, indicating the potential for SHP to regulate an array of genes in different biological pathways. In this review, we summarize studies concerning the structure and target genes of SHP and discuss recent progress in understanding the function of SHP in bile acid, cholesterol, triglyceride, glucose, and drug metabolism. In addition, we review the regulatory role of SHP in microRNA (miRNA) regulation, liver fibrosis and cancer progression. The fact that SHP controls a complex set of genes in multiple metabolic pathways suggests the intriguing possibility of developing new therapeutics for metabolic diseases, including fatty liver, dyslipidemia and obesity, by regulating SHP with small molecules. To achieve this goal, more progress regarding SHP ligands and protein structure will be required. Besides its metabolic regulatory function, studies by us and other groups provide strong evidence that SHP plays a critical role in the development of cancer, particularly liver and breast cancer. An increased understanding of the fundamental mechanisms by which SHP regulates the development of cancers will be critical in applying knowledge of SHP in diagnostic, therapeutic or preventive strategies for specific cancers. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Translating nuclear receptors from health to disease.
Nuclear receptors (NRs) play pivotal roles in cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and homeostasis. Recent progress demonstrates that NR is tightly linked to human disease such as cancer, diabetes and obesity. Here we explore NR expression profiles in human tissue using systematic approaches. NR gene profiles reveal that individual NR has its own gene expression signature depending on tissue type. Of many organs, NRs expression is enriched in liver. Expression of many NRs was significantly changed in liver cancer. Notably, NR0B2/SHP expression level was significantly decreased in human liver cancer but not in normal liver. In addition, expression of SHP is well associated with good prognosis. SHP gene network analysis based on microarray data in liver cancer shows that SHP regulates cell proliferation and metabolism related gene sets. Our systematic approaches suggest that loss of SHP expression in liver might be key genetic events during hepatocarcinogenesis.
As a unique nuclear receptor with only ligand-binding but no DNA-binding domain, small heterodimer partner (SHP) interacts with many transcription factors to inhibit their function. However, the regulation of SHP expression is not well understood. SHP is highly expressed in the liver, and previous studies have shown farnesoid X receptor (FXR) highly induces SHP by binding to a FXR response element (FXRRE) in the promoter of the Nr0b2 gene, which encodes SHP. The FXR-SHP pathway is critical in maintaining bile acid and fatty acid homeostasis. After genome-wide FXR binding by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled to massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq), a novel FXRRE was found in the 3'-enhancer region of the Nr0b2 gene. This downstream inverted repeat separated by one nucleotide is highly conserved throughout mammalian species. We hypothesized that this downstream FXRRE is functional and may mediate a head-to-tail chromatin looping by interacting with the proximal promoter FRXRE to increase SHP transcription efficiency. In the current study, a ChIP-quantitative PCR assay revealed FXR strongly bound to this downstream FXRRE in mouse livers. The downstream FXRRE is important for FXR-mediated transcriptional activation revealed by luciferase gene transcription activation, as well as by deletion and site-directed mutagenesis. The chromatin conformation capture assay was used to detect chromatin looping, and the result confirmed the two FXRREs located in the Nr0b2 promoter and downstream enhancer interacted to form a head-to-tail chromatin loop. To date, the head-to-tail chromatin looping has not been reported in the liver. In conclusion, our results suggest a mechanism by which activation of FXR efficiently induces SHP transcription is through head-to-tail chromatin looping.
Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is a prototypical polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) found in combustion processes. Cytochrome P450 1A1 and 1B1 enzymes (CYP1A1 and CYP1B1) can both detoxify PAHs and activate them to cancer-causing reactive intermediates. Following high dosage of oral BaP (125 mg/kg/day), ablation of the mouse Cyp1a1 gene causes immunosuppression and death within ∼28 days, whereas Cyp1(+/+) wild-type mice remain healthy for &gt;12 months on this regimen. In this study, male Cyp1(+/+) wild-type, Cyp1a1(-/-) and Cyp1b1(-/-) single-knockout and Cyp1a1/1b1(-/-) double-knockout mice received a lower dose (12.5 mg/kg/day) of oral BaP. Tissues from 16 different organs-including proximal small intestine (PSI), liver and preputial gland duct (PGD)-were evaluated; microarray cDNA expression and &gt;30 mRNA levels were measured. Cyp1a1(-/-) mice revealed markedly increased CYP1B1 mRNA levels in the PSI, and between 8 and 12 weeks developed unique PSI adenomas and adenocarcinomas. Cyp1a1/1b1(-/-) mice showed no PSI tumors but instead developed squamous cell carcinoma of the PGD. Cyp1(+/+) and Cyp1b1(-/-) mice remained healthy with no remarkable abnormalities in any tissue examined. PSI adenocarcinomas exhibited striking upregulation of the Xist gene, suggesting epigenetic silencing of specific genes on the Y-chromosome; the Rab30 oncogene was upregulated; the Nr0b2 tumor suppressor gene was downregulated; paradoxical overexpression of numerous immunoglobulin kappa- and heavy-chain variable genes was found-although the adenocarcinoma showed no immunohistochemical evidence of being lymphatic in origin. This oral BaP mouse paradigm represents an example of "gene-environment interactions" in which the same exposure of carcinogen results in altered target organ and tumor type, as a function of just 1 or 2 globally absent genes.
Studies in rodents have shown that male sexual function can be disrupted by fetal or neonatal administration of compounds that alter endocrine homeostasis, such as the synthetic nonsteroidal estrogen diethylstilbestrol (DES). Although the molecular basis for this effect remains unknown, estrogen receptors likely play a critical role in mediating DES-induced infertility. Recently, we showed that the orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (Nr0b2), which is both a target gene and a transcriptional repressor of estrogen receptors, controls testicular function by regulating germ cell entry into meiosis and testosterone synthesis. We therefore hypothesized that some of the harmful effects of DES on testes could be mediated through Nr0b2. Here, we present data demonstrating that Nr0b2 deficiency protected mice against the negative effects of DES on testis development and function. During postnatal development, Nr0b2-null mice were resistant to DES-mediated inhibition of germ cell differentiation, which may be the result of interference by Nr0b2 with retinoid signals that control meiosis. Adult Nr0b2-null male mice were also protected against the effects of DES; however, we suggest that this phenomenon was due to the removal of the repressive effects of Nr0b2 on steroidogenesis. Together, these data demonstrate that Nr0b2 plays a critical role in the pathophysiological changes induced by DES in the mouse testis.
The farnesoid X receptor/retinoid X receptor-alpha (FXR/RXRalpha) complex regulates bile salt homeostasis, in part by modulating transcription of the bile salt export pump (BSEP/ABCB11) and small heterodimer partner (SHP/NR0B2). FXR is activated by bile salts, RXRalpha by the vitamin A derivative 9-cis retinoic acid (9cRA). Cholestasis is associated with vitamin A malabsorption. Therefore, we evaluated the role of vitamin A/9cRA in the expression of human and mouse bile salt export pump (hBSEP/mBsep), small heterodimer partner (hSHP/mShp), and mouse sodium-dependent taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (mNtcp). HBSEP and hSHP transcription were analyzed in FXR/RXRalpha-transfected HepG2 cells exposed to chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and/or 9cRA. BSEP promoter activity was determined by luciferase reporter assays, DNA-binding of FXR and RXRalpha by pull-down assays. Serum bile salt levels and hepatic expression of Bsep, Shp, and Ntcp were determined in vitamin A-deficient (VAD)/cholic acid (CA)-fed C57BL/6J mice. Results indicated that 9cRA strongly repressed the CDCA-induced BSEP transcription in HepG2 cells, whereas it super-induced SHP transcription; 9cRA reduced DNA-binding of FXR and RXRalpha. The 9cRA repressed the CDCA-induced BSEP promoter activity irrespective of the exact sequence of the FXR-binding site. In vivo, highest Bsep messenger RNA (mRNA), and protein expression was observed in CA-fed VAD mice. Shp transcription was highest in CA-fed vitamin A-sufficient mice. Ntcp protein expression was strongly reduced in CA-fed VAD mice, whereas mRNA levels were normal. CA-fed control and VAD mice had similarly increased serum bile salt levels.
We showed that 9cRA has opposite effects on bile salt-activated transcription of FXR/RXRalpha target genes. Vitamin A deficiency in CA-fed mice leads to high BSEP expression. Clearance of serum bile salts may, however, be limited because of post-transcriptional reduction of Ntcp. The molecular effects of vitamin A supplementation during cholestasis need further analysis to predict a therapeutic effect.
Mutations in the small heterodimer partner gene (NR0B2; alias SHP) are associated with high birth weight and mild obesity in Japanese children. SHP mutations may also be associated with later obesity and insulin resistance syndrome that induces diabetes. To investigate this possibility, the prevalence of SHP mutations in Japanese with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus and the functional properties of the mutant proteins were evaluated. Direct sequencing of two exons and flanking sequences of SHP in 805 diabetic patients and 752 non-diabetic controls identified 15 different mutations in 44 subjects, including 6 novel mutations. Functional analyses of the mutant proteins revealed significantly reduced activity of nine of the mutations. Mutations with reduced activity were found in 19 patients (2.4%) in the diabetic group and in 6 subjects (0.8%) in the control group. The frequency difference between DM and control subjects adjusted for sex and age was statistically significant (P=0.029, odds ratio 2.67, 95% CI 1.05-6.81, 1-beta=0.91). We conclude that SHP mutations associated with mild obesity in childhood increase susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in later life in Japanese.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) are genomically encoded small approximately 22 nt RNA molecules that have been shown to mediate translational repression of target mRNAs involved in cellular proliferation, differentiation and death. Despite intensive studies on their physiological and pathological functions, the molecular mechanism of how miRNA gene transcription is regulated remains largely unknown. Microarray profiling revealed 21 miRNAs clustered on chromosome 12, including miR-433 and miR-127, that were co-upregulated in small heterodimer partner (SHP, NR0B2) SHP knockouts (SHP(-/-)) liver. Gene cloning revealed that the 3'-coding region of pri-miR-433 served as the promoter region of pri-miR-127. Estrogen related receptor (ERRgamma, NR3B3) robustly activated miR-433 and miR-127 promoter reporters through ERRE, which was transrepressed by SHP. The strong elevation of miR-433 and miR-127 in Hepa-1 cells correlated with the down-regulation of SHP and up-regulation of ERRgamma. Ectopic expression of ERRgamma induced miR-433 and miR-127 expression, which was repressed by SHP coexpression. In contrast, knockdown ERRgamma decreased miR-433 and miR-127 expression. In addition, the ERRgamma agonist GSK4716 induced miR-433 and miR-127 expression both in vitro and in vivo, respectively. In summary, the coupled miR-433 and miR-127 genes were transcribed from independent promoters regulated by nuclear receptors ERRgamma/SHP in a compact space by using overlapping genomic regions.
Hypertriglyceridemia is an independent risk factor in the development of cardiovascular diseases, and we have previously reported that oral administration of a grape seed procyanidin extract (GSPE) drastically decreases plasma levels of triglycerides (TG) and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) in normolipidemic rats, with a concomitant induction in the hepatic expression of the nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (NR0B2/SHP). Our objective in this study was to elucidate whether SHP is the mediator of the reduction of TG-rich ApoB-containing lipoproteins triggered by GSPE. We show that GSPE inhibited TG and ApoB secretion in human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells and had and hypotriglyceridemic effect in wild-type mouse. The TG-lowering action of GSPE was abolished in HepG2 cells transfected with a SHP-specific siRNA and in a SHP-null mouse. Moreover, in mouse liver, GSPE downregulated several lipogenic genes, including steroid response element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), and upregulated carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A (CPT-1A) and apolipoprotein A5 (ApoA5), in a SHP-dependent manner. In HepG2 cells GSPE also inhibited ApoB secretion, but in a SHP-independent manner. In conclusion, SHP is a key mediator of the hypotriglyceridemic response triggered by GSPE. This novel signaling pathway of procyanidins through SHP may be relevant to explain the health effects ascribed to the regular consumption of dietary flavonoids.
A global gene expression profiling specific to the early process of tumor promotion by fenbendazole (FB) or phenobarbital (PB) in a rat two-stage hepatocarcinogenesis model revealed 33 genes to show altered expression in common with both chemicals. The immunohistochemical distribution of transferrin receptor (Tfrc), nuclear receptor subfamily 0, group B, member 2 (Nr0b2) and minichromosome maintenance deficient 6 (MCM6), included in the altered expression profile, were therefore examined in FB- and PB-induced proliferative lesions at both early and late stages of tumor promotion. In addition, immunoexpression of transforming growth factor beta receptor (TGFbetaR) I, TGFbetaRII, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and phosphorylated phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (pPTEN) was also examined. In the early stage, most hepatocellular foci positive for glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P) showed co-expression of TGFbetaRI and lack of PTEN and pPTEN, some GST-P-positive foci co-expressing Tfrc and Nr0b2. In the late stage, selective expression of TGFbetaRI, but not TGFbetaRII, was also observed in many adenomas and carcinomas consistently expressing GST-P. Nr0b2 was variably expressed in the proliferative lesions, irrespective of the carcinogenic stage. Like the GST-P-positive foci, adenomas and carcinomas consistently lacked PTEN and pPTEN. Expression of Tfrc and MCM6 was increased in parallel with the carcinogenic stage. In conclusion, loss of PTEN and dysregulation of transforming growth factor beta signaling can be considered to be involved in rat hepatocarcinogenesis from early stages. Selective expression of Tfrc in proliferative lesions suggests an involvement of changes in iron homeostasis during the process of tumor promotion/progression driven by FB or PB.
Aberrant hypermethylation of promoter regions in cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpG) islands has been shown to be associated with transcriptional silencing of tumor-suppressor genes in many cancers. This study evaluated the methylation profile and the tumor-suppressive function of the small heterodimer partner (SHP, NR0B2) in the development of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Human HCC pathologic specimens and cell lines were used as model systems in this study.
The expression of SHP is diminished in HCC pathologic specimens and cell lines by epigenetic silencing owing to SHP promoter hypermethylation. In vitro methylation decreased SHP promoter transactivation and nuclear receptor LRH-1 binding, an event that was reversed by demethylation. Overexpression of SHP inhibited HCC foci formation, arrested HCC tumor growth in xenografted nude mice, and increased the sensitivity of HCC cells to apoptotic stimuli. Further analysis of a total of 19 normal liver and 57 HCC specimens showed that down-regulation of SHP gene expression may be a common denominator of HCC.
We propose that SHP functions as a novel tumor suppressor in the development of HCC. These findings provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms leading to this common cancer and may have both diagnostic and therapeutic applications.
The nuclear receptors are a large family of eukaryotic transcription factors that constitute major pharmacological targets. They exert their combinatorial control through homotypic heterodimerisation. Elucidation of this dimerisation network is vital in order to understand the complex dynamics and potential cross-talk involved.
Phylogeny, protein-protein interactions, protein-DNA interactions and gene expression data have been integrated to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date description of the topology and properties of the nuclear receptor interaction network in humans. We discriminate between DNA-binding and non-DNA-binding dimers, and provide a comprehensive interaction map, that identifies potential cross-talk between the various pathways of nuclear receptors.
We infer that the topology of this network is hub-based, and much more connected than previously thought. The hub-based topology of the network and the wide tissue expression pattern of NRs create a highly competitive environment for the common heterodimerising partners. Furthermore, a significant number of negative feedback loops is present, with the hub protein SHP [NR0B2] playing a major role. We also compare the evolution, topology and properties of the nuclear receptor network with the hub-based dimerisation network of the bHLH transcription factors in order to identify both unique themes and ubiquitous properties in gene regulation. In terms of methodology, we conclude that such a comprehensive picture can only be assembled by semi-automated text-mining, manual curation and integration of data from various sources.
It has been suggested that the structure and function of nuclear receptors are evolutionally conserved. Here, we compare the molecular functions of the nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) small heterodimer partner (nSHP/NR0B2) and the Dosage-sensitive sex reversal AHC critical region on X chromosome gene 1 (nDAX-1/NR0B1) with those of human SHP and DAX-1 (hSHP and hDAX-1, respectively). We found that, upon transient cotransfection of human cells, nDAX-1 repressed the activity of tilapia SF-1 (nSF-1) but not that of human SF-1, although the physical interaction with human SF-1 was retained. Similarly, nSHP repressed the activity of nSF-1, whereas hSHP did not, pointing to divergent evolution of SHP/SF-1 in fish and human. We thus propose that the repressive functions of SHP and DAX-1 have been conserved in fish and mammals although with different transcriptional targets and mechanisms. These differences provide new insights into the physiological diversification of atypical orphan nuclear receptors during vertebrate evolution.
Prolonged elevations of glucose concentration have deleterious effects on beta-cell function. One of the hallmarks of such glucotoxicity is a reduction in insulin gene expression, resulting from decreased insulin promoter activity. Small heterodimer partner (SHP; NR0B2) is an atypical orphan nuclear receptor that inhibits nuclear receptor signaling in diverse metabolic pathways. In this study, we found that sustained culture of INS-1 cells at high glucose concentrations leads to an increase in SHP mRNA expression, followed by a decrease in insulin gene expression. Inhibition of endogenous SHP gene expression by small interfering RNA partially restored high-glucose-induced suppression of the insulin gene. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SHP in INS-1 cells impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion as well as insulin gene expression. SHP downregulates insulin gene expression via two mechanisms: by downregulating PDX-1 and MafA gene expression and by inhibiting p300-mediated pancreatic duodenal homeobox factor 1-and BETA2-dependent transcriptional activity from the insulin promoter. Finally, the pancreatic islets of diabetic OLETF rats express SHP mRNA at higher levels than the islets from LETO rats. These results collectively suggest that SHP plays an important role in the development of beta-cell dysfunction induced by glucotoxicity.
6-[3-(1-adamantyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl]-2-naphthalenecarboxylic acid (CD437/AHPN) and 4-[3-(1-adamantyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl]-3-chlorocinnamic acid (3-Cl-AHPC/MM002) are inducers of apoptosis of malignant cells both in vitro and in vivo. Numerous mechanisms have been proposed for how these compounds exert this effect. This report shows that AHPN/3-Cl-AHPC binds specifically to the orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP; NR0B2), and this binding promotes interaction of the receptor with a corepressor complex that minimally contains Sin3A, N-CoR, histone deacetylase 4, and HSP90. Formation of the SHP-Sin3A complex is essential for the ability of AHPN and 3-Cl-AHPC to induce apoptosis, as both knockout SHP and knockdown of Sin3A compromise the proapoptotic activity of these compounds but not other apoptosis inducers. These results suggest that AHPN/3-Cl-AHPC and their analogues are SHP ligands and their induction of apoptosis is mediated by their binding to the SHP receptor.
Small heterodimer partner (SHP; NR0B2) is an orphan nuclear receptor and acts as a repressor for wide variety of nuclear hormone receptors. We demonstrated here that mouse SHP mRNA showed a circadian expression pattern in the liver. Transient transfection of the mSHP promoter demonstrated that CLOCK-BMAL1, core circadian clock components, bound to E-box (CACGTG), and stimulated the promoter activity by 4-fold. Liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1; NR5A2) stimulated the mSHP promoter, and CLOCK-BMAL1 synergistically enhanced the LRH-1-mediated transactivation. Interestingly, SHP did not affect the CLOCK-BMAL1-mediated promoter activity, but strongly repressed the synergistic activation of CLOCK-BMAL1 and LRH-1. Furthermore, in vitro pull-down assays revealed the existence of direct protein-protein interaction between LRH-1 and CLOCK. In summary, this study shows that CLOCK-BMAL1, LRH-1 and SHP coordinately regulate the mSHP gene to generate the circadian oscillation. The cyclic expression of mSHP may affect daily activity of other nuclear receptors and contribute to circadian liver functions.
Dosage-sensitive sex reversal adrenal hypoplasia congenita critical region on the X chromosome, gene 1 (DAX1) (NR0B1), and small heterodimer partner (SHP) (NR0B2) are atypical nuclear receptor superfamily members that function primarily as corepressors through heterodimeric interactions with other nuclear receptors. Mutations in DAX1 cause adrenal hypoplasia congenita, and mutations in SHP lead to mild obesity and insulin resistance, but the mechanisms are unclear. We investigated the existence and subcellular localization of DAX1 and SHP homodimers and the dynamics of homodimerization. We demonstrated DAX1 homodimerization in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and dissociation of DAX1 homodimers upon heterodimerization with steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) or ligand-activated estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha). DAX1 homodimerization involved an interaction between its amino and carboxy termini involving its LXXLL motifs and activation function (AF)-2 domain. We observed SHP homodimerization in the nucleus of mammalian cells and showed dissociation of SHP homodimers upon heterodimerization with ligand-activated ERalpha. We observed DAX1-SHP heterodimerization in the nucleus of mammalian cells and demonstrated the involvement of the LXXLL motifs and AF-2 domain of DAX1 in this interaction. We further demonstrate heterodimerization of DAX1 with its alternatively spliced isoform, DAX1A. This is the first evidence of homodimerization of individual members of the unusual NR0B nuclear receptor family and heterodimerization between its members. Our results suggest that DAX1 forms antiparallel homodimers through the LXXLL motifs and AF-2 domain. These homodimers may function as holding reservoirs in the absence of heterodimeric partners. The formation of DAX1 and SHP homodimers and DAX1-SHP and DAX1-DAX1A heterodimers suggests the possibility of novel functions independent of their coregulator roles, suggesting additional complexity in the molecular mechanisms of DAX1 and SHP action.
A highly significant quantitative trait locus (QTL) on pig chromosome 6, affecting intramuscular fat (IMF), has previously been detected by our group and others. Two genes of positional and biological interest, the small heterodimer partner (SHP; NR0B2) and the heart fatty acid binding protein (FABP3; H-FABP), were investigated for meat quality traits and IMF respectively. SHP was partially sequenced (GenBank: DQ002896 and DQ002897) and mapped to the QTL region on porcine chromosome 6, affecting IMF. The map shows no recombination between SHP and FABP3, which was previously mapped to the same QTL region. Twelve single nucleotide polymorphisms were detected in the sequenced region of SHP gene. Haplotype information was used to investigate association between genetic variation and different meat quality traits. SHP haplotype combinations were found to have significant effect on connective tissue. However, further studies are needed to evaluate this possible association more effectively. The FABP3 is involved in fatty acid transport and has been studied as a candidate gene for IMF by several research groups. In our study, FABP3 genotypes were confirmed to be significantly associated with IMF in pigs. The average content of IMF in our population was 1.6%, which may indicate that the FABP3 polymorphism explains as much as 30-35% of the variation in IMF in our pig cross-population.
While bile acids (BAs) have long been known to be essential in dietary lipid absorption and cholesterol catabolism, in recent years an important role for BAs as signalling molecules has emerged. BAs activate mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, are ligands for the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) TGR5 and activate nuclear hormone receptors such as farnesoid X receptor alpha (FXR-alpha; NR1H4). FXR-alpha regulates the enterohepatic recycling and biosynthesis of BAs by controlling the expression of genes such as the short heterodimer partner (SHP; NR0B2) that inhibits the activity of other nuclear receptors. The FXR-alpha-mediated SHP induction also underlies the downregulation of the hepatic fatty acid and triglyceride biosynthesis and very-low-density lipoprotein production mediated by sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein 1c. This indicates that BAs might be able to function beyond the control of BA homeostasis as general metabolic integrators. Here we show that the administration of BAs to mice increases energy expenditure in brown adipose tissue, preventing obesity and resistance to insulin. This novel metabolic effect of BAs is critically dependent on induction of the cyclic-AMP-dependent thyroid hormone activating enzyme type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (D2) because it is lost in D2-/- mice. Treatment of brown adipocytes and human skeletal myocytes with BA increases D2 activity and oxygen consumption. These effects are independent of FXR-alpha, and instead are mediated by increased cAMP production that stems from the binding of BAs with the G-protein-coupled receptor TGR5. In both rodents and humans, the most thermogenically important tissues are specifically targeted by this mechanism because they coexpress D2 and TGR5. The BA-TGR5-cAMP-D2 signalling pathway is therefore a crucial mechanism for fine-tuning energy homeostasis that can be targeted to improve metabolic control.
Small heterodimer partner (SHP; NR0B2), an exceptional member of the mammalian nuclear receptor family, directly modulates the activities of conventional nuclear receptors by acting as an inducible and tissue-specific corepressor. Recent progress in dissecting underlying molecular mechanisms, identifying target factors and target genes, and uncovering physiological functions points to the regulatory involvement of SHP in diverse metabolic and intracellular pathways that awaits future clarification. In this review, we carry out a comprehensive survey of all published data and discuss our current understanding of molecular mechanisms and physiological consequences governing SHP action.
Brown adipocytes increase energy production in response to induction of PGC-1alpha, a dominant regulator of energy metabolism. We have found that the orphan nuclear receptor SHP (NR0B2) is a negative regulator of PGC-1alpha expression in brown adipocytes. Mice lacking SHP show increased basal expression of PGC-1alpha, increased energy expenditure, and resistance to diet-induced obesity. Increased PGC-1alpha expression in SHP null brown adipose tissue is not due to beta-adrenergic activation, since it is also observed in primary cultures of SHP(-/-) brown adipocytes that are not exposed to such stimuli. In addition, acute inhibition of SHP expression in cultured wild-type brown adipocytes increases basal PGC-1alpha expression, and SHP overexpression in SHP null brown adipocytes decreases it. The orphan nuclear receptor ERRgamma is expressed in BAT and its transactivation of the PGC-1alpha promoter is potently inhibited by SHP. We conclude that SHP functions as a negative regulator of energy production in BAT.
We have generated a line of mutant mouse that lacks betaKlotho, a protein that structurally resembles Klotho. The synthesis and excretion of bile acids were found to be dramatically elevated in these mutants, and the expression of 2 key bile acid synthase genes, cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1) and sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase (Cyp8b1), was strongly upregulated. Nuclear receptor pathways and the enterohepatic circulation, which regulates bile acid synthesis, seemed to be largely intact; however, bile acid-dependent induction of the small heterodimer partner (SHP) NR0B2, a common negative regulator of Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1, was significantly attenuated. The expression of Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1 is known to be repressed by dietary bile acids via both SHP-dependent and -independent regulations. Interestingly, the suppression of Cyp7a1 expression by dietary bile acids was impaired, whereas that of Cyp8b1 expression was not substantially altered in betaklotho mice. Therefore, betaKlotho may stand as a novel contributor to Cyp7a1-selective regulation. Additionally, betaKlotho-knockout mice exhibit resistance to gallstone formation, which suggests the potential future clinical relevance of the betaKlotho system.
2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is a potent hepatotoxin that exerts its toxicity through binding to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and the subsequent induction or repression of gene transcription. In order to further identify novel genes and pathways that may be associated with TCDD-induced hepatotoxicity, we investigated gene changes in rat liver following exposure to single oral doses of TCDD. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered single doses of 0.4 microg/kg bw or 40 microg/kg bw TCDD and killed at 6 h, 24 h, or 7 days, for global analyses of gene expression. In general, low-dose TCDD exposure resulted in greater than 2-fold induction of genes coding for a battery of phase I and phase II metabolizing enzymes including CYP1A1, CYP1A2, NADPH quinone oxidoreductase, UGT1A6/7, and metallothionein 1. However, 0.4 microg/kg bw TCDD also altered the expression of Gadd45a and Cyclin D1, suggesting that even low-dose TCDD exposure can alter the expression of genes indicative of cellular stress or DNA damage and associated with cell cycle control. At the high-dose, widespread changes were observed for genes encoding cellular signaling proteins, cellular adhesion, cytoskeletal and membrane transport proteins as well as transcripts coding for lipid, carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism. In addition, decreased expression of cytochrome P450 7A1, short heterodimer partner (SHP; gene designation nr0b2), farnesyl X receptor (FXR), Ntcp, and Slc21a5 (oatp2) were observed and confirmed by RT-PCR analyses in independent rat liver samples. Altered expression of these genes implies major deregulation of cholesterol metabolism and bile acid synthesis and transport. We suggest that these early and novel changes have the potential to contribute significantly to TCDD induced hepatotoxicity and hypercholesterolemia.
EID1 (E1A-like inhibitor of differentiation 1) functions as an inhibitor of nuclear receptor-dependent gene transcription by directly binding to co-regulators. Alternative targets include the co-repressor small heterodimer partner (SHP, NR0B2) and the co-activators CBP/p300, indicating that EID1 utilizes different inhibitory strategies. Recently, EID2 was characterized as an inhibitor of muscle differentiation and as an antagonist of both CBP/p300 and HDACs. Here, we describe a third family member designated EID3 that is highly expressed in testis and shows homology to a region of EID1 implicated in binding to CBP/p300. We demonstrate that EID3 acts as a potent inhibitor of nuclear receptor transcriptional activity by a mechanism that is independent of direct interactions with nuclear receptors, including SHP. Furthermore, EID3 directly binds to and blocks the SRC-1 interacting domain of CBP, which has been implicated to act as the interaction surface for nuclear receptor co-activators. Consistent with this idea, EID3 prevents recruitment of CBP to a natural nuclear receptor-regulated promoter. Our study suggests that EID-family members EID3 and EID1 act as inhibitors of CBP/p300-dependent transcription in a tissue-specific manner.
The short heterodimer partner (SHP) (NR0B2) is an orphan nuclear receptor whose function in pancreatic beta-cells is unclear. Mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP2) in beta-cells is upregulated in obesity-related diabetes, causing impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). We investigated whether SHP plays a role in UCP2-induced GSIS impairment. We overexpressed SHP in normal islet cells and in islet cells overexpressing UCP2 by an adenovirus-mediated infection technique. We found that SHP overexpression enhanced GSIS in normal islets, and restored GSIS in UCP2-overexpressing islets. SHP overexpression increased the glucose sensitivity of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels and enhanced the ATP/ADP ratio. A peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) antagonist, GW9662, did not block the SHP effect on GSIS. SHP overexpression also corrected the impaired sensitivity of UCP2-overexpressing beta-cells to methylpyruvate, another energy fuel that bypasses glycolysis and directly enters the Krebs cycle. KATP channel inhibition mediated by dihydroxyacetone, which gives reducing equivalents directly to complex II of the electron transport system, was similar in Ad-Null-, Ad-UCP2- and Ad-UCP2+Ad-SHP-infected cells. The mitochondrial metabolic inhibitor sodium azide totally blocked the effect of SHP overexpression on GSIS. These results suggest that SHP positively regulates GSIS in beta-cells and restores glucose sensitivity in UCP2-overexpressing beta-cells by enhancing mitochondrial glucose metabolism, independent of PPARgamma activation.
Variations of the small heterodimer partner (SHP, NR0B2) gene, an atypical nuclear receptor that inhibits transactivation by hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4alpha, are associated with obesity among Japanese. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of SHP variants among obese Danish men. Using combined SSCP and heteroduplex analysis, we analyzed the entire coding region of SHP for variants in a cohort of 750 Danish men with early-onset obesity and genotyped a cohort of 795 nonobese control subjects using PCR-RFLP. Functional analyses of the identified coding region variants were performed in both MIN6-m9 and HepG2 cell lines. A total of five novel variants, including three missense variants (c.100C&gt;G [p.R34G], c.278G&gt;A [p.G93D], and c.415C&gt;A [p.P139H]) and two silent variants (c.65C&gt;T [p.Y22Y] and c.339G&gt;A [p.P113P]) were identified. Moreover, the previously reported c.512G&gt;C [p.G171A] polymorphism was identified. The 171A allele was not associated with obesity (p = 0.07). The 34G, 93D, and 139H-alleles were rare variants, which were found only among obese subjects. Among the four coding region variants, the 93D-allele showed a reduced in vitro inhibition of the HNF-4alpha transactivation of the HNF-1alpha promoter expression when expressed in MIN6-m9 and HepG2 cell lines (p&lt;0.01). In contrast to reported findings among obese Japanese, functional variants are rare among Danish men. A functional 93D variant of SHP was identified in 1 out of 750 obese and in none of 795 nonobese control subjects. Further large-scale population studies are necessary to assess the clinical impact of this rare variant on obesity risk among European subjects.
Small heterodimer partner (SHP; NR0B2) is an unusual orphan nuclear receptor that lacks a conventional DNA-binding domain and acts as a modulator of transcriptional activities of a number of nuclear receptors. Herein, we report that the human SHP promoter (hSHP) is activated by sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), which regulates the expression of various genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis. Overexpression of SREBP-1 activated the human but not mouse SHP promoter, although SREBP-2 had little effect on the SHP promoter in CV-1 cells. Serial deletion reporter assays revealed that SREBP-1-responsive region is located within the sequences from -243 to -120 bp in the hSHP promoter. DNase I footprinting, gel shift assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that SREBP-1 binds directly to the hSHP promoter. Site-directed mutagenesis made it clear that the hSHP promoter activation by SREBP-1 is mostly mediated by the SRE1 (-186 to -195 bp) in the hSHP promoter, which is not conserved in the mouse SHP promoter. Moreover, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SREBP-1c/ADD-1 induced SHP mRNA expression and repressed CYP7A1 expression in HepG2 cells. Finally, we found that a four-nucleotide deletion (-195CT-GAdel) in the hSHP promoter, which is reported to be associated with altered body weight and insulin secretion in human, coincides with the SRE1. This mutation strongly decreased both basal and SREBP-1 dependent activities of the hSHP promoter, because of the reduced binding of SREBP-1 to the mutated SRE1. Overall, our results demonstrate a differential regulation of human and mouse SHP promoters by SREBP-1. We propose a possible role of SREBP-1 in the species differential regulation of cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis via a novel mechanism of up-regulation of the hSHP gene expression.
Small heterodimer partner (SHP; NR0B2) is an atypical orphan nuclear receptor that lacks a conventional DNA binding domain (DBD) and represses the transcriptional activity of various nuclear receptors. In this study, we examined the novel cross talk between SHP and BETA2/NeuroD, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor. In vitro and in vivo protein interaction studies showed that SHP physically interacts with BETA2/NeuroD, but not its heterodimer partner E47. Moreover, confocal microscopic study and immunostaining results demonstrated that SHP colocalized with BETA2 in islets of mouse pancreas. SHP inhibited BETA2/NeuroD-dependent transactivation of an E-box reporter, whereas SHP was unable to repress the E47-mediated transactivation and the E-box mutant reporter activity. In addition, SHP repressed the BETA2-dependent activity of glucokinase and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 gene promoters. Gel shift and in vitro protein competition assays indicated that SHP inhibits neither dimerization nor DNA binding of BETA2 and E47. Rather, SHP directly repressed BETA2 transcriptional activity and p300-enhanced BETA2/NeuroD transcriptional activity by inhibiting interaction between BETA2 and coactivator p300. We also showed that C-terminal repression domain within SHP is also required for BETA2 repression. However, inhibition of BETA2 activity was not observed by naturally occurring human SHP mutants that cannot interact with BETA2/NeuroD. Taken together, these results suggest that SHP acts as a novel corepressor for basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor BETA2/NeuroD by competing with coactivator p300 for binding to BETA2/NeuroD and by its direct transcriptional repression function.
The orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP; NR0B2) is an unusual orphan nuclear receptor that lacks a conventional DNA-binding domain and acts as a modulator of transcriptional activities of a number of nuclear receptors. We have previously reported that the orphan nuclear receptor ERRgamma activates the SHP promoter. In this study, we have found that basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, the E2A proteins (E47, E12 and E2/5), activated the human but not the mouse SHP promoter. In contrast, the tissue-specific E47 heterodimer partner BETA2 repressed the E47- mediated transactivation of the human SHP (hSHP) promoter. Using serial deletions and E-box mutant constructs of the hSHP promoter, we identified two E-boxes (E6 and E7) as E47-responsive E-boxes, which are not conserved in the mouse SHP promoter. Moreover, gel shift, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and northern blot assays demonstrated that E47 directly binds to the hSHP promoter in vivo and in vitro and that Id proteins inhibited E47 binding to the hSHP promoter. Finally, we found that E47 and steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1), a regulator of the SHP promoter, synergistically activate the human but not the mouse SHP promoter. Our findings suggest that the E2A proteins differentially regulate the human and mouse SHP promoters and cooperate with orphan nuclear receptor SF-1 for transcriptional activation of the hSHP promoter.
Cholesterol gallstone formation is a complex genetic trait. To identify additional cholesterol gallstone susceptibility loci, we performed a quantitative trait locus analysis using an intercross of PERA/Ei and I/LnJ inbred strains of mice.
Mice of both sexes were examined for gallstone weight and evaluated according to a scoring system for the physical chemistry of cholelithiasis during feeding of a lithogenic diet. Intercross offspring were genotyped, and linkage analysis was performed by interval mapping. Differences in messenger RNA expression of positional candidate genes were determined using reverse-transcription and real-time polymerase chain reaction.
We identified significant loci associated with gallstone weight on chromosomes 10 and 4, named Lith7 and Lith8, respectively (both susceptibility alleles conferred by strain I/LnJ). Positional candidate genes with higher expression in I/LnJ mice are Fxr (official symbol, Nr1h4), encoding the nuclear bile salt receptor, on chromosome 10 and Shp1 (official symbol, Nr0b2), encoding the small heterodimer partner 1, on chromosome 4. A significant locus associated with gallstone score on chromosome 17, named Lith9 (susceptibility allele conferred by strain PERA/Ei), colocalizes with the genes Abcg5 and Abcg8 that encode the canalicular cholesterol transporter. Higher hepatic messenger RNA expression of Abcg5 and Abcg8 in strain PERA/Ei correlates positively with higher biliary cholesterol levels.
Our findings suggest a primary role of the nuclear bile salt receptor FXR and the canalicular cholesterol transporter ABCG5/ABCG8 in the genetic susceptibility and pathogenesis of cholesterol cholelithiasis in these strains of inbred mice.
The bile acid-activated farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a nuclear receptor regulating bile acid, glucose and cholesterol homeostasis. Obeticholic acid (OCA), a promising drug for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and type 2 diabetes, activates FXR. Mouse studies demonstrated that FXR activation by OCA alters hepatic expression of many genes. However, no data are available on the effects of OCA in the human liver. Here we generated gene expression profiles in human precision cut liver slices (hPCLS) after treatment with OCA.
hPCLS were incubated with OCA for 24 h. Wild-type or FXR(-/-) mice received OCA or vehicle by oral gavage for 7 days.
Transcriptomic analysis showed that well-known FXR target genes, including NR0B2 (SHP), ABCB11 (BSEP), SLC51A (OSTα) and SLC51B (OSTβ), and ABCB4 (MDR3) are regulated by OCA in hPCLS. Ingenuity pathway analysis confirmed that 'FXR/RXR activation' is the most significantly changed pathway upon OCA treatment. Comparison of gene expression profiles in hPCLS and mouse livers identified 18 common potential FXR targets. ChIP-sequencing in mouse liver confirmed FXR binding to IR1 sequences of Akap13, Cgnl1, Dyrk3, Pdia5, Ppp1r3b and Tbx6.
Our study shows that hPCLS respond to OCA treatment by upregulating well-known FXR target genes, demonstrating its suitability to study FXR-mediated gene regulation. We identified six novel bona-fide FXR target genes in both mouse and human liver. Finally, we discuss a possible explanation for changes in high or low density lipoprotein observed in NASH and primary biliary cholangitis patients treated with OCA based on the genomic expression profile in hPCLS.
Transdifferentiattion potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into insulin-producing cells (IPCs) has been suggested recently. In our recent works, we demonstrated the high performance of mouse neonate pancreas extract (MPE) in the production of functional IPCs from carcinoma stem cells. In this study, MPE was used to generate IPCs from MSCs without any genetic manipulation. To this end, bone marrow MSCs were isolated and characterized. In order to differentiate, MSCs were induced by selection of nestin-expressing cells and treatment with 100 μg/mL MPE. Morphological features of the differenti-ated cells were confirmed by dithizone staining. Immunoreactivity to insulin receptor beta, proinsulin, insulin, and C-peptide was observed by immunoflourescence. We also quantified glucose-dependent insulin production and secretion by ELISA. Real-time PCR indicated the expressions of β cell-related genes, PDX-1, INS1, INS2, EP300, and CREB1, in IPC cells. Possible pathways governed by CREB1, EP300, and PDX-1 transcription factors in differentiation of MSCs to IPCs were determined based on Gene Set Enrichment (GSE) approach at P = 0.05. Pathway discovery highlighted the negative regulatory effects of MIR124-2, HDAC5 protein, REST, and NR0B2 transcription factors on expression of CREB1, EP300, and PDX-1 and inhabitation of IPC differentiations. In contrast, a crosstalk between FOXA2 and TCF7L2 transcription factors, DNA-PK complex, KAT2B protein positively interacting with PDX-1, CREB1, EP300 resulted in the induction of IPC and following insulin production. In conclusion, we report an efficient, simple, and easy method for production of functional IPCs from MSCs by MPE treatment.
Disrupted bile secretion leads to liver damage characterized by inflammation, fibrosis, eventually cirrhosis, and hepatocellular cancer. As obstructive cholestasis often progresses insidiously, markers for the diagnosis and staging of the disease are urgently needed. To this end, we compiled a comprehensive data set of serum markers, histological parameters and transcript profiles at 8 time points of disease progression after bile duct ligation (BDL) in mice, aiming at identifying a set of parameters that could be used as robust biomarkers for transition of different disease progression phases.
Statistical analysis of the more than 6,000 data points revealed distinct temporal phases of disease. Time course correlation analysis of biochemical, histochemical and mRNA transcript parameters (=factors) defined 6 clusters for different phases of disease progression. The number of CTGF-positive cells provided the most reliable overall measure for disease progression at histological level, bilirubin at biochemical level, and metalloproteinase inhibitor 1 (Timp1) at transcript level. Prominent molecular events exhibited by strong transcript peaks are found for the transcriptional regulator Nr0b2 (Shp) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) 24-hydroxylase (Cyp24a1) at 6 h. Based on these clusters, we constructed a decision tree of factor combinations potentially useful as markers for different time intervals of disease progression. Best prediction for onset of disease is achieved by fibronectin (Fn1), for early disease phase by Cytochrome P450 1A2 (Cyp1a2), passage to perpetuation phase by collagen1α-1 (Col1a1), and transition to the progression phase by interleukin 17-a (Il17a), with early and late progression separated by Col1a1. Notably, these predictions remained stable even for randomly chosen small sub-sets of factors selected from the clusters.
Our detailed time-resolved explorative study of liver homogenates following BDL revealed a well-coordinated response, resulting in disease phase dependent parameter modulations at morphological, biochemical, metabolic and gene expression levels. Interestingly, a small set of selected parameters can be used as diagnostic markers to predict disease stages in mice with cholestatic liver disease.
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-mediated death. Although various therapeutic approaches are used for lung cancer treatment, these mainly target the tumor suppressor p53 transcription factor, which is involved in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. However, p53-targeted therapies have limited application in lung cancer, since p53 is found to be mutated in more than half of lung cancers. In this study, we propose tumor suppressor FOXA2 as an alternative target protein for therapies against lung cancer and reveal a possible FOXA2-centered transcriptional regulation network by identifying new target genes and binding partners of FOXA2 by using various screening techniques. The genes encoding Glu/Asp-rich carboxy-terminal domain 2 (CITED2), nuclear receptor subfamily 0, group B, member 2 (NR0B2), cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1) and BCL2-associated X protein (BAX) were identified as putative target genes of FOXA2. Additionally, the proteins including highly similar to heat shock protein HSP 90-beta (HSP90A), heat shock 70 kDa protein 1A variant (HSPA1A), histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and HDAC3 were identified as novel interacting partners of FOXA2. Moreover, we showed that FOXA2-dependent promoter activation of BAX and p21 genes is significantly reduced via physical interactions between the identified binding partners and FOXA2. These results provide opportunities to understand the FOXA2-centered transcriptional regulation network and novel therapeutic targets to modulate this network in p53-deficient lung cancer. 
Testosterone production by Leydig cells is a tightly regulated process requiring synchronized expression of several steroidogenic genes by numerous transcription factors. Myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) are transcription factors recently identified in somatic cells of the male gonad. In other tissues, MEF2 factors are essential regulators of organogenesis and cell differentiation. So far in the testis, MEF2 factors were found to regulate Leydig cell steroidogenesis by controlling Nr4a1 and Star gene expression. To expand our understanding of the role of MEF2 in Leydig cells, we performed microarray analyses of MEF2-depleted MA-10 Leydig cells, and the results were analyzed using Partek and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. Several genes were differentially expressed in MEF2-depleted Leydig cells, and 16 were validated by quantitative RT-PCR. A large number of these genes are known to be involved in fertility, gonad morphology, and steroidogenesis. These include Ahr, Bmal1, Cyp1b1, Hsd3b1, Hsd17b7, Map2k1, Nr0b2, Pde8a, Por, Smad4, Star, and Tsc22d3, which were all downregulated in the absence of MEF2. In silico analyses revealed the presence of MEF2-binding sites within the first 2 kb upstream of the transcription start site of the Por, Bmal1, and Nr0b2 promoters, suggesting direct regulation by MEF2. Using transient transfections in MA-10 Leydig cells, small interfering RNA knockdown, and a MEF2-Engrailed dominant negative, we found that MEF2 activates the Por, Bmal1, and Nr0b2 promoters and that this requires an intact MEF2 element. Our results identify novel target genes for MEF2 and define MEF2 as an important regulator of Leydig cell function and male reproduction. 
The increasing incidence of male reproductive impairments has been associated with di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP) exposure. However, mechanisms involved are lacking. We exposed 4-week-old male C57BL/6j mice to DEHP by gavage at 0, 125, 250 or 500 mg/kg body weight/day for 28 consecutive days. Our data showed that pubertal exposure to DEHP induces sperm count reduction as well as histological abnormalities in seminiferous epithelium and apoptosis of post-meiotic germ cells, and these effects are concomitant with reduction of testosterone levels and its steroidogenic gene expression. Moreover, the expressions of estrogen receptor ERβ and nuclear receptors Nr0b1, Nr0b2 are increased. The expression of Nr5a2 which is the inducer of steroidogenesis is significantly reduced. Furthermore, spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) self-renewal, differentiation and meiosis were significantly impaired, and the epigenetic regulator G9a-mediated histone methylation was decreased following DEHP exposure. Our results suggest that the DEHP-induced male reproductive impairments may depend on its estrogenic action on estrogen receptor and nuclear receptor, and involve inhibition of steroidogenesis, SSC self-renewal and meiosis, which may be attributed to the down-regulation of G9a-mediated histone methylation.
We explored the molecular mechanisms of obesity and insulin resistance in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) using a human embryonic stem cell model (hESCs). Three PCOS-derived and one non-PCOS-derived hESC lines were induced into adipocytes, and then total RNA was extracted. The differentially expressed PCOS-derived and non-PCOS-derived adipocytes genes were identified using the Boao Biological human V 2.0 whole genome oligonucleotide microarray. Signals of interest were then validated by real-time PCR. A total of 153 differential genes were expressed of which 91 genes were up-regulated and 62 down-regulated. Nuclear receptor subfamily 0, group B, member 2 (NR0B2) was an up-regulated gene, and the GeneChip CapitalBio® Molecule Annotation System V4.0 indicated that it was associated with obesity and diabetes (Ratio ≥ 2.0X). Multiple genes are involved in PCOS. Nuclear receptor subfamily 0, group B, member 2 may play a role in obesity and insulin resistance in patients with PCOS.
The nuclear orphan receptors for which endogenous ligands have not been identified include nuclear receptor (NR)0B1 (adrenal hypoplasia congenita critical region on chromosome X gene), NR0B2 (small heterodimer partner), NR1D1/2 (Rev-Erbα/β), NR2C1 (testicular receptor 2), NR2C2 (testicular receptor 4), NR2E1 (tailless), NR2E3 (photoreceptor-specific NR [PNR]), NR2F1 chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor 1 (COUP-TFI), NR2F2 (COUP-TFII), NR2F6 (v-erbA-related protein), NR4A1 (Nur77), NR4A2 (Nurr1), NR4A3 (Nor1), and NR6A1 (GCNF). These receptors play essential roles in development, cellular homeostasis, and disease including cancer where over- or underexpression of some receptors has prognostic significance for patient survival. Results of receptor knockdown or overexpression in vivo and in cancer cell lines demonstrate that orphan receptors exhibit tumor-specific pro-oncogenic or tumor suppressor-like activity. For example, COUP-TFII expression is both a positive (ovarian) and negative (prostate and breast) prognostic factor for cancer patients; in contrast, the prognostic activity of adrenal hypoplasia congenita critical region on chromosome X gene for the same tumors is the inverse of COUP-TFII. Functional studies show that Nur77 is tumor suppressor like in acute leukemia, whereas silencing Nur77 in pancreatic, colon, lung, lymphoma, melanoma, cervical, ovarian, gastric, and some breast cancer cell lines induces one or more of several responses including growth inhibition and decreased survival, migration, and invasion. Although endogenous ligands for the orphan receptors have not been identified, there is increasing evidence that different structural classes of compounds activate, inactivate, and directly bind several orphan receptors. Thus, the screening and development of selective orphan receptor modulators will have important clinical applications as novel mechanism-based agents for treating cancer patients overexpressing one or more orphan receptors and also for combined drug therapies. 
The molecular mechanisms behind human liver disease progression to cirrhosis remain elusive. Nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP/Nr0b2) is a hepatic tumor suppressor and a critical regulator of liver function. SHP expression is diminished in human cirrhotic livers, suggesting a regulatory role in human liver diseases. The goal of this study was to identify novel SHP-regulated genes that are involved in the development and progression of chronic liver disease. To achieve this, we conducted the first comprehensive RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of Shp(-/-) mice, compared the results with human hepatitis C cirrhosis RNA-seq and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) microarray datasets, and verified novel results in human liver biospecimens. This approach revealed new gene signatures associated with chronic liver disease and regulated by SHP. Several genes were selected for validation of physiological relevance based on their marked upregulation, novelty with regard to liver function, and involvement in gene pathways related to liver disease. These genes include peptidoglycan recognition protein 2, dual specific phosphatase-4, tetraspanin 4, thrombospondin 1, and SPARC-related modular calcium binding protein-2, which were validated by qPCR analysis of 126 human liver specimens, including steatosis, fibrosis, and NASH, alcohol and hepatitis C cirrhosis, and in mouse models of liver inflammation and injury. This RNA-seq analysis identifies new genes that are regulated by the nuclear receptor SHP and implicated in the molecular pathogenesis of human chronic liver diseases. The results provide valuable transcriptome information for characterizing mechanisms of these diseases. 
Farnesoid X receptor (FXR, Nr1h4) and small heterodimer partner (SHP, Nr0b2) are nuclear receptors that are critical to liver homeostasis. Induction of SHP serves as a major mechanism of FXR in suppressing gene expression. Both FXR(-/-) and SHP(-/-) mice develop spontaneous hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). SHP is one of the most strongly induced genes by FXR in the liver and is a tumor suppressor, therefore, we hypothesized that deficiency of SHP contributes to HCC development in the livers of FXR(-/-) mice and therefore, increased SHP expression in FXR(-/-) mice reduces liver tumorigenesis. To test this hypothesis, we generated FXR(-/-) mice with overexpression of SHP in hepatocytes (FXR(-/-)/SHP(Tg)) and determined the contribution of SHP in HCC development in FXR(-/-) mice. Hepatocyte-specific SHP overexpression did not affect liver tumor incidence or size in FXR(-/-) mice. However, SHP overexpression led to a lower grade of dysplasia, reduced indicator cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. All tumor-bearing mice had increased serum bile acid levels and IL-6 levels, which was associated with activation of hepatic STAT3. In conclusion, SHP partially protects FXR(-/-) mice from HCC formation by reducing tumor malignancy. However, disrupted bile acid homeostasis by FXR deficiency leads to inflammation and injury, which ultimately results in uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in the liver. 
The liver helps maintain energy homeostasis by synthesizing and storing glucose and lipids. Gonadal steroids, particularly estrogens, play an important role in regulating metabolism. As estrogens are considered female hormones, metabolic disorders related to the disruption of estrogen signaling have mostly been studied in females. Estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) is the predominant receptor in both the male and female liver, and it mediates the hepatic response to estrogens. Loss of ESR1 increases weight gain and obesity in female rats, while reducing the normal growth in males. Although Esr1-/- male rats have a reduced body weight, they exhibit increased adipose deposition and impaired glucose tolerance. We further investigated whether these metabolic disorders in Esr1-/- male rats were linked with the loss of transcriptional regulation by ESR1 in the liver. To identify the ESR-regulated genes, RNA-sequencing was performed on liver mRNAs from wildtype and Esr1-/- male rats. Based on an absolute fold change of ≥2 with a p-value ≤ 0.05, a total of 706 differentially expressed genes were identified in the Esr1-/- male liver: 478 downregulated, and 228 upregulated. Pathway analyses demonstrate that the differentially expressed genes include transcriptional regulators (Cry1, Nr1d1, Nr0b2), transporters (Slc1a2), and regulators of biosynthesis (Cyp7b1, Cyp8b1), and hormone metabolism (Hsd17b2, Sult1e1). Many of these genes are also integral parts of the lipid and carbohydrate metabolism pathways in the liver. Interestingly, certain critical regulators of the metabolic pathways displayed a sexual dimorphism in expression, which may explain the divergent weight gain in Esr1-/- male and female rats despite common metabolic dysfunctions.
Inflammatory reaction plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of acquired hearing loss such as ototoxicity and labyrinthitis. In our earlier work, we showed the pivotal role of otic fibrocytes in cochlear inflammation and the critical involvement of proinflammatory cytokines in cisplatin ototoxicity. We also demonstrated that otic fibrocytes inhibit monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (CCL2) upregulation in response to interleukin-10 (IL-10) via heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) signaling, resulting in suppression of cochlear inflammation. However, it is still unclear how IL-10 affects inflammation-mediated cochlear injury. Here we aim to determine how hypochlorous acid, a model inflammation mediator affects cochlear cell viability and how IL-10 affects hypochlorous acid-mediated cochlear cell injury. NaOCl, a sodium salt of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) was found to induce cytotoxicity of HEI-OC1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Combination of hydrogen peroxide and myeloperoxidase augmented cisplatin cytotoxicity, and this synergism was inhibited by N-Acetyl-L-cysteine and ML-171. The rat spiral ligament cell line (RSL) appeared to upregulate the antioxidant response element (ARE) activities upon exposure to IL-10. RSL cells upregulated the expression of NRF2 (an ARE ligand) and NR0B2 in response to CoPP (a HMOX1 inducer), but not to ZnPP (a HMOX1 inhibitor). Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of NR0B2 was found to suppress CCL2 upregulation. IL-10-positive cells appeared in the mouse stria vascularis 1 day after intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Five days after injection, IL-10-positive cells were observed in the spiral ligament, spiral limbus, spiral ganglia, and suprastrial area, but not in the stria vascularis. IL-10R1 appeared to be expressed in the mouse organ of Corti as well as HEI-OC1 cells. HEI-OC1 cells upregulated Bcl-xL expression in response to IL-10, and IL-10 was shown to attenuate NaOCl-induced cytotoxicity. In addition, HEI-OC1 cells upregulated IL-22RA upon exposure to cisplatin, and NaOCl cytotoxicity was inhibited by IL-22. Taken together, our findings suggest that hypochlorous acid is involved in cochlear injury and that IL-10 potentially reduces cochlear injury through not only inhibition of inflammation but also enhancement of cochlear cell viability. Further studies are needed to determine immunological characteristics of intracochlear IL-10-positive cells and elucidate molecular mechanisms involved in the otoprotective activity of IL-10.
Mammalian nuclear receptors (NRs) are transcription factors regulating the expression of target genes that play an important role in drug metabolism, transport, and cellular signaling pathways. The orphan and structurally unique receptor small heterodimer partner 1 (syn NR0B2) is not only known for its modulation of drug response, but has also been reported to be involved in hepatocellular carcinogenesis. Indeed, previous studies show that NR0B2 is downregulated in human hepatocellular carcinoma, suggesting that NR0B2 acts as a tumor suppressor via inhibition of cellular growth and activation of apoptosis in this tumor entity. The aim of our study was to elucidate whether NR0B2 may also play a role in other tumor entities. Comparing NR0B2 expression in renal cell carcinoma and adjacent nonmalignant transformed tissue revealed significant downregulation in vivo. Additionally, the impact of heterologous expression of NR0B2 on cell cycle progression and proliferation in cells of renal origin was characterized. Monitoring fluorescence intensity of resazurin turnover in RCC-EW cells revealed no significant differences in metabolic activity in the presence of NR0B2. However, there was a significant decrease of cellular proliferation in cells overexpressing this NR, and NR0B2 was more efficient than currently used antiproliferative agents. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis showed that heterologous overexpression of NR0B2 significantly reduced the amount of cells passing the G1 phase, while on the other hand, more cells in S/G2 phase were detected. Taken together, our data suggest that downregulation of NR0B2 may also play a role in renal cell carcinoma development and progression. 
Residual feed intake (RFI) is a powerful indicator for energy utilization efficiency and responds to selection. Low RFI selection enables a reduction in feed intake without affecting growth performance. However, the effective variants or major genes dedicated to phenotypic differences in RFI in quality chickens are unclear. Therefore, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and RNA sequencing were performed on RFI to identify genetic variants and potential candidate genes associated with energy improvement.
A lower average daily feed intake was found in low-RFI birds compared to high-RFI birds. The heritability of RFI measured from 44 to 83 d of age was 0.35. GWAS showed that 32 of the significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the RFI (P &lt; 10(-4)) accounted for 53.01 % of the additive genetic variance. More than half of the effective SNPs were located in a 1 Mb region (16.3-17.3 Mb) of chicken (Gallus gallus) chromosome (GGA) 12. Thus, focusing on this region should enable a deeper understanding of energy utilization. RNA sequencing was performed to profile the liver transcriptomes of four male chickens selected from the high and low tails of the RFI. One hundred and sixteen unique genes were identified as differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Some of these genes were relevant to appetite, cell activities, and fat metabolism, such as CCKAR, HSP90B1, and PCK1. Some potential genes within the 500 Kb flanking region of the significant RFI-related SNPs detected in GWAS (i.e., MGP, HIST1H110, HIST1H2A4L3, OC3, NR0B2, PER2, ST6GALNAC2, and G0S2) were also identified as DEGs in chickens with divergent RFIs.
The GWAS findings showed that the 1 Mb narrow region of GGA12 should be important because it contained genes involved in energy-consuming processes, such as lipogenesis, social behavior, and immunity. Similar results were obtained in the transcriptome sequencing experiments. In general, low-RFI birds seemed to optimize energy employment by reducing energy expenditure in cell activities, immune responses, and physical activity compared to eating.
SHP (short heterodimer partner) is an orphan nuclear receptor lacking a DNA binding domain that interacts with nuclear receptors (NR) including thyroid receptor (TR), retinoic acid receptors (RAR and RXR), and estrogen receptors alpha and beta (ERalpha and ERbeta). SHP acts as a negative regulator of these receptors by inhibiting DNA binding and transcriptional activation. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) binds to arylhydrocarbon receptor (AHR), activating the AHR/AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT) heterodimer. We investigated the physical and functional interaction of SHP with AHR/ARNT. In RL95-2 human endometrial carcinoma cells, SHP inhibited TCDD-stimulated reporter activity from the AHR-responsive CYP1A1 and UGT1A6 gene promoters in a concentration-dependent manner. In GST pull-down assays, ARNT interacted directly with SHP in vitro, but AHR did not interact with GST-SHP. SHP inhibited AHR/ARNT-DNA binding in vitro. These results identify ARNT as a novel SHP target. We speculate a role for SHP in the suppression of agonist-activated AHR/ARNT activity.
Ileal expression of the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) in the rat is unaffected by bile salts, yet in the mouse it is under negative-feedback regulation. The bile acid responsiveness of human ASBT is unknown. The human ASBT promoter linked to a luciferase reporter was studied in Caco-2 cells treated with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and transfected with expression plasmids for farnesoid X-receptor (FXR), short heterodimer partner (SHP), and retinoic acid receptor/retinoid X receptor (RAR/RXR). CDCA treatment of Caco-2 cells led to a 75% reduction in steady-state ASBT messenger RNA levels and a 78% reduction in human ASBT promoter activity. A dominant negative FXR abrogated the response to CDCA. Site-directed mutagenesis of an RAR/RXR cis element in the human ASBT promoter reduced its activity by 50% and eliminated the bile acid response. Retinoic acid activated the human ASBT promoter fourfold. SHP repressed the activity of the ASBT promoter and reduced activation by retinoic acid. Antisense mediated knock-down of SHP in Caco-2 cells partially offset the bile acid mediated repression of ASBT promoter activity. In conclusion, the human ASBT is positively regulated by retinoic acid. Bile acids induce a negative feedback regulation of human ASBT via an FXR-mediated, SHP-dependent effect upon RAR/RXR activation of ASBT.
SHP (short heterodimer partner) is a novel orphan receptor that lacks a conventional DNA binding domain and interacts with other members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. We have characterized the SHP sequences required for interaction with other superfamily members, and have defined an SHP repressor domain. In the mammalian two-hybrid system, a fusion of full-length SHP to the GAL4 DNA binding domain shows 9-cis-retinoic acid-dependent interaction with a VP16-retinoid X receptor alpha (RXR alpha) fusion. By deletion analysis, sequences required for this RXR interaction map to the central portion of SHP (amino acids 92 to 148). The same region is required for interaction with RXR in vitro and in the yeast two-hybrid system, and results from the yeast system suggest that the same SHP sequences are required for interaction with other members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily such as thyroid hormone receptor and retinoic acid receptor. In mammalian cells, a GAL4-SHP fusion protein shows about 10-fold-decreased transcriptional activation relative to GAL4 alone, and fusion of SHP to the C terminus of a GAL4-VP16 fusion to generate a triple chimera also results in a strong decrease in transactivation activity. Sequences required for this repressor function were mapped to the C terminus of SHP. This region is distinct from that required for corepressor interaction by other members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, and SHP did not interact with N-CoR in either the yeast or mammalian two-hybrid system. Together, these results identify novel receptor interaction and repressor domains in SHP and suggest two distinct mechanisms for inhibition of receptor signaling pathways by SHP.
The orphan nuclear hormone receptor SHP interacts with a number of other nuclear hormone receptors and inhibits their transcriptional activity. Several mechanisms have been suggested to account for this inhibition. Here we show that SHP inhibits transactivation by the orphan receptor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF-4) and the retinoid X receptor (RXR) by at least two mechanisms. SHP interacts with the same HNF-4 surface recognized by transcriptional coactivators and competes with them for binding in vivo. The minimal SHP sequences previously found to be required for interaction with other receptors are sufficient for interaction with HNF-4, although deletion results indicate that additional C-terminal sequences are necessary for full binding and coactivator competition. These additional sequences include those associated with direct transcriptional repressor activity of SHP. SHP also competes with coactivators for binding to ligand-activated RXR, and based on the ligand-dependent interaction with other nuclear receptors, it is likely that coactivator competition is a general feature of SHP-mediated repression. The minimal receptor interaction domain of SHP is sufficient for full interaction with RXR, as previously described. This domain is also sufficient for full coactivator competition. Functionally, however, full inhibition of RXR transactivation requires the presence of the C-terminal repressor domain, with only weak inhibition associated with this receptor interaction domain. Overall, these results suggest that SHP represses nuclear hormone receptor-mediated transactivation via two separate steps: first by competition with coactivators and then by direct effects of its transcriptional repressor function.
The nuclear receptor pregnane X receptor (PXR) acts as a sensor for a broad variety of natural and synthetic lipophilic compounds, such as bile acids and rifampicin, and regulates the expression of proteins that are involved in the metabolism and transport of these compounds. PXR binds as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) to specific DNA sites, called response elements (REs), within the promoter regions of genes it activates transcriptionally. In this study we created a position weight matrix (PWM) for PXR-RXR heterodimers that took the relative in vitro binding strength and not only the sequence of natural and synthetic PXR binding sites (PXREs) into account. We further extended the discriminatory power of the matrix by including the variation of the dinucleotides 5'-flanking the hexameric binding motifs, which we show to have a significant effect on PXR binding ability. To test this PWM, it was used to screen the promoter regions of the human organic anion transport protein 2 (OATP2) and small heterodimer partner 1 (SHP1) genes. This resulted in the identification of 17 potential PXREs, of which seven bound PXR-RXR heterodimers in vitro. Furthermore, in HepG2 human hepatoma cells, PXR and RXR occupied chromatin regions that contained four of these REs. Induction of OATP2 and SHP1 mRNA expression by rifampicin confirmed that both genes are primary human PXR responding genes. This observation increases the understanding of the physiological role of PXR in the homeostasis of bile acids in humans.
Essential genes which are required for normal nuclear migration and play a role in developmental processes have been isolated from model genetic organisms. One such gene is nudC (nuclear distribution C), which is required for positioning nuclei in the cytoplasm of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans and for normal colony growth. This gene is highly conserved, structurally and functionally, throughout evolution and the human homolog, HnudC, has been cloned. To study the function of nudC in higher eukaryotic cells, HnudC was downregulated by developing triple ribozyme constructs, consisting of two cis-acting ribozymes which liberate an internal trans-acting ribozyme targeted to HnudC. Efficient cleavage sites in HnudC mRNA were identified using a library selection technique and HnudC-targeted internal ribozymes were cloned into a triple ribozyme cassette. Triple ribozyme constructs were subcloned into an ecdysone-inducible expression vector and stably transfected into human embryonic 293 cells. Muristerone A induced expression of the HnudC ribozyme and produced specific reduction of HnudC mRNA. Downregulation of HnudC mRNA resulted in significant inhibition of cell proliferation in clones expressing the HnudC-targeted triple ribozyme, which was not observed in uninduced cells or cells transfected with vector alone. In induced cultures, many mitotic cells demonstrated defects in spindle architecture during mitosis. The most common defect observed was multiple mitotic spindle poles rather than the expected bipolar structure. These data demonstrate the fundamental importance of HnudC in eukaryotic cell proliferation and a functional role for HnudC in spindle formation at mitosis.
The filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans nudC (nuclear distribution C) gene is required for movement of nuclei following mitosis and for normal colony growth. It is highly conserved, structurally and functionally, throughout most of evolution. The human homolog, called HnudC, has been cloned and has an important role in cell proliferation. In hematopoiesis, HNUDC is highly expressed in early hematopoietic precursors and declines during normal differentiation. Stimulation of proliferation of the erythroleukemia cell line TF-1 with GM-CSF enhances HnudC protein and mRNA expression and treatment with antisense (but not sense) oligonucleotides to HnudC mRNA significantly reduces cell division. A significant increase in HNUDC is present in bone marrow aspirates from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) compared to the level in normal cellular counterparts, demonstrating dysregulated expression in leukemia. These data support the conclusion that HnudC plays a functional role in promoting hematopoietic cell growth and that it is involved in leukemogenesis.
Nuclear distribution gene C (NudC) was first found in Aspergillus nidulans as an upstream regulator of NudF, whose mammalian homolog is Lissencephaly 1 (Lis1). NudC is conserved from fungi to mammals. Vertebrate NudC has three homologs: NudC, NudC-like protein (NudCL), and NudC-like protein 2 (NudCL2). All members of the NudC family share a conserved p23 domain, which possesses chaperone activity both in conjunction with and independently of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). Our group and the others found that NudC homologs were involved in cell cycle regulation by stabilizing the components of the LIS1/dynein complex. Additionally, NudC plays important roles in cell migration, ciliogenesis, thrombopoiesis, and the inflammatory response. It has been reported that NudCL is essential for the stability of the dynein intermediate chain and ciliogenesis via its interaction with the dynein 2 complex. Our data showed that NudCL2 regulates the LIS1/dynein pathway by stabilizing LIS1 with Hsp90 chaperone. The fourth distantly related member of the NudC family, CML66, a tumor-associated antigen in human leukemia, contains a p23 domain and appears to promote oncogenesis by regulating the IGF-1R-MAPK signaling pathway. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of the NudC family and highlight its potential clinical relevance. 
aTo study the effect of human nuclear distribution C èhNUDCé on human megakaryocyte proliferation and differentiation from cord blood CD34(+) cells in vitro.
aHuman CD34(+) cells were isolated using the Dynal CD34 Progenitor Cell Selection System from umbilical cord blood. The CD34(+) cells were then cultured in serum free methylcellulose semi-solid media, the morphologic aspects and number of small, medium and large CFU-MK colonies were observed and scored on the day12 by microscopy analysis. The CD34(+) cells were cultured in serum free liquid media, cells were removed on day 10 and formation of CD41(+) in human megakaryocyte and its DNA polyploidization of nuclear were analyzed on a FACsort flowcytometer.
ahNUDC supported the formation of small and medium CFU-MK colony in serum free semi-solid media. Furthermore, hNUDC induced a remarkable increase in expression of the megakaryocyte cell surface marker CD41(+) and stimulated the CD41(+) DNA polyploidization more effectively than TPO.
hNUDC may play an important role in megakaryocyte proliferation and differentiation.
To prepare and characterize the monoclonal antibody (mAB) against human nuclear distribution C (hNudC).
The coding region of hNudC was amplified from human embryo liver tissue and the recombinant prokaryotic expression vector pET28b was constructed. hNudC protein was expressed as a fusion protein with an N-terminal 6-His tag. The purified recombinant hNudC protein was used to immunize BALB/c mice for preparing mAb. The hybridoma cells produced from mAB were screened by ELISA and the specificity of mAb was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining and Western blot.
Two hybridoma cells (2C16 and 2D8) secreting mAb against hNudC were developed. The isotypes of the two mABs were IgGI and IgM, respectively. ELISA detection showed that the titer of mABs, 2C16 and 2D8 was 1:64, 1:32 in cultured supernatant and 1:1 x 10(5), 1:5 x 10(4) in ascites, respectively. They could specifically bind to recombinant hNudC. The results of immunohistochemical staining and Western blot indicated that mAb could specifically recognize hNudC in human Dami, Meg-01 cell lines and human marrow CD41+ megakaryocytes generated from umbilical core blood.
Monoclonal antibodies against hNudC with high titers and specificity have been successfully prepared, which will be useful for assessing the function, native distribution and aberrant expression of hNudC protein.
Diffusely infiltrating gliomas are the most common type of primary intracranial neoplasm in humans. One of the major obstacles to the effective treatment of these tumors is their highly infiltrative growth. However, mechanisms controlling their migration and proliferation are poorly understood. Glioma cells resemble neural progenitors, and we hypothesize that gliomas recapitulate the capacity of migration and proliferation of progenitors that takes place during brain development. Based on recent evidence implicating cytoplasmic dynein and its regulatory proteins in neural progenitor migration and division, we conducted immunohistochemical evaluation of surgically resected human glioma samples for the presence and distribution of these proteins. We examined expression of LIS1, the gene responsible for type I lissencephaly, cytoplasmic dynein and the dynein- and LIS1-interacting factors dynactin, NudE/NudEL and NudC, which play significant roles in neural progenitor cell behavior. We found that each of these proteins is expressed in all histological types and grades of human neuroectodermal tumors examined. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the levels of expression varied from cell to cell within each tumor, ranging from very high to undetectable. This stands in contrast to the low levels of diffuse staining seen in non-neoplastic brain tissue. Of particular interest, we noted tumor cells infiltrating the white matter and tumor cells undergoing cell division amongst the cells with notably high expression levels. These findings are compatible with the idea that LIS1 and its interacting proteins play a role in glioma migration and proliferation analogous to their role during brain development.
The equal distribution of chromosomes during mitosis is critical for maintaining the integrity of the genome. Essential to this process are the capture of spindle microtubules by kinetochores and the congression of chromosomes to the metaphase plate . Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is a mitotic kinase that has been implicated in microtubule-kinetochore attachment, tension generation at kinetochores, tension-responsive signal transduction, and chromosome congression . The tension-sensitive substrates of Plk1 at the kinetochore are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that human Nuclear distribution protein C (NudC), a 42 kDa protein initially identified in Aspergillus nidulans and shown to be phosphorylated by Plk1 , plays a significant role in regulating kinetochore function. Plk1-phosphorylated NudC colocalizes with Plk1 at the outer plate of the kinetochore. Depletion of NudC reduced end-on microtubule attachments at kinetochores and resulted in defects in chromosome congression at the metaphase plate. Importantly, NudC-deficient cells exhibited mislocalization of Plk1 and the Kinesin-7 motor CENP-E from prometaphase kinetochores. Ectopic expression of wild-type NudC, but not NudC containing mutations in the Plk1 phosphorylation sites, recovered Plk1 localization at the kinetochore and rescued chromosome congression. Thus, NudC functions as both a substrate and a spatial regulator of Plk1 at the kinetochore to promote chromosome congression.
Nuclear migration is essential for growth, development, and cellular function of eukaryotes. Nuclear distribution C (NUDC) protein plays an important role in nuclear migration. This study was to detect the expression of NUDC protein in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cell lines CNE-2 and HNE-2, and to investigate the effect of anti-NUDC antibody on the growth of both cell lines.
Soluble fusion protein GST-NUDC was expressed in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli, and its poly-antibody was prepared. The subcellular localization of NUDC protein in CNE-2 and HNE-2 cells was detected with indirect immunofluorescent staining, the expression of NUDC protein in CNE-2 and HNE-2 cells was detected by Western blot, the effect of anti-NUDC antibody on the growth of CNE-2 and HNE-2 cells was detected by MTT assay.
NUDC protein was expressed in both nasopharyngeal non-cancerous tissues and CNE-2 and HNE-2 cells, and its expression was higher in CNE-2 and HNE-2 cells than in nasopharyngeal non-cancerous tissues. NUDC protein in CNE-2 and HNE-2 cells was distributed mainly in the karyolemma of cytoplasm, and in nuclei asymmetrically. Anti-NUDC antibody inhibited the growth of CNE-2 and HNE-2 cells in a dose-dependent manner.
NUDC protein is expressed highly in CNE-2 and HNE-2 cells. Anti-NUDC antibody could inhibit the growth of CNE-2 and HNE-2 cells.
Cytoplasmic dynein, a minus-end-directed microtubule motor, has been implicated in many fundamental cellular processes; however, little is known regarding the underlying molecular machinery that regulates its stability. In Aspergillus nidulans, nuclear distribution gene C (nudC) has been implicated in the regulation of dynein-mediated nuclear migration. Here, we characterize a previously undescribed mammalian NudC-like protein (NudCL). The expression and phosphorylation of NudCL are increased during mitosis. Depletion of NudCL by RNA interference in HeLa cells inhibits cell growth and induces mitotic arrest with multiple mitotic defects, which subsequently result in cell death. Unexpectedly, the majority of NudCL depletion-induced mitotic defects may result from loss of dynein function; this interpretation is supported by the failure to recruit sufficient gamma-tubulin to spindle poles and the mislocalization of the dynein complex from kinetochores, spindle microtubules, and spindle poles during mitosis. Depletion of NudCL also results in the aggregation of dynein intermediate chain throughout the cytoplasm during mitosis. NudCL was shown to bind to the dynein complex, and its depletion induces degradation of dynein intermediate chain, a process suppressed by MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. Taken together, these data suggest a previously undescribed mechanism whereby NudCL appears to influence the stabilization of dynein intermediate chain.
Microtubules play a central role in coordinating various cellular functions that are orchestrated by their interaction with molecular motors. Anticancer drugs that target microtubule dynamics have been shown to be effective in cancer treatment. However, the effect of microtubule motor-associated molecules on cancer cell proliferation is not clear. Here, we investigated the role of NudC, a nuclear movement protein associated with the microtubule motor dynein, on prostate tumorigenesis. Recombinant adenovirus expressing NudC (Ad-NudC) was used to examine the effects of NudC on the tumorigenicity of prostate cancer cells. Expression of NudC in LNCaP cells inhibited their anchorage-independent growth in a soft agar colony assay. Expression of NudC in DU145 or PC-3 cells inhibited tumor growth in a subcutaneous xenograft model. At the cellular level, expression of NudC in DU145 and PC-3 cells inhibited cell proliferation at 48 h after Ad-NudC infection. FACS analysis of cell cycle distribution showed that 50-60% of Ad-NudC-infected PC-3 cells have a G2/M-phase DNA content compared to about 16-19% in Ad-Luciferase (Ad-Luc)-infected control cells, suggesting that NudC overexpression resulted in aberrant cell cycle progression. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed a significant increase in cells with a single enlarged nucleus and cells exhibiting multiple nuclei, along with a concomitant increase in cell size in Ad-NudC-infected cells. These results suggest that NudC overexpression led to a block in cell division of prostate cancer cells, and that Ad-NudC may provide a new anticancer drug approach targeting the function of a microtubule motor-associated protein.
In the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, nuclear migration in the germ tube is mediated by cytoplasmic dynein. We have previously reported the characterization of four nud (nuclear distribution) genes, nudA, nudC, nudF and nudG, involved in this process. The nudA and nudG genes respectively encode for the heavy chain and the 8-kDa light chain of cytoplasmic dynein. In this work, we describe an improved method for the isolation of nud mutants that has led to the identification of at least ten additional nud loci. We have cloned one of the genes, nudK, and determined that it encodes the actin-related protein Arp1, which is a component of the dynactin complex. This provides the first evidence that dynactin is involved in nuclear migration in A. nidulans.
In both Aspergillus nidulans and the mouse, studies of the nuclear distribution gene C (NudC) have strongly suggested that the NudC protein interacts with NudF, which is the product of NudF, a homologue of human LIS1 (also know as PAFAH1B1), one of the causative genes for classical lissencephaly. We have isolated the human NUDC gene and its two processed pseudogenes. The human NUDC gene is highly conserved and its predicted amino acid sequence shows 94% identity to mouse NudC and 95% identity to rat NudC. The genomic structure of NUDC, its chromosomal localization, and expression pattern in human tissues were characterized. NUDC consists of at least 9 exons ranging from 66 bp to 266 bp in size and 8 introns from 92 bp to 2.0 kb in length, and the total genomic region spans about 8 kb. NUDC was mapped to 1p34-p35 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Northern analysis showed a major 1.6 kb transcript in all fetal and adult tissues examined. Primers which amplify individual exons of NUDC were developed for mutation analysis.
The mycelium of Aspergillus nidulans is composed of multinucleate cellular compartments delimited by crosswalls called septa. Septum formation is dependent on mitosis and requires the recruitment of actin to the site of septum formation. Employing a collection of temperature sensitive nuclear distribution (nudA2, nudC3 and nudF7), nuclear division (nimA5, hfaB3), and septation (sepD5, sepG1) mutants, we have investigated the interdependency among nuclear positioning, mitosis, and cell growth in structuring the cellular compartments of A. nidulans. The cellular compartments of nud+ strains were highly uniform with regard to nuclear distribution and averaged 38 microns in length. Incubation of nud mutants at semi-restrictive temperature resulted in aberrant nuclear distribution that appeared to direct the formation of variable-sized cellular compartments, ranging from 5 microns to greater than 81 microns. In germinating spores, the first septum forms at the basal end of the germ tube following the third round of nuclear division. Germlings must undergo mitosis in order to form a septum. Temperature-sensitive mitotic mutants were used to show that a single nuclear division is sufficient to activate septum formation, provided a critical cell size has been attained. In mitotic mutants and wild-type cells, delays in nuclear division resulted in the misplacement of the first septum. These results strongly support the role of mitotic nuclei in determining septal placement, and suggest that cell size control is post-mitotic in A. nidulans.
Nuclear migration plays an important role in the growth and development of many organisms including the multinuclear fungus Aspergillus nidulans. We have identified four genes, nudA, nudC, nudF, and nudG, in which temperature-sensitive mutations affect nuclear distribution. In this report, we describe the cloning of the nudA gene by complementation of the mutant phenotype by using a chromosome VIII-specific cosmid library. A genomic fragment of nudA hybridized to an mRNA of approximately 14 kb. Sequencing analysis of nudA revealed four ATP-binding sites that are characteristic of the cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain. The amino acid sequence of the nudA gene product shows 52% overall identity with the rat brain cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain. Our study provides in vivo evidence that dynein, a microtubule motor molecule, plays a role in the nuclear migration process.
Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) plays essential roles at multiple events during cell division, yet little is known about its physiological substrates. In a cDNA phage display screen using Plk1 C-terminal affinity columns, we identified NudC (nuclear distribution gene C) as a Plk1 binding protein. Here, we characterize the interaction between Plk1 and NudC, show that Plk1 phosphorylates NudC at conserved S274 and S326 residues in vitro, and present evidence that NudC is also a substrate for Plk1 in vivo. Downregulation of NudC by RNA interference results in multiple mitotic defects, including multinucleation and cells arrested at the midbody stage, which are rescued by ectopic expression of wild-type NudC, but not by NudC with mutations in the Plk1 phosphorylation sites. These results suggest that Plk1 phosphorylation of NudC may influence cytokinesis.
We recently identified a novel human gene, HnudC, homologous to an Aspergillus nidulans gene coding for a protein crucial to nuclear migration, cell wall morphogenesis, and cell growth. While mRNA for this gene is expressed in most tissues, HNUDC protein expression is highly regulated. To provide insight into the function of this protein, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of the distribution of HNUDC in 19 different human tissues. Intense immunolabeling was observed in proliferating cells, including spermatocytes at all stages, early hematopoietic cells, cortical thymocytes, immunoblasts, and basal colonic and esophageal mucosa. Within a given tissue, cells with different proliferative capacities demonstrated different levels of HNUDC expression. HNUDC was also highly expressed in ciliated epithelia including those found in ependyma, bronchial mucosa, and fallopian tubes. Immunolabeling was moderate in several non-proliferating tissues, but little or no labeling was observed in most other tissues examined. We also demonstrated by western blotting that most cell lines express extremely high levels of HNUDC compared to their normal counterparts. While this supports a role for HnudC in cell proliferation, these data indicate that cell lines are not a reliable measure of HNUDC protein expression in normal tissues. We conclude that HNUDC is highly expressed in cell lines and the proliferating cells of normal tissues, consistent with our hypothesis that HNUDC is conserved throughout evolution for a crucial function in cell division. In addition, the high level in ciliated cells suggests an important role in ciliary motility or assembly, analogous to its role in A. nidulans nuclear movement.
Mitosis is largely driven by posttranslational modifications of proteins. Recent studies suggest that protein acetylation is prevalent in mitosis, but how protein acetylation/deacetylation regulates mitotic progression remains unclear. Nuclear distribution protein C (NudC), a conserved protein that regulates cell division, was previously shown to be acetylated. We found that NudC acetylation was decreased during mitosis. Using mass spectrometry analysis, we identified K39 to be an acetylation site on NudC. Reconstitution of NudC-deficient cells with wild-type or K39R acetylation-defective NudC rescued mitotic phenotypes, including chromosome misalignment, chromosome missegregation, and reduced spindle width, observed after NudC protein knockdown. In contrast, the K39Q acetylation-mimetic NudC was unable to rescue these mitotic phenotypes, suggesting that NudC deacetylation is important for mitotic progression. To examine proteins that may play a role in NudC deacetylation during mitosis, we found that NudC co-localizes on the mitotic spindle with the histone deacetylase HDAC3, an HDAC shown to regulate mitotic spindle stability. Further, NudC co-immunoprecipitates with HDAC3 and loss of function of HDAC3 either by protein knockdown or inhibition with a small molecule inhibitor increased NudC acetylation. These observations suggest that HDAC3 may be involved in NudC deacetylation during mitosis. Cells with NudC or HDAC3 knockdown exhibited overlapping mitotic abnormalities, including chromosomes arranged in a "dome-like" configuration surrounding a collapsed mitotic spindle. Our studies suggest that NudC acetylation/deacetylation regulates mitotic progression and NudC deacetylation, likely through HDAC3, is critical for spindle function and chromosome congression. 
Overexpression of hNUDC, a member of the nuclear distribution protein family, reduces cell population growth in prostate cancer cell lines, concurrent with induced morphological change and enhanced polyploidization. These phenomena are also closely associated with terminal phases of megakaryocyte maturation.
In Dami cells, MTT and trypan blue assays were used to investigate cell viability and proliferation effects of hNUDC, and flow cytometry was used to analyse cell cycle and DNA content. Real-time RT-PCR was employed to detect mRNA expression. Activations of caspase-3, ERK, Akt and Stat-5 were determined by immunoblotting. May-Grünwald-Giemsa staining was performed to reveal cell morphology.
Functional studies using adenovirus-mediated hNUDC overexpression led to inhibition of megakaryocyte proliferation via cell cycle arrest in G2/M transition phase. This process could have been be mediated by upregulation of p21 and downregulation of its downstream targets, including cyclin B1, cyclin B2 and c-myc. Enhanced apoptosis in turn ensued, characterized by increased caspase-3 activation, upregulation of pro-apoptotic Bax and downregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2. Furthermore, hNUDC overexpression elevated the level of megakaryocyte maturation, associated with increased polyploidy, cell morphological changes and increased expression of cell surface differentiation markers, including CD10, CD44, CD41 and CD61. Our results further suggest that the ERK signalling pathway was involved in hNUDC overexpression-induced apoptosis. Taken together, this study provides experimental evidence for overexpression of hNUDC in Dami cells and suggests that activation of apoptotic machinery may be involved in megakaryocytic differentiation.
We previously demonstrated that endogenous hNUDC and Mpl co-localized in the perinuclear and cytoplasmic regions of megakaryocyte cells by indirect immunofluorescence. We further reported that hNUDC accumulated in the Golgi when NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with an hNUDC expression vector alone. However, co-transfection with hNUDC and Mpl expression vectors caused both proteins to co-localize predominantly in the cytosol. These observations led us to hypothesize that a complex containing hNUDC and Mpl may alter hNUDC subcellular location and induce its secretion. In the present study, we test this hypothesis by employing bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) to detect and visualize the complex formation of hNUDC/Mpl in living cells. We further examined in detail the subcellular locations of the hNUDC/Mpl complex by co-transfection of BiFC chimeras with known subcellular markers. The distribution of hNUDC/Mpl in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi and cell surface was determined. Furthermore, the N-terminal 159 amino acids of hNUDC, but not C-terminal half, bound to Mpl in vivo and exhibited a similar localization pattern to that of full-length hNUDC in Cos-1 cells. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of hNUDC or its N-terminal 159 residues in a human megakaryocyte cell line (Dami) resulted in increased levels of hNUDC or hNUDC(1-159) secretion. In contrast, depletion of Mpl by transfecting Dami cells with adenovirus bearing Mpl-targeting siRNA significantly blocked hNUDC secretion. Thus, we provide the first evidence that the N-terminal region of hNUDC contains all of the necessary information to complex with Mpl and traffic through the secretory pathway.
To construct a lentiviral vector carrying human nuclear distribution protein C (hNUDC)-specific shRNA (sh-NUDC-F) and knock down hNUDC expression in Dami cells by infection of the lentivirus.
After labeling of green fluorescent protein (GFP),  sh-NUDC-F was cloned into lentiviral vector pRRL-cPPT-CMV-X-PRE-SIN,  and the high-quality plasmid was transfected into 293T cells to produce lentiviral particles by the calcium phosphate method. After high-speed centrifugation,  lentiviral particles were collected and determined for its titer. The high-titer lentiviral particles were then transduced into Dami cells. By detecting the expression of GFP in lentiviral vector using a microscope,  the transduction efficiency was readily figured out. And hNUDC protein level was detected by Western blotting.
hNUDC was totally knocked down by the efficient transduction of Dami cells with the lentivirus carrying  sh-NUDC-F.
Lentiviral vector  containing  sh-NUDC-F can be successfully packaged in 293T cells and then efficiently transduced into Dami cells to silence hNUDC gene.
To investigate the expression and clinical significance of human nuclear distribution (hNudC) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
Immunohistochemical and western blot method were used to determine the expression of human nuclear distribution C in 80 cases of NPC and 30 cases of chronic inflammation of nasopharyngeal mucosa. The amounts of positive cells were analyzed . The relationship between the gene expression and clinic pathological features was analyzed too.
The positive expression rate of human nuclear distribution C in NPC was 83.75%, which was higher than that in chronic inflammation of nasopharyngeal mucosa 23.33% (P &lt; 0.05). The expression of human nuclear distribution C was positively correlated with the clinic pathological stages in NPC (P &lt; 0.05), and positive expression rate of hNudC protein was increased with the progress of NPC clinical stage (P &lt; 0.05).
Human nuclear distribution C is found to be closely associated with cell malignant hyperplasia. This protein is important indicators to predict the progression of patients.
LIS1, a gene mutated in classical lissencephaly, plays essential roles in cytoplasmic dynein regulation, mitosis and cell migration. However, the regulation of LIS1 (lissencephaly protein 1) protein remains largely unknown. Genetic studies in Aspergillus nidulans have uncovered that the Nud (nuclear distribution) pathway is involved in the regulation of cytoplasmic dynein complex and a temperature-sensitive mutation in the nudC gene (L146P) greatly reduces the protein levels of NudF, an Aspergillus ortholog of LIS1. Here, we showed that L146 in Aspergillus NudC and its flanking region were highly conservative during evolution. The similar mutation in human NudC (L279P) obviously led to reduced LIS1 and cellular phenotypes similar to those of LIS1 down-regulation. To explore the underlying mechanism, we found that the p23 domain-containing protein NudC bound to the molecular chaperone Hsp90, which is also associated with LIS1. Inhibition of Hsp90 chaperone function by either geldanamycin or radicicol resulted in a decrease in LIS1 levels. Ectopic expression of Hsp90 partially reversed the degradation of LIS1 caused by overexpression of NudC-L279P. Furthermore, NudC was found to regulate the ATPase activity of Hsp90, which was repressed by the mutation of L279P. Interestingly, NudC itself was shown to possess a chaperone function, which also was suppressed by the L279P mutation. Together, these data suggest that NudC may be involved in the regulation of LIS1 stability by its chaperone function.
Thrombopoietin (TPO) and its receptor (Mpl) have long been associated with megakaryocyte proliferation, differentiation, and platelet formation. However, studies have also shown that the extracellular domain of Mpl (Mpl-EC) interacts with human (h) NUDC, a protein previously characterized as a human homolog of a fungal nuclear migration protein. This study was undertaken to further delineate the putative binding domain on the Mpl receptor. Using the yeast two-hybrid system assay and co-immunoprecipitation, we identified that within the Mpl-EC domain 1 (Mpl-EC-D1), amino acids 102-251 were strongly involved in ligand binding. We subsequently expressed five subdomains within this region with T7 phage display. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent binding assays identified a short stretch of peptide located between residues 206 and 251 as the minimum binding domain for both TPO and hNUDC. A series of sequential Ala replacement mutations in the region were subsequently used to identify the specific residues most involved in ligand binding. Our results point to two hydrophobic residues, Leu(228) and Leu(230), as having substantial effects on hNUDC binding. For TPO binding, mutations in residues Asp(235) and Leu(239) had the largest effect on binding efficacy. In addition, deletion of the conservative motif WGSWS reduced binding capacity for hNUDC but not for TPO. These separate binding sites on the Mpl receptor for TPO and hNUDC raise interesting implications for the cytokine-receptor interactions.
Nuclear distribution gene C homolog (NudC) is a highly conserved gene. It has been identified in different species from fungi to mammals. The high degree of conservation, in special in the nudC domain, suggests that they are genes with essential functions. Most of the identified genes in the family have been implicated in cell division through the regulation of cytoplasmic dynein. As for mammalian genes, human NUDC has been implicated in the migration and proliferation of tumor cells and has therefore been considered a possible therapeutic target. There is evidence suggesting that mammalian NudC is also implicated in the regulation of the inflammatory response and in thrombopoiesis. The presence of these other functions not related to the interaction with molecular motors agrees with that these genes and their products are larger in size than their microbial orthologous, indicating that they have evolved to convey additional features.
Human NudC nuclear distribution protein (hNUDC) is differentially expressed between normal and cancer cells. Based on its marked altered expression and its roles in modulating cell division, cytokineses and migration, a detailed understanding of the mechanisms regulating hNUDC expression in cancer cells is critical. In this study, we identified miR-194 as a downstream target of hNUDC and linked its expression to reduced metastatic capacity and tumorigenicity of prostate cancer (PCa) cells. Using miRNA target prediction programs, hNUDC mRNA was found to contain a potential binding site for miR-194 within its 3'UTR. A Reporter assay confirmed that post-transcriptional regulation of hNUDC was dependent on the miR-194 binding site. Forced expression of miR-194 in PCa cell lines, PC-3 and DU-145, led to a decrease in the mRNA and protein levels of hNUDC. Overexpression of miR-194 in these cells inhibited cell migration and invasion, and induced multinucleated cells. Our data showed that hNUDC knockdown by siRNA significantly reduced the migration and invasion in the PC-3 and DU-145 cells, phenocopying the results of miR-194 overexpression. Furthermore, lentivirus-mediated stable expression of miR-194 in PCa cells reduced the ability of colony formation as detected by a soft agar assay and exhibited significantly less tumorigenic ability in vivo. Our results suggest a novel role for miR-194 in effectively controlling cell metastatic processes in PCa cells via the regulation of hNUDC expression.
Nuclear distribution protein C (NudC) is a mitotic regulator that plays a role in cytokinesis. However, how NudC is regulated during cytokinesis remains unclear. Here, we show that NudC is phosphorylated by Aurora B, a kinase critical for cell abscission. NudC is co-localized with Aurora B at the midbody and co-immunoprecipitated with Aurora B in mitosis. Inhibition of Aurora B by ZM447439 reduced NudC phosphorylation, suggesting that NudC is an Aurora B substrate in vivo. We identified T40 on NudC as an Aurora B phosphorylation site. NudC depletion resulted in cytokinesis failure with a dramatic elongation of the intercellular bridge between daughter cells, sustained Aurora B activity at the midbody, and reduced cell abscission. These cytokinetic defects can be rescued by the ectopic expression of wild-type NudC. Reconstitution with T40A phospho-defective NudC was found to rescue the cytokinesis defect. In contrast, reconstitution with the T40D phospho-mimetic NudC was inefficient in supporting the completion of cytokinesis. These results suggest that that dynamic phosphorylation of NudC by Aurora B regulates cytokinesis. 
NSCLC accounts for over 80% of all lung cancers and is associated with poor prognosis. Human nuclear distribution C (hNUDC) was predicted to be the target gene of microRNA-194 (miR-194). The present study was designed to demonstrate the mechanism of miR-194 in the regulation of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) via targeting the hNUDC. The hNUDC expression was found to strongly be increased while the miR-194 decreased significantly in the NSCLC cell lines when compared with the healthy controls. Moreover, the luciferase report confirmed the targeting reaction between miR-194 and hNUDC. After transfection with miR-194 mimic into NSCLC cells, we found that the miR-194 overexpression resulted in abnormal nuclear division, decreased cell proliferation and inhibited the expression of hNUDC and Mpl/ERK pathway proteins. Furthermore, the hNUDC overexpression affected the suppression effect of miR-194 in 95D cells, indicating that miR-194 suppresses tumor cell process by inhibiting the hNUDC expression. In brief, the present study suggests that the upregulation of miR-194 affects the hNUDC expression, leading to a downregulated expression of Mpl/ERK pathway proteins, and suppresses the mitosis and proliferation of NSCLC cells. These results offer a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of lung cancer. 
Emerging data indicate that actin dynamics is associated with ciliogenesis. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here we find that nuclear distribution gene C (NudC), an Hsp90 co-chaperone, is required for actin organization and dynamics. Depletion of NudC promotes cilia elongation and increases the percentage of ciliated cells. Further results show that NudC binds to and stabilizes cofilin 1, a key regulator of actin dynamics. Knockdown of cofilin 1 also facilitates ciliogenesis. Moreover, depletion of either NudC or cofilin 1 causes similar ciliary defects in zebrafish, including curved body, pericardial edema and defective left-right asymmetry. Ectopic expression of cofilin 1 significantly reverses the phenotypes induced by NudC depletion in both cultured cells and zebrafish. Thus, our data suggest that NudC regulates actin cytoskeleton and ciliogenesis by stabilizing cofilin 1. 
Neurons typically assume multipolar, bipolar, or unipolar morphologies. Little is known about the mechanisms underlying the development of these basic morphological types. Here, we show that the Krüppel-like transcription factor Dar1 determines the multipolar morphology of postmitotic neurons in Drosophila. Dar1 is specifically expressed in multipolar neurons and loss of dar1 gradually converts multipolar neurons into the bipolar or unipolar morphology without changing neuronal identity. Conversely, misexpression of Dar1 or its mammalian homolog in unipolar and bipolar neurons causes them to assume multipolar morphologies. Dar1 regulates the expression of several dynein genes and nuclear distribution protein C (nudC), which is an essential component of a specialized dynein complex that positions the nucleus in a cell. We further show that these genes are required for Dar1-induced multipolar neuron morphology. Dar1 likely functions as a terminal selector gene for the basic layout of neuron morphology by regulating both dendrite extension and the dendrite-nucleus coupling.
The three basic morphological types of neurons--unipolar, bipolar, and multipolar--are important for information processing and wiring of neural circuits. Little progress has been made toward understanding the molecular and cellular programs that generate these types since their discovery over a century ago. It is generally assumed that basic morphological types of neurons are determined by the number of dendrites growing out from the cell body. Here, we show that this model alone is insufficient. We introduce the positioning of nucleus as a critical factor in this process and report that the transcription factor Dar1 determines multipolar neuron morphology in postmitotic neurons by regulating genes involved in nuclear positioning.
Echinoderm microtubule-associated protein (EMAP)-like (EML) family proteins are microtubule-associated proteins that have a conserved hydrophobic EMAP-like protein (HELP) domain and multiple WD40 domains. In this study, we examined the role of EML4, which is a member of the EML family, in cell division. Time-lapse microscopy analysis demonstrated that EML4 depletion induced chromosome misalignment during metaphase and delayed anaphase initiation. Further analysis by immunofluorescence showed that EML4 was required for the organization of the mitotic spindle and for the proper attachment of kinetochores to microtubules. We searched for EML4-associating proteins by mass spectrometry analysis and found that the nuclear distribution gene C (NUDC) protein, which is a critical factor for the progression of mitosis, was associated with EML4. This interaction was mediated by the WD40 repeat of EML4 and by the C-terminus of NUDC. In the absence of EML4, NUDC was no longer able to localize to the mitotic spindle, whereas NUDC was dispensable for EML4 localization. Our results show that EML4 is critical for the loading of NUDC onto the mitotic spindle for mitotic progression. 
The nudF and nudC genes of the fungus Aspergillus nidulans encode proteins that are members of two evolutionarily conserved families. In A. nidulans these proteins mediate nuclear migration along the hyphae. The human ortholog of nudF is Lis1, a gene essential for neuronal migration in the developing cerebral cortex. The mammalian ortholog of nudC encodes a protein that interacts with Lis1. We have identified orthologs of nudC and Lis1 from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Heterologous expression of the C. elegans nudC ortholog, nud-1, complements the A. nidulans nudC3 mutant, demonstrating evolutionary conservation of function. A C. elegans nud-1::GFP fusion produces sustained fluorescence in sensory neurons and embryos, and transient fluorescence in the gonad, gut, vulva, ventral cord, and hypodermal seam cells. Fusion of GFP to C. elegans lis-1 revealed expression in all major neuronal processes of the animal as well as the multinucleate spermathecal valves and adult seam cells. Phenotypic analysis of either nud-1 and lis-1 by RNA interference yielded similar phenotypes, including embryonic lethality, sterility, altered vulval morphology, and uncoordinated movement. Digital time-lapse video microscopy was used to determine that RNAi-treated embryos exhibited nuclear positioning defects in early embryonic cell division similar to those reported for dynein/dynactin depletion. These results demonstrate that the LIS-1/NUDC-like proteins of C. elegans represent a link between nuclear positioning, cell division, and neuronal function.
Human NUDC (hNUDC) has been previously described as a human homolog of a fungal nuclear migration protein. It is a multifunctional interactive protein that forms an association with the microtubule motor complex in a variety of cells. Our recent studies demonstrated that hNUDC could bind specifically to the thrombopoietin receptor (Mpl) and suggest a potential role for hNUDC in megakaryocytopoiesis and thrombopoiesis. The present study is designed to define its biological activity. We demonstrate that the recombinant hNUDC significantly increases megakaryocyte maturation in serum-free liquid-cultured human CD34(+) cells and stimulates colony formation in serum-free semi-solid cultures. Flow cytometry analyses also confirm the stimulatory effect of hNUDC on megakaryocyte polyploidization and in vitro platelet production. In vivo experiments further demonstrate that the administration of hNUDC substantially enhance the number of circulating platelets in normal mice.
Human NUDC (hNUDC) was initially characterized as a nuclear migration protein based on the similarity of its C-terminus to that of fungal NUDC from Aspergillus nidulans. However, hNUDC is a 331 amino acid protein whereas fungal NUDC is 198 amino acids in length. The extra N-terminal portion of hNUDC has no known function or homology to other proteins. In this study, we report the binding of hNUDC to the extracellular domain of the thrombopoietin receptor (Mpl) as detected by the yeast two-hybrid system, GST pull-down, and co-immunoprecipitation. Our deletion analysis demonstrated that amino acids between positions 100 and 238 as the critical domain mediating the hNUDC and Mpl interactions as detected by the two-hybrid system and GST pull-down assay. Immunofluorescence staining of human megakaryocyte cells indicated that hNUDC and Mpl colocalized at all stages of megakaryocyte development. Substantial colocalization of hNUDC with microtubules was also detected around nuclei and elongated microtubular structures, especially in proplatelet extensions.
NUDC is a highly conserved protein important for nuclear migration and viability in Aspergillus nidulans. Mammalian NudC interacts with Lis1, a neuronal migration protein important during neocorticogenesis, suggesting a conserved mechanism of nuclear movement in A. nidulans and neuronal migration in the developing mammalian brain (S. M. Morris et al., 1998). To further investigate this possibility, we show for the first time that NudC, Lis1, and cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain (CDIC) colocalize at the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) around the nucleus in a polarized manner facing the leading pole of cerebellar granule cells with a migratory morphology. In neurons with stationary morphology, NudC is distributed throughout the soma and colocalizes with CDIC and tubulin in neurites as well as at the MTOC. At the subcellular level, NudC, CDIC, and p150 dynactin colocalize to the interphase microtubule array and the MTOC in fibroblasts. The observed colocalization is confirmed biochemically by coimmunoprecipitation of NudC with CDIC and cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain (CDHC) from mouse brain extracts. Consistent with its expression in individual neurons, a high level of NudC is detected in regions of the embryonic neocortex undergoing extensive neurogenesis as well as neuronal migration. These data suggest a biochemical and functional interaction of NudC with Lis1 and the dynein motor complex during neuronal migration in vivo.
To identify gene products important for gastrulation in the amphibian Pleurodeles waltl, a screen for regional differences in new protein expression at the early gastrula stage was performed. A 45 kDa protein whose synthesis was specific for progenitor endodermal cells was identified. Microsequencing and cDNA cloning showed that P45 is highly homologous to rat NUDC, a protein suggested to play a role in nuclear migration. Although PNUDC can be detected in all regions of the embryo, its de novo synthesis is tightly regulated spatially and temporally throughout oogenesis and embryonic development. New PNUDC synthesis in the progenitor endodermal cells depends on induction by the mesodermal cells in the gastrula. During development, PNUDC is localized in the egg cortical cytoplasm, at the cleavage furrow during the first embryonic division, around the nuclei and cortical regions of bottle cells in the gastrula, and at the basal region of polarized tissues in the developing embryo. These results show for the first time the expression and compartmentalization of PNUDC at distinct stages during amphibian development.
Microtubules and cytoplasmic dynein, a microtubule-dependent motor, are required for nuclei to move along the hyphae of filamentous fungi. Nuclear migration in Aspergillus nidulans is blocked by heat-sensitive (hs-) mutations in the nudA gene, which encodes dynein heavy chain, and the nudF gene, which encodes a G protein beta-subunit-like protein. Hs- mutations in the nudC and nudG genes also prevent nuclear migration. We have isolated extragenic suppressor mutations that reverse the hs- phenotypes caused by these mutations. Here we show that one nudF suppressor also suppresses hs- mutations in nudA, nudC, and nudG and deletions in nudA and nudF. This suppressor mutation is in the tubA alpha tubulin gene, and its characteristics suggest that it destabilizes microtubules. The mutation alters microtubule staining and confers sensitivity to cold and benomyl, two treatments that destabilize microtubules. Treatment with low concentrations of benomyl also suppresses the hs- nudA, nudC, nudF, and nudG mutations and the nudA and nudF deletions. Suppression of the hs- nudA mutation and the nudA deletion is especially interesting because these strains lack active dynein heavy chain. Together, these results suggest that microtubule destabilization allows nuclei to migrate even in the absence of cytoplasmic dynein motor function.
Nuclear migration plays an important role in the growth and development of many organisms including the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans. We have cloned three genes from A. nidulans, nudA, nudC, and nudF, in which mutations affect nuclear migration. The nudA gene encodes the heavy chain of cytoplasmic dynein. The nudC gene encodes a 22-kD protein. The nudF gene was identified as an extra copy suppressor of the temperature sensitive (ts-) nudC3 mutation. The nudC3 mutation substantially decreases the intracellular concentration of the nudF protein at restrictive temperature. This is restored toward the normal level by an extra copy of nudF. To identify other genes whose products interact directly or indirectly with the NUDC protein, we have isolated a set of extragenic suppressors showed them to represent nine different genes, designated sncA-sncI (for suppressor of nudC). sncA-sncH were either dominant or semidominant in diploids homozygous for nudC3 and heterozygous for the snc mutations. All of the suppressors reversed the ts- phenotype of nudC3 by restoring the intracellular concentration of the NUDF protein.
During a study of the genetics of nuclear migration in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, we cloned a gene, nudF, which is required for nuclear migration during vegetative growth as well as development. The NUDF protein level is controlled by another protein NUDC, and extra copies of the nudF gene can suppress the nudC3 mutation. nudF encodes a protein with 42% sequence identity to the human LIS-1 (Miller-Dieker lissencephaly-1) gene, which is required for proper neuronal migration during brain development. This strong similarity suggests that the LIS-1 gene product may have a function similar to that of NUDF and supports previous findings to suggest that nuclear migration may play a role in neuronal migration.
During the past 20 years, biologists have become used to finding that proteins first identified in simple, genetically manipulable eukaryotic organisms are conserved in higher eukaryotes. This article draws attention to the similarity between NUDF protein, which is required for nuclear migration in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, and a mammalian homologue, LIS1, whose malfunction causes lissencephaly, a neuronal migration disease. The authors suggest that there might be an underlying similarity of mechanism between nuclear migration in the fungus and neuronal migration in the brain.
Important clues to how the mammalian cerebral cortex develops are provided by the analysis of genetic diseases that cause cortical malformations [1-5]. People with Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS) or isolated lissencephaly sequence (ILS) have a hemizygous deletion or mutation in the LIS1 gene [3,6]; both conditions are characterized by a smooth cerebral surface, a thickened cortex with four abnormal layers, and misplaced neurons [7,8]. LIS1 is highly expressed in the ventricular zone and the cortical plate [9,10], and its product, Lis1, has seven WD repeats [3]; several proteins with such repeats have been shown to interact with other polypeptides, giving rise to multiprotein complexes [11]. Lis1 copurifies with platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase subunits alpha 1 and alpha 2 [12], and with tubulin; it also reduces microtubule catastrophe events in vitro [13]. We used a yeast two-hybrid screen to isolate new Lis1-interacting proteins and found a mammalian ortholog of NudC, a protein required for nuclear movement in Aspergillus nidulans [14]. The specificity of the mammalian NudC-Lis1 interaction was demonstrated by protein-protein interaction assays in vitro and by co-immunoprecipitation from mouse brain extracts. In addition, the murine mNudC and mLis1 genes are coexpressed in the ventricular zone of the forebrain and in the cortical plate. The interaction of Lis1 with NudC, in conjunction with the MDS and ILS phenotypes, raises the possibility that nuclear movement in the ventricular zone is tied to the specification of neuronal fates and thus to cortical architecture.
Nuclear migration is required for normal development in both higher and lower eukaryotes. In fungi this process is mediated by cytoplasmic dynein. It is believed that this motor protein is anchored to the cell membrane and moves nuclei by capturing and pulling on spindle pole body microtubules. To date, four genes have been identified and shown to be required for this process in Aspergillus nidulans. The nudA and nudG genes, respectively, encode the heavy and light chains of cytoplasmic dynein, and the nudF and nudC gene products encode proteins of 49 and 22 kDa. The precise biochemical functions of the nudF and nudC genes have not yet been identified. In this report we further investigate NUDC protein function by deleting the nudC gene. Surprisingly, although deletion of nudA and nudF affect nuclear migration, deletion of nudC profoundly affected the morphology and composition of the cell wall. Spores of the strain deleted for nudC grew spherically and lysed. The thickness of the cell wall was increased in the deletion mutant and wall polymer composition was abnormal. This phenotype could be repressed by growth on osmotically buffered medium at low temperature. Similar, but less severe, effects were also noted in a strain depleted for NUDC by down-regulation. These results suggest a possible relationship between fungal cell wall biosynthesis and nuclear migration.
Nuclear migration plays a prominent role in a broad range of developmental processes. We have cloned a Drosophila gene, DnudC, encoding a protein that is evolutionarily conserved between humans and fungi. The Aspergillus homolog, nudC, is one of a group of genes required for nuclear migration. DnudC encodes a 38.5-kDa protein, and the carboxy terminal half of the protein shares 52% amino acid identity with Aspergillus nudC. We show that the structural homology between DnudC and nudC extends to the functional level since the Drosophila gene can rescue the nuclear migration defects seen in Aspergillus nudC mutants. Immunolocalization studies using antisera against DnudC reveal that the protein is localized to the cytoplasm in Drosophila ovaries and embryos. Our data suggest that the nudC genes may be components of a functionally conserved pathway involved in the regulation of nuclear motility.
NudC encodes a protein of unknown biochemical function that is required for nuclear migration. In an attempt to define its function by identifying interacting proteins, a screen for extragenic suppressors of the temperature-sensitive nudC3 mutation was undertaken that identified nine snc genes. Here we demonstrate that nudC3 has a missense mutation at amino acid 146 that causes leucine to be replaced by proline and that sncB69 encodes a mutant tRNA(Leu) that corrects the mutation. The sncB69 mutation deletes a single nucleotide in the anticodon of a tRNA(Leu) that changes its normal 5'CAG3' leucine anticodon to the proline anticodon 5'CCG3', which presumably allows incorporation of leucine at the mutant nudC3 proline codon 146 and thereby causes suppression of the nudC3 mutant phenotype.
Lissencephaly is a devastating neurological disorder caused by defective neuronal migration. The LIS1 (or PAFAH1B1) gene was identified as the gene mutated in lissencephaly patients, and was found to regulate cytoplasmic dynein function and localization. In particular, LIS1 is essential for anterograde transport of cytoplasmic dynein as a part of the cytoplasmic dynein-LIS1-microtubule complex in a kinesin-1-dependent manner. However, the underlying mechanism by which a cytoplasmic dynein-LIS1-microtubule complex binds kinesin-1 is unknown. Here, we report that mNUDC (mammalian NUDC) interacts with kinesin-1 and is required for the anterograde transport of a cytoplasmic dynein complex by kinesin-1. mNUDC is also required for anterograde transport of a dynactin-containing complex. Inhibition of mNUDC severely suppressed anterograde transport of distinct cytoplasmic dynein and dynactin complexes, whereas motility of kinesin-1 remained intact. Reconstruction experiments clearly demonstrated that mNUDC mediates the interaction of the dynein or dynactin complex with kinesin-1 and supports their transport by kinesin-1. Our findings have uncovered an essential role of mNUDC for anterograde transport of dynein and dynactin by kinesin-1.
Recently our laboratory reported evidence showing that hNUDC acts as an additional cytokine for thrombopoietin receptor (Mpl). Previously known as the human homolog of a fungal nuclear migration protein, hNUDC plays a critical role in megakaryocyte differentiation and maturation. Here we sought to further clarify the hNUDC-Mpl ligand-receptor relationship by utilizing interference RNA (RNAi) to knockdown Mpl expression in a megakaryocyte cell line. We created U6 promoter driven constructs to express short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) with affinity for different sites on Mpl mRNA. By including Mpl-EGFP fusion protein in these constructs, we were able to effectively screen the shRNA that was most efficient in inhibiting Mpl mRNA expression. This shRNA was subsequently transferred into a lentivirus vector and transduced into Dami cells, a cell line which constitutively expresses endogenous Mpl. This lentiviral vector was also designed to simultaneously express EGFP to monitor transfection efficiency. Our results show that lentivirus can be used to effectively deliver shRNAs into Dami cells and cause specific inhibition of Mpl protein expression after transduction. Furthermore, we show the functional effects of shRNA-mediated Mpl silencing by demonstrating reduced hNUDC stimulated megakaryocyte proliferation and differentiation. Thus, the use of a RNAi knockdown strategy has allowed us to pinpoint the connection of hNUDC with Mpl in the regulation of megakaryocyte maturation.
Nuclear migration depends on microtubules, the dynein motor complex, and regulatory components like LIS1 and NUDC. We sought to identify new binding partners of the fungal LIS1 homolog NUDF to clarify its function in dynein regulation. We therefore analyzed the association between NUDF and NUDC in Aspergillus nidulans. NUDF and NUDC directly interacted in yeast two-hybrid experiments via NUDF's WD40 domain. NUDC-green fluorescent protein (NUDC-GFP) was localized to immobile dots in the cytoplasm and at the hyphal cortex, some of which were spindle pole bodies (SPBs). We showed by bimolecular fluorescence complementation microscopy that NUDC directly interacted with NUDF at SPBs at different stages of the cell cycle. Applying tandem affinity purification, we isolated the NUDF-associated protein BNFA (for binding to NUDF). BNFA was dispensable for growth and for nuclear migration. GFP-BNFA fusions localized to SPBs at different stages of the cell cycle. This localization depended on NUDF, since the loss of NUDF resulted in the cytoplasmic accumulation of BNFA. BNFA did not bind to NUDC in a yeast two-hybrid assay. These results show that the conserved NUDF and NUDC proteins play a concerted role at SPBs at different stages of the cell cycle and that NUDF recruits additional proteins specifically to the dynein complex at SPBs.
We have recently identified a human homolog of a fungal nuclear migration protein (hNUDC) that binds specifically with the extracellular domain of thrombopoietin receptor (Mpl). Preliminary studies with human CD34(+) cells cultured in serum-free medium and normal mice showed that hNUDC appears to act as a cytokine, triggering many of the same responses as thrombopoietin (TPO). More intriguingly, recent data gained using a NIH 3T3 system have demonstrated that hNUDC exerts its biological activities through activation of Mpl. In this study, we further compared the biological functions of hNUDC with TPO in an EPO-dependent UT-7 cell line that was engineered to express the thrombopoietin receptor (Mpl). These Mpl-expressing cells following stimulation by either hNUDC or TPO exhibited overlapping patterns of megakaryocytic proliferation and differentiation, manifested by cell morphological change, polyploidy and expression of CD41(+). Similar with TPO, hNUDC induced a sustained activation of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases-1 and -2 (ERK1/2) as well as p38 mitogen-activated kinase (p38 MAPK) pathways and these activations were inhibited in the presence of PD98059 or SB203580. Further evidence is provided that PD98059 or SB203580 inhibited hNUDC- or TPO-induced cell proliferation and differentiation, suggesting that ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways are necessary in megakaryocyte development.
Thrombopoietin receptor (Mpl) belongs to the cytokine receptor surperfamily with a large extracellular N-terminal portion responsible for cytokine recognition and binding. Thrombopoietin (TPO) has so far been the only widely studied cytokine for Mpl. However we have recently identified human NUDC (hNUDC), previously described as a human homolog of a fungal nuclear migration protein, as another putative binding partner of Mpl. The purpose of this study is to test the extent of the functioning of hNUDC by identifying protein-protein interactions with Mpl in mammalian cells. The full-length cDNAs encoding Mpl and hNUDC were cloned into pEGFP-N1 and pDsRed2-N1 respectively which were subsequently expressed as Mpl-EGFP (green) and hNUDC-DsRed (red) fusion proteins. Using ELISA and immunofluorescence studies, we have demonstrated the direct binding of hNUDC to cell surface-captured Mpl. We also observed that hNUDC induced significant changes in cellular morphology in NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with pMpl-EGFP. Interestingly, these morphological changes were characteristic of cells undergoing megakaryocyte differentiation. Extracellular-signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) have been shown to mediate such megakaryocyte-like differentiation. In addition, co-expression of Mpl-EGFP and hNUDC-DsRed led to the release of hNUDC-DsRed into the culture medium.
Lissencephaly is a developmental brain disorder characterized by a smooth cerebral surface, thickened cortex and misplaced neurons. Classical lissencephaly is caused by mutations in LIS1, which encodes a WD-repeat protein involved in cytoplasmic dynein regulation, mitosis and nuclear migration. Several proteins required for nuclear migration in Aspergillus bind directly to Lis1, including NudC. Mammalian NudC is highly expressed in ciliated epithelia, and localizes to motile cilia in various tissues. Moreover, a NudC ortholog is upregulated upon deflagellation in Chlamydomonas. We found that mammalian Lis1 localizes to motile cilia in trachea and oviduct, but is absent from non-motile primary cilia. Furthermore, we cloned a gene encoding a Lis1-like protein (CrLis1) from Chlamydomonas. CrLis1 is a approximately 37 kDa protein that contains seven WD-repeat domains, similar to Lis1 proteins from other organisms. Immunoblotting using an anti-CrLis1 antibody revealed that this protein is present in the flagellum and is depleted from flagella of mutants with defective outer dynein arm assembly, including one strain that lacks only the alpha heavy chain/light chain 5 thioredoxin complex. Biochemical experiments confirmed that CrLis1 associates with outer dynein arm components and revealed that CrLis1 binds directly to rat NudC. Our results suggest that Lis1 and NudC are present in cilia and flagella and may regulate outer dynein arm activity.
Microtubule targeting based therapies have revolutionized cancer treatment; however, resistance and side effects remain a major limitation. Therefore, novel strategies that can overcome these limitations are urgently needed. We made a novel discovery that fisetin, a hydroxyflavone, is a microtubule stabilizing agent. Fisetin binds to tubulin and stabilizes microtubules with binding characteristics far superior than paclitaxel. Surface plasmon resonance and computational docking studies suggested that fisetin binds to β-tubulin with superior affinity compared to paclitaxel. Fisetin treatment of human prostate cancer cells resulted in robust up-regulation of microtubule associated proteins (MAP)-2 and -4. In addition, fisetin treated cells were enriched in α-tubulin acetylation, an indication of stabilization of microtubules. Fisetin significantly inhibited PCa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Nudc, a protein associated with microtubule motor dynein/dynactin complex that regulates microtubule dynamics, was inhibited with fisetin treatment. Further, fisetin treatment of a P-glycoprotein overexpressing multidrug-resistant cancer cell line NCI/ADR-RES inhibited the viability and colony formation. Our results offer in vitro proof-of-concept for fisetin as a microtubule targeting agent. We suggest that fisetin could be developed as an adjuvant for treatment of prostate and other cancer types. 
NudC is a highly conserved protein necessary for cytoplasmic dynein-mediated nuclear migration in Aspergillus nidulans. NudC interacts genetically with Aspergillus NudF and physically with its mammalian orthologue Lis1, which is crucial for nuclear and neuronal migration during brain development. To test for related roles for NudC, we performed in utero electroporation into embryonic rat brain of cDNAs encoding shRNAs as well as wild-type and mutant forms of NudC. We show here that NudC, like Lis1, is required for neuronal migration during neocorticogenesis and we identify a specific role in apical nuclear migration in radial glial progenitor cells. These results identify a novel neuronal migration gene with a specific role in interkinetic nuclear migration, consistent with cytoplasmic dynein regulation.
The human homolog of a fungal nuclear migration protein (hNUDC) has recently been shown in in vitro studies to overlap in function with the cytokine factor thrombopoietin (TPO) in its ability to induce human megakaryocyte development. In the present study, we sought to confirm the hypothesis that combination of TPO and NUDC may result in additive or synergistic effects on megakaryocyte maturation in bone marrow. For this purpose, murine bone marrow cells were stimulated with murine NUDC (mNUDC), either alone or in conjunction with murine thrombopoietin (mTPO), in serum-free medium. Studies showed that mNUDC + mTPO treatments resulted in the greatest number of colony-forming unit of megakaryocytes. Concomitantly, mNUDC + mTPO enhanced expression of CD61 and elicited the largest number of megakaryocytes, with higher ploidy and larger size. In addition, in vivo experiments revealed an elevation of platelet levels in normal and thrombocytopenic mice that had been administered mTPO + mNUDC. Moreover, mRNA levels of mNUDC and murine thrombopoietin receptor were much higher than the levels of mTPO mRNA at two different phases of normal murine megakaryocyte maturation. Furthermore, levels of ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation are higher with mNUDC in combination with mTPO. This study demonstrates that the combination of mTPO and mNUDC provides additive induction of megakaryocyte maturation in vitro and platelet production in vivo.
The NudC family consists of four conserved proteins with representatives in all eukaryotes. The archetypal nudC gene from Aspergillus nidulans is a member of the nud gene family that is involved in the maintenance of nuclear migration. This family also includes nudF, whose human orthologue, Lis1, codes for a protein essential for brain cortex development. Three paralogues of NudC are known in vertebrates: NudC, NudC-like (NudCL), and NudC-like 2 (NudCL2). The fourth distantly related member of the family, CML66, contains a NudC-like domain. The three principal NudC proteins have no catalytic activity but appear to play as yet poorly defined roles in proliferating and dividing cells. We present crystallographic and NMR studies of the human NudC protein and discuss the results in the context of structures recently deposited by structural genomics centers (i.e., NudCL and mouse NudCL2). All proteins share the same core CS domain characteristic of proteins acting either as cochaperones of Hsp90 or as independent small heat shock proteins. However, while NudC and NudCL dimerize via an N-terminally located coiled coil, the smaller NudCL2 lacks this motif and instead dimerizes as a result of unique domain swapping. We show that NudC and NudCL, but not NudCL2, inhibit the aggregation of several target proteins, consistent with an Hsp90-independent heat shock protein function. Importantly, and in contrast to several previous reports, none of the three proteins is able to form binary complexes with Lis1. The availability of structural information will be of help in further studies on the cellular functions of the NudC family.
Regulation of cell division requires the concerted function of proteins and protein complexes that properly mediate cytoskeletal dynamics. NudC is an evolutionarily conserved protein of undetermined function that associates with microtubules and interacts with several key regulators of mitosis, such as polo-kinase 1 (Plk1) and dynein. NudC is essential for proper mitotic progression, and homologs have been identified in species ranging from fungi to humans. In this paper, we report the characterization of the Caenorhabditis elegans NudC homolog, NUD-1, as a protein exhibiting molecular chaperone activity. All NudC/NUD-1 proteins share a conserved p23/HSP20 domain predicted by three-dimensional modeling [Garcia-Ranea, Mirey, Camonis, Valencia, FEBS Lett 529(2-3):162-167, 2002]. We demonstrate that nematode NUD-1 is able to prevent the aggregation of two substrate proteins, citrate synthase (CS) and luciferase, at stoichiometric concentrations. Further, NUD-1 also protects the native state of CS from thermal inactivation by significantly reducing the inactivation rate of this enzyme. To further determine if NUD-1/substrate complexes were productive or simply "dead-end" unfolding intermediates, a luciferase refolding assay was utilized. Following thermal denaturation, rabbit reticulocyte lysate and ATP were added and luciferase activity measured. In the presence of NUD-1, nearly all of the luciferase activity was regained, indicating that unfolded intermediates complexed with NUD-1 could be refolded. These studies represent the first functional evidence for a member of this mitotically essential protein family as having chaperone activity and facilitates elucidation of the role such proteins play in chaperone complexes utilized in cell division. C. elegans NUD-1 is a member of an evolutionary conserved protein family of unknown function involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics. NUD-1 and its mammalian homolog, NudC, function with the dynein motor complex to ensure proper cell division, and knockdown or overexpression of these proteins leads to disruption of mitosis. In this paper, we show that NUD-1 possesses ATP-independent chaperone activity comparable to that of small heat shock proteins and cochaperones and that changes in phosphorylation state functionally alter chaperone activity in a phosphomimetic NUD-1 mutant.
The knowledge of tumor-associated antigens is required for most types of immunotherapy and can substantially facilitate diagnosis. To identify potential tumor-associated genes expressed in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), we used three complementary strategies: antigens which elicit a humoral immune response in CTCL patients were detected by serological analysis of a recombinant cDNA expression library. cDNAs differentially expressed in CTCL but not peripheral blood monocytes were identified by comparative cDNA hybridization and suppression subtractive hybridization. We identified 43 genes selectively expressed by CTCL cells, that have not yet been described in the context of CTCL development, but most of which had been reported to be associated with cancer. Expression analysis by database mining and subsequently RT-PCR on selected clones confirmed their selective expression in CTCL tissues. Serological tests showed that 15 clones were recognized by sera of CTCL patients but not of healthy donors. Analysis of serological tests for 11 clones using serum antibody detection array (SADA) and 100 sera of controls and CTCL patients each revealed up to 5% reactive sera in the tumor group. The expression pattern of the detected clones and their immunogenicity demonstrates that they might be relevant for the understanding of CTCL and suggests particularly three clones, HD-CL-41 (DRAK2), HD-CL-49 (nudC) and HD-CL-12 (ZNF195) for further analysis with respect to their prognostic and therapeutic value for CTCL.
We report the characterization of a cDNA induced in mouse macrophages that encodes a 332-amino acid protein with extensive sequence identity with members of the mammalian nudC-like genes. The interaction between mNUDC and the regulatory beta subunit of platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase I (PAF-AH(I)) shown in this article indicates a new function of NUDC. Thus, we show that NUDC increases the catalytic activity of PAF-AH(I) and that this regulatory activity is located in the carboxyl terminal half of the protein which is highly conserved. This suggests a novel function for mammalian nudC-like genes as anti-inflammatory proteins.
We examined the proteomic background of esophageal cancer. We used laser microdissection to obtain tumor tissues from 72 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cases and adjacent normal tissues in 57 of these cases. The 2D-DIGE generated quantitative expression profiles with 1730 protein spots. Based on the intensity of the protein spots, unsupervised classification distinguished the tumor tissues from their normal counterparts, and subdivided the tumor tissues according to their histological differentiation. We identified 498 protein spots with altered intensity in the tumor tissues, which protein identification by LC-MS/MS showed to correspond to 217 gene products. We also found 41 protein spots that were associated with nodal metastasis, and identified 33 proteins corresponding to the spots, including cancer-associated proteins such as alpha-actinin 4, hnRNP K, periplakin, squamous cell carcinoma antigen 1 and NudC. The identified cancer-associated proteins have been previously reported to be individually involved in a range of cancer types, and our study observed them collectively in a single type of malignancy, esophageal cancer. As the identified proteins are involved in important biological processes such as cytoskeletal/structural organization, transportation, chaperon, oxidoreduction, transcription and signal transduction, they may function in a coordinate manner in carcinogenesis and tumor progression of esophageal cancer.
The proteome of a proliferating human stem cell line was analyzed and then utilized to detect stem cell differentiation-associated changes in the protein profile. The analysis was conducted with a stable human fetal midbrain stem cell line (ReNcell VM) that displays the properties of a neural stem cell. Therefore, acquisition of proteomic data should be representative of cultured human neural stem cells (hNSCs) in general. Here we present a 2-DE protein-map of this cell line with annotations of 402 spots representing 318 unique proteins identified by MS. The subsequent proteome profiling of differentiating cells of this stem cell line at days 0, 4 and 7 of differentiation revealed changes in the expression of 49 identified spots that could be annotated to 45 distinct proteins. This differentiation-associated expression pattern was validated by Western blot analysis for transgelin-2, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, as well as peroxiredoxin 1 and 4. The group of regulated proteins also included NudC, ubiquilin-1, STRAP, stress-70 protein, creatine kinase B, glial fibrillary acidic protein and vimentin. Our results reflect the large rearrangement of the proteome during the differentiation process of the stem cells to terminally differentiated neurons and offer the possibility for further characterization of specific targets driving the stem cell differentiation.
Aspergillus fumigatus causes invasive aspergillosis, a mycosis that is usually fatal in immunocompromised patients. Functional genomics in this fungus will aid the discovery of novel antifungal drugs to treat invasive aspergillosis. However, there is still a need for appropriate molecular genetic tools to facilitate such functional studies. Here, we describe the use of a conditional gene expression system allowing the identification of novel therapeutic targets through validation of essential genes in A. fumigatus. This system is based on the capacity of the Aspergillus nidulans alcA promoter (alcA(p)) to tightly regulate gene expression in this fungus. Conditionally regulated gene expression in A. fumigatus was demonstrated by transcriptional and phenotypic analyses of strains expressing a nuclear migration gene with a terminal phenotype, the A. fumigatus nudC gene, under control of this promoter. This conditional expression system, the first one described in A. fumigatus, will also be useful for investigating the function of essential genes by altering the threonine/glucose ratio in the growth medium.
NudC, a nuclear movement protein that associates with dynein, was originally cloned as a mitogen-inducible early growth response gene. NudC forms a biochemical complex with components of the dynein/dynactin complex and is suggested to play a role in translocation of nuclei in proliferating neuronal progenitors as well as in migrating neurons in culture. Here, we show that NudC plays multiple roles in mitosis and cytokinesis in cultured mammalian cells. Altering NudC levels by either small interfering RNA-mediated gene silencing or adenovirus-mediated overexpression resulted in multinucleated cells and cells with persistent intercellular connections and disorganized midzone and midbody matrix. These phenotypes suggest a failure in cytokinesis in NudC altered cells. Further, a key mitotic enzyme, polo-like kinase, is mislocalized from the centrosomes and the midbody in NudC altered cells. Gene silencing of nud-1, the Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of NudC, led to a loss of midzone microtubules and the rapid regression of the cleavage furrow, which resulted in one-celled embryos containing two nuclei. The loss of midzone microtubule organization owing to silencing of the NudC/nud-1 gene in two systems, coupled with the loss of Plk1 from mitotic structures in mammalian cells, provide clues to the cytokinesis defect and the multinucleation phenotype. Our findings suggest that NudC functions in mitosis and cytokinesis, in part by regulating microtubule organization at the midzone and midbody.
We identified families of proteins characterized by the presence of a domain similar to human p23 protein, which include proteins such as Sgt1, involved in the yeast kinetochore assembly; melusin, involved in specific interactions with the cytoplasmic integrin beta1 domain; Rar1, related to pathogenic resistance in plants, and to development in animals; B5+B5R flavo-hemo cytochrome NAD(P)H oxidoreductase type B in humans and mice; and NudC, involved in nucleus migration during mitosis. We also found that p23 and the HSP20/alpha-crystallin family of heat shock proteins, which share the same three-dimensional folding, show a pattern of conserved residues that points to a common origin in the evolution of both protein domains. The p23 and HSP20/alpha-crystallin phylogenetic relationship and their similar role in chaperone activity suggest a common function, probably involving protein-protein interaction, for those proteins containing p23-like domains.
Prolactin and other cytokines regulate lymphocyte proliferation through the activation of a number of genes, one of which was identified as RnudC from a prolactin-dependent rat T cell line, Nb2. RnudC encodes a 45-kDa protein whose carboxy terminal 94 amino acids are similar to the carboxy terminus of the Aspergillus nidulans nuclear movement protein NUDC. In Nb2 T cells, RNUDC protein levels are induced two- to threefold by prolactin stimulation. This prolactin-inducible increase in RNUDC protein levels is due in part to an increase in RNUDC protein synthesis between 8 and 12 h, during the G1/S transition. Newly synthesized RNUDC protein is very stable, exhibiting a half-life of greater than 8 h. RNUDC has also been identified in many different cell types and species, ranging from fibroblasts to neuronal cells and from mouse to human, suggesting a highly conserved function. Immunocytochemical studies, using affinity-purified rabbit anti-rat RNUDC antibodies, have localized a significant fraction of the RNUDC protein to the region of the Golgi apparatus in interphase rat Nb2 T cells, monkey kidney fibroblast COS-1 cells, and human 2AG10 adenocarcinoma cells. Treatment of 2AG10 cells with the microtubule-depolymerizing drug nocodazole, which causes dispersion of the Golgi apparatus, led to a diffuse pattern of RNUDC staining. Removal of nocodazole, which allowed the reformation of the Golgi apparatus, led to the reconcentration of RNUDC staining to the Golgi region. Taken together, these studies suggest that a fraction of RNUDC is tightly associated with the Golgi apparatus in many different mammalian cell types.
Clone 15 (c15) was originally identified as a PRL-inducible gene in activated T cells. Sequence analysis of c15 revealed that the last 94 amino acids of c15 are 68% identical and 78% similar to the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans nuclear movement protein NUDC. The identification of the mammalian (rat) c15 protein suggests that the carboxy-terminal NUDC-like region has been conserved over evolution for an important structure and/or function. To determine whether c15 is functionally analogous to NUDC, complementation studies were performed using the inducible/repressible pAL5 vector system. The results of the complementation experiments show that the full-length mammalian c15 protein is not only capable of rescuing the nuclear movement defect of the nudC3 mutants, but is also able to restore the expression of the downstream endogenous NUDF protein to near wild type levels. These results indicate that rat c15 and fungal NUDC not only share similar structures, but also serve similar functions. Taken together, the structural and functional conservation between c15 and NUDC is consistent with the notion that c15 is the rat homolog of nudC and has therefore been given the name RnudC.
Simple RNA animal viruses generally enter cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis followed by acid pH dependent release and translocation of RNA across the endosomal membrane. The T = 3 nodaviruses contain prefabricated pentameric helical bundles that are cleaved from the remainder of the subunits by an assembly-dependent auto-proteolysis and they are positioned for release through 5-fold axes of the particle. We previously proposed that these bundles may serve as conduits for RNA membrane translocation. Additional support for this hypothesis is now provided by the first atomic resolution structure of a T = 4 RNA virus, where we find cleavage sites and helical bundles nearly identical with those observed in T = 3 nodaviruses. The helices are of sufficient length to span a membrane bilayer and the internal diameter of the coiled bundle could accommodate ssRNA. The T = 4 particle has a mean outer diameter of 410 A and is formed by 240 copies of a single subunit type. The subunit is composed of a helical inner domain (where the cleavage occurs) containing residues preceding and following a canonical, viral, eight-stranded beta-sandwich that forms the contiguous shell. Inserted between two strands of the shell domain are 133 residues with an immunoglobulin c-type fold. The initial gene product consists of 644 amino acid residues and is cleaved between residues Asn570 and Phe571 in the mature particle determined in this analysis.
To examine how PRL regulates lymphocyte proliferation, a number of PRL-activated genes were identified from a PRL-dependent rat T lymphoma cell line, Nb2. One of the downstream genes in the PRL signaling cascade was identified as clone 15 (c15). PRL stimulation of quiescent Nb2 T cells results in the expression of a 1.7-kilobase c15 mRNA, which reaches maximum levels between 8 and 10 h after stimulation. Corresponding [3H]thymidine incorporation experiments show that the maximum level of c15 mRNA expression correlates with the G1/S transition phase of the cell cycle. Sequencing of approximately 1.3-kilobase cDNA revealed one open reading frame that predicts a 332-amino acid protein. In vitro transcription/translation of c15 cDNA resulted in the production of a 45-kilodalton protein. Sequence analysis revealed that the c15 open reading frame contains a potential nuclear localization signal, a very acidic region, and a carboxy-terminal region of 94 amino acids which are 68% identical and 78% similar to the nuclear movement protein, NUDC, found in Aspergillus nidulans. Such a high degree of conservation suggests that the NUDC-like motif in c15 has been conserved through evolution for an important structure and/or function.
The analysis of fungal mutants has had an extraordinary impact on our understanding of the biochemistry and regulation of mitosis. In this article we review the contribution of work on the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans to the molecular genetics of mitosis.
Nudix pyrophosphatases, ubiquitous in all organisms, have not been well studied. Recent implications that some of them may be involved in response to stress and in pathogenesis indicate that they play important biological functions. We have investigated NudC Nudix proteins from the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato str. DC3000 and from the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1161. We found that these homologous enzymes are homodimeric and in vitro preferentially hydrolyse NADH. The P. syringae mutant strain deficient in NudC accumulated NADH and displayed significant defects in growth, motility and biofilm formation. The wild type copy of the nudC gene with its cognate promoter delivered in trans into the nudC mutant restored its fitness. However, introduction of the P. syringae nudC gene under the control of the strong tacp promoter into either P. syringae or P. aeruginosa cells had a toxic effect on both strains. Opposite to P. syringae NudC, the P. aeruginosa NudC deficiency as well as its overproduction had no visible impact on cells. Moreover, P. aeruginosa NudC does not compensate the lack of its counterpart in the P. syringae mutant. These results indicate that NudC from P. syringae, but not from P. aeruginosa is vital for bacteria. 
The purpose of this study was to examine the gene expression profile of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized peripheral blood (mPB)-derived progenitors, used in transplantation.
We correlated gene expression patterns of highly enriched steady-state peripheral blood (PB)- and mPB-derived CD71+ cells by microarray and ingenuity pathway analyses, to identify the transcriptional program during in vitro erythroid differentiation.
The gene expression was more than doubled in mPB-derived (4180 genes) compared to PB-derived erythroid progenitors (1667 genes) while PB-and mPB-derived erythroid progenitors shared 1534 common genes. Comparative analysis of transcript levels showed differential expression of 54 genes between cultured erythroid progenitors of PB and mPB origin, where we identified common 13 downregulated and 30 upregulated genes. The most significant genes in mPB-derived erythroid progenitors were P4HB, DDIA3, ARPC2 and ATP5G3. Regarding G-CSF stimulation the G-CSF receptor CSF2RB (1.1-fold) was linked via STAT3 to erythroid-specific ALAS2 (2.9-fold) and GATA2 (1.3-fold) factors, all upregulated in mPB-derived erythroid progenitors, coupled to common upregulated NUDC gene involved in the proliferation of erythroid cells.
This report provides an extensive transcriptional profile of cultured erythroid progenitors and leads to a better understanding of diversity among the progenitor sources.
JMJD3, a Jumonji C family histone demethylase, plays an important role in the regulation of inflammation induced by the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) in response to various stimuli. JMJD3 is a histone-3 lysine-27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) demethylase, a histone mark associated with transcriptional repression and activation of a diverse set of genes. The present study assessed stable JMJD3 knockdown (KD)-dependent proteomic profiling in human leukemia monocyte (THP-1) cells to analyze the JMJD3-mediated differential changes of marker expression in inflammatory cells. To analyze the protein expression profile of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-stimulated JMJD3-kd THP-1 cells, we employed matrix-assisted-laser-desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Additionally, Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) was applied to establish the molecular networks. A comparative proteomic profile was determined in TNF-α-treated both of JMJD3-kd THP-1 cells and THP-1 scrambled (sc) cells. The expression of tripartite motif protein (TRIM5), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glia maturation factor-γ (GMFG), caspase recruitment domain family, member 14 (CARMA2), and dUTP pyrophosphatase were significantly down-regulated, whereas heat shock protein beta-1 (HspB1) and prohibition were significantly up-regulated in JMJD3-kd THP-1 cells. The molecular and signaling networks of the differentially expressed proteins in JMJD3-kd THP-1 cells were determined by IPA. The molecular network signatures and functional proteomics obtained in this study may facilitate the suppression of different key inflammatory regulators through JMJD3-attenuation, which would be crucial to evaluate potential therapeutic targets and to elucidate the molecular mechanism of JMJD3-kd dependent effects in THP-1 cells.
Leaf primordia form around the shoot apical meristem, which consists of indeterminate stem cells. Upon initiation of leaf development, adaxial-abaxial patterning is crucial for appropriate lateral expansion, via cellular proliferation, and the formation of flat symmetric leaves. Many genes that specify such patterning have been identified, but regulation by upstream factors of the expression of relevant effector genes remains poorly understood. In Arabidopsis thaliana, ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2 (AS2) and AS1 play important roles in repressing transcription of class 1 KNOTTED1-like homeobox (KNOX) genes and leaf abaxial-determinant effector genes. We report here a mutation, designated enhancer of asymmetric leaves2 and asymmetric leaves1 (eal), that is associated with efficient generation of abaxialized filamentous leaves on the as2 or as1 background. Levels of transcripts of many abaxial-determinant genes, including ETTIN (ETT)/AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR3 (ARF3), and all four class 1 KNOX genes were markedly elevated in as2 eal shoot apices. Rudimentary patterning in as2 eal leaves was suppressed by the ett mutation. EAL encodes BOBBER1 (BOB1), an Arabidopsis ortholog of eukaryotic NudC domain proteins. BOB1 was expressed in plant tissues with division potential and bob1 mutations resulted in lowered levels of transcripts of some cell-cycle genes and decreased rates of cell division in shoot and root apices. Coordinated cellular proliferation, supported by BOB1, and repression of all class 1 KNOX genes, ETT/ARF3 by AS2 (AS1) and BOB1 might be critical for repression of the indeterminate state and of aberrant abaxialization in the presumptive adaxial domain of leaf primordia, which might ensure the formation of flat symmetric leaves.
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are currently used in anticancer therapy to perturb genomic targets involved in gene transcriptional responses. However, the role of HDAC inhibitors on the acetylation of proteins outside of the transcriptional network has not been thoroughly assessed. We recently discovered that one of the HDACs, HDAC3, is localized on the mitotic spindle and regulates proper mitotic progression (1). To determine potential HDAC targets, we undertook a proteomics approach to search for acetylated proteins in mitosis (2). First, we synchronized cells in mitosis and used a polyclonal anti-acetyl-Lysine antiserum to immunoprecipitate acetylated proteins, followed by their identification by LC-ESI-MS/MS. We then confirmed the acetylation status of several mitotic proteins by anti-acetyl-Lysine immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal antibody followed by Western blot analyses of the proteins of interest. We further confirmed by a reciprocal immunoprecipitation with protein-specific antibody followed by Western blot analysis with another monoclonal anti-acetyl-Lysine antibody. Interestingly, the acetylation of a subset of the mitotic proteins can be further enhanced by treatment with apicidin, a small molecule inhibitor with specificity for HDAC3, suggesting that their acetylation may be regulated by HDAC3 in mitosis. In this chapter, we describe the various techniques using NudC as an example of an acetylated protein that is sensitive to apicidin treatment in mitosis.
Heterozygous LIS1 mutations are the most common cause of human lissencephaly, a human neuronal migration defect, and DCX mutations are the most common cause of X-linked lissencephaly. Lissencephaly is characterized by a smooth cerebral surface, thick cortex and dilated lateral ventricles associated with mental retardation and seizures due to defective neuronal migration. Lissencephaly due to the heterozygous loss of the gene LIS1 is a good example of a haploinsufficiency disorder. LIS1 was deleted or mutated in a large proportion of patients with lissencephaly in a heterozygous fashion. A series of studies discovered that LIS1 is an essential regulator of cytoplasmic dynein. Notably, the role of LIS1 in regulating dynein activity is highly conserved among eukaryotes. In particular, we reported that LIS1 and NDEL1 are essential for dynein transport to the plus-end of microtubules by kinesin, which is essential to maintain the proper distribution of cytoplasmic dynein within the cell. In addition, we report that mNUDC (mammalian NUDC) interacts with kinesin-1 and is required for the anterograde transport of a cytoplasmic dynein complex by kinesin-1. A microtubule organization and motor proteins are further modulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and palmitoylation. These modifications share a common pathway with mitotic cell division. For example, Aurora-A is activated during neurite elongation, and phosphorylates NDEL1, which facilitates microtubule extension into neurite processes. Elucidations of molecular pathways involving neuronal migrations provide us a chance to design a novel strategy for neurological disorder due to defective neuronal migration. For example, inhibition of calpain protects LIS1 from proteolysis resulting in the augmentation of LIS1 levels, which leads to rescue of the phenotypes that are observed in Lis1+/- mice. Endeavoring to address the regulation of the microtubule network and motor proteins will help in understanding not only corticogenesis but neurodegenerative disorders.
NADH pyrophosphatase (NudC) catalyses the hydrolysis of NAD(H) to AMP and NMN(H) [nicotinamide mononucleotide (reduced form)]. NudC multiple sequence alignment reveals that homologues from most Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates, but not other mycobacterial species, have a polymorphism at the highly conserved residue 237. To elucidate the functional significance of this polymorphism, comparative analyses were performed using representative NudC isoforms from M. tuberculosis H37Rv (NudC(Rv)) and M. bovis BCG (NudC(BCG)). Biochemical analysis showed that the P237Q polymorphism prevents dimer formation, and results in a loss of enzymatic activity. Importantly, NudC(BCG) was found to degrade the active forms of isoniazid (INH), INH-NAD and ethionamide (ETH), ETH-NAD. Consequently, overexpression of NudC(BCG) in Mycobacterium smegmatis mc(2)155 and M. bovis BCG resulted in a high level of resistance to both INH and ETH. Further genetic studies showed that deletion of the nudC gene in M. smegmatis mc(2)155 and M. bovis BCG resulted in increased susceptibility to INH and ETH. Moreover, inactivation of NudC in both strains caused a defect in drug tolerance phenotype for both drugs in exposure assays. Taken together, these data suggest that mycobacterial NudC plays an important role in the inactivation of INH and ETH.
The ability of mammalian cell lines to sustain cell specific productivity (Qp) over the full duration of bioprocess culture is a highly desirable phenotype, but the molecular basis for sustainable productivity has not been previously investigated in detail. In order to identify proteins that may be associated with a sustained productivity phenotype, we have conducted a proteomic profiling analysis of two matched pairs of monoclonal antibody-producing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines that differ in their ability to sustain productivity over a 10 day fed-batch culture.
Proteomic profiling of inherent differences between the two sets of comparators using 2D-DIGE (Difference Gel Electrophoresis) and LC-MS/MS resulted in the identification of 89 distinct differentially expressed proteins. Overlap comparisons between the two sets of cell line pairs identified 12 proteins (AKRIB8, ANXA1, ANXA4, EIF3I, G6PD, HSPA8, HSP90B1, HSPD1, NUDC, PGAM1, RUVBL1 and CNN3) that were differentially expressed in the same direction.
These proteins may have an important role in sustaining high productivity of recombinant protein over the duration of a fed-batch bioprocess culture. It is possible that many of these proteins could be useful for future approaches to successfully manipulate or engineer CHO cells in order to sustain productivity of recombinant protein.
Used RFP gene to construct a RNA interference vector for convenience to obtain the good effective hairpins sequence.
NUDC and RFP genes were cloned into pDs vector separately, resulting in pDs-NUDC- RFP. as above, human U6 promoter and 9 hairpins sequence of NUDC were cloned into the pDs- NUDC-RFP vector separately.The RNA interfererence vectors target to 9 points of NUDC were constructed. Construct- ed recombinant vectors and then were identified by restrictive digestion and DNA sequencing.293T cells were transfected with the recombinant DNA samples by the liposome complex method, and then fluorescence photographs were taken.
Enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing showed that the target gene and shRNA fragments were correctly inserted in pDs vector. fluorescence photographs showed that shNUDC-A is the best effective fragment.
The NUDC gene targeted shRNA and its vector are successfully constructed.
Mitosis is a highly regulated process in which errors can lead to genomic instability, a hallmark of cancer. During this phase of the cell cycle, transcription is silent and RNA translation is inhibited. Thus, mitosis is largely driven by post-translational modification of proteins, including phosphorylation, methylation, ubiquitination, and sumoylation. Here, we show that protein acetylation is prevalent during mitosis. To identify proteins that are acetylated, we synchronized HeLa cells in early prometaphase and immunoprecipitated lysine-acetylated proteins with antiacetyl-lysine antibody. The immunoprecipitated proteins were identified by LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. These include proteins involved in RNA translation, RNA processing, cell cycle regulation, transcription, chaperone function, DNA damage repair, metabolism, immune response, and cell structure. Immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analyses confirmed that two RNA processing proteins, eIF4G and RNA helicase A, and several cell cycle proteins, including APC1, anillin, and NudC, were acetylated in mitosis. We further showed that acetylation of APC1 and NudC was enhanced by apicidin treatment, suggesting that their acetylation was regulated by histone deacetylase. Moreover, treating mitotic cells with apicidin or trichostatin A induced spindle abnormalities and cytokinesis failure. These studies suggest that protein acetylation/deacetylation is likely an important regulatory mechanism in mitosis.
Cytokinesis is the last step of the M (mitosis) phase, yet it is crucial for the faithful division of one cell into two. Cytokinesis failure is often associated with cancer. Cytokinesis can be morphologically divided into four steps: cleavage furrow initiation, cleavage furrow ingression, midbody formation and abscission. Molecular studies have revealed that RhoA as well as its regulators and effectors are important players to ensure a successful cytokinesis. At the same time, Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is an important kinase that can target many substrates and carry out different functions during mitosis, including cytokinesis. Recent studies are beginning to unveil a closer tie between Plk1 and RhoA networks. More specifically, Plk1 phosphorylates the centralspindlin complex Cyk4 and MKLP1/CHO1, thus recruiting RhoA guanine nucleotide-exchange factor (GEF) Ect2 through its phosphopeptide-binding BRCT domains. Ect2 itself can be phosphorylated by Plk1 in vitro. Plk1 can also phosphorylate another GEF MyoGEF to regulate RhoA activity. Once activated, RhoA-GTP will activate downstream effectors, including ROCK1 and ROCK2. ROCK2 is among the proteins that associate with Plk1 Polo-binding domain (PBD) in a large proteomic screen, and Plk1 can phosphorylate ROCK2 in vitro. We review current understandings of the interplay between Plk1, RhoA proteins and other proteins (e.g., NudC, MKLP2, PRC1, CEP55) involved in cytokinesis, with particular emphasis of its clinical implications in cancer.
The type I lissencephaly gene product LIS1, a key regulator of cytoplasmic dynein, is critical for cell proliferation, survival, and neuronal migration. However, little is known about the regulation of LIS1. Here, we identify a previously uncharacterized mammalian homolog of Aspergillus NudC, NudCL2 (NudC-like protein 2), as a regulator of LIS1. NudCL2 is localized to the centrosome in interphase, and spindle poles and kinetochores during mitosis, a pattern similar to the localization of LIS1 and cytoplasmic dynein. Depletion of NudCL2 destabilized LIS1 and led to phenotypes resembling those of either dynein or LIS1 deficiency. NudCL2 complexed with and enhanced the interaction between LIS1 and Hsp90. Either disruption of the LIS1-Hsp90 interaction with the C terminus of NudCL2 or inhibition of Hsp90 chaperone function by geldanamycin decreased LIS1 stability. Thus, our results suggest that NudCL2 regulates the LIS1/dynein pathway by stabilizing LIS1 with Hsp90 chaperone. This represents a hitherto undescribed mechanism of the LIS1/dynein regulation in mammalian cells.
The apical domain of the embryo is partitioned into distinct regions that will give rise to the cotyledons and the shoot apical meristem. In this article, we describe a novel screen to identify Arabidopsis thaliana embryo arrest mutants that are defective in this partitioning, and we describe the phenotype of one such mutant, bobber1. bobber1 mutants arrest at the globular stage of development, they express the meristem-specific SHOOTMERISTEMLESS gene throughout the top half of the embryo, and they fail to express the AINTEGUMENTA transcript normally found in cotyledons. Thus, BOBBER1 is required to limit the extent of the meristem domain and/or to promote the development of the cotyledon domains. Based on expression of early markers for apical development, bobber1 mutants differentiate protodermis and undergo normal early apical development. Consistent with a role for auxin in cotyledon development, BOBBER1 mutants fail to express localized maxima of the DR5:green fluorescent protein reporter. BOBBER1 encodes a protein with homology to the Aspergillus nidulans protein NUDC that has similarity to protein chaperones, indicating a possible role for BOBBER1 in synthesis or transport of proteins involved in patterning the Arabidopsis embryo.
Plants have evolved a range of cellular responses to maintain developmental homeostasis and to survive over a range of temperatures. Here, we describe the in vivo and in vitro functions of BOBBER1 (BOB1), a NudC domain containing Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) small heat shock protein. BOB1 is an essential gene required for the normal partitioning and patterning of the apical domain of the Arabidopsis embryo. Because BOB1 loss-of-function mutants are embryo lethal, we used a partial loss-of-function allele (bob1-3) to demonstrate that BOB1 is required for organismal thermotolerance and postembryonic development. Recombinant BOB1 protein functions as a molecular chaperone and prevents the aggregation of a model protein substrate in vitro. In plants, BOB1 is cytoplasmic at basal temperatures, but forms heat shock granules containing canonical small heat shock proteins at high temperatures. In addition to thermotolerance defects, bob1-3 exhibits pleiotropic development defects during all phases of development. bob1-3 phenotypes include decreased rates of shoot and root growth as well as patterning defects in leaves, flowers, and inflorescence meristems. Most eukaryotic chaperones play important roles in protein folding either during protein synthesis or during cellular responses to denaturing stress. Our results provide, to our knowledge, the first evidence of a plant small heat shock protein that has both developmental and thermotolerance functions and may play a role in both of these folding networks.
Tomato stress-associated proteins (SAPs) belong to A20/AN1 zinc finger protein family, some of which have been shown to play important roles in plant stress responses. However, little is known about the functions and underlying molecular mechanisms of SAPs in plant immune responses. In the present study, we reported the function of tomato SlSAP3 in immunity to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000. Silencing of SlSAP3 attenuated while overexpression of SlSAP3 in transgenic tomato increased immunity to Pst DC3000, accompanied with reduced and increased Pst DC3000-induced expression of SA signalling and defence genes, respectively. Flg22-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst and expression of PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) marker genes SlPTI5 and SlLRR22 were strengthened in SlSAP3-OE plants but were weakened in SlSAP3-silenced plants. SlSAP3 interacted with two SlBOBs and the A20 domain in SlSAP3 is critical for the SlSAP3-SlBOB1 interaction. Silencing of SlBOB1 and co-silencing of all three SlBOB genes conferred increased resistance to Pst DC3000, accompanied with increased Pst DC3000-induced expression of SA signalling and defence genes. These data demonstrate that SlSAP3 acts as a positive regulator of immunity against Pst DC3000 in tomato through the SA signalling and that SlSAP3 may exert its function in immunity by interacting with other proteins such as SlBOBs, which act as negative regulators of immunity against Pst DC3000 in tomato.
The nuclear distribution element genes are conserved from fungus to humans. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans expresses two isoforms of nuclear distribution element genes, namely nud-1 and nud-2. While nud-1 was functionally demonstrated to be the worm nudC ortholog, bioinformatic analysis revealed that the nud-2 gene encodes the worm ortholog of the mammalian NDE1 (Nuclear Distribution Element 1 or NudE) and NDEL1 (NDE-Like 1 or NudEL) genes, which share overlapping roles in brain development in mammals and also mediate the axon guidance in mammalian and C. elegans neurons. A significantly higher NDEL1 enzyme activity was shown in treatment non-resistant compared to treatment resistant SCZ patients, who essentially present response to the therapy with atypical clozapine but not with typical antipsychotics. Using C. elegans as a model, we tested the consequence of nud genes suppression in the effects of typical and atypical antipsychotics. To assess the role of nud genes and antipsychotic drugs over C. elegans behavior, we measured body bend frequency, egg laying and pharyngeal pumping, which traits are controlled by specific neurons and neurotransmitters known to be involved in SCZ, as dopamine and serotonin. Evaluation of metabolic and behavioral response to the pharmacotherapy with these antipsychotics demonstrates an important unbalance in serotonin pathway in both nud-1 and nud-2 knockout worms, with more significant effects for nud-2 knockout. The present data also show an interesting trend of mutant knockout worm strains to present a metabolic profile closer to that observed for the wild-type animals after the treatment with the typical antipsychotic haloperidol, but which was not observed for the treatment with the atypical antipsychotic clozapine. Paradoxically, behavioral assays showed more evident effects for clozapine than for haloperidol, which is in line with previous studies with rodent animal models and clinical evaluations with SCZ patients. In addition, the validity and reliability of using this experimental animal model to further explore the convergence between the dopamine/serotonin pathways and neurodevelopmental processes was demonstrated here, and the potential usefulness of this model for evaluating the metabolic consequences of treatments with antipsychotics is also suggested.
We report the chemical synthesis of a set of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) cap analogues containing chemical modifications that reduce their susceptibility to NAD-RNA-degrading enzymes. These analogues can be incorporated into transcripts in a similar way as NAD. Biochemical characterization of RNAs carrying these caps with DXO, NudC, and Nudt12 enzymes led to the identification of compounds that can be instrumental in unraveling so far unaddressed biological aspects of NAD-RNAs.
Sister chromatid cohesion plays a key role in ensuring precise chromosome segregation during mitosis, which is mediated by the multisubunit cohesin complex. However, the molecular regulation of cohesin subunits stability remains unclear. Here, we show that NudCL2 (NudC-like protein 2) is essential for the stability of cohesin subunits by regulating Hsp90 ATPase activity in mammalian cells. Depletion of NudCL2 induces mitotic defects and premature sister chromatid separation and destabilizes cohesin subunits that interact with NudCL2. Similar defects are also observed upon inhibition of Hsp90 ATPase activity. Interestingly, ectopic expression of Hsp90 efficiently rescues the protein instability and functional deficiency of cohesin induced by NudCL2 depletion, but not vice versa. Moreover, NudCL2 not only binds to Hsp90, but also significantly modulates Hsp90 ATPase activity and promotes the chaperone function of Hsp90. Taken together, these data suggest that NudCL2 is a previously undescribed Hsp90 cochaperone to modulate sister chromatid cohesion by stabilizing cohesin subunits, providing a hitherto unrecognized mechanism that is crucial for faithful chromosome segregation during mitosis.
The NAD+/NADH ratio and the total NAD(H) play important roles for whole-cell biochemical redox transformations. After the carbon source is exhausted, the degradation of NAD(H) could contribute to a decline in the rate of a desired conversion. In this study, methods to slow the native rate of NAD(H) degradation were examined using whole-cell Escherichia coli with two model oxidative NAD+-dependent biotransformations. A high phosphate concentration (50 mM) was observed to slow NAD(H) degradation. We also constructed E. coli strains with deletions in genes coding several enzymes involved in NAD+ degradation. In shake-flask experiments, the total NAD(H) concentration positively correlated with conversion of xylitol to L-xylulose by xylitol 4-dehydrogenase, and the greatest conversion (80%) was observed using MG1655 nadR nudC mazG/pZE12-xdh/pCS27-nox. Controlled 1-L batch processes comparing E. coli nadR nudC mazG with a wild-type background strain demonstrated a 30% increase in final L-xylulose concentration (5.6 vs. 7.9 g/L) and a 25% increase in conversion (0.53 vs. 0.66 g/g). MG1655 nadR nudC mazG was also examined for the conversion of galactitol to L-tagatose by galactitol 2-dehydrogenase. A batch process using 15 g/L glycerol and 10 g/L galactitol generated over 9.4 g/L L-tagatose, corresponding to 90% conversion and a yield of 0.95 g L-tagatose/g galactitol consumed. The results demonstrate the value of minimizing NAD(H) degradation as a means to improve NAD+-dependent biotransformations.
Microorganisms living in hypersaline microbial mats frequently form consortia under stressful and changing environmental conditions. In this paper, the heterotrophic strain DE2010 from a microalgae consortium (Scenedesmus sp. DE2009) from Ebro Delta microbial mats has been phenotypically and genotypically characterized and identified. In addition, changes in the morphology and biomass of this bacterium in response to nitrogen deficiency stress have been evaluated by correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) combining differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). These isolated bacteria are chemoorganoheterotrophic, gram-negative, and strictly aerobic bacteria that use a variety of amino acids, organic acids, and carbohydrates as carbon and energy sources, and they grow optimally at 27 °C in a pH range of 5 to 9 and tolerate salinity from 0 to 70‰ NaCl. The DNA-sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA and nudC and fixH genes and the metabolic characterization highlight that strain DE2010 corresponds to the species Ochrobactrum anthropi. Cells are rod shaped, 1-3 μm in length, and 0.5 μm wide, but under deprived nitrogen conditions, cells are less abundant and become more round, reducing their length and area and, consequently, their biomass. An increase in the number of pleomorphic cells is observed in cultures grown without nitrogen using different optical and electron microscopy techniques. In addition, the amplification of the fixH gene confirms that Ochrobactrum anthropi DE2010 has the capacity to fix nitrogen, overcoming N2-limiting conditions through a nifH-independent mechanism that is still unidentified.
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death in both men and women. NudC domain containing 1 (NUDCD1) was identified as an oncoprotein which was activated or over-expressed in various human cancers. We aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of NUDCD1 in human CRC. The expression of NUDCD1 in CRC and pericarcinous tissues from 70 CRC patients were determined by real-time PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. The correlation between the expression of NUDCD1 and clinical characteristics was analyzed. The expression of NUDCD1 in five CRC cell lines and normal colon mucosal epithelial cell line was measured by real-time PCR. Then we knock down NUDCD1 in HCT116 and HT 29 cells. The cell viability assay, scratch assay, migration and invasion assay and flow cytometry were used to analyze NUDCD1's effects on the proliferation, migration, invasion, cell cycle and apoptosis of CRC cells. NUDCD1's effects on CRC xenografts of nude mice was also determined. Results showed that the expression of NUDCD1 was much higher in CRC tissues than that in pericarcinous tissues. Over-expression of NUDCD1 in human CRC tissues was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and advanced stages. The expression of NUDCD1 was higher in all of the CRC cell lines than that in normal colon epithelial mucosal cells. To knockdown NUDCD1 resulted in significant decreases in cell viability and proliferation, decreased protein expression of N-cadherin and increased protein expression of E-cadherin which were biomarkers of EMT, arrested the cell cycle and increased apoptosis via down-regulated cyclin D1, Bcl2, and up-regulated cleaved-caspase3. Furthermore, to knockdown NUDCD1 inactivated IGF1R-ERK1/2 signaling pathway in vitro and in vivo, and suppressed the xenografts of CRC. In conclusion, NUDCD1 promotes the carcinogenesis and metastasis of CRC through inducing EMT and inhibiting apoptosis, which suggests NUDCD1 be a potential biomarker for CRC.
Nucleoside-containing metabolites such as NAD+ can be incorporated as 5' caps on RNA by serving as non-canonical initiating nucleotides (NCINs) for transcription initiation by RNA polymerase (RNAP). Here, we report CapZyme-seq, a high-throughput-sequencing method that employs NCIN-decapping enzymes NudC and Rai1 to detect and quantify NCIN-capped RNA. By combining CapZyme-seq with multiplexed transcriptomics, we determine efficiencies of NAD+ capping by Escherichia coli RNAP for ∼16,000 promoter sequences. The results define preferred transcription start site (TSS) positions for NAD+ capping and define a consensus promoter sequence for NAD+ capping: HRRASWW (TSS underlined). By applying CapZyme-seq to E. coli total cellular RNA, we establish that sequence determinants for NCIN capping in vivo match the NAD+-capping consensus defined in vitro, and we identify and quantify NCIN-capped small RNAs (sRNAs). Our findings define the promoter-sequence determinants for NCIN capping with NAD+ and provide a general method for analysis of NCIN capping in vitro and in vivo.
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in urogenital system with an incidence accounting for about 3% of the whole body malignant tumor. NudC domain containing 1 (NudCD1), a new member of NudC family distributed in nucleus, is found to be upregulated in multiple tumors. However, its expression and role in RCC tissue has not been elucidated. NudCD1 expression in RCC tissue was measured by western blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC). NudCD1 level was elevated by overexpression vector to investigate its regulatory role on LIS1/Dynein signaling pathway. Cell morphology, intracellular localization, and cell division were observed by immunofluorescence together with delayed microscope photograph. The impact of NudCD1 overexpression on cell migration was assessed by Transwell assay. NudCD1 expression was significantly increased in RCC tissue compared with that in adjacent normal control. NudCD1/LIS1/Dynein signaling pathway was obviously upregulated in RCC tissue. Overexpression of NudCD1 level in A498 cell line markedly elevated NudCD1/LIS1/Dynein signaling pathway, suggesting they might be involved in RCC process. NudCD1 upregulation also caused abnormal microtubule fasciculus structure with multinuclear morphology, and promoted cell migration. NudCD1 expression was obviously increased in RCC and affected RCC cell division and migration possibly through activating NudCD1/LIS1/Dynein signaling pathway, indicating therapeutic targeting NudCD1 might be a new approach to inhibit RCC cell migration.
Protein folding and degradation are both required for protein quality control, an essential cellular activity that underlies normal growth and development. We investigated how BOB1, an Arabidopsis thaliana small heat shock protein, maintains normal plant development. bob1 mutants exhibit organ polarity defects and have expanded domains of KNOX gene expression. Some of these phenotypes are ecotype specific suggesting that other genes function to modify them. Using a genetic approach we identified an interaction between BOB1 and FIL, a gene required for abaxial organ identity. We also performed an EMS enhancer screen using the bob1-3 allele to identify pathways that are sensitized by a loss of BOB1 function. This screen identified genetic, but not physical, interactions between BOB1 and the proteasome subunit RPT2a Two other proteasome subunits, RPN1a and RPN8a, also interact genetically with BOB1 Both BOB1 and the BOB1-interacting proteasome subunits had previously been shown to interact genetically with the transcriptional enhancers AS1 and AS2, genes known to regulate both organ polarity and KNOX gene expression. Our results suggest a model in which BOB1 mediated protein folding and proteasome mediated protein degradation form a functional proteostasis module required for ensuring normal plant development.
RNA modifications are widely distributed in Nature, and their thorough analysis helps answering fundamental biological questions. Nowadays, mass spectrometry or deep-sequencing methods are often used for the analysis. With the raising number of newly discovered RNA modifications, such as the 5'-NAD cap in Escherichia coli, there is an important need for new, less complex and fast analytical tools to analyze the occurrence, amount, and distribution of modified RNAs in cells. To accomplish this task, we have revisited the previously developed affinity gel electrophoresis principles and copolymerized acryloylaminophenyl boronic acid (APB) in standard denaturing polyacrylamide gels to retard the NAD- or FAD-modified RNAs compared to the unmodified RNAs in the gels. The boronyl groups inside the gel form relatively stable complexes with 1,2-cis diols, occurring naturally at the 3'-end of RNA, and also in the nicotinamide riboside of NAD-modified RNA at the 5'-end. The transient formation of diesters between the immobilized boronic acid and the diols causes lower mobility of the modified RNAs, compared to unmodified RNAs, resulting in two distinct bands for one RNA sequence. We used APB affinity gel electrophoresis to preparatively purify in vitro transcribed NAD-RNA from triphosphorylated RNA, to study the enzyme kinetics of the NAD-RNA decapping enzyme NudC, and to determine the NAD modification ratios of various cellular sRNAs. In summary, APB affinity gels can be used to study cofactor-modified RNAs with low amounts of material, and to rapidly screen for their occurrence in total RNA while avoiding complex sample treatments.
RNA capping and decapping are thought to be distinctive features of eukaryotes. The redox cofactor NAD was recently discovered to be attached to small regulatory RNAs in bacteria in a cap-like manner, and Nudix hydrolase NudC was found to act as a NAD-decapping enzyme in vitro and in vivo. Here, crystal structures of Escherichia coli NudC in complex with substrate NAD and with cleavage product NMN reveal the catalytic residues lining the binding pocket and principles underlying molecular recognition of substrate and product. Biochemical mutation analysis identifies the conserved Nudix motif as the catalytic center of the enzyme, which needs to be homodimeric, as the catalytic pocket is composed of amino acids from both monomers. NudC is single-strand specific and has a purine preference for the 5'-terminal nucleotide. The enzyme strongly prefers NAD-linked RNA (NAD-RNA) over NAD and binds to a diverse set of cellular RNAs in an unspecific manner.
The development of new drugs is required to control human tuberculosis (TB). This study examined whether drug hypersensitive mutants could be used to reveal novel aspects of the mechanism of action of a TB drug. A transposon mutant collection with an estimated 1.1-fold genome coverage (7680 mutants) was constructed in Mycobacterium smegmatis and screened in high-throughput against isoniazid. Hypersensitive transposants with mutations in genes known to influence the mode of action of isoniazid were isolated. To further investigate the role of one of these genes, nudC, the corresponding mutant was tested for sensitivity towards isoniazid structural analogues. Overexpression of nudC, as well as inhA which encodes a known target of isoniazid, increased M. smegmatis resistance to isoniazid, but failed to increase resistance to three of the analogues, NSC27607, NSC33759, and NSC40350. In contrast, overexpression of katG resulted in increased sensitivity to each of the isoniazid analogues tested including NSC27607, NSC33759, and NSC40350. This provides evidence that the latter isoniazid analogues are activated by KatG in a NudC-independent manner and that InhA may not be their primary target. In summary, characterisation of drug hypersensitive mutants detected genes involved in the mode of action of isoniazid. Furthermore, it identified isoniazid analogues which are resilient to both InhA- and NudC-dependent mechanisms of resistance. 
Although widely assumed to bear a 5'-terminal triphosphate or monophosphate, recent evidence suggests that the 5' end of bacterial RNA can sometimes bear a modification reminiscent of a eukaryotic cap. A new study has now identified Escherichia coli RNAs that begin with a noncanonical cap resembling the redox cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), as well as a cellular enzyme that can remove it. The biological function of such caps remains to be determined. 
A distinctive feature of prokaryotic gene expression is the absence of 5'-capped RNA. In eukaryotes, 5',5'-triphosphate-linked 7-methylguanosine protects messenger RNA from degradation and modulates maturation, localization and translation. Recently, the cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) was reported as a covalent modification of bacterial RNA. Given the central role of NAD in redox biochemistry, posttranslational protein modification and signalling, its attachment to RNA indicates that there are unknown functions of RNA in these processes and undiscovered pathways in RNA metabolism and regulation. The unknown identity of NAD-modified RNAs has so far precluded functional analyses. Here we identify NAD-linked RNAs from bacteria by chemo-enzymatic capture and next-generation sequencing (NAD captureSeq). Among those identified, specific regulatory small RNAs (sRNAs) and sRNA-like 5'-terminal fragments of certain mRNAs are particularly abundant. Analogous to a eukaryotic cap, 5'-NAD modification is shown in vitro to stabilize RNA against 5'-processing by the RNA-pyrophosphohydrolase RppH and against endonucleolytic cleavage by ribonuclease (RNase) E. The nudix phosphohydrolase NudC decaps NAD-RNA and thereby triggers RNase-E-mediated RNA decay, while being inactive against triphosphate-RNA. In vivo, ∼13% of the abundant sRNA RNAI is NAD-capped in the presence, and ∼26% in the absence, of functional NudC. To our knowledge, this is the first description of a cap-like structure and a decapping machinery in bacteria. 
Chaperones are abundant cellular proteins that promote the folding and function of their substrate proteins (clients). In vivo, chaperones also associate with a large and diverse set of cofactors (cochaperones) that regulate their specificity and function. However, how these cochaperones regulate protein folding and whether they have chaperone-independent biological functions is largely unknown. We combined mass spectrometry and quantitative high-throughput LUMIER assays to systematically characterize the chaperone-cochaperone-client interaction network in human cells. We uncover hundreds of chaperone clients, delineate their participation in specific cochaperone complexes, and establish a surprisingly distinct network of protein-protein interactions for cochaperones. As a salient example of the power of such analysis, we establish that NUDC family cochaperones specifically associate with structurally related but evolutionarily distinct β-propeller folds. We provide a framework for deciphering the proteostasis network and its regulation in development and disease and expand the use of chaperones as sensors for drug-target engagement.
Like other organs, the C. elegans gonad develops from a simple primordium that must undergo axial patterning to generate correct adult morphology. Proximal/distal (PD) polarity in the C. elegans gonad is established early during gonadogenesis by the somatic gonad precursor cells, Z1 and Z4. Z1 and Z4 each divide asymmetrically to generate one daughter with a proximal fate and one with a distal fate. PD polarity of the Z1/Z4 lineages requires the activity of a Wnt pathway that activates the TCF/LEF homolog pop-1. How the gonadal pathway controlling pop-1 is regulated by upstream factors has been unclear, as neither Wnt nor Dishevelled (Dsh) proteins have been shown to be required. Here we show that the C. elegansdsh homolog dsh-2 controls gonadal polarity. As in pop-1 mutants, dsh-2 hermaphrodites have Z1 and Z4 lineage defects indicative of defective PD polarity and are missing gonadal arms. Males have an elongated but disorganized gonad, also with lineage defects. DSH-2 protein is expressed in the Z1/Z4 gonadal precursor cells. Asymmetric distribution of nuclear GFP::POP-1 in Z1 and Z4 daughter cells is reversed in dsh-2 mutants, with higher levels in distal than proximal daughters. dsh-2 and the frizzled receptor homolog lin-17 have a strong genetic interaction, suggesting that they act in a common pathway. We suggest that DSH-2 functions as an upstream regulator of POP-1 in the somatic gonad to control asymmetric cell division, thereby establishing proximal-distal polarity of the developing organ.
In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a canonical Wnt signaling pathway controls a cell migration whereas noncanonical Wnt pathways control the polarities of individual cells. Despite the differences in the identities and interactions among canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathway components, as well as the processes they regulate, almost all C. elegans Wnt pathways involve the sole Tcf homolog, POP-1. Intriguingly, POP-1 is asymmetrically distributed between the daughters of an asymmetric cell division, with the anterior sister cell usually having a higher level of nuclear POP-1 than its posterior sister. At some divisions, asymmetric distribution of POP-1 is controlled by noncanonical Wnt signaling, but at others the asymmetry is generated independently. Recent experiments suggest that despite this elaborate anterior-posterior POP-1 asymmetry, the quantity of POP-1 protein may have less to do with the subsequent determination of fate than does the quality of the POP-1 protein in the cell. In this review, we will embark on a quest to understand Quality (1), at least from the standpoint of the effect POP/Tcf quality has on the control of cell polarity in C. elegans.
Lymphoid enhancer factor/T-cell factor (LEF/TCF) are transcription factors that mediate the Wnt signaling pathway, and have crucial roles during embryonic development in various organisms. Here we report that acetylation enhances nuclear retention of POP-1, the Caenorhabditis elegans LEF/TCF homolog, through increasing nuclear import and blocking nuclear export. We identify three lysines that are acetylated in vivo, and demonstrate their essential requirement for proper nuclear localization and biological activity of POP-1 during C. elegans embryogenesis. The conservation of these lysines among other LEF/TCF family members suggests that acetylation may be an important, evolutionarily conserved mechanism regulating subcellular distribution of LEF/TCF factors.
Recently, we reported the cloning of the Drosophila melanogaster homolog of the vertebrate CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP). Here, we describe studies of the DNA-binding and dimerization properties of Drosophila C/EBP (DmC/EBP), as well as its tissue distribution, developmental regulation, and essential role in embryonic development and conclude that it bears functional as well as structural similarity to mammalian C/EBP. DmC/EBP contains a basic region/leucine zipper (bZIP) DNA-binding domain very similar to that of mammalian C/EBP and the purified C/EBPs bound to DNA with the same sequence specificity. Among the DNA sequences that DmC/EBP bound with high affinity was a conserved site within the promoter of the DmC/EBP gene itself. In vitro, DmC/EBP and mammalian C/EBP specifically formed functional heterodimers; however, as we found no evidence for a family of DmC/EBPs, DmC/EBP may function as a homodimer in vivo. The DmC/EBP protein was expressed predominantly during late embryogenesis in the nuclei of a restricted set of differentiating cell types, such as the lining of the gut and epidermis, similar to the mammalian tissues that express C/EBP. We have characterized mutations in the DmC/EBP gene and found that deleting the gene caused late embryonic lethality. Embryos that lack C/EBP die just before or just upon hatching. The lethal phenotype of C/EBP mutants can be rescued with the cloned C/EBP gene introduced by P-element-mediated germ-line transformation. The strict requirement for C/EBP during Drosophila embryogenesis, coupled with its structural and functional similarities to mammalian C/EBP, provides a useful genetic system in which to study the role of C/EBP in development.
Expression of the avian very-low-density apolipoprotein II (apoVLDLII) gene is completely dependent on estrogen and restricted to the liver. We have identified binding sites for nonhistone nuclear proteins located between -1.96 and -2.61 kilobases. One of these sites, located at -2.6 kilobases (designated site 1), was found to span an MspI site that becomes demethylated between days 7 and 9 of embryogenesis, the stage of development at which competence to express the apoVLDLII gene begins to be acquired. Levels of the factor(s) involved were high at day 7 of embryogenesis, decreased two- to threefold by days 9 to 11, and continued to decline more slowly until hatching. Furthermore, the mobility of the complex formed underwent a well-defined shift between days 11 to 13 embryogenesis. Methylation interference studies showed that modification of the outer guanosines of the MspI site resulted in marked inhibition of the formation of the protein-DNA complex. Competition studies, fractionation of nuclear extracts, and tissue distribution indicated that the factor was not the avian homolog of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1, nuclear factor 1, or CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP). However, site 1 could complete for binding to an oligonucleotide, previously shown to be recognized by C/EBP, in a nonreciprocal fashion. These studies demonstrate that the sequence recognized by the protein includes a C/EBP consensus sequence but that elements in addition to the core enhancer motif are essential for binding.
dpy-27 is an essential dosage compensation gene that acts to reduce expression of both hermaphrodite X chromosomes. The DPY-27 protein becomes specifically localized to the X chromosomes of wild-type XX embryos, but remains diffusely distributed throughout the nuclei of male (XO) embryos. In xol-1 mutant XO embryos that activate the XX mode of dosage compensation and die from inappropriately low X chromosome transcript levels, DPY-27 becomes localized to X. Therefore, sex specificity of the dosage compensation process is regulated at the step of DPY-27 X chromosome localization. DPY-27 exhibits striking similarity to proteins required for assembly and structural maintenance of Xenopus chromosomes in vitro and for segregation of yeast chromosomes in vivo. These findings suggest a link between global regulation of gene expression and higher order chromosome structure. We propose that DPY-27 implements dosage compensation by condensing the chromatin structure of X in a manner that causes general reduction of X chromosome expression.
Much of our understanding of the function and regulation of the Cdc14 family of dual-specificity phosphatases originates from studies in yeasts. In these unicellular organisms Cdc14 is an important regulator of M-phase events. In contrast, the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog, cdc-14, is not necessary for mitosis, rather it is crucial for G(1)/S regulation to establish developmental cell-cycle quiescence. Despite the importance of integrating cdc-14 regulation with development, the mechanisms by which this coordination occurs are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that several processes conspire to focus the activity of cdc-14. First, the cdc-14 locus can produce at least six protein variants through alternative splicing. We find that a single form, CDC-14C, is the key variant acting during vulva development. Second, CDC-14C expression is limited to a subset of cells, including vulva precursors, through post-transcriptional regulation. Lastly, the CDC-14C subcellular location, and thus its potential interactions with other regulatory proteins, is regulated by nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. We find that the active export of CDC-14C from the nucleus during interphase is dependent on members of the Cyclin D and Crm1 families. We propose that these mechanisms collaborate to restrict the activity of cdc-14 as central components of an evolutionarily conserved regulatory network to coordinate cell-cycle progression with development.
Identifying transcription factor binding sites genome-wide using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-based technology is becoming an increasingly important tool in addressing developmental questions. However, technical problems associated with factor abundance and suitable ChIP reagents are common obstacles to these studies in many biological systems. We have used two completely different, widely applicable methods to determine by ChIP the genome-wide binding sites of the master myogenic regulatory transcription factor HLH-1 (CeMyoD) in C. elegans embryos. The two approaches, ChIP-seq and ChIP-chip, yield strongly overlapping results revealing that HLH-1 preferentially binds to promoter regions of genes enriched for E-box sequences (CANNTG), known binding sites for this well-studied class of transcription factors. HLH-1 binding sites were enriched upstream of genes known to be expressed in muscle, consistent with its role as a direct transcriptional regulator. HLH-1 binding was also detected at numerous sites unassociated with muscle gene expression, as has been previously described for its mouse homolog MyoD. These binding sites may reflect several additional functions for HLH-1, including its interactions with one or more co-factors to activate (or repress) gene expression or a role in chromatin organization distinct from direct transcriptional regulation of target genes. Our results also provide a comparison of ChIP methodologies that can overcome limitations commonly encountered in these types of studies while highlighting the complications of assigning in vivo functions to identified target sites.
Development requires fertilization by a single sperm. In Caenorhabditis elegans, fertilization occurs in a sperm-filled spermatheca, implying the barrier to polyspermy is generated in this compartment. Eggshell chitin synthesis is initiated at fertilization, and chitin is deposited before the zygote exits the spermatheca. Whereas polyspermy is very rare in wild-type, here we report an incidence of 14%-51% in zygotes made chitin deficient by loss of chitin synthase-1 (CHS-1), the CHS-1 substrate UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, the CHS-1-interacting protein EGG-3, or the sperm-provided protein SPE-11. The spe-11(hc90) mutant deposits chitin at the male end but fails to complete a continuous layer. The polyspermy barrier is also compromised by loss of the chitin-binding protein CBD-1 or the GLD-1-regulated LDL receptor-like EGG-1, together with its homolog, EGG-2. Loss of CBD-1 or EGG-1/2 disrupts oocyte cortical distribution of CHS-1, as well as MBK-2 and EGG-3. In CBD-1 or EGG-1/2 deficiency, chitin is synthesized but the eggshell is fractured, suggesting aberrantly clustered CHS-1/MBK-2/EGG-3 may fail to support construction of a continuous eggshell. Together, our results show that eggshell chitin is required to prevent polyspermy in C. elegans, in addition to its previously reported requirement in polar body extrusion and polarization of the zygote.
NDG-4 is a predicted transmembrane acyltransferase protein that acts in the distribution of lipophilic factors. Consequently, ndg-4 mutants lay eggs with a pale appearance due to lack of yolk, and they are resistant to sterility caused by dietary supplementation with the long-chain omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid dihommogamma-linolenic acid (DGLA). Two other proteins, NRF-5 and NRF-6, a homolog of a mammalian secreted lipid binding protein and a NDG-4 homolog, respectively, have previously been shown to function in the same lipid transport pathway. Here, we report that mutation of the NDG-4 protein results in increased organismal stress resistance and lifespan. When NDG-4 function and insulin/IGF-1 signaling are reduced simultaneously, maximum lifespan is increased almost fivefold. Thus, longevity conferred by mutation of ndg-4 is partially overlapping with insulin signaling. The nuclear hormone receptor NHR-80 (HNF4 homolog) is required for longevity in germline less animals. We find that NHR-80 is also required for longevity of ndg-4 mutants. Moreover, we find that nrf-5 and nrf-6 mutants also have extended lifespan and increased stress resistance, suggesting that altered lipid transport and metabolism play key roles in determining lifespan. 
The glucose-responsive transcription factor carbohydrate responsive element binding protein (ChREBP) plays an important role in regulating glucose metabolism in support of anabolic synthesis in both hepatocytes and cancer cells. In order to further investigate the molecular mechanism by which ChREBP regulates transcription, we used a proteomic approach to identify proteins interacting with ChREBP. We found several potential ChREBP-interacting partners, one of which, flightless I homolog (FLII) was verified to interact and co-localize with ChREBP in HCT116 colorectal cancer and HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. FLII is a member of the gelsolin superfamily of actin-remodeling proteins and can function as a transcriptional co-regulator. The C-terminal 227 amino acid region of ChREBP containing the DNA-binding domain interacted with FLII. Both the N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain and C-terminal gelsolin homolog domain (GLD) of FLII interacted and co-localized with ChREBP. ChREBP and FLII localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of cancer cells. Glucose increased expression and nuclear localization of ChREBP, and had minimal effect on the level and distribution of FLII. FLII knockdown using siRNAs increased mRNA and protein levels of ChREBP-activated genes and decreased transcription of ChREBP-repressed genes in cancer cells. Conversely, FLII overexpression negatively regulated ChREBP-mediated transcription in cancer cells. Our findings suggest that FLII is a component of the ChREBP transcriptional complex and negatively regulates ChREBP function in cancer cells. 
The cAMP response element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB) is a key regulatory factor of gene transcription, and plays an essential role in development of the central nervous system and for neuroprotection. Multiple signaling pathways have been shown to contribute to the regulation of CREB-dependent transcription, including both ERK and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases cascades. Recent studies have identified the Ras-related small G-protein, Rit, as a central regulator of a p38-MK2-HSP27 signaling cascade that functions as a critical survival mechanism for cells adapting to stress. Here, we examine the contribution of Rit-p38 signaling to the control of stress-dependent gene transcription. Using a pheochromocytoma cell model, we find that a novel Rit-p38-MSK1/2 pathway plays a critical role in stress-mediated CREB activation. RNAi-mediated Rit silencing, or inhibition of p38 or MSK1/2 kinases, was found to disrupt stress-mediated CREB-dependent transcription, resulting in increased cell death. Furthermore, ectopic expression of active Rit stimulates CREB-Ser133 phosphorylation, induces expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl(XL) proteins, and promotes cell survival. These data indicate that the Rit-p38-MSK1/2 signaling pathway may have an important role in the stress-dependent regulation of CREB-dependent gene expression.
The molecular mechanisms governing the spontaneous recovery seen following brain injury remain elusive, but recent studies indicate that injury-induced stimulation of hippocampal neurogenesis contributes to the repair process. The therapeutic potential of endogenous neurogenesis is tempered by the demonstration that traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in the selective death of adult-born immature neurons, compromising the cell population poised to compensate for trauma-induced neuronal loss. Here, we identify the Ras-related GTPase, Rit, as a critical player in the survival of immature hippocampal neurons following brain injury. While Rit knock-out (Rit(-/-)) did not alter hippocampal development, hippocampal neural cultures derived from Rit(-/-) mice display increased cell death and blunted MAPK cascade activation in response to oxidative stress, without affecting BDNF-dependent signaling. When compared with wild-type hippocampal cultures, Rit loss rendered immature (Dcx(+)) neurons susceptible to oxidative damage, without altering the survival of neural progenitor (Nestin(+)) cells. Oxidative stress is a major contributor to neuronal cell death following brain injury. Consistent with the enhanced vulnerability of cultured Rit(-/-) immature neurons, Rit(-/-) mice exhibited a significantly greater loss of adult-born immature neurons within the dentate gyrus after TBI. In addition, post-TBI neuronal remodeling was blunted. Together, these data identify a new and unexpected role for Rit in injury-induced neurogenesis, functioning as a selective survival mechanism for immature hippocampal neurons within the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus following TBI.
Ras-related small GTP-binding proteins control a wide range of cellular processes by regulating a variety of effector pathways, including prominent roles in the control of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. Although the regulatory role(s) for many Ras family GTPases are well established, the physiological function for the Rit/Rin subfamily has been lacking. Here, using both knockout mice and Drosophila models, we demonstrate an evolutionarily conserved role for Rit subfamily GTPases (mammalian Rit and Rin, and the Drosophila RIC homologue) in governing survival in response to oxidative stress. Primary embryonic fibroblasts derived from Rit knockout mice display increased apoptosis and selective disruption of MAPK signaling following reactive oxygen species (ROS) exposure but not in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress or DNA damage. These deficits include a reduction in ROS-mediated stimulation of a p38-MK2-HSP27 signaling cascade that controls Akt activation, directing Bad phosphorylation to promote cell survival. Furthermore, D-RIC null flies display increased susceptibility to environmental stresses and reduced stress-dependent p38 signaling, extending the Rit-p38 survival pathway to Drosophila. Together, our studies establish the Rit GTPases as critical regulators of an evolutionarily conserved, p38 MAPK-dependent signaling cascade that functions as an important survival mechanism for cells in response to oxidative stress.
Cells mobilize diverse signaling cascades to protect against stress-mediated injury. Ras family GTPases play a pivotal role in cell fate determination, serving as molecular switches to control the integration of multiple signaling pathways. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling serves as a critical fulcrum in this process, regulating networks that stimulate cellular apoptosis but also have the capacity to promote cell survival. However, relatively little is known concerning this functional dichotomy, particularly the regulation of p38-dependent survival pathways. Here, we demonstrate that the Rit GTPase promotes cell survival by directing an unexpected p38 MAPK-dependent AKT survival pathway. Following stress exposure, Rit small hairpin RNA interference (shRNAi)-treated cells display increased apoptosis and selective disruption of p38 MAPK signaling, while expression of constitutively activated Rit promotes p38-AKT-dependent cell survival. Rit, but not Ras or Rap GTPases, can associate with, and is critical for, stress-mediated activation of the scaffolded p38-MK2-HSP27-AKT prosurvival signaling complex. Together, our studies establish Rit as a central regulator of a p38 MAPK-dependent signaling cascade that functions as a critical cellular survival mechanism in response to stress.
Heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein transduce signals initiated by a variety of hormones and neurotransmitters. Go, a member of the Go/Gi family, is the most abundant heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein in nervous tissues and has been implicated in neuronal differentiation. The mechanism by which Go modulates neuronal differentiation has not been, however, fully elucidated. Here, we identified small GTPase Rit as an interacting partner of the alpha-subunit of Go (Goalpha). The biochemical characterizations of Goalpha::Rit interaction revealed that Rit is a candidate downstream effector for Goalpha. Furthermore, dominant negative Rit inhibited Goalpha-induced neurite outgrowth and Erk phosphorylation in Neuro2a cells. These results suggest that Rit may be involved in the signaling pathway for Goalpha-mediated neuronal differentiation.
The complete CDS sequences of three porcine genes: UCHL3, RIT1 and CCND3 were amplified using RT-PCR based on the sequence information of the mouse or other mammals and referenced highly homologous pig ESTs. Sequence analysis of these three genes revealed that the porcine UCHL3 gene encodes a protein of 230 amino acids and has high homology with the ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L3 (UCHL3) of four species-bovine (97%), human (96%), mouse (95%) and rat (94%). The porcine RIT1 gene encodes a protein of 219 amino acids and has high homology with the GTP-binding protein Rit1 (RIT1) of two species-human (97%), mouse (97%). The porcine CCND3 gene encodes a protein of 292 amino acids and has high homology with the G1/S-specific cyclin-D3 (CCND3) of four species-bovine (98%), human (97%), mouse (93%) and rat (92%). The phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that the swine UCHL3 has a closer genetic relationship with the UCHL3 of bovine, and the swine RIT1 has closer genetic relationships with the RIT1 of human, but the swine CCND3 has a closer genetic relationship with the CCND3 of bovine. The RT-PCR gene expression analysis indicated that the swine UCHL3, RIT1 and CCND3 genes were differentially expressed in tissues including small intestine, large intestine, liver, muscle, fat, lung, spleen and kidney. Our experiment established the primary foundation for further research on these three swine genes.
Ionizing radiation is a well-known carcinogen for various human tissues and a complete carcinogen that is able to initiate and promote neoplastic progression. Studies of radiation-induced mouse thymic lymphomas, one of the classic models in radiation carcinogenesis, demonstrated that even the unirradiated thymus is capable of developing into full malignancy when transplanted into the kidney capsule or subcutaneous tissue of irradiated mice. This suggests that radiation targets tissues other than thymocytes to allow expansion of cells with tumorigenic potential in the thymus. The idea is regarded as the 'indirect mechanism' for tumor development. This paper reviews the indirect mechanism and genes affecting the development of thymic lymphomas that we have analyzed. One is the Bcl11b/Rit1 tumor suppressor gene and the other is Mtf-1 gene affecting tumor susceptibility.
The novel small GTPases Rin and Rit are close relatives of Ras, and recent studies show that they play a role in mediating neuronal differentiation. However, the direct effectors of Rin and Rit have yet to be fully characterized. Here we showed that Rin and Rit directly bind to the PDZ domain of PAR6, a cell polarity-regulating protein, in a GTP-dependent manner both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, Rin and Rit can form a ternary complex consisting of PAR6 and Rac/Cdc42, members of the Rho family of small GTPases modulating cell growth and polarity. This ternary complex synergistically potentiates cell transformation in NIH3T3 cells, and the interaction between Rin/Rit and the PDZ domain of PAR6 is important for this effect. These results suggest that the Rin/Rit-PAR6-Rac/Cdc42 ternary complex may work physiologically in the cells, such as in tumorigenesis.
Within the vertebrate nervous system, the presence of many different lineages of neurons and glia complicates the molecular characterization of single neuronal populations. In order to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying the specification and development of corticospinal motor neurons (CSMN), we purified CSMN at distinct stages of development in vivo and compared their gene expression to two other pure populations of cortical projection neurons: callosal projection neurons and corticotectal projection neurons. We found genes that are potentially instructive for CSMN development, as well as genes that are excluded from CSMN and are restricted to other populations of neurons, even within the same cortical layer. Loss-of-function experiments in null mutant mice for Ctip2 (also known as Bcl11b), one of the newly characterized genes, demonstrate that it plays a critical role in the development of CSMN axonal projections to the spinal cord in vivo, confirming that we identified central genetic determinants of the CSMN population.
Rit is one of the original members of a novel Ras GTPase subfamily that uses distinct effector pathways to transform NIH 3T3 cells and induce pheochromocytoma cell (PC6) differentiation. In this study, we find that stimulation of PC6 cells by growth factors, including nerve growth factor (NGF), results in rapid and prolonged Rit activation. Ectopic expression of active Rit promotes PC6 neurite outgrowth that is morphologically distinct from that promoted by oncogenic Ras (evidenced by increased neurite branching) and stimulates activation of both the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathways. Furthermore, Rit-induced differentiation is dependent upon both MAP kinase cascades, since MEK inhibition blocked Rit-induced neurite outgrowth, while p38 blockade inhibited neurite elongation and branching but not neurite initiation. Surprisingly, while Rit was unable to stimulate ERK activity in NIH 3T3 cells, it potently activated ERK in PC6 cells. This cell type specificity is explained by the finding that Rit was unable to activate C-Raf, while it bound and stimulated the neuronal Raf isoform, B-Raf. Importantly, selective down-regulation of Rit gene expression in PC6 cells significantly altered NGF-dependent MAP kinase cascade responses, inhibiting both p38 and ERK kinase activation. Moreover, the ability of NGF to promote neuronal differentiation was attenuated by Rit knockdown. Thus, Rit is implicated in a novel pathway of neuronal development and regeneration by coupling specific trophic factor signals to sustained activation of the B-Raf/ERK and p38 MAP kinase cascades.
Most chromosomal translocations observed in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) often produce transcriptional activation of transcription factor oncogenes. Ectopic expression of the TLX3 (also known as HOX11L2) gene has been shown to be associated with a cryptic t(5;14)(q35;q32) translocation specific for a subtype of T-ALL. Here we report several examples of variant and alternative translocations resulting in expression of TLX3 in T-ALL, and we describe three of these translocations in detail. In particular, the CDK6 gene was rearranged in two t(5;7)(q35;q21) translocations. In two additional instances, fusion of the BCL11B (also known as CTIP2) and RANBP17/TLX3 loci were shown to result from subtle genomic insertion/deletion within these loci. This study further underscores that TLX3 expression in T-ALL is strongly associated with the presence of genomic rearrangements.
Cytogenetic studies in a patient with acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) revealed as the sole karyotypic alteration a half-cryptic rearrangement, identified with 48-color combined binary ratio-labeled fluorescence in situ hybridization (pq-COBRA-FISH) as a reciprocal t(6;14)(q?;q?). The breakpoints were later assigned on the basis of G-banding to t(6;14)(q25-q26;q32). FISH experiments using genomic probes showed that the breakpoint on 14q32.2 was within bacterial artificial chromosome RP11-782I5 and revealed BCL11B as the only candidate gene in the region. BCL11B is a homolog to BCL11A (2p13), a highly conserved gene implicated in mouse and human leukemias. To our knowledge, this is the first report implicating BCL11B in hematological malignancies. Because of lack of material, the translocation partner remains unknown.
To explore the mutation and amplification of RIT1 gene and their correlation with carcinogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
The polymerase chain reactioindirect sequencing method was used for detecting the mutations in the sequence of all 6 exons in the RIT1 gene of 50 HCC tissues and paratumor tissues. And the amplification of RIT1 gene was examined by fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction method.
A nucleotide 241 G --&gt; C substitution in exon 5 of RIT1 gene was detected in one patient's HCC tissue, but not in paratumor tissue; this 241 G --&gt; C substitution leads to Glu81Gln amino acid alteration in the conservative domain binding GTP. A nucleotide G --&gt; C substitution in 5'-UTR (-21 bp from initial codon) was detected in all of the 50 HCC tissues and paratumor tissues, and 2- to 297-fold amplification of RIT1 gene was detected in 11 of 43 qualified cases, the amplification frequency being 25.6%.
Gene amplification is one of the main activating ways of RIT1 gene in HCC, and its amplification might be correlated with HCC carcinogenesis, while point mutation might be not.
A novel branch of the Ras family, Rit, was recently identified. Rit exhibits a distinct C-terminus and effector domain, and does not activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) but can cooperate with Raf to transform fibroblasts. Here, we found that when overexpressed, activated mutants of Rit transform NIH 3T3 cells efficiently, and stimulate p38gamma but not MAPK, p38alpha, p38gamma, p38delta, or ERK5. Furthermore, we provide evidence that p38gamma activation is required for the ability of Rit to stimulate gene expression and cellular transformation. These findings suggest that this unique GTPase stimulates proliferative pathways distinct from those regulated by other Ras family members.
The biological functions of Rit (Ras-like protein in tissues) and Rin (Ras-like protein in neurons), members of a novel branch of Ras-related GTP-binding proteins that are approximately 50% identical to Ras, have not been characterized. Therefore, we assessed their activity in growth control, transformation and signaling. NIH cells stably expressing a constitutively activated mutant of Rit [Rit(79L)] (analogous to the oncogenic mutant H-Ras(61L)) demonstrated strong growth transformation, proliferating rapidly in low serum and forming colonies in soft agar and tumors in nude mice. Although Rit(79L) alone did not promote morphologically transformed foci, it cooperated with both Raf and Rho A to form Rac/Rho-like foci. Rin [Rin(78L)] cooperated only with Raf. Rit(79L) but not Rin(78L) stimulated transcription from luciferase reporter constructs regulated by SRF, NF-kappaB, Elk-1 and Jun. However, neither activated ERK, JNK or p38, or PI3-K/Akt kinases in immune complex kinase assays. Interestingly, although Rit lacks any known recognition signal for C-terminal lipidation, Rit-transformed cell growth and survival in low serum is dependent on a farnesylated protein, as treatment with farnesyltransferase inhibitors caused apoptosis. Rin cooperated with Raf in focus assays but did not otherwise function in these assays, perhaps due to a lack of appropriate effector pathways in NIH3T3 fibroblasts for this neural-specific Ras family member. In summary, although Rit shares most core effector domain residues with Ras, our results suggest that Rit uses novel effector pathways to regulate proliferation and transformation.
The small GTPase Rit is a close relative of Ras, and constitutively active Rit can induce oncogenic transformation. Although the effector loops of Rit and Ras are highly related, Rit fails to interact with the majority of the known Ras candidate effector proteins, suggesting that novel cellular targets may be responsible for Rit transforming activity. To gain insight into the cellular function of Rit, we searched for Rit-binding proteins by yeast two-hybrid screening. We identified the C-terminal Rit/Ras interaction domain of a protein we have designated RGL3 (Ral GEF-like 3) that shares 35% sequence identity with the known Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RalGEFs). RGL3, through a C-terminal 99-amino acid domain, interacted in a GTP- and effector loop-dependent manner with Rit and Ras. Importantly, RGL3 exhibited guanine nucleotide exchange activity toward the small GTPase Ral that was stimulated in vivo by the expression of either activated Rit or Ras. These data suggest that RGL3 functions as an exchange factor for Ral and may serve as a downstream effector for both Rit and Ras.
The Ras branch of the Ras superfamily consists of small GTPases most closely related to Ras and include the R-Ras, Rap, Ral, Rheb, Rin and Rit proteins. Although our understanding of Ras signaling and biology is now considerable, recent observations suggest that Ras function is more complex than previously believed. First, the three Ras proteins may not be functionally identical. Second, Ras function involves functional cross-talk with their close relatives.
We report the biochemical characterization of Rit and Rin, two members of the Ras superfamily identified by expression cloning. Recombinant Rit and Rin bind GTP and exhibit intrinsic GTPase activity. Conversion of Gln to Leu at position 79 (for Rit) or 78 (for Rin) (equivalent to position 61 in Ras) resulted in a complete loss of GTPase activity. Surprisingly, significant differences were found when the guanine nucleotide dissociation constants of Rit and Rin were compared with the majority of Ras-related GTPases. Both proteins display higher k(off) values for GTP than GDP in the presence of 10 mM Mg(2+). These GTP dissociation rates are 5- to 10-fold faster than most Ras-like GTPases. Despite these unique biochemical properties, our data support the notion that both Rit and Rin function as nucleotide-dependent molecular switches. To begin to address whether these proteins act as regulators of distinct signaling pathways, we examined their interaction with a series of known Ras-binding proteins by yeast two-hybrid analysis. Although Rit, Rin, and Ras have highly related effector domain sequences, Rit and Rin were found to interact with the known Ras binding proteins RalGDS, Rlf, and AF-6/Canoe but not with the Raf kinases, RIN1, or the p110 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. These interactions were GTP and effector domain dependent and suggest that RalGDS, Rlf, and AF-6 are Rit and Rin effectors. Their biochemical properties and interaction with a subset of known Ras effector proteins suggest that Rit and Rin may play important roles in the regulation of signaling pathways and cellular processes distinct from those controlled by Ras.
The Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene RIT1 encodes a phospho-ribosyl transferase that exclusively modifies the initiator tRNA (tRNAMet(i)) by the addition of a 2'-O-ribosyl phosphate group to Adenosine 64. As a result, tRNAMet(i) is prevented from participating in the elongation steps of protein synthesis. We previously showed that the modification is not essential for the function of tRNAMet(i) in the initiation of translation, since rit1 null strains are viable and show no obvious growth defects. Here, we demonstrate that yeast strains in which a rit1 null allele is combined with mutations in any of the genes for the three subunits of eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2), or with disruption alleles of two of the four initiator methionine tRNA (IMT) genes, show synergistic growth defects. A multicopy plasmid carrying an IMT gene can alleviate these defects. On the other hand, introduction of a high-copy-number plasmid carrying the TEF2 gene, which encodes the eukaryotic elongation factor 1alpha (eEF-1alpha), into rit1 null strains with two intact IMT genes had the opposite effect, indicating that increased levels of eEF-1alpha are deleterious to these strains, presumably due to sequestration of the unmodified met-tRNAMet(i) for elongation. Thus, under conditions in which the components of the ternary met-tRNAMet(i):GTP:eIF-2 complex become limiting or are functionally impaired, the presence of the 2'-O-ribosyl phosphate modification in tRNAMet(i) is important for the provision of adequate amounts of tRNAMet(i) for formation of this ternary complex.
cDNAs encoding two novel 25 kDa Ras-like proteins, Rit and Rin, were isolated from mouse retina using a degenerate PCR-based cloning strategy. Using the expressed sequence tag database, human orthologs were also obtained and sequenced. The protein sequences of Rit and Rin, which are 64% identical, are more similar to each other than to any known Ras protein. Their closest homologs in the databases are Mucor racemosus Ras2 and Ras3, to which they show approximately 48% identity. Rit and Rin both bind GTP in vitro. An unusual feature of their structure is that they lack a known recognition signal for C-terminal lipidation, a modification that is generally necessary for plasma membrane association among the Ras subfamily of proteins. Nonetheless, transiently expressed Rit and Rin are plasma membrane-localized. Both proteins contain a C-terminal cluster of basic amino acids, which could provide a mechanism for membrane association. Deletion analysis suggested that this region is important for Rit membrane binding but is not necessary for Rin. Rit, like most Ras-related proteins, is ubiquitously expressed. Rin, however, is unusual in that it is expressed only in neurons. In addition, Rin binds calmodulin through a C-terminal binding motif. These results suggest that Rit and Rin define a novel subfamily of Ras-related proteins, perhaps using a new mechanism of membrane association, and that Rin may be involved in calcium-mediated signaling within neurons.
Using a genetic screen in yeast aimed at identifying cellular factors involved in initiator and elongator methionine tRNA discrimination in the translational process, we have identified a mutation that abolish the requirement for elongator methionine tRNA. The gene affected, which we call the ribosylation of the initiator tRNA gene or RIT1, encodes a 2'-O-ribosyl phosphate transferase. This enzyme modifies exclusively the initiator tRNA in position 64 using 5'-phosphoribosyl-1'-pyrophosphate as the modification donor. As the initiator tRNA participates both in the initiation and elongation of translation in a rit1 strain, we conclude that the 2'-O-ribosyl phosphate modification discriminates the initiator tRNAs from the elongator tRNAs during protein synthesis. The modification enzyme was shown to recognize the stem-loop IV region that is unique in eukaryotic cytoplasmic initiator tRNAs.
Mouse thymic lymphomas induced by gamma-irradiation exhibited homozygous deletions of the Rit1/Bcl11b tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 12 at high frequencies. Internal deletions of one allele were frequently accompanied by loss of the other allele. In order to elucidate the mechanism of these internal deletions, the sites of breakage and rejoining were examined by PCR mapping and sequencing. The 5' site of the deletions clustered within an approximately 5 kb region of intron 1 and the 3' site was confined to a site in intron 3. These sites contained P and/or N nucleotides and cryptic sequences recognizable by the RAG1/2 recombinase in the vicinity. This suggests that the Rit1 intragenic deletions were generated by endogenous illegitimate V(D)J recombinase activity and such aberrant recombination was also detected by nested PCR of DNA from the thymus of unirradiated mice but not of RAG2-deficient mice. A rough estimate indicated that there reside as many as 10(3)-10(4) thymocytes having Rit1 deletions, assuming the presence of 10(8) thymocytes in the thymus of unirradiated mice. Moreover, the recombination frequency was not affected by gamma-irradiation. These results show no effect of radiation on Rit1 mutations and suggest an indirect mechanism for its role in lymphomagenesis.
Chromatin state of a 2-Mb region harboring Rit1/Bcl11b on mouse chromosome 12 was examined using two distinct methods. One is ChIP assay examining the degree of enrichment with histone H3 methylated at lysine 9 (H3-mLys9) in chromatin and the other is H/E (heterochromatin/euchromatin) assay that measures a chromatin condensation state by using centrifugation. The ChIP assay showed that a 50-kb interval covering the gene and an upstream region constituted chromatin enriched with unmethylated H3-mLys9 in cells expressing Rit1 compared to cells not expressing Rit1. In contrast, regions other than the 50-kb interval did not show much difference in the enrichment between the two different types of cells. On the other hand, H/E assay of two expressing and two non-expressing tissues provided compatible fractionation patterns, suggesting that the chromatin condensation state detected by H/E assay is correlated with the chromatin state controlled by histone H3 tail modification linked to gene expression. These results indicate that the centrifugation-based H/E assay should provide a new approach to the regulation of chromatin structure with respect to its condensation state, complementing ChIP assays.
Previous study has demonstrated that high frequent gain of 1q was detected in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 1q21-22 was identified as the minimum overlapping amplified region and might contain the candidate oncogenes involved in HCC. RIT1 gene is located in 1q21.3 region and is a member of Ras subfamily. RIT1 protein is similar to Ras protein in molecular structure and functions. It was speculated that RIT1 gene might be a candidate oncogene in HCC. So, the amplification of RIT1 gene was examined in HCC and was linked with the clinical indicators in this study to explore the possible functions of RIT1 gene in HCC development and progression.
The fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction(FQ-PCR) method was established successfully. The number of RIT1 gene DNA copies was examined in the tumor tissues and its paratumor tissues from 43 patients with HCC by PE ABI 7000 Sequence Detector. The ratio of the number of RIT1 gene DNA copies between the tumor tissue and its paratumor tissue represented the extent of amplification of RIT1 gene DNA.
RIT1 gene DNA was amplified in 11 cases (25.6%)among 43 patients. The mean survival time (15 months) of the RIT1 gene-amplification group is significantly shorter than that (34 months) of the non-amplification group (P = 0.0009); furthermore, the pathological grade and the extent of liver cirrhosis were significantly different between the RIT1 gene-amplification group and the non-amplification group (P&lt; 0.01).
The amplification of RIT1 gene might be one of the activation ways in HCC and might play an important role in HCC development and progression.
The gene Bcl11b, which encodes zinc finger proteins, and its paralog, Bcl11a, are associated with immune-system malignancies. We have generated Bcl11b-deficient mice that show a block at the CD4-CD8- double-negative stage of thymocyte development without any impairment in cells of B- or gammadelta T cell lineages. The Bcl11b-/- thymocytes showed unsuccessful recombination of V(beta) to D(beta) and lacked the pre-T cell receptor (TCR) complex on the cell surface, owing to the absence of Tcrb mRNA expression. In addition, we saw profound apoptosis in the thymus of neonatal Bcl11b-/- mice. These results suggest that Bcl11b is a key regulator of both differentiation and survival during thymocyte development.
Rit, by sequence homology, is a member of the Ras subfamily of small guanine triphosphatases (GTPases). In PC6 cells, Rit signals through pathways both common to and different from those activated by Ras to promote cell survival and neurite outgrowth. However, the specific morphological changes induced by Rit in human cells are not known. Here, we show in a human neuronal model that Rit increases neurite outgrowth and branching through MEK-dependent and MEK-independent signaling mechanisms, respectively. Adenoviral expression of wild-type or constitutively active Rit increased neurite initiation, elongation and branching on endogenous matrix or a purified laminin-1 substratum of SH-SY5Y cells as assessed using image analysis. This outgrowth was morphologically distinct from that promoted by constitutively active Ras or Raf (evidenced by increased branching and elongation). Constitutively active Rit increased phosphorylation of ERK 1/2, but not Akt, and the MEK inhibitor PD 098059 blocked constitutively active Rit-induced neurite initiation but not elongation or branching. These results suggest that Rit plays a key role in human neuronal development and regeneration through activating both known and as yet undefined signaling pathways.
Allelic loss (LOH) mapping and sequence analysis were conducted for gamma-ray induced mouse thymic lymphomas and a novel tumor suppressor gene, Rit1/Bcl11b, on chromosome 12 was isolated. Bi-allelic changes were found in 17 of the 66 p53-proficient lymphomas with Rit1 LOH but in only 2 of the 54 p53-deficient lymphomas. This suggests an association between the presence of functional p53 and inactivation of the Rit1 gene in the lymphoma development. Introduction of Rit1 into HeLa cells lacking Rit1 expression suppressed cell growth. These results indicate that loss-of-function mutations of Rit1 contribute to mouse lymphomagenesis and possibly to human cancer development.
RIT1, (Ras-like without CAAX1), the founding member of a novel branch of the Ras subfamily, mediates a wide variety of cellular functions, including cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation, and it may play crucial oncogenic role in human cancer. The purpose of the current study was to characterize the expression pattern of RIT1 and assess the clinical significance of RIT1 expression in endometrial cancer patients. The mRNA and protein expression of RIT1 was significantly overexpressed in 7 endometrial cancer cell lines by qPCR and Western blot, respectively. In addition, RIT1 mRNA expression was elevated in 36 freshly frozen endometrial cancer tissues compared to 21 non-cancerous endometrial tissue samples. Similar results were observed by analyzing GEO datasets. Immunohistochemistry was used to examine the protein expression of RIT1 in two tissue microarrays containing 257 cases of tumor and 31 non-tumor tissues, which showed that elevated expression of RIT1 was significantly correlated with pathological type, clinical stage, grade and vascular invasion. Importantly, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that RIT1 expression was associated with overall survival of endometrial cancer patients. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that RIT1 expression was one of the independent prognostic factors for endometrial cancer patients. Furthermore, RIT1 combined with other clinicopathological risk factors was a more significant model in ROC curve comparison. In conclusion, elevated expression of RIT1 may contribute to the progression of endometrial cancer and thus may serve as a novel prognostic marker and a promising molecular target for the treatment of endometrial cancer. 
We performed the genetic analysis of Rasopathy syndromes in patients from Central European by direct sequencing followed by next generation sequencing of genes associated with Rasopathies. All 51 patients harboured the typical features of Rasopathy syndromes. Thirty-five mutations were identified in the examined patients (22 in PTPN11, two in SOS1, one in RIT1, one in SHOC2, two in HRAS, three in BRAF, two in MAP2K1 and two in the NF1 gene). Two of them (p.Gly392Glu in the BRAF gene and p.Gln164Lys in the MAP2K1 gene) were novel with a potentially pathogenic effect on the structure of these proteins. Statistically significant differences in the presence of pulmonary stenosis (63.64% vs. 23.81%, P = 0.013897) and cryptorchidism (76.47% vs. 30%, P = 0.040224) were identified as the result of comparison of the prevalence of phenotypic features in patients with the phenotype of Noonan syndrome and mutation in the PTPN11 gene, with the prevalence of the same features in patients without PTPN11 mutation. Cryptorchidism as a statistically significant feature in our patients with PTPN11 mutation was not reported as significant in other European countries (Germany, Italy and Greece). The majority of mutations were clustered in exons 3 (45.45%), 8 (22.73%), and 13 (22.73%) of the PTPN11 gene. 
Noonan syndrome (NS) is a genetic condition presenting with typical facies, cardiac defects, short stature, variable developmental deficit, cryptorchidism, skeletal, and other abnormalities. Germline mutations in genes involved in the RAS/MAPK signaling have been discovered to underlie NS. Recently, missense mutations in RIT1 have been reported as causative for individuals with clinical signs of NS. We report on a 2.5-year-old boy with NS phenotype with a novel heterozygous change in the RIT1 gene. The patient was born prematurely from pregnancy monitored for polyhydramnios. At 7 months of age, non-immune neutropenia and splenomegaly have been observed. During the severe pneumonia at 10 months, significant progression of hepatosplenomegaly, leukopenia with monocytosis (15-29 %), and thrombocytopenia occurred. Bone marrow evaluation showed myeloid hyperplasia and monocytosis, suggestive of myeloproliferative syndrome. Clinical phenotype (facial dysmorphism, soft hair, short neck, broad chest, widely spaced nipples, mild pectus carinatum, deep palmar creases, unilateral cryptorchidism), and moderate pulmonary valve stenosis with mild psychomotor delay were indicative of NS. DNA analysis identified a de novo heterozygous variant c.69A &gt;T, p.(Lys23Asn) in exon 2 of the RIT1 gene, presumed to be causative.
We present a patient with a clinical suspicion of NS carrying a novel substitution in RIT1 and hematologic findings not being observed in RIT1 positive patients to date. Thus, the case broadens variability of hematologic symptoms in RIT1 positive NS individuals.
• Noonan syndrome is a common genetically heterogeneous disorder of autosomal dominant inheritance characterized by craniofacial dysmorphism, short stature, congenital heart defects, variable cognitive deficit, and other anomalies. What is new: • We report on a 2.5-year-old male patient with clinical signs of NS and hematologic abnormalities, in whom a novel heterozygous substitution in RIT1 with probable pathogenicity was detected.
RASopathies or RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) syndromes are a group of phenotypically overlapping syndromes caused by germline mutations that encode components of the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway. These disorders include neurofibromatosis type I, Legius syndrome, Noonan syndrome, Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (formerly called LEOPARD syndrome), Costello syndrome, cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) syndrome, Noonan-like syndrome, hereditary gingival fibromatosis and capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation. Recently, novel gene variants, including RIT1, RRAS, RASA2, A2ML1, SOS2 and LZTR1, have been shown to be associated with RASopathies, further expanding the disease entity. Although further analysis will be needed, these findings will help to better elucidate an understanding of the pathogenesis of these disorders and will aid in the development of potential therapeutic approaches. In this review, we summarize the novel genes that have been reported to be associated with RASopathies and highlight the cardiovascular abnormalities that may arise in affected individuals. 
RASopathies are a clinically heterogeneous group of conditions caused by mutations in 1 of 16 proteins in the RAS-mitogen activated protein kinase (RAS-MAPK) pathway. Recently, mutations in RIT1 were identified as a novel cause for Noonan syndrome. Here we provide additional functional evidence for a causal role of RIT1 mutations and expand the associated phenotypic spectrum. We identified two de novo missense variants p.Met90Ile and p.Ala57Gly. Both variants resulted in increased MEK-ERK signaling compared to wild-type, underscoring gain-of-function as the primary functional mechanism. Introduction of p.Met90Ile and p.Ala57Gly into zebrafish embryos reproduced not only aspects of the human phenotype but also revealed abnormalities of eye development, emphasizing the importance of RIT1 for spatial and temporal organization of the growing organism. In addition, we observed severe lymphedema of the lower extremity and genitalia in one patient. We provide additional evidence for a causal relationship between pathogenic mutations in RIT1, increased RAS-MAPK/MEK-ERK signaling and the clinical phenotype. The mutant RIT1 protein may possess reduced GTPase activity or a diminished ability to interact with cellular GTPase activating proteins; however the precise mechanism remains unknown. The phenotypic spectrum is likely to expand and includes lymphedema of the lower extremities in addition to nuchal hygroma. 
Rit, a member of the Ras family of GTPases, has been shown to promote cell survival in response to oxidative stress, in part by directing an evolutionarily conserved p38 MAPK-Akt survival cascade. Aberrant Rit signaling has recently been implicated as a driver mutation in human cancer, adding importance to the characterization of critical Rit effector pathways. However, the mechanism by which Rit-p38 signaling regulated Akt activity was unknown. Here, we identify mTORC2 as a critical downstream mediator of Rit-dependent survival signaling in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress. Rit interacts with Sin1 (MAPKAP1), and Rit loss compromises ROS-dependent mTORC2 complex activation, blunting mTORC2-mediated phosphorylation of Akt kinase. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the p38/mTORC2/Akt signaling cascade mediates Rit-dependent oxidative stress survival. Inhibition of this previously unrecognized cascade should be explored as a potential therapy of Rit-dependent malignancies. 
Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal dominant disorder consisting of short stature, short and/or webbed neck, distinctive facial features, cardiac abnormalities, cryptorchidism, and coagulation defects. NS exhibits genetic heterogeneity, associated with mutated genes that participate in RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction. Recently, a new gene (RIT1) was discovered as the causative gene in 17 of 180 Japanese individuals who were negative for the previously known genes for NS and were studied using exome sequencing (four patients), followed by Sanger sequencing (13 patients). The present study used the same technique in 70 Brazilian patients with NS and identified six with RIT1 missense mutations. Thus, we confirm that RIT1 is responsible for approximately 10% of the patients negative for mutations in the previously known genes. The phenotype includes a high frequency of high birth weight, relative macrocephaly, left ventricular hypertrophy, and ectodermal findings, such as curly hair, hyperpigmentation, and wrinkled palms and soles. Short stature and pectus deformity were less frequent. The majority of patients with a RIT1 mutation did not show apparent intellectual disability. Because of the relatively high frequency of mutations in RIT1 among patients with NS and its occurrence in different populations, we suggest that it should be added to the list of genes included in panels for the molecular diagnosis of NS through targeted next-generation sequencing.
Lung adenocarcinoma is comprised of distinct mutational subtypes characterized by mutually exclusive oncogenic mutations in RTK/RAS pathway members KRAS, EGFR, BRAF and ERBB2, and translocations involving ALK, RET and ROS1. Identification of these oncogenic events has transformed the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma via application of therapies targeted toward specific genetic lesions in stratified patient populations. However, such mutations have been reported in only ∼55% of lung adenocarcinoma cases in the United States, suggesting other mechanisms of malignancy are involved in the remaining cases. Here we report somatic mutations in the small GTPase gene RIT1 in ∼2% of lung adenocarcinoma cases that cluster in a hotspot near the switch II domain of the protein. RIT1 switch II domain mutations are mutually exclusive with all other known lung adenocarcinoma driver mutations. Ectopic expression of mutated RIT1 induces cellular transformation in vitro and in vivo, which can be reversed by combined PI3K and MEK inhibition. These data identify RIT1 as a driver oncogene in a specific subset of lung adenocarcinomas and suggest PI3K and MEK inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy in RIT1-mutated tumors. 
RAS GTPases mediate a wide variety of cellular functions, including cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. Recent studies have revealed that germline mutations and mosaicism for classical RAS mutations, including those in HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS, cause a wide spectrum of genetic disorders. These include Noonan syndrome and related disorders (RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase [RAS/MAPK] pathway syndromes, or RASopathies), nevus sebaceous, and Schimmelpenning syndrome. In the present study, we identified a total of nine missense, nonsynonymous mutations in RIT1, encoding a member of the RAS subfamily, in 17 of 180 individuals (9%) with Noonan syndrome or a related condition but with no detectable mutations in known Noonan-related genes. Clinical manifestations in the RIT1-mutation-positive individuals are consistent with those of Noonan syndrome, which is characterized by distinctive facial features, short stature, and congenital heart defects. Seventy percent of mutation-positive individuals presented with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; this frequency is high relative to the overall 20% incidence in individuals with Noonan syndrome. Luciferase assays in NIH 3T3 cells showed that five RIT1 alterations identified in children with Noonan syndrome enhanced ELK1 transactivation. The introduction of mRNAs of mutant RIT1 into 1-cell-stage zebrafish embryos was found to result in a significant increase of embryos with craniofacial abnormalities, incomplete looping, a hypoplastic chamber in the heart, and an elongated yolk sac. These results demonstrate that gain-of-function mutations in RIT1 cause Noonan syndrome and show a similar biological effect to mutations in other RASopathy-related genes. 
Rit, along with Rin and Drosophila Ric, comprises the Rit subfamily of Ras-related small GTPases. Although the cellular functions of many Ras family GTPases are well established, the physiological significance of Rit remains poorly understood. Loss of Rit sensitizes multiple mammalian cell lines and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from Rit(-/-) mice to oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis. However, whether Rit-mediated pro-survival signaling extends to other cell types, particularly neurons, is presently unknown. Here, to examine these issues we generated a transgenic mouse overexpressing constitutively active Rit (Rit(Q79L)) exclusively in neurons, under control of the Synapsin I promoter. Active Rit-expressing hippocampal neurons display a dramatic increase in oxidative stress resistance. Moreover, pharmacological inhibitor studies demonstrate that p38 MAPK, rather than a MEK/ERK signaling cascade, is required for Rit-mediated protection. Together, the present studies identify a critical role for the Rit-p38 MAPK signaling cascade in promoting hippocampal neuron survival following oxidative stress.
RIT1 belongs to the RAS family of small GTPases. Germline and somatic RIT1 mutations have been identified in Noonan syndrome (NS) and cancer, respectively. By using heterologous expression systems and purified recombinant proteins, we identified the p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) as novel direct effector of RIT1. We found RIT1 also to directly interact with the RHO GTPases CDC42 and RAC1, both of which are crucial regulators of actin dynamics upstream of PAK1. These interactions are independent of the guanine nucleotide bound to RIT1. Disease-causing RIT1 mutations enhance protein-protein interaction between RIT1 and PAK1, CDC42 or RAC1 and uncouple complex formation from serum and growth factors. We show that the RIT1-PAK1 complex regulates cytoskeletal rearrangements as expression of wild-type RIT1 and its mutant forms resulted in dissolution of stress fibers and reduction of mature paxillin-containing focal adhesions in COS7 cells. This effect was prevented by co-expression of RIT1 with dominant-negative CDC42 or RAC1 and kinase-dead PAK1. By using a transwell migration assay, we show that RIT1 wildtype and the disease-associated variants enhance cell motility. Our work demonstrates a new function for RIT1 in controlling actin dynamics via acting in a signaling module containing PAK1 and RAC1/CDC42, and highlights defects in cell adhesion and migration as possible disease mechanism underlying NS.
RASopathies are a group of heterogeneous conditions caused by germline mutations in RAS/MAPK signalling pathway genes. With next-generation sequencing (NGS), sequencing capacity is no longer a limitation to molecular diagnosis. Instead, the rising number of variants of unknown significance (VUSs) poses challenges to clinical interpretation and genetic counselling. We investigated the potential of an integrated pipeline combining NGS and the functional assessment of variants for the diagnosis of RASopathies. We included 63 Chinese patients with RASopathies that had previously tested negative for PTPN11 and HRAS mutations. In these patients, we performed a genetic analysis of genes associated with RASopathies using a multigene NGS panel and Sanger sequencing. For the VUSs, we evaluated evidence from genetic, bioinformatic and functional data. Twenty disease-causing mutations were identified in the 63 patients, providing a primary diagnostic yield of 31.7%. Four VUSs were identified in five patients. The functional assessment supported the pathogenicity of the RAF1 and RIT1 VUSs, while the significance of two VUSs in A2ML1 remained unclear. In summary, functional analysis improved the diagnostic yield from 31.7% to 36.5%. Although technically demanding and time-consuming, a functional genetic diagnostic analysis can ease the clinical translation of these findings to aid bedside interpretation.
Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is known to have diverse effects on brain structure and function, including the promotion of stem cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the adult dentate gyrus. However, the intracellular pathways downstream of the IGF-1 receptor that contribute to these diverse physiological actions remain relatively uncharacterized. Here, we demonstrate that the Ras-related GTPase, RIT1, plays a critical role in IGF-1-dependent neurogenesis. Studies in hippocampal neuronal precursor cells (HNPCs) demonstrate that IGF-1 stimulates a RIT1-dependent increase in Sox2 levels, resulting in pro-neural gene expression and increased cellular proliferation. In this novel cascade, RIT1 stimulates Akt-dependent phosphorylation of Sox2 at T118, leading to its stabilization and transcriptional activation. When compared to wild-type HNPCs, RIT1 -/- HNPCs show deficient IGF-1-dependent Akt signaling and neuronal differentiation, and accordingly, Sox2-dependent hippocampal neurogenesis is significantly blunted following IGF-1 infusion in knockout (RIT1 -/- ) mice. Consistent with a role for RIT1 function in the modulation of activity-dependent plasticity, exercise-mediated potentiation of hippocampal neurogenesis is also diminished in RIT1 -/- mice. Taken together, these data identify the previously uncharacterized IGF1-RIT1-Akt-Sox2 signaling pathway as a key component of neurogenic niche sensing, contributing to the regulation of neural stem cell homeostasis.
First messenger-dependent activation of MAP kinases in neuronal and endocrine cells is critical for cell differentiation and function and requires guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)-mediated activation of downstream Ras family small GTPases, which ultimately lead to ERK, JNK, and p38 phosphorylation. Because there are numerous GEFs and also a host of Ras family small GTPases, it is important to know which specific GEF-small GTPase dyad functions in a given cellular process. Here we investigated the upstream activators and downstream effectors of signaling via the GEF Epac2 in the neuroendocrine NS-1 cell line. Three cAMP sensors, Epac2, PKA, and neuritogenic cAMP sensor-Rapgef2, mediate distinct cellular outputs: p38-dependent growth arrest, cAMP response element-binding protein-dependent cell survival, and ERK-dependent neuritogenesis, respectively, in these cells. Previously, we found that cAMP-induced growth arrest of PC12 and NS-1 cells requires Epac2-dependent activation of p38 MAP kinase, which posed the important question of how Epac2 engages p38 without simultaneously activating other MAP kinases in neuronal and endocrine cells. We now show that the small GTP-binding protein Rap2A is the obligate effector for, and GEF substrate of, Epac2 in mediating growth arrest through p38 activation in NS-1 cells. This new pathway is distinctly parcellated from the G protein-coupled receptor → Gs → adenylate cyclase → cAMP → PKA → cAMP response element-binding protein pathway mediating cell survival and the G protein-coupled receptor → Gs → adenylate cyclase → cAMP → neuritogenic cAMP sensor-Rapgef2 → B-Raf → MEK → ERK pathway mediating neuritogenesis in NS-1 cells.
Noonan syndrome is a well-known genetic condition associating congenital heart defects, short stature, and distinctive facial features. Pulmonary valve stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are the most frequent cardiac abnormalities, the latter being associated with a higher mortality. Here we report for the first time, a case of congenital left main coronary artery atresia in a Noonan syndrome associated with RIT1 variant, leading to unrescued sudden death. This case-report supports the already-suspected severity of the RIT1-related Noonan syndrome compared to average Noonan syndrome, and should encourage clinicians to be very cautious with these patients.
Adult neurogenesis, the process of generating mature neurons from neuronal progenitor cells, makes critical contributions to neural circuitry and brain function in both healthy and disease states. Neurogenesis is a highly regulated process in which diverse environmental and physiological stimuli are relayed to resident neural stem cell populations to control the transcription of genes involved in self-renewal and differentiation. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing neurogenesis is necessary for the development of translational strategies to harness this process for neuronal repair. Here we report that the Ras-related GTPase RIT1 serves to control the sequential proliferation and differentiation of adult hippocampal neural progenitor cells, with in vivo expression of active RIT1 driving robust adult neurogenesis. Gene expression profiling analysis demonstrates increased expression of a specific set of transcription factors known to govern adult neurogenesis in response to active RIT1 expression in the hippocampus, including sex-determining region Y-related HMG box 2 (Sox2), a well established regulator of stem cell self-renewal and neurogenesis. In adult hippocampal neuronal precursor cells, RIT1 controls an Akt-dependent signaling cascade, resulting in the stabilization and transcriptional activation of phosphorylated Sox2. This study supports a role for RIT1 in relaying niche-derived signals to neural/stem progenitor cells to control transcription of genes involved in self-renewal and differentiation.
Noonan syndrome is a common autosomal dominant disorder characterized by short stature, congenital heart disease and facial dysmorphia with an incidence of 1/1000 to 2500 live births. Up to now, several genes have been proven to be involved in the disturbance of the transduction signal through the RAS-MAP Kinase pathway and the manifestation of Noonan syndrome. The first gene described was PTPN11, followed by SOS1, RAF1, KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, MAP2K1, and RIT1, and recently SOS2, LZTR1, and A2ML1, among others. Progressively, the physiopathology and molecular etiology of most signs of Noonan syndrome have been demonstrated, and inheritance patterns as well as genetic counseling have been established. In this review, we summarize the data concerning clinical features frequently observed in Noonan syndrome, and then, we describe the molecular etiology as well as the physiopathology of most Noonan syndrome-causing genes. In the second part of this review, we assess the mutational rate of Noonan syndrome-causing genes reported up to now in most screening studies. This review should give clinicians as well as geneticists a full view of the molecular aspects of Noonan syndrome and the authentic prevalence of the mutational events of its causing-genes. It will also facilitate laying the groundwork for future molecular diagnosis research, and the development of novel treatment strategies.
Noonan syndrome is the most frequent of the congenital group of malformation syndromes caused by germline mutations that encode components of the RAS/MAPK pathway, termed RASopathies, one of the most frequent congenital genetic disorders in the clinical practice. Recently RIT1 mutations have been reported in patients with Noonan syndrome.
A 7 years-old girl with a clinical diagnosis of Noonan syndrome, and with a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy included in her clinical manifestations, where a de novo heterozygous, probably pathogenic, novel mutation in RIT1, c.295T&gt;C (p.Phe99Leu), has been identified.
RIT1 shares homology with other RAS proteins and the expression of mutant alleles demonstrates a gain-of-function effect supporting a causative role in Noonan syndrome pathogenesis. Data suggest that the frequency of RIT1 mutations can be estimated as 3-5% in Noonan syndrome patients. These cases compared with Noonan patients harboring mutations in other genes are characterized by high frequency of prenatal abnormalities and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and lower frequencies of short stature and pectus abnormalities. We emphasize the importance of the novel identified genes in order to be included in the diagnostic panels.
RIT1: un nuevo gen causal del sindrome de Noonan.
Introduccion. El sindrome de Noonan es el mas frecuente del grupo de los sindromes malformativos congenitos originados por mutaciones germinales en genes de la via RAS/MAPK, denominados genericamente RAS-opatias, uno de los grupos mas comunes de alteraciones geneticas congenitas en la practica clinica. Recientemente se han descrito mutaciones en el gen RIT1 en pacientes con sindrome de Noonan. Caso clinico. Nina de 7 anos con diagnostico clinico de sindrome de Noonan, que entre sus manifestaciones clinicas incluye miocardiopatia hipertrofica, en la que se ha identificado una mutacion de novo en heterocigosis, en RIT1, c.295T&gt;C (p.Phe99Leu), no descrita previamente, probablemente causal. Conclusiones. RIT1 comparte homologia con otras proteinas RAS y la expresion de alelos mutantes origina un efecto de ganancia de funcion que apoya su papel causal en el sindrome de Noonan. Podemos estimar actualmente que es responsable de un 3-5% de los casos del sindrome. Estos casos con sindrome de Noonan, respecto a los que presentan mutaciones en otros genes, se caracterizan por una mayor frecuencia de alteraciones prenatales, alta frecuencia de miocardiopatia hipertrofica y menor frecuencia de talla baja y deformidad toracica. Destaca la importancia de incorporar los nuevos genes identificados en los paneles diagnosticos.
Mutations in RIT1, involved in the RAS-MAPK pathway, have recently been identified as a cause for Noonan syndrome. We present two patients with Noonan syndrome caused by a RIT1 mutation with novel phenotypic manifestations, severe bilateral lower limb lymphedema starting during puberty, and fetal hydrops resulting in intrauterine fetal death, respectively. Including our patients, a total of 52 patients have been reported with Noonan syndrome caused by a RIT1 mutation. Our report contributes to the delineation of the phenotype associated with RIT1 mutations and underlines that lymphatic involvement is part of this spectrum. In addition, we provide an overview of the currently described Noonan syndrome patients with RIT1 mutations in literature. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by craniofacial dysmorphism, growth retardation, cardiac abnormalities, and learning difficulties. It belongs to the RASopathies, which are caused by germ-line mutations in genes encoding components of the RAS mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. RIT1 was recently reported as a disease gene for NS, but the number of published cases is still limited.
We sequenced RIT1 in 310 mutation-negative individuals with a suspected RASopathy and prospectively in individuals who underwent genetic testing for NS. Using a standardized form, we recorded clinical features of all RIT1 mutation-positive patients. Clinical and genotype data from 36 individuals with RIT1 mutation reported previously were reviewed.
Eleven different RIT1 missense mutations, three of which were novel, were identified in 33 subjects from 28 families; codons 57, 82, and 95 represent mutation hotspots. In relation to NS of other genetic etiologies, prenatal abnormalities, cardiovascular disease, and lymphatic abnormalities were common in individuals with RIT1 mutation, whereas short stature, intellectual problems, pectus anomalies, and ectodermal findings were less frequent.
RIT1 is one of the major genes for NS. The RIT1-associated phenotype differs gradually from other NS subtypes, with a high prevalence of cardiovascular manifestations, especially hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and lymphatic problems.Genet Med 18 12, 1226-1234.
RASopathies are autosomal dominant disorders caused by mutations in more than 10 known genes that regulate the RAS/MAPK pathway. Noonan syndrome (NS) is a RASopathy characterized by a distinctive facial appearance, musculoskeletal abnormalities, and congenital heart defects. We have recently identified mutations in RIT1 in patients with NS. To delineate the clinical manifestations in RIT1 mutation-positive patients, we further performed a RIT1 analysis in RASopathy patients and identified 7 RIT1 mutations, including two novel mutations, p.A77S and p.A77T, in 14 of 186 patients. Perinatal abnormalities, including nuchal translucency, fetal hydrops, pleural effusion, or chylothorax and congenital heart defects, are observed in all RIT1 mutation-positive patients. Luciferase assays in NIH 3T3 cells demonstrated that the newly identified RIT1 mutants, including p.A77S and p.A77T, and the previously identified p.F82V, p.T83P, p.Y89H, and p.M90I, enhanced Elk1 transactivation. Genotype-phenotype correlation analyses of previously reported NS patients harboring RIT1, PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, and KRAS revealed that hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (56 %) was more frequent in patients harboring a RIT1 mutation than in patients harboring PTPN11 (9 %) and SOS1 mutations (10 %). The rates of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were similar between patients harboring RIT1 mutations and patients harboring RAF1 mutations (75 %). Short stature (52 %) was less prevalent in patients harboring RIT1 mutations than in patients harboring PTPN11 (71 %) and RAF1 (83 %) mutations. These results delineate the clinical manifestations of RIT1 mutation-positive NS patients: high frequencies of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, atrial septal defects, and pulmonary stenosis; and lower frequencies of ptosis and short stature.
Nimotuzumab (h-R3) is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) which recognizes the external domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with high specificity. It was demonstrated that h-R3 has a unique clinical profile for immunotherapy of adult gliomas and pediatric pontine gliomas. The aim of this work was to evaluate the conjugate (177)Lu-h-R3 as a potential radioimmunoconjugate for radioimmunotherapy (RIT) of tumors overexpressing EGFR.
h-R3 was modified with the macrocylcic ligand S-2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane tetraacetic acid (p-SCN-Bn-DOTA) and the acyclic ligand S-2-(4-Isothiocyanatobenzyl)-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (p-SCN-Bn-DTPA); the immunoconjugates were labeled with no-carried added (177)Lu. Specificity and affinity were tested using radioimmunoassays in a cell line overexpressing EGFR. Biodistribution in mice, healthy or bearing A431 epithelial carcinoma xenografts, was performed for 11 days. Tumor uptake, the influence of the nature of the chelate and the way of administration were studied. Absorbed dose in tumor and selected organs was calculated using the OLINDA/EXM software; the data from the animals was extrapolated to humans.
(177)Lu-h-R3 conjugates were obtained with specific activity up to 915 MBq/mg without significant loss of immunoreactivity. The binding of (177)Lu-h-R3 conjugates to A431 cells showed to be EGFR specific, and the affinity was similar to native h-R3. Tumor uptake reached a maximum value of 22.4±3.1 %ID/g at 72 h and remained ~20% ID/g over 1 week. Locoregional application showed better tumor/nontumor ratios than intravenous application.
(177)Lu-h-R3 should be considered for further evaluations as a potential radiopharmaceutical for RIT of tumors overexpressing EGFR.
Autoimmune hyperthyroidism may occur several months after radioiodine therapy (RIT) for functional thyroid autonomy. Exacerbation of pre-existing subclinical Graves' disease (GD) has been held responsible for this phenomenon. Determination of TSH receptor antibody using solubilised porcine epithelial cell membranes is insensitive and may have failed to diagnose GD in these patients before RIT. Following the introduction of a more sensitive assay, using the human TSH receptor as an antigen, it has been expected that the incidence of radiation-induced GD after RIT for functional thyroid autonomy will be reduced. In a first group of 1,428 patients treated between November 1993 and March 1997 (group I) we used the porcine TRAb assay to exclude GD, while in a second group comprising 1,408 patients treated between January 2000 and December 2001 (group II), GD was excluded using the human TRAb assay. A matched control group of 231 patients was derived from group II. In group I a total of 15 (1.05%) patients developed obvious or suspected radiation-induced GD, while in group II 17 (1.2%) did so; the interval until development of GD was 8.4 and 8.8 months, respectively, after RIT. Serum anti-thyroid peroxidase levels before RIT were elevated in 36.4% of group I patients and 47.1% of group II patients, but in only 5.6% of the control group. Other non-specific signs of mild immunopathy of the thyroid were seen retrospectively in 73.3%, 64.7% and 16.0% of the patients in these three groups, respectively. In conclusion, the introduction of a high-sensitivity TRAb assay did not reduce the incidence of autoimmune hyperthyroidism occurring late after RIT for functional thyroid autonomy, but mild immunopathy of the thyroid is seen more frequently in these patients and seems to be a predisposing factor in the development of radiation-induced GD.
Osteosarcoma overall survival has plateaued around 70%, without meaningful improvements in over 30years. Outcomes for patients with overt metastatic disease at presentation or who relapse are dismal. In this study we investigated a novel osteosarcoma therapy utilizing radioimmunotherapy (RIT) targeted to IGF2R, which is widely expressed in OS.
Binding efficiency of the Rhenium-188(188Re)-labeled IGF2R-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) to IGF2R on OS17 OS cells was assessed with Scatchard plot analysis. Biodistribution studies were performed in heterotopic murine osteosarcoma xenografts. Tumor growth was compared over a 24-day period post-treatment between mice randomized to receive 188Re-labeled IGF2R-specific murine mAb MEM-238 (188Re-MEM-238) or one of three controls: 188Re-labeled isotype control mAb, unlabeled MEM-238, or no treatment.
Results demonstrate that the radioimmunoconjugate had a high binding constant to IGF2R. Both 188Re-MEM-238 and the isotype control had similar initial distribution in normal tissue. After 48h 188Re-MEM-238 exhibited a 1.8 fold selective uptake within tumor compared to the isotype control (p=0.057). Over 24days, the tumor growth ratio was suppressed in animals treated with RIT compared to unlabeled and untreated controls (p=0.005) as demonstrated by a 38% reduction of IGF2R expressing osteosarcoma cells in the RIT group (p=0.002).
In conclusion, given the lack of new effective therapies in osteosarcoma, additional investigation into this target is warranted.
High expression of IGF2R on osteosarcoma tumors, paired with the specificity and in vivo anti-cancer activity of 188Re-labeled IGF2R-specific mAb suggests that IGF2R may represent a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of osteosarcoma.
This targeted approach offers the benefits of being independent of a specific pathway, a resistance mechanism, and/or an inherent biologic tumor trait and therefore is relevant to all OS tumors that express IGF2R.
No comprehensive analysis has previously been performed to evaluate the clinical aspects of and microbiological evidence associated with Mycobacteroides abscessus complex (MABC) infection in a region, such as Japan, with a low MABC incidence.
This study aimed to clarify the clinicopathological characteristics of MABC, which included clinical relatedness to erm(41) sequevar, phenotype (as colony morphology and minimum inhibitory concentration), and genotype.
A total of 121 MABC patients (68 with M. abscessus subsp. abscessus and 53 with M. abscessus subsp. massiliense) were recruited into this retrospective clinical-biological study from tertiary hospitals in Japan between 2004 and 2014.
Approximately 30% of MABC patients had a history of previous nontuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) disease. Furthermore, 24.8% of the patients had another concomitant NTM infection after they were diagnosed with MABC. Fewer than 10% of the patients in the M. abscessus group had T28C in erm(41). While we observed a higher conversion rate for M. massiliense than for M. abscessus (72.4% and 34.8%, respectively, p = 0.002), recurrence remained relatively common for M. massiliense (31.0%). In the M. abscessus patients, the MIC of clarithromycin (CLR) was significantly lower on day 3 in patients with a better treatment response than in refractory patients (The median MIC; 0.75 μg/ml v.s 2.0 μg/ml, p = 0.03). There was no significant relation between clinical manifestations and variable number of tandem repeat genotypes.
Because the history and simultaneous isolation of other NTM in MABC infection are relatively common, these information should be carefully translated into clinical actions. The evaluation of early CLR resistance in M. abscessus and the erm(41) functions should be important to improve the treatment strategy.
Girentuximab (cG250) targets carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), a protein which is expressed on the surface of most renal cancer cells (RCCs). cG250 labeled with 177Lu has been used in clinical trials for radioimmunotherapy (RIT) of RCCs. In this work, an extensive characterization of the immunoconjugates allowed optimization of the labeling conditions with 177Lu while maintaining immunoreactivity of cG250, which was then investigated in in vitro and in vivo experiments. cG250 was conjugated with S-2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane tetraacetic acid (DOTA(SCN)) by using incubation times between 30 and 90 min and characterized by mass spectrometry. Immunoconjugates with five to ten DOTA(SCN) molecules per cG250 molecule were obtained. Conjugates with ratios less than six DOTA(SCN)/cG250 had higher in vitro antigen affinity, both pre- and postlabeling with 177Lu. Radiochemical stability increased, in the presence of sodium ascorbate, which prevents radiolysis. The immunoreactivity of the radiolabeled cG250 tested by specific binding to SK-RC-52 cells decreased when the DOTA content per conjugate increased. The in vivo tumor uptake was &lt; 10% ID/g and independent of the total amount of protein in the range between 5 and 100 µg cG250 per animal. Low tumor uptake was found to be due to significant necrotic areas and heterogeneous CAIX expression. In addition, low vascularity indicated relatively poor accessibility of the CAIX target.
Over the last decade, dual-energy CT scanners have gone from prototypes to clinically available machines, and spectral photon counting CT scanners are following. They require a specific reconstruction process, consisting of two steps: material decomposition and tomographic reconstruction. Image-based methods perform reconstruction, then decomposition, while projection-based methods perform decomposition first, and then reconstruction. As an alternative, 'one-step inversion' methods have been proposed, which perform decomposition and reconstruction simultaneously. Unfortunately, one-step methods are typically slower than their two-step counterparts, and in most CT applications, reconstruction time is critical. This paper therefore proposes to compare the convergence speeds of five one-step algorithms. We adapted all these algorithms to solve the same problem: spectral photon-counting CT reconstruction from five energy bins, using a three materials decomposition basis and spatial regularization. The paper compares a Bayesian method which uses non-linear conjugate gradient for minimization (Cai et al 2013 Med. Phys. 40 111916-31), three methods based on quadratic surrogates (Long and Fessler 2014 IEEE Trans. Med. Imaging 33 1614-26, Weidinger et al 2016 Int. J. Biomed. Imaging 2016 1-15, Mechlem et al 2018 IEEE Trans. Med. Imaging 37 68-80), and a primal-dual method based on MOCCA, a modified Chambolle-Pock algorithm (Barber et al 2016 Phys. Med. Biol. 61 3784). Some of these methods have been accelerated by using μ-preconditioning, i.e. by performing all internal computations not with the actual materials the object is made of, but with carefully chosen linear combinations of those. In this paper, we also evaluated the impact of three different μ-preconditioners on convergence speed. Our experiments on simulated data revealed vast differences in the number of iterations required to reach a common image quality objective: Mechlem et al (2018 IEEE Trans. Med. Imaging 37 68-80) needed ten iterations, Cai et al (2013 Med. Phys. 40 111916-31), Long and Fessler (2014 IEEE Trans. Med. Imaging 33 1614-26) and Weidinger et al (2016 Int. J. Biomed. Imaging 2016 1-15) several hundreds, and Barber et al (2016 Phys. Med. Biol. 61 3784) several thousands. We also sum up other practical aspects, like memory footprint and the need to tune extra parameters.
The aim of this study was to identify the molecules and pathways involved in the cross-talk between meniscus and synovium that may play a critical role in osteoarthritis (OA) pathophysiology. Samples of synovium and meniscus were collected from patients with early and end-stage OA and cultured alone or cocultured. Cytokines, chemokines, metalloproteases, and their inhibitors were evaluated at the gene and protein levels. The extracellular matrix (ECM) changes were also investigated. In early OA cultures, higher levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 messenger RNA were expressed by synovium and meniscus in coculture compared with meniscus cultured alone. RANTES release was significantly increased when the two tissues were cocultured compared with meniscus cultured alone. Increased levels of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) and MMP-10 proteins, as well as increased release of glycosaminoglycans and aggrecan CS846 epitope, were observed when synovium was cocultured with meniscus. In end-stage OA cultures, increased levels of IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) proteins were released in cocultures compared with cultures of meniscus alone. Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 21 (CCL21) protein release was higher in meniscus cultured alone and in coculture compared with synovium cultured alone. Increased levels of MMP-3 and 10 proteins were observed when tissues were cocultured compared with meniscus cultured alone. Aggrecan CS846 epitope release was increased in cocultures compared with cultures of either tissue cultured alone. Our study showed the production of inflammatory molecules by synovium and meniscus which could trigger inflammatory signals in early OA patients, and induce ECM loss in the progressive and final stages of OA pathology.
The aim of this study is to evaluate the radiation safety of caregiving people contacting the child and adolescent patients with thyroid cancer who received radioactive iodine-131 (RIT) treatment by comparison with external dose rate measurements of adult patients according to their administered activities and days of hospitalization. We retrospectively evaluated external dose rate measurement of 158 children and adolescent patients and 158 adult patients. During the RIT, the hospitalization time were grouped as 2, 3 and 4 d, and the administered activities as &lt;3700, 3700 and &gt;3700 MBq. The values of external dose rate measurements of children and adolescents were statistically significantly higher than the adult group. Different approaches in radiation safety rules are required for children and adolescents. In terms of radiation safety, we suggest that more specific regulations for family members and caregivers should be established and informed.
Inter-fractional variations of breathing pattern and patient anatomy introduce dose uncertainties in proton therapy. One approach to monitor these variations is to utilize the cone-beam computed tomography (CT, CBCT) scans routinely taken for patient positioning, reconstruct them as 4DCBCTs, and generate 'virtual CTs' (vCTs), combining the accurate CT numbers of the diagnostic 4DCT and the geometry of the daily 4DCBCT by using deformable image registration (DIR). In this study different algorithms for 4DCBCT reconstruction and DIR were evaluated. For this purpose, CBCT scans of a moving ex vivo porcine lung phantom with 663 and 2350 projections respectively were acquired, accompanied by an additional 4DCT as reference. The CBCT projections were sorted in 10 phase bins with the Amsterdam-shroud method and reconstructed phase-by-phase using first a FDK reconstruction from the Reconstruction Toolkit (RTK) and again an iterative reconstruction algorithm implemented in the Gadgetron Toolkit. The resulting 4DCBCTs were corrected by DIR of the corresponding 4DCT phases, using both a morphons algorithm from REGGUI and a b-spline deformation from Plastimatch. The resulting 4DvCTs were compared to the 4DCT by visual inspection and by calculating water equivalent thickness (WET) maps from the phantom's surface to the distal edge of a target from various angles. The optimized procedure was successfully repeated with mismatched input phases and on a clinical patient dataset. Proton treatment plans were simulated on the 4DvCTs and the dose distributions compared to the reference based on the 4DCT via gamma pass rate analysis. A combination of iterative reconstruction and morphons DIR yielded the most accurate 4DvCTs, with median WET differences under 2mm and 3%/3mm gamma pass rates per phase between 89% and 99%. These results suggest that image correction of iteratively reconstructed 4DCBCTs with a morphons DIR of the planning CT may yield sufficiently accurate 4DvCTs for daily time resolved proton dose calculations.
In an effort to develop efficient Ru(II)-NHC-based catalyst considering their stereoelectronic effect for hydride-transfer reaction, we found that the ancillary NHC ligand can play a significant role in its catalytic performance. This effect is demonstrated by comparing the activity of two different types of orthometalated precatalysts of general formula [( p-cymene)(NHC)RuII(X)] (NHC = an imidazolylidene-based ImNHC, compound 2a-c, or a mesoionic triazolylidene-based tzNHC, compound 4) in transfer hydrogenation of carbonyl substrates. The electron-rich precatalyst, 2c, containing p-OMe-substituted NHC ligand performed significantly better than both unsubstituted complex 2a and p-CF3 substituted electron-poor complex 2b in ketone reduction. Whereas bulky mesoionic triazolylidene ligand containing complex 4 was found to be superior catalyst for aldehyde reduction and the precatalyst 2a is more suitable for the selective transfer hydrogenation of a wide range of aromatic aldimines to amines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study on the effect of stereoelectronic tuning of ancillary orthometalated NHC ligand in Ru(II)-catalyzed transfer hydrogenations of various types of unsaturated compounds with broad substrate scope.
BACKGROUND: Cost-containment through indigenous development and production and its subsequent examination in clinical settings would be a pivotal step for bringing radioimmunotherapy (RIT) agents to more widespread clinical practice in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients, especially in developing countries. AIMS and OBJECTIVES: To examine the biodistribution and dosimetry of indigenously developed and radiolabeled 131I-Rituximab, using the monoclonal antibody of chimeric origin, in patients of B cell lymphoma for its potential use in RIT. MATERIALS and METHODS: This was a prospective study involving patients of B-cell NHL who underwent low dose diagnostic scan for the dosimetric and biodistribution studies. The study was presented and approved by the Institutional Scientific and Medical Ethics Committee and the product was approved by the regulatory body of DAE (Department of Atomic Energy) India, the Radiopharmaceutical Committee (RPC), for preliminary dosimetric studies. Patients with documented CD20 (Cluster Differentiation) positive NHL who were planned for and received Rituximab based chemotherapy under medical oncology supervision were recruited. Soon after the IV (Intravenous) Rituximab infusion (4-6 hrs), the small diagnostic dose of indigenously produced radioiodinated rituximab was administered by intravenous infusion. Serial planar (anterior and posterior) whole body gamma camera images were undertaken soon after the infusion (pre-void and post void) and thereafter on day 1, day 2, day 4 and day 6. All imaging were performed in Siemens Symbia dual head gamma camera equipped with 1.0 cm NaI (Tl) crystals and high-energy collimators. A 15 % energy window around 364 KeV, the dominant γ-ray energy of 131I was applied. During each whole body γ-scintigraphy, a source of 131I with known activity was used as the reference standard required for dosimetry calculations. RESULTS: A total of 13 patients have undergone assessment in this prospective study following the aforementioned study protocol. The calculated patient specific administered dose from the cumulative activity, that will give a whole-body radiation absorbed dose of 75cGy, using the MIRD (Medical Internal Radiation Dose) schema, ranged from 3095.42 to 6330.33 MBq(83.66 to 171.09 mCi), mean 3986.01±863.95 MBq(107.73±23.35 mCi) and median 3697.41 MBq(99.93 mCi). The mean residence time of this indigenous radiopharmaceutical was 69.54h. Within first 48 hours (2nd day) ≥50% of the injected activity was cleared and by 144 hours (6th day) ≥80% of the injected activity was cleared from the body in all patients. The patient-specific administered dose that would give a whole-body radiation absorbed dose of 75cGy, calculated by mean residence time and activity-hours ranged from 2654.75 to 6210.45 MBq (71.75to 167.85 mCi) mean 3576.42±927.59 MBq(96.66±25.07 mCi) and median 3421.02 MBq (92.46 mCi). With respect to organ-specific dosimetry, apart from blood pool (3.77Gy) and spleen (4.02Gy), the organs with decreasing order of mean radiation absorbed dose were lung (0.97Gy), liver (0.69Gy) and kidneys (0.7Gy) calculated for proposed therapeutic doses of the product. CONCLUSION: The indigenous product demonstrated kinetics similar in lines with that of approved commercially available radiopharmaceuticals, with advantage of less HAMA (Human Anti Mouse Antibody) response due to the pharmaceutical being a chimeric antibody rather than murine antibody and hence could be safely administered in clinical settings. In none of the organs there was dose limiting radiation exposure (≥ 20Gy) at the proposed therapeutic doses of this indigenous 131I labeled rituximab product.
The aim of this study was, first, to ascertain the efficacy of radioiodine therapy (RIT) for Graves' disease (GD) based on a calculated-dose regime and, second, to determine the value of 99mTc-pertechnetate thyroid scintigraphy in predicting the clinical outcomes of RIT.
One hundred and thirty 9consecutive GD patients who underwent RIT using a calculated-dose method in our hospital from January 2015 to September 2015 were retrospectively evaluated. Radioiodine dose was calculated based on the Marinelli's formula. 99mTc-pertechnetate uptake, age, gender, thyroid mass, duration of the disease, previous antithyroid drugs treatment, serum levels of TSH, FT3 and FT4, a positive rate of TPOAb and Anti-TRAb, radioiodine dose and follow-up were evaluated as potential interference factors for RIT success.
One hundred and 8(77.7%) GD patients including 71 (51.1%) euthyroid and 37 (26.6%) hypothyroid were successful, but 31 (22.3%) remained hyperthyroid (treatment failure). Significant differences were found between the treatment success group and the failure group in 99mTc-pertechnetate uptake (p&lt;0.0001), the duration of disease (P=.0140) and positive rate of Anti-TRAb (P=.0103). 99mTc-pertechnetate uptake is an independent risk factor for predicting treatment failure (P=.0394). Using a cut-off value of 18.4%, 99mTc-pertechnetate uptake could predict treatment failure with a sensitivity of 84.3%, and a specificity of 80.6%.
Our study has shown that a calculated radioiodine dose is effective in treating GD patients with a consequent low rate of hypothyroid. A 99mTc-pertechnetate uptake above 18.4% is a significant predictor of treatment failure and these patients should receive a higher radioiodine dose in this scenario.
Cell migration is essential to many life processes, including immune response, tissue repair, and cancer progression. A reliable quantitative characterization of the cell migration can therefore aid in the high throughput screening of drug efficacy in wound healing and cancer treatments. In this work, we report what we believe is the first use of SiR-Hoechst for extended live tracking and automated analysis of cell migration and wound healing. We showed through rigorous statistical comparisons that this far-red label does not affect migratory behavior. We observed excellent automated tracking of random cell migration, in which the motility parameters (speed, displacement, path length, directionality ratio, persistence time, and direction autocorrelation) obtained closely match those obtained from manual tracking. We also present an analysis framework to characterize the healing of a scratch wound from the perspective of single cells. The use of SiR-Hoechst is advantageous for the crowded environments in wound healing assays because as long as cell nuclei do not overlap, continuous tracking can be maintained even if there is cell-cell contact. In this paper, we report wound recovery based on the number of cells migrating into the wound over time, normalized by the initial cell count prior to the infliction of the wound. This normalized cell count approach is impervious to operator bias during the arbitration of wound edges and is also robust against variability that arises due to differences in the cell density of different samples. Additional wound healing characteristics were also defined based on the evolution of cell speed and directionality during healing. Not unexpected, the wound healing cells exhibited much higher tendency to maintain the same migratory direction in comparison to the randomly migrating cells. The use of SiR-Hoechst thus greatly simplified the automation of single cell and whole population analysis with high spatial and temporal resolution over extended periods of time.
Radioiodine refractoriness in differentiated thyroid cancer remains an unsolved therapeutic problem. Response to retinoids might depend on specific genetic markers. In this retrospective analysis, associations between BRAF V600E and clinical outcomes after redifferentiation with retinoic acid (RA) and radioiodine therapy (RIT) were investigated. Thirteen patients with radioiodine-refractory (RAI-R) papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) were treated with 13-cis-RA followed by iodine-131 treatment at the Department of Endocrinology, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany. DNA sequencing was performed in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. Clinical outcome parameters were tumor size, thyroglobulin, and radioiodine uptake in correlation to mutational status. Differences of each parameter were compared before and after RA/RIT. Initial response showed no difference in patients with BRAF V600E compared to patients with wild type. However, after a median follow-up of 2 and a half years, 2 out of 3 patients with BRAF V600E showed response compared to 5 out of 9 with wild type under consideration of all 3 parameters. In this small cohort, more RAI-R PTC patients with BRAF V600E receiving redifferentiation therapy showed response. Verification in a larger study population analyzing mutational status in patients with RAI-R PTC might be helpful to identify patients where redifferentiation therapy might lead to an improved outcome.
Treatment of imported fire ant (IFA) hypersensitivity includes avoidance and venom immunotherapy (VIT) that reduces the risk of reactions to less than 5%. Previous studies have shown that rush immunotherapy (RIT) is safe and efficacious. It is unknown if multiple RIT procedures on individuals with breaks in VIT are safe and effective. This is a retrospective chart review of three patients who have undergone six IFA VIT rush protocols at our institution. Patients were all female with a median age of 27 years. All are active duty service members without medical problems who reside in an IFA endemic area. Reviewed protocols consisted of 10 injections of IFA whole body extract given in 1 day. Local reactions were the only side effect noted. All patients completed the protocols without further incident. Following each protocol, median VIT adherence was 9 months (range 2-72 months). Reasons for stopping VIT were deployment and pregnancy. Non-adherence is common and leads to breaks in VIT. The risk of VIT resumption in patients with previous RIT or VIT is unknown. This case series illustrates the safety and efficacy of repeated IFA VIT rush procedures in patients who for personal and service related reasons had breaks in VIT.
To examine the association between sequence variants in genetic risk factors for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and delayed rod-mediated dark adaptation (RMDA), the first functional biomarker for incident AMD, in older adults with normal macular health and early AMD.
Cross-sectional.
Adults 60 years of age or older showing normal macular health (defined as both eyes at step 1 on the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 9-step AMD classification system) and those with AMD in one or both eyes (defined as steps 2-9).
Single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped in the complement factor H (CFH) and ARMS2 genes using a Taqman assay. Rod-mediated dark adaptation was assessed in 1 eye after photobleach with targets centered at 5° on the inferior vertical meridian. Rate of dark adaptation was defined by rod intercept time (RIT), duration (in minutes) required for sensitivity to reach a criterion sensitivity level in the latter half of the second component of rod recovery. Associations between CFH and ARMS2 polymorphisms and RMDA were adjusted for age and smoking.
Rod intercept time.
The sample consisted of 543 participants having both genotype and RIT determination; 408 showed normal macular health and 135 demonstrated AMD, most having early AMD (124 of 135). For the combined sample, higher RIT (slower RMDA) was observed for both the A69S variant in ARMS2 and the Y402H variant in CFH (adjusted P = 0.0001 and P = 0.0023, respectively). For healthy participants, the A69S variant in ARMS2 was associated with higher RIT (adjusted P = 0.0011), whereas the Y402H variant in CFH was not (adjusted P = 0.2175). For AMD patients, the A69S variant of ARMS2 and the Y402H variant of CFH were associated with higher RIT (adjusted P = 0.0182 and P = 0.0222, respectively). Those with a larger number of high-risk ARMS2 and CFH alleles showed higher RIT, in both healthy and AMD groups (adjusted P = 0.0002 and P &lt; 0.0001, respectively).
We report a novel association wherein older adults with high-risk ARMS2 and CFH genotypes are more likely to demonstrate delayed RMDA, the first functional biomarker for incident early AMD. Before the AMD clinical phenotype is present, those showing normal macular health with the ARMS2 A69S allele demonstrate delayed RMDA. Understanding ARMS2 function is a research priority.
This study examined the ability of goldfish to visually identify 2D objects rotated in the picture plane. This ability would be adaptive for fish since they move in three dimensions and frequently view objects from different orientations. Goldfish performed a two-alternative forced choice task in which they were trained to discriminate between two objects at 0°, then tested with novel aspect angles (+/- 45°, +/- 90°, +/- 135°, 180°). Stimuli consisted of an arrow and half circle (Experiment 1) and line drawings of a turtle and frog (Experiments 2 and 3). In the first two experiments, the S+ and S- were presented at the same aspect angle. Performance in these experiments exceeded chance on four of seven novel aspect angles. Overall accuracy was not significantly different with complex stimuli (animal drawings) vs. simple stimuli (geometric shapes). In Experiment 3, when fish were tested with the S+ at varying aspect angles and the S- always presented at 0°, the fish failed to discriminate among the stimuli at all but one aspect angle. These goldfish viewing planar-rotated 2D objects did not display viewpoint-invariant performance, nor did they show a systematic decrement in performance as a function of aspect angle.
The increasing demand for reliable preclinical models and to reduce, refine and, if possible, replace animal studies have brought forth the development of complex tissue cultures in different research areas, including the musculoskeletal field. In this paper, we review the literature within last 10 years on the state of progress for in vitro models of osteochondral tissue cultures, taking into account the clinical relevance of the management and treatment of osteochondral lesions. According to the selected research criteria, 35 works, 27 of which with animal tissues and 8 with human tissues, resulted to be relevant for the purposes of this review. Data analyzed revealed a great heterogeneity among the proposed tissue culture models. The anatomical harvesting sites resulted to be mainly the knee stifle joint, both for animal (prevalently bovines) and human tissues derived from joint replacement surgery, and significant heterogeneity among culture conditions and media were found. To date, very few papers have focused on the set up of a reproducible in vitro model, applicable to a variety of studies, thus suggesting a relevant gap to fill in the development of advanced three-dimensional osteochondral culture models.
Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are often related with poor prognosis after radiotherapy. Depleting TAMs may thus be a promising method to improve the radio-therapeutic efficacy. Herein, we report a biocompatible and biodegradable nanoplatform based on calcium bisphosphonate (CaBP-PEG) nanoparticles for chelator-free radiolabeling chemistry, effective in vivo depletion of TAMs, and imaging-guided enhanced cancer radioisotope therapy (RIT). It is found that CaBP-PEG nanoparticles prepared via a mineralization method with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) coating could be labeled with various radioisotopes upon simple mixing, including gamma-emitting 99mTc for single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging, as well as beta-emitting 32P as a therapeutic radioisotope for RIT. Upon intravenous injection, CaBP(99mTc)-PEG nanoparticles exhibit efficient tumor homing, as evidenced by SPECT imaging. Owning to the function of bisphosphonates as clinical drugs to deplete TAMs, suppressed angiogenesis, normalized tumor vasculatures, enhanced intratumoral perfusion, and relieved tumor hypoxia are observed after TAM depletion induced by CaBP-PEG. Such modulated tumor microenvironment appears to be highly favorable for cancer RIT using CaBP(32P)-PEG as the radio-therapeutic agent, which offers excellent synergistic therapeutic effect in inhibiting the tumor growth. With great biocompatibility and multifunctionalities, such CaBP-PEG nanoparticles constituted by Ca2+ and a clinical drug would be rather attractive for clinical translation.
Interest in targeted alpha-therapy has surged due to α-particles' high cytotoxicity. However, the widespread clinical use of this approach could be limited by on-/off-target toxicities. Here, we investigated the inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder ligation between an 225Ac-labeled tetrazine radioligand and a trans-cyclooctene-bearing anti-CA19.9 antibody (5B1) for pretargeted α-radioimmunotherapy (PRIT) of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This alternative strategy is expected to reduce nonspecific toxicities as compared with conventional radioimmunotherapy (RIT).Experimental Design: A side-by-side comparison of 225Ac-PRIT and conventional RIT using a directly 225Ac-radiolabeled immunoconjugate evaluates the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of both methodologies in PDAC murine models.
A comparative biodistribution study of the PRIT versus RIT methodology underscored the improved pharmacokinetic properties (e.g., prolonged tumor uptake and increased tumor-to-tissue ratios) of the PRIT approach. Cerenkov imaging coupled to PRIT confirmed the in vivo biodistribution of 225Ac-radioimmunoconjugate but-importantly-further allowed for the ex vivo monitoring of 225Ac's radioactive daughters' redistribution. Human dosimetry was extrapolated from the mouse biodistribution and confirms the clinical translatability of 225Ac-PRIT. Furthermore, longitudinal therapy studies performed in subcutaneous and orthotopic PDAC models confirm the therapeutic efficacy of 225Ac-PRIT with the observation of prolonged median survival compared with control cohorts. Finally, a comparison with conventional RIT highlighted the potential of 225Ac-PRIT to reduce hematotoxicity while maintaining therapeutic effectiveness.
The ability of 225Ac-PRIT to deliver a radiotherapeutic payload while simultaneously reducing the off-target toxicity normally associated with RIT suggests that the clinical translation of this approach will have a profound impact on PDAC therapy.
Ritonavir (RIT) is a human immune deficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor (PI) active against HIV-1 and HIV-2. Among various adverse effects of PIs, hepatotoxicity is a very common adverse reaction of RIT which is concentration dependent. Red clover isoflavones are found to possess anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-apoptosis activity. Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated that these isoflavones can be used to alleviate the side-effects of drugs. Hence, the present study was inquested to ascertain the effect of Formononetin (FMN) and Biochanin A (BCA) on RIT induced hepatotoxicity.
Five groups of animals were subjected to treatment as control, toxic control (RIT), third group (RIT + FMN), fourth group (RIT + BCA), the fifth group (RIT + FMN + BCA) and sixth group (FMN + BCA) for 14 days. The animals were evaluated for estimation of liver toxicity markers, inflammatory biomarkers, in-vivo biochemical antioxidant parameters. The liver tissues were further evaluated histopathologically and western blotting examination for localization of apoptotic gene expression that plays a pivotal role in hepatotoxicity.
FMN and BCA ameliorated the increased levels of biochemical markers of liver, attenuated the RIT induced Bax, caspase-3, NFκB and eNOS activation and persuaded the Bcl2 and pAkt level. Alteration in the levels of inflammatory markers was also observed in both hepatic tissue and serum.
FMN and BCA exerts hepatoprotective effect through modulating the oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and reversing the tissue degeneration suggesting its therapeutic role in hepatotoxicity and other hepatocellular diseases.
Background and study aims  Traversing the ileocecal valve (ICV) is technically challenging with a retrograde approach to single-balloon enteroscopy (SBE). A novel technique called responsive insertion technology (RIT) colonoscopy was developed to obtain a higher cecal intubation rate in this setting. A prototype long SBE equipped with RIT (P-SBE) was developed to obtain superior insertability. The aim of this study was to compare the insertability of a standard single-balloon enteroscope (S-SBE) versus a P-SBE. Patients and methods  This study was a multicenter, randomized, non-blinded, trial of 62 patients with small bowel pathologies. All procedures were performed with SBE via the trans-anal route. Procedure success was defined as stable intubation of the terminal ileum (TI) 20 cm beyond the ICV. The primary variable was time to reach stable TI intubation 20 cm beyond the ICV (TSTII). If stable TI intubation was not achieved within 10 minutes, the initial SBE was removed through the indwelling overtube and replaced with another SBE. Results  Sixty patients were examined with two patients excluded from this study. TSTII using P-SBE was significantly decreased compared to S-SBE (mean P-SBE vs S-SBE: 98.3 vs 169.4 second, P  = 0.006). The completion rates for stable intubation within 10 minutes of using P-SBE and S-SBE were 96.8 % and 86.2 %, respectively ( P  = 0.19). On endoscope replacement, all patients had achieved stable TI intubation. Conclusions  SBE with RIT improves insertability when traversing the ileocecal valve in retrograde SBE.
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is the most common hematologic malignancy and the sixth cause of death from cancer in the USA. Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is a potentially curative therapeutic option for many NHL patients. Choosing the most effective conditioning regimen prior to ASCT can lead to longer survival in these patients, and, as in many cases of high risk NHL, the only potentially curative option is stem cell transplantation. Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) is based on using radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies against tumoral antigens. Since lymphoma cells are sensitive to radiation, RIT has become a potential approach in treating NHL. In this review, we have discussed the efficacy and safety of RIT as an alternative conditioning regimen prior to ASCT.
The aim of this study was to analyze the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumetric and morphometric characteristics of the infrapatellar fat pad (IFP) and the suprapatellar fat pad (SFP) in normal controls, moderate and end-stage osteoarthritis (OA) patients. Forty-four MRI images of the three groups were collected: a) 17 patients undergoing meniscectomy with Outerbridge score 0 (control group); b) 15 patients undergoing meniscectomy with Outerbridge score 3/4 (moderate OA group); and c) 12 patients undergoing total knee replacement (end-stage OA group). Volume, depth, femoral and tibial arch lengths of IFP were quantified. The hypointense IFP signals were also scored. The SFP volume, oblique, antero-posterior and cranio-caudal lengths were determined. IFP and SFP characteristics were compared between groups. A decrease of IFP volume, depth, femoral, and tibial arch lengths in moderate and end-stage OA compared to controls were observed. A difference in IFP hypointense signal was found between groups. No differences were found in SFP characteristics between the groups. In controls and moderate OA patients, correlations were found among the different MRI characteristics of both IFP and SFP, while in the end-stage OA group correlations were found only in SFP. We evidenced differences of the IFP MRI morphometric characteristics between the groups analyzed, supporting an important role of IFP in OA pathology and progression. On the contrary, no differences were highlighted in SFP analysis suggesting that this fat pad is not clearly involved in OA, probably due to its peculiar localization and different function.
To investigate the natural history of dark adaptation (DA) function as measured by the change in rod intercept time (RIT) over 4 years and to correlate RIT change with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) severity.
Longitudinal, single-center, observational study.
A total of 77 participants aged ≥50 years with a range of AMD severities.
Participants each contributing a single study eye to the analysis were assigned into person-based AMD severity groups based on fundus characteristics (drusen, pigmentary changes, late AMD, and subretinal drusenoid deposits [SDDs]). The DA function was assessed in study eyes at baseline and 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 months. Mean change in DA function over time was calculated using the slope of linear regression fits of longitudinal RIT data. Patient-reported responses on a Low Luminance Questionnaire (LLQ) were obtained at baseline and yearly. Nonparametric statistical testing was performed on all comparisons.
The RIT, defined as the time taken after a photobleach for visual sensitivity to recover detection of a 5×10-3 cd/m2 stimulus (a decrease of 3 log units), was monitored in study eyes over 4 years, and the mean rate of change was computed.
Longitudinal analysis of 65 study eyes followed on the standard testing protocol (mean age, 71±9.3 years; 49% were female) revealed that higher rates of RIT prolongation were correlated with AMD severity group assignment at baseline (P = 0.026) and with severity group assignments at year 4 (P = 0.0011). Study eyes that developed SDD during follow-up demonstrated higher rates of RIT prolongation relative to those that did not (P &lt; 0.0001). Overall, higher rates of RIT prolongation were significantly correlated with greater 4-year decreases in LLQ scores (total mean score, P = 0.0032).
Longitudinal decline in DA function, which correlated with patient-reported functional deficits, was accelerated in eyes with greater AMD severity and especially in eyes with SDD both at baseline and at 4 years. The RIT prolongation as a measure of changing DA function may be a functional outcome measure in AMD clinical studies.
We present a formalism for two-dimensional (2D) noise reconstruction in proton computed tomography (pCT). This is necessary for the application of fluence modulated pCT (FMpCT) since it permits image noise prescription and the corresponding proton fuence optimization. We aimed at extending previously published formalisms to account for the impact of multiple Coulomb scattering (MCS) on projection noise, and the use of filtered back projection (FBP) reconstruction along curved paths with distance driven binning (DDB). 2D noise reconstruction for a beam of protons with parallel initial momentum vectors, and for projections binned both at the rear tracker and with DDB, was established. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of pCT scans of a water cylinder were employed to generate pCT projections and to calculate their noise for use in 2D noise reconstruction. These were compared to results from an analytical model accounting for MCS for rear tracker binning as well as against the previously published central pixel model which ignores MCS. Image noise reconstructed with the formalism for rear tracker binning and DDB were compared to MC results using annular regions of interest (ROIs). Agreement better than 8% was obtained between the noise of projections calculated with MC simulation and our model. Noise from annular ROIs agreed with our noise reconstructions for rear tracker binning and DDB. The central pixel model ignoring MCS underestimated projection and thus image noise by up to 40% towards the object's edge. The use of DDB decreased the image noise towards the object's edge when compared to rear tracker binning and yielded more uniform noise throughout the image. MCS should not be neglected when predicting image noise for pixels away from the center of an object in a pCT scan due to the increasing influence of the gradient of the object's hull closer to the edges.
The poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer requires the development of more effective therapy. CD147 expresses in pancreatic cancer with high incidence and has a crucial role in invasion and metastasis. We developed a fully human monoclonal antibody (059-053) with high affinity for CD147. Here we evaluated the efficacy of combined treatment using radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with 90Y-labeled 059-053 and gemcitabine in a BxPC-3 xenograft mouse model. Expression of CD147 and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) in BxPC-3 tumors was evaluated. In vitro and in vivo properties of 059-053 were evaluated using 111In-labeled 059-053 and a pancreatic cancer model BxPC-3. Tumor volume and body weight were periodically measured in mice receiving gemcitabine, RIT, and both RIT and gemcitabine (one cycle and two cycles). High expression of CD147 and MMP2 was observed in BxPC-3 tumors and suppressed by 059-053 injection. Radiolabeled 059-053 bound specifically to BxPC-3 cells and accumulated highly in BxPC-3 tumors but low in major organs. Combined treatment using RIT with gemcitabine (one cycle) significantly suppressed tumor growth and prolonged survival with tolerable toxicity. The two-cycle regimen had the highest anti-tumor effect, but was not tolerable. Combined treatment with 90Y-labeled 059-053 and gemcitabine is a promising therapeutic option for pancreatic cancer.
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a B-cell malignancy that is incurable for the majority of patients. New treatments are urgently needed. Recombinant immunotoxins (RITs) are chimeric proteins that are composed of the Fv or Fab portion of an antibody fused to a bacterial toxin. B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is a lineage-restricted differentiation protein and an ideal target for antibody-based treatments for MM.
RITs were produced by expressing plasmids encoding the components of the anti-BCMA RITs in Escherichia coli followed by inclusion body preparation, solubilization, renaturation, and purification by column chromatography. The cytotoxic activity of RITs was tested in vitro by WST-8 assays. We also measured their binding to human and mouse serum albumins and to BCMA and measured their serum half-life in mice.
Using Fvs from different anti-BCMA antibodies, we produced RITs that specifically kill BCMA-expressing MM cells in vitro. To increase the serum half-life in vivo, we generated RITs that are fused with albumin-binding domains (ABDs). All RITs with ABDs have some decreased activity compared to the parent RIT, which is not due to decreased binding to BCMA.
Various new anti-BCMA immunotoxins were produced and evaluated. None of these were better than LMB-75 (anti-BCMA BM306-disulfide-stabilized Fv-LRggs) supporting the further preclinical development of LMB-75.
Protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs) are currently tested in clinical studies (phase I-III) as an alternative strategy against (recurrent) ovarian cancer. Besides their anti-tumour efficacy, several PKIs have also shown radiosensitizing effects when combined with external beam radiation. Based on these results we asked if the addition of PKIs offers a therapeutic opportunity to improve radioimmunotherapy (RIT) against ovarian cancer. Five PKIs (alisertib, MK1775, MK2206, saracatinib, temsirolimus) were chosen for cytotoxicity screenings based on their current clinical trials in the treatment of ovarian cancer and their influence on cell cycle regulation and DNA damage repair pathways. We combined selected PKIs with 177Lu-labelled anti-L1CAM monoclonal antibody chCE7 for our investigations.
PKIs cytotoxicity was determined via cell colony-forming assays. Biomarker of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs, γH2A.X) was analysed by western blot and fluorescence microscopy. Flow cytometric measurements were performed to evaluate levels of apoptosis based on mono- or combination treatments. The best combination was used for in vivo combination therapy studies in nude mice with SKOV3ip and IGROV1 human ovarian cancer xenografts. Bonferroni correction was used to determine statistical significance for multiple comparisons.
The highest cytotoxicity against both cell lines was observed for MK1775 and alisertib. Combinations including 177Lu-labelled mAb chCE7 and MK1775 decreased 177Lu-DOTA-chCE7 IC60-values 14-fold, compared to 6-fold, when the radioimmunoconjugate was combined with alisertib. The most effective PKI MK1775 was further evaluated and demonstrated synergistic effects in combination with 177Lu-DOTA-chCE7 against IGROV1 cells. Significantly higher amounts of DSBs were detected in IGROV1 cells after combination (91%) compared to either treatment alone (MK1775: 52%; radioimmunoconjugate: 72%; p &lt; 0.0125). Early-apoptosis was significantly enhanced in IGROV1 cells correlating with induced DSBs (177Lu-DOTA-chCE7: 8%, MK1775: 28%, 177Lu-DOTA-chCE7 + MK1775: 40%, p &lt; 0.0125). Immunohistochemistry analysis of γH2A.X expression levels after therapy in SKOV3ip xenografts revealed a high sensitivity of the tumour cells to MK1775 and a high radioresistance. A prominent effect of tumour growth inhibition of the RIT and of the combination therapy was observed in vivo in a late stage IGROV1 xenograft model.
Our results warrant further evaluation of combination of MK1775 and radioimmunotherapy.
We investigated the ability of North American river otters (Lontra canadensis) to visually discriminate between 2D objects. The otters learned to discriminate between stimuli using multiple visual features and then were tested with stimuli in which one of the features was eliminated (color or shape). Two adult otters were trained in a two-alternative forced choice task to discriminate between a red circle and a blue triangle. Test sessions included probe trials containing novel shapes, colors, or shape-color combinations. Both otters successfully learned to discriminate between stimuli varying in multiple features. One of the otters was able to successfully discriminate between novel test stimuli when either color or shape were eliminated as salient features. This study was the first to explore the ability of L. canadensis to use different visual features to recognize objects and provides some preliminary evidence for color vision in this species. This research adds to the sparse literature on perceptual and cognitive capabilities in otters and can be used to support future conservation efforts for this species.
Antiretroviral (ART) drugs has previously been associated with lipodystrophic syndrome, metabolic consequences, and neuropsychiatric complications. ART drugs include three main classes of protease inhibitors (PIs), nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Our previous work demonstrated that a high risk of hyperlipidemia was observed in HIV-1-infected patients who received ART drugs in Taiwan. Patients receiving ART drugs containing either Abacavir/Lamivudine (Aba/Lam; NRTI/NRTI), Lamivudine/Zidovudine (Lam/Zido; NRTI/NRTI), or Lopinavir/Ritonavir (Lop/Rit; PI) have the highest risk of hyperlipidemia. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Aba/Lam (NRTI/NRTI), Lam/Zido (NRTI/NRTI), and Lop/Rit (PI) on metabolic and neurologic functions in mice. Groups of C57BL/6 mice were administered Aba/Lam, Lam/Zido, or Lop/Rit, orally, once daily for a period of 4 weeks. The mice were then extensively tested for metabolic and neurologic parameters. In addition, the effect of Aba/Lam, Lam/Zido, and Lop/Rit on lipid metabolism was assessed in HepG2 hepatocytes and during the 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation. Administration with Aba/Lam caused cognitive and motor impairments in mice, as well as their metabolic imbalances, including alterations in leptin serum levels. Administration with Lop/Rit also caused cognitive and motor impairments in mice, as well as their metabolic imbalances, including alterations in serum levels of total cholesterol, and HDL-c. Treatment of mice with Aba/Lam and Lop/Rit enhanced the lipid accumulation in the liver, and the decrease in AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and/or its downstream target acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) protein expression. In HepG2 hepatocytes, Aba/Lam, Lam/Zido, and Lop/Rit also enhanced the lipid accumulation and decreased phosphorylated AMPK and ACC proteins. In 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte differentiation, Aba/Lam and Lop/Rit reduced adipogenesis by decreasing expression of transcription factor CEBPb, implicating the lipodystrophic syndrome. Our results demonstrate that daily oral administration of Aba/Lam and Lop/Rit may produce cognitive, motor, and metabolic impairments in mice, regardless of HIV-1 infection.
Cartilage lesions fail to heal spontaneously, leading to the development of chronic conditions which worsen the life quality of patients. Three-dimensional scaffold-based bioprinting holds the potential of tissue regeneration through the creation of organized, living constructs via a "layer-by-layer" deposition of small units of biomaterials and cells. This technique displays important advantages to mimic natural cartilage over traditional methods by allowing a fine control of cell distribution, and the modulation of mechanical and chemical properties. This opens up a number of new perspectives including personalized medicine through the development of complex structures (the osteochondral compartment), different types of cartilage (hyaline, fibrous), and constructs according to a specific patient's needs. However, the choice of the ideal combination of biomaterials and cells for cartilage bioprinting is still a challenge. Stem cells may improve material mimicry ability thanks to their unique properties: the immune-privileged status and the paracrine activity. Here, we review the recent advances in cartilage three-dimensional, scaffold-based bioprinting using stem cells and identify future developments for clinical translation. Database search terms used to write this review were: "articular cartilage", "menisci", "3D bioprinting", "bioinks", "stem cells", and "cartilage tissue engineering".
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a valuable tool for ameliorating drug resistant pathologies such as movement disorders and epilepsy. DBS is also being considered for complex neuro-psychiatric disorders, which are characterized by high variability in symptoms and slow responses that hinder DBS setting optimization. The objective of this work was to develop an in silico platform to examine the effects of electrical stimulation in regions neighboring a stimulated brain region.
We used the Jansen-Rit neural mass model of single and coupled nodes to simulate the response to a train of electrical current pulses at different frequencies (10-160 Hz) of the local field potential recorded in the amygdala and cortical structures in human subjects and a non-human primate.
We found that using a single node model, the evoked responses could be accurately modeled following a narrow range of stimulation frequencies. Including a second coupled node increased the range of stimulation frequencies whose evoked responses could be efficiently modeled. Furthermore, in a chronic recording from a non-human primate, features of the in vivo evoked response remained consistent for several weeks, suggesting that model re-parameterization for chronic stimulation protocols would be infrequent.
Using a model of neural population activity, we reproduced the evoked response to cortical and subcortical stimulation in human and non-human primate. This modeling framework provides an environment to explore, safely and rapidly, a wide range of stimulation settings not possible in human brain stimulation studies. The model can be trained on a limited dataset of stimulation responses to develop an optimal stimulation strategy for an individual patient.
The World Health Organization recommends that systematic testing and screening of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) among the incarcerated population "should be considered", though based on evidence of either low or very low quality. However, in Japan, a TB middle-burden country, systematic screening for LTBI in correctional facilities is currently not conducted. As part of a larger study to determine the cost-effectiveness of LTBI screening in correctional facilities in Japan, this study was conducted to determine the situation of LTBI, including treatment outcome, among the incarcerated population in Japan, and provide the essential data for cost-effectiveness analysis.
A cross-sectional study was conducted between 2017 and 2018 with public health centers which have one or more correctional facilities under their jurisdiction. Questionnaire surveys were sent to collect information on their policy of managing LTBI patients notified from correctional facilities, including whether or not there was a standardized procedure for initiating LTBI treatment, and also to collect sociodemographic information and treatment outcome of LTBI patients who were notified from the respective correctional facilities in 2015 and 2016.
The survey was sent to a total of 163 public health centers, out of which 133 (81.6%) responded. 8 of the 133 public health centers actively guided the correctional facilities regarding LTBI treatment initiation through a standardized procedure, while 115 either had not established such procedure or were unaware of how LTBI treatment was being initiated in the correctional facilities. A total of 91 LTBI patients were notified from the correctional facilities in 2015 and 2016, and the information of 89 were available for analysis. 82 were males, and 83 were Japan-born. Treatment outcome was known for 88 patients, of which 70 had completed treatment. Of the 18 who did not complete the treatment, 15 had been lost to follow-up upon release from the facilities. Among those who had been released whilst on treatment, the proportion of those who completed the treatment was higher in those patients who received pre-release visit by a public health nurse, than those who did not.
LTBI treatment was often being initiated without consideration for the patients' prison term. The treatment completion rate within jail was high, indicating the possibility that incarcerated population can benefit for LTBI treatment. On the other hand, the completion rate decreased significantly among those who had been released while still on treatment. In order to optimize the benefit, initiation of LTBI must carefully be considered upon the patient's prison term, as well as coordination among the relevant organizations to ensure continuity of care after release.
We studied whether bendamustine (BENDA) alone or with rituximab (RIT) modifies in vitro expression of apoptosis-involved genes and proteins of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells depending on IGVH mutational status. Circulating lymphocytes from 34 untreated patients (18 IGVH-MUT and 16 IGVH-UNMUT) were incubated with above drugs to evaluate proteins expression. Microarray analysis of 93 genes was performed in 14 patients. BENDA and BENDA + RIT increased expression of BAX and BBC3 in IGVH-MUT and IGVH-UNMUT groups, and significant differences in expression of above genes after BENDA + RIT were observed between both groups. Additionally, BENDA + RIT decreased NFκB and BCL-2 genes in IGVH-UNMUT patients and increased expression of P53, BAX and PUMA proteins in IGVH-MUT and UNMUT subjects. However, no significant differences were found between these groups. In conclusion, BENDA + RIT modified gene expression profile in CLL cells and affected expression of some apoptosis-regulating proteins in vitro. Expression of BAX and BBC3 depends on action of drugs and IGVH mutational status.
The interest in wearable systems among the biomedical engineering and clinical community continues to escalate as technical refinements enhance their potential use for both indoor and outdoor applications. For example, an important wearable technology known as a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) is demonstrating promising applications in the area of biomedical engineering. Accordingly, this study was designed to investigate the Sharif-Human Movement Instrumentation System (SHARIF-HMIS), consisting of inertial measurement units (IMUs), stretchable clothing, and a data logger-all of which can be used outside the controlled environment of a laboratory, thus enhancing its overall utility. This system is lightweight, portable, able to be deliver data for almost 10 h, and features a new data-fusion algorithm using the Kalman filter with an adaptive approach. In specific terms, the data from the system's gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer sensors can be combined to estimate total-body orientation; additionally, the noise level of these sensors can be changed to accommodate faster motions as well as magnetic disturbances. These variations can be incorporated within the extended Kalman filter by changing the parameters of the filter adaptively. In specific terms, the system's interface was developed to acquire data from eighteen IMUs located on the body to collect kinematic data associated with human motion. Meanwhile, a validation test involving one subject performing different shoulder motions was designed to compare data captured by SHARIF-HMIS and the VICON motion-capture system. This validation test demonstrated correlation values of &gt;0.9. Results also confirmed that the output accuracy of the new system's sensor was &lt;0.55, 1.5 and 3.5° for roll, pitch, and yaw directions, respectively. In summary, SHARIF-HMIS successfully collected kinematic data for specific human movements, which has promising implications for a range of sporting, biomedical, and healthcare-related applications.

Years of clinical trials have proven the maturity and safety of certain treatments, however, some of these mature treatments may not be highly effective. Several treatments have emerged through technological innovations, but their long-term safety, efficacy, and adverse effects remain unknown. At present, many patients seek information related to their treatments on the Internet, which may impact their attitudes towards different treatments and their trust in physicians. In this study, a research model was developed to examine how patients' trust in their physicians is influenced by related online information on mature or emerging treatments. The hypotheses were tested using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modelling (SEM). A total of 336 valid responses were collected through an online survey. Mature treatments related health information was found to significantly improve patients' trust. Thus, physicians should pay more attention to mature treatments, and encourage their patients to seek related information online. Moreover, the quality of online information should be developed further to increase patients' satisfaction. Physicians should also consider their patients' psychological safety in communication with patients to strengthen their trust.
This study compared the effectiveness of regenerative injection therapy (RIT), i.e. prolotherapy, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in the treatment of fibromyalgia syndrome.
This study included 120 female, age-matched fibromyalgia patients. All patients underwent a clinical examination, pain assessment by VAS, assessment of tender points, psychiatric and functional assessment using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire Revised (RFIQ), and measurement of cortical auditory evoked potentials CAEPs elicited at 1000 Hz. Patients were divided into two equal groups; Group 1 received prolotherapy three times, two weeks apart, and Group 2 received rTMS sessions every other day for one month. Assessment was performed before treatment, immediately after treatment, and one month later.
A significant improvement of pain measured by the mean score of VAS was remarked in Group 1 compared to Group 2 immediately after treatment and one month later. There was statistically significant difference of mean scores for the number of tender points in Group 1 compared to Group 2 after treatment and one month later. The patients improved functionally, with a statistically significant difference in mean score of RFIQ, in Group 1 compared to Group 2 one month after treatment. However, there was a significant difference in mean score of BDI in Group 2 compared to Group 1 after treatment and one month later. Further, CAEPs showed better improvement, with a significant difference in Group 2, one month after treatment.
RIT had the advantage in clinical and functional improvement in fibromyalgia patients, while rTMS had better results regarding depression and the cortical component of AEPs. These results might draw attention to the evaluability of a combination of both techniques for a better therapeutic response.
Galectins are members of the animal lectin family that bind to the β-galactoside-containing carbohydrate moieties of glycoconjugates. They seem to have an important role in the pathophysiology of several diseases, including arthritis. Osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are chronic conditions with few or no available therapies. In this context, galectins could provide a novel opportunity, but the precise role and mechanism of their involvement in arthritis are still not fully understood. This descriptive systematic literature review summarizes in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies that analyzed and examined the role and mechanism of action of galectins in arthritis to highlight and clarify their possible translation implication. This review yielded promising evidence that individual galectins, in particular galectin-1, -3, and -9, could play positive or negative roles in the pathogenesis of arthritis, especially in RA and OA. It also emphasized the cell-dependent role of these galectins. This is particularly true for galectin-1, which was shown to have a protective anti-inflammatory role in RA, while it seemed to be associated with cartilage degeneration in OA. In summary, this review underlined that manipulation of certain galectins can suppress or aggravate disease symptoms in arthritis animal models, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of galectins for the treatment of RA and OA. Nevertheless, despite the fact that galectin therapy and therapies acting on galectin expression seem to be an interesting and important opportunity for research, we highlighted that further investigation is necessary to carefully evaluate their potential clinical implications in arthritis.
In the past several decades, many antimicrobial agents have been used in treating different fungal, bacterial, and viral infections. However, these agents have faced challenges such as pronounced side-effect profiles and pathogen resistance. In addition, a cure for many chronic infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has not been achieved, and the incidence of opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients has increased significantly in the past decades. Therefore, an alternative strategy for combating these infections is needed. Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) has been proposed to be a valuable tool in the management of such infections. The side-effects associated with RIT are minimal as the targeted antigens are only expressed on microbial or infected cells. RIT demonstrated impressive potency in eradicating pathogens in animal models and patient samples. Cryptococcus neoformans, HIV, and Bacillus anthracis are few examples of infections for which RIT has been an effective treatment using radionuclides such as bismuth-213 (213Bi) or rhenium-188 (188Re).
To walk through the cluttered natural environment requires visually guided and anticipatory adjustments to gait in advance of upcoming obstacles. However, scientific investigation of visual contributions to obstacle crossing have historically been limited by the practical issues involved with the repeated presentation of multiple obstacles upon a ground plane. This study evaluates an approach in which the perception of a 3D obstacle is generated from 2D projection onto the ground plane with perspective correction based on the subject's motion-tracked head position. The perception of depth is further reinforced with the use of stereoscopic goggles. To evaluate the validity of this approach, behavior was compared between approaches to two types of obstacles in a blocked design: physical obstacles, and the augmented reality (AR) obstacles projected upon the ground plane. In addition, obstacle height, defined in units of leg length (LL), was varied on each trial (0.15, 0.25, 0.35 LL). Approaches to ended with collision on 0.8% of trials with physical obstacles per subject, and on 1.4% trials with AR obstacles. Collisions were signaled by auditory feedback. Linear changes in the height of both AR and physical obstacles produced linear changes in maximum step height, preserving a constant clearance magnitude across changes in obstacle height. However, for AR obstacles, approach speed was slower, the crossing step peaked higher above the obstacle, and there was greater clearance between the lead toe and the obstacle. These results suggest that subjects were more cautious when approaching and stepping over AR obstacles.
Xerostomia following radioiodine therapy (RIT) in patients suffering from differentiated thyroid cancer is a common side effect in 2 % to 67 % of patients treated with radioiodine (I-131). In order to evaluate the impact of sialendoscopy on health related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients suffering from therapy induced sialadenitis and xerostomia, we analyzed findings from two dedicated questionnaires (Xerostomy Questionnaire XQ and Xerostomy Inventory XI) in patients before and three months after sialendoscopy.
In total, 12 patients suffering from differentiated thyroid carcinoma (10 women and 2 men) were evaluated. All patients had experienced conservative management. Patients were offered a sialendoscopy procedure if no major contradictions were present. Patients who denied the procedure formed the control group. Pre- and (three months) postoperative HRQOL was measured with the Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROM) Xerostomia Questionnaire (XQ) and the Xerostomia Inventory (XI), as well as by a pre- and post-interventional salivary gland scintigram. Patients were graded according to their sialendoscopical findings.
Interventional group presented with significant improvements in HRQOL measurements regarding XQ and XI-scores three months postoperatively. Control group showed no significant changes in the XQ or the XI scores. Number of RIT and cumulative activity of I-131 did not correlate with higher disease grade in regards to sialendoscopical findings nor did it correlate with higher XQand XI scores. Pre- and post-interventional salivary gland scintigram stated that parotid glands are more severely damaged than submandibular glands (SMG), but no significant scintigraphically changes could be detected after sialendoscopy.
Sialendoscopy in patients suffering from therapy induced sialadenitis and xerostomia seems to be beneficial when evaluating the impact on HRQOL. Functional parameters measured by salivary gland scintigram did not show significant changes in post-interventional scintigrams.
EINFüHRUNG:: Xerostomie nach Radiojodtherapie (RIT) bei Patienten mit differenziertem Schilddrüsenkrebs ist eine häufige Nebenwirkung bei 2 % bis 67 % der mit Radioiod behandelten Patienten (I-131). Um die Auswirkungen der Sialendoskopie auf die gesundheitsbezogene Lebensqualität (HRQOL) bei Patienten mit therapiebedingter Sialadenitis und Xerostomie zu untersuchen, wurden die Ergebnisse von zwei Fragebögen (Xerostomie Fragebogen XQ und Xerostomie Inventar XI) bei Patienten vor und nach drei Monate nach Sialendoskopie analysiert.
Insgesamt wurden 12 Patienten mit differenziertem Schilddrüsenkarzinom (10 Frauen und 2 Männer) untersucht. Alle Patienten hatten eine konservative Behandlung erfahren. Den Patienten wurde eine Sialendoskopie angeboten, wenn keine Kontraindikationen vorlagen. Patienten, die das Verfahren ablehnten, bildeten die Kontrollgruppe. Die prä- und dreimonatige postoperative HRQOL wurden mittels der XI- und XQ-Fragebögen ermittelt, sowie anhand eines prä- und post-interventionellen Speicheldrüsenszintigramms gemessen. Die Patienten wurden gemäß ihrer sialendoskopischen Befunde eingestuft.
Die Interventionsgruppe zeigte drei Monate postoperativ signifikante Verbesserungen der HRQOL-Messungen bezüglich der XQ und XI-Scores. Die Kontrollgruppe zeigte keine signifikanten Veränderungen in den XQoder XI-Werten. Die Anzahl der RIT und die kumulative Aktivität von I-131 korrelierte weder mit einem höheren Grad der Erkrankung in Bezug auf sialendoskopische Befunde, noch korrelierte sie mit höheren XQ- und XI-Werten. Prä- und postinterventionelle Speicheldrüsenszintigramme zeigten, dass die Parotisdrüsen stärker geschädigt sind als die Submandibulardrüsen (SMG), nach der Sialendoskopie jedoch keine signifikanten szintigraphischen Verbesserungen nachweisbar sind.
Die Sialendoskopie bei Patienten mit therapiebedingter Sialadenitis und Xerostomie scheint einen positiven Einfluss auf die HRQOL zu haben. Funktionelle Parameter, wie sie in der Speicheldrüsen-Szintigraphie gemessen werden, zeigten jedoch post-interventionell keine signifikanten Verbesserungen.
The titer of live attenuated viral vaccines, such as MMR vaccines, varies between batches and over the shelf-life of a batch, with the highest titer expected at batch release. As higher titers may theoretically lead to increased reactogenicity, we compared the safety profile of an upper-range release titer MMR-RIT lot with commercial MMR II lots in a phase III, randomized, controlled study (NCT02184572). We vaccinated 1736 children with MMR-RIT (N = 1164) or MMR II (N = 572), both administered as first doses with varicella, hepatitis A, and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines at 12-15 months of age. The incidence of fever 5-12 days post-vaccination was comparable following MMR-RIT and MMR II vaccination: 4.2% vs 3.1% (difference: 1.1%) for fever &gt; 39.0°C and 18.2% vs 17.1% (difference: 1.1%) for fever ≥ 38.0°C, which met the primary objective. Two cases of febrile convulsions (one considered vaccination-related) were reported within 43 days post-MMR-RIT. During Days 0-42, rashes were reported for 24.4% (MMR-RIT) and 27.4% (MMR II) of children; measles/rubella-like rashes for 5.8% and 4.7%, respectively. Measles-like illnesses were reported for 1.5% (MMR-RIT) and 0.9% (MMR II) of children 5-12 days post-vaccination. One serious adverse event, immune thrombocytopenic purpura following MMR II vaccination, was considered vaccination-related. Immune responses were similar in both groups. In summary, the safety profile of an upper-range release titer MMR-RIT lot was in line with that of commercial MMR II lots, with similar rates of fever and other MMR-specific symptoms and low rates of measles-like illnesses reported with both vaccines.
The purpose of this case report is to present success and failure outcomes of seven-year follow-up of resin infiltration treatment (RIT) used for the proximal caries of maxillary premolars. Although resin infiltration can be a good option for micro-invasive treatment, long-term follow-up data are not sufficient, and the outcome of this technique can be affected by factors such as technique sensitivity of procedure, patient's caries risk, and depth of caries progression. Therefore, careful case selection, application, and follow-up are needed.
Though the modern medical imaging research is advancing at a booming rate, it is still a very challenging task to detect brain tumor perfectly. Medical imaging unlike other imaging system has highest penalty for a minimal error. So, the detection of tumor should be accurate to minimize the error. Past researchers used biopsy to detect the tumor tissue from the other soft tissues in the brain which is time-consuming and may have errors. We outlined a two-stage verification-based tumor segmentation that makes the detection more accurate. We segmented the tumor area from the MR image and then used another algorithm to match the segmented portion with the ground truth image. We named this new algorithm as watershed-matching algorithm. The most promising part of our model is the status checking of the tumor by finding the area of the tumor. Our proposed model works better than other state-of-the art works on BRATS 2017 dataset.
The primary aim was to determine optimal test conditions for evaluating dark adaptation in intermediate age-related macular degeneration (iAMD) in order to minimize test time while maintaining diagnostic sensitivity.
People with AMD and age-similar controls were recruited (aged &gt;55 years). Rod intercept time (RIT) was assessed after a 76%, 70%, and 65% rhodopsin bleach at 5° eccentricity and 76% and 70% bleach at 12°. Test order was randomized and a 30-minute washout period added between tests. Results were compared between control and iAMD groups and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were constructed.
A total of 26 participants with variable grades of macular health attended for two visits. There was a statistically significant difference in average RIT between the control and iAMD groups at 5° (median, IQR controls = 5.8 minutes, 3.8-7.5; iAMD = 20.6 minutes, 11.1-30.0; Mann-Whitney, P = 0.01) and at 12° (mean, controls: 4.54 minutes ± 2.12 SD, iAMD = 7.72 minutes ± 3.37 SD; independent samples t-test, P = 0.03) following a 76% bleach. Area under the ROC curves was 0.83 (confidence interval [CI]: 0.64-1.0) and 0.79 (CI: 0.59-0.99) for these two test conditions, respectively. Five participants (45%) in the iAMD group had RITs &gt;20 minutes for 76% bleach at 5°, but none for any other test condition.
Nearly half of the participants with iAMD produced unacceptably long recovery times (&gt;20 minutes) using a 76% bleach at 5° eccentricity. The 76% bleach at 12° provided almost equivalent separation between AMD and controls but recovery was achieved within 20 minutes.
The potency of live viral vaccines decreases over time. We compared the immunogenicity and safety of GSK measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR-RIT) formulations at two different potencies with that of the commercially-available MMR II formulation.
In this phase III observer-blind clinical study (NCT01681992), 4516 healthy children aged 12-15 months were randomized (1:1:1 ratio) to receive one dose of MMR-RIT at the minimum potency used for this study (MMR-RIT-Min) or MMR-RIT at the second lowest potency used for this study (MMR-RIT-Med), or control MMR II vaccine. A second dose (MMR-RIT or MMR II) was administered 42 days after the first. The study had 10 co-primary objectives to evaluate MMR-RIT versus MMR II immunogenicity via a hierarchical procedure. Anti-measles and anti-rubella antibodies were measured by ELISA and anti-mumps antibodies by ELISA and unenhanced plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT).
Each formulation induced immune responses to all vaccine antigens after each MMR dose. While the primary objectives for MMR-RIT-Min were not met, MMR-RIT-Med induced immune responses as measured by ELISA against the three vaccine antigens that met pre-specified non-inferiority criteria. The immune response following MMR-RIT-Med against mumps measured by PRNT failed the non-inferiority criterion for seroresponse rate: the 97.5% confidence interval lower limit (-10.94%) was beyond the pre-defined limit of -10%. Immune responses were comparable among groups post-dose 2. No safety concerns were identified, and MMR-RIT and MMR II vaccines had similar reactogenicity and safety profiles.
One dose of MMR-RIT formulation with lower potency (MMR-RIT-Med) induced a non-inferior immune response compared to commercial MMR II vaccine, measured by ELISA in one-year-old children. Non-inferiority was not demonstrated in terms of immune response against mumps virus measured by unenhanced PRNT, although the difference was of uncertain clinical relevance. After the second dose, immune responses were comparable among the MMR-RIT and MMR II groups.
Extreme weather events often disrupt the operation of public transit systems, and challenge the capacity of transit agencies to effectively respond to them. In this paper, we draw upon a recent nationwide survey of 273 public transit agencies in metropolitan regions across the United States to understand the factors that influence their scope of adaptation to anticipated climate risks. We find that a transit agency undertakes more adaptation measures when transit officials perceive greater risks and greater adaptive capacity of the agency, or when it experiences more severe extreme weather events. We also show that local institutional environment, in particular, political ideology, affects the scope of transit adaptation activities. Transit agencies that operate in more politically liberal counties tend to engage in more adaptation actions, while the effect of state-level ideology depends on the level of perceived influence from state governments.
With the aid of a transformable sulfoximine directing group, unprecedented one-pot unsymmetrical double annulations {[4 + 2] and [4 + 2]} of hetero(arenes) with alkynes are revealed under Ru(II) catalysis. Functionalization of both ortho-C-H bonds of (hetero)arene is reflected in the building of unusual 6,6-fused pyranoisoquinoline skeletons. Construction of four [(C-C)-(C-N) and (C-C)-(C-O)] bonds occurs in one step under single catalytic conditions. The challenging unsymmetrical double annulations of both o-C-H bonds of arenes with two distinct alkynes is effectively demonstrated. Control experiments and deuterium scrambling findings are shown.
Use and co-use of tobacco and marijuana during pregnancy are associated with the development of social, cognitive, and behavioral problems for infants and children. However, less is known about the potential developmental impact of the use of tobacco and marijuana in tandem. The present study examined an etiological model for the development of externalizing behavior problems (EBP) in early childhood in a high risk sample (N = 247) of mother-infant dyads with prospective data from pregnancy to 36 months of child age. Co-use during pregnancy and continued maternal tobacco and marijuana use from infancy through early childhood were investigated. Although direct pathways from exposure during pregnancy to EBP were not significant, there was a significant indirect pathway from prenatal tobacco use to EBP via lower breastfeeding duration to lower maternal warmth/sensitivity to EBP, and a pathway from higher maternal affective dysregulation to higher EBP. These results highlight the importance of considering cascading effects of substance use during pregnancy on parental processes within the context of developmental risk and protection.
Proton transmission imaging has been proposed and investigated as imaging modality complementary to x-ray based techniques in proton beam therapy. In particular, it addresses the issue of range uncertainties due to the conversion of an x-ray patient computed tomography (CT) image expressed in Hounsfield Units (HU) to relative stopping power (RSP) needed as input to the treatment planning system. One approach to exploit a single proton radiographic projection is to perform a patient-specific calibration of the CT to RSP conversion curve by optimising the match between a measured and a numerically integrated proton radiography. In this work, we develop the mathematical tools needed to perform such an optimisation in an efficient and robust way. Our main focus lies on set-ups which combine pencil beam scanning with a range telescope detector, although most of our methods can be employed in combination with other set-ups as well. Proton radiographies are simulated in Monte Carlo using an idealised detector and applying the same data processing chain used with experimental data. This approach allows us to have a ground truth CT-RSP curve to compare the optimisation results with. Our results show that the parameters of the CT-RSP curve are strongly correlated when using a pencil beam based set-up, which leads to unrealistic variation in the optimised CT-RSP curves. To address this issue, we introduce a regularisation procedure which guarantees a plausible degree of smoothness in the optimised CT-RSP curves. We investigate three different methods to perform the numerical projection operation needed to generate a proton digitally reconstructed radiography. We find that the approximate and computationally faster method performs as well as the more accurate but more demanding method. We perform a Monte Carlo experiment based on a head and neck patient to evaluate the range accuracy achievable with the optimised CT-RSP curves and find an agreement with the ground truth expectation of better than [Formula: see text]. Our results further indicate that the region in the patient in which the proton radiography is acquired does not necessarily have to correspond to the treatment volume to achieve this accuracy. This is important as the imaged region could be freely chosen, e.g. in order to spare organs at risk.
Background and study aims  Colonoscopy can be technically challenging and cause discomfort in patients. The integrated Scope Guide assist is built in to show that with its use outcomes are improved during colonoscopy. We aimed to test the usefulness of the Magnetic Scope Guide Assist (ScopeGuide ) with respect to cecal intubation time, and other procedural quality outcomes. Patients and methods  We conducted a prospective study of outpatients undergoing elective colonoscopy at the endoscopic units of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) from March 2016 to July 2016. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 block design to groups that either had standard colonoscopy or Scope-guided colonoscopy. The primary outcome measure was cecal intubation time (CIT). Secondary outcome measures included use of manual pressure, position changes for cecal intubation and sedation requirements. Results  Three hundred patients were randomized to either group; standard (n = 150) vs. Scope-guided (n = 150). The mean CIT was not statistically different for the standard and the Scope-guided groups (4.6 vs. 4.3 minutes; P  = 0.46). There were also no statistical differences in frequency of manual pressure applied (16.7 % for Scope-guided vs. 19.1 % for standard; P  = 0.65) or position changes (11.4 % for scope guided vs. 8.8 % standard; P  = 0.56). Sedation requirements showed lesser use of midazolam (3.9 mg vs. 4.7 mg, P  = 0.003) in the Scope-guide group, while there was no significant difference in use of fentanyl (fentanyl - 62.1 mg vs. 68.9 mg, P  = 0.09 similar between groups, for Scope-guided vs. standard groups, respectively). Adverse events were similar in both groups. Conclusions  In patients undergoing routine elective colonoscopy, use of ScopeGuide by experienced colonoscopists did not improve CIT or affect the frequency of ancillary maneuvers. The benefit of this device during training of endoscopists could be considered for further studies.
The limited tumor specific uptake of nanoparticles is one of major bottlenecks for clinical translation of nanoscale therapeutics. Herein, we propose a strategy using internal radioisotope therapy (RIT) delivered by liposomal nanoparticles to improve the tumor vasculature permeability, so as to increase the tumor specific uptake of the second-wave therapeutic nanoparticles for enhanced cancer therapies. Via a convenient method, a therapeutic radioisotope iodine-131 is labeled onto albumin-encapsulated liposomes with greatly improved radiolabeling stability compared to 131I labeled albumin. The obtained 131I-liposome with long blood half-life could accumulate in the tumor and damage tumor blood endothelial cells to improve the tumor vascular permeability. As the result, the tumor retention of the second wave of liposomal nanoparticles could be greatly increased owing to the RIT-enhanced EPR effect. In three separated experiments, we then demonstrate that such strategy could be utilized for photothermal therapy (PTT), hypoxia-activated chemotherapy (HCT) and checkpoint blockade immunotherapy, all of which could be enhanced by RIT with excellent in vivo synergistic therapeutic outcomes. Our work highlights the great promises of employing nanoparticle-mediated RIT to modulate tumor vasculature for further enhanced cancer therapy, and may have potential value for clinical translation.
The role of fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has been well established in assessment of lymphoma, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The aim of this study was to compare changes and survival predictive values of various quantification parameters of FDG-PET/CT in patients with relapsing/refractory lymphoma before and after radioimmunotherapy (RIT). Data from 17 patients with relapsing/refractory NHL, treated with targeted RIT after chemotherapy/radiotherapy, were retrospectively collected. FDG-PET/CT scans were performed approximately three months before and six months after RIT. An adaptive contrast-oriented thresholding algorithm was used to segment lesions on the FDG-PET images. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to assess changes in SUVmax, SUVmean, partial volume-corrected SUVmean (pvcSUVmean), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), and pvcTLG before and after treatment. The patients were followed up after completing RIT for up to 10 years. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses evaluated the association between the quantification parameters and survival data. In the survived group, the decrease in mean percentage of change for TLG and pvcTLG was greater than SUVmax, SUVmean and pvcSUVmean [TLG: 253.9 to 106.9, -81.4%; P = 0.052 and pvcTLG: 368.9 to 153.3, -58.4%; P = 0.04]. In addition, overall survival (OS) was shorter in patients with pre-RIT pvcTLG more than 644 compared to those below this value (log-rank P &lt; 0.01). In univariate Cox regression for OS, a higher baseline pvcTLG was a significant prognostic factor (HR: 6.8, P = 0.02). Our results showed that pre-treatment pvcTLG was the best predictor of OS in patients with relapsing/refractory NHL following RIT.
The use of a most likely path (MLP) formalism for protons to account for the effects of multiple Coulomb scattering has improved the spatial resolution in proton computed tomography (pCT). However, this formalism assumes a homogeneous medium and a continuous scattering of protons. In this paper, we quantify the path prediction error induced by transverse heterogeneities to assess whether correcting for such errors might improve the spatial resolution of pCT. To this end, we have tracked protons trajectories using Monte Carlo simulations in several phantoms with different heterogeneities. Our results show that transverse heterogeneities induce non Gaussian spatial distributions leading to errors in the prediction of the MLP, reaching 0.4 mm in a 20 cm wide simulated heterogeneity and 0.13 mm in a realistic phantom. It was also shown that when the spatial distributions have more than one peak, a most likely path, if any, has yet to be defined. Transverse heterogeneities also affect energy profiles, which could explain some of the artifacts described in other works and could make the energy cuts usually performed to exclude nuclear events less efficient.
The objective of this technical note was to investigate the accuracy of proton stopping power relative to water (RSP) estimation using a novel dual-layer, dual-energy computed tomography (DL-DECT) scanner for potential use in proton therapy planning. DL-DECT allows dual-energy reconstruction from scans acquired at a single x-ray tube voltage V by using two-layered detectors.
Sets of calibration and evaluation inserts were scanned at a DL-DECT scanner in a custom phantom with variable diameter D (0 to 150 mm) at V of 120 and 140 kV. Inserts were additionally scanned at a synchrotron computed tomography facility to obtain comparative linear attenuation coefficients for energies from 50 to 100 keV, and reference RSP was obtained using a carbon ion beam and variable water column. DL-DECT monoenergetic (mono-E) reconstructions were employed to obtain RSP by adapting the Yang-Saito-Landry (YSL) method. The method was compared to reference RSP via the root mean square error (RMSE) over insert mean values obtained from volumetric regions of interest. The accuracy of intermediate quantities such as the relative electron density (RED), effective atomic number (EAN), and the mono-E was additionally evaluated.
The lung inserts showed higher errors for all quantities and we report RMSE excluding them. RMSE for μ from DL-DECT mono-E was below 1.9%. For the evaluation inserts at D = 150 mm and V = 140 kV, RED RMSE was 1.0%, while for EAN it was 2.9%. RSP RMSE was below 0.8% for all D and V, which did not strongly affect the results.
In this investigation of RSP accuracy from DL-DECT, we have shown that RMSE below 1% can be achieved. It was possible to adapt the YSL method for DL-DECT and intermediate quantities RED and EAN had comparable accuracy to previous publications.
Advances in protective and restorative biotherapies have created new opportunities to use site-directed, programmable drug delivery systems to treat auditory and vestibular disorders. Successful therapy development that leverages the transgenic, knock-in, and knock-out variants of mouse models of human disease requires advanced microsystems specifically designed to function with nanoliter precision and with system volumes suitable for implantation. Here we present results for a novel biocompatible, implantable, scalable, and wirelessly controlled peristaltic micropump. The micropump configuration included commercially available catheter microtubing (250 μm OD, 125 μm ID) that provided a biocompatible leak-free flow path while avoiding complicated microfluidic interconnects. Peristaltic pumping was achieved by sequentially compressing the microtubing via expansion and contraction of a thermal phase-change material located in three chambers integrated adjacent to the microtubing. Direct-write micro-scale printing technology was used to build the mechanical components of the micropump around the microtubing directly on the back of a printed circuit board assembly (PCBA). The custom PCBA was fabricated using standard commercial processes providing microprocessor control of actuation and Bluetooth wireless communication through an Android application. The results of in vitro characterization indicated that nanoliter resolution control over the desired flow rates of 10-100 nL/min was obtained by changing the actuation frequency. Applying 10× greater than physiological backpressures and ± 3 °C ambient temperature variation did not significantly affect flow rates. Three different micropumps were tested on six mice for in vivo implantation of the catheter microtubing into the round window membrane niche for infusion of a known ototoxic compound (sodium salicylate) at 50 nL/min for 20 min. Real-time shifts in distortion product otoacoustic emission thresholds and amplitudes were measured during the infusion. There were systematic increases in distortion product threshold shifts during the 20-min perfusions; the mean shift was 15 dB for the most basal region. A biocompatibility study was performed to evaluate material suitability for chronic subcutaneous implantation and clinical translational development. The results indicated that the micropump components successfully passed key biocompatibility tests. A micropump prototype was implanted for one month without development of inflammation or infection. Although tested here on the small murine cochlea, this low-cost design and fabrication methodology is scalable for use in larger animals and for clinical applications in children and adults by appropriate scaling of the microtubing diameter and actuator volume.
Pathogenic antibiotic resistant bacteria pose one of the most important health challenges of the 21st century. The overuse and abuse of antibiotics coupled with the natural evolutionary processes of bacteria has led to this crisis. Only incremental advances in antibiotic development have occurred over the last 30 years. Novel classes of molecules, such as engineered antibodies, antibiotic enhancers, siderophore conjugates, engineered phages, photo-switchable antibiotics, and genome editing facilitated by the CRISPR/Cas system, are providing new avenues to facilitate the development of antimicrobial therapies. The informatics revolution is transforming research and development efforts to discover novel antibiotics. The explosion of nanotechnology and micro-engineering is driving the invention of antimicrobial materials, enabling the cultivation of "uncultivable" microbes and creating specific and rapid diagnostic technologies. Finally, a revival in the ecological aspects of microbial disease management, the growth of prebiotics, and integrated management based on the "One Health" model, provide additional avenues to manage this health crisis. These, and future scientific and technological developments, must be coupled and aligned with sound policy and public awareness to address the risks posed by rising antibiotic resistance.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on health-related quality of life (QoL), depression, and anxiety in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) receiving radioactive iodine therapy (RIT).
A randomized controlled trial of MBSR with 120 DTC patients was performed. They were randomly assigned into the MBSR intervention group and usual care (UC) group. An 8-week MBSR program was administered to the MBSR group starting 8 weeks before RIT. Health-related QoL, depression, and anxiety were measured immediately before the start of MBSR (T1), immediately after RIT hospitalization was concluded (1 week after concluding the last MBSR session, T2), and 3 months after RIT hospitalization (T3), using the QoL Questionnaire Core 30 Items (QLQ-C30), Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), and Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS).
Fifty-three patients in the UC group and 49 patients in the MBSR group completed the study and were analyzed. Both the UC and MBSR groups reported low QoL and high SDS and SAS scores immediately after RIT hospitalization. Patients randomly assigned to the MBSR group showed significantly greater improvements in emotional function (P=0.012, d=-0.03 for T2 and d=1.17 for T3), fatigue (P=0.037, d=1.00 for T2 and d=-0.69 for T3), global QoL (P=0.015, d=1.61 for T2 and d=1.56 for T3), depression (P=0.027, d=-1.19 for T2 and d=-0.83 for T3), and anxiety (P=0.043, d=-1.00 for T2 and d=-0.86 for T3).
An 8-week MBSR program significantly improved a wide range of scales in health-related QoL and mitigated depression and anxiety among DTC patients receiving RIT.
To assist medical and hearing-science professionals in supporting parents of deaf children, we have identified common questions that parents may have and provide evidence-based answers. In doing so, a compassionate and positive narrative about deafness and deaf children is offered, one that relies on recent research evidence regarding the critical nature of early exposure to a fully accessible visual language, which in the United States is American Sign Language (ASL). This evidence includes the role of sign language in language acquisition, cognitive development, and literacy. In order for parents to provide a nurturing and anxiety-free environment for early childhood development, signing at home is important even if their child also has the additional nurturing and care of a signing community. It is not just the early years of a child's life that matter for language acquisition; it's the early months, the early weeks, even the early days. Deaf children cannot wait for accessible language input. The whole family must learn simultaneously as the deaf child learns. Even moderate fluency on the part of the family benefits the child enormously. And learning the sign language together can be one of the strongest bonding experiences that the family and deaf child have.
AgSbF6-Catalyzed anti-Markovnikov addition of pinacolborane (HBpin) to terminal alkynes to produce the E-vinylboronates is reported. This efficient methodology is scalable, compatible with sterically and electronically diverse alkynes, and works at room temperature under solvent-free condition. The utility of this method is demonstrated in the facile synthesis of the clinically important (E)-2,4,3',5'-tetramethoxystilbene.
The purpose of this study was to optimize the extraction method for polysaccharide from the fruiting bodies of Pleurotus ostreatus (Jacq.) P. Kumm and to assess the antioxidant and cytotoxic potentials of polysaccharide. In this investigation, polysaccharides from Pleurotus ostreatus (Jacq.) P. Kumm were extricated by utilizing the hot water. One-single factor and response surface methodology was established to optimize the extraction conditions for polysaccharide from Pleurotus ostreatus (Jacq.) P. Kumm. Examination of antioxidant activity of Pleurotus ostreatus polysaccharide (POP) was directed by utilizing 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2, 2-azino-bis-3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) techniques. Cytotoxicity of POP was evaluated using an MTT assay. The experimental data were fitted to a quadratic equation utilizing multiple regression investigations, and the ideal conditions were as per the following: water/crude material proportion, 26.04 mL/g; an extraction time of 62.08 minutes; and an extraction temperature 70.5°C. Under such conditions, the polysaccharide yield was 5.32 ± 0.12% with the anticipated yield. POP showed good scavenging activity against DPPH radical (p&lt;0.001, EC50 = 1036.38 μg/mL, R2 = 0.8313) and ABTS radicals (p&lt;0.001, EC50 = 824.37 μg/mL, R2 = 0.8223), with a dose (p&lt;0.001)-and-time (p&lt;0.001) dependent cytotoxic potential on Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cell line in vitro. This demonstrated that polysaccharides (POP) had certain cancer prevention agent exercises. In this manner, these examinations give reference to additionally research and reasonable improvement of Pleurotus ostreatus (Jacq.) P. Kumm polysaccharide and POP may prove a useful therapeutic agent, due to its robust antioxidant and cytotoxic activity.
Existence and cause of thyroid stunning was controversially discussed for decades but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Numerous studies describe thyroid stunning in radioiodine-131 therapy (RIT) of differentiated thyroid carcinoma. However, there are no studies evaluating thyroid stunning in benign thyroid diseases caused by the radioiodine uptake test (RIUT). Therefore, the influence of pre-therapeutic tracer radiation dose on therapeutic iodine-131 uptake was evaluated retrospectively.
A total of 914 RIT patients were included. Exclusion criteria were anti-thyroid drugs, pre- and/or intra-therapeutic effective half-lives (EHL) beyond 8.04 days and externally performed RIUT or 24 h RIUT. All patients received RIUT 1 week before RIT. Thyroid volume was estimated via ultrasound. Tracer radiation dose to the thyroid was calculated retrospectively. The dependence of changes in the pre-therapeutic to the therapeutic extrapolated-maximum-131I-uptake (EMU) from the dose in RIUT was evaluated statistically.
EMU in RIUT ranged from 0.10 to 0.82 (median: 0.35) and EMU in RIT ranged from 0.10 to 0.74 (median: 0.33). Averaged over the whole cohort the therapeutic EMU decreased significantly (2.3% per Gray intra-thyroidal tracer radiation dose). A disease-specific evaluation showed dose-dependent thyroid stunning from 1.2% per Gray in solitary toxic nodules (n = 327) to 21% per Gray in goiters (n = 135) which was significant for the subgroups of disseminated autonomies (n = 114), multifocal autonomies (n = 178) and goiters (p &lt; 0.05) but not for Graves' diseases (n = 160) and solitary toxic nodules (p &gt; 0.05).
The presented data indicate for the first time a significant dependence of pre-therapeutic radiation dose on thyroid stunning in goiter and disseminated and multifocal autonomy. To achieve the desired intra-thyroidal radiation dose, RIT activity should be adapted depending on the dose in RIUT.
Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness and normal tissue toxicity of radioimmunotherapy (RIT) of s.c. PANC-1 human pancreatic cancer (PnCa) xenografts in NRG mice using anti-EGFR panitumumab linked to metal-chelating polymers (MCPs) that present 13 DOTA chelators to complex the β-emitter, 177Lu. The clonogenic survival (CS) of PANC-1 cells treated in vitro with panitumumab-MCP-177Lu (0.3-1.2 MBq) and DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the nucleus of these cells were measured by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy for γ-H2AX. Subcellular distribution of radioactivity for panitumumab-MCP-177Lu was measured, and absorbed doses to the cell nucleus were calculated. Normal tissue toxicity was assessed in non tumor-bearing NRG mice by monitoring body weight, complete blood cell counts (CBC), serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatinine (Cr) after i.v. injection of 6 MBq (10 μg) of panitumumab-MCP-177Lu. RIT was performed in NRG mice with s.c. PANC-1 tumors injected i.v. with 6 MBq (10 μg) of panitumumab-MCP-177Lu. Control mice received nonspecific human IgG-MCP-177Lu (6 MBq; 10 μg), unlabeled panitumumab (10 μg), or normal saline. The tumor growth index (TGI) was compared. Tumor and normal organ doses were estimated based on biodistribution studies. Panitumumab-MCP-177Lu reduced the CS of PANC-1 cells in vitro by 7.7-fold at the highest amount tested (1.2 MBq). Unlabeled panitumumab had no effect on the CS of PANC-1 cells. γ-H2AX foci were increased by 3.8-fold by panitumumab-MCP-177Lu. Panitumumab-MCP-177Lu deposited 3.84 Gy in the nucleus of PANC-1 cells. Administration of panitumumab-MCP-177Lu (6 MBq; 10 μg) to NRG mice caused no change in body weight, CBC, or ALT and only a slight increase in Cr compared to NRG mice treated with normal saline. Panitumumab-MCP-177Lu strongly inhibited tumor growth in NRG mice (TGI = 2.3 ± 0.2) compared to normal saline-treated mice (TGI = 5.8 ± 0.5; P &lt; 0.01). Unlabeled panitumumab had no effect on tumor growth (TGI = 6.0 ± 1.6; P &gt; 0.05). The absorbed dose of PANC-1 tumors was 12.3 Gy. The highest normal organ doses were absorbed by the pancreas, liver, spleen, and kidneys. We conclude that EGFR-targeted RIT with panitumumab-MCP-177Lu was able to overcome resistance to panitumumab in KRAS mutant PANC-1 tumors in NRG mice and may be a promising approach to treatment of PnCa in humans.
Multi-ions doped bioactive calcium phosphate (dCaP) layers were developed by pulse current deposition onto surgical grade titanium alloy material (Ti6Al4V). The coatings were electrodeposited from base electrolyte containing adequate amounts of calcium nitrate and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate at 70 °C. After electrodeposition, the pure CaP layers were doped with different ions that possess bioactive and antimicrobial properties, such as Zn2+, Mg2+, Sr2+ and Ag+ ions. The morphology and structure of coatings were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Energy-dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) as well as XRD and FT-IR measurements. The results revealed the pulse current deposited and surface post-treated CaP layer to be mainly in hydroxyapatite phase. The corrosion properties of bioceramic coatings were assessed in conventional simulated body fluid (SBF) in a three electrode open cell by using potentiodynamic polarization measurements over two weeks period. The electrochemical results revealed that the pure calcium phosphate (CaP) coated implant material and the bare implant possess the highest resistivity to corrosion, while the modified calcium phosphate coating showed lower corrosion resistance by at least one order of magnitude. The cell viability measurements showed that the electrochemically deposited CaP layer was biocompatible.
The purpose of this study was to comparatively investigate the posterolateral fusion rate in ovariectomized (OVX) rats using two new bone graft materials: strontium (Sr) substituted hydroxyapatite (HA) nanocrystals and alendronate (AL) functionalized HA nanocrystals. SrHA was synthesized in presence of different Sr concentrations (SrHA5; SrHA10) and HA-AL nanocrystals at increasing bisphosphonate (BP) content (HA-AL7; HA-AL28).
A posterolateral spinal fusion model in twenty-five Sham operated and in twenty-five OVX female rats was used and materials were bilaterally implanted between transverse processes of lumbar vertebrae. Sham and OVX animals were divided in five groups depending on the material: HA, SrHA5, SrHA10, HA-AL7 and HA-AL28. The assessment of bone fusion was carried out by μCT, histology and histomorphometry.
Some gaps between the transverse processes were observed by μCT in OVXHA group, while they were not present in all the other groups. These results were consistent with the histomorphometrical analyses showing that in OVX animals SrHA and HA-AL materials displayed significantly higher BV/TV and Tb.Th and significantly lower Tb.N and Tb.Sp in comparison with HA alone.
Results of this study suggest that in spinal fusion the incorporation of bioactive ions or drugs as Sr and AL improves the biological performance of HA representing a promising strategy especially in osteoporosis patients with high risks of spinal fusion failure. Results also suggest the existence of a Sr and AL dose response effect and that HA containing the highest AL dose could be the candidate biomaterial for spinal fusion in osteoporotic subjects.
The aim of the study was to describe the coagulatory state of hyperthyroid cats before and after successful radioiodine therapy (RIT) compared with healthy age-matched controls, using classical coagulation parameters and thromboelastogram (TEG) as a global assessment method. The differences in coagulation activity after RIT, depending on the thyroid hormone (normal vs low total thyroxine [T4]) state, were also evaluated.
Fifteen hyperthyroid cats and 10 healthy age-matched controls were recruited. Hyperthyroid cats that remained hyperthyroid 14 days after RIT were excluded. Haematology, biochemistry, T4, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen and TEG were assessed in control cats and hyperthyroid cats before and 7 and 14 days after RIT. Two weeks after successful RIT, further comparisons were made between cats with normal T4 vs those with low T4.
Fourteen days after successful RIT, 7/15 cats had normal T4 and 8/15 had low T4. Thrombocytosis was noted in 6/15 cats after treatment. Fibrinogen was significantly higher ( P &lt;0.001) and PT shorter ( P &lt;0.01) in the hyperthyroid cats compared with the healthy controls and these changes persisted after RIT. Persistent increases in fibrinogen, PT, TEG maximal amplitude and TEG clot rigidity, reflecting clot stability, after RIT primarily occurred in the cats with normal T4. TEG-K (time until preset amplitude of 20 mm is reached) and alpha (α) angle reflected impaired fibrin cross-linking ability prior to RIT, which significantly increased after therapy ( P &lt;0.05).
Based on some of the coagulation parameters, cats with hyperthyroidism showed hypercoagulable tendencies, which were mildly increased after RIT, possibly due to transient radiation-induced thyroiditis.
It is very well know nowadays that despite all the good and qualitative information available, the patients who are supposed to be treated with radioiodine for differentiated thyroid cancer suffer from a lot of concerns prior the treatment. The aim of our study is to investigate the level of anxiety and lessening of the concerns pre and post RIT (radioiodine therapy) using a dedicated, special designed questionnaire.
A cross-sectional study of 54 differentiated thyroid cancer patients was conducted. Patients who met the inclusion criteria were invited to complete the radioprotection questionnaire pre and post RIT. The questionnaire comprises two sections (pre and post radioiodine treatment) with specific questions regarding aspects of radioprotection measures and the impact on the overall well-being. For uniform distribution of variables we used Pearson correlation and for monotonic relationship between variables, Spearman correlation.
The pre-treatment questionnaire reported a strong confidence of the patients in the medical team, good and accurate information regarding the treatment, &gt;50 % suffering from anxiety and concerns before the radioiodine treatment. The post treatment questionnaire revealed no fear of isolation, a lot of useful information and most of the patients would undergo another treatment, if necessary and also recommend it to others.
The milestone in having a good and compliant patient remains a very good communication between the medical team and the patient. We are able to influence and change things and have fewer patients with fear from radioactivity and treatment concerns if we dedicate enough time to give them the adequate information in the best way so it will be correctly received.
The EphA3 receptor has recently emerged as a functional tumour-specific therapeutic target in glioblastoma (GBM). EphA3 is significantly elevated in recurrent disease, is most highly expressed on glioma stem cells (GSCs), and has a functional role in maintaining self-renewal and tumourigenesis. An unlabelled EphA3-targeting therapeutic antibody is currently under clinical assessment in recurrent GBM patients. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of EphA3 antibody drug conjugate (ADC) and radioimmunotherapy (RIT) approaches using orthotopic animal xenograft models. Brain uptake studies, using positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging, show EphA3 antibodies are effectively delivered across the blood-tumour barrier and accumulate at the tumour site with no observed normal brain reactivity. A robust anti-tumour response, with no toxicity, was observed using EphA3, ADC, and RIT approaches, leading to a significant increase in overall survival. Our current research provides evidence that GBM patients may benefit from pay-loaded EphA3 antibody therapies.
Recombinant human thyroid stimulating hormone (RhTSH) aided radioiodine ablative therapy (RIT) is current-day practice in the treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). It is often planned 4 to 6 weeks after surgery or sometimes even longer (standard protocol). The RhTSH-aided RIT, however, has the advantage that it can be planned shortly after thyroidectomy. The FASTHYNA trial was designed to test the hypothesis that RIT 1 week after thyroidectomy (fast-track protocol) results in a significant reduction of sick leave with lower societal costs and with a better quality of life (QOL) compared with the current standard treatment.
In a randomized, multicenter trial, we included patients with differentiated thyroid cancer, stage T1-3 N0-1 M0-x, who were treated with a total or completion thyroidectomy, with a paid job of at least 12 hours per week. The primary study end point was days of sick leave reported from time of surgery. Secondary end points were QOL and societal costs associated with absence from work.
Twenty patients were eligible for inclusion between November 2013 and May 2016. Significant decreases in mean duration of sick leave in the fast-track group versus the standard care group (115 and 280 hours, respectively, P = 0.02) and in costs associated with productivity losses (&amp;OV0556;4070.77 vs &amp;OV0556;9202.90, P = 0.02) were found. There were no significant differences in QOL between both groups.
The trial showed a significant reduction in sick leave and in societal costs in the fast-track group without a deterioration of QOL. Therefore, fast-track ablation is desirable.

The 240-kb Salmonella phage SPN3US genome encodes 264 gene products, many of which are functionally uncharacterized. We have previously used mass spectrometry to define the proteomes of wild-type and mutant forms of the SPN3US virion. In this study, we sought to determine whether this technique was suitable for the characterization of the SPN3US proteome during liquid infection. Mass spectrometry of SPN3US-infected cells identified 232 SPN3US and 1,994 Salmonella proteins. SPN3US proteins with related functions, such as proteins with roles in DNA replication, transcription, and virion formation, were coordinately expressed in a temporal manner. Mass spectral counts showed the four most abundant SPN3US proteins to be the major capsid protein, two head ejection proteins, and the functionally unassigned protein gp22. This high abundance of gp22 in infected bacteria contrasted with its absence from mature virions, suggesting that it might be the scaffold protein, an essential head morphogenesis protein yet to be identified in giant phages. We identified homologs to SPN3US gp22 in 45 related giant phages, including ϕKZ, whose counterpart is also abundant in infected bacteria but absent in the virion. We determined the ϕKZ counterpart to be cleaved in vitro by its prohead protease, an event that has been observed to promote head maturation of some other phages. Our findings are consistent with a scaffold protein assignment for SPN3US gp22, although direct evidence is required for its confirmation. These studies demonstrate the power of mass spectral analyses for facilitating the acquisition of new knowledge into the molecular events of viral infection.IMPORTANCE "Giant" phages with genomes &gt;200 kb are being isolated in increasing numbers from a range of environments. With hosts such as Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Erwinia amylovora, these phages are of interest for phage therapy of multidrug-resistant pathogens. However, our understanding of how these complex phages interact with their hosts is impeded by the proportion (∼80%) of their gene products that are functionally uncharacterized. To develop the repertoire of techniques for analysis of phages, we analyzed a liquid infection of Salmonella phage SPN3US (240-kb genome) using third-generation mass spectrometry. We observed the temporal production of phage proteins whose genes collectively represent 96% of the SPN3US genome. These findings demonstrate the sensitivity of mass spectrometry for global proteomic profiling of virus-infected cells, and the identification of a candidate for a major head morphogenesis protein will facilitate further studies into giant phage head assembly.
Exiguobacterium sp. RIT 452 is of biotechnological importance given its potential for antibiotic production. Bactericidal activity was detected using spent medium extract in a disk diffusion assay against Escherichia coli. The genome consists of 3,246 protein-coding sequences, including a variety of gene clusters involved in the synthesis of antibacterial compounds.
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), immunoglobulin fragments, and other proteins are important scaffolds in the development of radiopharmaceuticals for diagnostic immuno-positron emission tomography (immuno-PET) and targeted radioimmunotherapy (RIT). Conventional methods for radiolabelling proteins with metal ions such as 68 Ga, 64 Cu, 89 Zr, and 90 Y require multi-step procedures involving pre-purification, functionalisation with a chelate, and subsequent radiolabelling. Standard coupling chemistries are time-consuming, difficult to automate, and involve synthesis, isolation, and storage of an intermediate, new molecular entity (the conjugated mAb) whose biochemical properties can differ from those of the parent protein. To circumvent these issues, we developed a photoradiochemical approach that uses fast, chemoselective, light-induced protein modification under mild conditions with novel metal-ion-binding chelates derivatised with aryl azide (ArN3 ) groups. Experiments show that one-pot photochemical conjugation and radiolabelling of formulated mAbs can be achieved in &lt;20 min.
To assess efficacy of radioimmunotherapy (RIT) in follicular lymphoma, data from 281 patients collected in the RIT Network, with a median follow-up of 8·2 years after RIT were analysed. RIT was given at first line in 18·5% and at relapse in 81·5%. Following first line therapy, 76·9% achieved complete remission (CR), 9·6% partial remission (PR), 1·9% stable disease (SD) and 1·9% had progressive disease (PD); response was not documented in 9·7%. At relapse, the rate of CR was 48·5% and that of PR was 16·6%, SD 2·6% and PD 10·5%; response was not documented in 21·8%. After median follow-up of 8·2 years, median progression-free survival (PFS) for all was 2·54 years, median overall survival (OS) was not reached. Median PFS and OS (both not reached) were significantly better in first line, compared to RIT at relapse (PFS, 2·11 years; OS, 10·8 years; P = 0·0037 and P = 0·0021, respectively). Overall 8-year PFS was 33·9%, 53·6% for first line and 29·6% for relapsed individuals. Overall 8-year OS was 58·8%, 78·1% for first line and 54·5% for relapsed patients. Thirty-five patients (12·5%) developed secondary malignancy and 16 patients (5·7%) experienced transformation into aggressive lymphoma. RIT is a safe and effective treatment option for follicular lymphoma, both at front line and relapse with an 8-year PFS of 53·6% and 29·6%, respectively.
F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid metastatic lesions are associated with a poor response to radioiodine ablation therapy (RIT) in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). This study evaluated the significance of preablative FDG positron emission tomography (PET) for the assessment of risk factors and frequency of malignant FDG-avid lymph nodes in patients with PTC undergoing RIT.The study included 339 consecutive patients (mean age 46.3 ± 12.5 y; 260 females) with PTC referred for the first RIT and who underwent routine preablative FDG PET between April 2011 and February 2013. FDG-avid lymph nodes (FALNs) were identified using retrospective image reviews. The frequency of malignant FALN (mFALN), its contribution to persistent or recurrent PTC, and its risk factors were analyzed.Among the patients, 112 had FALNs (33.0%): 11 mFALNs (3.2%) and 101 benign FALNs (bFALNs, 29.8%). mFALN contributed to 55% of persistent or recurrent PTC after RIT, which was observed in 20 of 339 patients (5.9%) during the post-RIT follow-up. Among preoperative risk factors, suspicious extrathyroidal extension and lateral neck lymph node metastasis on imaging studies were associated with mFALN. Among postoperative risk factors, T3/T4 and N1b stages, higher stimulated thyroglobulin, and higher numbers of metastatic lymph nodes and dissected lymph nodes, were associated with mFALN.mFALNs were observed in a small number of patients with PTC undergoing RIT, but it contributed 55% of total recurrent or persistent disease. Increased frequency of mFALNs is associated with more advanced PTC. Preablative FDG PET has value in evaluation of patients with RIT-resistant lesions and may help determine further treatment strategies.
To evaluate rod function longitudinally in intermediate age-related macular degeneration subjects with reticular pseudodrusen (RPD) and without RPD (AMD).
Retinal sensitivities (505 and 625 nm) during dark adaptation, at 14 locations within the central 12° macula were obtained after photobleaching at baseline and 12-month visits. Pointwise sensitivity differences between both stimuli were used to assess static rod function, while rod intercept time (RIT) and rod recovery rate (RRR) were used to evaluate dynamic function. Changes in function over time were compared between groups.
A total of 23 controls, 12 AMD, and 13 RPD cases were followed-up. At baseline, the RPD group had significantly worst static and dynamic rod function compared to AMD and control groups. Static function in AMD was similar to controls. Static and dynamic function across the central 12° was consistent in controls; however, it was most impaired at 4° compared to 12° eccentricity in disease groups. Over 12 months, no AMD cases progressed clinically and static function in AMD improved (P ≤ 0.04), but remained unchanged in control and RPD groups (P ≥ 0.17). The RRR for control and RPD groups remained stable, while the AMD group deteriorated, but only at 12° (P = 0.02). The RIT was stable in AMD (P = 0.75) and RPD (P = 0.71) groups but improved in the control group (P = 0.002).
A decrease in RRR was detected over 12 months at 12° eccentricity in the AMD group. Evaluating changes in rod function requires testing at multiple locations including the peripheral macula.
The topological landscape of gene interaction networks provides a rich source of information for inferring functional patterns of genes or proteins. However, it is still a challenging task to aggregate heterogeneous biological information such as gene expression and gene interactions to achieve more accurate inference for prediction and discovery of new gene interactions. In particular, how to generate a unified vector representation to integrate diverse input data is a key challenge addressed here.
We propose a scalable and robust deep learning framework to learn embedded representations to unify known gene interactions and gene expression for gene interaction predictions. These low- dimensional embeddings derive deeper insights into the structure of rapidly accumulating and diverse gene interaction networks and greatly simplify downstream modeling. We compare the predictive power of our deep embeddings to the strong baselines. The results suggest that our deep embeddings achieve significantly more accurate predictions. Moreover, a set of novel gene interaction predictions are validated by up-to-date literature-based database entries.
The proposed model demonstrates the importance of integrating heterogeneous information about genes for gene network inference. GNE is freely available under the GNU General Public License and can be downloaded from GitHub ( https://github.com/kckishan/GNE ).
We report four near-complete genome sequences of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) Indiana obtained with Sanger and Illumina next-generation sequencing, namely, laboratory strains HR (heat resistant) and T1026R1 and isolates 22-20 and 22-25. Previously, only the M gene of these viruses had been sequenced, and these sequences were not deposited in GenBank.
Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) is a novel strategy for treating non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Several studies have shown the promising results of using RIT in NHL, which have led to FDA approval for two RIT agents in treating low grade NHL. In spite of these favorable results in low-grade NHL, most of the aggressive or relapsed/refractory NHL subjects experience relapses following RIT. Although more aggressive treatments such as myeloablative doses of RIT followed by stem cell transplantation appear to be able to provide a longer survival for some patients these approaches are associated with significant treatment-related adverse events and challenging to deliver in most centers. Therefore, it seems reasonable to develop treatment approaches that enhance the efficiency of RIT, while reducing its toxicity. In this paper, novel methods that improve the efficiency of RIT and reduce its toxicity through various mechanisms are reviewed. Further clinical development of these methods could expand the NHL patient groups eligible for receiving RIT, and even extend the use of RIT to new indications and disease groups in future.
The aim of this study was to define prognostic value and optimal threshold of first thyroglobulin (fTg) measured after thyroidectomy and just before radio-iodine therapy (RIT), in low/intermediate risk patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC).
This is a retrospective study in 383 patients with DTC who were treated with surgery followed by RIT. Response to treatment was assessed 1 and 2 years after RIT. Odds ratio of different risk factors like age, sex, TNM stage, fTg and Anti-Tg Ab were compared between patients with and without incomplete response 1 and 2 years after treatment. Receiver operating curve analysis was used for definition of optimal fTg cut off for detection of incomplete response.
218 female and 55 male with DTC had negative anti-Tg antibody (mean age: 37.5±14.5 years) and analyzed separately. fTg≥33.5 ng/ml and fTg/TSH ratio of ≥0.36 had the optimal sensitivity and specificity for detection of incomplete response 1 and 2 years after treatment. fTg&lt;35ng/ml had NPV of 98.5% for exclusion of distant metastases. Patients with fTg≥33.5ng/ml had longer "time to excellent response" (3.6±2.3 vs 2.0±1.8 yrs) and needed more additional treatments compared to patients with fTg&lt;35 ng/ml. Multivariate analysis showed that fTg was the most potent risk factor for prediction of treatment failure 1 and 2 years after RIT.
fTg of ≥35.5 ng/ml was the most important risk factor for prediction of treatment failure after RIT and could be included in decision algorithms regarding intensity of treatments in low/intermediate risk patients with DTC.
Meniscal injuries are often associated with an active lifestyle. The damage of meniscal tissue puts young patients at higher risk of undergoing meniscal surgery and, therefore, at higher risk of osteoarthritis. In this study, we undertook proof-of-concept research to develop a cellularized human meniscus by using 3D bioprinting technology.
A 3D model of bioengineered medial meniscus tissue was created, based on MRI scans of a human volunteer. The Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) data from these MRI scans were processed using dedicated software, in order to obtain an STL model of the structure. The chosen 3D Discovery printing tool was a microvalve-based inkjet printhead. Primary mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were isolated from bone marrow and embedded in a collagen-based bio-ink before printing. LIVE/DEAD assay was performed on realized cell-laden constructs carrying MSCs in order to evaluate cell distribution and viability.
This study involved the realization of a human cell-laden collagen meniscus using 3D bioprinting. The meniscus prototype showed the biological potential of this technology to provide an anatomically shaped, patient-specific construct with viable cells on a biocompatible material.
This paper reports the preliminary findings of the production of a custom-made, cell-laden, collagen-based human meniscus. The prototype described could act as the starting point for future developments of this collagen-based, tissue-engineered structure, which could aid the optimization of implants designed to replace damaged menisci.Cite this article: G.

This paper demonstrates an easily prepared novel material and approach to producing aligned nickel (Ni) nanowires having unique and customizable structures on a variety of substrates for electronic and magnetic applications. This is a new approach to producing printed metallic Ni structures from precursor materials, and it provides a novel technique for nanowire formation during reduction. This homogeneous solution can be printed in ambient conditions, and it forms aligned elemental Ni nanowires over large areas upon heating in the presence of a magnetic field. The use of templates or subsequent purification are not required. This technique is very flexible, and allows the preparation of unique patterns of nanowires which provides opportunities to produce structures with enhanced anisotropic electrical and magnetic properties. An example of this is the unique fabrication of aligned nanowire grids by overlaying layers of nanowires oriented at different angles with respect to each other. The resistivity of printed and cured films was found to be as low as 560 µΩ∙cm. The saturation magnetization was measured to be 30 emu∙g-1, which is comparable to bulk Ni. Magnetic anisotropy was induced with an axis along the direction of the applied magnetic field, giving soft magnetic properties.
Identification of children at risk of developmental delay and/or impairment requires valid measurement of early child development (ECD). We systematically assess ECD measurement tools for accuracy and feasibility for use in routine services in low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC).
Building on World Bank and peer-reviewed literature reviews, we identified available ECD measurement tools for children aged 0-3 years used in ≥1 LMIC and matrixed these according to when (child age) and what (ECD domains) they measure at population or individual level. Tools measuring &lt;2 years and covering ≥3 developmental domains, including cognition, were rated for accuracy and feasibility criteria using a rating approach derived from Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations.
61 tools were initially identified, 8% (n=5) population-level and 92% (n=56) individual-level screening or ability tests. Of these, 27 tools covering ≥3 domains beginning &lt;2 years of age were selected for rating accuracy and feasibility. Recently developed population-level tools (n=2) rated highly overall, particularly in reliability, cultural adaptability, administration time and geographical uptake. Individual-level tool (n=25) ratings were variable, generally highest for reliability and lowest for accessibility, training, clinical relevance and geographical uptake.
Although multiple measurement tools exist, few are designed for multidomain ECD measurement in young children, especially in LMIC. No available tools rated strongly across all accuracy and feasibility criteria with accessibility, training requirements, clinical relevance and geographical uptake being poor for most tools. Further research is recommended to explore this gap in fit-for-purpose tools to monitor ECD in routine LMIC health services.
MMR II (M-M-R II [Merck &amp; Co, Inc.]) is currently the only measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine licensed in the United States. A second MMR vaccine would mitigate the potential risk of vaccine supply shortage or delay. In this study, we assessed the immunogenicity and safety of another MMR vaccine (MMR-RIT [Priorix, GlaxoSmithKline]) compared with those of the MMR II in 12- to 15-month-old children who received it as a first dose.
In this phase III, observer-blinded, noninferiority, lot-to-lot consistency clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01702428), 5003 healthy children were randomly assigned to receive 1 dose of MMR-RIT (1 of 3 production lots) or MMR II along with other age-recommended routine vaccines. We evaluated the immunogenicity of all vaccines in terms of antibody concentrations (by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or electrochemiluminescence assay) and/or seroresponse rates 43 days after vaccination. We also assessed the reactogenicity and safety of the vaccines.
Immunoresponses after vaccination with MMR-RIT were robust and noninferior to those after vaccination with the MMR II. Immunogenicity of the 3 production lots of MMR-RIT was consistent; more than 97% of the children had a seroresponse to MMR components. The coadministered vaccines elicited similar immunoresponses in the MMR-RIT and MMR II groups. Both MMR vaccines resulted in comparable reactogenicity profiles, and no safety concerns were detected.
If licensed, the MMR-RIT could provide a valid option for the prevention of measles, mumps, and rubella in children in the United States and would reduce potential risks of a vaccine shortage.
Despite the effectiveness of radioiodine therapy (RIT), a few patients are refractory and show relapse, warranting repeated RIT (RRIT). The purpose of this study is to explore the risk factors for RRIT.
We retrospectively analyzed 607 cases treated with iodine-131 (131I) between January 2013 and June 2016. Patients were categorized into two groups: RRIT (n=76) or non-RRIT (n=531). Univariate analysis and a final multivariate model were used to determine the risk factors for RRIT. P&lt;0.05 indicated significance. After a mean 314.5MBq dose of 131I, 76 patients underwent secondary therapy.
In the univariate analysis, the differences in terms of age, gender, family history of hyperthyroidism, course of disease, 24-hour 131I uptake, curve shape of 131I uptake, dose of 131I, thyroid peroxidase antibody, and thyrotrophin receptor antibody were not statistically significant (P&gt;0.05). Anti-thyroid drug (ATD) treatment history, thyroid mass and dose of 131I were statistically significant (P values: 0.001, &lt;0.001 and &lt;0.001, respectively). Binary logistic analysis of factors that lead to repeated RIT showed a higher probability of ATD treatment history [OR=2.919, 95%CI (1.424, 5.982), P=0.003] and thyroid mass [OR=1.042, 95%CI(1.031, 1.052), P&lt;0.001] associated with RRIT.
Patients treated with ATD before radioiodine treatment and with larger thyroid mass are at a higher risk for repeated radioiodine treatment.
Targeted radioimmunotherapy (RIT) is an attractive approach to selectively localize therapeutic radionuclides to malignant cells within primary and metastatic tumors while sparing normal tissues from the effects of radiation. Many human malignancies express B7-H3 on the tumor cell surface, while expression on the majority of normal tissues is limited, presenting B7-H3 as a candidate target for RIT. This review provides an overview of the general principles of targeted RIT and discusses publications that have used radiolabeled B7-H3-targeted antibodies for RIT of cancer in preclinical or clinical studies.
Databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched for publications through June 2018 using a combination of terms including "B7-H3", "radioimmunotherapy", "targeted", "radiotherapy", and "cancer." After screening search results for relevancy, ten publications were included for discussion.
B7-H3-targeted RIT studies to date range from antibody development and assessment of novel radioimmunoconjugates (RICs) in animal models of human cancer to phase II/III trials in humans. The majority of clinical studies have used B7-H3-targeted RICs for intra-compartment RIT of central nervous system malignancies. The results of these studies have indicated high tolerability and favorable efficacy outcomes, supporting further assessment of B7-H3-targeted RIT in larger trials. Preclinical B7-H3-targeted RIT studies have also shown encouraging therapeutic outcomes in a variety of solid malignancies.
B7-H3-targeted RIT studies over the last 15 years have demonstrated feasibility for clinical development and support future assessment in a broader array of human malignancies. Future directions worthy of exploration include strategies that combine B7-H3-targeted RIT with chemotherapy or immunotherapy.
Residual stress/strain and microstructure used in additively manufactured material are strongly dependent on process parameter combination. With the aim to better understand and correlate process parameters used in electron beam melting (EBM) of Ti-6Al-4V with resulting phase distributions and residual stress/strains, extensive experimental work has been performed. A large number of polycrystalline Ti-6Al-4V specimens were produced with different optimized EBM process parameter combinations. These specimens were post-sequentially studied by using high-energy X-ray and neutron diffraction. In addition, visible light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) studies were performed and linked to the other findings. Results show that the influence of scan speed and offset focus on resulting residual strain in a fully dense sample was not significant. In contrast to some previous literature, a uniform α- and β-Ti phase distribution was found in all investigated specimens. Furthermore, no strong strain variations along the build direction with respect to the deposition were found. The magnitude of strain in α and β phase show some variations both in the build plane and along the build direction, which seemed to correlate with the size of the primary β grains. However, no relation was found between measured residual strains in α and β phase. Large primary β grains and texture appear to have a strong effect on X-ray based stress results with relatively small beam size, therefore it is suggested to use a large beam for representative bulk measurements and also to consider the prior β grain size in experimental planning, as well as for mathematical modelling.
Metals recycling is one of the oldest industries in the United States that now employs over 530,000 individuals. It has always played a significant role in the economy, supplied extensive goods and services, and the costs and benefits directly and/or indirectly extend worldwide. Improved efficiency in metals recycling is crucial to achieving a more circular economy; to enable this requires understanding how the industry operates and the challenges it must overcome. Increasing metal product diversity and design complexity combined with increased feed volumes has introduced recent additional challenges. This review explores the current status and state of the industry and examines potential technology solutions that address inbound inspection and material identification challenges.
Rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) is a commonly used index for predicting the outcome of spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). Ultrasound is a non-invasive technique for assessing diaphragm activity and function. This study aimed to investigate changes in diaphragm activity during SBT, and to compare diaphragm function between patients with and without SBT success.
Forty-five patients undergoing SBT were enrolled. Thickening fraction of the diaphragm was assessed during tidal breathing (TFditidal), and RSBI was measured during 30 min of SBT. Diaphragm function measured by maximum TFdi (TFdimax) and diaphragmatic excursion (DEmax) was also evaluated.
TFditidal and RSBI significantly increased during SBT (TFditidal0vs. TFditidal30 = 29.8 ± 13.8 vs. 37.4 ± 13.0%; p &lt; .001, and RSBI0vs. RSBI30 = 64.8 ± 25.9 vs.70.8 ± 29.1 breaths/min/L; p = .034). In SBT failure (n = 13), there was no significant difference in TFditidal compared to SBT success, except at the beginning of the trial (p = .043); however, RSBI significantly increased throughout SBT. No differences in TFdimax or DEmax were observed between groups.
Patient inspiratory efforts significantly increased during SBT. TFditidal measured by diaphragm ultrasound could not distinguish between patients with SBT success and failure. RSBI was significantly higher during SBT in patients with SBT failure.
Podoplanin is a type I transmembrane sialomucin-like glycoprotein that is highly expressed in malignant mesothelioma. The rat-human chimeric antibody NZ-12 has high affinity for human podoplanin and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and is applicable for radioimmunotherapy (RIT) to enhance the antitumor effect. In the present study, we evaluated the in vivo and in vitro properties of radiolabeled NZ-12 and the antitumor effect of RIT with 90 Y-labeled NZ-12 in an NCI-H226 (H226) malignant mesothelioma xenograft mouse model. 111 In-labeled NZ-12 bound specifically to H226 cells with high affinity, and accumulation was high in H226 tumors but low in major organs. RIT with 90 Y-labeled NZ-12 significantly suppressed tumor growth and prolonged survival without body weight loss and obvious adverse effects. Higher podoplanin expression levels were observed in human mesothelioma specimens, suggesting higher tumor accumulation of 90 Y-labeled NZ-12 in patients compared with the H226 tumor xenografts. Our findings suggest that 90 Y-labeled NZ-12 is a promising RIT agent as a new therapeutic option for malignant mesothelioma that warrants further clinical studies to evaluate the dosimetry and efficacy in patients.
Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) has been widely used to risk stratify and predict coronary artery disease (CAD) despite its significant limitations. To test whether radial artery intima thickness (RIT) is closely associated with atherosclerotic risk factors, and whether RIT has an independent and additive value for diagnosis of CAD.
One hundred and sixteen consecutive CAD patients and 79 age and gender-matched healthy controls were enrolled in this study. RIT, radial media thickness, radial intima-media thickness, and CIMT were measured with a high-resolution ultrasound biomicroscopy. Binary logistic regression was used to assess association between CAD and ultrasonic parameters, biochemical biomarkers or traditional risk factors. Receiver-operating characteristic curves were plotted to compare performances of several diagnostic models. RIT was positively associated with age, systolic blood pressure, statin administration, and hypertension. The independent value of RIT for differentiating CAD was similar to that of CIMT, but the add-on value of RIT to traditional risk factors for detecting CAD was superior to that of CIMT. Moreover, addition of RIT and CIMT to traditional risk factors increased AUC for detecting CAD from 0.724 to 0.867 significantly (P = 0.003).
RIT could detect CAD independently similarly to CIMT. The add-on value of RIT to traditional risk factors for detecting CAD was superior to CIMT and addition of RIT and CIMT to traditional risk factors markedly increased the power to diagnose CAD. Thus, RIT measured by ultrasound biomicroscopy provided a novel approach to non-invasive diagnosis of CAD.
In many countries, a second dose of a combined measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is recommended at 4-6 years of age - similarly to the booster of diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, and inactivated polio vaccine (DTaP-IPV) and the second dose of varicella vaccine (VV). Vaccine co-administration is generally encouraged if no interferences exist among the vaccines. This phase IIIa, randomized, controlled trial (NCT01621802) evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of MMR-RIT (Priorix, GSK) when given as a second dose with or without co-administration of DTaP-IPV and VV, using MMR II (M-M-R II, Merck &amp; Co Inc.) as comparator. Antibody geometric mean concentrations or titers (GMCs/GMTs) and response rates to the components of all the administered vaccines were assessed. Solicited, unsolicited, and serious adverse events were recorded. Four thousand eleven children aged 4-6 years were enrolled. MMR-RIT elicited immune responses that were not inferior to those of MMR II in terms of GMCs and seroresponse rates when administered alone or when co-administered with DTaP-IPV and VV. The immune responses to the co-administered vaccines in MMR-RIT recipients were non-inferior to those in MMR II recipients. MMR-RIT and MMR II demonstrated similar reactogenicity profiles; the most frequent solicited adverse events across vaccine groups and sub-cohorts were local pain and fever. In conclusion, the immunogenicity and safety profiles of MMR-RIT administered with or without DTaP-IPV and VV were similar to those of MMR II.
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a B cell malignancy for which new treatments are urgently needed. The B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is a lineage-restricted differentiation protein highly expressed on myeloma. Recombinant immunotoxins (RITs) are proteins composed of the Fv or Fab portion of an antibody fused to a bacterial toxin. We previously treated H929 myeloma s.c. tumors with anti-BCMA immunotoxins, very active on killing cultured cells, and observed tumor growth inhibition but not complete tumor responses. To determine if immunotoxins were more active against cells growing in the bone marrow (BM), the normal location of myeloma cells, we developed a BM mouse model that is more relevant to human disease. H929 cells were transfected with luciferase and GFP, enriched by flow, recycled through the BM of a mouse, and injected IV into nonobese diabetic scid γ mice (NSG) mice. A second myeloma mouse model used the MM.1S-GFP-luc cell line. Mice were treated IV with immunotoxins, and the tumor burden was assessed using bioluminescence imaging. We achieved complete durable remissions when treating mice with H929-GFP-luc cells with anti-BCMA RITs both leptomycin B-75 (LMB-75) [anti-BCMA-disulfide-stabilized (ds)-Fv-PE24] (where PE represents Pseudomonas exotoxin A) or LMB-70 (anti-BCMA-Fab-PE24) given every other day for 5-d (QOD×5) doses beginning on day 4 or day 8. Mice were disease free at 3 months; untreated mice became moribund around day 40. We also achieved long-term responses using the MM.1S-GFP-luc myeloma cell line. Treatment with an 1.5 mg/kg LMB-75 QOD×5 anti-BCMA RIT beginning on day 4 caused the complete disappearance of tumors for 80 days. To summarize, LMB-75 and LMB-70, our anti-BCMA RITs, induced complete durable responses in two myeloma models.
Two kinds of signal-dependent transcription termination and RNA release mechanisms have been established in prokaryotes in vitro by: (i) binding of Rho to cytidine-rich nascent RNA [Rho-dependent termination (RDT)], and (ii) the formation of a hairpin structure in the nascent RNA, ending predominantly with uridine residues [Rho-independent termination (RIT)]. As shown here, the two signals act independently of each other and can be regulated (suppressed) by translation-transcription coupling in vivo. When not suppressed, both RIT- and RDT-mediated transcription termination do occur, but ribonucleolytic processing generates defined new 3' ends in the terminated RNA molecules. The actual termination events at the end of transcription units are masked by generation of new processed 3' RNA ends; thus the in vivo 3' ends do not define termination sites. We predict generation of 3' ends of mRNA by processing is a common phenomenon in prokaryotes as is the case in eukaryotes.
This pilot study aimed to ascertain whether the local application of ascorbic acid (AA), of T3, and of rat (r) bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), alone or in all possible combinations, promoted healing after an Achilles tendon injury in a rat model.
An Achilles tendon defect was produced in 24 6-8-week-old male inbred Lewis rats. The animals were then randomly divided into eight groups of three rats each. The tendon defect was filled with 50 μL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing (1) 50 μg/mL AA (AA group), (2) 10-7 M T3 (T3 group), (3) 4 × 106 rBMSCs (rBMSC group), (4) 50 μg/mL AA + 10-7 M T3 (AA + T3 group), (5) 4 × 106 rBMSCs + 50 μg/mL AA (rBMSC + AA group), (6) 4 × 106 rBMSCs + 10-7 M T3 (rBMSC + T3 group), (7) 4 × 106 rBMSCS + 50 μg/mL AA + 10-7 M T3 (rBMSC + AA + T3 group), and (8) PBS only (control group: CTRL). All treatments were administered by local injection immediately after the tendons had been damaged; additionally, AA was injected also on the second and fourth day from the first injection (for groups 1, 4, 5, and 7), and T3 was injected again every day for 4 days (for groups 2, 4, 6, and 7). At 30 days from initial treatment, tendon samples were harvested, and the quality of tendon repair was evaluated using histological and histomorphological analysis. The structure and morphology of the injured Achilles tendons were evaluated using the modified Svensson, Soslowsky, and Cook score, and the collagen type I and III ratio was calculated.
The group treated with AA combined with T3 displayed the lowest Svensson, Soslowsky, and Cook total score value of all tissue sections at histopathological examination, with fiber structure close to regular orientation, normal-like tendon vasculature, and no cartilage formation. AA + T3 also showed the highest collagen I and the lowest collagen III values compared to all other treatments including the CTRL.
There are potential benefits using a combination of AA and T3 to accelerate tendon healing.
Objective: To quantitatively and qualitatively describe some of the challenges faced by the Philippines' health insurance programme, PhilHealth, in the era of Universal Health Coverage. Methods: A descriptive study using a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods. Quantitative data were collected from various sources and semi-structured interviews were conducted among staff of relevant organisations. We focused particularly on the enrolment process among eligible individuals and the system of reimbursement in five local government units (LGUs). Results: The proportion of individuals enrolled as 'poor' exceeded the number officially assessed as being poor by 1-11 times in almost all of the LGUs evaluated. Interviews revealed 'politically indigent' individuals, i.e., the enrolment of non-poor individuals as poor. Several health centres were not receiving reimbursements from PhilHealth, likely due to structural and political deficiencies in the process of claiming and receiving reimbursements. Conclusion: The composition of the sponsored and indigent membership groups requires closer examination to determine whether people who are truly marginalised are left without health coverage. PhilHealth also needs to improve its reaccreditation and reimbursement systems and processes so that health centres can appreciate the benefits of becoming PhilHealth-accredited service providers.
Objectif : Décrire quantitativement et qualitativement certains des défis auxquels est confronté le programme d'assurance sociale santé des Philippines à l'ère de la couverture santé universelle.Méthodes : Etude descriptive recourant à un mélange de méthodes quantitatives et qualitatives. Les données quantitatives ont été recueillies grâce à des ressources variées et à des entretiens semi-structurés réalisés au sein du personnel des organisations concernées. Nous nous sommes particulièrement concentrés sur la procédure d'enrôlement des patients éligibles et sur le système de remboursement dans cinq unités gouvernementales locales (LGU) des Philippines.Résultats : Le ratio d'enrôlement de ceux identifiés comme « pauvres » a été multiplié par 1 à 11 dans presque toutes les LGU interviewées. L'analyse des entretiens a révélé une indigence « politique », aboutissant à l'enrôlement de non pauvres comme pauvres. Plusieurs centres de santé n'ont pas reçu de remboursement de PhilHealth, très probablement en raison de déficiences structurelles et politiques du processus de demande et de réception des remboursements.Conclusion : Un examen plus attentif du statut des personnes enrôlées pour être subventionnés et de l'affiliation en tant qu'indigent devrait être réalisé afin de déterminer si des personnes réellement marginalisées restent sans couverture. PhilHealth doit également améliorer les systèmes et processus de réaccréditation et de remboursement pour que les centres de santé apprécient le bénéfice de devenir prestataires de service accrédités de PhilHealth.
Objetivo: Describir de manera cuantitativa y cualitativa algunas de las dificultades que afronta el programa social de seguro de salud de Filipinas en la era de la cobertura de salud para todos.Métodos: Se realizó un estudio descriptivo con una combinación de métodos cuantitativos y cualitativos. Los datos cuantitativos se recogieron de varias fuentes y se llevaron a cabo entrevistas semiestructuradas a miembros del personal de organizaciones pertinentes. Se prestó una atención especial al procedimiento de inscripción de las personas aptas y al sistema de reembolso en cinco unidades gubernamentales locales (LGU) de Filipinas.Resultados: La proporción de inscripciones de personas calificadas como ‘pobres’ fue de 1 a 11 veces superior en todas las LGU encuestadas. El análisis de las entrevistas reveló que la definición ‘política’ de indigente llevó a la inscripción como pobres de personas no lo eran. Varios centros de salud no recibían reembolsos de PhilHealth, muy probablemente debido a deficiencias estructurales y políticas en el proceso solicitud y de recepción de los reembolsos.Conclusión: Es necesario practicar una investigación cuidadosa de la composición de los miembros inscritos en la categoría subvencionada o la categoría indigente, con el objeto de determinar si las personas realmente marginalizadas quedan sin cobertura. Asimismo, PhilHealth debe mejorar los sistemas y los procedimientos de reacreditación y de reembolso de los centros de salud, de manera que se puedan apreciar los beneficios que otorga a un prestador de atención de salud la acreditación por parte de este organismo.
While radioimmunotherapy (RIT) is a promising approach for the treatment of cancer, the long pharmacokinetic half-life of radiolabeled antibodies can result in high radiation doses to healthy tissues. Perhaps not surprisingly, several different strategies have been developed to circumvent this troubling limitation. One of the most promising of these approaches is pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (PRIT). PRIT is predicated on decoupling the radionuclide from the immunoglobulin, injecting them separately, and then allowing them to combine in vivo at the target tissue. This approach harnesses the exceptional tumor-targeting properties of antibodies while skirting their pharmacokinetic drawbacks, thereby lowering radiation doses to non-target tissues and facilitating the use of radionuclides with half-lives that are considered too short for use in traditional radioimmunoconjugates. Over the last five years, our laboratory and others have developed an approach to in vivo pretargeting based on the inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder (IEDDA) reaction between trans-cyclooctene (TCO) and tetrazine (Tz). This strategy has been successfully applied to pretargeted positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging with a variety of antibody-antigen systems. In a pair of recent publications, we have demonstrated the efficacy of IEDDA-based PRIT in murine models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and colorectal carcinoma. In this protocol, we describe protocols for PRIT using a 177Lu-DOTA-labeled tetrazine radioligand ([177Lu]Lu-DOTA-PEG7-Tz) and a TCO-modified variant of the colorectal cancer targeting huA33 antibody (huA33-TCO). More specifically, we will describe the construction of huA33-TCO, the synthesis and radiolabeling of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-PEG7-Tz, and the performance of in vivo biodistribution and longitudinal therapy studies in murine models of colorectal carcinoma.
Functional characterization of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) involves two steps, the first step is to convert DNA to protein and the second step is to visualize protein sequences with their structures. As massively parallel sequencing has emerged as a leading technology in genomics, resulting in a significant increase in data volume, direct visualization of SNVs together with associated protein sequences/structures in a new user interface (UI) would be a more effective way to assess their potential effects on protein function.
We have developed BioVR, an easy-to-use interactive, virtual reality (VR)-assisted platform for integrated visual analysis of DNA/RNA/protein sequences and protein structures using Unity3D and the C# programming language. It utilizes the cutting-edge Oculus Rift, and Leap Motion hand detection, resulting in intuitive navigation and exploration of various types of biological data. Using Gria2 and its associated gene product as an example, we present this proof-of-concept software to integrate protein and nucleic acid data. For any amino acid or nucleotide of interest in the Gria2 sequence, it can be quickly linked to its corresponding location on Gria2 protein structure and visualized within VR.
Using innovative 3D techniques, we provide a VR-based platform for visualization of DNA/RNA sequences and protein structures in aggregate, which can be extended to view omics data.
Background Inappropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator programming can be detrimental. Whether trials/recommendations informing best implantable cardioverter-defibrillator programming (high-rate cutoff and/or extended duration of detection) influence practice is unknown. Methods and Results We measured reaction to publication of MADIT-RIT (Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial-Reduce Inappropriate Therapy; 2012) and the Consensus Statement (2015) providing generic programming parameters, in a national cohort of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator recipients, using the ALTITUDE database (Boston Scientific). Yearly changes in programmed parameters to either trial-specified or class 1 recommended parameters (≥185 beats per minute or delay ≥6 seconds) were assessed in parallel. From 2008 to 2017, 232 982 patients (aged 67±13 years; 28% women) were analyzed. Prevalence of MADIT- RIT -specific settings before publication was &lt;1%, increasing to 13.6% in the year following. Thereafter, this increased by &lt;6% over 5 years. Among preexisting implants (91 171), most patients (58 739 [64.4%]) underwent at least 1 in-person device reprogramming after trial publication, but &lt;2% were reprogrammed to MADIT - RIT settings. Notably, prevalence of programming to ≥185 beats per minute or delay ≥6 seconds was increased by MADIT - RIT (57.4% in 2013 versus 40.2% at baseline), but the following publication of recommendations had minor incremental effect (73.2% in 2016 versus 70.8% in 2015). High-rate cutoff programming was favored almost 2-fold compared with extended duration throughout the test period. Practice changes demonstrated large interhospital and interstate variations. Conclusions Trial publication had an immediate effect during 1 year postpublication, but absolute penetration was low, and amplified little with time. Consensus recommendations had a negligible effect. However, generic programming was exercised more widely, and increased after trial publication, but not following recommendations.
Adenocarcinoma of the lung is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Here we report molecular profiling of 230 resected lung adenocarcinomas using messenger RNA, microRNA and DNA sequencing integrated with copy number, methylation and proteomic analyses. High rates of somatic mutation were seen (mean 8.9 mutations per megabase). Eighteen genes were statistically significantly mutated, including RIT1 activating mutations and newly described loss-of-function MGA mutations which are mutually exclusive with focal MYC amplification. EGFR mutations were more frequent in female patients, whereas mutations in RBM10 were more common in males. Aberrations in NF1, MET, ERBB2 and RIT1 occurred in 13% of cases and were enriched in samples otherwise lacking an activated oncogene, suggesting a driver role for these events in certain tumours. DNA and mRNA sequence from the same tumour highlighted splicing alterations driven by somatic genomic changes, including exon 14 skipping in MET mRNA in 4% of cases. MAPK and PI(3)K pathway activity, when measured at the protein level, was explained by known mutations in only a fraction of cases, suggesting additional, unexplained mechanisms of pathway activation. These data establish a foundation for classification and further investigations of lung adenocarcinoma molecular pathogenesis. 
Variants in 11 genes of the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway have been causally linked to the neuro-cardio-facio-cutaneous syndromes group (NCFCS). Recently, A2ML1 and RIT1 were also associated with these syndromes. Because of the genetic and clinical heterogeneity of NCFCS, it is challenging to define strategies for their molecular diagnosis. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a massive parallel sequencing (MPS)-based strategy for the molecular diagnosis of NCFCS. A multiplex PCR-based strategy for the enrichment of the 13 genes and a variant prioritization pipeline was established. Two sets of genomic DNA samples were studied using the Ion PGM System: (1) training set (n =15) to optimize the strategy and (2) validation set (n = 20) to validate and evaluate the power of the new methodology. Sanger sequencing was performed to confirm all variants and low covered regions. All variants identified by Sanger sequencing were detected with our MPS approach. The methodology resulted in an experimental approach with a specificity of 99.0% and a maximum analytical sensitivity of ≥ 98.2% with a confidence of 99%. Importantly, two patients (out of 20) harbored described disease-causing variants in genes that are not routinely tested (RIT1 and SHOC2). The addition of less frequently altered genes increased in ≈ 10% the diagnostic yield of the strategy currently used. The presented workflow provides a comprehensive genetic screening strategy for patients with NCFCS in a fast and cost-efficient manner. This approach demonstrates the potential of a combined MPS-Sanger sequencing-based strategy as an effective diagnostic tool for heterogeneous diseases.
Iron (Fe)-deficiency is a common abiotic stress in Pisum sativum L. grown in many parts of the world. The aim of the study was to investigate variation in tolerance to Fe deficiency in two pea genotypes, Santi (Fe-efficient) and Parafield (Fe-inefficient). Fe deficiency caused greater declines in chlorophyll score, leaf Fe concentration and root-shoot development in Parafield compared to Santi, suggesting greater Fe-efficiency in Santi. Fe chelate reductase activity and ethylene production were increased in the roots of Santi and to a lesser extent in Parafield under Fe deficiency, while proton extrusion was only occurred in Santi. Moreover, expression of the Fe chelate reductase gene, FRO1, and Fe transporter, RIT1 were upregulated in Fe-deficient roots of Santi. Expression of HA1 (proton extrusion) was also significantly higher in Santi when compared to Parafield grown in Fe-deficient conditions. Furthermore, the application of the ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor, 1-aminoisobutyric acid reduced the Fe chelate reductase activity, supporting a direct role for ethylene in its induction. A significant increase in root citrate was only observed in Santi under Fe deficiency indicating a role for citrate in the Fe-efficiency mechanism. Taken together, our physiological and molecular data indicate that genotypic variation in tolerance to Fe deficiency in Santi and Parafield plants is a result of variation in a number of Strategy I mechanisms and also suggest a direct role for ethylene in Fe reductase activity. The pea cultivar, Santi provides a new source of Fe-efficiency that can be exploited to breed more Fe-efficient peas.
Cytoplasmic initiator tRNAs from plants and fungi are excluded from participating in translational elongation by the presence of a unique 2'-phosphoribosyl modification of purine 64, introduced posttranscriptionally by the enzyme Rit1p. Members of the Rit1p family show no obvious similarity to other proteins or domains, there is no structural information available to guide experimental analyses, and the mechanism of action of this enzyme remains a mystery. Using protein fold recognition, we identified a phosphatase-like domain in the C-terminal part of Rit1p. A comparative model of the C-terminal domain was constructed and used to predict the function of conserved residues and to propose the mechanism of action of Rit1p. The model will facilitate experimental analyses of Rit1p and its interactions with the initiator tRNA substrate.
Iwr1, a protein conserved throughout eukaryotes, was originally identified by its physical interaction with RNA polymerase (Pol) II.
Here, we identify Iwr1 in a genetic screen designed to uncover proteins involved in Pol III transcription in S. cerevisiae. Iwr1 is important for Pol III transcription, because an iwr1 mutant strain shows reduced association of TBP and Pol III at Pol III promoters, a decreased rate of Pol III transcription, and lower steady-state levels of Pol III transcripts. Interestingly, an iwr1 mutant strain also displays reduced association of TBP to Pol I-transcribed genes and of both TBP and Pol II to Pol II-transcribed promoters. Despite this, rRNA and mRNA levels are virtually unaffected, suggesting a post-transcriptional mechanism compensating for the occupancy defect.
Thus, Iwr1 plays an important role in preinitiation complex formation by all three nuclear RNA polymerases.
Autism is a severe disorder that involves both genetic and environmental factors. Expression profiling of the superior temporal gyrus of six autistic subjects and matched controls revealed increased transcript levels of many immune system-related genes. We also noticed changes in transcripts related to cell communication, differentiation, cell cycle regulation and chaperone systems. Critical expression changes were confirmed by qPCR (BCL6, CHI3L1, CYR61, IFI16, IFITM3, MAP2K3, PTDSR, RFX4, SPP1, RELN, NOTCH2, RIT1, SFN, GADD45B, HSPA6, HSPB8 and SERPINH1). Overall, these expression patterns appear to be more associated with the late recovery phase of autoimmune brain disorders, than with the innate immune response characteristic of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, a variance-based analysis revealed much greater transcript variability in brains from autistic subjects compared to the control group, suggesting that these genes may represent autism susceptibility genes and should be assessed in follow-up genetic studies.
Bcl11b/Rit1 is involved in T-cell development and undergoes chromosomal rearrangements in human T-cell leukemias. Thymocytes of Bcl11b(-/-) newborn mice exhibit apoptosis at a certain developmental stage when thymocytes re-enter into the cell-cycle. Here, we show that Bcl11b-knockdown T-cell lines, when exposed to growth stimuli, exhibited apoptosis at the S phase with concomitant decreases in a cell-cycle inhibitor, p27 and an antiapoptotic protein, Bcl-xL, owing to transcriptional repression. This repression was a likely consequence of the impairment of Sirt1, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent deacetylase associating with Bcl11b. Activation of the apoptotic process cleaved the mediator protein, Claspin, and inhibited phosphorylation of cell-cycle checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) that plays a central role in sensing and responding to incomplete replication. Bcl11b(-/-) thymocytes also failed to phosphorylate Chk1 when UV irradiated. These results implicate Bcl11b in the remedy for DNA replication stress and maintenance of genomic integrity.
In the Medicago truncatula/Sinorhizobium meliloti symbiosis, the plant undergoes a series of developmental changes simultaneously, creating a root nodule and allowing bacterial entry and differentiation. Our studies of plant genes reveal novel transcriptional regulation during the establishment of the symbiosis and identify molecular markers that distinguish classes of plant and bacterial symbiotic mutants. We have identified three symbiotically regulated plant genes encoding a beta,1-3 endoglucanase (MtBGLU1), a lectin (MtLEC4), and a cysteine-containing protein (MtN31). MtBGLU1 is down-regulated in the plant 24 h after exposure to the bacterial signal, Nod factor. The non-nodulating plant mutant dmi1 is defective in the ability to down-regulate MtBGLU1. MtLEC4 and MtN31 are induced 1 and 2 weeks after bacterial inoculation, respectively. We examined the regulation of these two genes and three previously identified genes (MtCAM1, ENOD2, and MtLB1) in plant symbiotic mutants and wild-type plants inoculated with bacterial symbiotic mutants. Plant (bit1, rit1, and Mtsym1) and bacterial (exoA and exoH) mutants with defects in the initial stages of invasion are unable to induce MtLEC4, MtN31, MtCAM1, ENOD2, and MtLB1. Bacterial mutants (fixJ and nifD) and a subset of plant mutants (dnf2, dnf3, dnf4, dnf6, and dnf7) defective for nitrogen fixation induce the above genes. The bacA bacterial mutant, which senesces upon deposition into plant cells, and two plant mutants with defects in nitrogen fixation (dnf1 and dnf5) induce MtLEC4 and ENOD2 but not MtN31, MtCAM1, or MtLB1. These data suggest the presence of at least three transcriptionally distinct developmental stages during invasion of M. truncatula by S. meliloti.
Fe uptake in dicotyledonous plants is mediated by a root plasma membrane-bound ferric reductase that reduces extracellular Fe(III)-chelates, releasing Fe(2+) ions, which are then absorbed via a metal ion transporter. We previously showed that Fe deficiency induces an increased capacity to absorb Fe and other micronutrient and heavy metals such as Zn(2+) and Cd(2+) into pea ( Pisum sativum L.) roots [Cohen et al. (1998) Plant Physiol 116:1063-1072). To investigate the molecular basis for this phenomenon, an Fe-regulated transporter that is a homologue of the Arabidopsis IRT1 micronutrient transporter was isolated from pea seedlings. This cDNA clone, designated RIT1 for root iron transporter, encodes a 348 amino acid polypeptide with eight putative membrane-spanning domains that is induced under Fe deficiency and can functionally complement yeast mutants defective in high- and low-affinity Fe transport. Chelate buffer techniques were used to control Fe(2+) in the uptake solution at nanomolar activities representative of those found in the rhizosphere, and radiotracer methodologies were employed to show that RIT1 is a very high-affinity (59)Fe(2+) uptake system ( K(m) =54-93 nM). Additionally, radiotracer ((65)Zn, (109)Cd) flux techniques were used to show that RIT can also mediate a lower affinity Zn and Cd influx ( K(m) of 4 and 100 microM, for Zn(2+) and Cd(2+), respectively). These findings suggest that, in typical agricultural soils, RIT1 functions primarily as a high-affinity Fe(2+) transporter that mediates root Fe acquisition. This is consistent with recent findings with Arabidopsis IRT1 knockout mutants that strongly suggest that this transporter plays a key role in root Fe uptake and nutrition. However, the ability of RIT1 to facilitate Zn and Cd uptake when these metals are present at elevated concentrations suggests that RIT1 may be one pathway for the entry of toxic metals into the food chain. Furthermore, the finding that plant Fe deficiency status may promote heavy metal uptake via increased expression of this transporter could have implications both for human nutrition and also for phytoremediation, the use of terrestrial plants to sequester toxic metals from contaminated soil.
The Ras/mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is essential in the regulation of cell cycle, differentiation, growth, cell senescence and apoptosis, all of which are critical to normal development. A class of neurodevelopmental disorders, RASopathies, is caused by germline mutations in genes of the Ras/MAPK pathway. Through the use of whole exome sequencing and targeted sequencing of selected genes in cohorts of panel-negative RASopathy patients, several new genes have been identified. These include: RIT1, SOS2, RASA2, RRAS and SYNGAP1, that likely represent new, albeit rare, causative RASopathy genes. In addition, A2ML1, LZTR1, MYST4, SPRY1 and MAP3K8 may represent new rare genes for RASopathies, but, additional functional studies regarding the mutations are warranted. In addition, recent reports have demonstrated that chromosomal copy number variation in regions encompassing Ras/MAPK pathway genes may be a novel pathogenetic mechanism expanding the RASopathies.
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an intractable neurodegenerative disease afflicting 1 in 6-10,000 live births. One of the key functions of the SMN protein is regulation of spliceosome assembly. Reduced levels of the SMN protein that are observed in SMA have been shown to result in aberrant mRNA splicing. SMN-dependent mis-spliced transcripts in motor neurons may cause stresses that are particularly harmful and may serve as potential targets for the treatment of motor neuron disease or as biomarkers in the SMA patient population. We performed deep RNA sequencing using motor neuron-like NSC-34 cells to screen for SMN-dependent mRNA processing changes that occur following acute depletion of SMN. We identified SMN-dependent splicing changes, including an intron retention event that results in the production of a truncated Rit1 transcript. This intron-retained transcript is stable and is mis-spliced in spinal cord from symptomatic SMA mice. Constitutively active Rit1 ameliorated the neurite outgrowth defect in SMN depleted NSC-34 cells, while expression of the truncated protein product of the mis-spliced Rit1 transcript inhibited neurite extension. These results reveal new insights into the biological consequence of SMN-dependent splicing in motor neuron-like cells.
Cadmium (Cd) is an important phytotoxic element causing health hazards. This work investigates whether and how silicon (Si) influences the alleviation of Cd toxicity in field peas at biochemical and molecular level. The addition of Si in Cd-stressed plants noticeably increased growth and development as well as total protein and membrane stability of Cd-stressed plants, suggesting that Si does have critical roles in Cd detoxification in peas. Furthermore, Si supplementation in Cd-stressed plants showed simultaneous significant increase and decrease of Cd and Fe in roots and shoots, respectively, compared with Cd-stressed plants. At molecular level, GSH1 (phytochelatin precursor) and MTA (metallothionein) transcripts predominantly expressed in roots and strongly induced due to Si supplementation in Cd-stressed plants compared with Cd-free conditions, suggesting that these chelating agents may bind to Cd leading to vacuolar sequestration in roots. Furthermore, pea Fe transporter (RIT1) showed downregulation in shoots when plants were treated with Si along with Cd compared with Cd-treated conditions. It is consistent with the physiological observations and supports the conclusion that alleviation of Cd toxicity in pea plants might be associated with Cd sequestration in roots and reduced Cd translocation in shoots through the regulation of Fe transport. Furthermore, increased CAT, POD, SOD and GR activity along with elevated S-metabolites (cysteine, methionine, glutathione) implies the active involvement of ROS scavenging and plays, at least in part, to the Si-mediated alleviation of Cd toxicity in pea. The study provides first mechanistic evidence on the beneficial effect of Si on Cd toxicity in pea plants.
The small molecule APR-246 (PRIMA-1(MET) ) is a novel drug that restores the activity of mutated and unfolded TP53 protein. However, the mechanisms of action and potential off-target effects are not fully understood. Gene expression profiling in TP53 mutant KMB3 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells showed that genes which protected cells from oxidative stress to be the most up-regulated. APR-246 exposure also induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and depleted glutathione in AML cells. The genes most up-regulated by APR-246, confirmed by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction, were heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1, also termed HO-1), SLC7A11 and RIT1. Up-regulation of HMOX1, a key regulator of cellular response to ROS, was independent of TP53 mutational status. NFE2L2 (also termed Nrf2), a master regulator of HMOX1 expression, showed transcriptional up-regulation and nuclear translocation by APR-246. Down-regulation of NFE2L2 by siRNA in AML cells significantly increased the antitumoural effects of APR-246. The PI3K inhibitor wortmannin and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin inhibited APR-246-induced nuclear translocation of NFE2L2 and counteracted the protective cellular responses to APR-246, resulting in synergistic cell killing together with APR-246. In conclusion, ROS induction is important for antileukaemic activities of APR-246 and inhibiting the protective response of the Nrf-2/HMOX1 axis using PI3K inhibitors, enhances the antileukaemic effects.
Noonan syndrome (NS) is characterized by characteristic facies, short stature, congenital heart defect, and developmental delay of variable degree. Other findings can include broad or webbed neck, unusual chest shape with superior pectus carinatum and inferior pectus excavatum, cryptorchidism, varied coagulation defects, lymphatic dysplasias, and ocular abnormalities. Although birth length is usually normal, final adult height approaches the lower limit of normal. Congenital heart disease occurs in 50%-80% of individuals. Pulmonary valve stenosis, often with dysplasia, is the most common heart defect and is found in 20%-50% of individuals. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, found in 20%-30% of individuals, may be present at birth or develop in infancy or childhood. Other structural defects include atrial and ventricular septal defects, branch pulmonary artery stenosis, and tetralogy of Fallot. Up to one fourth of affected individuals have mild intellectual disability, and language impairments in general are more common in NS than in the general population.
NS is diagnosed on clinical grounds by observation of key features. Affected individuals have normal chromosome studies. Molecular genetic testing identifies a pathogenic variant in PTPN11 in 50% of affected individuals, SOS1 in approximately 13%, RAF1 and RIT1 each in 5%, and KRAS in fewer than 5%. Other genes in which pathogenic variants have been reported to cause Noonan syndrome in fewer than 1% of cases include NRAS, BRAF, and MAP2K1. Several additional genes associated with a Noonan-syndrome-like phenotype in fewer than ten individuals have been identified.
Treatment of manifestations: Cardiovascular anomalies in NS are usually treated as in the general population. Developmental disabilities are addressed by early intervention programs and individualized education strategies. Treatment for serious bleeding is guided by knowledge of the specific factor deficiency or platelet aggregation anomaly. Growth hormone (GH) treatment increases growth velocity. Surveillance: Monitoring of anomalies found in any system, especially cardiovascular abnormalities.
NS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Although many individuals with NS have a de novo pathogenic variant, an affected parent is recognized in 30%-75% of families. The risk to sibs of a proband depends on the genetic status of the parents. If a parent is affected, the risk is 50%. When the parents are clinically unaffected, the risk to the sibs of a proband appears to be low (&lt;1%). Each child of an individual with Noonan syndrome has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing is possible if the NS-related pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member.
Oncogenic driver mutations activating receptor tyrosine kinase pathways are promising predictive markers for targeted treatment. We investigated the mutation profile of an updated driver events list on receptor tyrosine kinase/RAS/PI3K axis and the clinicopathologic implications in a cohort of never-smoker predominated Chinese lung adenocarcinoma.
We tested 154 lung adenocarcinomas and adenosquamous carcinomas for EGFR, KRAS, HER2, BRAF, PIK3CA, MET, NRAS, MAP2K1, and RIT1 mutations by polymerase chain reaction-direct sequencing. MET amplification and ALK and ROS1 translocations were assessed by fluorescent in situ hybridizations. MET and thyroid transcription factor-1 protein expressions were investigated by immunohistochemistry.
Seventy percent of lung adenocarcinomas carried actionable driver events. Alterations on EGFR (43%), KRAS (11.4%), ALK (6%), and MET (5.4%) were frequently found. ROS1 translocation and mutations involving BRAF, HER2, NRAS, and PIK3CA were also detected. No mutation was observed in RIT1 and MAP2K1. Patients with EGFR mutations had a favorable prognosis, whereas those with MET mutations had poorer overall survival. Multivariate analysis further demonstrated that MET mutation was an independent prognostic factor. Although MET protein expression was detected in 65% of lung adenocarcinoma, only 10% of the MET-immunohistochemistry positive tumors harbor MET DNA alterations that drove protein overexpression. Appropriate predictive biomarker is essential for selecting patients who might benefit from specific targeted therapy.
Actionable driver events can be detected in two thirds of lung adenocarcinoma. MET DNA alterations define a subset of patients with aggressive diseases that might potentially benefit from anti-MET targeted therapy. High negative predictive values of thyroid transcription factor-1 and MET expression suggest potential roles as surrogate markers for EGFR and/or MET mutations.
Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders with high heritability. Recent findings support a highly heterogeneous and complex genetic etiology including rare de novo and inherited mutations or chromosomal rearrangements as well as double or multiple hits.
We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) and blood cell transcriptome by RNAseq in a subset of male patients with idiopathic ASD (n = 36) in order to identify causative genes, transcriptomic alterations, and susceptibility variants.
We detected likely monogenic causes in seven cases: five de novo (SCN2A, MED13L, KCNV1, CUL3, and PTEN) and two inherited X-linked variants (MAOA and CDKL5). Transcriptomic analyses allowed the identification of intronic causative mutations missed by the usual filtering of WES and revealed functional consequences of some rare mutations. These included aberrant transcripts (PTEN, POLR3C), deregulated expression in 1.7% of mutated genes (that is, SEMA6B, MECP2, ANK3, CREBBP), allele-specific expression (FUS, MTOR, TAF1C), and non-sense-mediated decay (RIT1, ALG9). The analysis of rare inherited variants showed enrichment in relevant pathways such as the PI3K-Akt signaling and the axon guidance.
Integrative analysis of WES and blood RNAseq data has proven to be an efficient strategy to identify likely monogenic forms of ASD (19% in our cohort), as well as additional rare inherited mutations that can contribute to ASD risk in a multifactorial manner. Blood transcriptomic data, besides validating 88% of expressed variants, allowed the identification of missed intronic mutations and revealed functional correlations of genetic variants, including changes in splicing, expression levels, and allelic expression.
Noonan syndrome (NS) and related disorders, which are now summarized under the term RASopathies, are caused by germline mutations in genes encoding protein components of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. In this study, we evaluated the clinical and molecular spectrum of 21 Tunisian patients, recruited by a cardiology unit, for whom RASopathy diagnosis was suspected by clinical geneticists. Overall, 19 patients had a clinical diagnosis of NS and 2 were classified as having Cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) syndrome. In 52% (n = 11) of patients, a RASopathy has been molecularly confirmed. Mutations in PTPN11 and SOS1 genes were found in patients with diagnosis of NS and BRAF gene mutations in patients with CFC syndrome. As reported from other cohorts, mutations in exons 3 and 8 of the PTPN11 gene predominated in Tunisian NS patients. A very uncommon PTPN11 mutation c.5C&gt;T (p.T2I), the functional consequences of which have so far remained unclear, was identified in one patient. As biased by the mode of recruitment, all patients included in this study had a congenital heart defect, with pulmonary valve stenosis being the most frequent one. Short stature and developmental abnormalities were present in mutation-positive cases. This is the first molecular study in patients from southern Tunisia with RASopathy diagnosis. 
Mutations of the small RAS GTPase RIT1 disrupt its negative regulation by LZTR1.
Noonan syndrome (NS) is a genetic disorder characterized by short stature, a distinctive facial appearance, and heart defects. We recently discovered a novel NS gene, RIT1, which is a member of the RAS subfamily of small GTPases. NS patients with RIT1 mutations have a high incidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and edematous phenotype, but the specific role of RIT1 remains unclear.
To investigate how germline RIT1 mutations cause NS, we generated knock-in mice that carried a NS-associated Rit1 A57G mutation (Rit1A57G/+). We investigated the phenotypes of Rit1A57G/+ mice in fetal and adult stages as well as the effects of isoproterenol on cardiac function in Rit1A57G/+ mice.
Rit1A57G/+ embryos exhibited decreased viability, edema, subcutaneous hemorrhage and AKT activation. Surviving Rit1A57G/+ mice had a short stature, craniofacial abnormalities and splenomegaly. Cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis with increased expression of S100A4, vimentin and periostin were observed in Rit1A57G/+ mice compared to Rit1+/+ mice. Upon isoproterenol stimulation, cardiac fibrosis was drastically increased in Rit1A57G/+ mice. Phosphorylated (at Thr308) AKT levels were also elevated in isoproterenol-treated Rit1A57G/+ hearts.
The A57G mutation in Rit1 causes cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and other NS-associated features. Biochemical analysis indicates that the AKT signaling pathway might be related to downstream signaling in the RIT1 A57G mutant at a developmental stage and under β-adrenergic stimulation in the heart. FUND: The Grants-in-Aid were provided by the Practical Research Project for Rare/Intractable Diseases from the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development, the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI Grant.
RIT1 oncoproteins have emerged as an etiologic factor in Noonan syndrome and cancer. Despite the resemblance of RIT1 to other members of the Ras small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases), mutations affecting RIT1 are not found in the classic hotspots but rather in a region near the switch II domain of the protein. We used an isogenic germline knock-in mouse model to study the effects of RIT1 mutation at the organismal level, which resulted in a phenotype resembling Noonan syndrome. By mass spectrometry, we detected a RIT1 interactor, leucine zipper-like transcription regulator 1 (LZTR1), that acts as an adaptor for protein degradation. Pathogenic mutations affecting either RIT1 or LZTR1 resulted in incomplete degradation of RIT1. This led to RIT1 accumulation and dysregulated growth factor signaling responses. Our results highlight a mechanism of pathogenesis that relies on impaired protein degradation of the Ras GTPase RIT1.
Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal dominant disorder that belongs to a group of developmental disorders called RASopathies with overlapping features and multiple causative genes. The aim of the study was to identify mutations underlying this disorder in patients from Southeast Asia and characterize their clinical presentations.
Patients were identified from the hospital's Genetics clinics after assessment by attending clinical geneticists. A targeted gene panel was used for next-generation sequencing on genomic DNA extracted from the blood samples of 17 patients.
Heterozygous missense variants were identified in 13 patients: eight were in PTPN11, three in SOS1, and one each in RIT1 and KRAS. All are known variants that have been reported in patients with NS. Of the 13 patients with identified variants, 10 had short stature, the most common feature for NS. Four of the eight patients with PTPN11 variants had atrial septal defect. Only two had pulmonary stenosis which is reported to be common for PTPN11 mutation carriers. Another two had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a feature which is negatively associated with PTPN11 mutations.
Our study provides the mutation and phenotypic spectrum of NS from a new population group. The molecular testing yield of 76% is similar to other studies and shows that the targeted panel approach is useful for identifying genetic mutations in NS which has multiple causative genes. The molecular basis for the phenotypes of the remaining patients remains unknown and would need to be uncovered via sequencing of additional genes or other investigative methods.
The RASopathies are a class of developmental disorders caused by germline mutations in the RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has been frequently described in children with RASopathy, but only a minority of patients have received formal genotyping. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the genetic basis and clinical outcome of pediatric patients with RASopathy-associated HCM.
We retrospectively reviewed the mutation spectrum and clinical outcome of all the patients with RASopathy derived from 168 pediatric HCM cases referred to our institution between January 2012 and July 2018.
A heterozygous missense mutation in one of known RASopathy genes was identified in 46 unrelated children with HCM. Mutations in the PTPN11 gene were the most prevalent (19/46); this was followed by mutations in RAF1 (11/46), KRAS (5/46), RIT1 (4/46), BRAF (3/46), SOS1 (2/46), HRAS (1/46), and SHOC2 (1/46). Moreover, two compound heterozygous missense mutations in the LZTR1 gene were identified in one patient with the Noonan syndrome phenotype and HCM. The median age at the diagnosis of HCM was 3.0 months (range 0 months to 8.1 years). Twenty-one of the patients had significant left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and 32 had concomitant congenital heart disease. Three patients with a mutation in exon 13 of the PTPN11 gene died of cardiac failure at the ages of 3.0, 3.5, and 6.0 months. The remaining 44 patients were alive after an average follow-up time of 3.9 years (0.5 to 17.1 years, median 2.9 years) from the initial diagnosis of HCM, including 5 patients with spontaneous regression of their cardiac hypertrophy.
RASopathy-associated HCM is a heterogeneous genetic condition characterized by early-onset cardiac hypertrophy and a high prevalence of co-existing congenital heart disease, which is most frequently related to specific mutations in the PTPN11 gene. Rapidly progressive HCM, resulting in an early death, is uncommon in RASopathy patients except those with specific mutations in exon 13 of the PTPN11 gene.
This study aimed to identify the cancer stem cell specific biomarkers that can be effective candidate prognosticators of oral squamous cell carcinoma.
Microarray-based meta-analysis derived transcriptional profile of head and neck cancers was compared with the Cancer Stem Cell database to arrive at a subset of markers. This subset was further co-related with clinico-pathological parameters, recurrence and survival of oral cancer patients (n = 313) in The Cancer Genome Atlas database and in oral cancer (n = 28) patients.
Meta-analysis in combination with database comparison identified a panel of 221 genes specific to head and neck cancers. Correlation of expression levels of these markers in the oral cancer cohort of The Cancer Genome Atlas (n = 313) with treatment outcome identified 54 genes (p &lt; 0.05 or fold change &gt;2) associated with disease recurrence, 8 genes (NQO1, UBE2C, EDNRB, FKBP4, STAT3, HOXA1, RIT1, AURKA) being significant with high fold change. Assessment of the efficacy of the subset (n = 54) as survival predictors identified an additional 4 genes (CDK1, GINS2, PHF5 A, ERBB2) that co-related with poor disease-free survival (p &lt; 0.05). CDK1 showed a significant association with the clinical stage, margin status and with advanced pathological parameters. Initial patient validation indicated that CDK1 and NQO1 significantly co-related with the poor disease-free and overall survival (p &lt; 0.05).
This panel of oral cancer specific, cancer stem cell associated markers identified in this study, a subset of which was validated, will be of clinical benefit subject to large scale validation studies.
The study sought to explore novel genetic aberration driving squamous cell lung carcinoma (LUSC). The whole exome (WES), whole genome (WGS) and target region (TS) sequencings and CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing techniques were integrated to explore and validate novel targeting candidates from LUSC primary tumors and corresponding patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Seven genes (FGFR2, GRM1,PIK3CG, PIK3CA,ZFHX4, CSMD3, GRM8) with high frequencies of both single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and copy number variants (CNVs), and two genes (CLDN1 and RIT1) only with CNVs were identified by bioinformatics analysis. The functions of these candidates were validated through CRISPR-Cas9 system in primary PDX cells. Furthermore, we focused on the genetic and functional analysis of Metabotropic glutamate receptor 8 (GRM8), whose transcriptional activation was elucidated to promote the survival of LUSC tumor cell through inhibiting cAMP pathway and activating MAPK pathway. The SNV identified in GRM8, A112G, activated downstream signaling pathway and induced cell proliferation, which could be reversed by cAMP stimulator and MEK inhibitor. In conclusion, the components of GRM8 signaling pathway could serve as potential targets of squamous cell lung cancer carrying GRM8 activating variants.
Ras-like without CAAX1 (RIT1) protein is a member of Ras family, which plays critical roles in signaling pathways and cellular process regulation. However, the role of RIT1 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is unclear. In this study, we found that the expression of RIT1 is downregulated in ESCC compared to corresponding non-tumor tissues. The low-level expression of RIT1 was correlated with poorer prognosis. Then we showed that RIT1 inhibited proliferation, invasion, and migration of ESCC cells, and silencing RIT1 by shRNA promoted tumorigenicity and metastasis in nude mice. We further demonstrated that RIT1 inhibited the malignant behaviors of ESCC through inhibiting the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in ESCC cells. Our study also revealed that RIT1 increased drug sensitivity to cisplatin (CDDP), and this function could be carried out through downregulating stemness of ESCC. In conclusion, our study indicates for the first time that RIT1 displays tumor-suppressing functions in ESCC, and these functions were carried out by inhibiting MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, inhibiting EMT, and downregulating cancer stemness of ESCC cells.
Objective: To investigate the clinical and genetic characteristics of a Chinese boy with Verheij syndrome and review the literature. Methods: The clinical and genetic data of a Chinese boy with Verheij syndrome, who was admitted to the Department of Pediatrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology in May 2017 were analyzed. Original papers on Verheij syndrome published up to January 2018 were retrieved at PubMed, Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD), Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man(OMIM), CNKI and WanFang databases by using the key words "Verheij syndrome" and "PUF60" . Results: The male patient (at the age of 14 years and 3 months) visited us because of growth retardation for 13 years. Atrial septal defect was repaired at the age 3. Congenital amblyopia and hyperopia were diagnosed at the age 4. On physical examination, serious growth retardation and delayed psychomotor development was noted. His height was 142.5 cm (-3.26 SDS). He had poor academic performance at school. Facial features included: webbed neck, hypertelorism, down-slanting palpebral fissures, long philtrum, thin upper lip, and high palate. Palmar crease was found in the right hand. His bone age was 10 years. Growth hormone stimulation test indicated partial growth hormone deficiency (growth hormone (GH) peak 6.63 μg/L). The level of insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and insulin like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) was lower than normal, 73.20 μg/L and 2 500 μg/L respectively. Abdominal ultrasound showed that the volumes of bilateral kidneys were small. The size of the left and right kidney was 8.5 cm × 3.3 cm and 8.4 cm × 4.3 cm respectively. Karyotype was normal (46, XY). MRI of pituitary showed partial empty sella turcica. Ten genes associated with Noonan syndrome (PTPN11, SOS1, RASA2, KRAS, RAF1, NRAS, SHOC2, BRAF, RIT1, A2ML1) were analyzed and no genetic mutations were found. Whole exome-sequencing analysis identified a de novo heterozygous frame shift mutation of PUF60 gene (c.931_934del, P.P.T 311Qfs*47). According to ACMG guidelines in 2015, the mutation is pathogenic and has not been reported in the above databases. Conclusions: This is the first case report of Verheij syndrome caused by mutation of PUF60 gene in Chinese population. It is difficult to discriminate Verheij syndrome from Noonan syndrome, both have clinical manifestations such as severe growth retardation, psychomotor retardation, and congenital heart disease. In addition to Noonan syndrome, PUF60 genetic analysis was recommended for avoiding missed diagnosis with such clinical manifestations of patients.

To provide information on the scope of cardiac disease in Noonan syndrome.
Noonan syndrome is a common autosomal dominant RASopathy disorder characterized by clinical findings of facial dysmorphism, congenital heart disease, and short stature. The degree of genetic heterogeneity has recently become evident in that Noonan syndrome is now known to be caused by mutations in a large variety of genes which produce dysregulation of the RAS-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathway. The scope of cardiac disease in Noonan syndrome is quite variable depending on the gene mutation, with some mutations usually associated with a high incidence of congenital heart defects (PTPN11, KRAS, and others) while those with predominantly hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) have higher risk and morbidity profiles (RAF1, RIT1, and those associated with multiple lentigines).
Cardiac disease in Noonan syndrome varies according to the type of gene mutation. The most common forms of cardiac disease include pulmonary stenosis, HCM, and atrial septal defect. HCM in general is associated with increased risk, mortality, and morbidity. New concepts for potential treatments are discussed.
Purpose: Despite initial benefit from tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring ALK (ALK+) and ROS1 (ROS1+) gene fusions ultimately progress. Here, we report on the potential resistance mechanisms in a series of patients with ALK+ and ROS1+ NSCLC progressing on different types and/or lines of ROS1/ALK-targeted therapy.Experimental Design: We used a combination of next-generation sequencing (NGS), multiplex mutation assay, direct DNA sequencing, RT-PCR, and FISH to identify fusion variants/partners and copy-number gain (CNG), kinase domain mutations (KDM), and copy-number variations (CNVs) in other cancer-related genes. We performed testing on 12 ROS1+ and 43 ALK+ patients.Results: One of 12 ROS1+ (8%) and 15 of 43 (35%) ALK

                     patients harbored KDM. In the ROS1+ cohort, we identified KIT and β-catenin mutations and HER2-mediated bypass signaling as non-ROS1-dominant resistance mechanisms. In the ALK+ cohort, we identified a novel NRG1 gene fusion, a RET fusion, 2 EGFR, and 3 KRAS mutations, as well as mutations in IDH1, RIT1, NOTCH, and NF1 In addition, we identified CNV in multiple proto-oncogenes genes including PDGFRA, KIT, KDR, GNAS, K/HRAS, RET, NTRK1, MAP2K1, and others.Conclusions: We identified a putative TKI resistance mechanism in six of 12 (50%) ROS1

                     patients and 37 of 43 (86%) ALK+ patients. Our data suggest that a focus on KDMs will miss most resistance mechanisms; broader gene testing strategies and functional validation is warranted to devise new therapeutic strategies for drug resistance.

Many studies have shown that molecular karyotyping is an effective diagnostic tool in individuals with developmental delay/intellectual disability. We report on a de novo interstitial 1q22q23.1 microdeletion, 1.6 Mb in size, detected in a patient with short stature, microcephaly, hypoplastic corpus callosum, cleft palate, minor facial anomalies, congenital heart defect, camptodactyly of the 4-5th fingers, and intellectual disability. Chromosomal microarray analysis revealed a 1.6-Mb deletion in the 1q22q23.1 region, arr[GRCh37] 1q22q23.1(155630752_157193893)×1. Real-time PCR analysis confirmed its de novo origin. The deleted region encompasses 50 protein-coding genes, including the morbid genes APOA1BP, ARHGEF2, LAMTOR2, LMNA, NTRK1, PRCC, RIT1, SEMA4A, and YY1AP1. Although the unique phenotype observed in our patient can arise from the haploinsufficiency of the dosage-sensitive LMNA gene, the dosage imbalance of other genes implicated in the rearrangement could also contribute to the phenotype. Further studies are required for the delineation of the phenotype associated with this rare chromosomal alteration and elucidation of the critical genes for manifestation of the specific clinical features.
High throughput sequencing has greatly advanced disease gene identification, especially in heterogeneous entities. Despite falling costs this is still an expensive and laborious technique, particularly when studying large cohorts. To address this problem we applied Exome Pool-Seq as an economic and fast screening technology in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Sequencing of 96 individuals can be performed in eight pools of 12 samples on less than one Illumina sequencer lane. In a pilot study with 96 cases we identified 27 variants, likely or possibly affecting function. Twenty five of these were identified in 923 established NDD genes (based on SysID database, status November 2016) (ACTB, AHDC1, ANKRD11, ATP6V1B2, ATRX, CASK, CHD8, GNAS, IFIH1, KCNQ2, KMT2A, KRAS, MAOA, MED12, MED13L, RIT1, SETD5, SIN3A, TCF4, TRAPPC11, TUBA1A, WAC, ZBTB18, ZMYND11), two in 543 (SysID) candidate genes (ZNF292, BPTF), and additionally a de novo loss-of-function variant in LRRC7, not previously implicated in NDDs. Most of them were confirmed to be de novo, but we also identified X-linked or autosomal-dominantly or autosomal-recessively inherited variants. With a detection rate of 28%, Exome Pool-Seq achieves comparable results to individual exome analyses but reduces costs by &gt;85%. Compared with other large scale approaches using Molecular Inversion Probes (MIP) or gene panels, it allows flexible re-analysis of data. Exome Pool-Seq is thus well suited for large-scale, cost-efficient and flexible screening in characterized but heterogeneous entities like NDDs.
Objective: To analyze the gene mutations and clinical features of patients with Noonan syndrome and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Method: Determined the mutation domain in five cases diagnosed with Noonan syndrome and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and identified the relationship between the mutant domain and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by searching relevant articles in pubmed database. Result: Three mutant genes (PTPN11 gene in chromosome 12, RIT1 gene in chromosome 1 and RAF1 gene in chromosome 3) in five cases all had been reported to be related to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The reported hypertrophic cardiomyopathy relevant genes MYPN, MYH6 and MYBP3 had also been found in case 1 and 2. Patients with same gene mutation had different clinical manifestations. Both case 4 and 5 had RAF1 mutation (c.770C&gt;T). However, case 4 had special face, low IQ, mild pulmonary artery stenosis, and only mild ventricular hypertrophy. Conclusion: Noonan syndrome is a genetic heterogeneity disease. Our study identified specific gene mutations that could result in Noonan syndrome with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy through molecular biology methods. The results emphasize the importance of gene detection in the management of Noonan syndrome.
目的： 分析Noonan综合征合并肥厚型心肌病患儿的基因突变与临床表型。 方法： 以北京安贞医院小儿心脏中心收治的5例确诊Noonan综合征合并肥厚型心肌病患儿为研究对象，进行基因突变检测，确定突变位点及结构域，分析突变基因与肥厚型心肌病临床表型的关系。 结果： 5例患儿的3个基因突变位点(12号染色体PTPN11基因，1号染色体RIT1基因及3号染色体RAF1基因)与肥厚型心肌病相关。2例患儿基因检测发现与肥厚型心肌病相关的已知基因突变MYPN、MYH6及MYBPC3。2例患儿基因突变均为RAF1，c.770C&gt;T，但临床表现不同，其中1例患儿除有特殊面容及智商较低外，肺动脉瓣狭窄极轻，心室肌肥厚亦不严重。 结论： Noonan综合征表现明显的遗传异质性，同一基因位点突变，临床表现多样。PTPN11、RAF1及RIT1基因位于特定结构域的突变位点与伴肥厚型心肌病的Noonan综合征密切相关。.
Reported here are twins, both of whom have a 1q21.3 microdeletion and who exhibit key features common to previously reported cases such as microcephaly and developmental delay. However, some clinical findings and deleted genes differed from those in previously reported cases. The karyotype was normal 46, XX for both of the twins. Array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) identified a 2.6 Mb deletion on chromosome 1q21.3 (chr1: 153,514,121-156,171,335 bp) in case 1 and a 1.6 Mb deletion on chromosome 1q21.3 (chr1: 154,748,365-156,358,923 bp) in case 2. The deleted region includes DPM3, MUC1, GBA, PKLR, RIT1, and LAMTOR2 in both siblings. To the extent known, this is the second report of a 1q21.3 microdeletion in a family with mental retardation, developmental delay, seizures, and some dysmorphic features, thus expanding the phenotypic spectrum.
Like other small G proteins of the Ras superfamily, Rap1 is activated by distinct guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) in response to different signals to elicit cellular responses. Activation of Rap1 by cyclic AMP (cAMP) can occur via cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA)-independent and PKA-dependent mechanisms. PKA-independent activation of Rap1 by cAMP is mediated by direct binding of cAMP to Rap1-guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Rap1-GEFs) Epac1 (exchange protein directly activated by cAMP 1) and Epac2 (Epac1 and Epac2 are also called cAMP-GEFI and -GEFII). The availability of cAMP analogues that selectively activate Epacs, but not PKA, provides a specific tool to activate Rap1. It has been argued that the inability of these analogues to regulate extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) signaling despite activating Rap1 provides evidence that Rap1 is incapable of regulating ERKs. We confirm that the PKA-independent activation of Rap1 by Epac1 activates a perinuclear pool of Rap1 and that this does not result in ERK activation. However, we demonstrate that this inability to regulate ERKs is not a property of Rap1 but is rather a property of Epacs themselves. The addition of a membrane-targeting motif to Epac1 (Epac-CAAX) relocalizes Epac1 from its normal perinuclear locale to the plasma membrane. In this new locale it is capable of activating ERKs in a Rap1- and cAMP-dependent manner. Rap1 activation by Epac-CAAX, but not wild-type Epac, triggers its association with B-Raf. Therefore, we propose that its intracellular localization prevents Epac1 from activating ERKs. C3G (Crk SH3 domain Guanine nucleotide exchanger) is a Rap1 exchanger that is targeted to the plasma membrane upon activation. We show that C3G can be localized to the plasma membrane by cAMP/PKA, as can Rap1 when activated by cAMP/PKA. Using a small interfering RNA approach, we demonstrate that C3G is required for the activation of ERKs and Rap1 by cAMP/PKA. This activation requires the GTP-dependent association of Rap1 with B-Raf. These data demonstrate that B-Raf is a physiological target of Rap1, but its utilization as a Rap1 effector is GEF specific. We propose a model that specific GEFs activate distinct pools of Rap1 that are differentially coupled to downstream effectors.
Like Ras, farnesylation of the IP (prostacyclin receptor) is required for its efficient intracellular signalling, and hence the IP represents a potential target for inhibition by FTIs [FTase (farnesyl protein transferase) inhibitors]. Herein, the effect of SCH66336 on the isoprenylation and function of the human and mouse IPs overexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and by the IP endogenously expressed in human erythroleukaemia cells, was investigated. SCH66336 yielded concentration-dependent decreases in IP-mediated cAMP generation (IC50 0.27-0.62 nM), [Ca2+]i mobilization (IC50 26.6-48.3 nM) and IP internalization, but had no effect on signalling by the non-isoprenylated beta2 adrenergic receptor or b isoform of the TP (prostanoid thromboxane A2 receptor). Additionally, SCH66336 impaired IP-mediated crossdesensitization of TPa signalling (IC50 56.1 nM) and reduced farnesylation of the molecular chaperone protein HDJ-2 (IC50 3.1 nM). To establish whether farnesylation of the IP is inhibited and/or whether its 'CaaX motif' might undergo alternative geranylgeranylation in the presence of SCH66336, a series of chimaeric Ha (Harvey)-Ras fusions were generated by replacing its CaaX motif (-CVLS) with that of the IP (-CSLC) or, as controls, of Ki (Kirsten)-Ras 4B (-CVIM) or Rac 1 (-CVLL). Whereas SCH66336 had no effect on Ha-RasCVLL isoprenylation in vitro or in whole cells, it supported alternative geranylgeranylation of Ha-RasCVIM, but completely impaired isoprenylation of both Ha-RasCVLS and Ha-RasCSLC. These data confirm that the -CSLC motif of the IP is a direct target for inhibition by the FTI SCH66336, and in the presence of strong FTase inhibition, the IP does not undergo compensatory geranylgeranylation
MST1 (mammalian Sterile20-like 1) and MST2 are closely related Class II GC (protein Ser/Thr) kinases that initiate apoptosis when transiently overexpressed in mammalian cells. In the present study, we show that recombinant MST1/2 undergo a robust autoactivation in vitro, mediated by an intramolecular autophosphorylation of a single site [MST1(Thr183)/MST2(Thr180)] on the activation loop of an MST dimer. Endogenous full-length MST1 is activated by a variety of stressful stimuli, accompanied by the secondary appearance of a 36 kDa Thr183-phosphorylated, caspase-cleaved catalytic fragment. Recombinant MST1 exhibits only 2-5% activation during transient expression; endogenous MST1 in the cycling HeLa or KB cells has a similar low fractional activation, but 2 h incubation with okadaic acid (1 mM) results in 100% activation. Endogenous MST1 immunoprecipitated from KB cells is specifically associated with substoichiometric amounts of the growth inhibitory polypeptides RASSF1A and NORE1A (novel Ras effector 1A; a Ras-GTP-binding protein). Co-expression of RASSF1A, RASSF1C, NORE1A and NORE1B with MST1 markedly suppresses MST1(Thr183) phosphorylation in vivo and abolishes the ability of MST1 to undergo Mg-ATP-mediated autoactivation in vitro; direct addition of purified NORE1A in vitro also inhibits MST1 activation. In contrast, co-transfection of MST1 with NORE1A modified by the addition of a C-terminal CAAX motif results in a substantial increase in MST1(Thr183) phosphorylation, as does fusion of a myristoylation motif directly on to the MST1 N-terminus. Moreover, MST1 polypeptides, bound via wild-type NORE1A to Ras(G12V) (where G12V stands for Gly12Val), exhibit higher Thr183 phosphorylation compared with MST1 bound to NORE1A alone. Nevertheless, serum stimulation of KB cells does not detectably increase the activation state of endogenous MST1 or MST2 despite promoting the recruitment of the endogenous NORE1-MST1 complex to endogenous Ras. We propose that the NORE1/RASSF1 polypeptides, in addition to their role in maintaining the low activity of MST1 in vivo, direct MST1 to sites of activation and perhaps co-localization with endogenous substrates.
Nectins, Ca2+-independent immunoglobulin-like cell-cell adhesion molecules, trans-interact and form cell-cell adhesion, which increases the velocities of the formation of the E-cadherin-based adherens junctions (AJs) and the claudin-based tight junctions (TJs) in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. The trans-interactions of nectins furthermore induce activation of Cdc42 and Rac small G proteins, but the roles of these small G proteins activated in this way remain unknown. We examined here the role and the mode of action of Cdc42 in the organization of AJs and TJs in MDCK cells. We first made the NWASP-Cdc42 and Rac interactive binding (CRIB) domain, an inhibitor of activated Cdc42, fused to the Ki-Ras CAAX motif (NWASP-CRIB-CAAX; where A is aliphatic amino acid), which was targeted to the cell-cell adhesion sites. We then found that overexpression of NWASP-CRIB-CAAX reduced the velocities of the formation of AJs and TJs. Conversely, overexpression of a constitutively active mutant of Cdc42 (V12Cdc42) increased their velocities, and the inhibitory effect of NWASP-CRIB-CAAX was suppressed by co-expression with V12Cdc42. The inhibitory effect of NWASP-CRIB-CAAX on the formation of AJs and TJs was suppressed by co-expression of nectin-1 of which trans-interaction activated endogenous Cdc42. Moreover, the formation of the claudin-based TJs required a greater amount of activated Cdc42 than that of the E-cadherin-based AJs. These results indicate that the Cdc42 activated by the trans-interactions of nectins is involved in the organization of AJs and TJs in different mechanisms in MDCK cells.
Protein farnesyltransferase (PFTase) is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme that catalyzes the alkylation of cysteine (C) in protein substrates containing a C-terminal "CaaX" motif by farnesyl diphosphate (FPP). In yeast PFTase Zn(II) is coordinated to D307, C309, and H363 in the beta-subunit. The inner coordination sphere of the metal also contains a water molecule to give a net charge of 0 for the tetracoordinate Zn(II) center. When the protein substrate binds, the water molecule is replaced by the thiol of the cysteine residue, and the thiol is deprotonated to generate a Zn(II)-stabilized thiolate in the PFTase.FPP.protein ternary complex for the ensuing prenyl transfer reaction. An expression system was constructed for yeast PFTase containing a His(6) tag at the C-terminus of the beta-subunit to facilitate purification of the wild-type enzyme and site-directed mutants. The amino acids that coordinate Zn(II) were substituted to give a series of mutant PFTases with net charges of +1, 0, -1, and -2 at the Zn(II) center of the ternary enzyme.substrate complexes. Wild-type PFTase and the site-directed mutants were purified as alpha,beta-heterodimers, and each was found to contain an equivalent of Zn(II). All of the mutants were less reactive than wt PFTase (net charge of -1), with the greatest losses of activity seen for the mutants with net charges of 0 and +1. Equilibrium binding experiments with dGCVIA peptide and an unreactive analogue of FPP, (E,E)-2-[2-oxo-2-[[(3,7,11-trimethyl-2,6,10-dodecatrienyl)oxy]amino]ethyl]phosphonate (FNP), established that all of the mutants bound an equivalent of the peptide substrate. Like wt PFTase, the pH dependence of K(D) for the mutants did not change significantly between pH 5 and pH 9, indicating that pK(A)s for the thiol moiety in the (mutant PFTase).FNP.peptide complexes were &lt;5. dGSVIA and dG(beta-NH2-Ala)VIA, where the sulfhydryl moiety was replaced by hydroxyl and amino groups, respectively, were not substrates. These experiments suggest a direct relationship between the net charge of the Zn(II) center in PFTase and the reactivity of the peptide thiolate that is alkylated by FPP.
Rab5 is a small molecular weight GTP-binding protein that functions in endocytic vesicle traffic. Like other Ras-related proteins, Rab5 is prenylated on C-terminal cysteine residues, although it lacks the typical C-terminal CAAX motif (where A is any aliphatic amino acid and X is any amino acid) to direct this post-translational modification. We have investigated structural requirements for the in vitro geranylgeranylation of Rab5. Rab5N133I, a point mutant that has impaired ability to bind GTP or GDP, undergoes modification to a limited extent and at a severely reduced rate when compared to cognate Rab5. A second point mutant, Rab5Q79L, can be processed to approximately the same extent as wild-type albeit at a reduced rate. Since the latter mutation results in defective GTPase activity, these combined observations indicate that guanine nucleotide binding plays an important role in the geranylgeranylation reaction and suggest that the GDP-bound form of Rab5 is the preferred conformation for interaction with Rab prenyltransferase. This idea is supported by the finding that non-hydrolyzable GTP analogs inhibit Rab5 prenylation, while in vitro processing of both H-ras and the gamma 2 subunit of regulatory G proteins is unaffected at concentrations of guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) up to 400 microM. Moreover, a truncation mutant lacking the C-terminal cysteines, Rab5(1-211), serves as an inhibitor of Rab5wt geranylgeranylation when liganded with GDP but not GTP gamma S. Thus, the recognition of Rab5 as a substrate by Rab prenyltransferase involves structural elements exclusive of the C terminus and dependent upon the GDP-binding conformation of the protein.
Protein farnesyltransferase (FTase) catalyses the addition of a farnesyl group to a cysteine within the so-called 'CAAX box' at the C-terminus of various proteins. In the present paper we report purification of Saccharomyces cerevisiae FTase to near-homogeneity. This was accomplished by constructing a yeast strain overproducing FTase approx. 100-fold. The purified enzyme was a heterodimer of approx. 90 kDa and consisted of 43 kDa and 34 kDa subunits. The 43 kDa subunit was shown to be the product of the DPR1 gene by using antibody raised against baculovirus-produced DPR1 polypeptide. The purified enzyme required Mg2+, showed a pH optimum of 7.8 and was most active at 50 degrees C. The Km values for farnesyl pyrophosphate and GST-CIIS (glutathione S-transferase fused to the C-terminal 12 amino acids of yeast RAS2 protein), KmFpp and KmGST CIIS, were 8.1 and 5.1 microM respectively. The enzyme was capable of farnesylating GST-CIIL (the same as GST-CIIS, except that the C-terminal serine is changed to leucine), a substrate protein for the enzyme geranylgeranyltransferase, although with a higher apparent Km than for GST-CIIS. Like its mammalian counterpart, yeast FTase activity was inhibited by peptides containing the C-terminal CAAX sequence (that is, one where C = cysteine, A = aliphatic amino acid and X = any amino acid). These results provide direct evidence for the idea that the yeast and mammalian FTases are structurally and functionally very similar.
Expression of constitutively active Ras (V12Ras) in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes or targeted cardiac expression of V12Ras in transgenic mice induces myocardial cell growth and expression of genes that are markers of cardiac hypertrophy including atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and myosin light chain-2. However, the signaling pathways that modulate the effects of Ras on acquisition of the various features of cardiac hypertrophy are not known. We identified the Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factor-like factor (Rlf) in a yeast two-hybrid screen of human heart cDNA library using Ras as bait, suggesting that Ras signaling in the heart may involve Rlf. We demonstrate here that Rlf is expressed in human heart. Expression of wild type Rlf or Rlf-CAAX, a membrane-targeted mutant of Rlf, transactivated ANF and myosin light chain-2 promoters but did not activate canonical cAMP responsive elements or phorbol ester responsive elements, suggesting that Rlf expression does not lead to a generalized increase in transcription. Transfection of mutant ANF promoter-reporter gene constructs demonstrated that the proximal serum response element is both necessary and sufficient for Rlf-inducible ANF expression. Rlf-induced ANF promoter activation required Ral and Cdc42 but not RhoA, Rac1, ERK, or p38 kinase activation. In addition, Rlf potentiated alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor (alpha(1)-AR)-induced ANF expression. Prolonged activation of the alpha(1)-AR increases RalGTP levels in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, further emphasizing a role for Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factors in alpha(1)-AR signaling. Overall, this study supports the concept that Rlf and Ral are important previously unrecognized signaling components that regulate transcriptional responses in myocardial cells.
Determinants of membrane targeting of Rho proteins were investigated in live cells with green fluorescent fusion proteins expressed with or without Rho-guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI)alpha. The hypervariable region determined to which membrane compartment each protein was targeted. Targeting was regulated by binding to RhoGDI alpha in the case of RhoA, Rac1, Rac2, and Cdc42hs but not RhoB or TC10. Although RhoB localized to the plasma membrane (PM), Golgi, and motile peri-Golgi vesicles, TC10 localized to PMs and endosomes. Inhibition of palmitoylation mislocalized H-Ras, RhoB, and TC10 to the endoplasmic reticulum. Although overexpressed Cdc42hs and Rac2 were observed predominantly on endomembrane, Rac1 was predominantly at the PM. RhoA was cytosolic even when expressed at levels in vast excess of RhoGDI alpha. Oncogenic Dbl stimulated translocation of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Rac1, GFP-Cdc42hs, and GFP-RhoA to lamellipodia. RhoGDI binding to GFP-Cdc42hs was not affected by substituting farnesylation for geranylgeranylation. A palmitoylation site inserted into RhoA blocked RhoGDI alpha binding. Mutations that render RhoA, Cdc42hs, or Rac1, either constitutively active or dominant negative abrogated binding to RhoGDI alpha and redirected expression to both PMs and internal membranes. Thus, despite the common essential feature of the CAAX (prenylation, AAX tripeptide proteolysis, and carboxyl methylation) motif, the subcellular localizations of Rho GTPases, like their functions, are diverse and dynamic.
Recently developed CAAX peptidomimetic compounds have been shown to be potent and specific inhibitors of farnesyl protein transferase activity and to block the growth of Ras-transformed cells. However, whether this growth inhibitory action is specifically a consequence of blocking oncogenic Ras signaling has not been determined. To address this question, we have utilized mutants of the normally farnesylated oncogenic Ras protein (Ras-F) that are modified by alternative lipids, a geranylgeranyl isoprenoid (Ras-GG) or the fatty acid myristate (Myr-Ras), to determine the specificity of the CAAX peptidomimetic compound, B581. Like Ras-F, both Ras-GG and Myr-Ras are membrane-associated and transforming. Unexpectedly, NIH 3T3 cells transformed by each of the three Ras mutants underwent morphological alteration to a less transformed, but not normal, morphology. However, B581 inhibited the ability of only Ras-F-transformed cells, but not Ras-GG- or Myr-Ras- (or Raf-) transformed cells, to grow in soft agar. Furthermore, although all three lipid-modified versions of Ras stimulated mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, and both Jun and Elk-1 transcriptional activity, B581 inhibited only farnesylated Ras activation of these three downstream components of Ras signaling. Therefore, B581 prevents the growth of Ras-transformed cells by specifically antagonizing Ras-mediated signaling.
The C-terminal "CaaX"-motif-containing proteins usually undergo three sequential post-translational processing steps: (1) attachment of a prenyl group to the cysteine residue; (2) proteolytic removal of the last three amino acids "aaX"; (3) methyl esterification of the exposed alpha-carboxyl group of the prenyl-cysteine residue. The Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania major Ras converting enzyme 1 (RCE1) orthologs of 302 and 285 amino acids-proteins, respectively, have only 13-20% sequence identity to those from other species but contain the critical residues for the activity found in other orthologs. The Trypanosoma brucei a-factor converting enzyme 1 (AFC1) ortholog consists of 427 amino acids with 29-33% sequence identity to those of other species and contains the consensus HExxH zinc-binding motif. The trypanosomatid RCE1 and AFC1 orthologs contain predicted transmembrane regions like other species. Membranes from Sf9 cells expressing the RCE1 ortholog of T. brucei or L. major showed proteolytic activity against farnesylated RAS-CVIM, whereas membranes containing T. brucei AFC1 ortholog were inactive. The results suggest that RCE1 is responsible for proteolytic removal of the C-terminal aaX from prenyl-CaaX proteins in these parasites. All the three enzymatic post-translational processes are thought to be required for proper cellular functioning of CaaX-proteins in eukaryotic cells. We carried out RNA interference experiments in Trypanosoma brucei of the enzymes involved in farnesyl protein post-translational modification to evaluate their importance in cell proliferation. Knockdown of T. brucei PFT beta subunit and RCE1 mRNAs resulted in &gt;20-fold suppression of cell growth and dramatic morphologic changes. Knockdown of PPMT mRNA caused less dramatic effects on growth but induced noticeable changes in cell morphology.
Retinoids are crucial regulators of a wide variety of processes in both developing and adult animals. These effects are thought to be mediated by the retinoic acid (RA) receptors and the retinoid X receptors (RXRs). We have identified an additional retinoid-activated receptor that is neither a retinoic acid receptors nor an RXR. RXR-interacting protein 14 (RIP14), a recently described orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, can be activated by either all-trans-RA (tRA) or the synthetic retinoid TTNPB [[E]-4-[2-(5, 6, 7, 8-tetrahydro-5, 5, 8, 8-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl)propen-1-yl]benzoic acid].RIP14 binds to DNA as a heterodimer with RXR. In the presence of either tRA or TTNPB, the addition of 9-cis-RA or the RXR-specific agonist LG1069 [4-[1-(3, 5, 5, 8, 8-pentamethyl-5, 6, 7, 8-tertrahydro-2-naphthyl)ethenyl]benzoic acid] results in additional activation. Mutations of the ligand-dependent transcriptional activation functions indicate that TTNPB activates the RIP14 component of the RIP14-RXR heterodimer, that 9-cis-RA and LG1069 activate RXR, and that tRA activates via both RIP14 and RXR. Despite the very effective activation of RIP14 by tRA or TTNPB, relatively high concentrations of these compounds are required, and no evidence for direct binding of either compound was obtained using several approaches. These results suggest that RIP14 is the receptor for an as-yet-unidentified retinoid metabolite.
Originally called retinoid X receptor interacting protein 14 (RIP14), the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) was renamed after the ability of its rat form to bind supra-physiological concentrations of farnesol. In 1999 FXR was de-orphanized since primary bile acids were identified as natural ligands. Strongly expressed in the liver and intestine, FXR has been shown to be the master transcriptional regulator of several entero-hepatic metabolic pathways with relevance to the pathophysiology of conditions such as cholestasis, fatty liver disease, cholesterol gallstone disease, intestinal inflammation and tumors. Furthermore, given the importance of FXR in the gut-liver axis feedbacks regulating lipid and glucose homeostasis, FXR modulation appears to have great input in diseases such as metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Exciting results from several cellular and animal models have provided the impetus to develop synthetic FXR ligands as novel pharmacological agents. Fourteen years from its discovery, FXR has gone from bench to bedside; a novel nuclear receptor ligand is going into clinical use.
We have cloned the genomic DNA encoding the human NeuAc alpha2,3Gal beta1,3GalNAc alpha2,6-sialyltransferase (hST6GalNAc IV) and analysed its structure. The hST6GalNAc IV gene was found to span about 9 kb and to be composed of six exons. The 5'-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) results indicated that mRNA isoform of the hST6GalNAc IV was generated by alternative splicing in the 5'-untranslated region. The expression of this gene was highly restricted in human fetal tissues. The potential transcriptional start site was determined by CapSite hunting. Sequence analysis of the 5'-flanking region of this gene lacked canonical TATA and CAAT boxes, but contained several putative binding sites for transcription factors SP1, MZF1, GATA1, LMO2COM, NFAT, HFH8 and USF, etc. Functional analysis of the 5'-flanking region by transient expression method revealed a high transcriptional activity in both HepG2 cells and Molt4 cells in a cell type-dependent manner, but not in SK-N-MC cells. These results suggest cell type-specific regulation of the basal hST6GalNAc IV promoter activity.
Endothelial function plays a key role in determining the clinical manifestations of established atherosclerotic lesions and has shown to be associated with suppressed sympathetic tone. Abnormal heart rate recovery (HRR) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) response during recovery has been found to have diagnostic role for detecting cardiovascular risk.
To investigate whether with abnormal HRR and delayed SBP recovery ratio after exercise could predict endothelial dysfunction in prediabetic subjects.
Ninety-two prediabetic patients underwent brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) test and a maximal exercise stress test. Seventy-eight healthy subjects served as a control group. HRR at 1 minute (HRR1 ) and SBP recovery ratio (SBPRR3 ) was defined as the SBP at minute 3 of recovery divided by SBP at peak exercise. Left ventricular diastolic function was assessed utilizing both conventional and tissue Doppler echocardiography.
Flow-mediated dilatation was significantly decreased in prediabetics versus controls (P &lt; 0.0001). Isovolumetric relaxation time and E/E' were significantly increased in prediabetics (P &lt; 0.01 and &lt;0.001). Delayed SBPRR3 was significantly correlated with impaired endothelial function and (E/E') in prediabetics (r = 0.62, P &lt; 0.001 and r = 0.56, P &lt; 0.001, respectively). Stepwise linear regression analysis revealed that HRR1 and SBPRR3 were significant predictors of endothelial dysfunction (r = 0.61, r(2) = 0.37, P &lt; 0.01 and r = 0.51; r(2) = 27; P &lt; 0.0001).
Abnormal HRR1 and delayed SBP response detected during recovery imply a significant correlation with impaired endothelial function and diastolic dysfunction in prediabetics.
Heart rate recovery (HRR), a cardiac autonomic control marker, was shown to be related to body composition (BC), yet this was not tested in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients. The aim of this study was to determine if, and to what extent, markers of BC and body fat (BF) distribution are related to cardiac autonomic control in NAFLD patients.
BC was assessed with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in 28 NAFLD patients (19 men, 51±13 years, and 9 women, 47±13 years). BF depots ratios were calculated to assess BF distribution. Subjects' HRR was recorded 1 (HRR1) and 2 min (HRR2) immediately after a maximum graded exercise test.
BC and BF distribution were related to HRR; particularly weight, trunk BF and trunk BF-to-appendicular BF ratio showed a negative relation with HRR1 (r=-0.613, r=-0.597 and r=-0.547, respectively, P&lt;0.01) and HRR2 (r=-0.484, r=-0.446, P&lt;0.05, and r=-0.590, P&lt;0.01, respectively). Age seems to be related to both HRR1 and HRR2 except when controlled for BF distribution. The preferred model in multiple regression should include trunk BF-to-appendicular BF ratio and BF to predict HRR1 (r2=0.549; P&lt;0.05), and trunk BF-to-appendicular BF ratio alone to predict HRR2 (r2=0.430; P&lt;0.001).
BC and BF distribution were related to HRR in NAFLD patients. Trunk BF-to-appendicular BF ratio was the best independent predictor of HRR and therefore may be best related to cardiovascular increased risk, and possibly act as a mediator in age-related cardiac autonomic control variation.
This investigation examined the association between aerobic fitness, race, and heart rate recovery.
Forty white and 40 black subjects participated in the study and were group matched based on age and maximal oxygen consumption (VO(2max)) which was determined via a maximal graded exercise test on a treadmill. Heart rate recovery was evaluated at 1-minute (HRR1) and at 2-minutes (HRR2) during an active cool-down period. The subjects were divided by race and whether they were above (A) or below (B) the referenced 50th percentile for VO(2max) for men age 20 - 29 years.
When evaluating each race separately, the white men who were in the A group had significantly faster HRR1 (18.2 ± 5.9 beats.min-1 in A versus 16.7 ± 6.0 beats.min-1 in B) and HRR2 (40.9 ± 10.3 beats.min-1 in A versus 32.1 ± 8.5 beats.min-1 in B) compared to the white men in the B group. However, there was no significant difference in either HRR1 (18.2 ± 5.9 beats.min-1 in A versus 16.7 ± 6 beats.min-1 in B) or HRR2 (43.1 ± 10.3 beats.min-1 in A versus 44.4.6 ± 8.2 beats.min-1 in B) between the A and B groups in the black men. The only significant correlation existed between VO(2max) and HRR2 in the white subjects (r=0.33, P&lt;0.05).
The results of this study suggest that HRR is associated with aerobic fitness in white men but not in black men.
This study evaluated the heart rate recovery response in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients and control subjects.
Delayed heart rate recovery after exercise reflects AD and independently predicts adverse cardiac outcome.
Fifty-one patients with AS and 50 age- and matched controls received electrocardiography, echocardiography, and treadmill exercise testing. The heart rate recovery (HRR) index was calculated as the reduction in heart rate from the rate at peak exercise to the rate at the 1st (HRR1), 2nd (HRR2), 3rd (HRR3) and 5th (HRR5) minute after the cessation of exercise stress testing.
There were significant differences in HRR1 and HRR2 indices between patients and controls (24.8 ± 12.1 vs 34.9 ± 11.0; p&lt;0.001 and 41.2 ± 14.2 vs 54.3 ± 11.8; p&lt;0.001, beats/min, respectively). Similarly, HRR3 and HRR5 indices were lower in patients than controls (51.3 ± 15.1 vs 65.2 ± 14.0; p&lt;0.001 and 61.0 ± 14.2 vs 76.1 ± 14.8; p&lt;0.001). In addition, exercise capacity was markedly lower (8.1 ± 2.0 vs 10.5 ± 2.5 METs; p&lt;0.001) in AS than controls.
The HRR index is impaired in AS patients, implying the occurrence of autonomic dysfunction even without active joint disease or frank cardiac involvement.
The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between psoriasis and heart rate recovery (HRR) index.
A total of 50 patients with a diagnosis of psoriasis and 32 healthy volunteers were included in the study. In all patients, a stress test was performed to calculate the HRR index in a manner which aimed to reach the age-specific maximum heart rate. HRR indices were calculated in all patients and controls.
HRR (beats/minute) indices after the 1st (HRR1, 26 ± 10 vs. 33 ± 8, p = 0.002), 2nd (44 ± 11 vs. 50 ± 6, p = 0.002), 3rd (51 ± 7 vs. 63 ± 8, p &lt; 0.001), 4th (54 ± 7 vs. 65 ± 8, p &lt; 0.001) and 5th (57 ± 8 vs. 70 ± 10, p &lt; 0.001) minutes of the recovery period were significantly lower in the psoriasis group compared to healthy controls. In addition, HRR1 was significantly correlated with duration of psoriasis (r = 0.541, p &lt; 0.001) and psoriasis area and severity index score (r = 0.511, p &lt; 0.001).
HRR was lower in patients with psoriasis. Given the prognostic value of this test, patients with psoriasis might be at risk for future cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality.
Cardiovascular complications are the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in acromegaly. However, there is little data regarding cardiac autonomic functions in these patients. Herein, we aimed to investigate several parameters of cardiac autonomic functions in patients with acromegaly compared to healthy subjects. We enrolled 20 newly diagnosed acromegalic patients (55% female, age:45.7 ± 12.6 years) and 32 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects. All participants underwent 24 h Holter recording. Heart rate recovery (HRR) indices were calculated by subtracting 1st, 2nd and 3rd minute heart rates from maximal heart rate. All patients underwent heart rate variability (HRV) and QT dynamicity analysis. Baseline characteristics were similar except diabetes mellitus and hypertension among groups. Mean HRR1 (29.2 ± 12.3 vs 42.6 ± 6.5, p = 0.001), HRR2 (43.5 ± 15.6 vs 61.1 ± 10.8, p = 0.001) and HRR3 (46.4 ± 16.2 vs 65.8 ± 9.8, p = 0.001) values were significantly higher in control group. HRV parameters as, SDNN [standard deviation of all NN intervals] (p = 0.001), SDANN [SD of the 5 min mean RR intervals] (p = 0.001), RMSSD [root square of successive differences in RR interval] (p = 0.001), PNN50 [proportion of differences in successive NN intervals &gt;50 ms] (p = 0.001) and high-frequency [HF] (p = 0.001) were significantly decreased in patients with acromegaly; but low frequency [LF] (p = 0.046) and LF/HF (p = 0.001) were significantly higher in acromegaly patients. QTec (p = 0.009), QTac/RR slope (p = 0.017) and QTec/RR slope (p = 0.01) were significantly higher in patients with acromegaly. Additionally, there were significant negative correlation of disease duration with HRR2, HRR3, SDNN, PNN50, RMSSD, variability index. Our study results suggest that cardiac autonomic functions are impaired in patients with acromegaly. Further large scale studies are needed to exhibit the prognostic significance of impaired autonomic functions in patients with acromegaly.
Research indicates that slow heart rate recovery 1-2 minutes after exercise is a predictor of cardiovascular mortality, sudden mortality as well. It is hardly related to myocardial ischemia; most of all, it is related to impaired activities of the parasympathetic system. The purpose of this study was to assess HRR in subjects after a surgical treatment (percutaneous coronary intervention - PCI) of acute coronary syndromes (ACS), undergoing cardiologic rehabilitation.
The study comprised 58 subjects, 42 men and 16 women aged 49-68 (56.8 +/- 7.6) after ACS treated with PCI undergoing cardiologic rehabilitation (stage 2)--group I. The comparative group comprised 34 subjects, 25 men and 9 women aged 46-61 (55.5 +/- 8.9 lat) who were clinically healthy and who underwent a single sub-maximal exercise test--group II. In subjects undergoing rehabilitation, an exercise test was performed twice --before and after stage 2 of rehabilitation. HRR was defined as a difference between the peak heart rate and those after the 1st (HRR1) and 2nd (HRR) minute of recovery.
After stationary rehabilitation as a part of stage 2 of cardiologic rehabilitation, HRR2 was 26.3 +/- 10.6/min and was 40.8/min +/- 13.8/min; both these values were not significantly different from values observed in healthy subjects (p &gt; 0.05). Significant increase in HRR1 and HRR2 was observed after the completion of stage 2 of cardiologic rehabilitation in ill subjects (p &lt; 0.05) as compared to initial values.
In subjects after ACS treated with PCI, it is observed that HRR changes back to normal values observed in healthy subjects as a result of underwent cardiologic rehabilitation. HRR should become an important factor in assessing effectiveness of conducted cardiologic rehabilitation.
In clinical practice, autonomic functions are indirectly investigated with heart rate recovery (HRR) index measurements. Our aim was to evaluate the HRR index in patients with psoriasis, which is a systemic inflammatory disease.
The study population included 39 psoriasis patients (18 female, mean age 48±15 years) and 40 control group (18 female, mean age 44±9 years) healthy individuals. The severity of psoriasis was calculated using the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI). None of the study patients had a PASI score &gt;50. All of the participants underwent treadmill exercise testing using the Bruce protocol.
According to basic clinical and demographic characteristics, both groups were similar with regard to age, body mass index, and fasting glucose and cholesterol levels. No significant differences were observed in the systolic or diastolic blood pressures or resting heart rates between the two groups. All patients and control-group participants had sinus rhythm and normal 12-lead ECG results at rest. All subjects completed the exercise tests to exhaustion without rhythm abnormalities, ischemic changes, or other complications. The maximal heart rate and metabolic equivalents achieved during the exercise stress test (EST) were similar in the psoriasis and control group (163±16 vs. 170±16, p=0.07; 9.8±0.9 vs. 10.1±1.0, p=0.24, respectively). The 1st, 3rd, and 5th minute HRR indices of patients with psoriasis were similar to those of the control group (HRR1: 30±12, 32±18, p=0.71; HRR3: 57±13, 64±17, p=0.10; HRR5: 64±15, 68±16, p=0.46, respectively).
The HRR index, which is calculated by an EST and associated with autonomic nervous system function, is not effected in mild to moderate psoriasis patients.
The aim of the study was the evaluation of the autonomic cardiac function in professional soccer players by heart rate recovery (HRR) measurement after 1' or 2' of active recovery (HRR1 or HRR2, respectively) from an exercise stress test.
Ninety-two adult professional soccer players (aged 25.27 ± 4.06 years). The exercise test was performed using a cycle ergometer with a ramp protocol. The subjects began with a load of 25W that was increased by 3W every 6 seconds, followed by an active recovery phase. We assessed the heart rate at rest (HRr), the PR interval, the QT and QTc intervals, the QRS axis, the QRS duration, the maximal heart rate, and the heart rate and heart rate recovery after 1 or 2 minutes from suspension of the load.
The HRR1 was significantly slower (20.53 SD 6.67) among goalkeepers in comparison with other roles (HRR1 30.7 SD 6.62; P&lt;0.01). There were also significant differences among the HRR1 values of forwards (27.11 SD 4.04), midfielders (HRR1 31.31 SD 7.43), and defenders (HRR1 32.10 SD 9.55). Goalkeepers had a significantly higher heart rate at rest (HRr, 65.69 SD 10.90) than other players (HRr 57.24 SD 6.21; P&lt;0.01).
These data show better autonomic function in roles with alternate aerobic-anaerobic activity compared to other roles. The results agree with the data in other literature about the positive action of intense aerobic-anaerobic physical activity on cardiovascular autonomic system adjustment.
Heart rate recovery (HRR) after exercise cessation is thought to reflect the rate of reestablishment of parasympathetic tone. Relatively little research has focused on improved HRR in women after completing cardiac rehabilitation (CR) exercise training.
We examined the influence of exercise training on HRR in women completing a traditional CR program and in women completing a CR program tailored for women.
A 2-group randomized clinical trial compared HRR between 99 women completing a traditional 12-week CR program and 137 women completing a tailored CR program. Immediately upon completion of a symptom-limited graded exercise test, HRR was measured at 1 through 6 minutes.
Compared with baseline, improvement in 1-minute HRR (HRR1) was similar (P = 0.777) between the tailored (mean [SD], 17.5 [11] to 19.1 [12]) and the traditional CR program (15.7 [9.0] to 16.9 [9.5]). The amount of change in the 2-minute HRR (HRR2) for the tailored (30 [13] to 32.8 [14.6]) and traditional programs (28.3 [12.8] to 31.2 [13.7]) also was not different (P = 0.391). Similar results were observed for HRR at 3 through 6 minutes. Given these comparable improvements of the 2 programs, in the full cohort, the factors independently predictive of post-CR HRR1, in rank order, were baseline HRR1 (part correlation, 0.35; P &lt; 0.001); peak exercise capacity, estimated as metabolic equivalents (METs; 0.24, P &lt; 0.001); anxiety (-0.17, P = 0.001); and age (-0.13, P = 0.016). The factors independently associated with post-CR HRR2 were baseline HRR2 (0.44, P &lt; 0.001), peak METs (0.21, P &lt; 0.001), and insulin use (-0.10, P = 0.041).
One to 6 minutes after exercise cessation, HRR was significantly improved among the women completing both CR programs. The modifiable factors positively associated with HRR1 included peak METs and lower anxiety, whereas HRR2 was associated with insulin administration and peak METs. Additional research on HRR after exercise training in women is warranted.
Impaired heart rate recovery (HRR) is a strong predictor of overall mortality and cardio-metabolic risk. This study aimed at investigating (1) the effect of participation in a lifestyle-change programme for weight loss on HRR in overweight and obese children and (2) potential associations between the changes in one minute HRR (HRR1) and fitness, weight loss and cardio-metabolic risk.
The analysis included 429 individuals (169 boys) aged 13.9 ± 2.3 years who participated in an inpatient weight loss programme for four to six weeks. At baseline and the end of the programme clinical investigations were performed, including blood analyses, blood pressure, anthropometry and maximal cycle ergometer exercise testing with continuous heart rate (HR) monitoring. HRR was calculated as the difference between the highest exercising HR and HR at one, three and five minutes post-exercise.
Average body weight decreased from 90.7 ± 22.5 kg to 81.9 ± 20.0 kg and peak exercise capacity increased from 1.66 ± 0.38 W/kg to 2.05 ± 0.45 W/kg (p &lt; 0.001). Cardio-metabolic risk factors improved (waist circumference, LDL-cholesterol, HOMA insulin ratio, blood pressure; p &lt; 0.05). HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels remained unchanged. Compared with baseline, at follow-up the decline in HR was more pronounced (+32%, +18% and +11% for HRR1, HRR3 and HRR5; p &lt; 0.001). Improvements in HRR1 were weakly correlated with changes in exercise capacity (p &lt; 0.05; r &lt; 0.13), but not with changes in body weight and cardio-metabolic risk factors.
HRR considerably improved after an inpatient weight loss programme in overweight and obese children. This was not associated with improvements in body weight and cardio-metabolic risk; hence HRR would be a valuable addition to cardiovascular risk assessment in this group.
Human ribonucleotide reductase (hRR) is the key enzyme involved in de novo dNTP synthesis and thus represents an important therapeutic target against hyperproliferative diseases, most notably cancer. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of non-natural indolyl-2'-deoxynucleoside triphosphates to inhibit the activity of hRR. The structural similarities of these analogues with dATP predicted that they would inhibit hRR activity by binding to its allosteric sites. In silico analysis and in vitro characterization identified one particular analogue designated as 5-nitro-indolyl-2'-deoxyribose triphosphate (5-NITP) that inhibits hRR. 5-NITP binding to hRR was determined by isothermal titration calorimetry. X-ray crystal structure of 5-NITP bound to RR1 was determined. Cell-based studies showed the anti-cancer effects of the corresponding non-natural nucleoside against leukemia cells. 5-NITP binds to hRR with micromolar affinity. Binding does not induce hexamerization of hRR1 like dATP, the native allosteric inhibitor of hRR that binds with high affinity to the A-site. The X-ray crystal structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RR1-5-NITP (ScRR1-5-NITP) complex determined to 2.3 Å resolution shows that 5-NITP does not bind to the A-site but rather at the S-site. Regardless, 5-nitro-indolyl-2'-deoxynucleoside (5-NIdR) produces cytostatic and cytotoxic effects against human leukemia cells by altering cell-cycle progression. Our studies provide useful insights toward developing new inhibitors with improved potency and efficacy against hRR.
Behçet's disease (BD) is a chronic multi-system disease presenting with recurrent oral and genital ulceration, and relapsing uveitis. Heart rate recovery (HRR) after exercise is a marker of parasympathetic activity. A delayed recovery of systolic blood pressure (SBP) after exercise might reflect sympathetic hyperactivity. The analysis of variations in heart rate has also been used to determine the balance between sympathetic and vagal nerve activities in the heart. Our objective was to determine HRR, the SBP response to exercise and heart rate variability (HRV) in patients with BD in the absence of neurological involvement. The study population consisted of 32 patients with BD and 30 healthy controls who were matched with respect to age, sex, and physical activity. Heart rate recovery was calculated as the difference between heart rate at peak exercise and heart rate at 1, 2, and 3 min of recovery. Blood pressure recovery indexes were determined by dividing the systolic blood pressure at 2 and 3 min in recovery to the systolic blood pressure at peak exercise. In patients with BD, mean HRR at 1 min (HRR1) were not significantly different than that of controls (21 ± 7 vs 20 ± 7 bpm, p = 0.50). Although, resting mean SBP of patients with BD was higher than controls (121 ± 13 vs 115 ± 12 mmHg, p = 0.039), the SBP recovery indices of the patients with BD at 2 and 3 min were similar to those of controls (0.84 ± 0.07 vs 0.84 ± 0.09, p = 0.89 and 0.78 ± 0.09 vs 0.78 ± 0.08, p = 0.93, respectively). Both time domain and frequency domain parameters of patients with BD were similar to that of controls. This study shows that the patients with BD have normal HRR1 and normal SBP response to exercise and normal HRV. These findings might suggest unaltered autonomic neural control of the cardiovascular system in this disorder in the absence of neurological involvement.
Pericentromeric heterochromatin formation is mediated by repressive histone H3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9Me) and its recognition by HP1 proteins. Intriguingly, in many organisms, RNAi is coupled to this process through poorly understood mechanisms. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the H3-K9 methyltransferase Clr4 and the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) ortholog Swi6 are critical for RNAi, whereas RNAi stimulates H3K9Me. In addition to the endoribonuclease Dcr1, RNAi in S. pombe requires two interacting protein complexes, the RITS complex, which contains an Argonaute subunit, and the RDRC complex, which contains an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase subunit. We previously identified Ers1 (essential for RNAi-dependent silencing) as an orphan protein that genetically acts in the RNAi pathway. Using recombinant proteins, we show here that Ers1 directly and specifically interacts with HP1/Swi6. Two-hybrid assays indicate that Ers1 also directly interacts with several RNAi factors. Consistent with these interactions, Ers1 associates in vivo with the RITS complex, the RDRC complex, and Dcr1, and it promotes interactions between these factors. Ers1, like Swi6, is also required for RNAi complexes to associate with pericentromeric noncoding RNAs. Overexpression of Ers1 results in a dominant-negative phenotype that can be specifically suppressed by increasing levels of the RDRC subunit Hrr1 or of Dcr1, further supporting a functional role for Ers1 in promoting the assembly of the RNAi machinery. Through the interactions described here, Ers1 may promote RNAi by tethering the corresponding enzyme complexes to HP1-coated chromatin, thereby placing them in proximity to the nascent noncoding RNA substrate.
The association between premature ovarian failure (POF) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) was investigated previously, but none of the studies have looked at cardiac autonomic functions in these patients. In this study, we aimed to evaluate cardiac autonomic functions in patients with POF.
We enrolled 26 female patients (mean age 37.5 ± 10.1 years) with primary POF and 31 healthy subjects (mean age 37.5 ± 9.0 years). All participants underwent 24-h Holter recording. Heart rate recovery (HRR) indices were calculated by subtracting 1st-, 2nd- and 3rd-min heart rates from maximal heart rate. Heart rate variability (HRV) and heart rate turbulence (HRT) parameters were analyzed in all patients.
Both groups were similar with regard to age, gender, body mass index and left ventricular ejection fraction. Mean HRR1 (p = 0.018), HRR2 (p = 0.021) and HRR3 (p = 0.027) values were significantly higher in the control group. When HRV considered SDNN, SDANN, RMSSD, PNN50 and HF were significantly decreased in patients with POF compared to healthy controls, but LF and LF/HF were significantly higher in POF patients. Both HRT onset and slope were more abnormal in POF patients. Also, there was a significant correlation between HRR, HRV and HRT parameters and FSH, LH and estradiol levels.
Our study results suggest that cardiac autonomic function is impaired in patients with POF despite the absence of overt cardiac involvement and symptoms. Further studies are needed to elucidate the prognostic significance and clinical implications of impaired autonomic functions in patients with POF.
Autonomic manifestations regarding cardiac function in epilepsy are not rare and are being recognized with increasing frequency. The aim of this study was to assess autonomic function by measuring heart rate recovery (HRR), an index of vagal activity, in patients with epilepsy who were not taking any medication. Fourteen patients (eight with primary generalized epilepsy, four with secondary generalized epilepsy, and two with complex partial epilepsy) and 14 control subjects underwent exercise tolerance tests according to the modified Bruce protocol. HRR at 1 and 3 min (HRR1 and HRR3) were calculated. HRR1 and HRR3 were increased in patients with epilepsy. These results suggest increased parasympathetic function in epilepsy and support results of previous studies indicating autonomic dysfunction in epilepsy.
While patients with heart failure who achieve a peak oxygen uptake (peak VO2) of 10 mL·kg(-1)·min(-1) or less are often considered for intensive surveillance or intervention, those achieving 14 mL·kg(-1)·min(-1) or more are generally considered to be at lower risk. Among patients in the "intermediate" range of 10.1 to 13.9 mL·kg(-1)·min(-1), optimally stratifying risk remains a challenge.
Patients with heart failure (N = 1167) referred for cardiopulmonary exercise testing were observed for 21 ± 13 months. Patients were classified into 3 groups of peak VO2 (≤10, 10.1-13.9, and ≥14 mL·kg(-1)·min(-1)). The ability of heart rate recovery at 1 minute (HRR1) and the minute ventilation/carbon dioxide output (VE/VCO2) slope to complement peak VO2 in predicting cardiovascular mortality were determined.
Peak VO2, HRR1 (&lt;16 beats per minute), and the VE/VCO2 slope (&gt;34) were independent predictors of mortality (hazard ratio 1.6, 95% CI: 1.2-2.29, P = .006; hazard ratio 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1-2.5, P = .008; and hazard ratio 2.4, 95% CI: 1.6-3.4, P &lt; .001, respectively). Compared with those achieving a peak VO2 ≥ 14 mL·kg(-1)·min(-1), patients within the intermediate range with either an abnormal VE/VCO2 slope or HRR1 had a nearly 2-fold higher risk of cardiac mortality. Those with both an abnormal HRR1 and VE/VCO2 slope had a higher mortality risk than those with a peak VO2 ≤ 10 mL·kg(-1)·min(-1). Survival was not different between those with a peak VO2 ≤ 10 mL·kg(-1)·min(-1) and those in the intermediate range with either an abnormal HRR1 or VE/VCO2 slope.
HRR1 and the VE/VCO2 slope effectively stratify patients with peak VO2 within the intermediate range into distinct groups at high and low risk.
In fission yeast, the RNAi pathway is required for centromeric heterochromatin assembly. siRNAs derived from centromeric transcripts are incorporated into the RNA-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS) complex and direct it to nascent homologous transcripts. The RNA-induced transcriptional silencing-bound nascent transcripts further recruit the RNA-directed RNA polymerase complex (RDRC) to promote dsRNA synthesis and siRNA production. Heterochromatin coated with Swi6/Heterochromain Protein 1 is then formed following recruitment of chromatin modification machinery. Swi6 is also required for the upstream production of siRNA, although the mechanism for this has remained obscure. Here, we demonstrate that Swi6 recruits RDRC to heterochromatin through Ers1, an RNAi factor intermediate. An ers1(+) mutant allele (ers1-C62) was identified in a genetic screen for mutants that alleviate centromeric silencing, and this phenotype was suppressed by overexpression of either the Hrr1 RDRC subunit or Clr4 histone H3-K9 methyltransferase. Ers1 physically interacts with Hrr1, and loss of Ers1 impairs RDRC centromeric localization. Although Ers1 failed to bind Clr4, a direct interaction with Swi6 was detected, and centromeric localization of Swi6 was enhanced by Clr4 overexpression in ers1-C62 cells. Consistent with this, deletion of swi6(+) reduced centromeric localization of Ers1 and RDRC. Moreover, tethering of Ers1 or Hrr1 to centromeric heterochromatin partially bypassed Swi6 function. These findings demonstrate an alternative mechanism for RDRC recruitment and explain the essential role of Swi6/Heterochromain Protein 1 in RNAi-directed heterochromatin assembly.
In Neurospora crassa, genes lacking a pairing partner during meiosis are suppressed by a process known as meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA (MSUD). To identify novel MSUD components, we have developed a high-throughput reverse-genetic screen for use with the N. crassa knockout library. Here we describe the screening method and the characterization of a gene (sad-3) subsequently discovered. SAD-3 is a putative helicase required for MSUD and sexual spore production. It exists in a complex with other known MSUD proteins in the perinuclear region, a center for meiotic silencing activity. Orthologs of SAD-3 include Schizosaccharomyces pombe Hrr1, a helicase required for RNAi-induced heterochromatin formation. Both SAD-3 and Hrr1 interact with an RNA-directed RNA polymerase and an Argonaute, suggesting that certain aspects of silencing complex formation may be conserved between the two fungal species.
Reduced heart rate recovery after exercise is associated with increased mortality in cardiopulmonary diseases.
We sought to evaluate the association between heart rate recovery at 1 minute of rest (HRR1) after 6-min walk test (6MW test) and clinical worsening in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH).
HRR1 was defined as the difference in heart rate at the end of 6MW test and at 1 minute after completion of the 6MW test. Between August 1, 2009 and March 30, 2010, 75 consecutive patients with IPAH underwent 6MW test and were included in the analysis.
Compared with patients with HRR1 ≥ 16 (n = 45 [60%]), those with HRR1 less than 16 (n = 30 [40%]) were more likely to have clinical worsening (odds ratio, 9.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3-30; P &lt; 0.001) and shorter time to first clinical worsening event (TCW) (6.7 mo vs. 13 mo; P &lt; 0.001) during follow-up. By multivariable analysis, the best predictors of clinical worsening were HRR1 less than 16 (hazard ratio, 5.2; 95% CI, 1.8-14.8; P = 0.002) and mean pulmonary arterial pressure (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.007-1.08; P = 0.02). Compared with the distance walked during the 6MW test (6MWD), HRR1 less than 16 was a better predictor of clinical worsening (C statistic 0.757 vs. 0.703) and TCW (C index 0.730 vs. 0.696). The addition of HRR1 increased the ability of 6MWD to predict clinical worsening events.
HRR1 after 6MW test is a strong predictor of clinical worsening and TCW in patients with IPAH. The addition of HRR1 to 6MWD increases the capacity of 6MWD to predict clinical worsening and TCW in patients with IPAH.
Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is characterized by sporadic, acute attacks of fever and serositis. Cardiovascular involvement is one of the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among FMF patients. Herein, we aimed to evaluate cardiac autonomic functions in FMF patients without overt cardiac symptoms.
We enrolled 38 patients (20 female; mean age 34.4 ± 10.2 years) with FMF and 34 healthy subjects (18 female; mean age 33.2 ± 9.3 years). All participants underwent 24-hour Holter recording. Heart rate recovery (HRR) indices were calculated by subtracting first, second, and third minute heart rates from maximal heart rate. All patients underwent heart rate variability (HRV), heart rate turbulance (HRT) and QT dispersion analysis. The mean FMF duration was 9.8 ± 4.2 years.
Both groups were similar with regard to baseline characteristics. Mean HRR1 (p=0.001), HRR2 (p=0.003) and HRR3 (p&lt;0.001) were significantly lower in FMF group. SDNN (standard deviation of all NN intervals), SDANN (SD of the 5 min mean RR intervals), RMSSD (root square of successive differences in RR interval), and PNN50 (proportion of differences in successive NN intervals &gt;50 ms) and high-frequency (HF) components were significantly decreased, but low frequency (LF) and LF/HF were significantly higher in FMF patients. HRT onset and slope were significantly less negative in FMF patients. Also, QTd was significantly higher in FMF patients (p&lt;0.001).
Patients with FMF showed delayed recovery of heart rate and abnormal HRV and HRT parameters with respect to normal subjects. Cardiac autonomic functions might be involved in FMF patients even in patients without cardiac symptoms.
Cardiovascular involvement is one of the leading causes of death among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In this study, we aimed to investigate cardiac autonomic functions in SLE patients.
We enrolled 36 patients (25 female; mean age 34.2 ± 10.2 years) with SLE and 32 healthy subjects (23 female; mean age 35.0 ± 10.3 years). All participants underwent 24-h Holter recording. Heart rate recovery (HRR) indices were calculated by subtracting first, second, and third-minute heart rates from maximal heart rate. All patients underwent heart rate variability (HRV), heart rate turbulence (HRT) and QT dispersion analysis. The mean SLE duration was 8.4 ± 4.0 years.
According to the baseline demographic characteristics, both groups were similar with regard to age, gender, body mass index and left ventricular ejection fraction. Mean HRR1 (32.6 ± 10.9 vs. 42.5 ± 6.5, p = 0.038), HRR2 (51.0 ± 16.9 vs. 61.0 ± 10.8, p = 0.01) and HRR3 (52.8 ± 17.5 vs. 65.8 ± 9.8, p &lt; 0.001) values were significantly higher in control group. When HRV was considered, SDNN, SDANN, RMSSD, PNN50 and high frequency (HF) component were significantly decreased in patients with SLE compared with healthy controls, but low frequency (LF) component and LF/HF were significantly higher in SLE patients. In addition, HRT onset and HRT slope values were significantly less negative in SLE patients. QT dispersion was significantly greater in SLE patients than healthy subjects (81.3 ± 15.8 vs. 53.2 ± 13.1, p &lt; 0.001).
Our study results suggest that cardiac autonomic functions are impaired in SLE patients despite the absence of overt cardiac involvement and symptoms. Further studies are needed to elucidate the prognostic significance and clinical implications of impaired autonomic functions in patients with SLE.
There is limited research available regarding a possible relationship between resting heart rate variability (HRV) and post-exercise heart rate recovery (HRR). The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between resting HRV and HRR after maximal exercise.
Sixty-six college age men participated in this study. HRV was measured in a supine position before and for 30 min after a maximal exercise test on a treadmill. HRV was assessed in the time (i.e., SDNN) and frequency (i.e., normalized HF power [HFnu] and normalized LF:HF ratio [LFnu:HFnu]) domains. Heart rate was recorded at maximal exercise (MHR), and at 1- (HR1) and 2- (HR2) min of the cool-down recovery period. HRR was determined from the difference between MHR and HR1 (HRR1) and the difference between MHR and HR2 (HRR2).
No significant relationship was found between resting HRV and HRR1 or HRR2. However, SDNN was significantly inversely correlated to MHR (P &lt; 0.05), and HFnu was significantly inversely correlated to MHR (P &lt; 0.01), HR1 (P &lt; 0.01), and HR2 (P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, MHR accounted for the greatest variation in both SDNN and HFnu (P &lt; 0.05).
Therefore, the HRV may not be related to the recovery of HR expressed as a slope (i.e., HRR) within 2 min following a maximal exercise test. This is possibly due to a significant inverse relationship between HRV and MHR, HR1 and HR2 post-maximal exercise.
Impaired heart rate recovery after exercise (HRR) is a marker of autonomic dysfunction and a predictor of long-term mortality either directly or due to associated cardiovascular disease. In a cohort of 552 asymptomatic type 2 diabetics (age 63.2 ± 5.4 yr, 54.9% women) participating in a long-term prospective outcomes study, we examined the hypothesis that cardiac autonomic dysfunction, as demonstrated by HRR in the first minute after exercise, is an independent correlate of multivessel coronary artery atheroma. HRR1 was reduced in patients with any coronary plaque (p = 0.012), multivessel coronary plaque (p = 0.006), and coronary stenosis (p = 0.027). However, the association was not independent of the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study risk score thus it appears to be related to the adverse risk profile of these patients.
In patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), our objectives were to identify predictors of abnormal heart rate recovery (HRR) at 1 min after completion of a 6-min walk test (6MWT) [HRR1] and 2 min after completion of a 6MWT (HRR2), and to determine whether abnormal HRR predicts mortality.
From 2003 to 2008, we identified IPF patients who had been evaluated at our center (n = 76) with a pulmonary physiologic examination and the 6MWT. We used logistic regression to identify predictors of abnormal HRR, the product-limit method to compare survival in the sample stratified on HRR, and Cox proportional hazards analysis to estimate the prognostic capability of abnormal HRR.
Cutoff values were 13 beats for abnormal HRR1 and 22 beats for HRR2. In a multivariable model, predictors of abnormal HRR1 were diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (odds ratio [OR], 0.4 per 10% predicted; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.2 to 0.7; p = 0.003), change in heart rate from baseline to maximum (OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.8 to 0.97; p = 0.01), and having a right ventricular systolic pressure &gt; 35 mm Hg as determined by transthoracic echocardiogram (OR, 12.7; 95% CI, 2.0 to 79.7; p = 0.01). Subjects with an abnormal HRR had significantly worse survival than subjects with a normal HRR (for HRR1, p = 0.0007 [log-rank test]; for HRR2, p = 0.03 [log-rank test]); these results held for the subgroup of 30 subjects without resting pulmonary hypertension (HRR1, p = 0.04 [log-rank test]). Among several candidate variables, abnormal HRR1 appeared to be the most potent predictor of mortality (hazard ratio, 5.2; 95% CI, 1.8 to 15.2; p = 0.004).
Abnormal HRR after 6MWT predicts mortality in IPF patients. Research is needed to confirm these findings prospectively and to examine the mechanisms of HRR in IPF patients.
The pathogenesis of tension-type headache (TTH) is poorly understood. TTH is mostly associated with the sympathetic nervous system. Reports considering autonomic nervous system functioning with regard to TTH are limited. Autonomic nervous system disorders could however play a role in the etiopathology of TTH. Compared with sympathetic nervous system functioning, techniques for evaluating parasympathetic nervous system activity are more limited. Therefore, the aim of the study was to measure heart rate recovery (HRR), an index of vagal activity, in TTH patients. Thirty-seven patients with TTH (15 with episodic and 22 with chronic TTH) and 37 control subjects underwent exercise tolerance testing according to modified Bruce protocol. Heart rate recovery (HRR) at 1 and 3 minutes (HRR1 and HRR3) were calculated. HRR 1 and 3 were found to be similar in patients and controls. However the resting heart rate in patients with episodic TTH was found to be significantly lower than the resting heart rate in patients with chronic TTH and control subjects. These results suggest that parasympathetic nervous system function is not affected in TTH patients. However sympathetic nervous system tonus, which is evaluated by resting heart rate, is low in patients with episodic TTH, suggesting sympathetic hypofunction.
There are reports proposing that migraine and tension-type headache (TTH) may affect the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Abnormalities in both sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system have been suggested in migraineurs. However, in TTH, reports on the ANS function are limited and only associated with sympathetic system. Techniques for evaluating parasympathetic activity are more limited when compared with sympathetic function. Hence, the aim of the study was to measure heart rate recovery (HRR), an index of vagal activity, in migraine, TTH, and control subjects.
Forty-seven episodic migraine, 10 episodic TTH, 11 chronic TTH, and 25 control subjects underwent exercise tolerance test according to modified Bruce protocol, and HRR at 1 minute and 3 minutes (HRR1 and HRR3) were calculated.
The HRR 1 and 3 were found to be similar in 3 groups of subjects. However, resting heart rate of migraine and chronic TTH were found to be higher than episodic TTH, but not different from the control group.
These results suggest that parasympathetic function has not been affected in migraine and TTH patients. However, sympathetic tonus, which is evaluated by resting heart rate, is higher in migraine and chronic TTH than in episodic TTH.
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is frequently accompanied by the presence of cardiovascular risk factors. It has also been recognized that there is a significant relationship between the autonomic nervous system and adverse cardiac events. Heart rate recovery (HRR) after exercise is a marker of parasympathetic activity and attenuation of this parameter has been shown to be associated with increased cardiac mortality. A delayed recovery of systolic blood pressure (SBP) after peak exercise has been found to have diagnostic value and might reflect sympathetic hyperactivity. The analysis of variations in heart rate has also been used to determine the balance between sympathetic and vagal nerve activities in the heart. Our objective was to determine HRR, the SBP response to exercise and heart rate variability (HRV) in patients with PCOS.
The study population consisted of 26 untreated patients with PCOS and 24 healthy controls who were matched with respect to age, body mass index and physical activity. All subjects underwent symptom-limited exercise tolerance test according to a modified Bruce protocol. Following peak exercise, subjects walked a 2-min cool-down period. Heart rate recovery was calculated as the difference between heart rate at peak exercise and heart rate at the relevant minute of recovery. Blood pressure recovery indexes were determined by dividing the systolic blood pressure at 1, 2 and 3 min in recovery to the systolic blood pressure at peak exercise.
HRR at 1 min (HRR1) of the patients with PCOS were significantly lower than that of controls (20+/-4 vs 28+/-8 bpm, p&lt;0.0001). Although, resting SBP of the two groups were similar (117+/-7 vs 117+/-10 mmHg, p=0.663), the SBP of the patients with PCOS at peak exercise were significantly higher when compared to controls (172+/-12 vs 156+/-14 mmHg, p&lt;0.0001). In addition, the SBP of the patients with PCOS remained significantly elevated when compared to controls at the first, second and third minute of recovery (168+/-13 vs 148+/-15 mmHg, 162+/-13 vs 136+/-16 mmHg, 152+/-17 vs 127+/-15 mmHg, respectively, p&lt;0.0001 for all three). The SBP recovery index at 2 and 3 min of the patients with PCOS were significantly higher than that of controls (0.93+/-0.04 vs 0.87+/-0.07, p&lt;0.0001 and 0.87+/-0.07 vs 0.82+/-0.09, p=0.017, respectively). Both time domain and frequency domain parameters of patients with PCOS were significantly lower than that of controls.
This study shows that the patients with PCOS have attenuated HRR1, exaggerated SBP response to exercise which is delayed to recover and a depressed HRV. These findings might also suggest alterations in autonomic neurol control of the cardiovascular system in this disorder.
Assembly of heterochromatin at centromeric DNA regions in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe involves an intimate interplay between chromatin modifying complexes and components of the RNAi pathway. The RNA-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS) complex, containing Chp1, Ago1, Tas3, and centromeric siRNAs, localizes to centromeric DNA repeats and is required for the assembly and maintenance of heterochromatin. RITS brings together two types of molecular recognition modules: a chromodomain protein, which binds to lysine 9 methylated histone H3 (H3K9), and Argonaute, which binds to specific sequences by siRNA-directed base-pairing interactions. The RNA-directed RNA polymerase complex (RDRC), composed of Rdp1, the Hrr1 helicase, and the Cid12 Poly(A) polymerase family member, synthesizes double-stranded RNA and creates the substrate for Dicer to generate siRNAs. RDRC physically associates with RITS, and both complexes localize to noncoding centromeric RNAs and centromeric DNA repeats, suggesting that recognition of nascent RNA transcripts may be involved in localization of these complexes to specific chromosome regions. In support of this possibility, tethering of the RITS complex to the transcript of the normally euchromatic ura4 (+) gene results in siRNA generation and RNAi- and heterochromatin-dependent silencing of the ura4 (+) gene. Finally, silencing of a subset of endogenous and transgene promoters within heterochromatic DNA domains occurs by RNAi-dependent degradation of nascent transcripts by a mechanism that we have termed co-transcriptional gene silencing (CTGS).
Heart rate recovery at 1min (HRR1) is a strong predictor of all-cause mortality. The effects of statins on the autonomic nervous system may account for their beneficial effects in survival. Our aim was to determine if statin therapy improves heart rate recovery in hypercholesterolemic patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Thirty type 2 diabetic patients without known coronary artery disease and low density lipoprotein cholesterol&gt;100mg/dl and 30 age and sex matched non-diabetic controls were included in a prospective study. Patients with diabetes were treated with simvastatin 40mg/day for 1 year. No lipid-lowering therapy was administered to the control group. Exercise testing with 2min cool-down period was performed at baseline, 6, 12 weeks and at 1 year. The diabetics had significantly lower HRR1 compared with non-diabetics at baseline (19.2+/-5.4bpm versus 24.2+/-4bpm, p&lt;0.0001). Simvastatin therapy significantly improved HRR1 after 12 weeks compared to baseline (19.2+/-5.4bpm versus 24+/-5bpm, p&lt;0.0001) and this improvement remained significant at 1 year (26+/-4.4bpm, p&lt;0.0001 compared to baseline). HRR1 did not change in the control group (p=0.39 by ANOVA). This study demonstrates that treatment with simvastatin might improve the attenuated heart rate recovery of diabetic subjects. In patients with diabetes, the mortality benefit provided by statins might involve their effects on the autonomic nervous system.
The rate in which heart rate recovers from exercise has recently been shown to be a strong predictor of mortality in patients suspected of having coronary disease, but its prognostic value in patients with heart failure (HF) has not been explored. We sought to assess the prognostic utility of heart rate recovery (HRR) in patients with HF.
Eighty-seven subjects diagnosed with compensated HF underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX). Mean age and ejection fraction were 50.0 (+/-13.9) years and 28.1% (+/-13.6%), respectively. Heart rate at 1-minute post-CPX was subtracted from maximal heart rate during the exercise test to produce a measure of HRR1 in beats per minute. Subjects were followed for a combined death/hospitalization end point for 1-year after CPX.
The mean peak respiratory exchange ratio, peak oxygen consumption (VO2), minute ventilation/carbon dioxide production (VE/VCO2) slope, and HRR1 were 1.06 (+/-0.11), 14.8 (+/-4.7) mL.kg(-1).min(-1), 36.6 (+/-8.6), and 11.0 (+/-10.4) beat/min, respectively. Although all three variables were significant univariate predictors of the composite end point (P &lt; .001), multivariate Cox regression analysis only retained the VE/VCO2 slope (chi2 = 33.5, P &lt; .001) and HRR1 (residual chi2 = 15.0, P &lt; .001) in the equation. The hazard ratio for subjects having both an abnormal VE/VCO2 slope (&gt; 34.4) and HRR1 (&lt; 6.5 beat/min) value was 9.2 (95% CI 4.5-18.5, P &lt; .0001).
These results indicate that HRR provides additional prognostic information in patients with HF undergoing CPX. Moreover, given the independent prognostic value of HRR, this variable alone may provide valuable clinical information when ventilatory expired gas analysis is not available.
Heart rate recovery (HRR1) immediately after exercise reflects parasympathetic activity, which is markedly attenuated in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients. The aim of our study was to examine both continuous and interval exercise training effects on HRR1 in these patients.
The population study consisted of 29 stable CHF patients that participated at a rehabilitation program of 36 sessions, three times per week. Of the 29 patients, 24 completed the program. Patients were randomly assigned to interval {n=10 [100% peak work rate (WRp) for 30 s, alternating with rest for 30 s]} and to continuous training [n=14 (50%WRp)].
All patients performed a symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise test on a cycle ergometer before and after the completion of the program. Measurements included peak oxygen uptake (VO2p), anaerobic threshold (AT), WRp, first degree slope of VO2 during the first minute of recovery (VO2/t-slope), chronotropic response [% chronotropic reserve (CR)=(peak HR - resting HR)x100/(220 - age - resting HR)], HRR1 (HR difference from peak exercise to one minute after).
After the completion of the rehabilitation program there was a significant increase of WRp, VO2p, AT and VO2/t-slope (by 30%, P=0.01; 6%, P=0.01; 10%, P=0.02; and 27%, P=0.03 respectively for continuous training and by 21%, P&lt;0.05; 8%, P=0.01; 6%, P=NS; and 48%, P=0.02 respectively for interval training). However, only patients exercised under the continuous training regime had a significant increase in HRR1 (15.0+/-9.0 to 24.0+/-12 bpm; P=0.02) and CR (57+/-19 to 72+/-21%, P=0.02), in contrast with those assigned to interval training (HRR1: 21+/-11 to 21+/-8 bpm; P=NS and CR: 57+/-18 to 59+/-21%, P=NS).
Both continuous and interval exercise training program improves exercise capacity in CHF patients. However, continuous rather than interval exercise training improves early HRR1, a marker of parasympathetic activity, suggesting a greater contribution to the autonomic nervous system.
Patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) have multiple abnormalities of autonomic regulation that have been associated to their high mortality rate. Heart rate recovery immediately after exercise is an index of parasympathetic activity, but its prognostic role in CHF patients has not been determined yet.
Ninety-two stable CHF patients (83M/9F, mean age: 51+/-12 years) performed an incremental symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Measurements included peak O2 uptake (VO2p), ventilatory response to exercise (VE/VCO2 slope), the first-degree slope of VO2 for the 1st minute of recovery (VO2/t-slope), heart rate recovery [(HRR1, bpm): HR difference from peak to 1 min after exercise] and chronotropic response to exercise [%chronotropic reserve (CR, %)=(peak HR-resting HR/220-age-resting HR)x100]. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF, %) was also measured by radionuclide ventriculography.
Fatal events occurred in 24 patients (26%) during 21+/-6 months of follow-up. HRR1 was lower in non-survivors (11.4+/-6.4 vs. 20.4+/-8.1; p&lt;0.001). All cause-mortality rate was 65% in patients with HRR1&lt;or=12 bpm versus 11% in patients with HRR1&gt;12 bpm (log-rank: 32.6; p&lt;0.001). By multivariate survival analysis, HRR1 resulted as an independent predictor of mortality (chi2=19.2; odds ratio: 0.87; p&lt;0.001) after adjustment for LVEF, VO2p, VE/VCO2 slope, CR and VO2/t-slope. In a subgroup of patients with intermediate exercise capacity (VO2p: 10-18, ml/kg/min), HRR1 was a strong predictor of mortality (chi2: 14.3; odds ratio: 0.8; p&lt;0.001).
Early heart rate recovery is an independent prognostic risk indicator in CHF patients and could be used in CHF risk stratification.
RNAi-mediated heterochromatin assembly in fission yeast requires the RNA-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS) complex and a putative RNA-directed RNA polymerase (Rdp1). Here we show that Rdp1 is associated with two conserved proteins, Hrr1, an RNA helicase, and Cid12, a member of the polyA polymerase family, in a complex that has RNA-directed RNA polymerase activity (RDRC, RNA-directed RNA polymerase complex). RDRC physically interacts with RITS in a manner that requires the Dicer ribonuclease (Dcr1) and the Clr4 histone methyltransferase. Moreover, both complexes are localized to the nucleus and associate with noncoding centromeric RNAs in a Dcr1-dependent manner. In cells lacking Rdp1, Hrr1, or Cid12, RITS complexes are devoid of siRNAs and fail to localize to centromeric DNA repeats to initiate heterochromatin assembly. These findings reveal a physical and functional link between Rdp1 and RITS and suggest that noncoding RNAs provide a platform for siRNA-dependent localization of RNAi complexes to specific chromosome regions.
The purpose of this study was to determine if heart rate recovery (HRR) and heart rate variability (HRV) are related to maximal aerobic fitness and selected body composition measurements. Fifty men (age = 21.9 ± 3.0 years, height = 180.8 ± 7.2 cm, weight = 80.4 ± 9.1 kg, volunteered to participate in this study. For each subject, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and the sum of skinfolds across the chest, abdomen, and thigh regions (SUMSF) were recorded. Heart rate variability (HRV) was assessed during a 5-minute period while the subjects rested in a supine position. The following frequency domain parameters of HRV were recorded: normalized high-frequency power (HFnu), and low-frequency to high-frequency power ratio (LF:HF). To determine maximal aerobic fitness (i.e., VO2max), each subject performed a maximal graded exercise test on a treadmill. Heart rate recovery was recorded 1 (HRR1) and 2 (HRR2) minutes during a cool-down period. Mean VO2max and BMI for all the subjects were 49.5 ± 7.5 ml·kg(-1)·min(-1) and 24.7 ± 2.2 kg·m(-2), respectively. Although VO2max, WC, and SUMSF was each significantly correlated to HRR and HRV, only SUMSF had a significant independent correlation to HRR1, HRR2, HFnu, LF:HF (p &lt; 0.01). The results of the regression procedure showed that SUMSF accounted for the greatest variance in HRR1, HRR2, HFnu, and LF:HF (p &lt; 0.01). The results of this study suggest that cardiovascular autonomic modulation is significantly related to maximal aerobic fitness and body composition. However, SUMSF appears to have the strongest independent relationship with HRR and HRV, compared to other body composition parameters and VO2max.
The key to increase the percentage of cardiac patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation is to follow a well designed exercise programme at home. To maximise the benefits while minimising the risks of aggravating health status, home-based exercise should be tele-monitored.
To compare the effects on physical capacity and sympatho-vagal balance of two types of early cardiac rehabilitation in post-myocardial infarction (MI) male patients: the hybrid model, partly out-patient and partly home-based and tele-monitored vs standard rehabilitation performed only in the out-patient setting.
Sixty two male patients aged 54.7 ± 6.9 years, mean 27.3 ± 13.5 days after MI with preserved left ventricular systolic function (EF &gt; 50%) underwent an eight-week training programme consisting of 24 training sessions. After performing the first ten interval trainings on a cycloergometer, 30 patients (the hybrid group) exercised at home while being monitored via TeleECG, while 32 patients (the out-patient group) continued their rehabilitation in the out-patient clinic. At entry and after completion of the rehabilitation programme, all patients underwent a symptom-limited treadmill stress test. The following parameters were analysed: maximal workload (METs), exercise duration (ED, min), heart rate (HR, bpm), blood pressure (BP, mm Hg), double product i.e. product of HR and systolic BP at rest and at peak exercise (DP, mm Hg/min, HR × systolic BP), and HR recovery (HRR) in the first and second minute of the recovery period.
Maximal workload (out-patient: 7.3 ± 1.4 vs 7.8 ± 1.2, p &lt; 0.05; hybrid: 8.5 ± 1.8 vs 9.9 ± 2.2, p &lt; 0.01) and ED (out-patient: 10.1 ± 2.0 vs 13.5 ± 1.4, p &lt; 0.001; hybrid: 10.9 ± 3.6 vs 12.5 ± 4.1, p &lt; 0.05) increased significantly in both study groups. The remaining parameters did not change significantly, except for HRR1 (22.1 ± 8.7 vs 29.5 ± 10.7, p &lt; 0.01) and HRR2 (37.9 ± 9.5 vs 43.8 ± 10.7, p &lt; 0.01), which improved in the hybrid group only. Moreover, there were no significant differences between the study groups when comparing the training-induced percentage changes in the analysed parameters.
1. Hybrid rehabilitation improved physical capacity and positively influenced the sympatho-vagal balance in post-MI male patients with preserved left ventricular systolic function. 2. The hybrid model was effective and comparable with standard out-patient-based programme.
To evaluate influence of Bone Marrow Stem Cells (BMSC) intracoronary infusion on exercise capacity, pulmonary function, heart rate recovery and SAECG in patients with AMI of anterior wall, compared to control group--from baseline in the acute phase during 12 months follow up.
Forty five patients were randomized 2:1 to BMSC group (n = 31 pts) or to control group (n = 14 pts). BMSC were administered into infarct related artery (IRA) at 4-6 day after primary PCI. Patients were followed up with cardiopulmonary exercise testing. The QRS duration, QT and QTc interval were measured and signal averaged ECGs (SAECG) were performed to evaluate late potentials.
There were no significant differences between both groups neither at peak VO(2) (190.7 ± 7.4 at baseline; 24.2 ± 5.2 at 6 months; 22.2 ± 7.4 ml/kg/min at 12 months vs 18.4 ± 8.2 at baseline; 22.0 ± 7.2 at 6 months; 21.8 ± 6.2 ml/kg/min at 12 months; BMSC vs control group respectively; p = ns), nor VO(2) at anaerobic threshold, nor in VE/VCO(2) slope, RER, and systolic blood pressure at peak exercise at baseline and any time point of follow-up. There were no significant differences between groups concerning HR peak, HRR1 and HRR2 at any time point and also QRS, QT parameters, and SAEKG. There were no significant differences between both groups at any time point (baseline, 6 and 12 months) concerning FVC, FEV(1) and FVC/FEV(1) and % of their normal values.
We did not find that BMSC therapy in patients with anterior wall myocardial infarction influences exercise capacity. We did not confirm it's potential proarrhythmogenic influence as assessed with SAECG and standard ECG analysis.
Heart rate recovery (HRR) after treadmill exercise testing is an index of cardiac autonomic activity in non-disabled persons, but it is unknown if this is also the case in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). We investigated the relationship between HRR after maximal arm exercise testing and resting autonomic activity in persons with paraplegia.
A total of 17 (male n = 9, female n = 8) active individuals with paraplegia (injury below T6) were included in the study. Frequency domain analyses of resting heart rate variability were obtained and participants completed a maximal arm exercise test. HRR was calculated as the difference between peak heart rate during the test and heart rate 1 min (HRR1) and 2 (HRR2) min after cessation of exercise.
HRR 1 and HRR 2 were statistically significantly correlated with high-frequency (HF) power (r = 0.46, p &lt; 0.05 and r = 0.47, p &lt; 0.05) and the LF/HF ratio (r = -0.49, p &lt; 0.05 and r = -0.50, p &lt; 0.05). After adjusting for age, peak heart rate and peak oxygen uptake, HRR 2 was still significantly associated with HF power (r = 0.50, p &lt; 0.05) and the LF/HF ratio (r = -0.58, p &lt; 0.05).
These findings indicate that HRR after maximal arm exercise testing is associated with resting cardiac autonomic activity in persons with paraplegia. This would suggest that HRR after maximal arm exercise testing can be used as an index of autonomic function in this population.
Heart rate (HR) recovery (HRR), defined as the rate of decline in the HR immediately following the cessation of exercise, is influenced by autonomic function. Heart rate recovery in heart failure (HF) has been shown to correlate with severity of HF. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) improves cardiac autonomic functions in HF. We aimed to evaluate the effects of CRT on cardiac autonomic function assessed by HRR.
Forty-eight patients [62.3 ± 10.7 years; 37 men; left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction 24.8 ± 4.1%] with HF were enrolled. A treadmill exercise testing was conducted in all patients by using a modified Naughton protocol before and 6 months after CRT. Heart rate recovery indices were calculated by subtracting first, second, and third minute HR from the maximal HR and designated as HRR1, HRR2, and HRR3, respectively. Standard echocardiography was performed before and 6 months after CRT. Left ventricular reverse remodelling (LVRM) was quantified as the percentage of decline in the LV end-systolic volume after CRT. Mean HRR1 (13.0 ± 5.9 vs. 17.9 ± 8.9 b.p.m., P = 0.001), HRR2 (20.5 ± 9.3 vs. 23.8 ± 11.3 b.p.m., P = 0.001), and HRR3 (25.7 ± 11.1 vs. 29.2 ± 12.0 b.p.m., P = 0.001) values improved 6 months after CRT. Pearson's analyses revealed a good positive correlation between LVRM and ΔHRR1 (r = 0.642, P = 0.001) and a moderate correlation between reduction LVRM and ΔHRR2 (r = 0.591, P = 0.033) and ΔHRR3 (r = 0.436, P = 0.001).
Cardiac resynchronization therapy favourably alters the cardiac autonomic functions. Heart rate recovery indices improved after CRT and the degree of improvement in HRR indices correlated with LVRM.
The purpose of this study was to test the hypotheses that in obese children: 1) hypocaloric diet (D) improves both heart rate recovery at 1 min (Δ HRR1) cfter an exercise test, and cardiac autonomic nervous system activity (CANSA) in obese children; 2) Diet and exercise training (DET) combined leads to greater improvement in both Δ HRR1 after an exercise test and in CANSA, than D alone. Moreover, we examined the relationships among Δ HRR1, CANSA, cardiorespiratory fitness and anthropometric variables (AV) in obese children submitted to D and to DET. 33 obese children (10 ± 0.2 years; body mass index (BMI) &gt;95 (th) percentile) were divided into 2 groups: D (n=15; BMI=31 ± 1 kg/m²)) and DET (n=18; 29 ± 1 kg/m²). All children performed a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test on a treadmill. The Δ HRR1 or LF/HF ratio (P&gt;0.05). In contrast, the DET group showed increased peak VO₂ ( P=0.01) and improved Δ HRR1 (Δ HRR1=37.3 ± 2.6; P=0.01) and LF/HF ratio ( P=0.001). The DET group demonstrated significant relationships among Δ HRR1, peak VO₂ and CANSA (P&lt;0.05). In conclusion, DET, in contrast to D, promoted improved ÄΔ HRR1 and CANSA in obese children, suggesting a positive influence of increased levels of cardiorespiratory fitness by exercise training on cardiac autonomic activity.
In patients with IPF, we sought to validate that abnormal heart rate recovery at 1 min (HRR1) after six-minute walk test (6MWT) predicts mortality and to explore the relationship between abnormal HRR1 and pulmonary hypertension (PH).
We identified IPF patients who performed a 6MWT as part of their clinical evaluation between 2006 and 2009 and were followed to lung transplantation or death. Right heart catheterization (RHC) data were collated and analysed for the subgroup who had this procedure.
There were 160 subjects who qualified for the survival analysis, and those with an abnormal HRR1 had worse survival than subjects with normal HRR1 (log-rank P = 0.01). Eighty-two subjects had a right heart catheter (RHC); among them, abnormal HRR1 was associated with RHC-confirmed PH (χ(2) = 4.83, P = 0.03) and had a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 52%, 74%, 41% and 82%, respectively, for PH. In bivariate and multivariable analyses, abnormal HRR1 appeared to be the strongest predictor of RHC-confirmed PH (odds ratio (OR) = 4.0, 95% CI: 1.17-13.69, P = 0.02 in the multivariable analysis).
This study adds to data that support the validity of abnormal HRR1 as a predictor of mortality and of RHC-confirmed PH in IPF. Research is needed to further investigate the link between abnormal HRR1 and PH and to elucidate heart-lung interactions at work during exercise and recovery in patients with IPF.
Conditions that may influence heart rate recovery at 1 min of recovery from exercise (HRR1: end-exercise heart rate minus heart rate 1 min after exercise) are not fully understood. We hypothesized that the 'importance' (both local severity and regional diffusion) of peripheral skeletal muscle ischaemia is associated with low HRR1.
In 529 patients with suspected or confirmed peripheral vascular disease not receiving beta-blockers (61·4 ± 11·3 years old), we retrospectively studied the relationship of HRR1 to exercise-induced changes in transcutaneous oxygen DROP index (limb changes minus chest changes from rest). The sum of DROP indices observed on both calves and both buttocks (DROPtot) provides the unique opportunity to estimate both the severity and the diffusion of exercise-induced ischaemia on the right and left side simultaneously. It was used during a constant-load treadmill test (3·2 km h(-1) ; 10% grade) to classify patients in quartiles, the fourth quartile representing the more 'important' ischaemias.
There was an inverse relationship between quartiles of DROPtot and HRR1, even after adjustment for heart rate reserve (Delta HR: end-exercise minus resting heart rate), age (≤ or &gt;60 years), gender, body mass index, treadmill maximal walking distance and ankle brachial index: adjusted R = 0·629; P&lt;0·0001.
During constant-load treadmill testing, DROPtot, an index of the 'importance' of exercise-induced lower-limb ischaemia, correlates with HRR1. Whether HRR1 is improved in proportion of DROPtot improvement in patients undergoing surgery or rehabilitation for peripheral artery disease is a fascinating issue for future studies.
The aim of the present cross-sectional study was to evaluate heart rate recovery (HRR) in normotensive and hypertensive individuals with either nondipper or dipper type circadian rhythm of blood pressure. Eighty-five patients were divided into 4 groups according to the presence of hypertension and pattern of circadian blood pressure as follows: (1) normotensive/dipper, n=20; (2) normotensive/nondipper, n=21; (3) hypertensive/dipper, n=22; and (4) hypertensive/nondipper, n=22. HRR indices were calculated by subtracting first, second, and third minute heart rates from the maximal heart rate obtained during stress testing and designated as HRR1, HRR2, and HRR3. Mean HRR1 values (29.7+/-4.0 vs 26.6+/-3.7, P=.016) were significantly higher in the normotensive/dipper group than the normotensive/nondipper group. Mean HRR1 values (28.6+/-4.0 vs 24.8+/-4.6 beats per minute, P=.007) were higher in the hypertensive/dipper group than the hypertensive/nondipper group. Spearman's correlation analyses revealed a positive correlation between degree of nighttime dipping and HRR1 (r=.600, P=.001). The correlation coefficient between degree of nighttime dipping and HRR1 was higher in the hypertensive group than the normotensive group (r=.676, P=.001 and r=.575, P=.001, respectively). Blunting of the nocturnal fall in blood pressure associates with a delayed recovery of heart rate after graded maximal exercise in both normotensive and hypertensive groups.
The aim of this study was to evaluate heart rate variability (HRV) and heart rate recovery (HRR) in otherwise healthy ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients and control subjects.
A total of 28 patients with AS and 30 volunteers matched for age and sex were enrolled. All subjects underwent HRV analysis, exercise testing (ET), and transthoracic echocardiography. HRR indices were calculated by subtracting first, second, and third minute heart rates (HR) from the maximal HR.
The AS and control groups were similar with respect to age (28.7 ± 5.7 vs. 29.3 ± 5.8 years), gender distribution [(male/female) 24/4 vs. 26/4], and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (63.8 ± 2.8% vs. 65.7 ± 3.6%). Mean HRR1 (24.8 ± 4.2 vs. 28.8 ± 5.5, P = 0.001) and HRR2 (42.0 ± 4.4 vs. 48.0 ± 6.3, P = 0.001) values were significantly higher in control group. SDNN, SDANN, RMSDD, and PNN50 significantly decreased; LF and LF/HF increased in AS patients compared with control subjects.
Patients with AS has lower HRR and HRV indices with respect to normal subjects. Cardiac autonomic functions might be involved in AS patients even in patients without cardiac symptoms.
Previous investigations have reported a relationship between variables obtained from echocardiography with tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX) in systolic heart failure (HF) cohorts. The purpose of the present investigation was to perform a comparative analysis between echocardiography with TDI and CPX in patients with HF and normal ejection fraction (NEF).
Patients with HF-NEF (N = 32) underwent echocardiography with TDI and CPX to determine the following variables: (1) the ratio between mitral early velocity (E) and mitral annular velocity (E'), (2) ejection fraction, (3) left ventricular (LV) mass, (4) left ventricular end systolic volume, (5) peak oxygen uptake (.VO2), (6) ventilatory efficiency, (7) the partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (P(ET)CO2) at rest and peak exercise, and (8) heart rate recovery at 1 minute (HRR1).
Pearson correlation revealed that E/E' was significantly correlated with peak oxygen uptake (r = -0.55, P = .001), the ventilatory efficiency slope (r = 0.60, P &lt; .001), resting P(ET)CO2 (r = -0.39, P = .03), peak P(ET)CO2 (r = -0.50, P = .004), and HRR1 (r = -0.63, P &lt; .001). Left ventricular mass and left ventricular end systolic volume were not correlated with any CPX variable. Ejection fraction was correlated with HRR1 (r = -0.55, P = .001). An HRR1 threshold of less than 16 and/or 16 or more beats per minute (higher value positive) effectively identified subjects with an E/E' &gt; 10 (positive likelihood ratio: 13:2).
E/E' provides an accurate reflection of LV filling pressure and thus, insight into diastolic function. The results of the present investigation indicate CPX provides insight into cardiac dysfunction in patients with HF-NEF and thus, may eventually prove to be a valuable and accepted clinical assessment.
Dynamic pupillometry (DP) is a simple, non-invasive computerized technique for assessment of pupillary light response which provides data concerning the balance of both branches of the autonomous nervous system (ANS). Heart rate (HR) recovery (HRR) after graded exercise reflects cardiac autonomic activity and predicts cardiovascular events. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the utility of DP as a predictor of cardiac autonomic activity assessed by HRR.
A total of 62 consecutive healthy subjects (mean age = 33.7 ± 8.6 years, 39 males and 23 females) were enrolled. Pupil diameters (R0, R1, R2 and R%): latency (Lc), amplitude (Ac), velocity (Vc) and duration of pupil contraction (Tc): latency (Ld), velocity (Vd) and duration of pupil dilatation (Td) were measured in DP. HRR indices were calculated by subtracting 1st (HRR1), 2nd (HRR2) and 3rd (HRR3) minute HR from the maximal HR during treadmill exercise stress test.
HRR1 was 32.9 ± 8.0 bpm, HRR2 was 55.1 ± 11.6 bpm and HRR3 was 58.3 ± 12.7 bpm, respectively. Correlation analysis revealed significant positive correlations of HRR1 with Vc (r = 0.660, p = 0.001), Ac (r = 0.559, p = 0.001) and Vd (r = 0.412, p = 0.001). HRR had significant negative correlations with Lc (r = -0.442, p = 0.001), R% (r = -0.384, p = 0.002) and Ld (r = -0.286, p = 0.025). Vc [β = 3.995 (1.040 to 6.951, 95% CI, p = 0.009)] and Lc [β = -0.032 (-0.056 to -0.008, 95% CI, p = 0.01)] were found to be significant independent predictors of HRR1.
Pupillary autonomic functions assessed by DP correlates with cardiac autonomic functions evaluated by HRR. Among the DP parameters analyzed, Vc and Lc were independent predictors of cardiac autonomic functions.
The aim of this study was to assess exercise heart rate recovery (HRR) indices in mercury-exposed individuals when evaluating their cardiac autonomic function.
Twenty-eight mercury-exposed individuals and 28 healthy controls were enrolled. All the subjects underwent exercise testing and transthoracic echocardiography. The HRR indices were calculated by subtracting the first- (HRR1), second- (HRR2) and third-minute (HRR3) heart rates from the maximal heart rate. The two groups were evaluated in terms of exercise test parameters, especially HRR, and a correlation analysis was performed between blood, 24-hour urine and hair mercury levels and the test parameters.
The mercury-exposed and control groups were similar in age (37.2 ± 6.6 vs. 36.9 ± 9.0 years), had an identical gender distribution (16 females and 12 males) and similar left ventricular ejection fractions (65.5 ± 3.1 vs. 65.4 ± 3.1%). The mean HRR1 [25.6 ± 6.5 vs. 30.3 ± 8.2 beats per min (bpm); p = 0.009], HRR2 (43.5 ± 5.3 vs. 47.8 ± 5.5 bpm; p = 0.010) and HRR3 (56.8 ± 5.1 vs. 59.4 ± 6.3 bpm; p = 0.016) values were significantly lower in the mercury-exposed group than in the healthy controls. However, there were no significant correlations between blood, urine and hair mercury levels and exercise test parameters.
Mercury-exposed individuals had lower HRR indices than normal subjects. In these individuals, mercury exposure measurements did not show correlations with the exercise test parameters, but age did show a negative correlation with these parameters. Therefore, cardiac autonomic functions might be involved in cases of mercury exposure.
Heart rate recovery (HHR) after exercise is a function of vagal reactivation. This study aimed to evaluate HHR index in patients with erectile dysfunction.
Men over the age of 18 years who were diagnosed with erectile dysfunction were included in the study. Ninety patients with erectile dysfunction (mean age=56.1±8.3 years) and 50 healthy subjects as controls (mean age=53.1±10.4 years) were compared. The erectile status of patients was evaluated using the sexual health inventory for men questionnaire. Basal electrocardiography, echocardiography, and treadmill exercise testing were performed in all patients and controls. The HHR index was defined as the reduction in heart rate from the rate at peak exercise to the rate at the first minute (HRR1), second minute (HRR2), third minute (HRR3), and fifth minute (HRR5) after terminating exercise stress testing. An independent sample t-test, Pearson correlation coefficient test, linear multivariate regression analysis, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were used for statistical assessment.
All HHR indices were found to be significantly decreased in patients with erectile dysfunction (p&lt;0.001). Effort capacity was markedly lower (9.1±2.3 vs. 10.4±2.3 METs, p=0.002) among patients with erectile dysfunction. HRR1 and HRR3 were found to be an independent risk factor for erectile dysfunction (Beta=0.462, p&lt;0.001; Beta=0.403, p&lt;0.001; respectively) in linear regression analysis.
Decreased HHR index may be considered as one of the independent predictors of impaired autonomic function in patients with erectile dysfunction.
Reduced heart rate recovery (HRR) after exercise is associated with increased mortality in cardiac and pulmonary diseases. We sought to evaluate the association between HRR after the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and outcomes in patients with connective tissue disease-associated pulmonary hypertension (CTD-PH). Data were obtained by review of the medical records. HRR was defined as the difference in heart rate at the end of the 6MWT and after 1 minute (HRR1), 2 minutes (HRR2), and 3 minutes (HRR3) of rest. All patients with pulmonary hypertension and a diagnosis of systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or mixed connective tissue disease who underwent the 6MWT between August 1, 2009, and October 30, 2011, were included (n = 66). By Kaplan-Meier analysis, HRR1, HRR2, and HRR3 at different cutoff points were all good predictors, with HRR1 of &lt;16 being the best predictor of time to clinical worsening (log-rank P &lt; 0.0001), hospitalization (log-rank P = 0.0001), and survival (log-rank P &lt; 0.003). By proportional hazards regression, patients with HRR1 of &lt;16 were at increased risk of clinical worsening (hazard ratio [HR]: 6.4 [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.6-19.2]; P &lt; 0.0001], hospitalization (HR: 6.6 [95% CI: 2.4-23]; P &lt; 0.0001), and death (HR: 4.5 [95% CI: 1.6-15.7]; P = 0.003). Patients in the highest tercile (HRR1 of ≥19) were unlikely to have a clinical worsening event (HR: 0.1 [95% CI: 0.04-0.5]; P = 0.001], to be hospitalized (HR: 0.1 [95% CI: 0.02-0.5]; P = 0.001), or to die (HR: 0.3 [95% CI: 0.07-0.9]; P = 0.04]. In conclusion, in patients with CTD-PH, abnormal HRR1 (defined as HRR1 of &lt;16) after the 6MWT is a strong predictor of clinical worsening, time to clinical worsening, survival, and hospitalization. 
Legislators and policymakers have expressed strong interest in intervention programs to reduce dependence on social disability benefits. Hybrid: ambulatory followed by home-based cardiac telerehabilitation--hybrid cardiac rehabilitation (HCR) seems to be a novel alternative for standard cardiac rehabilitation for patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) as a form of pension prevention paid by the Social Insurance Institution (SII). The kind of professional status may bias the motivation to return to work after HCR. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether the professional status can affect the effects of HCR.
One hundred fifty-two patients with CVD referred by the SII for a 5-week HCR were qualified for the study. Patients (87.7% males), aged 57.31 ± 5.61 years, were divided into 2 subgroups: W) white-collar employees (N = 22) and B) blue-collar employees (N = 130). To evaluate functional capacity, an exercise test on a treadmill was used.
The number of days of absence in the cardiac rehabilitation program did not differ between the groups (mean ± standard deviation--B: 1.09 ± 3.10 days, W: 1.95 ± 3.64 days). There were significant improvements (p &lt; 0.05) in measured variables after HCR in both (W and B) groups (max workload: 8.21 ± 2.88 METs (measured in metabolic equivalents) vs. 9.6 ± 2.49 METs, 7.76 ± 2.51 METs vs. 8.73 ± 2.7 METs, resting heart rate (RHR): 77 ± 16.22 bpm vs. 69.94 ± 12.93 bpm, 79.59 ± 14 bpm vs. 75.24 ± 11.87 bpm; double product, i.e., product of heart rate and systolic BP (DP rest) 10 815.22 ± 2968.24 vs. 9242.94 ± 1923.08, 10 927.62 ± 2508.47 vs. 9929.7 ± 2304.94). In group B, a decrease in systolic blood pressure (BP syst. - 137.03 ± 17.14 mm Hg vs. 131.82 ± 21.13 mm Hg), heart rate recovery in the 1st minute after the end of peak exercise (HRR1) (99.38 ± 19.25 vs. 93.9 ± 19.48) and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class (1.22 ± 0.53 vs. 1.11 ± 0.36) was observed. In group W, a decrease in diastolic blood pressure (BP diast.) at rest was observed (88.28 ± 9.79 mm Hg vs. 83.39 ± 8.95 mm Hg). The decrease in resting HR was significantly greater in group W (69.94 ± 12.93 vs. 75.24 ± 11.87, p = 0.034).
Hybrid cardiac rehabilitation is feasible and safe with high adherence to the program regardless of the patient's professional status. Professional status did not influence the beneficial effect of HCR on exercise tolerance.
There is compelling evidence that postexercise heart rate recovery (HRR) is a valid indicator of sympaticovagal balance. It is also used in prescription and monitoring of athletic training. The purpose of our study was to determine HRR after maximal exercise among elite athletes with respect to age. A total of 274 elite male Caucasian athletes were randomly selected from the larger sample and divided into two groups: adolescent (group Y) and adult athletes (≥18 years; group A). They performed maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing on a treadmill. Heart rate recovery was calculated as the rate of decline of HR from peak exercise to rates 1, 2 and 3 min after cessation of exercise (HRR1, HRR2 and HRR3). A significantly higher HRR1 was found in group A (29·5 ± 15·6 versus 22·4 ± 10·8, P&lt;0·001), but HRR3 was higher in group Y (82·7 ± 10·2 versus 79·9 ± 12·25; P = 0·04). Stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis showed that, among all subjects, the HRR1 alone was independently associated with age (P&lt;0·001). The maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) was in a negative relationship with HRR1 and in a positive one with HRR3 (P&lt;0·05) with respect to all athletes. The HRR during 3 min postexercise should be reported for the purpose of better assessing functional adaptation to exercise among elite athletes as well as the age-associated differences in recovery. Higher values of HRR1 should be expected in older athletes, and HRR3 could be used as an index of aerobic capacity, irrespective of age.
Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) has been shown to reduce the cardiovascular mortality of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and help people to return to professional work. Unfortunately, limited accessibility and low participation levels present persistent challenges in almost all countries where CR is available. Applying telerehabilitation provides an opportunity to improve the implementation of and adherence to CR, and it seems that the hybrid form of training may be the optimal approach due to its cost-effectiveness and feasibility for patients referred by a social insurance institution.
To present the clinical characteristics and evaluate the effects of hybrid: outpatient followed by home-based cardiac telerehabilitation in patients with CAD in terms of exercise tolerance, safety, and adherence to the programme.
A total of 125 patients (112 men, 13 women) with CAD, aged 58.3 ± 4.5 years, underwent a five-week training programme (TP) consisting of 19-22 exercise training sessions. The first stage of TP was performed in the ambulatory form of CR in hospital; then, patients continued to be telemonitored TP at home (hybrid model of cardiac rehabilitation - HCR). Before and after completing CR, all patients underwent a symptom-limited treadmill exercise stress test. Adherence was reported by the number of dropouts from the TP.
The number of days of absence in the HCR programme was 1.50 ± 4.07 days. There were significant improvements (p &lt; 0.05) in some measured variables after HCR in the exercise test: max. workload: 7.86 ± 2.59 METs vs. 8.88 ± 2.67 METs; heart rate (HR) at rest: 77.59 ± 12.53 bpm vs. 73.01 ± 11.57 bpm; systolic blood pressure at rest: 136.69 ± 17.19 mm Hg vs. 130.92 ± 18.95 mm Hg; double product at rest: 10623.33 ± 2262.97 vs. 9567.50 ± 2116.81; HRR1: 97.46 ± 18.27 bpm vs. 91.07 ± 19.19 bpm; and, NYHA class: 1.18 ± 0.48 vs. 1.12 ± 0.35.
In patients with documented CAD, HCR is feasible and safe, and adherence is good. Most patients were on social rehabilitation benefit, had a smoking history, and suffered from hypertension, obesity, or were overweight. A hybrid model of CR improved exercise tolerance.
The effectiveness of stationary and ambulatory cardiac rehabilitation of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes has been proven by some authors, but data concerning the effects of hybrid forms of cardiac rehabilitation (HCR) in this population are lacking. A home-based telerehabilitation is a promising form of secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases in this group of patients.
The objective of the study was to compare the effects of HCR in CAD patients with and without diabetes mellitus (DM). The secondary endpoint was the assessment of CAD risk factors like low exercise capacity and obesity, in both groups of patients.
This was a retrospective study, which comprised 125 patients with CAD aged 57.31 ± 5.61 years referred for HCR. They were assigned to Group D (with diabetes; n = 37) or Group C (without diabetes; n = 88). HCR was carried out as a comprehensive procedure that included all core components of cardiac rehabilitation according to guidelines. Before and after HCR all patients underwent a symptom-limited exercise test performed according to the Bruce protocol on a treadmill.
Before HCR the maximal workload was higher in Group C than in Group D (8.13 ± 2.82 METs vs. 6.77 ± 1.88 METs; p = 0.023), but after HCR the difference was not significant. In both groups an increase in the maximal workload after HCR was observed (Group D: before HCR 6.81 ± 1.91 METs, after HCR 8.30 ± 2.04 METs; p &lt; 0.001; Group C: before HCR 8.31 ± 2.71 METs, after HCR 9.13 ± 2.87 METs; p = 0.001). Resting heart rate, double product, and heart rate recovery 1 (HRR1) declined in both groups. No significant differences in changes in exercise test parameters between both groups' parameters were found.
HCR was effective in patients with DM. The adherence was high. Patients with DM had higher rates of obesity and significantly lower exercise tolerance than patients without DM. Patients from both groups gained similar benefit from HCR in terms of physical capacity, resting heart rate, and heart rate recovery.
This study examined the effect of various modes of exercise on parasympathetic reactivation in children.
Twelve healthy boys volunteered for this study. Time domain measurement of heart rate variability in 5 and 10 min and heart rate recovery (HRR) in 1 (HRR1) and 2 min (HRR2) were measured during recovery after incremental exercise tests by a 12-lead ECG. Incremental exercise tests were performed using either upper (arm cranking) or lower body (cycling) ergometers.
The amounts of increase in RMSSD and PNN50 in 5 and 10 min of recovery were higher in arm cranking compared to cycling. HRR1 and HRR2 were significantly higher after arm cranking compared to cycling.
These results suggest that parasympathetic reactivation is likely greater following exercises that use smaller muscle mass (arm cranking) rather than larger muscle mass (cycling) in healthy boys.
Insulin resistance (IR) and chronic inflammation are inversely related to heart rate recovery (HRR), a marker of cardiac autonomic function. Little is known, however, about the joint effects of IR and inflammation on HRR.
The study sample consisted of 2649 healthy individuals aged 12-49 years with measures of submaximal cardiopulmonary fitness testing from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2004. HRR 1-min (HRR1) and 2-min (HRR2) after recovery were recorded (bpm). IR was defined if homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) was ≥ 2.73. C-reactive protein (CRP) was quantified by latex-enhanced nephelometry.
In the fully adjusted model, participants with IR had attenuated HRR compared to those without (mean HRR1 11.8 vs. 12.7, p = 0.011; mean HRR2 31.2 vs. 33.4, p &lt; 0.001). Mean HRR1 for participants with CRP &gt;0.3 mg/dL, CRP 0.1-0.3 mg/dL, and CRP &lt;0.1 mg/dL were 11.6, 12.0, and 12.8 (p for trend 0.002), respectively. Mean HRR2 in the three corresponding groups were 33.0, 32.5, and 31.8 (p for trend 0.033), respectively. Participants with IR and CRP elevation had slower HRR than those without IR and with normal CRP. The mean HRR1 comparing participants with IR/CRP &gt;0.3 mg/dL to those with no IR/CRP &lt;0.1 mg/dL were 10.5 and 13.1 (p &lt; 0.001), while the mean HRR2 for the same comparison were 29.1 and 33.8 (p &lt; 0.001). HRR (especially HRR2) was inversely correlated with various metabolic risks.
Insulin resistance and CRP levels were inversely associated with HRR in healthy adolescents and adults. Participants with IR and elevated CRP had the worst HRR. Our findings suggest a joint effect of IR and inflammation on cardiac autonomic dysfunction.
The exercise heart rate (HR) profile and its relation to cardiac function and arrhythmias were investigated in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC). Chronotropic response (CR) and heart rate recovery (HRR) were computed during and after treadmill exercise testing in 273 patients with HC and 95 age-matched healthy controls. Patients with HC had higher prevalence of chronotropic incompetence and lower HRR1-5min compared with controls. Exercise capacity, diastolic function (assessed by E/e') and left atrial volume index were associated with HRR1min and CR in HC. Septal myectomy was associated with reduction in chronotropic incompetence but did not affect HRR1min. In conclusion, impaired CR and HRR1min are associated with advanced disease and do not appear to be independent clinical markers indicating high-risk status in HC. Improving CR by titrating doses of negative chronotropic agents, myectomy, and atrial pacing may be useful to increase exercise capacity in patients with HC. 
Poor sleep quality has an unfavorable impact on autonomic nervous system activity, especially that of the cardiovascular (CV) system. The heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) at rest and during exercise, along with the heart rate recovery (HRR), were examined in poor sleepers and compared with individuals with good sleep quality.
A total of 113 healthy individuals were enrolled to the study. All participants performed treadmill stress testing. Sleep quality of participants was assessed by using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire: 48 subjects were categorized as ‘poor sleepers’ (PSQI score &gt; 6 points), and the rest were grouped as ‘good sleepers’.
The poor sleepers showed higher resting HR (p &lt;0.001), higher diastolic BP (p=0.006), similar systolic BP (p=0.095), more frequent hypertensive response to exercise (p=0.046) and less HR increase with exercise (chronotropic incompetence) (p=0.002) compared with individuals who reported good sleep quality. In addition, the poor sleepers demonstrated reduced heart rate recovery at the 1st and 3rd minute of recovery (p=0.005 and 0.037, respectively) compared with good sleepers. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that only resting diastolic BP was the independent predictor of HRE. The PSQI score was positively correlated with resting HR; while it was negatively correlated with HR response to exercise, HRR1 and HRR index-1.
This cross-sectional study emphasizes the effect of poor sleep quality on unfavorable cardiovascular outcome indicators of the treadmill stress test.
It is unclear which exercise training protocol yields superior heart rate recovery (HRR) improvement in heart failure (HF) patients. Whether baseline HRR normality plays a role in the improvement is unknown. We hypothesized that an exercise training protocol and baseline HRR normality would be factors in altering HRR in HF patients.
In this prospective, randomized, controlled and 3 group parallel study, 41 stable HF patients were randomly assigned to 3-times-weekly training sessions for 12 weeks, consisting of i) 30 minutes of interval training (IT) (n=17, 63.7±8.8 years old) versus ii) 30 minutes of continuous training (CT) (n=13, 59.6±6.8 years old) versus iii) no training (CON) (n=11, 60.6±9.9 years old). Each patient had cardiopulmonary exercise testing before and after the training program. Maximum heart rates attained during the test and heart rates at 1 and 2 min (HRR1 and HRR2) during the recovery phase were recorded. Paired samples t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for comparisons before and after training. One-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis variance analysis was used for comparisons among groups.
HRR1 was unchanged after training. HRR2 improved in the IT group after training, and post-training HRR2 values were significantly faster in the IT group than in controls. Both HRR1 and HRR2 was significantly faster, irrespective of exercise protocol in patients with abnormal baseline values after training.
HRR1 did not improve after training. HRR2 improved only in the IT group. Both HRRs in patients with abnormal baseline values improved after both exercise protocols. IT might be superior to CT in improving HRR2. Baseline HRR might play a role in its response to exercise.
To assess exercise heart rate recovery (HRR) indices in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) for an assessment of their cardiac autonomic function.
Thirty-five patients with diffuse or limited SSc and 35 healthy controls were enrolled. All subjects underwent exercise testing and transthoracic echocardiography. The HRR indices were calculated by subtracting the first- (HRR1), second- (HRR2) and third-minute (HRR3) heart rates from the maximal heart rate.
The SSc and control groups were similar in age (45.2 ± 11.6 vs. 43.9 ± 10.0 years), had identical gender ratios (31 female/4 male in both groups) and similar left ventricular ejection fraction (66.5 ± 5.1 vs. 67.7 ± 5.9%). The mean HRR1 (21.8 ± 4.4 vs. 27.7 ± 4.3 bpm, p = 0.001), HRR2 (43.8 ± 6.3 vs. 47.6 ± 4.4 bpm, p = 0.004) and HRR3 (58.8 ± 10.3 vs. 63.6 ± 7.3 bpm, p = 0.031) values were significantly lower in the SSc group than in the healthy controls. HRR indices were similar in the limited and diffuse SSc subgroups.
The patients with SSc had lower HRR indices than normal subjects. Cardiac autonomic functions might be involved in SSc, even in patients without cardiac symptoms.
Vitamin D (VitD) deficiency affects the cardiovascular system via endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine pathways. Limited data are available regarding cardiac autonomic dysfunction in VitD deficiency. The aim of this study was to assess the cardiac autonomic functions by using heart rate recovery index (HRRI) and heart rate variability (HRV) in apparently healthy subjects with VitD deficiency.
A total of 24 VitD deficient and 50 age-, gender-, and body mass index-matched VitD sufficient healthy participants who admitted to outpatient clinics at a tertiary centre were enrolled. All study participants underwent Treadmill exercise test and 24-hour Holter recording to assess cardiac autonomic functions. HRRIs were calculated by subtracting first, second, and third minute heart rates during recovery period from maximal heart rate.
Mean HRR1 (28.0 ± 8.3 vs 42.8 ± 6.4, P &lt; 0.001), HRR2 (41.1 ± 11.2 vs 60.8 ± 10.4, P &lt; 0.001), and HRR3 (44.9 ± 13.3 vs 65.9 ± 9.8, P &lt; 0.001) were significantly higher in VitD sufficient group compared to VitD deficient group. HRV parameters as, SDNN (P = 0.040), SDANN (P &lt; 0.001), RMSSD (P &lt; 0.001), PNN50 (P &lt; 0.001), and HF (P &lt; 0.001) were significantly decreased in patients with VitD deficiency; but LF (P &lt; 0.001) and LF/HF (P = 0.003) were significantly higher in VitD deficient group. Serum 25(OH)D level was positively correlated with HRRIs (P &lt; 0.001), PNN50, RMSSD, SDANN, and HFnu; negatively correlated with LFnu and LF/HF (P &lt; 0.05). Also, multivariate linear regression analysis showed that serum 25(OH)D level was significantly associated with HRRIs and HRV parameters (P &lt; 0.001).
Our study results suggest that cardiac autonomic functions are impaired in patients with VitD deficiency despite the absence of overt cardiac involvement and symptoms. Further studies are needed to elucidate the prognostic significance and clinical implications of impaired autonomic functions in patients with VitD deficiency.
Sleep deprivation (SD) is known to be associated with increased incidence of adverse cardiovascular events, but underlying pathophysiological mechanism has not been clearly demonstrated. Autonomic nervous system plays an important role in the regulation of cardiovascular function, and impairment in this system is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of acute SD on autonomic regulation of cardiac function by determining heart rate recovery (HRR).
Twenty-one healthy security officers and nine nurses (mean age 33.25 ± 8.18) were evaluated. Treadmill exercise test was applied once after a night with regular sleep and once after a night shift in hospital. The HRR was calculated as the reduction in heart rate from peak exercise to the 30th second (HRR30), 1st minute (HRR1), 2nd minute (HRR2), 3rd minute (HRR3), and 5th minute (HRR5). The change in blood pressure (BP) measurements was also determined.
Exercise capacity of individuals with SD was significantly lower (10.96 ± 1.01 vs. 11.71 ± 1.30 metabolic equivalent task (MET)s; p = 0.002), and peak systolic BP was significantly higher (173.8 ± 16.3 vs. 166.2 ± 9.9; p = 0.019). There was a signicant difference in HRR30 (12.74 ± 6.19 vs. 17.66 ± 5.46; p = 0.003) and HRR1 (31 ± 6.49 vs. 36.10 ± 7.78; p = 0.004). The ratio of these indices to peak HR was also significantly lower with SD (HRR%30 8.04 ± 4.26 vs. 10.19 ± 3.21; p = 0.025 and HRR%1: 18.66 ± 4.43 vs. 20.98 ± 4.72; p = 0.013). The difference in other indices of HRR was not significant.
Our findings suggest that SD blunts cardiovascular autonomic response, and consequences of this relation might be more pronounced in subjects who are exposed to sleeplessness regularly or in subjects with baseline cardiovascular disease.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been considered as a benign disease often associated with central obesity and insulin resistance and, in general, with factors of the metabolic syndrome. Heart rate recovery after exercise is a function of vagal reactivation, and its impairment is an independent prognostic indicator for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. The aim of our study was to evaluate the heart rate recovery index in patients with NAFLD.
The study population included 59 patients with NAFLD (mean age=42.3±9.3 years) and 22 healthy subjects as controls (mean age=40.7±6.5 years). Basal electrocardiography, echocardiography, and treadmill exercise testing were performed on all patients and controls. The heart rate recovery index was defined as the reduction in the heart rate from the rate at peak exercise to the rate at the 1st minute (HRR1), 2nd minute (HRR2), 3rd minute (HRR3), and 5th minute (HRR5) after stopping exercise stress testing.
There were significant differences in HRR1 and HRR2 indices between patients with ED and the control group (19.9±8.2 vs. 34.1±9.6; p&lt;0.001 and 24.3±5.4 vs. 40.5±9.1; p=0.006, respectively). Similarly, HRR indices after the 3rd and 5th minutes of the recovery period were significantly lower in patients with NAFLD compared with those indices in the control group (32.3±8.5 vs. 58.4±6.5; p=0.001 and 58±18.2 vs. 75.1±15.8; p&lt;0.001). Effort capacity was markedly lower (11±1.9 vs. 12.5±1.5 METs; p=0.001) among the patients with NAFLD.
The heart rate recovery index is deteriorated in patients with NAFLD. When the prognostic significance of the heart rate recovery index is considered, these results may help explain the increased occurrence of cardiac death. It points to the importance of the heart rate recovery index in the identification of high-risk patients.
Both interval (IT) and continuous (CT) exercise training results in an improvement of aerobic capacity in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); however, their effects on cardiac autonomic function remains unclear. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of a supervised CT vs IT on autonomic cardiac function in COPD patients.
COPD patients were divided into two different groups according to training modality (IT or CT). Autonomic cardiac dysfunction (ACD) was defined as a heart rate recovery lower than 12 bpm heart rate after the first minute of maximal exercise (HRR1 ) and an abnormal chronotropic response (CR) to exercise (&lt;80%).
A total of 29 patients {mean [standard deviation (SD)] age: 68 (8) years, %FEV1 : 42 (13) predicted} were trained (15 subjects in the CT group, 14 subjects in the IT group). After training, both groups increased peak oxygen consumption [mean difference ΔVO2 peak: 156 mL/min (P = 0.04) on IT; and 210 mL/min (P = 0.01) on CT], HRR1 [IT, from 10.4 (5) to 13.8 (5) bpm (P = 0.04); and CT, from 14.3 (5) to 17.7 (5) bpm (P = 0.04)] and CR [IT, from 57% (22) to 81% (9) (P = 0.001); and CT, from 48% (28) to 73% (17) (P = 0.001)]. Sixteen patients showed ACD. Among these patients, HRR1 (P = 0.01 for IT and P = 0.04 for CT) and CR (P = 0.001 for IT and P = 0.002 for CT) were enhanced after training.
Both IT and CT exercise training improve heart rate recovery and CR in COPD patients. These benefits could help to individualize exercise training.
We investigated whether post-exercise first minute abnormal heart rate recovery (HRR1) helps to predict the presence and severity of CAD, because of some confounding data.
A cross-sectional, retrospective study was performed. Two hundred individuals were included. Gensini scores and the number of coronary artery involvements were used to evaluate the severity of CAD. Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test and chi-square test were used for the analysis continuous and categorical data. Spearman's correlation analysis was used to determine whether there is correlation between Gensini scoring and HRR1. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to determine predictors for abnormal HRR1. ROC curve analysis was performed to detect the best sensitivity and specificity value of HRR1 in predicting CAD presence.
Seventy subjects (35%) did not have CAD, and CAD was present in 130 patients (65%). HRR1 ≤21 beats with ROC analysis was determined to be the best cut off point. After adjustment between the two groups in terms of age, gender, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia or smoking (all p&gt;0.05), there was relationship CAD presence and abnormal HRR1 (OR=2.1, 95% CI: 1.1-3.9, p=0.02), but not between CAD severity and HRR1 (r=-0.13, p=0.112). The sensitivity, specificity, and the positive and negative predictive values of abnormal HRR1 ≤21 beats at first minute for predicting CAD presence were 76.1%, 41.3% (AUC=0.588, CI 95%: 0.517-0,657, p=0.039), 70.7% and 48.3%, respectively.
In the study abnormal HRR1 predicted the presence of CAD, but not the severity of it.
Heart rate recovery at one minute of rest (HRR1) is a predictor of mortality in heart failure (HF), but its prognosis has not been assessed at six-minute walk test (6MWT) in these patients.
This study aimed to determine the HRR1 at 6MWT in patients with HF and its correlation with six-minute walk distance (6MWD).
Cross-sectional, controlled protocol with 161 individuals, 126 patients with stable systolic HF, allocated into 2 groups (G1 and G2) receiving or not β-blocker and 35 volunteers in control group (G3) had HRR1 recorded at the 6MWT.
HRR1 and 6MWD were significantly different in the 3 groups. Mean values of HRR1 and 6MWD were: HRR1 = 12 ± 14 beat/min G1; 18 ± 16 beat/min G2 and 21 ± 13 beat/min G3; 6MWD = 423 ± 102 m G1; 396 ± 101 m G2 and 484 ± 96 m G3 (p &lt; 0.05). Results showed a correlation between HRR1 and 6MWD in G1(r = 0.3; p = 0.04) and in G3(r = 0.4; p= 0.03), but not in G2 (r= 0.12; p= 0.48).
HRR1 response was attenuated in patients using βB and showed correlation with 6MWD, reflecting better exercise tolerance. HRR1 after 6MWT seems to represent an alternative when treadmill tests could not be tolerated.
Abnormalities of autonomic function have been reported in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The effect of the exercise training in heart rate recovery (HRR) has not been established in patients with COPD.
To assess the effects of 8-weeks' endurance training program on parasympathetic nervous system response measured as heart rate recovery in a sample of moderate-to-severe COPD patients.
We recruited a consecutive sample of patients with COPD candidates to participate in a pulmonary rehabilitation program from respiratory outpatient clinics of a tertiary hospital. HRR was calculated, before and after training, as the difference in heart rate between end-exercise and one minute thereafter (HRR1) in a constant-work rate protocol.
A total of 73 COPD patients were included: mean (SD) age 66 (8) years, median (P25-P75) post-bronchodilator FEV1 39 (29-53)%. The prevalence of slow HRR1 (≤12 beats) at baseline was 63%, and was associated with spirometric severity (mean FEV1 35% in slow HRR1 vs 53 in normal HRR1, p &lt; 0.001). After 8-weeks training, HRR1 improved from mean (SD) 10 (7) to 12 (7) beats (p = 0.0127). Multivariate linear regression models showed that the only variable related to post-training HRR1 was pre-training HRR1 (p &lt; 0.001).
These results suggest that training enhances HRR in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. HRR is an easy tool to evaluate ANS such that it may be a useful clinical marker of parasympathetic nervous system response in patients with COPD.
Central nervous system dysfunction is associated with mortality and morbidity in patients with cardiovascular disease, post-workout recovery and faster heart rate being mediated by the dynamic interaction between the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), as components of the autonomic nervous system. Heart rate recovery is the decline in heart rate after exercise. The aim of the study was to determine the influence of certain clinical and paraclinical parameters on heart rate recovery after exercise in patients with ischemic heart disease.
The study included 260 patients who were subjected to cardiovascular stress test. The following parameters were measured in each patient: blood pressure and pulse rate prior to exercise, during exercise and at protocol-established time intervals, as well as 1 and 3 minutes after the end of the stress test. Statistical analysis was performed using MedCalc software version 14.8.1.
Elderly patients had slower heart rate recovery at 1 minute after effort. Female patients have recovered significantly better the heart rate, at 1 minute and 3 minutes after effort compared to the males. This difference was maintained in multivariate analysis, independent of age or comorbidities of patients. The presence of ischemic heart disease was the most important factor independently associated with HRR1. Triglyceride values were negatively correlated with both HRR3 and HRR1 and independent of other factors present in the multivariate analysis.
Autonomic dysfunction is involved in the development of cardiovascular risk factors like hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia and was directly correlated with morbidity and mortality caused by coronary heart disease.
Regular exercise training has been shown to reduce mortality, improve functional capacity; and control the risk factors in myocardial infarction (MI) patients. Heart rate recovery (HRR) is a strong independent mortality predictor in patients with previous MI.
The main objective of this study was to investigate the impact of exercise training on heart rate recovery in patients post anterior myocardial infarction.
We recruited patients one month after having anterior MI who were referred to cardiac rehabilitation (CR) clinic in Ain Shams University hospital between October 2016 and July 2017. All the patients participated in exercise training sessions 3 times a week for 12 weeks. Symptom limited treadmill exercise test was done before and after exercise training program to calculate heart rate recovery in 1st minute (HRR1) and 2nd minute (HRR2).
A total of 50 patients, including 44 (88%) males, completed the exercise training program. The mean age was 51 years. Statistically significant improvement in HRR1 and HRR2 was observed (p value &lt;0.001) after completion of exercise based cardiac rehabilitation program. Significant improvement in resting heart rate was also observed (p value &lt;0.001). Moreover, metabolic equivalent (METs) and HR reserve were improved significantly (p value &lt;0.001). No statistically significant changes were observed in resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures and maximum HR (p value = 0.95, 0.76 and 0.31 respectively).
Exercise training improves HRR, resting HR, METs and HR reserve in post anterior MI patients.
The 6-min walk test (6MWT) is commonly performed to assess functional status in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. However, changes in heart rate and oxygen saturation (SpO2 ) patterns during 6MWT in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension remain unclear.
Thirty-one subjects with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension were retrospectively evaluated to examine the relationships between the change in heart rate (Δheart rate), heart rate acceleration time, slope of heart rate acceleration, heart rate recovery during the first minute after 6MWT (HRR1), change in SpO2 (ΔSpO2 ), SpO2 reduction time, and SpO2 recovery time during 6MWT, and the severity of pulmonary hemodynamics assessed by right heart catheterization and echocardiography.
Subjects with severe chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension had significantly longer heart rate acceleration time (144.9 ± 63.9 s vs 96.0 ± 42.5 s, P = .033), lower Δheart rate (47.4 ± 16.9 vs 61.8 ± 13.6 beats, P = .02), and lower HRR1 (13.3 ± 9.0 beats vs 27.1 ± 9.2 beats, P &lt; .001) compared to subjects with mild chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Subjects with severe chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension also had significantly longer SpO2 reduction time (178.3 ± 70.3 s vs 134.3 ± 58.4 s, P = .03) and SpO2 recovery time (107.6 ± 35.3 s vs 69.8 ± 32.7 s, P = .004) than did subjects with mild chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed only mean pulmonary arterial pressure independently was associated with heart rate acceleration time and slope of heart rate acceleration.
Heart rate and SpO2 change patterns during 6MWT are predominantly associated with pulmonary hemodynamics in subjects with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Evaluating heart rate and SpO2 change patterns during 6MWT may serve as a safe and convenient way to follow the change in pulmonary hemodynamics.
Erectile dysfunction (ED) and cardiovascular (CV) diseases share common risk factors and ED has been accepted as an early manifestation of CV disease. Exercise stress testing (EST) is used to evaluate CV functions in men with ED. Low exercise workload, a slower heart rate recovery (HRR) after exercise, and inability to increase heart rate during EST (chronotropic incompetence) are independent negative predictors of adverse CV outcomes.
To assess the association among EST parameters, ED, and testosterone levels.
The study population consisted of 41 patients with ED and 40 controls. All participants underwent treadmill EST to assess cardiac autonomic functions. HRR indices were calculated by subtracting 1st (HRR1), 2nd (HRR2), and 3rd (HRR3) minute heart rates during the recovery period from maximal heart rate. Total exercise duration, exercise capacity and chronotropic response, and plasma testosterone levels were evaluated. Erectile functions were evaluated with the Sexual Health Inventory for Men. Patients were divided into subgroups according to severity and duration of ED.
Mean HRR1 (30.6 ± 11.9 vs 36.9 ± 9.9; P = .01), HRR2 (44.9 ± 12.4 vs 54.9 ± 7.8; P &lt; .001), and HRR3 (50.1 ± 11.7 vs 63.0 ± 7.9; P &lt; .001) were significantly lower in the ED than in the control group. Total exercise duration (9.4 ± 1.9 vs 10.9 ± 1.7 minutes; P &lt; .001), exercise capacity (12.5 ± 1.9 vs 13.6 ± 1.4 metabolic equivalents; P = .004), and chronotropic response (0.88 ± 0.1 vs 1.0 ± 0.1; P &lt; .001) were worse in the ED group. However, we found no association between severity and duration of ED and EST parameters. In addition, serum testosterone levels were significantly correlated with HRR1 (r = 0.36, P = .02) in men with ED.
Our data suggested that cardiac autonomic functions are impaired in patients with ED. A weak correlation between cardiac autonomic dysfunction and low testosterone levels in patients with ED was noted. However, further studies are needed to elucidate the prognostic significance and clinical implications of impaired autonomic functions and testosterone replacement therapy in patients with ED.

An efficient cardiac rehabilitation programme (CRP) can improve the functional ability of patients after acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
To examine the effect of a CRP on parasympathetic reactivation and heart rate recovery (HRR) measured after a 6-min walk test (6MWT), and correlation with 6MWT distance and well-being after ACS.
Eleven normoweight patients after ACS (BMI&lt;25kg/m2; 10 males; mean [SD] age 61 [9] years) underwent an 8-week CRP. Before (pre-) and at weeks 4 (W4) and 8 (W8) during the CRP, they performed a 6MWT on a treadmill, followed by 10-min of seated passive recovery, with HRR and HR variability (HRV) recordings. HRR was measured at 1, 3, 5 and 10min after the 6MWT (HRR1, HRR3, HRR5, HRR10), then modelized by a mono-exponential function. Time-domain (square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of differences between adjacent normal R-R intervals [RMSSD]) and frequency-domain (with high- and low-frequency band powers) were used to analyse HRV. Participants completed a mental and physical well-being questionnaire at pre- and W8. Exhaustion after tests was assessed by the Borg scale. Pearson correlation was used to assess correlations.
HRR3, HRR5 and HRR10 increased by 37%, 36% and 28%, respectively, between pre- and W8 (P&lt;0.05), and were positively correlated with change in 6MWT distance (r=0.58, 0.66 and 0.76; P&lt;0.05). Percentage change in HRR3 was positively correlated with change in well-being (r=0.70; P=0.01). Parasympathic reactivation (RMSSD) was improved only during the first 30sec of recovery (P=0.04).
Among patients undergoing a CRP after ACS, increased HRR after a 6MWT, especially at 3min, was positively correlated with 6MWT distance and improved well-being. HRR raw data seem more sensitive than post-exercise HRV analysis for monitoring functional and autonomic improvement after ACS.
A large body of evidence exists indicating that autonomic imbalance is characteristic of heart failure, with several parameters of autonomic function associated with adverse clinical outcomes. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the effects of exercise training on parameters of autonomic function in patients with heart failure and where possible quantify the size of the effect. We conducted database searches (PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Trials Register to 31 March 2017) for exercise-based rehabilitation trials in heart failure; using search terms, exercise training, autonomic function, heart rate recovery, heart rate variability and muscle sympathetic nerve activity. Pooled data indicated a statistically significant increase in heart rate recovery at 1 min (HRR1) in exercise compared to control groups, mean difference 5.90 bpm (95%CI 5.12, 6.69; p &lt; 0.00001). Pooled data also indicated that exercise training improved the short-term heart rate variability (HRV) parameters of root mean square of successive differences between normal heart beats (RMSSD (ms)) [mean difference 10.44 (95%CI 0.60, 20.28, p = 0.04)] and high-frequency normalised units (HFnu) [mean difference 7.72 (95%CI 3.32, 12.12, p = 0.0006), which are predominantly reflective of parasympathetic activity. Analyses also indicated a statistically significant decrease in muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) bursts/minute (mean difference - 11.09 (95%CI - 16.18, - 6.00; p &lt; 0.0001) and MSNA bursts/100 heart beats (mean difference - 15.44 (95%CI - 20.95, -9.92; p &lt; 0.00001) in exercise groups compared to controls. With improvements in HRR, HRV and MSNA, exercise training appears to facilitate an improvement in parasympathetic tone and reduction in sympathetic activity.
Objective Although carotid artery stenting (CAS) is an effective treatment for severe carotid stenosis, it has been associated with alterations in autonomic functions long term after the procedure. Patients with CAS have been reported to have autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction. This study aimed to evaluate heart rate recovery (HRR) indices and exercise test parameters after CAS. Methods Patients (10 male, 11 female) suitable for CAS, without a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, severe coronary artery or valvular heart disease, were enrolled in our study. Basal electrocardiography, echocardiography, and treadmill exercise testing were performed in all patients pre- and post-procedure. The HRR index was defined as the reduction in the heart rate from the rate at peak exercise to the rate first minute (HRR1), second minute (HRR2), third minute (HRR3) and fifth minute (HRR5) after the cessation of exercise stress testing. Results The exercise time, maximal heart rate, maximal blood pressure and maximal metabolic equivalents values were significantly decreased after the procedure. The first- and second-minute HRR indices of patients before procedure were significantly lower than after procedure (23.5 ± 6.6 vs 25.8 ± 8.3; p &lt; 0.001 and 41.8 ± 12.3 vs 50.2 ± 16.3; p &lt; 0.001, respectively). Similarly, HRR indices after the third and fifth minutes of the recovery period were significantly lower in patients before procedure, when compared with those indices after procedure (52.9 ± 13.1 vs 60.7 ± 14.4; p &lt; 0.001 and 62.4 ± 12.8 vs 71.9 ± 14.1; p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion We have demonstrated that HRR indices increased in the first, second, third and fifth minutes of the recovery period after maximal exercise testing in patients after the CAS procedure, which may be a reflection of parasympathetic dominance after CAS.
Objective Sinus tachycardia is frequently reported in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), while there are limited data on post-exercise ability to slow heart rate (i.e. heart rate recovery, HRR) in this group of patients. Methods We studied consecutive 70 patients with SLE and 30 healthy controls. All examined individuals underwent detailed clinical examination, echocardiography, Holter monitoring with heart rate variability and treadmill stress test using Bruce's protocol. HRR values were calculated as the difference between maximum HR during exercise and HR at the first (HRR1) and third (HRR3) minute of rest. Individuals with coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus and suspected pulmonary hypertension were excluded from further analysis ( n = 15). Results Fifty-five SLE patients were eligible for this study: aged 41.5 ± 12.4 years, 87.3% women, SLICC/ACR-DI score 3.58 ± 1.85. In the SLE group 36.4% patients received beta-blockers, usually for previously detected sinus tachycardia and/or arterial hypertension. Mean HRR1 (36.9 ± 12.6 vs 49.5 ± 18.6, p = 0.0004) and HRR3 (55.5 ± 14.3 vs 69.2 ± 16.4, p = 0.0001) were significantly lower in SLE than in healthy individuals. Significantly negative correlations between SLICC/ACR-DI score and HRR1 ( r = -0.299, p = 0.01), HRR3 ( r = -0.361, p = 0.001) and exercise capacity ( r = -0.422, p &lt; 0.0001) were revealed. Additionally, beta-blocker treatment was also revealed to alter significantly HRR1, HRR3 and exercise capacity in SLE. Conclusion Patients with SLE are characterized by attenuated HRR after exercise. In our study impaired HRR was associated with disease severity and beta-blocker treatment and probably with disease duration. The use of HRR assessment in SLE can be used as an additional marker of cardiac autonomic nervous system dysfunction.
To determine if in-season changes in heart rate recovery (HRR) are related to aerobic fitness and performance in collegiate rowers. Twenty-two female collegiate rowers completed testing before and after their competitive season. Body fat percentage (BF%) was determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max ) and time to exhaustion (Tmax ) were determined during maximal rowing ergometer testing followed by 1 minute of recovery. HRR was expressed absolutely and as a percentage of maximal HR (HRR%1 min ). Variables were compared using paired Wilcoxon tests. Multivariable regression models were used to predict in-season changes in HRR using changes in VO2max and Tmax , while accounting for changes in BF%. From preseason to post-season, VO2max and BF% decreased (3.98±0.42 vs 3.78±0.35 L/min, P=.002 and 23.8±3.4 vs 21.3±3.9%, P&lt;.001, respectively), while Tmax increased (11.7±1.3 vs 12.6±1.3 min, P=.002), and HRR%1 min increased (11.1±2.7 vs 13.8±3.8, P=.001). In-season changes in VO2max were not associated with HRR%1 min (P&gt;.05). In-season changes in Tmax were related to changes in HRR%1 min (β=-1.67, P=.006). In-season changes in BF% were not related to changes in HRR (P&gt;.05 for all). HRR1 min and HRR%1 min were faster preseason to post-season, although the changes were unrelated to VO2max . Faster HRR%1 min post-season was inversely related to changes in Tmax . This suggests that HRR should not be used as a measure of aerobic capacity in collegiate rowers, but is a promising measure of training status in this population.
Abnormalities of autonomic function have been reported in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Our objectives were to identify determinants of abnormal heart rate recovery at 1 min (HRR1) following completion of the 6-min walk test (6MWT) in COPD and to establish whether abnormal HRR1 predicts acute exacerbations (AECOPD).
Hundred one COPD patients (FEV1 (SD) 53 (19)  % predicted) were prospectively recruited in a multi-center study. HRR1 after the 6MWT was evaluated as the difference between heart rate at the end of the test and 1 min into the recovery (HRR1). Linear and logistic regression was used to identify predictors of HRR1 and AECOPD, respectively. The best HRR1 cut-off point to predict AECOPD was selected using the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. The follow-up period was 12 months.
Distance covered during the 6MWT (m) and DLco (% predicted) were independently associated with HRR1 (r 2 = 0.51, p = 0.001). Among several potential covariates, HRR1 emerged as the most significant predictor of AECOPD (Odds ratio [OR], 0.91 per beat of recovery; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-0.97; p = 0.02). The ROC analysis indicated that subjects with HRR1 less than 14 beats (AUC, 0.71 [CI] 0.60-0.80; p = 0.0001) were more likely to suffer an exacerbation during the follow-up period (for HRR1, p = 0.004 [log-rank test]).
HRR1 after the 6MWT is an independent predictor factor for AECOPD. Further studies are warranted to examine the physiological mechanisms associating a delayed HRR and acute exacerbations in COPD patients.
The study was designed to observe the effects and relationship of exercise on chronotropic response (CR) and exercise capacity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A total of 30 patients with T2DM underwent symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) after excluding contraindication. For each subject individualized exercise prescription was formulated, and they received 12 weeks of exercise training after CPET retest to complete the comparison of CR indicators, including the ratio of maximum exercise heart rate to predicted maximum heart rate value (rHR), heart rate reserve rate (HRRes), heart rate recovery (HRR) of 1-6 min after exercise termination (HRR1-6), exercise capacity (peak VO2/kg) and other indicators. The results showed that after 12 weeks of exercise treatment, rHR, HRRes, HRR1-6, and peak VO2/kg were significantly higher than before (P&lt;0.05), with peak VO2/kg being positively correlated to rHR and HRRes (P&lt;0.01). In conclusion, exercise training can improve cardiac dysfunction, abnormal HRR, enhance exercise capacity and adaptability of the cardiovascular system to exercise stress in T2DM patients.
This study aims to investigate if cardiac involvement may occur in children with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) without cardiovascular symptoms by using heart rate recovery (HRR) and systolic blood pressure recovery (SBPR) parameters.
A total of 50 FMF patients (26 males, 24 females; mean age 151±33.4 month; range 60 to 216 month) and 30 healthy controls (18 males, 12 females; mean age 143±43.9 month; range 84 to 228 month) were included in the study. All patients were evaluated by echocardiography. All patients underwent a maximal graded exercise stress test. HRR and SBPR parameters were calculated.
There was a significant decrease in HRR1 value in FMF group (p=0.03). SBPR1 and SPBR2 values were higher in FMF group compared to control group (0.96±0.12 vs 0.88±0.12 and 0.95±0.09 vs 0.91±0.11, respectively); and the high SBPR1 value was statistically significant (p=0.02). FMF presence had a negative correlation with HRR1 (r= -0.26, p=0.03) and a positive correlation with SBPR1 (r=0.29, p=0.02). There was a negative correlation of M694V homozygous mutation with HRR1 and HRR2 values (r= -0.43, p=0.004, r=-0.42, p=0.005).
Cardiac involvement may occur in FMF patients without cardiovascular symptoms. Impaired SBPR and decreased HRR response may indicate increased cardiovascular risk in these patients despite normal exercise stress test results.
The purpose of this study was to examine the association of free-living, objectively-measured physical activity on treadmill-based heart rate recovery (HRR), a parameter known to associate with morbidity and mortality. Data was used from 2003 to 2004 NHANES. Physical activity was assessed via accelerometry, with HRR recovery assessed from a treadmill-based test. Heart rate recovery minute 1 (HRR1) and minute 2 (HRR2) were calculated. After adjustment, light and vigorous-intensity free-living physical activity, respectively, were associated with HRR1 (βadjusted = 0.69, 95% CI 0.22-1.14; βadjusted 1.94, 95% CI 0.01-3.9) and HRR2 (βadjusted = 0.99, 95% CI 0.35-1.62; βadjusted = 5.88, 95% CI 2.63-9.12). Moderate physical activity was not associated with HRR1 (βadjusted = 0.60, 95% CI -0.41 to 1.62), but was with HRR2 (βadjusted = 2.28, 95% CI 1.27-3.28). As free-living physical activity intensity increased, there was a greater association with HRR. This finding may provide mechanistic insight of previous research observations demonstrating intensity-specific effects of physical activity on various health outcomes.
We show by this study that a decrease in HRR1 in IPAH patients is associated with severe limitation of exercise capacity. HRR1 &lt; 16 beats and CI just after completion of a CPET could be an indicator of poor prognosis.
Arsenic exposure is associated with various cardiovascular diseases. The aim of the present study was to assess cardiac autonomic function via heart rate response to exercise and recovery period of treadmill testing in arsenic-exposed workers.
Sixty-five (65) occupationally arsenic-exposed workers and 35 healthy controls were enrolled. Blood and urinary arsenic levels were analyzed and symptom limited maximal treadmill exercise test were performed. Chronotropic response to exercise including age-predicted maximal heart rate (APMHR), heart rate reserve (HRreserve ), age-predicted HRreserve (APHRreserve ) and adjusted HRreserve and 1st-, 2nd-and 3rd-min heart rate recovery (HRR) indices were calculated.
Baseline clinical and echocardiographic parameters, exercise test duration, resting and maximal heart rate, peak exercise capacity, HRreserve , APMHR, APHRreserve , and adjusted HRreserve were found to be similar between groups. HRR1 (22.0 ± 4.3 vs. 24.3 ± 3.1 bpm, p = .003) and HRR2 (43.2 ± 6.2 vs. 46.7 ± 6.4 bpm, p = .012) were significantly lower in arsenic-exposed workers compared to controls. Blood and urinary arsenic levels negatively correlated with HRR1 (r = -.477, p &lt; .001 and r = -.438, p &lt; .001, respectively) and HRR2 (r = -.507, p &lt; .001 and r = -.412, p &lt; .001 respectively).
Arsenic-exposed workers had lower HRR indices than normal subjects but chronotropic response were similar. Cardiac autonomic dysregulation may be one of the cardiovascular consequences of arsenic exposure.
Eisenmenger syndrome (ES) precipitates the extreme manifestation of pulmonary hypertension, which leads to severe functional limitation and poor quality of life. The propose of the current study was: 1) examined the acute effects of 40% oxygen supplementation during the 6-minute walk test (6MWT); and 2) evaluate the relation between exercise capacity and clinical cardiac parameters in patients with ES.
Thirty subjects were prospectively included; all were submitted to a 6MWT with compressed air and with 40% of oxygen. Heart rate recovery at the first minute (HRR1) and perceived effort Borg scale for dyspnea and lower limb fatigue were recorded in both tests scenarios.
The 6MWT distance was modestly, negatively associated with pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) [r=0.46, p=0.02]. Patients improved 6MWT distance (p&lt;0.001) and exhibited a faster HRR1 (p&lt;0.001) with 40% supplemental oxygen compared to compressed air. With 40% supplemental oxygen, subjects revealed lower dyspnea and lower limb fatigue compared to 6MWT without oxygen supplementation (p&lt;0.001). The amount of change in the 6MWT distance from air to oxygen was moderate, positively associated with tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and right ventricular fractional area change (RVFAC) [r=0.50, p=0.03; r=0.64, p&lt;0.001, respectively].
Acute 40% oxygen supplementation in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome led to an improvement in 6MWT distance, faster HRR1 and lower dyspnea and lower limb fatigue perception. Moreover, functional capacity was positively associated with right ventricular parameters.
Data on aerobic fitness and heart rate recovery in children are limited. This study was done to evaluate the relation between them in Indian school going children. Three hundred children of 7 to 10.5 years were recruited and their aerobic fitness was predicted using modified Harvard's step test (VO₂max) and 20 meter shuttle test (VO₂peak). The heart rate was monitored for 12 minutes post modified Harvard's step test. The difference between the maximum and the 1st minute HR was noted as HRR1 and the time taken to reach the resting heart rate was also recorded. VO₂max was inversely correlated with HRR1 (r = -0.64, p&lt;0.001). However, the partial correlation of the two was not significant (r(partial) = -0.037, p = 0.55), indicating children with higher basal HR had higher HRR1 and that accounted for the observed association with aerobic fitness. Cox regression analysis showed that the recovery rate per unit time was 3% greater with increasing VO₂max (HR = 1.03, 95% CI:1.01 to 1.05, p = 0.013). The heart rate parameters did not show any associat with VO₂peak This study demonstrates that there is no relation between VO₂max and HRR1 after 3 minutes of modified Harvard's step test in Indian children of 7 to 10.5 years. However, aerobic fitness is a positive predictor of heart rate recovery time in this group.
The aim of the present study was to assess cardiac autonomic function via indices of exercise heart rate recovery (HRR) in workers occupationally exposed to lead.
A total of 98 lead-exposed workers and 98 healthy controls were enrolled. All underwent exercise testing and transthoracic echocardiography. HRR indices were calculated by subtracting 1st- (HRR1), 2nd- (HRR2), and 3rd-minute (HRR3) heart rates from maximal heart rate (HR). Exercise test parameters- HRR in particular- were compared between groups, and correlation analysis of blood, 24-hour urine lead levels, and test parameters was performed.
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were found to be similar between groups. Mean HRR1 (26.2±3.6 vs 29.0±4.1 bpm, p&lt;0.001), HRR2 (42.6±3.9 vs 46.9±3.7 bpm, p&lt;0.001), and HRR3 (56.6±4.5 vs 61.8±4.3 bpm, p&lt;0.001) values were significantly lower in the lead-exposed group than in the healthy controls. HRR1 was found to be significantly correlated with blood (r:-0.415; p&lt;0.001) and 24-hour urine lead levels (r:-0.446; p&lt;0.001). HRR2 and HRR3 were significantly correlated with 24-hour urine lead level (r:-0.396; p&lt;0.001 and r:-0.233; p=0.021, respectively).
Lead-exposed workers had lower HRR indices than normal subjects. Blood and 24-hour urine lead levels were significantly associated with HRR indices. Cardiac autonomic functions may be affected by exposure to lead, and those occupationally exposed should be closely followed for adverse cardiovascular outcome.
