The present study was performed to determine the prognostic significance of miRNA-200c and miRNA-141, and their association with EMT markers ZEB1, ZEB2 and E-cadherin in eyelid sebaceous gland carcinoma (SGC).
Expression levels of miRNA-200c and miRNA-141 were determined in 42 eyelid SGC cases by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Their association with ZEB1, ZEB2 and E-cadherin was determined by qPCR and immunohistochemistry. Kaplan-Meier plots and Spearman's rank correlation tests were applied to analyse the data. Patients were followed up for 7-44 months.
Low expression levels of miRNA-200c and miRNA-141 were seen in 36/42 (86%) and 28/42 (67%) cases, respectively. Low miRNA-200c correlated significantly with large tumour size (p=0.03) and poor differentiation (p=0.03). Low miRNA-141 correlated significantly with large tumour size (p=0.02) and lymph node metastasis (p=0.04). Survival analysis revealed that patients with low miRNA-200c (p&lt;0.05) and miRNA-141 expression (p=0.07) had shorter disease-free survival. There was a significant association of both miRNA-200c and miRNA-141 with E-cadherin and ZEB2 expression.
Low levels of miRNA-200c and miRNA-141 in patients with eyelid SGC facilitates tumour progression by promoting EMT and miRNA-200c has emerged as a novel potential predictor of survival.
Satsuma myomphala is critically endangered through loss of natural habitats, predation by natural enemies, and indiscriminate collection. It is a protected species in Korea but lacks genomic resources for an understanding of varied functional processes attributable to evolutionary success under natural habitats. For assessing the genetic information of S. myomphala, we performed for the first time, de novo transcriptome sequencing and functional annotation of expressed sequences using Illumina Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform and bioinformatics analysis. We identified 103,774 unigenes of which 37,959, 12,890, and 17,699 were annotated in the PANM (Protostome DB), Unigene, and COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups) databases, respectively. In addition, 14,451 unigenes were predicted under Gene Ontology functional categories, with 4581 assigned to a single category. Furthermore, 3369 sequences with 646 having Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers were mapped to 122 pathways in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Pathway database. The prominent protein domains included the Zinc finger (C2H2-like), Reverse Transcriptase, Thioredoxin-like fold, and RNA recognition motif domain. Many unigenes with homology to immunity, defense, and reproduction-related genes were screened in the transcriptome. We also detected 3120 putative simple sequence repeats (SSRs) encompassing dinucleotide to hexanucleotide repeat motifs from &gt;1kb unigene sequences. A list of PCR primers of SSR loci have been identified to study the genetic polymorphisms. The transcriptome data represents a valuable resource for further investigations on the species genome structure and biology. The unigenes information and microsatellites would provide an indispensable tool for conservation of the species in natural and adaptive environments.
Combination targeted therapy is commonly used to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, particularly in refractory/relapse (RR) population. However, concerns have been raised regarding the safety and patient tolerance of combination chemotherapy. It is critical to choose the appropriate treatment for precision therapy. We performed genome-wide RNA profiling using RNA-Seq to compare the RR group and the complete remission (CR) group (a total of 42 adult AML patients). The Hedgehog (Hh) and PI3K/AKT pathways were upregulated in the RR population, which was further confirmed by western blot and/or qPCR. Overexpression of GLI1 in AML cells led to increased AKT phosphorylation and decreased drug sensitivity, which was attenuated by GLI1 inhibition. By contrast, neither the expression of GLI1 nor apoptosis in response to Ara-C treatment of AML cells was significantly affected by PI3K inhibition. Furthermore, co-inhibition of GLI1 and PI3K induced apoptosis of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), which raised serious concerns about the side effects of this treatment. These results indicated that GLI1 inhibition alone, but not combined inhibition, is sufficient to enhance AML drug sensitivity, which provides a novel therapeutic strategy for AML treatment.
Krüppel-type zinc finger genes (ZNF) constitute a large yet relatively poorly characterized gene family. ZNF genes encode proteins that recognize specific DNA motifs in gene promotors. They act as transcriptional co-activators or -repressors via interaction with chromatin remodeling proteins and other transcription factors. Only few ZNF genes are currently linked to human disorders and identification of ZNF gene-associated human diseases may help understand their function. Here we provide genetic, statistical, and clinical evidence to support association of ZNF148 with a new intellectual disability (ID) syndrome disorder.
Routine diagnostic exome sequencing data were obtained from 2172 patients with ID and/or multiple congenital anomalies.
In a cohort of 2172 patient-parent trios referred for routine diagnostic whole exome sequencing for ID and/or multiple congenital anomalies (MCA) in the period 2012-2016, four patients were identified who carried de novo heterozygous nonsense or frameshift mutations in the ZNF148 gene. This was the only ZNF gene with recurrent truncating de novo mutations in this cohort. All mutations resulted in premature termination codons in the last exon of ZNF148. The number of the de novo truncating mutations in the ZNF148 gene was significantly enriched (p = 5.42 × 10-3). The newly described ZNF148-associated syndrome is characterized by underdevelopment of the corpus callosum, mild to moderate developmental delay and ID, variable microcephaly or mild macrocephaly, short stature, feeding problems, facial dysmorphisms, and cardiac and renal malformations.
We propose ZNF148 as a gene involved in a newly described ID syndrome with a recurrent phenotype and postulate that the ZNF148 is a hitherto unrecognized but crucial transcription factor in the development of the corpus callosum. Our study illustrates the advantage of whole exome sequencing in a large cohort using a parent-offspring trio approach for identifying novel genes involved in rare human diseases.
Objective:To investigate the clinical chacteration and molecular pathology of Waardenburg syndrome type 2 in seven families, and provide genetic diagnosis and hereditary counseling for family members. Method:Clinical data of seven families with WS2（14 patients）were collected. Peripheral blood samples of the probands and related family members were collected and genomic DNA was extracted. The coding sequences of microphthalmia associated transcription factor (MITF), sex-determining region Y-box 10(SOX10), snail family zinc finger 2 (SNAI2) and endothelin receptor type B（EDNRB）were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. Then the raw data was analyzed. Result:The most common manifestations of WS2 are sensorineural hearing loss(10/14,71.4%), freckle(7/14, 50.0%)，heterochromia iridis(6/14, 42.9%) and premature greying(5/14,35.7%). All the deafness phenotype is congenital, bilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss. Freckles phenotype is different from cutaneous pigment abnormalities of WS in Westerners. The heterozygous mutation, c.328C&gt;T in exon 3 of the MITF gene was detected in the proband and all patients of pedigree 2. However, no pathological mutation of the relevant genes (SOX10,SNAI2 and EDNRB) was detected in other pedigrees. Conclusion:There are obvious variations in clinical features of WS, while freckles may be a special subtype of cutaneous pigment disturbances. The MITF gene mutation, R110X,is therefore considered the disease causing mutation in pedigree WS02.However, there are novel disease causing genes or copy number variations in Waardenburg syndrome type 2, which require further research.
Low-grade ovarian cancers represent up to 8% of all epithelial ovarian carcinomas (EOCs). Recent studies demonstrated that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is crucial for the progression of EOCs. EMT plays a key role in cancer invasion, metastasis formation and chemotherapy resistance. An array of novel EMT transcription factors from the zinc finger protein family have been described recently, among them zinc finger protein 143 (ZNF143) and zinc finger protein 281 (ZNF281). The study included tissue specimens from 42 patients. Based on histopathological examination of surgical specimens, eight lesions were classified as serous borderline ovarian tumors (sBOTs) and 34 as low-grade EOCs. The proportions of the ovarian tumors that tested positively for ZNF143 and ZNF281 were 90 and 57%, respectively. No statistically significant differences were found in the expressions of ZNF143 and ZNF281 transcription factors in SBOTs and low-grade EOCs. Considering the expression patterns for ZNF143 and ZNF281 identified in this study, both sBOTs and low-grade EOCs might undergo a dynamic epithelial-mesenchymal interconversion. The lack of statistically significant differences in the expressions of the zinc finger proteins in sBOTs and low-grade serous EOCs might constitute an evidence for common origin of these two tumor types.
Germinated and raw finger millet (Eleusine coracana) and pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) were investigated for their physicochemical (pH, total titratable acidity (TTA), proximate, mineral analysis), phytochemical, and antioxidant properties. The results showed that there were decreases in pH (8.50-7.60) with a corresponding increase in TTA (0.0038-0.18 g/L) during germination of the millets. Proximate composition of the millets revealed slight increases in protein (7.61%-7.81%; 10.57%-11.87%) and crude fiber (5.54%-8.81%; 1.07%-2.55%) with reductions in fat (3.84%-2.73%; 7.69%-2.30%) after germination for finger and pearl millet, respectively. The millets were found to be rich sources of minerals, which include magnesium (1,028.42-1,763.50 ppm), calcium (36.42-4,158.40 ppm), sodium (150.00-510.00 ppm), potassium (470.00-4,500 ppm), zinc (20.00-40.00 ppm), and iron (66.00-121.00 ppm) which either decreased or increased with germination. The results of the phytochemical composition revealed that during germination, alkaloid (36.03-74.53 mg/g) and saponin (4.46-31.91 mg/g) contents were found to increase while there were reductions in tannin (0.88-1.64 mg/g) and phytate (7.00-17.72 mg/g) content of the flour. For finger millet, DPPH ranged from 70.00% to 72.14% and pearl millet (49.95%-64.01%), while for FRAP, pearl millet (53.69-53.76 mg/g) demonstrated better activity compared to finger millet (46.91-53.54 mg/g). Findings from this work may suggest that further studies should be carried out on germinated finger and pearl millets to examine their abilities to serve as functional foods.
Low temperature is a critical environmental factor limiting plant productivity, especially in northern vineyards. To clarify the impact of this stress on grapevine flower, we used the Vitis array based on Roche-NimbleGen technology to investigate the gene expression of flowers submitted to a cold night. Our objectives were to identify modifications in the transcript levels after stress and during recovery. Consequently, our results confirmed some mechanisms known in grapes or other plants in response to cold stress, notably, (1) the pivotal role of calcium/calmodulin-mediated signaling; (2) the over-expression of sugar transporters and some genes involved in plant defense (especially in carbon metabolism), and (3) the down-regulation of genes encoding galactinol synthase (GOLS), pectate lyases, or polygalacturonases. We also identified some mechanisms not yet known to be involved in the response to cold stress, i.e., (1) the up-regulation of genes encoding G-type lectin S-receptor-like serine threonine-protein kinase, pathogen recognition receptor (PRR5), or heat-shock factors among others; (2) the down-regulation of Myeloblastosis (MYB)-related transcription factors and the Constans-like zinc finger family; and (3) the down-regulation of some genes encoding Pathogen-Related (PR)-proteins. Taken together, our results revealed interesting features and potentially valuable traits associated with stress responses in the grapevine flower. From a long-term perspective, our study provides useful starting points for future investigation.
BACKGROUND Esophageal carcinoma is a common gastrointestinal tumor in humans. Cyclopamine, a Hedgehog (Hh)-pathway-specific inhibitor, is an effective chemotherapeutic drug for suppressing tumor cell differentiation, with unclear mechanisms. We investigated glioma-associated oncogene protein-1 (Gli-1) expression in human esophageal carcinoma tissue and the inhibition of cyclopamine on EC9706 esophageal carcinoma cell growth. MATERIAL AND METHODS Gli-1 in tumor tissue was measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC). EC9706 cells were treated with different concentrations of cyclopamine and incubated for different times. MTT method, flow cytometry, and Acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) double-fluorescence staining were applied to detect cell proliferation and apoptosis. Western blot (WB) analysis was performed to assess Gli-1 expression. RESULTS Gli-1 was associated with patient age, gender, lymphatic metastasis, tumor recurrence, and stage, with significantly (P&lt;0.05) positive correlations with age, lymphatic metastasis, tumor recurrence, and stage. At 12 h (F=214.57), 24 h (F=76.832), 48 h (F=236.90), and 72 h (F=164.55), the higher the concentration of cyclopamine, the higher the inhibition rate of suppressing EC9706 proliferation, and this effect was significant (P&lt;0.05). The number of early-apoptosis cells increased as the concentration of cyclopamine increased. Morphology of EC9706 cells appeared as round with rough edges, karyopyknosis, and karyorrhexis. After 48 h, apoptosis rates of EC9706 cells treated with different concentrations of cyclopamine were (7.73±1.25)% at 2.5 μM, (13.37±1.42)% at 5.0 μM, (22.3±2.92)% at 10.0 μM, and (33.57±1.75)% at 20.0 μM, and the effect was dose-dependent. Gli-1 was obviously reduced after cyclopamine treatment and the effect was dose-dependent. CONCLUSIONS Gli-1 is highly expressed in human esophageal carcinoma, and could be a marker for use in assessing tumor stage and the deciding on treatment target.
Dual Specificity Phosphatase 12 is a member of the Atypical DUSP Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase family, meaning that it does not contain typical MAP kinase targeting motifs, while being able to dephosphorylate tyrosine and serine/threonine residues. DUSP12 contains, apart from its catalytic domain, a zinc finger domain, making it one of the largest DUSPs, which displays strong nuclear expression in several tissues. In this work we identified nuclear targets of DUSP12 in two different cancer cell lines (A549 and MCF-7), challenging them with genotoxic stimuli to observe the effect on the networks and to link existing information about DUSP12 functions to the data obtained though mass spectrometry. We found network connections to the cytoskeleton (e.g. IQGAP1), to the chromatin (e.g. HP1BP3), to the splicing machinery and to the previously known pathway of ribosome maturation (e.g. TCOF1), which draw insight into many of the functions of this phosphatase, much likely connecting it to distinct, previously unknown genomic stability mechanisms.
Heavy metal contamination is becoming a limitation to the utilization of soil and the distribution of vegetation. In particular, cadmium (Cd) pollution has had a serious impact on the food chain. Broussonetia papyrifera is a widely distributed pioneer tree species of heavy metal contaminated areas with important economic value. However, little is known about the genomic background of the Cd-tolerance mechanism in B. papyrifera.
The CdCl2 responsive physiology was evaluated and proved to be involved in antioxidase activity and active oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. The leaf and root transcriptomes derived from B. papyrifera grown under normal and CdCl2 stress conditions were systematically investigated using the Illumina HiSeq method. A total of 180,678,660 bp (27.1 GB) clean reads were assembled into 589,487 high-quality unigenes, of which 256,025 (43.43% of the total) and 250,251 (42.45% of the total) were aligned in Gene Ontology (GO) and Protein family (Pfam), respectively. A total of 24,414 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were GO-annotated into 53, 23, 55, and 60 terms from the transcriptomes of root and leaf tissues under Cd stress and control conditions. A total of 117,547 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Orthology (KO)-annotated DEGs were enriched in at least 47 KEGG pathway terms among the four comparisons. Many genes encoding important transcription factors (e.g., auxin/indole-3-acetic acid (AUX/IAA), basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH), DNA-binding one zinc finger (Dof), and MYB) and proteins involved in plant-pathogen interactions, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, plant hormone signal transduction, oxidative phosphorylation, carbon fixation, peroxisomes, flavonoid biosynthesis, and glutathione metabolism, among others, were substantially upregulated under CdCl2 stress.
These genes represent important candidates for studying Cd-response mechanisms and molecular biology of B. papyrifera and related species. Our findings provide a genomic sequence resource for functional genetic assignments in B. papyrifera, which will help elucidate the molecular mechanisms of its Cd-stress responses and facilitate the bioremediation of heavy metal contaminated areas via breeding of new stress-tolerant cultivars.
Ras proteins participate in multiple signal cascades, regulating crucial cellular processes, including cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. We have previously reported that Ras proteins are modified by sumoylation and that Lys-42 plays an important role in mediating the modification. In the current study, we further investigated the role of Lys-42 in regulating cellular activities of K-Ras. Inducible expression of K-RasV12 led to the activation of downstream components, including c-RAF, MEK1, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), whereas expression of K-RasV12/R42 mutant compromised the activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling axis. Expression of K-RasV12/R42 also led to reduced phosphorylation of several other protein kinases, including c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), Chk2, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Significantly, K-RasV12/R42 expression inhibited cellular migration and invasion in vitro in multiple cell lines, including transformed pancreatic cells. Given that K-Ras plays a crucial role in mediating oncogenesis in the pancreas, we treated transformed pancreatic cells of both BxPC-3 and MiaPaCa-2 with 2-D08, a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) E2 inhibitor. Treatment with the compound inhibited cell migration in a concentration-dependent manner, which was correlated with a reduced level of K-Ras sumoylation. Moreover, 2-D08 suppressed expression of ZEB1 (a mesenchymal cell marker) with concomitant induction of ZO-1 (an epithelial cell marker). Combined, our studies strongly suggest that posttranslational modification(s), including sumoylation mediated by Lys-42, plays a crucial role in K-Ras activities in vivo.
We report findings from a male fetus of 26 weeks' gestational age with severe isolated intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) on amniotic fluid cells revealed a 1.06-Mb duplication in 19q13.42 inherited from the healthy father. This duplication contains 34 genes including ZNF331, a gene encoding a zinc-finger protein specifically imprinted (paternally expressed) in the placenta. Study of the ZNF331 promoter by methylation-specific-multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification showed that the duplicated allele was not methylated in the fetus unlike in the father's genome, suggesting both copies of the ZNF331 gene are expressed in the fetus. The anti-ZNF331 immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that ZNF331 was expressed at higher levels in renal and placental tissues from this fetus compared to controls. Interestingly, ZNF331 expression levels in the placenta have previously been reported to inversely correlate with fetal growth parameters. The original observation presented in this report showed that duplication of ZNF331 could be a novel genetic cause of isolated IUGR and underlines the usefulness of CMA to investigate the genetic causes of isolated severe IUGR.
The Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) undertook whole exome sequencing in 5,740 late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD) cases and 5,096 cognitively normal controls primarily of European ancestry (EA), among whom 218 cases and 177 controls were Caribbean Hispanic (CH). An age-, sex- and APOE based risk score and family history were used to select cases most likely to harbor novel AD risk variants and controls least likely to develop AD by age 85 years. We tested ~1.5 million single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 50,000 insertion-deletion polymorphisms (indels) for association to AD, using multiple models considering individual variants as well as gene-based tests aggregating rare, predicted functional, and loss of function variants. Sixteen single variants and 19 genes that met criteria for significant or suggestive associations after multiple-testing correction were evaluated for replication in four independent samples; three with whole exome sequencing (2,778 cases, 7,262 controls) and one with genome-wide genotyping imputed to the Haplotype Reference Consortium panel (9,343 cases, 11,527 controls). The top findings in the discovery sample were also followed-up in the ADSP whole-genome sequenced family-based dataset (197 members of 42 EA families and 501 members of 157 CH families). We identified novel and predicted functional genetic variants in genes previously associated with AD. We also detected associations in three novel genes: IGHG3 (p = 9.8 × 10-7), an immunoglobulin gene whose antibodies interact with β-amyloid, a long non-coding RNA AC099552.4 (p = 1.2 × 10-7), and a zinc-finger protein ZNF655 (gene-based p = 5.0 × 10-6). The latter two suggest an important role for transcriptional regulation in AD pathogenesis.
Zinc finger and AT‑hook domain containing (Zfat) is a transcriptional regulator harboring an AT‑hook domain and 18 repeats of a C2H2 zinc‑finger motif, which binds directly to the proximal region of transcription start sites in Zfat‑target genes. It was previously reported that deletion of the Zfat gene in mice yields embryonic lethality by embryonic day 8.5 and impairs primitive hematopoiesis in yolk sac blood islands. In addition, Zfat has been reported to be involved in thymic T‑cell development and peripheral T‑cell homeostasis. In the present study, in order to obtain a precise understanding of the expression and function of Zfat, a knock‑in mouse strain (ZfatZsG/+ mice), which expressed ZsGreen in the Zfat locus, was established. ZsGreen signals in tissues and cells of ZfatZsG/+ mice were examined by flow cytometric and histological analyses. Consistent with our previous studies, ZsGreen signals in ZfatZsG/+ mice were detected in the embryo and yolk sac blood islands, as well as in thymocytes, B and T cells. In the ZfatZsG/+ thymus, ZsGreen+ cells were identified not only in T‑cell populations but also in thymic epithelial cells, suggesting the role of Zfat in antigen‑presenting cells during thymic T‑cell development. ZsGreen signals were observed in definitive erythroid progenitor cells in the fetal liver and adult bone marrow of ZfatZsG/+ mice. The proportion of ZsGreen+ cells in these tissues was highest at the early stage of erythroid differentiation, suggesting that Zfat serves particular roles in definitive erythropoiesis. Histological studies demonstrated that ZsGreen signals were detected in the pyramidal cells in the hippocampal CA1 region and the Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, suggesting novel functions of Zfat in nervous tissues. Taken together, these results indicated that the ZfatZsG/+ reporter mouse may be considered a useful tool for elucidating the expression and function of Zfat.
The activation of Notch signalling induces epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT), but this signalling pathway and its association with EMT in the context of cell motility in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the role of the Notch signalling pathway and EMT in the metastatic potential of OSCC using 2 cell lines, Tca8113 and CAL27. The data demonstrated that zinc finger domain SNAI1 (Snail) knockdown by small interfering RNA decreased the expression of vimentin and increased the expression of epithelial cadherin (E‑cadherin). In addition, silencing Snail also significantly inhibited cell migration in the 2 OSCC cell lines. It was also identified that blocking Notch signalling with the g‑secretase inhibitor DAPT decreased the expression of the EMT markers Snail and vimentin and increased E‑cadherin expression, accompanied by a significant inhibition of cell migration in the 2 OSCC cell lines. These data clearly indicate that Notch signalling mediates EMT to promote metastasis in OSCC cells. Therefore, targeting Notch signalling and its association with EMT may provide novel insights into the mechanism of invasion and metastasis in OSCC and potential therapeutic interventions.
Epithelial ovarian neoplasms are a heterogeneous group including tumor subsets with distinct clinicopathologic and molecular features. Recent evidence from molecular and genomic studies suggests that whereas low-grade serous carcinomas and high-grade serous carcinomas likely develop on two separate pathways, the low-grade serous carcinomas and serous borderline ovarian tumors may represent various stages of the same developmental continuum. The transformation of borderline ovarian tumors into an invasive neoplasm is associated with an array of molecular changes, inter alia controlled by p53 and PI3K/Akt pathway, as well as with a decrease in E-cadherin expression. The latter implies that epithelial-mesenchymal transition is a critical determinant of borderline ovarian tumor invasiveness. The aim of this study was to analyze the expression of transcription factors involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition: SNAIL, SLUG, TWIST 1, TWIST 2, ZEB 1, and ZEB 2 in borderline tumors and type I ovarian cancers. The study included tissue specimens from 42 patients with histopathologically verified ovarian masses. The expressions for SLUG, TWIST 1, ZEB1, and ZEB 2 were scored based on the nuclear staining, and the expressions of SNAIL and TWIST 2 based on the cytoplasmic and/or nuclear staining. The proportions of ovarian tumors with the immunoexpression of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition transcription factors were 85.7% for SNAIL, 100% for SLUG, 9.5% for TWIST 1, 95.2% for TWIST 2, 23.8% for ZEB 1, and 0% for ZEB 2. The expression patterns of SNAIL, SLUG, TWIST, and ZEB identified in this study suggest that both serous borderline ovarian tumors and type I ovarian cancers undergo dynamic epithelial-mesenchymal interconversions. Our findings obtained in the two groups of tumors which shared some etiopathogenic pathways imply that the expression of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition transcription factors may be activated at early stages of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and thus these molecules may play a pivotal role in the development of both serous borderline ovarian tumors and type I ovarian cancer.
In metazoans, tissues experiencing proteotoxic stress induce "transcellular chaperone signaling" (TCS) that activates molecular chaperones, such as hsp-90, in distal tissues. How this form of inter-tissue communication is mediated to upregulate systemic chaperone expression and whether it can be utilized to protect against protein misfolding diseases remain open questions. Using C. elegans, we identified key components of a systemic stress signaling pathway that links the innate immune response with proteostasis maintenance. We show that mild perturbation of proteostasis in the neurons or the intestine activates TCS via the GATA zinc-finger transcription factor PQM-1. PQM-1 coordinates neuron-activated TCS via the innate immunity-associated transmembrane protein CLEC-41, whereas intestine-activated TCS depends on the aspartic protease ASP-12. Both TCS pathways can induce hsp-90 in muscle cells and facilitate amelioration of Aβ3-42-associated toxicity. This may have powerful implications for the treatment of diseases related to proteostasis dysfunction.
Primrose syndrome (PS) is a rare disorder characterized by macrocephaly, tall stature, intellectual disability, autistic traits, and disturbances of glucose metabolism with insulin-resistant diabetes and distal muscle wasting occurring in adulthood. The disorder is caused by functional dysregulation of ZBTB20, a transcriptional repressor controlling energetic metabolism and developmental programs. ZBTB20 maps in a genomic region that is deleted in the 3q13.31 microdeletion syndrome, which explains the clinical overlap between the two disorders. A narrow spectrum of amino acid substitutions in a restricted region of ZBTB20 encompassing the first and second zinc-finger motifs have been reported thus far. Here, we characterize clinically and functionally the first truncating mutation [(c.1024delC; p.(Gln342Serfs*42)] and a missense change affecting the third zinc-finger motif of the protein [(c.1931C &gt; T; p.(Thr644Ile)]. Our data document that both mutations have dominant negative impact on wild-type ZBTB20, providing further evidence of the specific behavior of PS-causing mutations on ZBTB20 function.
BACKGROUND This study assessed the prognostic value of GLI1 in gastric cancer and analyzed the possible GLI1-related signaling network in chemosensitivity. MATERIAL AND METHODS Bioinformatic data mining was performed by using data in the TCGA-Stomach Cancer (TCGA-STAD) and the Kaplan-Meier plotter. GLI1 co-expressed genes in TCGA-STAD were subjected to KEGG pathway analysis. The genes enriched in the KEGG pathways were further subjected to Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) analysis. RESULTS In TCGA-STAD, high GLI1 gene/exon expression was associated with significantly worse survival (p=0.016 and 0.0023 respectively). In the Kaplan-Meier plotter, high GLI1 expression was associated with unfavorable overall survival (OS) (HR: 1.68, 95%CI: 1.42-2, p&lt;0.0001) and first progression-free survival (FPS) (HR: 1.72, 95%CI: 1.4-2.11, p&lt;0.0001). In TCGA-STAD, 600 GLI1 co-expressed genes were identified (absolute Pearson's r ≥0.5). The most significant pathways were pathways in cancer (p=230.0E-12) and the Hedgehog signaling pathway (p=6.9E-9). PI3K-AKT pathway (p=17.0E-9) has the largest proportion of gene enrichment. Some GLI1 co-expressed genes in the PI3K-AKT pathway are central nodes in the PPI network and also play important roles in chemosensitivity of gastric cancer. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying their co-expression are still largely unexplored. CONCLUSIONS High GLI1 expression is associated with unfavorable OS and FPS in patients with gastric cancer. As a member of the Hedgehog signaling pathway, GLI1 co-expressed genes are also largely enriched in PI3K/AKT pathway in gastric cancer, which is closely related to chemoresistance. The underlying mechanisms are still largely unexplored and need further study.
Lung cancer is one of life-threatening cancers in the worldwide. Liver kinase B1 (LKB1) has been reported to be closely related to cancers; however, the underlying mechanism of LKB1 in lung cancer remains unclear. In our study, a LKB1 specific shRNA was employed to down-regulate LKB1 levels and a LKB1 over-expression plasmid was constructed to up-regulate LKB1 levels. Thereafter, growth of lung cancer cells was assessed by MTT assay and flow cytometry. Effects of LKB1 on the activation of sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway were detected by Western blot. Effects of LKB1 on lung cancer growth and Shh signaling pathway activation were also assessed in vivo. Our results showed that LKB1 inhibited proliferation of lung cancer cells and induced their apoptosis. Moreover, LKB1 inhibited Shh signaling pathway activation. Our in vivo study also showed that LKB1 inhibited lung cancer growth in vivo and modulated Shh signaling pathway. Treatment with cyclopamine, a Shh signaling pathway inhibitor, reversed the effects of LKB1 silencing and enhanced the effects of LKB1 over-expression. Results of our study demonstrate that LKB1 inhibits lung cancer growth in vitro and in vivo through Shh signaling pathway.
Accumulating evidence showed that cytokines are involved in the development of cancer. IL-13 was showed to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition and promote metastasis in colorectal cancer, providing a promising therapeutic target for cancer patients. Interestingly, recent studies showed that propofol, one of most common intravenous anesthetic agent, may have antitumor function in different cancer type. However, the impact of propofol on colorectal cancer and IL-13 induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition remains unknown. Herein, we found that propofol can effectively suppress cell proliferation in colorectal cell lines RKO and SW480 cells by using MTT assay. Furthermore, wound healing assay and migration assay demonstrated that propofol has the ability to inhibit epithelial-mesenchymal transition that induced by IL-13 in RKO and SW480 cells. Mechanistically, we found propofol treatment causes up-regulation of miR-361 and miR-135b, that suppress expression of STAT6 and thereafter leads to the inhibition of IL-13/STAT6/ZEB1 signaling pathway. In conclusion, our data for the first time demonstrated that propofol may serve as a novel therapeutic drug for targeting IL-13. The aggressive function of IL-13/STAT6/ZEB1 axis in colorectal cancer was impaired by propofol through miR-361 and miR-135b.
As a novel member of the Rab GTPase family, the role of Rab23 has been reported in multiple types of tumor. However, to the best of our knowledge, the role of Rab23 in ovarian cancer (OC) has not yet been reported. In the present study, immunohistochemistry analysis demonstrated that Rab23 was upregulated in OC tissue; survival analysis indicated that Rab23 expression was associated with a reduced overall survival (OS) rate and disease-free survival (DFS) time. In vitro experiments also demonstrated the increased expression of Rab23 in the OC cells lines, A2780 and SKOV-3, compared with in the normal ovarian cell line, IOSE80. Following the silencing of ABCG2 in SKOV-3 cells, ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2) expression was significantly downregulated both at the RNA and protein levels. The cisplatin (DDP) IC50 declined from 43.09±7.12 µmol/l in control cells to 26.46±5.38 µmol/l in SKOV-3 cells with silenced Rab23. In contrast, in A2780 cells overexpressing Rab23 (A2780-Rab23), ABCG2 expression was significantly upregulated and the DDP IC50 increased from 27.42±6.54 µmol/l in control cells to 45.92±5.23 µmol/l in A2780-Rab23. Investigation into the potential molecular mechanisms for this revealed that the expression of sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Gli family zinc finger 1 (Gli1) was increased in A2780-Rab23 cells, whereas silencing Rab23 in SKOV-3 cells significantly inhibited the expression of Shh and Gli1. The Gli1 inhibitor GANT-61 significantly abrogated the increased ABCG2 expression in A2780-Rab23 cells. Furthermore, the DDP IC50 in A2780-Rab23 cells decreased significantly following the silencing of ABCG2 expression; the IC50 declined from 51.66±8.32 µmol/l in A2780-Rab23 cells to 25.61±6.17 µmol/l in A2780-Rab23 cells with silenced ABCG2. Collectively, the results indicate that Rab23 promotes the DDP resistance of OC cells via the Shh-Gli1-ABCG2 pathway, providing the proof of principle for the further investigation of drug resistance therapy targeting Rab23.
Microcystin (MC) is a cyclic heptapeptide compound which could lead to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the underlying epigenetic regulation mechanism is largely unknown. In this study, microcystin-LR (L: lysine, R: arginine, MC-LR) was used to induce the malignant transformation of human hepatocyte L02 cell line. The profile of gene expression, microRNA (miRNA) and DNA methylation were detected through high-throughput sequencing. Compared with control group, the expression of 826 genes and 187 miRNAs changed significantly in MC-LR treated group. DNA methylation sequencing analysis showed that 2592 CpG sites differentially methylated in promoter or the coding DNA sequence (CDS) of genes, while DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha (DNMT3a) and DNA methyltransferase 3 beta (DNMT3b) were dramatically up-regulated. Functional analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that significantly changed mRNAs and microRNAs were mainly involved in the formation of cancer, proliferation, invasion, migration and metabolism. MiRNA-mRNA network and mRNA-mRNA network analysis showed that hsa-miR-320a, hsa-miR-331-3p, hsa-miR-26a-5p, hsa-miR-196a-5p, hsa-miR-221-3p, coiled-coil domain containing 180 (CCDC180), melanoma antigen gene family member D1 (MAGED1), membrane spanning 4-domains A7 (MS4A7), hephaestin like 1 (HEPHL1), BH3 (Bcl-2 homology 3)-like motif containing, cell death inducer (BLID), matrix metallopeptidase 13 (MMP13), guanylate binding protein 5 (GBP5), adipogenesis regulatory factor (ADIRF), formin homology 2 domain containing 1 (FHDC1), protein kinase CAMP-dependent type II regulatory subunit beta (PRKAR2B), nodium leak channel, non-selective (NALCN), myosin light chain kinase 3 (MYLK3), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and zinc finger protein 704 (ZNF704) were key miRNAs and genes in the malignant transformation induced by MC-LR in L02 cells. Moreover, we found that expression of MYLK3, EGFR and ZNF704 were regulated by DNA methylation and miRNAs, and these genes affected the cell cycle and cell division. Our study suggested that characteristic gene alterations regulated by DNA methylation and miRNA could play an important role in environmental MC-LR induced hepatic carcinogenesis.
Kaiso is a member of the BTB/POZ zinc finger family, which is involved in cancer progression, cell cycle control, apoptosis, and WNT signaling. Depending on promoter context, it may function as either a transcriptional repressor or activator. Previous studies found that Kaiso might be SUMOylated due to heat shock, but the biological significance of Kaiso SUMOylation is unclear. Here, we find that K42 is the only amino acid within Kaiso that is modified with SUMO. Kaiso is monoSUMOylated at lysine 42 in cell lines of kidney origin under normal physiological conditions. SUMOylated Kaiso can activate transcription from exogenous methylated promoters, wherein the deSUMOylated form of the protein kept the ability to be a repressor. Rapid Kaiso deSUMOylation occurs in response to hyperosmotic stress and is reversible upon return to an isotonic environment. DeSUMOylation occurs within minutes in HEK293 cells treated with 100 mM NaCl and relaxes in 3 h even in a salt-containing medium. Genomic editing of Kaiso by conversion of K42 into R42 (K42R) in HEK293 cells that resulted in fully deSUMOylated endogenous protein led to misregulation of genes associated with ion transport, blood pressure, and the immune response. TRIM25 was significantly repressed in two K42R HEK293 clones. By a series of rescue experiments with K42R and KO HEK293 cells, we show that TRIM25 is a direct transcriptional target for Kaiso. In the absence of Kaiso, the level of TRIM25 is insensitive to hyperosmotic stress. Extending our observations to animal models, we show that in response to a high salt diet, Kaiso knockout mice are characterized by significantly higher blood pressure increases when compared to wild-type animals. Thus, we propose a novel biological role for Kaiso in the regulation of homeostasis.
There is still much ambiguity in studies of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathways and its dysregulation. Some studies concerning the role of the Shh pathway in basal cell carcinoma (BCC) have been conducted, but there is a lack of studies about Shh pathway dysregulation under the influence of ultraviolet (UV)B radiation.
To evaluate skin expression of Shh, Ptch1, Ptch2, Smo and Gli1 proteins in BCCs with and without the influence of UVB radiation.
In total, 34 healthy controls (HCs) and 42 patients with nodular BCC were recruited into the study. Patients were divided into five groups (A-E), depending on UVB dose received and BCC status. In all skin specimens, expression of Shh, Ptch1, Ptch2, Smo and Gli1 protein was evaluated.
Comparing the BCC group with the HC group, there was significantly higher expression of Shh, Ptch1, Ptch2, Smo and Gli1 proteins. Expression of Ptch2, Smo and Gli1 was increased in response to UVB doses of 3 MED (minimal erythema dose), whereas expression of Ptch1 and Shh was unaffected.
The lack of change in expression of Shh and Ptch1 after exposure to UVB suggests that the Shh pathway may be activated through a noncanonical pathway under the influence of strong UVB doses.
ACTB-GLI1 fusions have been reported as the pathognomonic genetic abnormality defining an unusual subset of actin-positive, perivascular myoid tumors, known as "pericytoma with the t(7;12) translocation." In addition, GLI1 oncogenic activation through a related MALAT1-GLI1 gene fusion has been recently reported in 2 unrelated gastric tumors, namely plexiform fibromyxoma and gastroblastoma. Triggered by unexpected targeted RNA-sequencing results detecting GLI1-related fusions in a group of malignant neoplasms with round to epithelioid morphology, and frequently strong S100 protein immunoreactivity, we investigated their clinicopathologic features in relation to other known pathologic entities sharing similar genetics. On the basis of a combined approach of targeted RNA sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization screening, we identified 6 cases with GLI1 gene fusions, including 4 fused to ACTB, 1 with MALAT1 and 1 with PTCH1 gene. Patients had a mean age of 36 years at diagnosis (range, 16 to 79 y) and slight female predilection all except 1 tumor originated in the soft tissue. Microscopically, the tumors had a monomorphic epithelioid phenotype arranged in a distinctive nested or cord-like architecture, separated by thin septae and delicate capillary network. All except 2 cases were strongly positive for S100 protein, whereas being negative for SOX10, SMA, and EMA. Only 1 tumor showed focal cytokeratin positivity in rare cells. Although the tumors showed some resemblance to pericytic/glomus tumors or myoepithelial tumors, the immunoprofile was not supportive of either lineage. Moreover, in contrast to the benign course of so-called pericytoma with t(7;12), 3 patients in this series developed metastatic disease to either lymph nodes or lung. In fact the only patient with lung metastases showed a novel PTCH1-GLI1 gene fusion. It remains to be determined whether these tumors represent a clinically and immunohistologically distinct subset of pericytoma, or an altogether novel soft tissue sarcoma. Our findings open new opportunities for targeted therapy, as tumors with GLI1 oncogenic activation, and subsequent PTCH1 overexpression, might be sensitive to sonic hedgehog pathway inhibitors.
RNA activation mediated by small double-stranded RNAs targeting promoter sequence named small activating RNAs (saRNAs) is one of the mechanisms for gene activation. Artificial regulation of gene expression through RNA activation does not affect the alteration of the genomic DNA sequences or exogenous plasmid DNA, therefore it is a relative manageable approach for gene perturbation. KLF4 is a member of zinc-finger transcription factors and its functions in colorectal cells are still controversial. In order to elucidate the functions of KLF4, we synthesized saRNAs that target the promoter regions of KLF4 and transfected into varied colorectal epithelial cell lines. We found the KLF4 gene expression is specifically increased in the human normal epithelial cell NCM460 and colorectal epithelial cancer cell Caco-2 and HCT116, but not in other human colorectal epithelial cell lines. In addition, we observed that saRNAs induced overexpression of KLF4 could promote cell migration/invasion in NCM460 and HCT116 cell lines. This effect is mediated partly by inducing EMT and facilitating nuclear translocation of β-catenin.
Rosiglitazone (RG) is a well-known activator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) and used to treat hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes; however, its clinical application has been confounded by adverse side effects. Here, we assessed the roles of chlorogenic acid (CGA), a phenolic secondary metabolite found in many fruits and vegetables, on the differentiation and lipolysis of mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. The results showed that CGA promoted differentiation in vitro according to oil red O staining and quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays. As a potential molecular mechanism, CGA downregulated mRNA levels of the adipocyte differentiation-inhibitor gene Pref1 and upregulated those of major adipogenic transcriptional factors (Cebpb and Srebp1). Additionally, CGA upregulated the expression of the differentiation-related transcriptional factor PPARγ2 at both the mRNA and protein levels. However, following CGA intervention, the accumulation of intracellular triacylglycerides following preadipocyte differentiation was significantly lower than that in the RG group. Consistent with this, our data indicated that CGA treatment significantly upregulated the expression of lipogenic pathway-related genes Plin and Srebp1 during the differentiation stage, although the influence of CGA was weaker than that of RG. Notably, CGA upregulated the expression of the lipolysis-related gene Hsl, whereas it did not increase the expression of the lipid synthesis-related gene Dgat1. These results demonstrated that CGA might function as a potential PPARγ agonist similar to RG; however, the impact of CGA on lipolysis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes differed from that of RG.
The transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) has a key role in both T cell activation and tolerance and has emerged as an important target of immune modulation. NFAT directs the effector arm of the immune response in the presence of activator protein-1 (AP-1), and T cell anergy/exhaustion in the absence of AP-1. Envisioning a strategy for selective modulation of the immune response, we designed a FRET-based high-throughput screen to identify compounds that disrupt the NFAT:AP-1:DNA complex. We screened ∼202,000 small organic compounds and identified 337 candidate inhibitors. We focus here on one compound, N-(3-acetamidophenyl)-2-[5-(1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)pyridin-2-yl]sulfanylacetamide (Compound 10), which disrupts the NFAT:AP-1 interaction at the composite antigen-receptor response element-2 site without affecting the binding of NFAT or AP-1 alone to DNA. Compound 10 binds to DNA in a sequence-selective manner and inhibits the transcription of the Il2 gene and several other cyclosporin A-sensitive cytokine genes important for the effector immune response. This study provides proof-of-concept that small molecules can inhibit the assembly of specific DNA-protein complexes, and opens a potential new approach to treat human diseases where known transcription factors are deregulated.
Anticancer-drug efficacy seems to involve the direct interaction with host immune cells. Although topoisomerase I (Top I) inhibitors have been suggested to block LPS-evoked inflammation, the interaction between these drugs and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is unaddressed.
SN-38, the active metabolite of the Top I inhibitor irinotecan, and TLR4 interaction was assessed using the in vitro luciferase nuclear factor-κB reporter assay, neutrophil migration to murine air-pouch, in silico simulation, and the thermal shift assay (TSA). Topotecan was used as a positive anti-inflammatory control.
Non-cytotoxic concentrations of SN-38 attenuated LPS (a TLR4 agonist)-driven cell activation without affecting peptidoglycan (a TLR2 agonist)-activating response. Similarly, topotecan also prevented LPS-induced inflammation. Conversely, increasing concentrations of LPS reversed the SN-38 inhibitory effect. In addition, SN-38 abrogated LPS-dependent neutrophil migration and reduced TNF-α, IL-6, and keratinocyte chemoattractant levels in the air-pouch model, but failed to inhibit zymosan (a TLR2 agonist)-induced cell migration. A two-step molecular docking analysis indicated two potential binding sites for the SN-38 in the MD-2/TLR4 complex, the hydrophobic MD-2 pocket (binding energy of - 8.1 kcal/mol) and the rim of the same molecule (- 6.9 kcal/mol). The topotecan also bound to the MD-2 pocket. In addition, not only the lactone forms, but also the carboxylate conformations of both Top I inhibitors interacted with the MD-2 molecule. Furthermore, the TSA suggested the interaction of SN-38 with MD-2.
Therefore, SN-38 inhibits acute inflammation by blocking LPS-driven TLR4 signaling. This mechanism seems to be shared by other Top I inhibitors.
Platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ) is overexpressed in a variety of malignant cancers, plays a critical role in tumor angiogenesis, and has been proven as a valuable target for cancer treatment. In this pilot study, a dimeric affibody molecule, ZPDGFRβ, was prepared and radiolabeled with positron emission radionuclide zirconium-89 for PET imaging of colorectal tumors by targeting PDGFRβ expression in vivo. The PDGFRβ-binding capability of dimeric affibody was evaluated by flow cytometry, immunofluorescent staining, and whole-body optical imaging. Then, ZPDGFRβ was conjugated with DFO-Bn-NCS and radiolabeled with 89Zr. Targeted binding capability of 89Zr-DFO-ZPDGFRβ to PDGFRβ expressing cells was investigated by cellular assay in vitro and microPET/CT imaging in vivo. Dimeric ZPDGFRβ affibody had specifically higher binding capability with PDGFRβ expressing pericytes rather than LS-174T cancer cells, and well colocalized with tumor neovasculature by flow cytometry and immunofluorescent assay. ZPDGFRβ was successfully labeled with 89Zr by DFO chelating with yield of 94.1 ± 3.53%. 89Zr-DFO-ZPDGFRβ indicated preserved specific binding ability with PDGFRβ expressing cells and effective inhibiting capability to PDGF-β ligands ( P &lt; 0.05) in vitro. Biodistribution indicated that tumor uptake of 89Zr-DFO-ZPDGFRβ reached the peak of 6.93 ± 0.64%ID/g, and the tumor-to-blood ratio was 5.5 ± 0.6 at 2 h post-injection. LS-174T xenografts were clearly visualized by microPET/CT imaging through 1 to 4 h post-injection of 89Zr-DFO-ZPDGFRβ affibody conjugate. In conclusion, the 89Zr-DFO-ZPDGFRβ conjugate demonstrated specific and high binding ability with colorectal tumor, which indicated its use as a potential radiopharmaceutical for diagnostic imaging of tumor associate vasculatures with PET/CT.
L35 and FAO cells were derived as single cell isolates from H35 cells. Whereas L35 cells do not express microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), which regulates lipoprotein secretion, they express CYP7A1, which regulates bile acid synthesis from cholesterol. FAO cells display the opposite phenotype (i.e. expression of MTP but not CYP7A1). We examined the molecular basis of the transcriptional inactivation of the MTP gene in L35 cells. Nested deletion and mutagenesis studies show that a conserved DR1 element within the 135-bp proximal MTP promoter is responsible for differential expression by L35 and FAO cells. Yeast one-hybrid screening identified apolipoprotein A1 regulatory protein-1/chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II (ARP-1/COUP-TFII) and retinoid X receptor (RXRalpha) as the protein factors that can bind to the conserved DR1 element. Nuclear extracts from L35 cells contained 2-fold more ARP-1/COUP-TFII and 50% less RXRalpha than those from FAO cells. Immunologic studies show that in L35 cells, ARP-1/COUP-TFII is bound to the DR1 element, whereas in FAO cells, a complex containing RXRalpha is bound to the DR1 element. Co-transfection studies show that ARP-1/COUP-TFII repressed MTP promoter activity by approximately 70% in FAO hepatoma cells, whereas RXRalpha and its ligand 9-cis-retinoic acid increased MTP promoter activity by 6-fold in L35 cells. The combined data suggest that in the context of the MTP promoter, ARP-1/COUP-TFII (repressor) and a complex containing RXRalpha (inducer) compete for the DR1 element. Analysis of the CYP7A1 promoter revealed that it is approximately 5-fold more active in L35 cells than in FAO cells. Co-transfection of an ARP-1/COUP-TFII expression vector showed that it enhances CYP7A1 promoter activity by 6-fold in FAO cells. These combined findings indicate that ARP-1/COUP-TFII acts as both a transcriptional repressor (of MTP) and as a transcription activator (of CYP7A1). This dual function of ARP-1/COUP-TFII may play an important role in determining the metabolic phenotype of individual liver cells.
Bile acids regulate the cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase gene (CYP7A1), which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme in the classical pathway of bile acid synthesis. Here we report a novel mechanism whereby bile acid feedback regulates CYP7A1 transcription through the nuclear receptor hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF-4), which binds to the bile acid response element (BARE) at nt -149/-118 relative to the transcription start site. Using transient transfection assays of HepG2 cells with Gal4-HNF-4 fusion proteins, we show that chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) dampened the transactivation potential of HNF-4. Overexpression of a constitutive active form of MEKK1, an upstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) module triggered by stress signals, strongly repressed the promoter activity of CYP7A1 via the consensus sequence for HNF-4 embedded in the BARE. Similarly, MEKK1 inhibited the activity of HNF-4 in the Gal4-based assay. The involvement of the MEKK1-dependent pathway in the bile acid-mediated repression of CYP7A1 was confirmed by co-transfecting a dominant negative form of the stress-activated protein kinase kinase, SEK, which abolished the effect of CDCA upon CYP7A1 transcription. Treatment of transfected HepG2 cells with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), an activator of the MEKK1 pathway, led to the repression of CYP7A1 via the HNF-4 site in the BARE. TNF-alpha also inhibited the transactivation potential of HNF-4. Collectively, our results demonstrate for the first time that HNF-4, in combination with a MAPK signaling pathway, acts as a bile acid sensor in the liver. Furthermore, the effects of CDCA and TNF-alpha converge to HNF-4, which binds to the BARE of CYP7A1, suggesting a link between the cascades elicited by bile acids and pro-inflammatory stimuli in the liver.
The gene encoding cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A), the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis, is transcriptionally regulated by bile acids and hormones. Previously, we have identified two bile acid response elements (BARE) in the promoter of the CYP7A gene. The BARE II is located in nt -149/-118 region and contains three hormone response element (HRE)-like sequences that form two overlapping nuclear receptor binding sites. One is a direct repeat separated by one nucleotide DR1 (-146- TGGACTtAGTTCA-134) and the other is a direct repeat separated by five nucleotides DR5 (-139-AGTTCAaggccGGG TAA-123). Mutagenesis of these HRE sequences resulted in lower transcriptional activity of the CYP7A promoter/reporter genes in transient transfection assay in HepG2 cells. The orphan nuclear receptor, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF-4)1, binds to the DR1 sequence as assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and activates the CYP7A promoter/reporter activity by about 9-fold. Cotransfection of HNF-4 plasmid with another orphan nuclear receptor, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II (COUP-TFII), synergistically activated the CYP7A transcription by 80-fold. The DR5 binds the RXR/RAR heterodimer. A hepatocyte nuclear factor-3 (HNF-3) binding site (-175-TGTTTGTTCT-166) was identified. HNF-3 was required for both basal transcriptional activity and stimulation of the rat CYP7A promoter activity by retinoic acid. Combinatorial interactions and binding of these transcription factors to BAREs may modulate the promoter activity and also mediate bile acid repression of CYP7A gene transcription.
The cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase gene (CYP7A) is transcriptionally regulated by a number of factors, including hormones, bile acids, and diurnal rhythm. Previous studies have identified a region from nucleotides (nt) -74 to -55 of the rat CYP7A promoter that enhanced bile acid repression of the SV40 early promoter, as assayed with a luciferase reporter gene in transiently transfected HepG2 cells. The rat CYP7A promoter/reporter activity was strongly stimulated by cotransfection with an expression plasmid encoding the nuclear hormone receptor chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II (COUP-TFII) in a dose-dependent manner. Site-directed mutagenesis in the region of nt -74 to -55 altered this stimulation. Recombinant COUP-TFII expressed in HepG2 or COS-1 cells were found to bind to nt -74 -55 and nt -149 -128 probes by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and by supershifting the corresponding band with COUP-TFII-specific antibodies. The region of nt -176 -117 was previously mapped as a retinoic acid response region and was found to bind retinoid X receptor (RXR). EMSA supershift assays of wild-type and mutant oligomers using antibody against RXR revealed that the sequences between nt -145 and -134 were important for RXR binding. We conclude that COUP-TFII stimulates the transcriptional activity of the rat CYP7A promoter by binding to the sequences between nt -74 to -54 and nt -149 to -128. RXR may stimulate CYP7A gene transcription by binding to a direct repeat of the hormone response element separated by one nucleotide located at nt -146 -134.
FXR (farnesoid X receptor), a nuclear receptor activated by BAs (bile acids), is a key factor in the regulation of BA, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. The recent development of synthetic FXR agonists and knockout mouse models has accelerated the discovery of FXR target genes. In the present study, we identify human fetuin-B as a novel FXR target gene. Treatment with FXR agonists increased fetuin-B expression in human primary hepatocytes and in the human hepatoma HepG2 cell line. In contrast, fetuin-B expression was not responsive to FXR agonist treatment in murine primary hepatocytes. Fetuin-B induction by FXR agonist was abolished upon FXR knockdown by siRNA (small interfering RNA). In addition to the previously described P1 promoter, we show that the human fetuin-B gene is also transcribed from an alternative promoter, termed P2. Transcription via the P2 promoter was induced by FXR agonist treatment, whereas P1 promoter activity was not sensitive to FXR agonist treatment. Two putative FXR-response elements [IR-1 (inverted repeat-1)] were identified in the region -1.6 kb upstream of the predicted P2 transcriptional start site. Both motifs bound FXR-RXR (retinoid X receptor) complexes in vitro and were activated by FXR in transient transfection reporter assays. Mutations in the IR-1 sites abolished FXR-RXR binding and activation. Taken together, these results identify human fetuin-B as a new FXR target gene in human hepatocytes.
Multidrug resistance-associated protein MRP3/Mrp3 (ABCC3) is upregulated in cholestasis, an adaptive response that may protect the liver from accumulation of toxic compounds, such as bile salts and bilirubin conjugates. However, the mechanism of this upregulation is poorly understood. We and others have previously reported that fetoprotein transcription factor/liver receptor homolog-1 is an activator of MRP3/Mrp3 expression. In searching for additional regulatory elements in the human MRP3 promoter, we have now identified nuclear receptor retinoic X receptor-alpha:retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RXRalpha:RARalpha) as a repressor of MRP3 activation by transcription factor Sp1. A luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that cotransfection of transcription factor Sp1 stimulates the MRP3 promoter activity and that additions of RXRalpha:RARalpha abrogated this activation in a dose-dependent manner. Site mutations and gel shift assays have identified a Sp1 binding GC box motif at -113 to -108 nts upstream from the MRP3 translation start site, where RXRalpha:RARalpha specifically reduced Sp1 binding to this site. Mutation of the GC box also reduced MRP3 promoter activity. The functional role of RXRalpha:RARalpha as a repressor of MRP3 expression was further confirmed by RARalpha small-interfering RNA knockdown in HepG2 cells, which upregulated endogenous MRP3 expression. In summary, our results indicate that activator Sp1 and repressor RXRalpha:RARalpha act in concert to regulate MRP3 expression. Since RXRalpha:RARalpha expression is diminished by cholestatic liver injury, loss of RXRalpha:RARalpha may lead to upregulation of MRP3/Mrp3 expression in these disorders.
The efficient removal of unwanted cells, such as senescent, damaged, mutated or infected cells is crucial for the maintenance of normal liver function. In fact, apoptosis has emerged as a potential contributor to the pathogenesis of a number of hepatic disorders, such as viral hepatitis, autoimmune diseases, ethanol-induced injury, cholestasis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In contrast to the effect of cytotoxic bile acids in the liver, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has increasingly been used for the treatment of various liver disorders. The clinical efficacy of this hydrophilic bile acid was first recognized by its use in traditional Asian medicine. However, many studies have subsequently confirmed that UDCA improves liver function by three major mechanisms of action, including protection of cholangiocytes against the cytotoxicity of hydrophobic bile acids, stimulation of hepatobiliary secretion, and inhibition of liver cell apoptosis. UDCA acts as a potent inhibitor of the classical mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis, but also interferes with alternate and upstream molecular targets such as the E2F-1/p53 pathway. Together, there is growing evidence that this hydrophilic bile acid may modulate gene expression to prevent cell death. Curiously, as a cholesterol-derived molecule, UDCA interacts with nuclear steroid receptors, such as the glucocorticoid receptor. Nuclear steroid receptors play crucial roles in mediating steroid hormone signaling involved in many biological processes, including apoptosis. Here, we review the anti-apoptotic mechanisms of UDCA in hepatic cells, and discuss a potential involvement of nuclear steroid receptors in mediating the survival effects of UDCA.
TGR5 (also known as G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1, GPBAR1) is a G protein-coupled bile acid receptor that is expressed in many diverse tissues. TGR5 is involved in various metabolic processes, including glucose metabolism and energy expenditure; however, TGR5's function in skeletal muscle is not fully understood. Using both gain- and loss-of-function mouse models, we demonstrate here that Tgr5 activation promotes muscle cell differentiation and muscle hypertrophy. Both young and old transgenic mice with muscle-specific Tgr5 expression exhibited increased muscle strength. Moreover, we found that Tgr5 expression is increased by the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is an adaptive response required for maintenance of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis. Both ER stress response element (ERSE)- and unfolded protein response element (UPRE)-like sites are present in the 5' upstream region of the Tgr5 gene promoter and are essential for Tgr5 expression by Atf6α (activating transcription factor 6α), a well known UPR-activated transcriptional regulator. We observed that in the skeletal muscle of mice, exercise-induced UPR increases Tgr5 expression, an effect that was abrogated in Atf6α KO mice, indicating that Atf6α is essential for this response. These findings indicate that the bile acid receptor Tgr5 contributes to improved muscle function and provide an additional explanation for the beneficial effects of exercise on skeletal muscle activity.
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) patients have elevated plasma saturated free fatty acid levels. These toxic fatty acids can induce liver cell death and our recent results demonstrated that the biliary epithelium may be susceptible to lipotoxicity. Here, we explored the molecular mechanisms of cholangiocyte lipoapoptosis in cell culture and in an animal model of NASH. Treatment of cholangiocytes with palmitate (PA) showed increased caspase 3/7 activity and increased levels of cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and cleaved caspase 3, demonstrating cholangiocyte lipoapoptosis. Interestingly, treatment with PA significantly increased the levels of microRNA miR-34a, a pro-apoptotic microRNA known to be elevated in NASH. PA induction of miR-34a was abolished in cholangiocytes transduced with forkhead family of transcription factor class O (FoxO)3 shRNA, demonstrating that FoxO3 activation is upstream of miR-34a and suggesting that FoxO3 is a novel transcriptional regulator of miR-34a. Further, anti-miR-34a protected cholangiocytes from PA-induced lipoapoptosis. Direct and indirect targets of miR-34a, such as SIRT1, receptor tyrosine kinase (MET), Kruppel-like factor 4, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)1, and FGFR4, were all decreased in PA-treated cholangiocytes. SIRT1 and MET were partially rescued by a miR-34a antagonist. Cholangiocyte apoptosis and miR-34a were dramatically increased in the liver of mice with early histologic features of NASH. Our study provides evidence for the pro-apoptotic role of miR-34a in PA-induced cholangiocyte lipoapoptosis in culture and in the liver.
Although previous studies suggest that myeloid zinc-finger 1 (MZF-1) is a multifaceted transcription factor that may function as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor, the molecular bases determining its different traits remain elusive. Increasing evidence suggests that disorders in iron metabolism affect tumorigenesis and tumor behaviors, and that excess tumor iron stimulates tumor progression through various mechanisms such as enhancing DNA replication and energy metabolism. Ferroportin (FPN) is the only known iron exporter in mammalian cells, and it determines global iron egress out of cells. FPN reduction leads to decreased iron efflux and increased intracellular iron that consequentially aggravates the oncogenic effects of iron. MZF-1 was recently identified as a transcription factor that regulates FPN expression. Thus far, however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the MZF-1-FPN signaling in cancers are largely unknown. Here, we found a significant reduction of FPN levels in prostate tumors relative to adjacent tissues, and demonstrated a crucial role of FPN in tumor growth through controlling tumor iron concentration. Inhibition of MZF-1 expression led to reduced FPN concentration, coupled with resultant intracellular iron retention, increased iron-related cellular activities and enhanced tumor cell growth. In contrast, increase of MZF-1 expression restrained tumor cell growth by promoting FPN-driven iron egress. Importantly, we demonstrated that AP4 and c-Myb jointly modulated MZF-1 transcription, and that miR-492 was also directly involved in regulating MZF-1 concentration through binding to the 3' untranslated regions of its mRNA. These results correlate with reduced AP4 and c-Myb expression and elevated miR-492 expression found in prostate tumors as compared with adjacent tissues that resulted in diminished MZF-1 and FPN. Moreover, we demonstrated that alterations of AP4, c-Myb and miR-492 levels significantly affected tumor cell growth. Targeting molecules within the MZF-1-FPN signaling thus appears to be a promising approach to restrain prostate cancer. 
In this study, biomarkers and transcriptional factor motifs were identified in order to investigate the etiology and phenotypic severity of Down syndrome. GSE 1281, GSE 1611, and GSE 5390 were downloaded from the gene expression ominibus (GEO). A robust multiarray analysis (RMA) algorithm was applied to detect differentially expressed genes (DEGs). In order to screen for biological pathways and to interrogate the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database, the database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery (DAVID) was used to carry out a gene ontology (GO) function enrichment for DEGs. Finally, a transcriptional regulatory network was constructed, and a hypergeometric distribution test was applied to select for significantly enriched transcriptional factor motifs. CBR1, DYRK1A, HMGN1, ITSN1, RCAN1, SON, TMEM50B, and TTC3 were each up-regulated two-fold in Down syndrome samples compared to normal samples; of these, SON and TTC3 were newly reported. CBR1, DYRK1A, HMGN1, ITSN1, RCAN1, SON, TMEM50B, and TTC3 were located on human chromosome 21 (mouse chromosome 16). The DEGs were significantly enriched in macromolecular complex subunit organization and focal adhesion pathways. Eleven significantly enriched transcription factor motifs (PAX5, EGR1, XBP1, SREBP1, OLF1, MZF1, NFY, NFKAPPAB, MYCMAX, NFE2, and RP58) were identified. The DEGs and transcription factor motifs identified in our study provide biomarkers for the understanding of Down syndrome pathogenesis and progression. 
A combined therapy of sulindac sulfide and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a promising strategy for the treatment of cancer. Sulindac sulfide had been shown to induce the expression of death receptor 5 (DR5), a receptor for TRAIL, and sensitize cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis; however, the molecular mechanism underlying the upregulation of DR5 has not yet been elucidated. We demonstrate here that myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1) mediates the induction of DR5 by sulindac sulfide. Sulindac sulfide induced the expression of DR5 at the protein and mRNA levels in colon cancer SW480 cells. Furthermore, sulindac sulfide increased DR5 promoter activity. We showed that sulindac sulfide stimulated DR5 promoter activity via the -301 to -253 region. This region contained a putative MZF1-binding site. Site-directed mutations in the site abrogated the enhancement in DR5 promoter activity by sulindac sulfide. MZF1 directly bound to the putative MZF1-binding site of the DR5 promoter and the binding was increased by sulindac sulfide. The expression of MZF1 was also increased by sulindac sulfide, and MZF1 siRNA attenuated the upregulation of DR5 by sulindac sulfide. These results indicate that sulindac sulfide induces the expression of DR5 by up-regulating MZF1. 
Recently, new tissue-specific functions for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) have been discovered, aside from its archetypal function in glycolysis. This casts doubt on the legitimacy of using GAPDH as a normalization control for gene expression analysis. We report the binding of the myeloid zinc finger-1 (MZF-1) transcription factor to the human GAPDH promoter. Furthermore, we show that up-regulation of MZF-1 by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) induces GAPDH in HS-5 stromal fibroblasts, while knockdown of MZF1 by shRNA leads to a concomitant reduction in GAPDH expression. This argues that MZF-1 regulates GAPDH, indicating a role for GAPDH in calcitriol-mediated signaling. 
Articular chondrocytes are responsible for the maintenance of healthy articulations; indeed, dysregulation of their functions, including the production of matrix proteins and matrix-remodeling proteases, may result in fraying of the tissue and development of osteoarthritis (OA). To explore transcriptional mechanisms that contribute to the regulation of chondrocyte homeostasis and may be implicated in OA development, we compared the gene expression profile of a set of zinc finger proteins potentially linked to the control of chondrocyte differentiation and/or functions (ZNF423, ZNF470, ZNF521, and ZNF780B) in chondrocytes from patients affected by OA and from subjects not affected by OA. This analysis highlighted a significantly lower expression of the transcript encoding ZNF423 in chondrocytes from OA, particularly in elderly patients. Interestingly, this decrease was mirrored by the similarly reduced expression of PPARγ, a known target of ZNF423 with anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective properties. The ZNF521 mRNA instead was abundant in all primary chondrocytes studied; the RNAi-mediated silencing of this gene significantly altered the COL2A/COL1 expression ratio, associated with the maintenance of the differentiated phenotype, in chondrocytes cultivated in alginate beads. These results suggest a role for ZNF423 and ZNF521 in the regulation of chondrocyte homeostasis and warrant further investigations to elucidate their mechanism of action. 
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a multifactorial disorder that results from an excessive inflammatory response. Secretory phospholipase A2-V (sPLA2-V) encoded by PLA2G5 gene promotes diverse proinflammatory processes. The aim of the present study was to analyze if PLA2G5 gene polymorphisms are associated with premature CAD. Three PLA2G5 polymorphisms (rs11573187, rs2148911, and rs11573191) were analyzed in 707 patients with premature CAD and 749 healthy controls. Haplotypes were constructed after linkage disequilibrium analysis. Under dominant, recessive, and additive models, the rs11573191 polymorphism was associated with increased risk of premature CAD (OR = 1.51, P(dom) = 3.5 × 10(-3); OR = 2.95, P(rec) = 0.023; OR = 1.51, P(add) = 1.2 × 10(-3)). According to the informatics software, this polymorphism had a functional effect modifying the affinity of the sequence by the MZF1 transcription factor. PLA2G5 polymorphisms were in linkage disequilibrium and the CGA haplotype was associated with increased risk of premature CAD (OR = 1.49, P = 0.0023) and with hypertension in these patients (OR = 1.75, P = 0.0072). Our results demonstrate the association of the PLA2G5 rs11573191 polymorphism with premature CAD. In our study, it was possible to distinguish one haplotype associated with increased risk of premature CAD and hypertension.
Liver kinase B1 (LKB1) loss in lung adenocarcinoma is commonly caused by genetic mutations, but these mutations rarely occur in Asian patients. We recently reported wild-type LKB1 loss via the alteration of NKX2-1/p53-axis-promoted tumor aggressiveness and predicted poor outcomes in cases of lung adenocarcinoma. The mechanistic action of wild-type LKB1 loss within tumor progression remains unknown. The suppression of MYC by LKB1 controls epithelial organization; therefore, we hypothesize that MYC expression can be increased via wild-type LKB1 loss and promotes tumor progression. Here, MYC transcription is upregulated by LKB1-loss-mediated MZF1 expression. The wild-type LKB1-loss-mediated MZF1/MYC axis is responsible for soft-agar growth, migration and invasion in lung adenocarcinoma cells. Moreover, wild-type LKB1 loss-induced cell invasiveness was markedly suppressed by MYC inhibitors (10058-F4 and JQ1). Patients with low-LKB1/high-MZF1 or low-LKB1/high-MYC tumors have shorter overall survival and relapse-free-survival periods than patients with high-LKB1/low-MZF1 or high-LKB1/low-MYC tumors. In summary, MZF1-mediated MYC expression may promote tumor progression, resulting in poor outcomes in cases of lung adenocarcinoma with low-wild-type-LKB1 tumors. 
Gastric cancer is a major health problem worldwide; it is the second most common cause of cancer death in the world. Recent studies indicate that the high-mobility group (HMG) of chromosomal proteins is associated with cancer progression. However, HMGB3 has been little studied. We analyzed the co-expression network between HMGB3 and differentially-expressed genes in the GSE17187 database, identifying the relevant transcription factors, and the conserved domain of HMGB3 to understand the underlying regulation mechanisms involved in gastric cancer. Thirty-one relationships between 11 differentially-expressed genes were included in a co-expression network; many of these genes have been identified as related to cancer, including TBX5 and TFR2. Further analysis identified nine transcription factors, these being GATA3, MZF1, GATA1, GATA2, SRY, REL, NFYB, NFYC, and NFYA, which could interact with HMGB3 to regulate target gene expression and consequently regulate gastric cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion. The HMG-box domain was very similar in various species, with only a few amino acid changes, indicating conserved functions in HMG-box. This information helps to provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of HMGB3 in human gastric cancer. 
The ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS5 are secreted proteases, which can cleave aggrecan, brevican and versican to regulate rebuilding of the extracellular matrix. We analyzed the ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS5 gene expression patterns in longissimus dorsi muscle at intervals from 135 days fetal age to 30 months old by qRT-PCR in Nanyang cattle. Expression of ADAMTS4 was significantly higher in 135 and 185-day-old fetuses than at other stages, while expression of ADAMTS5 decreased during development. The promoter regions of ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS5 were cloned and the transcription factor binding sites were analyzed with bioinformatic methods. Twelve and six potential transcription factor binding sites were found in the promoter regions of ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS5 genes, respectively. Three transcription factors (MZF1, C/EBPb, and NF-kap) were selected to analyze the expression pattern during the development of the longissimus dorsi muscle. MZF1 was significantly co-expressed with ADAMTS4, while C/EBPb expression was significantly negatively associated with that of ADAMTS4. We concluded that the expression of ADAMTS4 is positively regulated by MZF1 and negatively regulated by C/EBPb. We examined the relationships of ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS5 expression with tenderness of longissimus dorsi muscle; ADAMTS4 was significantly and negatively correlated with meat tenderness. We conclude that ADAMTS4 participates in the regulation of muscle development in cattle.
Across a variety of adverse life circumstances, such as social isolation and low socioeconomic status, mammalian immune cells have been found to show a conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA) involving increased expression of proinflammatory genes. The present study examines whether such effects might stem in part from the selective up-regulation of a subpopulation of immature proinflammatory monocytes (Ly-6c(high) in mice, CD16(-) in humans) within the circulating leukocyte pool. Transcriptome representation analyses showed relative expansion of the immature proinflammatory monocyte transcriptome in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from people subject to chronic social stress (low socioeconomic status) and mice subject to repeated social defeat. Cellular dissection of the mouse peripheral blood mononuclear cell transcriptome confirmed these results, and promoter-based bioinformatic analyses indicated increased activity of transcription factors involved in early myeloid lineage differentiation and proinflammatory effector function (PU.1, NF-κB, EGR1, MZF1, NRF2). Analysis of bone marrow hematopoiesis confirmed increased myelopoietic output of Ly-6c(high) monocytes and Ly-6c(intermediate) granulocytes in mice subject to repeated social defeat, and these effects were blocked by pharmacologic antagonists of β-adrenoreceptors and the myelopoietic growth factor GM-CSF. These results suggest that sympathetic nervous system-induced up-regulation of myelopoiesis mediates the proinflammatory component of the leukocyte CTRA dynamic and may contribute to the increased risk of inflammation-related disease associated with adverse social conditions. 
Human NK cells express cell surface class I MHC receptors (killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor, KIR) in a probabilistic manner. Previous studies have shown that a distal promoter acts in conjunction with a proximal bidirectional promoter to control the selective activation of KIR genes. We report here the presence of an intron 2 promoter in several KIR genes that produce a spliced antisense transcript. This long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) transcript contains antisense sequence complementary to KIR-coding exons 1 and 2 as well as the proximal promoter region of the KIR genes. The antisense promoter contains myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF-1)-binding sites, a transcription factor found in hematopoietic progenitors and myeloid precursors. The KIR antisense lncRNA was detected only in progenitor cells or pluripotent cell lines, suggesting a function that is specific for stem cells. Overexpression of MZF-1 in developing NK cells led to decreased KIR expression, consistent with a role for the KIR antisense lncRNA in silencing KIR gene expression early in development. 
Neuropathic pain is a refractory disease characterized by maladaptive changes in gene transcription and translation in the sensory pathway. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as new players in gene regulation, but how lncRNAs operate in the development of neuropathic pain is unclear. Here we identify a conserved lncRNA, named Kcna2 antisense RNA, for a voltage-dependent potassium channel mRNA, Kcna2, in first-order sensory neurons of rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Peripheral nerve injury increased Kcna2 antisense RNA expression in injured DRG through activation of myeloid zinc finger protein 1, a transcription factor that binds to the Kcna2 antisense RNA gene promoter. Mimicking this increase downregulated Kcna2, reduced total voltage-gated potassium current, increased excitability in DRG neurons and produced neuropathic pain symptoms. Blocking this increase reversed nerve injury-induced downregulation of DRG Kcna2 and attenuated development and maintenance of neuropathic pain. These findings suggest endogenous Kcna2 antisense RNA as a therapeutic target for the treatment of neuropathic pain. 
p55PIK, regulatory subunit of class IA phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), plays a crucial role in cell cycle progression by interaction with tumor repressor retinoblastoma (Rb) protein. A recent study showed that Rb protein can localize to the mitochondria in proliferative cells. Aberrant p55PIK expression may contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer progression. To reveal the mechanisms of p55PIK transcriptional regulation, the p55PIK promoter characteristics were analyzed. The data show that myeloid zinc finger 1, MZF1, is necessary for p55PIK gene transcription activation. ChIP (Chromatin immuno-precipitation) assay shows that MZF1 binds to the cis-element "TGGGGA" in p55PIK promoter. In MZF1 overexpressed cells, the promoter activity, expression of p55PIK, and cell proliferation rate were observed to be significantly enhanced. Whereas in MZF1-silenced cells, the promoter activity and expression of p55PIK and cell proliferation level was statistically decreased. In CRC tissues, MZF1 and p55PIK mRNA expression were increased (P = 0.046, P = 0.047, resp.). A strong positive correlation (Rs = 0.94) between MZF1 and p55PIK mRNA expression was observed. Taken together, we concluded that p55PIK is transcriptionally activated by MZF1, resulting in increased proliferation of colorectal cancer cells.
Our previous works showed that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes with regulatory function upon inflammatory response and cholesterol metabolism were associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. The list comprises SNPs located on the promoters of alpha 1 antichymotrypsin (rs1884082), hydroxy methyl glutaryl coenzime A reductase (rs376140), tumor necrosis factor alpha (rs1800629), and interleukin 10 (rs1800869). Here we investigated the effect of these SNPs on the binding for transcription factors. We computationally detected putative binding sites for transcription factors located in the SNP regions. To this aim, the TESS program for scanning the promoter sequences against the binding-site models available at TRANSFACT and JASPAR databases was adopted. All the analyzed SNPs appeared to affect the binding of myeloid zinc finger protein 1 (MZF-1) to the promoter sequence of the above reported genes. Therefore 16 SNPs in MZF-1 gene were tested in 120 AD cases and 88 controls to asses a possible association between MZF-1 and AD. 14 SNPs showed no variability in AD and control populations, while two SNPs rs4756 and rs2228162 showed the three genotypes. Genotype distributions and allele frequencies of these two SNPs were comparable between AD and controls. On the other hand, the haplotype distribution of rs4756 and rs2228162 was different between AD and controls; being the AG haplotype associated with a decreased AD risk. In conclusion, selected SNPs in MZF-1 gene exert a minor effect on AD risk.
L-selectin plays important roles in lymphocyte homing and leukocyte rolling. Mounting evidence shows that it is involved in many disease entities including diabetes, ischemia/reperfusion injuries, inflammatory diseases, and tumor metastasis. Regulation of L-selectin at protein level has been well characterized. However, the regulation of human L-selectin transcription remains largely unknown. To address transcriptional regulation of L-selectin, we cloned 1088 bp 5' of the start codon ATG. Luciferase analysis of the serial 5' deletion mutants located the core promoter region at -288/-1. A major transcription initiation site was mapped at -115 by 5'RACE. Transcription factors Sp1, Ets1, Mzf1, Klf2, and Irf1 bind to and transactivate the L-selectin promoter. Significantly, FOXO1 binds to a FOXO1 motif, CCCTTTGG, at -87/-80, and transactivates the L-selectin promoter in a dose-dependent manner. Over-expression of a constitutive-active FOXO1 increased the endogenous L-selectin expression in Jurkat cells. We conclude that FOXO1 regulates L-selectin expression through targeting its promoter.
Myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1) gene belongs to the Kruppel family of zinc finger transcription factors. MZF1 has been suggested to play an important role in the tumorigenesis, invasion, and apoptosis of various tumor cells. However, the role of MZF1 in human cervical cancer remains unclear. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of MZF1 and its functional role in human cervical cancer cell migration and invasion, we experimented on stable SiHa cells overexpressing MZF1. We found that MZF1 overexpression inhibits the migratory and invasive abilities of SiHa cervical cancer cells. In addition, the overexpression of MZF1 significantly reduces MMP-2 protein and mRNA levels. Luciferase and ChIP assays suggested that MZF1 directly binds to MMP-2 gene regulatory sequences in vivo and suppresses MMP-2 promoter activity in vitro. This study shows that MZF-1 represses MMP-2 transcription and suggests that this repression may be linked to inhibition of human cervical cancer cell migration and metastasis.
In a recent study on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we have shown that the transcription factors Myeloid Zinc Finger-1 (MZF-1) and Ets-like-protein 1 (Elk-1) are significantly related to protein kinase C alpha (PKCα) expression. The purpose of this study was to determine the correlation of the expression of PKCα with the expression of Elk-1 and MZF-1 in various differentiated urinary bladder transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) cell lines: 5637, BFTC905, TSGH8301, HT1376 and HT1197 cells. The malignant potential in the five TCC cell lines was examined by using cell proliferation/migration/invasion assay and the protein and mRNA levels of PKCα, ElK-1 and MZF-1 were examined by Western blot and RT-PCR analysis. The results showed that the rate of cell proliferation in the TSGH8301 cell line was higher than that in other cell lines, while there were obvious signs of cell migration and invasion in 5637, BFTC905 and HT1376 cells, and no sign in TSGH8301 and HT1197 cells. The resulting expression levels of Elk-1 and PKCα were the highest in 5637 cells, but the MZF-1 expression observed in all five cell lines showed no significant difference. To determine whether a correlation exists between PKCα and Elk-1, a shRNA knockout assay was performed and the results showed that the reduction of Elk-1 expression in 5637 cells did not result in the decreased PKCα expression. Therefore, although the findings showed elevated expression of Elk-1 and PKCα in 5637 cells, the regulator of PKCα in bladder cancer cells is yet to be determined.
IL12B encodes the p40 subunit of IL-12, which is also part of IL-23. Recent genome-wide association studies identified IL12B and IL23R as susceptibility genes for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the phenotypic effects and potential gene-gene interactions of IL12B variants are largely unknown.
We analyzed IL12B gene variants regarding association with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Genomic DNA from 2196 individuals including 913 CD patients, 318 UC patients and 965 healthy, unrelated controls was analyzed for four SNPs in the IL12B gene region (rs3212227, rs17860508, rs10045431, rs6887695). Our analysis revealed an association of the IL12B SNP rs6887695 with susceptibility to IBD (p = 0.035; OR 1.15 [95% CI 1.01-1.31] including a trend for rs6887695 for association with CD (OR 1.41; [0.99-1.31], p = 0.066) and UC (OR 1.18 [0.97-1.43], p = 0.092). CD patients, who were homozygous C/C carriers of this SNP, had significantly more often non-stricturing, non-penetrating disease than carriers of the G allele (p = 6.8×10(-5); OR = 2.84, 95% CI 1.66-4.84), while C/C homozygous UC patients had less often extensive colitis than G allele carriers (p = 0.029; OR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.14-0.92). In silico analysis predicted stronger binding of the minor C allele of rs6887695 to the transcription factor RORα which is involved in Th17 differentiation. Differences regarding the binding to the major and minor allele sequence of rs6887695 were also predicted for the transcription factors HSF1, HSF2, MZF1 and Oct-1. Epistasis analysis revealed weak epistasis of the IL12B SNP rs6887695 with several SNPs (rs11889341, rs7574865, rs7568275, rs8179673, rs10181656, rs7582694) in the STAT4 gene which encodes the major IL-12 downstream transcription factor STAT4 (p&lt;0.05) but there was no epistasis between IL23R and IL12B variants.
The IL12B SNP rs6887695 modulates the susceptibility and the phenotype of IBD, although the effect on IBD susceptibilty is less pronounced than that of IL23R gene variants.
Aberrant ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase activation in breast cancer is strongly linked to an invasive disease. The molecular basis of ErbB2-driven invasion is largely unknown. We show that cysteine cathepsins B and L are elevated in ErbB2 positive primary human breast cancer and function as effectors of ErbB2-induced invasion in vitro. We identify Cdc42-binding protein kinase beta, extracellular regulated kinase 2, p21-activated protein kinase 4, and protein kinase C alpha as essential mediators of ErbB2-induced cysteine cathepsin expression and breast cancer cell invasiveness. The identified signaling network activates the transcription of cathepsin B gene (CTSB) via myeloid zinc finger-1 transcription factor that binds to an ErbB2-responsive enhancer element in the first intron of CTSB. This work provides a model system for ErbB2-induced breast cancer cell invasiveness, reveals a signaling network that is crucial for invasion in vitro, and defines a specific role and targets for the identified serine-threonine kinases.
SERPINA3 (Serpin peptidase inhibitor clade A member 3), also known as a1-antichymotrypsin, is a serine protease inhibitor involved in a wide range of biological processes. Recently, it has been shown to be up-regulated in human placental diseases in association with a hypomethylation of the 5' region of the gene. In the present study, we show that the promoter of SERPINA3 is transcriptionally activated by three transcription factors (TFs) (SP1, MZF1 and ZBTB7B), the level of induction being dependent on the rs1884082 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located inside the promoter, the T allele being consistently induced to a higher level than the G, with or without added TFs. When the promoter was methylated, the response to ZBTB7B was allele specific (the G allele was strongly induced, while the T allele was strongly down-regulated). We propose an adaptive model to explain the interest of such a regulation for placental function and homeostasis. Overexpression of SERPINA3 in JEG-3 cells, a trophoblast cell model, decreased cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix and to neighboring cells, but protects them from apoptosis, suggesting a way by which this factor could be deleterious at high doses. In addition, we show in different human populations that the T allele appears to predispose to Intra Uterine Growth Restriction (IUGR), while a G allele at a second SNP located in the second exon (rs4634) increases the risk of preeclampsia. Our results provide mechanistic views inside the involvement of SERPINA3 in placental diseases, through its regulation by a combination of epigenetic, genetic and TF-mediated regulations.
Recently, our research into hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has shown that the transcription factors Myeloid Zinc Finger-1 (MZF-1) and Ets-like-protein 1 are related to protein kinase C alpha (PKCα) expression. The purpose of this study was to determine the correlation of the expression of PKCαwith the expressions of Elk-1 and MZF-1 in various differentiated breast cancer cell lines: MDA- MB-231, Hs57BT, SKBR3, MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7. The malignant potential in the five lines of breast cancer cells was examined by using a cell proliferation/migration/invasion assay and the protein and mRNA levels of PKCα, ElK-1 and MZF-1 were examined by Western blot and RT-PCR analysis, re- spectively. The results showed that there were obvious signs of migration and invasion of cells in MDA- MB-231 and Hs57BT cells, little signs of cell migration and invasion in MDA-MB-468 cells, and no sign in SKBR3 and MCF-7 cells. Moreover, the highest expression levels of PKCα, Elk-1 and MZF-1 were also observed in MDA-MB-231 and Hs57BT cells when compared to the other breast cancer cell lines. These findings confirm that elevated expression of PKCαin breast cancer cells may be correlated with the potential of cell migration and invasion, and suggest an association between the expression of PKCα and the expression of the transcription factors Elk-1 and MZF-1.
We investigated associations of early pregnancy maternal peripheral blood gene expression with preeclampsia. In a nested case control study, gene expression of peripheral blood, collected at 16weeks of gestation on average from 16 women destined to develop preeclampsia and 16 women who had normotensive pregnancies was profiled using Affymetrix GeneChip Arrays. Fold change and Student's T-test analyses were used to compare differential gene expression across the groups. Functions and functional relationships as well as common regulatory sequences of differentially expressed genes were investigated. Genes participating in abnormal placentation (e.g COL1A1), immune/inflammation response (e.g. IKBKB) and cellular development (including cell cycle) (e.g. RBI) were differentially expressed in early pregnancy peripheral blood in preeclampsia. We identified transcription factors (i.e. Sp1, MAZ and MZF1) that may account for co-expression of differentially expressed genes. Preeclampsia is associated with differential gene expression in early pregnancy peripheral blood.
Loss-of-function mutation in the profilaggrin gene is a major risk factor for atopic dermatitis (AD). Previously, we showed that a neutral cysteine protease, bleomycin hydrolase (BH), has a role in generating natural moisturizing factors, and calpain I is an upstream protease in the filaggrin degradation pathway. Here, we investigated the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of BH and the relevance of BH to AD. First, we cloned the 5'-flanking region of BH. Deletion analyses identified a critical region for BH promoter activity within -216 bp upstream. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that MZF-1, Sp-1, and interferon regulatory factor-1/2 could bind to this region in vitro. Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis of the MZF-1 and Sp-1 motifs markedly reduced BH promoter activity. These data indicate that BH expression is up-regulated via MZF-1 and Sp-1. Interestingly, a Th1 cytokine, IFN-γ, significantly reduced the expression of BH. Analyses with site-directed mutagenesis and small interference RNA supported the suppressing effect of IFN-γ on BH expression. On the other hand, a Th2 cytokine, IL-4, did not show any direct effect on BH expression. However, it down-regulated MZF-1 and Sp-1 in cultured keratinocytes, indicating that IL-4 could work as a suppressor in BH regulation. Lastly, we examined expression of BH in skins of patients with AD. BH activity and expression were markedly decreased in AD lesional skin, suggesting a defect of the filaggrin degradation pathway in AD. Our results suggest that BH transcription would be modulated during both differentiation and inflammation.
Tescalcin, an EF-hand calcium binding protein that regulates the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 1 (NHE1), is highly expressed in various mouse tissues such as heart and brain. Despite its potentially important role in cell physiology, the mechanisms that regulate tescalcin gene (Tesc) expression are unknown. In this study, we report two new Tesc mRNA variants (V2 and V3) and characterize the mouse Tesc promoter. The V2 and V3 transcripts result from alternative splicing of intron 5. Our results show that Tesc mRNA variants are expressed in various mouse tissues. Primer extension analysis located the transcription start site at 94 nucleotides upstream of the translation start codon. The DNA nucleotide sequence of the 5'-flanking region contained a CpG island spanning the promoter region from nucleotides -372 to +814, a canonical TATA box (-38/-32), and putative transcription factor binding sites for Sp1, EGR1, ZBP-89, KLF3, MZF1, AP2, ZF5, and CDF-1. Transient transfection of the Y1 and msc-1 cell lines with a series of 5'-deleted promoter constructs indicated that the minimal promoter region was between nucleotides -130 and -40. Electrophoresis mobility shift assays, supershift assays, and mutation studies demonstrated that Sp1 and Sp3 bind to the GC-rich motifs, a CACCC box and three GC boxes, located within the Tesc proximal promoter. Nonetheless, mutations that abolished interaction of Sp1 and Sp3 with the GC-rich motifs located within the minimal promoter region did not abrogate promoter activity in Y1 cells. Mithramycin A, an inhibitor of Sp1-DNA interaction, reduced Tesc promoter activity in msc-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Sp3 was a weaker transactivator compared to Sp1 in Drosophila D.mel-2 cells. However, when Sp1 and Sp3 were coexpressed, they transactivated the Tesc promoter in a synergistic manner. In Y1 cells, mutation analysis of a putative ZF5 motif located within the Tesc minimal promoter indicated that this motif was critical for activity of Tesc promoter. Taken together, the data demonstrated that Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors cooperate positively in the regulation of Tesc promoter, and that the putative ZF5 motif is critical for its activation.
Human bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (hBMSC) have been shown to participate in malignant transformation. However, hampered by the low frequency of malignant transformation of hBMSC, we do not yet know how to prevent malignant transformation of implanted hBMSC. In this study, in order to establish a model for the eradication of hBMSC-derived malignant cells, a gene fusion consisting of a human telomerase (hTERT) promoter modified with both c-Myc and myeloid zinc finger protein2 (MZF-2) binding elements and followed by the E. coli cytosine deaminase (CD) and luciferase genes was stably transferred into hBMSC via lentiviral transduction; n-phosphonacelyl-L-aspartic acid (PALA) selection was used to generate malignant cell colonies derived from transduced hBMSC after treatment with the carcinogenic reagent BPDE. Cells that were amplified after PALA selection were used for transplantation and 5-FC pro-drug cytotoxicity tests. The results showed that PALA-resistant malignant cells could be generated from hBMSC co-induced with lentiviral transduction and treatment with Benzo(a)pyrene Diol Epoxide (BPDE); the modification of c-Myc and MZF-2 binding elements could remarkably enhance the transcriptional activities of the hTERT promoter in malignant cells, whereas transcriptional activity was depressed in normal hBMSC; malignant cells stably expressing CD under the control of the modified hTERT promoter could be eliminated by 5-FC administration. This study has provided a method for targeted eradication of malignant cells derived from hBMSC.
Myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1) is a member of the SCAN domain family transcription factors that form dimers through their highly conserved SCAN motifs. Silencing of MZF1 inhibits cell proliferation, and abnormal expression of MZF1 results in cancer development. However, a potential role of MZF1 in metastasis remains unclear. Axl is a receptor tyrosine kinase and was first identified as a transforming gene in chronic myeloid leukemia. Axl overexpression induces proliferation, migration, and invasion and is highly expressed in different human cancers. In this study, we show that overexpression of MZF1 induces migration and invasion in colorectal (Rko, SW480) and cervical (HeLa) cancer cells. In addition, we show that MZF1 binds to the Axl promoter, transactivates promoter activity, and enhances Axl-mRNA and protein expression in a dose-dependent manner. In vitro, sh-RNA knockdown of Axl reduced MZF1-induced migration and invasion in HeLa and Rko cells (P = 0.05). Additionally, Rko cells overexpressing MZF1 showed increased tumor formation and liver metastasis in the chicken-embryo-metastasis assay in vivo. Furthermore, the expression of MZF1 and Axl was significantly higher in resected colorectal tumors compared with corresponding normal tissues (P = 0.02; P = 0.05), and MZF1 expression was positively correlated with Axl gene expression in tumor tissues (P &lt; 0.01). Taken together, this is the first study to show that MZF1 induces invasion and in vivo metastasis in colorectal and cervical cancer, at least in part by regulating Axl gene expression.
DNA triplexes can naturally occur, co-localize and interact with many other regulatory DNA elements (e.g. G-quadruplex (G4) DNA motifs), specific DNA-binding proteins (e.g. transcription factors (TFs)), and micro-RNA (miRNA) precursors. Specific genome localizations of triplex target DNA sites (TTSs) may cause abnormalities in a double-helix DNA structure and can be directly involved in some human diseases. However, genome localization of specific TTSs, their interconnection with regulatory DNA elements and physiological roles in a cell are poor defined. Therefore, it is important to identify comprehensive and reliable catalogue of specific potential TTSs (pTTSs) and their co-localization patterns with other regulatory DNA elements in the human genome.
"TTS mapping" database is a web-based search engine developed here, which is aimed to find and annotate pTTSs within a region of interest of the human genome. The engine provides descriptive statistics of pTTSs in a given region and its sequence context. Different annotation tracks of TTS-overlapping gene region(s), G4 motifs, CpG Island, miRNA precursors, miRNA targets, transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNA), and repeat elements are also mapped based onto a sequence location provided by UCSC genome browser, G4 database http://www.quadruplex.org and several other datasets. The results pages provide links to UCSC genome browser annotation tracks and relative DBs. BLASTN program was included to check the uniqueness of a given pTTS in the human genome. Recombination- and mutation-prone genes (e.g. EVI-1, MYC) were found to be significantly enriched by TTSs and multiple co-occurring with our regulatory DNA elements. TTS mapping reveals that a high-complementary and evolutionarily conserved polypurine and polypyrimidine DNA sequence pair linked by a non-conserved short DNA sequence can form miR-483 transcribed from intron 2 of IGF2 gene and bound double-strand nucleic acid TTSs forming natural triplex structures.
TTS mapping provides comprehensive visual and analytical tools to help users to find pTTSs, G-quadruplets and other regulatory DNA elements in various genome regions. TTS Mapping not only provides sequence visualization and statistical information, but also integrates knowledge about co-localization TTS with various DNA elements and facilitates that data analysis. In particular, TTS Mapping reveals complex structural-functional regulatory module of gene IGF2 including TF MZF1 binding site and ncRNA precursor mir-483 formed by the high-complementary and evolutionarily conserved polypurine- and polypyrimidine-rich DNA pair. Such ncRNAs capable of forming helical triplex structures with a polypurine strand of a nucleic acid duplexes (DNA or RNA) via Hoogsteen or reverse Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds. Our web tool could be used to discover biologically meaningful genome modules and to optimize experimental design of anti-gene treatment.
Apomorphine (APO), a potent D1/D2 dopamine receptor agonist, is used as an anti-parkinsonian drug. It stimulates the synthesis and release of multiple trophic factors in mesencephalic and striatal neurons, preventing the loss of dopaminergic neurons in vitro. Furthermore, APO enhances the biosynthesis and release of FGF-2 by activating dopamine receptors in striatal astrocytes, where cAMP/PKA and PKC/MAPK signalling cascades mediate this process. We investigate the effects of APO on the fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) promoter and its regulation in astrocytes and identify the transcription factor and cis element underlying these effects. In screening for cis-acting elements over the entire region of the FGF-2 promoter stimulated by APO in the astrocytes, a sequence located in the -785/-745 region was found to serve as the cis element. This element was recognized by the human myeloid zinc finger protein 1 (MZF-1) transcription factor. Introducing human MZF-1 plasmid and human MZF-1-specific siRNA has different effects on the FGF-2 promoter. Furthermore, it increases FGF-2 protein expression in HeLa cells and primary astrocytes, indicating that APO stimulates the FGF-2 promoter via the MZF-1 transcription factor. These data suggest that APO can enhance the biosynthesis and release of FGF-2 through the activation of the MZF-1 transcription factor in striatal astrocytes.
The heme-regulated eIF-2alpha kinase, also called the heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI), is activated under various cytoplasmic stresses in reticulocytes leading to inhibition of initiation of protein synthesis. Our previous studies indicated that the promoter activity and expression of the human HRI (hHRI) increase in human K562 cells during heat shock and lead exposure. Contrary to this, hemin chloride which inactivates the kinase, downregulates HRI expression. Here, we attempted to understand the mechanism of regulation of hHRI expression in the lead- and hemin-exposed cells. Our results demonstrate the involvement of two transcription factors, Elk-1 and MZF-1 in regulating HRI expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays established further that Elk-1 is involved in upregulating HRI expression during stress along with a co-activator p300, while MZF-1 along with HDAC-1 is instrumental in its downregulation during hemin treatment. We also demonstrate the involvement of ERK pathway in activating Elk-1 during stress resulting in an over expression of hHRI.
L-selectin mediates the initial tethering and rolling of lymphocytes in high endothelial venules. To study the transcriptional regulation of mouse L-selectin, we cloned 4.5 kb 5'-flanking sequences of the mouse sell. Luciferase analysis of serial 5'-deletion mutants showed that the first 285 bp was sufficient to drive high promoter activity in EL4 cells, but not in Sell-negative HeLa cells, suggesting that this fragment harbors the minimal mouse sell promoter and contains cis-elements for lymphocyte-specific expression. Site-directed mutagenesis and chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that Mzf1, Klf2, Sp1, Ets1, and Irf1 bind to and activate the mouse sell promoter. Over expression of these transcription factors in EL4 cells increased expression of sell mRNA. Silencing the expression of Sp1 by siRNA significantly decreased sell promoter activity in EL4 cells. We conclude that sell transcription is regulated by Mzf1, Klf2, Sp1, Ets1, and Irf1.
Plexin B3 is a neurally expressed transmembrane receptor protein participating in growth cone remodelling and synaptic plasticity. Despite their biological importance no plexin promoter has been characterized so far. Regulation of mouse plexin B3 transcription was investigated using in silico analysis of promoter and inititation area, 5'RACE, reporter-gene assays, gelshift and co-expression experiments. As a result we have described a novel 5' exon and show that a 234 basepair region upstream of it exhibits promoter activity. Further analysis indicated that this region contains predicted binding sites for myeloid zinc finger protein 1 (MZF-1) and neurogenin 3 (Ngn3). Oligonucleotides corresponding to the recognition sequences of these factors produced a specific mobility shift in EMSA. Expression of the reporter gene attached to the 234 region was increased 2-fold by Ngn3 and reduced twice in response to MZF-1 over-expression. These results help to better comprehend mechanisms used for plexin B3 transcriptional regulation.
RUSH/SMARCA3 (SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin subfamily A, member 3) is capable of sequence-selective DNA binding and ATP-dependent DNA unwinding. In rabbit uterine epithelial cells, RUSH-1alpha (113 kDa) is the progesterone-dependent splice variant and RUSH-1beta (95 kDa) is the oestrogen-dependent splice variant. Rabbit RUSH/SMARCA3 mRNA is primarily regulated at the proximal promoter (-162/+90) via a PRE (progesterone-response element) half-site/overlapping Y-box domain (-38/-26) and two Sp (specificity protein) 3 sites centred at -128 and -58. We investigated hormone regulation by exploring binding of transcription factors to a putative RUSH/SMARCA3 site (-616/-611) and the distal Sp3 (-131/-126) site. In response to progesterone, RUSH-1alpha binds the RUSH site and the Sp3 site becomes a functional binding site for Egr-1 (early growth-response gene product 1)/Sp (specificity protein)1/3/MAZ (Myc-associated zinc-finger protein)/MZF1 (myeloid zinc finger 1)/c-Rel. TransSignal TF-TF Interaction Arrays, supershift assays and ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) analyses confirmed strong physical interactions between RUSH and Egr-1/c-Rel. Higher-order long-range interactions between RUSH and the Egr-1/c-Rel derivative of the anisotropic flexibility of the intervening DNA sequence were shown with 3C (chromosome conformation capture) assays. Transient transfection assays with mutant constructs showed the co-operative interaction between RUSH and Egr-1 mediates repression by c-Rel. Thus DNA-bound RUSH/SMARCA3 communicates with its own proximal promoter by looping the intervening DNA. Moreover, progesterone-dependent DNA looping is an adjunct to progesterone induction of the RUSH/SMARCA3 gene because the availability of RUSH isoforms and relevant binding partners is progesterone-regulated.
The transcriptional regulator c-Myc is the most frequently deregulated oncogene in human tumors. Targeted overexpression of this gene in mice results in distinct types of lung adenocarcinomas. By using microarray technology, alterations in the expression of genes were captured based on a female transgenic mouse model in which, indeed, c-Myc overexpression in alveolar epithelium results in the development of bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma (BAC) and papillary adenocarcinoma (PLAC). In this study, we analyzed exclusively the promoters of induced genes by different in silico methods in order to elucidate the c-Myc transcriptional regulatory network.
We analyzed the promoters of 361 transcriptionally induced genes with respect to c-Myc binding sites and found 110 putative binding sites in 94 promoters. Furthermore, we analyzed the flanking sequences (+/- 100 bp) around the 110 c-Myc binding sites and found Ap2, Zf5, Zic3, and E2f binding sites to be overrepresented in these regions. Then, we analyzed the promoters of 361 induced genes with respect to binding sites of other transcription factors (TFs) which were upregulated by c-Myc overexpression. We identified at least one binding site of at least one of these TFs in 220 promoters, thus elucidating a potential transcription factor network. The analysis correlated well with the significant overexpression of the TFs Atf2, Foxf1a, Smad4, Sox4, Sp3 and Stat5a. Finally, we analyzed promoters of regulated genes which where apparently not regulated by c-Myc or other c-Myc targeted TFs and identified overrepresented Oct1, Mzf1, Ppargamma, Plzf, Ets, and HmgIY binding sites when compared against control promoter background.
Our in silico data suggest a model of a transcriptional regulatory network in which different TFs act in concert upon c-Myc overexpression. We determined molecular rules for transcriptional regulation to explain, in part, the carcinogenic effect seen in mice overexpressing the c-Myc oncogene.
Myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1) is a transcription factor that plays an important role in blood cell development. Previous reports indicate MZF1 is an essential factor whose abnormal expression results in cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms by which MZF1 functions in development and contributes to cancer progression remain unknown. MZF1 is a member of the SCAN domain family of zinc finger proteins (SCAN-ZFP) that form dimers via their highly conserved SCAN motif. To better understand the molecular mechanism of MZF1 function, we sought to characterize the cellular localization pattern of MZF1 in the context of SCAN dimerization. Here we provide evidence that MZF1 is a constituent of promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) and that the SCAN domain is necessary for association with these intranuclear structures. In addition, the SCAN-ZFP member ZNF24 was identified as a novel heterodimeric partner of MZF1 that also associates with PML-NBs in a unique ring-type pattern. Finally, we provide support that MZF1 protein may be modified by SUMOylation, which provides further support for localization of MZF1 protein complexes to PML-NBs. Altogether, these data suggest that MZF1 is recruited to PML-NBs and that the SCAN domain may play an integral role in regulating the localization of heterodimeric protein complexes to these intranuclear structures.
Many macrophage-specific promoters lack classical transcriptional start site elements such as TATA boxes and Sp1 sites. One example is the CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R, CD115, c-fms), which is used as a model of the transcriptional regulation of macrophage genes. To understand the molecular basis of start site recognition in this gene, we identified cellular proteins binding specifically to the transcriptional start site (TSS) region. The mouse and human csf1r TSS were identified using cap analysis gene expression (CAGE) data. Conserved elements flanking the TSS cluster were analyzed using EMSAs to identify discrete DNA-binding factors in primary bone marrow macrophages as candidate transcriptional regulators. Two complexes were identified that bind in a highly sequence-specific manner to the mouse and human TSS proximal region and also to high-affinity sites recognized by myeloid zinc finger protein 1 (Mzf1). The murine proteins were purified by DNA affinity isolation from the RAW264.7 macrophage cell line and identified by mass spectrometry as EWS and FUS/TLS, closely related DNA and RNA-binding proteins. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments in bone marrow macrophages confirmed that EWS, but not FUS/TLS, was present in vivo on the CSF-1R proximal promoter in unstimulated primary macrophages. Transfection assays suggest that EWS does not act as a conventional transcriptional activator or repressor. We hypothesize that EWS contributes to start site recognition in TATA-less mammalian promoters.
Although early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is considered a potentially curable disease following complete resection, patients have a wide spectrum of survival according to stage (IB, II, IIIA). Within each stage, gene expression profiles can identify patients with a higher risk of recurrence. We hypothesized that altered mRNA expression in nine genes could help to predict disease outcome: excision repair cross-complementing 1 (ERCC1), myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1) and Twist1 (which regulate N-cadherin expression), ribonucleotide reductase subunit M1 (RRM1), thioredoxin-1 (TRX1), tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase (Tdp1), nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), BRCA1, and the human homolog of yeast budding uninhibited by benzimidazole (BubR1).
We performed real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-QPCR) in frozen lung cancer tissue specimens from 126 chemonaive NSCLC patients who had undergone surgical resection and evaluated the association between gene expression levels and survival. For validation, we used paraffin-embedded specimens from 58 other NSCLC patients. A strong inter-gene correlation was observed between expression levels of all genes except NFAT. A Cox proportional hazards model indicated that along with disease stage, BRCA1 mRNA expression significantly correlated with overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.98 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.11-6]; P = 0.02). In the independent cohort of 58 patients, BRCA1 mRNA expression also significantly correlated with survival (HR, 2.4 [95%CI, 1.01-5.92]; P = 0.04).
Overexpression of BRCA1 mRNA was strongly associated with poor survival in NSCLC patients, and the validation of this finding in an independent data set further strengthened this association. Since BRCA1 mRNA expression has previously been linked to differential sensitivity to cisplatin and antimicrotubule drugs, BRCA1 mRNA expression may provide additional information for customizing adjuvant antimicrotubule-based chemotherapy, especially in stage IB, where the role of adjuvant chemotherapy has not been clearly demonstrated.
Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) catalyze the conversion of protein-bound arginine residues into citrulline residues in a calcium-dependent manner. The PAD1 gene (PADI1) is expressed in a few tissues, including the epidermis, where the protein is detected with a higher level in the more differentiated keratinocytes. Using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR experiments, we show that PADI1 mRNAs are more abundant in keratinocytes cultured with 1.2 than 0.15 mM calcium. We cloned and characterized the promoter region using human keratinocytes transfected with variously deleted fragments of the 5'-upstream region of PADI1 coupled to the luciferase gene. We found that as few as 195 bp upstream from the transcription initiation site were sufficient to direct transcription of the reporter gene. Mutations of MZF1- or Sp1-binding sites markedly reduced PADI1 promoter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that MZF1 and Sp1/Sp3 bind to this region in vivo. Furthermore, MZF1 or Sp1 small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) effectively diminished PADI1 expression in keratinocytes cultured in both low- and high-calcium-containing medium. In addition, the expression of MZF1 and PAD1 increased in parallel when normal human epidermal keratinocytes underwent differentiation. These data indicate that MZF1 and Sp1/Sp3 binding to the promoter region drive the PADI1 expression.
Our previous studies have found that reducing expression of myeloid zinc finger-1 (MZF-1) inhibited protein kinase C alpha (PKCalpha) expression and decreased cell migration and invasion in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we further investigated the role of MZF-1 in tumorigenesis. The SK-Hep-1 HCC cells were transfected with the antisense oligonucleotide (ODN) of MZF-1. The pretreated cells was then detected the mRNA and protein levels by RT-PCR and western blotting, and the cell growth was assayed by MTT. Meanwhile, the pretreated-SK-Hep-1 HCC cells were implanted subcutaneously into nude mice to observe the tumor growth and calculated tumor inhibitory rate. The results showed that, at the dosage of 5 microM, the antisense ODN MZF-1 suppressed both MZF-1 and PKCalpha productions by SK-Hep-1 HCC cells after cationic liposome-mediated transfection, to 15% and 30% in control cultures of 0 microM dosage, respectively. The growth of SK-Hep-1 HCC cells was inhibited by the 2-5 microM doses of the antisense ODN MZF-1, whereas the control reagent, the sense ODN MZF-1, showed no effects. In BALB/nude mice, SK-Hep-1 HCC cells pretreated with the 5 microM antisense ODN MZF-1 formed tumors much smaller than the cells with sense ODN. The mean of inhibitory rate of tumor growth was 71.2 +/- 8.6%, and the tumor formation time was prolonged from 14 days to 26 days. These findings suggested the usefulness of antisense ODN MZF-1 as a new reagent for cancer therapy.
The uncoupling protein family is a mitochondrial anion carrier family. It plays an important role in the biological traits of animal body weight, basal metabolic rate and energy conversion. Using PCR and PCR-SSCP, we scanned the porcine uncoupling protein 2 gene (UCP2) and uncoupling protein 3 gene (UCP3) and found seven deletion sites, three in UCP2 and four in UCP3. The deletions in 15 pig breeds showed that deletion influenced weight. The genotype compounding of seven deletion sites in 15 pig breeds had significant effects on performance traits of the pig, such as body weight. We predicted the potential protein factor binding sites using the transcription factor analysis tool TFSearch version 1.3 online. Two deletions (1830 nt and 3219 nt) in UCP3 were found to change the transcriptional factor sites. The 16 bp deletion in 1830 nt added a SP1 site and a 6 bp deletion in 3219 nt removed two MZF1 sites. Seven deletion polymorphisms were covered in introns of linkage genes of UCP2 and UCP3, showing that UCPs have conservation and genetic reliability.
The beta-chain of the high-affinity receptor for IgE (FcepsilonRI) plays an important role in regulating activation of FcepsilonRI-expressing cells such as mast cells in allergic reactions. We already reported that the transcription factor myeloid zinc finger (MZF) 1 which formed a high m.w. complex including four and a half LIM-only protein (FHL)3 in the nucleus repressed human beta-chain gene expression through an element in the fourth intron. We also found that GM-CSF induced expression of MZF-1 and nuclear translocation of FHL3. We screened a human cDNA library and identified NFY which was reported to bind histone deacetylases (HDACs) as a constituent of the complex. The C-subunit of NFY was demonstrated to form a ternary complex with MZF-1/FHL3 and interact with a beta-chain gene region including the element in the fourth intron. HDAC1 and HDAC2 were also shown to interact with the fourth intron region of the beta-chain gene. In a human mast cell line HMC-1 cultured with GM-CSF, both beta-chain expression and acetylation of histones interacting with the fourth intron region of the beta-chain gene were decreased. Collectively, these results indicated that HDACs, which were recruited to the beta-chain gene through the element in the fourth intron by MZF-1/FHL3/NFY, repressed beta-chain gene transcription by deacetylation of histones in the presence of GM-CSF. These mechanisms will be involved in not only the cell type-specific repression of beta-chain gene expression in differentiating hemopoietic cells but also the repression of beta-chain gene expression in the peripheral cells under specific circumstances.
The SCAN domain mediates interactions between members of a subfamily of zinc-finger transcription factors and is found in more than 60 C2H2 zinc finger genes in the human genome, including the tumor suppressor gene myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1). Glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assays showed that the MZF1 SCAN domain self-associates, and a Kd value of 600 nM was measured by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence polarization. The MZF1 structure determined by NMR spectroscopy revealed a domain-swapped dimer. Each monomer consists of five alpha helices in two subdomains connected by the alpha2-alpha3 loop. Residues from helix 3 of each monomer compose the core of the dimer interface, while the alpha1-alpha2 loop and helix 2 pack against helices 3 and 5 from the opposing monomer. Comprehensive sequence analysis is coupled with the first high-resolution structure of a SCAN dimer to provide an initial view of the recognition elements that govern dimerization for this large family of transcription factors.
The mu-opioid receptor (MOR1) is a target of endogenous and exogenous opioids and plays a pivotal role for anesthesia and analgesia. Variations in the 5' flanking sequence of the mu-opioid receptor gene may influence transcriptional regulation and ultimately alter protein expression of MOR1. In the present study we investigated the influence of eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) within the mu-opioid receptor promoter on promoter activity and evaluated the frequencies of the relevant SNPs in 700 patients under opioid medication. Reporter-gene-constructs were created by means of PCR and site directed mutagenesis, testing eight SNPs previously described. The neuroblastoma cell line SHSY5Y was used for transfection and promoter activity was estimated by luciferase activity. Of the eight reporter gene constructs employed to test genomic variations, two produced a significant change in luciferase activity when compared to wild-type constructs. The G-554A variation located within a known NFkB binding element resulted in a decreased activity whereas the A/G base exchange at position -1320 showed an increased luciferase activity. This particular variant generated a myeloid zinc finger (MZF1) cis-acting element known to impact transcription. The allele frequency of the -1320G variant was 0.21% in 700 Caucasian patients under opioid medication in contrast to 9.1% reported previously in drug addicted African Americans. Because of this unexpected low frequency an association analysis to opioid requirements and effects of mu-opioid receptor agonists was not feasible. In conclusion, transcriptional regulation of MOR1 is modified by two genetic variations at positions -554 and -1320 of the mu-opioid receptor promoter. Individuals presenting these variations may have an altered level of MOR expression. A possible association of these genomic variants on efficacy and side effects of opioid treatment in different ethnic groups has to be elucidated.
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematopoietic stem cell disease with distinct biological and clinical features. The biologic basis of the stereotypical progression from chronic phase through accelerated phase to blast crisis is poorly understood. We used DNA microarrays to compare gene expression in 91 cases of CML in chronic (42 cases), accelerated (17 cases), and blast phases (32 cases). Three thousand genes were found to be significantly (P &lt; 10(-10)) associated with phase of disease. A comparison of the gene signatures of chronic, accelerated, and blast phases suggest that the progression of chronic phase CML to advanced phase (accelerated and blast crisis) CML is a two-step rather than a three-step process, with new gene expression changes occurring early in accelerated phase before the accumulation of increased numbers of leukemia blast cells. Especially noteworthy and potentially significant in the progression program were the deregulation of the WNT/beta-catenin pathway, the decreased expression of Jun B and Fos, alternative kinase deregulation, such as Arg (Abl2), and an increased expression of PRAME. Studies of CML patients who relapsed after initially successful treatment with imatinib demonstrated a gene expression pattern closely related to advanced phase disease. These studies point to specific gene pathways that might be exploited for both prognostic indicators as well as new targets for therapy.
ERCC1 is a critical gene within the nucleotide excision repair pathway. Overexpression of ERCC1 through promoter-mediating transcriptional regulation is associated with repair of cisplatin-induced DNA damage and clinical resistance to platinum-chemotherapy. Several transcriptional repressors and activators within the 5'-flanking region of the ERCC1 gene may be involved in the up-regulation of this gene. Minimal sequence within the promoter region required for ERCC1 transcription was analyzed by CAT assay and demonstrated that the region of -220 to -110 is essential to constitutive expression of ERCC1 gene in ovarian cancer cell line A2780/CP70. A more forward upstream region seems to be responsible for cisplatin-induced expression. Study of the functional cis-element in this region by electrophoretic mobility shift assay indicates that a MZF1-like site as well as an AP1-like site responded in a time-dependent manner to cisplatin stimulation with altered binding activities. EMSA with MZF1 ZN1-4 consensus oligonucleotides suggests that the MZF1 N-terminal domain of zinc finger cluster may bind to the MZF1-like site of the ERCC1 promoter region. MZF1 mRNA in A2780/CP70 cells decreased upon cisplatin exposure as analyzed by quantitative PCR, suggesting that MZF1 may mediate cisplatin-invoked gene expression in these cells. Overexpression of MZF1 repressed the ERCC1 promoter activity as determined in co-transfection assay, suggesting that MZF1 might be a repressor of ERCC1 transcription upon cisplatin exposure. In summary, our studies revealed a core promoter region and adjacent drug-responsible region within the ERCC1 promoter. The drug-responsible region contains cis-elements of activator, AP1 and repressor, MZF1. In response to cisplatin treatment, decreased MZF1 and increased AP1 binding activities appear to be the leading mechanism of up-regulation of ERCC1 expression. Our findings imply potential therapeutic strategies to antagonize drug resistant mechanisms in treatment of human ovarian cancer.
Our previous study found that PKCalpha was highly expressed in the poor-differentiated human HCC cells and associated with cell migration and invasion. In this study, we further investigated the gene regulation of this enzyme. We showed that PKCalpha expression enhancement in the poor-differentiated human HCC cells was found neither by DNA amplification nor by increasing mRNA stability using differential PCR and mRNA decay assays. After screening seven transcription factors in the putative cis-acting regulatory elements of human PKCalpha promoters, only Elk-1 and MZF-1 antisense oligonucleotide showed a significant reduction in the PKCalpha mRNA level. They also reduced cell proliferation, cell migratory and invasive capabilities, and DNA binding activities in the PKCalpha promoter region. Over-expression assay confirmed that the PKCalpha expression may be modulated by these two factors at the transcriptional level. Therefore, these results may provide a novel mechanism for PKCalpha expression regulation in human HCC cells.
The solitary ERV-9 long terminal repeat (LTR) located upstream of the HS5 site in the human beta-globin locus control region exhibits prominent enhancer activity in embryonic and erythroid cells. The LTR enhancer contains 14 tandemly repeated subunits with recurrent CCAAT, GTGGGGA, and GATA motifs. Here we showed that in erythroid K562 cells these DNA motifs bound the following three transcription factors: ubiquitous NF-Y and hematopoietic MZF1 and GATA-2. These factors and their target DNA motifs exhibited a hierarchy of DNA/protein and protein/protein binding affinities: NF-Y/CCAAT &gt; NF-Y/GATA-2 &gt; NF-Y/MZF1 &gt; MZF1/GTGGGGA; GATA-2/GATA. Through protein/protein interactions, NF-Y bound at the CCAAT motif recruited MZF1 and GATA-2, but not Sp1 and GATA-1, and stabilized their binding to the neighboring GTGGGGA and GATA sites to assemble a novel LTR enhancer complex, NF-Y/MZF1/GATA-2. In the LTR-HS5-epsilonp-GFP plasmid integrated into K562 cells, mutation of the CCAAT motif in the LTR enhancer to abolish NF-Y binding inactivated the enhancer, closed down the chromatin structure of the epsilon-globin promoter, and silenced transcription of the green fluorescent protein gene. The results indicated that NF-Y bound at the CCAAT motifs assembled a robust LTR enhancer complex, which could act over the intervening DNA to remodel the chromatin structure and to stimulate the transcription of the downstream gene locus.
The MUC1 mucin is a large membrane-tethered glycoprotein that shows differential expression in many adenocarcinomas, where it contributes to their invasive and metastatic properties. We previously identified DNase I hypersensitive sites at -750 and -250 bp in the human MUC1 gene promoter and showed concordance between the -250 site and MUC1 mRNA levels in vivo. Transient expression assays using promoter constructs, in which the core DHS was deleted, to drive reporter gene expression revealed in vivo evidence for their activity. DNase I footprinting using nuclear extracts from HPAF human pancreatic carcinoma cells and MCF7 breast carcinoma cells identified three protein-binding elements in these regions (-250FP1, FP2 and -750FP). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays detected several complexes between HPAF nuclear proteins and labeled FP DNA probes. Southwestern blots and UV cross-linking experiments identified myeloid zinc finger-1 (MZF-1) as a candidate transcription factor among proteins binding to the -250FP1 and FP2 sequences. Another candidate that was identified by screening an HPAF cDNA expression library with the -250FP1 probe is DNA binding protein A (DbpA). Exogenous DbpA expression in COS-7 cells was accompanied by upregulation of MUC1 promoter activity via the -250 DHS, suggesting that DbpA binding to the -250 DHS can influence human MUC1 gene expression.
Traditional approaches for generating goat pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) suffer from complexity and low preparation efficiency. Therefore, we tried to derive goat iPSCs with a new method by transfecting exogenous Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc mRNAs into goat embryonic fibroblasts (GEFs), and explore the mechanisms regarding the transcription regulation of the reprogramming factors in goat iPSCs induction.
mRNAs of the four reprogramming factors were transfected into GEFs, and were localized in nucleus with approximately 90% transfection efficiency. After five consecutive transfections, GEFs tended to aggregate by day 10. Clones appeared on day 15-18, and typical embryonic stem cell -like clones formed on day 20. One thousand AKP staining positive clones were achieved in 104 GEFs, with approximately 1.0% induction efficiency. Immunofluorescence staining and qRT-PCR detection of the ESCs markers confirmed the properties of the goat iPSCs. The achieved goat iPSCs could be cultured to 22nd passage, which showed normal karyotype. The goat iPSCs were able to differentiate into embryoid bodies with three germ layers. qRT-PCR and western blot showed activated endogenous pluripotent factors expression in the later phase of mRNA-induced goat iPSCs induction. Epigenetic analysis of the endogenous pluripotent gene Nanog revealed its demethylation status in derived goat iPSCs. Core promoter regions of the four reprogramming factors were determined. Transcription factor binding sites, including Elf-1, AP-2, SP1, C/EBP and MZF1, were identified to be functional in the core promoter regions of these reprogramming genes. Demethylation and deacetylation of the promoters enhanced their transcription activities.
We successfully generated goat iPSCs by transfection of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc mRNAs into GEFs, which initiated the endogenous reprogramming network and altered the methylation status of pluripotent genes. Core promoter regions and functional transcription binding sites of the four reprogramming genes were identified. Epigenetic regulation was revealed to participate in mRNA induced iPSCs formation. Our study provides a safe and efficient approach for goat. iPSCs generation.
SCAN domains in zinc-finger transcription factors are crucial mediators of protein-protein interactions. Up to 240 SCAN-domain encoding genes have been identified throughout the human genome. These include cancer-related genes, such as the myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1), an oncogenic transcription factor involved in the progression of many solid cancers. The mechanisms by which SCAN homo- and heterodimers assemble and how they alter the transcriptional activity of zinc-finger transcription factors in cancer and other diseases remain to be investigated. Here, we provide the first description of the conformational ensemble of the MZF1 SCAN domain cross-validated against NMR experimental data, which are probes of structure and dynamics on different timescales. We investigated the protein-protein interaction network of MZF1 and how it is perturbed in different cancer types by the analyses of high-throughput proteomics and RNASeq data. Collectively, we integrated many computational approaches, ranging from simple empirical energy functions to all-atom microsecond molecular dynamics simulations and network analyses to unravel the effects of cancer-related substitutions in relation to MZF1 structure and interactions.
SMAD4 is a tumor suppressor that is frequently inactivated in many types of cancer. The role of abnormal expression of SMAD4 has been reported in developmental processes and the progression of various human cancers. The expression level of SMAD4 has been related to the survival rate in gastric cancer patients. However, the molecular mechanism underlying transcriptional regulation of SMAD4 remains largely unknown. In the present study, we characterized the promoter region of SMAD4 and identified myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1), as a putative transcription factor. MZF1 directly bound to a core region of the SMAD4 promoter and stimulated transcriptional activity. We also found that the expression of MZF1 influences the migration ability of gastric adenocarcinoma cells. Collectively, our results showed that MZF1 has a role in cellular migration of gastric cancer cells via promoting an increase in intracellular SMAD4 levels. This study might provide new evidence for the molecular basis of the tumor suppressive effect of the MZF1-SMAD4 axis, a new therapeutic target in advanced human gastric cancer.
Matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP-14), a membrane-anchored MMP that promotes the tumorigenesis and aggressiveness, is highly expressed in gastric cancer. However, the transcriptional regulators of MMP-14 expression in gastric cancer still remain largely unknown. In this study, through mining computational algorithm programs and chromatin immunoprecipitation datasets, we identified adjacent binding sites of myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1) and miRNA-337-3p (miR-337-3p) within the MMP-14 promoter. We demonstrated that MZF1 directly bound to the MMP-14 promoter to facilitate its nascent transcription and expression in gastric cancer cell lines. In contrast, endogenous miR-337-3p suppressed the MMP-14 expression through recognizing its binding site within MMP-14 promoter. Mechanistically, miR-337-3p repressed the binding of MZF1 to MMP-14 promoter via recruiting Argonaute 2 and inducing repressive chromatin remodeling. Gain- and loss-of-function studies demonstrated that miR-337-3p suppressed the growth, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis of gastric cancer cells in vitro and in vivo through repressing MZF1-facilitated MMP-14 expression. In clinical specimens and cell lines of gastric cancer, MZF1 was highly expressed and positively correlated with MMP-14 expression. Meanwhile, miR-337-3p was under-expressed and inversely correlated with MMP-14 levels. miR-337-3p was an independent prognostic factor for favorable outcome of gastric cancer, and patients with high MZF1 or MMP-14 expression had lower survival probability. Taken together, these data indicate that miR-337-3p directly binds to the MMP-14 promoter to repress MZF1-facilitatd MMP-14 expression, thus suppressing the progression of gastric cancer.
This work investigated the role of paired box 2 (PAX2) in endometrial cancer and its epigenetic regulation mechanism. Endometrial cancer tissues and cell lines exhibited increased PAX2 expression compared with hyperplasia, normal endometrium and endometrial epithelial cells. Knock-down of PAX2 resulted in reduced cell viability, invasion and migration, and PAX2 overexpression caused the opposite effects. Increased methylation of the PAX2 promoter was observed in both cancer tissues and cell lines and was positively correlated with PAX2 expression. After 5-Aza-CdR treatment, PAX2 mRNA and protein were down-regulated, and PAX2 methylation was decreased. Deletion analysis confirmed that a repressive transcriptional regulatory region of the PAX2 promoter coincided with the hypermethylated region identified in MassARRAY analysis. Binding sites of myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1) are predicted in the defined region. Knock-down of MZF1 up-regulated the transcriptional activity and protein level of PAX2 after 5-Aza-CdR treatment, which indicated that MZF1 may act as a repressive transcription factor when the PAX2 promoter is unmethylated. In conclusion, PAX2 is involved in the carcinogenesis of endometrial cancer by stimulating cell growth and promoting cell motility. The overexpression of PAX2 in endometrial cancer is regulated by promoter hypermethylation and the transcription factor MZF1.
Recent reports demonstrate that the expression of protein kinase C alpha (PKCα) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) correlates with decreased survival outcomes. However, off-target effects of targeting PKCα and limited understanding of the signaling mechanisms upstream of PKCα have hampered previous efforts to manipulate this ubiquitous gene. This study shows that the expression of both myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF-1) and Ets-like protein-1 (Elk-1) correlates with PKCα expression in TNBC. We found that the acidic domain of MZF-1 and the heparin-binding domain of Elk-1 facilitate the heterodimeric interaction between the two genes before the complex formation binds to the PKCα promoter. Blocking the formation of the heterodimer by transfection of MZF-160-72 or Elk-1145-157 peptide fragments at the MZF-1 / Elk-1 interface decreases DNA-binding activity of the MZF-1 / Elk-1 complex at the PKCα promoter. Subsequently, PKCα expression, migration, tumorigenicity, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition potential of TNBC cells decrease. These subsequent effects are reversed by transfection with full-length PKCα, confirming that the MZF-1/Elk-1 heterodimer is a mediator of PKCα in TNBC cells. These data suggest that the next therapeutic strategy in treating PKCα-related cancer will be developed from blocking MZF-1/Elk-1 interaction through their binding domain.
Otosclerosis (OTSC) is defined by abnormal bone remodeling in the otic capsule of middle ear which leads to conductive hearing loss. In our previous study, we have identified a de novo heterozygous mutation -832G &gt; A in the promoter of TGFB1 in an otosclerosis patient. In the present study, we progressively screened this mutation in a cohort of 254 cases and 262 controls. The family members of the patient positive for -832G &gt; A variation were also screened and found inheritance of this variation only to her daughter. Interestingly, this variation is associated with a decreased level of the TGFB1 transcript in the patient compared to her parents and controls. In silico analysis of this mutation predicted the altered binding of two transcription factors v-Myb and MZF1 in the mutated promoter sequence. Further, functional analysis of this mutation using in vitro luciferase and electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that this variation is associated with decreased gene expression. In conclusion, this study established the fact that TGFB1 mutation -832G &gt; A altered the TGFB1 promoter activity, which could affect the susceptibility to otosclerosis development. Further, systemic analysis of TGFB1 gene sequence and expression analysis of this gene might reveal its precise role in the pathogenesis of otosclerosis.
AXL receptor tyrosine kinase is overexpressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and has a function in cancer progression and metastases. However, the mechanism underlying AXL gene regulation in TNBC remains unknown. In this study, the involvement of protein kinase C α (PKCα) in the expression of AXL was investigated in human TNBC cells. The microarray data from other studies showed that PKCα is significantly correlated with AXL expression in TNBC cell lines. Tissue array analysis also confirmed their correlation in TNBC. The PKCα inhibitor Go6976 was used to treat MDA‑MB‑231 and Hs578T TNBC cells, which resulted in decreased expression of AXL and epithelia-mesenchymal transition-related gene vimentin, and decreased cell proliferation. An MZF‑1 acidic domain fragment (MZF-1 peptide), which was designed to downregulate PKCα expression, was transfected into the cells and resulted in inhibition of AXL expression. This effect was reversed by co‑treatment with the constitutive form of PKCα. Moreover, the downregulation of PKCα was also confirmed by treatment with TAT‑fused MZF‑1 peptide. Thus, the current study proposes that AXL may be correlated with PKCα‑dependent TNBC cells, and could be modulated by MZF‑1 peptides. 
WNT/β-catenin pathway members have been implicated in interstitial fibrosis and glomerular sclerosis disease processes characteristic of diabetic nephropathy (DN), processes partly controlled by transcription factors (TFs) that bind to gene promoter regions attenuating regulation. We sought to identify predicted cis-acting transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) overrepresented within WNT pathway members.
We assessed 62 TFBS motif frequencies from the JASPAR databases in 65 WNT pathway genes. P values were estimated on the hypergeometric distribution for each TF. Gene expression profiles of enriched motifs were examined in DN-related datasets to assess clinical significance.
Transcription factor AP-2 alpha (TFAP2A), myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1), and specificity protein 1 (SP1) were significantly enriched within WNT pathway genes (P values &lt; 6.83 × 10(-29), 1.34 × 10(-11), and 3.01 × 10(-6), resp.). MZF1 expression was significantly increased in DN in a whole kidney dataset (fold change = 1.16; 16% increase; P = 0.03). TFAP2A expression was decreased in an independent dataset (fold change = -1.02; P = 0.03). No differential expression of SP1 was detected.
Three TFBS profiles are significantly enriched within WNT pathway genes highlighting the potential of in silico analyses for identification of pathway regulators. Modification of TF binding may possibly limit DN progression, offering potential therapeutic benefit.
High-throughput loss-of-function genetic screening tools in yeast or other model systems except in mammalian cells have been implemented to study human susceptibility to chemical toxicity. Here, we employed a newly developed human haploid cell (KBM7)-based mutagenic screening model (KBM7-mu cells) and examined its applicability in identifying genes whose absence allows cells to survive and proliferate in the presence of chemicals.
KBM7-mu cells were exposed to 200 μM Chlorpyrifos (CPF), a widely used organophosphate pesticide, a dose causing approximately 50% death of cells after 48h of treatment. After a 2-3 week period of continuous CPF exposure, survived single cell colonies were recovered and used for further analysis. DNA isolated from these cells was amplified using Splinkerette PCR with specific designed primers, and sequenced to determine the genomic locations with virus insertion and identify genes affected by the insertion. Quantitative realtime reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to confirm the knockdown of transcription of identified target genes.
We identified total 9 human genes in which the cells carrying these genes conferred the resistance to CPF, including AGPAT6, AIG1, ATP8B2, BIK, DCAF12, FNBP4, LAT2, MZF1-AS1 and PPTC7. MZF1-AS1 is an antisense RNA and not included in the further analysis. qRT-PCR results showed that the expression of 6 genes was either significantly reduced or completely lost. There were no changes in the expression of DCAF12 and AGPAT6 genes between the KBM7-mu and the control KBM7 cells.
The KBM7-mu genetic screening system can be modified and applied to identify novel susceptibility genes in response to environmental toxicants, which could provide valuable insights into potential mechanisms of toxicity.
The growth and survival factor hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is expressed at high levels in multiple myeloma (MM) cells. We report here that elevated HGF transcription in MM was traced to DNA mutations in the promoter alleles of HGF. Sequence analysis revealed a previously undiscovered single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and crucial single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the promoters of myeloma cells that produce large amounts of HGF. The allele-specific mutations functionally reassembled wild-type sequences into the motifs that affiliate with endogenous transcription factors NFKB (nuclear factor kappa-B), MZF1 (myeloid zinc finger 1), and NRF-2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2). In vitro, a mutant allele that gained novel NFKB-binding sites directly responded to transcriptional signaling induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) to promote high levels of luciferase reporter. Given the recent discovery by genome-wide sequencing (GWS) of numerous non-coding mutations in myeloma genomes, our data provide evidence that heterogeneous SNVs in the gene regulatory regions may frequently transform wild-type alleles into novel transcription factor binding properties to aberrantly interact with dysregulated transcriptional signals in MM and other cancer cells.
Overexpression of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene has been associated with advanced stage and poor survival in several cancers. The majority of disease-associated VEGF-single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) locate within regulatory regions. Therefore, an influence of SNPs located in the promoter/5'-untranslated region (5'UTR) on transcription factor binding (TFB) and gene expression seems feasible. We reviewed the literature investigating a potential connection of VEGF-SNPs and transcriptional regulation of the VEGF gene. In addition, we employed transcription factor databases to search for VEGF-SNPs which have already been associated with diseases. The objective of this review is to gain an overview about an association of VEGF-SNPs and the transcription factor dependent regulation of the VEGF gene. A decreasing binding specificity of the transcription factor MZF1 in presence of the VEGF-SNP +405 C-allele has been reported. TF databases indicated a potential HIF binding site for the -2578 C-allele representing an important potential inducer of VEGF expression. Additionally, linkage disequilibrium of the -2578 A-allele and an 18 bp insertion increases the number of potential TFB sites. For the VEGF promoter SNP -1154 A/G an interaction with the HRE under participation of the SNP +405 C/G was supposed. The comprehension of the association of specific SNPs and TFB could be an essential part in our understanding of individual differences of VEGF regulation and course of diseases.
In this study, the molecular mechanism of protein kinase C alpha (PKCα) gene regulation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) involving Ets-like protein-1 (Elk-1) and myeloid zinc finger-1 (MZF-1) was investigated. The luciferase reporter assay results revealed that the presence of both MZF-1 and Elk-1 significantly contributed to the upregulation of PKCα gene transcription activity, and the transcriptional activity decreased when the transfection included a DNA-binding-deficient (∆DBD) gene vector of either MZF-1 or Elk-1 DNA-binding deficiency (MZF-1∆DBD or Elk-1∆DBD), thereby indicating that the enhanced expression of PKCα was caused by the binding of MZF-1 and/or Elk-1 with the PKCα promoter. We investigated MZF-1 and Elk-1 to determine whether they bind to each other. The results of immunoprecipitation (IP), Co-IP, chromatin IP (ChIP), and Re-ChIP analyses indicated that Elk-1 can directly bind to the N-terminal region of MZF-1 and MZF-1 can directly bind to the C-terminal region of Elk-1 to form a complex before attaching to the PKCα promoter. Furthermore, when MZF-1∆DBD or Elk-1∆DBD was added to the cells, PKCα expression decreased, and cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and tumorigenicity also decreased. These findings suggest that PKCα expression in HCC could be stimulated by the formation of MZF-1/Elk-1 complex, which directly binds to the PKCα promoter. 
Myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1) belongs to the SCAN-Zinc Finger (SCAN-ZF) transcription factor family that has recently been implicated in a number of types of cancer. Although the initial studies concentrated on the role of MZF1 in myeloid differentiation and leukemia, the factor now appears to be involved in the etiology of major solid tumors such as lung, cervical, breast, and colorectal cancer. Here we discuss the regulation of MZF1 that mediated its recruitment and activation in cancer, concentrating on posttranslational modification by phosphorylation, and sumoylation, formation of promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies and its association with co-activators and co-repressors.
Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CCN2/CTGF) and Nephroblastoma Overexpressed (CCN3/NOV) execute key functions within the hematopoietic compartment. Both are abundant in the bone marrow stroma, which is a niche for hematopoiesis and supports marrow function. Roles for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) and all-trans retinoic acid in the bone marrow have also been elucidated. Interestingly, some of the annotated roles of these vitamins overlap with established functions of CCN2 and CCN3. Yet, no factor has been identified that unifies these observations. In this study, we report the regulation of the CTGF and NOV genes by Myeloid Zinc Finger-1 (MZF-1), a hematopoietic transcription factor. We show the interaction of MZF-1 with the CTGF and NOV promoters in several cell types. Up-regulation of MZF-1 via calcitriol and vitamin A induces expression of CTGF and NOV, implicating a role for these vitamins in the functions of these two genes. Lastly, knockdown of MZF1 reduces levels of CTGF and NOV. Collectively, our results argue that MZF-1 regulates the CTGF and NOV genes in the hematopoietic compartment, and may be involved in their respective functions in the stroma.
The type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) tyrosine kinase promotes the survival of an aggressive subtype of T-cell lymphoma by interacting with nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK) oncogenic protein. NPM-ALK(+) T-cell lymphoma exhibits much higher levels of IGF-IR than normal human T lymphocytes. The mechanisms underlying increased expression of IGF-IR in this lymphoma are not known. We hypothesized that upregulation of IGF-IR could be attributed to previously unrecognized defects that inherently exist in the transcriptional machinery in NPM-ALK(+) T-cell lymphoma.
Screening studies showed substantially lower levels of the transcription factors Ikaros isoform 1 (Ik-1) and myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1) in NPM-ALK(+) T-cell lymphoma cell lines and primary tumor tissues from patients than in human T lymphocytes. A luciferase assay supported that Ik-1 and MZF1 suppress IGF-IR gene promoter. Furthermore, ChIP assay showed that these transcription factors bind specific sites located within the IGF-IR gene promoter. Forced expression of Ik-1 or MZF1 in the lymphoma cells decreased IGF-IR mRNA and protein. This decrease was associated with downregulation of pIGF-IR, and the phosphorylation of its interacting proteins IRS-1, AKT, and NPM-ALK. In addition, overexpression of Ik-1 and MZF1 decreased the viability, proliferation, migration, and anchorage-independent colony formation of the lymphoma cells.
Our results provide novel evidence that the aberrant decreases in Ik-1 and MZF1 contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of NPM-ALK(+) T-cell lymphoma through the upregulation of IGF-IR expression. These findings could be exploited to devise new strategies to eradicate this lymphoma.
The myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1) is a zinc finger transcription factor which regulates myeloid differentiation and oncogenesis. However, little information is available concerning the MZF1 expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and its correlation with patients' prognosis. We detected the expression of MZF1 in 274 patients with OSCC using tissue microarrays (TMAs) and evaluated the associations between nuclear MZF1 expression and the clinical parameters of OSCC patients. We found that nuclear MZF1 expression was present in 190/274 (69.3 %) cases, and loss of nuclear expression of MZF1 was associated with more advanced clinical stages (p = 0.011) and larger tumor size (p = 0.002), but not associated with positive lymph node metastasis and distal metastasis. Importantly, tongue squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) patients with negative nuclear MZF1 expression had significantly worse overall survival rates (log-rank test, p = 0.028). In conclusion, our results revealed that the loss of nuclear expression of MZF1 in OSCC samples can predict the progression of OSCC and the survival of OSCC patients in Taiwan.
LIM-only protein 3 (LMO3), a member of the LIM-only protein group, is a new DNA methylation gene that was identified in gliomas via the MeDIP-Chip in our previous study. In this study, we found that LIM-only protein 3 (LMO3) is hypomethylated and overexpressed in glioma cells and tissues. The overexpression of LMO3 was correlated with a poor prognosis in glioma patients, and LMO3 was indirectly inhibited by the tumor suppressor miR-101, which is a potential prognosis marker of gliomas. MiR-101 decreased the expression of LMO3 by reversing the methylation status of the LMO3 promoter and by inhibiting the presence of the methylation-related histones H3K4me2 and H3K27me3 and increasing the presence of H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 on the promoter. It was determined that miR-101 decreases the occupancy of H3K27me3 by inhibiting EZH2, DNMT3A and EED and decreases the H3K9me3 occupancy on the LMO3 promoter via SUV39H1, SUV39H2, G9a and PHF8. Furthermore, miR-101 suppresses the expression of LMO3 by decreasing USF and MZF1.
Alcohol (EtOH) intoxication is a risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality with traumatic injuries, in part through inhibition of bone fracture healing. Animal models have shown that EtOH decreases fracture callus volume, diameter, and biomechanical strength. Transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) and osteopontin (OPN) play important roles in bone remodeling and fracture healing. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) reside in bone and are recruited to fracture sites for the healing process. Resident MSC are critical for fracture healing and function as a source of TGF-β1 induced by local OPN, which acts through the transcription factor myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1). The molecular mechanisms responsible for the effect of EtOH on fracture healing are still incompletely understood, and this study investigated the role of EtOH in affecting OPN-dependent TGF-β1 expression in MSC. We have demonstrated that EtOH inhibits OPN-induced TGF-β1 protein expression, decreases MZF1-dependent TGF-β1 transcription and MZF1 transcription, and blocks OPN-induced MZF1 phosphorylation. We also found that PKA signaling enhances OPN-induced TGF-β1 expression. Last, we showed that EtOH exposure reduces the TGF-β1 protein levels in mouse fracture callus. We conclude that EtOH acts in a novel mechanism by interfering directly with the OPN-MZF1-TGF-β1 signaling pathway in MSC. 
Peripheral nerve injury-induced changes in gene transcription and translation in primary sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) are considered to contribute to neuropathic pain genesis. Transcription factors control gene expression. Peripheral nerve injury increases the expression of myeloid zinc finger protein 1 (MZF1), a transcription factor, and promotes its binding to the voltage-gated potassium 1.2 (Kv1.2) antisense (AS) RNA gene in the injured DRG. However, whether DRG MZF1 participates in neuropathic pain is still unknown. Here, we report that blocking the nerve injury-induced increase of DRG MZF1 through microinjection of MZF1 siRNA into the injured DRG attenuated the initiation and maintenance of mechanical, cold, and thermal pain hypersensitivities in rats with chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve, without affecting locomotor functions and basal responses to acute mechanical, heat, and cold stimuli. Mimicking the nerve injury-induced increase of DRG MZF1 through microinjection of recombinant adeno-associated virus 5 expressing full-length MZF1 into the DRG produced significant mechanical, cold, and thermal pain hypersensitivities in naive rats. Mechanistically, MZF1 participated in CCI-induced reductions in Kv1.2 mRNA and protein and total Kv current and the CCI-induced increase in neuronal excitability through MZF1-triggered Kv1.2 AS RNA expression in the injured DRG neurons. MZF1 is likely an endogenous trigger of neuropathic pain and might serve as a potential target for preventing and treating this disorder. 
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most lethal human cancers, but the mechanism of the cancer is still unclear enough. We aimed to explore the key genes in CRC progression. The gene expression profile (GSE4183) of CRC was obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus database which included 8 normal samples, 15 adenoma samples, 15 CRC samples and 15 inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) samples. Thereinto, 8 normal, 15 adenoma, and 15 CRC samples were chosen for our research. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in normal vs. adenoma, normal vs. CRC, and adenoma vs. CRC, were identified using the Wilcoxon test method in R respectively. The interactive network of DEGs was constructed to select the significant modules using the Pearson's correlation. Meanwhile, transcriptional network of DEGs was also constructed using the g: Profiler. Totally, 2,741 DEGs in normal vs. adenoma, 1,484 DEGs in normal vs. CRC, and 396 DEGs in adenoma vs. CRC were identified. Moreover, function analysis of DEGs in each group showed FcR-mediated phagocytosis pathway in module 1, cardiac muscle contraction pathway in module 6, and Jak-STAT signaling pathway in module 19 were also enriched. Furthermore, MZF1 and AP2 were the transcription factor in module 6, with the target SP1, while SP1 was also a transcription in module 20. DEGs like NCF1, AKT, SP1, AP2, MZF1, and TPM might be used as specific biomarkers in CRC development. Therapy targeting on the functions of these key genes might provide novel perspective for CRC treatment.
Interactions between tumor cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumor microenvironment significantly influence cancer growth and metastasis. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is known to be a critical mediator of the CAF phenotype, and osteopontin (OPN) expression in tumors is associated with more aggressive phenotypes and poor patient outcomes. The potential link between these two pathways has not been previously addressed. Utilizing in vitro studies using human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and MDA-MB231 (OPN+) and MCF7 (OPN-) human breast cancer cell lines, we demonstrate that OPN induces integrin-dependent MSC expression of TGF-β1 to mediate adoption of the CAF phenotype. This OPN-TGF-β1 pathway requires the transcription factor, myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1). In vivo studies with xenotransplant models in NOD-scid mice showed that OPN expression increases cancer growth and metastasis by mediating MSC-to-CAF transformation in a process that is MZF1 and TGF-β1 dependent. We conclude that tumor-derived OPN engenders MSC-to-CAF transformation in the microenvironment to promote tumor growth and metastasis via the OPN-MZF1-TGF-β1 pathway. 
Iron is a necessary chemical element needed by all organisms. Iron metabolism is finely tuned in mammals, and the hepcidin-ferroportin (FPN) axis is the central signaling in governing systemic iron homeostasis. Deregulation of this signaling would lead to iron disorders and likely other diseases including cancers. Reduced FPN was previously found to correlate with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Nonetheless, the biological effects of abnormal FPN expression in tumor cells remain largely unexplored, and the mechanisms underlying misregulated expression of FPN in cancers keep elusive. In the current study, we scrutinized the effects of abnormal FPN on tumor growth and the molecular mechanisms of diminished tumor FPN. Downregulation of FPN significantly promoted breast cancer growth, whereas FPN upregulation impeded tumor growth. We demonstrated that the transcription factors Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2) and MZF-1 (myeloid zinc finger-1) synergistically transactivated FPN expression in breast cancer cells. Moreover, CpG island methylation at the FPN promoter was the reason of attenuated FPN expression. Downregulation of Nrf2 and MZF-1 and hypermethylation of the FPN promoter were concurrently associated with decreased FPN concentration in breast tumors. Taken together, our study highlighted the contribution of disordered iron metabolism to breast cancer growth, and also signified an oncogenic effect of misregulated ferroportin in breast cancers. This work represents a promising starting point to the possibility of restraining breast cancer through targeting FPN or its upstream regulatory factors. 
Vertebrate heart development is strictly regulated by temporal and spatial expression of growth and transcription factors (TFs). We analyzed nine TFs, selected by in silico analysis of an Nkx2.5 enhancer, for their ability to transactivate the respective enhancer element that drives, specifically, expression of genes in cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs). Mzf1 showed significant activity in reporter assays and bound directly to the Nkx2.5 cardiac enhancer (Nkx2.5 CE) during murine ES cell differentiation. While Mzf1 is established as a hematopoietic TF, its ability to regulate cardiogenesis is completely unknown. Mzf1 expression was significantly enriched in CPCs from in vitro differentiated ES cells and in mouse embryonic hearts. To examine the effect of Mzf1 overexpression on CPC formation, we generated a double transgenic, inducible, tetOMzf1-Nkx2.5 CE eGFP ES line. During in vitro differentiation an early and continuous Mzf1 overexpression inhibited CPC formation and cardiac gene expression. A late Mzf1 overexpression, coincident with a second physiological peak of Mzf1 expression, resulted in enhanced cardiogenesis. These findings implicate a novel, temporal-specific role of Mzf1 in embryonic heart development. Thereby we add another piece of puzzle in understanding the complex mechanisms of vertebrate cardiac development and progenitor cell differentiation. Consequently, this knowledge will be of critical importance to guide efficient cardiac regenerative strategies and to gain further insights into the molecular basis of congenital heart malformations. 
Foxhead box M1 (FOXM1) expression has been shown to be linked with human papillomavirus (HPV) 16/18-infected cervical cancer. However, the mechanism underlying the induction of FOXM1 in HPV 16/18-infected cancers remains elusive.
The mechanistic actions of FOXM1 induced by the E6/NKX2-1 axis in tumor aggressiveness were elucidated in cellular and animal models. The prognostic value of FOXM1 for overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) in HPV-positive oral and lung cancers was assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models.
Herein, FOXM1 expression is upregulated by E6-mediated NKX2-1 in HPV-positive cervical, oral, and lung cancer cells. Induction of FOXM1 by E6 through the MZF1/NKX2-1 axis is responsible for HPV-mediated soft agar growth, invasiveness, and stemness through activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In a nude mice model, metastatic lung tumor nodules in HPV 18 E6-positive GNM or HPV 16 E6-positive TL-1-injected nude mice were markedly decreased in both cell types with E6 knockdown, FOXM1 knockdown, or treatment with FOXM1 inhibitor (thiostrepton). Among the four subgroup patients, the worst FOXM1 prognostic value for OS and RFS was observed in HPV 16/18-positive patients with tumors with high-expressing FOXM1.
Induction of FOXM1 by E6 oncoprotein through the MZF1/NKX2-1 axis may be responsible for HPV 16/18-mediated tumor progression and poor outcomes in HPV-positive patients.
The pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) reflects a balance between mucosal injury and reparative mechanisms. Some regenerating gene (Reg) family members have been reported to be expressed in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) and to be involved as proliferative mucosal factors in IBD. However, expression of all the REG family genes in IBD is still unclear. Here, we analyzed expression of all the REG family genes (REGIα, REGIβ, REG III, HIP/PAP, and REG IV) in biopsy specimens of UC and CD by real-time RT-PCR. REG Iα, REG Iβ, and REG IV genes were overexpressed in CD samples. REG IV gene was also overexpressed in UC samples. We further analyzed the expression mechanisms of REG Iα, REG Iβ, and REG IV genes in LS-174T and HT-29 human colonic epithelial cells. The expression of REG Iα was significantly induced by IL-6 or IL-22, and REG Iβ was induced by IL-22. Deletion analyses revealed that three regions (- 220~- 211, - 179~- 156, and - 146~- 130) in REG Iα and the region (- 274~- 260) in REG Iβ promoter were responsible for the activation by IL-22/IL-6. The promoters contain consensus transcription factor binding sequences for MZF1, RTEF1/TEAD4, and STAT3 in REG Iα, and HLTF/FOXN2F in REG Iβ, respectively. The introduction of siRNA for MZF1, RTEF1/TEAD4, STAT3, and HLTF/FOXN2F abolished the transcription of REG Iα and REG Iβ. The gene activation mechanisms of REG Iα/REG Iβ may play a role in colon mucosal regeneration in IBD.
HER2/ErbB2 activation turns on transcriptional processes that induce local invasion and lead to systemic metastasis. The early transcriptional changes needed for ErbB2-induced invasion are poorly understood. Here, we link ErbB2 activation to invasion via ErbB2-induced, SUMO-directed phosphorylation of a single serine residue, S27, of the transcription factor myeloid zinc finger-1 (MZF1). Utilizing an antibody against MZF1-pS27, we show that the phosphorylation of S27 correlates significantly (p &lt; 0.0001) with high-level expression of ErbB2 in primary invasive breast tumors. Phosphorylation of MZF1-S27 is an early response to ErbB2 activation and results in increased transcriptional activity of MZF1. It is needed for the ErbB2-induced expression of MZF1 target genes CTSB and PRKCA, and invasion of single-cells from ErbB2-expressing breast cancer spheroids. The phosphorylation of MZF1-S27 is preceded by poly-SUMOylation of K23, which can make S27 accessible to efficient phosphorylation by PAK4. Based on our results, we suggest for an activation mechanism where phosphorylation of MZF1-S27 triggers MZF1 dissociation from its transcriptional repressors such as the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF). Our findings increase understanding of the regulation of invasive signaling in breast cancer by uncovering a detailed biological mechanism of how ErbB2 activation can rapidly lead to its invasion-promoting target gene expression and invasion.
Our recent report showed that curcumin, polyphenolic compound isolated from the herb Curcuma longa, upregulated the gene expression of human GD3 synthase (hST8Sia I) responsible for ganglioside GD3 synthesis with autophagy induction in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells. In this study, on the contrary to this finding, we demonstrated that curcumin downregulated the gene expression of human GM3 synthase (hST3Gal V) catalyzing ganglioside GM3 synthesis with autophagy induction in human colon carcinoma HCT116 cells. To clarify the mechanism leading to the downregulation of hST3Gal V gene expression in curcumin-treated HCT116 cells, we analyzed the curcumin-inducible promoter of the hST3Gal V gene by luciferase reporter assays. Promoter deletion analysis demonstrated that the -177 to -83 region, which includes putative binding sites for transcription factors NFY, CREB/ATF, SP1, EGR3, and MZF1, acts as the curcumin-responsive promoter of the hST3Gal V gene. Site-directed mutagenesis and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that the CREB/ATF binding site at -143 is pivotal for curcumin-induced downregulation of hST3Gal V gene in HCT116 cells. The transcriptional activation of hST3Gal V in HCT116 cells was significantly repressed by an inhibitor of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). These results suggest that AMPK signal pathway mediates hST3Gal V gene expression in HCT116 cells.
Metallothionein 2A (MT2A) suppresses the progression of human gastric cancer potentially through an "MT2A-NF-κB pathway" with unclear mechanisms. This study explored the role of a transcription factor, myeloid zinc-finger 1 (MZF1), in MT2A-NF-κB pathway and its clinical significance in gastric cancer.
MZF1 expression and function in gastric cancer were investigated in vitro and in vivo. The relationship between MZF1 and MT2A was determined by gain-of-function and loss-of-function assays in gastric cancer cells and an immortalized gastric cell line GES-1. The prognostic value of MZF1 expression in association with MT2A was evaluated using IHC in two cohorts.
MZF1 was epigenetically silenced in human gastric cancer cell lines and primary tumors. Overexpression of MZF1 in gastric cancer cells suppressed cell proliferation and migration, as well as the growth of xenograft tumors in nude mice. Knocking-down of MZF1 transformed GES-1 cells into a malignant phenotype characterized by increased cell growth and migration. Mechanistically, MZF1 was upregulated in both GC and GES-1 cells by MT2A ectopically expressed or induced upon treatment with a garlic-derived compound, diallyl trisulfide (DATS). MZF1 associated with MT2A was colocalized in the nuclei of GES-1 cells to target the promoter of NF-κB inhibitor alpha (NFKBIA). Clinically, MT2A and MZF1 were progressively downregulated in clinical specimens undergoing gastric malignant transformation. Downregulation of MT2A and MZF1 was significantly correlated with poorer patient prognosis.
MT2A exerts its anti-gastric cancer effects by complexing with MZF1 to target NFKBIA. MT2A/MZF1 may serve as a valuable prognostic marker and a novel therapeutic target for human gastric cancer.
To better understand the mechanisms in transcriptional regulation, we analyzed the promoters of the reprogramming key genes Sox2, c-Myc, and Oct4. Here, we cloned different 5' deletions of the goat Sox2, c-Myc, and Oct4 promoters, and evaluated their functions by green fluorescent protein reporter system and dual-luciferase reporter system. Site-directed mugagenesis and epigenetic modifiers were used to explore the influence of transcription binding sites and epigenetic status on the promoters. The results suggested that the basal promoters were located in the - 109 to 49, - 147 to 1, and - 96 to 30 bp regions of the Sox2, c-Myc, and Oct4 promoters. The transcription factors that identified to influence the Sox2, c-Myc, and Oct4 promoter activities were Elf-1 and activating protein 2 (AP-2), C/EBP and Sp1, and Mzf1 and Sp1, respectively. The epigenetic alternation of the Sox2, c-Myc, and Oct4 promoters by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine or/and trichostatin A significantly increased the promoter activities. In conclusion, the result determined the core promoter areas of the Sox2, c-Myc, and Oct4 genes, and identified the transcription factors that influence their promoter activities. We also verified that the Sox2, c-Myc, and Oct4 promoters were hypermethylated and hypoacetylated.
Enterococcus faecium strains were isolated from an original biotope, artisanal dried Tunisian meat "Dried Ossban," and evaluated for safety and capacity as probiotics. Gram-positive, catalase negative, and bacteriocin-producing bacteria were screened using selective microbiological media. All isolates were identified by phenotypic and molecular tools. Five E. faecium strains (MZF1, MZF2, MZF3, MZF4, and MZF5) were selected and further assessed for their probiotic properties. They were found to be resistant to the physiological concentrations of bile salts, and the harsh conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, and showed autoaggregation and adhesion ability. All these isolates possess at least one enterocin and could efficiently inhibit the growth of Listeria innocua HPB13. The analysis of their safety profile revealed for almost all the strains the absence of cytotoxicity and virulence determinants, and susceptibility to clinically important antibiotics such as vancomycin. These data suggest that these bacteria, isolated from "Dried Ossban," do not present a risk to human health, and may be considered as interesting candidates for future use as probiotics and bioprotective cultures for application in the food and/or feed industries.
N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) represents the most prevalent internal modification in mammalian mRNAs. Emerging evidences suggest that m6A modification is profoundly implicated in many biological processes, including cancer development. However, limited knowledge is available about the functional importance of m6A in lung cancer. In this study, by data mining The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we first identified fat mass- and obesity-associated protein (FTO) as a prognostic factor for lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Then we showed that FTO, but not other m6A modification genes including METTL3, METTL14 and ALKBH5, was the major dysregulated factor responsible for aberrant m6A modification in LUSC. Loss-of-function studies suggested that FTO knockdown effectively inhibited cell proliferation and invasion, while promoted cell apoptosis of L78 and NCI-H520 cells. Furthermore, overexpression of FTO, but not its mutant form, facilitated the malignant phenotypes of CHLH-1 cells. Mechanistically, FTO enhanced MZF1 expression by reducing m6A levels and mRNA stability in MZF1 mRNA transcript, leading to oncogenic functions. Taken together, our study demonstrates the functional importance of FTO in the tumor progression of LUSC and provides a potential therapeutic target for LUSC treatment.
The transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) pathway plays many key roles in regulating numerous biological processes. In addition, the effects of TGFβ are mediated by the transcription factor Smad3. However, the regulation of Smad3 activity is not well understood. In the present study, quantitative real-time PCR revealed that the Smad3 gene was expressed ubiquitously in 11 bovine tissues and displayed different expression patterns between muscle and adipose tissue. We further explored the expression and regulation of Smad3 gene by cloning the bovine Smad3 gene promoter; a dual-luciferase reporter assay identified that the core promoter region -337 to -41 bp was located in a CpG island. In addition, mutational analyses and electrophoretic mobility shift assays provided evidence that the KLF6, KLF15, MZF1, and KLF7 binding sites within the Smad3 promoter were responsible for the regulation of Smad3 transcription. These findings were confirmed by executing further RNA interference assays in bovine myoblasts and preadipocytes, which indicated that KLF6, KLF15, MZF1, and KLF7 are important transcriptional activators of Smad3 in both adipose and muscle tissue. These results will provide an important basis for an improved understanding of the TGFβ pathway and new insights in cattle breeding.
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical process in invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. E-cadherin to N-cadherin switching is considered a molecular hallmark of EMT. Recently, we reported that increased CK2 activity fully induces E-cadherin to N-cadherin switching, but the molecular mechanisms of N-cadherin upregulation are unknown. In this study, we examined how N-cadherin is upregulated by CK2. N-cadherin promoter analysis and ChIP analysis identified and confirmed myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1) as an N-cadherin transcription factor. Molecular analysis showed that MZF1 directly interacts with CK2 and is phosphorylated at serine 27. Phosphorylation stabilizes MZF1 and induces transcription of N-cadherin. MZF1 knockdown (MKD) in N-cadherin-expressing cancer cells downregulates N-cadherin expression and reverts the morphology from spindle and fibroblast-like to a rounded, epithelial shape. In addition, we showed that that MKD reduced the motility and invasiveness of N-cadherin-expressing cancer cells. Collectively, these data indicate that N-cadherin upregulation in CK2-mediated E-cadherin to N-cadherin switching is dependent on phosphorylation-mediated MZF1 stabilization. CK2 could be a good therapeutic target for the prevention of metastasis.
CHIP/STUB1 ubiquitin ligase is a negative co-chaperone for HSP90/HSC70, and its expression is reduced or lost in several cancers, including breast cancer. Using an extensive and well-annotated breast cancer tissue collection, we identified the loss of nuclear but not cytoplasmic CHIP to predict more aggressive tumorigenesis and shorter patient survival, with loss of CHIP in two thirds of ErbB2+ and triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) and in one third of ER+ breast cancers. Reduced CHIP expression was seen in breast cancer patient-derived xenograft tumors and in ErbB2+ and TNBC cell lines. Ectopic CHIP expression in ErbB2+ lines suppressed in vitro oncogenic traits and in vivo xenograft tumor growth. An unbiased screen for CHIP-regulated nuclear transcription factors identified many candidates whose DNA-binding activity was up- or downregulated by CHIP. We characterized myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1) as a CHIP target, given its recently identified role as a positive regulator of cathepsin B/L (CTSB/L)-mediated tumor cell invasion downstream of ErbB2. We show that CHIP negatively regulates CTSB/L expression in ErbB2+ and other breast cancer cell lines. CTSB inhibition abrogates invasion and matrix degradation in vitro and halts ErbB2+ breast cancer cell line xenograft growth. We conclude that loss of CHIP remodels the cellular transcriptome to unleash critical pro-oncogenic pathways, such as the matrix-degrading enzymes of the cathepsin family, whose components can provide new therapeutic opportunities in breast and other cancers with loss of CHIP expression.Significance: These findings reveal a novel targetable pathway of breast oncogenesis unleashed by the loss of tumor suppressor ubiquitin ligase CHIP/STUB1.

Cancer cells utilize lysosomes for invasion and metastasis. Myeloid Zinc Finger1 (MZF1) is an ErbB2-responsive transcription factor that promotes invasion of breast cancer cells via upregulation of lysosomal cathepsins B and L. Here we identify let-7 microRNA, a well-known tumor suppressor in breast cancer, as a direct negative regulator of MZF1. Analysis of primary breast cancer tissues reveals a gradual upregulation of MZF1 from normal breast epithelium to invasive ductal carcinoma and a negative correlation between several let-7 family members and MZF1 mRNA, suggesting that the inverse regulatory relationship between let-7 and MZF1 may play a role in the development of invasive breast cancer. Furthermore, we show that MZF1 regulates lysosome trafficking in ErbB2-positive breast cancer cells. In line with this, MZF1 depletion or let-7 expression inhibits invasion-promoting anterograde trafficking of lysosomes and invasion of ErbB2-expressing MCF7 spheres. The results presented here link MZF1 and let-7 to lysosomal processes in ErbB2-positive breast cancer cells that in non-cancerous cells have primarily been connected to the transcription factor EB. Identifying MZF1 and let-7 as regulators of lysosome distribution in invasive breast cancer cells, uncouples cancer-associated, invasion-promoting lysosomal alterations from normal lysosomal functions and thus opens up new possibilities for the therapeutic targeting of cancer lysosomes.
Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) is a highly lethal vascular disease. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered as a regulator of protein genes and play critical roles in cardiovascular physio-pathological processes. However, there were a few studies looking at lncRNAs in TAA. In this study, we profiled differential expression of lncRNAs between TAA (TAA group, N = 6) and normal thoracic aorta (control group, n = 6) by third-generation lncRNA microarray. We identified 1352 up-regulated and 1624 down-regulated lncRNAs with differential expression (log fold-change &gt; 2.0, p &lt; 0.01). Through nearby protein-coding gene associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolism and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) apoptosis, 12 up-regulated and 9 down-regulated lncRNAs were selected for further analysis. By calculating phastCons score of base, we identified 8 candidate lncRNAs (4 up-regulated and 4 down-regulated) with high conservation across species. By tissue specificity analysis, we found that 5 lncRNAs (HIF1A-AS1, RP11-465L10.10, LOC100506472, CTD-2184D3.5 and RP-399O19.5) were highly expressed in aortic tissues, suggested that they may be closely associated with TAA. Among them, 2 lncRNAs (RP11-465L10.10 and CTD-2184D3.5) with higher specificity in aorta (p &lt; 0.01) were analyzed by bioinformatics. Further catRAPID analysis revealed a strong RNA-protein interaction between RP11-465L10.10 and myeloid zinc finger gene 1 (MZF1), a transcription factor of MMP9. However, no intense RNA-protein interactions were observed between CTD-2184D3.5 and transcript factors of MAPK6. In conclusions, our study showed differential expression profiles of lncRNAs in TAA and revealed the interaction between certain lncRNAs and coding genes. These data provides insights into new biomarker and therapeutic targets for TAA.
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has gained considerable attention as it oversteps about 15% of the deaths caused by breast cancer in women and is well known for its aggressive impact, high proliferation rate, intensity of tumor, and metastasis. In this study, we have given a new insight into TNBC, by introducing an integrative network methodology to understand the complexity of the candidate genes in TNBC. In the course of this analysis, the central network was constructed by refining the candidate genes present in the various databases. Eventually, the hub genes SRC, EGFR, JUN, CTNNB1, and MYC were derived using distinct topological parameters such as degree, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and clustering coefficient, which implicated a central role in TNBC. Furthermore, the identified hub genes were validated by utilizing molecular complex detection cluster analysis. A regulatory network was constructed to locate the transcriptional factors regulating these hub genes via MatInspector. Interestingly, we characterized that ZF02, MZF1, and PLAG are the common transcription factors which activate the hub genes. Moreover, a functional enrichment pathway was obtained from ClueGo, which depicted that all the hub genes have a significant role in toxicity-associated pathways as well as physiochemical featured pathways. In a nutshell, these prioritized genes could be the way out to uncover the molecular and therapeutic targets, leading to the development of personalized medicine for TNBC.
To investigate the clinical significance of myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1) expression in various gastric mucosal lesions including chronic superficial gastritis (CSG), chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG), intestinal metaplasia (IM), dysplasia (DYS) and gastric cancer (GC) in comparison with normal tissues and gastric cell lines.
MZF1 protein expression was detected using immunohistochemical staining in 37 CSG, 88 CAG, 77 IM, 51 DYS, 165 GC and 8 normal tissue samples. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting were used to detect the level of MZF1 in gastric cell lines, 15 normal tissues and 34 GC samples, as well as 2 groups of paired primary GC and adjacent normal samples.
Reduced MZF1 expression was detected in most GC cells and tissues. Among the gastric tissues consisting of various stages of lesions (normal, CSG, CAG, IM, DYS and GC), MZF1 protein expression was downregulated in precancerous lesions and GC. The data from clinical analyses showed that decreased MZF1 expression was correlated with tumour invasion (p = 0.044), lymph node metastasis (p = 0.048) and poor prognosis of GC patients (p = 0.003). Moreover, MZF1 was identified as an independent prognostic biomarker for GC patients in multivariate Cox regression analysis (p = 0.009).
Downregulation of MZF1 was associated with gastric tumourigenesis, which may be a novel early predictive and prognostic biomarker in GC patients.
Previous studies revealed that PYROXD2 was more highly expressed in normal liver tissue and liver cell lines than in cancer tissue and cancer cell lines, which indicated that decreased PYROXD2 expression may be involved in hepatocarcinogenesis. To identify the mechanisms which regulate PYROXD2 gene transcription, we constructed a series of luciferase reporter plasmids and used them to perform luciferase‑based reporter assays with HepG2, Sk-hep1, L02 and 293T cells with the purpose of characterizing the PYROXD2 reporter region. Our results revealed that the transcription factor myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1) is necessary for PYROXD2 gene transcription and that it functions as a trans-activator. DNA binding assays revealed that the MZF1 protein binds to the cis-element TGGGGA located in the -320/-312 region of the PYROXD2 promoter. This promoter had a significantly enhanced activity when the MZF1 protein was overexpressed and a significantly decreased activity when the MZF1 protein expression was silenced. However, MZF1 gene expression was not significantly correlated with PYROXD2 protein expression in the samples of resected tumor tissues, which revealed that the PYROXD2 promoter transcription activity was determined by the aggregated effect of numerous transcription factors. This finding may be helpful in understanding the underlying mechanism which regulates the PYROXD2 expression.
The transcription factor (TF) yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) is a major effector of the tumor suppressive Hippo signaling pathway and is also necessary to maintain pluripotency in embryonic stem cells. Elevated levels of YAP1 expression antagonize the tumor suppressive effects of the Hippo pathway that normally represses YAP1 function. High YAP1 expression is observed in several types of human cancers and is particularly prominent in cancer stem cells (CSCs). The stem cell TF Sox2, which marks and maintains CSCs in osteosarcomas (OSs), promotes YAP1 expression by binding to an intronic enhancer element and YAP1 expression is also crucial for the maintainance of OS stem cells. To further understand the regulation of YAP1 expression in OSs, we subjected the YAP1 intronic enhancer to scanning mutagenesis to identify all DNA cis-elements critical for enhancer function. Through this approach, we identified two novel TFs, GA binding protein (GABP) and myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1), which are essential for basal YAP1 transcription. These factors are highly expressed in OSs and bind to distinct sites in the YAP1 enhancer. Depletion of either factor leads to drastically reduced YAP1 expression and thus a reversal of stem cell properties. We also found that YAP1 can regulate the expression of Sox2 by binding to two distinct DNA binding sites upstream and downstream of the Sox2 gene. Thus, Sox2 and YAP1 reinforce each others expression to maintain stemness and tumorigenicity in OSs, but the activity of MZF1 and GABP is essential for YAP1 transcription. Stem Cells 2017;35:2340-2350.
Benzene is a primary industrial chemical and a ubiquitous environmental pollutant. ERCC3 is a key player in nucleotide excision repair. Recent studies suggested that site-specific methylation is a possible mechanism of the transcriptional dysregulation by blocking transcription factors binding. We previously found that the average promoter methylation level of ERCC3 was increased in benzene-exposed workers. In order to test whether specific CpG sites of ERCC3 play an important role in benzene-induced epigenetic changes and whether the specific methylation patterns are associated with benzene hematotoxicity, we analyzed the promoter methylation levels of individual CpG sites, transcription factor binding motif and the correlation between aberrant CpG methylation and hematotoxicity in 76 benzene-exposed workers and 24 unexposed controls in China. Out of all the CpGs analyzed, two CpG units located 43 bp upstream and 99 bp downstream of the transcription start site of ERCC3 (CpG 2-4 and CpG 17-18, respectively), showed the most pronounced increase in methylation levels in benzene-exposed workers, compared with unexposed controls (Mean ± SD: 5.86 ± 2.77% vs. 4.92 ± 1.53%, p = 0.032; 8.45 ± 4.09% vs. 6.79 ± 2.50%, p = 0.024, respectively). Using the JASPAR CORE Database, we found that CpG 2-4 and CpG 17-18 were bound by three putative transcription factors (TFAP2A, E2F4 and MZF1). Furthermore, the methylation levels for CpG 2-4 were correlated negatively with the percentage of neutrophils (β = -0.676, p = 0.005) in benzene-exposed workers. This study demonstrates that CpG-specific DNA methylation in the ERCC3 promoter region may be involved in benzene-induced epigenetic modification and it may contribute to benzene-induced hematotoxicity.
Axl receptor tyrosine kinase is involved in the tumorigenesis and metastasis of many cancers. Axl expression was markedly higher in human papilloma virus type 16E6 (HPV16E6)-overexpressing HeLa (HE6F) cells and lower in HPV16E6-suppressing CaSki (CE6R) cells than in the controls. SiRNA-mediated knockdown of E6 expression led to increased phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) phosphorylation at Ser380 and attenuated AKT phosphorylation. Expression of membrane-associated guanylate kinase inverted-2 (MAGI-2), an E6-induced degradation target, was induced in E6-siRNA-transfected cells. Moreover, myeloid zinc finger protein 1 (MZF1) binds directly to the Axl promoter in HE6F cells. Axl expression was regulated by HPV16E6-mediated PTEN/AKT signalling pathway, and Axl promoter activity was regulated through MZF1 activation in cervical cancer, which promoted malignancy. Axl silencing suppressed the metastasis of Caski cells and enhanced the susceptibility to NK cell-mediated killing of HE6F cells. In addition, the expression of Axl and MZF1 was highly correlated with clinical stage of cervical cancer and HPV16/18 infection. Taken together, Axl expression was induced by HPV16E6 in cervical cancer cells, suggesting that blockade of Axl signalling might be an effective way to reduce the progression of cervical cancer.
Tumor metastasis remains a major obstacle for improving overall cancer survival in cervical cancer (CC), which may be due to the existence of tumor microenvironment-related cancer stem cells (CSCs) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The mechanism underlying these processes needs to be further elucidated. Here, we report that TGF-β1, one of the key microenvironmental stimuli, can enhance CSC characteristics, facilitate the EMT, and induce CK17. Silencing CK17 expression attenuated CSC-like properties without affecting the EMT markers induced by TGF-β1, whereas forced overexpression of CK17 promoted lymphatic metastasis in vivo even without EMT inducement. Inhibitors of ERK1/2 signaling drastically decreased the induction of CK17 mediated by TGF-β1. By combined computational and experimental approaches, we identified and validated that MZF1 was a key transcription factor binding to the promoter of CK17. Taken together, these results demonstrate that CK17 induced by the TGF-β1-ERK1/2-MZF1 signaling pathway facilitates metastasis by promoting the acquisition of CSC properties rather than by inducing the EMT process in CC, suggesting that this CK17-related signaling pathway might be a suitable target for the development of therapy for CC metastasis.
Elevated expression of preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma (PRAME) has been implicated in disease progression in a variety of cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying the transcriptional regulation of PRAME remain largely unexplored. Initially, we observed that PRAME was elevated in proportion to the malignant potential of melanoma cells. From the in silico prediction of PRAME gene structure, we identified the putative myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1) binding sites, which overlap with a CpG-rich region located in the first intron. The transcription factor MZF1 increased PRAME expression via its direct binding to the intron DNA. Upon treatment with a DNA methylation inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycitidine (5-azaC), together with ectopic expression of MZF1, PRAME expression was significantly enhanced at both the protein and mRNA levels. More pronounced MZF1 binding to the PRAME DNA was observed in the presence of 5-azaC. DNA methylation was inversely correlated with PRAME expression in melanoma cells. Finally, we observed that MZF1, like PRAME, promotes the colony-forming ability in melanoma cells. Overall, our findings suggest that MZF1, via stimulation of PRAME expression, may be a potential prognostic and therapeutic target in melanoma.
Even though various molecules may serve as biomarkers, little is known concerning the mechanisms underlying the carcinogenesis of ESCC, particularly the transcriptional regulatory network. Thus, in the present study, paired ESCC and non-cancerous (NC) tissues were assayed by Affymetrix microarray assays. Passing Attributes between Networks for Data Assimilation (PANDA) was used to construct networks between transcription factors (TFs) and their targets. AnaPANDA program was applied to compare the regulatory networks. A hypergeometric distribution model-based target profile similarity analysis was utilized to find co-activation effects using both TF-target networks and differential expression data. There were 1,116 genes upregulated and 1,301 genes downregulated in ESCC compared with NC tissues. In TF-target networks, 16,970 ESCC-specific edges and 9,307 NC-specific edges were identified. Edge enrichment analysis by AnaPANDA indicated 17 transcription factors (NFE2L2, ELK4, PAX6, TLX1, ESR1, ZNF143, TP53, REL, ELF5, STAT1, TBP, NHLH1, FOXL1, SOX9, STAT3, ELK1, and HOXA5) suppressed in ESCC and 5 (SPIB, BRCA1, MZF1, MAFG and NFE2L1) activated in ESCC. For SPIB, MZF1, MAFG and NFE2L1, a strong and significant co-activation effect among them was detected in ESCC. In conclusion, the construction of transcriptional regulatory networks found SPIB, MZF1, MAFG and NFE2L1 co-activated in ESCC, which provides distinctive insight into the carcinogenesis mechanism of ESCC.
To understand the molecular association between inflammation and dysregulated metabolism in glioblastoma, the effect of IL-1β on Hexokinase 2 (HK2) expression was investigated. IL-1β induced HK2 expression was accompanied by heightened SIRT6 and MZF1 levels. IL-1β mediated overall decrease in chromatin compactness on HK2 promoter involved diminished nucleosomal occupancy around the most labile region bearing MZF1 sites. Importantly, SIRT6 and MZF1 served as negative regulators of HK2. Ectopic SIRT6 induced formation and recruitment of MZF1-SIRT6 complex to MZF1 site was concomitant with increased nucleosomal occupancy. The function of SIRT6 as co-repressor of MZF1 was inconspicuous in cells treated with IL-1β alone, as IL-1β-induced HIF-1α prevented SIRT6 availability for interaction with MZF1. Taken together, SIRT6 over-expression establishes a condition whereby reconfiguration of the HK2 promoter chromatin structure makes it receptive to interaction with MZF1/SIRT6 complex, thereby favouring a regulatory state conducive to diminished transcription.
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive breast cancer subtype. Genome-scale molecular characteristics and regulatory mechanisms that distinguish TNBC from other subtypes remain incompletely characterized.
By combining gene expression analysis and PANDA network, we defined three different TF regulatory patterns. A core TNBC-Specific TF Activation Driven Pattern (TNBCac) was specifically identified in TNBC by computational analysis. The essentialness of core TFs (ZEB1, MZF1, SOX10) in TNBC was highlighted and validated by cell proliferation analysis. Furthermore, 13 out of 35 co-targeted genes were also validated to be targeted by ZEB1, MZF1 and SOX10 in TNBC cell lines by real-time quantitative PCR. In three breast cancer cohorts, non-TNBC patients could be stratified into two subgroups by the 35 co-targeted genes along with 5 TFs, and the subgroup that more resembled TNBC had a worse prognosis.
We constructed gene regulatory networks in breast cancer by Passing Attributes between Networks for Data Assimilation (PANDA). Co-regulatory modules were specifically identified in TNBC by computational analysis, while the essentialness of core translational factors (TF) in TNBC was highlighted and validated by in vitro experiments. Prognostic effects of different factors were measured by Log-rank test and displayed by Kaplan-Meier plots.
We identified a core co-regulatory module specifically existing in TNBC, which enabled subtype re-classification and provided a biologically feasible view of breast cancer.
Dental treatment anxiety usually develops during childhood due to a bad experience and the dental drill as well as the injection needle are the most common causes. The Atraumatic Restorative Treatment provides the opportunity to provoke little or no dental treatment anxiety because only hand instruments are used and local anaesthesia is seldom required. Several scientific studies have indicated that the Atraumatic Restorative Treatment causes less pain, discomfort and anxiety by comparison with conventional treatments. Therefore, the Atraumatic Restorative Treatment is considered to be promising for the treatment of carious lesions in anxious children and adults, and potentially also for patients suffering from dental treatment phobia. Furthermore, the Atraumatic Restorative Treatment may be indicated as the primary treatment method in children to prevent dental treatment anxiety and treatment under general anaesthesia. These conclusions must still be confirmed with responsible scientific research.
Pneumonia is a prevalent cause of death in care home residents. Dysphagia is a significant risk factor of aspiration pneumonia. The purpose of the current study was to screen for risk of aspiration in care home residents in the Netherlands and assess potential risk factors of aspiration. Five experienced speech-language therapists assessed 203 care home residents (115 primarily physically disabled, 88 primarily cognitively impaired) 60 and older in the first week after admission to a care home. In 43 (21.2%) residents, speech-language therapists assessed risk of aspiration and found no significant difference between physically disabled (26.1%) and cognitively impaired (14.8%) residents. After multivariate logistic regression analysis, the final prediction model for risk of aspiration showed Parkinson's disease as a significant factor (odds ratio = 5.11; 95% confidence interval [1.49, 17.52]) . The authors therefore conclude that risk of aspiration is a relevant care problem among Dutch care home residents and requires further assessment.
11β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 (11β-HSD1) plays a key role in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation. Besides, it metabolizes some oxysterols and bile acids (BAs). The GR regulates BA homeostasis; however, the impact of impaired 11β-HSD1 activity remained unknown. We profiled plasma and liver BAs in liver-specific and global 11β-HSD1-deficient mice. 11β-HSD1-deficiency resulted in elevated circulating unconjugated BAs, an effect more pronounced in global than liver-specific knockout mice. Gene expression analyses revealed decreased expression of the BA-CoA ligase Fatp5, suggesting impaired BA amidation. Reduced organic anion-transporting polypeptide-1A1 (Oatp1a1) and enhanced organic solute-transporter-β (Ostb) mRNA expression were observed in livers from global 11β-HSD1-deficient mice. The impact of 11β-HSD1-deficiency on BA homeostasis seems to be GR-independent because intrahepatic corticosterone and GR target gene expression were not substantially decreased in livers from global knockout mice. Moreover, Fatp5 expression in livers from hepatocyte-specific GR knockout mice was unchanged. The results revealed a role for 11β-HSD1 in BA homeostasis. 
This study aimed to investigate the sex-specific prevalence and metabolic risk factors of fatty liver disease (FLD), and to predict the prevalence of steatohepatitis with liver fibrosis in Wuhan, south central China.
A cross-sectional study was conducted among 25,032 participants who underwent health checkups from 2010 to 2011 in Zhongnan hospital.
The prevalence of FLD was higher among men than among women (31.8 vs. 12.9%, P&lt;0.0001). However, it increased markedly with age among women, and in the age-groups above 60 years, the prevalence was similar between men and women (26.4 vs. 27.6%, P&gt;0.05). FLD was associated with obesity, increased levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoproteins, serum uric acid, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and fasting blood sugar, an aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio of less than 1, and a decreased level of high-density lipoprotein in both sexes. Multiple regression analyses showed that obesity, elevated levels of fasting blood sugar, TG, total cholesterol, and alanine aminotransferase, an aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio of less than 1, serum uric acid levels, and decreased high-density lipoprotein levels were related to FLD in men, whereas age played a more prominent role in women. The prevalence of steatohepatitis with advanced fibrosis, estimated using the BMI, age, ALT, and TG index (BAAT index), was 2.5% in men and 1.4% in women; more women with FLD had a BAAT score of 3 or higher compared with men (9.0 vs. 6.6%).
The prevalence of FLD in China is high among men and elderly women and is mainly related to various metabolic parameters. The prevalence of steatohepatitis with advanced fibrosis is considerably high among individuals with FLD.
The study objective was to collect diagnostic data, to explore correlations between diagnostic variables, to provide an accurate initial diagnosis, and to provide appropriate management in consecutive subjects consulting with a multidisciplinary halitosis team because of a halitosis complaint.
Nine hundred and fifty-four subjects with halitosis complaints applied for consultation. Subjects' history data were collected and organoleptic measurements and a physical examination were performed. Finally, genuine halitosis or pseudo-halitosis/halitophobia was diagnosed initially and management was provided.
Genuine oral halitosis was diagnosed initially in 93% of cases. Using oral cleaning materials, performing mechanical tongue cleaning, and periodical dentist consultation were over-represented in women, whereas men were more likely to have observable biofilm and carious lesions than women. Female gender was associated with tongue coating. Positive associations were found between age and performing mechanical tongue cleaning, organoleptic measurement scores as well as poor oral health. Educational level was positively associated with oral self care behaviours. Performing mechanical tongue cleaning was not associated with periodical dentist consultation.
In nearly all subjects complaining of halitosis, an oral cause could be detected.
The ultimate strength of a dental prosthesis is defined as the strongest loading force applied to the prosthesis until afracture failure occurs. Important key terms are strength, hardness, toughness and fatigue. Relatively prevalent complications of single- and multi-unit fixed dental prostheses are porcelain and ceramic fractures. Afactor which also plays a role is the functional loading force from the entire orofacial system. With respect to the strength of multi-unit fixed dental prostheses, the length of the arch span between the abutment teeth, the pontic with the connectors and the possible cantilevers are the critical components. Components of the configuration ofabutment teeth of single- and multi-unit fixed dental prostheses which are relevant for its strength are the convergence angle and the design of(the area above) the (cervical) outline. Finally, the thickness of the porcelain or the ceramic (veneers) ofmetal-ceramic and all-ceramic single- and multi-unit fixed dental prostheses is of importance.
The objective of a preprosthetic orthodontic treatment is to position the teeth in such a way that a treatment with (fixed) dental prostheses is made possible or simplified or to affect the result of this treatment positively. Conceivable preprosthetic orthodontic treatments are: correcting primary orthodontic anomalies, closing or reducing interdental spaces and correcting the migration of teeth. In the case of unfavourable maxillomandibular relations, a preprosthetic surgical treatment is usually needed together with a preprosthetic orthodontic treatment. For children with agenesis and/or early loss of teeth and/or aberrant morphology of teeth, a treatment with fixed dental prostheses, either implant-supported or not, may be indicated after the tooth development or in some cases earlier. Until that time, preprosthetic orthodontic treatments may be indicated to offer an aesthetically sound provisional solution and to achieve optimal teeth positions for the final fixed dental prostheses.
The degree to which single- and multi-unit fixed dental prostheses are able to withstand loading forces is dependent, among other things, on the quality of their retention and resistance. The quality of the retention and resistance of the configuration of an abutment tooth prepared for a metal and metal-ceramic single-unit fixed dental prosthesis is determined by the configuration's convergence angle, the height, the volume, the interocclusal space, the cervical outline design, the additional preparations, the quality of the (build-up) restoration, and the surface roughness. A silicate ceramic single-unit fixed dental prosthesis is attached through adhesion using a composite cement, but the retention and resistance of an oxide ceramic single-unit fixed dental prosthesis is dependent on the abutment tooth configuration. Most types of multi-unit fixed dental prosthesis have the following additional retention and resistance determining factors: the position in the occlusal system, the number of abutment teeth and their mutual configurations, and the length of (cantilever) pontics. A resin-bonded fixed partial denture's retention and resistance are determined by its bonding as well as its enamel surface coverage and its resistance preparations.
To derive an estimate of encounters with halitosis and to assess the impact of halitosis on their psychosocial interactions with halitosis patients.
Participants were 1,006 members of an online panel, being representative of the population of the Netherlands with regard to gender, age, family situation, education level and labour participation. They were invited to participate in a survey using an online questionnaire with four questions on becoming faced with people having halitosis.
Almost 90% of the participants indicated being faced with a person having halitosis regularly, 40% at least once a week, and men significantly more frequently than women. Halitosis was reported to be a strong 'downer' when meeting a person for the first time. Whether one would draw a person's attention to his breath malodour proved to be related to the kind of person involved and appeared to decrease with the increase of the social distance to the person. Drawing a person's attention to his breath malodour would virtually always be performed personally.
Halitosis is considered to be one of the most unattractive aspects of social interactions and has potentially damaging effects on psychosocial interactions and relationships.
Atraumatic Restorative Treatment is a minimally invasive treatment modality which is intended to prevent carious lesions and to stop the progression of carious lesions. The treatment modality was developed to preserve carious teeth and was primarily aimed at communities having little or no electricity, piped water and oral healthcare and who have limited financial resources. In 1994, Atraumatic Restorative Treatment was recognised by the World Health Organization. Several systematic studies have demonstrated that Atraumatic Restorative Treatment using high-viscosity glass ionomer cement provides reliable results for one-surface restorations in deciduous molars and permanent (pre)molars. In developed as well as developing countries, more possibilities have been created with this low-cost treatment to improve the oral health of communities who have previously not had access to adequate care.
Prosthetic replacement of missing teeth aims to improve health. This can be achieved by improving the patient's well-being and quality of life and by restoring the biological balance in terms ofocclusal and mandibular stability in the occlusal and the orofacial system. In occlusal systems with a complete anterior region and 'satisfactory' premolar and molar regions, prosthetic replacement of missing teeth is not indicated generally. In case ofa restricted number of missing teeth in the anterior region and/or a not 'satisfactory' premolar region, fixed dental prostheses may be indicated. In case of an incomplete anterior region and no 'satisfactory'premolar as well as molar regions, removable dental prostheses are usually indicated. These guidelines are presented in the absence of sufficient scientific evidence. Therefore, in clinical decision making, the question whether prosthetic replacement of missing teeth is sensible, and if so, by which type of dental prosthesis, can only be answered after a dialogue with mutual respect between care provider and patient.
This article presents a brief introduction to the medical aspects of ageing and age-related diseases, and to some geriatric syndromes, followed by a discussion on their impact on general and oral healthcare provision to community-dwelling older people. Recent investigations suggest that inflammation constitutes a biological foundation of ageing and the onset of age-related diseases. Multimorbidity and polypharmacy, together with alterations in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, make older people at risk of adverse medication reactions. A side effect of several medications is causing xerostomia and hyposalivation, and both the type and number of medications used are relevant. New options of general healthcare provision to community-dwelling older people are the use of mobility aids and assistive technology devices, domiciliary health care, respite care and telecare. Their oral health status may be jeopardised by frailty, disability, care dependency and limited access to professional oral health care. Recommendations for improvement are the following: better integrating oral health care into general health care, developing and implementing an oral healthcare guideline, providing customised oral hygiene care aids, domiciliary oral healthcare provision, visiting dental hygienists and/or nurses, oral hygiene telecare, easily and safely accessible dental offices, transforming dentistry into medical oral health care and upgrading dentists to oral physicians. In case oral healthcare providers do not take the responsibility of persuading society of the importance of adequate oral health, weakened oral health of community-dwelling older people will become a potential new geriatric syndrome. 
A single- or multi-unit fixed dental prosthesis can be attached to the abutment teeth through mechanical retention and gap sealing or by adhesion. For sealing the gap, water-soluble cements are appropriate, such as zinc phosphate, polycarboxylate, and (resin-modified) glasionomer cement. Attachment through adhesion can be performed with composite cement. If the hard tooth tissue is prepared adequately, composite cement provides sufficient adhesion, but self-adhesive composite cement is now also available. For the adhesion of the composite cement to the restorative materials of the single- or multi-unit fixed dental prosthesis, surface sandblasting, silanizing, and tin coating and the application of a metal primer or chemically active composite are available. Cementing a single- or multi-unit dental prosthesis involves 3 phases: 1. Cleansing the single- or multi-unit dental prosthesis and the abutment tooth/teeth; 2. Preparing the hard tooth tissue, mixing the cement and placing the single- or multi-unit dental prosthesis; 3. Removing the excess cement.
In a correctly functioning occlusal system, the design of the occlusal parts of single-unit and multi-unit fixed dental prostheses is generally determined by the maximum intercuspation. Determining and recording the maxillomandibular relationships is only required in case the adjacent teeth do not offer adequate support or reference to put the maxillary and mandibular cast in maximum intercuspation or in case the existing occlusion needs a well-structured alteration. The maxillomandibular relationships can be determined and registered analogously and digitally and on that basis the maxillary and mandibular casts can be mounted in a (virtual) occludator or articulator. In the absence of a distinct occlusal plane, one may consider first carrying out a facebow recording and transfer. Usually, the accuracy of determining and recording the maxillomandibular relationships does not increase when using more complicated methods.
Dysphagia has been found to be strongly associated with aspiration pneumonia in frail older people. Aspiration pneumonia is causing high hospitalization rates, morbidity, and often death. Better insight in the prevalence of (subjective) dysphagia in frail older people may improve its early recognition and treatment.
First, to assess the prevalence of subjective dysphagia in care home residents in the Netherlands. Second, to assess the associations of subjective dysphagia with potential risk factors of dysphagia.
Retrospective data-analysis of a cross-sectional, multi-centre point prevalence measurement.
119 care homes in the Netherlands.
Data of 8119 care home residents aged 65 years or older were included and analyzed.
Subjective dysphagia was assessed by a resident's response to a dichotomous question with regard to experiencing swallowing problems. If a resident was not able to respond (e.g. residents with dementia or aphasia), the question was answered by the ward care provider, or the resident's file was consulted for registered swallowing complaints and/or dysphagia. Several residents' data were collected: gender, age, (number of) diseases, the presence of malnutrition, the Care Dependency Scale score, and the body mass index.
Subjective dysphagia was found in 751 (9%) residents. A final model for subjective dysphagia after multivariate backward stepwise regression analysis revealed eight significant variables: age (B -0.022), Care Dependency Scale score (B -0.985), 'malnutrition' (OR 1.58; 95% CI 1.31-1.90), 'comorbidity' (OR 1.07; 95% CI 1.01-1.14), and the disease clusters 'dementia' (OR 0.55; 95% CI 0.45-0.66), 'nervous system disorder' (OR 1.55; 95% CI 1.20-1.99), 'cardiovascular disease' (OR 0.81; 95% CI 0.67-0.99) and 'cerebrovascular disease/hemiparesis' (OR 1.74; 95% CI 1.45-2.10).
It seems justified to conclude that subjective dysphagia is a relevant care problem in older care home residents in the Netherlands. Care Dependency Scale score, 'malnutrition', and the disease clusters 'dementia', 'nervous system disorder', and 'cerebrovascular disease/hemiparesis' were associated with the presence of subjective dysphagia in this study. Age, 'comorbidity' and 'cardiovascular disease' showed very small influence.
Unexpected cholestasis substantially contributes to drug failure in clinical trials. Current models used for safety assessment in drug development do not accurately predict cholestasis in humans. Therefore, it is of relevance to develop new screening models that allow identifying drugs with cholestatic properties.
We employed mouse precision cut liver slices (PCLS), which were incubated 24 h with two model cholestatic compounds: cyclosporin A (CsA) and chlorpromazine (CPZ). Subsequently, transcriptome analysis using DNA microarrays and q-PCR were performed to identify relevant biological processes and biomarkers. Additionally, histology was carried out and levels of triglycerides (TG) and bile acids (BA) were measured. To verify the ex vivo mouse data, these were compared with publically available human data relevant for cholestasis.
Whole genome gene expression analysis showed that CsA up-regulated pathways related to NF-κB, ER stress and inflammation. Both CsA and CPZ down-regulated processes related to extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling, BA homeostasis, Fxr signalling, and energy metabolism. The differential expression of a number of characteristic genes (e.g. Abcg5, Abcg8, Klf15, and Baat) could be confirmed by q-PCR. Histology revealed that CsA but not CPZ induced "ballooning" of hepatocytes. No effects on TG and BA levels were observed after incubation of PCLS with CsA and CPZ. A substantial number of processes altered in CsA- and CPZ-treated mouse PCLS ex vivo was also found to be affected in liver biopsies of cholestatic patients.
The present study demonstrated that mouse PCLS can be used as a tool to identify mechanisms of action of cholestatic model compounds. The induction of general stress responses and down-regulated Fxr signalling could play a role in the development of drug induced cholestasis. Importantly, comparative data analysis showed that the ex vivo mouse findings are also relevant for human pathology. Moreover, this work provides a set of genes that are potentially useful to assess drugs for cholestatic properties.
To identify barriers of delivering oral health care to older people experienced by dentists.
A comprehensive literature search was carried out for studies published in the period January 1990-December 2011, using free text and MESH term search strategies for PubMed (Medline), EMBASE and CINAHL.
The initial search identified 236 potentially relevant publications: PubMed (Medline; n = 127), EMBASE (n = 108) and CINAHL (n = 1). After screening of titles and abstracts, 14 publications were revealed as relevant for further review. Seven articles, focusing on dentists delivering oral health care to older people in care homes, were suitable for this review, and seven articles did not meet the previously determined quality criteria. One of these articles also focused on barriers experienced by dentists working in their own practice and delivering oral health care to community-dwelling older people.
The most common barriers of delivering oral health care to older people were identified respectively as: the lack of adequate equipment in a care home and no area for treatment available (n = 4) and the lack of adequate reimbursement for working in a care home (n = 5). In addition, the inadequate training and experience in delivering oral health care to older care home residents (n = 2) were mentioned. Four publications indicated the loss of time from private practice as a barrier to deliver oral health care in a care home. We suggest that additional research should be initiated to investigate more in detail the barriers dentists experience in delivering oral health care to older people in their own dental practices.
An important aim ofa treatment with single-unit and multi-unit fixed dental prostheses is a durable and profitable treatment outcome. That requires aftercare, too. First, the frequency of routine oral examinations should be assessed, using an individual risk profile. The objectives of the routine oral examinations are the prevention and, when necessary, the treatment of pathological conditions and complications. With regard to prevention, attention should be paid to information and instruction, oral biofilm and calculus, non-functional activities, hard tooth tissues, periodontal and peri-implant tissues, and saliva. Subsequently, it can be determined whether the intended durability and profitability have been achieved or can still be achieved, whether or not through indicated adjustments. Special attention should be paid to endodontically treated teeth. Restorative, repair or replacement treatments may be indicated in case ofcomplications, such as loose single- or multi-unitfixed dental prosthesis, fracture of a fixed dental prosthesis unit, lost tooth pulp vitality, tooth root fracture, and implant or implant abutment problems.
To systematically review the literature on the effect of providing oral healthcare education to care home nurses on their oral healthcare knowledge and attitude and their oral hygiene care skills.
A literature search was obtained for relevant articles on oral healthcare education of nurses in care homes, using five electronic retrieval systems and databases. The search was limited to human studies, articles published in English and articles published during the period January 1990 to December 2011. The methodological quality of an article was assessed on the basis of criteria published by the Cochrane Collaboration. For articles not meeting all methodological quality criteria, relevance criteria were used to determine how much scientific evidence could be assigned to the study findings.
In accordance with the methodological quality criteria, two randomized controlled trials were included. Additionally, four studies were included after determining the scientific evidence of the study findings. The studies included revealed some scientific evidence and indications that an oral healthcare education programme for care home nurses may improve the nurses' oral healthcare knowledge and attitude. Any effect of oral healthcare education to care home nurses' oral hygiene care skills could not be determined.
Oral healthcare education may have a positive effect on care home nurses' oral healthcare knowledge and attitude and on care home residents' oral hygiene, whereas any effect on care home nurses' oral hygiene care skills could not be found.
Occlusal surfaces of teeth and restorations wear by repeated antagonistic contact. Two-body wear is the result of direct contact between occlusal surfaces. In cases of three-body wear, food is found between antagonistic teeth. Contact wear is expressed predominantly by abrasion and material fatigue. Erosion is a type of wear which does not involve direct antagonistic contact. Qualitative methods exist for registering occlusal tooth wear. Wear of restorations can be measured using casts. An obvious method for comparing rates of wear of restorative materials is laboratory research. This method has demonstrated that the wear rates of composite and enamel are similar. Cast metals and in particular ceramic wear less than enamel. The relation between oral factors and the rate of tooth wear is not always clear. Wellpolished surfaces of restorations wear less quickly and have less effect on the wearing of antagonistic teeth than rougher restoration surfaces.
As a result of the introduction of oral implants, it is also possible to treat patients who have a reduced occlusal system with implant-supported fixed dental prostheses. Many publications report the successful application of implant-supported single- and multi-unit fixed dental prostheses. However, it is questionable if implants are also successful in periodontally compromised patients. With respect to implant treatment, roughly 3 categories of periodontally compromised patients can be distinguished: patients who have not been treated for periodontitis, patients who have been treated for periodontitis and have stable periodontal health, and those who have been treated but have not achieved stable periodontal health. For the first group, periodontal treatment is required. Inserting implants is only indicated in cases showing steady improvement of post-operative periodontal health. The second category has no contraindication for inserting implants. For the third group, inserting implants is contraindicated absolutely. When treatment with oral implants is indicated, meticulous aftercare and a surgical treatment which enables adequate oral hygiene self-care are strict requirements.
The preprosthetic treatment is a phase of the so-called patient-centred oral healthcare cycle. The goal of the preprosthetic treatment is the elimination of pathological conditions and of uncertainties and risks to the greatest extent possible. Teeth in a reduced occlusal system can be distinguished functionally as strategic, non-strategic, and undesirable. The most important objective of the preprosthetic treatment is to establish a positive prognosis for the strategic teeth. Specific aspects relevant to the preprosthetic treatment are: referral to a specialist, requesting a second opinion, inserting 1 or more oral implants, transitional treatments, and occlusal adjustments. Subsequently, the preprosthetic treatment is evaluated to assess whether healthy circumstances have been established for the intended treatment with single- or multi-unit fixed dental prostheses.
This qualitative study explored barriers and enabling factors to the implementation of an oral hygiene protocol in nursing homes.
Oral health care in nursing homes in Flanders (Belgium) is inadequate.
Qualitative data were obtained from nurses employed in 13 nursing homes involved in two randomised controlled trials in Flanders-Belgium. Data were collected by focus group and face-to-face interviews during April 2005 and December 2009. All transcripts were analysed with support of NVivo 8 (Version 2008). Transcripts were intuitively analysed in a two-step method.
Most revealed barriers were consistent with previous findings in the literature. Newly reported barriers were respect for residents' self-determination, experience based oral health care by nurses, residents' oral health status and nurses' inability to notice residents' oral health status. Demand-driven oral health care was found to be a strong enabling factor.
The integration of oral health care into day-to-day care seems to be a major problem due to a multitude of barriers. In future implementation innovations in oral health care an a priori assessment of influencing factors is recommended.
The aim of this study was to investigate the metabolic risk factors for fatty liver disease in the elderly, and determine the prevalence of fatty liver disease in the elderly in Wuhan, central China.
The study was a case-control study based on all 4226 adults above 60 years of age from a cohort investigated in 2010-11 at the medical examination center of Zhongnan hospital, using 3145 randomly selected adults under 60 years of age from the same cohort as controls. Fatty liver disease (FLD) was identified with ultrasound imaging. The risk factors measured were body mass index (BMI), and plasma concentrations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and serum uric acid (SUA). The probability of steatohepatitis with advanced fibrosis was predicted using a score based on BMI, age, ALT, and TG (BAAT),and using AST/ALT ratio (AAR).
FLD was higher in the elderly (26.7%) than in the non-elderly (22.8%) and similar in the elderly between men and women (26.6% vs 27.0%, p&gt;0.05). BMI, TC, TG, LDL, SUA, AST and ALT were all significantly higher in FLD, whereas the level of HDL was markedly lower. Multiple regression analyses showed that obesity, high TC, TG, SUA, low HDL, and elevated ALT, AAR&lt;1 were closely related to the elderly FLD, while male sex, obesity, high TC, TG, low HDL, elevated ALT, AST and AAR&lt;1 were closely related to the non-elderly FLD. The prevalence of steatohepatitis with advanced fibrosis estimated as BAAT index≥3 was 2.4% in all subjects, and was higher in the elderly FLD patients than in the non-elderly FLD patients.
The prevalence of FLD is higher in the elderly, and is broadly related to the same metabolic risk factors as in the non-elderly. However, female-sex is no longer protective with increasing age, and the prevalence of steatohepatitis with advanced fibrosis is estimated to be considerably higher in the elderly FLD patients than in the non-elderly FLD controls.
This study examined the influence of self-perceived oral odour on social interaction. A representative sample of 1,082 people from the Dutch population of 16 years and older, were surveyed. On average, the participants graded their oral odour as 66.8 on a scale 0-100; 4.2% judged their oral odour as 'not fresh' (score &lt; or = 30). Approximately 65% indicated that they took into account the fact that, when meeting somebody for the first time, that person might smell their oral odour. Participants judging their oral odour to be not fresh were shown to keep significantly more distance when meeting somebody than participants judging their oral odour as fresh. Noteworthy was a subgroup of participants who judged their oral odour as fresh, but indicated that they always kept a certain distance to other people. The results suggest that self-perceived oral odour is a potential barrier in social interaction.
An occlusal system that does not function well, has a negative impact on the functional level of the oral system and the orofacial system. In purely mechanical terms, a limited anatomical reduction of the occlusal system has limited implications for the functional level since the occlusal system has several forms of adaptation, reserve, and compensation. However, following the loss of (parts of) teeth, an occlusal system may be anatomically reduced to such an extent that restoration of the functional level is required, for instance by the use of implant-supported single- and multiple-unit fixed dental prostheses. The mechanical strength of a tooth and a single-tooth fixed dental prosthesis on a similar tooth type is not essentially different. But the same cannot be said of the mechanical strength of a multiple-unit fixed dental prosthesis, because the strength is controlled by the mechanoreceptors in the periodontal ligaments of the abutment teeth. This control system is disturbed by the insufficiency of or, when oral implants are involved, the absence of mechano-receptors. It is unknown whether this is causing noticeable problems.
Bile acids (BAs) have many physiological roles and exhibit both toxic and protective influences within the liver. Alterations in the BA profile may be the result of disease induced liver injury. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a prevalent form of chronic liver disease characterized by the pathophysiological progression from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The hypothesis of this study is that the 'classical' (neutral) and 'alternative' (acidic) BA synthesis pathways are altered together with hepatic BA composition during progression of human NAFLD. This study employed the use of transcriptomic and metabolomic assays to study the hepatic toxicologic BA profile in progressive human NAFLD. Individual human liver samples diagnosed as normal, steatosis, and NASH were utilized in the assays. The transcriptomic analysis of 70 BA genes revealed an enrichment of downregulated BA metabolism and transcription factor/receptor genes in livers diagnosed as NASH. Increased mRNA expression of BAAT and CYP7B1 was observed in contrast to decreased CYP8B1 expression in NASH samples. The BA metabolomic profile of NASH livers exhibited an increase in taurine together with elevated levels of conjugated BA species, taurocholic acid (TCA) and taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA). Conversely, cholic acid (CA) and glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA) were decreased in NASH liver. These findings reveal a potential shift toward the alternative pathway of BA synthesis during NASH, mediated by increased mRNA and protein expression of CYP7B1. Overall, the transcriptomic changes of BA synthesis pathway enzymes together with altered hepatic BA composition signify an attempt by the liver to reduce hepatotoxicity during disease progression to NASH.
Phase II conjugating enzymes play key roles in the metabolism of xenobiotics. In the present study, RNA sequencing was used to elucidate hepatic ontogeny and tissue distribution of mRNA expression of all major known Phase II enzymes, including enzymes involved in glucuronidation, sulfation, glutathione conjugation, acetylation, methylation, and amino acid conjugation, as well as enzymes for the synthesis of Phase II cosubstrates, in male C57BL/6J mice. Livers from male C57BL/6J mice were collected at 12 ages from prenatal to adulthood. Many of these Phase II enzymes were expressed at much higher levels in adult livers than in perinatal livers, such as Ugt1a6b, -2a3, -2b1, -2b5, -2b36, -3a1, and -3a2; Gsta1, -m1, -p1, -p2, and -z1; mGst1; Nat8; Comt; Nnmt; Baat; Ugdh; and Gclc. In contrast, hepatic mRNA expression of a few Phase II enzymes decreased during postnatal liver development, such as mGst2, mGst3, Gclm, and Mat2a. Hepatic expression of certain Phase II enzymes peaked during the adolescent stage, such as Ugt1a1, Sult1a1, Sult1c2, Sult1d1, Sult2as, Sult5a1, Tpmt, Glyat, Ugp2, and Mat1a. In adult mice, the total transcripts for Phase II enzymes were comparable in liver, kidney, and small intestine; however, individual Phase II enzymes displayed marked tissue specificity among the three organs. In conclusion, this study unveils for the first time developmental changes in mRNA abundance of all major known Phase II enzymes in mouse liver, as well as their tissue-specific expression in key drug-metabolizing organs. The age- and tissue-specific expression of Phase II enzymes indicate that the detoxification of xenobiotics is highly regulated by age and cell type.
Treatment with glucocorticoids (GCs) may cause adverse effects, including cholestasis. The ability of dexamethasone, prednisolone and budesonide to affect the liver handling of bile acids (BAs) has been investigated. In rats treated with GCs for 4 days, altered serum and bile BA levels, changed conjugation pattern, and delayed and decreased ability to conjugate/secrete exogenously administered deoxycholate, were found using HPLC-MS/MS. RT-QPCR analyses revealed that GC treatment also induced a down-regulation of liver nuclear receptors (Fxr, Gr and Shp), transporters (Ntcp, Mrp4 and Bcrp) and enzymes (Cyp7a1 and Baat), whereas Bsep, Mrp2 and Cyp27a1 were up-regulated. Human HepG2 and Alexander cell lines were used as in vitro models of liver cells with and without constitutive FXR expression, respectively. In HepG2 cells, GCs induced a decreased expression of FXR and SHP, and inhibited the regulatory effect of GW4064 on FXR-target genes. In Alexander cells, only when they were transfected with FXR+RXR, GW4064 caused up-regulation of SHP and OSTβ, and a down-regulation of CYP27A1. GCs had the opposite effect on these genes, both in the absence and in the presence of FXR expression. Co-transfection of Alexander cells with IR-1-Luc and FXR+RXR revealed that GCs did not inhibit but moderately enhanced FXR activity. Moreover, GCs have a synergistic effect on GW4064-induced FXR activation, whereas chenodeoxycholate and GW4064 have an additive effect. In conclusion, GCs are able to directly or indirectly activate FXR but they also antagonize, through FXR-independent mechanisms, the expression of FXR and FXR target genes involved in the hepatic handling of BAs.
In congenital scoliosis, an anatomical spine deformity arose during embryonic vertebral development which caused a deformity. Approximately 38-55% of these deformities appear as a syndrome. Prognosis and preferred treatment depend on the type offailure and the severity of the deformity, but surgical correction is often necessary. Neuromuscular scoliosis generally arises at a young age, is often rapidly progressive, and the magnitude of the curve can also progress even in adulthood. The prognosis of the curve together with the symptoms and prognosis of the associated neuromuscular condition determine the preferred treatment. The goal of surgical treatment is to improve the patient's quality of life. Two types of adult scoliosis occur: adult idiopathic scoliosis and adult degenerative scoliosis. The surgical principles for adult idiopathic scoliosis are almost identical to those for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. In degenerative scoliosis, there is almost always a shorter fusion length. In the case of neurologic impairments, decompression of the spinal cord or nerve roots should be carried out.
In high altitude Andean streams an intense solar radiation and coinciding metal pollution allow the persistence of only a few specialized taxa, including chironomids. The aim of the present study was therefore to determine the mechanisms underlying the persistence of chironomids under these multiple stress conditions, hypothesizing that melanin counteracts both the adverse effects of solar radiation and of metals. Melanin was determined in chironomids from reference and metal polluted streams at 3000 and 4000 m altitude, being 2-fold higher at 4000 m compared to 3000 m, and 2-fold higher in polluted streams than in reference streams at both altitudes. The field observations were experimentally verified by assessing the combined effects of Cu and UV-B on the survival and melanin concentration in larvae of the model species Chironomus riparius (Chironomidae, Diptera). In laboratory exposures, the highest melanin concentrations were found in larvae surviving toxic Cu concentrations, but not in those exposed to the highest UV-B radiation. Pre-exposure to UV-B decreased the sensitivity of the larvae to UV-B and to Cu+UV-B. It is concluded that in the field, melanin may protect chironomids partially against both elevated metal concentrations and solar radiation, allowing them to persist under the harshest conditions in high altitude streams.
Blunt abdominal aortic trauma (BAAT) is a very rare occurrence in children, with significant morbidity and mortality. Varied clinical presentations and sparse literature evidence make it difficult to define the proper management policy for paediatric patients.
We report our centre's data on three consecutive children with BAAT managed between 2006 and 2010. A Medline search was also performed for relevant publications since 1966, together with a review of references in retrieved publications.
Forty children (range 1-16 years) were included in our final analysis. Motor vehicle crashes (MVC) were the leading cause of injury (65%). The in-hospital mortality rate was 7.5% (3/40). Nine patients (22.5%) ended up with residual sequelae. Main primary aortic lesions were complete wall rupture (12.5%), intimal transection (70%) and pseudoaneurysm (15%). Twenty-eight children underwent aortic surgical repair (70%). Among the 12 non-operatively managed patients, 41.6% had complications, including one death.
Symptomatic lesions and complete ruptures should undergo immediate surgical repair. Circumferential intimal transections are at high risk of complication and should also receive intervention. Partial intimal transections and delayed pseudoaneurysms can be initially observed by clinical examination and imaging. Patients with these latter pathologies should be operated on at any sign of deterioration.
A scoliosis is a flexible or rigid deformity of the spine in the frontal plane. There are several types of scoliosis, each with specific characteristics. The most prevalent types are idiopathic, congenital, and neuromuscular scoliosis and scoliosis in adults. The aetiology is varied and largely undetermined. Essential components of diagnostics are patient history, physical examination, and radiographs. Treatment options are a conservative approach involving observation and follow-up, a conservative approach involving non-surgical treatment, and surgical treatment. Usually, idiopathic scoliosis causes no or only few complaints at a young age. Up to 35% of patients have a certain degree of back pain. The choice of a certain treatment is determined by the likelihood of progression of the spine deformity. The objective of brace treatment is preventing progression of the deformity. Important objectives of surgical treatment are preventing progression of the deformity and correcting the deformity with correction or preservation of physical equilibrium.
Using a representative sample from the Dutch population, some psychosocial aspects of halitosis were examined. The results of the survey showed that almost 90% of the Dutch population aged 16 years and older were regularly faced with halitosis. Forty percent reported to be exposed to someone with halitosis at least once a week, men significantly more frequently than women. Although less strongly than body odour, halitosis was reported as being one of the most severe 'let-downs' in social interactions. The greater the social distance between subjects, the less likely is the chance that a person's attention will be drawn to halitosis experienced. When it comes to an unknown person, the chance was no more than 7%, suggesting that it is problematic to draw a person's attention to the presence of halitosis. Considering the potential social consequences of halitosis is it important that dentists and dental hygienists draw patients' attention to the presence of halitosis, when this is the case, thereby encouraging them to seek adequate treatment.
The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a supervised implementation of the "Oral health care Guideline for Older people in Long-term care Institutions" (OGOLI) in The Netherlands.
A sample of 12 care homes in the Netherlands was allocated randomly to an intervention or control group. While the residents in the control group received oral health care as before, the intervention consisted of a supervised implementation of the OGOLI.
At baseline, the overall random sample comprised 342 residents, 52 % in the intervention group and 48 % in the control group. At 6 months, significant differences were observed between the intervention and the control group for mean dental as well as denture plaque, with a beneficial effect for the intervention group. The multilevel mixed-model analyses conducted with the plaque scores at 6 months as outcome variables showed that the reduction by the intervention was only significant for denture plaque.
Supervised implementation of the OGOLI was more effective than non-supervised implementation in terms of reducing mean plaque scores at 6 months. However, the multilevel mixed-model analysis could not exclusively explain the reduction of mean dental plaque scores by the intervention.
A supervised implementation of an oral health care guideline improves oral health of care home residents.
The academic dental education in The Netherlands has been extended to 6 years, among other reasons in order to make it possible for responsibility for oral healthcare to be borne in a wide medical context. It is the job of the 3 national dental schools to make this happen. The new dentist should know and recognize all (peri-)oral disorders and oral symptoms of systemic diseases, and he should be able to deliver oral healthcare to medically compromised patients. Accepting this responsibility is required for dentistry to be transformed into medical oral healthcare and for dentists to be upgraded to oral physicians.
To systematically review the literature on oral health care interventions in frail older people and the effect on the incidence of aspiration pneumonia.
Oral health care seems to play an important role in the prevention of aspiration pneumonia in frail older people.
Pubmed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and CINAHL were searched for eligible intervention studies. Only publications with regard to hospitalized or institutionalized older people, who were not dependent on mechanical ventilation were eligible. Two authors independently assessed the publications for their methodological quality.
Five publications were included and reviewed. Two studies showed that improvement of oral health care diminished the risk of developing aspiration pneumonia and the risk of dying from aspiration pneumonia directly. The three studies remaining showed that adequate oral health care decreased the amount of potential respiratory pathogens and suggested a reduction in the risk of aspiration pneumonia by improving the swallowing reflex and cough reflex sensitivity.
According to the results of the current systematic literature review oral health care, consisting of tooth brushing after each meal, cleaning dentures once a day, and professional oral health care once a week, seems the best intervention to reduce the incidence of aspiration pneumonia.
Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a human rights violation that is pervasive worldwide, and is particularly critical for women during the reproductive period. IPV includes physical, sexual and emotional abuse. Nurses on in-patient postpartum units are well-positioned to screen women for IPV, yet low screening rates suggest that barriers to screening exist. The purpose of this study was to (a) identify the frequency of screening for IPV, (b) the most important barriers to screening, (c) the relationship between the barriers to screening and the frequency of screening for types of abuse, and (d) to identify other factors that contribute to the frequency of screening for IPV.
In 2008, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of 96 nurses from postpartum inpatient units in three Canadian urban hospitals. The survey included the Barriers to Abuse Assessment Tool (BAAT), adapted for postpartum nurses (PPN). Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models were used to predict barriers to screening for each type of IPV.
The frequency of screening varied by the type of abuse with highest screening rates found for physical and emotional abuse. According to the BAAT-PPN, lack of knowledge was the most important barrier to screening. The BAAT-PPN total score was negatively correlated with screening for physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. Using OLS regression models and after controlling for demographic characteristics, the BAAT-PPN explained 14%, 12%, and 11% of the variance in screening for physical, sexual and emotional abuse, respectively. Fluency in the language of the patient was negatively correlated with screening for each type of abuse. When added as Step 3 to OLS regression models, language fluency was associated with an additional decrease in the likelihood of screening for physical (beta coefficient = -.38, P &lt; .001), sexual (beta coefficient = -.24, P = .05), and emotional abuse (beta coefficient = -.48, P &lt; .001) and increased the variance explained by the model to 25%, 17%, and 31%, respectively.
Our findings support an inverse relationship between rates of screening for IPV and nurses' perceptions of barriers. Barriers to screening for IPV, particularly related to knowledge and language fluency, need to be addressed to increase rates of screening on postpartum units.
The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been increasing. This study aimed to assess the recent prevalence of NAFLD and to predict the prevalence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with liver fibrosis using established scoring systems in the general population.
A cross-sectional study was conducted among 8352 subjects who received health checkups from 2009 to 2010 in three health centers in Japan. Subjects with an intake over 20 g of alcohol/day or with other chronic liver diseases were excluded. Fatty liver was detected by ultrasonography. The probability of NASH with advanced fibrosis was calculated according to the body mass index, age, ALT, and triglyceride (BAAT) and FIB-4 (based on age, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels, and platelet counts) indices.
A total of 5075 subjects were enrolled. The overall prevalence of NAFLD was 29.7%. There was a significant threefold difference in the mean prevalence between males (41.0%) and females (17.7%). This prevalence showed a linear increase with body mass index, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol regardless of threshold values, even without obesity. The estimated prevalence of NASH according to the BAAT index ≥3 was 2.7%, and according to the FIB-4 index it was 1.9%.
The prevalence of NAFLD has increased in the general population, especially in males. There is a linear relationship between the prevalence of NAFLD and various metabolic parameters, even in nonobese subjects. The prevalence of NASH with advanced fibrosis is estimated to be considerably high in subjects with NAFLD.
Fabricating removable complete dentures is a rather complicated treatment. The quality of the care delivered is broadly determined by 2 factors: the technical result and the way in which the individual patient experiences and evaluates the treatment. Healthcare professionals who carry out this treatment are subject, with respect to their capability, to the Dutch Individual Healthcare Professions Act. In cases of persisting complaints or problems, edentulous individuals are often treated with an overdenture on oral implants. Several oral healthcare providers are then involved in the treatment. In order to clarify procedures, a trajectory of care is presented in which all of these oral healthcare providers are located. It is expected that the number of edentulous individuals will decline and that the degree of treatment complexity will increase. To guarantee future efficiency and quality of care delivery, a number of regionally distributed national centres of expertise should be established.
On the advice of the National Health Care Institute in the Netherlands and the institute's Board of Scientific Advisors, the minister of Health, Welfare and Sport decides whether a certain drug will or will not be included in the list of drugs covered by the basic health insurance plan mandated for all Dutch citizens. In making this decision emphasis is placed on the therapeutic value of that particular drug compared to that of the standard drug for that disorder, the impact that the inclusion of the drug would have on the budget and the drug's cost-effectiveness. In the case of disorders that do not respond or respond insufficiently to the standard treatment, however, one comes up against the limitations of this system and in some cases a necessary treatment is not reimbursed. With respect to prescribing medications, dentists are qualified to prescribe, provided they are enrolled in the so-called BIG register [that recognises the qualifications of healthcare professionals in the Netherlands]. Dental hygienists, by contrast, are not qualified to prescribe and have to limit themselves to at most recommending over-the-counter medicines. In prescribing medicines, dentists are of course limited to those about which they have comprehensive knowledge and sufficient experience. If a dentist wants to prescibe a drug that is outside his or her own experience, then he or she should consult with an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, general practitioner or medical specialist to determine whether the medication can be prescribed and if so, by whom.
Geadviseerd door het Zorginstituut Nederland en de Wetenschappelijke Adviesraad van dit instituut beslist de minister van Volksgezondheid, Welzijn en Sport of een medicament wel of niet wordt opgenomen in het basispakket van de verplichte zorgverzekering. Bij deze beoordeling ligt de nadruk op de therapeutische waarde ten opzicht van de in Nederland geldende standaardbehandeling, de budgetimpact en de kosteneffectiviteit. Bij aandoeningen die niet of onvoldoende reageren op een standaardbehandeling loopt men echter tegen de grenzen van dit systeem aan en wordt een noodzakelijke behandeling in voorkomende gevallen niet vergoed. Met betrekking tot het voorschrijven van medicatie hebben tandartsen receptuurbevoegdheid zolang zij in het BIG-register staan ingeschreven; daarentegen hebben mondhygiënisten geen receptuurbevoegdheid en moeten zich beperken tot het hooguit adviseren van vrij verkrijgbare medicamenten. Bij het voorschrijven moeten tandartsen zich uiteraard beperken tot die medicamenten waarvan zij de werking overzien en waarmee zij voldoende ervaring hebben opgebouwd. Mocht een tandarts vinden dat het medicament dat hij wil voorschrijven zijn kennis te boven gaat, dan kan het beste met een mond-, kaak- en aangezichtschirurg, huisarts of medisch specialist worden overlegd of dit medicament kan worden voorgeschreven en zo ja, door wie.
One-third of community-dwelling people older than 65 years of age fall each year, and half of them fall at least twice a year. Older care home residents are approximately three times more likely to fall when compared to community-dwelling older people. Risk indicators for falls are related to the older people's body, environment, behavior, and activities. An important health risk indicator is (orthostatic or postprandial) hypotension, which may induce cerebral hypoperfusion. Although the majority of falls remain without major consequences, 10% to 25% of falls in care homes result in bodily trauma. Prevalent fall-related injuries are brain injury, lower extremity fracture including hip fracture and forearm/wrist fracture, facial fracture, humeral fracture, and rib/scapular fracture. As fall accidents by older people can have severe consequences, prevention of falls is of paramount importance. Healthcare providers, including oral healthcare providers, should inform older people on risks of falling and draw attention to potentially hazardous arrangements.
Many patients who visit a dentist, oral hygienist or other oral healthcare provider use medicines. As a result of the ageing of the Dutch population, the number of patients using medicines will further increase, including the number of patients who are using more than one medicine. In addition to medicines, many patients, including healthy individuals, use self-care medications. Both medicines and self-care medications can interfere with dental treatment and/or may serve as an explanation for changes that dentists, oral hygienists or other oral healthcare providers observe in and around the mouth. With a series of articles about medicines and oral healthcare, attention will be given to this issue, an issue that will be increasingly important in the future. In addition, suggestions will be made in these articles for medicines for disorders in the head and neck region, keeping in mind that these suggestions should not be seen as dogmatic.
Veel patiënten die tandartsen, mondhygiënisten of andere mondzorgverleners bezoeken, gebruiken medicamenten. Door de vergrijzing van de Nederlandse bevolking zal dit aantal verder toenemen, inclusief het aantal patiënten dat meerdere medicamenten gebruikt. Naast medicamenten gebruiken veel patiënten, maar ook gezonde personen, zelfzorgmiddelen. Zowel de gebruikte medicamenten als zelfzorgmiddelen kunnen consequenties hebben voor een tandheelkundige behandeling en/of kunnen een verklaring zijn voor veranderingen die tandartsen, mondhygiënisten en overige mondzorgverleners in en rond de mond waarnemen. Met een serie artikelen over medicatie en mondzorg wordt aandacht geschonken aan deze problematiek, een problematiek waarvan het belang met de tijd alleen maar zal toenemen. Daarnaast zullen in deze artikelen suggesties worden gedaan voor medicamenten voor aandoeningen in het hoofd-halsgebied, waarbij de keuze voor een bepaald medicament niet als dogmatisch moet worden gezien.
The farnesoid X receptor (Fxr) controls bile acid homeostasis by coordinately regulating the expression of synthesizing enzymes (Cyp7a1, Cyp8b1), conjugating enzymes (Bal, Baat) and transporters in the ileum (Asbt, Ostα/β) and liver (Ntcp, Bsep, Ostβ). Transcriptional regulation by Fxr can be direct, or through the ileal Fgf15/FGF19 and hepatic Shp pathways. Circulating bile acids are increased during pregnancy due to hormone-mediated disruption of Fxr signaling. While this adaptation enhances lipid absorption, elevated bile acids may predispose women to develop maternal cholestasis. The objective of this study was to determine whether short-term treatment of pregnant mice with GW4064 (a potent FXR agonist) restores Fxr signaling to the level observed in virgin mice. Plasma, liver and ilea were collected from virgin and pregnant mice administered vehicle or GW4064 by oral gavage. Treatment of pregnant mice with GW4064 induced ileal Fgf15, Shp and Ostα/β mRNAs, and restored hepatic Shp, Bal, Ntcp, and Bsep back to vehicle-treated virgin levels. Pregnant mice exhibited 2.5-fold increase in Cyp7a1 mRNA compared to virgin controls, which was reduced by GW4064. Similarly treatment of mouse primary hepatocytes with plasma isolated from pregnant mice induced Cyp7a1 mRNA by nearly 3-fold as compared to virgin plasma, which could be attenuated by co-treatment with either GW4064 or recombinant FGF19 protein. Collectively, these data reveal that repressed activity of intestinal and hepatic Fxr in pregnancy, as previously demonstrated, may be restored by pharmacological activation. This study provides the basis for a novel approach to restore bile acid homeostasis in patients with maternal cholestasis.
There is an urgent need for reliable and universally applicable outcome measures for children with mitochondrial diseases. In this study, we aimed to adapt the currently available Newcastle Paediatric Mitochondrial Disease Scale (NPMDS) to the International Paediatric Mitochondrial Disease Scale (IPMDS) during a Delphi-based process with input from international collaborators, patients and caretakers, as well as a pilot reliability study in eight patients. Subsequently, we aimed to test the feasibility, construct validity and reliability of the IPMDS in a multicentre study.
A clinically, biochemically and genetically heterogeneous group of 17 patients (age 1.6-16 years) from five different expert centres from four different continents were evaluated in this study.
The feasibility of the IPMDS was good, as indicated by a low number of missing items (4 %) and the positive evaluation of patients, parents and users. Principal component analysis of our small sample identified three factors, which explained 57.9 % of the variance. Good construct validity was found using hypothesis testing. The overall interrater reliability was good [median intraclass correlation coefficient for agreement between raters (ICCagreement) 0.85; range 0.23-0.99).
In conclusion, we suggest using the IPMDS for assessing natural history in children with mitochondrial diseases. These data should be used to further explore construct validity of the IPMDS and to set age limits. In parallel, responsiveness and the minimal clinically important difference should be studied to facilitate sample size calculations in future clinical trials.
To prevent the development of adiposity-associated metabolic diseases, early biomarkers are needed. Such markers could bring insight to understand the complexity of susceptibility to obesity. Urine and plasma metabolomics fingerprints have been successfully associated with metabolic dysfunctions. Fat resistance (FR) was found to be associated with higher urinary levels of acylglycines and leucine. However, no differences were observed before the diet switch. In this context, we aimed at characterizing metabolic signatures predictive of resistance or sensitivity to fat in the C57Bl6/J mouse model. Urinary metabolic profiles of FR (n=15) and fat sensitivity (FS) mice (n=14) were performed on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Urinary and plasma metabolic profiles were first collected at baseline (during low-fat diet), then after 10weeks of high-fat (HF) feeding. Mice were sorted a posteriori into FS and FR based on their final adiposity. After HF feeding for 10weeks, FS mice tended to have lower plasma levels of β-hydroxybutyrate than FR ones. Urinary metabolic profiles showed that baseline levels of octanoylglycine, leucine and valine were significantly lower in FS mice. Moreover, expressions in the adipose tissue of Baat and Glyat mRNA were lower in FS than in FR mice. In muscle, mRNA encoding CaD and UbE2b tended to be lower in FS mice than in FR mice (P=.056 and P=.071, respectively). The data show that lower levels of urinary octanoylglycine, leucine and valine are potential predictive biomarkers of FS and could be related to a lower stimulation in adipose acyl-coenzyme A conjugation to glycine and to muscle protein breakdown.
Depression is a complex disease characterized by a series of pathological changes. Research on depression is mainly focused on the changes in brain, but not on liver. Therefore, we initially explored the metabolic profiles of hepatic extracts from rats treated with chronic unpredictive mild stress (CUMS) by UPLC-Q-TOF/MS. Using multivariate statistical analysis, a total of 26 altered metabolites distinguishing CUMS-induced depression from normal control were identified. Using two-stage receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, 18 metabolites were recognized as potential biomarkers related to CUMS-induced depression via 12 metabolic pathways. Subsequently, we detected the mRNA expressions levels of apoptosis-associated genes such as Bax and Bcl-2 and four key enzymes including Pla2g15, Pnpla6, Baat and Gad1 involved in phospholipid and primary bile acid biosynthesis in liver tissues of CUMS rats by real-time qRT-PCR assay. The expression levels of Bax, Bcl-2, Pla2g15, Pnpla6 and Gad1 mRNA were 1.43,1.68, 1.74, 1.67 and 1.42-fold higher, and those of Baat, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio mRNA were 0.83, 0.85-fold lower in CUMS rats compared with normal control. Results of liver-targeted metabonomics and mRNA expression demonstrated that CUMS-induced depression leads to variations in hepatic metabolic profile and gene expression, and ultimately results in liver injury. 
Fibromyalgia is a syndrome without apparent aetiology, characterised by pain, fatigue, memory disorders, mood disorders, and sleep disturbances. The syndrome is considered to be one of the rheumatic diseases. In the general population, the prevalence varies from 2 to 8%, with a women-men ratio of about 2:1. Suspicion of fibromyalgia arises when a patient has pain at multiple locations that cannot be attributed to trauma or inflammation, and when the pain is especially musculoskeletal. Primary management includes explaining the syndrome and offering reassurance. In addition, one can also attempt to increase mobility, avoid overloading, and improve physical condition and the level of activity, and to activate problem-solving skills. Subsequently, behavioural therapy and pharmacotherapy may be considered. The most important manifestations of fibromyalgia in the orofacial and occlusal system seem to be temporomandibular dysfunction, headache, xerostomia, hyposalivation, burning mouth and dysgeusia. However, with respect to the precise relation of fibromyalgia with the orofacial system, much needs to be elucidated. 
Fibromyalgie is een syndroom zonder aanwijsbare etiologie dat wordt gekenmerkt door pijn, vermoeidheid, geheugenproblemen, stemmingsproblemen en slaapstoornissen. Het syndroom wordt gerekend tot de reumatische aandoeningen. De prevalentie in de algemene bevolking varieert van 2 tot 8%, met een vrouw-manratio van ongeveer 2:1. Verdenking op fibromyalgie ontstaat als een patiënt meerdere pijnlocaties heeft die niet kunnen worden verklaard door een trauma of een ontsteking en als het vooral musculoskelettale pijn betreft. Uitleg en geruststelling zijn de primaire benaderingswijzen. Aanvullend kan men streven naar meer mobiliteit, vermijden van overbelasting, verbetering van lichamelijke conditie en activiteitenniveau en stimulering van probleemoplossend vermogen. Vervolgens kan gedragsbeïnvloeding en medicatie worden overwogen. De belangrijkste manifestaties in het orofaciale systeem en het occlusiesysteem lijken temporomandibulaire disfunctie, hoofdpijn, xerostomie, hyposialie, mondbranden en dysgeusie. Over de exacte relaties tussen fibromyalgie en het orofaciale systeem en het occlusiesysteem valt echter nog veel te leren.
Complications after surgical stabilization for the treatment of unstable spinal metastases are common. Less invasive surgical (LIS) procedures are potentially associated with a lower risk of complications; however, little is known regarding the complications after LIS procedures for the treatment of spinal metastases. Our primary objective was to determine the characteristics and rate of complications after percutaneous pedicle screw fixation (PPSF) for the treatment of mechanically unstable spinal metastases. The secondary objective was to identify factors associated with the occurrence of complications and survival.
A retrospective multicenter cohort study of patients who underwent PPSF between 2009 and 2014 for the treatment of unstable spinal metastases was performed. Patient data pertaining to demographics, diagnosis, treatment, neurologic function, complications, and survival were collected.
A total of 101 patients were identified, 45 men (45 %) and 56 women (55 %) with a mean age of 60.3 ± 11.2 years. The median operating time was 122 (range 57-325) minutes with a median blood loss of 100 ml (based on 41 subjects). Eighty-eight patients (87 %) ambulated within the first 3 days after surgery. An overall median survival of 11.0 (range 0-70) months was observed, with 79 % of the patients alive at 3 months after treatment. Eighteen patients experienced a total of 30 complications; nonsurgical complications were the most commonly encountered. Prolonged operating time was independently associated with an increased risk of complications.
A complication rate of 18 % was found after PPSF for unstable spinal metastases. Potential advantages of less invasive treatment are limited blood loss and high early ambulation rate.
To determine the impact of self-perceived halitosis on social interactions, and the effect of using an oral rinse for management of halitosis.
A survey among a representative sample of the Dutch population (n = 1082), and a pre-post study among a sample of consecutive coming-by volunteers (n = 292).
Participants of the representative sample rated their oral odor as 66.8 ± 17.2 and the consecutive volunteers as 70.9 ± 16.7 (range: 0-100). Sizable proportions (15.3 % and 38.1 %, respectively) indicated to always take into account their (bad) oral odor when meeting a person for the first time. The worse people perceived their oral odor, the more likely they were to take into account to keep a certain distance. Following the use of the oral rinse, a significant decline was found of the extent to which the participants reported to take into account their oral odor when meeting a person for the first time. Both studies identified a subgroup of individuals (9.1 % and 28.1 % respectively) who reported to keep a certain distance when meeting other people, despite a "fresh" self-perceived oral odor.
The results suggest that self-perceived oral odor negatively affects social interactions, and that adequate management of halitosis has the potential to improve such interactions.
In nursing home residents, it is not possible to distinguish pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia clinically. International literature reveals no consensus on which and how many characteristics and risk indicators must be present to diagnose (nursing home-acquired) pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia. The aim of this survey was to reach consensus among a panel of clinical medical experts in geriatrics and pulmonology about the characteristics required for diagnosing pneumonia, and about the risk indicators needed to consider the diagnosis aspiration pneumonia in nursing home residents with pneumonia.
Literature review and three expert-rating iterations using the electronically-modified Delphi Method were carried out. After each expert rating iteration, data analysis was performed. Qualitative responses and additional (nursing home-acquired) pneumonia characteristics which were mentioned in reply to structured open-ended questions were summarised, whilst similar responses were combined and these combinations were ordered by frequency in order to use them in the next iteration. Characteristics which failed to reach consensus were considered as inconclusive and eliminated. Consensus was reached when at least 70 % of the participants agreed.
Literature review revealed 16 currently used common characteristics for diagnosing (nursing home-acquired) pneumonia. No consensus was reached about characteristics and the number of characteristics required for diagnosing (nursing home-acquired) pneumonia. However, 57 % agreed that dyspnea, fever, deterioration of general functioning, tachypnea and crepitation with auscultation are the most important characteristics and the responses by the participants suggested that two or three characteristics should be present. Subsequently, 80 % of the participants agreed on the risk indicators dysphagia, choking incident, (history of) tube feeding, neurological disease and cognitive impairment for considering the diagnosis aspiration pneumonia in nursing home residents with pneumonia.
No final consensus could be reached about which and how many characteristics are required for diagnosing pneumonia in nursing home residents. However, the results indicated that dyspnea, fever, deterioration of general functioning, tachypnea and crepitation with auscultation are characteristics of some importance and that at least two or three characteristics should be present. With regard to considering aspiration pneumonia in nursing home residents with pneumonia, final consensus was reached about the risk indicators dysphagia, choking incident, (history of) tube feeding, neurological disease and cognitive impairment.
The objective of Atraumatic Restorative Treatment is to prevent carious lesion development and to stop its progression. This can be achieved, among other ways, by placing high-viscosity glass-ionomer cement sealants in pits and fissures in the enamel. A second area of utilisation is the treatment of dentine carious lesions. The weakened demineralised dentine can effectively be removed using hand instruments only. An accurately placed sealant-restoration prevents remaining cariogenic bacteria from reigniting the process of decay and allows the residual carious dentine to remineralise. To achieve good results using Atraumatic Restorative Treatment, an oral healthcare provider should complete a programme of instruction and have command of sufficient knowledge of cariology, the principles of treatment and the available restorative materials. High-viscosity glass-ionomer cement is the material of first choice for the prevention of enamel caries and the treatment of dentine carious lesions, but there is a constant search for improvements to this material and for a qualitatively better alternative. 
Het doel van de Atraumatic Restorative Treatment behelst het voorkomen van cariëslaesies en het stoppen van progressie ervan. Dit gebeurt onder andere door het verzegelen van putten en fissuren in glazuur met een glasionomeercement met een hoge viscositeitsgraad. Een tweede toepassingsgebied is de behandeling van dentinecariës. Het verweekte gedemineraliseerde dentine kan met handinstrumenten effectief worden verwijderd. Een zorgvuldig aangebrachte verzegelde restauratie zorgt ervoor dat achtergebleven cariogene bacteriën het cariësproces niet kunnen doen opvlammen en dat achtergebleven gedemineraliseerd dentine kan remineraliseren. Om goede resultaten met de Atraumatic Restorative Treatment te bereiken dient een zorgverlener een opleiding te volgen en over voldoende kennis te beschikken van de cariologie, de behandelprincipes en de beschikbare restauratiematerialen. Glasionomeercement met een hoge viscositeitsgraad is voor de preventie van glazuurcariës en de behandeling van dentinecariës het restauratiemateriaal van eerste keus, maar er wordt voortdurend gezocht naar verbetering van dit materiaal en naar een kwalitatief beter alternatief.
Pneumonia is an important cause of death in care home residents. Dysphagia and poor oral health are significant risk factors for developing aspiration pneumonia. Oral hygiene care reduces the number of oral bacteria and the risk of aspiration pneumonia. However, it is not clear yet which oral hygiene care intervention is most efficacious in reducing the risk of aspiration pneumonia. The aim of the study is to assess whether the application of a 0.05% chlorhexidine-containing solution in addition to the usual daily oral hygiene care reduces the incidence of pneumonia in physically disabled care home residents with dysphagia.
The study was designed as a multicentre cluster randomised controlled clinical trial, with care homes as units of randomisation. During 1 year, 500 physically disabled care home residents with dysphagia will be followed. The intervention consists of applying a 0.05% chlorhexidine-containing solution twice daily, immediately after the usual oral hygiene care, whereas the control group receives no application after the usual oral hygiene care. The primary outcome is the incidence of pneumonia diagnosed by a physician, using a set of strictly described criteria. The effect of the intervention on the incidence of pneumonia will be determined using a Cox regression analysis. The secondary outcomes are correlations between incidence of pneumonia, age, gender, diagnosed diseases, dysphagia severity, care dependency, actually used medication, number of teeth and implants present and the presence of removable dentures.
Ethical approval was obtained from the Medical Ethical Committee of Radboud university medical centre: NL.nr: 41990.091.12. Written and informed consent will be obtained from all participating care homes and residents. The study's findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals.
The trial has been registered in the Netherlands in the National Trial Register: TC=3515.
In non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, presence of fibrosis is predictive of long-term liver-related complications. Currently, there are no reliable and non-invasive means of quantifying fibrosis in those with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the performance of a panel of non-invasive models in predicting fibrosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
The accuracy of FibroMeter non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, fibrosis 4 and four other non-invasive models in predicting fibrosis in those with biopsy proven non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was compared. These models were constructed post hoc in patients who had necessary clinical information collected within 2 months of a liver biopsy. The areas under receiver operating characteristics curves were compared for each model using Delong analysis. Optimum cut-off for each model and fibrosis stage were calculated using the Youden index.
The area under receiver operating characteristics curves for F ≥ 1 fibrosis for fibrosis 4 and FibroMeter non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was 0.821 and 0.801 respectively. For F ≥ 3, the area under receiver operating characteristics curves was 0.866 for fibrosis 4 and 0.862 for FibroMeter non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Delong analysis showed the area under receiver operating characteristics curves was statistically different for fibrosis 4 and FibroMeter non-alcoholic fatty liver disease compared with BARD, BAAT and aspartate aminotransferase:alanine aminotransferase ratio for F ≥ 1 and F ≥ 3. Area under receiver operating characteristics curves were significantly different for fibrosis 4 and FibroMeter non-alcoholic fatty liver disease for F ≥ 3 compared with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score. At a fixed sensitivity of 90%, FibroMeter non-alcoholic fatty liver disease had the highest specificity for F ≥ 1 (52.4%) and F ≥ 3 (63.8%). In contrast, at a fixed specificity of 90%, fibrosis 4 outperformed other models with a sensitivity of 60.2% for F ≥ 1 and 70.6% for F ≥ 3 fibrosis.
These non-invasive models of fibrosis can predict varying degrees of fibrosis from routinely collected clinical information in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
In 1990, the thesis 'Removable complete dentures in older people, an issue dealing with adaptability?' was published. Among other things, this thesis aimed at finding a method of measuring older people's adaptability to removable complete dentures. Its conclusion was that a subscale of the "Beoordelingsschaal voor Oudere Patiënten" (Rating scale for older patients) had predictive value. Subsequently, only a few research projects on this topic have been carried out. They dealt with demonstrated adaptation achieved after treatment, the realised adaptation. The results were disappointing. Ever since the availability of endosseous oral implants, research into adaptability to conventional removable complete dentures seems less relevant. During the last decades, inquiries into a method of measuring treatment effectiveness has focused on older people's quality of life and general health condition. However, to assess with respect to oral health care an older person's general health condition and load-taking capacity adequately, some experience is indispensable. 
In 1990 verscheen het proefschrift ‘Een kunstgebit bij ouderen, een kwestie van aanpassen?’. Het onderzoek dat er aan ten grondslag lag, betrof onder andere het vinden van een meetinstrument voor het aanpassingsvermogen van ouderen aan volledige gebitsprothesen. De conclusie was dat een subschaal van de Beoordelingsschaal voor Oudere Patiënten voorspellende waarde had. Hierna zijn over dit onderwerp slechts enkele nieuwe onderzoeken uitgevoerd. Die gingen over de aangetoonde aanpassing achteraf, de gerealiseerde aanpassing. De resultaten waren teleurstellend. Omdat sinds de beschikbaarheid van orale implantaten veel implantaatgedragen gebitsprothesen zijn vervaardigd, lijkt onderzoek naar het aanpassingsvermogen aan volledige gebitsprothesen ook minder relevant. Het zoeken naar een meetinstrument voor de doelmatigheid van behandelingen heeft zich in de laatste decennia vooral gericht op de levenskwaliteit en op de algemene conditie van een oudere. Om in de mondzorg tot een goede beoordeling van de algemene conditie en daarmee van de belastbaarheid van een oudere te komen, is ervaring echter onontbeerlijk.
In 1989, the dissertation 'Oral self-care for dentate elderly' was published. Among other things, the effect of an information leaflet on oral self-care was investigated in a randomised, controlled trial. The outcome of the entire intervention was positive. Subsequent to this dissertation no comparable research has been carried out in the Netherlands or abroad. Nevertheless, concerns remain about the oral self-care of dentate older people. To improve the oral (self-)care of nursing home residents, carers should be educated theoretically and practically, preferably during their professional training. With regard to older people living at home, oral healthcare providers should assess whether their oral health condition will be stable for the rest of their life, at the latest when their general health condition is beginning to deteriorate. Determining factors in this regard are a stable dentition that can easily be kept clean, particularly when oral implants are present. As soon as older people who are living at home become dependent, they will require support. Oral health care providers should, then, make sure that their practices physically accessible and should be prepared to deliver care at home. 
In 1989 verscheen het proefschrift ‘Orale zelfzorg voor dentate ouderen’. Onder andere een informatiebrochure over orale zelfzorg werd getest in een gerandomiseerd gecontroleerd onderzoek. De uitkomst van de gehele interventie was positief. Na dit promotie­onderzoek is in Nederland en daarbuiten geen vergelijkbaar onderzoek uitgevoerd. Toch zijn er zorgen over de orale zelfzorg van dentate ouderen. Voor een betere mondverzorging van verpleeghuisbewoners moeten verzorgenden theoretisch en praktisch worden onderwezen, het liefst al tijdens hun opleiding. Voor thuiswonende ouderen geldt dat mondzorgverleners moeten beoordelen of de mondgezondheid levensduurbestendig is ultimo het moment dat zich een achteruitgang in de medische conditie aandient. Centrale factoren hierbij zijn stabiliteit en reinigbaarheid van de dentitie, ook en vooral als deze is aangevuld met orale implantaten. Zodra bij thuiswonende ouderen sprake is van zorgafhankelijkheid moeten zij worden ondersteund, waarbij mondzorgverleners moeten zorgen voor goede fysieke toegankelijk van hun praktijken en bereidheid tonen thuiszorg te verlenen.
This study aims to investigate the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), to determine the metabolic risk factors of this disease, and to predict nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with liver fibrosis in women of different ages and body mass index (BMI).
In 2010-2011, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among 9,360 women at the health checkup center of Zhongnan Hospital (Wuhan, China). The probability of NASH with liver fibrosis was predicted using BAAT (BMI, age, alanine aminotransferase, and triglycerides) score.
The prevalence of NAFLD increased from 5.3% to 18.8% in women younger than 45 years versus women aged 45 to 55 years and rose to 27.8% in women older than 55 years. In obese women, the prevalence of NAFLD was 48.4%. Women older than 45 years and obese women with NAFLD had more unfavorable metabolic risk factors. Multiple regression analyses showed that increased BMI and low aspartate aminotransferase-to-alanine aminotransferase ratio were closely related to NAFLD in women of different ages, whereas increasing BMI, BAAT score, age, high triglycerides, alanine aminotransferase, and low aspartate aminotransferase-to-alanine aminotransferase ratio were all closely related to NAFLD in obese women. The prevalence of NASH with a BAAT index of 3 or higher was 13.2% and 14.9% in women older than 55 years and obese women with NAFLD, respectively.
Obese and postmenopausal women have a high prevalence of NAFLD and severe metabolic disorders. The prevalence of NASH seems to be considerably higher in obese and postmenopausal women with NAFLD.
Insulin resistance contributes to the pathogenesis of both polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The main aim of the present study was the evaluation of non-invasive indices of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in PCOS women with or without metabolic syndrome (MetS).
In this cross-sectional study, three non-invasive indices for hepatic steatosis [NAFLD liver fat score, lipid accumulation product (LAP) and hepatic steatosis index (HIS)] and four for fibrosis [FIB-4, aspartate aminotransferase (AST)-to-Platelet Ratio Index (APRI), body mass index (BMI)-Age-Alanine aminotransferase (ALT)-Triglycerides (BAAT) and BMI AST/ALT Ratio Diabetes (BARD)] were calculated in 314 PCOS women (77 with, 237 without MetS) and 78 controls.
All steatosis indices were significantly higher in the PCOS than the control group (NAFLD liver fat score: -0.139 ± 0.117 vs. -0.976 ± 0.159, p&lt;0.001; LAP: 43.3 ± 1.9 vs. 34.7 ± 3.1, p=0.036; HIS: 44.6 ± 0.5 vs. 42.1 ± 0.8, p=0.016). FIB-4 and BAAT [fibrosis stage (F)2-4] were higher in the PCOS group (0.480 ± 0.020 vs. 0.400 ± 0.013, p&lt;0.001; and 15.6% vs. 5.1%, respectively), whereas APRI and BARD were not. All steatosis indices were significantly higher in PCOS women with than without MetS (NAFLD liver fat score: 1.874 ± 0.258 vs. -0.793 ± 0.099, p&lt;0.001; LAP: 76.8 ± 4.9 vs. 33.4 ± 1.4, p&lt;0.001; and HIS: 49.8 ± 1 vs. 43 ± 0.5, p&lt;0.001). Of the fibrosis indices, only BAAT (F2-4: 50.6% vs. 4.2%) was higher in PCOS women with MetS.
Non-invasive indices of hepatic steatosis were significantly higher in PCOS, especially in the presence of MetS, whereas indices of hepatic fibrosis yielded controversial results. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the long-term outcomes of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis indices in PCOS women.
The aim of this study was to investigate to what extent dentists in the Netherlands experience barriers in providing oral health care to community-dwelling older people.
As most publications on the barriers in providing oral health care to older people consist of surveys on oral health care in care homes, it was decided to investigate the barriers dentists experience in their own dental practices while providing oral health care to community-dwelling frail older people.
A representative sample of 1592 of the approximately 8000 dentists in the Netherlands aged 64 or younger were invited to respond to a questionnaire online. The dentists were asked to respond to 15 opinions concerning oral healthcare provision to community-dwelling frail older people aged 75 years or more who experience problems in physical, psychological and social areas, as well as possible financial problems.
The total response rate was 37% (n = 595; male=76%; average age 49). The majority of those who responded agreed that the reimbursement of oral health care to older people is poor. Two thirds of those who responded (66%) agreed that there are limited opportunities to refer the frail and elderly with complex oral healthcare problems to a colleague with specific knowledge and skills.
Dentists experienced barriers in two domains; a lack of knowledge and practical circumstances. It was concluded that the dentist's gender, age, year of graduation and the number of patients aged 75 years or more treated weekly were in some respect, related to the barriers encountered.
Aortic regurgitation (AR) and subclinical left ventricular (LV) dysfunction expressed by myocardial deformation imaging are common in patients with transposition of the great arteries after the arterial switch operation (ASO). Echocardiographic evaluation is often hampered by reduced acoustic window settings. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging provides a robust alternative as it allows for comprehensive assessment of degree of AR and LV function. The purpose of this study is to validate CMR based 4-dimensional flow quantification (4D flow) for degree of AR and feature tracking strain measurements for LV deformation assessment in ASO patients.
A total of 81 ASO patients (median 20.6 years, IQR 13.5-28.4) underwent CMR for 4D and 2D flow analysis. CMR global longitudinal strain (GLS) feature tracking was compared to echocardiographic (echo) speckle tracking. Agreements between and within tests were expressed as intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC).
Eleven ASO patients (13.6%) showed AR &gt; 5% by 4D flow, with good correlation to 2D flow assessment (ICC = 0.85). 4D flow stroke volume of the aortic valve demonstrated good agreement to 2D stroke volume over the mitral valve (internal validation, ICC = 0.85) and multi-slice planimetric LV stroke volume (external validation, ICC = 0.95). 2D flow stroke volume showed slightly less, though still good agreement with 4D flow (ICC = 0.78) and planimetric LV stroke volume (ICC = 0.87). GLS by CMR was normal (- 18.8 ± 4.4%) and demonstrated good agreement with GLS and segmental analysis by echocardiographic speckle tracking (GLS = - 17.3 ± 3.1%, ICC of 0.80).
Aortic 4D flow and CMR feature tracking GLS analysis demonstrate good to excellent agreement with 2D flow assessment and echocardiographic speckle tracking, respectively, and can therefore reliably be used for an integrated and comprehensive CMR analysis of aortic valve competence and LV deformation analysis in ASO patients.
Possible treatment options for Parkinson's disease consist of medications for motor symptoms as well as non-motor symptoms, such as cognitive decline, depression, hallucinations and delusions, constipation, and drooling. A number of these medications are in the experimental stage. In addition, physical activity and exercise can favourably influence the motor as well as the non-motor symptoms. Speech and dysphagia therapy are available, whereas cognitive behavioural therapy can control depressionand anxiety. Deep brain stimulation is the only surgical treatment currently used. Potential future surgical treatments are gene therapy, (stem) cell therapy, and the application of growth factors. Worldwide, research projects are being carried out in order to be able to control the disease. Once in a while surprising discoveries are made. Whether cure and/or prevention are possible remains to be seen.
De ziekte van Parkinson is een langzaam progressieve neurodegeneratieve ziekte die zich manifesteert met karakteristieke motorische, maar ook met niet-motorische symptomen. De behandelingsmogelijkheden voor de ziekte van Parkinson bestaan uit medicamenten voor de motorische symptomen alsmede voor de niet-motorische symptomen als cognitieve achteruitgang, depressie, hallucinaties, wanen, obstipatie en kwijlen. Een aantal van deze medicamenten verkeren in de experimentele fase. Daarnaast kunnen lichaamsbeweging en fysieke oefeningen een gunstig effect hebben op zowel de motorische als de niet-motorische symptomen. Logopedisch zijn spraak- en sliktherapie mogelijk, terwijl cognitieve gedragstherapie depressie en angst onder controle kunnen brengen. Stimulering van diepgelegen hersengebieden is de enige chirurgische behandeling die actueel plaatsvindt. Toekomstige chirurgische mogelijkheden zijn gentherapie, (stam)celtherapie en toediening van groeifactoren. Wereldwijd wordt onderzoek verricht om de ziekte onder controle te krijgen. Soms worden verrassende ontdekkingen gedaan. Het blijft afwachten of genezing en/of preventie op termijn mogelijk worden.
Interactions between medicaments or between a medicament and another product used by the patient may result in a medicamentbecoming inactive or in an increase in the side effects. By proper historytaking, a dentist will often know which medicaments a patient uses and can take this into account in prescribing a medicament. Self-care medications and specific foods are often not spontaneously reported by a patient but can still interact with a medicament prescribed. A dentist should be aware of the interactions a prescribed medicament can have with other medicaments and products used by the patient. Therefore dentists have to ask directly about such medicaments and products, and record them in the patients' file.
Interacties tussen medicamenten of van een medicament met een ander product dat een patiënt gebruikt, kunnen leiden tot het onwerkzaam worden van een medicament of tot versterking van de bijwerkingen. Door een goede anamnese weet een tandarts vaak wel welke medicamenten een patiënt gebruikt en kan daarmee bij het voorschrijven van een medicament rekening worden gehouden. Zelfzorgmiddelen en specifieke voedingsmiddelen worden vaak niet spontaan door een patiënt gemeld, maar kunnen wel interacties aangaan met een medicament dat wordt voorgeschreven. Een tandarts moet op de hoogte zijn van de interacties die een voorgeschreven medicament kan aangaan met de andere medicamenten en producten die een patiënt gebruikt. Tandartsen moeten daarom actief naar deze medicamenten en producten vragen en deze gegevens vastleggen in het patiëntendossier.
Parkinson's disease is a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterised by motor symptoms, which are accompanied or often even preceded by non-motor symptoms. Pathologically, the disease is characterised by neural degeneration in specific brain regions, including the dopaminergic neurons of the pars compacta of the substantia nigra. At the molecular level, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, altered protein handling, and reactive microgliosis contribute to the neural degeneration. Advanced age is a significant risk factor. Men are more often affected by the disease than women. Environmental, life-style and genetic factors are potential aetiological factors. The disease is primarily diagnosed on the basis of clinical features. In clinically uncertain cases, magnetic resonance imaging and dopamine transporter single-photon emission computer tomography can provide additional information. Patients usually die due to comorbidity. Parkinson's disease has also several negative influences on the orofacial system.
De ziekte van Parkinson is een langzaam progressieve neurodegeneratieve ziekte met karakteristieke bewegingssymptomen. Deze gaan vergezeld van of worden vaak zelfs voorafgegaan door symptomen die niet aan bewegen zijn gerelateerd. Neuropathologisch kenmerkt de ziekte zich door degeneratie van neuronen in specifieke regio’s van de hersenen, waaronder de dopaminerge neuronen in de pars compacta van de substantia nigra. Op moleculair niveau dragen disfunctie van mitochondriën, oxidatieve stress, verstoorde afbraak van proteïnen en reactieve microgliose bij aan de neurodegeneratie. Gevorderde leeftijd is een belangrijke risicofactor. Meer mannen dan vrouwen krijgen de ziekte. Tot de potentiële etiologische factoren behoren leefomgeving, leefstijl en genetische factoren. De diagnose wordt in eerste instantie gesteld aan de hand van het klinische beeld. Bij twijfel kunnen MRI en foto-emissie-computertomografie een bijdrage leveren aan het diagnostisch proces. Meestal overlijden de patiënten aan comorbiditeit. De ziekte heeft ook consequenties voor de functie van het orofaciale systeem.
The number of people with dementia and natural dentition is growing. As dementia progresses, the degree of self-care decreases and the risk of oral health problems and orofacial pain increases.
To examine and compare the presence of orofacial pain and its potential causes in older people with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or dementia.
In this cross-sectional observational study, the presence of orofacial pain and its potential causes was studied in 348 participants with MCI or dementia with all levels of cognitive impairment in two outpatient memory clinics and ten nursing homes.
Orofacial pain was reported by 25.7% of the 179 participants who were considered to present a reliable pain self-report (Mini-Mental State Examination score ≥14 points), while it could not be determined in people with more severe cognitive impairment. The oral health examination of the 348 participants indicated that potential painful conditions, such as coronal caries, root caries, tooth root remnants or ulcers were present in 50.3%. There was a significant correlation between the level of cognitive impairment and the number of teeth, r = 0.185, P = 0.003, teeth with coronal caries, r = -0.238, P &lt; 0.001, and the number of tooth root remnants, r = -0.229, P = 0.004, after adjusting for age.
This study indicated that orofacial pain and its potential causes were frequently present in participants with MCI or dementia. Therefore, a regular oral examination by (oral) healthcare providers in people with MCI or dementia remains imperative, even if no pain is reported.
According to the European Water Framework Directive (WFD), chemical water quality is assessed by monitoring 45 priority substances. However, observed toxic effects can often not be attributed to these priority substances, and therefore there is an urgent need for an effect-based monitoring strategy that employs bioassays to identify environmental risk. Algal photosynthesis is a sensitive process that can be applied to identify the presence of hazardous herbicides in surface water. Therefore, the aim of this study was to employ an algal photosynthesis bioassay to assess surface water toxicity to algae and to identify the compounds causing the observed effects. To this purpose, Raphidocelis subcapitata was exposed to surface water samples and after 4.5 h photosynthetic efficiency was determined using PAM fluorometry. In this rapid high throughput bioassay, algal photosynthesis was affected by surface water from only one of 39 locations. Single compounds toxicity confirmation elucidated that the observed effect could be solely attributed to the herbicide linuron, which occurred at 110 times the EQS concentration and which is not included in the WFD priority substances list. In conclusion, applying the algal photosynthesis bioassay enables more efficient and effective assessment of toxicity to primary producers because it: (i) identifies the presence of herbicides that would be overlooked by routine chemical WFD monitoring, and (ii) avoids redundant chemical analyses by focusing only on (non-)target screening in samples with demonstrated effects.
Obesity and comorbidities such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are major public health burdens. Alterations in lipid metabolism are involved in hepatic diseases. The objective of this study was to assess the influence of weight loss on lysophospholipid (LP) metabolism and liver status in obese subjects as well as to provide new evidence regarding the interaction of LP metabolism as a key factor in the onset and management of obesity-related diseases such as liver damage.
Thirty-three subjects from the RESMENA (Reduction of Metabolic Syndrome in Navarra, NCT01087086) study were selected based on their Fatty Liver Index (FLI). Plasma lipid species (lysophosphatidilcholine: LPC, lysophosphatidilethanolamines: LPE and lysophosphatidylinositols: LPI specifically) were determined by LC-MS, while waist circumference (WC) and other non-invasive liver markers such as, FLI and BAAT scores as well as dietary records, anthropometrical measurements, body composition by DXA and other metabolic determinants were analyzed before and after a six-month hypocaloric nutritional intervention.
Computed Z-scores of total LP (LPC, LPE, and LPI) were significantly decreased after 6-months of following a hypocaloric diet. Specifically, LPC14:0, LPC15:0, LPC16:1, LPC18:4, LPC20:4, showed clear relationships with weight loss. Changes in FLI score, WC and BAAT score revealed associations with general changes in LPC score. Interestingly the BAAT score was statistically associated with the LPC score after adjustment for weight loss.
The lipidomic LPC profile analysis revealed a generalized decrease in circulating lysophospholipids after weight loss. The involvement of particular LP in liver metabolism and obesity merit further attention, as some of these specific non-invasive liver markers were reduced independently of weight loss.

Adverse effects of medications and self care products on the gingiva can be divided into inflammation, intrinsic discolouration, irritation, trauma, cytotoxicity, lichenoid reaction, and proliferation. This article deals with the last-mentioned type of adverse effects; the other 6 have been discussed in a previous article. Proliferation of the gingiva as an adverse effect of medications has been reported for anticonvulsants, calcineurin inhibitors, calcium channel blockers and isotretinoin. With regard to the anticonvulsants that have been registered in the Netherlands, proliferation of the gingiva is predominantly induced by phenytoin, but also by carbamazepine, ethosuximide, phenobarbital, gabapentin, levetiracetam, primidone and valproic acid. All calcineurin inhibitors registered in the Netherlands may induce the adverse effect. This is also the case for nearly all calcium channel blockers, but particularly for dihydropyridines. Presumably, proliferation of the gingiva may be prevented or reduced in a number of ways. The most important one is good oral hygiene. Furthermore, proteins and cells that play an important role [in the process of gingival proliferation] have been discovered and there are medications that have the potential to eliminate these proteins and cells.
De bijwerkingen van medicamenten en zelfzorgmiddelen op de gingiva zijn te verdelen in ontsteking, intrinsieke verkleuring, irritatie, trauma, cytotoxiciteit, lichenoïde reactie en proliferatie. Het laatstgenoemde type bijwerking komt in dit artikel aan de orde, de andere 6 zijn in een vorig artikel behandeld. Proliferatie van de gingiva als bijwerking van medicamenten is gerapporteerd voor anti-epileptica, calcineurineremmers, calciumantagonisten en isotretinoïne. Voor de in Nederland geregistreerde anti-epileptica geldt dit voornamelijk voor fenytoïne, maar ook voor carbamazepine, ethosuximide, fenobarbital, gabapentine, levetiracetam, primidon en valproïnezuur. Alle in Nederland geregistreerde calcineurineremmers kunnen de bijwerking hebben. Dit geldt ook voor bijna alle calciumantagonisten, maar in het bijzonder voor de dihydropyridinen. Vermoedelijk kan de bijwerking op een aantal manieren worden tegengegaan. Primair staat een goede mondverzorging. Verder zijn proteïnen en cellen ontdekt die een belangrijke rol spelen en er zijn middelen die de potentie hebben om deze proteïnen en cellen uit te schakelen.
Medications and self care products may have adverse effects on the gingiva. These adverse effects can be divided into inflammation, intrinsic discolouration, irritation, trauma, cytotoxicity, lichenoid reaction, and proliferation. This article deals with the first 6 types of adverse effects mentioned: a subsequent article will deal with the last type mentioned. Since contraceptives were introduced, there have been indications that they cause or promote gingivitis, but with the current contraceptives this adverse effect is rarely seen. Intrinsic discolouration of the gingiva has been reported when using Staloral®, minocycline, contraceptives and hydroxychloroquine. Irritation and trauma of the gingiva are seen when self care products containing carbamide peroxide or hydrogen peroxide are used for external tooth whitening, or which have analgesic potential, such as acetylsalicylic acid and hydrogen peroxide or oral rinses containing alcohol. Several cytostatics may induce apoptosis of keratinocytes in the gingiva. Oral rinses with antibacterial ingredients have cytotoxic potential. Lichenoid reactions have been reported due to the use of several (groups of) medications.
Medicamenten en zelfzorgmiddelen kunnen bijwerkingen hebben op de gingiva. Deze bijwerkingen zijn te verdelen in ontsteking, intrinsieke verkleuring, irritatie, trauma, cytotoxiciteit, lichenoïde reactie en proliferatie. De eerste 6 typen bijwerkingen komen in dit artikel aan de orde, het laatste type in een volgend artikel. Sinds de introductie van anticonceptiva zijn er aanwijzingen dat ze gingivitis veroorzaken of bevorderen, maar bij de huidige anticonceptiva wordt deze bijwerking zelden gezien. Intrinsieke verkleuring van de gingiva is gemeld bij gebruik van Staloral®, minocycline, anticonceptiva en hydroxychloroquine. Irritatie en trauma van de gingiva komen voor bij gebruik van zelfzorgmiddelen die carbamideperoxide of waterstofperoxide bevatten voor het bleken van gebitselementen, zelfzorgmiddelen die analgetische potentie hebben als acetylsalicylzuur en waterstofperoxide en alcoholbevattende mondspoelmiddelen. Diverse cytostatica kunnen apoptose van keratinocyten in de gingiva induceren. Mondspoelmiddelen met antibacteriële ingrediënten hebben cytotoxische potentie. Van een groot aantal (groepen) medicamenten is ooit een lichenoïde reactie van de gingiva gemeld.
The behaviour of a 78-year-old, edentulous female resident of a care home, suffering from dementia indicated to her care providers that she was experiencing oral pain. At the left (pre)molar region of the mandibular residual alveolar ridge, an irritated, red-coloured, sharply restricted mucosal area was seen, extending in width from the buccal to the lingual border of the ridge. Eventually it was identified as mucosal irritation, apparently due to hydroxylapatite cones that had previously been inserted to augment the residual alveolar ridge. Preservation and augmentation of an edentulous part of an alveolar ridge or of a fully edentulous alveolar ridge are both possible using alveolar implants and/or several surgical procedures. In the current case, such previous treatment was not known to have taken place. Consequently, the dentist was not able to provide treatment immediately. This case illustrates the need for general dental practitioners to keep an eye on their older patients and to provide all relevant information when the oral health care provision is taken over by another dentist.
Aan het gedrag van een 78-jarige, demente, edentate bewoonster van een woonzorgcentrum merkten de verzorgenden dat zij pijn in haar mond had. Op de processus alveolaris in de (pre)molaarregio links in de mandibula werd een afgebakend geïrriteerd, rood verkleurd slijmvliesgebied aangetroffen dat zich in de breedte uitstrekte van de buccale tot de linguale omslagplooi. Uiteindelijk bleek het te gaan om irritatie door kennelijk eerder ter augmentatie van de processus alveolaris aangebrachte korrels hydroxyapatiet. Behoud en augmentatie van een edentaat deel van een processus alveolaris of van een volledig edentate processus alveolaris zijn mogelijk met alveolaire implantaten en diverse chirurgische methoden. In deze casus was niets bekend over een dergelijke behandeling. Daardoor kon de behandelend tandarts niet direct een behandeling instellen. Deze casus illustreert de noodzaak dat tandartsen-algemeen practici ouderen ‘in beeld houden’ en dat zij zorg dragen voor goede informatieoverdracht als de zorg door een andere zorgverlener wordt overgenomen.
The aim of the study was to examine the oral health status of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, to compare their oral health status to that of a control group, and to relate it to the duration and severity of PD. Materials and Methods. 74 PD patients and 74 controls were interviewed and orally examined. Among PD patients, the duration and the Hoehn and Yahr stage (HY) of the disease were registered. Results. More PD patients than controls reported oral hygiene care support as well as chewing/biting problems, taste disturbance, tooth mobility, and xerostomia, whereas dentate patients had more teeth with carious lesions, tooth root remnants, and biofilm. Both longer duration and higher HY were associated with more chewing problems and, in dentates, more teeth with restorations. In dentates, longer duration of the disease was associated with higher number of mobile teeth. Higher HY was associated with more oral hygiene care support as well as biting problems and, in dentates, more teeth with carious lesions and tooth root remnants. Conclusions. Comparatively, PD patients had weakened oral health status and reduced oral hygiene care. Both duration and severity of the disease were associated with more oral health and hygiene care problems.
Morbidly obese patients often elect for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), a form of bariatric surgery that triggers a remarkable 30% reduction in excess body weight and reversal of insulin resistance for those who are type II diabetic. A more complete understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms that drive the complex metabolic reprogramming post-RYGB could lead to innovative non-invasive therapeutics that mimic the beneficial effects of the surgery, namely weight loss, achievement of glycemic control, or reversal of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). To facilitate these discoveries, we hereby demonstrate the first multi-omic interrogation of a rodent RYGB model to reveal tissue-specific pathway modules implicated in the control of body weight regulation and energy homeostasis. In this study, we focus on and evaluate liver metabolism three months following RYGB in rats using both SWATH proteomics, a burgeoning label free approach using high resolution mass spectrometry to quantify protein levels in biological samples, as well as MRM metabolomics. The SWATH analysis enabled the quantification of 1378 proteins in liver tissue extracts, of which we report the significant down-regulation of Thrsp and Acot13 in RYGB as putative targets of lipid metabolism for weight loss. Furthermore, we develop a computational graph-based metabolic network module detection algorithm for the discovery of non-canonical pathways, or sub-networks, enriched with significantly elevated or depleted metabolites and proteins in RYGB-treated rat livers. The analysis revealed a network connection between the depleted protein Baat and the depleted metabolite taurine, corroborating the clinical observation that taurine-conjugated bile acid levels are perturbed post-RYGB.
In the coming decades the western world will experience a double ageing of its population; there will be an increase in both the number of older people and the average age. The increase in life expectancy will also mean more and more older people who suffer from multiple systemic diseases that are treated with medications. At this moment, 45% of those over 65 use 5 or more medications and 20% of those over 75 use as many as 10 or more. The more medications used, the greater the risk of side effects and therefore oral side effects, like symptoms of dry mouth or the development of candidiasis, angioedema, gingival hyperplasia, lichenoid reaction of the oral mucosa, dysgeusia, halitosis and osteonecrosis. Considering the wide range of oral side effects, it is important for dentists to be well aware of the medications being used by older patients as well as having a thorough knowledge of their oral side effects.
De komende decennia is in de westerse wereld sprake van een dubbele vergrijzing. Dit houdt in dat zowel het aantal ouderen als de gemiddelde leeftijd toeneemt. De toegenomen levensverwachting betekent tevens steeds meer ouderen die lijden aan een of meerdere systemische ziekten waarvoor medicamenten worden gebruikt. Op dit moment gebruikt 45% van de 65-plussers 5 of meer medicamenten en 20% van de 75-plussers zelfs 10 of meer medicamenten. Hoe meer medicamenten worden gebruikt, des te groter is de kans op bijwerkingen en dus ook orale bijwerkingen, zoals het gevoel van een droge mond of het ontwikkelen van candidose, angio-oedeem, hyperplasie van de gingiva, lichenoïde reactie van het orale slijmvlies, smaakstoornissen, halitose en osteonecrose. Gezien het brede scala aan orale bijwerkingen, is het voor tandartsen van belang om een goed inzicht te hebben in de medicamenten die ouderen gebruiken en kennis te hebben van de daarbij behorende (orale) bijwerkingen.
Intrinsic tooth discoloration may occur as an adverse effect of fluoride and tetracyclines. Extrinsic tooth discoloration may occur as superficial staining or as discoloration of the superficial pellicle and/or biofilm due to chlorhexidine, liquid iron salts, essential oils, some antibiotics and stannous fluoride. Inhibition of orthodontic tooth movement has been reported due to the use of prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors. If medications or over-the-counter drugs induce hyposalivation or contain much sucrose, caries may develop. Erosion may occur if the acidity of medications or over-the-counter drugs is excessive. Attrition is a well-known adverse effect of serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antiparkinson agents, and antipsychotics. Congenital dysplasia is observed following childhood treatment with cytostatic drugs. External cervical root resorption is an adverse effect of internal teeth-whitening products. Prenatal exposure to antiepileptic drugs and childhood treatment with cytostatic drugs may cause dental agenesis. Antiseptic drugs applied for external teeth-whitening and toothpastes with additional ingredients to prevent extrinsic discoloration and creation of calculus, may cause tooth hypersensitivity.
Intrinsieke verkleuring komt voor als bijwerking van fluoride en tetracyclinen. Extrinsieke verkleuring kan ontstaan door aanslag op het oppervlak of door verkleuring van de pellikel en/of de biofilm op het oppervlak onder invloed van chloorhexidine, ferropreparaten, etherische oliën, sommige antibiotica en tinfluoride. Een inhiberend effect op orthodontische verplaatsing is gemeld bij het gebruik van prostaglandinesynthetaseremmers. Als medicamenten of zelfzorgmiddelen hyposialie induceren of veel sacharose bevatten, kan cariës ontstaan. Erosie kan ontstaan als medicamenten of zelfzorgmiddelen een hoge zuurgraad hebben. Attritie is een bekende bijwerking van serotonineheropnameremmers, antiparkinsonmiddelen en antipsychotica. Congenitale dysplasie ziet men na behandeling met cytostatica op kinderleeftijd. Externe dentineresorptie in het cervicale gebied is een bijwerking van intern bleken. Prenatale expositie aan anti-epileptica en behandeling van kinderen met cytostatica kunnen leiden tot agenesieën. Antiseptica die worden toegepast bij extern bleken en tandpasta’s die als bijkomend doel hebben extrinsieke verkleuring en vorming van tandsteen te voorkomen, kunnen hypersensitiviteit veroorzaken.
Growth and fatness traits are economically important in the pig industry. To dissect the genetic architecture of these traits in commercial pigs, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for carcass weight, backfat thickness, and body weight in two commercial populations: Duroc × (Landrace × Yorkshire) (DLY) and Duroc populations. To enhance the detection power, three GWAS approaches including single-trait GWAS, multi-trait GWAS and meta-analysis were used in this study. A total of 13 suggestive loci were identified on nine chromosomes. The most significant locus was detected at 272.05 Mb on SSC1, and it was associated with backfat thickness at the first rib in the DLY population. Three genes at the identified loci (TBC1D1, BAAT and PHLPP1) were highlighted as functionally plausible candidate genes for pig growth and fatness traits. Genome-wide significant locus was not evidenced in this study, indicating that large populations are required to identify QTL with minor effects on growth and fatness traits in commercial pig populations, in which intensively artificial selections have been imposed on these traits and small genetical variances usually retain in these traits.
Chaihu-Shu-Gan-San (CSGS) is a famous classic traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) formula for treatment of liver stagnancy recorded in a famous book of traditional Chinese medicine, Jing Yue Quan Shu published in 1624. It has been extensively accepted as an antidepressant in China and its mechanism of action is still not clear. Previously we have found that hepatic injury happens in chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS). Thus, the protection of CSGS against hepatic injury induced by CUMS treatment was explored by metabonomics study and gene expression of the rat liver tissue. The results indicated that CSGS improved 8 of the 18 perturbed potential biomarkers in liver tissues of rats treated with CUMS, and involved in regulating phospholipids and bile acid metabolism against hepatic injury induced by CUMS in rat. The expressions of two apoptosis associated genes (Bcl-2 and Bax) and four genes (Pnpla6, Pla2g15, Baat and Gad1) related to the perturbed metabolic pathways were further investigated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Both metabonomics and studies of genetic influences on metabolites demonstrated that CSGS inhibited hepatocyte apoptosis, and regulated phospholipids and bile acid metabolism against hepatic injury induced by CUMS in rat. Exploring the protection of CSGS against hepatic injury related to depression further clarify the relationship between CUMS-induced depression and hepatic injury, and also provide a novel insight to understand the underlying antidepressive mechanism of CSGS.
Many older people have a bad oral health, with (root) caries a prevalent cause. Alarming results of research projects raise the question whether sufficient preventive measures are being taken to prevent the development and progress of (root) caries in frail older people. A review of the recent literature revealed that in frail older people and physically or cognitively impaired adults, daily use of a 5,000 ppm fluoride toothpaste and quarterly application of chlorhexidine or sodium fluoride can decrease by half the risk of root caries. In the Netherlands, toothpaste containing 5,000 ppm fluoride is not (yet) on the market. At the present time, only the advice brochure 'Prevention of root caries' is available. Another measure to prevent deterioration of oral health among frail older people is paying attention to frail older people who do not visit their dentist on a regular basis due to physical limitations and care dependency. When this is the case, it is necessary to intensify professional oral healthcare with instructions to personal caregivers and professional care providers in order to fight (root) caries.
Veel ouderen hebben een slechte mondgezondheid met (wortel)cariës als veelvoorkomend probleem. Alarmerende onderzoeks­resultaten doen de vraag rijzen of er voldoende preventieve maatregelen worden genomen om het ontstaan en de progressie van ­(wortel)­cariës bij kwetsbare ouderen te voorkomen. Uit recente onderzoeksliteratuur bleek dat dagelijks gebruik van tandpasta met 5.000 ppm fluoride en 3-maandelijks professioneel aangebrachte chloorhexidine- of natriumfluoridelak bij kwetsbare ­ouderen of volwassenen met een fysieke of cognitieve beperking het risico op wortelcariës kan halveren. Tandpasta met 5.000 ppm is in Nederland (nog) niet verkrijgbaar. Op dit moment is het advies ‘Preventie van wortelcariës’ de enige richtlijn. Een andere maatregel om achteruitgang van de mondgezondheid van kwetsbare ouderen te voorkomen, is aandacht besteden aan kwetsbare ouderen die wegens toename van fysieke problemen en zorgafhankelijkheid wegblijven van reguliere periodieke mondonderzoeken. Juist op dat moment is intensiveren van professionele mondzorg met instructie aan mantelzorgers en verzorgenden en extra preventieve maatregelen ter bestrijding van (wortel)cariës noodzakelijk.
Recently, bile acids (BAs) were reported as promising markers for drug-induced liver injury (DILI). BAs have been suggested to correlate with hepatocellular and hepatobiliary damage; however a clear connection of BA patterns with different types of DILI remains to be established. To investigate if BAs can improve the assessment of liver injury, 20 specific BAs were quantitatively profiled via LC-MS/MS in plasma and liver tissue in a model of methapyrilene-induced liver injury in rats. Methapyrilene, a known hepatotoxin was dosed daily over 14-days at doses of 30 and 80mg/kg, followed by a recovery phase of 10days. Conventional preclinical safety endpoints were related to BA perturbations and to hepatic gene expression profiling for a mechanistic interpretation of effects. Histopathological signs of hepatocellular and hepatobiliary damage with significant changes of clinical chemistry markers were accompanied by significantly increased levels of indivdual BAs in plasma and liver tissue. BA perturbations were already evident at the earliest time point after 30mg/kg treatment, and thereby indicating better sensitivity than clinical chemistry parameters. Furthermore, the latter markers suggested recovery of liver injury, whereas BA levels in plasma and liver remained significantly elevated during the recovery phase, in line with persistent histopathological findings of bile duct hyperplasia (BDH) and bile pigment deposition. Gene expression profiling revealed downregulation of genes involved in BA synthesis (AMACR, BAAT, ACOX2) and hepatocellular uptake (NTCP, OATs), and upregulation for efflux transporters (MRP2, MRP4), suggesting an adaptive hepatocellular protection mechanism against cytotoxic bile acid accumulation. In summary, our data suggests that specific BAs with high reliability such as cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) followed by glycocholic acid (GCA), taurocholic acid (TCA) and deoxycholic acid (DCA) can serve as additional biomarkers for hepatocellular/hepatobiliary damage in the liver in rat toxicity studies.
Polypharmacy is the consequence of multimorbidity. Both phenomena may cause functional limitations and/or frailty and/or care dependency in older people. In the human body, a medicament undergoes at least 3 important actions: absorption, distribution and elimination. These actions may proceed aberrantly in older people. Following interaction with receptors, a medicament triggers a chain reaction in the human body. The receptors and each link of the chain reaction may be subject to changes due to diseases as well as ageing. This, particularly, is the case with regard to medications directed towards the central nervous system and the cardiovascular system. Furthermore, interactions may occur between various medications mutually and between medications on the one hand and on the other hand food and water intake, self-medication with herbs, and diseases. Moreover, older people usually experience more adverse effects of medications when compared to younger people. This is due to altered body actions and reactions, polypharmacy and the many possible interactions. In older people, utilisation and intake of medications often give rise to problems that can be divided into medicament-related, patient-related, care- and care provider-related and other problems.
Polyfarmacie is het gevolg van multimorbiditeit. Beide kunnen leiden tot kwetsbaarheid, functiebeperking en/of zorgafhankelijkheid bij ouderen. Een medicament ondergaat in het lichaam minimaal 3 belangrijke processen: absorptie, distributie en eliminatie. Bij ouderen kunnen deze processen afwijkend verlopen. Een medicament zet in het lichaam een kettingreactie in gang na interactie met receptoren. De receptoren en elk onderdeel van de kettingreactie kunnen door ziekten en veroudering veranderingen ondergaan. Dit speelt vooral bij medicamenten die werken op het centrale zenuwstelsel en het cardiovasculaire systeem. Daarnaast kunnen interacties optreden tussen verschillende medicamenten onderling en tussen enerzijds medicamenten en anderzijds voedsel- en waterinname, zelfmedicatie met kruiden en ziekten. Voorts ervaren ouderen doorgaans meer bijwerkingen van medicamenten dan jongeren. Dit komt door de gewijzigde lichaamsacties en -reacties, de polyfarmacie en de vele mogelijke interacties. Gebruik en inname van medicamenten leidt bij ouderen vaak tot problemen die te verdelen zijn in medicamentgerelateerde, patiëntgerelateerde, zorg(verlener)gerelateerde en overige problemen.
Nursing home-acquired pneumonia (NHAP) is a common infection among nursing home residents. There is also a high prevalence of dysphagia in nursing home residents and they suffer more often from comorbidity and multimorbidity. This puts nursing home residents at higher risk of (mortality from) NHAP. Therefore it is important to gain more insight into the incidence of NHAP and the associated medical conditions in nursing home residents with dysphagia.
To investigate possible associations between NHAP and dysphagia in nursing home residents and to search for a medical risk profile for NHAP.
A retrospective cross-sectional study.
Three nursing homes in The Netherlands.
416 electronic medical files of nursing home residents aged 65 or older living in 3 nursing homes.
Data about age, gender, diagnosis of dysphagia and/or pneumonia, medical diagnosis and possible cause of death of the nursing home residents were extracted from electronic medical files.
The data of 373 electronic medical files were analyzed. A significant difference in the prevalence of dysphagia was found between the nursing homes (p &lt; 0.001). The incidence of NHAP was 5-12% in the participating nursing homes. Statistically significant higher incidence of NHAP was found in residents with dysphagia (p = 0.046). Residents with dysphagia had statistically significantly more diseases compared to residents without dysphagia (p = 0.001). Logistic regression analyses revealed no statistically significant associations between NHAP and the number of diseases and the ICD-10 diseases.
Dysphagia was found to be a risk factor for NHAP. Awareness of the signs of dysphagia by nurses and other care providers is important for early recognition and management of dysphagia and prevention of NHAP.
Although liver biopsy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD], many non-invasive markers of liver fibrosis have recently been proposed and assessed as surrogates of liver biopsy.
To evaluate the degree of liver fibrosis by different non-invasive fibrosis scoring systems and to compare each non-invasive fibrosis scoring system with histological fibrosis stage.
The study population consists of consecutive patients with biopsy proven NAFLD. Complete medical history was taken and physical examination was done in all patients along with appropriate biochemical evaluations. NAFLD fibrosis score, BARD score, BAAT score and APRI score were calculated and each score was compared with histological fibrosis staging.
The study population consisted of 60 patients having mean age 39.73 years (SD 9.62, range 17-63 years) including 51 (85%) males and 9 (15%) females. On histology fibrosis was present in 68.3% (41/60) patients. Out of 60 patients 41 had fibrosis and among them 17, 22, 2 patients had grade 1, 2, 3 fibrosis respectively and no one had grade 4 fibrosis. 61.67% (37/60) had definite NASH. Comparing the fibrosis of histology with the noninvasive scoring systems, the sensitivity and specificity of NAFLD fibrosis score were 5.56% and 100% respectively. BARD score had 45.83% sensitivity and 80.55% specificity. The sensitivities of BAAT score and APRI score were 0% and 29.16% respectively and the specificities were 100% and 97.22% respectively.
The noninvasive scoring systems like NFS, BARD, BAAT, and APRI are not sensitive enough to detect fibrosis but highly specific to include fibrosis if scores are more than cut-off values in our cohort, however they cannot replace liver biopsy. Newer more efficient non-invasive scoring systems have to be devised for the Indian NAFLD population.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) alter the maturation of their phagosomes and reside within a compartment that resists acidification and fusion with lysosomes. To define the molecular composition of this compartment, we developed a novel method for obtaining highly purified phagosomes from BCG-infected human macrophages and analyzed the phagosomes by Western immunoblotting and mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Our purification procedure revealed that BCG grown on artificial medium becomes less dense after growth in macrophages. By Western immunoblotting, LAMP-2, Niemann-Pick protein C1, and syntaxin 3 were readily detectable on the BCG phagosome but at levels that were lower than on the latex bead phagosome; flotillin-1 and the vacuolar ATPase were barely detectable on the BCG phagosome but highly enriched on the latex bead phagosome. Immunofluorescence studies confirmed the scarcity of flotillin on BCG phagosomes and demonstrated an inverse correlation between bacterial metabolic activity and flotillin on M. tuberculosis phagosomes. By mass spectrometry, 447 human host proteins were identified on BCG phagosomes, and a partially overlapping set of 289 human proteins on latex bead phagosomes was identified. Interestingly, the majority of the proteins identified consistently on BCG phagosome preparations were also identified on latex bead phagosomes, indicating a high degree of overlap in protein composition of these two compartments. It is likely that many differences in protein composition are quantitative rather than qualitative in nature. Despite the remarkable overlap in protein composition, we consistently identified a number of proteins on the BCG phagosomes that were not identified in any of our latex bead phagosome preparations, including proteins involved in membrane trafficking and signal transduction, such as Ras GTPase-activating-like protein IQGAP1, and proteins of unknown function, such as FAM3C. Our phagosome purification procedure and initial proteomics analyses set the stage for a quantitative comparative analysis of mycobacterial and latex bead phagosome proteomes.
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) relies on cholesterol-laden lipid raft membrane microdomains for entry into and egress out of susceptible cells. In the present study, we examine the need for intracellular cholesterol trafficking pathways with respect to HIV-1 biogenesis using Niemann-Pick type C-1 (NPC1)-deficient (NPCD) cells, wherein these pathways are severely compromised, causing massive accumulation of cholesterol in late endosomal/lysosomal (LE/L) compartments. We have found that induction of an NPC disease-like phenotype through treatment of various cell types with the commonly used hydrophobic amine drug U18666A resulted in profound suppression of HIV-1 release. Further, NPCD Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphocytes and fibroblasts from patients with NPC disease infected with a CD4-independent strain of HIV-1 or transfected with an HIV-1 proviral clone, respectively, replicated HIV-1 poorly compared to normal cells. Infection of the NPCD fibroblasts with a vesicular stomatitis virus G-pseudotyped strain of HIV-1 produced similar results, suggesting a postentry block to HIV-1 replication in these cells. Examination of these cells using confocal microscopy showed an accumulation and stabilization of Gag in LE/L compartments. Additionally, normal HIV-1 production could be restored in NPCD cells upon expression of a functional NPC1 protein, and overexpression of NPC1 increased HIV-1 release. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that intact intracellular cholesterol trafficking pathways mediated by NPC1 are needed for efficient HIV-1 production.
The Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1 (NPC1L1) is a predicted polytopic membrane protein that is critical for cholesterol absorption. NPC1L1 takes up free cholesterol into cells through vesicular endocytosis. Ezetimibe, a clinically used cholesterol absorption inhibitor, blocks the endocytosis of NPC1L1 thereby inhibiting cholesterol uptake. Human NPC1L1 is a 1,332-amino acid protein with a putative sterol-sensing domain (SSD) that shows sequence homo-logy to HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), and SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP). Here, we use protease protection and immunofluorescence in selectively permeabilized cells to study the topology of human NPC1L1. Our data indicate that NPC1L1 contains 13 transmembrane helices. The NH2-terminus of NPC1L1 is in the lumen while the COOH-terminus projects to the cytosol. human NPC1L1 contains seven small cytoplasmic loops--four small and three large luminal loops--one of which has been reported to bind ezetimibe. Ezetimibe-glucuronide, the major metabolite of ezetimibe in vivo, can block the internalization of NPC1L1 and cholesterol. The membrane topology of NPC1L1 is similar to that of NPC1, and the putative SSD of NPC1L1 is oriented in the same manner as those of HMGCR, NPC1, and SCAP. The defined topology of NPC1L1 provides necessary information for further dissecting the functions of the different domains of NPC1L1.
The origins of cholesterol utilized by intestinal ABCA1 were investigated in the human intestinal cell line Caco-2. Influx of apical membrane cholesterol increases ABCA1 mRNA and mass, resulting in enhanced efflux of HDL-cholesterol. Luminal (micellar) cholesterol and newly synthesized cholesterol are not transported directly to ABCA1 but reach the ABCA1 pool after incorporation into the apical membrane. Depleting the apical or the basolateral membrane of cholesterol by cyclodextrin attenuates the amount of cholesterol transported by ABCA1 without altering ABCA1 expression. Filipin added to the apical side but not the basal side attenuates ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux, suggesting that apical membrane "microdomains," or rafts, supply cholesterol for HDL. Preventing cholesterol esterification increases the amount of cholesterol available for HDL. Ezetimibe, a Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 protein inhibitor, does not alter ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux. U18666A and imipramine, agents that mimic cholesterol trafficking defects of Neimann-Pick type C disease, attenuate cholesterol efflux without altering ABCA1 expression; thus, intestinal NPC1 may facilitate cholesterol movement to ABCA1. ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux is independent of cholesterol synthesis. The results suggest that following incorporation into plasma membrane and rafts of the apical membrane, dietary/biliary and newly synthesized cholesterol contribute to the ABCA1 pool and HDL-cholesterol. NPC1 may have a role in this process.
Various dietary factors affect postprandial metabolism yet precise mechanisms have not necessarily been pinpointed. The effects of various meal components on postprandial lipemia lead to the following question: do we need a standardized oral lipid tolerance test? A number of transporters, enzymes, receptors and hormones directly influence and act as "gatekeepers" of these processes. Each protein appears to have specific and individual functional roles in the overall process and selected developments in these areas will be reviewed. Within the intestinal cells, FABP2 (fatty acid-binding protein 2) and MTP (microsomal triglyceride transfer protein) are required for the formation of chylomicrons. Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1-L1) plays an important role in cholesterol absorption and provides a pharmacological target. Hormones such as GLP1 and GLP2 influence this absorption process. Within the periphery, lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a key gatekeeper of clearance. Of the massive amounts of fatty acids released by LPL, 36% escape peripheral adipose and muscle uptake and fatty acid overload can result in LPL product inhibition. Acylation stimulating protein (ASP) and insulin are two key hormones in maintaining efficient tissue uptake and re-esterification of fatty acids while TNFalpha negatively influences this process. In both ASP deficient (C3 KO) and C5L2 KO mice, postprandial lipemia increased with reduced adipose tissue storage. This is compensated by increased energy expenditure and muscle lipid oxidation. Clearance of hepatic remnants is controlled through many factors, including SR-B1 and ABCA1. Intestinal, peripheral and hepatic gatekeepers serve important and individual roles in regulating postprandial lipemia and provide potential targets for regulation.
Cystic fibrosis (CF) cells exhibit an increase in the protein expression of β-arrestin-2 (βarr2) coincident with perinuclear accumulation of free cholesterol. Arrestins are proteins that both serve as broad signaling regulators and contribute to G-protein coupled receptor internalization after agonist stimulation. The hypothesis of this study is that βarr2 is an important component in the mechanisms leading to cholesterol accumulation characteristic of CF cells. To test this hypothesis, epithelial cells stably expressing GFP-tagged βarr2 (βarr2-GFP) and respective GFP-expressing control cells (cont-GFP) were analyzed by filipin staining. The βarr2-GFP cells show a late endosomal/lysosomal cholesterol accumulation that is identical to that seen in CF cells. This βarr2-mediated accumulation is sensitive to Rp-cAMPS treatment, and depleting βarr2 expression in CF-model cells by shRNA alleviates cholesterol accumulation compared with controls. Cftr/βarr2 double knockout mice also exhibit wild-type (WT) levels of cholesterol synthesis, and WT profiles of signaling protein expression have previously been shown to be altered in CF due to cholesterol-related pathways. These data indicate a significant regulatory role for βarr2 in the development of CF-like cholesterol accumulation and give further insight into cholesterol processing mechanisms. An impact of βarr2 expression on Niemann-Pick type C-1 (NPC1)-containing organelle movement is proposed as the mechanism of βarr2-mediated alterations on cholesterol processing. It is concluded that βarr2 expression contributes to altered cholesterol trafficking observed in CF cells.
The B-containing lipoproteins are the transporters of cholesterol, and the evidence suggests that the apo B48-containing postprandial chylomicron particles and the triglyceride-rich very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles play an important part in the development of the plaque both directly and indirectly by their impact on LDL composition. The ratio of dietary to synthesised cholesterol is variable but tightly regulated: hence intervention with diet at best reduces serum cholesterol by &lt;20% andusually &lt;10%. Statins are the mainstay of cholesterol reduction therapy, but they increase cholesterol absorption, an example of the relationship between synthesis and absorption. Inhibition of cholesterol absorption with Ezetimibe, an inhibitor of Niemann Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1-L1), the major regulator of cholesterol absorption, increases cholesterol synthesis and hence the value of adding an inhibitor of cholesterol absorption to an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis. Apo B48, the structural protein of the chylomicron particle, is synthesised in abundance so that the release of these particles is dependent on the amount of cholesterol and triglyceride available in the intestine. This paper will discuss cholesterol absorption and synthesis, chylomicron formation, and the effect of postprandial lipoproteins on factors involved in atherosclerosis.
Some studies have indicated that dietary cholesterol has a role in the progression of liver fibrosis. We investigated the mechanisms by which dietary cholesterol might contribute to hepatic fibrogenesis.
C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-cholesterol diet or a control diet for 4 weeks; liver fibrosis then was induced by bile-duct ligation or carbon tetrachloride administration. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) were isolated from mice fed high-cholesterol diets or from Niemann-Pick type C1-deficient mice, which accumulate intracellular free cholesterol.
After bile-duct ligation or carbon tetrachloride administration, mice fed high-cholesterol diets had significant increases in liver fibrosis and activation of HSCs compared with mice fed control diets. There were no significant differences in the degree of hepatocellular injury or liver inflammation, including hepatocyte apoptosis or Kupffer cell activation, between mice fed high-cholesterol or control diets. Levels of free cholesterol were much higher in HSCs from mice fed high-cholesterol diets than those fed control diets. In cultured HSCs, accumulation of free cholesterol in HSCs increased levels of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), leading to down-regulation of bone morphogenetic protein and activin membrane-bound inhibitor (a pseudoreceptor for transforming growth factor [TGF]β); the HSCs became sensitized to TGFβ-induced activation. Liver fibrosis was not aggravated by the high-cholesterol diet in C3H/HeJ mice, which express a mutant form of TLR4; HSCs that express mutant TLR4 were not activated by accumulation of free cholesterol.
Dietary cholesterol aggravates liver fibrosis because free cholesterol accumulates in HSCs, leading to increased TLR4 signaling, down-regulation of bone morphogenetic protein and activin membrane-bound inhibitor, and sensitization of HSC to TGFβ. This pathway might be targeted by antifibrotic therapies.
Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by accumulation of free cholesterol in late endosomes/lysosomes. The pathological basis for the disease has been poorly understood yet. In our previous study, we have demonstrated that synaptic function is impaired in this disease. In the current study, electrophysiological and fluorescent dyes studies were used to determine whether the synaptic defects result from presynaptic or postsynaptic contributions. Furthermore, we would like to ascertain whether such defects are caused by direct effect of NPC1 deficiency in neurons or indirect effect of NPC1 deficiency in glial cells. Both mean inter-event interval of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) were significantly larger in NPC1(-/-) neurons than those in the wild-type neurons, while the amplitudes and the receptor kinetics were not different compared with those in wild-type controls. Synaptic vesicle exocytosis was also slower in the NPC1(-/-) neurons. The mean time constant of destaining was larger in NPC1(-/-) neurons than in wild-type controls both in the presence and absence of glial cells. All these results indicated a general presynaptic functional impairment in the NPC1(-/-) neurons and such defects were not dependent of glial cells. Therefore, neuropathology characteristics of NPC diseases may be a more possible consequence of neuronal presynaptic dysfunction than indirect defects in glial cells.
Vitamin E is an essential fat-soluble micronutrient for higher mammals and functions as an antioxidant for lipids and also as a regulator of gene expression and a modulator of cell signaling and proliferation. To exert its physiological functions, vitamin E must achieve an appropriate disposition throughout the body via several processes, such as intestinal absorption, uptake and efflux in peripheral tissues and biliary secretion. In this review, we mainly discuss membrane proteins involved in these transport processes (ATP-binding cassette transporter A1, scavenger receptor class B type I, Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 and multidrug resistance 3) and vitamin E-mediated regulation of their expression.
The two known complementation groups of Niemann-Pick Type C disease, NPC1 and NPC2, result from non-allelic protein defects. Both the NPC1 and NPC2 (HE1) gene products are intimately involved in cholesterol and glycolipid trafficking and/or transport. We describe mutation analysis on samples from 143 unrelated affected NPC patients using conformation sensitive gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing as the primary mutation screening methods for NPC1 and NPC2, respectively. These methods are robust, sensitive, and do not require any specialized laboratory equipment. Analyses identified two NPC1 mutations for 115 (80.4%) patients, one NPC1 mutation for 10 (7.0%) patients, two NPC2 mutations for five (3.5%) patients, one NPC2 mutation for one (0.7%) patient, and no mutations for 12 (8.4%) patients. Thus, mutations were identified on 251 of 286 (88%) disease alleles, including 121 different mutations (114 in NPC1 and seven in NPC2), 58 of which are previously unreported. The most common NPC1 mutation, I1061T, was detected on 18% of NPC alleles. Other NPC1 mutations were mostly private, missense mutations located throughout the gene with clustering in the cysteine-rich luminal domain. Correlation with biochemical data suggests classification of several mutations as severe and others as moderate or variable. The region between amino acids 1038 and 1253, which shares 35% identity with Patched 1, appears to be a hot spot for mutations. Additionally, a high percentage of mutations were located at amino acids identical to the NPC1 homolog, NPC1L1. Biochemical complementation analysis of cases negative for mutations revealed a high percentage of equivocal results where the complementation group appeared to be non-NPC1 and non-NPC2. This raises the possibilities of an additional NPC complementation group(s) or non-specificity of the biochemical testing for NPC. These caveats must be considered when offering mutation testing as a clinical service.
Cholesterol accumulation in an aberrant endosomal/lysosomal compartment is the hallmark of Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease. To gain insight into the etiology of the NPC compartment, we studied a novel Chinese hamster ovary cell mutant that was identified through a genetic screen and phenocopies the NPC1 mutation. We show that the M87 mutant harbors a mutation in a gene distinct from the NPC1 and HE1/NPC2 disease genes. M87 cells have increased total cellular cholesterol with accumulation in an aberrant compartment that contains LAMP-1, LAMP-2, and NPC1, but not CI-MPR, similar to the cholesterol-rich compartment in NPC mutant cells. We demonstrate that low-density lipoprotein receptor activity is increased 3-fold in the M87 mutant, and likely contributes to accumulation of excess cholesterol. In contrast to NPC1-null cells, the M87 mutant exhibits normal rates of delivery of endosomal cholesterol to the endoplasmic reticulum and to the plasma membrane. The preserved late endosomal function in the M87 mutant is associated with the presence of NPC1-containing multivesicular late endosomes and supports a role for these multivesicular late endosomes in the sorting and distribution of cholesterol. Our findings implicate cholesterol overload in the formation of an NPC-like compartment that is independent of inhibition of NPC1 or HE1/NPC2 function.
Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is characterized by an accumulation of cholesterol in most tissues and progressive neurodegeneration with the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Neurofibrillary tangles are composed of paired helical filaments (PHF), a major component of which is the hyperphosphorylated tau. In this study we used NPC heterozygous and NPC homozygous mouse brains to investigate the molecular mechanism responsible for tauopathy in NPC. Immunoblot analysis using anti-tau antibodies (Tau-1, PHF-1, AT-180, and AT-100) revealed site-specific phosphorylation of tau at Ser-396 and Ser-404 in the brains of NPC homozygous mice. Mitogen-activated protein kinase, a potential serine kinase known to phosphorylate tau, was activated, whereas other serine kinases such as glycogen synthase kinase-3beta and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 were inactive. Morphological examination demonstrated that a number of neurons, the perikarya of which strongly immunostained with PHF-1, exhibited polymorphorous cytoplasmic inclusion bodies and multi-concentric lamellar-like bodies. Importantly, the accumulation of intracellular cholesterol in NPC mouse brains was determined to be a function of age. From these results we conclude that abnormal cholesterol metabolism due to the genetic mutation in NPC1 may be responsible for activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase-signaling pathway and site-specific phosphorylation of tau in vivo, leading to tauopathy in NPC.
Holoprosencephaly, or an undivided forebrain, is a complex brain malformation associated with Sonic hedgehog (Shh) mutations. Other causes of holoprosencephaly have converged upon the Shh signaling pathway: genetic and pharmacologic impairment of cholesterol synthesis, and the action of the steroidal alkaloid cyclopamine. This review focuses on recent studies aimed at determining how Shh signaling is affected by these causes of holoprosencephaly, whether they involve a common mechanism and the role played by cholesterol. Cholesterol is potentially important for both biogenesis of Shh and in signal transduction in Shh-responsive cells. Teratogens that induce holoprosencephaly appear to affect Shh signal transduction rather than Shh biogenesis. Analysis of these agents and other compounds that affect various aspects of cellular cholesterol distribution indicates that the role of cholesterol in Shh signal transduction is novel and complicated. The similarity of the Shh receptor, Patched (Ptc), to the Niemann-Pick Cl protein, which is involved in the vesicular trafficking of cholesterol, provides insight into the role of cholesterol and the action of compounds like cyclopamine.
Polarised trafficking of proteins is critical for normal expression of the epithelial phenotype, but its genetic control is not understood. The regulatory gene lin-26 is essential for normal epithelial differentiation in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. To identify potential effectors of lin-26, we characterised mutations that result in lin-26-like phenotypes. Here, we report the phenotypic and molecular analysis of one such mutant line, che-14.
Mutations in che-14 resulted in several partially penetrant phenotypes affecting the function of most epithelial or epithelial-like cells of the ectoderm, including the hypodermis, excretory canal, vulva, rectum and several support cells. The defects were generally linked to the accumulation of vesicles or amorphous material near the apical surface, suggesting that secretion was defective. The CHE-14 protein showed similarity to proteins containing sterol-sensing domains, including Dispatched, Patched and NPC1. A fusion protein between full-length CHE-14 and the green fluorescent protein became localised to the apical surface of epithelial cells that require che-14 function. Deletions that removed the predicted transmembrane domains or extracellular loops of CHE-14 abolished apical localisation and function of the protein.
We propose that CHE-14 is involved in a novel secretory pathway dedicated to the exocytosis of lipid-modified proteins at the apical surface of certain epithelial cells. Our data raise the possibility that the primordial function of proteins containing a sterol-sensing domain is to control vesicle trafficking: CHE-14 and Dispatched in exocytosis, Patched and NPC1 in endocytosis.
Treatment for dyslipidemia in diabetes reduces cardiovascular events. Diabetes is associated with major abnormalities in fatty acid metabolism. The resulting disturbance results in an abnormal lipoprotein cascade from the large chylomicron through to the small HDL particle. This suggests that drugs that alter formation of the chylomicron particle might have a very important role in diabetic dyslipidemia. Achieving normal glycemia will reverse the abnormalities in fatty acid metabolism, but this is difficult, particularly as the disease progresses. Genes that regulate cholesterol absorption and excretion have been described (Niemann Pick C1-like 1 [NPC1-L1] and ATP binding cassette proteins [ABC] G5 and G8). An effective NPC1-L1 inhibitor (ezetimibe) improves the reduction in cholesterol caused by statins. Agonists of ABCG5 and G8 may become important in the treatment of dyslipidemia. Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) is responsible for the assembly of the chylomicron and VLDL particles. New MTP inhibitors, acting only on the intestine, are exciting possible treatments. The advisability of sitosterol-enriched foods to lower cholesterol may have to be reassessed for patients with diabetes, since these products may lead to an increase in chylomicron sitosterol in diabetic patients. More successful treatment of diabetic dyslipidemia is essential if we are to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease so commonly found in diabetes.
NPC1L1 (Niemann-Pick C1-like 1), the pharmacological target of the cholesterol-uptake inhibitor ezetimibe, is a transporter localized on the brush border of enterocytes. Although this protein plays a key role in intestinal uptake of sterols, multiple molecular events that underlie intestinal cholesterol absorption have not been fully characterized. Two proteins that might be involved in this process are NPC1 and NPC2 (Niemann-Pick disease type C proteins 1 and 2), which function in the endosomal/lysosomal cholesterol egress pathway and whose deficiency results in NPC (Niemann-Pick type C) disease. The involvement of these proteins in intestinal cholesterol absorption was examined in mutant mice lacking either NPC1 or NPC2. Our data indicate that deficiencies in either protein do not have an effect on cholesterol uptake or absorption. This contrasts with recent results obtained for the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster, which indicate that a deficiency of NPC1 (dNPC1a being its Drosophila homologue) leads to activation of an NPC1L1 (Drosophila homologue dNPC1b)-independent cholesterol uptake pathway, underscoring fundamental differences in mammalian and non-mammalian cholesterol metabolism.
Niemann-Pick C (NPC) disease is an autosomal recessive lipid storage disorder characterized by a disruption of sphingolipid and cholesterol trafficking that produces cognitive impairment, ataxia and death, often in childhood. Most cases are caused by loss of function mutations in the Npc1 gene, which encodes a protein that localizes to late endosomes and functions in lipid sorting and vesicle trafficking. Here, we demonstrate that NPC1-deficient primary human fibroblasts, like npc1(-/-) mice fibroblasts, showed increased autophagy as evidenced by elevated LC3-II levels, numerous autophagic vacuoles and enhanced degradation of long-lived proteins. Autophagy because of NPC1 deficiency was associated with increased expression of Beclin-1 rather than activation of the Akt-mTOR-p70 S6K signaling pathway, and siRNA knockdown of Beclin-1 decreased long-lived protein degradation. Induction of cholesterol trafficking defects in wild-type fibroblasts by treatment with U18666A increased Beclin-1 and LC3-II expression, whereas treatment of NPC1-deficient fibroblasts with sphingolipid-lowering compound NB-DGJ failed to alter the expression of either Beclin-1 or LC3-II. Primary fibroblasts from patients with two other sphingolipid storage diseases, NPC2 deficiency and Sandhoff disease, characterized by sphingolipid trafficking defects also showed elevation in Beclin-1 and LC3-II levels. In contrast, Gaucher disease fibroblasts, which traffic sphingolipids normally, showed wild-type levels of Beclin-1 and LC3-II. Our data define a critical role for Beclin-1 in the activation of autophagy because of NPC1 deficiency, and reveal an unexpected role for lipid trafficking in the regulation of this pathway in patients with several sphingolipid storage diseases.
Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) 1 protein plays important roles in moving cholesterol and other lipids out of late endosomes by means of vesicular trafficking, but it is not known whether NPC1 directly interacts with cholesterol. We performed photoaffinity labeling of intact cells expressing fluorescent protein (FP)-tagged NPC1 by using [(3)H]7,7-azocholestanol ([(3)H]AC). After immunoprecipitation, (3)H-labeled NPC1-GFP appeared as a single band. Including excess unlabeled sterol to the labeling reaction significantly diminished the labeling. Altering the NPC1 sterol-sensing domain (SSD) with loss-of-function mutations (P692S and Y635C) severely reduced the extent of labeling. To further demonstrate the specificity of labeling, we show that NPC2, a late endosomal/lysosomal protein that binds to cholesterol with high affinity, is labeled, whereas mutant NPC2 proteins inactive in binding cholesterol are not. Vamp7, an abundant late endosomal membrane protein without an SSD but with one transmembrane domain, cannot be labeled. Binding between [(3)H]AC and NPC1 does not require NPC2. Treating cells with either U-18666A, a compound that creates an NPC-like phenotype, or with bafilomycin A1, a compound that raises late endosomal pH, has no effect on labeling of NPC1-YFP, suggesting that both drugs affect processes other than NPC1 binding to cholesterol. We also developed a procedure to label the NPC1-YFP by [(3)H]AC in vitro and showed that cholesterol is more effective in protection against labeling than its analogs epicholesterol or 5-alpha-cholestan. Overall, the results demonstrate that there is direct binding between NPC1 and azocholestanol; the binding does not require NPC2 but requires a functional SSD within NPC1.
Recently, a new class of lipid-lowering agents has been described that upregulate LDL receptor (LDLr) activity. These agents are proposed to activate sterol-regulated gene expression through binding to the sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) cleavage-activating protein (SCAP). Here, we show that the steroidal LDLr upregulator, GW707, induces accumulation of lysosomal free cholesterol and inhibits LDL-stimulated cholesterol esterification, similar to that observed in U18666A-treated cells and in Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) mutants. Moreover, we demonstrate that induction of the NPC-like phenotype by GW707 is independent of SCAP function. We find that treatment with GW707 does not increase SREBP-dependent gene expression above that observed in lipoprotein-starved cells. Rather, we show that the apparent increase in SREBP-dependent activity in GW707-treated cells is attributable to a failure to appropriately suppress sterol-regulated gene expression, as has been shown previously for U18666A-treated cells and NPC mutant fibroblasts. We further demonstrate that cells treated with either GW707 or U18666A fail to appropriately generate 27-hydroxycholesterol in response to LDL cholesterol. Taken together, these findings support a mechanism in which GW707 exerts its hypolipidemic effects through disruption of late endosomal/lysosomal sterol trafficking and subsequent stimulation of LDLr activity.
Several neurological and systemic diseases can cause dementia, beyond Alzheimer's disease. Rare genetic causes are often responsible for dementia with atypical features. Recently, mutations causative for Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC) have also been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. NPC is an autosomal recessive lipid storage disorder caused by mutations in NPC1 and NPC2 genes. In adults, clinical presentation mimicking other neurodegenerative diseases makes diagnosis difficult. Recent evidence suggests that heterozygous mutations in NPC genes may take on etiological significance.
To investigate the presence of NPC1 and NPC2 mutations in adults affected by neurodegenerative dementia plus.
We performed a genetic screening on 50 patients using a wide clinical and biochemical approach to characterize the phenotype of mutated patients.
Sequencing analysis revealed four different and known heterozygous mutations in NPC1 and NPC2 genes. Patient 1 carried the p. F284LfsX26 in NPC1 and was affected by progressive supranuclear palsy-like syndrome. The remaining three patients showed a corticobasal syndrome and harbored the c.441+1G&gt;A variant of NPC2 (patient 2), the missense p.N222 S mutation associated with the c.1947+8G&gt;C variant in the splice region of intron 12 in NPC1 (patient 3), and the p.V30M mutation in NPC2 (patient 4), respectively. Filipin staining was abnormal in patients 1 and 2. mRNA analysis revealed an altered splicing of the NPC2 gene in patient 2.
Heterozygous mutations of NPC1 and NPC2 genes could contribute to dementia plus, at least in a subset of patients. We highlight the occurrence of NPC1 and NPC2 heterozygous variants in dementia-plus as pathological event.
Niemann-Pick type C disease is an autosomal recessive storage disorder, characterized by abnormal sequestration of unesterified cholesterol within the late endolysosomal compartment of cells and accumulation of gangliosides and other sphingolipids. Progressive neurological deterioration and insurgence of symptoms like ataxia, seizure, and cognitive decline until severe dementia are pathognomonic features of the disease. Here, we studied synaptic plasticity phenomena and evaluated ERKs activation in the hippocampus of BALB/c NPC1-/- mice, a well described animal model of the disease. Our results demonstrated an impairment of both induction and maintenance of long term synaptic potentiation in NPC1-/- mouse slices, associated with the lack of ERKs phosphorylation. We then investigated the effects of Miglustat, a recent approved drug for the treatment of NPCD. We found that in vivo Miglustat administration in NPC1-/- mice was able to rescue synaptic plasticity deficits, to restore ERKs activation and to counteract hyperexcitability. Overall, these data indicate that Miglustat may be effective for treating the neurological deficits associated with NPCD, such as seizures and dementia. 
Misexpression of the AtNPC1 - 1 and AtNPC1 - 2 genes leads to altered sphingolipid metabolism, growth impairment, and male reproductive defects in a hemizygous Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) double-mutant population. Abolishing the expression of both gene copies has lethal effects. Niemann-Pick disease type C1 is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the NPC1 gene. At the cellular level, the disorder is characterized by the accumulation of storage lipids and lipid trafficking defects. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains two genes (At1g42470 and At4g38350) with weak homology to mammalian NPC1. The corresponding proteins have 11 predicted membrane-spanning regions and contain a putative sterol-sensing domain. The At1g42470 protein is localized to the plasma membrane, while At4g38350 protein has a dual localization in the plasma and tonoplast membranes. A phenotypic analysis of T-DNA insertion mutants indicated that At1g42470 and At4g38350 (designated AtNPC1-1 and AtNPC1-2, respectively) have partially redundant functions and are essential for plant reproductive viability and development. Homozygous plants impaired in the expression of both genes were not recoverable. Plants of a hemizygous AtNPC1-1/atnpc1-1/atnpc1-2/atnpc1-2 population were severely dwarfed and exhibited male gametophytic defects. These gene disruptions did not have an effect on sterol concentrations; however, hemizygous AtNPC1-1/atnpc1-1/atnpc1-2/atnpc1-2 mutants had increased fatty acid amounts. Among these, fatty acid α-hydroxytetracosanoic acid (h24:0) occurs in plant sphingolipids. Follow-up analyses confirmed the accumulation of significantly increased levels of sphingolipids (assayed as hydrolyzed sphingoid base component) in the hemizygous double-mutant population. Certain effects of NPC1 misexpression may be common across divergent lineages of eukaryotes (sphingolipid accumulation), while other defects (sterol accumulation) may occur only in certain groups of eukaryotic organisms.
The role of ezetimibe in lowering plasma cholesterol has been established; however, controversy remains about its clinical benefit. A recent study utilizes naturally occurring genetic variation within the NPC1-like 1 gene (NPC1L1) to demonstrate the potential for pharmacologic inhibition of the protein to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. This research demonstrates the application of the concept of genocopy to a population-based validation of NPC1L1 as a therapeutic target. 
Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC) is a rare, neurovisceral, autosomal recessive disease, with an extremely heterogeneous clinical presentation. The adult form of the disease is usually expressed as a neurological form. Non-specific psychiatric symptoms are often associated with NPC. For some cases, it can also be expressed as an isolated psychiatric disorder form. Since 2009, the launching of a medicine called miglustat has helped to improve the disease evolution.
We report two siblings followed-up in the same department of psychiatry and with an atypical psychotic symptomatology. Case 1 is a 27-year-old French male. He was hospitalised several times due to disordered behaviour, psychomotor excitation, mood instability and wandering. He was originally diagnosed with schizophrenia. However, the patient's psychosis proved refractory to treatment. He also exhibited a number of neurological signs (pyramidal signs and abnormal movements of the hands, head and limbs), which were considered related to his antipsychotic medication. Three years later, a full physical, neurological and neuropsychological examination revealed various neurological and visceral symptoms. He was diagnosed with NPC based on a classical biochemical NPC-phenotype following filipin staining in cultured skin fibroblasts. NPC1 gene sequencing revealed that he was a compound heterozygote for the p.S954L and p.N1156S mutations. The patient's psychiatric and neurological symptoms are currently stabilized by miglustat, allowing the patient to cease antipsychotic medication. Case 2 is the elder sister of Case 1. She was hospitalised several times due to acute delirium, hallucinations and suicidal tendencies. She was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia at 22 years of age. She has received a variety of typical and atypical antipsychotics. Many of these drugs proved initially effective but the patient's symptoms repeatedly returned. The patient shows persistent and worsening gait disorder and abnormal arm movements. A follow-up neurological examination at age 29 did not detect any ataxia, cataplexy or vertical supra-nuclear gaze palsy. Direct NPC1 gene sequencing detected a mutant NPC1 allele held in common with her brother, but full sequencing of both the NPC1 and NPC2 genes and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) did not detect any other pathogenic mutation or other anomalies.
Because NPC is an autosomal recessive condition, heterozygous individuals carrying only one causal gene mutation are usually asymptomatic. Thus, while the accepted wisdom would suggest that patient 2 is not affected by the disease, it is interesting to consider why she has developed neurological and psychiatric disorders like her brother. Several hypotheses are discussed: mental expression in heterozygous genetic factor predisposing to schizophrenia, comorbidity or fortuitous association. It is not currently known whether a patient with a single NPC gene mutation can express NPC in full, partially, or perhaps just to a minimal degree. This case of a patient with a heterozygous "carrier" NPC genotype and neuropsychiatric disorders suggestive of the disease raises the possibility that symptomatic heterozygous NPC patients may exist. On the other hand, if the heterozygous genotype of patient 2 does not give rise to symptomatic disease, it is pertinent to question whether it could be a predisposing factor for the development of psychiatric pathologies. There are currently no published data on the occurrence of heterozygous NPC1 or NPC2 mutations among patients with atypical psychiatric presentations combined with neurological symptoms. Conversely, there are no published data demonstrating an increased frequency of psychiatric disorders in families affected by NPC. Finally, in view of the history of psychiatric disorders in this family, it is possible that psychosis simply occurred concomitantly with symptomatic NPC in patient 1 by chance, and that schizophrenia occurred simultaneously with an asymptomatic NPC carrier genotype in patient 2. To investigate this further, NPC patients' carrier family members (parents and siblings) should be fully screened for signs suggestive of the disease.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and a rare inherited disorder of cholesterol transport, Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) share several similarities including aberrant APP processing and increased Aβ production. Previously, we have shown that the AD-like phenotype in NPC model cells involves cholesterol-dependent enhanced APP cleavage by β-secretase and accumulation of both APP and BACE1 within endocytic compartments. Since retrograde transport of BACE1 from endocytic compartments to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) is regulated by the Golgi-localized γ-ear containing ADP ribosylation factor-binding protein 1 (GGA1), we analyzed in this work a potential role of GGA1 in the AD-like phenotype of NPC1-null cells. Overexpression of GGA1 caused a shift in APP processing towards the non-amyloidogenic pathway by increasing the localization of APP at the cell surface. However, the observed effect appear to be independent on the subcellular localization and phosphorylation state of BACE1. These findings show that the AD-like phenotype of NPC model cells can be partly reverted by promoting a non-amyloidogenic processing of APP through the upregulation of GGA1 supporting its preventive role against AD. 
Ebola virus (EBOV) entry requires the virion surface-associated glycoprotein (GP) that is composed of a trimer of heterodimers (GP1/GP2). The GP1 subunit contains two heavily glycosylated domains, the glycan cap and the mucin-like domain (MLD). The glycan cap contains only N-linked glycans, whereas the MLD contains both N- and O-linked glycans. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on EBOV GP1 to systematically disrupt N-linked glycan sites to gain an understanding of their role in GP structure and function. All 15 N-glycosylation sites of EBOV GP1 could be removed without compromising the expression of GP. The loss of these 15 glycosylation sites significantly enhanced pseudovirion transduction in Vero cells, which correlated with an increase in protease sensitivity. Interestingly, exposing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) by removing the glycan shield did not allow interaction with the endosomal receptor, NPC1, indicating that the glycan cap/MLD domains mask RBD residues required for binding. The effects of the loss of GP1 N-linked glycans on Ca(2+)-dependent (C-type) lectin (CLEC)-dependent transduction were complex, and the effect was unique for each of the CLECs tested. Surprisingly, EBOV entry into murine peritoneal macrophages was independent of GP1 N-glycans, suggesting that CLEC-GP1 N-glycan interactions are not required for entry into this important primary cell. Finally, the removal of all GP1 N-glycans outside the MLD enhanced antiserum and antibody sensitivity. In total, our results provide evidence that the conserved N-linked glycans on the EBOV GP1 core protect GP from antibody neutralization despite the negative impact the glycans have on viral entry efficiency.
Filovirus outbreaks occur sporadically throughout central Africa, causing high fatality rates among the general public and health care workers. These unpredictable hemorrhagic fever outbreaks are caused by multiple species of Ebola viruses, as well as Marburg virus. While filovirus vaccines and therapeutics are being developed, there are no licensed products. The sole viral envelope glycoprotein, which is a principal immunogenic target, contains a heavy shield of glycans surrounding the conserved receptor-binding domain. We find that disruption of this shield through targeted mutagenesis leads to an increase in cell entry, protease sensitivity, and antiserum/antibody sensitivity but is not sufficient to allow virion binding to the intracellular receptor NPC1. Therefore, our studies provide evidence that filoviruses maintain glycoprotein glycosylation to protect against proteases and antibody neutralization at the expense of efficient entry. Our results unveil interesting insights into the unique entry process of filoviruses and potential immune evasion tactics of the virus.
Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC) is a rare autosomal recessive lipid storage disease characterized by progressive neurodegeneration. As only a few studies have been conducted on the impact of NPC on sensory systems, we used a mutant mouse model (NPC1(-/-)) to examine the effects of this disorder to morphologically distinct regions of the olfactory system, namely the olfactory epithelium (OE) and olfactory bulb (OB).
For structural and functional analysis immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, western blotting, and electrophysiology have been applied. For histochemistry and western blotting, we used antibodies against a series of neuronal and glia marker proteins, as well as macrophage markers. NPC1(-/-) animals present myelin-like lysosomal deposits in virtually all types of cells of the peripheral and central olfactory system. Especially supporting cells of the OE and central glia cells are affected, resulting in pronounced astrocytosis and microgliosis in the OB and other olfactory cortices. Up-regulation of Galectin-3, Cathepsin D and GFAP in the cortical layers of the OB underlines the critical role and location of the OB as a possible entrance gate for noxious substances. Unmyelinated olfactory afferents of the lamina propria seem less affected than ensheathing cells. Supporting the structural findings, electro-olfactometry of the olfactory mucosa suggests that NPC1(-/-) animals exhibit olfactory and trigeminal deficits.
Our data demonstrate a pronounced neurodegeneration and glia activation in the olfactory system of NPC1(-/-), which is accompanied by sensory deficits.
Niemann-Pick type C1 disease (NPC1) is a rare progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the NPC1 gene. In this lysosomal storage disorder the intracellular transport and sequestration of several lipids like cholesterol is severely impaired, resulting in an accumulation of lipids in late endosomes and lysosomes. The neurological manifestation of the disease is caused by dysfunction and cell death in the central nervous system. Several animal models were used to analyze the impaired pathways. However, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms are still not completely understood and the genetic variability in humans cannot be reflected in these models. Therefore, a human model using patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells provides a promising approach.
We reprogrammed human fibroblasts from a NPC1 patient and a healthy control by retroviral transduction with Oct4, Klf4, Sox2 and c-Myc. The obtained human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) were characterized by immunocytochemical analyses. Neural progenitor cells were generated and patch clamp recordings were performed for a functional analysis of derived neuronal cells. Filipin stainings and the Amplex Red assay were used to demonstrate and quantify cholesterol accumulation.
The hiPSCs expressed different stem cell markers, e.g. Nanog, Tra-1-81 and SSEA4. Using the embryoid body assay, the cells were differentiated in cells of all three germ layers and induced teratoma in immunodeficient mice, demonstrating their pluripotency. In addition, neural progenitor cells were derived and differentiated into functional neuronal cells. Patch clamp recordings revealed voltage dependent channels, spontaneous action potentials and postsynaptic currents. The accumulation of cholesterol in different tissues is the main hallmark of NPC1. In this study we found an accumulation of cholesterol in fibroblasts of a NPC1 patient, derived hiPSCs, and neural progenitor cells, but not in cells derived from fibroblasts of a healthy individual. These findings were quantified by the Amplex Red assay, demonstrating a significantly elevated cholesterol level in cells derived from fibroblasts of a NPC1 patient.
We generated a neuronal model based on induced pluripotent stem cells derived from patient fibroblasts, providing a human in vitro model to study the pathogenic mechanisms of NPC1 disease.
Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC) is a rare hereditary disease, which psychiatrists do not face often in France. Indeed, only a couple of articles specifically describing the psychiatric-disorders in the adult form have been published. And for the most part, they were not written by psychiatrists. This comprehensive international literature review aims at providing knowledge on this disease to French psychiatrists.
To achieve this literature review, we used the "PubMed" search engine, looking for the following keywords: Niemann-Pick type C AND (schizophrenia OR psychosis).
Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC) is a rare, neurovisceral, autosomal recessive disease, with an extremely heterogeneous clinical presentation. It is characterized by a wide range of symptoms that are not specific, such as neurological, systemic or psychiatric symptoms. The adult form of the disease concerns a small proportion (5 %) of the people affected and is usually expressed as a neurological form. A variety of progressive and disabling symptoms are encountered, mainly cerebellar signs (cerebellar ataxia, impaired gait, dysarthria), but also movement disorders, cataplexy, seizures and dysphagia. Patients face constant cognitive deterioration, which can result in severe dementia. Abnormal saccadic eye movement is often the first manifestation of the disease. Supranuclear gaze palsy is considered to be a specific sign and should be systematically searched for. In terms of systemic signs, the usual infantile hepatosplenomegaly is very fickle in the adult form; if present, it is usually asymptomatic. Non-specific psychiatric symptoms are often associated with NPC disease. For one third of cases, it can also express as an isolated psychiatric-disorder form, such as schizophrenia-like psychosis (paranoid delusions, auditory hallucinations, interpretative thoughts, and disorganization), depression, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive behaviour and behavioural problems (sleep disorders, hyperactivity, agitation, aggressiveness or self-mutilations). This psychiatric overview is mostly atypical and is accompanied by visual hallucinations, confusion, symptom fluctuations, treatment resistance or aggravation with neuroleptic drugs, catatonia, progressive cognitive decline, but also seizures. The late appearance of neurological manifestations is often wrongfully attributed to the effects of antipsychotic medication, which generates tardy diagnosis. Most of NPC affected patients die prematurely. NPC diagnosis is based on a filipin test on a fibroblast culture from a skin biopsy and also on a sequencing of the NPC1 and NPC2 genes. Routine laboratory biochemistry profiles are generally normal. The early diagnosis is fundamental to deploy the best follow-up care. The patient should therefore be in contact with a reference centre. Until recently, NPC treatment consisted in supportive therapies and symptomatic drugs, useful, however, with variable efficacy. The recent discovery of a medicine called Miglustat (N-butyldeoxynojirimycin; NB-DJN; Zavesca(®), Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd.) which improves the disease evolution, should encourage psychiatrists to look for it in every atypical psychosis.
Inflammatory cell activation plays a key role in atherosclerotic plaque growth and acute complications. While secretion of proteases and inflammatory cytokines are likely involved in the development of plaque instability, the precise mechanistic pathways are not well understood.
Based on our previous study, we crossed Toll-like receptor 3 (Tlr3)(-/-) mice with a unique BALB-Apoe(-/-)Npc1(-/-) plaque complication-susceptible mouse model, as well as the widely-used B6-Ldlr(-/-) atherosclerosis model, to test the role of TLR3 signaling in the development of plaque instability. TLR3-deficient mice showed no change in aortic root lesion area, but displayed a marked increase in collagen and smooth muscle cell (SMC) content of lesions. Notably, Apoe(-/-)Npc1(-/-)Tlr3(-/-) mice exhibited a 50% reduction in the incidence of medial destruction, a precursor to aortic aneurysm formation. MMP-2 activity was markedly reduced in aortic extracts from Apoe(-/-)Npc1(-/-)Tlr3(-/-) compared to controls, while both MMP-2 and -9 activities were reduced in Ldlr(-/-)Tlr3(-/-) extracts. Consistent with the in vivo data, TLR3 deficiency suppressed MMP-2 activity induced by TNF-α or polyinosine-polycytidylic acid in macrophages from Apoe(-/-)Npc1(-/-) mice.
TLR3 plays a critical role in regulating the degradation of extracellular matrix in lesions, in part by modulation of macrophage MMP-2 and -9 activities.
To address the effects of ezetimibe on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism, the HDL subclasses, cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) were measured in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).  Twenty-three hypercholesterolemic patients with T2DM were treated with 10 mg of ezetimibe daily for 12 weeks.  Plasma total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (C), HDL-C, HDL(2)-C, HDL(3)-C, CETP mass, and LCAT activity were measured.  HDL-C and HDL(2)-C increased by 5% (p&lt;0.05) and 12% (p&lt;0.01), respectively, in response to ezetimibe.  Of the 23 patients, 21 had decreased CETP mass, which led to an average reduction of 20% (p&lt;0.0001).  LCAT activity also decreased by 6% (p&lt;0.01).  A significant positive correlation was found in the changes from baseline between HDL(2)-C and CETP mass, whereas a significant inverse relationship was observed between HDL(3)-C and CETP mass.  Furthermore, the change in HDL-C was positively correlated with the change in LCAT activity.  In conclusion, ezetimibe may affect HDL metabolism and reverse cholesterol transport, especially CETP, in T2DM.  These observations may provide some insights into how ezetimibe prevents atherosclerosis.
We have previously shown that decreased dosage of Niemann-Pick C1 (Npc1) protein, caused by heterozygosity at the null mutation, Npc1 (nih), locus, causes altered lipid metabolism in mice. When studied on the "lean" BALB/cJ genetic background, the decreased protein was associated with no weight changes in either males or females when on a regular diet but increased weights and adiposity when on a high fat diet Jelinek et al. (Obesity 18: 1457-1459, 2010, Gene 491:128-134, 2012). When the heterozygotes were studied on a mixed C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ background, increased weight and adiposity were also found on a regular diet (sexes pooled Jelinek et al. [Hum Molec Genet 20:312-321, 2011]). We find somewhat different results when the hypomorphic Npc1 mutation, Npc1 (nmf164), is studied on a pure C57BL/6J, "metabolic syndrome" genetic background with male, but not female, heterozygotes having lower weights on the regular diet. The result does not seem to be due to the difference in the two mutations as heterozygous Npc1 (nmf164) mice on the BALB/cJ background acted like the null mutant heterozygotes. Studies of glucose tolerance, liver enzymes, liver triglycerides and fat deposition, and adipose tissue caveolin 1 levels did not disclose reasons for these differing results.
Alzheimer's Disease affects approximately 33 million people worldwide and is characterized by progressive loss of memory at the cognitive level. The formation of toxic amyloid oligomers, extracellular amyloid plaques and amyloid angiopathy in brain by amyloid beta peptides are considered a part of the identified mechanism involved in disease pathogenesis. The optimal treatment approach leads toward finding a chemical compound able to form a noncovalent complex with the amyloid peptide thus blocking the process of amyloid aggregation. This direction gained an increasing interest lately, many studies demonstrating that mass spectrometry is a valuable method useful for the identification and characterization of such molecules able to interact with amyloid peptides. In the present review we aim to identify in the scientific literature low molecular weight chemical compounds for which there is mass spectrometric evidence of noncovalent complex formation with amyloid peptides and also there are toxicity reduction results which verify the effects of these compounds on amyloid beta toxicity towards cell cultures and transgenic mouse models developing Alzheimer's Disease.
Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPCD) is an autosomal recessive storage disorder, characterized by abnormal sequestration of unesterified cholesterol within the late endo-lysosomal compartment of cells. In the central nervous system, hypoxic insults could result in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation and Lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor-1 (LOX-1) induction, leading to a pathological hippocampal response, namely, ischemic long-term potentiation (i-LTP). These events may correlate with the progressive neural loss observed in NPCD. To test these hypotheses, hippocampal slices from Wild Type (WT) and NPC1-/- mice were prepared, and field potential in the CA1 region was analyzed during transient oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD). Moreover, LOX-1 expression was evaluated by RT-qPCR, immunocytochemical, and Western blot analyses before and after an anoxic episode. Our results demonstrate the development of a precocious i-LTP in NPC1-/- mice during OGD application. We also observed a higher expression of LOX-1 transcript and protein in NPC1-/- mice with respect to WT mice; after anoxic damage to LOX-1 expression, a further increase in both NPC1-/- and WT mice was observed, although the protein expression seems to be delayed, suggesting a different kinetic of induction. These data clearly suggest an elevated susceptibility to neurodegeneration in NPC1-/- mice due to oxidative stress. The observed up-regulation of LOX-1 in the hippocampus of NPC1-/- mice may also open a new scenario in which new biomarkers can be identified.
Synthetic systems are widely used to unveil the molecular mechanisms of complex cellular events. Artificial membranes are key examples of models employed to address lipid-lipid and lipid-protein interactions. In this work, we developed a new synthetic system that more closely resembles the lysosome - the lysosome-mimicking vesicles (LMVs) - displaying stable acid-to-neutral pH gradient across the membrane. To evaluate the advantages of this synthetic system, we assessed the distinct effects of sphingosine (Sph) accumulation in membrane structure and biophysical properties of standard liposomes (no pH gradient) and in LMVs with lipid composition tuned to mimic physiological- or NPC1-like lysosomes. Ternary 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC)/Sphingomyelin (SM)/Cholesterol (Chol) mixtures with, respectively, low and high Chol/SM levels were prepared. The effect of Sph on membrane permeability and biophysical properties was evaluated by fluorescence spectroscopy, electrophoretic and dynamic light scattering. The results showed that overall Sph has the ability to cause a shift in vesicle surface charge, increase membrane order and promote a rapid increase in membrane permeability. These effects are enhanced in NPC1- LMVs. The results suggest that lysosomal accumulation of these lipids, as observed under pathological conditions, might significantly affect lysosomal membrane structure and integrity, and therefore contribute to the impairment of cell function.
Phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate 5-kinase (PIKfyve) is a lipid kinase involved in endosome maturation that emerged from a haploid genetic screen as being required for Ebola virus (EBOV) infection. Here we analyzed the effects of apilimod, a PIKfyve inhibitor that was reported to be well tolerated in humans in phase 2 clinical trials, for its effects on entry and infection of EBOV and Marburg virus (MARV). We first found that apilimod blocks infections by EBOV and MARV in Huh 7, Vero E6 and primary human macrophage cells, with notable potency in the macrophages (IC50, 10 nM). We next observed that similar doses of apilimod block EBOV-glycoprotein-virus like particle (VLP) entry and transcription-replication competent VLP infection, suggesting that the primary mode of action of apilimod is as an entry inhibitor, preventing release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm to initiate replication. After providing evidence that the anti-EBOV action of apilimod is via PIKfyve, we showed that it blocks trafficking of EBOV VLPs to endolysosomes containing Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), the intracellular receptor for EBOV. Concurrently apilimod caused VLPs to accumulate in early endosome antigen 1-positive endosomes. We did not detect any effects of apilimod on bulk endosome acidification, on the activity of cathepsins B and L, or on cholesterol export from endolysosomes. Hence by antagonizing PIKfyve, apilimod appears to block EBOV trafficking to its site of fusion and entry into the cytoplasm. Given the drug's observed anti-filoviral activity, relatively unexplored mechanism of entry inhibition, and reported tolerability in humans, we propose that apilimod be further explored as part of a therapeutic regimen to treat filoviral infections.
Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) lyase irreversibly cleaves S1P, thereby catalysing the ultimate step of sphingolipid degradation. We show here that embryonic fibroblasts from S1P lyase-deficient mice (Sgpl1-/--MEFs), in which S1P and sphingosine accumulate, have features of Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) cells. In the presence of serum, overall cholesterol content was elevated in Sgpl1-/--MEFs, due to upregulation of the LDL receptor and enhanced cholesterol uptake. Despite this, activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 was increased in Sgpl1-/--MEFs, indicating a local lack of cholesterol at the ER. Indeed, free cholesterol was retained in NPC1-containing vesicles, which is a hallmark of NPC. Furthermore, upregulation of amyloid precursor protein in Sgpl1-/--MEFs was mimicked by an NPC1 inhibitor in Sgpl1+/+-MEFs and reduced by overexpression of NPC1. Lysosomal pH was not altered by S1P lyase deficiency, similar to NPC. Interestingly, lysosomal Ca2+ content and bafilomycin A1-induced [Ca2+]i increases were enhanced in Sgpl1-/--MEFs, contrary to NPC. These results show that both a primary defect in cholesterol trafficking and S1P lyase deficiency cause overlapping phenotypic alterations, and challenge the present view on the role of sphingosine in lysosomal Ca2+ homeostasis.
Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease, characterized by intracellular accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and other lipids owing to defects in two proteins NPC1 and NPC2, causes neurodegeneration and other fatal neurovisceral symptoms. Currently, treatment of NPC involves the use of 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD). HP-β-CD is effective in the treatment of hepatosplenomegaly in NPC disease, albeit at a very high dose. One of the methods to reduce the required dose of HP-β-CD for treatment of NPC is to actively targeting hepatocytes with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD). The aim of the present study was to synthesize a novel multi-lactose-appended β-CD (multi-Lac-β-CD) and to evaluate its cholesterol-lowering effect in U18666A-treated HepG2 (NPC-like HepG2) cells. Further, the study aimed at delivering β-CD to hepatocytes via cholesterol-accumulated HepG2 cells, and indicated that the newly synthesized multi-Lac-β-CD had an average degree of substitution of lactose (DSL) of 5.6. This newly synthesized multi-Lac-β-CD was found to significantly decrease the concentration of intracellular cholesterol with negligible cytotoxicity as compared to HP-β-CD. An increased internalization of TRITC-multi-Lac-β-CD (DSL 5.6) as compared to TRITC-HP-β-CD was observed in NPC-like HepG2 cells. Further, the dissociation constant of peanut lectin with multi-Lac-β-CD (DSL5.6) was found to be extremely low (2.5 × 10-8 M). These results indicate that multi-Lac-β-CD (DSL5.6) diminished intracellular cholesterol levels in NPC-like HepG2 cells via asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR)-mediated endocytosis.
Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is an inherited metabolic disorder; due to defect in cellular cholesterol trafficking. It is clinically a heterogeneous disease with variable age of onset with multiple organ systems being involved. NPC1 gene is involved in 95% cases where as remaining ~5% cases are linked with NPC2 gene.
Case-1, a 14-months-old female presented with recurrent respiratory distress, failure to thrive and hepatosplenomegaly. Lung biopsy was suggestive of alveolar proteinosis and liver biopsy confirmed foamy macrophages. Molecular analysis revealed homozygous mutation c.141C &gt; A in exon 2 of NPC2 gene. Case-2, a 3-year-old male presented with dyspnoea and hepatomegaly noticed at 1 year of age. HRCT-scan of thoracic region showed consolidation with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Broncho-alveolar lavage revealed moderate amount of foamy macrophages and bone marrow examination detected foam cells. Homozygous T &gt; C transition in intron 1 of the NPC2 gene was identified.
Our study demonstrates that NPC2 can present in early years of life with pulmonary complications like alveolar proteinosis and hepatosplenomegaly or hepatomegaly due to mutation in NPC2 gene. An early suspicion will help clinicians to clinch its diagnosis, management and genetic counselling.
Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder, which manifests clinically with a wide range of neurological signs and symptoms. We assessed multiple neurological, neuropsychological and neurophysiological biomarkers using a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) multi-paradigm approach in two patients with NPC carrying a homozygous mutation in the NPC1 gene, and in two heterozygous family members.We assessed short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), intracortical facilitation (ICF), long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI), short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) and long-term potentiation (LTP)-like cortical plasticity with a paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocol.Baseline SAI and LTP-like plasticity were impaired in both patients with NPC and in the symptomatic heterozygous NPC1 gene mutation carrier. Only a limited decrease in SICI and ICF was observed, while LICI was within normal range in all subjects at baseline. After 12 months of treatment with miglustat, a considerable improvement in SAI and LTP-like plasticity was observed in both patients with NPC. In conclusion, these biomarkers could help to confirm the diagnosis of NPC, and may give an indication of prognostic outcomes in pharmacological trials.
Northern blot analysis suggested that the boar epididymis produces closely related counterparts to human epididymal proteins HE1, HE3, HE4, HE5 and HE12. 'Full-length' cloning by nucleic acid and amino acid sequence similarity was achieved by RT-PCR methods in the case of the porcine counterparts of HE3 and HE4, while the homologues of HE5 and HE12, despite their cross-hybridization during Northern blot analysis, have not yet been cloned. The two novel porcine cDNAs were derived from moderately abundant epididymal mRNAs that were 75 and 83% identical to HE3 and HE4 cDNAs, respectively. To emphasize their relationship to the corresponding HEs, they were named Se3 and Se4 cDNAs. Their open reading frames predicted small secretory proteins with 55% (Se3) and 76% (Se4) conserved amino acids. Monospecific antipeptide antibodies to HE secretory proteins identified He3- and HE12-related proteins on Western blots of porcine epididymal fluid and semen. Both Northern and Western analyses indicated that the Se proteins were produced in a regionalized pattern and accumulated in the cauda fluid.
Sialic acids as terminal residues of oligosaccharide chains play a crucial role in several cellular recognition events. The presence of sialic acid on promastigotes of Leishmania donovani, the causative organism of Indian visceral leishmaniasis, was demonstrated by fluorimetric high-performance liquid chromatography showing Neu5Ac and, to a minor extent, Neu5,9Ac2. The presence of Neu5Ac was confirmed by GC/MS analysis. Furthermore, binding with sialic acid-binding lectins Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA), Maackia amurensis agglutinin (MAA), and Siglecs showed the presence of both alpha2,3- and alpha2,6-linked sialic acids. No endogenous biosynthetic machinery for Neu5Ac could be demonstrated in the parasite. Concomitant western blotting of parasite membranes and culture medium with SNA demonstrated the presence of common sialoglyconjugates (123, 90, and 70 kDa). Similarly, binding of MAA with parasite membrane and culture medium showed three analogous sialoglycans corresponding to 130, 117, and 70 kDa, indicating that alpha2,3- and alpha2,6-linked sialoglycans are adsorbed from the fetal calf serum present in the culture medium. L. donovani promastigotes also reacted with Achatinin-H, a lectin that preferentially identifies 9-O-acetylated sialic acid in alpha2--&gt;6 GalNAc linkage. This determinant was evidenced on parasite cell surfaces by cell agglutination, ELISA, and flow cytometry, where its binding was abolished by pretreatment of cells with a recombinant 9-O-acetylesterase derived from the HE1 region of the influenza C esterase gene. Additionally, binding of CD60b, a 9-O-acetyl GD3-specific monoclonal antibody, corroborated the presence of terminal 9-O-acetylated disialoglycans. Our results indicate that sialic acids (alpha2--&gt;6 and alpha2--&gt;3 linked) and 9-O-acetyl derivatives constitute components of the parasite cell surface.
Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC) is a neurovisceral (or, extremely rarely, only visceral) lipidosis caused by mutations in the NPC1 gene or, in a few patients, the HE1 gene, which encode sterol regulating proteins. NPC is characterised by a complex lipid anomaly including a disturbed cellular trafficking of cholesterol but also multi-lipid storage in visceral organs and brain. Lipids were studied using conventional methods in enlarged spleens that had been removed from five patients for different therapeutic and diagnostic reasons and found to have microscopic signs of lysosomal storage disease not suspected clinically. The spleen lipid findings with a concurrent accumulation of cholesterol, sphingomyelin and glucosylceramide (Acc-CSG) allowed us to suggest NPC diagnoses for these patients, who were free of neurologic symptoms. From two patients no material for confirmatory studies was available, but in two other patients NPC diagnoses could be confirmed with the filipin cytochemical cholesterol assay and NPC1 gene analysis, respectively. However, these tests and also HE1 gene analysis were negative in a third patient. Since the Acc-CSG lipid pattern seems to indicate a multi-lipid trafficking defect rather than being highly specific for NPC, this patient, if not affected with very atypical NPC, may be a candidate for a different lipid trafficking disorder. The Acc-CSG pattern was considered to be similar to the lipid pattern known for the lipid rafts, these functional cell structures being probably disorganised and accumulated in late endosomes and lysosomes of NPC cells.
Vasectomy has been shown to affect the pattern of mRNA expression of P34H, a human sperm protein added to the acrosomal cap during epididymal transit. It has been reported that vasectomy alters the histology of the reproductive tract in various species as a result of the increased pressure in the epididymis. The aim of this study was to evaluate if other epididymis-specific mRNAs, which are expressed in different patterns along the duct, are altered by vasectomy as well. We analyzed the expression of P31m (a monkey homologue of human P34H) and three different HE-like (HE-l) mRNAs along the epididymis in the cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis). Sexually mature cynomolgus monkeys were vasectomized unilaterally; then the epididymides were surgically removed at different time points. The ipsilateral normal epididymis was used as a control. Histomorphometric measurements showed that the height of the epididymal epithelial cells started to be affected only at 14 wk postsurgery. However, Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis showed that the expression pattern of P31m, HE1, and HE5-like mRNA along the epididymis was not affected by vasectomy. Only the HE2-like mRNA predominantly expressed in the normal corpus epididymidis was significantly lowered 14 wk after vasectomy. Thus, ductal obstruction differentially alters mRNA expression along the epididymis of the cynomolgus monkey.
Human prolactin receptor (hPRLR) expression is regulated by estradiol-17beta (E(2)) in vivo in animal tissues, and in vitro in normal human endometrial cells and in MCF7 human breast cancer cells. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of E(2) on the expression of two recently described hPRLR isoforms with distinct exons-1, hE1(3) and hE1(N1) that are transcribed from the generic hPIII promoter, also present in the rat and mouse, and the human-specific promoter hP(N1), respectively. Also, to determine the effect of estradiol on the hPIII promoter activity in cancer cells. T47D breast cancer cells were examined using quantitative competitive RT-PCR for the level of expression of two alternative non-coding exon-1 transcripts, hE1(3) and hE1(N1) following incubation with E(2) in presence or absence of the E(2) receptor antagonist ICI 182,780. The effects of estradiol were also evaluated in cells transiently transfected with constructs of hPIII promoter luciferase reporter gene. E(2) significantly increased the expression of both hPRLR mRNA transcripts, hE1(3) and hE1(N1). In transfection studies E(2) activated the hPIII promoter. This effect of estradiol was markedly inhibited by coincubation with the E(2) receptor antagonist. Our results demonstrate a stimulatory effect of estradiol on the expression of hPRLR mRNA species with alternative exons-1, hE1(3) and hE1(N1) possibly through activation of their corresponding promoters. The lack of a formal ERE in these promoters suggested that the effect of estradiol is mediated through association of the activated ER with relevant DNA binding transfactor(s). These findings support the role of E(2) in the regulation of hPRLR expression in human breast cancer cell lines.
This is the first description of slowly progressive Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) without the typical lysosomal storage in bone marrow and viscera in two descendants of a group of 17th century French-Canadians. The index patient was a married 43-year-old woman with onset of dementia in her thirties, later followed by the development of ataxia and athetoid movements. Her autopsy disclosed frontal lobe atrophy, neurolysosomal storage with oligolamellar inclusion and tau-positive neurofibrillary tangles. Of the 119 family members screened, only a married 42-year-old sister displayed symptoms of a dementia. Both women displayed vertical supranuclear ophthalmoplegia; expressive aphasia; concrete, stimulus-bound, perseverative behavior; and impaired conceptualization and planning. Cultured fibroblasts showed decreased cholesterol esterification and positive filipin staining, but no mutation was detected in coding or promoter regions of the NPC1 gene using conformation sensitive gel electrophoresis and sequencing. Sequencing showed a homozygous gene mutation that is predicted to result in an amino acid substitution, V39M, in the cholesterol binding protein HE1 (NPC2). Adult-onset NPC2 with lysosomal storage virtually restricted to neurons represents a novel phenotypic and genotypic variant with diffuse cognitive impairment and focal frontal involvement described for the first time.
Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is an inherited neuro-degenerative disorder associated with intracellular cholesterol trafficking defects. Mutations in two distinct genes, NPC1 and HE1, have recently been shown to cause this disease. We have analysed the NPC1 gene in five German patients with NPC from four unrelated families. We identified a total of five novel mutations in the coding region of the NPC1 gene (G231V, D874V, 1642M, 11094T and R116stop). All affected individuals displayed compound heterozygosity. The mutated alleles were transmitted by the nonaffected parents with the exception of one patient, in whom a de novo mutation (G231V) had occurred. Interestingly, the G231V/P237S NPC1 genotype in this individual is associated with an early-onset form of NPC. In contrast, we found that the D874V/D948N genotype, observed in another NPC patient, is characterized by a late onset of clinical symptoms that presents with a pronounced white-matter disease. Our results will contribute to defining the association between the clinical phenotypes and the genetic abnormalities in Niemann-Pick C disease.
Cholesterol is an important structural component of membranes as well as a precursor for steroid hormone, bile acid and regulatory oxysterol biosynthesis. Recent observations revealed that cholesterol plays an important role in signaling and the regulation of intracellular vesicular trafficking. Studies on Niemann-Pick type C disease, a fatal neuro-visceral cholesterol storage disorder, led to the elucidation of a sterol-modulated vesicular trafficking pathway. Mutations in the NPC1 gene, which cause the majority of cases of Niemann-Pick type C disease, result in the accumulation of free cholesterol in lysosomes and associated defects in glycolipid sorting. NPC1 has a sterol-sensing domain that presumably recognizes free sterols in the protein's environment and participates in the movement of cholesterol out of lysosomes. The compartment containing NPC1 is a subset of late endosomes; it is highly mobile, travels along microtubules, emitting flexible tubules. The movements of this compartment require an intact NPC1 sterol-sensing domain and are dramatically suppressed when free cholesterol accumulates in the late endosomes. Two other proteins involved in sterol trafficking enter into the NPC1 compartment, NPC2 also known as HE1, a secreted sterol-binding glycoprotein, and MLN64, a StAR-related lipid transfer (START) domain protein, which can bind cholesterol and promote its movement from donor to acceptor membranes. Mutations in NPC2 cause a rarer form of Niemann-Pick type C disease, establishing its importance in intracellular sterol movement. NPC2, NPC1 and MLN64 may act in an ordered sequence to sense cholesterol, effect sterol movement, and consequently, influence the process of vesicular trafficking.
Prenatal diagnosis of Niemann-Pick disease types A and B is routinely accomplished by sphingomyelinase assay. For Niemann-Pick type C disease, demonstration of an abnormal intracellular cholesterol trafficking is a complex procedure, and mutational analysis (NPC1 or NPC2/HE1 gene), whenever feasible, represents a major advance.
Like human adenovirus type 5 (HAV5), bovine adenovirus type 3 (BAV3) early region 1 (E1) consists of E1A and E1B transcriptional units. In order to characterize BAV3 E1 proteins and to isolate a cell line of bovine origin that expresses BAV3 E1, polyclonal antibodies specific to E1A, E1B-157R, and E1B-420R were raised in rabbits. BAV3 E1A, E1B-157R, and E1B-420R were identified as 40, 17, and 47 kDa proteins, and had a half-life of 45-60 min, and 4-6 and 4-6 h, respectively. It appeared that E1A and E1B-157R were phosphorylated at the serine/threonine residues, whereas, E1B 420R was phosphorylated at both the serine/threonine and tyrosine residues. Three cell lines, MDBK-221 (Madin Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) transfected with BAV3 E1), FBK-34 (primary fetal bovine kidney (FBK) cells transfected BAV3 E1), and FBRT-HE1 (bovine fetal retinal (FBRT) cells transfected with HAV5 E1) were isolated and characterized for E1 expression. FBK-34 or FBRT-HE1 supported the replication of an E1A-deleted BAV3 (BAV3DeltaE1AE3) to approximately 1-2 x 10(8) PFU/ml, whereas, the virus titers in MDBK-221 were approximately 10(7) PFU/ml. These cell lines will be useful in generating and growing BAV3 E1-deleted recombinants, and also for studying E1 protein interactions with a number of cellular and/or viral proteins.
Transcription of the prolactin receptor (PRLR) is under the control of multiple promoters. Following the recent demonstration of the human non-coding exon 1, hE1(N) (hE1(N1)) and the generic exon 1 hE1(3), we have identified their promoters and characterized four other novel human exons 1 (hE1(N2-5)) that are alternatively spliced to a common non-coding exon 2 in human tissues and breast cancer cells. Genomic regions containing these exons, and 5'-flanking and intronic sequences, were determined and their order was established in chromosome 5p14-13. Promoters utilized in the transcription of previously characterized PRLR exons 1 species hE1(3) (hPII) and hE1(N1) (hP(N1)) were found to employ distinct mechanisms for controlling hPRLR transcription. hPIII requires C/EBP beta and Sp1/Sp3 for basal transcriptional activity, while hP(N1) activity is conferred by domains containing an Ets element and an NR half-site. The complex promoter control system that governs transcription of the hPRLR in multiple tissues is of relevance for studies on the regulation of PRLR expression in physiological and pathological states.
A kinematically complete experiment for simultaneous ionization of a projectile and target has been performed for 3.6 MeV/u C2+ on He collisions measuring the final vector momenta of the He1+ recoil ion and of two electrons (projectile, target) in coincidence with the emerging C3+ projectile. The feasibility of an event-by-event separation of the various reaction channels, among them the ionization of C2+ by the interaction with a quasifree target electron, is demonstrated in agreement with six-body classical trajectory Monte Carlo calculations, paving the way to kinematically complete electron-ion scattering experiments.
Primary cultures of the differentiated, adult epididymal duct epithelium were immortalized by retroviral transduction with the simian virus (SV)40 large T antigen. The canine epididymis was chosen here as a model with high human relevance, representing a convenient and acceptable source of differentiated epididymal tissue and, compared to other animal models, expressing a relatively large number of gene products which are also expressed by the human epididymis. To determine whether the immortalized canine epididymal (IMCE) cells retained a phenotype comparable to the original tissue, epithelial cytokeratins, various epididymal transcription factors as well as mRNAs encoding abundant epididymal secretory proteins, were studied as molecular markers. All IMCE populations obtained after transduction were of epithelial origin. The nuclear androgen receptor (AR) and the polyoma enhancer activator (PEA3), as well as the epididymal mRNA encoding the canine counterparts of human HE1, HE4 and HE5/CD52 epididymal mRNA, were retained in all populations tested. The majority of tested clones were oestrogen receptor ERalpha-positive, but ERbeta-negative, while one ERalpha-negative cell population was positive for ERbeta. The IMCE populations described thus represent useful permanent tools for studying gene expression of the epididymal duct epithelium, and for other types of experiments, examples including drug effects and toxicity on the epididymis.
In Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC), a genetic heterogeneity with two complementation groups--NPC1, comprising &gt; or =95% of the families, and NPC2--has been demonstrated. Mutations in the NPC1 gene have now been well characterized. HE1 was recently identified as the gene underlying the very rare NPC2. Here we report the first comprehensive study of eight unrelated families with NPC2, originating from France, Algeria, Italy, Germany, the Czech Republic, and Turkey. These cases represent essentially all patients with NPC2 who have been reported in the literature, as well as those known to us. All 16 mutant alleles were identified, but only five different mutations, all with a severe impact on the protein, were found; these five mutations were as follows: two nonsense mutations (E20X and E118X), a 1-bp deletion (27delG), a splice mutation (IVS2+5G--&gt;A), and a missense mutation (S67P) resulting in reduced amounts of abnormal HE1 protein. E20X, with an overall allele frequency of 56%, was established as the common mutant allele. Prenatal diagnosis was achieved by mutation analysis of an uncultured chorionic-villus sample. All mutations except 27delG were observed in a homozygous state, allowing genotype/phenotype correlations. In seven families (with E20X, E118X, S67P, and E20X/27delG mutations), patients suffered a severe and rapid disease course, with age at death being 6 mo-4 years. A remarkable feature was the pronounced lung involvement, leading, in six patients, to early death caused by respiratory failure. Two patients also developed a severe neurological disease with onset during infancy. Conversely, the splice mutation corresponded to a very different clinical presentation, with juvenile onset of neurological symptoms and prolonged survival. This mutation generated multiple transcripts, including a minute proportion of normally spliced RNA, which may explain the milder phenotype.
HER2 / neu is a potential antigen candidate for immunotherapy because of its correlation to a poor prognosis and high expressions in many kinds of epithelial tumours. Especially in the colorectal carcinomas, the higher expression of HER2 / neu is recognized in metastatic regions as well as in primary sites. Several CTL epitopes restricted by HLA-A2.1 and -A3 were identified so far, however epitopes restricted by HLA-A24, that is one of the most common allele in Japanese and Caucasians, have not been identified. In this paper, we showed identification of a CTL epitope peptide of HER2 / neu restricted by HLA-A24. HLA-A24 binding peptides selected by an analysis based on HLA-A24 binding motifs were determined for their binding affinities to HLA-A24 molecules. The peptide with a sequence of RWGLLLALL (position 8-16) named HE1 showed the highest affinity. We induced CTLs from CD8(+)cells of HLA-A24 healthy donors by stimulation with HE1-pulsed autologous dendritic cells. The CTLs showed cytotoxic activity against not only the peptide-pulsed target cells but also HLA-A24 colorectal tumour cell lines that endogenously overexpressed HER2 / neu. The antigen-specificity was confirmed by cold target inhibition assay using HE1-pulsed target cells. In summary, HER2 / neu peptide, RWGLLLALL, may contribute to the induction of antitumour immunity with the peptide-based immunotherapy for the colorectal carcinomas.
We have measured the momentum distributions of singly and doubly charged helium ions created in the focus of 220 fs, 800 nm laser pulses at intensities of (2.9-6.6)x10(14) W/cm(2). All ions are emitted strongly aligned along the direction of polarization of the light. We find the typical momenta of the He2+ ions to be 5-10 times larger than those of the He1+ ions and a two peak structure at the highest intensity.
The mouse cDNA and its genomic clones encoding the epididymal secretory glycoprotein ME1 were identified. The Me1 gene spans 15kb with four exons and three introns. The deduced amino-acid sequence of the ME1 cDNA revealed that it consists of 149 amino acid residues, which contain a signal peptide characteristic of secretory proteins, six cysteine residues and a proline-rich region conserved in the orthologous proteins. Northern blot analysis revealed that 1.3kb ME1 mRNA is highly expressed in the mouse epididymis. The polyclonal antibodies generated against human HE1 (ME1 orthologous protein) expressed in bacteria reacted with approximately 17 to 25kDa components in mouse epididymis crude extract. The reduction of the molecular mass of the recombinant ME1 protein with the digestion of glycopeptidase A indicated that it is modified by Asn-linked glycosylation.
Proteins present in and secreted into the lumen of various regions of the stallion epididymis were characterized qualitatively and quantitatively by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Using this proteomic approach, 201 proteins were found in the lumen and 117 were found that were secreted by the epithelium in various parts of the organ. Eighteen proteins made up 92.6% of the total epididymal secretory activity, lactoferrin (41.2%) and clusterin (24.8%) being the most abundant. Procathepsin D, HE1/CTP (cholesterol transfer protein), GPX (glutathione peroxidase), beta-N-acetyl-hexosaminidase, and PGDS (prostaglandin D2 synthase) were the other major compounds secreted. The most abundant proteins found in the luminal fluid were albumin and the secreted proteins: lactoferrin, PGDS, GPX, HE1/CTP, and hexosaminidase. Three main secretory epididymal regions were identified from the protein pattern, i.e., regions E0-E2, E3-E5, and E6-E9. Region E0-E2 was characterized by the secretion of clusterin (53%), PGDS (44%), and GPX (6%). Region E3-E5 had the highest number of secreted proteins, the highest protein concentrations (60-80 mg/ml), and the highest spermatocrit value (85%). Lactoferrin (60% in E4), clusterin (29% in E3), hexosaminidase (10% in E3), and procathepsin D (6.9% in E4) were the most abundant proteins in this region. Region E6-E9, in which few region-specific secreted compounds were found, was characterized by a high quantity of lactoferrin in the luminal fluid (2-14 mg/ml). Comparison between the secretion of the major proteins and their concentrations in the lumen throughout the organ showed that the behavior of each protein is specific, in particular for the three isoforms of clusterin.
The density of Helicobacter pylori is thought to correlate with the degree of inflammation and thus indirectly with the outcome of the infection. Rapid quantitative assays of H. pylori in gastric or duodenal mucosa are lacking. The aim was to develop quantitative assays using the polymerase chain reaction to assess the quantity of H. pylori in the gastric mucosa.
Competitive PCR was based on coamplification of a segment of the ureC sequence and an internal control using a single set of primers. PCR products were quantified colorimetrically by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and compared with known quantities of the internal control standard added to the PCR reaction. The highly sensitive, noncompetitive PCR assay does not use coamplification and measures the amplified DNA sequence using a flash-type luminescent tag and a specific probe. The mouse infected model using H. pylori strain SS-1 was used to develop the assays.
Quantification of H. pylori using either the competitive or noncompetitive PCR was reliable, highly sensitive and specific.
The ability to rapidly quantitate H. pylori from gastric mucosa should be useful to investigate the role of H. pylori density and infection outcome, as well as to monitor the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment or vaccines against H. pylori.
The number of proteins secreted by the boar epididymis increased progressively from 1 mo of age to the adult period. The first specific secretory activity was revealed at 2 mo in the distal caput (hexosaminidase, clusterin, and lactoferrin) and in the corpus (train O/HE1). Train A and glutathione peroxidase specific to the proximal caput, and trains E and M specific to the corpus, appeared at 4 mo. At 5 mo, secretion of procathepsin L occurred in the middle caput and that of mannosidase and E-RABP in the distal caput. Approximately 48% of all the proteins secreted in the adult boar epididymis were dependent on the presence of androgens, either stimulated (33.6%) or repressed (14.4%); 47% were modulated by other factors, and 5% were unregulated. In the proximal caput, 50% of the specific secreted proteins were controlled essentially by factors emanating from the testis. In more distal regions, two proteins secreted in the corpus were regulated by factors from the anterior regions. The regionalization of the secretory activity of the epididymal epithelium resulted in a specific regulation for each protein, which was modulated according to the region of expression and influenced by either testicular or epididymal factors that remain to be identified.
Some previously unidentified short interspersed repetitive elements (SINEs) and long interspersed repetitive element (LINEs) were isolated from various higher elasmobranchs (sharks, skates, and rays) and characterized. These SINEs, members of the HE1 SINE family, were tRNA-derived and were widespread in higher elasmobranches. The 3'-tail region of this SINE family was strongly conserved among elasmobranchs. The LINEs, members of the HER1 LINE family, encoded an amino acid sequence similar to that encoded by the chicken CR1 LINE family, and they contained a strongly conserved 3'-tail region in the 3' untranslated region. This tail region of the HER1 LINE family was almost identical to that of the HE1 SINE family. Thus, the HE1 SINE family and the HER1 LINE family provide a clear example of a pair of SINEs and LINEs that share the same tail region. Conservation of the secondary structures of the tail regions, as well as of the nucleotide sequences, between the HE1 SINE family and HER1 LINE family during evolution suggests that SINEs utilize the enzymatic machinery for retroposition of LINEs through the recognition of higher-order structures of the conserved 3'-tail region. A discussion is presented of the parasitism of SINEs on LINEs during the evolution of these retroposons.
A porcine homolog of the major secretory protein of human epididymis, HE1, was for the first time purified from the porcine cauda epididymal fluid. The HE1 homolog was secreted into the epididymal fluid as a 19-kDa glycoprotein, whose sugar moiety was gradually processed to form a 16-kDa protein during transit through the epididymis. The HE1 homolog mRNA was detected only in the caput and corpus epididymis among the porcine tissues examined. The purified HE1 homolog specifically bound cholesterol with high affinity (Kd=2. 3 microM). The binding stoichiometry was determined to be 0.94 mol/mol, suggesting that 1 mol of cholesterol binds to 1 mol of the protein. It was also found that the HE1 homolog is a major cholesterol-binding protein in the porcine epididymal fluid. The possibility that the HE1 homolog is involved in the regulation of the lipid composition of the sperm membranes during the maturation in epididymis is discussed.
The 5'-untranslated region of the human prolactin receptor (hPRLR) gene contains two alternative first exons, hE1(3), the human counterpart of the rat and mouse E1(3) and a novel human type of alternative first exon termed hE1N, also a common non-coding exon 2 and a third exon containing the translation initiation codon. hE1(3) was localized approximately 800 bp 5' from the hE1N in the genome. The two distinct first exons hE1(3) and hE1N are expressed in human breast tissue, breast cancer cells, gonads and liver. Overall, the transcript containing hE1(3) is prevalent in most tissues. The coding region of the gene comprises eight exons (exon 3-10), in which exon 10 encodes most of the intracellular domain. hE1(3) and hE1N are transcribed from alternative promoters hPIII and hP(N), respectively. The hPIII, containing identical Sp1 and C/EBP elements as in the rodent promoters, shares 81% similarity in the region -480/-106 to both the rat and mouse. The novel promoter hP(N) contains putative binding sites for ETS-family proteins and a half-site for nuclear receptors. Therefore, both promoters likely utilize distinct mechanisms in controlling the hPRLR gene transcription. The different promoter utilization of the hPRLR gene in diverse tissues may confer differential prolactin response through activation of different promoters.
Human post-testicular proteins were cloned by subtractive screening of epididymal cDNA libraries, employing testis as the primary negative control. This method identified six human epididymal cDNAs, named HE1-HE6, which are derived from abundant epididymal mRNAs. With the exception of HE5, which turned out to be identical to the lymphocyte surface antigen CD52, they represented completely novel human gene products. To date, there is little information on their function and the mechanism of their deposition on the sperm surface. Unlike the sperm coating antigens, CD52 binds firmly to the sperm membrane via its GPI anchor during epididymal passage. Its synthesis is carefully regulated by the epididymal epithelium. From the results of both in vivo and in vitro studies it was concluded that androgen and temperature are principal factors synergistically modulating epididymal CD52 expression. The human counterparts of two well-known major rodent epididymal proteins, secretory epididymal glutathione peroxidase (sGPX) and acidic epididymal glycoprotein (AEG = Protein DE), were not cloned by the subtractive screening approach, but by RT-PCR amplification.
The authors have developed monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to characterize the sequential biochemical changes in corneal epithelial cells after they differentiate from stem cells, located in the limbus, and migrate centripetally to follow the pathway of terminal differentiation. The purpose of this study was to identify a protein (recognized by mAb HE1/11F) with increased expression associated with the transition of the limbal epithelium to corneal epithelium.
The distribution and identification of the protein(s) were performed using an indirect immunohistochemical staining technique and a western blot analysis, respectively. A rabbit corneal epithelial cDNA library, constructed in the Uni-Zap XR vector, was screened with mAb HE1/11F to select cDNA clones expressing polypeptide(s) recognized by this mAb. Additional overlapping cDNA clones were obtained from a primer extension cDNA library to determine the sequence of the complete open reading frame encoding the protein recognized by mAb HE1/11F.
Rabbit corneal epithelium exhibited strong immunostaining with mAb HE1/11F, however, the limbal epithelial cells stained weakly. HE1/11F recognized 160-kDa (HEBM1) and 100-kDa (HEBM2) polypeptides in the corneal epithelial extracts. The amino acid sequence of the protein deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA exhibited a close homology to that of a RhoA (Ras-related small GTPase)-associated serine-threonine kinase (ROCK-I or Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase). A 160-kDa RhoA-binding polypeptide with a molecular mass similar to that of HEBM1 and ROCK-I was detected in the corneal epithelial extracts. These findings strongly suggested that HEBM1 was rabbit ROCK-I. The identity of HEBM1 was further confirmed from the reactivity of mAb HE1/11F with ROCK-I immunoprecipitated from rabbit corneal epithelial extracts using anti-ROCK-I antibodies.
The increased expression of a protein identified as ROCK-I from cDNA analyses is associated with rabbit corneal epithelial differentiation and transition from the limbal to corneal surface. Therefore, a RhoA signaling pathway is likely to be associated with corneal epithelial differentiation (maturation). A close homology among the cDNA sequences of rabbit, mouse, rat, and human ROCK-I indicates that this RhoA-associated kinase is a well-conserved protein.
A 20-kDa glycoprotein, EPV20, was isolated from bovine milk and characterized. The primary structure was determined by cDNA and protein sequencing combined with mass spectrometry. EPV20 is a 130-residue polypeptide synthesized with a 19-residue signal peptide. The function of EPV20 is unknown, but it displays 79% sequence similarity to a putative protein deduced from a human testis cDNA sequence designated HE1 (human epididymis clone 1) (Kirchhoff, C., 1992. EMBL/GeneBank/DDBJ Databases, accession number X67698). Northern blot analysis showed the bovine EPV20 to be expressed in kidney, spleen, liver and mammary gland, but remarkably not in bovine testis. The six Cys residues of EPV20 were found to be disulfide-linked in a 1-6, 2-3 and 4 5 pattern. This disulfide arrangement has been observed in other proteins, e.g. in human prostatic acid phosphatase, but the spacing between the cystines differs. Therefore, EPV20 represents a new structure among the large group of proteins containing domains with three disulfide bonds.
A 27-kDa glycoprotein comprises approximately 20% of the total protein in chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) cauda epididymal fluid. Polyclonal antibodies generated against this glycoprotein react with 27- and 25-kDa components in chimpanzee cauda epididymal fluid and in human, gorilla, chimpanzee, and monkey seminal fluid. According to microsequencing, the 27- and 25-kDa components (chimpanzee EPI-1) are identical to the cloned putative human epididymal protein HE1. Screening of a chimpanzee epididymal cDNA library enabled isolation of a cDNA clone of chimpanzee EPI-1. On the cDNA level, chimpanzee EPI-1 and human HE1 are 99% identical. Northern analysis localized chimpanzee EPI-1 mRNA to the distal caput epididymidis. With EPI-1 primers, polymerase chain reaction of reverse-transcribed rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) epididymal RNA enabled isolation of a rhesus monkey EPI-1 cDNA clone. The derived amino acid sequence of rhesus monkey EPI-1 is identical to chimpanzee EPI-1 and to human HE1. Northern analysis localized rhesus monkey EPI-1 mRNA to the distal caput and the proximal corpus epididymidis. Northern analysis also showed that chimpanzee EPI-1 and rhesus monkey EPI-1 gene products are expressed specifically in the epididymis and not in any other tissue examined.
The cDNA sequence of HE1, a novel human epididymal gene product isolated by differential screening, predicts an abundant, small secretory glycopeptide. HE1 is encoded by a single copy gene and seems to be well conserved among mammals. The predicted HE1 peptide is identical to that of EPI-1, the chimpanzee homologous gene product, and to ESP14.6, the macaque homologous product. Its tentative N-terminus also shows similarity to that of a major porcine epididymal sperm-associated glycopeptide. Northern blot analysis of various bovine and rat tissues indicated that their HE1-homologous gene products showed highly increased expression in the epididymis, suggesting that the tissue distribution observed in humans is also conserved. With use of antipeptide antibodies, HE1-related antigen was shown by immunohistochemical methods to be present within the epithelium and lumen of the human corpus epididymidis. High amounts were also present in the lumen of the cauda epididymidis and deferent duct. Moreover, HE1 seemed to be associated with epididymal spermatozoa, and association with ejaculated spermatozoa remained doubtful. With Western blotting, an antiserum raised against the synthetic HE1 epitope specifically cross-reacted with proteins of human seminal plasma in the range of 25-27 kDa. An antiserum raised against chimpanzee EPI-1 recognized human seminal plasma antigens of the same apparent molecular size.
Events related to both ecdysis and metamorphosis require the expression of a new set of genes, the majority of which are regulated by the changes in ecdysteroid levels. We have initiated studies to identify genes whose expression is up-regulated between 24 and 4 h before pupal ecdysis in Manduca sexta. In this paper we report the partial characterization of one such gene, esr16. The transcript of esr16 is detected by Northern blot analysis in nervous tissue, muscle and trachea isolated from animals 4 h before, but not 24 h before pupal ecdysis. In situ hybridization showed that the transcript was expressed in epithelial cells of the large tracheae surrounding the nervous system and muscle. Sequence analysis suggested that the gene encoded a secreted protein with 35% identity to HE1, a human epididymal-specific gene.
Capsaicin (trans-8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide) is a major pungent and irritating ingredient of hot chilli peppers, which are frequently consumed as spices. This dietary phytochemical has been found to interact with microsomal xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes in rodents. Capsaicin and its saturated analog dihydrocapsaicin (trans-8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonanamide) have been proposed to inactivate cytochrome P-450 HE1 by irreversibly binding to the active sites of the enzyme. Besides cytochrome P-450 HE1, other isoforms of the P-450 superfamily were also reported to be inhibited by capsaicin. The inhibition by capsaicin of microsomal monooxygenases involved in carcinogen activation implies its chemopreventive potential. As part of a program to investigate chemoprotective properties of capsaicin we initially determined the effect of capsaicin on vinyl carbamate (VC)- and N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA)-induced mutagenesis in Salmonella typhimurium TA100. Capsaicin (0.42 mM) attenuated the bacterial mutagenicity of VC and NDMA by 50% and 42% respectively. Diallyl sulfide, a thioether found in garlic with selective P-450 HE1 inhibitory activity, also lessened the mutagenicity of the above carcinogens in a concentration-dependent manner. The suppression of VC- and NDMA-induced mutagenesis by capsaicin and diallyl sulfide correlated with their inhibition of P-450 IIE1-mediated p-nitrophenol hydroxylation and NDMA N-demethylation. Pretreatment of female ICR mice with a topical dose of capsaicin lowered the average number of VC-induced skin tumors by 62% at 22 weeks after promotion. A similar degree of protection was attained with oral administration of diallyl sulfide before carcinogen treatment. The results of this study suggest that capsaicin and diallyl sulfide suppress VC- and NDMA-induced mutagenesis or tumorigenesis in part through inhibition of the cytochrome P-450 IIE1 isoform responsible for activation of these carcinogens.
Multiplication of influenza C virus in MDCK cell cultures increased with increasing concentrations of trypsin up to 160 micrograms/ml, whereas maximum growth of influenza A virus in the same culture was observed at a concentration of 10 micrograms/ml. In the presence of 160 micrograms of trypsin per ml MDCK cells showed the same or even higher susceptibility to various strains of influenza C virus compared with HMV-II cells, a human melanoma cell line that has been reported to have high susceptibility to the virus. Complete cleavage of the HE precursor protein of MDCK-grown influenza C virus into HE1 and HE2 subunits was achieved by trypsin at a concentration of 160 micrograms/ml, whereas only partial cleavage was observed at 10 micrograms/ml. The present results thus demonstrate that MDCK cell cultures supplemented with trypsin at a concentration of 160 micrograms/ml become highly susceptible to influenza C virus.
In-situ transcript hybridization was used to characterize the regional distribution of three marker gene transcripts which are expressed abundantly in the canine epididymis. The gene products CE1, CE4 and CE5, which are the canine equivalents of the human homologues HE1, HE4 and HE5, are shown to be expressed in a tissue-specific and regionally characteristic pattern in the epididymal epithelium. CE1 mRNA was expressed very weakly in the efferent ducts but was expressed at a high level throughout the caput and corpus regions of the epididymis, decreasing somewhat in the distal cauda region. CE4 mRNA was not detectable in the efferent ducts and was only expressed moderately in the remainder of the epididymis, with greatest levels in the caput and proximal cauda regions, and decreasing in the distal cauda. CE5 mRNA showed the most marked regional variation in levels with little or no mRNA detectable in the caput and proximal corpus regions, but increasing dramatically in the distal corpus and cauda. In the transition region of the central corpus, the CE5 mRNA appeared to be expressed intermittently, giving a mottled signal appearance over the epididymal epithelium. The patterns of mRNA distribution for the three marker genes in the dog epididymis were, therefore, essentially similar to those for the equivalent human homologues, providing further support for the suitability of the dog epididymis as a model for the human.
The physiology of the epididymis is an integral part of the maturation process by which human spermatozoa acquire the ability to reach and fertilize an oocyte. Because of the high degree of species specificity exhibited by the epididymal proteins involved in sperm maturation, we have assessed tissue from several alternative species for their suitability as a model for human epididymal physiology. Of these, the dog appears to offer an appropriate system. Northern hybridization using cDNA probes specific for human epididymal genes established that, irrespective of dog breed, the canine equivalents of the epididymis-specific HE1, HE4 and HE5 mRNAs were expressed highly in the canine epididymis. cDNA cloning and sequencing confirmed that the canine gene products, CE1, CE4 and CE5 were indeed true structural homologues of their human counterparts. Finally, tissue culture conditions were established wherein all three specific canine genes remained up-regulated after 5 days of culture. Thus, the prerequisite criteria for the development of a system which models human epididymal physiology are to a large degree fulfilled by this canine culture system.
Small cell lung carcinoma-associated paraneoplastic encephalomyeloneuronopathy involves the nervous system at various levels resulting in cerebellar degeneration, limbic encephalitis, myelopathy, sensory neuronopathy or brainstem encephalitis. Anti-neuronal nuclear antibody, which has been termed ANNA-1/anti-Hu/Type II a antibody, is observed in the serum or cerebrospinal fluid of the patients and is highly specific for the disorder. This antibody reacts with the nucleoproteins of most neurons in the nervous system and recognizes a group of nucleoproteins in neurons with a molecular weight of 34-42 kd, suggesting that the pathogenesis of this disorder may be autoimmune. Several cDNA clones encoding the antigens have been cloned; that is, HuD, PLE21/HuC and He1-N1. These antigens contain three highly similar RRMs as well as Drosophila ELAV and RBP9 proteins do. Several autoantigens 70K, A, B", and Ro contain RRM, and Ro antigen shares B cell epitopes with these antigens. Thus, RRMs may represent or encompass an autoimmune crossreactive determinant.
The pH-Vmax/KmGSH plot of glutathione S-transferase P (GST-P) showed a bell-shaped profile, indicating bifunctional catalysis for glutathione (GSH) conjugation. The ionization constant (Ke) and the heat of ionization (delta He) of the essential ionizable group in the GSH binding site were measured and the value of pKe1 was 5.9 and that of pKe2, 8.4, while the delta He1 and delta He2 were -0.2 and 7.9 kcal/mole, respectively. In a solvent containing 25% ethanol, pKe1 and pKe2 shifted to the alkaline side by 0.47 and 0.2, respectively. These kinetic results indicated that carboxyl and phenolic groups were ionizable groups essential for the GSH conjugation. Chemical modifications using aminomethane sulfonic acid and N-acetylimidazole supported the results of the kinetic studies.
Three tissue-specific gene probes that had been isolated by differential screening from a human epididymal cDNA library--HE1, HE2, and HE5--were employed to investigate regional specializations in the human epididymis. All 3 cDNAs were derived from major transcripts of the epithelial cells lining the epididymal duct. Each mRNA species, however, exhibited a discrete longitudinal pattern of hybridization with maxima in different regions of this organ, suggesting regional specializations of gene expression. The HE5 mRNA, which was recently shown to encode the peptide backbone of the human leukocyte differentiation antigen CDw52, showed maximum levels in the distal corpus epididymidis and in the vas deferens, whereas the HE2 mRNA was found predominantly in the caput and proximal corpus sections of the epididymis. HE1 mRNA was found in high amounts in all parts of the epididymis, displaying a 2-peak expression pattern with maxima in the distal caput and distal corpus of the epididymal duct.
Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has been used to detect two water molecules bound to residues in the active site of the Lactobacillus casei dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Their presence was detected by measuring nuclear Overhauser effects between NH protons in protein residues and protons in the individual bound water molecules in two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY), in nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy in the rotating frame (ROESY) and three-dimensional 1H-15N ROESY-heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence spectra recorded on samples containing appropriately 15N-labelled DHFR. For the DHFR-methotrexate-NADPH complex, two bound molecules were found, one close to the Trp5 amide NH proton and the other near to the Trp21 indole HE1 proton: these correspond to two of the water molecules (Wat201 and Wat253) detected in the crystal structure studies described by Bolin and co-workers. However, the nuclear magnetic resonance experiments did not detect any of the other bound water molecules observed in the X-ray studies. The nuclear magnetic resonance results indicate that the two bound water molecules that were detected have lifetimes in the solution state that are longer than approximately two nanoseconds. This is of considerable interest, since one of these water molecules (Wat253) has been implicated as the likely proton donor in the catalytic reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate.
Neutralization-resistant variants of influenza C/Ann Arbor/1/50 virus were selected with monoclonal antibodies against four different antigenic sites on the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) glycoprotein, and their HE genes were sequenced to identify amino acid residues important for the integrity of each site. Twelve different amino acid substitutions in a total of 18 antigenic variants were all located on the HE1 subunit. Although variants for antigenic site A-2 had a change at position 367, all substitutions in the variants for sites A-1, A-3, and A-4 occurred in the central region of the HE1 spanning amino acid positions 178 to 283. Furthermore, it was found that many of the substitutions in the variants selected with antibodies to sites A-1 and A-3 were clustered within or near one of the three variable regions revealed previously by comparing amino acid sequences of the HEs among various influenza C isolates (Buonagurio, D. A., Nakada, S., Fitch, W. M., and Palese, P., Virology 146, 221-232, 1985). The antigenic variants were also examined for their ability to agglutinate chicken and human erythrocytes in order to obtain information concerning the receptor-binding site on the HE molecule. The results suggested that the amino acid changes at residues 178, 186, 187, 190, 206, 212, and 226 decreased the hemagglutinating activity whereas those at residues 245, 266, and 283 produced an opposite effect.
An insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II)-producing histiocytoma was detected in a patient presenting with the classical findings of tumor-related hypoglycemia (low serum insulin and IGF-I concentrations, glucose intolerance, and only modestly increased serum IGF-II levels). Acid-gel filtration of serum extracts showed a single peak of IGF-II immunoreactivity that emerged at the same site as the 125I-labeled human IGF-II standard. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of the tumor IGF-II demonstrated that it had an identical retention time to that of recombinant human IGF-II. The tumor IGF-II content was extremely high, messenger RNA (mRNA) for IGF-II showed a 100-fold increase in expression compared with normal human liver tissue. Of special interest, a newly identified exon (hE1) was shown to be predominantly expressed in the tumor by Northern blot analysis using leader exon-specific rat IGF-II complementary DNA (cDNA) probes. Although the significance of this finding remains uncertain, this is the first evidence of a new transcription unit in the human IGF-II gene. In addition, immunoblotting showed that the levels of the glucose transporters, GLUT1 and GLUT4, in the tumor were low and undetectable, respectively. This finding makes it unlikely that increased glucose consumption by the tumor accounted for the hypoglycemia in this patient. This case report provides an interesting insight into the pathophysiology of tumor-induced hypoglycemia and new evidence of the abnormal regulation of IGF-II gene expression in human tumors.
Previous work demonstrated an inverse correlation between methylation at the three 5'-CCGG-3' sequences in positions +24, +6, and -215 relative to the cap site of the late E2A promoter of adenovirus type 2 (Ad2) DNA and its activity. In the study presented here, we used the genomic sequencing method to detect 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine (m5dC) residues in 5'-CG-3' sequences other than the 5'-CCGG-3' (Hpa II) sites. The patterns of methylation in all 5'-CG-3' sequences over a region of about 180 base pairs required for gene activity in the late E2A promoter of integrated Ad2 DNA were determined in cell lines that carry this promoter in an active or inactive state. In cell lines HE1 and uc2, the late E2A promoter is active and all thirteen 5'-CG-3' sequences between positions +24 and -160 are unmethylated. In cell line HE2, the same promoter is permanently shut off and all 5'-CG-3' sequences are methylated in both strands. Thus, the inverse correlation is perfect in these cell lines over a region of about 180 base pairs in the late E2A promoter. The same promoter segment was analyzed in cell lines mc23 and mc40, in which a late E2A promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene construct had been genomically fixed after in vitro 5'-CCGG-3' methylation and subsequent transfection. In cell line mc23, the preimposed methylation pattern was stable and the CAT gene was inactive. Genomic sequencing confirmed the presence of m5dC in the 5'-CCGG-3' sequences and revealed the spreading of methylation to neighboring 5'-CG-3' sequences along the entire promoter. Some of these sites were hemimethylated. In cell line mc40, several of the 120 integrated copies became demethylated in positions +24 and +6, but the promoter was methylated in some of the copies upstream of position -50. Cell line mc40 expressed the CAT gene.
The lytic activity of the Holothuria polii coelomocyte lysate resides in two electrophoretically distinct hemolysins identified as He1 and He2. He1 represents the calcium dependent, heat-labile component whereas He2 is calcium independent and heat-stable. The two hemolysins share serological identity. Both hemolysins appear as single protein molecules of 80KDa molecular weight by SDS-PAGE and transblotting analysis under non-reducing conditions. However under reducing conditions, they are doublets of 76 and 80KDa molecular weight. The hypothesis that the two hemolysins could be isoforms is discussed.
We previously described human T cell leukemia/lymphoma virus-1-transformed T cell clones expressing surface molecules binding to monoclonal antibodies against lymphocyte Fc epsilon receptor (Fc epsilon R) and releasing soluble factors binding to both IgE and to monoclonal antibody to lymphocyte Fc epsilon R. In this study, one such clone (HE1-11) was tested for the presence of mRNA hybridizing with a cDNA probe coding for Fc epsilon R on B cells. Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of the same 1.7 kb Fc epsilon R mRNA in HE1-11 and in RPMI 8866 cells as well as in the macrophage cell line U937, expressing Fc epsilon R. The IgE binding factors (BF) released by HE1-11 cells appeared to be identical to those released by RPMI 8866 cells as shown by 1) one- and two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and 2) tryptic peptides analysis. IgE-BF are microheterogeneous containing molecules with molecular mass of 25 to 27 kDa and with isoelectric point ranging from 4.5 to 5. Some preparations further contained 16-kDa fragments of IgE-BF. These findings suggest that the gene coding for both Fc epsilon R and IgE-BF may also be expressed on some human T cells.
Three independent cell lines were established from primary cultures of LSH hamster embryo cells infected with bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1). Although these cell lines differed in their in vitro saturation densities, none was capable of colony formation in soft agar. Interestingly, two cell lines (BPV-HE1 and BPV-HE3) were tumorigenic in nude mice, syngeneic hamsters, and allogeneic hamsters, whereas BPV-HE2 was not. All three cell lines contained similar numbers of the BPV-1 genome (approximately 50 to 200 copies per cell). However, the nontumorigenic BPV-HE2 cell line contained very low levels of BPV-specific RNA and only small amounts of the BPV-1 E5 transforming protein. The efficiency and rate of tumor formation by BPV-HE1 and BPV-HE3 correlated directly with the apparent amount of viral E5 protein. This analysis suggests that there is a threshold level of BPV protein synthesis required for tumorigenicity, there is a continuum of tumorigenic phenotypes which may depend upon the level of BPV protein expression, and BPV-transformed hamster cells can withstand allogeneic transplantation.
An evaluation of infusion pumps and controllers is being undertaken for the UK Department of Health and Social Security within the Bath District Health Authority. The technical performance and safety assessments are being made at the Bath Institute of Medical Engineering, and the user assessment at various hospitals in the Bath area. The first batch assessed was constituted of devices which achieve control by means of detecting drip-rate (the Frenshore IC2 and Ivac 231 controllers and the Imed 911, Ivac 531, Graseby Dynamics MP20 and Vickers (DC2 pumps), and the second batch to be assessed was constituted of syringe pumps (the Braun Perfusors ED2 and V1, Fresenius Injectomat 30 and 50, Graseby Dynamics MS16 and its MS18 variant, Sage 242A and its 242E and 240E variants, and Vickers Treonic 1 P3). The results of these assessments were reported in 'Health Equipment Information' ('HE1') 96 (September 1981) and 106 (October 1982) respectively. We reproduce below a review of controlled infusion techniques, from the first report, and extracts of the report of the assessment of syringe pumps.
Single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) are small monovalent recombinant antibody fragments that retain the specificity of their parent immunoglobulins. ScFvs are excellent building blocks for new and improved immunodiagnostic and therapeutic proteins. However, the monovalency and the rapid renal elimination of scFvs result in poor tumor accumulation and retention. Engineering divalent antibody fragments is an excellent way to address these shortcomings. In this study, covalent divalent single-chain variable fragments (sc(Fv)(2)s), were constructed from the monovalent anti-keratin 8 scFvs, TS1-218 and its mutant, HE1-Q. The scFvs and sc(Fv)(2)s were expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, utilizing the alpha-factor secretion signal (α-factor) for extracellular secretion. The immunoreactivity and specificity of the antibody fragments were analyzed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the uptake and retention of the (125)I labeled antibody fragments were evaluated using HeLa HEp-2 multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTSs). Analysis of the antibody fragments demonstrated that parts of the α-factor remained at the N-terminal of the antibody fragments. Despite incomplete processing of the α-factor, the antibody fragments were functional where the sc(Fv)(2)s gave a three-fold stronger signal in ELISA compared to their scFv counterparts and the mutant antibodies demonstrated a stronger signal than their initial wild types. In addition, the sc(Fv)(2)s DiTS1-218 and DiHE1-Q displayed an approximately two-fold higher uptake and were retained to a larger extent in the MCTS, demonstrating a 3.9 and 9.4-fold increase in half-life respectively compared to their corresponding scFvs. In conclusion, expression in P. pastoris improved the yield 20-fold and facilitated the purification of the antibody fragments. Furthermore, the sc(Fv)(2)s presented a higher functional affinity to K 8 both in ELISA and MCTS compared to the scFvs with DiHE1-Q being the best candidate for further studies.
The human (h) pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (hPDC) consists of multiple copies of several components: pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1), dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2), dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3), E3-binding protein (BP), and specific kinases and phosphatases. Mammalian PDC has a well organized structure with an icosahedral symmetry of the central E2/BP core to which the other component proteins bind non-covalently. Both hE2 and hBP consist of three well defined domains, namely the lipoyl domain, the subunit-binding domain and the inner domain, connected with flexible linkers. hE1 (alpha(2)beta(2)) binds to the subunit-binding domain of hE2; whereas hE3 binds to the E3-binding domain of hBP. Among several residues of the C-terminal surface of the hE1beta E1betaD289 was found to interact with hE2K276. The C-terminal residue I329 of the hE1beta did not participate in binding to hE2. This latter finding shows specificity in the interaction between E1beta and E2 in hPDC. The selective binding between hE3 and the E3-binding domain of hBP was investigated using specific mutants. E3R460G and E3340K showed significant reductions in affinity for hBP as determined by surface plasmon resonance. Both residues are involved in the structural organization of the binding site on hE3. Substitution of I157, N137 and R155 of hBP resulted in variable increases in the K(D) for binding with wild-type hE3, suggesting that the binding results from several weak electrostatic bonds and hydrophobic interactions among residues of hBP with residues at the interface of dimeric hE3. These results provide insight in the mono-specificity of binding of E1 to E2 and E3 to BP in hPDC and showed the differences in the binding of peripheral components (E1 and E3) in human and bacterial PDCs.
The eye lens Crystallin proteins are subject to UV irradiation throughout life, and the photochemistry of damage proceeds through the excited state; thus, their tryptophan (Trp) fluorescence lifetimes are physiologically important properties. The time-resolved fluorescence spectra of single Trps in human gammaD- and gammaS-Crystallins have been measured with both an upconversion spectrophotofluorometer on the 300 fs to 100 ps time scale, and a time correlated single photon counting apparatus on the 100 ps to 10 ns time scale, respectively. Three Trps in each wild type protein were replaced by phenylalanine, leading to single-Trp mutants: W68-only and W156-only of HgammaD- and W72-only and W162-only of HgammaS-Crystallin. These proteins exhibit similar ultrafast signatures: positive definite decay associated spectra (DAS) for 50-65 ps decay constants that indicate dominance of fast, heterogeneous quenching. The quenched population (judged by amplitude) of this DAS differs among mutants. Trps 68, 156 in human gammaD- and Trp72 in human gammaS-Crystallin are buried, but water can reach amide oxygen and ring HE1 atoms through narrow channels. QM-MM simulations of quenching by electron transfer predict heterogeneous decay times from 50-500 ps that agree with our experimental results. Further analysis of apparent radiative lifetimes allow us to deduce that substantial subpopulations of Trp are fully quenched in even faster (sub-300 fs) processes for several of the mutants. The quenching of Trp fluorescence of human gammaD- and gammaS-Crystallin may protect them from ambient light induced photo damage.
Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a reversible neuropsychiatric syndrome in patients with liver disease. It was suggested that Bifidobacterium+fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) may decrease blood and brain ammonia levels.
The study was conducted to compare the efficacy of Bifidobacterium+FOS and lactulose in patients with HE.
One hundred and twenty-five patients (35 hepatitis B virus infected, 70 hepatitis C virus infected and 20 cryptogenetic cirrhosis) were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomized either to a treatment for 60 days with Bifidobacterium and FOS (group A) or into-group receiving lactulose (group B) in double-blind.
After 30 days of the study period, the Bifidobacterium+FOS-treated patients compared with lactulose-treated patients showed a significant decrease of Trail Making Test B (TMT B) (P&lt;0.005), and a significant increase of Symbol Digit Modalities Test (P&lt;0.001) and Block Design Test (P&lt;0.001).After 60 days of the study period, the Bifidobacterium+FOS-treated patients compared with lactulose-treated patients showed a significant decrease of NH4 fasting HE1 (P&lt;0.001), TMT A (P&lt;0.05), TMT B (P&lt;0.001), and a significant increase of Symbol Digit Modalities Test (P&lt;0.001) and Block Design Test (P&lt;0.001).
The treatment with Bifidobacterium+FOS is an alternative to the use of lactulose in patients with cirrhosis, for its usefulness in reducing blood ammonia levels and improvement of psychometric tests.
Aberrant splicing and point mutations in the human presenilin genes, PSEN1 and PSEN2, have been linked to familial forms of Alzheimer's disease. We have previously described that low-level aberrant splicing of exon 8 in zebrafish psen1 transcripts in zebrafish embryos produces potent dominant negative effects that increase psen1 transcription, cause a dramatic hydrocephalus phenotype, decreased pigmentation and other developmental defects. Similar effects are also observed after low-level interference with splicing of exon 8 of psen2. To determine the molecular etiology of these effects, we performed microarray analyses of global gene expression changes. Of the 100 genes that showed greatest dysregulation after either psen1 or psen2 manipulation, 12 genes were common to both treatments. Five of these have known function and showed increased expression: cyclin G1 (ccng1), prosaposin (psap), cathepsin Lb (ctslb), heat shock protein 70kDa (hsp70) and hatching enzyme 1 (he1). We used phylogenetic and conserved synteny analysis to confirm the orthology of zebrafish ccng1 with human CCNG1. We analyzed the expression of zebrafish ccng1 in developing embryos to 24 hours post fertilization (hpf). Decreased ccng1 expression does not rescue the hydrocephalus or pigmentation phenotypes of embryos with aberrant splicing of psen1 exon 8.
High resolution microwave and millimeter-wave spectra of HeN-CO clusters with N up to 10, produced in a molecular expansion, were observed. Two series of J = 1-0 transitions were detected, which correspond to the a-type and b-type J = 1-0 transitions of He1-CO. The B rotational constant initially decreases with N and reaches a minimum at N = 3. Its subsequent rise indicates the transition from a molecular complex to a quantum solvated system already for N = 4. For N &gt; or =6, the B value becomes larger than that of He1-CO, indicating an almost free rotation of CO within the helium environment.
Recently ROC50 index-the area under the lower portion of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve up to the first 50 false positives-has been increasingly widely used in genomic research. Unfortunately, statistical inferences on the ROC50 index are not commonly drawn due to a lack of handy statistical inference methods and/or software tools. In this paper, we reviewed developments in statistical methods for the partial areas under ROC curves and using nonparametric methods we derived a simple and direct variance calculation formula for the partial areas, different from existing methods in the literature. We have also verified our method through simulation studies and compared our method with existing bi-normal approaches. We have shown that the partial area has an asymptotic normal distribution using trimmed U-statistics theory. On the basis of this asymptotic normality, we have given formulas for the confidence interval and the test statistic and we reported on their application to a genomic study of sample size approximately 10,000.
A Klebsiella sp. HE1 strain isolated from hydrogen-producing sewage sludge was examined for its ability to produce H2 and other valuable soluble metabolites (e.g., ethanol and 2,3-butanediol) from sucrose-based medium. The effect of pH and carbon substrate concentration on the production of soluble and gaseous products was investigated. The major soluble metabolite produced from Klebsiella sp. HE1 was 2,3-butanediol, accounting for over 42-58% of soluble microbial products (SMP) and its production efficiency enhanced after increasing the initial culture pH to 7.3 (without pH control). The HE1 strain also produced ethanol (contributing to 29-42% of total SMP) and a small amount of lactic acid and acetic acid. The gaseous products consisted of H2 (25-36%) and CO2 (64-75%). The optimal cumulative hydrogen production (2.7 l) and hydrogen yield (0.92mol H2 mol sucrose(-1)) were obtained at an initial sucrose concentration of 30g CODl(-1) (i.e., 26.7gl(-1)), which also led to the highest production rate for H2 (3.26mmol h(-1)l(-1)), ethanol (6.75mmol h(-1)l(-1)) and 2,3-butanediol (7.14mmol h(-1)l(-1)). The highest yield for H2, ethanol and 2,3-butanediol was 0.92, 0.81 and 0.59molmol-sucrose(-1), respectively. As for the overall energy production performance, the highest energy generation rate was 27.7kJ h(-1)l(-1) and the best energy yield was 2.45kJmolsucrose(-1), which was obtained at a sucrose concentration of 30 and 20g CODl(-1), respectively.
In human (h) pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) the pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) is bound to the E1-binding domain of dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2). The C-terminal surface of the E1beta subunit was scanned for the negatively charged residues involved in binding with E2. betaD289 of hE1 interacts with K276 of hE2 in a manner similar to the corresponding interaction in Bacillus stearothermophilus PDC. In contrast to bacterial E1beta, the C-terminal residue of the hE1beta does not participate in the binding with positively charged residues of hE2. This latter finding shows species specificity in the interaction between hE1beta and hE2 in PDC.
We have previously demonstrated that the amount of HE1/NPC2 mRNA and protein expressed in the human epididymis is decreased under vasectomy. In this study, western blot analyses showed that many vasovasostomized men are characterized by high HE1/NPC2 levels in spermatozoa when compared with fertile donors. HE1/NPC2 association with sperm from vasovasostomized men was not related to low motility per se as spermatozoa from asthenospermic men have HE1/NPC2 levels similar to those in normal fertile semen samples. Spermatozoa from vasovasostomized men with high amount of HE1/NPC2 are characterized by higher concentration of cholesterol and more lipid raft domains. HE1/NPC2 is secreted in different glycoforms by different tissues of human male reproductive tract. These forms are due to variation in N-glycosylation, and only the deglycosylated form is associated with spermatozoa from some vasovasostomized men. Compared with normal men, seminal plasma of vasectomized men is characterized by a major decrease in immunodetectable HE1/NPC2 without change in the glycosylation pattern. Following surgical vasectomy reversal, seminal plasma HE1/NPC2 was found in similar amounts to the ones characterizing normal men. Considering the potential role of HE1/NPC2 in cholesterol transport during sperm maturation, unusual high levels of this protein associated with spermatozoa of vasovasostomized men may reflect epididymal sequelae occurring when the vas deferens is obstructed.
The proteins that are neosynthesized and secreted in the different regions of the human epididymis were determined by in vitro biosynthesis of epididymal tubules, and the luminal proteins were collected by microperfusion of each tubule. The preparations were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and the proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. Some of the major proteins identified corresponded to serum compounds such as albumin, transferrin and alpha-1-antitrypsin. The other proteins identified included lactotransferrin, clusterin, PEBP, NCP2/CTP/HE1, HE3, Crisp, actin, calmodulin, E12, PGDS, l-lactate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, carbonic anhydrase, triose phosphate isomerase, glutamyltransferase, glutathione S-transferase P, thioredoxin peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, cathepsin D and cystatin. Epididymal activity is highly regionalized in most species. However, in this study in humans, there were only minor changes in the major proteins secreted. It is suggested that this specificity might be related to the difference between species in the location of the epididymis where sperm become fertile.
The lipoproteins derived from cholesterol are the key to understanding atherogenesis. The main source of lipids for macrophages presented in the subendothelial space are lipoproteins undergoing oxidative modification or aggregation. Lipoproteins internalized in macrophages via endocytosis or phagocytosis are delivered to peripheral endosomes or lysosomes, where they are hydrolyzed. Large amounts of cholesteryl esters bound to cytoplasmic membranes are permanently affected by neutral hydrolase and repeated re-esterification by ACAT. Liberated free cholesterol is provided to the plasma membrane and other intracellulare structures, probably by vesicular transport. This transport is probably partially mediated by npc1 and npc2 (HE1) proteins, as well as lysobiphosphatidic acid. If some cholesterol acceptors, for example HDL particles, are available, some of the cholesterol can leave the cell, enter the circulation, and be transported to the liver in a process of reverse cholesterol transport. Modification of the lipid droplets fluidity by lipid composition is an important factor in susceptibility to this cholesterol efflux. The free cholesterol, especially crystalline, induces apoptosis. Finally, foam cells die and cellular cholesterol esters and free cholesterol are released into the lesion. This represents lipid or necrotic core formation in advanced atheromata. In this paper the role of oxysterols, triglycerides, fatty acids, and phospholips in atherogenesis are also described.
Niemann Pick type C (NPC) disease is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by abnormal cholesterol metabolism and accumulation in lysosomal and endosomal compartments. Although peripheral organs are affected, the progressive neurodegeneration in the brain is typically most deleterious, leading to dystonia, ataxia, seizures, and premature death. Although the two genes underlying this disorder in humans and mouse models of the disease have been identified (NPC1 in 95% and NPC2/HE1 in 5% of human cases), their cellular roles have not Been fully defined, and there is currently no effective treatment for this disorder. To help address these issues, we constructed a recombinant adenovirus, Ad(NPC1-GFP), which contains a cDNA encoding a mouse NPC1 protein with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to its C-terminus. Fluorescence microscopy and cholesterol trafficking assays demonstrate that the GFP-tagged NPC1 protein is functional and detectable in cells from different species (hamster, mouse, human) and of different types (ovary-derived cells, fibroblasts, astrocytes, neurons from peripheral and central nervous systems) in vitro. Combined with results from time-lapse microscopy and in vivo brain injections, our findings suggest that this adenovirus offers advantages for expressing NPC1 and analyzing its cellular localization, movement, functional properties, and beneficial effects in vitro and in vivo.
Infrared spectra of isotopically substituted HeN-CO clusters (1 &lt; N &lt; 19) have been studied in order to extend the original results on the normal isotope. The same two series of R(0) transitions were observed, correlating with the a- and b-type transitions of He1-CO, with only small shifts in relative position. The previously obscured a-type line for He6-CO was detected. Examination of the small shifts among isotopomers showed remarkably smooth behavior, except in the "unstable" regions around N=7 (b-type series) and 15 (a-type series). The overall results firmly support the assignments and analysis given for the normal isotope.
Niemann-Pick Type C (NPC) disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in either the NPC1 or HE1 genes. Hallmarks of this presently incurable disease include abnormal intracellular accumulation of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids, progressive neuropathology and neurodegeneration, and premature death. There have been increased efforts to understand the effects of NPC disease on neurons of the brain, in part due to the recent development of improved research tools and reagents, and in part due to the rapidly growing appreciation of the importance of cholesterol and lipoproteins in the brain during neuronal development, function, and degeneration. Here, we highlight fundamental aspects of neurons that appear to be affected by NPC disease, including their morphology, metabolism, intracellular transport, electrical signaling, and response to environmental factors, and suggest other potentially important areas for future investigation. This provides a framework for acquiring additional insight to this disorder and shaping new therapeutic approaches to NPC disease.
Somatic cell hydridization and linkage studies indicated the implication of a second gene as a cause of Niemann-Pick C disease in a minority (5%) of patients. A study of the lysosomal proteome led to the identification of a previously known gene, HE1, as the NPC2 gene. The mature NPC2/HE1 protein is a ubiquitous soluble small 132-amino-acid glycoprotein, first characterized as a major secretory protein in the human epididymis, but also detected in most tissues. Seventeen families with mutations in the NPC2 gene are known. Good genotype-phenotype correlations were observed. No distinction can be made between the biochemical phenotypes of NPC1 or NPC2 mutants. The NPC2 protein binds cholesterol with submicromolar affinity at neutral and acidic pH. The bovine protein has been crystallized, and the cholesterol-binding site assigned to a hydrophobic loosely packed region. There is strong evidence that the NPC1 and NPC2 proteins must function in a closely related fashion. Current data have led to the hypothesis that NPC2 would bind cholesterol from internal lysosomal membranes, enabling a physical interaction with NPC1 (or another protein) and allowing postlysosomal export of cholesterol. In this model, the activity of NPC1 would depend on that of NPC2. The precise function of the NPC2 protein has, however, not been fully elucidated.
New promising compounds, derived from the esterification of hyaluronic acid with butyric acid, were investigated in vitro on a non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line (NCI-H460) and an its metastatic subclone (NCI-H460M). All new compounds exerted a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on both cell lines, which expressed CD44, the specific surface receptor for hyaluronic acid, in a very high percentage of cells (90%). HE1, the most effective of these compounds, was 10-fold more effective than sodium butyrate (NaB) in inhibiting cell proliferation. Similarly to NaB, after 24 hours of treatment, HE1 affected the expression of three cell cycle-related proteins (p27(kip1), p53 and p21(waf1)) responsible for growth arrest, indicating that the presence of the hyaluronic acid backbone does not interfere with the biologic activity. Intratumoral treatment with HE1 demonstrated a marked efficacy on primary tumor growth and on lung metastases formation of the murine Lewis Lung Carcinoma model. Altogether, present findings suggest a possible clinical application of these novel butyric pro-drugs in primary and metastatic lung cancer.
Identification of the rodent counterparts of human and canine epididymal cDNAs HE3, HE4 and Ce8/Ly6G5C by sequence homology and analysis of their expression patterns and regulation level in the rat.
"Electronic screening" of Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) and genomic databases, followed by RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis.
Rodent ESTs and genomic sequences homologous to HE3, HE4 and Ce8/Ly6G5C were identified in the public databases and the "full-length" rat cDNAs cloned. To emphasise their homology to the human and canine genes, they were named Me3/Re3, Me4/Re4 and Re8 for mouse and rat counterparts, respectively. mRNA expression patterns were analysed in rats, including rat HE1 and HE5/CD52 counterparts as controls. Re3 and Re8 mRNAs were only found in the rat epididymis, while Re4 showed a broader tissue distribution. Within the epididymis, Re3 and Re4 mRNAs were detected in all regions; Re8, on the other hand, was restricted to the caput. During postnatal development, Re3 and control mRNAs were found from the earliest stages investigated, while Re8 mRNA was observed only from day 24 postnatum, corresponding to the onset of spermatogenesis in the prepubertal testis. Castration and testosterone supplementation of adult male rats suggested that none of the cloned mRNAs was directly androgen-regulated. Efferent duct ligation, however, showed that Re8 mRNA levels depended on testicular factors other than androgens.
The novel rodent cDNAs can now be used to monitor epididymal gene expression more closely and to set up various regulatory and functional studies.
Epididymal roles include protection and transport, maturation, and storage of the sperm cells. It is known that these functions are altered under vasectomy, but the consequences of excurrent duct obstruction on the pattern of gene expression along the human epididymis are poorly documented. In order to understand how excurrent duct occlusion affects different epididymal regions, the expression pattern of genes known to be expressed in specific epididymal segments was investigated along the epididymides of vasectomized men. Selected human epididymal complementary DNAs (cDNAs) identified by differential library screening were studied because of their unique messenger RNA (mRNA) distribution along the different epididymal segments. In situ hybridization as well as immunohistologic studies were undertaken to investigate the effect of vasectomy on a gene expressed all along the epididymis (HE1) or more selectively in the proximal (HE2) or distal (HE5) segment. The HE1 transcript was affected by the obstruction of the epididymis with little or no mRNA detectable along the epididymis. The HE1-related antigen was shown by immunohistochemical methods to be reduced within the epithelium of the epididymis of vasectomized men. By contrast, HE5 mRNA and protein, expressed in epithelial cells of the distal epididymis, were not affected by the obstruction of the vas deferens. Similarly, HE2 transcriptional and translational products normally expressed in the caput epididymidis were not affected by vasectomy. These results show that excurrent duct obstruction differentially affects the expression pattern of some specific transcripts and their encoded proteins, probably impairing their fundamental roles in the physiology of the epididymis.
Niemann-Pick type C disease is an autosomal-recessive, inherited neurovisceral lipid storage disorder. This disease results from either protein NPC1 or HE1 deficiency, which leads to cholesterol metabolism disturbance and is characterized by early hepatosplenomegaly and progressive ataxia, dystonia, cataplexy, dysarthria, and dementia. We describe a 3 1/2-year-old patient with Niemann-Pick type C disease, who presented with regression in both cognitive and motor domains. Almost 10 months before admission to the hospital, the child developed progressive speech and behavioral changes, as well as gait disturbances with frequent falls. The examination demonstrated hepatosplenomegaly, ataxia, and vertical gaze palsy. Nerve conduction velocities demonstrated mild demyelinating peripheral neuropathy. Bone marrow examination revealed foam cells, and cholesterol esterification studies found massive accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and very low intracellular esterification of exogenous lipoprotein-derived cholesterol. These results indicate Niemann-Pick type C disease. Peripheral neuropathy is a rare complication in patients with Niemann-Pick type C disease, which certainly contributes to their neurologic deterioration.
Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a rare, neurovisceral lipid storage disorder caused by genetic defects in lipid transporting proteins. It is distinct from Niemann-Pick types A and B (sphingomyelin lipidoses) and displays genetic (mutations in the NPC1 or NPC2[=HE1] gene), biochemical, and clinical heterogeneity. Late infantile to juvenile forms of NPC predominate and are characterised by atypical behaviour, ataxia, dysarthria, dysphagia, dystonia, cataplexy, vertical gaze palsy, splenomegaly, and dementia. In adult variants, psychosis and dementia are common, and dysarthria, ataxia, splenomegaly, and vertical gaze palsy are further facultative signs. Routine laboratory results including serum cholesterol are normal. In bone marrow smears, sea-blue histiocytes are often demonstrated and foam cells sometimes seen. The diagnosis is confirmed by detecting free cholesterol accumulation in perinuclear granules (lysosomes) and reduced cholesterol esterification after challenge with exogenous low-density lipoprotein in fibroblasts. Alternatively or additionally, mutational analysis can be performed. Treatment is restricted to symptomatic measures, since there is no specific therapy.
Current EASL/AASLD guidelines recommend treatment of covert hepatic encephalopathy (HE) only in symptomatic patients, for example, in those with impaired quality of life or with affected driving abilities.
Because testing for impaired quality of life is time consuming, the aim of the present study was to identify simple clinical predictors for poor quality of life in patients with covert HE (CHE).
In total, 139 cirrhotic in- and outpatients without a history of overt hepatic encephalopathy were enrolled. Diagnosis of HE grade 1 (HE1) was diagnosed clinically according to the West-Haven Criteria. Critical flicker frequency and the Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score were used to detect minimal HE (MHE). Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire was used to assess health-related quality of life (HrQoL).
CHE was detected in 51 (36.7%) patients. Multivariate analysis identified a history of falls in the previous year (P=0.003) and female gender (P=0.030) as independent predictors of reduced HRQoL in patients with CHE. Comparison of patients with and without a history of falls revealed relevant differences in the subdomains-abdominal symptoms, fatigue, systemic symptoms, emotional functions and worries.
A history of falls and female gender are associated with impaired HRQoL in patients with CHE. These data indicate that a history of falls should be considered as a treatment indication in patients with CHE to improve HRQoL and ultimately prognosis.
The human 2-oxoglutaric acid dehydrogenase complex (hOGDHc) plays a pivotal role in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and its diminished activity is associated with neurodegenerative diseases. The hOGDHc comprises three components, hE1o, hE2o, and hE3, and we recently reported functionally active E1o and E2o components, enabling studies on their assembly. No atomic-resolution structure for the hE2o component is currently available, so here we first studied the interactions in the binary subcomplexes (hE1o-hE2o, hE1o-hE3, and hE2o-hE3) to gain insight into the strength of their interactions and to identify the interaction loci in them. We carried out multiple physico-chemical studies, including fluorescence, hydrogen-deuterium exchange MS (HDX-MS), and chemical cross-linking MS (CL-MS). Our fluorescence studies suggested a strong interaction for the hE1o-hE2o subcomplex, but a much weaker interaction in the hE1o-hE3 subcomplex, and failed to identify any interaction in the hE2o-hE3 subcomplex. The HDX-MS studies gave evidence for interactions in the hE1o-hE2o and hE1o-hE3 subcomplexes comprising full-length components, identifying: (i) the N-terminal region of hE1o, in particular the two peptides 18YVEEM22 and 27ENPKSVHKSWDIF39 as constituting the binding region responsible for the assembly of the hE1o with both the hE2o and hE3 components into hOGDHc, an hE1 region absent in available X-ray structures; and (ii) a novel hE2o region comprising residues from both a linker region and from the catalytic domain as being a critical region interacting with hE1o. The CL-MS identified the loci in the hE1o and hE2o components interacting with each other.
Capacitive de-ionization (CDI) systems are well-known for their low energy consumption making them suitable for applications powered by renewable energy. In this study, CDI technology is, for the first time, integrated with a suitably-scaled, stand-alone, renewable power system comprising photovoltaic panels and battery storage. Guidelines for designing and sizing such power systems are proposed including determining electrode charging current, PV panels and battery capacity. A 1 kW pilot plant was designed, constructed and operated to verify the proposed guidelines. Using the pilot plant, the total energy consumption of the system has been evaluated with different electrode charging currents and influent flow rates and the relationship between these parameters analyzed. This analysis has enabled the development of practical design guidelines for bulk water treatment with MCDI electrodes. The results of this study show that use of photovoltaic-powered MCDI water treatment, particularly when combined with energy recovery, is competitive against more mature water-treatment technologies for particular applications and at particular locations.
Diagnosis of covert hepatic encephalopathy (CHE) is time consuming in clinical practice. Recently, a new diagnostic tool - the simplified Animal Naming Test (S-ANT1) - was presented with promising results in an Italian cohort. The aim of the present study was to validate S-ANT1 in a cohort of cirrhotic patients from a German tertiary referral centre.
143 cirrhotic patients and 37 healthy controls were enrolled. Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) grade 1 (HE1) was clinically diagnosed according to the West-Haven Criteria. Critical flicker frequency and Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score were used to detect minimal HE (MHE). All participants were additionally examined by S-ANT1.
58 (40.6%) patients presented with CHE (40 MHE, 18 HE1). S-ANT1 was lowest in patients with HE1, followed by patients with MHE, patients without CHE, and healthy controls, respectively (each p &lt; 0.05). Naming &lt;20 animals discriminated best between patients with and without CHE in ROC analysis (with Youden's index). With a cut-off value of ≥23 mentioned animal names further testing for CHE could be avoided in 38.5% of patients with a negative predictive value of 84%.
S-ANT1 may become an important first screening tool for the assessment of CHE in clinical practice.
Recent studies have proposed a connection between the individual alpha band peak frequency and the temporal resolution of visual perception in healthy human participants. This connection rests on animal studies describing oscillations in the alpha band as a mode of phasic thalamocortical information transfer for low-level visual stimuli, which critically relies on GABAergic interneurons. Here, we investigated the interplay of these parameters by measuring occipital alpha band peak frequency by means of magnetoencephalography, visual temporal resolution by means of behavioral testing, and occipital GABA levels by means of magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Importantly, we investigated a sample of healthy participants and patients with varying grades of hepatic encephalopathy, which are known to exhibit decreases in the investigated parameters, thus providing an increased parameter space. We found that occipital alpha band peak frequency and visual temporal resolution were positively correlated, i.e., higher occipital alpha band peak frequencies were on average related to a higher temporal resolution. Likewise, occipital alpha band peak frequency correlated positively with occipital GABA levels. However, correlations were significant only when both healthy participants and patients were included in the analysis, thereby indicating a connection of the measures on group level (instead of the individual level). These findings provide new insights into neurophysiological and neurochemical underpinnings of visual perception.
While flow-electrode capacitive deionization (FCDI) is a potential alternative to brackish and/or sea water desalination, there is limited understanding of both the fate of ions following migration across the ion exchange membranes and the mechanisms responsible for ion separation. In this study, we investigate the desalting performance of an FCDI system operated over a range of conditions. Results show that although ion transport as a result of electrodialysis is inevitable in FCDI (and is principally responsible for pH excursion in the flow electrode), the use of high carbon content ensures that a high proportion of the charge and counterions are retained in the electrical double layers of the flowing carbon particles, even at high charging voltages (e.g., 2.0 V) during the deionization process. Estimation of the portions of sodium and chloride ions adsorbed in the flow electrode after migration through the membranes suggests that the ongoing capacitive adsorption exhibits asymmetric behavior with the anodic particles demonstrating better affinity for Cl- (than the cathodic particles for Na+) during electrosorption. These findings provide an explanation for the change in electrode properties that are observed under imperfect adsorption scenarios and provide insight into aspects of the design and operation of flow electrode pairs that is critical to achieving effective desalination by FCDI.
Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and HE grade 1 (HE1) according to the West Haven criteria have recently been grouped as one entity named-covert HE- (CHE). Data regarding the impact of CHE on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and sleep quality are controversial.
First, to determine whether CHE affects HRQoL and sleep quality of cirrhotic patients and second, whether minimal HE (MHE) and HE1 affect HRQoL and sleep quality to a comparable extent.
A total of 145 consecutive cirrhotic patients were enrolled. HE1 was diagnosed clinically according to the West Haven criteria. Critical flicker frequency and the Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score were used to detect MHE. Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ) was used to assess HRQoL and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was applied to assess sleep quality.
Covert HE was detected in 59 (40.7%) patients (MHE: n = 40; HE1: n = 19). Multivariate analysis identified CHE (P &lt; 0.001) and female gender (P = 0.006) as independent predictors of reduced HRQoL (CLDQ total score). CHE (P = 0.021), low haemoglobin (P = 0.024) and female gender (P = 0.003) were identified as independent predictors of poor sleep quality (PSQI total score). Results of CLDQ and PSQI were comparable in patients with HE1 and MHE (CLDQ: 4.6 ± 0.9 vs 4.5 ± 1.2, P = 0.907; PSQI: 11.3 ± 3.8 vs 9.9 ± 5.0, P = 0.3).
Covert HE was associated with impaired HRQoL and sleep quality. MHE and HE1 affected both outcomes to a comparable extent supporting the use of CHE as a clinically useful term for patients with both entities of HE in clinical practice.
Two novel bacterial strains were isolated from the roots of tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L.) from Dengfeng, Henan Province, China. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the isolates NEAU-DE8(1)T and NEAU-HE1(2) are closely related to one another (99.6% similarity) and are closely relate to Nonomuraea zeae NEAU-ND5T (98.3, 98.3%) and Nonomuraea gerenzanensis DSM 100948T (98.3, 98.0%). Phylogenetic trees constructed based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that both strains grouped with N. zeae NEAU-ND5T within the clade comprising the members of the genus Nonomuraea. Moreover, key chemotaxonomic properties including major menaquinones, fatty acid composition and phospholipid profiles also confirmed the affiliation of the two strains to the genus Nonomuraea. However, DNA-DNA hybridization data, together with physiological and morphological properties, showed that two isolates could be readily distinguished from their close phylogenetic relatives. Thus, on the basis of these phenotypic and genotypic data, strains NEAU-DE8(1)T and NEAU-HE1(2) are concluded to represent a novel species of the genus Nonomuraea, for which the name Nonomuraea lycopersici sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is NEAU-DE8(1)T (= CGMCC 4.7412T = DSM 104642T).
The present study investigated the litter performance of multiparous sows fed 3% and 6% densified diets at farrowing to weaning during summer with mean maximum room temperature of 30.5°C.
A total of 60 crossbred multiparous sows were allotted to one of three treatments based on body weight according to a completely randomized design. Three different nutrient levels based on NRC were applied as standard diet (ST; metabolizable energy, 3,300 kcal/kg), high nutrient level 1 (HE1; ST+3% higher energy and 16.59% protein) and high nutrient level 2 (HE2; ST+6% higher energy and 17.04% protein).
There was no variation in the body weight change. However, backfat thickness change tended to reduce in HE1 in comparison to ST treatment. Dietary treatments had no effects on feed intake, daily energy intake and weaning-to-estrus interval in lactating sows. Litter size, litter weight at weaning and average daily gain of piglets were significantly greater in sows in HE1 compared with ST, however, no difference was observed between HE2 and ST. Increasing the nutrient levels had no effects on the blood urea nitrogen, glucose, triglyceride, and creatinine at post-farrowing and weaning time. The concentration of follicle stimulating hormone, cortisol and insulin were not affected by dietary treatments either in post-farrowing or weaning time. The concentration of blood luteinizing hormone of sows in ST treatment was numerically less than sows in HE2 treatment at weaning. Milk and colostrum compositions such as protein, fat and lactose were not affected by the treatments.
An energy level of 3,400 kcal/kg (14.23 MJ/kg) with 166 g/kg crude protein is suggested as the optimal level of dietary nutrients for heat stressed lactating sows with significant beneficial effects on litter size.
Defect perovskites (He2-x□x)(CaZr)F6 can be prepared by inserting helium into CaZrF6 at high pressure. They can be recovered to ambient pressure at low temperature. There are no prior examples of perovskites with noble gases on the A-sites. The insertion of helium gas into CaZrF6 both elastically stiffens the material and reduces the magnitude of its negative thermal expansion. It also suppresses the onset of structural disorder, which is seen on compression in other media. Measurements of the gas released on warming to room temperature and Rietveld analyses of neutron diffraction data at low temperature indicate that exposure to helium gas at 500 MPa leads to a stoichiometry close to (He1□1)(CaZr)F6. Helium has a much higher solubility in CaZrF6 than silica glass or crystobalite. An analogue with composition (H2)2(CaZr)F6 would have a volumetric hydrogen storage capacity greater than current US DOE targets. We anticipate that other hybrid perovskites with small neutral molecules on the A-site can also be prepared and that they will display a rich structural chemistry.
Objective. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the usability of the telehealth system, coined Telekit, by using an iterative, mixed usability approach. Materials and Methods. Ten double experts participated in two heuristic evaluations (HE1, HE2), and 11 COPD patients attended two think-aloud tests. The double experts identified usability violations and classified them into Jakob Nielsen's heuristics. These violations were then translated into measurable values on a scale of 0 to 4 indicating degree of severity. In the think-aloud tests, COPD participants were invited to verbalise their thoughts. Results. The double experts identified 86 usability violations in HE1 and 101 usability violations in HE2. The majority of the violations were rated in the 0-2 range. The findings from the think-aloud tests resulted in 12 themes and associated examples regarding the usability of the Telekit system. The use of the iterative, mixed usability approach produced both quantitative and qualitative results. Conclusion. The iterative, mixed usability approach yields a strong result owing to the high number of problems identified in the tests because the double experts and the COPD participants focus on different aspects of Telekit's usability. This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01984840, November 14, 2013.
To explore the in vivo anticancer, anti-angiogenesis and immunomodulatory efficacies of the bioactive polysaccharide isolated from cold aqueous extract of Jania rubens (JCEM) and Pterocladia capillacea (PCEM) as well as hot aqueous extract of Enteromorpha intestinalis (EHEM) against hepatocellular carcinoma rat model (HCC) and to study their chemical composition.
The sugars and amino acids composition of the bioactive polysaccharides of JCEM, PCEM and EHEM were determined using gas liquid chromatography and amino acid analyzer, respectively. These polysaccharide extracts (20 mg/kg b.wt. for 5 weeks) were assessed on hepatocarcinogenesis in rats and α-fetoprotein (AFP), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), glypican-3 (GPC-3), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Ig G levels were evaluated.
The GLC analysis of JCEM, PCEM and EHEM polysaccharide revealed the presence of 10, 9 and 10 sugars, in addition the amino acid analyzer enable identification of 16, 15 and 15 amino acids, respectively. These polysaccharide extracts of JCEM, PCEM and EHEM produced significant decrease in serum AFP, CEA, GPC-3, HGF and VEGF compared with untreated HCC group. JCEM, PCEM and EHEM had an immunostimulatory responses by increasing the IgG levels as compared by naïve value (1.23, 1.53 and 1.17 folds), respectively. The bioactive polysaccharides in HCC induced rats improved the humoral immune response. The photomicrographs of liver tissue sections of the groups of HCC treated with polysaccharide extracts of Jania rubens and Enteromorpha intestinalis showed intact histological structure. Moreover, fractions HE1, HE4, HE7 obtained from polysaccharide of EHEM showed moderate cytotoxic activity against HepG2 in vitro with IC50 73.1, 42.6, 76.2 μg/mL. However, fractions of PCEM and JCEM show no or weak cytotoxicity against HepG2 in vitro where the cytotoxic activity of their crude polysaccharide extract proved synergetic effect.
The pronounced antitumor activity of sulfated polysaccharide-protein complexes of JCEM and EHEM is due to direct cytotoxic activity, anti-hepatocarcinogenesis, and anti-angiogenesis. In addition, JCEM, PCEM and EHEM had an immunostimulatory response and improved the humoral immune response in HCC induced rats.
The sense of bitter taste plays a critical role in animals as it can help them to avoid intake of toxic and harmful substances. Previous research had revealed that chicken has only three bitter taste receptor genes (Tas2r1, Tas2r2 and Tas2r7). To better understand the genetic polymorphisms and importance of bitter taste receptor genes (Tas2rs) in chicken, here, we sequenced Tas2rs of 30 Sichuan domestic chickens and 30 Tibetan chickens. Thirteen single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including three nonsynonymous mutations (m.359G&gt;C, m.503C&gt;A and m.583A&gt;G) were detected in Tas2r1 (m. is the abbreviation for mutation); three SNPs were detected in Tas2r2, but none of them were missense mutation; eight SNPs were detected in Tas2r7 including six nonsynonymous substitutions (m.178G&gt;A, m.421A&gt;C, m.787C&gt;T, m.832G&gt;T, m.907A&gt;T and m.943G&gt;A). Tajima's D neutral test indicates that there is no population expansion in both populations, and the size of the population is relatively stable. All the three networks indicate that red jungle fowls share haplotypes with domestic chickens. In addition, we found that haplotypes H1 and HE1 were positively associated with high-altitude adaptation, whereas haplotypes H4 and HE4 showed a negative correlation with high-altitude adaptation in Tas2rs. Although, chicken has only three Tas2rs, our results showed that both Sichuan domestic chickens and Tibetan chickens have abundant haplotypes in Tas2rs, especially in Tas2r7, which might help chickens to recognize a wide variety of bitter-tasting compounds. 
High molecular weight organic compounds (HMW-OCs), formed as secondary organic aerosols (SOA), have been reported in many laboratory studies. However, little evidence of HMW-OCs formation, in particular during winter season in the real atmosphere, has been reported. In January 2013, Beijing faced historically severe haze pollution, in which the hourly PM2.5 concentration reached as high as 974 μg m-3. Four typical haze events (HE1 to HE4) were identified, and HE2 (Jan. 9-16) was the most serious of these. Based on the hourly observed chemical composition of PM2.5 and the daily organic composition analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), we found that abundant ion peaks in m/z 200-850 appeared on heavy haze days, whereas these were negligible on a clear day, indicating the existence of HMW-OCs in the wintertime haze. A negative nonlinear correlation between HMW-OCs and O3 suggested that gas oxidation was not likely to be the dominant mechanism for HMW-OCs formation. During the heavy haze events, the relative humidity and mass ratio of H2O/PM2.5 reached as high as 80% and 0.2, respectively. The high water content and its good positive correlation with HMW-OCs indicated that an aqueous-phase process may be a significant pathway in wintertime. The evidence that acidity was much higher during HE2 (0.37 μg m-3) than on other days, as well as its strong correlation with HMW-OCs, indicated that acid-catalyzed reactions likely resulted in HMW-OCs formation during the heavy winter haze in Beijing.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of respiratory motion on the evaluation of the intratumoral heterogeneity of FDG uptake using cumulative SUV-volume histogram (CSH) and fractal analyses.
We used an NEMA IEC body phantom with a homogeneous hot sphere phantom (HO) and two heterogeneous hot sphere phantoms (HE1 and HE2). The background radioactivity of (18)F in the NEMA phantom was 5.3 kBq/mL. The ratio of radioactivity was 4:2:1 for the HO and the outer rims of the HE1 and HE2 phantoms, the inner cores of the HE1 and HE2 phantoms, and background, respectively. Respiratory motion was simulated using a motion table with an amplitude of 2 cm. PET/CT data were acquired using Biograph mCT in motionless and moving conditions. The PET images were analyzed by both CSH and fractal analyses. The area under the CSH (AUC-CSH) and the fractal dimension (FD) was used as quantitative metrics.
In motionless conditions, the AUC-CSHs of the HO (0.80), HE1 (0.75) and HE2 (0.65) phantoms were different. They did not differ in moving conditions (HO, 0.63; HE1, 0.65; HE2, 0.60). The FD of the HO phantom (0.77) was smaller than the FDs of the HE1 (1.71) and HE2 (1.98) phantoms in motionless conditions; however, the FDs of the HO (1.99) and HE1 (2.19) phantoms were not different from each other and were smaller than that of the HE2 (3.73) phantom in moving conditions.
Respiratory motion affected the results of the CSH and fractal analyses for the evaluation of the heterogeneity of the PET/CT images. The influence of respiratory motion was considered to vary depending on the object size.
Protein and lipid composition of sperm plasma membrane are modified as these gametes continue to mature during their transit along the spermatic tract. Our previous study revealed that during its journey through the spermatic duct of the black tiger prawn, Penaeus monodon, sperm cholesterol content decreases through the action of lipid-binding proteins within the luminal environment. In this study, the full cDNA sequence of epididymal secretory protein E1 (HE1), or Niemann-Pick C2 (NPC2), was cloned from P. monodon (termed Pmnpc2), and its conserved cholesterol/lipid-binding domain was characterized. The putative tertiary structure of PmNPC2 showed high similarity with the structure of Bos taurus NPC2. Pmnpc2 is expressed in many tissues, including the spermatic tract (i.e., testis, vas deferens, terminal ampoule) and the female thelycum. In situ hybridization revealed the presence of Pmnpc2 transcripts in the vas deferens, terminal ampoule, and thelycum epithelia, suggesting that PmNPC2 could be secreted into the lumen of the spermatic duct. A recombinant hexahistidine-tagged PmNPC2 (rPmNPC2-6His) was able to bind cholesterol and sperm lipid extracts, while co-incubation of sperm from the vas deferens with rPmNPC2-6His resulted in the depletion of cholesterol from these gametes. Together, these results suggest that PmNPC2 participates in sperm cholesterol efflux during the sperm maturation process in P. monodon. Mol. Reprod.

The pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is not fully understood yet. Hyperammonemia due to liver failure and subsequent disturbance of cerebral osmolytic balance is thought to play a pivotal role in the emergence of HE. The aim of this in-vivo MR spectroscopy study was to investigate the levels of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and its correlations with clinical symptoms of HE, blood ammonia, critical flicker frequency, and osmolytic levels. Thirty patients with minimal HE or HE1 and 16 age-matched healthy controls underwent graduation of HE according to the West-Haven criteria and including the critical flicker frequency (CFF), neuropsychometric testing and blood testing. Edited proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) was used to non-invasively measure the concentrations of GABA, glutamate (Glu), glutamine (Gln), and myo-inositol (mI) - all normalized to creatine (Cr) - in visual and sensorimotor cortex. GABA/Cr in the visual area was significantly decreased in mHE and HE1 patients and correlated both to the CFF (r = 0.401, P = 0.013) and blood ammonia levels (r = -0.434, P = 0.006). Visual GABA/Cr was also strongly linked to mI/Cr (r = 0.720, P &lt; 0.001) and Gln/Cr (r = -0.699, P &lt; 0.001). No group differences or correlations were found for GABA/Cr in the sensorimotor area. Hepatic encephalopathy is associated with a regional specific decrease of GABA levels in the visual cortex, while no changes were revealed for the sensorimotor cortex. Correlations of visual GABA/Cr with CFF, blood ammonia, and osmolytic regulators mI and Gln indicate that decreased visual GABA levels might contribute to HE symptoms, most likely as a consequence of hyperammonemia.
To explore the extent of the molecular cation perturbation induced by complexation with He atoms required for the application of cryogenic ion vibrational predissociation (CIVP) spectroscopy, we compare the spectra of a bare NH4(+)(H2O) ion (obtained using infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD)) with the one-photon CIVP spectra of the NH4(+)(H2O)·He1-3 clusters. Not only are the vibrational band origins minimally perturbed, but the rotational fine structures on the NH and OH asymmetric stretching vibrations, which arise from the free internal rotation of the -OH2 and -NH3 groups, also remain intact in the adducts. To establish the location and the quantum mechanical delocalization of the He atoms, we carried out diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations of the vibrational zero point wave function, which indicate that the barriers between the three equivalent minima for the He attachment are so small that the He atom wave function is delocalized over the entire -NH3 rotor, effectively restoring C3 symmetry for the embedded -NH3 group. 
Here, we determined the sequence of a cDNA encoding a guanylic acid-specific ribonuclease (RNase He1) from Hericium erinaceus that exhibits high sequence identity (59%) with RNase Po1, an enzyme with anti-cancer activity and which is found in Pleurotus ostreatus. RNase He1 and RNase Po1 have similar structures and heat stabilities; hence, RNase He1 may also have potential as an anti-cancer agent. Therefore, we initiated structure-function studies to further characterize the enzyme. Based on the RNase Po1 structure, RNase He1 is predicted to form 3 disulfide bonds involving Cys7-Cys98, Cys5-Cys83, and Cys47-Cys81 linkages. The Cys5Ala mutant exhibited no RNase activity, whereas the Cys81Ala mutant retained RNase activity, but had reduced heat stability. Therefore, the Cys5-Cys83 bond in RNase He1 is essential for the structure of the RNase active site region. Similarly, the Cys47-Cys81 bond helps maintain the conformational stability of the active site region, and may contribute to the greater heat stability of RNase He1.
RNase He1 from Hericium erinaceus, a member of the RNase T1 family, has high identity with RNase Po1 from Pleurotus ostreatus with complete conservation of the catalytic sequence. However, the optimal pH for RNase He1 activity is lower than that of RNase Po1, and the enzyme shows little inhibition of human tumor cell proliferation. Hence, to investigate the potential antitumor activity of recombinant RNase He1 and to possibly enhance its optimum pH, we generated RNase He1 mutants by replacing 12 Asn/Gln residues with Asp/Glu residues; the amino acid sequence of RNase Po1 was taken as reference. These mutants were then expressed in Escherichia coli. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we successfully modified the optimal pH for enzyme activity and generated a recombinant RNase He1 that inhibited the proliferation of cells in the human leukemia cell line. These properties are extremely important in the production of anticancer biologics that are based on RNase activity. 
The excess and deficit of serotonin can be the cause of somatic and mental disorders. The aim of this study was to evaluate serotonin levels in blood and ascitic fluid as well as excretion of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in urine in patients with hepatic encephalopathy (HE).
The study included 75 alcoholic cirrhotic patients divided into 3 groups (HE1, HE2, HE3), 25 patients each, with grade 1, 2 and 3 of hepatic encephalopathy according to West-Haven classification. The control group (C) included 25 clinically healthy volunteers. Venous blood and ascitic fluid were collected in fasting. On the same day a 24-hour urine collection was performed. Immunoenzymatic method was used to determine the serotonin level in serum and ascitic fluid, and 5-HIAA in urine (IBL-RE-59121, RE-59131).
In the control group, mean serum serotonin level (ng/ml) was 155.5 ± 38.1 and in the 3 study groups: HE1 - 175.2 ± 32.4 (NS), HE2 - 137.2 ± 28.6 (NS), HE3 - 108.3 ± 46.3 (p&lt;0.001). Serotonin concentration in ascitic fluid was on the average about 25% of its level in serum. The excretion of 5-HIAA in urine (mg/24h) in all groups, was: C - 5.9 ± 2.1, HE1 - 5.8 ± 1.8 (NS), HE2 - 4.8 ± 1.2(NS), HE3 - 4.3 ± 1.3 (p&lt;0.05).
The results of our study indicate that serum and ascitic fluid level of serotonin and urine excretion of 5-HIAA depends on the grade of hepatic encephalopathy. In patients with severe hepatic encephalopathy serotonin concentration in blood is decreased which can affect some clinical manifestation of this disease.
In this work, bacterial cellulose nanofibers were produced by using the Gluconacetobacter hansenii HE1 strain. These nanofibers were derivatized with dye affinity ligand Reactive Green 5, and these newly synthesized dye-attached nanofibers were used for affinity adsorption of urease. Reactive Green 5-attached nanofibers were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, SEM, and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy analysis. Some adsorption conditions which significantly affect the adsorption efficiency were investigated. The maximum urease adsorption capacity was found to be 240 mg/g nanofiber in pH 6.0 and at room temperature. Dye-free plain nanofibers also used for studying nonspecific urease adsorption onto plain nanofibers and nonspecific adsorption were found to be negligible (3.5 mg/g nanofiber). Prepared dye-attached nanofibers can be used in five successive adsorption/desorption steps without any decrease in their urease adsorption capacity. The desorption rate of the adsorbed urease was found to be 98.9 %. The activity of the urease was also investigated, and it was found that free and desorbed urease from the dye-attached nanofibers showed similar specific activity.
Until 2004, French rules for cardiac graft allocation were aimed at ensuring uniform organ distribution on the national scale, while logically giving priority to local teams. The allocation was center-based, with transplant MDs choosing the most suitable recipient from the local waiting list. In 2004, two national priority lists were added to the French cardiac graft allocation system. High Emergency 1 (HE1) is for patients with unstable hemodynamic status (on inotropes or ECMO), while High Emergency 2 (HE2) is for patients who develop complications during long-term circulatory support. Data from the French Biomedicines Agency show significantly poorer survival for HE1 patients than for HE2 patients. However, this should not lead to the conclusion that HE2 is a better strategy, as mortality during long-term circulatory support is not taken into account, and it is well known that the survival benefit of transplantation is significantly better in HE1 patients. Furthermore, the risk related to the quality of the cardiac graft must be taken into account. Indeed, the decision to transplant or not to transplant an HE1 patient with a given graft will impact not only the survival of the patient concerned, but also the waiting time of the other patients on the list, independently of allocation rules. This is also true for the criteria used to place a patient on the waiting list. Each cardiac transplantation team considers the level of risk before adding a patient to the waiting list, and this will impact not only the individual candidate but also the entire waiting list. Thus, even if allocation rules aim to provide all patients with the same chance of being transplanted across the entire country, the medical decision to accept a cardiac graft and to register a patient on the waiting list will make this process somewhat heterogeneous. This allows cardiac transplantation to be adapted to each individual case, independently of the rules. However, a multidisciplinary decision process is necessary to ensure fairness.
In the present study, the impacts of G198N and W128F mutations on the recognition between Aurora A and targeting protein of Xenopus kinesin-like protein 2 (TPX2) were investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, free energy calculations, and free energy decomposition analysis. The predicted binding free energy of the wild-type complex is more favorable than those of three mutants, indicating that both single and double mutations are unfavorable for the Aurora A and TPX2 binding. It is also observed that the mutations alternate the binding pattern between Aurora A and TPX2, especially the downstream of TPX2. An intramolecular hydrogen bond between the atom OD of Asp11(TPX2) and the atom HE1 of Trp34(TPX2) disappear in three mutants and thus lead to the instability of the secondary structure of TPX2. The combination of different molecular modeling techniques is an efficient way to understand how mutation has impacts on the protein-protein binding and our work gives valuable information for the future design of specific peptide inhibitors for Aurora A.
Fatigue is frequently reported in hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and may be related to hyperammonemia. Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) offers neuroprotective benefits and improves mitochondrial energetics and function.
This study evaluated the effect of exogenous ALC on physical and mental fatigue, fatigue severity, and physical activity in patients with mild and moderate hepatoencephalopathy (HE1 and HE2, respectively).
A total of 121 patients with overt HE were recruited to the study and were subdivided into 2 groups according to their initial HE grade [HE1 (n = 61) or HE2 (n = 60)]. Thirty-one patients with HE1 and 30 with HE2 received 2 g ALC, and 30 patients with HE1 and 30 patients with HE2 received placebo twice a day for 90 d. All patients underwent clinical and laboratory assessments and automated electroencephalogram analysis.
At the end of the study period, the ALC-treated patients in the HE1 group showed significantly better improvement than did the placebo group in mental fatigue score (-1.7 compared with -0.3; P &lt; 0.05), the fatigue severity scale (-6.4 compared with 2.3; P &lt; 0.001), 7-d Physical Activity Recall questionnaire score (17.1 compared with -2.5; P &lt; 0.001), and Short Physical Performance Battery (2.1 compared with 0.2; P &lt; 0.001); the HE2 group showed significantly better improvement in the fatigue severity scale (-8.1 compared with -5.1; P &lt; 0.001) and 6-min walk test (19.9 compared with 2.3; P &lt; 0.05). Significant decreases in NH(4)(+) were observed in both groups (P &lt; 0.001).
Patients with HE treated with ALC showed a decrease in the severity of both mental and physical fatigue and an increase in physical activity. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01223742.
Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C) is a neurodegenerative lysosomal lipid storage disease caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the NPC1 or NPC2 genes. The clinical presentation and evolution of NP-C and the effect of miglustat treatment are described in the largest cohort of patients with adolescent/adult-onset NP-C studied to date.
Observational study based on clinical chart data from adult patients with NP-C (&gt; 18 year old) diagnosed in France between 1990 and 2015. Retrospective data from patients at diagnosis, onset of miglustat therapy (if applicable), and last follow up were analysed.
In France, patients with an adolescent-adult neurological form constituted approximately 25% of all NP-C cases diagnosed during the study period. Forty-seven patients (46 with NP-C1 and one with NP-C2; 53% female) were included. Mean ± SD (range) ages at neurological onset and diagnosis were 23.9 ± 12.5 (8-56) years and 34 ± 13.5 (15-65) years, respectively. At presentation, patients mainly had 1) impaired gait due to cerebellar ataxia and/or dystonia, 2) and/or cognitive/behavioural manifestations, 3) and/or psychotic signs. Initially, almost half of patients had only one of the above three neuro-psychiatric manifestations. Vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, usually occurring without patient complaint, was only detected on careful clinical examination and was recorded in most patients (93%) at the time of diagnosis, several years after neurological onset. Thirty-seven patients (79%) received miglustat, among whom seventeen (46%) continued beyond 2 years (at last follow up) to a maximum of 9.8 years. Eight patients (22%) discontinued treatment early due to side effects (n = 3) or perceived lack of efficacy (n = 5).Miglustat treatment duration correlated significantly with reduced neurological worsening (p &lt; 0.001). Treatment for≥2 years was associated with improved patient survival (p = 0.029). Good responses to miglustat were associated with less severe neurological disability at the start of miglustat treatment (p = 0.02).
The proportion of adolescent/adult-onset NP-C cases diagnosed in France increased 2.5-fold since 2009 compared with the 2000-2008 period due to improved awareness. Adolescent/adult-onset NP-C frequently presented initially with a non-specific isolated neuro-psychiatric manifestation (motor, cognitive or psychotic). Patients with less severe neurological disability responded better to miglustat therapy.
Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti, the principal global vector of dengue viruses, has differences in its susceptibility to dengue virus infection. We compared the global expression of genes in the midguts of Colombian Ae. aegypti dengue-susceptible (Cali-S) and dengue-refractory (Cali-MIB) field derived strains after ingesting either a sugarmeal, a bloodmeal, or a bloodmeal containing dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2). Microarray-based transcriptome analysis among treatments indicated a total of 4725 transcripts with differential expression between the two strains. Eleven genes were selected from different functional groups based on their significant up or down expression levels as well as reports in the literature suggesting they are associated with dengue virus elimination. We measured mRNA abundance of these 11 genes at 0, 8, 24, and 36 h postinfection using quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) to confirm the microarray results and assess any temporal patterns. Four genes were selected (Gram-negative binding protein-GNBP [AAEL009176], Niemann Pick Type-C2-NPC2 [AAEL015136], Keratinocyte lectin [AAEL009842], and Cathepsin-b [AAEL007585]) for knockdown experiments using RNA interference (RNAi) methodology to determine the phenotype (DENV-2 susceptible or refractory). Silencing GNBP, Cathepsin-b and Keratinocyte lectin reduced the percentage of mosquitoes with disseminated virus in the Cali-S strain to 8%, 20%, and 12% respectively compared with 96% in the controls. Silencing of NPC2 increased the percentage of mosquitos with disseminated virus infections in Cali-MIB to 66% compared with 35% in the controls. This study provides insight into genes that may contribute to the Cali-S susceptible and Cali-MIB refractory phenotypes in Ae. aegypti.
Cholesteryl ester (CE) accumulation in macrophages represents a crucial event during foam cell formation, a hallmark of atherogenesis. Here we investigated the role of two previously described CE hydrolases, hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and KIAA1363, in macrophage CE hydrolysis. HSL and KIAA1363 exhibited marked differences in their abilities to hydrolyze CE, triacylglycerol (TG), diacylglycerol (DG), and 2-acetyl monoalkylglycerol ether (AcMAGE), a precursor for biosynthesis of platelet-activating factor (PAF). HSL efficiently cleaved all four substrates, whereas KIAA1363 hydrolyzed only AcMAGE. This contradicts previous studies suggesting that KIAA1363 is a neutral CE hydrolase. Macrophages of KIAA1363(-/-) and wild-type mice exhibited identical neutral CE hydrolase activity, which was almost abolished in tissues and macrophages of HSL(-/-) mice. Conversely, AcMAGE hydrolase activity was diminished in macrophages and some tissues of KIAA1363(-/-) but unchanged in HSL(-/-) mice. CE turnover was unaffected in macrophages lacking KIAA1363 and HSL, whereas cAMP-dependent cholesterol efflux was influenced by HSL but not by KIAA1363. Despite decreased CE hydrolase activities, HSL(-/-) macrophages exhibited CE accumulation similar to wild-type (WT) macrophages. We conclude that additional enzymes must exist that cooperate with HSL to regulate CE levels in macrophages. KIAA1363 affects AcMAGE hydrolase activity but is of minor importance as a direct CE hydrolase in macrophages.
Cancer cells show alterations in metabolism that support malignancy and disease progression. Prominent among these metabolic changes is elevations in neutral ether lipids (NELs). We have previously shown that the hydrolytic enzyme KIAA1363 (or AADACL1) is highly elevated in aggressive cancer cells, where it plays a key role in generating the monoalkylglycerol ether (MAGE) class of NELs. Here, we use activity-based protein profiling-guided medicinal chemistry to discover a highly potent and selective inhibitor of KIAA1363, the carbamate JW480. We show that JW480, and an shRNA probe that targets KIAA1363, reduce MAGEs and impair the migration, invasion, survival, and in vivo tumor growth of human prostate cancer cell lines. These findings indicate that the KIAA1363-MAGE pathway is important for prostate cancer pathogenesis and designate JW480 as a versatile pharmacological probe for disrupting this pro-tumorigenic metabolic pathway.
Activity-based protein profiling (ABPP), the use of active site-directed chemical probes to monitor enzyme function in complex biological systems, is emerging as a powerful post-genomic technology. ABPP probes have been developed for several enzyme classes and have been used to inventory enzyme activities en masse for a range of (patho) physiological processes. By presenting specific examples, we show here that ABPP provides researchers with a distinctive set of chemical tools to embark on the assignment of functions to many of the uncharacterized enzymes that populate eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteomes.
By combining activity-based proteomics and metabolomics, researchers have developed a new systems biology strategy for characterizing enzymes in the context of metabolic networks.
Hundreds, if not thousands, of uncharacterized enzymes currently populate the human proteome. Assembly of these proteins into the metabolic and signaling pathways that govern cell physiology and pathology constitutes a grand experimental challenge. Here, we address this problem by using a multidimensional profiling strategy that combines activity-based proteomics and metabolomics. This approach determined that KIAA1363, an uncharacterized enzyme highly elevated in aggressive cancer cells, serves as a central node in an ether lipid signaling network that bridges platelet-activating factor and lysophosphatidic acid. Biochemical studies confirmed that KIAA1363 regulates this pathway by hydrolyzing the metabolic intermediate 2-acetyl monoalkylglycerol. Inactivation of KIAA1363 disrupted ether lipid metabolism in cancer cells and impaired cell migration and tumor growth in vivo. The integrated molecular profiling method described herein should facilitate the functional annotation of metabolic enzymes in any living system.
Serine hydrolase KIAA1363 is highly expressed in invasive cancer cells and is the major protein in mouse brain diethylphosphorylated by and hydrolyzing low levels of chlorpyrifos oxon (CPO) (the activated metabolite of a major insecticide). It is also the primary CPO-hydrolyzing enzyme in spinal cord, kidney, heart, lung, testis, and muscle but not liver, a pattern of tissue expression confirmed by fluorophosphonate-rhodamine labeling. KIAA1363 gene deletion using homologous recombination reduces CPO binding, hydrolysis, and metabolism 3-29-fold on incubation with brain membranes and homogenates determined with 1 nM [(3)H-ethyl]CPO and the inhibitory potency for residual CPO with butyrylcholinesterase as a biomarker. Studies with knockout mice further show that KIAA1363 partially protects brain AChE and monoacylglycerol lipase from CPO-induced in vivo inhibition. Surprisingly, mouse brain KIAA1363 and AChE are similar in in vitro sensitivity to seven methyl, ethyl, and propyl but not higher alkyl OP insecticides and analogues, prompting structural comparisons of the active sites of KIAA1363 and AChE relative to OP potency and selectivity. Homology modeling based largely on the Archaeoglobus fulgidus esterase crystal structure indicates that KIAA1363 has a catalytic triad of S191, D348, and H378, a GDSAG motif, and an oxyanion hole of H113, G114, G115, and G116. Excellent selectivity for KIAA1363 is achieved on OP structure optimization with long alkyl chain substituents suggesting that KIAA1363 has larger acyl and leaving group pockets than those of AChE. KIAA1363 reactivates faster than AChE presumably due to differences in the uncoupling of the catalytic triad His upon phosphorylation. The structural modeling of KIAA1363 helps us understand OP structure-activity relationships and the toxicological relevance of this detoxifying enzyme.
Organophosphorus (OP) insecticides and chemical warfare agents act primarily by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase. There are many secondary targets for OP toxicants as observed for example with the major insecticide chlorpyrifos and its bioactivated metabolite chlorpyrifos oxon (CPO). Therefore, it was surprising that the predominant mouse brain protein labeled in vitro by [(3)H-ethyl]CPO (1 nM) (designated CPO-binding protein or CPO-BP) is not one of these known OP toxicant targets. CPO-BP is a 50-kDa membrane-bound serine hydrolase measured by derivatization with [(3)H]CPO and SDS/PAGE or filtration binding assay. It appears to undergo rapid diethylphosphorylation by [(3)H]CPO followed by either dephosphorylation and reactivation or aging on loss of an ethyl group. CPO and several other OP toxicants potently inhibit CPO-BP in vivo (i.p., 2 h) (50% inhibition at 2-25 mg/kg) and in vitro (50% inhibition at 8-68 nM). Using three chemical labeling reagents, i.e., [(3)H]CPO and the activity-based proteomic probes fluorophosphonate-biotin and fluorophosphonate-rhodamine, mouse brain CPO-BP is identified as serine hydrolase KIAA1363 of unknown function. Brains from KIAA1363(-/-) mice show greatly reduced levels of CPO labeling and hydrolytic metabolism compared to brains from wild-type mice. KIAA1363 therefore is the principal enzyme for metabolizing low levels of CPO in brain and may play a more general role in detoxification of OP nerve poisons.
Flutamide, an antiandrogen drug, is widely used for the treatment of prostate cancer. The initial metabolic pathways of flutamide are hydroxylation and hydrolysis. It was recently reported that the hydrolyzed product, 4-nitro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenylamine (FLU-1), is further metabolized to N-hydroxy FLU-1, an assumed hepatotoxicant. However, the esterase responsible for the flutamide hydrolysis has not been characterized. In the present study, we found that human arylacetamide deacetylase (AADAC) efficiently hydrolyzed flutamide using recombinant AADAC expressed in COS7 cells. In contrast, carboxylesterase1 (CES1) and CES2, which are responsible for the hydrolysis of many drugs, could not hydrolyze flutamide. AADAC is specifically expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum. Flutamide hydrolase activity was highly detected in human liver microsomes (K(m), 794 +/- 83 microM; V(max), 1.1 +/- 0.0 nmol/min/mg protein), whereas the activity was extremely low in human liver cytosol. The flutamide hydrolase activity in human liver microsomes was strongly inhibited by bis-(p-nitrophenyl)phosphate [corrected], diisopropylphosphorofluoride, and physostigmine sulfate (eserine) but moderately inhibited by sodium fluoride, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and disulfiram. The same inhibition pattern was obtained with the recombinant AADAC. Moreover, human liver and jejunum microsomes showing AADAC expression could hydrolyze flutamide, but human pulmonary and renal microsomes, which do not express AADAC, showed slight activity. In human liver microsomal samples (n = 50), the flutamide hydrolase activities were significantly correlated with the expression levels of AADAC protein (r = 0.66, p &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, these results clearly showed that flutamide is exclusively hydrolyzed by AADAC. AADAC would be an important enzyme responsible for flutamide-induced hepatotoxicity.
Serine hydrolase KIAA1363 is an acetyl monoalkylglycerol ether (AcMAGE) hydrolase involved in tumor cell invasiveness. It is also an organophosphate (OP) insecticide-detoxifying enzyme. The key to understanding these dual properties was the use of KIAA1363 +/+ (wildtype) and -/- (gene deficient) mice to define the role of this enzyme in brain and other tissues and its effectiveness in vivo in reducing OP toxicity. KIAA1363 was the primary AcMAGE hydrolase in brain, lung, heart and kidney and was highly sensitive to inactivation by chlorpyrifos oxon (CPO) (IC50 2 nM) [the bioactivated metabolite of the major insecticide chlorpyrifos (CPF)]. Although there was no difference in hydrolysis product monoalkylglycerol ether (MAGE) levels in +/+ and -/- mouse brains in vivo, isopropyl dodecylfluorophosphonate (30 mg/kg) and CPF (100 mg/kg) resulted in 23-51% decrease in brain MAGE levels consistent with inhibition of AcMAGE hydrolase activity. On incubating +/+ and -/- brain membranes with AcMAGE and cytidine-5'-diphosphocholine, the absence of KIAA1363 activity dramatically increased de novo formation of platelet-activating factor (PAF) and lyso-PAF, signifying that metabolically-stabilized AcMAGE can be converted to this bioactive lipid in brain. On considering detoxification, KIAA1363 -/- mice were significantly more sensitive than +/+ mice to ip-administered CPF (100 mg/kg) and parathion (10 mg/kg) with increased tremoring and mortality that correlated for CPF with greater brain acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Docking AcMAGE and CPO in a KIAA1363 active site model showed similar positioning of their acetyl and trichloropyridinyl moieties, respectively. This study establishes the relevance of KIAA1363 in ether lipid metabolism and OP detoxification.
Sterol homeostasis in eukaryotic cells relies on the reciprocal interconversion of free sterols and steryl esters. Here we report the identification of a novel reversible sterol modification in yeast, the sterol acetylation/deacetylation cycle. Sterol acetylation requires the acetyltransferase ATF2, whereas deacetylation requires SAY1, a membrane-anchored deacetylase with a putative active site in the ER lumen. Lack of SAY1 results in the secretion of acetylated sterols into the culture medium, indicating that the substrate specificity of SAY1 determines whether acetylated sterols are secreted from the cells or whether they are deacetylated and retained. Consistent with this proposition, we find that acetylation and export of the steroid hormone precursor pregnenolone depends on its acetylation by ATF2, but is independent of SAY1-mediated deacetylation. Cells lacking Say1 or Atf2 are sensitive against the plant-derived allylbenzene eugenol and both Say1 and Atf2 affect pregnenolone toxicity, indicating that lipid acetylation acts as a detoxification pathway. The fact that homologues of SAY1 are present in the mammalian genome and functionally substitute for SAY1 in yeast indicates that part of this pathway has been evolutionarily conserved.
The development of potent and selective inhibitors of the biosynthesis of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) via DAG lipases (DAGL) α and β is just starting to be considered as a novel and promising source of pharmaceuticals for the treatment of disorders that might benefit from a reduction in endocannabinoid tone, such as hyperphagia in obese subjects.
Three new fluorophosphonate compounds O-7458, O-7459 and O-7460 were synthesized and characterized in various enzymatic assays. The effects of O-7460 on high-fat diet intake were tested in mice.
Of the new compounds, O-7460 exhibited the highest potency (IC₅₀ = 690 nM) against the human recombinant DAGLα, and selectivity (IC₅₀ &gt; 10 μM) towards COS-7 cell and human monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), and rat brain fatty acid amide hydrolase. Competitive activity-based protein profiling confirmed that O-7460 inhibits mouse brain MAGL only at concentrations ≥ 10 μM, and showed that this compound has only one major 'off-target', that is, the serine hydrolase KIAA1363. O-7460 did not exhibit measurable affinity for human recombinant CB₁ or CB₂ cannabinoid receptors (Ki &gt; 10 μM). In mouse neuroblastoma N18TG2 cells stimulated with ionomycin, O-7460 (10 μM) reduced 2-AG levels. When administered to mice, O-7460 dose-dependently (0-12 mg·kg⁻¹, i.p.) inhibited the intake of a high-fat diet over a 14 h observation period, and, subsequently, slightly but significantly reduced body weight.
O-7460 might be considered a useful pharmacological tool to investigate further the role played by 2-AG both in vitro and in vivo under physiological as well as pathological conditions.
KIAA1363 is a serine hydrolase whose activity has been shown to be positively associated with tumor cell invasiveness. Thus, inhibitors of KIAA1363 represent a novel targeted therapy approach towards cancer. AX11890 ((1-bromo-2-naphthyl) N,N-dimethylcarbamate) was identified as a KIAA1363 inhibitor with an IC(50) value of 1.2 μM and was shown using ESI-MS to carbamylate the catalytic residue Ser(191). SAR studies explored both substitution of the 1-bromo group and derivatization of the 6-position. Activity-based protein profiling demonstrated AX13057 inhibited tumor-localized KIAA1363 in SK-OV-3 xenograft-bearing mice.
Several controversies exist related to the molecular identity and subcellular localization of the enzyme catalyzing macrophage cholesteryl ester hydrolysis. Some of these issues have been reviewed earlier and this review summarizes new developments that describe effects of overexpression or gene ablation. The main objective is to highlight the disagreement between lack of gene expression and incomplete abolition of macrophage cholesteryl ester hydrolytic activity and to emphasize the importance of redundancy.
New information resulting from the continuing characterization of the various cholesteryl ester hydrolases (hormone-sensitive lipase, HSL; cholesteryl ester hydrolase, CEH; and KIAA1363/NCEH1) is reviewed. Whereas CEH overexpression leads to beneficial effects such as decreased inflammation, improved glucose tolerance/insulin sensitivity, and attenuation of atherosclerotic lesion progression, deficiency/ablation of HSL or KIAA1363/NCEH1 results in incomplete loss of macrophage cholesteryl ester hydrolysis/turnover. New paradigms challenging the classical view of cytoplasmic cholesteryl ester hydrolysis and reverse cholesterol transport are also presented.
The observed beneficial effects of CEH overexpression identify macrophage cholesteryl ester hydrolysis as an important therapeutic target and future studies will determine whether similar effects are obtained with overexpression of HSL or KIAA1363/NCEH1. It is imperative that, for clinical benefit, mechanisms to enhance endogenous cholesteryl ester hydrolase(s) are established.
The first NIR KIAA1363-targeting probe, NB-AX, specifically and instantly featured an "off-on" switch upon gradual addition of KIAA1363 over all kinds of other biomolecules, and its detection limit was initially calculated to be 0.58 μg mL-1 (3δ/k). The probe was also able to be used in ultrafast distinguishing of breast cancer cells from normal cells in fluorescence imaging and applied in tissue imaging and tumor imaging in vivo.
Oxons are bioactive metabolites of organophosphorus insecticides (OPs) that covalently inactivate serine hydrolases. KIAA1363 is one of the most abundant serine hydrolases in mouse brain. Although the physiological consequences related to the inhibition of KIAA1363 due to environmental exposures to OPs are poorly understood, the enzyme was previously shown to have a role in the detoxification of oxons. Here, we overexpressed human KIAA1363 and CES1 in COS7 cells and compared the potency of inhibition (IC50s, 15 min) of KIAA1363 and CES1 by chlorpyrifos oxon (CPO), paraoxon (PO), and methyl paraoxon (MPO). The order of potency was CPO &gt; PO &gt; MPO for both enzymes. We also determined the bimolecular rate constants (kinact/Ki) for reactions of CPO and PO with KIAA1363 and CES1. KIAA1363 and CES1 were inactivated by CPO at comparable rates (4.4 × 10(6) s(-1) M(-1) and 6.7 × 10(6) s(-1) M(-1), respectively), whereas PO inactivated both enzymes at slower rates (0.4 × 10(6) s(-1) M(-1) and 1.5 × 10(6) s(-1) M(-1), respectively). Finally, the reactivation rate of KIAA1363 following inhibition by CPO was evaluated. Together, the results define the kinetics of inhibition of KIAA1363 by active metabolites of agrochemicals and indicate that KIAA1363 is highly sensitive to inhibition by these compounds. 
Inflammation is a hallmark of many human diseases, including pain, arthritis, atherosclerosis, obesity and diabetes, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. Although there are several successfully marketed small molecules anti-inflammatory drugs such as cyclooxygenase inhibitors and glucocorticoids, many of these compounds are also associated with various adverse cardiovascular or immunosuppressive side effects. Thus, identifying novel anti-inflammatory small molecules and their targets is critical for developing safer and more effective next-generation treatment strategies for inflammatory diseases. Here, we have conducted a chemical genetics screen to identify small molecules that suppress the release of the inflammatory cytokine TNFα from stimulated macrophages. We have used an enzyme class-directed chemical library for our screening efforts to facilitate subsequent target identification using activity-based protein profiling (ABPP). Using this strategy, we have found that KIAA1363 is a novel target for lowering key pro-inflammatory cytokines through affecting key ether lipid metabolism pathways. Our study highlights the application of combining chemical genetics with chemoproteomic and metabolomic approaches toward identifying and characterizing anti-inflammatory smal molecules and their targets. 
Activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) is emerging as a game-changing tool for drug discovery, target validation, and basic biology. In this issue, Chang et al. (2011) report the ABPP-facilitated discovery of JW480, a highly selective potent and orally bioavailable inhibitor of monoalkylglycerol ether hydrolase KIAA1363 that dramatically impairs in vivo growth of human prostate cancer cell lines.
Lipases play key roles in nearly all cells and organisms. Potent and selective inhibitors help to elucidate their physiological functions and associated metabolic pathways. Organophosphorus (OP) compounds are best known for their anticholinesterase properties but selectivity for lipases and other targets can also be achieved through structural optimization. This review considers several lipid systems in brain modulated by highly OP-sensitive lipases. Neuropathy target esterase (NTE) hydrolyzes lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) as a preferred substrate. Gene deletion of NTE in mice is embryo lethal and the heterozygotes are hyperactive. NTE is very sensitive in vitro and in vivo to direct-acting OP delayed neurotoxicants and the related NTE-related esterase (NTE-R) is also inhibited in vivo. KIAA1363 hydrolyzes acetyl monoalkylglycerol ether (AcMAGE) of the platelet-activating factor (PAF) de novo biosynthetic pathway and is a marker of cancer cell invasiveness. It is also a detoxifying enzyme that hydrolyzes chlorpyrifos oxon (CPO) and some other potent insecticide metabolites. Monoacylglycerol lipase and fatty acid amide hydrolase regulate endocannabinoid levels with roles in motility, pain and memory. Inhibition of these enzymes in mice by OPs, such as isopropyl dodecylfluorophosphonate (IDFP), leads to dramatic elevation of brain endocannabinoids and distinct cannabinoid-dependent behavior. Hormone-sensitive lipase that hydrolyzes cholesteryl esters and diacylglycerols is a newly recognized in vivo CPO- and IDFP-target in brain. The OP chemotype can therefore be used in proteomic and metabolomic studies to further elucidate the biological function and toxicological significance of lipases in lipid metabolism. Only the first steps have been taken to achieve appropriate selective action for OP therapeutic agents.
Lipases sensitive to organophosphorus (OP) inhibitors play critical roles in cell regulation, nutrition, and disease, but little is known on the toxicological aspects in mammals. To help fill this gap, six lipases or lipase-like proteins are assayed for OP sensitivity in vitro under standard conditions (25 degrees C, 15 min incubation). Postheparin serum lipase, lipoprotein lipase (LPL) (two sources), pancreatic lipase, monoacylglycerol (MAG) lipase, cholesterol esterase, and KIAA1363 are considered with 32 OP pesticides and related compounds. Postheparin lipolytic activity in rat serum is inhibited by 14 OPs, including chlorpyrifos oxon (IC50 50-97 nM). LPL (bovine milk and Pseudomonas) generally is less inhibited by the insecticides or activated oxons, but the milk enzyme is very sensitive to six fluorophosphonates and benzodioxaphosphorin oxides (IC50 7-20 nM). Porcine pancreatic lipase is very sensitive to dioctyl 4-nitrophenyl phosphate (IC50 8 nM), MAG lipase of mouse brain to O-4-nitrophenyl methyldodecylphosphinate (IC50 0.6 nM), and cholesterol esterase (bovine pancreas) to all of the classes of OPs tested (IC50 &lt; 10 nM for 17 compounds). KIAA1363 is sensitive to numerous OPs, including two O-4-nitrophenyl compounds (IC50 3-4 nM). In an overview, inhibition of 28 serine hydrolases (including lipases) by eight OPs (chlorpyrifos oxon, diazoxon, paraoxon, dichlorvos, and four nonpesticides) showed that brain acetylcholinesterase is usually less sensitive than butyrylcholinesterase, liver esterase, cholesterol esterase, and KIAA1363. In general, each lipase (like each serine hydrolase) has a different spectrum of OP sensitivity, and individual OPs have unique ranking of potency for inhibition of serine hydrolases.
By primarily measuring changes in transcript and protein abundance, conventional genomics and proteomics methods may fail to detect significant posttranslational events that regulate protein activity and, ultimately, cell behavior. To address these limitations, activity-based proteomic technologies that measure dynamics in protein function on a global scale would be of particular value. Here, we describe the application of a chemical proteomics strategy to quantitatively compare enzyme activities across a panel of human breast and melanoma cancer cell lines. A global analysis of the activity, subcellular distribution, and glycosylation state for the serine hydrolase superfamily resulted in the identification of a cluster of proteases, lipases, and esterases that distinguished cancer lines based on tissue of origin. Strikingly, nearly all of these enzyme activities were down-regulated in the most invasive cancer lines examined, which instead up-regulated a distinct set of secreted and membrane-associated enzyme activities. These invasiveness-associated enzymes included urokinase, a secreted serine protease with a recognized role in tumor progression, and a membrane-associated hydrolase KIAA1363, for which no previous link to cancer had been made. Collectively, these results suggest that invasive cancer cells share discrete proteomic signatures that are more reflective of their biological phenotype than cellular heritage, highlighting that a common set of enzymes may support the progression of tumors from a variety of origins and thus represent attractive targets for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.
The profiles of serine hydrolases in human and mouse macrophages are similar yet different. For instance, human macrophages express high levels of carboxylesterase 1 (CES1), whereas mouse macrophages have minimal amounts of the orthologous murine CES1. On the other hand, macrophages from both species exhibit limited expression of the canonical 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) hydrolytic enzyme, MAGL. Our previous study showed CES1 was partly responsible for the hydrolysis of 2-AG (50%) and prostaglandin glyceryl esters (PG-Gs) (80-95%) in human THP1 monocytes and macrophages. However, MAGL and other endocannabinoid hydrolases, FAAH, ABHD6, and ABHD12, did not have a role because of limited expression or no expression. Thus, another enzyme was hypothesized to be responsible for the remaining 2-AG hydrolysis activity following chemical inhibition and immunodepletion of CES1 (previous study) or CES1 gene knockdown (this study). Here we identified two candidate serine hydrolases in THP1 cell lysates by activity-based protein profiling (ABPP)-MUDPIT and Western blotting: cathepsin G and palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1). Both proteins exhibited electrophoretic properties similar to those of a serine hydrolase in THP1 cells detected by gel-based ABPP at 31-32 kDa; however, only PPT1 exhibited lipolytic activity and hydrolyzed 2-AG in vitro. Interestingly, PPT1 was strongly expressed in THP1 cells but was significantly less reactive than cathepsin G toward the activity-based probe, fluorophosphonate-biotin. KIAA1363, another serine hydrolase, was also identified in THP1 cells but did not have significant lipolytic activity. On the basis of chemoproteomic profiling, immunodepletion studies, and chemical inhibitor profiles, we estimated that PPT1 contributed 32-40% of 2-AG hydrolysis activity in the THP1 cell line. In addition, pure recombinant PPT1 catalyzed the hydrolysis of 2-AG, PGE2-G, and PGF2α-G, although the catalytic efficiency of hydrolysis of 2-AG by PPT1 was ~10-fold lower than that of CES1. PPT1 was also insensitive to several chemical inhibitors that potently inhibit CES1, such as organophosphate poisons and JZL184. This is the first report to document the expression of PPT1 in a human monocyte and macrophage cell line and to show PPT1 can hydrolyze the natural substrates 2-AG and PG-Gs. These findings suggest that PPT1 may participate in endocannabinoid metabolism within specific cellular contexts and highlights the functional redundancy often exhibited by enzymes involved in lipid metabolism.
A series of N-acyl pyrazoles was examined as candidate serine hydrolase inhibitors in which the active site acylating reactivity and the leaving group ability of the pyrazole could be tuned not only through the nature of the acyl group (reactivity: amide &gt; carbamate &gt; urea), but also through pyrazole C4 substitution with electron-withdrawing or electron-donating substituents. Their impact on enzyme inhibitory activity displayed pronounced effects with the activity improving substantially as one alters both the nature of the reacting carbonyl group (urea &gt; carbamate &gt; amide) and the pyrazole C4 substituent (CN &gt; H &gt; Me). It was further demonstrated that the acyl chain of the N-acyl pyrazole ureas can be used to tailor the potency and selectivity of the inhibitor class to a targeted serine hydrolase. Thus, elaboration of the acyl chain of pyrazole-based ureas provided remarkably potent, irreversible inhibitors of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH, apparent Ki = 100-200 pM), dual inhibitors of FAAH and monoacylglycerol hydrolase (MGLL), or selective inhibitors of MGLL (IC50 = 10-20 nM) while simultaneously minimizing off-target activity (e.g., ABHD6 and KIAA1363).
Regional National Weather Service (NWS) heat advisory criteria in New York State (NYS) were based on frequency of heat events estimated by sparse monitoring data. These may not accurately reflect temperatures at which specific health risks occur in large geographic regions. The objectives of the study were to use spatially resolved temperature data to characterize health risks related to summertime heat exposure and estimate the temperatures at which excessive risk of heat-related adverse health occurs in NYS. We also evaluated the need to adjust current heat advisory threshold and messaging based on threshold temperatures of multiple health outcomes.
We assessed the effect of multi-day lag exposure for maximum near-surface air temperature (Tmax) and maximum Heat Index derived from the gridded National Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) reanalysis dataset on emergency department (ED) visits/ hospitalizations for heat stress, dehydration, acute kidney failure (AKF) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) using a case-crossover analysis during summers of 2008-2012. We assessed effect modification using interaction terms and stratified analysis. Thresholds were estimated using piecewise spline regression.
We observed an increased risk of heat stress (Risk ratio (RR) = 1.366, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.347, 1.386) and dehydration (RR = 1.024, 95% CI: 1.021, 1.028) for every 1 °C increase in Tmax on the day of exposure. The highest risk for AKF (RR = 1.017, 95% CI: 1.014, 1.021) and CVD (RR = 1.001, 95% CI: 1.000, 1.002) were at lag 1 and 4 respectively. The increased risk of heat-health effects persists up to 6 days. Rural areas of NYS are at as high a risk of heat-health effects as urban areas. Heat-health risks start increasing at temperatures much lower than the current NWS criteria.
Reanalysis data provide refined exposure-response functions for health research, in areas with sparse monitor observations. Based on this research, rural areas in NYS had similar risk for health effects of heat. Heat advisories in New York City (NYC) had been reviewed and lowered previously. As such, the current NWS heat advisory threshold was lowered for the upstate region of New York and surrounding areas. Enhanced outreach materials were also developed and disseminated to local health departments and the public.
Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disease of lipid metabolism, which leads to early coronary heart disease. Mutations in LDLR, APOB and PCSK9 can be detected in 80% of definite FH (DFH) patients. This study aimed to identify novel FH-causing genetic variants in patients with no detectable mutation.
Exomes of 125 unrelated DFH patients were sequenced, as part of the UK10K project. First, analysis of known FH genes identified 23 LDLR and two APOB mutations, and patients with explained causes of FH were excluded from further analysis. Second, common and rare variants in genes associated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis were examined. There was no clear rare variant association in LDL-C GWAS hits; however, there were 29 patients with a high LDL-C SNP score suggestive of polygenic hypercholesterolaemia. Finally, a gene-based burden test for an excess of rare (frequency &lt;0.005) or novel variants in cases versus 1926 controls was performed, with variants with an unlikely functional effect (intronic, synonymous) filtered out.
No major novel locus for FH was detected, with no gene having a functional variant in more than three patients; however, an excess of novel variants was found in 18 genes, of which the strongest candidates included CH25H and INSIG2 (p&lt;4.3×10(-4) and p&lt;3.7×10(-3), respectively). This suggests that the genetic cause of FH in these unexplained cases is likely to be very heterogeneous, which complicates the diagnostic and novel gene discovery process.
While glucocorticoids and the liganded glucocorticoid receptor (GR) have a well-established role in the maintenance of differentiation and suppression of apoptosis in breast tissue, the involvement of unliganded GR in cellular processes is less clear. Our previous studies implicated unliganded GR as a positive regulator of the BRCA1 tumour suppressor gene in the absence of glucocorticoid hormone, which suggested it could play a similar role in the regulation of other genes.
An shRNA vector directed against GR was used to create mouse mammary cell lines with depleted endogenous levels of this receptor in order to further characterize the role of GR in breast cells. An expression microarray screen for targets of unliganded GR was performed using our GR-depleted cell lines maintained in the absence of glucocorticoids. Candidate genes positively regulated by unliganded GR were identified, classified by Gene Ontology and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, and validated using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and dual luciferase expression assays were conducted to further investigate the mechanism through which unliganded GR regulates these genes.
Expression microarray analysis revealed 260 targets negatively regulated and 343 targets positively regulated by unliganded GR. A number of the positively regulated targets were involved in pro-apoptotic networks, possibly opposing the activity of liganded GR targets. Validation and further analysis of five candidates from the microarray indicated that two of these, Hsd11b1 and Ch25h, were regulated by unliganded GR in a manner similar to Brca1 during glucocorticoid treatment. Furthermore, GR was shown to interact directly with and upregulate the Ch25h promoter in the absence, but not the presence, of hydrocortisone (HC), confirming our previously described model of gene regulation by unliganded GR.
This work presents the first identification of targets of unliganded GR. We propose that the balance between targets of liganded and unliganded GR signaling is responsible for controlling differentiation and apoptosis, respectively, and suggest that gene regulation by unliganded GR may represent a mechanism for reducing the risk of breast tumourigenesis by the elimination of abnormal cells.
Breast cancer risk of recurrence is known to span 20 years, yet existing prognostic signatures are best at predicting early recurrences (≤ 5 years). There is a critical need to identify those patients at risk of late-relapse (&gt;5 years), in order to select potential candidates for further treatment and to identify molecular targets for such treatment.
A total of 252 breast primary tumors were selected at the Netherlands Cancer Institute from a retrospective series of ER+, HER2- breast cancer patients with a follow-up of at least 10 years. Gene expression analysis was performed using Agilent 4x44K microarrays. Patients were classified in 3 groups: no relapse (M0); relapse before 5 years (M0-5) or after 5 years (M5-15). We assessed the correlation of clinico-pathological variables with late Distant Metastases (DM). We divided the patient series into a training set of untreated patients (n = 140) and a test set of treated patients (n = 112), to investigate whether a gene-signature or single genes could be identified for predicting late DM. Pathway level late DM correlates were identified using PARADIGM and DAVID.
Of the clinico-pathologic variables tested, only lymph node status associated with late DM. A 241-gene signature developed on the NKI training set was able to classify M5-15 patients in the test set with a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 33% (AUC 0.654). This signature showed enrichment in genes involved in immune response and extracellular matrix. An alternative analysis of individual genes identified CH25H as an independent predictor of distant metastasis in our patient series.
We identified a gene signature for late metastasis in breast cancer. Our data are consistent with a model in which suppressed anti-tumoral immunity enables dormant tumor cells to re-enter the cell cycle to form metastases in response to extrinsic events in the microenvironment.
Oxysterols are pleiotropic messengers interacting with multiple receptor systems. One of the cognate receptors for oxysterols is EBI2, a G protein-coupled receptor highly expressed in the cells of the immune system. Here we discuss the receptor's role in the adapted immunity and inflammation as well as the receptor's expression and function in the CNS with the focus on astrocytes. We also discuss expression and signalling of oxysterol-producing enzymes such as CH25H and CYP7B1 in the CNS and the immune system. These steps will help to elucidate a possible role for this pathway in the physiology of the central and peripheral nervous system and its possible link to human disease.
Oxysterols produced by CH25H during cholesterol metabolism have been shown to play an important role in the immune response. In this study we report the genetic characterization of CH25H in patients diagnosed with multiples sclerosis (MS) or neuromyelitis optica (NMO), for the identification of genetic variants affecting disease susceptibility and course. Exome analysis in 212 MS and 14 NMO patients identified a rare CH25H p.Q17H mutation in two NMO patients of Asian ancestry. In addition, association analysis of common CH25H variants identified a nominally significant association with MS patients presenting a clinical course consistent with primary progressive disease. 
The host-pathogen interactions between the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and Ostreid herpesvirus type 1 (OsHV-1) are poorly characterised. Herpesviruses are a group of large, DNA viruses that are known to encode gene products that subvert their host's antiviral response. It is likely that OsHV-1 has also evolved similar strategies as its genome encodes genes with high homology to C. gigas inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) and an interferon-stimulated gene (termed CH25H). The first objective of this study was to simultaneously investigate the expression of C. gigas and OsHV-1 genes that share high sequence homology during an acute infection. Comparison of apoptosis-related genes revealed that components of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway (TNF) were induced in response to OsHV-1 infection, but we failed to observe evidence of apoptosis using a combination of biochemical and molecular assays. IAPs encoded by OsHV-1 were highly expressed during the acute stage of infection and may explain why we didn't observe evidence of apoptosis. However, C. gigas must have an alternative mechanism to apoptosis for clearing OsHV-1 from infected gill cells as we observed a reduction in viral DNA between 27 and 54 h post-infection. The reduction of viral DNA in C. gigas gill cells occurred after the up-regulation of interferon-stimulated genes (viperin, PKR, ADAR). In a second objective, we manipulated the host's anti-viral response by injecting C. gigas with a small dose of poly I:C at the time of OsHV-1 infection. This small dose of poly I:C was unable to induce transcription of known antiviral effectors (ISGs), but these oysters were still capable of inhibiting OsHV-1 replication. This result suggests dsRNA induces an anti-viral response that is additional to the IFN-like pathway.
RNA-Seq was used to unveil the transcriptional profile of DF-1 cells at the early stage of caIBDV infection. Total RNAs were extracted from virus-infected cells at 0, 6 and 12 hpi. RNA-Seq datasets of respective samples mapped to 56.5-57.6% of isoforms in the reference genome Galgal4.73. At 6 hpi, 23 isoforms underwent an elevated expression, while 128 isoforms were up-regulated and 5 were down-regulated at 12 hpi in the virus-infected group. Besides, 10 isoforms were exclusively expressed in the virus-infected cells. Though no significant change was detected in cytokine and interferon expression levels at the first 12 hours of infection, modulations of the upstream regulators were observed. In addition to the reported regulatory factors including EIF2AK2, MX, OAS*A, GBP7 and IFIT, IBDV infection also triggered a IFIT5-IRF1/3-RSAD5 pathway in the DF-1 cells which potentially restricted the viral replication cycle in the early infection stage. Over-expression of LIPA and CH25H, together with the suppression of STARD4, LSS and AACS genes implied a modulation of membrane fluidity and lipid raft arrangement in the infected cells. Alternative splicing of the EFR3 homolog A gene was also through to be involved in the lipid membrane regulation, and these cumulative responses projected an inhibition of viral endocytosis. Recognition of viral RNA genomes and intermediates was presumably enhanced by the elevated levels of IFIH1, DHX58 and TRIM25 genes which possess properties on detecting viral dsRNA. On the other hand, the caIBDV arrested the host's apoptotic process by inducing the expression of apoptosis inhibitors including NFKBIA/Z, TNFAIP2/3 and ITA at the first 12 hours of infection. In conclusion, the differential expression landscape demonstrated with RNA-Seq provides a comprehensive picture on the molecular interactions between host cells and virus at the early stage of infection. 
Experimental data show that cholesterol can modulate central processes in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The epidemiological link between elevated plasma cholesterol at midlife and increased risk for AD and the possibility that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzym A reductase inhibitors (statins) may be protective against AD support a role of cholesterol metabolism in AD and have rendered it a potential therapeutic target in the treatment and prevention of the disease. The strong association of AD and AD endophenotypes with the APOE gene provides a genetic link between AD and cholesterol metabolism, because the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is the most prevalent cholesterol transport protein in the central nervous system. Against this background several other genes with a role in cholesterol metabolism have been investigated for association with AD. In this review a compilation of genes related to cholesterol based on the information of the AmiGo gene ontology database is matched with the AlzGene database of AD candidate genes. 56 out of 149 (37.6%) genes with a relation to cholesterol metabolism have been investigated for association with AD. Given that only 660 out of about 23,000 (2.9%) genes have been assessed in hypothesis-driven candidate gene studies on AD, the cholesterol metabolic pathway is strongly represented among these genes. Among 34 cholesterol-related genes for which association with AD has been described APOE, CH25H, CLU, LDLR, SORL1 outstand with positive meta-analyses. However, it is unclear, if their association with AD is mediated by cholesterol-related mechanisms or by more specific direct effects of the respective proteins on Abeta metabolism.
We selected twenty genes from the "Top Results" list on the AlzGene database website and assessed their association with risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a large, genome-wide association study (using 526 SNPs from 2,032 AD cases and 5,328 controls) performed in France. The APOE, CLU, PICALM, and CR1 loci were excluded, since they had already been extensively analyzed. Ten genes/loci (TFAM, SORL1, CHRNB2, SORCS1, DAPK1, MTHFR, GWA 14q32.13, BDNF, NEDD9, and CH25H) showed weak nominal association with AD risk, in line with previous studies. In the remaining ten genes/loci (TNK1, ACE, CST3, IL1B, hCG2039140, PRNP, GAB2, LOC651924, IL1A, and TF), no single nucleotide polymorphisms were associated in our dataset. Of the genes showing nominal association in our cohorts, TFAM and CHRNB2 appear particularly interesting and warrant further genetic and functional follow-up analyses.
The genetics of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is heterogeneous and remains only ill-defined. We have recently created a freely available and continuously updated online database (AlzGene; http://www.alzgene.org ) for which we collect all published genetic association studies in AD and perform systematic meta-analyses on all polymorphisms with sufficient genotype data. In this study, we tested 27 genes (ACE, BDNF, CH25H, CHRNB2, CST3, CTSD, DAPK1, GALP, hCG2039140, IL1B, LMNA, LOC439999, LOC651924, MAPT, MTHFR, MYH13, PCK1, PGBD1, PRNP, PSEN1, SORCS1, SORL1, TF, TFAM, TNK1, GWA_14q32.13, and GWA_7p15.2), all showing significant association with AD risk in the AlzGene meta-analyses, in a large collection of family-based samples comprised of 4,180 subjects from over 1,300 pedigrees. Overall, we observe significant association with risk for AD and polymorphisms in ACE, CHRNB2, TF, and an as yet uncharacterized locus on chromosome 7p15.2 [rs1859849]. For all four loci, the association was observed with the same alleles as in the AlzGene meta-analyses. The convergence of case-control and family-based findings suggests that these loci currently represent the most promising AD gene candidates. Further fine-mapping and functional analyses are warranted to elucidate the potential biochemical mechanisms and epidemiological relevance of these genes.
Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder, with a complex etiology. APOE is the only confirmed susceptibility gene for LOAD. Others remain yet to be found. Evidence from linkage studies suggests that a gene (or genes) conferring susceptibility for LOAD resides on chromosome 10. We studied 23 positional/functional candidate genes from our linkage region on chromosome 10 (APBB1IP, ALOX5, AD037, SLC18A3, DKK1, ZWINT, ANK3, UBE2D1, CDC2, SIRT1, JDP1, NET7, SUPV3L1, NEN3, SAR1, SGPL1, SEC24C, CAMK2G, PP3CB, SNCG, CH25H, PLCE1, ANXV111) in the MRC genetic resource for LOAD. These candidates were screened for sequence polymorphisms in a sample of 14 LOAD subjects and detected polymorphisms tested for association with LOAD in a three-stage design involving two stages of genotyping pooled DNA samples followed by a third stage in which markers showing evidence for association in the first stages were subjected to individual genotyping. One hundred and twenty polymorphisms were identified and tested in stage 1 (4 case + 4 control pools totaling 366 case and 366 control individuals). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showing evidence of association with LOAD were then studied in stage 2 (8 case + 4 control pools totaling 1,001 case and 1,001 control individuals). Five SNPs, in four genes, showed evidence for association (P &lt; 0.1) at stage 2 and were individually genotyped in the complete dataset, comprising 1,160 LOAD cases and 1,389 normal controls. Two SNPs in SGPL1 demonstrated marginal evidence of association, with uncorrected P values of 0.042 and 0.056, suggesting that variation in SGPL1 may confer susceptibility to LOAD.
Abnormal structural alterations termed remodeling, including fibrosis and alveolar wall destruction, are important features of the pathophysiology of chronic airway diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) is enzymatically produced by cholesterol 25-hydorxylase (CH25H) in macrophages and is reported to be involved in the formation of arteriosclerosis. We previously demonstrated that the expression of CH25H and production of 25HC were increased in the lungs of COPD. However, the role of 25-HC in lung tissue remodeling is unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of 25-HC on fibroblast-mediated tissue remodeling using human fetal lung fibroblasts (HFL-1) in vitro. 25-HC significantly augmented α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) (P&lt;0.001) and collagen I (P&lt;0.001) expression in HFL-1. 25-HC also significantly enhanced the release and activation of matrix metallaoproteinase (MMP)-2 (P&lt;0.001) and MMP-9 (P&lt;0.001) without any significant effect on the production of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2. 25-HC stimulated transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 production (P&lt;0.01) and a neutralizing anti-TGF-β antibody restored these 25-HC-augmented pro-fibrotic responses. 25-HC significantly promoted the translocation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB p65 into the nuclei (P&lt;0.01), but not phospholylated-c-jun, a complex of activator protein-1. Pharmacological inhibition of NF-κB restored the 25-HC-augmented pro-fibrotic responses and TGF-β1 release. These results suggest that 25-HC could contribute to fibroblast-mediated lung tissue remodeling by promoting myofibroblast differentiation and the excessive release of extracellular matrix protein and MMPs via an NF-κB-TGF-β dependent pathway.
To investigate the relationship between amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and candidate gene polymorphisms in a Chinese population, 116 aMCI patients and 93 normal controls were recruited. Multi-dimensional neuropsychological tests were used to extensively assess the cognitive functions of the subjects. MassARRAY and iPLEX systems were used to measure candidate single nucleotide polymorohisms (SNPs) and analyse allelic, genotypic or haplotypic distributions. The scores of the neuropsychological tests were significantly lower for the aMCI patients than for the normal controls. The distributions of SNPs relating to the amyloid cascade hypothesis (TOMM40 rs157581 G and TOMM40 rs2075650 G), to the cholesterol metabolism hypothesis (ApoE rs429358 C, LDLR rs11668477 G and CH25H rs7091822 T and PLAU rs2227564 CT) and to the tau hypothesis (MAPT/STH rs242562 GG) in aMCI were significantly different than those in normal controls. Interactions were also found in aMCI amongst SNPs in LDLR rs11668477, PLAU rs2227564, and TOMM40 rs157581, between SNPs in TOMM40 rs157580 and BACE2 rs9975138. The study suggests that aMCI is characterised by memory impairment and associated with SNPs in three systems relating to the pathogenesis of AD--those of the amyloid cascade, tau and cholesterol metabolism pathways. Interactions were also observed between genes in the amyloid pathway and between the amyloid and cholesterol pathways.
High density SNP arrays can be used to identify DNA copy number changes in tumors such as homozygous deletions of tumor suppressor genes and focal amplifications of oncogenes. Illumina Human CNV370 Bead chip arrays were used to assess the genome for unbalanced chromosomal events occurring in 39 cell lines derived from stage III metastatic melanomas. A number of genes previously recognized to have an important role in the development and progression of melanoma were identified including homozygous deletions of CDKN2A (13 of 39 samples), CDKN2B (10 of 39), PTEN (3 of 39), PTPRD (3 of 39), TP53 (1 of 39), and amplifications of CCND1 (2 of 39), MITF (2 of 39), MDM2 (1 of 39), and NRAS (1 of 39). In addition, a number of focal homozygous deletions potentially targeting novel melanoma tumor suppressor genes were identified. Because of their likely functional significance for melanoma progression, FAS, CH25H, BMPR1A, ACTA2, and TFG were investigated in a larger cohort of melanomas through sequencing. Nonsynonymous mutations were identified in BMPR1A (1 of 43), ACTA2 (3 of 43), and TFG (5 of 103). A number of potentially important mutation events occurred in TFG including the identification of a mini mutation "hotspot" at amino acid residue 380 (P380S and P380L) and the presence of multiple mutations in two melanomas. Mutations in TFG may have important clinical relevance for current therapeutic strategies to treat metastatic melanoma.
To examine the effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery with and without laparoscopic removal of omental fat (omentectomy) on the temporal gene expression profiles of skeletal muscle.
Previously reported were the whole-body metabolic effects of a randomized, single-blinded study in patients receiving RYGB surgery stratified to receive or not receive omentectomy. In this follow up study we report on changes in skeletal muscle gene expression in a subset of 21 patients, for whom biopsies were collected preoperatively and at either 6 months or 12 months postoperatively.
RNA isolated from skeletal muscle biopsies of 21 subjects (8 without omentectomy and 13 with omentectomy) taken before RYGB or at 6 and 12 months postoperatively were subjected to gene expression profiling via Exon 1.0 S/T Array and Taqman Low Density Array. Robust Multichip Analysis and gene enrichment data analysis revealed 84 genes with at least a 4-fold expression difference after surgery. At 6 and 12 months the RYGB with omentectomy group displayed a greater reduction in the expression of genes associated with skeletal muscle inflammation (ANKRD1, CDR1, CH25H, CXCL2, CX3CR1, IL8, LBP, NFIL3, SELE, SOCS3, TNFAIP3, and ZFP36) relative to the RYGB non-omentectomy group. Expressions of IL6 and CCL2 were decreased at all postoperative time points. There was differential expression of genes driving protein turnover (IGFN1, FBXW10) in both groups over time and increased expression of PAAF1 in the non-omentectomy group at 12 months. Evidence for the activation of skeletal muscle satellite cells was inferred from the up-regulation of HOXC10. The elevated post-operative expression of 22 small nucleolar RNAs and the decreased expression of the transcription factors JUNB, FOS, FOSB, ATF3 MYC, EGR1 as well as the orphan nuclear receptors NR4A1, NR4A2, NR4A3 suggest dramatic reorganizations at both the cellular and genetic levels.
These data indicate that RYGB reduces skeletal muscle inflammation, and removal of omental fat further amplifies this response.

The migrating schistosomulum is an important stage of the schistosome lifecycle and represents a key target for elimination of infection by natural and vaccine-induced host immune responses. To gain a better understanding of how schistosomes initiate a primary host immune response we have characterised the host lung response to migrating Schistosoma japonicum schistosomula using a combination of histopathology, microarray analysis and real-time PCR. Our findings indicate that the early pulmonary response to these migrating larvae is characteristic of innate inflammation and wound healing. This response is associated with significant up-regulation of several genes with immunoregulatory function including Ch25h, Hmox1 and Retnla which may act to control the nature or magnitude of the inflammatory response to the migrating schistosomula, promoting both parasite and host survival. These findings contribute to our understanding of host-parasite interactions associated with schistosome and, especially, S. japonicum infection, and may aid the future design of novel vaccines that target the lung stage schistosomulum.
The association of eosinophils with inflammation and tissue remodeling is at least partially due to their release of toxic granule proteins and other mediators, including cytokines. Tissue remodeling and consequent functional defects are affected by activity of connective tissue fibroblasts. Exaggerated fibroblast activation, accumulation and change of phenotype may lead to fibrosis and loss of tissue function. So far, little information has been reported on how eosinophils affect inflammation and tissue remodeling via the activation of fibroblasts. We have recently shown that eosinophil activation with IL-3 led to a robust eosinophil degranulation on immunoglobin-G (IgG) coated plates. Thus, in the present study, we analyze the effects of IL-3-activated eosinophil degranulation products on primary human lung fibroblasts (HLF) using whole transcriptome sequencing.
Conditioned media was obtained from eosinophils that were pre-activated with IL-3 or IL-5 and subsequently cultured for 6 h on IgG to induce degranulation. This conditioned media was added on human lung fibroblasts (HLF) for 24 h and the cell lysates were then subjected to whole transcriptome sequencing to identify global changes in gene expression. Differentially expressed genes were analyzed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), and validated by qPCR.
In HLF, the expression level of 300 genes was changed by conditioned media from IL-3-activated eosinophils compared to control fibroblast cultures. Among these 300 genes, the expression level of 35 genes coding for known proteins was upregulated by IL-3- versus IL-5-pre-activated eosinophils. Of the 35 upregulated genes, IPA identified C3, CH25H, CXCL1, CXCL8, CYP1A1, ICAM1, IL6 and UCN2 as having downstream functions on inflammation, tissue remodeling and lipid synthesis. This analysis combined with previous RNA sequencing analyses of eosinophils suggest IL-1ß, OSM and TNFSF12 as potential upstream regulators of fibroblasts.
This study has identified several novel pro-inflammatory and pro-remodeling mediators produced by fibroblasts in response to activated eosinophils. These findings may have significant implications on the role of eosinophil/fibroblast interactions in eosinophilic disorders.
Dysfunction of microglia is known to play an important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we investigated the role of RIPK1 in microglia mediating the pathogenesis of AD. RIPK1 is highly expressed by microglial cells in human AD brains. Using the amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1) transgenic mouse model, we found that inhibition of RIPK1, using both pharmacological and genetic means, reduced amyloid burden, the levels of inflammatory cytokines, and memory deficits. Furthermore, inhibition of RIPK1 promoted microglial degradation of Aβ in vitro. We characterized the transcriptional profiles of adult microglia from APP/PS1 mice and identified a role for RIPK1 in regulating the microglial expression of CH25H and Cst7, a marker for disease-associated microglia (DAM), which encodes an endosomal/lysosomal cathepsin inhibitor named Cystatin F. We present evidence that RIPK1-mediated induction of Cst7 leads to an impairment in the lysosomal pathway. These data suggest that RIPK1 may mediate a critical checkpoint in the transition to the DAM state. Together, our study highlights a non-cell death mechanism by which the activation of RIPK1 mediates the induction of a DAM phenotype, including an inflammatory response and a reduction in phagocytic activity, and connects RIPK1-mediated transcription in microglia to the etiology of AD. Our results support that RIPK1 is an important therapeutic target for the treatment of AD.
The rs17070145-T variant of the WWC1 gene, coding for the KIBRA protein, has been associated with both increased episodic memory performance and lowered risk for late onset Alzheimer's disease, although the mechanism behind this protective effect has not been completely elucidated. To achieve a better understanding of the pathways modulated by rs17070145 and its associated functional variant(s), we used laser capture microdissection (LCM) and RNA-sequencing to investigate the effect of rs17070145 genotypes on whole transcriptome expression in the human hippocampus (HP) of 22 neuropathologically normal individuals, with a specific focus on the dentate gyrus (DG) and at the pyramidal cells (PC) of CA1 and CA3 sub-regions. Differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data within the HP based on the rs17070145 genotype revealed an overexpression of genes involved in the MAPK signaling pathway, potentially driven by the T/T genotype. The most important contribution comes from genes dysregulated within the DG region. Other genes significantly dysregulated, and not involved in the MAPK pathway (Adj P &lt; 0.01 and Fold Change &gt; |1.00|) were: RSPO4 (HP); ARC, DUSP5, DNAJB5, EGR4, PPP1R15A, WBP11P1, EGR1, GADD45B (DG); CH25H, HSPA1A, HSPA1B, TNFSF9, and NPAS4 (PC). Several evidences suggested that the MAPK signaling pathway is linked with memory and learning processes. In non-neuronal cells, the KIBRA protein is phosphorylated by ERK1/2 (involved in the MAPK signaling) in cells as well as in vitro. Several of the other dysregulated genes are involved in memory and learning processes, as well as in Alzheimer's Disease. In conclusion, our results suggest that the effect of the WWC1 rs17070145 polymorphism on memory performance and Alzheimer's disease might be due to a differential regulation of the MAPK signaling, a key pathway involved in memory and learning processes.
This study investigated whether gene expression levels of key modulators of the oxysterol signalling pathway modify the prognosis of patients with oestrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast carcinomas via interaction with endocrine therapy.
The prognosis of patients with ER+ breast carcinoma depends on several factors. Previous studies have suggested that some oxygenated forms of cholesterol (oxysterols) bind to oestrogen receptor and anti-oestrogen binding site which may deregulate cholesterol homoeostasis and influence effect of therapy.
The expression levels of 70 oxysterol pathway genes were evaluated in a test set of breast carcinomas differing in ER expression. The genes differentially expressed in ER+ tumours were assessed in a comprehensive set of ER+ tumours to evaluate their clinical significance.
A total of 193 primary patients with breast carcinoma were included.
The transcript levels were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
The expression levels of 23 genes were found to be specifically dysregulated in ER+ tumours compared to ER- tumours of the test set. The expression levels of ABCG2, CYP7B1, CYP24A1, CYP39A1 and CH25H genes were found to be strongly associated with disease stage; however, none of the gene expression levels were associated with disease-free survival in patients treated with endocrine therapy.
The expression of a number of oxysterol pathway genes is significantly modulated by ER expression and associated with the clinical stage of patients. However, the expression of oxysterol pathway genes was not found to modify the prognosis of ER+ patients with breast carcinoma treated with endocrine therapy.
Arrival of encephalitogenic T cells at inflammatory foci represents a critical step in development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model for multiple sclerosis. EBI2 and its ligand, 7α,25-OHC, direct immune cell localization in secondary lymphoid organs. CH25H and CYP7B1 hydroxylate cholesterol to 7α,25-OHC. During EAE, we found increased expression of CH25H by microglia and CYP7B1 by CNS-infiltrating immune cells elevating the ligand concentration in the CNS. Two critical pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-23 (IL-23) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), maintained expression of EBI2 in differentiating Th17 cells. In line with this, EBI2 enhanced early migration of encephalitogenic T cells into the CNS in a transfer EAE model. Nonetheless, EBI2 was dispensable in active EAE. Human Th17 cells do also express EBI2, and EBI2 expressing cells are abundant within multiple sclerosis (MS) white matter lesions. These findings implicate EBI2 as a mediator of CNS autoimmunity and describe mechanistically its contribution to the migration of autoreactive T cells into inflamed organs.
Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) infection can cause tumors and immunosuppression. Endogenous viruses integrate into host genomes and can recombine with exogenous avian leukosis virus (ALV). In this study, we analyzed the interaction of endogenous retrovirus 21 (ev21) with the ALV-J in late-feathering Chinese yellow chicken. Two ALV-J strains M180 and K243 were isolated from late-feathering and fast-feathering Chinese yellow chicken flocks, respectively. The env gene of the two strains showed 94.2-94.8% nucleotide identity with reference ALV-J strains. Compared with the env gene and the LTR of ev21 and M180, the nucleotide identity of LTR was 69.7% and env gene was 58.4%, respectively, especially the amino acid identity of env gene as low as 14.2%. Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the env gene and the 3'LTR showed that M180 was closely related to ALV-J, and was located in a distinct group with ev21 in the phylogenetic tree. Using co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), we next demonstrate that the envelope protein of ev21 does not interact with the M180 envelope protein. We further show that the envelope protein of ev21 cannot activate ALV-J LTR promoter activity using luciferase-reporter assays. qPCR and western blot analysis revealed that envelope protein of endogenous ev21 can facilitate the expression of PKR at 6h post ALV-J infection (hpi) and facilitate the expression of ISG12 and CH25H at 24 hpi. However, the expression of the env gene of M180 strain was not significantly at 6 and 24 hpi. We conclude that there is no evidence of recombination between endogenous retrovirus ev21 and ALV-J strain M180 in late-feathering Chinese yellow chicken, and envelope protein of ev21 can affect the expression of host ISGs, but appears not to influence the replication of ALV-J strain M180. This is the first report of interaction among the endogenous retrovirus ev21, ALV-J and the late-feathering chicken.
Oxysterol derived from cholesterol metabolism is involved in the inflammatory activation, and consequently in development of major chronic diseases. Multiple cytokines have been found to induce the expression of cholesterol metabolism-related enzymes. Several studies have shown that the protein level of cholesterol-25-hydroxylase (CH25H) is remarkably increased in response to injury of central nervous system (CNS), but little is known about the mechanisms of cytokine-induced expression of CH25H in specific cell types, and the resultant effects. In the present study, we demonstrated that ch25h expression was significantly upregulated in the astrocytes of rat injured spinal cord, in parallel with those of MIF. Administration of MIF inhibitor 4-IPP in the lesion sites attenuated injury-induced ch25h expression. MIF facilitated ch25h expression of astrocytes through interaction with CD74 membrane receptor, which in turn promoted production of chemokines, as identified by transcriptome profiles. MIF-induced release of oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) from astrocytes affects cell migration, but inhibited cell viability in dose-dependent manner, suggesting that MIF aggravates progressive neuropathology through regulation of cholesterol metabolism following CNS injury. These results have provided a novel mechanism and a potential therapeutic strategy for injured CNS.
Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a severe respiratory disease that leads to huge economic losses in the pig industry throughout the world. Although there are several vaccines available, the protective efficacy is limited. Therefore, new control strategies to prevent PRRS virus (PRRSV) infection are urgently required. We have previously reported that CH25H and 25HC can significantly inhibit the replication of PRRSV by preventing viral entry. In the present study, we found that 25HC with a low IC50 value significantly decreased the replication of different PRRSV strains, and increased the production of IL-1β and IL-8 in porcine primary alveolar macrophages and the lung tissue. In pigs challenged with highly pathogenic PRRSV, treatment with 25HC was associated with an obvious reduction in the level of viremia and viral load in lung samples and nasal swabs, as well as decreased lung injury and an increased survival rate. These findings suggest that 25HC could be a promising antiviral drug against PRRSV in the future.
It is not clear how hepatitis B virus (HBV) modulates host immunity during chronic infection. In addition to the key mediators of inflammatory response in viral infection, monocytes also express a high-level IFN-stimulated gene, CH25H, upon response to IFN-α exerting an antiviral effect. In this study, the mechanism by which HBV manipulates IFN signaling in human monocytes was investigated. We observed that monocytes from chronic hepatitis B patients express lower levels of IFN signaling/stimulated genes and higher levels of inflammatory cytokines compared with healthy donors. HBV induces monocyte production of inflammatory cytokines via TLR2/MyD88/NF-κB signaling and STAT1-Ser727 phosphorylation and inhibits IFN-α-induced stat1, stat2, and ch25h expression through the inhibition of STAT1-Tyr701 phosphorylation and in an IL-10-dependent, partially autocrine manner. Further, we found that enhancement of STAT1 activity with a small molecule (2-NP) rescued HBV-mediated inhibition of IFN signaling and counteracted the induction of inflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, HBV contributes to the monocyte inflammatory response but inhibits their IFN-α/β responsiveness to impair antiviral innate immunity. These effects are mediated via differential phosphorylation of Tyr701 and Ser727 of STAT1.
Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) infection can cause tumors and immunosuppression in infected chickens. Macrophages play a central role in host defense against invading pathogens. In this study, we discovered an interesting phenomenon: ALV-J replication is weakened from 3 hours post-infection (hpi) to 36 hpi, which was verified using Western blotting and RT-PCR. To further investigate the interaction between ALV-J and macrophages, transcriptome analysis was performed to analyze the host genes' function in chicken primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). Compared to the uninfected control, 624 up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEG) and 341 down-regulated DEG at 3 hpi, and 174 up-regulated DEG and 87 down-regulated DEG at 36 hpi were identified in chicken MDM, respectively. ALV-J infection induced strong innate immune responses in chicken MDM at 3 hpi, instead of 36 hpi, according to the analysis results of Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway. Importantly, the host factors, such as up-regulated MIP-3α, IL-1β, iNOS, K60, IRG1, CH25H, NFKBIZ, lysozyme and OASL were involved in the host defense response during the course of ALV-J infection. On the contrary, up-regulated EX-FABP, IL4I1, COX-2, NFKBIA, TNFAIP3 and the Jak STAT pathway inhibitors including CISH, SOCS1 and SOCS3 are beneficial to ALV-J survival in chicken macrophages. We speculated that ALV-J tropism for macrophages helps to establish a latent infection in chicken MDM from 6 to 36 hpi. The present study provides a comprehensive view of the interactions between macrophages and ALV-J. It suggests the mechanisms of defense of chicken macrophages against ALV-J invasion and how ALV-J escape the host innate immune responses.
Numerous genetic evidence has pointed out that variations in cholesterol-related genes may be associated with an Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. We aimed to investigate the association between polymorphisms in several cholesterol-related genes [APOA5 (rs662799), APOC1 (rs11568822), APOD (rs1568565), CH25H (rs13500), LDLR (rs5930), SORL1 (rs2282649)] and AD in a cohort of Turkish patients. The study group consisted of 257 AD patients (mean age: 75.9 years ± 10.4) and 414 controls (mean age: 62.2 years ± 13.1). Genotyping was performed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction using hydrolysis probes. Our results showed that the 'TT' genotype of CH25H rs13500 polymorphism was significantly more frequent in the AD group (p &lt; 0.001) and individuals carrying the CH25H 'T' allele had an increased risk for AD (OR 3.07, 95% CI 2.13-4.44, p = 2.20e-09) independently from age, gender and APOE ε4 allele. Moreover, this risk was excessively increased (OR 14.04, 95% CI 6.99-28.23, p = 9.78e-14) in the presence of APOE ε4 allele. The 'ins/ins' genotype of APOC1 rs11568822 was significantly more frequent in the AD group compared to controls (p = 1.95e-08). However, this increased AD risk in 'ins/ins' carriers was found to be dependent on their APOE ε4 carrier status. No significant associations were found in allele and genotype distributions of APOA5, APOD, LDLR and SORL1 gene polymorphisms. Our results suggest that the association between APOC1 'ins/ins' genotype and AD risk can be explained by linkage disequilibrium with the APOE locus. CH25H rs13500 polymorphism is associated with an AD risk in the Turkish population and CH25H might have a role in the pathogenesis of AD together with, and independently from APOE.
Currently, research on genome-scale epigenetic modifications for studying the pathogenesis of lung cancer is lacking. Aberrant DNA methylation, as the most common and important modification in epigenetics, is an important means of regulating genomic function and can be used as a biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). In this paper, methylation information and gene expression data from patients with LUSC were extracted from the TCGA database. Univariate and multivariate COX analyses were used to screen abnormally methylated genes related to the prognosis of LUSC. The relationship between key DNA methylation sites and the transcriptional expression of LUSC-related genes was explored. A prognostic risk model constructed by four abnormally methylated genes (VAX1, CH25H, AdCyAP1, and Irx1) was used to predict the prognosis of LUSC patients. Also, the methylation levels of the key gene IRX1 are significantly correlated with the prognosis and correlated with the methylation of the site cg09232937 and cg10530883. This study is based on high-throughput data mining and provides an effective bioinformatics basis for further understanding the pathogenesis and prognosis of LUSC, which has important theoretical significance for follow-up studies on LUSC.
Dihydroxycholesterols such as 7α,25-dihydroxysterols (7α,25-OHC) and 7α,27-OHC are generated from cholesterol by the enzymes CH25H, CYP7B1 and CYP27A1 in steady state but also in the context of inflammation. The G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 2 (EBI2), also known as GPR183, senses these oxysterols and induces chemotactic migration of immune cells towards higher concentrations of these ligands. We recently showed that these ligands are upregulated in the CNS in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for multiple sclerosis and that EBI2 enhanced early infiltration of encephalitogenic T cells into the CNS. In this short-review we discuss the role of dihydroxysterol-sensing by immune cells in neuroinflammation.
The development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) pathogenesis remains unclear, but emerging evidence supports a crucial role for inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) in disease progression. Mechanisms underlying iBALT generation, particularly during chronic CS exposure, remain to be defined. Oxysterol metabolism of cholesterol is crucial to immune cell localization in secondary lymphoid tissue. Here, we demonstrate that oxysterols also critically regulate iBALT generation and the immune pathogenesis of COPD In both COPD patients and cigarette smoke (CS)-exposed mice, we identified significantly upregulated CH25H and CYP7B1 expression in airway epithelial cells, regulating CS-induced B-cell migration and iBALT formation. Mice deficient in CH25H or the oxysterol receptor EBI2 exhibited decreased iBALT and subsequent CS-induced emphysema. Further, inhibition of the oxysterol pathway using clotrimazole resolved iBALT formation and attenuated CS-induced emphysema in vivo therapeutically. Collectively, our studies are the first to mechanistically interrogate oxysterol-dependent iBALT formation in the pathogenesis of COPD, and identify a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of COPD and potentially other diseases driven by the generation of tertiary lymphoid organs.
We fed rats noodle (N) -diet containing 30 wt.% instant noodle with a 26% fat-to-energy ratio for 30 days (N-group). Compared with rats that were fed the same amount of nutrients (C-group), the N-group showed lower liver triacylglycerol levels and higher fecal cholesterol levels. We then analyzed transcriptome of the hypothalamic-pituitary (HP), the liver and the white adipose tissue (WAT). Thyroid stimulating hormone (Tshb), and its partner, glycoprotein hormone genes were up-regulated in the HP of N-group. Sterol regulatory element binding transcription factors were activated in the liver of N-group, while an up-regulation of the angiogenic signal occurred in the WAT of N-group. N-group showed higher urine noradrenaline (NA) level suggesting that these tissue signals are regulated by NA and Tshb. The N-diet contains 0.326 wt.% glutamate, 0.00236 wt.% 6-shogaol and Maillard reaction products. Our results suggest that these ingredients may affect lipid homeostasis via the HP axis.
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress triggers or amplifies inflammatory signals and cytokine production in immune cells. Upon the resolution of ER stress, the inducible phosphatase 1 cofactor GADD34 promotes the dephosphorylation of the initiation factor eIF2α, thereby enabling protein translation to resume. Several aminoguanidine compounds, such as guanabenz, perturb the eIF2α phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle and protect different cell or tissue types from protein misfolding and degeneration. We investigated how pharmacological interference with the eIF2α pathway could be beneficial to treat autoinflammatory diseases dependent on proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferons (IFNs), the production of which is regulated by GADD34 in dendritic cells (DCs). In mouse and human DCs and B cells, guanabenz prevented the activation of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) by CpG oligodeoxynucleotides or DNA-immunoglobulin complexes in endosomes. In vivo, guanabenz protected mice from CpG oligonucleotide-dependent cytokine shock and decreased autoimmune symptom severity in a chemically induced model of systemic lupus erythematosus. However, we found that guanabenz exerted its inhibitory effect independently of GADD34 activity on eIF2α and instead decreased the abundance of CH25H, a cholesterol hydroxylase linked to antiviral immunity. Our results therefore suggest that guanabenz and similar compounds could be used to treat type I IFN-dependent pathologies and that CH25H could be a therapeutic target to control these diseases.
Hyperpolarized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to detect real-time in vivo tumor metabolism. Dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization method increases polarization of 13C-labeled molecules, typically [1-13C]pyruvate, which can be injected into an animal during MRI scanning. Increased polarization leads to a higher observed signal, which allows for the detection and imaging of the transfer of 13C-label between the injected marker molecule, pyruvate, and its metabolic products, most importantly lactate. This information can be used to assess the metabolic status of the tumor, for example, during therapy. Here, the basic methodology and data analysis for a preclinical hyperpolarized pyruvate experiment are described.
Multi-center preclinical studies can facilitate the discovery of biomarkers of antiepileptogenesis and thus facilitate the diagnosis and treatment development of patients at risk of developing post-traumatic epilepsy. However, these studies are often limited by the difficulty in harmonizing experimental protocols between laboratories. Here, we assess whether the production of traumatic brain injury (TBI) using the lateral fluid-percussion injury (FPI) in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (12 weeks at the time of injury) was harmonized between three laboratories - located in the University of Eastern Finland (UEF), Monash University in Melbourne, Australia (Melbourne) and The University of California, Los Angeles, USA (UCLA). These laboratories are part of the international multicenter-based project, the Epilepsy Bioinformatics Study for Antiepileptogenesis Therapy (EpiBioS4Rx). Lateral FPI was induced in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. The success of methodological harmonization was assessed by performing inter-site comparison of injury parameters including duration of anesthesia during surgery, impact pressure, post-impact transient apnea, post-impact seizure-like behavior, acute mortality (&lt;72 h post-injury), time to self-right after the impact, and severity of the injury (assessed with the neuroscore). The data was collected using Common Data Elements and Case Report Forms. The acute mortality was 15% (UEF), 50% (Melbourne) and 57% (UCLA) (p &lt; 0.001). The sites differed in the duration of anesthesia, the shortest being at UEF &lt; Melbourne &lt; UCLA (p &lt; 0.001). The impact pressure used also differed between the sites, the highest being in UEF &gt; Melbourne &gt; UCLA (p &lt; 0.001). The impact pressure associated with the severity of the functional deficits (low neuroscore) (P &lt; 0.05) only at UEF, but not at any of the other sites. Additionally, the sites differed in the duration of post-impact transient apnea (p &lt; 0.001) and time to self-right (P &lt; 0.001), the highest values in both parameters was registered in Melbourne. Post-impact seizure-like behavior was observed in 51% (UEF), 25% (Melbourne) and 2% (UCLA) of rats (p &lt; 0.001). Despite the differences in means when all sites were compared there was significant overlap in injury parameters between the sites. The data reflects the technical difficulties in the production of lateral FPI across multiple sites. On the other hand, the data can be used to model the heterogeneity in human cohorts with closed-head injury. Our animal cohort will provide a good starting point to investigate the factors associated with epileptogenesis after lateral FPI.
Enzymatic and non-enzymatic oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids gives rise to reactive species that covalently modify nucleophilic residues within redox sensitive protein sensors in a process called lipoxidation. This triggers adaptive signaling pathways that ultimately lead to increased resistance to stress. In this graphical review, we will provide an overview of pathways affected by protein lipoxidation and the key signaling proteins being altered, focusing on the KEAP1-NRF2 and heat shock response pathways. We review the mechanisms by which lipid peroxidation products can serve as second messengers and evoke cellular responses via covalent modification of key sensors of altered cellular environment, ultimately leading to adaptation to stress.
Consumption of foods of insect origin is encouraged, since insect consumption is seen as one of the responses to the environmental impact of meat production. This study examines the attitude (A), subjective norm (SN), perceived behavioral control (PC), and food neophobia (FN) toward the consumption of foods of insect origin, as well as the conditions for eating insect-based foods among vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores.
The data was obtained by using an online survey and convenience sampling (n = 567, of whom omnivores represented 74%, vegans 5%, and non-vegan vegetarians 22%).
The three dietary groups exhibited significantly different intention (I) to eat foods of insect origin. Vegans held the most rigid negative attitude (A), and their subjective norm (SN) to eat insects was weaker compared to that of omnivores (p &lt; 0.001) and non-vegan vegetarians (p &lt; 0.001). Vegans' perceived behavioral control (PC) over their eating of insects was stronger compared to that of omnivores (p &lt; 0.001) and non-vegan vegetarians p &lt; 0.001), and they were more neophobic than omnivores (p &lt; 0.001) and non-vegan vegetarians (p &lt; 0.001). Non-vegan vegetarians held the most positive attitude toward eating insects, and both non-vegan vegetarians and omnivores thought that insect consumption is wise and offers a solution to the world's nutrition problems. In contrast, vegans regarded insect consumption as immoral and irresponsible.
Vegans' weak intention, negative attitude, and low willingness to eat insects in the future exhibit their different dietarian identity compared to that of omnivores and non-vegan vegetarians.
Articular cartilage constituents (collagen, proteoglycans, fluid) are significantly altered during osteoarthritis (OA). A fibril-reinforced poroelastic (FRPE) material model can separate the contribution of each constituent on the mechanical response of cartilage. Yet, these properties and their OA related alterations are not known for human tibial cartilage. To answer this gap in the knowledge, we characterized the FRPE as well as elastic and viscoelastic properties of healthy and osteoarthritic human tibial cartilage. Tibial osteochondral explants (n = 27) harvested from 7 cadavers were mechanically tested in indentation followed by a quantification of elastic, viscoelastic and FRPE properties. Then they were histopathologically OARSI graded for the severity of OA. FRPE modeling revealed that non-fibrillar matrix modulus was higher in the healthy group compared to the early OA (p = 0.003) and advanced OA (p &lt; 0.001) groups. The initial fibril network modulus was also higher in the healthy group compared to the early OA (p = 0.009) and advanced OA (p &lt; 0.001) groups. The permeability correlated with the OARSI grade (p = 0.002, r = 0.56). For the first time, the FRPE properties were characterized for human tibial cartilage. This knowledge is crucial to improve the accuracy of computational knee joint models.
There are several methods for studying metal-contaminated freshwater sediments, but more information is needed on which methods to include in ecological risk assessment. In this study, we compliment the traditional Sediment Quality Triad (SQT) approach - including information on chemistry, toxicity and ecological status - with studies on metal bioavailability and metal body residues in local organisms. We studied four mining-affected boreal lakes in Finland by conducting chemical analyses of sediment and water, toxicity tests (L. variegatus, V. fischeri, C. riparius, L. stagnalis), and analysis of benthic organism community structure. In addition, we studied the relationships between metal loading, toxicity, metal bioavailability, and metal body residues in the field-collected biota. Chemistry and benthic organism community structures show adverse effects in those lakes, where the metal concentrations are the highest. However, toxicity was connected to low sediment pH during the experiment, rather than to high metal concentrations. Toxicity was observed in 4 out of 6 toxicity tests including growth test with L. variegatus, bulk sediment test with V. fischeri, and the L. stagnalis toxicity test. The C. riparius test did not show toxicity. Metal body residues in biota were not high enough to induce adverse effects (0.1-4.1 mg Cu/kg fw, 0.01-0.3 mg Ni/kg fw, 2.9-26.7 mg Zn/kg fw and 0.01-0.7 mg As/kg fw). Chemical analyses, metal bioavailability assessment and benthic community structures survey revealed adverse effects in the sediments, where metal concentrations are highest (Lake SJ and Lake KS). Standard toxicity tests were not suitable for studying acid, sulfide-rich sediments and, therefore, benthic structure study and chemical analyses are believed to give more reliable results of the ecological status of these sediments.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) aim to identify associations of genetic variations such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to a specific trait or a disease. Identifying common themes such as pathways, biological processes and diseases associations is needed to further explore and interpret these results. Varanto is a novel web tool for annotating, visualizing and analyzing human genetic variations using diverse data sources. Varanto can be used to query a set of input variations, retrieve their associated variation and gene level annotations, perform annotation enrichment analysis and visualize the results.
Varanto web app is developed with R and implemented as Shiny app with PostgreSQL database and is freely available at http://bioinformatics.uef.fi/varanto. Source code for the tool is available at https://github.com/oqe/varanto.
Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is frequently associated with concomitant amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology.
To compare the [11C]PIB PET uptake in the patients with suspected iNPH to Aβ and hyperphosphorylated-tau (HPτ) in the right frontal cortical biopsy, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ, the response to a CSF shunt, and the final clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Patients (n = 21) from Kuopio NPH Registry (http://www.uef.fi/nph) with intraventricular pressure monitoring, immunostaining for Aβ and HPτ in the right frontal cortical biopsies, and a Mini-Mental State Examination and a Clinical Dementia Rating underwent [11C]PIB PET. Aβ, total tau, and Pτ181 were measured by ELISA from the ventricular (n = 15) and the lumbar (n = 9) CSF. Response to the shunt was seen in 13 out of the 15 shunted patients. AD was diagnosed in 8 patients during a median follow-up of 6 years (mean 7.3±2.4 years, range 3-1).
[11C]PIB uptake in the right frontal cortex (ρ= 0.60, p &lt; 0.01) and the combined neocortical [11C]PIB uptake score (ρ= 0.61, p &lt; 0.01) were associated with a higher Aβ load in the right frontal cortical biopsy. Excluding one (1/15) outlier, [11C]PIB uptake was also associated with the ventricular CSF Aβ (ρ= -0.58, p = 0.03).
The findings show that [11C]PIB PET can reliably detect simultaneous amyloid pathology among the iNPH patients. Further studies will show whether amyloid PET could predict a clinical response to the shunt operation. In addition, the presence of Aβ pathology in the patients with iNPH might also warrant treatment with current AD drugs.
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a complex eye disease in which decline in autophagy leads to the accumulation of sequestosome 1/p62 (SQSTM1/p62)-labeled waste material inside the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, and the condition results in activation of the inflammasome signaling and IL-1β secretion. Here, we have studied the role of SQSTM1/p62 in the production of IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 in the presence or absence of IL-1β. SQSTM1/p62 was either overexpressed or silenced in ARPE-19 cells, which were then exposed to IL-1β. Alternatively, bafilomycin A was used to demonstrate the functional decline of autophagy with increased SQSTM1/p62 levels. The protein concentration of SQSTM1/p62 was measured using the western blot technique, and interleukin levels were determined by ELISA. In IL-1β-loaded RPE cells, SQSTM1/p62 depletion and overexpression increased the production of MCP-1 and IL-8, respectively. Neither knock-down nor overexpression of SQSTM1/p62 induced the release of IL-6. Our data suggest that SQSTM1/p62 is a significant factor in inflammatory responses, especially following the inflammasome activation.
The Epilepsy Bioinformatics Study for Antiepileptogenic Therapy (EpiBioS4Rx) is a NINDS funded Center-Without-Walls international study aimed at preventing epileptogenesis after traumatic brain injury (TBI). One objective of EpiBioS4Rx relates to preclinical biomarker discovery for post-traumatic epilepsy. In order to perform a statistically appropriately powered biomarker discovery study, EpiBioS4Rx has made a rigorous attempt to harmonize the preclinical procedures performed at the three EpiBioS4Rx centers, located in Finland, Australia, and the USA. Moreover, we have also performed a rigorous interim analysis of the success of procedural harmonization, which is reported in this virtual special issue. The analysis included harmonization of the production of animal model, blood sampling, electroencephalogram analyses (seizures, high-frequency oscillations) and magnetic resonance imaging analysis. Based on lessons learned, we propose a 3-stage protocol to facilitate the success of preclinical multicenter studies: preparation ⇨ testing ⇨ multicenter study. The need of funding for preparation and testing phases, which precede the actual multicenter study and are necessary for its success, should be taken into account in the design of funding schemes.
Human-derived hepatic cell lines are a valuable alternative to primary hepatocytes for drug metabolism, transport and toxicity studies. However, their relevance for investigations of drug-drug and drug-organic anion (e.g., bile acid, steroid hormone) interactions at the transporter level remains to be established. The aim of the present study was to determine the suitability of the Huh7 cell line for transporter-dependent experiments. Huh7 cells were cultured for 1 to 4 weeks and subsequently were analyzed for protein expression, localization and activity of solute carrier (SLC) and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters involved in organic anion transport using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy, immunocytochemistry, and model substrates [3H]taurocholate (TCA), [3H]dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and 5(6)-carboxy-2',7'-dichlorofluorescein (CDF) diacetate. The extended 4-week culture resulted in a phenotype resembling primary hepatocytes and differentiated HepaRG cells: cuboidal hepatocyte-like cells with elongated bile canaliculi-like structures were surrounded by epithelium-like cells. Protein expression of OSTα, OSTβ and OATP1B3 increased over time. Moreover, the uptake of the SLC probe substrate DHEAS was higher in 4-week than in 1-week Huh7 cultures. NTCP, OATP1B1, BSEP and MRP3 were barely or not detectable in Huh7 cells. OATP2B1, MRP2 and MRP4 protein expression remained at similar levels over the four weeks of culture. The activity of MRP2 and the formation of bile canaliculi-like structures were confirmed by accumulation of CDF in the intercellular compartments. Results indicate that along with morphological maturation, transporters responsible for alternative bile acid secretion pathways are expressed and active in long-term cultures of Huh7 cells, suggesting that differentiated Huh7 cells may be suitable for studying the function and regulation of these organic anion transporters.
Molecular mechanisms linking fish and vegetable oil intakes to their healthy metabolic effects may involve attenuation of inflammation. Our primary aim was to examine in a randomized controlled setting whether diets enriched in fatty fish (FF), lean fish (LF) or ALA-rich camelina sativa oil (CSO) differ in their effects on the mRNA expression response of selected inflammation-related genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) in subjects with impaired fasting glucose.
Samples from 72 participants randomized to one of the following 12-week intervention groups, FF (n = 19), LF (n = 19), CSO (n = 17) or a control group (n = 17), were available for the PBMC study. For SAT, 39 samples (n = 8, n = 10, n = 9, n = 12, respectively) were available. The mRNA expression was measured at baseline and 12 weeks by TaqMan® Low Density Array.
In PBMCs, LF decreased ICAM1 mRNA expression (P &lt; 0.05), which was different (P = 0.06, Bonferroni correction) from the observed increase in the FF group (P &lt; 0.05). Also, compared to the control group, LF decreased ICAM1 mRNA expression (P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, the change in ICAM1 mRNA expression correlated positively with the intake of FF (P &lt; 0.05) and negatively with the intake of LF (P &lt; 0.05), independently of study group. A diet enriched in CSO, a rich source of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), decreased PBMC IFNG mRNA expression (P &lt; 0.01). The intake of CSO in the CSO group, but not the increase in plasma ALA proportions, correlated inversely with the IFNG mRNA expression in PBMCs (P = 0.08). In SAT, when compared with the control group, the effect of FF on decreasing IL1RN mRNA expression was significant (P &lt; 0.03).
We propose that CSO intake may partly exert its benefits through immuno-inflammatory molecular regulation in PBMCs, while modulation of ICAM1 expression, an endothelial/vascular-related gene, may be more dependent on the type of fish consumed.
Correction for respiratory motion in myocardial perfusion imaging requires sorting of emission data into respiratory windows where the intra-window motion is assumed to be negligible. However, it is unclear how much intra-window motion is acceptable. The aim of this study was to determine an optimal value of intra-window residual motion.
A custom-designed cardiac phantom was created and imaged with a standard dual-detector SPECT/CT system using Tc-99m as the radionuclide. Projection images were generated from the list-mode data simulating respiratory motion blur of several magnitudes from 0 (stationary phantom) to 20 mm. Cardiac defect contrasts in six anatomically different locations, as well as myocardial perfusion of apex, anterior, inferior, septal and lateral walls, were measured at each motion magnitude. Stationary phantom data were compared to motion-blurred data. Two physicians viewed the images and evaluated differences in cardiac defect visibility and myocardial perfusion.
Significant associations were observed between myocardial perfusion in the anterior and inferior walls and respiratory motion. Defect contrasts were found to decline as a function of motion, but the magnitude of the decline depended on the location and shape of the defect. Defects located near the cardiac apex lost contrast more rapidly than those located on the anterior, inferior, septal and lateral wall. The contrast decreased by less than 5% at every location when the motion magnitude was 2 mm or less. According to a visual evaluation, there were differences in myocardial perfusion if the magnitude of the motion was greater than 1 mm, and there were differences in the visibility of the cardiac defect if the magnitude of the motion was greater than 9 mm.
Intra-window respiratory motion should be limited to 2 mm to effectively correct for respiratory motion blur in myocardial perfusion SPECT.
Surface plasmon polaritons are electromagnetic surface waves, which, due to their nanoscale nature, are efficiently used for modifying an output of optical field through a metallic nanoslit, e.g., extraordinary optical transmission and beaming of light. Herein, the phenomenon of optical beaming by employing a regular array of semicylinder-shaped grooves around a nanoslit has been investigated based on numerical simulations. By analyzing the behavior of Poynting vectors in near surroundings of the slit, we have successfully demonstrated that grooves which are embedded on the layer at the exit side of the slit produce enhanced directionality of the output light than the unembedded ones. In case of semicylinder-shaped grooves, the calculated intensity of the output beam was 1.5-times, at near and far distances, higher than that of the grating grooves. Our analysis shows that positioning of the groove right at the exit of the slit is crucial for the enhancement of the beaming effect. This is due to the conversion of surface plasmon polaritons into a freely propagating field and the possible excitation of localized surface plasmons because of the presence of nanogroove. Furthermore, the proposed geometries are made of Aluminum, which is a plasmonic material and commonly applied for the fabrication of optical nanostructures. Manipulating of light (beaming, focusing/guiding, and splitting) by nanoslit can be beneficial to several applications such as nano-resolution optical imaging, sensors, and plasmonic circuits.
We developed multifactorial models for predicting incident dementia and brain pathology in the oldest old using the Vantaa 85+ cohort.
We included participants without dementia at baseline and at least 2 years of follow-up (N = 245) for dementia prediction or with autopsy data (N = 163) for pathology. A supervised machine learning method was used for model development, considering sociodemographic, cognitive, clinical, vascular, and lifestyle factors, as well as APOE genotype. Neuropathological assessments included β-amyloid, neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), macro- and microscopic infarcts, α-synuclein pathology, hippocampal sclerosis, and TDP-43.
Prediction model performance was evaluated using AUC for 10 × 10-fold cross-validation. Overall AUCs were 0.73 for dementia, 0.64-0.68 for Alzheimer's disease (AD)- or amyloid-related pathologies, 0.72 for macroinfarcts, and 0.61 for microinfarcts. Predictors for dementia were different from those in previous reports of younger populations; for example, age, sex, and vascular and lifestyle factors were not predictive. Predictors for dementia versus pathology were also different, because cognition and education predicted dementia but not AD- or amyloid-related pathologies. APOE genotype was most consistently present across all models. APOE alleles had a different impact: ε4 did not predict dementia, but it did predict all AD- or amyloid-related pathologies; ε2 predicted dementia, but it was protective against amyloid and neuropathological AD; and ε3ε3 was protective against dementia, neurofibrillary tangles, and CAA. Very few other factors were predictive of pathology.
Differences between predictors for dementia in younger old versus oldest old populations, as well as for dementia versus pathology, should be considered more carefully in future studies.
Autophagy is a catabolic pathway, which breaks down old and damaged cytoplasmic material into basic biomolecules through lysosome-mediated digestion thereby recycling cellular material. In this way, autophagy prevents the accumulation of damaged cellular components inside cells and reduces metabolic stress and toxicity. The basal level of autophagy is generally low but essential for maintaining the turnover of proteins and other molecules. The level is, however, increased in response to various stress conditions including chemical stress. This elevation in autophagy is intended to restore energy balance and improve cell survival in stress conditions. However, aberrant and/or deficient autophagy may also be involved in the aggravation of chemical-caused insults. Thus, the overall role of autophagy in chemical-induced toxicity is complex and only a limited number of environmental chemicals have been studied from this point of view. Autophagy is associated with many of the chemical-caused cytotoxic mechanisms, including mitochondrial dysfunction, DNA damage, oxidative stress, changes in the endoplasmic reticulum, impairment of lysosomal functions, and inflammation. This mini-review describes autophagy and its involvement in the responses to some common environmental exposures including airborne particulate matter, nanoparticles and tobacco smoke as well as to some common single environmental chemicals.
This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of lime and bisphosphonates (BPs) such as N10O chelate amendment on the growth, physiological and biochemical parameters, and phytoextraction potential of the willow variety Klara (Salix viminalis × S. schwerinii × S. dasyclados) grown in soils heavily contaminated with copper (Cu), nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn). The plants were irrigated with tap or processed water (mine wastewater). The results suggest that the combined effects of the contaminated soil and processed water inhibited growth parameters, gas exchange parameters and chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm) values. In contrast, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, organic acids, total phenolic and total flavonoid contents, and the accumulation of metals/metalloids in the plant tissues were increased compared to the control. When the soil was supplemented with lime and N10O; growth, physiological, biochemical parameters, and resistance capacity were significantly higher compared to unamended soil treatments, especially in the contaminated soil treatments. The combined lime‒ and N10O‒amended soil treatment produced higher growth rates, resistance capacity, photosynthesis rates and phytoextraction efficiency levels relative to either the lime‒amended or the N10O‒amended soil treatments. This study provides practical evidence of the efficient chelate‒assisted phytoextraction capability of Klara and highlights its potential as a viable and inexpensive novel approach for in situ remediation of Cu‒, Ni‒ and Zn‒contaminated soils and mine wastewaters.
Omega-3 fatty acids are known to have several cardioprotective effects. Our aim was to investigate the effects of intakes of fish and Camelina sativa oil (CSO), rich in alpha-linolenic acid, on the atherogenic and anti-atherogenic functions of LDL and HDL particles.
Altogether, 88 volunteers with impaired glucose metabolism were randomly assigned to CSO (10 g of alpha-linolenic acid/day), fatty fish (4 fish meals/week), lean fish (4 fish meals/week) or control group for 12 weeks. 79 subjects completed the study. The binding of lipoproteins to aortic proteoglycans, LDL aggregation and activation of endothelial cells by LDL and cholesterol efflux capacity of HDL were determined in vitro.
Intake of CSO decreased the binding of lipoproteins to aortic proteoglycans in a non-normalized model (p = 0.006). After normalizing with serum concentrations of non-HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B (apoB) or LDL cholesterol, which decreased in the CSO group, the change was no longer statistically significant. In the fish groups, there were no changes in the binding of lipoproteins to proteoglycans. Regarding other lipoprotein functions, there were no changes in any of the groups.
Intake of CSO decreases the binding of lipoproteins to aortic proteoglycans by decreasing serum LDL cholesterol concentration, which suggests that the level of apoB-containing lipoproteins in the circulation is the main driver of lipoprotein retention within the arterial wall. Intake of fish or CSO has no effects on other lipoprotein functions.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease has been associated with increased mRNA expression of FADS2 in the liver and estimated activity of delta-6 desaturase in serum, encoded by the FADS2 gene. Since DNA methylation in the FADS1/2/3 gene cluster has been previously linked with genetic variants and desaturase activities, we now aimed to discover factors regulating DNA methylation of the CpG sites annotated to FADS1/2 genes.
DNA methylation levels in the CpG sites annotated to FADS2 and FADS1 were analyzed from liver samples of 95 obese participants of the Kuopio Obesity Surgery Study (34 men and 61 women, age 49.5 ± 7.7 years, BMI 43.0 ± 5.7 kg/m2) using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina). Associations between DNA methylation levels and estimated delta-6 and delta-5 desaturase enzyme activities, liver histology, hepatic mRNA expression, FADS1/2 genotypes, and erythrocyte folate levels were analyzed.
We found a negative correlation between DNA methylation levels of cg06781209 and cg07999042 and hepatic FADS2 mRNA expression (both p &lt; 0.05), and with estimated delta-6 desaturase activity based on both liver and serum fatty acids (all p &lt; 0.05). Interestingly, the methylation level of cg07999042 (p = 0.001) but not of cg06781209 (p = 0.874) was associated with FADS2 variant rs174616.
Genetic variants of FADS2 may contribute to the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by modifying DNA methylation.
Radiation exposure during the course of treatment in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients can induce both structural and biochemical anomalies. The present study is focused on utilizing infrared imaging for the identification of the minor biochemical alterations in the oral mucosa. Chemical maps generated using glycoprotein band indicates its differential distribution along the superficial layer. Spectra extracted from this layer suggests changes in overall nucleic acid and protein content in response to the therapeutic irradiation. Discrimination among control and irradiated groups have been achieved using principal component analysis. Findings of this preliminary study further support prospective utilization of Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) imaging as a non-destructive, label-free tool for objective assessment of the oral mucosa in patient groups with or without radiation therapy.
Preclinical imaging studies of posttraumatic epileptogenesis (PTE) have largely been proof-of-concept studies with limited animal numbers, and thus lack the statistical power for biomarker discovery. Epilepsy Bioinformatics Study for Antiepileptogenic Therapy (EpiBioS4Rx) is a pioneering multicenter trial investigating preclinical imaging biomarkers of PTE. EpiBios4Rx faced the issue of harmonizing the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedures and imaging data metrics prior to its execution. We present here the harmonization process between three preclinical MRI facilities at the University of Eastern Finland (UEF), the University of Melbourne (Melbourne), and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and evaluate the uniformity of the obtained MRI data. Adult, male rats underwent a lateral fluid percussion injury (FPI) and were followed by MRI 2 days, 9 days, 1 month, and 5 months post-injury. Ex vivo scans of fixed brains were conducted 7 months post-injury as an end point follow-up. Four MRI modalities were used: T2-weighted imaging, multi-gradient-echo imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and magnetization transfer imaging, and acquisition parameters for each modality were tailored to account for the different field strengths (4.7 T and 7 T) and different MR hardwares used at the three participating centers. Pilot data collection resulted in comparable image quality across sites. In interim analysis (of data obtained by April 30, 2018), the within-site variation of the quantified signal properties was low, while some differences between sites remained. In T2-weighted images the signal-to-noise ratios were high at each site, being 35 at UEF, 48 at Melbourne, and 32 at UCLA (p &lt; 0.05). The contrast-to-noise ratios were similar between the sites (9, 10, and 8, respectively). Magnetization transfer ratio maps had identical white matter/ gray matter contrast between the sites, with white matter showing 15% higher MTR than gray matter despite different absolute MTR values (MTR both in white and gray matter was 3% lower in Melbourne than at UEF, p &lt; 0.05). Diffusion-weighting yielded different degrees of signal attenuation across sites, being 83% at UEF, 76% in Melbourne, and 80% at UCLA (p &lt; 0.05). Fractional anisotropy values differed as well, being 0.81 at UEF, 0.73 in Melbourne, and 0.84 at UCLA (p &lt; 0.05). The obtained values in sham animals showed low variation within each site and no change over time, suggesting high repeatability of the measurements. Quality control scans with phantoms demonstrated stable hardware performance over time. Timing of post-TBI scans was designed to target specific phases of the dynamic pathology, and the execution at different centers was highly accurate. Besides a few outliers, the 2-day scans were done within an hour from the target time point. At day 9, most animals were scanned within an hour from the target time point, and all but 2 outliers within 24 h from the target. The 1-month post-TBI scans were done within 31 ± 3 days. MRI procedures and animal physiology during scans were similar between the sites. Taken together, the 10% inter-site difference in FA and 3% difference in MTR values should be included into analysis as a covariate or balanced out in post-processing in order to detect disease-related effects on brain structure at the same scale. However, for a MRI biomarker for post-traumatic epileptogenesis to have realistic chance of being successfully translated to validation in clinical trials, it would need to be a robust TBI-induced structural change which tolerates the inter-site methodological variability described here.
Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) is a common disease, where the mechanical integrity of articular cartilage is compromised. PTOA can be a result of chondral defects formed due to injurious loading. One of the first changes around defects is proteoglycan depletion. Since there are no methods to restore injured cartilage fully back to its healthy state, preventing the onset and progression of the disease is advisable. However, this is problematic if the disease progression cannot be predicted. Thus, we developed an algorithm to predict proteoglycan loss of injured cartilage by decreasing the fixed charge density (FCD) concentration. We tested several mechanisms based on the local strains or stresses in the tissue for the FCD loss. By choosing the degeneration threshold suggested for inducing chondrocyte apoptosis and cartilage matrix damage, the algorithm driven by the maximum shear strain showed the most substantial FCD losses around the lesion. This is consistent with experimental findings in the literature. We also observed that by using coordinate system-independent strain measures and selecting the degeneration threshold in an ad hoc manner, all the resulting FCD distributions would appear qualitatively similar, i.e., the greatest FCD losses are found at the tissue adjacent to the lesion. The proposed strain-based FCD degeneration algorithm shows a great potential for predicting the progression of PTOA via biomechanical stimuli. This could allow identification of high-risk defects with an increased risk of PTOA progression.
To compare the accumulation of hospital days between initiators and noninitiators of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) among persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Exposure-matched cohort study.
Persons newly diagnosed with AD in 2005-2011 (n = 70,718) and initiating AED use identified from Finnish health care registers. For each AED initiator, 1 noninitiator matched on age, sex, and time since AD diagnosis was selected. Persons with epilepsy were excluded from the study.
Association between AED initiation or use of individual AEDs and accumulation of hospital days during a 2-year follow-up was assessed using negative binomial model.
AED initiators (n = 4432) were hospitalized on average for 43.7 (SD: 88.3) days and matched noninitiators for 32.2 (SD: 71.3) days during the 2-year follow-up. Altogether, 27.3% of the AED initiators and 35.6% of the noninitiators had no hospital days during the study period. Number of accumulated hospital days during the follow-up was 31% higher [adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR): 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.19-1.43] among AED initiators than the noninitiators. Hospital days due to diseases of the nervous system excluding dementia (aIRR: 2.72, 95% CI: 1.72-4.31), musculoskeletal system (aIRR: 2.49, 95% CI: 1.73-3.58), respiratory system (aIRR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.47-2.43), and mental and behavioral disorders excluding dementia (aIRR: 1.96, 95% CI: 1.02-3.79) were more common among the AED initiators than noninitiators. Among pregabalin (aIRR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.56-0.77), gabapentin (aIRR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.49-0.88), and clonazepam (aIRR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.55-0.96) initiators, the number of accumulated hospital days was 27% to 35% lower than the days accumulated among the initiators of valproic acid.
AED initiators had more hospital days than noninitiators. Pregabalin and gabapentin were associated with a lower number of hospital days than valproic acid. Further research is needed on the reasons for these findings.
Ferulic acid (FA), a natural antioxidant, has displayed some potential benefits against Alzheimer's disease. However, due to its poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeation and low bioavailability, the clinical use of FA for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease has been limited. In the present study, we applied an L-type amino acid transporter (LAT1) - mediated prodrug approach to deliver FA into the mouse brain and synthetized three novel LAT1-utilizing prodrugs of FA. We used a previously proposed methodology for the development of transporter-utilizing prodrugs and investigated their cellular uptake via LAT1 in vitro in ARPE-19 cells, BBB permeation using in situ perfusion in mice and pharmacokinetics after a single i.p. injection in mice; and compared the findings to our previous structure-pharmacokinetics relationship analysis of LAT1-utilizing prodrugs. In addition, we evaluated interspecies differences in the bioconversion rate of the ester-based prodrug in mouse and human plasma and liver S9 subcellular fraction. It was found that amide-based prodrugs with an aromatic ring in the promoiety were effectively bound to LAT1 and utilized the transporter for cellular uptake in vitro and crossed the BBB after in situ perfusion in mice. In addition, the amide prodrug with the promoiety directly conjugated in the meta-position to FA was bioconverted to the parent drug in mouse brain. Importantly, the study showed that the analogous ester-based prodrug did bind to LAT1 but did not utilize the transporter for cellular uptake in ARPE-19 cells. However, the presence of an ester linker between the prodrug and the parent drug promoted favorable bioconversion properties in human in comparison to mouse tissues in vitro i.e. the ester prodrug showed higher stability in human plasma (75% of intact prodrug in 5 h) and liver S9 subcellular fraction (181 min) in comparison to mouse plasma (t½ 2.6 min) and liver S9 fraction (t½ 23.3 min), suggesting that ester-based prodrugs may offer potential benefits in humans. In conclusion, switching from an amide to ester linker between the promoiety and the parent drug can affect the bioconversion rate of prodrugs in different species as well as influencing their cellular uptake mechanism. Furthermore, the results demonstrated the effective application of structure-pharmacokinetic relationships and screening methodology for developing LAT1-utilizing prodrugs and highlighted the importance of evaluating the biotransformation of parent drug and prodrugs in different species.
By exploring the Salisbury screen approach, we propose and demonstrate a thin film absorber of terahertz (THz) radiation. The absorber is comprised of a less than 100 nm thick layer of pyrolytic carbon deposited on a stretchable polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film followed by the metal film. We demonstrate that being overall less than 200 microns thick, such a sandwich structure absorbs resonantly up to 99.9%of the incident THz radiation, and that the absorption resonance is determined by the polymer thickness, which can be adjusted by stretching.
Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a progressive disease starting from mild valvular sclerosis and progressing to severe aortic stenosis (AS) with calcified valves. The origin of the calcification is proposed to be mesenchymal cells which have differentiated towards an osteoblastic phenotype. Podoplanin is a glycoprotein expressed in the endothelium of lymphatic vessels and in osteoblasts and osteocytes, mesenchymal cells, as well as in many carcinomas and aortic atherosclerotic lesions. In CAVD, its expression has been evaluated only as a marker of the lymphatic vasculature.
We determined podoplanin expression in human aortic valves in four patient groups: control (C, n=7), aortic regurgitation (AR, n=8), aortic regurgitation and fibrosis (AR + f, n=15) and AS (n=49) by immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR).
Immunohistochemically, podoplanin expression was significantly increased in AR + f and AS groups when compared with the control and AR groups and the level of expression positively correlated with the extent of calcification and vascularity. Podoplanin mRNA levels were 1.7-fold higher in the AS group as compared with the control group (P=.05). Podoplanin-positivity was present not only in lymphatic vessel endothelium but also in osteoblasts, osteocytes, chondrocytes, macrophages and extracellular matrix. The majority of the podoplanin-positivity was in spindle cells with a myofibroblastic phenotype, often associated with calcifications. Tricuspid valves had more calcification-associated podoplanin than bi/unicuspid valves (median 1.52 vs 1.16, P&lt;.001).
CAVD is characterized by an increased expression of podoplanin; this is associated with the differentiation of valvular interstitial cells into calcium-producing, myofibroblast-like cells. In addition, tricuspid valves express relatively more podoplanin than bi/unicuspid valves.
Reading a word activates morphologically related words in the mental lexicon. People with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) often have difficulty retrieving words, though the source of this problem is not well understood. To better understand the word recognition process in aging and in neurodegenerative disorders such as MCI and AD, we investigated the nature of the activation of morphologically related family members in 22 Finnish speakers with AD, 24 with MCI, and 17 cognitively healthy elderly. We presented Finnish monomorphemic (base form) nouns in a single-word lexical decision experiment to measure the speed of word recognition and its relation to morphological and lexical variables. Morphological variables included morphological family size (separate for compounds and derived words) and pseudo-morphological family size (including the set of words that have a partially overlapping form but that do not share an actual morpheme, e.g., pet and carpet, or corn and corner). Pseudo-morphological family size was included to examine the influence of words with orthographic (or phonological) overlap that are not semantically related to the target words. Our analyses revealed that younger and elderly controls and individuals with MCI or AD were influenced by true morphological overlap (overlapping forms that also share meaning), as well as by the word's pseudo-morphological family. However, elderly controls and individuals with MCI or AD seemed to rely more on form overlap than young adults. This demonstrates that an increased reliance on form-based aspects of language processing in Alzheimer's disease is not necessarily due to a partial loss of access to semantics, but might be explained in part by a common age-related change of processes in written word recognition.
Thiocyanate level in the human system can serve as a biomarker to distinguish smokers from non-smokers. Thiocyanate is a potential goitrogen, thus an accurate determination may help to identify lactating mothers with high thiocyanate dosage, thereby preventing the transport of excess SCN- to infants. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy has become a versatile and reliable technique to detect SCN- in different media. However, the conventional surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates used to detect SCN- are often discarded after use. The frequent disposal of such metal nanoparticles is detrimental to the environment and makes the SERS-based detection of SCN- uneconomical. In this study, we present fabrication of a new, ultrasensitive and recyclable SERS substrate, based on an AuSiO2@Ag wire (W) superstructure, to detect SCN- in different media. The hierarchical AuSiO2@AgW substrate was obtained by forming nano-sized patches of SiO2 on micron-sized AgW and anchoring 30 nm-sized gold nanoparticles on the patches with mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane. This ultrasensitive substrate could detect SCN- at a low concentration of 0.001 μM in water, and 0.01 μM in urine and human serum. In addition, a facile procedure to regenerate and recycle the SCN- bound AuSiO2@AgW platform in different media has been demonstrated. The insight gained in the present study can serve as a promising and powerful method for fabrication of active and recyclable substrates for SERS-based detection of SCN-.
Root and butt rot of conifer trees caused by fungi belonging to the Heterobasidion annosum species complex is one of the most economically important fungal diseases in commercial conifer plantations throughout the Northern hemisphere. We investigated the interactions between Heterobasidion fungi and their host by conducting dual RNA-seq and chemical analysis on Norway spruce trees naturally infected by Heterobasidion spp. We analyzed host and pathogen transcriptome and phenolic and terpenoid contents of the spruce trees.
Presented results emphasize the role of the phenylpropanoid and flavonoid pathways in the chemical defense of Norway spruce trees. Accumulation of lignans was observed in trees displaying symptoms of wood decay. A number of candidate genes with a predicted role in the higher level regulation of spruce defense responses were identified. Our data indicate a possible role of abscisic acid (ABA) signaling in the spruce defense against Heterobasidion infection. Fungal transcripts corresponding to genes encoding carbohydrate- and lignin-degrading enzymes, secondary metabolism genes and effector-like genes were expressed during the host colonization.
Our results provide additional insight into defense strategies employed by Norway spruce trees against Heterobasidion infection. The potential applications of the identified candidate genes as markers for higher resistance against root and butt rot deserve further evaluation.
The Epilepsy Bioinformatics Study for Antiepileptogenic Therapy (EpiBioS4Rx) is a National Institutes for Neurological Diseases and Stoke funded Centers-Without-Walls international multidisciplinary study aimed at preventing epileptogenesis. The preclinical biomarker discovery in EpiBios4Rx applies a multicenter study design to allow the number of animals that are required for adequate statistical power for the analysis to be studied in an efficient manner. Further, the use of multiple centers mimics the clinical trial situation, and therefore potentially the chance of successful clinical translation of the outcomes of the study. Its successful implementation requires harmonization of procedures and data analyses between the three contributing centers in Finland, Australia, and USA. The objective of the present analysis was to develop metrics for analysis of the success of harmonization of procedures to guide further data analyses and plan the future multicenter preclinical studies. The interim analysis of data is based on the analysis of data from 212 rats with lateral fluid-percussion injury or sham-operation included in the biomarker discovery by April 30, 2018. The details of protocols, including production of injury, post-injury follow-up, blood sampling, electroencephalogram recording, and magnetic resonance imaging have been presented in the accompanying manuscripts in this Supplement. Implementation of protocols in EpiBios4Rx project participant centers was visualized in 2D using t-distributed stochastic neighborhood embedding (t-SNE). The protocols applied to each rat were presented as feature vectors of procedure related variables (e.g., impact pressure, anesthesia time). The total number of protocol features linked to each rat was 112. The missing data was accounted in visualization by utilizing imputation and adding the number of missing values as a third dimension to 2D t-SNE plot, resulting in a 3D overview of protocol data. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) using Euclidean distances and area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of k-nearest neighbor classifier (KNN) were utilized to quantify the degree of clustering by center. Both subsets of data with incomplete protocol vectors omitted and missing protocol data imputed were assessed. Our data show that a visible clustering by center was observed in all t-SNE plots, except for day 7 neuroscores. Both ICC and AUC indicated clustering by center in all protocol variable subsets, excluding unimputed day 7 neuroscores (ICC 0.04 and AUC 0.6). ICC for imputed set of all protocol related variables was 0.1 and KNN AUC 0.92. In conclusion, both ICC and AUC indicated differences in protocol between EpiBios4Rx participating centers, which needs to be taken into account in data analysis. Importantly, the majority of observed differences are recoverable as they relate to insufficient updates in record keeping. While AUC score of KNN is a more sensitive measure for protocol harmonization than ICC for data that displays complex splintered clustering, ICC and AUC provide complementary measures to assess the degree of procedural harmonization. This experience should be helpful for other groups planning such multicenter post-traumatic epileptogenesis studies in the future.
Intensive-care unit (ICU) nurses have an important role in the recruitment of patients for scientific research and in the performance of clinical research.
A study was conducted to examine ICU nurses' perceptions of ethics-related aspects of ICU-based research. The study focused on nurse attitudes and knowledge related to clinical research, with special emphasis on perceptions of the informed-consent process in ICU research.
The study applied a descriptive qualitative approach, involving semi-structured group interviews and theme-based inductive content analysis. Subjects were ICU nurses (n = 28) at a university hospital ICU who had experience with research protocols applied in that unit.
The nurses had mainly positive perceptions of clinical studies. They found research beneficial for future patients and for society. The nurses considered the information given to them about the studies inadequate. They were concerned about the fact that the consent for research is almost always obtained at the beginning of the ICU care, when patients and relatives are still in the crisis period. This limits the possibility of understanding and assimilating the information provided on the study.
The role of ICU nurses in clinical studies should be more prominent and taken into account in the planning of ICU studies.
Breakthroughs in Medicinal Chemistry: New Targets and Mechanisms, New Drugs, New Hopes is a series of Editorials, which is published on a biannual basis by the Editorial Board of the Medicinal Chemistry section of the journal Molecules. [...].
Biologicals are important ocular drugs that are be delivered using monthly and bimonthly intravitreal injections to treat retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration. Long acting delivery systems are needed for prolongation of their dosing interval. Intravitreal biologicals are eliminated from the eye via the aqueous humor outflow. Thus, the anterior and posterior segments are exposed to the drug. We utilized a kinetic simulation model to estimate protein drug concentrations in the vitreous and aqueous humor after bolus injection and controlled release administration to the vitreous. The simulations predicted accurately the experimental levels of 5 biologicals in the vitreous and aqueous humor. The good match between the simulations and experimental data demonstrated almost complete anterior segment bioavailability, and major dose sparing with ocular controlled release systems. Overall, the model is a useful tool in the design of intraocular delivery of biologicals.
Associations between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and cholesterol in depressed patients are unclear. Therefore, we compared 78 adult outpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD) with (n = 24) or without (n = 54) experiences of physical violence in childhood. Background data were collected with questionnaires, and total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were measured from fasting blood samples. Patients with a history of childhood physical violence had lower levels of TC than the control group. No differences were observed in HDL-C, LDL-C, or low-grade inflammation levels between the two groups. In multivariate models, decreased levels of TC were associated with childhood physical violence, and these associations remained significant after adjustments for age, gender, lifestyle, metabolic condition, socioeconomic situation, psychiatric status, suicidality, low-grade inflammation, the chronicity of depression, medications used and somatic diseases. At the 8-month follow-up, the results were essentially the same when the Trauma and Distress Scale (TADS) was used as the measure of ACEs. The specific mechanisms underlying cholesterol alterations associated with ACEs are a topic for future studies. Better understanding of these mechanisms might lead to possible new interventions in the prevention of adverse health effects resulting from ACEs.
Underlying mechanisms of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) have been investigated for over 100 years and novel molecular level mechanisms in the pathophysiology are still continuously being discovered. Genetic polymorphisms (SNPs = single nucleotide polymorphisms) have explained about one tenth of the CVD risk, but polymorphisms fail to account for gene-environment interactions i.e. explain the dynamics of epigenome modifications in CVD. Accumulating evidence suggests that epigenetic modifications are actively reshaping pathological processes (e.g. dedifferentiation of smooth muscle cells, accumulation of senescent cells) in CVD. Senescence of vascular cells in ageing arteries not only counteracts regenerative processes but also exacerbates atherogenesis. Epigenome modifications include changes in DNA methylation, histone code and expression of non-coding RNAs. DNA methylation is a major epigenetic regulator modulating cell-type specific gene expression in mural cells, but there is some controversy regarding how to interpret the role of DNA hyper- and hypomethylation in CVD pathology. DNA hypomethylation (loss of methyl cytosines) appears to predominate in atherosclerosis, while a few genes become more methylated (i.e. hypermethylated) as the disease progresses in medium-sized and large arteries. The actual time-course of atherosclerosis-linked changes in genomic DNA methylation is still poorly studied. This review highlights recent novel findings which link alterations in DNA methylation to atherogenesis and points out new potential approaches for novel treatments.
Frailty can inform management approaches for individuals with COPD. However, inpatient measures of frailty are seldom employed because they are time-consuming or inapplicable for bed-bound patients. We investigated the feasibility and potential of an innovative sensor-based upper-extremity function (UEF) test for frailty assessment in predicting adverse outcomes.
Hospitalized patients with COPD-related exacerbations (aged ≥55 years) were recruited and performed the UEF test within 24 hours of admission. UEF parameters were obtained and fed into our previously developed frailty model to calculate frailty status (non-frail, pre-frail, and frail) and frailty score (0: extreme resilience to 1: extreme frailty). In-hospital (length of stay) and post-discharge (discharge disposition, 30-day exacerbation with treatment, and all-cause 30-day readmission) outcomes were collected. Associations between UEF frailty and outcomes were investigated using ANOVA and logistic models adjusted for demographic data.
In total, 42 patients were recruited. All participants were able to perform the UEF test. Based on UEF, participants were stratified into three groups of non-frail (n=6, frailty score =0.18±0.09), pre-frail (n=14, frailty score =0.45±0.09), and frail (n=22, frailty score =0.78±0.11). Both frailty status and frailty score were significantly associated with unfavorable discharge disposition (P&lt;0.005) and all-cause 30-day readmission (P&lt;0.05). On the other hand, UEF frailty measures were associated with neither hospital length of stay (P&gt;0.5) nor 30-day exacerbation with treatment (P&gt;0.70). Age was only significantly associated with unfavorable discharge disposition (P=0.048).
In agreement with previous work, the current findings underline the importance of measuring frailty for risk-stratification of COPD patients. The UEF was feasible and easily performed among all hospitalized COPD patients. In this study, we have shown that, using our quick and objective frailty measures, COPD patients can be prospectively risk-stratified in terms of unfavorable discharge disposition and all-cause 30-day readmissions.
Tumorigenesis is accompanied by the metabolic adaptation of cells to support enhanced proliferation rates and to optimize tumor persistence and amplification within the local microenvironment. In particular, cancer cells exhibit elevated levels of biogenic polyamines. Inhibitors of polyamine biosynthesis and inducers of their catabolism have been evaluated as antitumor drugs, however, their efficacy and safety remain controversial. Our goal was to investigate if drug-induced modulation of polyamine metabolism plays a role in dedifferentiation using differentiated human hepatocyte-like HepaRG cell cultures. N¹,N11-diethylnorspermine (DENSpm), a potent inducer of polyamine catabolism, triggered an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like dedifferentiation in HepaRG cultures, as shown by down-regulation of mature hepatocytes markers and upregulation of classical EMT markers. Albeit the fact that polyamine catabolism produces H2O2, DENSpm-induced de-differentiation was not affected by antioxidants. Use of a metabolically stable spermidine analogue showed furthermore, that spermidine is a key regulator of hepatocyte differentiation. Comparative transcriptome analyses revealed, that the DENSpm-triggered dedifferentiation of HepaRG cells was accompanied by dramatic metabolic adaptations, exemplified by down-regulation of the genes of various metabolic pathways and up-regulation of the genes involved in signal transduction pathways. These results demonstrate that polyamine metabolism is tightly linked to EMT and differentiation of liver epithelial cells.
No single-omic approach completely elucidates the multitude of alterations taking place in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we coupled transcriptomic and phosphoproteomic approaches to determine the temporal sequence of changes in mRNA, protein, and phosphopeptide expression levels from human temporal cortical samples, with varying degree of AD-related pathology. This approach highlighted fluctuation in synaptic and mitochondrial function as the earliest pathological events in brain samples with AD-related pathology. Subsequently, increased expression of inflammation and extracellular matrix-associated gene products was observed. Interaction network assembly for the associated gene products, emphasized the complex interplay between these processes and the role of addressing post-translational modifications in the identification of key regulators. Additionally, we evaluate the use of decision trees and random forests in identifying potential biomarkers differentiating individuals with different degree of AD-related pathology. This multiomic and temporal sequence-based approach provides a better understanding of the sequence of events leading to AD.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) increases the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Human AD brains show reduced glucose metabolism as measured by [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-2-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). Here, we used 14-month-old wild-type (WT) and APPSwe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice to investigate how a single dose of intranasal insulin modulates brain glucose metabolism using FDG-PET and affects spatial learning and memory. We also assessed how insulin influences the activity of Akt1 and Akt2 kinases, the expression of glial and neuronal markers, and autophagy in the hippocampus. Intranasal insulin moderately increased glucose metabolism and specifically activated Akt2 and its downstream signaling in the hippocampus of WT, but not APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, insulin differentially affected the expression of homeostatic microglia markers P2ry12 and Cx3cr1 and autophagy in the hippocampus of WT and APP/PS1 mice. We found no evidence that a single dose of intranasal insulin improves overnight memory. Our results suggest that intranasal insulin exerts diverse effects on Akt2 signaling, autophagy, and the homeostatic status of microglia depending on the degree of AD-related pathology.
Several kinds of process disturbances can occur during (continuous) tablet manufacturing, i.e. unintentional or intentional disturbances. Long run-time continuous manufacturing studies are used to investigate the effects of intentional and unintentional deviations. In this study, the horizontal continuous manufacturing line included a double mixing - direct compression set up. The study consisted of two long duration test runs. In the first run, the API (paracetamol) was fed in during the first feeding and blending stage with lubricant (Mg.Stear.) added during the second feeding and blending stage. In the second run, the API and lubricant feeding stages were reversed. The run protocol included a long run with several feeder re-fills and an overnight hold-time, continuing with the same API concentration followed by a change to a higher API concentration on the fly (without cleaning). The objectives of this pilot study were to determine the intentional (e.g. overnight hold time, product concentration change) and unintentional (e.g. equipment or software failures) deviations, which could affect the critical quality attributes (CQA's) of the final product and to create a deviation document which would reveal the changes that had occurred in the product concentration during the runs. Another goal was to study the effect of feeding location of lubricant and API feeding. The CQA's were the assayed values of API, tablet strength, friability, tablet weight and its dissolution profile. The vacuum conveyors, which were needed to transfer materials in the horizontal set-up, were observed to introduce variation into the mass flow rates and feeding. Thus, there were significant challenges to ensuring a constant mass flow rate during the runs. One expected effect was that over-lubrication was evident when the lubricant was fed during the first feeding and mixing stage, resulting in a significantly reduced tablet strength and a slower dissolution of API. There were no observable trends over time in the process parameters or CQAs i.e. evidence of a stable process. The overnight hold-time did not affect the CQAs of tablets. Moreover, the variation in all CQAs was smaller after the overnight hold-time which was particularly unexpected. In conclusion, the results reveal that the process itself was able to produce a quality end product, but the set-up needs to be better designed and controlled to ensure a constant mass flow and prevent over-lubrication.
The myeloid master regulator CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA) is known as a pioneer factor. In this study, we report the CEBPA cistrome of THP-1 human monocytes after stimulation with the vitamin D receptor (VDR) ligand 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) for 2, 8 and 24 h. About a third of the genomic VDR binding sites co-located with those of CEBPA. In parallel, the binding strength of 5% of the CEBPA cistrome, i.e. some 1500 sites, is significantly (p &lt; 0.001) affected by 1,25(OH)2D3. Transcriptome-wide analysis after CEBPA silencing indicated that the pioneer factor enhances both the basal expression and ligand inducibility of 70 vitamin D target genes largely involved in lipid signaling and metabolism. In contrast, CEBPA suppresses 82 vitamin D target genes many of which are related to the modulation of T cell activity by monocytes. The inducibility of the promoter-specific histone marker H3K4me3 distinguishes the former class of genes from the latter. Moreover, prominent occupancy of the myeloid pioneer factor PU.1 on 1,25(OH)2D3-sensitive CEBPA enhancers mechanistically explains the dichotomy of vitamin D target genes. In conclusion, CEBPA supports vitamin D signaling concerning actions of the innate immune system, but uses the antagonism with PU.1 for suppressing possible overreactions of adaptive immunity.
Currently, there are no clinically available tools or applications which could predict osteoarthritis development. Some computational models have been presented to simulate cartilage degeneration, but they are not clinically feasible due to time required to build subject-specific knee models. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a template-based modeling method for rapid prediction of knee joint cartilage degeneration. Knee joint models for 21 subjects were constructed with two different template approaches (multiple templates and one template) based on the MRI data. Geometries were also generated by manual segmentation. Evaluated volumes of cartilage degeneration for each subject, as assessed with the degeneration algorithm, were compared with experimentally observed 4 year follow up Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grades. Furthermore, the effect of meniscus was tested by generating models with subject-specific meniscal supporting forces and those with the average meniscal supporting force from all models. All tested models were able to predict most severe cartilage degeneration to those subjects who had the highest KL grade after 4 year follow up. Surprisingly, in terms of statistical significance, the best result was obtained with one template approach and average meniscal support. This model was fully able to categorize all subjects to their experimentally defined groups (KL0, KL2 and KL3) based on the 4 year follow-up data. The results suggest that a template- or population-based approach, which is much faster than fully subject-specific, could be applied as a clinical prediction tool for osteoarthritis.
In the vitamin D intervention study VitDbol (NCT02063334) blood samples were drawn directly before an oral bolus (2000 μg vitamin D3) and 24 h later. The focus of phase II of VitDbol was the transcriptome-wide analysis of the effects of vitamin D gene expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). All five participants responded in an individual fashion to the bolus by increases in serum levels of the vitamin D metabolites 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) and 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3). RNA sequencing identified 15.040 commonly expressed genes in PBMCs, 702 (4,7%) of which were significantly (p &lt; 0,05) affected by the vitamin D3 bolus. KEGG pathway analysis suggested that these genes are involved in general protein translation, monocyte differentiation and cellular growth control. Previously published transcriptome-wide studies in comparable cell systems confirmed 234 of the 702 vitamin D target genes, leaving many genes, such as HLA-A and HLA-C, as novel discoveries. Interestingly, in vivo stimulated PBMCs of this study showed a larger number of common vitamin D target genes with the monocytic cell line THP-1 than with in vitro stimulated PBMCs. The expression pattern of vitamin D target genes differed significantly between individuals and the average expression change can serve as a marker for vitamin D responsiveness. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that under in vivo conditions changes in 25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2D3 serum concentrations alter the expression of more than 700 vitamin D target genes in human leukocytes.
Social withdrawal is a core feature of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Currently available pharmacotherapies have only limited efficacy towards the negative symptoms, i.e., there is a significant unmet medical need in the treatment of these symptoms.
We wanted to confirm whether selective adrenergic α2C receptor (AR) antagonist therapy could ameliorate acute phencyclidine (PCP)-induced schizophrenia-like social interaction deficits in rats, and to compare the effects of an α2C AR antagonist to another putative therapeutic alternative, an α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) partial agonist, as well against three commonly used atypical antipsychotics.
Here, we used acute PCP administration and modified a protocol for testing social interaction deficits in male Wistar rats and then used this model to compare the effects of an α2C AR antagonist (ORM-13070 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg s.c.) with an α7 nAChR partial agonist (EVP-6124 0.3 mg/kg s.c.) and three atypical antipsychotics (clozapine 2.5 mg/kg i.p., risperidone 0.04 and 0.08 mg/kg s.c., olanzapine 0.125 and 0.5 mg/kg s.c.) on social interaction behavior.
Acute PCP (1.5 mg/kg s.c.) produced robust and reproducible deficits in social interaction behavior without affecting locomotor activity. The selective α2C AR antagonist significantly ameliorated PCP-induced social interaction deficits. In contrast, neither the partial α7 nAChR agonist nor any of the three atypical antipsychotics were able to reverse the behavioral deficits at the selected doses.
Our findings confirm that α2C AR antagonism is a potential mechanism for the treatment of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.
Medication administration errors may contribute to patient mortality, thus additional understanding of such incidents is required.
To analyse medication administration errors reported in acute care resulting in death, to identify the drugs concerned, and to describe medication administration error characteristics (location of error, error type, patient's age) by drug group.
Medication administration errors reported in acute care in 2007 ̶ 2016 (n = 517,384) were obtained from the National Reporting and Learning System for England and Wales. Incidents reported as resulting in death (n = 229) were analysed. Drugs were classified by two researchers using the British National Formulary. Drug categories were described by medication administration errors' year, location, patient age, and error category based on the incidents' original classification.
Errors were most often reported on wards (66.4%, n = 152), and in patients aged over 75 years (41.5%, n = 95). The most common error category was omitted medicine or ingredient (31.4%, n = 72); most common drug groups were cardiovascular (20.1%, n = 46) and nervous system (10.0%, n = 23). Most errors in patients under 12 years concerned drugs to treat infection; cardiovascular drugs were most common among other age groups.
In order to prevent these most serious of medication administration errors, interventions should focus on avoiding dose omissions, and administration of drugs for patients over 75 years old, as well as safe administration of parenteral anticoagulants and antibacterial drugs.
Statins are effective drugs used to prevent and treat cardiovascular diseases but their effects in the absence of low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and on the risk of diabetes are not yet well characterized. The aim of this study was to clarify systemic and pleiotropic effects of rosuvastatin on cardiovascular and diabetic phenotypes. IGF-II/LDLR-/-ApoB100/100 hypercholesterolemic prediabetic mice were used to test the effects of rosuvastatin on plasma glucose, insulin, lipids, atherosclerosis and liver steatosis. To get a more comprehensive view about changes in gene expression RNA-sequencing was done from the liver. Rosuvastatin significantly reduced plasma cholesterol in hypercholesterolemic mice in the absence of LDLR but had no effects on atherosclerosis at aortic sinus level or in coronary arteries. Rosuvastatin also significantly reduced liver steatosis without any harmful effects on glucose or insulin metabolism. RNA-sequencing showed relatively specific effects of rosuvastatin on genes involved in cholesterol metabolism together with a significant anti-inflammatory gene expression profile in the liver. In addition, significant changes were found in the expression of Perilipin 4 and 5 which are involved in lipid droplet formation in the liver. For the first time it could be shown that Tribbles proteins are affected by rosuvastatin treatment in the hyperlipidemic mice. Rosuvastatin had several positive effects on hypercholesterolemic mice showing early signs of diabetes, many of which are unrelated to cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism. These results increase our understanding about the systemic and pleiotropic effects of rosuvastatin in the absence of LDLR expression.
Rigid plate fixation (RPF) is the cornerstone in managing fractures and osteotomies except for sternotomy, where most cardiac surgeons continue to use wire cerclage (WC). Results of a multicenter randomized trial evaluating sternal healing, sternal complications, patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), and costs after sternotomy closure with RPF or WC are summarized here.
Twelve US centers randomized 236 patients to either RPF (n=116) or WC (n=120). The primary endpoint, sternal healing at 6 months, was evaluated by a core laboratory using computed tomography and a validated 6-point scale (greater scores represent greater healing). Secondary endpoints assessed through 6 months included sternal complications and PROMs. Costs from the time of sternal closure through 90 days and 6 months were analyzed by a health economic core laboratory.
RPF compared to WC resulted in better sternal healing scores at 3 (2.6±1.1 vs. 1.8±1.0; P&lt;0.0001) and 6 months (3.8±1.0 vs. 3.3±1.1; P=0.0007) and higher sternal union rates at 3 [41% (42/103) vs. 16% (16/102); P&lt;0.0001] and 6 months [80% (81/101) vs. 67% (67/100); P=0.03]. There were fewer sternal complications with RPF through 6 months [0% (0/116) vs. 5% (6/120); P=0.03] and a trend towards fewer sternal wound infections [0% (0/116) vs. 4.2% (5/120); P=0.06]. All PROMs including sternal pain, upper extremity function (UEF), and quality-of-life scores were numerically better in RPF patients compared to WC patients at all follow-up time points. Although RPF was associated with a trend toward higher index hospitalization costs, a trend towards lower follow-up costs resulted in total costs that were $1,888 less at 90 days in RPF patients compared to WC patients (95% CI: -$8,889 to $4,273; P=0.52) and $1,646 less at 6 months (95% CI: -$9,127 to $4,706; P=0.61).
Sternotomy closure with RPF resulted in significantly better sternal healing, fewer sternal complications, improved PROMs and was cost neutral through 90 days and 6 months compared to WC.
Tuberous sclerosis is associated with epilepsy that is often refractory. We examined cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations for neurotrophins, nerve growth factor (β-NGF) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) in children with infantile spasms between 1997 and 2010. We classified the patients as follows: tuberous sclerosis (n = 5), cryptogenic spasms (n = 6), postinfectious spasms (n = 5) and other symptomatic spasms (n = 22). We had 22 age- and sex-matched controls for CSF-NGF and 14 for CSF-IGF-1. The median of CSF-NGF was higher in those with tuberous sclerosis, 56 (minimum-maximum, 8.0-131) ng/L, in relative to age- and sex-matched controls, 6.7 (0.0-22) ng/L, and symptomatic infantile spasms, 0.0 (0.0-4.5) ng/L or cryptogenic cases of infantile spasms, 6.2 (3.9-8.8) ng/L, respectively. CSF-NGF were highest in children with postinfectious aetiology, 408 (89-778) ng/L. CSF-IGF-1 of tuberous sclerosis, 0.65 (0.35-0.98) μg/L, did not differ from the cryptogenic spasms, 0.68 (0.32-0.87) μg/L, or from age- and sex-matched controls 0.52 (0.22-0.77) μg/L. Patients with tuberous sclerosis and cryptogenic spasms had normal development prior the ACTH therapy. We suggest that increased CSF-NGF might indicate a persistent activation of inflammatory pathways in cortical tubers in tuberous sclerosis and this would reflect in CSF concentrations.
The purpose of this population-based case-control study was to evaluate analgesic use after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) caused by rupture of a saccular intracranial aneurysm (sIA).
The study consisted of 1187 patients alive 12 months after an sIA-SAH who were admitted to Kuopio University Hospital (KUH) between 1995 and 2014. Three controls, matched with age, sex, and birthplace, were included for each patient. Data on ruptured sIA cases admitted to KUH from a defined catchment population in Eastern Finland were obtained from the KUH intracranial aneurysm database. Analgesics were classified according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification system. Data on analgesic medication were retrieved from the Finnish national registry of prescribed medicines of the Social Insurance Institution of Finland.
Among 1187 patients with sIA-SAH who were alive 12 months after admission, 83 (7.0%) commenced analgesics use within 12 months after the sIA-SAH versus 53 (1.5%) of the 3561 population controls. The results revealed significantly greater initiation rate of analgesic use among patients with sIA-SAH within a year after sIA-SAH as compared with that of matched population controls (odds ratio 5.0; 95% confidence interval 3.5-7.0; P &lt; 0.001). Analgesic use commencement within 12 months of an sIA-SAH was independently associated with the presence of an intracerebral hematoma. Among patients, commencing analgesic use increased 11% when we compared a year before and a year after sIA-SAH.
Our results indicate that patients with sIA-SAH had an increased risk for new pain after sIA-SAH as compared with that of matched control population.
Atherosclerosis is characterized by the accumulation of oxidized lipids in the artery wall, which triggers an inflammatory response. Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) presents amyloid-like structural properties, and different amyloid species have recently been recognized in atherosclerotic plaques. Therefore, we studied the uptake of the amyloid imaging agent [18F]Flutemetamol in atherosclerotic plaques. The binding of [18F]Flutemetamol to human carotid artery plaque was studied in vitro. In vivo uptake of the tracer was studied in hypercholesterolemic IGF-II/LDLR-/-ApoB100/100 mice and C57BL/6N controls. Tracer biodistribution was studied in vivo with PET/CT, and ex vivo by gamma counter and digital ex vivo autoradiography. The presence of amyloid, ox-LDL, and macrophages in the plaques was examined by immunohistochemistry. [18F]Flutemetamol showed specific accumulation in human carotid plaque, especially in areas positive for amyloid beta. The aortas of IGF-II/LDLR-/-ApoB100/100 mice showed large thioflavin-S-positive atherosclerotic plaques containing ox-LDL and macrophages. Autoradiography revealed 1.7-fold higher uptake in the plaques than in a lesion-free vessel wall, but no difference in aortic tissue uptake between mouse strains were observed in the in vivo PET/CT. In conclusion, [18F]Flutemetamol binds to amyloid-positive areas in human atherosclerotic plaques. Further studies are warranted to clarify the uptake mechanisms, and the potential of the tracer for in vivo imaging of atherosclerosis in patients.
Several amino acids have been shown to be associated with insulin resistance and increased risk of type 2 diabetes, but none of previous studies has investigated the association of amino acids with insulin secretion in a longitudinal setting. Our study included 5181 participants of the cross-sectional METabolic Syndrome In Men study having metabolomics data on twenty amino acids. A total of 4851 of them had a 4.6-year follow-up visit. Nine amino acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan, tyrosine, alanine, isoleucine, leucine, valine, aspartate and glutamate) were significantly (P&lt;5.8x10-5) associated with decreases in insulin secretion (Disposition index) and the elevation of fasting or 2 hour glucose levels. Five of these amino acids (tyrosine, alanine, isoleucine, aspartate and glutamate) were also found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of incident type 2 diabetes after adjustment for confounding factors. Our study is the first population-based large cohort to report that amino acids are not only associated with insulin resistance but also with decreased insulin secretion.
The infrapatellar fat pad (IFP) of the knee joint has received lots of attention recently due to its emerging role in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA), where it displays an inflammatory phenotype. The aim of the present study was to examine the infrapatellar fatty acid (FA) composition in a rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) model of early OA created by anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT).
OA was induced randomly in the left or right knee joint of skeletally mature New Zealand White rabbits by ACLT, while the contralateral knee was left intact. A separate group of unoperated rabbits served as controls. The IFP of the ACLT, contralateral, and control knees were harvested following euthanasia 2 or 8 weeks post-ACLT and their FA composition was determined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
The n-3/n-6 polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) ratio shifted in a pro-inflammatory direction after ACLT, already observed 2 weeks after the operation (0.20 ± 0.008 vs. 0.18 ± 0.009). At 8 weeks, the FA profile of the ACLT group was characterized with increased percentages of 20:4n-6 (0.44 ± 0.064 vs. 0.98 ± 0.339 mol-%) and 22:6n-3 (0.03 ± 0.014 vs. 0.07 ± 0.015 mol-%) and with decreased monounsaturated FA (MUFA) sums (37.19 ± 1.586 vs. 33.20 ± 1.068 mol-%) and n-3/n-6 PUFA ratios (0.20 ± 0.008 vs. 0.17 ± 0.008). The FA signature of the contralateral knees resembled that of the unoperated controls in most aspects, but had increased proportions of total n-3 PUFA and reduced MUFA sums.
These findings provide novel information on the effects of early OA on the infrapatellar FA profile in the rabbit ACLT model. The reduction in the n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio of the IFP is in concordance with the inflammation and cartilage degradation in early OA and could contribute to disease pathogenesis.
Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent environmental pollutants that are still causing potentially harmful effects to humans and wildlife. While the adverse health effects of PCBs have been extensively studied for decades, little is known about the effects specifically caused by the less potent, yet abundant non-dioxin-like congeners (NDL-PCBs). Here a non-targeted metabolic profiling of rat offspring exposed in utero and lactationally to total doses of 0, 300 or 1000 mg/kg body weight of ultrapure PCB 180 is reported. Serum samples from 5 male, and 5 female offspring from each group taken 12 weeks after birth were analyzed using UHPLC-qTOF-MS system, and subsequent metabolite alterations were studied. Statistical analysis revealed gender and dose-dependent alterations in serum metabolite levels at doses that did not adversely influence maternal or offspring body weight development. Male rats exhibited a higher number of altered metabolites, as well as stronger dose-dependency. A total of 51 metabolites were identified based on spectral matching. Most notably, 20 of these were glycerophospholipids, mainly lysophosphocholines with systematically decreased concentrations especially in the high-dose males. Other major metabolite groups include amino acids, their derivatives and carnitines. Our findings are consistent with the earlier reported liver effects, as well as neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioral effects of PCB 180. They also emphasize the potential value of metabolomics in characterizing toxic effects and in identifying sensitive biomarkers with potential future use in health risk assessment.
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small vesicles involved in intercellular communication. Data is emerging that EVs and their cargo have potential as diagnostic biomarkers and treatments for brain diseases, including traumatic brain injury and epilepsy. Here, we summarize the current knowledge regarding changes in EV numbers and cargo in status epilepticus (SE) and traumatic brain injury (TBI), which are clinically significant etiologies for acquired epileptogenesis in animals and humans. We also review encouraging data, which suggests that EVs secreted by stem cells may serve as recovery-enhancing treatments for SE and TBI. Using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, we show that brain EV-related transcripts are positively enriched in rodent models of epileptogenesis and epilepsy, and altered in response to anti-seizure drugs. These data suggest that EVs show promise as biomarkers, treatments and drug targets for epilepsy. In parallel to gathering conceptual knowledge, analytics platforms for the isolation and analysis of EV contents need to be further developed.

Oxidative stress resulting from decreased antioxidant protection and increased reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) production may contribute to muscle mass loss and dysfunction during aging. Curcumin is a phenolic compound shown to upregulate antioxidant defenses and directly quench RONS in vivo. This study determined the impact of prolonged dietary curcumin exposure on muscle mass and function of aged rats. Thirty-two-month-old male F344xBN rats were provided a diet with or without 0.2% curcumin for 4 months. The groups included: ad libitum control (CON; n = 18); 0.2% curcumin (CUR; n = 18); and pair-fed (PAIR; n = 18) rats. CUR rats showed lower food intake compared to CON, making PAIR a suitable comparison group. CUR rats displayed larger plantaris mass and force production (vs. PAIR). Nuclear fraction levels of nuclear factor erythroid-2 related-factor-2 were greater, and oxidative macromolecule damage was lower in CUR (vs. PAIR). There were no significant differences in measures of antioxidant status between any of the groups. No difference in any measure was observed between CUR and CON rats. Thus, consumption of curcumin coupled with reduced food intake imparted beneficial effects on aged skeletal muscle. The benefit of curcumin on aging skeletal muscle should be explored further.
There is a current trend in pharmaceutical manufacturing to shift from traditional batch manufacture to continuous manufacturing. The purpose of this study was to test the ability of an integrated continuous direct compression (CDC) line, in relation to batch processing, to achieve consistent tablet quality over long processing periods for formulations with poor flow properties or with a tendency to segregate. The study design included four industrially relevant formulations with different segregation indices and flow properties induced through different grades of the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API), paracetamol, and major filler as well as varying the amount of API. The performance metrics investigated were content, uniformity of content, tablet weight, and tablet strength. The overall process stability over time was significantly improved with the CDC line as compared to the batch process. For all the formulations with a high API content, the CDC line provided better or equal uniformity of content and tablet weight as compared to batch. The CDC line was especially efficient in providing a stable content and tablet weight for poorly flowing formulations containing the standard, cohesive, grade of API. The only formulation that performed better in the batch process was the formulation with a low API content. Thus, for this formulation, the batch process achieved lower variation in tablet content since maintaining a low feed rate for the API proved challenging in the CDC line. In addition, some of the API became stuck in the CDC line between feeding and tableting, most likely at the funnel in the mixer inlet, highlighting the need for properly designed interfaces between units. The insensitivity of the CDC line towards poor flow indicates that one could use direct compression at high drug load compositions of poorly flowing powder blends that could not be processed via batch manufacturing.
There is currently great interest in replacing fossil-oil with renewable fuels in energy production. Fast pyrolysis bio-oil (FPBO) made of lignocellulosic biomass is one such alternative to replace fossil oil, such as heavy fuel oil (HFO), in energy boilers. However, it is not known how this fuel change will alter the quantity and quality of emissions affecting human health. In this work, particulate emissions from a real-scale commercially operated FPBO boiler plant are characterized, including extensive physico-chemical and toxicological analyses. These are then compared to emission characteristics of heavy fuel-oil and wood fired boilers. Finally, the effects of the fuel choice on the emissions, their potential health effects and the requirements for flue gas cleaning in small-to medium-sized boiler units are discussed. The total suspended particulate matter and fine particulate matter (PM1) concentrations in FPBO boiler flue gases before filtration were higher than in HFO boilers and lower or on a level similar to wood-fired grate boilers. FPBO particles consisted mainly of ash species and contained less polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and heavy metals than had previously been measured from HFO combustion. This feature was clearly reflected in the toxicological properties of FPBO particle emissions, which showed less acute toxicity effects on the cell line than HFO combustion particles. The electrostatic precipitator used in the boiler plant efficiently removed flue gas particles of all sizes. Only minor differences in the toxicological properties of particles upstream and downstream of the electrostatic precipitator were observed, when the same particulate mass from both situations was given to the cells.
Polyphenols synthesized by plants and fungi have various pharmacological effects. The ability of polyphenols to modulate sirtuins has gained considerable interest due to the role of sirtuins in aging, insulin sensitivity, lipid metabolism, inflammation, and cancer. In particular, sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) has gained importance in regulating a variety of cellular processes, including genomic stability and glucose metabolism. On the other hand, quercetin has been demonstrated to modulate sirtuins and to protect against several chronic diseases. In this study, two quercetin derivatives, diquercetin and 2-chloro-1,4-naphtoquinone-quercetin, were identified as promising SIRT6 inhibitors with IC50 values of 130 μM and 55 μM, respectively. 2-Chloro-1,4-naphtoquinone-quercetin also showed potent inhibition against SIRT2, with an IC50 value of 14 μM. Diquercetin increased the Km value of NAD+, whereas 2-chloro-1,4-naphthoquinone-quercetin increased the Km value of the acetylated substrate. Molecular docking studies suggest that diquercetin prefers the binding site of the nicotinamide (NAM) moiety, whereas 2-chloro-1,4-naphtoquinone-quercetin prefers to dock into the substrate binding site. Overall, the results of in vitro studies and molecular modeling indicate that diquercetin competes with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), whereas 2-chloro-1,4-naphthoquinone-quercetin competes with the acetylated substrate in the catalytic site of SIRT6. Natural polyphenolic compounds targeting sirtuins show promise as a new approach in the search for novel and effective treatments for age-related diseases.
Extracellular proteolysis initiated by the binding of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) to its receptor (uPAR) regulates the development of inhibitory neuronal circuits in the cerebral cortex and tissue remodeling after epileptogenic brain injury. To study the function of different components of the uPA-uPAR system on behavior and epileptogenesis, and to complement our previous studies on naïve and injured mice deficient in the uPA-encoding gene Plau or the uPAR-encoding gene Plaur, we analyzed the behavioral phenotype, seizure susceptibility, and perineuronal nets surrounding parvalbumin-positive inhibitory interneurons in Plau and Plaur (double knockout dKO) mice. In a climbing test, dKO mice showed reduced interest towards the environment as compared with Wt mice (p &lt; 0.01). In a social approach test, however, dKO mice spent more time than Wt mice exploring the compartment containing a stranger mouse than the empty compartment (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, in a social interaction test, dKO mice exhibited increased contact time (p &lt; 0.01). Compared with Wt mice, the dKO mice also had a longer single contact duration (p &lt; 0.001) with the stranger mouse. In the elevated plus-maze, grooming, and marble burying tests, the anxiety level of dKO mice did not differ from that of Wt mice. Rearing time in an exploratory activity test, and spatial learning and memory in the Morris swim navigation task were also comparable between dKO and Wt mice. In the pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) seizure-susceptibility test, dKO mice had a shorter latency to the first epileptiform spike (p = 0.0001) and a greater total number of spikes (p &lt; 0.001) than Wt mice. The dKO genotype did not affect the number of cortical perineuronal nets. Our findings indicate that Plau/Plaur-deficiency leads to a more social phenotype toward other mice with diminished interest in the surrounding environment, and increased seizure susceptibility.
UDP-sugars are important substrates for the synthesis of various cellular glycans and glycoconjugates, many of which play essential roles in the pathobiology of diseases associated with deranged glucose metabolism, such as cancer and type 2 diabetes. Hence, their analysis from cultured cells and especially from tissue samples can give valuable information. This chapter describes a method for UDP-sugar isolation from various sources utilizing ion-pair solid-phase extraction with graphitized carbon cartridges, and their analysis using anion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography.
The StopDia study is based on the convincing scientific evidence that type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its comorbidities can be prevented by a healthy lifestyle. The need for additional research is based on the fact that the attempts to translate scientific evidence into actions in the real-world health care have not led to permanent and cost-effective models to prevent T2D. The specific aims of the StopDia study following the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework are to 1) improve the Reach of individuals at increased risk, 2) evaluate the Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the digital lifestyle intervention and the digital and face-to-face group lifestyle intervention in comparison to routine care in a randomized controlled trial (RCT), and 3) evaluate the Adoption and Implementation of the StopDia model by the participants and the health care organizations at society level. Finally, we will address the Maintenance of the lifestyle changes at participant level and that of the program at organisatory level after the RCT.
The StopDia study is carried out in the primary health care system as part of the routine actions of three provinces in Finland, including Northern Savo, Southern Carelia, and Päijät-Häme. We estimate that one fifth of adults aged 18-70 years living in these areas are at increased risk of T2D. We recruit the participants using the StopDia Digital Screening Tool, including questions from the Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC). About 3000 individuals at increased risk of T2D (FINDRISC ≥12 or a history of gestational diabetes, impaired fasting glucose, or impaired glucose tolerance) participate in the one-year randomized controlled trial. We monitor lifestyle factors using the StopDia Digital Questionnaire and metabolism using laboratory tests performed as part of routine actions in the health care system.
Sustainable and scalable models are needed to reach and identify individuals at increased risk of T2D and to deliver personalized and effective lifestyle interventions. With the StopDia study we aim to answer these challenges in a scientific project that is fully digitally integrated into the routine health care.

Although hybridization between populations with low genetic diversity may induce heterosis, it can also lead to reduced fitness of hybrid offspring through outbreeding depression and loss of local adaptations. Using a half-sib mating design, we studied on brown trout (Salmo trutta) how hybridization of migratory hatchery-strain females with males from various strains would affect early mortality, growth and personality in F1 offspring. No differences in mortality or alevin body length were found between the crossing groups by the end of the yolk-sac stage. At later developmental stages, higher mortality and slower growth in one of the geographically distant hybrid groups indicated potential outbreeding depression. The personality component indicating boldness and exploration tendency showed fairly low genetic variation and no phenotypic differences among the crossing groups while the personality component related to freezing behavior indicated stronger freezing responses in the purebred and local cross strain when compared to the two other strains. However, the purebred hatchery strain possessed stronger additive genetic tendency for boldness and explorative behavior, and weaker genetic tendency for freezing behavior, when compared to the wild × hatchery hybrid group. Our results add to the cumulating evidence of risks related to the stocking of fish strains from non-native origins.
Glacial-interglacial variations in CO2 and methane in polar ice cores have been attributed, in part, to changes in global wetland extent, but the wetland distribution before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 21 ka to 18 ka) remains virtually unknown. We present a study of global peatland extent and carbon (C) stocks through the last glacial cycle (130 ka to present) using a newly compiled database of 1,063 detailed stratigraphic records of peat deposits buried by mineral sediments, as well as a global peatland model. Quantitative agreement between modeling and observations shows extensive peat accumulation before the LGM in northern latitudes (&gt;40°N), particularly during warmer periods including the last interglacial (130 ka to 116 ka, MIS 5e) and the interstadial (57 ka to 29 ka, MIS 3). During cooling periods of glacial advance and permafrost formation, the burial of northern peatlands by glaciers and mineral sediments decreased active peatland extent, thickness, and modeled C stocks by 70 to 90% from warmer times. Tropical peatland extent and C stocks show little temporal variation throughout the study period. While the increased burial of northern peats was correlated with cooling periods, the burial of tropical peat was predominately driven by changes in sea level and regional hydrology. Peat burial by mineral sediments represents a mechanism for long-term terrestrial C storage in the Earth system. These results show that northern peatlands accumulate significant C stocks during warmer times, indicating their potential for C sequestration during the warming Anthropocene.
Inefficient removal of dying retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells by professional phagocytes can result in debris formation and development of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Chronic oxidative stress and inflammation play an important role in AMD pathogenesis. Only a few well-established in vitro phagocytosis assay models exist. We propose human embryonic stem cell-derived-RPE cells as a new model for studying RPE cell removal by professional phagocytes. The characteristics of human embryonic stem cells-derived RPE (hESC-RPE) are similar to native RPEs based on their gene and protein expression profile, integrity, and barrier properties or regarding drug transport. However, no data exist about RPE death modalities and how efficiently dying hESC-RPEs are taken upby macrophages, and whether this process triggers an inflammatory responses. This study demonstrates hESC-RPEs can be induced to undergo anoikis or autophagy-associated cell death due to extracellular matrix detachment or serum deprivation and hydrogen-peroxide co-treatment, respectively, similar to primary human RPEs. Dying hESC-RPEs are efficiently engulfed by macrophages which results in high amounts of IL-6 and IL-8 cytokine release. These findings suggest that the clearance of anoikic and autophagy-associated dying hESC-RPEs can be used as a new model for investigating AMD pathogenesis or for testing the in vivo potential of these cells in stem cell therapy.
The aging process is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation in both humans and rodents, commonly called inflammaging. At the same time, there is a gradual decline in the functional capacity of adaptive and innate immune systems, i.e., immunosenescence, a process not only linked to the aging process, but also encountered in several pathological conditions involving chronic inflammation. The hallmarks of immunosenescence include a decline in the numbers of naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, an imbalance in the T cell subsets, and a decrease in T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire and signaling. Correspondingly, there is a decline in B cell lymphopoiesis and a reduction in antibody production. The age-related changes are not as profound in innate immunity as they are in adaptive immunity. However, there are distinct functional deficiencies in dendritic cells, natural killer cells, and monocytes/macrophages with aging. Interestingly, the immunosuppression induced by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in diverse inflammatory conditions also targets mainly the T and B cell compartments, i.e., inducing very similar alterations to those present in immunosenescence. Here, we will compare the immune profiles induced by immunosenescence and the MDSC-driven immunosuppression. Given that the appearance of MDSCs significantly increases with aging and MDSCs are the enhancers of other immunosuppressive cells, e.g., regulatory T cells (Tregs) and B cells (Bregs), it seems likely that MDSCs might remodel the immune system, thus preventing excessive inflammation with aging. We propose that MDSCs are potent inducers of immunosenescence.
Facial folds and creases are established descriptive anatomical terms for structures of which the morphological characteristics and origins are not clearly defined. The aim of this study was to perform a morphological investigation of the nasolabial fold (NLF), mandibular fold (MF), deep transverse forehead (DTFC), infraorbital fold (IOF) and upper eyelid fold (UEF), correlating their phenotypes to differences in the superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS), noting morphological differences and similarities. Full-graft tissue blocks of skin, subcutaneous tissue, and mimic muscles collected postmortem were studied histologically. Serial histological sections were stained with Azan. Location- and composition-specific morphological differences were determined. Histological serial section digitalization and three-dimensional reconstruction of the tissue blocks were performed. Three different types of SMAS architecture were identified. Type I SMAS consisted of parallel-aligned fibrous septa connecting the mimic muscles to the skin that covered the cheek, infraorbital and supraorbital, and forehead areas. Type II SMAS morphology appeared as a condensed Type I SMAS architecture with stronger fibrous septa and smaller fatty tissue compartments covering the lower and upper lip areas. Type III SMAS consisted of loose connective tissue covering the lower and upper eyelid regions. NLF, MF, IOF, and UEF are habitual primary folds induced by morphological changes in the underlying SMAS architecture. The secondary, accidental creases (DTFC) are cutaneous depressions derived from interacting dermal-skeletal-muscular changes without SMAS structure changes. The upper and lower eyelid wrinkles were tertiary, age-related undulating skin redundancy formations. Clin. Anat. 32:573-584, 2019. © 2019 The Authors.

Injuries caused by falling are a major health concern among older population. For older people, falls are the leading cause of head injuries; especially, persons with cognitive disorders have an increased risk of falling.
To compare the incidence of head injury and traumatic brain injury (TBI) among persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD) with persons without AD.
This register-based study was conducted on a nationwide cohort, which includes all community-dwelling persons diagnosed with AD in Finland in 2005-2011. Persons with previous head injuries were excluded, leaving 67 172 persons with AD. For each person with AD, a matching person without AD and previous head injury were identified with respect to age, sex and university hospital district. The Cox proportional hazard model and competing risk analyses were used to estimate HR for head injury and TBI.
Persons with AD had 1.34-fold (95% CI 1.29 to 1.40) risk of head injuries and 1.49-fold (95% CI 1.40 to 1.59) risk of TBIs after accounting for competing risks of death and full adjustment by socioeconomic status, drug use and comorbidities.
Persons with AD are more likely to have a head injury or TBI incident than persons without AD.
Androgen receptor (AR) is regulated by SUMOylation at its transactivation domain. In vitro, the SUMOylation is linked to transcriptional repression and/or target gene-selective regulation. Here, we generated a mouse model (ArKI) in which the conserved SUMO acceptor lysines of AR are permanently abolished (ArK381R, K500R). ArKI males develop normally, without apparent defects in their systemic androgen action in reproductive tissues. However, the ArKI males are infertile. Their spermatogenesis appears unaffected, but their epididymal sperm maturation is defective, shown by severely compromised motility and fertilization capacity of the sperm. Fittingly, their epididymal AR chromatin-binding and gene expression associated with sperm maturation and function are misregulated. AR is SUMOylated in the wild-type epididymis but not in the testis, which could explain the tissue-specific response to the lack of AR SUMOylation. Our studies thus indicate that epididymal AR SUMOylation is essential for the post-testicular sperm maturation and normal reproductive capability of male mice.
A facile and sustainable electrochemical umpolung of bromide ion protocol was developed under mild reaction conditions. Transition metal catalysts and exogenous chemical oxidants were obviated for the bromination of C⁻H bond. Notably, graphite rod, which is commercially available at supermarkets and is inexpensive, was employed as the electrode material. This operationally easy and environmentally friendly approach accomplished the synthesis of 3-bromoindole in excellent yield and regioselectivity.
Recent discovery of mechanosensitive Piezo receptors in trigeminal ganglia suggested the novel molecular candidate for generation of migraine pain. However, the contribution of Piezo channels in migraine pathology was not tested yet. Therefore, in this study, we explored a potential involvement of Piezo channels in peripheral trigeminal nociception implicated in generation of migraine pain.
We used immunohistochemistry, calcium imaging, calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) release assay and electrophysiology in mouse and rat isolated trigeminal neurons and rat hemiskulls to study action of various stimulants of Piezo receptors on migraine-related peripheral nociception.
We found that essential (35%) fraction of isolated rat trigeminal neurons responded to chemical Piezo1 agonist Yoda1 and about a half of Yoda1 positive neurons responded to hypo-osmotic solution (HOS) and a quarter to mechanical stimulation by focused ultrasound (US). In ex vivo hemiskull preparation, Yoda1 and HOS largely activated persistent nociceptive firing in meningeal branches of trigeminal nerve. By using our novel cluster analysis of pain spikes, we demonstrated that 42% of fibers responded to Piezo1 agonist and 20% of trigeminal fibers were activated by Yoda1 and by capsaicin, suggesting expression of Piezo receptors in TRPV1 positive peptidergic nociceptive nerve fibers. Consistent with this, Yoda1 promoted the release of the key migraine mediator CGRP from hemiskull preparation.
Taken together, our data suggest the involvement of mechanosensitive Piezo receptors, in particular, Piezo1 subtype in peripheral trigeminal nociception, which provides a new view on mechanotransduction in migraine pathology and suggests novel molecular targets for anti-migraine medicine.
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their interactions with recipient cells constitute a rapidly growing research area. However, due to the limitations in current methodologies, the mechanisms of these interactions are still unclear. Microscopic studies of EVs are challenging, because their typical diameter is near the resolution limit of light microscopy, and electron microscopy has restricted possibilities for protein labelling. The objective of this study was to combine these two techniques to demonstrate in detail the interactions of EVs by recipient cells. Hyaluronan synthase 3 (HAS3) is an integral transmembrane protein that is enriched in EVs. In this work, GFP-HAS3 was utilized to study the interactions of EVs with the recipient cells. Surprisingly, confocal analysis correlation with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that most of the EVs were indeed lying on the recipient cell's plasma membrane, while the level of EV-derived intracellular signal was low. Immunoelectron microscopy supported this finding. Furthermore, hyaluronan oligosaccharides decreased the numbers of bound EVs, suggesting that CD44 participates in the regulation of their binding. This study indicates that correlative light and electron microscopy is a reliable method to analyze EV interactions with recipient cells. Detailed 3D confocal imaging of EV carrying a GFP-label on their plasma membrane combined with high-resolution electron microscopy provides significantly more information than either of the techniques alone. In the future studies it is crucial to utilize these techniques and their combinations to solve in detail the ambiguous fate of EV in target cells. Furthermore, live cell imaging at high resolution will be required to obtain definite answers on the detailed mechanisms of binding, fusion and endocytosis of EVs.
Ocular drugs are usually delivered locally to the eye. Required drug loading, release rate, and ocular retention time of drug delivery systems depend on the potency, bioavailability, and clearance of the drug at the target site. Drug-loading capacity of the formulation is limited by the material properties and size constraints of the eye. The design aid described herein for ocular drug delivery systems guides the calculation of steady-state drug concentrations in the ocular compartments, taking into account drug dose, bioavailability, and clearance. The dosing rate can be adjusted to reach the target drug concentrations, thereby guiding the design of drug delivery systems for topical, intravitreal, and subconjunctival administration. The simple design aid can be used at early stages of drug development by investigators without expertise in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling.
HIF prolyl 4-hydroxylases (HIFP4Hs, also known as PHDs and EGLNs) are crucial enzymes that modulate the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) response and help to maintain cellular oxygen homeostasis. This function is especially well-known for cytoplasmic or nuclear enzymes HIFP4H-1-3 (PHDs 1-3, EglNs 2, 1 and 3, respectively), but the physiological role is still obscure for a fourth suggested HIFP4H, P4H-TM that is a transmembrane protein and resides in the endoplasmic reticulum. Recently however, both experimental and clinical evidence of the P4H-TM involvement in CNS physiology has emerged. In this study, we first investigated the expression pattern of P4H-TM in the mouse brain and found a remarkably selective abundance in brains areas that are involved in social behaviors and anxiety including amygdala, lateral septum and bed nucleus of stria terminalis. Next, we performed behavioral assays in P4h-tm-/- mice to investigate a possible phenotype associated to these brain areas. In locomotor activity tests, we found that P4h-tm-/- mice were significantly more active than their wild-type (WT) littermate mice, and habituation to test environment did not abolish this effect. Instead, spatial learning and memory seemed normal in P4h-tm-/- mice as assessed by Morris swim task. In several tests assessing anxiety and fear responses, P4h-tm-/- mice showed distinct courageousness, and they presented increased interaction towards fellow mice in social behavior tests. Most strikingly, P4h-tm-/- mice practically lacked behavioral despair response, a surrogate marker of depression, in forced swim and tail suspension tests. Instead, mutant mice of all other Hif-p4h isoforms lacked such a behavioral phenotype. In summary, this study presents a remarkable anatomy-physiology association between the brain expression of P4H-TM and the behavioral phenotype in P4h-tm-/- mice. Future studies will reveal whether P4H-TM may serve as a novel target for anti-depressant and anti-anxiety pharmacotherapy.
Like any genome, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) also requires the action of topoisomerases to resolve topological problems in its maintenance, but for a long time, little was known about mitochondrial topoisomerases. The last years have brought a closer insight into the function of these fascinating enzymes in mtDNA topology regulation, replication, transcription, and segregation. Here, we summarize the current knowledge about mitochondrial topoisomerases, paying special attention to mammalian mitochondrial genome maintenance. We also discuss the open gaps in the existing knowledge of mtDNA topology control and the potential involvement of mitochondrial topoisomerases in human pathologies. While Top1mt, the only exclusively mitochondrial topoisomerase in mammals, has been studied intensively for nearly a decade, only recent studies have shed some light onto the mitochondrial function of Top2β and Top3α, enzymes that are shared between nucleus and mitochondria. Top3α mediates the segregation of freshly replicated mtDNA molecules, and its dysfunction leads to mtDNA aggregation and copy number depletion in patients. Top2β, in contrast, regulates mitochondrial DNA replication and transcription through the alteration of mtDNA topology, a fact that should be acknowledged due to the frequent use of Topoisomerase 2 inhibitors in medical therapy.
To investigate the feasibility of near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy for evaluation of human articular cartilage biomechanical properties during arthroscopy.
A novel arthroscopic NIR probe designed in our research group was utilized by an experienced orthopedic surgeon to measure NIR spectra from articular cartilage of human knee joints (n=18) at several measurement locations during an arthroscopic surgery performed on cadavers (ex vivo). Osteochondral samples (n=265) were extracted from the measurement sites for reference analysis. The NIR spectra were remeasured in a controlled laboratory environment (in vitro), after which cartilage thickness and biomechanical properties were determined. Hybrid multivariate regression models based on principal component analysis and linear mixed effects modeling (PCA-LME) were utilized to relate cartilage in vitro spectra and biomechanical properties, as well as to account for the spatial dependency. Additionally, a k-nearest neighbors (kNN) classifier was employed to reject outlying ex vivo spectra resulting from a non-optimal probe-cartilage contact. Model performance was evaluated for both in vitro and ex vivo NIR spectra via Spearman's rank correlation (ρ) and ratio of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ).
Regression models accurately predicted cartilage thickness and biomechanical properties from in vitro NIR spectra (Model: 0.77≤ρ≤0.87, 2.03≤RPIQ≤3.0; Validation: 0.74≤ρ≤0.84, 1.87≤ RPIQ≤2.90). Predictions of cartilage properties from ex vivo NIR spectra (0.52≤ρ≤0.87 and 1.06≤RPIQ≤1.88) was aided by a kNN classifier.
Arthroscopic NIR spectroscopy could substantially enhance identification of damaged cartilage by enabling quantitative evaluation of cartilage biomechanical properties. The results demonstrate the capacity of NIR spectroscopy in clinical applications.
Assessing movement over 24 hours increases our understanding of the total physical activity level and its patterns. In the FinHealth 2017 Survey, a population-based health examination study, 940 participants between 25 and 93 years were instructed to wear an accelerometer (Actigraph GT9X Link) on their non-dominant wrist for 24 hours on 7 consecutive days. Physical activity information was extracted from 100-Hz triaxial 60-second epoch data as average vector magnitude counts per minute (VM cpm). Results were analyzed by gender, 10-year age-groups, employment status, and education. Hourly means were plotted and compared. Analyses included 915 participants (44% men) who wore the device at least 10 hours on 4 or more days, with mean wear time being 149.5 hours (standard deviation of 615.2 minutes).Women had higher average VM cpm than men (p &lt; 0.001), with significant gender differences in all age-groups until 65 years and older. Total physical activity was lower with age, unemployment, and retirement, where the hourly patterns mirrored the findings. Our findings agree with previous large-scale wrist-accelerometry data, but extend current knowledge by providing data on gender and socioeconomic variation in physical activity across 24 hours in a population-based adult sample representing a broad age range.
Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the brain. They were long considered only as passive support for neuronal cells. However, recent data have revealed many active roles for these cells both in maintenance of the normal physiological homeostasis in the brain as well as in neurodegeneration and disease. Moreover, human astrocytes have been found to be much more complex than their rodent counterparts, and to date, astrocytes are known to actively participate in a multitude of processes such as neurotransmitter uptake and recycling, gliotransmitter release, neuroenergetics, inflammation, modulation of synaptic activity, ionic balance, maintenance of the blood-brain barrier, and many other crucial functions of the brain. This review focuses on the role of astrocytes in human neurodegenerative disease and the potential of the novel stem cell-based platforms in modeling astrocytic functions in health and in disease.
Sports nutrition products are developed and targeted mainly for athletes to improve their nutrient intake, performance, and muscle growth. The fastest growing consumer groups for these products are recreational sportspeople and lifestyle users. Although athletes may have elevated physiological protein requirements and they may benefit from dietary supplements, the evidence regarding the role of dietary protein and supplements in the nutrition of recreational sportspeople and sedentary populations is somewhat complex and contradictory. In high-protein diets, more undigested protein-derived constituents end up in the large intestine compared to moderate or low-protein diets, and hence, more bacterial amino acid metabolism takes place in the colon, having both positive and negative systemic and metabolic effects on the host. The aim of the present review is to summarize the impact of the high-protein products and diets on nutrition and health, in sportspeople and in sedentary consumers. We are opening the debate about the current protein intake recommendations, with an emphasis on evidence-based effects on intestinal microbiota and personalized guidelines regarding protein and amino acid supplementation in sportspeople and lifestyle consumers.
We investigated the association between thiazide use and the risk of low-energy fractures among community dwellers with Alzheimer's disease. Longer use was associated with a decreased risk of low-energy fractures. This study extends the previous knowledge of reduced fracture risk of thiazides to persons with Alzheimer's disease.
To investigate the association between thiazide use and the risk of low-energy fractures (LEF), and hip fracture among community dwellers with Alzheimer's disease (AD). No prior study has evaluated the effect of thiazides on LEF risk of AD patients.
LEF cases were identified from the MEDALZ study, including all community-dwelling persons diagnosed with AD in Finland 2005-2011. During the follow-up from AD diagnoses until the end of 2015, cases with LEF (N = 10,416) and hip fracture (N = 5578) were identified. LEF cases were matched with up to three controls without LEF, according to time since AD diagnosis, age and gender. Thiazide use identified from the Prescription register data was modeled with PRE2DUP method. Current use was defined in 0-30 days' time window before the fracture/matching date, and duration of current use was assessed. The association between thiazide exposure and LEFs was assessed with conditional logistic regression.
Current thiazide use was observed in 10.5% of LEF cases and 12.5% of controls. Current thiazide use was associated with a decreased risk of LEF (adjusted OR [aOR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.77-0.88). In terms of the duration of use, no association was observed with short-term use (&lt; 1 year or 1-3 years), while longer use (&gt; 3 years) was associated with a reduced risk of LEF (aOR 0.77, 95% CI 0.71-0.83) and hip fracture (aOR 0.68, 95% CI 0.60-0.78).
Our study extends the previous knowledge of reduced fracture risk of thiazides to persons with AD, a population with significantly increased background risk of fractures.
The function of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluR1 and mGluR5 is involved in the hyperglutamatergic state caused by chronic alcohol. Preclinical studies suggest that group I mGluR modulation could serve as a novel treatment of alcoholism. Considering the wide role of glutamatergic neurochemistry in addiction, group I mGluR binding was studied in brain areas involved in decision-making, learning and memory. Post-mortem whole hemisphere autoradiography was used to study the binding density of [³H]quisqualic acid, a potent group I mGluR agonist, in 9 Cloninger type 1 alcoholics, 8 Cloninger type 2 alcoholics and 10 controls. Binding was studied in the dorsal striatum, hippocampus and cortex. Alcoholics displayed a trend towards increased [³H]quisqualic acid binding in all brain areas. The most robust findings were in the putamen (p = 0.006) and anterior insula (p = 0.005), where both alcoholic subtypes displayed increased binding compared to the controls. These findings suggest altered group I mGluR function in alcoholic subjects in the dorsal striatum, which is involved in habitual learning, and in the anterior insula, which has a pivotal role in the perception of bodily sensations. Increased [³H]quisqualic acid binding might suggest a beneficial impact of mGluR1/5 modulators in the treatment of alcoholism.
Axonal structure underlies white matter functionality and plays a major role in brain connectivity. The current literature on the axonal structure is based on the analysis of two-dimensional (2D) cross-sections, which, as we demonstrate, is precarious. To be able to quantify three-dimensional (3D) axonal morphology, we developed a novel pipeline, called ACSON (AutomatiC 3D Segmentation and morphometry Of axoNs), for automated 3D segmentation and morphometric analysis of the white matter ultrastructure. The automated pipeline eliminates the need for time-consuming manual segmentation of 3D datasets. ACSON segments myelin, myelinated and unmyelinated axons, mitochondria, cells and vacuoles, and analyzes the morphology of myelinated axons. We applied the pipeline to serial block-face scanning electron microscopy images of the corpus callosum of sham-operated (n = 2) and brain injured (n = 3) rats 5 months after the injury. The 3D morphometry showed that cross-sections of myelinated axons were elliptic rather than circular, and their diameter varied substantially along their longitudinal axis. It also showed a significant reduction in the myelinated axon diameter of the ipsilateral corpus callosum of rats 5 months after brain injury, indicating ongoing axonal alterations even at this chronic time-point.
Studies of chronic epilepsy show pathological high frequency oscillations (HFOs) are associated with brain areas capable of generating epileptic seizures. Only a few of these studies have focused on HFOs during the development of epilepsy, but results suggest pathological HFOs could be a biomarker of epileptogenesis. The Epilepsy Bioinformatics Study for Antiepileptogenic Therapy" (EpiBioS4Rx) is a multi-center project designed to identify biomarkers of epileptogenesis after a traumatic brain injury (TBI) and evaluate treatments that could modify or prevent the development of post-traumatic epilepsy. One goal of the EpiBioS4Rx project is to assess whether HFOs could be a biomarker of post-traumatic epileptogenesis. The current study describes the work towards this goal, including the development of common surgical procedures and EEG protocols, an interim analysis of the EEG for HFOs, and identifying issues that need to be addressed for a robust biomarker analysis. At three participating sites - University of Eastern Finland (UEF), Monash University in Melbourne (Melbourne) and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) - TBI was induced in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats by lateral fluid-percussion injury. After injury and in sham-operated controls, rats were implanted with screw and microwire electrodes positioned in neocortex and hippocampus to record EEG. A separate group of rats had serial magnetic resonance imaging after injury and then implanted with electrodes at 6 months. Recordings 28 days post-injury were available from UEF and UCLA, but not Melbourne due to technical issues with their EEG files. Analysis of recordings from 4 rats - UEF and UCLA each had one TBI and one sham-operated control - showed EEG contained evidence of HFOs. Computer-automated algorithms detected a total of 1,819 putative HFOs and of these only 40 events (2%) were detected by all three sites. Manual review of all events verified 130 events as HFO and the remainder as false positives. Review of the 40 events detected by all three sites was associated with 88% agreement. This initial report from the EpiBioS4Rx Consortium demonstrates the standardization of EEG electrode placements, recording protocol and long-term EEG monitoring, and differences in detection algorithm HFO results between sites. Additional work on detection strategy, detection algorithm performance, and training in HFO review will be performed to establish a robust, preclinical evaluation of HFOs as a biomarker of post-traumatic epileptogenesis.
Protein kinase CK2 is an emerging target for therapeutic intervention in human diseases, particularly in cancer. Inhibitors of this enzyme are currently in clinical trials, indicating the druggability of human CK2. By virtual screening of the ZINC database, we found that the natural compound bikaverin can fit well in the ATP binding site of the target enzyme CK2. By further in vitro evaluation using CK2 holoenzyme, bikaverin turned to be a potent inhibitor with an IC50 value of 1.24 µM. In this work, the cell permeability of bikaverin was determined using a Caco-2 cell permeability assay as a prerequisite for cellular evaluation and the compound turned out to be cell permeable with a Papp- value of 4.46 × 10-6 cm/s. Bikaverin was tested for its effect on cell viability using a MTT assay and cell proliferation using an EdU assay in different cancer cell lines (MCF7, A427 and A431 cells). Cell viability and cell proliferation were reduced dramatically after treatment with 10 µM bikaverin for 24 h. Additionally the IncuCyte® live-cell imaging system was applied for monitoring the cytotoxicity of bikaverin in the three tested cancer cell lines. Finally, molecular dynamic studies were performed to clarify the ligand binding mode of bikaverin at the ATP binding site of CK2 and to identify the amino acids involved.
We report on a selective paper-based method and a microfluidic paper-based analytical device (μPAD) for the detection of human plasma glucose and tear glucose using carbopol polymer-encapsulated Au(I) complex (AuC₂C₆H₄OMe)₂(Ph₂P(C₆H₄)₃PPh₂), (B5). To the best of our knowledge, this demonstrates for the first time the glucose sensing based on dual emission, i.e., fluorescence and phosphorescence, of a single type molecule on the carbopol polymer. Upon addition of human blood treated with anticoagulants to μPADs, plasma is separated from the blood and flows into the response region of the μPADs to react with carbopol polymer-encapsulated B5, in which the ratiometric luminescence is analyzed. The plasma glucose concentration can be quantitively detected at 1.0⁻50.0 mM on paper, and tear glucose can be detected at 0.1⁻4.0 mM on μPADs. Owing to the structural design, this device has superior ratiometric changes of dual emission over other Au(I) complexes for signal transduction. The encapsulation of carbopol polymer also offers long-term storage stability. In tear measurement, carbopol polymer is not only used to encapsulate enzyme to remain the enzyme's activity, but also played as a glue (or media) to connect microfluidic channel and response region. This further improves the sensitivity and limit of detection for glucose. Moreover, this sensor provides a faster response time, a wider range for glucose sensing than reported previously, and no statistical difference of the data from a commercial glucometer, allowing for practical diagnosis of diabetes and healthy individuals.
