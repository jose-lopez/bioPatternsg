<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>	<meta charset="utf-8">	<title>generaci√≥n de archivo html</title></head><body>mRNA 5'-cap recognition by the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E has been exhaustively characterized with the aid of a novel fluorometric, time-synchronized titration method, and X-ray crystallography. The association constant values of recombinant eIF4E for 20 different cap analogues cover six orders of magnitude; with the highest affinity observed for m(7)GTP (approximately 1.1 x 10(8) M(-1)). The affinity of the cap analogues for eIF4E correlates with their ability to inhibit in vitro translation. The association constants yield contributions of non-covalent interactions involving single structural elements of the cap to the free energy of binding, giving a reliable starting point to rational drug design. The free energy of 7-methylguanine stacking and hydrogen bonding (-4.9 kcal/mol) is separate from the energies of phosphate chain interactions (-3.0, -1.9, -0.9 kcal/mol for alpha, beta, gamma phosphates, respectively), supporting two-step mechanism of the binding. The negatively charged phosphate groups of the cap act as a molecular anchor, enabling further formation of the intermolecular contacts within the cap-binding slot. Stabilization of the stacked Trp102/m(7)G/Trp56 configuration is a precondition to form three hydrogen bonds with Glu103 and Trp102. Electrostatically steered eIF4E-cap association is accompanied by additional hydration of the complex by approximately 65 water molecules, and by ionic equilibria shift. Temperature dependence reveals the enthalpy-driven and entropy-opposed character of the m(7)GTP-eIF4E binding, which results from dominant charge-related interactions (DeltaH degrees =-17.8 kcal/mol, DeltaS degrees= -23.6 cal/mol K). For recruitment of synthetic eIF4GI, eIF4GII, and 4E-BP1 peptides to eIF4E, all the association constants were approximately 10(7) M(-1), in decreasing order: eIF4GI&gt;4E-BP1&gt;eIF4GII approximately 4E-BP1(P-Ser65) approximately 4E-BP1(P-Ser65/Thr70). Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at Ser65 and Thr70 is insufficient to prevent binding to eIF4E. Enhancement of the eIF4E affinity for cap occurs after binding to eIF4G peptides.
In eukaryotic cells, protein synthesis is regulated by a set of initiation factors (eIF) that are required for recruiting the 40 S ribosomal subunit onto the mRNA molecule. Among these proteins, eIF4GI, which is targeted by picornaviral proteases, makes a bridge between the mRNA cap structure (via eIF4E) and the 40 S ribosome (via eIF3). Recently, internal ribosome entry segment (IRES) elements have been characterized in the genomic RNA of both simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), suggesting that viral expression of these two viruses can be regulated at the translational level. Thus, by analogy with members of the picornavirus family, we have investigated the action of the HIV-1 protease on initiation factors eIF4GI and eIF4GII using cell extracts and the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. Our results show that eIF4GI, but not eIF4GII, is substrate for HIV-1 protease and this effect can be prevented by a HIV-1 protease inhibitor, palinavir. However, in contrast to picornaviral proteases, the cleavage of eIF4GI by HIV-1 protease occurs at multiple sites and impairs translation of both cap-dependent and IRES-containing RNAs, except for the HCV IRES, which does not require eIF4GI or eIF4GII for activity.
A cell line was generated that expresses the poliovirus 2A protease in an inducible manner. Tightly controlled expression was achieved by utilizing the muristerone A-regulated expression system. Upon induction, cleavage of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4GI (eIF4GI) and eIF4GII is observed, with the latter being cleaved in a somewhat slower kinetics. eIF4G cleavage was accompanied by a severe inhibition of protein synthesis activity. Upon induction of the poliovirus 2A protease, the cells displayed fragmented nuclei, chromatin condensation, oligonucleosome-size DNA ladder, and positive TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling) staining; hence, their death can be characterized as apoptosis. These results indicate that the expression of the 2A protease in mammalian cells is sufficient to induce apoptosis. We suggest that the poliovirus 2A protease induces apoptosis either by arresting cap-dependent translation of some cellular mRNAs that encode proteins required for cell viability, by preferential cap-independent translation of cellular mRNAs encoding apoptosis inducing proteins, or by cleaving other, yet unidentified cellular target proteins.
Death-associated protein 5 (DAP5) (also named p97 and NAT1) is a member of the translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) family that lacks the eIF4E binding site. It was previously implicated in apoptosis, based on the finding that a dominant negative fragment of the protein protected against cell death. Here we address its function and two distinct levels of regulation during apoptosis that affect the protein both at translational and posttranslational levels. DAP5 protein was found to be cleaved at a single caspase cleavage site at position 790, in response to activated Fas or p53, yielding a C-terminal truncated protein of 86 kDa that is capable of generating complexes with eIF4A and eIF3. Interestingly, while the overall translation rate in apoptotic cells was reduced by 60 to 70%, in accordance with the simultaneous degradation of the two major mediators of cap-dependent translation, eIF4GI and eIF4GII, the translation rate of DAP5 protein was selectively maintained. An internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element capable of directing the translation of a reporter gene when subcloned into a bicistronic vector was identified in the 5' untranslated region of DAP5 mRNA. While cap-dependent translation from this transfected vector was reduced during Fas-induced apoptosis, the translation via the DAP5 IRES was selectively maintained. Addition of recombinant DAP5/p97 or DAP5/p86 to cell-free systems enhanced preferentially the translation through the DAP5 IRES, whereas neutralization of the endogenous DAP5 in reticulocyte lysates by adding a dominant negative DAP5 fragment interfered with this translation. The DAP5/p86 apoptotic form was more potent than DAP5/p97 in these functional assays. Altogether, the data suggest that DAP5 is a caspase-activated translation factor which mediates cap-independent translation at least from its own IRES, thus generating a positive feedback loop responsible for the continuous translation of DAP5 during apoptosis.
For many members of the Picornaviridae family, infection of cells results in a shutoff of host protein synthesis. For rhinoviruses and enteroviruses, the shutoff has been explained in part by the cleavage of eukaryotic initiation factor 4GI (eIF4GI), a component of the cap-binding protein complex eIF4F. The cleavage of eIF4GI is mediated by the virus-specific proteinase 2Apro and results in inhibition of cap-dependent, but not cap-independent, translation. The inhibition of host protein synthesis after infection with human rhinovirus 14 (HRV-14) lags behind the cleavage of eIF4GI. Recently, we discovered a functional homolog of eIF4GI, termed eIF4GII, and showed that cleavage of eIF4GII coincides with the shutoff of host cell protein synthesis after poliovirus infection (Gradi et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95:11089-11094, 1998). We wished to determine whether eIF4GII cleavage kinetics could also explain the lack of correlation between the kinetics of eIF4GI cleavage and the shutoff of host protein synthesis after rhinovirus infection. In this study, we examined the correlation between human rhinovirus-induced shutoff of host protein synthesis and cleavage of eIF4GI and eIF4GII. In HRV-14-infected HeLa cells, almost no intact eIF4GI could be detected by 4 h postinfection, while only 4% of eIF4GII was cleaved at this time. By 6 h, however, 67% of eIF4GII was cleaved, and this cleavage coincided with a significant (60%) decline of host translation. These results suggest that cleavage of both eIF4GI and eIF4GII is required for HRV-mediated inhibition of host cell protein synthesis and that the cleavage of eIF4GII is the rate-limiting step in the shutoff of host cell protein synthesis after rhinovirus infection.
Most eukaryotic mRNAs possess a 5' cap and a 3' poly(A) tail, both of which are required for efficient translation. In yeast and plants, binding of eIF4G to poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) was implicated in poly(A)-dependent translation. In mammals, however, there has been no evidence that eIF4G binds PABP. Using 5' rapid amplification of cDNA, we have extended the known human eIF4GI open reading frame from the N-terminus by 156 amino acids. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the extended eIF4GI binds PABP, while the N-terminally truncated original eIF4GI cannot. Deletion analysis identified a 29 amino acid sequence in the new N-terminal region as the PABP-binding site. The 29 amino acid stretch is almost identical in eIF4GI and eIF4GII, and the full-length eIF4GII also binds PABP. As previously shown for yeast, human eIF4G binds to a fragment composed of RRM1 and RRM2 of PABP. In an in vitro translation system, an N-terminal fragment which includes the PABP-binding site inhibits poly(A)-dependent translation, but has no effect on translation of a deadenylated mRNA. These results indicate that, in addition to a recently identified mammalian PABP-binding protein, PAIP-1, eIF4G binds PABP and probably functions in poly(A)-dependent translation in mammalian cells.
Sequence elements that can function as internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) have been identified in 5' noncoding regions of certain uncapped viral and capped cellular mRNA molecules. However, it has remained largely unknown whether IRES elements are functional when located in their natural capped mRNAs. Therefore, the polysomal association and translation of several IRES-containing cellular mRNAs was tested under conditions that severely inhibited cap-dependent translation, that is, after infection with poliovirus. It was found that several known IRES-containing mRNAs, such as BiP and c-myc, were both associated with the translation apparatus and translated in infected cells when cap-dependent translation of most host-cell mRNAs was blocked, indicating that the IRES elements were functional in their natural mRNAs. Curiously, the mRNAs that encode eukaryotic initiation factor 4GI (eIF4GI) and 4GII (eIF4GII), two proteins with high identity and similar functions in the initiation of cap-dependent translation, were both associated with polysomes in infected cells. The 5'-end sequences of eIF4GI mRNA were isolated from a cDNA expression library and shown to function as an internal ribosome entry site when placed into a dicistronic mRNA. These findings suggest that eIF4G proteins can be synthesized at times when 5' cap-dependent mRNA translation is blocked, supporting the notion that eIF4G proteins are needed in both 5' cap-independent and 5' cap-dependent translational initiation mechanisms.
Eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4GI is a component of the cap-binding protein complex eIF4F, which is required for cap-dependent translation. Infection of cells by poliovirus results in a precipitous decline of host cell protein synthesis, which is preceded by the cleavage of eIF4GI. Cleavage of eIF4GI results in the inhibition of cap-dependent translation. Poliovirus translation is not affected by eIF4GI cleavage, however, because poliovirus mRNA is translated by a cap-independent mechanism. Cleavage of eIF4GI alone cannot explain the shutoff of host protein synthesis, because after infection in the presence of inhibitors of virus replication, eIF4GI is cleaved, yet host protein synthesis is only partially inhibited. Here we show that eIF4GII, a recently discovered functional homolog of eIF4GI, is more resistant to poliovirus-mediated cleavage than eIF4GI, and that its proteolysis is concomitant with the shutoff of host cell protein synthesis. Moreover, infection with poliovirus in the presence of inhibitors of virus replication resulted in efficient cleavage of eIF4GI, but only partial proteolysis of eIF4GII. Thus, cleavage of both eIF4GI and eIF4GII appears to be required for the shutoff of host protein synthesis after poliovirus infection. These results explain several earlier reports documenting the lack of correlation between eIF4GI cleavage and inhibition of cellular mRNA translation after poliovirus infection.
Mammalian eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) is a cap-binding protein complex consisting of three subunits: eIF4E, eIF4A, and eIF4G. In yeast and plants, two related eIF4G species are encoded by two different genes. To date, however, only one functional eIF4G polypeptide, referred to here as eIF4GI, has been identified in mammals. Here we describe the discovery and functional characterization of a closely related homolog, referred to as eIF4GII. eIF4GI and eIF4GII share 46% identity at the amino acid level and possess an overall similarity of 56%. The homology is particularly high in certain regions of the central and carboxy portions, while the amino-terminal regions are more divergent. Far-Western analysis and coimmunoprecipitation experiments were used to demonstrate that eIF4GII directly interacts with eIF4E, eIF4A, and eIF3. eIF4GII, like eIF4GI, is also cleaved upon picornavirus infection. eIF4GII restores cap-dependent translation in a reticulocyte lysate which had been pretreated with rhinovirus 2A to cleave endogenous eIF4G. Finally, eIF4GII exists as a complex with eIF4E in HeLa cells, because eIF4GII and eIF4E can be purified together by cap affinity chromatography. Taken together, our findings indicate that eIF4GII is a functional homolog of eIF4GI. These results may have important implications for the understanding of the mechanism of shutoff of host protein synthesis following picornavirus infection.
Poliovirus (PV) causes a rapid and drastic inhibition of host cell cap-dependent protein synthesis during infection while preferentially allowing cap-independent translation of its own genomic RNA via an internal ribosome entry site element. Inhibition of cap-dependent translation is partly mediated by cleavage of an essential translation initiation factor, eIF4GI, during PV infection. In addition to cleavage of eIF4GI, cleavage of eIF4GII and poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) has been recently proposed to contribute to complete host translation shutoff; however, the relative importance of eIF4GII and PABP cleavage has not been determined. At times when cap-dependent translation is first blocked during infection, only 25 to 35% of the total cellular PABP is cleaved; therefore, we hypothesized that the pool of PABP associated with polysomes may be preferentially targeted by viral proteases. We have investigated what cleavage products of PABP are produced in vivo and the substrate determinants for cleavage of PABP by 2A protease (2A(pro)) or 3C protease (3C(pro)). Our results show that PABP in ribosome-enriched fractions is preferentially cleaved in vitro and in vivo compared to PABP in other fractions. Furthermore, we have identified four N-terminal PABP cleavage products produced during PV infection and have shown that viral 3C protease generates three of the four cleavage products. Also, 3C(pro) is more efficient in cleaving PABP in ribosome-enriched fractions than 2A(pro) in vitro. In addition, binding of PABP to poly(A) RNA stimulates 3C(pro)-mediated cleavage and inhibits 2A(pro)-mediated cleavage. These results suggest that 3C(pro) plays a major role in processing PABP during virus infection and that the interaction of PABP with translation initiation factors, ribosomes, or poly(A) RNA may promote its cleavage by viral 2A and 3C proteases.
Translation initiation promoted by picornavirus internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements is dependent on the association of specific IRES sequences to the initiation factor eIF4G. However the RNA determinants interacting with other components of the translational machinery are still unknown. In this study, we have identified novel RNA-protein interactions between the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) IRES and three translation initiation factors. A doublet of 116/110 kDa that crosslinked to the FMDV IRES is a component of eIF3. We show here that domain 5 holds the preferential binding site for eIF3, although this complex initiation factor can establish multiple contacts with the IRES structure. We have also identified the phylogenetically conserved hairpin of domain 5 as the RNA motif responsible for eIF4B interaction. Mutation of this stem-loop structure abrogated eIF4B, but not eIF3, binding to the IRES. Remarkably, IRES mutants severely affected in their interaction with eIF4B showed a mild reduction in IRES activity when tested in the context of a bicistronic expression vector in transfected cells. Finally, we provide evidence of the interaction of eIF4GII with FMDV IRES, the RNA determinants for this interaction being shared with its functional homolog eIF4GI. The FMDV Lb protease generated a C-terminal fragment of eIF4GII that binds to the IRES as efficiently as the intact protein. Competition experiments showed that titration of eIF4B or p110/116 interaction with the FMDV IRES required a large excess of competitor relative to eIF4G, strongly suggesting that eIF4G-IRES interaction is a limiting factor to titrate the IRES. Comparative analysis of the activity of IRES mutants affected in domains 4 and 5 regarding their pattern of RNA-protein complex formation demonstrates that while binding of eIF4B with the FMDV IRES is dispensable, interaction of eIF4G is a central feature of the activity of this element.
Previously, we have shown that translation eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4GI is cleaved during anti-Fas-mediated apoptosis. Here, we have investigated the effects of the proteasome inhibitors, MG132 and lactacystin, and the immunosuppressants, 2-amino-2[2-(4-octylphenyl)ethyl]-1,3,propane diol (FTY720) and cyclosporin A, on the integrity of eIF4GI and eIF4GII in T cells. Using wild-type Jurkat T cells, we show that the proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin promote the cleavage of eIF4G, activate caspase-8 and caspase-3-like activities and decrease cell viability. Furthermore, MG132 also promotes the cleavage of eIF4G and the activation of caspase-3-like activity in a caspase-8-deficient Jurkat cell line which is resistant to anti-Fas-mediated apoptosis. Using specific anti-peptide antisera, we show that both eIF4GI and eIF4GII are cleaved in either cell line in response to MG132 and lactacystin. In response to such treatments, we demonstrate that the fragments of eIF4GI generated include those previously observed with anti-Fas antiserum together with a novel product which lacks the ability to interact with eIF4E. In contrast, cells treated with the immunosuppressants FTY720 and cyclosporin A appear to contain only the novel cleavage fragment of eIF4GI and to lack those characteristic of cells treated with anti-Fas antiserum. These data suggest that caspase-8 activation is not required for apoptosis and eIF4G cleavage mediated by proteasome inhibitors and immunosuppressants in human T cells.
Cap-dependent translation is mediated by eIF4F, a protein complex composed of three subunits as follows: eIF4E, which recognizes the mRNA 5' cap structure; eIF4A, an RNA-helicase; and eIF4G, a scaffolding protein that binds eIF4E, eIF4A, and the eIF4E-kinase Mnk1 simultaneously. eIF4E is hypophosphorylated and cap-dependent translation is reduced at mitosis. Here, we show that 4E-BP1, a suppressor of eIF4E function, is also hypophosphorylated in mitosis, resulting in disruption of the eIF4F complex. Consequently, eIF4E is sequestered from the eIF4G/Mnk1 complex. These results explain the specific inhibition of cap-dependent translation in mitosis and also explain how eIF4E is rendered hypophosphorylated during mitosis. Furthermore, eIF4E interaction with eIF4GII is strongly decreased coincident with hyperphosphorylation of eIF4GII. Thus, inhibition of cap-dependent translation in mitosis results from a combination of phosphorylation modifications leading to eIF4F complex disruption.
Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G), which has two homologs known as eIF4GI and eIF4GII, functions in a complex (eIF4F) which binds to the 5' cap structure of cellular mRNAs and facilitates binding of capped mRNA to 40S ribosomal subunits. Disruption of this complex in enterovirus-infected cells through eIF4G cleavage is known to block this step of translation initiation, thus leading to a drastic inhibition of cap-dependent translation. Here, we show that like eIF4GI, the newly identified homolog eIF4GII is cleaved during apoptosis in HeLa cells and can serve as a substrate for caspase 3. Proteolysis of both eIF4GI and eIF4GII occurs with similar kinetics and coincides with the profound translation inhibition observed in cisplatin-treated HeLa cells. Both eIF4GI and eIF4GII can be cleaved by caspase 3 with similar efficiency in vitro, however, eIF4GII is processed into additional fragments which destroy its core central domain and likely contributes to the shutoff of translation observed in apoptosis. Cell Death and Differentiation (2000) 7, 1234 - 1243.
Induction of apoptosis results in inhibition of the rate of overall protein synthesis in a variety of cell types. We have shown previously that polypeptide chain initiation factor eIF4GI is rapidly cleaved by caspase-3, whereas other components of the eIF4F complex are much more stable during apoptosis in BJAB and Jurkat cells. We have now extended our analysis to other factors involved in the initiation of protein synthesis and we report here that eIF4B, the p35 subunit of eIF3, and minor proportions of the alpha subunit of eIF2 and the eIF4E-binding protein 4E-BP1 are also cleaved to give rise to discrete fragments. These cleavages occur with delayed kinetics relative to that seen for eIF4GI, and eIF2beta and eIF2gamma levels also decrease at a relatively late stage of apoptosis. In contrast, the second form of eIF4G described recently, eIF4GII, is cleaved as rapidly as eIF4GI under the same conditions. Purified recombinant caspase-3 is able to degrade eIF4B and eIF3(p35) in vitro, producing fragments of the same sizes as those seen in intact cells. Induction of apoptosis also results in a biphasic change in the association of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E. Thus the progress of apoptosis is characterized by a complex programme of changes in several initiation factors, including the specific fragmentation or complete degradation of some and alterations in the association status of others. These events are likely to contribute to the inhibition of protein synthesis seen under these conditions.
Cytolytic viruses abrogate host protein synthesis to maximize the translation of their own mRNAs. In this study, we analyzed the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4G requirement for translation of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and vaccinia virus (VV) mRNAs in HeLa cells using two different strategies: eIF4G depletion by small interfering RNAs or cleavage of eIF4G by expression of poliovirus 2A protease. Depletion of eIF4GI or eIF4GII moderately inhibits cellular protein synthesis, whereas silencing of both factors has only a slightly higher effect. Under these conditions, the extent of VSV protein synthesis is similar to that of nondepleted control cells, whereas VV expression is substantially reduced. Similar results were obtained when eIF4E was depleted. On the other hand, eIF4G cleavage by poliovirus 2A protease strongly inhibits translation of VV protein expression, whereas translation directed by VSV mRNAs is not abrogated, even though VSV mRNAs are capped. Therefore, the requirement for eIF4F activity is different for VV and VSV, suggesting that the molecular mechanism by which their mRNAs initiate their translation is also different. Consistent with these findings, eIF4GI does not colocalize with ribosomes in VSV-infected cells, while eIF2alpha locates at perinuclear sites coincident with ribosomes.
Enterovirus (EV) infection has been shown to cause a marked shutoff of host protein synthesis, an event mainly achieved through the cleavages of eukaryotic translation initiation factors eIF4GI and eIF4GII that are mediated by viral 2A protease (2A(pro)). Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), we developed genetically encoded and FRET-based biosensors to visualize and quantify the specific proteolytic process in intact cells. This was accomplished by stable expression of a fusion substrate construct composed of the green fluorescent protein 2 (GFP(2)) and red fluorescent protein 2 (DsRed2), with a cleavage motif on eIF4GI or eIF4GII connected in between. The FRET biosensor showed a real-time and quantifiable impairment of FRET upon EV infection. Levels of the reduced FRET closely correlated with the cleavage kinetics of the endogenous eIF4Gs isoforms. The FRET impairments were solely attributed to 2A(pro) catalytic activity, irrespective of other viral-encoded protease, the activated caspases or general inhibition of protein synthesis in the EV-infected cells. The FRET biosensors appeared to be a universal platform for several related EVs. The spatiotemporal and quantitative imaging enabled by FRET can shed light on the protease-substrate behaviors in their normal milieu, permitting investigation into the molecular mechanism underlying virus-induced host translation inhibition.
During mammalian programmed cell death, cleavage of the translation initiation factor 4G proteins (eIF4GI and eIF4GII) by caspase-3 induces the cap-independent synthesis of pro-apoptotic proteins. Apoptosis occurs naturally in the gonad to remove germ cells that are not selected to grow as oocytes and mature into eggs. Here, we describe two major isoforms of Caenorhabditis elegans eIF4G that are derived from a single gene (ifg-1) and their separate roles in germline homeostasis. Full length IFG-1 protein (170 kDa isoform) differs from the shorter isoform (130 kDa) by the inclusion of the N-terminal domain containing the putative eIF4E-binding site required for mRNA cap recognition. Depletion of the cap-associated p170 isoform induced CED-4 expression in oocytes and markedly increased germline apoptotic events, but did not prevent early mitotic germ cell proliferation. Loss of both p170 and p130 suppressed germ cell proliferation and arrested larval development. Evidence suggests that eIF4G isoforms are differentially utilized during oogenesis to regulate germ cell apoptosis. We propose that an alternative mechanism to eIF4G cleavage may be employed in germ cells by changing the availability of the p170 isoform.
Poliovirus (PV) 2A protease (2A(Pro)) cleaves eukaryotic initiation factors 4GI and 4GII (eIF4GI and eIF4GII) within virus-infected cells, effectively halting cap-dependent mRNA translation. PV mRNA, which does not possess a 5' cap, is translated via cap-independent mechanisms within viral protease-modified messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes. In this study, we determined that 2A(Pro) activity was required for viral polysome formation and stability. 2A(Pro) cleaved eIF4GI and eIF4GII as PV polysomes assembled. A 2A(Cys109Ser) (2A(Pro) with a Cys109Ser mutation) protease active site mutation that prevented cleavage of eIF4G coordinately inhibited the de novo formation of viral polysomes, the stability of viral polysomes, and the stability of PV mRNA within polysomes. 2A(Cys109Ser)-associated defects in PV mRNA and polysome stability correlated with defects in PV mRNA translation. 3C(Pro) activity was not required for viral polysome formation or stability. 2A(Pro)-mediated cleavage of eIF4G along with poly(rC) binding protein binding to the 5' terminus of uncapped PV mRNA appear to be concerted mechanisms that allow PV mRNA to form mRNP complexes that evade cellular mRNA degradation machinery.
The foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) leader proteinase (L(pro)) self-processes inefficiently at the L(pro)/VP4 cleavage site LysLeuLys*GlyAlaGly (* indicates cleaved peptide bond) when the leucine at position P2 is replaced by phenylalanine. Molecular modeling and energy minimization identified the L(pro) residue L143 as being responsible for this discrimination. The variant L(pro) L143A self-processed efficiently at the L(pro)/VP4 cleavage site containing P2 phenylalanine, whereas the L143M variant did not. L(pro) L143A self-processing at the eIF4GII sequence AspPheGly*ArgGlnThr was improved but showed more-extensive aberrant processing. Residue 143 in L(pro) is occupied only by leucine and methionine in all sequenced FMDV serotypes, implying that these bulky side chains are one determinant of the restricted specificity of L(pro).
The eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4GI gene locus (eIF4GI) contains three identified promoters, generating alternately spliced mRNAs, yielding a total of five eIF4GI protein isoforms. Although eIF4GI plays a critical role in mRNA recruitment to the ribosomes, little is known about the functions of the different isoforms, their partner binding capacities, or the role of the homolog, eIF4GII, in translation initiation. To directly address this, we have used short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) expressed from DNA vectors to silence the expression of eIF4GI in HeLa cells. Here we show that reduced levels of specific mRNA and eIF4GI isoforms in HeLa cells promoted aberrant morphology and a partial inhibition of translation. The latter reflected dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and decreased eIF4F complex levels, with no change in eIF2alpha phosphorylation. Expression of siRNA-resistant Myc-tagged eIF4GI isoforms has allowed us to show that the different isoforms exhibit significant differences in their ability to restore translation rates. Here we quantify the efficiency of eIF4GI promoter usage in mammalian cells and demonstrate that even though the longest isoform of eIF4GI (eIF4GIf) was relatively poorly expressed when reintroduced, it was more efficient at promoting the translation of cellular mRNAs than the more highly expressed shorter isoforms used in previous functional studies.
Two isoforms of the translation initiation factor eIF4G, eIF4GI and eIF4GII, have been described in eukaryotic cells. The exact function of each isoform during the initiation of protein synthesis is still under investigation. We have developed an efficient and reliable method of expressing poliovirus 2Apro, which differentially proteolyzes eIF4GI and eIF4GII in a time- and dose-dependent manner. This system is based on the electroporation of an in vitro transcribed mRNA that contains the encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosome entry site followed by the sequence of poliovirus 2Apro. In contrast to HeLa cells, expression of this protease in BHK-21 cells induces delayed hydrolysis kinetics of eIF4GI with respect to eIF4GII. Moreover, under these conditions the polyadenylate binding protein is not cleaved. Interestingly, translation of de novo synthesized luciferase mRNA is highly dependent on eIF4GI integrity, whereas ongoing translation is inhibited at the same time as eIF4GII cleavage. Moreover, reinitiation of a preexisting mRNA translation after polysome run-off is dependent on the integrity of eIF4GII. Notably, de novo translation of heat shock protein 70 mRNA depends little on eIF4GI integrity but is more susceptible to eIF4GII hydrolysis. Finally, translation of an mRNA containing encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosome entry site when the two isoforms of eIF4G are differentially hydrolyzed has been examined.
The leader proteinase (L(pro)) of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) initially cleaves itself from the polyprotein. Subsequently, L(pro) cleaves the host proteins eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4GI and 4GII. This prevents protein synthesis from capped cellular mRNAs; the viral RNA is still translated, initiating from an internal ribosome entry site. L(pro) cleaves eIF4GI between residues G674 and R675. We showed previously, however, that L(pro) binds to residues 640-669 of eIF4GI. Binding was substantially improved when the eIF4GI fragment contained the eIF4E binding site and eIF4E was present in the binding assay. L(pro) interacts with eIF4GI via residue C133 and residues 183-195 of the C-terminal extension. This binding domain lies about 25 A from the active site. Here, we examined the binding of L(pro) to eIF4GI fragments generated by in vitro translation to narrow the binding site down to residues 645-657 of human eIF4GI. Comparison of these amino acids with those in human eIF4GII as well as with sequences of eIF4GI from other organisms allowed us to identify two conserved basic residues (K646 and R650). Mutation of these residues was severely detrimental to L(pro) binding. Similarly, comparison of the sequence between residues 183 and 195 of L(pro) with those of other FMDV serotypes and equine rhinitis A virus showed that acidic residues D184 and E186 were highly conserved. Substitution of these residues in L(pro) significantly reduced eIF4GI binding and cleavage without affecting self-processing. Thus, FMDV L(pro) has evolved a domain that specifically recognizes a host cell protein.
The foot-and-mouth disease virus Leader proteinase (L(pro)) frees itself from the growing viral polyprotein by self-processing between its own C-terminus and the N-terminus of the subsequent protein VP4. The ArgLysLeuLys*GlyAlaGlyGln sequence is recognized. The proteinase subsequently cleaves the two isoforms of host cell protein eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4G at the AlaAsnLeuGly*ArgThrThrLeu (eIF4GI) and LeuAsnValGly*SerArgArgSer (eIF4GII) sequences. The enzyme does not, however, recognize the sequence on eIF4GII (AlaAspPheGly*ArgGlnThrPro) which is analogous to that recognized on eIF4GI. To investigate the basis for this specificity, we used site-directed mutagenesis to show that the presence of Phe at the P2 position or Asp at the P3 position severely compromises self-processing. Furthermore, these substitutions also give rise to the production of aberrant cleavage products. As Leu is the preferred amino acid at P2, the specificity of L(pro) is reminiscent of that of cathepsin K. This cellular proteinase can also process collagen through its ability to accept proline at the P2 position. Investigation of the L(pro) substrate specificity showed, however, that in contrast to cathepsin K, L(pro) cannot accept Pro at P2 and does not cleave collagen. Subtle variations in the arrangement of the S2 binding pockets on the enzymes are responsible for these differences in specificity.
mRNA translation is mainly regulated at the level of initiation, a process that involves the synergistic action of the 5' cap structure and the 3' poly(A) tail at the ends of eukaryotic mRNA. The eukaryote initiation factor 4G(eIF4G) is a pivotal scaffold protein that forms a critical link between mRNA cap structure, poly(A) tail, and the small ribosomal subunit. There are two functional homologs of eIF4G in mammals, the original eIF4G, renamed eIF4GI, and eIF4GII that functionally complements eIF4GI. To date, biochemical and functional analysis have not identified differential activities for eIF4GI and eIF4GII. In this report, we demonstrate that eIF4GII, but not eIF4GI, is selectively recruited to capped mRNA at the onset of cell differentiation. This recruitment is coincident with a strong and long-lasting phosphorylation of eIF4E and the release of 4E-BP1, a suppressor of eIF4E function, from the cap structure, without a concomitant change in 4E-BP1's phosphorylation. Our data further indicate that cytokines such as thrombopoietin can differentially regulate eIF4GI/II activities. These results provide the first evidence that eIF4GI/II does fulfill selective roles in mammalian cells.
Caliciviruses are small, non-enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses that are pathogenic for both animals and man. Although their capsid structure and genomic organization are distinct from picornaviruses, they have similarities to these viruses in their non-structural proteins. Picornaviruses induce a rapid inhibition of host-cell cap-dependent protein synthesis and this is mainly achieved through cleavage of eIF4G and/or dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1. In this study, the effect of calicivirus infection was examined on host-cell protein synthesis in order to determine whether they also induce host shut-off. We report that infection of cells with feline calicivirus (FCV) leads to the inhibition of cellular protein synthesis. This is accompanied by the cleavage of the eukaryotic translation initiation factors eIF4GI and eIF4GII in a manner reminiscent of that induced by picornaviruses. However, the cleavages occur at different sites. The potential mechanisms of these cleavage events and the implications for the translation of calicivirus mRNA are discussed.
Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) induces a very rapid inhibition of host cell protein synthesis within infected cells. This is accompanied by the cleavage of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4GI (eIF4GI). The cleavage of the related protein eIF4GII has now been analyzed. Within FMDV-infected cells, cleavage of eIF4GI and eIF4GII occurs with similar kinetics. Cleavage of eIF4GII is induced in cells and in cell extracts by the FMDV leader protease (L(pro)) alone, generating cleavage products similar to those induced by enterovirus and rhinovirus 2A protease (2A(pro)). By the use of a fusion protein containing residues 445 to 744 of human eIF4GII, it was demonstrated that the FMDV L(pro) specifically cleaves this protein between residues G700 and S701, immediately adjacent to the site (V699/G700) cleaved by rhinovirus 2A(pro) in vitro. The G700/S701 cleavage site does not correspond, by amino acid sequence alignment, to that cleaved in eIF4GI by the FMDV L(pro) in vitro. Knowledge of the cleavage sites and the three-dimensional structures of the FMDV L(pro) and rhinovirus 2A(pro) enabled mutant forms of the eIF4GII sequence to be generated that are differentially resistant to either one of these proteases. These results confirmed the specificity of each protease and showed that the mutant forms of the fusion protein substrate retained their correct sensitivity to other proteases.
The 4G family of eukaryotic mRNA translation initiation factors is composed of three members (eIF4GI, eIF4GII, and DAP5). Their specific roles in translation initiation are under intense investigations, but how their respective intracellular amounts are controlled remains poorly understood. Here we show that eIF4GI and eIF4GII exhibit much shorter half-lives than that of DAP5. Both eIF4GI and eIF4GII proteins, but not DAP5, contain computer-predicted PEST motifs in their N-termini conserved across the animal kingdom. They are both sensitive to degradation by the proteasome. Under normal conditions, eIF4GI and eIF4GII are protected from proteasomal destruction through binding to the detoxifying enzyme NQO1 [NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase]. However, when cells are exposed to oxidative stress both eIF4GI and eIF4GII, but not DAP5, are degraded by the proteasome in an N-terminal-dependent manner, and cell viability is more compromised upon silencing of DAP5. These findings indicate that the three eIF4G proteins are differentially regulated by the proteasome and that persistent DAP5 plays a role in cell survival upon oxidative stress.
Death-associated protein 5 (DAP5) is an atypical isoform of the translation initiation scaffolds eukaryotic initiation factor 4GI (eIF4GI) and eIF4GII (eIF4GI/II), which recruit mRNAs to ribosomes in mammals. Unlike eIF4GI/II, DAP5 binds eIF2Œ≤, a subunit of the eIF2 complex that delivers methionyl-tRNA to ribosomes. We discovered that DAP5:eIF2Œ≤ binding depends on specific stimuli, e.g., protein kinase C (PKC)-Raf-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signals, and determines DAP5's influence on global and template-specific translation. DAP5 depletion caused an unanticipated surge of hypoxia-inducible factor 1Œ± (HIF-1Œ±), the transcription factor and master switch of the hypoxia response. Physiologically, the hypoxia response is tempered through HIF-1Œ± hydroxylation by the oxygen-sensing prolyl hydroxylase-domain protein 2 (PHD2) and subsequent ubiquitination and degradation. We found that DAP5 regulates HIF-1Œ± abundance through DAP5:eIF2Œ≤-dependent translation of PHD2. DAP5:eIF2-induced PHD2 translation occurred during hypoxia-associated protein synthesis repression, indicating a role as a safeguard to reverse HIF-1Œ± accumulation and curb the hypoxic response.
Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disease characterized by slowly progressive ataxia and Purkinje cell degeneration. SCA6 is caused by a polyglutamine repeat expansion within a second CACNA1A gene product, Œ±1ACT. Œ±1ACT expression is under the control of an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) present within the CACNA1A coding region. Whereas SCA6 allele knock-in mice show indistinguishable phenotypes from wild-type littermates, expression of SCA6-associated Œ±1ACT (Œ±1ACTSCA6) driven by a Purkinje cell-specific promoter in mice produces slowly progressive ataxia and cerebellar atrophy. We developed an early-onset SCA6 mouse model using an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene delivery system to ectopically express CACNA1A IRES-driven Œ±1ACTSCA6 to test the potential of CACNA1A IRES-targeting therapies. Mice expressing AAV9-mediated CACNA1A IRES-driven Œ±1ACTSCA6 exhibited early-onset ataxia, motor deficits, and Purkinje cell degeneration. We identified miR-3191-5p as a microRNA (miRNA) that targeted CACNA1A IRES and preferentially inhibited the CACNA1A IRES-driven translation of Œ±1ACT in an Argonaute 4 (Ago4)-dependent manner. We found that eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), eIF4AII and eIF4GII, interacted with the CACNA1A IRES to enhance Œ±1ACT translation. Ago4-bound miR-3191-5p blocked the interaction of eIF4AII and eIF4GII with the CACNA1A IRES, attenuating IRES-driven Œ±1ACT translation. Furthermore, AAV9-mediated delivery of miR-3191-5p protected mice from the ataxia, motor deficits, and Purkinje cell degeneration caused by CACNA1A IRES-driven Œ±1ACTSCA6 We have established proof of principle that viral delivery of an miRNA can rescue a disease phenotype through modulation of cellular IRES activity in a mouse model.
Messenger RNA is recruited to the eukaryotic ribosome by a complex including the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E (the cap-binding protein), the scaffold protein eIF4G and the RNA helicase eIF4A. To shut-off host-cell protein synthesis, eIF4G is cleaved during picornaviral infection by a virally encoded proteinase; the structural basis of this reaction and its stimulation by eIF4E is unclear. We have structurally and biochemically investigated the interaction of purified foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) leader proteinase (Lb(pro)), human rhinovirus 2 (HRV2) 2A proteinase (2A(pro)) and coxsackievirus B4 (CVB4) 2A(pro) with purified eIF4GII, eIF4E and the eIF4GII/eIF4E complex. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), we completed (13)C/(15) N sequential backbone assignment of human eIF4GII residues 551-745 and examined their binding to murine eIF4E. eIF4GII551-745 is intrinsically unstructured and remains so when bound to eIF4E. NMR and biophysical techniques for determining stoichiometry and binding constants revealed that the papain-like Lb(pro) only forms a stable complex with eIF4GII(551-745) in the presence of eIF4E, with KD values in the low nanomolar range; Lb(pro) contacts both eIF4GII and eIF4E. Furthermore, the unrelated chymotrypsin-like 2A(pro) from HRV2 and CVB4 also build a stable complex with eIF4GII/eIF4E, but with K(D) values in the low micromolar range. The HRV2 enzyme also forms a stable complex with eIF4E; however, none of the proteinases tested complex stably with eIF4GII alone. Thus, these three picornaviral proteinases have independently evolved to establish distinct triangular heterotrimeric protein complexes that may actively target ribosomes involved in mRNA recruitment to ensure efficient host cell shut-off.
Deregulation of the translational machinery is emerging as a critical contributor to cancer development. The contribution of microRNAs in translational gene control has been established however; the role of microRNAs in disrupting the cap-dependent translation regulation complex has not been previously described. Here, we established that elevated miR-520c-3p represses global translation, cell proliferation and initiates premature senescence in HeLa and DLBCL cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that miR-520c-3p directly targets translation initiation factor, eIF4GII mRNA and negatively regulates eIF4GII protein synthesis. miR-520c-3p overexpression diminishes cells colony formation and reduces tumor growth in a human xenograft mouse model. Consequently, downregulation of eIF4GII by siRNA decreases translation, cell proliferation and ability to form colonies, as well as induces cellular senescence. In vitro and in vivo findings were further validated in patient samples; DLBCL primary cells demonstrated low miR-520c-3p levels with reciprocally up-regulated eIF4GII protein expression. Our results provide evidence that the tumor suppressor effect of miR-520c-3p is mediated through repression of translation while inducing senescence and that eIF4GII is a key effector of this anti-tumor activity. 
Translation mechanisms at different stages of the cell cycle have been studied for many years, resulting in the dogma that translation rates are slowed during mitosis, with cap-independent translation mechanisms favored to give expression of key regulatory proteins. However, such cell culture studies involve synchronization using harsh methods, which may in themselves stress cells and affect protein synthesis rates. One such commonly used chemical is the microtubule de-polymerization agent, nocodazole, which arrests cells in mitosis and has been used to demonstrate that translation rates are strongly reduced (down to 30% of that of asynchronous cells). Using synchronized HeLa cells released from a double thymidine block (G 1/S boundary) or the Cdk1 inhibitor, RO3306 (G 2/M boundary), we have systematically re-addressed this dogma. Using FACS analysis and pulse labeling of proteins with labeled methionine, we now show that translation rates do not slow as cells enter mitosis. This study is complemented by studies employing confocal microscopy, which show enrichment of translation initiation factors at the microtubule organizing centers, mitotic spindle, and midbody structure during the final steps of cytokinesis, suggesting that translation is maintained during mitosis. Furthermore, we show that inhibition of translation in response to extended times of exposure to nocodazole reflects increased eIF2Œ± phosphorylation, disaggregation of polysomes, and hyperphosphorylation of selected initiation factors, including novel Cdk1-dependent N-terminal phosphorylation of eIF4GII. Our work suggests that effects on translation in nocodazole-arrested cells might be related to those of the treatment used to synchronize cells rather than cell cycle status. 
The transcriptional regulator deformed epidermal autoregulatory factor 1 (DEAF1) has been suggested to play a role in maintaining peripheral tolerance by controlling the transcription of peripheral tissue antigen genes in lymph node stromal cells (LNSCs). Here, we demonstrate that DEAF1 also regulates the translation of genes in LNSCs by controlling the transcription of the poorly characterized eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma 3 (Eif4g3) that encodes eIF4GII. Eif4g3 gene expression was reduced in the pancreatic lymph nodes of Deaf1-KO mice, non-obese diabetic mice, and type 1 diabetes patients, where functional Deaf1 is absent or diminished. Silencing of Deaf1 reduced Eif4g3 expression, but increased the expression of Caspase 3, a serine protease that degrades eIF4GII. Polysome profiling showed that reduced Eif4g3 expression in LNSCs resulted in the diminished translation of various genes, including Anpep, the gene for aminopeptidase N, an enzyme involved in fine-tuning antigen presentation on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II. Together these findings suggest that reduced DEAF1 function, and subsequent loss of Eif4g3 transcription may affect peripheral tissue antigen (PTA) expression in LNSCs and contribute to the pathology of T1D.
During the initiation stage of eukaryotic mRNA translation, the eIF4G (eukaryotic initiation factor 4G) proteins act as an aggregation point for recruiting the small ribosomal subunit to an mRNA. We previously used RNAi (RNA interference) to reduce expression of endogenous eIF4GI proteins, resulting in reduced protein synthesis rates and alterations in the morphology of cells. Expression of EIF4G1 cDNAs, encoding different isoforms (f-a) which arise through selection of alternative initiation codons, rescued translation to different extents. Furthermore, overexpression of the eIF4GII paralogue in the eIF4GI-knockdown background was unable to restore translation to the same extent as eIF4GIf/e isoforms, suggesting that translation events governed by this protein are different. In the present study we show that multiple isoforms of eIF4GII exist in mammalian cells, arising from multiple promoters and alternative splicing events, and have identified a non-canonical CUG initiation codon which extends the eIF4GII N-terminus. We further show that the rescue of translation in eIF4GI/eIF4GII double-knockdown cells by our novel isoforms of eIF4GII is as robust as that observed with either eIF4GIf or eIF4GIe, and more than that observed with the original eIF4GII. As the novel eIF4GII sequence diverges from eIF4GI, these data suggest that the eIF4GII N-terminus plays an alternative role in initiation factor assembly.
Ca¬≤‚Å∫/calmodulin-dependent kinases (CaMKs) are essential for neuronal development and plasticity, processes requiring de novo protein synthesis. Roles for CaMKs in modulating gene transcription are well established, but their involvement in mRNA translation is evolving. Here we report that activity-dependent translational initiation in cultured rat hippocampal neurons is enhanced by CaMKI-mediated phosphorylation of Ser1156 in eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4GII (4GII). Treatment with bicuculline or gabazine to enhance neuronal activity promotes recruitment of wild-type 4GII, but not the 4GII S1156A mutant or 4GI, to the heterotrimeric eIF4F (4F) complex that assembles at the 5' cap structure (m‚Å∑GTP) of mRNA to initiate ribosomal scanning. Recruitment of 4GII to 4F is suppressed by pharmacological inhibition (STO-609) of CaM kinase kinase, the upstream activator of CaMKI. Post hoc in vitro CaMKI phosphorylation assays confirm that activity promotes phosphorylation of S1156 in transfected 4GII in neurons. Changes in cap-dependent and cap-independent translation were assessed using a bicistronic luciferase reporter transfected into neurons. Activity upregulates cap-dependent translation, and RNAi knockdown of CaMKIŒ≤ and Œ≥ isoforms, but not Œ± or Œ¥, led to its attenuation as did blockade of NMDA receptors. Furthermore, RNAi knockdown of 4GII attenuates cap-dependent translation and reduces density of dendritic filopodia and spine formation without effect on dendritic arborization. Together, our results provide a mechanistic link between Ca¬≤‚Å∫ influx due to neuronal activity and regulation of cap-dependent RNA translation via CaMKI activation and selective recruitment of phosphorylated 4GII to the 4F complex, which may function to regulate activity-dependent changes in spine density.
After entry into animal cells, most viruses hijack essential components involved in gene expression. This is the case of poliovirus, which abrogates cellular translation soon after virus internalization. Abrogation is achieved by cleavage of both eIF4GI and eIF4GII by the viral protease 2A. Apart from the interference of poliovirus with cellular protein synthesis, other gene expression steps such as RNA and protein trafficking between nucleus and cytoplasm are also altered. Poliovirus 2A(pro) is capable of hydrolyzing components of the nuclear pore, thus preventing an efficient antiviral response by the host cell. Here, we compare in detail poliovirus 2A(pro) with other viral proteins (from picornaviruses and unrelated families) as regard to their activity on key host factors that control gene expression. It is possible that future analyses to determine the cellular proteins targeted by 2A(pro) will uncover other cellular functions ablated by poliovirus infection. Further understanding of the cellular proteins hydrolyzed by 2A(pro) will add further insight into the molecular mechanism by which poliovirus and other viruses interact with the host cell.
In eukaryotes, the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) is one of the important factors for initiation of messenger RNA translation. PABP activity is regulated by the PABP-interacting proteins (Paips), which include Paip1, Paip2A, and Paip2B. Human Paip1 has three different isoforms. Here, we report the crystal structure of the middle domain of Paip1 isoform 2 (Paip1M) as determined by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing. The structure reveals a crescent-shaped domain consisting of 10 Œ±-helices and two antiparallel Œ≤-strands forming a Œ≤-hairpin. The 10 Œ±-helices are arranged as five HEAT repeats which form a double layer of Œ± helices with a convex and a concave surface. Despite low sequence identity, the overall fold of Paip1M is similar to the middle domain of human eIF4GII and yeast eIF4GI. Moreover, the amino-acid sequence motif and the local structure of eIF4G involved in binding of eIF4A, are conserved in Paip1. The structure reported here is the first of a member of the Paip family, thereby filling a gap in our understanding of initiation of eukaryotic mRNA translation in three dimensions.
Viruses rely on the host translation machinery to complete their life cycles. Picornaviruses use an internal ribosome entry site to initiate cap-independent protein translation and in parallel host cap-dependent translation is shut off. This process is thought to occur primarily via cleavage of host translation initiation factors eIF4GI and eIF4GII by viral proteases. Here we describe another mechanism whereby miR-141 induced upon enterovirus infection targets the cap-dependent translation initiation factor, eIF4E, for shutoff of host protein synthesis. Knockdown of miR-141 reduces viral propagation, and silencing of eIF4E can completely reverse the inhibitory effect of the miR-141 antagomiR on viral propagation. Ectopic expression of miR-141 promotes the switch from cap-dependent to cap-independent translation. Moreover, we identified a transcription factor, EGR1, which is partly responsible for miR-141 induction in response to enterovirus infection. Our results suggest that upregulation of miR-141 upon enterovirus infection can facilitate viral propagation by expediting the translational switch.
Barley yellow dwarf virus mRNA, which lacks both cap and poly(A) tail, has a translation element (3'-BTE) in its 3'-UTR essential for efficient translation initiation at the 5'-proximal AUG. This mechanism requires eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G), subunit of heterodimer eIF4F (plant eIF4F lacks eIF4A), and 3'-BTE-5'-UTR interaction. Using fluorescence anisotropy, SHAPE (selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension) analysis, and toeprinting, we found that (i) 40S subunits bind to BTE (Kd = 350 ¬± 30 nm), (ii) the helicase complex eIF4F-eIF4A-eIF4B-ATP increases 40S subunit binding (Kd = 120 ¬± 10 nm) to the conserved stem-loop I of the 3'-BTE by exposing more unpaired bases, and (iii) long distance base pairing transfers this complex to the 5'-end of the mRNA, where translation initiates. Although 3'-5' interactions have been recognized as important in mRNA translation, barley yellow dwarf virus employs a novel mechanism utilizing the 3'-UTR as the primary site of ribosome recruitment. 
Resveratrol is a phytoalexin that confers overall health benefits including positive regulation in brain function such as learning and cognition. However, whether and how resveratrol affects synaptic activity remains largely unknown. Œ±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) are glutamatergic receptors that mediate the majority of fast excitatory transmission and synaptic plasticity, and thus play a critical role in higher brain functions, including learning and memory. We find that in rat primary neurons, resveratrol can rapidly increase AMPAR protein level, AMPAR synaptic accumulation and the strength of excitatory synaptic transmission. The resveratrol effect on AMPAR protein expression is independent of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), the conventional downstream target of resveratrol, but rather is mediated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and subsequent downstream phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling. Application of the AMPK specific activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-Œ≤-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR) mimics the effects of resveratrol on both signaling and AMPAR expression. The resveratrol-induced increase in AMPAR expression results from elevated protein synthesis via regulation of the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E/4G complex. Disruption of the translation initiation complex completely blocks resveratrol-dependent AMPAR up-regulation. These findings indicate that resveratrol may regulate brain function through facilitation of AMPAR biogenesis and synaptic transmission. 
Protein synthesis is a major energy-consuming process, which is rapidly repressed upon energy stress by AMPK. How energy deficiency affects translation of mRNAs that cope with the stress response is poorly understood. We found that mitochondrial genes remain translationally active upon energy deprivation. Surprisingly, inhibition of translation is partially retained in AMPKŒ±1/AMPKŒ±2 knockout cells. Mitochondrial mRNAs are enriched with TISU, a translation initiator of short 5' UTR, which confers resistance specifically to energy stress. Purified 48S preinitiation complex is sufficient for initiation via TISU AUG, when preceded by a short 5' UTR. eIF1 stimulates TISU but inhibits non-TISU-directed initiation. Remarkably, eIF4GI shares this activity and also interacts with eIF1. Furthermore, eIF4F is released upon 48S formation on TISU. These findings describe a specialized translation tolerance mechanism enabling continuous translation of TISU genes under energy stress and reveal that a key step in start codon selection of short 5' UTR is eIF4F release.
The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4-gamma (eIF4G) is important for the initiation of protein synthesis and phosphorylation on S1108 regulates this function of eIF4G. Thus, increased phosphorylation has been reported in conditions associated with increased protein synthesis such as meal feeding and insulin/IGF-1 treatment whereas decreased phosphorylation occurs following starvation, dexamethasone treatment, in sepsis and in atrophic denervated hind-limb muscle. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that S1108 phosphorylation of eIF4G is differentially affected in denervated atrophic hind-limb muscles and denervated hypertrophic hemidiaphragm muscle. Protein expression and phosphorylation in innervated and 6-days denervated atrophic hind-limb muscles (pooled gastrocnemius and soleus) and hypertrophic hemidiaphragms were studied semi-quantitatively using Western blots. Total expression of eIF4G did not change in denervated hind-limb muscles but increased about 77% in denervated hemidiaphragm. S1108 phosphorylated eIF4G decreased about 64% in denervated hind-limb muscles but increased about 1.3-fold in denervated hemidiaphragm. The ratio of S1108 phosphorylated eIF4G to total eIF4G decreased about 60% in denervated hind-limb muscles but no statistically significant change was observed in denervated hemidiaphragm. The differential effect of denervation on eIF4G expression and S1108 phosphorylation in hemidiaphragm (hypertrophic) and hind-limb muscle (atrophic) may represent a regulatory mechanism that helps clarify the differential response of these muscles following denervation. 
The MYC transcription factor plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell cycle progression, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and cellular transformation. Due to its oncogenic activities and overexpression in a majority of human cancers, it is an interesting target for novel drug therapies. MYC binding to the E-box (5'-CACGTGT-3') sequence at gene promoters contributes to more than 4000 MYC-dependent transcripts. Owing to its importance in MYC regulation, we designed a novel sequence-specific DNA-binding pyrrole-imidazole (PI) polyamide, Myc-5, that recognizes the E-box consensus sequence. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the Myc-5 binding sequence appeared in 5'- MYC binding E-box sequences at the eIF4G1, CCND1, and CDK4 gene promoters. Furthermore, ChIP coupled with detection by quantitative PCR indicated that Myc-5 has the ability to inhibit MYC binding at the target gene promoters and thus cause downregulation at the mRNA level and protein expression of its target genes in human Burkitt's lymphoma model cell line, P493.6, carrying an inducible MYC repression system and the K562 (human chronic myelogenous leukemia) cell line. Single i.v. injection of Myc-5 at 7.5¬†mg/kg dose caused significant tumor growth inhibition in a MYC-dependent tumor xenograft model without evidence of toxicity. We report here a compelling rationale for the identification of a PI polyamide that inhibits a part of E-box-mediated MYC downstream gene expression and is a model for showing that phenotype-associated MYC downstream gene targets consequently inhibit MYC-dependent tumor growth. 
Clinical outcome of children with malignant glioma remains dismal. Here, we examined the role of over-expressed BMI1, a regulator of stem cell self-renewal, in sustaining tumor formation in pediatric glioma stem cells. Our investigation revealed BMI1 over-expression in 29 of 54 (53.7%) pediatric gliomas, 8 of 8 (100%) patient derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) mouse models, and in both CD133+ and CD133- glioma cells. We demonstrated that lentiviral-shRNA mediated silencing of suppressed cell proliferation in vitro in cells derived from 3 independent PDOX models and eliminated tumor-forming capacity of CD133+ and CD133- cells derived from 2 PDOX models in mouse brains. Gene expression profiling showed that most of the molecular targets of BMI1 ablation in CD133+ cells were different from that in CD133- cells. Importantly, we found that silencing BMI1 in CD133+ cells derived from 3 PDOX models did not affect most of the known genes previously associated with the activated BMI1, but modulated a novel set of core genes, including RPS6KA2, ALDH3A2, FMFB, DTL, API5, EIF4G2, KIF5c, LOC650152, C20ORF121, LOC203547, LOC653308, and LOC642489, to mediate the elimination of tumor formation. In summary, we identified the over-expressed BMI1 as a promising therapeutic target for glioma stem cells, and suggest that the signaling pathways associated with activated BMI1 in promoting tumor growth may be different from those induced by silencing BMI1 in blocking tumor formation. These findings highlighted the importance of careful re-analysis of the affected genes following the inhibition of abnormally activated oncogenic pathways to identify determinants that can potentially predict therapeutic efficacy. 
The expression of canonical histones is normally coupled to DNA synthesis during the S phase of the cell cycle. Replication-dependent histone mRNAs do not contain a poly(A) tail at their 3' terminus, but instead possess a stem-loop motif, the binding site for the stem-loop binding protein (SLBP), which regulates mRNA processing, stability, and relocation to polysomes. Here we show that the thyroid hormone can increase the levels of canonical histones independent of DNA replication. Incubation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts with T3 increases the total levels of histones, and expression of the thyroid hormone receptor Œ≤ induces a further increase. This is not restricted to mouse embryonic fibroblasts, because T3 also raises histone expression in other cell lines. T3 does not increase histone mRNA or SLBP levels, suggesting that T3 regulates histone expression by a posttranscriptional mechanism. Indeed, T3 enhanced translational efficiency, inducing relocation of histone mRNA to heavy polysomes. Increased translation was associated with augmented transcription of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 Œ≥2 (EIF4G2). T3 induced EIF4G2 protein and mRNA levels and the thyroid hormone receptor bound to the promoter region of the Eif4g2 gene. Induction of EIF4G2 was essential for T3-dependent histone induction, because depletion of this factor abolished histone increase. These results point out the importance of the thyroid hormones on the posttranscriptional regulation of histone biosynthesis in a cell cycle-independent manner and also suggest the potential regulation of eukaryotic translation by the modulation of the initiation factor EIF4G2, which also operates in the translation of canonical mRNAs. 
Missense mutations in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4-Œ≥ 1 (EIF4G1) gene have previously been implicated in familial Parkinson's disease (PD). A large PD family with autosomal-dominant segregation showed a heterozygous missense mutation and additional patients were found to have unique sequence variants that have not been observed in controls. Subsequent studies have reported contradictory findings.
We assessed the relevance of EIF4G1 mutations in a European cohort of 2146 PD patients. Of these, 2051 sporadic PD patients were screened for the reported p.Ala502Val and p.Arg1205His mutations. In addition, the complete coding region of EIF4G1 was directly sequenced in 95 familial PD patients with autosomal-dominant inheritance. Moreover, we imputed the p.Arg1205His substitution and tested for association with PD in the Icelandic population (93‚ÄÖ698 samples).
We did not observe the presence of the p.Ala502Val substitution in our cohort; however, the p.Arg1205His mutation was identified in one sporadic PD patient. The same mutation was also found in 76 Icelandic subjects older than 65‚ÄÖyears using haplotype imputing. Only five of these subjects reported PD symptoms (OR 1.3, p=0.50). Thus, if causal, the p.Arg1205His EIF4G1 mutation has a low penetrance or a late onset manifestation. A novel variant p.Arg566Cys found in a patient with familial PD did not cosegregate with PD in all three affected siblings. All further recently published EIF4G1 mutations found in our cohort are likely to be benign polymorphisms.
This is the largest genetic study of EIF4G1 mutations in PD. Our data do not support the EIF4G1 gene as a high-risk PD locus, neither for the familial nor the sporadic condition. Furthermore, the p.Arg1205His mutation is not significantly associated with increased risk of PD in the Icelandic population. Therefore, caution should be exercised when interpreting EIF4G1 genotyping results in isolated patients and PD families. In summary, diagnostic testing of EIF4G1 should not be recommended in clinical settings.
The superior frontal gyrus (SFG), an area of the brain frequently found to have reduced gray matter in patients with schizophrenia, is involved in self-awareness and emotion, which are impaired in schizophrenia. However, no genome-wide association studies of SFG volume have investigated in patients with schizophrenia. To identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with SFG volumes, we demonstrated a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of gray matter volumes in the right or left SFG of 158 patients with schizophrenia and 378 healthy subjects. We attempted to bioinformatically ascertain the potential effects of the top hit polymorphism on the expression levels of genes at the genome-wide region. We found associations between five variants on 1p36.12 and the right SFG volume at a widely used benchmark for genome-wide significance (P&lt;5.0 √ó 10(-8)). The strongest association was observed at rs4654899, an intronic SNP in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma, 3 (EIF4G3) gene on 1p36.12 (P=7.5 √ó 10(-9)). No SNP with genome-wide significance was found in the volume of the left SFG (P&gt;5.0 √ó 10(-8)); however, the rs4654899 polymorphism was identified as the locus with the second strongest association with the volume of the left SFG (P=1.5 √ó 10(-6)). In silico analyses revealed a proxy SNP of rs4654899 had effect on gene expression of two genes, HP1BP3 lying 3' to EIF4G3 (P=7.8 √ó 10(-6)) and CAPN14 at 2p (P=6.3 √ó 10(-6)), which are expressed in moderate-to-high levels throughout the adult human SFG. These results contribute to understand genetic architecture of a brain structure possibly linked to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.
Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), which is best known for degrading mRNAs with premature termination codons (PTCs), is thought to be triggered by aberrant translation termination at stop codons located in an environment of the mRNP that is devoid of signals necessary for proper termination. In mammals, the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABPC1) has been reported to promote correct termination and therewith antagonize NMD by interacting with the eukaryotic release factors 1 (eRF1) and 3 (eRF3). Using tethering assays in which proteins of interest are recruited as MS2 fusions to a NMD reporter transcript, we show that the three N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) of PABPC1 are sufficient to antagonize NMD, while the eRF3-interacting C-terminal domain is dispensable. The RRM1-3 portion of PABPC1 interacts with eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) and tethering of eIF4G to the NMD reporter also suppresses NMD. We identified the interactions of the eIF4G N-terminus with PABPC1 and the eIF4G core domain with eIF3 as two genetically separable features that independently enable tethered eIF4G to inhibit NMD. Collectively, our results reveal a function of PABPC1, eIF4G and eIF3 in translation termination and NMD suppression, and they provide additional evidence for a tight coupling between translation termination and initiation. 
Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) eliminates different classes of mRNA substrates including transcripts with long 3' UTRs. Current models of NMD suggest that the long physical distance between the poly(A) tail and the termination codon reduces the interaction between cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABPC1) and the eukaryotic release factor 3a (eRF3a) during translation termination. In the absence of PABPC1 binding, eRF3a recruits the NMD factor UPF1 to the terminating ribosome, triggering mRNA degradation. Here, we have used the MS2 tethering system to investigate the suppression of NMD by PABPC1. We show that tethering of PABPC1 between the termination codon and a long 3' UTR specifically inhibits NMD-mediated mRNA degradation. Contrary to the current model, tethered PABPC1 mutants unable to interact with eRF3a still efficiently suppress NMD. We find that the interaction of PABPC1 with eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G), which mediates the circularization of mRNAs, is essential for NMD inhibition by tethered PABPC1. Furthermore, recruiting either eRF3a or eIF4G in proximity to an upstream termination codon antagonizes NMD. While tethering of an eRF3a mutant unable to interact with PABPC1 fails to suppress NMD, tethered eIF4G inhibits NMD in a PABPC1-independent manner, indicating a sequential arrangement of NMD antagonizing factors. In conclusion, our results establish a previously unrecognized link between translation termination, mRNA circularization, and NMD suppression, thereby suggesting a revised model for the activation of NMD at termination codons upstream of long 3' UTR. 
In BRAF(V600)-mutant tumours, most mechanisms of resistance to drugs that target the BRAF and/or MEK kinases rely on reactivation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathway, on activation of the alternative, PI(3)K-AKT-mTOR, pathway (which is ERK independent) or on modulation of the caspase-dependent apoptotic cascade. All three pathways converge to regulate the formation of the eIF4F eukaryotic translation initiation complex, which binds to the 7-methylguanylate cap (m(7)G) at the 5' end of messenger RNA, thereby modulating the translation of specific mRNAs. Here we show that the persistent formation of the eIF4F complex, comprising the eIF4E cap-binding protein, the eIF4G scaffolding protein and the eIF4A RNA helicase, is associated with resistance to anti-BRAF, anti-MEK and anti-BRAF plus anti-MEK drug combinations in BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma, colon and thyroid cancer cell lines. Resistance to treatment and maintenance of eIF4F complex formation is associated with one of three mechanisms: reactivation of MAPK signalling, persistent ERK-independent phosphorylation of the inhibitory eIF4E-binding protein 4EBP1 or increased pro-apoptotic BCL-2-modifying factor (BMF)-dependent degradation of eIF4G. The development of an in situ method to detect the eIF4E-eIF4G interactions shows that eIF4F complex formation is decreased in tumours that respond to anti-BRAF therapy and increased in resistant metastases compared to tumours before treatment. Strikingly, inhibiting the eIF4F complex, either by blocking the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction or by targeting eIF4A, synergizes with inhibiting BRAF(V600) to kill the cancer cells. eIF4F not only appears to be an indicator of both innate and acquired resistance but also is a promising therapeutic target. Combinations of drugs targeting BRAF (and/or MEK) and eIF4F may overcome most of the resistance mechanisms arising in BRAF(V600)-mutant cancers. 
Memory retrieval, often termed reconsolidation, can render previously consolidated memories susceptible to manipulation that can lead to alterations in memory strength. Although it is known that reconsolidation requires mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)-dependent translation, the specific contributions of its downstream effectors in reconsolidation are unclear. Using auditory fear conditioning in mice, we investigated the role of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-eIF4G interactions and p70 S6 kinase polypeptide 1 (S6K1) in reconsolidation. We found that neither 4EGI-1 (2-[(4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-thiazol-2-ylhydrazono)-3-(2-nitrophenyl)]propionic acid), an inhibitor of eFI4E-eIF4G interactions, nor PF-4708671 [2-((4-(5-ethylpyrimidin-4-yl)piperazin-1-yl)methyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazole], an inhibitor of S6K1, alone blocked the reconsolidation of auditory fear memory. In contrast, using these drugs in concert to simultaneously block eIF4E-eIF4G interactions and S6K1 immediately after memory reactivation significantly attenuated fear memory reconsolidation. Moreover, the combination of 4EGI-1 and PF-4708671 further destabilized fear memory 10 d after memory reactivation, which was consistent with experiments using rapamycin, an mTORC1 inhibitor. Furthermore, inhibition of S6K1 immediately after retrieval resulted in memory destabilization 10 d after reactivation, whereas inhibition of eIF4E-eIF4G interactions did not. These results indicate that the reconsolidation of fear memory requires concomitant association of eIF4E to eIF4G as well as S6K1 activity and that the persistence of memory at longer intervals after memory reactivation also requires mTORC1-dependent processes that involve S6K1. These findings suggest a potential mechanism for how mTORC1-dependent translation is fine tuned to alter memory persistence.
Members of the eIF4E mRNA cap-binding family are involved in translation and the modulation of transcript availability in other systems as part of a three-component complex including eIF4G and eIF4A. The kinetoplastids possess four described eIF4E and five eIF4G homologs. We have identified two new eIF4E family proteins in Trypanosoma brucei, and define distinct complexes associated with the fifth member, TbEIF4E5. The cytosolic TbEIF4E5 protein binds cap 0 in vitro. TbEIF4E5 was found in association with two of the five TbEIF4Gs. TbIF4EG1 bound TbEIF4E5, a 47.5-kDa protein with two RNA-binding domains, and either the regulatory protein 14-3-3 II or a 117.5-kDa protein with guanylyltransferase and methyltransferase domains in a potentially dynamic interaction. The TbEIF4G2/TbEIF4E5 complex was associated with a 17.9-kDa hypothetical protein and both 14-3-3 variants I and II. Knockdown of TbEIF4E5 resulted in the loss of productive cell movement, as evidenced by the inability of the cells to remain in suspension in liquid culture and the loss of social motility on semisolid plating medium, as well as a minor reduction of translation. Cells appeared lethargic, as opposed to compromised in flagellar function per se. The minimal use of transcriptional control in kinetoplastids requires these organisms to implement downstream mechanisms to regulate gene expression, and the TbEIF4E5/TbEIF4G1/117.5-kDa complex in particular may be a key player in that process. We suggest that a pathway involved in cell motility is affected, directly or indirectly, by one of the TbEIF4E5 complexes. 
Internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements are high-order RNA structures that promote internal initiation of translation to allow protein synthesis under situations that compromise the general cap-dependent translation mechanism. Picornavirus IRES elements are highly efficient elements with a modular RNA structure organization. Here we investigated the effect of Mg(2+) concentration on the local flexibility and solvent accessibility of the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) IRES element measured on the basis of selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) reactivity and hydroxyl radical cleavage. We have found that Mg(2+) concentration affects the organization of discrete IRES regions, mainly the apical region of domain¬†3, the 10¬†nt loop of domain¬†4, and the pyrimidine tract of domain¬†5. In support of the effect of RNA structure on IRES activity, substitution or deletion mutants of the 10¬†nt loop of domain¬†4 impair internal initiation. In addition, divalent cations affect the binding of eIF4G, a eukaryotic initiation factor that is essential for IRES-dependent translation that interacts with domain¬†4. Binding of eIF4G is favored by the local RNA flexibility adopted at low Mg(2+) concentration, while eIF4B interacts with the IRES independently of the compactness of the RNA structure. Our study shows that the IRES element adopts a near-native structure in the absence of proteins, shedding light on the influence of Mg(2+) ions on the local flexibility and binding of eIF4G in a model IRES element. 
The aim of this study is to investigate whether EIF4A1, EIF4E, and EIF4G1 can serve as prognostic markers for patients with cervical cancer receiving preoperative brachytherapy.
Tissue microarrays composed of 35 normal cervix samples, 87 cervical cancers treated without preoperative therapy, and 50 pairs of cervical cancer tissues collected before and after preoperative brachytherapy were constructed and evaluated for the expression of EIF4A1, EIF4E, and EIF4G using immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemical staining was scored by the staining intensity and the percentages of tumor cells. The œá test was used to analyze the association between the immunohistochemistry results and clinicopathologic variables. The Kaplan-Meier method was applied to analyze the disease-specific survival.
Overexpression of EIF4A1, EIF4E, and EIF4G1 were detected in 83.9%, 84.7%, and 80.3% of cervical cancers, respectively, all of which were significantly related to advanced International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage, squamous cell histology, lymph node metastasis, and deep stromal invasion (P &lt; 0.05). The altered expression pattern of EIF4A1 and EIF4E after preoperative brachytherapy was significantly correlated with the cervical cancer response to brachytherapy (P = 0.029 and 0.012, respectively). The decreased expression of EIF4A1 predicted better tumor-specific survival (P = 0.02). The alteration of EIF4A1 was an independent predictor for tumor-specific survival (P = 0.047; hazards ratio, 0.272; 95% confidence interval, 0.076-0.982).
Overexpression of EIF4A1, EIF4E, and EIF4G1 were acquired malignant phenotypic features of cervical cancer. EIF4A1 might function as a novel prognostic indicator and a potential therapeutic target for cervical cancer.
Trypanosomes lack the transcriptional control characteristic of the majority of eukaryotes that is mediated by gene-specific promoters in a one-gene-one-promoter arrangement. Rather, their genomes are transcribed in large polycistrons with no obvious functional linkage. Posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression must thus play a larger role in these organisms. The eIF4E homolog TbEIF4E6 binds mRNA cap analogs in vitro and is part of a complex in vivo that may fulfill such a role. Knockdown of TbEIF4E6 tagged with protein A-tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site-protein C to approximately 15% of the normal expression level resulted in viable cells that displayed a set of phenotypes linked to detachment of the flagellum from the length of the cell body, if not outright flagellum loss. While these cells appeared and behaved as normal under stationary liquid culture conditions, standard centrifugation resulted in a marked increase in flagellar detachment. Furthermore, the ability of TbEIF4E6-depleted cells to engage in social motility was reduced. The TbEIF4E6 protein forms a cytosolic complex containing a triad of proteins, including the eIF4G homolog TbEIF4G5 and a hypothetical protein of 70.3 kDa, referred to as TbG5-IP. The TbG5-IP analysis revealed two domains with predicted secondary structures conserved in mRNA capping enzymes: nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase and guanylyltransferase. These complex members have the potential for RNA interaction, either via the 5' cap structure for TbEIF4E6 and TbG5-IP or through RNA-binding domains in TbEIF4G5. The associated proteins provide a signpost for future studies to determine how this complex affects capped RNA molecules. 
The 4EGI-1 is the prototypic inhibitor of eIF4E/eIF4G interaction, a potent inhibitor of translation initiation in vitro and in vivo and an efficacious anticancer agent in animal models of human cancers. We report on the design, synthesis, and in vitro characterization of a series of rigidified mimetic of this prototypic inhibitor in which the phenyl in the 2-(4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)thiazol-2-yl) moiety was bridged into a tricyclic system. The bridge consisted one of the following: ethylene, methylene oxide, methylenesulfide, methylenesulfoxide, and methylenesulfone. Numerous analogues in this series were found to be markedly more potent than the parent prototypic inhibitor in the inhibition of eIF4E/eIF4G interaction, thus preventing the eIF4F complex formation, a rate limiting step in the translation initiation cascade in eukaryotes, and in inhibition of human cancer cell proliferation.
Over the last 16¬†years, insights in clinical and genetic characteristics of Parkinson's disease (PD) have increased substantially. We summarize the clinical, genetic, and pathological findings of autosomal dominant PD linked to mutations in SNCA, leucine-rich repeat kinase 2, vacuolar protein sorting-35, and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma 1 and autosomal recessive PD linked to parkin,PINK1, and DJ-1, as well as autosomal recessive complicated parkinsonian syndromes caused by mutations in ATP13A2,FBXO7,PLA2G6,SYNJ1, and DNAJC6. We also review the advances in high- and low-risk genetic susceptibility factors and present multisystem disorders that may present with parkinsonism as the major clinical feature and provide recommendations for prioritization of genetic testing. Finally, we consider the challenges of future genetic research in PD.
The control of mRNA translation has been mainly explored in response to activated tyrosine kinase receptors. In contrast, mechanistic details on the translational machinery are far less available in the case of ligand-bound G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). In this study, using the FSH receptor (FSH-R) as a model receptor, we demonstrate that part of the translational regulations occurs by phosphorylation of the translation pre-initiation complex scaffold protein, eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G), in HEK293 cells stably expressing the FSH-R. This phosphorylation event occurred when eIF4G was bound to the mRNA 5' cap, and probably involves mammalian target of rapamycin. This regulation might contribute to cap-dependent translation in response to FSH. The cap-binding protein eIF4E also had its phosphorylation level enhanced upon FSH stimulation. We also show that FSH-induced signaling not only led to cap-dependent translation but also to internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent translation of some mRNA. These data add detailed information on the molecular bases underlying the regulation of selective mRNA translation by a GPCR, and a topological model recapitulating these mechanisms is proposed. 
Protein-protein interactions are critical for regulating the activity of translation initiation factors and multitude of other cellular process, and form the largest block of untapped albeit most challenging targets for drug development. 4EGI-1, (E/Z)-2-(2-(4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)thiazol-2-yl)hydrazono)-3-(2-nitrophenyl)propanoic acid, is a hit compound discovered in a screening campaign of small molecule libraries as an inhibitor of translation initiation factors eIF4E and eIF4G protein-protein interaction; it inhibits translation initiation in¬†vitro and in¬†vivo. A series of 4EGI-1-derived thiazol-2-yl hydrazones have been designed and synthesized in order to delineate the structural latitude and improve its binding affinity to eIF4E, and increase its potency in inhibiting the eIF4E/eIF4G interaction. Probing a wide range of substituents on both phenyl rings comprising the 3-phenylpropionic acid and 4-phenylthiazolidine moieties in the context of both E- and Z-isomers of 4EGI-1 led to analogs with enhanced binding affinity and translation initiation inhibitory activities. 
Proteolysis by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway appears to have a complex role in synaptic plasticity, but its various functions remain to be elucidated. Using late phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP) in the hippocampus of the mouse as a model for long-term synaptic plasticity, we previously showed that inhibition of the proteasome enhances induction but blocks maintenance of L-LTP. In this study, we investigated the possible mechanisms by which proteasome inhibition has opposite effects on L-LTP induction and maintenance. Our results show that inhibiting phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase or blocking the interaction between eukaryotic initiation factors 4E (eIF4E) and 4G (eIF4G) reduces the enhancement of L-LTP induction brought about by proteasome inhibition suggesting interplay between proteolysis and the signaling pathway mediated by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Also, proteasome inhibition leads to accumulation of translational activators in the mTOR pathway such as eIF4E and eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) early during L-LTP causing increased induction. Furthermore, inhibition of the proteasome causes a buildup of translational repressors, such as polyadenylate-binding protein interacting protein 2 (Paip2) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 2 (4E-BP2), during late stages of L-LTP contributing to the blockade of L-LTP maintenance. Thus, the proteasome plays a critical role in regulating protein synthesis during L-LTP by tightly controlling translation. Our results provide novel mechanistic insights into the interplay between protein degradation and protein synthesis in long-term synaptic plasticity. 
4EGI-1, the prototypic inhibitor of eIF4E/eIF4G interaction, was identified in a high-throughput screening of small-molecule libraries with the aid of a fluorescence polarization assay that measures inhibition of binding of an eIF4G-derived peptide to recombinant eIF4E. As such, the molecular probe 4EGI-1 has potential for the study of molecular mechanisms involved in human disorders characterized by loss of physiological restraints on translation initiation. A hit-to-lead optimization campaign was carried out to overcome the configurational instability in 4EGI-1, which stems from the E-to-Z isomerization of the hydrazone function. We identified compound 1‚Äâa, in which the labile hydrazone was incorporated into a rigid indazole scaffold, as a promising rigidified 4EGI-1 mimetic lead. In a structure-activity relationship study directed towards probing the structural latitude of this new chemotype as an inhibitor of eIF4E/eIF4G interaction and translation initiation we identified 1‚Äâd, an indazole-based 4EGI-1 mimetic, as a new and improved lead inhibitor of eIF4E/eIF4G interaction and a promising molecular probe candidate for elucidation of the role of cap-dependent translation initiation in a host of pathophysiological states.
The simultaneous interaction of poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) and the mRNA 3' poly(A) tail promotes translation initiation. We previously showed that the interaction of PABP-interacting protein 1 (Paip1) with PABP and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3; via the eIF3g subunit) further stimulates translation. Here, we demonstrate that the interaction of eIF3 with Paip1 is regulated by amino acids through the mTORC1 signaling pathway. The Paip1-eIF3 interaction is impaired by the mTORC1 inhibitors, rapamycin and PP242. We show that ribosomal protein S6 kinases 1 and 2 (S6K1/2) promote the interaction of eIF3 with Paip1. The enhancement of Paip1-eIF3 interaction by amino acids is abrogated by an S6K inhibitor or shRNA against S6K1/2. S6K1 interacts with eIF3f and, in vitro, phosphorylates eIF3. Finally, we show that S6K inhibition leads to a reduction in translation by Paip1. We propose that S6K1/2 phosphorylate eIF3 to stimulate Paip1-eIF3 interaction and consequent translation initiation. Taken together, these data demonstrate that eIF3 is a new translation target of the mTOR/S6K pathway. 
eIF4E is frequently over-expressed in different cancers and causes increased translation of oncogenic proteins via deregulated cap-dependent translation. Inhibitors of the eIF4E:eIF4G interactions represent an approach that would normalize cap-dependent translation. Stapled peptides represent an emerging class of therapeutics that can target protein: protein interactions. We present here molecular dynamics simulations for a set of rationally designed stapled peptides in solution and in complex with eIF4E, supported with biophysical and crystallographic data. Clustering of the simulated structures revealed the favoured conformational states of the stapled peptides in their bound or free forms in solution. Identifying these populations has allowed us to design peptides with improved affinities by introducing mutations into the peptide sequence to alter their conformational distributions. These studies emphasise the effects that engineered mutations have on the conformations of free and bound peptides, and illustrate that both states must be considered in efforts to attain high affinity binding. 
During mitosis, global translation is suppressed, while synthesis of proteins with vital mitotic roles must go on. Prior evidence suggests that the mitotic translation shift involves control of initiation. Yet, no signals specifically targeting translation initiation factors during mitosis have been identified. We used phosphoproteomics to investigate the central translation initiation scaffold and "ribosome adaptor," eukaryotic initiation factor 4G1 (eIF4G1) in interphase or nocodazole-arrested mitotic cells. This approach and kinase inhibition assays, in vitro phosphorylation with recombinant kinase, and kinase depletion-reconstitution experiments revealed that Ser1232 in eIF4G1 is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1):cyclin B during mitosis. Ser1232 is located in an unstructured region of the C-terminal portion of eIF4G1 that coordinates assembly of the eIF4G/-4A/-4B helicase complex and binding of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal-integrating kinase, Mnk. Intense phosphorylation of Ser1232 in mitosis strongly enhanced the interactions of eIF4A with HEAT domain 2 of eIF4G and decreased association of eIF4G/-4A with RNA. Our findings implicate phosphorylation of eIF4G1(Ser1232) by Cdk1:cyclin B and its inhibitory effects on eIF4A helicase activity in the mitotic translation initiation shift. 
Recruitment of mRNA to the 40S ribosomal subunit requires the coordinated interaction of a large number of translation initiation factors. In mammals, the direct interaction between eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) and eIF3 is thought to act as the molecular bridge between the mRNA cap-binding complex and the 40S subunit. A discrete ‚àº90 amino acid domain in eIF4G is responsible for binding to eIF3, but the identity of the eIF3 subunit(s) involved is less clear. The eIF3e subunit has been shown to directly bind eIF4G, but the potential role of other eIF3 subunits in stabilizing this interaction has not been investigated. It is also not clear if the eIF4A helicase plays a role in stabilizing the interaction between eIF4G and eIF3. Here, we have used a fluorescence anisotropy assay to demonstrate that eIF4G binds to eIF3 independently of eIF4A binding to the middle region of eIF4G. By using a site-specific cross-linking approach, we unexpectedly show that the eIF4G-binding surface in eIF3 is comprised of the -c, -d and -e subunits. Screening multiple cross-linker positions reveals that eIF4G contains two distinct eIF3-binding subdomains within the previously identified eIF3-binding domain. Finally, by employing an eIF4G-dependent translation assay, we establish that both of these subdomains are required for efficient mRNA recruitment to the ribosome and stimulate translation. Our study reveals unexpected complexity to the eIF3-eIF4G interaction that provides new insight into the regulation of mRNA recruitment to the human ribosome. 
Internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements fold into highly organized conserved secondary and probably tertiary structures that guide the ribosome to an internal site of the RNA at the IRES 3'end. The composition of the cellular proteome is under the control of multiple processes, one of the most important being translation initiation. In each poliovirus Sabin vaccine strain, a single point mutation in the IRES secondary-structure domain V is a major determinant of neurovirulence and translation attenuation. Here we are extrapolating poliovirus findings to a genomic related virus named coxsackievirus B3 CVB3); a causative agent of viral myocarditis. We have previously reported that Sabin3-like mutation (U473 ‚Üí C) introduced in the domain V sequence of the CVB3 IRES led to a defective mutant with a serious reduction in translation efficiency and ribosomal initiation complex assembly, besides an impaired RNA-protein binding pattern. With the aim to identify proteins interacting with both CVB3 wild-type and Sabin3-like domain V RNAs and to assess the effect of the Sabin3-like mutation on these potential interactions, we have used a proteomic approach. This procedure allowed the identification of three RNA-binding proteins interacting with the domain V: eIF4G (p220), eIF3b (p116) and eIF4B (p80). Moreover, we report that this single-nucleotide exchange impairs the interaction pattern and the binding affinity of these standard translation initiation factors within the IRES domain V of the mutant strain. Taken together, these data indicate how this decisive Sabin3-like mutation mediates viral translation attenuation; playing a key role in the understanding of the cardiovirulence attenuation within this construct. Hence, these data provide further evidence for the crucial role of RNA structure for the IRES activity, and reinforce the idea of a distribution of function between the different IRES structural domains.

Development of progressive muscle spasticity resulting from spinal traumatic injury can be mediated by loss of local segmental inhibition and/or by an increased sensory afferent drive with resulting exacerbated Œ±-motoneuron activity. To identify potential contributions of neuroactive substances in the development of such spasticity state, we employed a well-defined spinal injury-evoked spasticity rat model. Signaling molecules were analyzed in the spinal parenchyma below the level of spinal injury and in the corresponding dorsal root ganglion cells using Kinex‚Ñ¢ antibody microarrays. The results uncovered the involvement of angiogenesis and neurodegeneration pathways together with direct cross-talk mediated by several hub proteins with SH-2 domains. At 2 and 5weeks after transection, up-regulation of several proteins including CaMKIV, RONŒ± and PKCŒ¥ as well as MAPK3/ERK1 phosphorylation was observed in the spinal ventral horns. Our results indicate that these signaling molecules and their neuronal effector systems cannot only play an important role in the initiation but also in the maintenance of spasticity states after spinal trauma. The exclusivity of specific protein changes observed in lumbar spinal parenchyma but not in dorsal root ganglia indicates that new treatment strategies should primarily target specific spinal segments to prevent or attenuate spasticity states.
Development of progressive muscle spasticity and rigidity represents a serious complication associated with spinal ischemic or traumatic injury. Signaling proteins, including their phosphorylation status, were analyzed in the spinal parenchyma below the level of spinal injury and in the corresponding dorsal root ganglion cells in a rat model of spinal injury using Kinex‚Ñ¢ antibody microarrays. The results uncovered direct protein interaction mediated cross-talk between angiogenesis and neurodegeneration pathways, which may significantly contribute to the healing process in the damaged region. Importantly, we identified several target proteins exclusively observed in the spinal lumbar ventral horns, where such proteins may not only play an important role in the initiation but also in the maintenance of spasticity states after spinal trauma. Hence, potential new treatment strategies such as gene silencing or drug treatment should primarily target spinal parenchymal sites at and around the injury epicenter and most likely employ intrathecal or targeted spinal segment-specific vector or drug delivery. We believe that this work will stimulate future translational research, ultimately leading to the improvement of quality of life of patients with spinal traumatic injury.
In metazoans, replication-dependent histone mRNAs end in a stem-loop structure instead of the poly(A) tail characteristic of all other mature mRNAs. This specialized 3' end is bound by stem-loop binding protein (SLBP), a protein that participates in the nuclear export and translation of histone mRNAs. The translational activity of SLBP is mediated by interaction with SLIP1, a middle domain of initiation factor 4G (MIF4G)-like protein that connects to translation initiation. We determined the 2.5 √Ö resolution crystal structure of zebrafish SLIP1 bound to the translation-activation domain of SLBP and identified the determinants of the recognition. We discovered a SLIP1-binding motif (SBM) in two additional proteins: the translation initiation factor eIF3g and the mRNA-export factor DBP5. We confirmed the binding of SLIP1 to DBP5 and eIF3g by pull-down assays and determined the 3.25 √Ö resolution structure of SLIP1 bound to the DBP5 SBM. The SBM-binding and homodimerization residues of SLIP1 are conserved in the MIF4G domain of CBP80/20-dependent translation initiation factor (CTIF). The results suggest how the SLIP1 homodimer or a SLIP1-CTIF heterodimer can function as platforms to bridge SLBP with SBM-containing proteins involved in different steps of mRNA metabolism. 
Translation control often operates via remodeling of messenger ribonucleoprotein particles. The poly(A) binding protein (PABP) simultaneously interacts with the 3' poly(A) tail of the mRNA and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) to stimulate translation. PABP also promotes miRNA-dependent deadenylation and translational repression of target mRNAs. We demonstrate that isoform 2 of the mouse heterogeneous nuclear protein Q (hnRNP-Q2/SYNCRIP) binds poly(A) by default when PABP binding is inhibited. In addition, hnRNP-Q2 competes with PABP for binding to poly(A) in vitro. Depleting hnRNP-Q2 from translation extracts stimulates cap-dependent and IRES-mediated translation that is dependent on the PABP/poly(A) complex. Adding recombinant hnRNP-Q2 to the extracts inhibited translation in a poly(A) tail-dependent manner. The displacement of PABP from the poly(A) tail by hnRNP-Q2 impaired the association of eIF4E with the 5' m(7)G cap structure of mRNA, resulting in the inhibition of 48S and 80S ribosome initiation complex formation. In mouse fibroblasts, silencing of hnRNP-Q2 stimulated translation. In addition, hnRNP-Q2 impeded let-7a miRNA-mediated deadenylation and repression of target mRNAs, which require PABP. Thus, by competing with PABP, hnRNP-Q2 plays important roles in the regulation of global translation and miRNA-mediated repression of specific mRNAs.
Neurology has been one of the leaders in applying the developing tools of genetics to understand the etiology of disease. This extends as far back as the early 1980s, when the then-new methods of detecting DNA variation (restriction fragment length polymorphisms) were combined with relatively new analytical methods (linkage analysis) to identify the location of the Huntington disease gene,(1) Alzheimer disease genes,(2) and a Parkinson disease (PD) gene.(3) Extremely rare highly penetrant mutations in these genes are causative for disease. These discoveries redirected entire fields of study and greatly improved our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology. However, they directly explain just a tiny portion of the genetic causes of their disease.
Recently, vacuolar protein sorting 35 (VPS35) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma 1 (EIF4G1) have been identified as 2 causal Parkinson disease (PD) genes. We used whole exome sequencing for rapid, parallel analysis of variations in these 2 genes.
We performed whole exome sequencing in 213 patients with PD and 272 control individuals. Those rare variants (RVs) with &lt;5% frequency in the exome variant server database and our own control data were considered for analysis. We performed joint gene-based tests for association using RVASSOC and SKAT (Sequence Kernel Association Test) as well as single-variant test statistics.
We identified 3 novel VPS35 variations that changed the coded amino acid (nonsynonymous) in 3 cases. Two variations were in multiplex families and neither segregated with PD. In EIF4G1, we identified 11 (9 nonsynonymous and 2 small indels) RVs including the reported pathogenic mutation p.R1205H, which segregated in all affected members of a large family, but also in 1 unaffected 86-year-old family member. Two additional RVs were found in isolated patients only. Whereas initial association studies suggested an association (p = 0.04) with all RVs in EIF4G1, subsequent testing in a second dataset for the driving variant (p.F1461) suggested no association between RVs in the gene and PD.
We confirm that the specific EIF4G1 variation p.R1205H seems to be a strong PD risk factor, but is nonpenetrant in at least one 86-year-old. A few other select RVs in both genes could not be ruled out as causal. However, there was no evidence for an overall contribution of genetic variability in VPS35 or EIF4G1 to PD development in our dataset.
Proliferating tumor cells require continuous protein synthesis. De novo synthesis of most proteins is regulated through cap-dependent translation. Cellular stress such as ionizing radiation (IR) blocks cap-dependent translation resulting in shut-down of global protein translation which saves resources and energy needed for the stress response. At the same time, levels of proteins required for stress response are maintained or even increased. The study aimed to analyze the regulation of signaling pathways controlling protein translation in response to IR and the impact on Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic and radioprotective protein, which levels rapidly decline upon IR.
Protein levels and processing were analyzed by Western blot. The assembly of the translational pre-initiation complex was examined by Immunoprecipitation and pull-down experiments with 7-methyl GTP agarose. To analyze IR-induced cell death, dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential and DNA fragmentation were determined by flow cytometry. Protein levels of the different initiation factors were down-regulated using RNA interference approach.
IR induced caspase-dependent cleavage of the translational initiation factors eIF4G1, eIF3A, and eIF4B resulting in disassembly of the cap-dependent initiation complex. In addition, DAP5-dependent initiation complex that regulates IRES-dependent translation was disassembled in response to IR. Moreover, IR resulted in dephosphorylation of 4EBP1, an inhibitor of cap-dependent translation upstream of caspase activation. However, knock-down of eIF4G1, eIF4B, DAP5, or 4EBP1 did not affect IR-induced decline of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1.
Our data shows that cap-dependent translation is regulated at several levels in response to IR. However, the experiments indicate that IR-induced Mcl-1 decline is not a consequence of translational inhibition in Jurkat cells.
The 3'-untranslated regions of many plant viral RNAs contain cap-independent translation elements (CITEs) that drive translation initiation at the 5'-end of the mRNA. The barley yellow dwarf virus-like CITE (BTE) stimulates translation by binding the eIF4G subunit of translation initiation factor eIF4F with high affinity. To understand this interaction, we characterized the dynamic structural properties of the BTE, mapped the eIF4G-binding sites on the BTE and identified a region of eIF4G that is crucial for BTE binding. BTE folding involves cooperative uptake of magnesium ions and is driven primarily by charge neutralization. Footprinting experiments revealed that functional eIF4G fragments protect the highly conserved stem-loop I and a downstream bulge. The BTE forms a functional structure in the absence of protein, and the loop that base pairs the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) remains solvent-accessible at high eIF4G concentrations. The region in eIF4G between the eIF4E-binding site and the MIF4G region is required for BTE binding and translation. The data support the model in which the eIF4F complex binds directly to the BTE which base pairs simultaneously to the 5'-UTR, allowing eIF4F to recruit the 40S ribosomal subunit to the 5'-end.
Targeted disruption in mice of the gene encoding D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (Phgdh) results in embryonic lethality associated with a striking reduction in free L-serine and growth retardation including severe brain malformation. We previously observed a severe impairment in neurogenesis of the central nervous system of Phgdh knockout (KO) embryos and a reduction in the protein content of their brains. Although these findings suggest that L-serine deficiency links attenuation of mRNA translation to severe developmental malformation of the central nervous system, the underlying key molecular event remains unexplored. Here we demonstrate that mRNA of Eif4ebp1 encoding eukaryotic initiation factor 4 binding protein 1 and its protein, 4E-BP1, are markedly induced in the central nervous system of Phgdh KO embryos, whereas a modest induction is observed in the liver. The increase in 4E-BP1 was associated with a decrease in the cap initiation complex in the brain, as shown by lower levels of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G bound to eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and increased eIF4E interaction with 4E-BP1 based on 7-methyl-GTP chromatography. eIF4E protein and polysomes were also diminished in Phgdh KO embryos. Induction of Eif4ebp1 mRNA and of 4E-BP1 was reproduced in mouse embryonic fibroblasts established from Phgdh KO embryos under the condition of L-serine deprivation. Induction of Eif4ebp1 mRNA was suppressed only when L-serine was supplemented in the culture medium, indicating that reduced L-serine availability regulates the induction of Eif4ebp1/4E-BP1. These data suggest that elevated levels of 4E-BP1 may be involved in a mechanism to arrest brain development in Phgdh KO embryos.
Translational regulation of the p53 mRNA can determine the ratio between p53 and its N-terminal truncated isoforms and therefore has a significant role in determining p53-regulated signaling pathways. Although its importance in cell fate decisions has been demonstrated repeatedly, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms that determine this ratio. Two internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) residing within the 5'UTR and the coding sequence of p53 mRNA drive the translation of full-length p53 and Œî40p53 isoform, respectively. Here, we report that DAP5, a translation initiation factor shown to positively regulate the translation of various IRES containing mRNAs, promotes IRES-driven translation of p53 mRNA. Upon DAP5 depletion, p53 and Œî40p53 protein levels were decreased, with a greater effect on the N-terminal truncated isoform. Functional analysis using bicistronic vectors driving the expression of a reporter gene from each of these two IRESs indicated that DAP5 preferentially promotes translation from the second IRES residing in the coding sequence. Furthermore, p53 mRNA expressed from a plasmid carrying this second IRES was selectively shifted to lighter polysomes upon DAP5 knockdown. Consequently, Œî40p53 protein levels and the subsequent transcriptional activation of the 14-3-3œÉ gene, a known target of Œî40p53, were strongly reduced. In addition, we show here that DAP5 interacts with p53 IRES elements in in vitro and in vivo binding studies, proving for the first time that DAP5 directly binds a target mRNA. Thus, through its ability to regulate IRES-dependent translation of the p53 mRNA, DAP5 may control the ratio between different p53 isoforms encoded by a single mRNA. 
Resistance of translation of some eukaryotic messenger RNAs (mRNAs) to inactivation of the cap-binding factor eIF4E under unfavorable conditions is well documented. To date, it is the mechanism of internal ribosome entry that is predominantly thought to underlay this stress tolerance. However, many cellular mRNAs that had been considered to contain internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) failed to pass stringent control tests for internal initiation, thus raising the question of how they are translated under stress conditions. Here, we show that inserting an eIF4G-binding element from a virus IRES into 5'-UTRs of strongly cap-dependent mRNAs dramatically reduces their requirement for the 5'-terminal m(7)G-cap, though such cap-independent translation remains dependent on a vacant 5'-terminus of these mRNAs. Importantly, direct binding of eIF4G to the 5'-UTR of mRNA makes its translation resistant to eIF4F inactivation both in vitro and in vivo. These data may substantiate a new paradigm of translational control under stress to complement IRES-driven mechanism of translation.
Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F), comprising the cap-binding protein eIF4E, the helicase eIF4A, and the central scaffold eIF4G, is a convergence node for a complex signaling network that controls protein synthesis. Together with eIF3 and eIF4A/4B, eIF4G recruits ribosomal subunits to mRNAs and facilitates 5' untranslated region unwinding. Mammalian eIF4G contains three HEAT domains and unstructured regions involved in protein-protein interactions. Despite detailed eIF4G structure data, the mechanisms controlling initiation scaffold formation remain obscure. We found a new, highly regulated eIF4B/-3 binding site within the HEAT-1/-2 interdomain linker, harboring two phosphorylation sites that we identified as substrates for Erk1/2 and casein kinase 2. Phorbol ester-induced sequential phosphorylation of both sites detached HEAT-2 from the complex with eIF4A/-4B/-3 and stimulated the association of HEAT-3 with the mitogen-activated protein kinase signal integrating kinase Mnk1. Our results provide a mechanistic link between intracellular signal transduction and dynamic initiation complex formation coordinated by flexible eIF4G structure.
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) in the growth factor receptor (GFR) pathway is a crucial metabolic sensor that integrates growth factor signals in cells. We recently showed that human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 exposure activates signaling from GFRs in human keratinocytes. Thus, we predicted that the virus would induce the PI3K/mTOR pathway upon interaction with host cells. We detected activation of Akt and mTOR several minutes following exposure of human keratinocytes to HPV type 16 (HPV16) pseudovirions. Activated mTOR induced phosphorylation of the mTOR complex 1 substrates 4E-BP1 and S6K, which led to induction of the functional protein translational machinery. Blockade of epidermal GFR (EGFR) signaling revealed that each of these events is at least partially dependent upon EGFR activation. Importantly, activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling inhibited autophagy in the early stages of virus-host cell interaction. Biochemical and genetic approaches revealed critical roles for mTOR activation and autophagy suppression in HPV16 early infection events. In summary, the HPV-host cell interaction stimulates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and inhibits autophagy, and in combination these events benefit virus infection.
Many eukaryotes encode multiple isoforms of the cap-binding translation initiation factor (eIF4E). Leishmanias and other trypanosomatids encode four paralogs of this protein, but none can complement the eIF4E function in a yeast mutant. A low conservation is observed between the four paralogs, suggesting they assist these organisms survive a multitude of conditions encountered throughout the life cycle. Earlier attempts to decipher their function led to identification of LeishIF4E-4 as the canonical translation initiation factor. LeishIF4E-1 appears to function during thermal stress, via a mechanism not yet understood. LeishIF4E-3 hardly binds cap-4 and is, therefore, less likely to serve as a typical initiation factor. Although it interacts with an eIF4G homolog, LeishIF4G-4, the two polypeptides do not co-migrate on sucrose gradients. While LeishIF4E-3 enters large particles that increase in size during nutritional stress, LeishIF4G-4 is found only in the top fractions. Confocal microscopy localized LeishIF4E-3 (but not LeishIF4G-4) within nutritional stress-induced granules. Accordingly, interaction between the two proteins reduced upon starvation. We therefore propose that under normal conditions, LeishIF4G-4 sequesters LeishIF4E-3 in the cytoplasm. During a nutritional stress, LeishIF4E-3 is modified and released from LeishIF4G-4 to enter stress granules, where inactive mRNAs are stored. Binding of LeishIF4G-4 to LeishIF4E-3 requires a short peptide within the LeishIF4G-4 N-terminus, which bears no similarity to the consensus 4E-binding peptide, YXXXXLŒ¶. Mutational analysis combined with structure prediction indicates that this interaction is based on an obligatory, conserved Œ± helix in LeishIF4G-4. These features further highlight the uniqueness of LeishIF4E-3 and how it interacts with its binding partners.
We recently reported a missense mutation and four variants in eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4-gamma (EIF4G1) associated with parkinsonism, dementia or both. In those with a positive family history, the mode of inheritance was autosomal dominant. Detailed neuropathologic descriptions of individuals with EIF4G1 genetic variants have not been reported. Herein, we report neuropathologic findings of three individuals from two American families with EIF4G1 variants. The patients had initial clinical presentations of dementia or parkinsonism and all had dementia at the time of autopsy. One family carried an EIF4G1 double variant, c.2056G&gt;T (p.G686C) and c.3589C&gt;T (p.R1197¬†W), and one family carried variant c.1505C&gt;T (p.A502V). All three patients also carried at least one Œµ4 allele of apolipoprotein E. One individual presented with cognitive impairment without significant parkinsonism; one presented with memory problems followed by bradykinesia; and the third presented with cardinal signs of Parkinson's disease, followed more than a year later by cognitive dysfunction. Pathological examination showed diffuse cortical Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in all patients. A small subset of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites were immunopositive for eIF4G1. All patients had moderate to frequent non-neuritic, cortical amyloid plaques, mostly medial temporal neurofibrillary pathology (Braak neurofibrillary tangle stages of II to IV), and minimal or no TDP-43 pathology. The results suggest that in some patients variants in EIF4G1 can be associated with pathology that has a high likelihood of association with clinical features of dementia with Lewy bodies.
Many RNA-binding proteins contain multiple single-strand nucleic acid-binding domains and assemble into large multiprotein messenger ribonucleic acid protein (mRNP) complexes. The mechanisms underlying the self-assembly of these complexes are largely unknown. In eukaryotes, the association of the translation factors polyadenylate-binding protein-1 (PABP) and eIF4G is essential for high-level expression of polyadenylated mRNAs. Here, we report the crystal structure of the ternary complex poly(A)(11)¬∑PABP(1-190)¬∑eIF4G(178-203) at 2.0 √Ö resolution. Our NMR and crystallographic data show that eIF4G interacts with the RRM2 domain of PABP. Analysis of the interaction by small-angle X-ray scattering, isothermal titration calorimetry, and electromobility shift assays reveals that this interaction is allosterically regulated by poly(A) binding to PABP. Furthermore, we have confirmed the importance of poly(A) for the endogenous PABP and eIF4G interaction in immunoprecipitation experiments using HeLa cell extracts. Our findings reveal interdomain allostery as a mechanism for cooperative assembly of RNP complexes.
The extreme resistance to Turnip mosaic virus observed in the Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa) line, BP8407, is monogenic and recessive. Bulked segregant analysis was carried out to identify simple sequence repeat and Indel markers linked to this recessive resistance gene, termed recessive Turnip mosaic virus resistance 02 (retr02). Mapping of PCR-specific Indel markers on 239 individuals of a BP8407 √ó Ji Zao Chun F(2) population, located this resistance gene to a 0.9-cM interval between two Indel markers (BrID10694 and BrID101309) and in scaffold000060 or scaffold000104 on chromosome A04 of the B. rapa genome. Eleven eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and 14 eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) genes are predicted in the B. rapa genome. A candidate gene, Bra035393 on scaffold000104, was predicted within the mapped resistance locus. The gene encodes the eIF(iso)4E protein. Bra035393 was sequenced in BP8407 and Ji Zao Chun. A polymorphism (A/G) was found in exon 3 between BP8407 and Ji Zao Chun. This gene was analysed in four resistant and three susceptible lines. A correlation was observed between the amino acid substitution (Gly/Asp) in the eIF(iso)4E protein and resistance/susceptibility. eIF(iso)4E has been shown previously to interact with the TuMV genome-linked protein, VPg.
Shortening eukaryotic poly(A) tails represses mRNA translation and induces mRNA turnover. The major cytoplasmic deadenylase, the Ccr4-Not complex, is a conserved multisubunit assembly. Ccr4-Not is organized around Not1, a large scaffold protein that recruits two 3'-5' exoribonucleases, Caf1 and Ccr4. We report structural studies showing that the N-terminal arm of yeast Not1 has a HEAT-repeat structure with domains related to the MIF4G fold. A MIF4G domain positioned centrally within the Not1 protein recognizes Caf1, which in turn binds the LRR domain of Ccr4 and tethers the Ccr4 nuclease domain. The interactions that form the nuclease core of the Ccr4-Not complex are evolutionarily conserved. Their specific disruption affects cell growth and mRNA deadenylation and decay in vivo in yeast. Thus, the N-terminal arm of Not1 forms an extended platform reminiscent of scaffolding proteins like eIF4G and CBP80, and places the two nucleases in a pivotal position within the Ccr4-Not complex.
Circadian rhythms are driven by gene expression feedback loops in metazoans. Based on the success of genetic screens for circadian mutants in Drosophila melanogaster, we undertook a targeted RNAi screen to study the impact of translation control genes on circadian locomotor activity rhythms in flies. Knockdown of vital translation factors in timeless protein-positive circadian neurons caused a range of effects including lethality. Knockdown of the atypical translation factor NAT1 had the strongest effect and lengthened circadian period. It also dramatically reduced PER protein levels in pigment dispersing factor (PDF) neurons. BELLE (BEL) protein was also reduced by the NAT1 knockdown, presumably reflecting a role of NAT1 in belle mRNA translation. belle and NAT1 are also targets of the key circadian transcription factor Clock (CLK). Further evidence for a role of NAT1 is that inhibition of the target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase increased oscillator activity in cultured wings, which is absent under conditions of NAT1 knockdown. Moreover, the per 5'- and 3'-UTRs may function together to facilitate cap-independent translation under conditions of TOR inhibition. We suggest that NAT1 and cap-independent translation are important for per mRNA translation, which is also important for the circadian oscillator. A circadian translation program may be especially important in fly pacemaker cells.
A variety of stress conditions induce mRNA and protein aggregation into mRNA silencing foci, but the signalling pathways mediating these responses are still elusive. Previously we demonstrated that PKA catalytic isoforms Tpk2 and Tpk3 localise with processing and stress bodies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we show that Tpk2 and Tpk3 are associated with translation initiation factors Pab1 and Rps3 in exponentially growing cells. Glucose starvation promotes the loss of interaction between Tpk and initiation factors followed by their accumulation into processing bodies. Analysis of mutants of the individual PKA isoform genes has revealed that the TPK3 or TPK2 deletion affects the capacity of the cells to form granules and arrest translation properly in response to glucose starvation or stationary phase. Moreover, we demonstrate that PKA controls Rpg1 and eIF4G(1) protein abundance, possibly controlling cap-dependent translation. Taken together, our data suggest that the PKA pathway coordinates multiple stages in the fate of mRNAs in association with nutritional environment and growth status of the cell.
Recently, mutations in eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G1 (EIF4G1) were reported as a rare cause of familial Parkinson's disease (PD). We screened the 33 exons of EIF4G1 by high-resolution melting curve analysis for variants in our Central European cohort of 376 PD cases. Variant frequency was assessed in a total of 975 PD cases and 1,014 general population controls. Eight novel nonsynonymous and four synonymous variants were identified. In our cohort, novel and previously identified nonsynonymous variants were very rare. Although it is possible that our general population controls also comprise individuals who have or could develop PD in the future, the presence of the original mutation (EIF4G1 p.Arg1205 His) in three controls only, raises questions about the causality of this variant with regard to PD.
Mutations in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4-gamma (EIF4G1) gene, encoding a component of the eIF4F translation initiation complex, were recently reported as a possible cause for the autosomal dominant form of Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we describe the screening of all 31 EIF4G1 coding exons in a series of 251 index cases with autosomal dominant PD, mostly of French origin and in 236 European control subjects. We identified 12 rare coding variants (either nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions or in frame deletions/insertions), including 6 variants present only in cases and 3 in controls. Segregation was possible only for 1 variant (p.E462delInsGK) that was found in 2 affected siblings. In addition, we found 2 previously reported pathogenic variants in 2 isolated patients (p.G686C) and in a control subject (p.R1197W). These data do not support the pathogenicity of several EIF4G1 variants in PD, at least in the French population.
Importin 13 (Imp13) is a bidirectional nuclear transporter of proteins involved in a range of important cellular processes, with an N-terminally truncated inhibitory isoform (tImp13) specifically expressed in testis. To gain insight into tImp13 function, we performed a yeast-2-hybrid screen from a human testis cDNA library, identifying for the first time a suite of interactors with roles in diverse cellular process. We validated the interaction of tImp13 with Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4Œ≥2 (EIF4G2) and High mobility group containing protein 20A (HMG20A), benchmarking that with glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a known Imp13 interactor expressed in testis. Coimmunoprecipitation assays indicated association of both tImp13 and Imp13 with EIF4G2, HMG20A and GR. Quantitative confocal microscopic analysis revealed the ability of tImp13 to inhibit the nuclear localisation of EIF4G2, HMG20A and GR, as well as that of Imp13 to act as a nuclear exporter for both EIF4G2 and HMG20A, and as a nuclear importer for GR. The physiological relevance of these results was highlighted by the cytoplasmic localisation of EIF4G2, HMG20A and GR in pachytene spermatocytes/round spermatids in the murine testis where tImp13 is present at high levels, in contrast to the nuclear localisation of HMG20A and GR in spermatogonia, where tImp13 is largely absent. Interestingly, Imp13, EIF4G2, HMG20A and GR were found together in the acrosome vesicle of murine epididymal spermatozoa. Collectively, our findings show, for the first time, that tImp13 may have a functional role in the mature spermatozoa, in addition to that in the meiotic germ cells of the testis.
Autophagy is modulated by multiple factors including CD147, but little is know about the effects and mechanism by which the modification of CD147 by Lewis y antigen regulates autophagy of ovarian cancer cell. Here, we reported that Lewis y antigen can promote basic autophagy activity and restrain autophagic cell death in ovarian cancer cells. Furthermore, human whole genome expression profile microarrays and massage pathway analysis revealed that during early stages of autophagy in ovarian cancer cells with highly expressing Lewis y antigen, PI3K/Akt-mTOR activity was reduced, in contrast, the PI3K/Akt-mTOR signaling pathway was activated as the length of amino acid deprivation increased, which inhibited eIF4G2 expression, further decreased the transcription of autophagy-related genes, suppressed autophagic cell death. we also elaborated that co-regulates protein degradation in cells via the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the autophagy-lysosome pathway. These findings suggested that the modification of CD147 by Lewis y antigen enhanced the survival ability by promoting basic autophagy activity and restraining autophagic cell death in ovarian cancer , thus playing an important role in ovarian cancer malignant progression.
Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway aberrations are common in human breast cancer. Furthermore, PIK3CA mutations are commonly associated with resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) or anti-estrogen receptor (ER) agents in HER2 or ER positive (HER2+/ER+) breast cancer. Hence, deciphering the underlying mechanisms of PIK3CA mutations in HER2+/ER+ breast cancer would provide novel insights into elucidating resistance to anti-HER2/ER therapies.
In this study, we systematically investigated the biological consequences of PIK3CA H1047R in HER2+/ER+ breast cancer by uniquely incorporating mRNA transcriptomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and proteomic data from reverse-phase protein arrays.
Our integrative bioinformatics analyses revealed that several important pathways such as STAT3 and VEGF/hypoxia were selectively altered by PIK3CA H1047R in HER2+/ER+ breast cancer. Protein differential expression analysis indicated that an elevated eIF4G might promote tumor angiogenesis and growth via regulation of the hypoxia-activated switch in HER2+ PIK3CA H1047R breast cancer. We observed hypo-phosphorylation of EGFR in HER2+ PIK3CA H1047R breast cancer versus HER2+PIK3CAwild-type (PIK3CA WT). In addition, ER and PIK3CA H1047R might cooperate to activate STAT3, MAPK, AKT, and Hippo pathways in ER+ PIK3CA H1047R breast cancer. A higher YAPpS127 level was observed in ER+ PIK3CA H1047R patients than that in an ER+ PIK3CA WT subgroup. By examining breast cancer cell lines having both microarray gene expression and drug treatment data from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer and the Stand Up to Cancer datasets, we found that the elevated YAP1 mRNA expression was associated with the resistance of BCL-2 family inhibitors, but with the sensitivity to MEK/MAPK inhibitors in breast cancer cells.
In summary, these findings shed light on the functional consequences of PIK3CA H1047R-driven breast tumorigenesis and resistance to the existing therapeutic agents in HER2+/ER+ breast cancer.
Eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) plays a central role in translation initiation through its interactions with the cap-binding protein eIF4E. This interaction is a major drug target for repressing translation and is naturally regulated by 4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs). 4E-BPs and eIF4G compete for binding to the eIF4E dorsal surface via a shared canonical 4E-binding motif, but also contain auxiliary eIF4E-binding sequences, which were assumed to contact non-overlapping eIF4E surfaces. However, it is unknown how metazoan eIF4G auxiliary sequences bind eIF4E. Here, we describe crystal structures of human and Drosophila melanogaster eIF4E-eIF4G complexes, which unexpectedly reveal that the eIF4G auxiliary sequences bind to the lateral surface of eIF4E, using a similar mode to that of 4E-BPs. Our studies provide a molecular model of the eIF4E-eIF4G complex, shed light on the competition mechanism of 4E-BPs, and enable the rational design of selective eIF4G inhibitors to dampen dysregulated translation in disease.
During placental implantation, cytotrophoblast cells differentiate to extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cells that invade from the placenta into the maternal uterine blood vessels. The heat shock protein-27 (HSP27), the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (EIF4E) are involved in regulating EVT cell differentiation/migration. EIF4E and EIF4G compose the translation initiation complex, which is a major control point in protein translation. The molecular chaperone distinctiveness of HSP27 implies that it directly interferes with many target proteins. STAT3, EIF4E, and EIF4G were found to be HSP27 client proteins in tumor cells. We aimed to analyze if HSP27 regulate STAT3 and EIF4G levels in first trimester human placenta. We found that like STAT3, EIF4G is highly expressed in the EVT cells (immunohistochemistry). Silencing HSP27 in HTR-8/SVneo cells (siRNA, EVT cell line) and in placental explants reduced STAT3 level (47 and 33¬†%, respectively, p¬†&lt;¬†0.05). HSP27 silencing reduced the levels of STAT3 phosphorylation (33¬†% reduction, p¬†&lt;¬†0.05) and targets (IRF1, MUC1, MMP2/9 and EIF4E, 30-49¬†% reduction, p¬†&lt;¬†0.05) in the HTR-8/SVneo cells. Moreover, HSP27 silencing significantly reduced EIF4G level and elevated the level of its fragments in HTR-8/SVneo cells and in the placental explants (p¬†&lt;¬†0.05). In conclusion, Placental implantation and development are accompanied by trophoblast cell proliferation and differentiation, which necessitates intense protein translation and STAT3 activation. HSP27 was found to be regulator of translation initiation and STAT3 level. Therefore, it suggests that HSP27 is a key protein during placental development and trophoblast cell differentiation.
Poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) is a major component of the messenger RNA-protein complex. PABP is able to bind the poly(A) tail of mRNA, as well as translation initiation factor 4G and eukaryotic release factor 3a (eRF3a). PABP has been found to stimulate translation initiation and to inhibit nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Using a reconstituted mammalian in vitro translation system, we show that PABP directly stimulates translation termination. PABP increases the efficiency of translation termination by recruitment of eRF3a and eRF1 to the ribosome. PABP's function in translation termination depends on its C-terminal domain and its interaction with the N-terminus of eRF3a. Interestingly, we discover that full-length eRF3a exerts a different mode of function compared to its truncated form eRF3c, which lacks the N-terminal domain. Pre-association of eRF3a, but not of eRF3c, with pre-termination complexes (preTCs) significantly increases the efficiency of peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis by eRF1. This implicates new, additional interactions of full-length eRF3a with the ribosomal preTC. Based on our findings, we suggest that PABP enhances the productive binding of the eRF1-eRF3 complex to the ribosome, via interactions with the N-terminal domain of eRF3a which itself has an active role in translation termination.
The majority of eukaryotic mRNAs are translated in a cap-dependent manner, which requires recognition of the mRNA 5' cap by eIF4E protein. Multiple eIF4E family members have been identified in most eukaryotic organisms. Drosophila melanogaster (Dm) has eight eIF4E related proteins; seven of them belong to Class I and one to Class II. Their biological roles with the exception of Dm eIF4E-1, Dm eIF4E-3 and Dm 4EHP, remain unknown. Here, we compare the molecular basis of Dm eIF4E's interactions with cap and eIF4G peptide by using homology modelling and fluorescence binding assays with various cap analogues. We found that despite the presence of conserved key residues responsible for cap recognition, the differences in binding different cap analogues among Class I Dm eIF4E isoforms are up to 14-fold. The highest affinity for cap analogues was observed for Dm eIF4E-3. We suggest that Dm eIF4E-3 and Dm eIF4E-5 bind the second nucleoside of the cap in an unusual manner via stacking interactions with a histidine or a phenylalanine residue, respectively. Moreover, the analysis of ternary complexes of eIF4G peptide-eIF4E-cap analogue showed cooperativity between eIF4G and cap binding only for Dm eIF4E-4, which exhibits the lowest affinity for cap analogues among all Dm eIF4Es.
The role of the bone marrow microenvironment in multiple myeloma pathogenesis and progression is well recognized. Indeed, we have shown that coculture of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells from normal donors and multiple myeloma cells comodulated translation initiation. Here, we characterized the timeline of mesenchymal stem cells conditioning by multiple myeloma cells, the persistence of this effect, and the consequences on cell phenotype. Normal donor mesenchymal stem cells were cocultured with multiple myeloma cell lines (U266, ARP1) (multiple myeloma-conditioned mesenchymal stem cells) (1.5 h,12 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 3 d) and were assayed for translation initiation status (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E; eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G; regulators: mechanistic target of rapamycin, MNK, 4EBP; targets: SMAD family 5, nuclear factor Œ∫B, cyclin D1, hypoxia inducible factor 1, c-Myc) (immunoblotting) and migration (scratch assay, inhibitors). Involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinases in mesenchymal stem cell conditioning and altered migration was also tested (immunoblotting, inhibitors). Multiple myeloma-conditioned mesenchymal stem cells were recultured alone (1-7 d) and were assayed for translation initiation (immunoblotting). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction of extracted ribonucleic acid was tested for microRNAs levels. Mitogen-activated protein kinases were activated within 1.5 h of coculture and were responsible for multiple myeloma-conditioned mesenchymal stem cell translation initiation status (an increase of &gt;200%, P &lt; 0.05) and elevated migration (16 h, an increase of &gt;400%, P &lt; 0.05). The bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells conditioned by multiple myeloma cells were reversible after only 1 d of multiple myeloma-conditioned mesenchymal stem cell culture alone. Decreased expression of microRNA-199b and microRNA-125a (an increase of &lt;140%, P &lt; 0.05) in multiple myeloma-conditioned mesenchymal stem cells supported elevated migration. The time- and proximity-dependent conditioning of normal donor mesenchymal stem cells in our model points to a dynamic interaction between multiple myeloma cells and the bone marrow niche, which causes profound changes in the nonmalignant bone marrow constituents. Future studies are warranted to identify clinically relevant means of blocking this crosstalk and improving multiple myeloma therapy.
Protein synthesis is a highly efficient process and is under exacting control. Yet, the actual abundance of translation factors present in translating complexes and how these abundances change during the transit of a ribosome across an mRNA remains unknown. Using analytical ultracentrifugation with fluorescent detection we have determined the stoichiometry of the closed-loop translation factors for translating ribosomes. A variety of pools of translating polysomes and monosomes were identified, each containing different abundances of the closed-loop factors eIF4E, eIF4G, and PAB1 and that of the translational repressor, SBP1. We establish that closed-loop factors eIF4E/eIF4G dissociated both as ribosomes transited polyadenylated mRNA from initiation to elongation and as translation changed from the polysomal to monosomal state prior to cessation of translation. eIF4G was found to particularly dissociate from polyadenylated mRNA as polysomes moved to the monosomal state, suggesting an active role for translational repressors in this process. Consistent with this suggestion, translating complexes generally did not simultaneously contain eIF4E/eIF4G and SBP1, implying mutual exclusivity in such complexes. For substantially deadenylated mRNA, however, a second type of closed-loop structure was identified that contained just eIF4E and eIF4G. More than one eIF4G molecule per polysome appeared to be present in these complexes, supporting the importance of eIF4G interactions with the mRNA independent of PAB1. These latter closed-loop structures, which were particularly stable in polysomes, may be playing specific roles in both normal and disease states for specific mRNA that are deadenylated and/or lacking PAB1. These analyses establish a dynamic snapshot of molecular abundance changes during ribosomal transit across an mRNA in what are likely to be critical targets of regulation. 
MicroRNAs predominantly decrease gene expression; however, specific mRNAs are translationally upregulated in quiescent (G0) mammalian cells and immature Xenopus laevis oocytes by an FXR1a-associated microRNA-protein complex (microRNP) that lacks the microRNP repressor, GW182. Their mechanism in these conditions of decreased mTOR signaling, and therefore reduced canonical (cap-and-poly(A)-tail-mediated) translation, remains undiscovered. Our data reveal that mTOR inhibition in human THP1 cells enables microRNA-mediated activation. Activation requires shortened/no poly(A)-tail targets; polyadenylated mRNAs are partially activated upon PAIP2 overexpression, which interferes with poly(A)-bound PABP, precluding PABP-enhanced microRNA-mediated inhibition and canonical translation. Consistently, inhibition of PARN deadenylase prevents activation. P97/DAP5, a homolog of canonical translation factor, eIF4G, which lacks PABP- and cap binding complex-interacting domains, is required for activation, and thereby for the oocyte immature state. P97 interacts with 3' UTR-binding FXR1a-associated microRNPs and with PARN, which binds mRNA 5' caps, forming a specialized complex to translate recruited mRNAs in these altered canonical translation conditions.
Cadicivirus (CDV) is unique amongst picornaviruses in having a dicistronic genome with internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESs) preceding both open reading frames. Here, we investigated initiation on the 5'-terminal IRES. We report that the 982-nt long 5'UTR comprises 12 domains (d1-d12), five of which (d8-d12, nts 341-950) constitute a divergent Type I IRES. It comprises central elements (the apex of d10, d11 and the following polypyrimidine tract) that are homologous to corresponding elements in canonical Type 1 IRESs, and non-canonical flanking domains (d8, d9 and d12). In vitro reconstitution revealed that as with canonical Type I IRESs, 48S complex formation requires eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) 1, 1A, 2, 3, 4A, 4B and 4G, and the poly(C) binding protein 2 (PCBP2), and starts with specific binding of eIF4G/eIF4A to d11. However, in contrast to canonical Type I IRESs, subsequent recruitment of 43S ribosomal complexes does not require direct interaction of their eIF3 constituent with the IRES-bound eIF4G. On the other hand, the CDV IRES forms a 40S/eIF3/IRES ternary complex, with multiple points of contact. These additional interactions with translational components could potentially stimulate recruitment of the 43S complex and alleviate the necessity for direct eIF4G/eIF3 interaction.
Enterovirus 71 (EV71), a member of Picornaviridae, is associated with severe central nervous system complications. In this study, we identified a cellular microRNA (miRNA), miR-197, whose expression was downregulated by viral infection in a time-dependent manner. In miR-197 mimic-transfected cells, EV71 replication was inhibited, whereas the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) activity was decreased in EV71 strains with or without predicted miR-197 target sites, indicating that miR-197 targets host proteins to modulate viral replication. We thus used a quantitative proteomics approach, aided by the TargetScan algorithm, to identify putative target genes of miR-197. Among them, RAN was selected and validated as a genuine target in a 3' untranslated region (UTR) reporter assay. Reduced production of RAN by RNA interference markedly reduced the synthesis of EV71-encoded viral proteins and virus titers. Furthermore, reintroduction of nondegradable RAN into these knockdown cells rescued viral protein synthesis. miR-197 levels were modulated by EV71 to maintain RAN mRNA translatability at late times postinfection since we demonstrated that cap-independent translation exerted by its intrinsic IRES activity was occurring at times when translation attenuation was induced by EV71. EV71-induced downregulation of miR-197 expression increased the expression of RAN, which supported the nuclear transport of the essential viral proteins 3D/3CD and host protein hnRNP K for viral replication. Our data suggest that downregulation of cellular miRNAs may constitute a newly identified mechanism that sustains the expression of host proteins to facilitate viral replication.
Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a picornavirus with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA that globally inhibits the cellular translational system, mainly by cleaving cellular eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) and poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), which inhibits the association of the ribosome with the host capped mRNA. We used a microRNA (miRNA) microarray chip to identify the host miRNA 197 (miR-197) that was downregulated by EV71. We also used quantitative mass spectrometry and a target site prediction tool to identify the miR-197 target genes. During viral infection, the expression of the target protein RAN was upregulated considerably, and there was a parallel downregulation of miR-197. The nuclear transport of viral 3D/3CD protein and of the host proteins involved in viral replication proceeded in an RAN-dependent manner. We have identified a new mechanism in picornavirus through which EV71-induced cellular miRNA downregulation can regulate host protein levels to facilitate viral replication.
The eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 4G is required during protein synthesis to promote the assembly of several factors involved in the recruitment of a 40S ribosomal subunit to an mRNA. Although many eukaryotes express two eIF4G isoforms that are highly similar, the eIF4G isoforms in plants, referred to as eIF4G and eIFiso4G, are highly divergent in size, sequence, and domain organization but both can interact with eIF4A, eIF4B, eIF4E isoforms, and the poly(A)-binding protein. Nevertheless, eIF4G and eIFiso4G from wheat exhibit preferences in the mRNAs they translate optimally. For example, mRNA containing the 5'-leader (called Œ©) of tobacco mosaic virus preferentially uses eIF4G in wheat germ lysate. In this study, the eIF4G isoform specificity of Œ© was used to examine functional differences of the eIF4G isoforms in Arabidopsis. As in wheat, Œ©-mediated translation was reduced in an eif4g null mutant. Loss of the eIFiso4G1 isoform, which is similar in sequence to wheat eIFiso4G, did not substantially affect Œ©-mediated translation. However, loss of the eIFiso4G2 isoform substantially reduced Œ©-mediated translation. eIFiso4G2 is substantially divergent from eIFiso4G1 and is present only in the Brassicaceae, suggesting a recent evolution. eIFiso4G2 isoforms exhibit sequence-specific differences in regions representing partner protein and RNA binding sites. Loss of any eIF4G isoform also resulted in a substantial reduction in reporter transcript level. These results suggest that eIFiso4G2 appeared late in plant evolution and exhibits more functional similarity with eIF4G than with eIFiso4G1 during Œ©-mediated translation. 
Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) leader protein (L(pro)) is a papain-like proteinase, which plays an important role in FMDV pathogenesis. L(pro) exists as two forms, Lab and Lb, due to translation being initiated from two different start codons separated by 84 nucleotides. L(pro) self-cleaves from the nascent viral polyprotein precursor as the first mature viral protein. In addition to its role as a viral proteinase, L(pro) also has the ability to antagonize host antiviral effects. To promote FMDV replication, L(pro) can suppress host antiviral responses by three different mechanisms: (1) cleavage of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 Œ≥ (eIF4G) to shut off host protein synthesis; (2) inhibition of host innate immune responses through restriction of interferon-Œ±/Œ≤ production; and (3) L(pro) can also act as a deubiquitinase and catalyze deubiquitination of innate immune signaling molecules. In the light of recent functional and biochemical findings regarding L(pro), this review introduces the basic properties of L(pro) and the mechanisms by which it antagonizes host antiviral responses. 
The eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) recognizes the mRNA cap structure and, together with eIF4G and eIF4A, form the eIF4F complex that regulates translation initiation in eukaryotes. In trypanosomatids, 2 eIF4E homologues (EIF4E3 and EIF4E4) have been shown to be part of eIF4F-like complexes with presumed roles in translation initiation. Both proteins possess unique N-terminal extensions, which can be targeted for phosphorylation. Here, we provide novel insights on the Leishmania infantum EIF4E4 function and regulation. We show that EIF4E4 is constitutively expressed throughout the parasite development but is preferentially phosphorylated in exponentially grown promastigote and amastigote life stages, hence correlating with high levels of translation. Phosphorylation targets multiple serine-proline or threonine-proline residues within the N-terminal extension of EIF4E4 but does not require binding to the EIF4E4's partner, EIF4G3, or to the cap structure. We also report that EIF4E4 interacts with PABP1 through 3 conserved boxes at the EIF4E4¬†N-terminus and that this interaction is a prerequisite for efficient EIF4E4 phosphorylation. EIF4E4 is essential for Leishmania growth and an EIF4E4 null mutant was only obtained in the presence of an ectopically provided wild type gene. Complementation for the loss of EIF4E4 with several EIF4E4 mutant proteins affecting either phosphorylation or binding to mRNA or to EIF4E4 protein partners revealed that, in contrast to other eukaryotes, only the EIF4E4-PABP1 interaction but neither the binding to EIF4G3 nor phosphorylation is essential for translation. These studies also demonstrated that the lack of both EIF4E4 phosphorylation and EIF4G3 binding leads to a non-functional protein. Altogether, these findings further highlight the unique features of the translation initiation process in trypanosomatid protozoa. 
The eIF4E-binding protein (4E-BP) is a phosphorylation-dependent regulator of protein synthesis. The nonphosphorylated or minimally phosphorylated form binds translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), preventing binding of eIF4G and the recruitment of the small ribosomal subunit. Signaling events stimulate serial phosphorylation of 4E-BP, primarily by mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) at residues T37/T46, followed by T70 and S65. Hyperphosphorylated 4E-BP dissociates from eIF4E, allowing eIF4E to interact with eIF4G and translation initiation to resume. Because overexpression of eIF4E is linked to cellular transformation, 4E-BP is a tumor suppressor, and up-regulation of its activity is a goal of interest for cancer therapy. A recently discovered small molecule, eIF4E/eIF4G interaction inhibitor 1 (4EGI-1), disrupts the eIF4E/eIF4G interaction and promotes binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E. Structures of 14- to 16-residue 4E-BP fragments bound to eIF4E contain the eIF4E consensus binding motif, (54)YXXXXLŒ¶(60) (motif 1) but lack known phosphorylation sites. We report here a 2.1-√Ö crystal structure of mouse eIF4E in complex with m(7)GTP and with a fragment of human 4E-BP1, extended C-terminally from the consensus-binding motif (4E-BP150-84). The extension, which includes a proline-turn-helix segment (motif 2) followed by a loop of irregular structure, reveals the location of two phosphorylation sites (S65 and T70). Our major finding is that the C-terminal extension (motif 3) is critical to 4E-BP1-mediated cell cycle arrest and that it partially overlaps with the binding site of 4EGI-1. The binding of 4E-BP1 and 4EGI-1 to eIF4E is therefore not mutually exclusive, and both ligands contribute to shift the equilibrium toward the inhibition of translation initiation. 
Wound healing is impaired in diabetes mellitus. The underlying mechanism involved in this process is still unknown. The Akt/mTOR signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of diabetes.
we investigated the role of the Akt/mTOR pathway in diabetic wounds and the mechanisms that growth factors activate this pathway to promote diabetic wound healing.
Full-thickness skin excisional wounds were created on the backs of normal and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. The expression of key proteins in the Akt/mTOR pathway was assayed using western blotting; topical effects of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) on diabetic wounds and activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway were subsequently investigated. Activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway by GM-SCF in vitro was examined in rat primary fibroblasts.
The results indicate that the Akt/mTOR pathway was activated in the wound tissue of both non-diabetic and diabetic rats, as indicated by a remarkable increase in expression of total and phosphorylated key proteins in this pathway. However, the expression level of these proteins was dramatically attenuated in diabetic wounds compared with non-diabetic wounds. Upon topical application of GM-CSF, the diabetic wound healing was remarkably improved concomitantly with increased expression and phosphorylation of key proteins in the Akt/mTOR pathway. In addition, rat fibroblast proliferation induced by GM-CSF depended on the Akt/mTOR pathway activation.
Impaired wound healing results from the dysfunction of the Akt/mTOR pathway in diabetic rats. The pharmacologic elevation of this pathway may represent an attractive intervention strategy to improve prognosis of diabetic wounds.
Through its interaction with the 5' translation initiation factor eIF4G, poly(A) binding protein (PABP) facilitates the translation of 5'-capped and 3'-poly(A)-tailed mRNAs. Rotavirus mRNAs are capped but not polyadenylated, instead terminating in a 3' GACC motif that is recognized by the viral protein NSP3, which competes with PABP for eIF4G binding. Upon rotavirus infection, viral, GACC-tailed mRNAs are efficiently translated, while host poly(A)-tailed mRNA translation is, in contrast, severely impaired. To explore the roles of NSP3 in these two opposing events, the translational capabilities of three capped mRNAs, distinguished by either a GACC, a poly(A), or a non-GACC and nonpoly(A) 3' end, have been monitored after electroporation of cells expressing all rotavirus proteins (infected cells) or only NSP3 (stably or transiently transfected cells). In infected cells, we found that the magnitudes of translation induction (GACC-tailed mRNA) and translation reduction [poly(A)-tailed mRNA] both depended on the rotavirus strain used but that translation reduction not genetically linked to NSP3. In transfected cells, even a small amount of NSP3 was sufficient to dramatically enhance GACC-tailed mRNA translation and, surprisingly, to slightly favor the translation of both poly(A)- and nonpoly(A)-tailed mRNAs, likely by stabilizing the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction. These data suggest that NSP3 is a translational surrogate of the PABP-poly(A) complex; therefore, it cannot by itself be responsible for inhibiting the translation of host poly(A)-tailed mRNAs upon rotavirus infection.
To control host cell physiology and to circumvent innate immunity, many viruses have evolved powerful mechanisms aimed at inhibiting host mRNA translation while stimulating translation of their own mRNAs. How rotavirus tackles this challenge is still a matter of debate. Using rotavirus-infected cells, we show that the magnitude of cellular poly(A) mRNA translation differs with respect to rotavirus strains but is not genetically linked to NSP3. Using cells expressing rotavirus NSP3, we show that NSP3 alone not only dramatically enhances rotavirus-like mRNA translation but also enhances poly(A) mRNA translation rather than inhibiting it, likely by stabilizing the eIF4E-eIF4G complex. Thus, the inhibition of cellular polyadenylated mRNA translation during rotavirus infection cannot be attributed solely to NSP3 and is more likely the result of global competition between viral and host mRNAs for the cellular translation machinery.
Translation initiation factor eIF4E mediates mRNA selection for protein synthesis via the mRNA 5'cap. A family of binding proteins, termed the 4E-BPs, interact with eIF4E to hinder ribosome recruitment. Mechanisms underlying mRNA specificity for 4E-BP control remain poorly understood. Saccharomyces cerevisiae 4E-BPs, Caf20p and Eap1p, each regulate an overlapping set of mRNAs. We undertook global approaches to identify protein and RNA partners of both 4E-BPs by immunoprecipitation of tagged proteins combined with mass spectrometry or next-generation sequencing. Unexpectedly, mass spectrometry indicated that the 4E-BPs associate with many ribosomal proteins. 80S ribosome and polysome association was independently confirmed and was not dependent upon interaction with eIF4E, as mutated forms of both Caf20p and Eap1p with disrupted eIF4E-binding motifs retain ribosome interaction. Whole-cell proteomics revealed Caf20p mutations cause both up and down-regulation of proteins and that many changes were independent of the 4E-binding motif. Investigations into Caf20p mRNA targets by immunoprecipitation followed by RNA sequencing revealed a strong association between Caf20p and mRNAs involved in transcription and cell cycle processes, consistent with observed cell cycle phenotypes of mutant strains. A core set of over 500 Caf20p-interacting mRNAs comprised of both eIF4E-dependent (75%) and eIF4E-independent targets (25%), which differ in sequence attributes. eIF4E-independent mRNAs share a 3' UTR motif. Caf20p binds all tested motif-containing 3' UTRs. Caf20p and the 3'UTR combine to influence ERS1 mRNA polysome association consistent with Caf20p contributing to translational control. Finally ERS1 3'UTR confers Caf20-dependent repression of expression to a heterologous reporter gene. Taken together, these data reveal conserved features of eIF4E-dependent Caf20p mRNA targets and uncover a novel eIF4E-independent mode of Caf20p binding to mRNAs that extends the regulatory role of Caf20p in the mRNA-specific repression of protein synthesis beyond its interaction with eIF4E. 
In eukaryotes, post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression has a key role in many cellular and developmental processes. Spermatogenesis involves a complex developmental program that includes changes in cell cycle dynamics and dramatic cellular remodeling. Translational control is critical for spermatogenesis in Drosophila as many mRNAs synthesized in the spermatocytes are translated only much later during spermatid differentiation. Testes-specific translation initiation factors eIF4E-3 and eIF4G2 are essential specifically for male fertility. However, details of their roles during different stages of spermatogenesis are unknown, and the role of canonical translation initiation factors in spermatogenesis remains unexplored. In this study, we addressed the functional role of eIF4E-1, eIF4E-3, eIF4G and eIF4G2 in testes development and formation of mature sperm. Using the UAS-Gal4 system and RNA interference, we systematically knocked down these four genes in different stages of germ cell development, and in the somatic cells. Our results show that eIF4E-1 function in early germ cells and the surrounding somatic cells is critical for spermatogenesis. Both eIF4E-1 and eIF4E-3 are required in spermatocytes for chromosome condensation and cytokinesis during the meiotic stages. Interestingly, we find that eIF4G knockdown did not affect male fertility while eIF4G2 has distinct functions during spermatogenesis; it is required in early germ cells for proper meiotic divisions and spermatid elongation while its abrogation in spermatocytes caused meiotic arrest. Double knockdown of eIF4G and eIF4G2 shows that these proteins act redundantly during the early stages of spermatogenesis. Taken together, our analysis reveals spatio-temporal roles of the canonical and testes-specific translation initiation factors in coordinating developmental programs during spermatogenesis. 
Deregulated mRNA translation has been implicated in disease development and in part is controlled by a eukaryotic initiation complex eIF4F (composed of eIF4E, eIF4G and eIF4A). We demonstrate here that the cap bound fraction from lymphoma cells was enriched with eIF4G and eIF4E indicating that lymphoma cells exist in an activated translational state. Moreover, 77% (110/142) of diffuse large B cell lymphoma tumors expressed eIF4E and this was associated with an inferior event free survival. Over-expression of wild-type eIF4E (eIF4E(WT)) but not cap-mutant eIF4E (eIF4E(cap mutant)) increased the activation of the eIF4F complex. Treatment with the active-site dual mTOR inhibitor CC214-1 reduced the level of the eIF4F complex by decreasing the cap bound fraction of eIF4G and increasing the levels of 4E-BP1. CC214-1 inhibited both the cap dependent and global protein translation. CC214-1 inhibited c-Myc, and cyclin D3 translation by decreasing polysomal fractions from lymphoma cells. Inhibition of eIF4E with shRNA further decreased the CC214-1 induced inhibition of the eIF4F complex, c-Myc, cyclin D3 translation, and colony formation. These studies demonstrate that the eIF4F complex is deregulated in aggressive lymphoma and that dual mTOR therapy has therapeutic potential in these patients.
In higher eukaryotes, eIF4A, eIF4E and eIF4G homologues interact to enable mRNA recruitment to the ribosome. eIF4G acts as a scaffold for these interactions and also interacts with other proteins of the translational machinery. Trypanosomatid protozoa have multiple homologues of eIF4E and eIF4G and the precise function of each remains unclear. Here, 2 previously described eIF4G homologues, EIF4G3 and EIF4G4, were further investigated. In vitro, both homologues bound EIF4AI, but with different interaction properties. Binding to distinct eIF4Es was also confirmed; EIF4G3 bound EIF4E4 while EIF4G4 bound EIF4E3, both these interactions required similar binding motifs. EIF4G3, but not EIF4G4, interacted with PABP1, a poly-A binding protein homolog. Work in vivo with Trypanosoma brucei showed that both EIF4G3 and EIF4G4 are cytoplasmic and essential for viability. Depletion of EIF4G3 caused a rapid reduction in total translation while EIF4G4 depletion led to changes in morphology but no substantial inhibition of translation. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to disrupt interactions of the eIF4Gs with either eIF4E or eIF4A, causing different levels of growth inhibition. Overall the results show that only EIF4G3, with its cap binding partner EIF4E4, plays a major role in translational initiation. 
The mRNA closed-loop, formed through interactions between the cap structure, poly(A) tail, eIF4E, eIF4G and PAB, features centrally in models of eukaryotic translation initiation, although direct support for its existence in vivo is not well established. Here, we investigated the closed-loop using a combination of mRNP isolation from rapidly cross-linked cells and high-throughput qPCR. Using the interaction between these factors and the opposing ends of mRNAs as a proxy for the closed-loop, we provide evidence that it is prevalent for eIF4E/4G-bound but unexpectedly sparse for PAB1-bound mRNAs, suggesting it primarily occurs during a distinct phase of polysome assembly. We observed mRNA-specific variation in the extent of closed-loop formation, consistent with a role for polysome topology in the control of gene expression. 
FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD are the most frequent tyrosine kinase mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), with the former associated with poor prognosis. Here, we show that the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 or the Akt inhibitor MK-2206 induced apoptosis through the mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway more efficiently in hematopoietic 32D cells driven by FLT3-TKD (32D/TKD) than FLT3-ITD (32D/ITD), which robustly activated STAT5. The resistance to GDC-0941 and MK-2206 was gained by expression of the constitutively activated STAT5 mutant STAT5A1*6 in 32D/TKD cells, while it was abrogated by the STAT5 inhibitor pimozide in 32D/ITD cells or FLT3-ITD-expressing human leukemic MV4-11 cells. GDC-0941 or MK-2206 induced dephosphorylation of 4EBP1 more conspicuously in 32D/TKD than in 32D/ITD, which was prevented or augmented by STAT5A1*6 or pimozide, respectively, and correlated with downregulation of the eIF4E/eIF4G complex formation and Mcl-1 expression. Furthermore, exogenous expression of Mcl-1 endowed resistance to GDC-0941 and MK-2206 on 32D/TKD cells. Finally, it was confirmed in primary AML cells with FLT3-ITD that pimozide enhanced 4EBP1 dephosphorylation and Mcl-1 downregulation to augment cytotoxicity of GDC-0941. These data suggest that the robust STAT5 activation by FLT3-ITD protects cells treated with the PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitors from apoptosis by maintaining Mcl-1 expression through the mTORC1/4EBP1/eIF4E pathway. 
Enterovirus 71 (EV-A71) is a human pathogen that causes hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) and fatal neurological diseases, and no effective treatment is available. Characterization of key host factors is important for understanding its pathogenesis and developing antiviral drugs. Here we report that Hsp27 is one of the most upregulated proteins in response to EV-A71 infection, as revealed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis-based proteomics studies. Depletion of Hsp27 by small interfering RNA or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout significantly inhibited viral replication, protein expression, and reproduction, while restoration of Hsp27 restored such virus activities. Furthermore, we show that Hsp27 plays a crucial role in regulating viral internal ribosome entry site (IRES) activities by two different mechanisms. Hsp27 markedly promoted 2Apro-mediated eukaryotic initiation factor 4G cleavage, an important process for selecting and initiating IRES-mediated translation. hnRNP A1 is a key IRES trans-acting factor (ITAF) for enhancing IRES-mediated translation. Surprisingly, knockout of Hsp27 differentially blocked hnRNP A1 but not FBP1 translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and therefore abolished the hnRNP A1 interaction with IRES. Most importantly, the Hsp27 inhibitor 1,3,5-trihydroxy-13,13-dimethyl-2H-pyran [7,6-b] xanthone (TDP), a compound isolated from a traditional Chinese herb, significantly protected against cytopathic effects and inhibited EV-A71 infection. Collectively, our results demonstrate new functions of Hsp27 in facilitating virus infection and provide novel options for combating EV-A71 infection by targeting Hsp27.IMPORTANCE Outbreaks of infections with EV-A71, which causes hand, foot, and mouth disease, severe neurological disorders, and even death, have been repeatedly reported worldwide in recent decades and are a great public health problem for which no approved treatments are available. We show that Hsp27, a heat shock protein, supports EV-A71 infection in two distinct ways to promote viral IRES-dependent translation. A small-molecule Hsp27 inhibitor isolated from a traditional Chinese medicinal herb effectively reduces virus yields. Together, our findings demonstrate that Hsp27 plays an important role in EV-A71 infection and may serve as an antiviral target.
The insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) mediates the biological actions of both IGF1 and IGF2. In recent years, evidence has accumulated showing that, in addition to its classical cell-surface distribution, IGF1R translocates to cell nucleus via an apparently SUMO-1-dependent mechanism. While the role of IGF1R in nucleus has not yet been settled, available information suggests that the nuclear receptor displays activities usually linked to transcription factors, including DNA binding and transcription regulation. To gain insight into the biological pathways associated with nuclear IGF1R action we conducted a mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis aimed at identifying interactors of IGF1R in nucleus of both benign and malignant breast cells. The nucleolar NOM1 molecule belongs to a family of proteins that contain the middle domain of eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (MIF4G) and/or interaction module (MA3), and functions in translation, cell growth and proliferation. Using a combination of co-immunoprecipitation and silencing assays we provide evidence of a complex, bi-directional interplay between nuclear IGF1R and nucleolar protein NOM1. Inhibition of nuclear IGF1R translocation by dansylcadaverine reduced NOM1 levels in nuclei of MCF7 cells. On the other hand, IGF1R overexpression enhanced NOM1 levels in the nuclear fraction. Of interest, NOM1 silencing led to a major increase in IGF1R biosynthesis. In summary, results are consistent with a physiologically-relevant interplay between the nuclear IGF1 signaling pathway and nucleolar protein NOM1.
In the present study, we investigated the roles of interactions among the poly(A) tail, coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein, and poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) in the regulation of coronavirus gene expression. Through dissociation constant (Kd ) comparison, we found that the coronavirus N protein can bind to the poly(A) tail with high affinity, establishing N protein as a PABP. A subsequent analysis with UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation revealed that the N protein is able to bind to the poly(A) tail in infected cells. Further examination demonstrated that poly(A) tail binding by the N protein negatively regulates translation of coronaviral RNA and host mRNA both in vitro and in cells. Although the N protein can interact with PABP and eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G), the poor interaction efficiency between the poly(A)-bound N protein and eIF4E may explain the observed decreased translation efficiency. In addition to interaction with translation factor eIF4G, the N protein is able to interact with coronavirus nonstructural protein 9 (nsp9), a replicase protein required for replication. The study demonstrates interactions among the poly(A) tail, N protein, and PABP both in vitro and in infected cells. Of the interactions, binding of the poly(A) tail to N protein decreases the interaction efficiency between the poly(A) tail and eIF4E, leading to translation inhibition. The poly(A)-dependent translation inhibition by N protein has not been previously demonstrated and thus extends our understanding of coronavirus gene expression.IMPORTANCE Gene expression in coronavirus is a complicated and dynamic process. In this study, we demonstrated that coronavirus N protein is able to bind to the poly(A) tail with high affinity, establishing N protein as a PABP. We also show how the interplay between coronavirus 3' poly(A) tail, PABP, and N protein regulates gene expression of the coronavirus and host cell. Of the interactions, poly(A) tail binding by the N protein negatively regulates translation, and to our knowledge, this inhibition of translation by binding of the N protein to poly(A) tail has not been previously studied. Accordingly, the study provides fundamental molecular details regarding coronavirus infection and expands our knowledge of coronavirus gene expression.
Recruitment of poliovirus (PV) RNA to the human ribosome requires the coordinated interaction of the viral internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and several host cellular initiation factors and IRES trans-acting factors (ITAFs). Attenuated PV Sabin strains contain point mutations in the PV IRES domain V (dV) that inhibit viral translation. Remarkably, attenuation is most apparent in cells of the central nervous system, but the molecular basis to explain this is poorly understood. The dV contains binding sites for eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) and polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB). Impaired binding of these proteins to the mutant IRESs has been observed, but these effects have not been quantitated. We used a fluorescence anisotropy assay to reveal that the Sabin mutants reduce the equilibrium dissociation constants of eIF4G and PTB to the PV IRES by up to 6-fold. Using the most inhibitory Sabin 3 mutant, we used a real-time fluorescence helicase assay to show that the apparent affinity of an active eIF4G/4A/4B helicase complex for the IRES is reduced by 2.5-fold. The Sabin 3 mutant did not alter the maximum rate of eIF4A-dependent helicase activity, suggesting that this mutant primarily reduces the affinity, rather than activity, of the unwinding complex. To confirm this affinity model of attenuation, we show that eIF4G overexpression in HeLa cells overcomes the attenuation of a Sabin 3 mutant PV-luciferase replicon. Our study provides a quantitative framework for understanding the mechanism of PV Sabin attenuation and provides an explanation for the previously observed cell type-specific translational attenuation.
Translation initiation of most mammalian mRNAs is mediated by a 5' cap structure that binds eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). However, inactivation of eIF4E does not impair translation of many capped mRNAs, suggesting an unknown alternate mechanism may exist for cap-dependent but eIF4E-independent translation. We show that DAP5, an eIF4GI homolog that lacks eIF4E binding, utilizes eIF3d to facilitate cap-dependent translation of approximately 20% of mRNAs. Genome-wide transcriptomic and translatomic analyses indicate that DAP5 is required for translation of many transcription factors and receptor capped mRNAs and their mRNA targets involved in cell survival, motility, DNA repair and translation initiation, among other mRNAs. Mass spectrometry and crosslinking studies demonstrate that eIF3d is a direct binding partner of DAP5. In vitro translation and ribosome complex studies demonstrate that DAP5 and eIF3d are both essential for eIF4E-independent capped-mRNA translation. These studies disclose a widespread and previously unknown mechanism for cap-dependent mRNA translation by DAP5-eIF3d complexes.
This study is to investigate whether the known mutations P.R1205H and P.A502V were pathogenic factors of Parkinson disease (PD) in Xinjiang Uygur and Han people.A case-control study with polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method was performed on 150 cases of PD and 130 cases of age, sex, and national-matched healthy controls for rs200221361 polymorphism analysis and Sanger sequencing. Specific mutations were chosen for further sequencing in a case-control study.The 3 variants located on the exon 10, and the rs200221361 was a nonsynonymous variant. The frequencies of rs200221361 genotype and allele between PD and control groups in Uygur and Han people showed no significant difference (for genotype, œá‚Ää=‚Ää0.91, P‚Ää&gt;‚Ää.05; for allele, œá‚Ää=‚Ää0.91, P‚Ää&gt;‚Ää.05). Statistical analysis showed that there were no differences in allele and genotype frequencies of rs200221361 genotype and allele between PD and control groups among the age, gender, or race (P‚Ää&gt;‚Ää.05).P.Ala502Val and P.Arg1205H may not be pathogenic mutations to PD in Xinjiang Uygur and Han people. The polymorphism of the rs200221361 may have no association with the occurrence of PD in Uygur and Han people of Xinjiang.
eIF4A is a DEAD-box RNA-dependent ATPase thought to unwind RNA secondary structure in the 5'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs to promote their recruitment to the eukaryotic translation pre-initiation complex (PIC). We show that eIF4A's ATPase activity is markedly stimulated in the presence of the PIC, independently of eIF4E‚Ä¢eIF4G, but dependent on subunits i and g of the heteromeric eIF3 complex. Surprisingly, eIF4A accelerated the rate of recruitment of all mRNAs tested, regardless of their degree of structural complexity. Structures in the 5'-UTR and 3' of the start codon synergistically inhibit mRNA recruitment in a manner relieved by eIF4A, indicating that the factor does not act solely to melt hairpins in 5'-UTRs. Our findings that eIF4A functionally interacts with the PIC and plays important roles beyond unwinding 5'-UTR structure is consistent with a recent proposal that eIF4A modulates the conformation of the 40S ribosomal subunit to promote mRNA recruitment.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) expresses several mRNAs produced from intronless genes that could potentially be unfavorably translated compared to cellular spliced mRNAs. To overcome this situation, the virus encodes an RNA-binding protein (RBP) called EB2, which was previously found to both facilitate the export of nuclear mRNAs and increase their translational yield. Here, we show that EB2 binds both nuclear and cytoplasmic cap-binding complexes (CBC and eukaryotic initiation factor 4F [eIF4F], respectively) as well as the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) to enhance translation initiation of a given messenger ribonucleoparticle (mRNP). Interestingly, such an effect can be obtained only if EB2 is initially bound to the native mRNPs in the nucleus. We also demonstrate that the EB2-eIF4F-PABP association renders translation of these mRNPs less sensitive to translation initiation inhibitors. Taken together, our data suggest that EB2 binds and stabilizes cap-binding complexes in order to increase mRNP translation and furthermore demonstrate the importance of the mRNP assembly process in the nucleus to promote protein synthesis in the cytoplasm.IMPORTANCE Most herpesvirus early and late genes are devoid of introns. However, it is now well documented that mRNA splicing facilitates recruitment on the mRNAs of cellular factors involved in nuclear mRNA export and translation efficiency. To overcome the absence of splicing of herpesvirus mRNAs, a viral protein, EB2 in the case of Epstein-Barr virus, is produced to facilitate the cytoplasmic accumulation of viral mRNAs. Although we previously showed that EB2 also specifically enhances translation of its target mRNAs, the mechanism was unknown. Here, we show that EB2 first is recruited to the mRNA cap structure in the nucleus and then interacts with the proteins eIF4G and PABP to enhance the initiation step of translation.
To investigate whether transcription of hepatitis B virus (HBV) gene occurs in human sperm, total RNA was extracted from sperm of patients with chronic HBV infection (test-1), from donor sperm transfected with a plasmid containing the full-length HBV genome (test-2), and from nontransfected donor sperm (control), used as the template for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Positive bands for HBV DNA were observed in the test groups but not in the control. Next, to identify the role of host genes in regulating viral gene transcription in sperm, total RNA was extracted from 2-cell embryos derived from hamster oocytes fertilized in vitro by HBV-transfected (test) or nontransfected (control) human sperm and successively subjected to SMART-PCR, suppression subtractive hybridization, T/A cloning, bacterial amplification, microarray hybridization, sequencing and the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) search to isolate differentially expressed genes. Twenty-nine sequences showing significant identity to five human gene families were identified, with chorionic somatomammotropin hormone 2 (CSH2), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma 2 (EIF4G2), pterin-4 alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase 2 (PCBD2), pregnancy-specific beta-1-glycoprotein 4 (PSG4) and titin (TTN) selected to represent target genes. Using real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), when CSH2 and PCBD2 (or EIF4G2, PSG4 and TTN) were silenced by RNA interference, transcriptional levels of HBV s and x genes significantly decreased (or increased) (P &lt; 0.05). Silencing of a control gene in sperm did not significantly change transcription of HBV s and x genes (P &gt; 0.05). This study provides the first experimental evidence that transcription of HBV genes occurs in human sperm and is regulated by host genes.
Several families of plant viruses evolved cap-independent translation enhancers (3'CITE) in the 3' untranslated regions of their genomic (g)RNAs to compete with ongoing cap-dependent translation of cellular mRNAs. Umbravirus Pea enation mosaic virus (PEMV)2 is the only example where three 3'CITEs enhance translation: the eIF4E-binding Panicum mosaic virus-like translational enhancer (PTE) and ribosome-binding 3' T-shaped structure (TSS) have been found in viruses of different genera, while the ribosome-binding kl-TSS that provides a long-distance interaction with the 5' end is unique. We report that the PTE is the key translation promoting element, but inhibits translation in cis and in trans in the absence of the kl-TSS by sequestering initiation factor eIF4G. PEMV2 strongly outcompeted a cellular mRNA mimic for translation, indicating that the combination of kl-TSS and PTE is highly efficient. Transferring the 3'-5' interaction from the kl-TSS to the PTE (to fulfill its functionality as found in other viruses) supported translationin vitro, but gRNA did not accumulate to detectable levels in protoplasts in the absence of the kl-TSS. It was shown that the PTE in conjunction with the kl-TSS did not markedly affect the translation initiation rate but rather increased the number of gRNAs available for translation. A model is proposed to explain how 3'CITE-based regulation of ribosome recruitment enhances virus fitness.
In enteroviruses, the inhibition of protein synthesis from capped host cell mRNA is catalyzed by the virally encoded 2A proteinase (2Apro), which cleaves eukaryotic initiation factors (eIF) 4GI and 4GII. Despite much investigation, the exact mechanism of 2Apro cleavage remains however unclear. Here, we identify the domains responsible for the eIF4E/HRV2 2Apro interaction using molecular modelling and describe mutations that impair this interaction and delay in vitro cleavage of eIF4G isoforms. Furthermore, we produced HRV1A viruses bearing the mutation L17R, Y32A or Y86A in the 2Apro sequence. All three viruses showed reduced yield and were appreciably delayed during infection in eIF4GI cleavage. Thus, we propose for genetic group A HRVs that the eIF4E/2Apro interaction is essential for successful viral replication. In contrast, HRV4 2Apro and coxsackievirus B4 2Apro failed to form complexes with eIF4E, suggesting that the mechanism of eIF4G isoform cleavage in these and related viruses is different.
Species A rotavirus non-structural protein 3 (NSP3) is a translational regulator that inhibits or, under some conditions, enhances host cell translation. NSP3 binds to the translation initiation factor eIF4G1 and evicts poly-(A) binding protein (PABP) from eIF4G1, thus inhibiting translation of polyadenylated mRNAs, presumably by disrupting the effect of PABP bound to their 3'-ends. NSP3 has a long coiled-coil region involved in dimerization that includes a chaperone Hsp90-binding domain (HS90BD). We aimed to study the role in NSP3 dimerization of a segment of the coiled-coil region adjoining the HS90BD. We used a vaccinia virus system to express NSP3 with point mutations in conserved amino acids in the coiled-coil region and determined the effects of these mutations on translation by metabolic labeling of proteins as well as on accumulation of stable NSP3 dimers by non-dissociating Western blot, a method that separates stable NSP3 dimers from the monomer/dimerization intermediate forms of the protein. Four of five mutations reduced the total yield of NSP3 and the formation of stable dimers (W170A, K171E, R173E and R187E:K191E), whereas one mutation had the opposite effects (Y192A). Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 revealed that stable NSP3 dimers and monomers/dimerization intermediates are susceptible to proteasome degradation. Surprisingly, mutants severely impaired in the formation of stable dimers were still able to inhibit host cell translation, suggesting that NSP3 dimerization intermediates are functional. Our results demonstrate that rotavirus NSP3 acquires its function prior to stable dimer formation and remain as a proteasome target throughout dimerization.
Overexpression of adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) transport protein is emerging as a critical contributor to anticancer drug resistance. The eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 4F complex, the key modulator of mRNA translation, is regulated by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin pathway in anticancer drug-resistant tumors. The present study demonstrated the roles of ABC translation protein alterations in the acquisition of the Adriamycin (ADM)-resistant phenotype of MCF-7 human breast cells. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis were applied to examine the differences in mRNA and protein levels, respectively. It was found that the expression of the ABC sub-family B member 1, ABC sub-family C member 1 and ABC sub-family G member 2 transport proteins were upregulated in MCF-7/ADR cells. An MTT assay was used to detect the cell viability, from the results MCF-7/ADR cells were less sensitive to ADM, tamoxifen (TAM) and taxol (TAX) treatment compared with MCF-7 cells. We predicted that the 3'-untranslated region of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4-Œ≥ 1 (eIF4G) contains a potential miRNA binding site for microRNA (miR)-503 through using computational programs. These binding sites were confirmed by luciferase reporter assays. eIF4G mRNA degradation was accelerated in cells transfected with miR-503 mimics. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that eIF4G and ABC translation proteins were significantly downregulated in MCF-7/ADR cells after transfection with miR-503. It was found that miR-503 mimics could sensitize the cells to treatment with ADM, TAM and TAX. These findings demonstrated for the first time that eIF4G acted as a key factor in MCF-7/ADR cells, and may be an efficient agent for preventing and reversing multi-drug resistance in breast cancer.
The association-dissociation of the cap-binding protein eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) with eIF4G is a key control step in eukaryotic translation. The paradigm on the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction states that eIF4G binds to the dorsal surface of eIF4E through a single canonical alpha-helical motif, while metazoan eIF4E-binding proteins (m4E-BPs) advantageously compete against eIF4G via bimodal interactions involving this canonical motif and a second noncanonical motif of the eIF4E surface. Metazoan eIF4Gs share this extended binding interface with m4E-BPs, with significant implications on the understanding of translation regulation and the design of therapeutic molecules. Here we show the high-resolution structure of melon (Cucumis melo) eIF4E in complex with a melon eIF4G peptide and propose the first eIF4E-eIF4G structural model for plants. Our structural data together with functional analyses demonstrate that plant eIF4G binds to eIF4E through both the canonical and noncanonical motifs, similarly to metazoan eIF4E-eIF4G complexes. As in the case of metazoan eIF4E-eIF4G, this may have very important practical implications, as plant eIF4E-eIF4G is also involved in a significant number of plant diseases. In light of our results, a universal eukaryotic bipartite mode of binding to eIF4E is proposed.
Mammarenaviruses are enveloped viruses with a bisegmented negative-stranded RNA genome that encodes the nucleocapsid protein (NP), the envelope glycoprotein precursor (GPC), the RNA polymerase (L), and a RING matrix protein (Z). Viral proteins are synthesized from subgenomic mRNAs bearing a capped 5' untranslated region (UTR) and lacking 3' poly(A) tail. We analyzed the translation strategy of Tacaribe virus (TCRV), a prototype of the New World mammarenaviruses. A virus-like transcript that carries a reporter gene in place of the NP open reading frame and transcripts bearing modified 5' and/or 3' UTR were evaluated in a cell-based translation assay. We found that the presence of the cap structure at the 5' end dramatically increases translation efficiency and that the viral 5' UTR comprises stimulatory signals while the 3' UTR,specifically the presence of a terminal C+G-rich sequence and/or a stem-loop structure, down-modulates translation. Additionally, translation was profoundly reduced in eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4G-inactivated cells, whereas depletion of intracellular levels of eIF4E had less impact on virus-like mRNA translation than on a cell-like transcript. Translation efficiency was independent of NP expression or TCRV infection. Our results indicate that TCRV mRNAs are translated using a cap-dependent mechanism, whose efficiency relies on the interplay between stimulatory signals in the 5' UTR and a negative modulatory element in the 3' UTR. The low dependence on eIF4E suggests that viral mRNAs may engage yet-unknown noncanonical host factors for a cap-dependent initiation mechanism.IMPORTANCE Several members of the Arenaviridae family cause serious hemorrhagic fevers in humans. In the present report, we describe the mechanism by which Tacaribe virus, a prototypic nonpathogenic New World mammarenavirus, regulates viral mRNA translation. Our results highlight the impact of untranslated sequences and key host translation factors on this process. We propose a model that explains how viral mRNAs outcompete cellular mRNAs for the translation machinery. A better understanding of the mechanism of translation regulation of this virus can provide the bases for the rational design of new antiviral tools directed to pathogenic arenaviruses.
Osteosarcoma (OS) is an aggressive malignant mesenchymal neoplasm amongst adolescents. The aim of the present study was to explore the various modes of action that miR-379 has on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of human OS cells. miR-379 achieves this by targetting eukaryotic initiation factor 4GII (EIF4G2). Human OS cell lines U2OS and MG-63 were selected and assigned into blank, miR-379 mimics, miR-379 mimic negative control (NC), miR-379 inhibitors, miR-379 inhibitor NC, EIF4G2 shRNA, control shRNA, and miR-379 inhibitor + EIF4G2 shRNA group. The miR-379 expression and EIF4G2 mRNA expression were detected utilising quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and the EIF4G2 protein expression using Western blotting. MTT assay, scratch test, Transwell assay, and flow cytometry were performed to determine the proliferation, migration, invasion, and cell cycle, respectively. In comparison with the miR-379 mimic NC group, the miR-379 mimics group had decreased EIF4G2 expression; the miR-379 inhibitors group indicated an increased EIF4G2 expression. Compared with the control shRNA group, the EIF4G2 expression was lower in the EIF4G2 shRNA group and the miR-379 expression was dropped in the miR-379 inhibitor + EIF4G2 shRNA group. The proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities of OS cells were reduced in the miR-379 mimics and EIF4G2 shRNA groups. The percentage of OS cells at the G0/G1 stage was increased, and the percentage at the S-stage was decreased in the miR-379 mimics and EIF4G2 shRNA groups. miR-379 may inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion of OS cells through the down-regulation of EIF4G2.
Eukaryotic gene expression is precisely regulated at all points between transcription and translation. In this review, we focus on translational control mediated by the 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs. mRNA 3'-UTRs contain cis-acting elements that function in the regulation of protein translation or mRNA decay. Each RNA binding protein that binds to these cis-acting elements regulates mRNA translation via various mechanisms targeting the mRNA cap structure, the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-eIF4G complex, ribosomes, and the poly (A) tail. We also discuss translation-mediated regulation of mRNA fate. [BMB Reports 2017; 50(4): 194-200].
Extensive pre-mRNA back-splicing generates numerous circular RNAs (circRNAs) in human transcriptome. However, the biological functions of these circRNAs remain largely unclear. Here we report that N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant base modification of RNA, promotes efficient initiation of protein translation from circRNAs in human cells. We discover that consensus m6A motifs are enriched in circRNAs and a single m6A site is sufficient to drive translation initiation. This m6A-driven translation requires initiation factor eIF4G2 and m6A reader YTHDF3, and is enhanced by methyltransferase METTL3/14, inhibited by demethylase FTO, and upregulated upon heat shock. Further analyses through polysome profiling, computational prediction and mass spectrometry reveal that m6A-driven translation of circRNAs is widespread, with hundreds of endogenous circRNAs having translation potential. Our study expands the coding landscape of human transcriptome, and suggests a role of circRNA-derived proteins in cellular responses to environmental stress.
Fatty acid biosynthesis is a primary metabolic pathway that occurs in plastids, whereas the formation of glycerolipid molecules for the majority of cellular membrane systems and the deposition of storage lipid in seeds takes place in the cytosolic compartment. In this report, we present a study of an Arabidopsis mutant, ar21, with a novel seed fatty acid phenotype showing higher contents of eicosanoic acid (20:1) and oleic acid (18:1) and a reduced level of Œ±-linolenic acid (18:3). A combination of map-based cloning and whole-genome sequencing identified the genetic basis underlying the fatty acid phenotype as a lesion in the plant-specific eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIFiso4G1. Transcriptome analysis on developing seeds revealed a reduced level of plastid-encoded genes. Specifically, decreases in both transcript and protein levels of an enzyme involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, the Œ≤-subunit of the plastidic heteromeric acetyl-CoA carboxylase (htACCase) encoded by accD, were evident in the mutant. Biochemical assays showed that the developing seeds of the mutant possessed a decreased htACCase activity in the plastid but an elevated activity of homomeric acetyl-CoA carboxylase (hmACCase). These results suggested that the increased 20:1 was attributable at least in part to the enhanced cytosolic hmACCase activity. We also detected a significant repression of FATTY ACID DESATURASE 3 (FAD3) during seed development, which correlated with a decreased 18:3 level in seed oil. Together, our study on a mutant of eIFiso4G1 uncovered multifaceted interactions between the cytosolic and plastidic compartments in seed lipid biosynthesis that impact major seed oil traits.
Barley yellow dwarf virus RNA, lacking a 5' cap and a 3' poly(A) tail, contains a cap-independent translation element (BTE) in the 3'-untranslated region that interacts with host translation initiation factor eIF4G. To determine how eIF4G recruits the mRNA, three eIF4G deletion mutants were constructed: (i) eIF4G601-1196, containing amino acids 601-1196, including the putative BTE-binding region, and binding domains for eIF4E, eIF4A, and eIF4B; (ii) eIF4G601-1488, which contains an additional C-terminal eIF4A-binding domain; and (iii) eIF4G742-1196, which lacks the eIF4E-binding site. eIF4G601-1196 binds BTE tightly and supports efficient translation. The helicase complex, consisting of eIF4A, eIF4B, and ATP, stimulated BTE binding with eIF4G601-1196 but not eIF4G601-1488, suggesting that the eIF4A binding domains may serve a regulatory role, with the C-terminal binding site having negative effects. eIF4E binding to eIF4G601-1196 induced a conformational change, significantly increasing the binding affinity to BTE. A comparison of the binding of eIF4G deletion mutants with BTEs containing mutations showed a general correlation between binding affinity and ability to facilitate translation. In summary, these results reveal a new role for the helicase complex in 3' cap-independent translation element-mediated translation and show that the functional core domain of eIF4G plus an adjacent probable RNA-binding domain mediate translation initiation.
Schizophrenia is a disabling mental illness associated with dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex, which affects cognition and emotion. The purpose of the present study was to identify altered molecular networks in the prefrontal cortex of schizophrenia patients by comparing protein expression levels in autopsied brains of patients and controls, using a combination of targeted and focused quantitative proteomics. We selected 125 molecules possibly related to schizophrenia for quantification by knowledge-based targeted proteomics. Among the quantified molecules, GRIK4 and MAO-B were significantly decreased in plasma membrane and cytosolic fractions, respectively, of prefrontal cortex. Focused quantitative proteomics identified 15 increased and 39 decreased proteins. Network analysis identified "GNA13-ERK1-eIF4G2 signaling" as a downregulated network, and proteins involved in this network were significantly decreased. Furthermore, searching downstream of eIF4G2 revealed that eIF4A1/2 and CYFIP1 were decreased, suggesting that downregulation of the network suppresses expression of CYFIP1, which regulates actin remodeling and is involved in axon outgrowth and spine formation. Downregulation of this signaling seems likely to impair axon formation and synapse plasticity of neuronal cells, and could be associated with development of cognitive impairment in the pathology of schizophrenia.
The present study compared the proteome of the prefrontal cortex between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls by means of targeted proteomics and global quantitative proteomics. Targeted proteomics revealed that GRIK4 and MAOB were significantly decreased among 125 putatively schizophrenia-related proteins in prefrontal cortex of schizophrenia patients. Global quantitative proteomics identified 54 differentially expressed proteins in schizophrenia brains. The protein profile indicates attenuation of "GNA13-ERK signaling" in schizophrenia brain. In particular, EIF4G2 and CYFIP1, which are located downstream of the GNA13-ERK network, were decreased, suggesting that the attenuation of this signal network may cause impairment of axon formation and synapse plasticity in the brain of schizophrenia patients. Our results provide a novel insight into schizophrenia pathology, and could be helpful for drug development.
The formation of the mRNP complex is a critical component of translational regulation and mRNA decay. Both the 5' and 3'UTRs of CSF-1 mRNA are involved in post-transcriptional regulation. In CSF-1 mRNA, a small hairpin loop structure is predicted to form at the extreme 5' end (2-21nt) of the 5'UTR. Nucleolin binds the hairpin loop structure in the 5'UTR of CSF-1 mRNA and enhances translation, while removal of this hairpin loop nucleolin binding element dramatically represses translation. Thus in CSF-1 mRNA, the hairpin loop nucleolin binding element is critical for translational regulation. In addition, nucleolin interacts with the 3'UTR of CSF-1 mRNA and facilitates the miRISC formation which results in poly (A) tail shortening. The overexpression of nucleolin increases the association of CSF-1 mRNA containing short poly (A)n‚â§26, with polyribosomes. Nucleolin both forms an mRNP complex with the eIF4G and CSF-1 mRNA, and is co-localized with the eIF4G in the cytoplasm further supporting nucleolin's role in translational regulation. The distinct foci formation of nucleolin in the cytoplasm of ovarian and breast cancer cells implicates the translational promoting role of nucleolin in these cancers.
Although microRNAs and EIF4G2 are both known to play pivotal roles in cancer progression, it remains unknown whether these pathways regulate chemosensitivity in a coordinated manner. Here, we show that miR-379 expression is significantly downregulated in chemoresistant nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues and cells. Manipulation of miR-379 levels could alter the in vitro and in vivo cisplatin (CDDP) resistance in lung cancer (LCa) cells. Mechanistically, miR-379 potentiated LCa chemosensitivity via modulation of CDDP-induced apoptosis by directly targeting the EIF4G2 3'UTR. Additionally, we observed an inverse correlation between miR-379 and EIF4G2 expression in LCa tissues from patients with CDDP-based chemotherapy. Together, our findings shed new light on the potential involvement of miR-379/EIF4G2 cascade in the pathogenesis of CDDP resistance in LCa.
A recent study revealed that poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) bound to poly(A) RNA exhibits a sharply bent configuration at the linker region between RNA-recognition motif 2 (RRM2) and RRM3, whereas free PABP exhibits a highly flexible linear configuration. However, the physiological role of the bent structure of mRNA-bound PABP remains unknown. We investigated a role of the bent structure of PABP by constructing a PABP variant that fails to form the poly(A)-dependent bent structure but maintains its poly(A)-binding activity. We found that the bent structure of PABP/poly(A) complex is required for PABP's efficient interaction with eIF4G and eIF4G/eIF4E complex. Moreover, the mutant PABP had compromised translation activation function and failed to augment the formation of 80S translation initiation complex in an in vitro translation system. These results suggest that the bent conformation of PABP, which is induced by the interaction with 3' poly(A) tail, mediates poly(A)-dependent translation by facilitating the interaction with eIF4G and the eIF4G/eIF4E complex. The preferential binding of the eIF4G/eIF4E complex to the bent PABP/poly(A) complex seems to be a mechanism discriminating the mRNA-bound PABPs participating in translation from the idling mRNA-unbound PABPs.
Novel APOBEC1 target 1 (Nat1) (also known as "p97," "Dap5," and "Eif4g2") is a ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic protein that is homologous to the C-terminal two thirds of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (Eif4g1). We previously showed that Nat1-null mouse embryonic stem cells (mES cells) are resistant to differentiation. In the current study, we found that NAT1 and eIF4G1 share many binding proteins, such as the eukaryotic translation initiation factors eIF3 and eIF4A and ribosomal proteins. However, NAT1 did not bind to eIF4E or poly(A)-binding proteins, which are critical for cap-dependent translation initiation. In contrast, compared with eIF4G1, NAT1 preferentially interacted with eIF2, fragile X mental retardation proteins (FMR), and related proteins and especially with members of the proline-rich and coiled-coil-containing protein 2 (PRRC2) family. We also found that Nat1-null mES cells possess a transcriptional profile similar, although not identical, to the ground state, which is established in wild-type mES cells when treated with inhibitors of the ERK and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) signaling pathways. In Nat1-null mES cells, the ERK pathway is suppressed even without inhibitors. Ribosome profiling revealed that translation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3 (Map3k3) and son of sevenless homolog 1 (Sos1) is suppressed in the absence of Nat1 Forced expression of Map3k3 induced differentiation of Nat1-null mES cells. These data collectively show that Nat1 is involved in the translation of proteins that are required for cell differentiation.
The mechanisms regulating initiation of mRNA translation for the generation of protein products that mediate interferon (IFN) responses are largely unknown. We have previously shown that both Type I and II IFNs engage the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), resulting in downstream phosphorylation and deactivation of the translational repressor 4E-BP1 (eIF4E-binding protein 1). In the current study, we provide direct evidence that such regulation of 4E-BP1 by IFNalpha or IFNgamma results in sequential dissociation of 4E-BP1 from eukaryotic initiation factor-4E and subsequent formation of a functional complex between eukaryotic initiation factor-4E and eukaryotic initiation factor-4G, to allow initiation of mRNA translation. We also demonstrate that the induction of key IFNalpha- or IFNgamma-inducible proteins (ISG15 (interferon-stimulated gene 15) and CXCL10) that mediate IFN responses are enhanced in 4E-BP1 (4E-BP1(-/-)) knockout MEFs, as compared with wild-type 4E-BP1(+/+) MEFs. On the other hand, IFN-dependent transcriptional regulation of the Isg15 and Cxcl10 genes is intact in the absence of 4E-BP1, as determined by real time reverse transcriptase-PCR assays and promoter assays for ISRE and GAS, establishing that 4E-BP1 plays a selective negative regulatory role in IFN-induced mRNA translation. Interestingly, the induction of expression of ISG15 and CXCL10 proteins by IFNs was also strongly enhanced in cells lacking expression of the tuberin (TSC2(-/-)) or hamartin (TSC1(-/-)) genes, consistent with the known negative regulatory effect of the TSC1-TSC2 complex on mTOR activation. In other work, we demonstrate that the induction of an IFN-dependent antiviral response is strongly enhanced in cells lacking expression of 4E-BP1 and TSC2, demonstrating that these elements of the IFN-activated mTOR pathway exhibit important regulatory effects in the generation of IFN responses. Taken altogether, our data suggest an important role for mTOR-dependent pathways in IFN signaling and identify 4E-BP1 and TSC1-TSC2 as key components in the generation of IFN-dependent biological responses.
The 5' cap and 3' poly(A) tail of eukaryotic mRNAs act synergistically to enhance translation. This synergy is mediated via interactions between eIF4G (a component of the eIF4F cap binding complex) and poly(A) binding protein (PABP). Paip2 (PABP-interacting protein 2) binds PABP and inhibits translation both in vitro and in vivo by decreasing the affinity of PABP for polyadenylated RNA. Here, we describe the functional characteristics of Paip2B, a Paip2 homolog. A full-length brain cDNA of Paip2B encodes a protein that shares 59% identity and 80% similarity with Paip2 (Paip2A), with the highest conservation in the two PABP binding domains. Paip2B acts in a manner similar to Paip2A to inhibit translation of capped and polyadenylated mRNAs both in vitro and in vivo by displacing PABP from the poly(A) tail. Also, similar to Paip2A, Paip2B does not affect the translation mediated by the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of hepatitis C virus (HCV). However, Paip2A and Paip2B differ with respect to both mRNA and protein distribution in different tissues and cell lines. Paip2A is more highly ubiquitinated than is Paip2B and is degraded more rapidly by the proteasome. Paip2 protein degradation may constitute a primary mechanism by which cells regulate PABP activity in translation.
eIF3 in mammals is the largest translation initiation factor ( approximately 800 kDa) and is composed of 13 nonidentical subunits designated eIF3a-m. The role of mammalian eIF3 in assembly of the 48 S complex occurs through high affinity binding to eIF4G. Interactions of eIF4G with eIF4E, eIF4A, eIF3, poly(A)-binding protein, and Mnk1/2 have been mapped to discrete domains on eIF4G, and conversely, the eIF4G-binding sites on all but one of these ligands have been determined. The only eIF4G ligand for which this has not been determined is eIF3. In this study, we have sought to identify the mammalian eIF3 subunit(s) that directly interact(s) with eIF4G. Established procedures for detecting protein-protein interactions gave ambiguous results. However, binding of partially proteolyzed HeLa eIF3 to the eIF3-binding domain of human eIF4G-1, followed by high throughput analysis of mass spectrometric data with a novel peptide matching algorithm, identified a single subunit, eIF3e (p48/Int-6). In addition, recombinant FLAG-eIF3e specifically competed with HeLa eIF3 for binding to eIF4G in vitro. Adding FLAG-eIF3e to a cell-free translation system (i) inhibited protein synthesis, (ii) caused a shift of mRNA from heavy to light polysomes, (iii) inhibited cap-dependent translation more severely than translation dependent on the HCV or CSFV internal ribosome entry sites, which do not require eIF4G, and (iv) caused a dramatic loss of eIF4G and eIF2alpha from complexes sedimenting at approximately 40 S. These data suggest a specific, direct, and functional interaction of eIF3e with eIF4G during the process of cap-dependent translation initiation, although they do not rule out participation of other eIF3 subunits.
The cellular polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) is recruited by the genomic RNAs of picornaviruses to stimulate translation initiation at their internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements. We investigated the contribution of the individual RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains of PTB to its interaction with the IRES of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). Using a native gel system, we found that PTB is a monomer, confirming recent reports that challenged the previous view that PTB is a dimer. Mapping the spatial orientation of PTB relative to the bound IRES RNA, we found that the two C-terminal RRM domains III and IV of PTB bind in an oriented way to the IRES. Domain III contacts the IRES stem-loop 2, while domain IV contacts the separate IRES 3' region. PTB domain I appears not to be involved directly in RNA binding, but domain II stabilizes the RNA binding conferred by domains III and IV. A PTB protein containing only these two C-terminal PTB domains is sufficient to enhance the entry of initiation factor eIF4G to the IRES and stimulate IRES activity, and the long-lived PTB-IRES interaction stabilized by domain II is not a prerequisite for this function. Thus, PTB most likely acts as an RNA chaperone to stabilize IRES structure and, in that way, augment IRES activity.
Eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) promotes mRNA recruitment to the ribosome by binding to the mRNA cap- and poly(A) tail-binding proteins eIF4E and Pap1p. eIF4G also binds eIF4A at a distinct HEAT domain composed of five stacks of antiparallel alpha-helices. The role of eIF4G in the later steps of initiation, such as scanning and AUG recognition, has not been defined. Here we show that the entire HEAT domain and flanking residues of Saccharomyces cerevisiae eIF4G2 are required for the optimal interaction with the AUG recognition factors eIF5 and eIF1. eIF1 binds simultaneously to eIF4G and eIF3c in vitro, as shown previously for the C-terminal domain of eIF5. In vivo, co-overexpression of eIF1 or eIF5 reverses the genetic suppression of an eIF4G HEAT domain Ts(-) mutation by eIF4A overexpression. In addition, excess eIF1 inhibits growth of a second eIF4G mutant defective in eIF4E binding, which was also reversed by co-overexpression of eIF4A. Interestingly, excess eIF1 carrying the sui1-1 mutation, known to relax the accuracy of start site selection, did not inhibit the growth of the eIF4G mutant, and sui1-1 reduced the interaction between eIF4G and eIF1 in vitro. Moreover, a HEAT domain mutation altering eIF4G moderately enhances translation from a non-AUG codon. These results strongly suggest that the binding of the eIF4G HEAT domain to eIF1 and eIF5 is important for maintaining the integrity of the scanning ribosomal preinitiation complex.
In eukaryotes, the m(7)GpppN cap structure is added to all nascent RNA polymerase II transcripts, and serves important functions at multiple steps of RNA metabolism. The predominantly nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC) binds to the cap during RNA synthesis. The predominantly cytoplasmic eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) is thought to replace CBC after export of mature mRNA to the cytoplasm, and mediates the bulk of cellular translation. Yeast as well as mammalian CBC interacts in vitro with eIF4G, a subunit of eIF4F. In this work, we investigate a potential role of this interaction during translation in yeast. We identify a mutation (DR548/9AA) in Tif4631p, one of two isoforms of yeast eIF4G, that abolishes its binding to CBC. Cells expressing this mutant protein as the sole source of eIF4G grow at wild-type rates, and bulk cellular translation, as assessed by metabolic labeling and polysome profile analysis, is unchanged. Importantly, we find that the DR548/9AA mutation neither diminishes nor delays the translation of newly induced reporter mRNA. Finally, microarray analysis reveals marked transcriptome alterations in CBC subunit deletion strains, whereas eIF4G point mutants have essentially a wild-type transcriptome composition. Collectively, these data suggest that in yeast, the phenotypic consequences of CBC deletions are separable from its interaction with eIF4G, and that the CBC-eIF4G interaction is dispensable for a potential "pioneering round" of translation in yeast.
Initiation of translation of encephalomyocarditis virus mRNA is mediated by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) comprising structural domains H, I, J-K, and L immediately upstream of the initiation codon AUG at nucleotide 834 (AUG834). Assembly of 48S ribosomal complexes on the IRES requires eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), eIF3, eIF4A, and the central domain of eIF4G to which eIF4A binds. Footprinting experiments confirmed that eIF4G binds a three-way helical junction in the J-K domain and showed that it interacts extensively with RNA duplexes in the J-K and L domains. Deletion of apical hairpins in the J and K domains synergistically impaired the binding of eIF4G and IRES function. Directed hydroxyl radical probing, done by using Fe(II) tethered to surface residues in eIF4G's central domain, indicated that it is oriented with its N terminus towards the base of domain J and its C terminus towards the apex. eIF4G recruits eIF4A to a defined location on the IRES, and the eIF4G/eIF4A complex caused localized ATP-independent conformational changes in the eIF4G-binding region of the IRES. This complex also induced more extensive conformational rearrangements at the 3' border of the ribosome binding site that required ATP and active eIF4A. We propose that these conformational changes prepare the region flanking AUG834 for productive binding of the ribosome.
The foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) leader (L) proteinase is an important virulence determinant in FMDV infections. It possesses two distinct catalytic activities: (i) C-terminal processing at the L/VP4 junction; and (ii) induction of the cleavage of translation initiation factor eIF4G, an event that inhibits cap-dependent translation in infected cells. The only other member of the Aphthovirus genus, equine rhinitis A virus (ERAV), also encodes an L protein, but this shares only 32% amino acid identity with its FMDV counterpart. Another more distantly related picornavirus, equine rhinitis B virus (ERBV), which is not classified as an aphthovirus, also encodes an L protein. Using in vitro transcription and translation analysis, we have shown that both ERAV and ERBV L proteins have C-terminal processing activity. Furthermore, expression of ERAV L, but not ERBV L, in BHK-21 cells resulted in the efficient inhibition of cap-dependent translation in these cells. We have shown that the ERAV and FMDV L proteinases induce cleavage of eIF4GI at very similar or identical positions. Interestingly, ERAV 3C also induces eIF4GI cleavage and again produces distinct products that co-migrate with those induced by FMDV 3C. The ERBV L proteinase does not induce eIF4GI cleavage, consistent with its inability to shut down cap-dependent translation. We have also shown that another unique feature of FMDV L, the stimulation of enterovirus internal ribosome entry site (IRES) activity, is also shared by the ERAV L proteinase but not by ERBV L. The functional conservation of the divergent ERAV and FMDV proteinases indicates the likelihood of a similar and important role for these enzymes in the pathogenesis of infections caused by these distantly related aphthoviruses.
The question of whether translation initiation factor eIF4E and the complete eIF4G polypeptide are required for initiation dependent on the IRES (internal ribosome entry site) of hepatitis A virus (HAV) has been examined using in vitro translation in standard and eIF4G-depleted rabbit reticulocyte lysates. In agreement with previous publications, the HAV IRES is unique among all picornavirus IRESs in that it was inhibited if translation initiation factor eIF4G was cleaved by foot-and-mouth disease L-proteases. In addition, the HAV IRES was inhibited by addition of eIF4E-binding protein 1, which binds tightly to eIF4E and sequesters it, thus preventing its association with eIF4G. The HAV IRES was also inhibited by addition of m(7)GpppG cap analogue, irrespective of whether the RNA tested was capped or not. Thus, initiation on the HAV IRES requires that eIF4E be associated with eIF4G and that the cap-binding pocket of eIF4E be empty and unoccupied. This suggests two alternative models: (i) initiation requires a direct interaction between an internal site in the IRES and eIF4E/4G, an interaction which involves the cap-binding pocket of eIF4E in addition to any direct eIF4G-RNA interactions; or (ii) it requires eIF4G in a particular conformation which can be attained only if eIF4E is bound to it, with the cap-binding pocket of the eIF4E unoccupied.
Interaction of the translational repressor 4E-BP1 with the mRNA cap binding protein eIF4E plays an important role in the regulation of translation initiation. This interaction is modulated by phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 on at least six residues. However, analysis of the functional importance of the individual phosphorylation sites is complicated by the lack of information about the kinases and phosphatases involved in modulating phosphorylation of each site. The goal of the present study was to establish a system whereby alterations in the interaction of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E could be easily and directly measured. In initial studies, both eIF4E and 4E-BP1 were expressed as recombinant proteins coupled to variants of green fluorescent protein (ECFP and EYFP, respectively). Addition of purified EYFP--4E-BP1 to ECFP--eIF4E caused both a decrease in emission intensity at 480 nm and an increase at 535 nm indicating that protein-protein interaction had occurred. The interaction was stoichiometric and was blocked by eIF4G. Phosphorylation of EYFP--4E-BP1 by the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK2, but not by casein kinase CK-II, also attenuated the interaction. Results using proteins in which the fluorescent protein tag was located at either the N- or C-terminus suggested that, in the protein complex, the N-termini of the two proteins are in close spatial proximity, as are the C-termini. Overall, the results demonstrate that fluorescence resonance energy transfer between EYFP--4E-BP1 and ECFP--eIF4E is a valuable tool in directly measuring alterations in the interaction of the two proteins.
mRNA translation in eukaryotic cells involves a set of proteins termed translation initiation factors (eIFs), several of which are involved in the binding of ribosomes to mRNA. These include eIF4G, a modular scaffolding protein, and eIF4A, an RNA helicase, of which two closely related forms are known in mammals, eIF4A(I) and eIF4A(II). In mammals, eIF4G possesses two independent sites for binding eIF4A, whereas in other eukaryotes (e.g. yeast) only one site appears to be present, thus raising the issue of the stoichiometry of eIF4G.eIF4A complexes in different eukaryotes. We show that in human embryonic kidney cells eIF4G is associated with eIF4A(I) or eIF4A(II) but not with both simultaneously, suggesting a stoichiometry of 1:1 rather than 1:2. To confirm this, eIF4A(I) or eIF4A(II) was expressed in a tagged form in these cells, and complexes with eIF4G were again isolated. Complexes containing tagged eIF4A(I) or eIF4A(II) contained no endogenous eIF4A, supporting the notion that eIF4G binds only one molecule of eIF4A. Each binding site in eIF4G can bind either eIF4A(I) or eIF4A(II). The data imply that the second binding site in mammalian eIF4A does not bind an additional eIF4A molecule and that initiation factor complexes in different eukaryotes contain one eIF4A per eIF4G.
The 5' cap and 3' poly(A) tail of eukaryotic mRNAs cooperate to synergistically stimulate translation initiation in vivo. We recently described mammalian cytoplasmic extracts which, following ultracentrifugation to partially deplete them of ribosomes and associated initiation factors, reproduce cap-poly(A) synergy in vitro. Using these systems, we demonstrate that synergy requires interaction between the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) and the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4F holoenzyme complex, which recognises the 5' cap. Here we further characterise the requirements and constraints of cap-poly(A) synergy in reticulocyte lysates by evaluating the effects of different parameters on synergy. The extent of extract depletion and the amounts of different initiation factors in depleted extracts were examined, as well as the effects of varying the concentrations of KCl, MgCl(2) and programming mRNA and of adding a cap analogue. The results presented demonstrate that maximal cap-poly(A) synergy requires: (i) limiting concentrations of ribosome-associated initiation factors; (ii) precise ratios of mRNA to translation machinery (low concentrations of ribosome-associated initiation factors and low, non-saturating mRNA concentrations); (iii) physiological concentrations of added KCl and MgCl(2). Additionally, we show that the eIF4G-PABP interaction on mRNAs which are capped and polyadenylated significantly increases the affinity of eIF4E for the 5' cap.
Eukaryotic initiation factor eIF2B and eukaryotic elongation factor eEF2 each mediate regulatory steps important for the overall regulation of mRNA translation in mammalian cells and are activated by insulin. Here, we demonstrate that their activation by insulin requires the presence, in the medium in which the cells are maintained, of both amino acids and glucose: insulin only induced activation of eIF2B and the dephosphorylation of eEF2 when cells were exposed to both types of nutrient. Other translational regulators, e.g. the 70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70 S6 kinase) and the eIF4E binding protein 1, 4E-BP1, are also regulated by insulin but their control does not require glucose, only amino acids. The effects of nutrients on the activation of eIF2B do not reflect changes in the phosphorylation of eIF2 (and, by inference, operation of a kinase analogous to yeast Gcn2p), or a requirement for nutrients for inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 or dephosphorylation of eIF2B. Nutrients did not affect the ability of insulin to activate protein kinase B. These data show that activation by insulin of p70 S6 kinase, which modulates the translation of specific mRNAs, depends on the availability of amino acids whereas regulation of factors involved in overall activation of translation (eIF2B, eEF2) requires both amino acids and glucose. These results add substantially to the emerging evidence that nutrients themselves modulate functions of mammalian cells and indicate that (i) nutrients modulate the activation of eIF2B and eEF2 through as-yet unidentified mechanisms and (ii) regulation of p70 S6 kinase and 4E-BP1 by insulin requires other inputs in addition to protein kinase B.
Protein synthesis in skeletal muscle is markedly stimulated (approximately 180% of control rate) within 3 h of oral feeding in mice subjected to an overnight fast (18 h). The stimulation of protein synthesis is the result of a faster rate of translation initiation; however, neither the mediators (i.e., hormones or nutrients) nor the mechanisms responsible for the effect of feeding are well understood. Results of the present study revealed that the amount of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF-4E) present in the phosphorylated form (i.e., 70%) was not changed after overnight starvation or a subsequent 3-h refeeding period compared with muscles from freely fed mice. In contrast, the phosphorylation state of the eIF-4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) was changed with nutritional state. Starvation increased the proportion of the unphosphorylated form of 4E-BP1, whereas feeding promoted a shift to the more highly phosphorylated forms of the protein. Moreover, starvation increased the amount of 4E-BP1 recovered by almost threefold, indicative of an increase in the eIF-4E.4E-BP1 complex. The increased association of 4E-BP1 with eIF-4E was completely reversed within 3 h of feeding. Starvation and refeeding also altered the amount of eIF-4G that coimmunoprecipitated with eIF-4E. However, in contrast to the results obtained for 4E-BP1, starvation decreased the amount of eIF-4G recovered in the eIF-4E immunoprecipitate, suggesting that starvation causes a decrease in the formation of the active eIF-4F complex. The alterations in 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and association of 4E-BP1 and eIF-4G with eIF-4E observed in control mice in response to starvation and refeeding were also observed in diabetic mice exhibiting characteristics of type I or type II diabetes subjected to the same conditions, suggesting that insulin alone does not mediate the observed changes. Thus the integrated feeding response represents an important area of investigation for understanding the regulation of translation initiation.
A novel mammalian gene, Eif4g2, with a high degree of homology to the p82 subunit of the wheat germ eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF-(iso)4F and mammalian eIF-4G has been isolated. Zoo blot analysis indicates that Eif4g2 is a single-copy gene that is highly conserved among vertebrates. Northern blot analysis shows that Eif4g2 is ubiquitously expressed at high levels in all human and mouse tissues examined. The 3810-nucleotide Eif4g2 cDNA contains a 907-amino-acid open reading frame that codes for a polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 102 kDa. The Eif4g2 polypeptide exhibits an overall similarity to wheat p82 of 52%. A 248-amino-acid segment at the amino-terminal end of both peptides exhibits 63% similarity and contains conserved potential RNA binding domains and a phosphorylation site. The Eif4g2 polypeptide contains multiple potential N-linked glycosylation sites as well as protein kinase C and casein kinase II phosphorylation sites. Southern blot analysis of DNA from interspecific backcross mice shows that Eif4g2 is localized to distal mouse chromosome 7 in a region syntenic with human chromosome 11p15.
The foot and mouth disease virus, a picornavirus, encodes two forms of a cysteine proteinase (leader or L protease) that bisects the EIF4G polypeptide of the initiation factor complex eIF4F into N-terminal (Nt) and C-terminal (Ct) domains. Previously we showed that, although in vitro cleavage of the translation initiation factor, eIF4G, with L protease decreases cap-dependent translation, the cleavage products themselves may directly promote cap-dependent protein synthesis. We now demonstrate that translation of uncapped mRNAs normally exhibits a strong requirement for eIF4F. However, this dependence is abolished when eIF4G is cleaved, with the Ct domain capable of supporting translation in the absence of the Nt domain. In contrast, the efficient translation of the second cistron of bicistronic mRNAs, directed by two distinct Internal Ribosome Entry Segments (IRES), exhibits no requirement for eIF4E but is dependent upon either intact eIF4G or the Ct domain. These results demonstrate that: (i) the apparent requirement for eIF4F for internal initiation on IRES-driven mRNAs can be fulfilled by the Ct proteolytic cleavage product; (ii) when eIF4G is cleaved, the Ct domain can also support cap-independent translation of cellular mRNAs not possessing an IRES element, in the absence of eIF4E; and (iii) when eIF4G is intact, translation of cellular mRNAs, whether capped or uncapped, is strictly dependent upon eIF4E. These data complement recent work in other laboratories defining the binding sites for other initiation factors on the eIF4G molecule.
Leucine (Leu) activates mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) to upregulate protein synthesis (PS).
PS in skeletal muscles, heart, liver, pancreas, and jejunum, but not kidney, were greater in low protein supplemented with Leu (LP+L) than LP, but lower than high protein (HP). In longissimus dorsi muscle, protein kinase B phosphorylation was similar in LP and LP+L, but lower than HP. Although less than HP, p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E binding protein 1 (4EBP1) association with regulatory associated protein of mammalian target of rapamycin was greater in LP+L than LP, resulting in higher S6K1 and 4EBP1 phosphorylation. Feeding LP+L vs. LP decreased 4EBP1¬∑eIF4E and increased eIF4E¬∑eIF4G formation, but not to HP. Similar results were obtained for S6K1 and 4EBP1 phosphorylation in gastrocnemius, masseter, heart, liver, pancreas, and jejunum, but not kidney. eIF2Œ± and elongation factor 2 phosphorylation was unaffected by treatment. DICUSSION: Our results suggest that enteral Leu supplementation of a low protein diet enhances PS in most tissues through mTOR complex 1 pathways.
To examine enteral Leu effects on PS and signaling activation, 5-d-old piglets were fed for 24 h diets containing: (i) LP, (ii) LP+L, or (iii) HP.
Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) from the HRV-A, HRV-B, and HRV-C species use encoded proteases, 2A(pro) and 3C(pro), to process their polyproteins and shut off host cell activities detrimental to virus replication. Reactions attributed to 2A(pro) include cleavage of eIF4G-I and -II to inhibit cellular mRNA translation and cleavage of select nucleoporin proteins (Nups) within nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) to disrupt karyopherin-dependent nuclear-cytoplasmic transport and signaling. Sequence diversity among 2A(pro) proteases from different HRV clades, even within species, suggested individual viruses might carry out these processes with unique mechanistic signatures. Six different recombinant 2A(pro) proteases (A16, A89, B04, B14, Cw12, and Cw24) were compared for their relative substrate preferences and cleavage kinetics using eIF4G from cellular extracts and Nups presented in native (NPC) or recombinant formats. The enzyme panel attacked these substrates with different rates or processing profiles, mimicking the preferences observed during natural infection (A16 and B14). For eIF4G, all 2A(pro) proteases cleaved at similar sites, but the comparative rates were species specific (HRV-A &gt; HRV-C ‚â´ HRV-B). For Nup substrates, 5 of the 6 enzymes had unique product profiles (order of Nup selection) or reacted at different sites within Nup62, Nup98, and Nup153. Only A16 and A89 behaved similarly in most assays. Since each type of karyopherin receptor prefers particular Nups or uses a limited cohort of binding motifs within those Nups, the consequences of individual 2A(pro) avidities could profoundly affect relative viral replication levels, intracellular signaling, or extracellular signaling, all of which are underlying triggers for different host immune responses.
Translation re-initiation provides the molecular basis for translational control of mammalian ATF4 and yeast GCN4 mediated by short upstream open reading (uORFs) in response to eIF2 phosphorylation. eIF4G is the major adaptor subunit of eIF4F that binds the cap-binding subunit eIF4E and the mRNA helicase eIF4A and is also required for re-initiation in mammals. Here we show that the yeast eIF4G2 mutations altering eIF4E- and eIF4A-binding sites increase re-initiation at GCN4 and impair recognition of the start codons of uORF1 or uORF4 located after uORF1. The increase in re-initiation at GCN4 was partially suppressed by increasing the distance between uORF1 and GCN4, suggesting that the mutations decrease the migration rate of the scanning ribosome in the GCN4 leader. Interestingly, eIF4E overexpression suppressed both the phenotypes caused by the mutation altering eIF4E-binding site. Thus, eIF4F is required for accurate AUG selection and re-initiation also in yeast, and the eIF4G interaction with the mRNA-cap appears to promote eIF4F re-acquisition by the re-initiating 40 S subunit. However, eIF4A overexpression suppressed the impaired AUG recognition but not the increase in re-initiation caused by the mutations altering eIF4A-binding site. These results not only provide evidence that mRNA unwinding by eIF4A stimulates start codon recognition, but also suggest that the eIF4A-binding site on eIF4G made of the HEAT domain stimulates the ribosomal scanning independent of eIF4A. Based on the RNA-binding activities identified within the unstructured segments flanking the eIF4G2 HEAT domain, we discuss the role of the HEAT domain in scanning beyond loading eIF4A onto the pre-initiation complex.
The predominantly nuclear heterogenous ribonucleoprotein A18 (hnRNP A18) translocates to the cytosol in response to cellular stress and increases translation by specifically binding to the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of several mRNA transcripts and the eukaryotic initiation factor 4G. Here, we identified a 51-nucleotide motif that is present 11.49 times more often in the 3'-UTR of hnRNP A18 mRNA targets than in the UniGene data base. This motif was identified by computational analysis of primary sequences and secondary structures of hnRNP A18 mRNA targets against the unaligned sequences. Band shift analyses indicate that the motif is sufficient to confer binding to hnRNP A18. A search of the entire UniGene data base indicates that the hnRNP A18 motif is also present in the 3'-UTR of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) mRNA. Validation of the predicted hnRNP A18 motif is provided by amplification of endogenous ATR transcript on polysomal fractions immunoprecipitated with hnRNP A18. Moreover, overexpression of hnRNP A18 results in increased ATR protein levels and increased phosphorylation of Chk1, a preferred ATR substrate, in response to UV radiation. In addition, our data indicate that inhibition of casein kinase II or GSK3beta significantly reduced hnRNP A18 cytosolic translocation in response to UV radiation. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first demonstration of a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism for ATR activity. hnRNP A18 could thus become a new target to trigger ATR activity as back-up stress response mechanisms to functionally compensate for absent or defective responders.
Here, we report the results of proteomic analysis of the mouse thymoma EL4 cell line exposed to bis(tri-n-butylin)oxide (TBTO), an immunotoxic organotin compound. The objective of the work was to examine whether TBTO affects the expression of proteins in this cell line and to compare the differentially expressed proteins with the corresponding mRNA expression data. The identified proteins were quantified using a label-free quantitative method based on counting the observed peptides as an index of protein abundance. The calculation of the ratio of peptides obtained from exposed and control samples allowed us to evaluate the effect of TBTO on protein expression and to compare these results to those obtained in gene expression profiling studies. Correlation of some of the differentially expressed proteins and their corresponding mRNAs was observed. The analysis of the protein ratios revealed that 12 proteins were significantly affected. These proteins included cytoskeleton proteins myosin-9, spectrin beta 2 and plectin 8. The first two proteins were down-regulated 3-fold, whereas the third was up-regulated 2-fold. Ras-related Rab1, a GTP binding protein and T-complex protein-1 subunit alpha, a chaperonin, were decreased 2- and 3.6-fold, respectively. The ribosomal S10 and eukaryotic translation factor (eIf4G1), which are involved in protein synthesis, were down-regulated 2.6- and 3.7-fold, respectively. Also, proteins involved in splicing of pre-mRNA and in transcription, splicing factor arginine/serine-rich 2 and chromodomain-helicase-DNA binding protein 4 (Chd4), were decreased 2.6- and 4.5 times, respectively. Nuclear RNA helicase II was reduced 2.8-fold. Finally, prothymosin-alpha (ProTalpha), an essential protein for cell proliferation, and a protein similar to ProTalpha, (with a molecular weight and a pI (3.54) comparable to that of ProTalpha) were also down-regulated 6-and 8-fold, respectively. We propose that the observed down-regulation of the expression level of ProTalpha in the TBTO-exposed cells could account for the previously reported anti-proliferative effect of TBTO.
Poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) is a key player in mRNA circularization and translation initiation of polyadenylated mRNAs. It simultaneously binds the 3' poly(A) tail of an mRNA and eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G), which forms part of the translation initiation complex assembling at the 5'end, thus circularizing the RNA molecule and enhancing translation initiation. Here, we report the binding of PABP to the non-polyadenylated 3'end of dengue virus (DENV) RNA. PABP binds the DENV 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) internally, upstream of the conserved 3'stem-loop near the two dumb-bell structures, and can be displaced by poly(A) RNA. The PABP-specific translation inhibitor PABP-interacting protein 2 (Paip2) interferes with the DENV 3'UTR-PABP interaction, and in vitro translation of DENV reporter RNAs in baby hamster kidney cell extracts is inhibited by Paip2 in a dose-dependent manner. Our findings show an expanded translation mechanism for PABP, binding to a viral RNA lacking a terminal poly(A) tail.
beta-Hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB; 50 microM) has been shown to attenuate the depression in protein synthesis in murine myotubes in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) with or without interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and angiotensin II (ANG II). The mechanism for the depression of protein synthesis by all three agents was the same and was attributed to activation of double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) with the subsequent phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) on the alpha-subunit as well as increased phosphorylation of the elongation factor (eEF2). Myotubes expressing a catalytically inactive PKR variant, PKRDelta6, showed no depression of protein synthesis in response to either LPS or TNF-alpha, confirming the importance of PKR in this process. There was no effect of any of the agents on phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) or initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1), and thus no change in the amount of eIF4E bound to 4E-BP1 or the concentration of the active eIF4E.eIF4G complex. HMB attenuated phosphorylation of eEF2, possibly by increasing phosphorylation of mTOR, and also attenuated phosphorylation of eIF2alpha by preventing activation of PKR. These results suggest that HMB may be effective in attenuating muscle atrophy in a range of catabolic conditions.
The RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) C-terminal domain kinase, CDK12, regulates genome stability, expression of DNA repair genes, and cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. In addition to its role in mRNA biosynthesis of DNA repair genes, we show here that CDK12 phosphorylates the mRNA 5' cap-binding repressor, 4E-BP1, to promote translation of mTORC1-dependent mRNAs. In particular, we found that phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 by mTORC1 (T37 and T46) facilitates subsequent CDK12 phosphorylation at two Ser-Pro sites (S65 and T70) that control the exchange of 4E-BP1 with eIF4G at the 5' cap of CHK1 and other target mRNAs. RNA immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing (RIP-seq) revealed that CDK12 regulates release of 4E-BP1, and binding of eIF4G, to many mTORC1 target mRNAs, including those needed for MYC transformation. Genome-wide ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) further identified specific CDK12 "translation-only" target mRNAs, including many mTORC1 target mRNAs as well as many subunits of mitotic and centromere/centrosome complexes. Accordingly, confocal imaging analyses revealed severe chromosome misalignment, bridging, and segregation defects in cells deprived of CDK12 or CCNK. We conclude that the nuclear RNAPII-CTD kinase CDK12 cooperates with mTORC1, and controls a specialized translation network that is essential for mitotic chromosome stability.
Zika virus is an emerging mosquito-borne pathogen capable of severely damaging developing fetuses as well as causing neurological abnormalities in adults. The molecular details of how Zika virus causes pathologies that are unique among the flavivirus family remain poorly understood and have contributed to the lack of Zika antiviral therapies. To elucidate how Zika virus protease (ZVP) affects host cellular pathways and consequent pathologies, we used unbiased N-terminomics to identify 31 human proteins cleaved by the NS2B-NS3 protease. In particular, autophagy-related protein 16-1 (ATG16L1) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma 1 (eIF4G1) are dramatically depleted during Zika virus infection. ATG16L1 and eIF4G1 mediate type-II interferon production and host-cell translation, respectively, likely aiding immune system evasion and driving the Zika life cycle. Intriguingly, the NS2B cofactor region from Zika virus protease is essential for recognition of host cell substrates. Replacing the NS2B region in another flavivirus protease enabled recognition of novel Zika-specific substrates by hybrid proteases, suggesting that the cofactor is the principal determinant in ZVP substrate selection.
To determine whether 2A protease of the enterovirus genus with type I internal ribosome entry site (IRES) effect on the viral replication of type II IRES, coxsackievirus B3(CVB3)-encoded protease 2A and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) IRES (Type II)-dependent or cap-dependent report gene were transiently co-expressed in eukaryotic cells. We found that CVB3 2A protease not only inhibited translation of cap-dependent reporter genes through the cleavage of eIF4GI, but also conferred high EMCV IRES-dependent translation ability and promoted EMCV replication. Moreover, deletions of short motif (aa13-18 RVVNRH, aa65-70 KNKHYP, or aa88-93 PRRYQSH) resembling the nuclear localization signals (NLS) or COOH-terminal acidic amino acid motif (aa133-147 DIRDLLWLEDDAMEQ) of CVB3 2A protease decreased both its EMCV IRES-dependent translation efficiency and destroy its cleavage on eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) I. Our results may provide better understanding into more effective interventions and treatments for co-infection of viral diseases. 
Initiation of translation on Type II IRESs, such as those of EMCV and FMDV viruses, has been well documented in the recent years. For EMCV, the current model argues for a mechanism in which the key interaction necessary for the pre-initiation complex recruitment is eIF4G binding to the central J-K domains of EMCV-IRES. Here we demonstrate that, in contrast with the current model, the molecular mechanism of EMCV-IRES involves direct recruitment of the 40S subunit. Importantly, we identified a specific structural element that prevents the correct positioning of the initiation codon in the close vicinity of the ribosomal P site. This work clarifies how this interaction could not be anticipated by earlier studies and allows us to propose a new model for initiation complex assembly on EMCV-IRES. The role attributed to eIF4G/4A can thus be refined as stabilizing/promoting the conformational changes that are necessary for IRES function, thus resembling the role conventionally assigned to ITAFs. This raises the interesting possibility that IRESs are primarily ribosome binders, some of which having partly lost the ability to fold into the active structure without the help of proteins. 
DEAF1 is a transcriptional regulator associated with autoimmune and neurological disorders and is known to bind TTCG motifs. To further ascertain preferred DEAF1 DNA ligands, we screened a random oligonucleotide library containing an "anchored" CpG motif. We identified a binding consensus that generally conformed to a repeated TTCGGG motif, with the two invariant CpG dinucleotides separated by 6-11 nucleotides. Alteration of the consensus surrounding the dual CpG dinucleotides, or cytosine methylation of a single CpG half-site, eliminated DEAF1 binding. A sequence within the Htr1a promoter that resembles the binding consensus but contains a single CpG motif was confirmed to have low affinity binding with DEAF1. A DEAF1 binding consensus was identified in the EIF4G3 promoter and ChIP assay showed endogenous DEAF1 was bound to the region. We conclude that DEAF1 preferentially binds variably spaced and unmethylated CpG-containing half-sites when they occur within an appropriate consensus. 
The broadly used antiviral cytokine interferon-Œ± (IFNŒ±)'s mechanisms of action against HCV infection are not well understood. We previously identified SART1, a host protein involved in RNA splicing and pre-mRNA processing, as a regulator of IFN's antiviral effects. We hypothesized that SART1 regulates antiviral IFN effector genes (IEGs) through mRNA processing and splicing.
We performed siRNA knockdown in HuH7.5.1 cells and mRNA-sequencing with or without IFN treatment. Selected gene mRNA variants and their proteins, together with HCV replication, were monitored by qRT-PCR and Western blot in HCV OR6 replicon cells and the JFH1 HCV infectious model.
We identified 419 genes with a greater than 2-fold expression difference between Neg siRNA and SART1 siRNA treated cells in the presence or absence of IFN. Bioinformatic analysis identified at least 10 functional pathways. SART1 knockdown reduced classical IFN stimulating genes (ISG) mRNA transcription including MX1 and OAS3. However, SART1 did not affect JAK-STAT pathway gene mRNA expression and IFN stimulated response element (ISRE) signaling. We identified alternative mRNA splicing events for several genes, including EIF4G3, GORASP2, ZFAND6, and RAB6A that contribute to their antiviral effects. EIF4G3 and GORASP2 were also confirmed to have anti-HCV effect.
The spliceosome factor SART1 is not IFN-inducible but is an IEG. SART1 exerts its anti-HCV action through direct transcriptional regulation for some ISGs and alternative splicing for others, including EIF4G3, GORASP2. SART1 does not have an effect on IFN receptor or canonical signal transduction components. Thus, SART1 regulates ISGs using a novel, non-classical mechanism.
The eukaryotic eIF4F complex, the cap binding complex, functions during translation initiation through interactions mediated by its three subunits (eIF4E, eIF4G and eIF4A), other initiation factors and the ribosome. In trypanosomatids, various eIF4E and eIF4G homologues were identified, with two eIF4F-like complexes confirmed (EIF4E4/EIF4G3/EIF4AI and EIF4E3/EIF4G4/EIF4AI). Here, the expression pattern of these complexes was investigated during Leishmania amazonensis and Trypanosoma brucei growth. The two sets of eIF4E and eIF4G homologues were found represented by phosphorylated isoforms with multiple phosphorylation events targeting the two eIF4E homologues. Expression of these multiple isoforms was differentially affected by inhibitors of mRNA synthesis/processing and translation. Phosphorylated EIF4E4 was consistently associated with early/active growth phases in both organisms studied. In T. brucei phosphorylation of both EIF4E3 and 4, overexpressed as HA-tagged fusions, was partially mapped to their N-terminuses. Our results indicate that phosphorylation is associated with a further layer of complexity in translation initiation in trypanosomatids. 
The number of paralogs of proteins involved in translation initiation is larger in trypanosomes than in yeasts or many metazoan and includes two poly(A) binding proteins, PABP1 and PABP2, and four eIF4E variants. In many cases, the paralogs are individually essential and are thus unlikely to have redundant functions although, as yet, distinct functions of different isoforms have not been determined. Here, trypanosome PABP1 and PABP2 have been further characterised. PABP1 and PABP2 diverged subsequent to the differentiation of the Kinetoplastae lineage, supporting the existence of specific aspects of translation initiation regulation. PABP1 and PABP2 exhibit major differences in intracellular localization and distribution on polysome fractionation under various conditions that interfere with mRNA metabolism. Most striking are differences in localization to the four known types of inducible RNP granules. Moreover, only PABP2 but not PABP1 can accumulate in the nucleus. Taken together, these observations indicate that PABP1 and PABP2 likely associate with distinct populations of mRNAs. The differences in localization to inducible RNP granules also apply to paralogs of components of the eIF4F complex: eIF4E1 showed similar localization pattern to PABP2, whereas the localisation of eIF4E4 and eIF4G3 resembled that of PABP1. The grouping of translation initiation as either colocalizing with PABP1 or with PABP2 can be used to complement interaction studies to further define the translation initiation complexes in kinetoplastids.
Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are the major killer of virus-infected cells. Granzyme B (GrB) from CTLs induces apoptosis in target cells by cleavage and activation of substrates like caspase-3 and Bid. However, while undergoing apoptosis, cells are still capable of producing infectious viruses unless a mechanism exists to specifically inhibit viral production. Using proteomic approaches, we identified a novel GrB target that plays a major role in protein synthesis: eukaryotic initiation factor 4 gamma 3 (eIF4G3). We hypothesized a novel role for GrB in translation of viral proteins by targeting eIF4G3, and showed that GrB cleaves eIF4G3 specifically at the IESD(1408)S sequence. Both GrB and human CTL treatment resulted in degradation of eIF4G3 and reduced rates of translation. When Jurkat cells infected with vaccinia virus were treated with GrB, there was a halt in viral protein synthesis and a decrease in production of infectious new virions. The GrB-induced inhibition of viral translation was independent of the activation of caspases, as inhibition of protein synthesis still occurred with addition of the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk. This demonstrated for the first time that GrB prevents the production of infectious vaccinia virus by targeting the host translational machinery.
We mapped six genes (EIF4G3, HSP90, RBBP6, IL8, TERT, and TERC) on the chromosomes of Equus caballus, Equus asinus, Equus grevyi, and Equus burchelli by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Our results add six type I markers to the cytogenetic map of these species and provide new information on the comparative genomics of the genus Equus.
In eukaryotes, it is generally assumed that translation initiation occurs at the AUG codon closest to the messenger RNA 5' cap. However, in certain cases, initiation can occur at codons differing from AUG by a single nucleotide, especially the codons CUG, UUG, GUG, ACG, AUA and AUU. While non-AUG initiation has been experimentally verified for a handful of human genes, the full extent to which this phenomenon is utilized--both for increased coding capacity and potentially also for novel regulatory mechanisms--remains unclear. To address this issue, and hence to improve the quality of existing coding sequence annotations, we developed a methodology based on phylogenetic analysis of predicted 5' untranslated regions from orthologous genes. We use evolutionary signatures of protein-coding sequences as an indicator of translation initiation upstream of annotated coding sequences. Our search identified novel conserved potential non-AUG-initiated N-terminal extensions in 42 human genes including VANGL2, FGFR1, KCNN4, TRPV6, HDGF, CITED2, EIF4G3 and NTF3, and also affirmed the conservation of known non-AUG-initiated extensions in 17 other genes. In several instances, we have been able to obtain independent experimental evidence of the expression of non-AUG-initiated products from the previously published literature and ribosome profiling data.
DREAM/KChIP-3 is a calcium-dependent transcriptional repressor highly expressed in immune cells. Transgenic mice expressing a dominant active DREAM mutant show reduced serum Ig levels. In vitro assays show that reduced Ig secretion is an intrinsic defect of transgenic B cells that occurs without impairment in plasma cell differentiation, class switch recombination, or Ig transcription. Surprisingly, transgenic B cells show an accelerated entry in cell division. Transcriptomic analysis of transgenic B cells revealed that hyperproliferative B cell response could be correlated with a reduced expression of Klf9, a cell-cycle regulator. Pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that the defect in Ig production is associated with reduced translation rather than with increased protein degradation. Importantly, transgenic B cells showed reduced expression of the Eif4g3 gene, which encodes a protein related to protein translation. Our results disclose, to our knowledge, a novel function of DREAM in proliferation and Ig synthesis in B lymphocytes.
The ENU-induced repro8 mutation was identified in a screen to uncover genes that control mouse gametogenesis. repro8 causes male-limited infertility, with failure of spermatocytes to exit meiotic prophase via the G2/MI transition. The repro8 mutation is in the Eif4g3 gene, encoding eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4, gamma 3. Mutant germ cells appear to execute events of meiotic prophase normally, and many proteins characteristic of the prophase-to-metaphase transition are not obviously depleted. However, activity of CDC2A (CDK1) kinase is dramatically reduced in mutant spermatocytes. Strikingly, HSPA2, a chaperone protein for CDC2A kinase, is absent in mutant spermatocytes in spite of the presence of Hspa2 transcript, consistent with the observation that the repro8 phenotype is markedly similar to the phenotype of the Hspa2 knockout. Thus, EIF4G3 is required for HSPA2 translation in spermatocytes, a finding that provides the first genetic evidence for selective translational control of meiotic exit in mammalian spermatocytes.
Dengue virus (DV)-induced changes in the host cell protein synthesis machinery are not well understood. We investigated the transcriptional changes related to initiation of protein synthesis. The human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, was infected with DV serotype 2 for 1 h at a multiplicity of infection of one. RNA was extracted after 6, 24 and 48 h. Microarray results showed that 36.5% of the translation factors related to initiation of protein synthesis had significant differential expression (Z-score &gt;or= +/-2.0). Confirmation was obtained by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Of the genes involved in the activation of mRNA for cap-dependent translation (eIF4 factors), eIF4A, eIF4G1 and eIF4B were up-regulated while the negative regulator of translation eIF4E-BP3 was down-regulated. This activation was transient since at 24 h post-infection levels were not significantly different from control cells. However, at 48 h post-infection, eIF4A, eIF4E, eIF4G1, eIF4G3, eIF4B, and eIF4E-BP3 were down-regulated, suggesting that cap-dependent translation could be inhibited during the progression of infection. To test this hypothesis, phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4E-BP1, which induce cap-dependent protein synthesis, was assayed. Both proteins remained phosphorylated when assayed at 6 h after infection, while infection induced dephosphorylation of p70S6K and 4E-BP1 at 24 and 48 h of infection, respectively. Taken together, these results provide biological evidence suggesting that in HepG2 cells DV sustains activation of the cap-dependent machinery at early stages of infection, but progression of infection switches protein synthesis to a cap-independent process.
The knowledge of molecular mechanisms of stress response in athlete horses can allow us to plan an appropriate and high-grade training to obtain better performance and to preserve horse welfare. It is well known that excessive muscular exercise can lead to a number of responses which may be associated with modification of the mRNA levels for a number of metabolic genes such as those involved in the immune response. In the present study cDNA-AFLP technique was applied to Arab endurance horses under stressing conditions to visualise variations of transcriptional profiles; 49 transcript derived fragments (TDFs), differentially expressed, were cloned and sequenced. Four of these showed high sequence similarity with genes probably involved in exercise-induced stress response and resulted to be not sequenced in the horse. Their modulation was confirmed by RT-PCR and the full-length transcripts were isolated by RACE-PCR. The mRNAs sequences obtained were included in the GenBank database as Equus caballus interleukin 8 (IL8), E. caballus retinoblastoma binding protein 6 mRNA (RBBP6), E. caballus eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma 3 (eIF4G3) and E. caballus heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). The expression pattern of these genes was verified in other endurance horses under stressing conditions, strengthening the hypothesis of their real involvement in exercise stress-induced response.
Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (EIF4G) is an important scaffold protein in the translation initiation complex. In mice, mutation of the Eif4g3 gene causes male infertility, with arrest of meiosis at the end of meiotic prophase. This study documents features of the developmental expression and subcellular localization of EIF4G3 that might contribute to its highly specific role in meiosis and spermatogenesis. Quite unexpectedly, EIF4G3 is located in the nucleus of spermatocytes, where it is highly enriched in the XY body, the chromatin domain formed by the transcriptionally inactive sex chromosomes. Moreover, many other, but not all, translation-related proteins are also localized in the XY body. These unanticipated observations implicate roles for the XY body in controlling mRNA metabolism and/or "poising" protein translation complexes before the meiotic division phase in spermatocytes.
The transcription factor FOXJ3 (Forkhead box J3) is highly expressed in spermatogonia and meiotic spermatocytes within mouse testes. Here, we addressed how FOXJ3 might participate in spermatogenesis using two conditional knockout mouse models in which Foxj3 was deleted from either spermatogonia or meiotic spermatocytes. Both models exhibited complete male sterility, but distinct etiologies: Deleting FOXJ3 from spermatogonia using Foxj3flox/flox , Mvh-Cre mice caused Sertoli-cell-only syndrome in males. Foxj3-deficient spermatogonia were lost as early as postnatal Day 4, partially due to the accumulation of DNA double-stranded breaks. In contrast, loss of FOXJ3 in spermatocytes using Foxj3flox/flox , Stra8-Cre mice led to meiotic arrest. Indeed, the mRNA abundance of meiotic arrest-related proteins (Rad51, Dmc1, Brca1, Brca2, Brit1, Eif4g3, Hop2, Hormad1, and Rnf212) was significantly reduced in Foxj3flox/flox , Stra8-Cre spermatocytes. Thus, we conclude that FOXJ3 is required for the survival of spermatogonia and participates in spermatocyte meiosis. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 83: 1060-1069, 2016. ¬© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) plays a pivotal role in the control of cap-dependent translation initiation, modulates the fate of specific mRNAs, occurs in processing bodies (PBs) and is required for formation of stress granules (SGs). In this study, we focused on the subcellular localization of a representative compendium of eIF4E protein isoforms, particularly on the less studied members of the human eIF4E protein family, eIF4E2 and eIF4E3.
We showed that unlike eIF4E1, its less studied isoform eIF4E3_A, encoded by human chromosome 3, localized to stress granules but not PBs upon both heat shock and arsenite stress. Furthermore, we found that eIF4E3_A interacts with human translation initiation factors eIF4G1, eIF4G3 and PABP1 in vivo and sediments into the same fractions as canonical eIF4E1 during polysome analysis in sucrose gradients. Contrary to this finding, the truncated human eIF4E3 isoform, eIF4E3_B, showed no localization to SGs and no binding to eIF4G. We also highlighted that eIF4E2 may exhibit distinct functions under different stresses as it readily localizes to P-bodies during arsenite and heat stresses, whereas it is redirected to stress granules only upon heat shock. We extended our study to a number of protein variants, arising from alternative mRNA splicing, of each of the three eIF4E isoforms. Our results surprisingly uncovered differences in the ability of eIF4E1_1 and eIF4E1_3 to form stress granules in response to cellular stresses.
Our comparison of all three human eIF4E isoforms and their protein variants enriches the intriguing spectrum of roles attributed to the eukaryotic initiation translation factors of the 4E family, which exhibit a distinctive localization within different RNA granules under different stresses. The localization of eIF4E3_A to stress granules, but not to processing bodies, along with its binding to eIF4G and PABP1 suggests a role of human eIF4E3_A in translation initiation rather than its involvement in a translational repression and mRNA decay and turnover. The localization of eIF4E2 to stress granules under heat shock but not arsenite stress indicates its distinct function in cellular response to these stresses and points to the variable protein content of SGs as a consequence of different stress insults.
Spermatogenesis is a highly complex cell differentiation process necessary for production of haploid spermatozoa. Central to this unique process is spermatocyte meiosis. FOXJ2 (Forkhead box J2), a FOX transcription factor, is specifically expressed in meiotic spermatocytes in adult mouse testes, so we used a germ cell specific conditional knockout model (Foxj2(flox/flox) , Mvh-Cre) to explore its role in spermatogenesis. Loss of FOXJ2 in the male germ line led to meiotic arrest and complete infertility. Although, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) were initiated, Foxj2-deficient spermatocytes failed to form chromosomal synapses and perform DSB repair. Furthermore, Foxj2-deficient spermatocytes contained significantly less mRNA encoding DSB repair-associated factors (Rad18, Rad51, Brca1, Brca2, and Tex15) and meiotic arrest-related proteins (Fzr1, Hsp70-2, Spata22, Eif4g3, and Zpac); in contrast, no change was observed in the expression of spermatogonia markers (Gfra1, Zbtb16, and c-Kit) and germ cell markers (Dazl, Mvh, and Tra98). Taken together, FOXJ2 appears to promote meiotic progression in male mice by a mechanism that needs further investigation. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 83: 684-691, 2016 ¬© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) has become essentially synonymous with 5' cap-dependent mRNA translation. Recent studies demonstrate that cells assemble variants of eIF4F to produce adaptive, cap-dependent translatomes during physiological conditions that inhibit eIF4F. These findings challenge us to reassess classical perceptions of cellular translational pathways.
We report here the results of experiments designed to identify RNA-binding proteins that might be associated with Trypanosoma brucei polysomes. After some preliminary mass spectrometry of polysomal fractions, we investigated the distributions of selected tagged proteins using sucrose gradients and immunofluorescence. As expected, the polysomal fractions contained nearly all annotated ribosomal proteins, the translation-associated protein folding complex, and many translation factors, but also many other abundant proteins. Results suggested that cap-binding proteins EIF4E3 and EIF4E4 were associated with both free and membrane-bound polysomes. The EIF4E binding partners EIF4G4 and EIF4G3 were present but the other EIF4E and EIF4G paralogues were not detected. The dominant EIF4E in the polysomal fraction is EIF4E4 and very few polysomal mRNAs are associated with EIF4G. Thirteen potential mRNA-binding proteins were detected in the polysomes, including the known polysome-associated protein RBP42. The locations of two of the other proteins were tested after epitope tagging: RBP29 was in the nucleus and ZC3H29 was in the cytoplasm. Quantitative analyses showed that specific association of an RNA-binding protein with the polysome fraction in sucrose gradients will not be detected if the protein is in more than 25-fold molar excess over its target binding sites. 
To investigate the effect of different DEAF1 variants on the phenotype of patients with autosomal dominant and recessive inheritance patterns and on DEAF1 activity in vitro.
We assembled a cohort of 23 patients with de novo and biallelic DEAF1 variants, described the genotype-phenotype correlation, and investigated the differential effect of de novo and recessive variants on transcription assays using DEAF1 and Eif4g3 promoter luciferase constructs.
The proportion of the most prevalent phenotypic features, including intellectual disability, speech delay, motor delay, autism, sleep disturbances, and a high pain threshold, were not significantly different in patients with biallelic and pathogenic de novo DEAF1 variants. However, microcephaly was exclusively observed in patients with recessive variants (p‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.0001).
We propose that different variants in the DEAF1 gene result in a phenotypic spectrum centered around neurodevelopmental delay. While a pathogenic de novo dominant variant would also incapacitate the product of the wild-type allele and result in a dominant-negative effect, a combination of two recessive variants would result in a partial loss of function. Because the clinical picture can be nonspecific, detailed phenotype information, segregation, and functional analysis are fundamental to determine the pathogenicity of novel variants and to improve the care of these patients.
Protein translation in eukaryotes is cell-cycle dependent, with translation rates more robust in G1 phase of the cell cycle than in mitosis. However, whether the fundamental cell-cycle control machinery directly activates protein translation during the G1/S cell-cycle transition remains unknown. Using the early divergent eukaryote Trypanosoma brucei as a model organism, we report that the G1 cyclin-dependent kinase CRK1 phosphorylates two translation initiation factors, eIF4E4 and PABP1, to promote the G1/S cell-cycle transition and global protein translation. Phosphorylation of eIF4E4 by CRK1 enhances binding to the m7G cap structure and interaction with eIF4E4 and eIF4G3, and phosphorylation of PABP1 by CRK1 promotes association with the poly(A) sequence, self-interaction, and interaction with eIF4E4. These findings demonstrate that cyclin-dependent kinase-mediated regulation of translation initiation factors couples global protein translation with the G1/S cell-cycle transition.
Trans-splicing of trypanosomatid polycistronic transcripts produces polyadenylated monocistronic mRNAs modified to form the 5' cap4 structure (m7Gpppm36,6,2'Apm2'Apm2'Cpm23,2'U). NMR and X-ray crystallography reveal that Leishmania has a unique type of N-terminally-extended cap-binding protein (eIF4E4) that binds via a PAM2 motif to PABP1. This relies on the interactions of a combination of polar and charged amino acid side-chains together with multiple hydrophobic interactions, and underpins a novel architecture in the Leishmania cap4-binding translation factor complex. Measurements using microscale thermophoresis, fluorescence anisotropy and surface plasmon resonance characterize the key interactions driving assembly of the Leishmania translation initiation complex. We demonstrate that this complex can accommodate Leishmania eIF4G3 which, unlike the standard eukaryotic initiation complex paradigm, binds tightly to eIF4E4, but not to PABP1. Thus, in Leishmania, the chain of interactions 5'cap4-eIF4E4-PABP1-poly(A) bridges the mRNA 5' and 3' ends. Exceptionally, therefore, by binding tightly to two protein ligands and to the mRNA 5' cap4 structure, the trypanosomatid N-terminally extended form of eIF4E acts as the core molecular scaffold for the mRNA-cap-binding complex. Finally, the eIF4E4 N-terminal extension is an intrinsically disordered region that transitions to a partly folded form upon binding to PABP1, whereby this interaction is not modulated by poly(A) binding to PABP1.
Sentinel lymph node biopsy is the standard surgical staging approach for operable triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) with clinically negative axillae. In this study, we sought to develop a model to predict TNBC patients with negative nodal involvement, who would benefit from the exemption of the axillary staging surgery.
We evaluated 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) profiles using microarray data of TNBC from two Gene Expression Omnibus datasets. Samples from GSE31519 were divided into training set (n = 164) and validation set (n = 163), and GSE76275 was used to construct testing set (n = 164). We built a six-member 3'UTR panel (ADD2, COL1A1, APOL2, IL21R, PKP2, and EIF4G3) using an elastic net model to estimate the risk of lymph node metastasis (LNM). Receiver operating characteristic and logistic analyses were used to assess the association between the panel and LNM status.
The six-member 3'UTR-panel showed a high distinguishing power with an area under the curve of 0.712, 0.729, and 0.708 in the training, validation, and testing sets, respectively. After adjustment by tumor size, the 3'UTR panel retained significant predictive power in the training, validation, and testing sets (odds ratio = 4.93, 4.58, and 3.59, respectively; p &lt; .05 for all). A combinatorial analysis of the 3'UTR panel and tumor size yielded an accuracy of 97.2%, 100%, and 100% in training, validation, and testing set, respectively.
This study established an integrative 3'UTR-based model as a promising predictor for nodal negativity in operable TNBC. Although a prospective study is needed to validate the model, our results may permit a no axillary surgery option for selected patients.
Currently, sentinel lymph node biopsy is the standard approach for surgical staging in breast cancer patients with negative axillae. Prediction estimation for lymph node metastasis of breast cancer relies on clinicopathological characteristics, which is unreliable, especially in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)-a highly heterogeneous disease. The authors developed and validated an effective prediction model for the lymph node status of patients with TNBC, which integrates 3'UTR markers and tumor size. This is the first 3'UTR-based model that will help identify TNBC patients with low risk of nodal involvement who are most likely to benefit from exemption axillary surgery.
Poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) regulate mRNA fate by controlling stability and translation through interactions with both the poly(A) tail and eIF4F complex. Many organisms have several paralogs of PABPs and eIF4F complex components and it is likely that different eIF4F/PABP complex combinations regulate distinct sets of mRNAs. Trypanosomes have five eIF4G paralogs, six of eIF4E and two PABPs, PABP1 and PABP2. Under starvation, polysomes dissociate and the majority of mRNAs, most translation initiation factors and PABP2 reversibly localise to starvation stress granules. To understand this more broadly we identified a protein interaction cohort for both T. brucei PABPs by cryo-mill/affinity purification-mass spectrometry. PABP1 very specifically interacts with the previously identified interactors eIF4E4 and eIF4G3 and few others. In contrast PABP2 is promiscuous, with a larger set of interactors including most translation initiation factors and most prominently eIF4G1, with its two partners TbG1-IP and TbG1-IP2. Only RBP23 was specific to PABP1, whilst 14 RNA-binding proteins were exclusively immunoprecipitated with PABP2. Significantly, PABP1 and associated proteins are largely excluded from starvation stress granules, but PABP2 and most interactors translocate to granules on starvation. We suggest that PABP1 regulates a small subpopulation of mainly small-sized mRNAs, as it interacts with a small and distinct set of proteins unable to enter the dominant pathway into starvation stress granules and localises preferentially to a subfraction of small polysomes. By contrast PABP2 likely regulates bulk mRNA translation, as it interacts with a wide range of proteins, enters stress granules and distributes over the full range of polysomes.
The Poly-A Binding Protein (PABP) is a conserved eukaryotic polypeptide involved in many aspects of mRNA metabolism. During translation initiation, PABP interacts with the translation initiation complex eIF4F and enhances the translation of polyadenylated mRNAs. Schematically, most PABPs can be divided into an N-terminal RNA-binding region, a non-conserved linker segment and the C-terminal MLLE domain. In pathogenic Leishmania protozoans, three PABP homologues have been identified, with the first one (PABP1) targeted by phosphorylation and shown to co-immunoprecipitate with an eIF4F-like complex (EIF4E4/EIF4G3) implicated in translation initiation. Here, PABP1 phosphorylation was shown to be linked to logarithmic cell growth, reminiscent of EIF4E4 phosphorylation, and coincides with polysomal association. Phosphorylation targets multiple serine-proline (SP) or threonine-proline (TP) residues within the PABP1 linker region. This is an essential protein, but phosphorylation is not needed for its association with polysomes or cell viability. Mutations which do impair PABP1 polysomal association and are required for viability do not prevent phosphorylation, although further mutations lead to a presumed inactive protein largely lacking phosphorylated isoforms. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out to investigate PABP1 function further, identifying several novel protein partners and the EIF4E4/EIF4G3 complex, but no other eIF4F-like complex or subunit. A novel, direct interaction between PABP1 and EIF4E4 was also investigated and found to be mediated by the PABP1 MLLE binding to PABP Interacting Motifs (PAM2) within the EIF4E4 N-terminus. The results shown here are consistent with phosphorylation of PABP1 being part of a novel pathway controlling its function and possibly translation in Leishmania.
Metabolic homeostasis of amino acids is essential for human health. Here, we aimed to investigate a potential role for the clock component Rev-erbŒ± in circadian regulation of amino acid metabolism. RNA-seq with Rev-erbŒ±-/- mice showed expression changes in genes involved in amino acid metabolism, particularly, the urea cycle and methionine metabolism. Rev-erbŒ± ablation increased hepatic mRNA, protein, and enzymatic activity of Bhmt, Cbs and Cth, and decreased the levels of plasma and liver homocysteine in mice. Cell-based assays confirmed negative regulation of these three genes by Rev-erbŒ±. Combined luciferase reporter, mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays identified Rev-erbŒ± as a transcriptional repressor of Bhmt, Cbs and Cth. Rev-erbŒ± ablation or antagonism alleviated chemical-induced hyperhomocysteinemia in mice. This was accompanied by elevated expressions of Bhmt, Cbs and Cth. Moreover, Rev-erbŒ± ablation or antagonism promoted urea production and ammonia clearance. Of urea cycle related genes, Arg1, Otc and Cps1 expressions were up-regulated in Rev-erbŒ±-/- mice. Negative regulation of these urea cycle genes by Rev-erbŒ± was validated using cell-based experiments. Mechanistic studies revealed that Rev-erbŒ± inhibited C/EBPŒ± transactivation to repress the transcription of Arg1, Cps1 and Otc. Conclusion Rev-erbŒ± antagonism alleviates hyperhomocysteinemia and promotes ammonia clearance. Targeting Rev-erbŒ± represents a novel approach for management of homocysteine and ammonia related diseases. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
We introduce the indications, technique, results of our experience using donor's RGEA as interposition vessel to solve hepatic artery reconstruction problems in P-LDLT.
A retrospective analysis of P-LDLT for children with metabolic diseases from June 2013 to November 2018 in our center was carried out. The arterial conditions, reconstruction methods, and prognosis were analyzed.
A total of 73 children with metabolic diseases underwent P-LDLT during the period. The LLF was the main graft, accounting for 71.2%. The donor's RGEA was utilized in five cases. There were three children with OTCD and two children with deficiency of CPS1 and MSUD, respectively. In three cases, the grafts' left hepatic arteries were anastomosed with the recipients' PHA using donors' RGEA as interposition vessel. In other two cases, the donors' RGEA was interposed between graft's MHA and the recipient's bifurcation of PHA and GDA. The average follow-up time was 19.7¬†¬±¬†15.9¬†month. There were two cases of artery thrombosis or occlusion, and the incidence was 2.7%. No arterial complications occurred in children using RGEA (follow-up time 5.0¬†¬±¬†3.4¬†months).
In P-LDLT for patients with metabolic diseases, the application of RGEA as an interposition vessel can solve caliber mismatch and short arteries problem and achieve good results. Compared with traditional arterial anastomosis, it may reduce the incidence of arterial complications.
The urea cycle converts toxic ammonia to urea within the liver of mammals. At least 6 enzymes are required for ureagenesis, which correlates with dietary protein intake. The transcription of urea cycle genes is, at least in part, regulated by glucocorticoid and glucagon hormone signaling pathways. N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) produces a unique cofactor, N-acetylglutamate (NAG), that is essential for the catalytic function of the first and rate-limiting enzyme of ureagenesis, carbamyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1). However, despite the important role of NAGS in ammonia removal, little is known about the mechanisms of its regulation. We identified two regions of high conservation upstream of the translation start of the NAGS gene. Reporter assays confirmed that these regions represent promoter and enhancer and that the enhancer is tissue specific. Within the promoter, we identified multiple transcription start sites that differed between liver and small intestine. Several transcription factor binding motifs were conserved within the promoter and enhancer regions while a TATA-box motif was absent. DNA-protein pull-down assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed binding of Sp1 and CREB, but not C/EBP in the promoter and HNF-1 and NF-Y, but not SMAD3 or AP-2 in the enhancer. The functional importance of these motifs was demonstrated by decreased transcription of reporter constructs following mutagenesis of each motif. The presented data strongly suggest that Sp1, CREB, HNF-1, and NF-Y, that are known to be responsive to hormones and diet, regulate NAGS transcription. This provides molecular mechanism of regulation of ureagenesis in response to hormonal and dietary changes.
Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a lysosomal storage disorder with severe prognosis. Disease-specific therapy is crucial to prevent disease progression; however, diagnosing NPC is quite difficult because of remarkably variable clinical presentations. The NPC Suspicion Index (NPC-SI) was developed to overcome this problem. Identifying preclinical cases is important for prevention and therapy. Here, we report three newly diagnosed NPC cases, one typical juvenile-onset case and the cases of two sisters with symptoms neurologically/psychiatrically indistinguishable from dystonia and schizophrenia, respectively.
In Case 1, a 25-year-old man presented with a 14-year history of intellectual disability, clumsiness, spastic ataxia, dysphagia, and frequent falls. Neurological examination revealed vertical supranuclear gaze palsy and involuntary movements. Ultrasonography revealed mild splenomegaly, and filipin staining of skin fibroblasts was positive with a variant staining pattern. NPC1 gene analysis showed compound heterozygous mutations, including c.1421C‚Äâ&gt;‚ÄâT (p.P474L), a known causative mutation, and c.3722¬†T‚Äâ&gt;‚ÄâC (p.L1241S), a new mutation. In Case 2, a 28-year-old woman, the proband, who had marked splenomegaly in her childhood, survived well, contrary to the expected severe prognosis of infantile NPC. She had minor neuropsychiatric symptoms including auditory hallucinations, nocturnal urination, and sleep paralysis. At the age of 28¬†years, she presented with a 1-year history of orofacial and oromandibular painful dystonia. The patient's 35-year-old sister (Case 3) was diagnosed with schizophrenia. In both cases, filipin staining of skin fibroblasts was positive with variant staining patterns, as well as elevated levels of urinary bile acids. NPC1 gene analysis showed compound heterozygous mutations including c.3011C‚Äâ&gt;‚ÄâT (p.S1004¬†L), a known causative mutation, and c.160_161insG (p.D54GfsX4), a new mutation. Their mother, who was under therapy with modafinil for narcolepsy, shared the latter mutation.
Marked clinical variability was observed in our three cases. NPC could masquerade as a pure neuropsychiatric disorder such as dystonia or schizophrenia. Abdominal ultrasonography, history evaluation, and neurological examination were quite important in the diagnostic process.
Hypercholesterolaemia has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. In this work, we tested whether cholesterol-mediated neurodegeneration induced either by cholesterol-rich diet or genetic mutation may share a common mechanism involving increased oxidative stress and mitochondria oxidant status. Additionally, we analysed whether upon cholesterol-rich diet, different brain regions (prefrontal cortex, cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum) show distinct vulnerability to an oxidative stress response.
Oxidative stress parameters were measured both in vivo (in the liver and in different brain regions) in cholesterol-fed mice and in vitro in genetically induced cholesterol accumulation in NPC1-null cells.
Increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was a common feature of cholesterol-mediated antioxidant response in both models. Moreover, upon high-cholesterol diet, all four brain regions analysed responded via somewhat different capacity of antioxidant defence, hippocampus showing the highest basal activity of SOD. Increased activity of SOD upon cholesterol accumulation in vitro involves mitochondrial SOD2. We found that SOD/SOD2 activities are modulated by cholesterol levels.
Hypercholesterolaemia could potentiate brain dysfunction and neurodegenerative processes via oxidative stress, and activity of mitochondrial SOD2 may play a key role in this process. Our findings suggest that preventing/reducing mitochondrial oxidative stress may represent a common approach against neurodegenerative diseases.
Niemann-Pick type C2 (NPC2) is a lysosome luminal protein that functions in concert with NPC1 to mediate egress of low-density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol from lysosome. The nuclear factor kappa B subunit 2 (NF-Œ∫B2) protein is a component of NF-Œ∫B transcription factor complex critically implicated in immune and inflammatory responses. Here, we report that NF-Œ∫B2 regulates intracellular cholesterol transport by controlling NPC2 expression. RNAi-mediated disruption of NF-Œ∫B2, as well as other signaling members of the non-canonical NF-Œ∫B pathway, caused intracellular cholesterol accumulation. Blockage of the non-canonical NF-Œ∫B pathway suppressed NPC2 expression, whereas Lymphotoxin Œ≤ receptor (LTŒ≤R) activation or Baff receptor (BaffR) stimulation up-regulated the mRNA abundance and protein level of NPC2. Further, NF-Œ∫B2 activated NPC2 transcription through direct binding to its promoter region. We also observed cholesterol accumulation in NF-Œ∫B2-deficient zebrafish embryo and NF-Œ∫B2 mutant mice. Collectively, these data identify a regulatory role for the non-canonical NF-Œ∫B pathway in intracellular cholesterol trafficking and suggest a link between cholesterol transport and immune system.
Cellular lipids determine membrane integrity and fluidity and are being increasingly recognized to influence immune responses. Cellular cholesterol requirements are fulfilled through biosynthesis and uptake programs. In an intricate pathway involving the lysosomal cholesterol transporter NPC1, the sterol gets unequally distributed across intracellular compartments. By using pharmacological and genetic approaches targeting NPC1, we reveal that blockade of cholesterol trafficking through the late endosome-lysosome pathway blunts NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Altered cholesterol localization at the plasma membrane (PM) in Npc1-/- cells abrogated AKT-mTOR signaling by TLR4. However, the inability to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome was traced to perturbed cholesterol trafficking to the ER but not the PM. Accordingly, acute cholesterol depletion in the ER membranes by statins abrogated casp-1 activation and IL-1Œ≤ secretion and ablated NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. By contrast, assembly and activation of the AIM2 inflammasome progressed unrestricted. Together, this study reveals ER sterol levels as a metabolic rheostat for the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.
Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a neurovisceral disorder associated with the accumulation of lipids such as cholesterol and sphingolipids. NPC is caused by either NPC1 or NPC2, which encode lysosomal proteins located at membraneous and soluble fractions, respectively. For the past decade, the oxidation products of cholesterol, such as cholestane-3Œ≤,5Œ±,6Œ≤-triol and 7-ketocholesterol, have been considered selective biomarkers for NPC. However, recent evidence has indicated numerous novel biomarkers for NPC, which raises the possibility that the diagnosis of NPC might be associated with the elevation of multiple lipid biomarkers, rather than a single biomarker. Sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC) has been suggested to be one such biomarker for NPC, in which elevated sphingomyelin is a potential precursor. Thus, we first performed a validation study of plasma SPC using LC-MS/MS. The results showed the following plasma concentrations in the NPC-affected and control individuals, respectively: 8.2‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ2.8‚ÄØnM (mean‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØSD; median, 7.0‚ÄØnM; max, 11.7‚ÄØnM; min, 5.1‚ÄØnM; n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ5) and 3.1‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ1.4‚ÄØnM (median, 2.9‚ÄØnM; max, 4.8‚ÄØnM; min, 1.5‚ÄØnM; n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ7). We further extended the study to plasma lysophingomyelin-509 for NPC, a newly reported biomarker with uncharacterized chemical nature. Based on these result with plasma SPC as a surrogate marker, the value of mean of median of plasma lysophingomyelin-509 in NPC-affected individuals elevated at 65.2 (max, 73.2; min, 26.7; n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ5). Furthermore, the efficacy of plasma SPC and lysosphingomyelin-509 as promising biomarkers for this disorder was supported by the finding that the urinary concentration of 3Œ≤-sulfooxy-7Œ≤-N-acetylglucosaminyl-5-cholen-24-oic acid, an established biomarker for NPC, was also elevated in the NPC-affected individuals. These results suggest that a novel combination of plasma biomarkers, such as SPC and/or lysophingomyelin-509, and urinary bile acid metabolite could offer a promising platform for the diagnosis of NPC.
Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), a host receptor involved in the envelope glycoprotein (GP)-mediated entry of filoviruses into cells, is believed to be a major determinant of cell susceptibility to filovirus infection. It is known that proteolytically digested Ebola virus (EBOV) GP interacts with 2 protruding loops in domain C of NPC1. Using previously published structural data and the National Center for Biotechnology Information Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) database, we identified 10 naturally occurring missense SNPs in human NPC1. To investigate whether these SNPs affect cell susceptibility to filovirus infection, we generated Vero E6 cell lines stably expressing NPC1 with SNP substitutions and compared their susceptibility to vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotyped with filovirus GPs and infectious EBOV. We found that some of the substitutions resulted in reduced susceptibility to filoviruses, as indicated by the lower titers and smaller plaque/focus sizes of the viruses. Our data suggest that human NPC1 SNPs may likely affect host susceptibility to filoviruses.
It is intriguing that a rare, inherited lysosomal storage disorder Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) shares similarities with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have previously reported an enhanced processing of Œ≤-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by Œ≤-secretase (BACE1), a key enzyme in the pathogenesis of AD, in NPC1-null cells. In this work, we characterized regional and temporal expression and processing of the recently identified BACE1 substrates seizure protein 6 (Sez6) and seizure 6-like protein (Sez6L), and APP, in NPC1-/- (NPC1) and NPC1+/+ (wt) mouse brains. We analysed 4-weeks old brains to detect the earliest changes associated with NPC, and 10-weeks of age to identify changes at terminal disease stage. Sez6 and Sez6L were selected due to their predominant cleavage by BACE1, and their potential role in synaptic function that may contribute to presentation of seizures and/or motor impairments in NPC patients. While an enhanced BACE1-cleavage of all three substrates was detected in NPC1 vs. wt-mouse brains at 4-weeks of age, at 10-weeks increased proteolysis by BACE1 was observed for Sez6L in the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of NPC1-mice. Interestingly, both APP and Sez6L were found to be expressed in Purkinje neurons and their immunostaining was lost upon Purkinje cell neurodegeneration in 10-weeks old NPC1 mice. Furthermore, in NPC1- vs. wt-mouse primary cortical neurons, both Sez6 and Sez6L showed increased punctuate staining within the endolysosomal pathway as well as increased Sez6L and BACE1-positive puncta. This indicates that a trafficking defect within the endolysosomal pathway may play a key role in enhanced BACE1-proteolysis in NPC disease. Overall, our findings suggest that enhanced proteolysis by BACE1 could be a part of NPC disease pathogenesis. Understanding the basic biology of BACE1 and the functional impact of cleavage of its substrates is important to better evaluate the therapeutic potential of BACE1 against AD and, possibly, NPC disease.
Adult-onset Niemann-Pick Type C is a rare neurogenetic lysosomal disorder, whose diagnosis is often delayed and missed because of its heterogeneous clinical presentations and rarity as well as the lack of awareness of characteristic eye findings among neurologists.
Impaired smooth pursuits, saccades, and optokinetic nystagmus in the vertical direction, with relatively normal eye movements in the horizontal direction, and ataxia features on finger chase testing, tandem walking, and gait ataxia.
Impairment of vertical eye movements in combination with ataxia, cognitive impairment, and/or psychiatric symptoms in an adult patient should always raise clinical suspicion of Niemann-Pick Type C.
Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C) is a neurovisceral lipid storage disorder. At the cellular level, the disorder is characterized by accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and glycolipids in the lysosomal/late endosomal system. NP-C is transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by mutations in either the NPC1 (95% of families) or NPC2 gene. The estimated disease incidence is 1 in 120,000 live births, but this likely represents an underestimate, as the disease may be under-diagnosed due to its highly heterogeneous presentation. Variants of adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) subunit 6 and ATPase subunit 8 (ATPase6/8) in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been reported in different types of genetic diseases including NP-C. In the present study, the blood samples of 22 Iranian patients with NP-C and 150 healthy subjects as a control group were analyzed. The DNA of the blood samples was extracted by the salting out method and analyzed for ATPase6/8 mutations using polymerase chain reaction sequencing. Sequence variations in mitochondrial genome samples were determined via the Mitomap database. Analysis of sequencing data confirmed the existence of 11 different single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in patients with NP-C1. One of the most prevalent polymorphisms was the A8860G variant, which was observed in both affected and non-affected groups and determined to have no significant association with NP-C incidence. Amongst the 11 polymorphisms, only one was identified in the ATPase8 gene, while 9 including A8860G were observed in the ATPase6 gene. Furthermore, two SNPs, G8292A and C8792A, located in the non-coding region of mtDNA and the ATPase6 gene, respectively, exhibited significantly higher prevalence rates in NP-C1 patients compared with the control group (P&lt;0.01). The present study suggests that there may be an association between mitochondrial ATPase6/8 mutations and the incidence of NP-C disease. In addition, the mitochondrial SNPs identified maybe pathogenic mutations involved in the development and prevalence of NP-C. Furthermore, these results suggest a higher occurrence of mutations in ATPase6 than in ATPase8 in NP-C patients.
Previous studies identified an adamantane dipeptide piperazine 3.47 that inhibits Ebola virus (EBOV) infection by targeting the essential receptor Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). The physicochemical properties of 3.47 limit its potential for testing in vivo. Optimization by improving potency, reducing hydrophobicity, and replacing labile moieties identified 3.47 derivatives with improved in vitro ADME properties that are also highly active against EBOV infection, including when tested in the presence of 50% normal human serum (NHS). In addition, 3A4 was identified as the major cytochrome P450 isoform that metabolizes these compounds, and accordingly, mouse microsome stability was significantly improved when tested in the presence of the CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir that is approved for clinical use as a booster of anti-HIV drugs. Oral administration of the EBOV inhibitors with ritonavir resulted in a pharmacokinetic profile that supports a b.i.d. dosing regimen for efficacy studies in mice.
Approximately 70 lysosomal storage diseases are currently known, resulting from mutations in genes encoding lysosomal enzymes and membrane proteins. Defects in lysosomal enzymes that hydrolyze sphingolipids have been relatively well studied. Gaucher disease is caused by the loss of activity of glucocerebrosidase, leading to accumulation of glucosylceramide. Gaucher disease exhibits a number of subtypes, with types 2 and 3 showing significant neuropathology. Sandhoff disease results from the defective activity of Œ≤-hexosaminidase, leading to accumulation of ganglioside GM2. Niemann-Pick type C disease is primarily caused by the loss of activity of the lysosomal membrane protein, NPC1, leading to storage of cholesterol and sphingosine. All three disorders display significant neuropathology, accompanied by neuroinflammation. It is commonly assumed that neuroinflammation is the result of infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages into the brain; for instance, cells resembling lipid-engorged macrophages ('Gaucher cells') have been observed in the brain of Gaucher disease patients. We now review the evidence that inflammatory macrophages are recruited into the brain in these diseases and then go on to provide some experimental data that, at least in the three mouse models tested, monocyte-derived macrophages do not appear to infiltrate the brain. Resident microglia, which are phenotypically distinct from infiltrating macrophages, are the only myeloid population present in significant numbers within the brain parenchyma in these authentic mouse models, even during the late symptomatic stages of disease when there is substantial neuroinflammation.

Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC) is a rare human disease, with limited effective treatment options. Most cases of NPC disease are associated with inactivating mutations of the NPC1 gene. However, cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the NPC1 pathogenesis remain poorly defined. This is partly due to the lack of a suitable animal model to monitor the disease progression. In this study, we used CRISPR to construct an NPC1-/- zebrafish model, which faithfully reproduced the cardinal pathological features of this disease. In contrast to the wild type (WT), the deletion of NPC1 alone caused significant hepatosplenomegaly, ataxia, Purkinje cell death, increased lipid storage, infertility and reduced body length and life span. Most of the NPC1-/- zebrafish died within the first month post fertilization, while the remaining specimens developed slower than the WT and died before reaching 8 months of age. Filipin-stained hepatocytes of the NPC1-/- zebrafish were clear, indicating abnormal accumulation of unesterified cholesterol. Lipid profiling showed a significant difference between NPC1-/- and WT zebrafish. An obvious accumulation of seven sphingolipids was detected in livers of NPC1-/- zebrafish. In summary, our results provide a valuable model system that could identify promising therapeutic targets and treatments for the NPC disease.
Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C) is a rare, progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in the NPC1 or the NPC2 gene. Neurocognitive deficits are common in NP-C, particularly in patients with the adolescent/adult-onset form. As a disease-specific therapy is available, it is important to distinguish clinically between the cognitive profiles in NP-C and primary dementia (e.g., early Alzheimer's disease; eAD).
In a prospective observational study, we directly compared the neurocognitive profiles of patients with confirmed NP-C (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ7) and eAD (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ15). All patients underwent neurocognitive assessment using dementia screening tests (mini-mental status examination [MMSE] and frontal assessment battery [FAB]) and an extensive battery of tests assessing verbal memory, visuoconstructive abilities, visual memory, executive functions and verbal fluency.
Overall cognitive impairment (MMSE) was significantly greater in eAD vs. NP-C (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.010). The frequency of patients classified as cognitively 'impaired' was also significantly greater in eAD vs. NP-C (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.025). Patients with NP-C showed relatively preserved verbal memory, but frequent impairment in visual memory, visuoconstruction, executive functions and in particular, verbal fluency. In the eAD group, a wider profile of more frequent and more severe neurocognitive deficits was seen, primarily featuring severe verbal and visual memory deficits along with major executive impairment. Delayed verbal memory recall was a particularly strong distinguishing factor between the two groups.
A combination of detailed yet easy-to-apply neurocognitive tests assessing verbal memory, executive functions and verbal fluency may help distinguish NP-C cases from those with primary dementia due to eAD.
Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex disease with its monogenic forms accounting for less than 10% of all cases. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) technology has been used successfully to find mutations in large families. However, because of the late onset of the disease, only small families and unrelated patients are usually available. WES conducted in such cases yields in a large number of candidate variants. There are currently a number of imperfect software tools that allow the pathogenicity of variants to be evaluated. Objectives: We analyzed 48 unrelated patients with an alleged autosomal dominant familial form of PD using WES and developed a strategy for selecting potential pathogenetically significant variants using almost all available bioinformatics resources for the analysis of exonic areas. Methods: DNA sequencing of 48 patients with excluded frequent mutations was performed using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. The possible pathogenetic significance of identified variants and their involvement in the pathogenesis of PD was assessed using SNP and Variation Suite (SVS), Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) and Rare Exome Variant Ensemble Learner (REVEL) software. Functional evaluation was performed using the Pathway Studio database. Results: A significant reduction in the search range from 7082 to 25 variants in 23 genes associated with PD or neuronal function was achieved. Eight (FXN, MFN2, MYOC, NPC1, PSEN1, RET, SCN3A and SPG7) were the most significant. Conclusions: The multistep approach developed made it possible to conduct an effective search for potential pathogenetically significant variants, presumably involved in the pathogenesis of PD. The data obtained need to be further verified experimentally.
Niemann-Pick Type C1 (NPC1) disease is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease characterized by an excessive accumulation of unesterified cholesterol in late endosomes/lysosomes. Patients with NPC1 disease show a series of symptoms in neuropathology, including a gradually increased loss of motor control and seizures. However, mechanism of the neurological manifestations in NPC1 disease is not fully understood yet. In this study, we utilized the micro-electrode array (MEA) to analyze the spontaneous extracellular electrical activity in cultivated cortical neurons of the NPC1 mutant (NPC1-/-) mouse. Our results show a decrease of the spontaneous electrical activity in NPC1-/- neuronal network when compared to wild type neurons, as indicated by the decreased spike rate, burst rate, event rate, and the increased burst period and event period. Application of 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG), a specific agonist of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors, improved the electrical activity of the NPC1-/- neuronal network, suggesting that DHPG can be used as a potential therapeutic strategy for recovery of the electrical activity in NPC1 disease.
Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is a rare lysosomal storage disease caused primarily by mutations in NPC1. NPC1 encodes the lysosomal cholesterol transport protein NPC1. The most common NPC1 mutation is a missense mutation (NPC1I1061T) that causes misfolding and rapid degradation of mutant protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. Cholesterol accumulates in enlarged lysosomes as a result of decreased levels of lysosomal NPC1I1061T protein in patient cells. There is currently no cure or FDA-approved treatment for patients. We sought to identify novel compounds that decrease lysosomal cholesterol storage in NPC1I1061T/I1061T patient fibroblasts using a high-content screen with the cholesterol dye, filipin and the lysosomal marker, LAMP1. A total of 3532 compounds were screened, including 2013 FDA-approved drugs, 327 kinase inhibitors and 760 serum metabolites. Twenty-three hits were identified that decreased both filipin and LAMP1 signals. The majority of hits (16/21) were histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, a previously described class of modifiers of NPC cholesterol storage. Of the remaining hits, the antimicrobial compound, alexidine dihydrochloride had the most potent lysosomal cholesterol-reducing activity. Subsequent analyses showed that alexidine specifically increased levels of NPC1 transcript and mature protein in both control and NPC patient cells. Although unsuitable for systemic therapy, alexidine represents a unique tool compound for further NPC studies and as a potent inducer of NPC1. Together, these findings confirm the utility of high-content image-based compound screens of NPC1 patient cells and support extending the approach into larger compound collections.
Niemann-Pick Type C (NPC) is a progressive and life limiting autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in either the NPC1 or NPC2 gene. Mutations in these genes are associated with abnormal endosomal-lysosomal trafficking, resulting in the accumulation of multiple tissue specific lipids in the lysosomes. The clinical spectrum of NPC disease ranges from a neonatal rapidly progressive fatal disorder to an adult-onset chronic neurodegenerative disease. The age of onset of the first (beyond 3¬†months of life) neurological symptom may predict the severity of the disease and determines life expectancy.NPC has an estimated incidence of ~‚Äâ1: 100,000 and the rarity of the disease translate into misdiagnosis, delayed diagnosis and barriers to good care. For these reasons, we have developed clinical guidelines that define standard of care for NPC patients, foster shared care arrangements between expert centres and family physicians, and empower patients. The information contained in these guidelines was obtained through a systematic review of the literature and the experiences of the authors in their care of patients with NPC. We adopted the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research &amp; Evaluation (AGREE II) system as method of choice for the guideline development process. We made a series of conclusive statements and scored them according to level of evidence, strengths of recommendations and expert opinions. These guidelines can inform care providers, care funders, patients and their carers of best practice of care for patients with NPC. In addition, these guidelines have identified gaps in the knowledge that must be filled by future research. It is anticipated that the implementation of these guidelines will lead to a step change in the quality of care for patients with NPC irrespective of their geographical location.
The Ebola virus (EBOV) causes severe human infection that lacks effective treatment. A recent screen identified a series of compounds that block EBOV-like particle entry into human cells. Using data from this screen, quantitative structure-activity relationship models were built and employed for virtual screening of a ‚àº17 million compound library. Experimental testing of 102 hits yielded 14 compounds with IC50 values under 10 ŒºM, including several sub-micromolar inhibitors, and more than 10-fold selectivity against host cytotoxicity. These confirmed hits include FDA-approved drugs and clinical candidates with non-antiviral indications, as well as compounds with novel scaffolds and no previously known bioactivity. Five selected hits inhibited BSL-4 live-EBOV infection in a dose-dependent manner, including vindesine (0.34 ŒºM). Additional studies of these novel anti-EBOV compounds revealed their mechanisms of action, including the inhibition of NPC1 protein, cathepsin B/L, and lysosomal function. Compounds identified in this study are among the most potent and well-characterized anti-EBOV inhibitors reported to date.
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are of significant interest as drugs. However, their use to treat neurological disorders has raised concern because HDACs are required for brain function. We have previously shown that a triple combination formulation (TCF) of the pan HDACi vorinostat (Vo), 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPBCD) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400 improves pharmacokinetic exposure and entry of Vo into the brain. TCF treatment significantly delayed both neurodegeneration and death in the Npc1 nmf164 murine model of Niemann-Pick Type C (NPC) disease. The TCF induces no metabolic toxicity, but its risk to normal brain functions and potential utility in treating lung disease, a major NPC clinical complication, remain unknown. Here we report that TCF administered in healthy mice for 8-10 months was not detrimental to the brain or neuromuscular functions based on quantitative analyses of Purkinje neurons, neuroinflammation, neurocognitive/muscular disease symptom progression, cerebellar/hippocampal nerve fiber-staining, and Hdac gene-expression. The TCF also improved delivery of Vo to lungs and reduced accumulation of foamy macrophages in Npc1 nmf164 mice, with no injury. Together, these data support feasibility of tolerable, chronic administration of an HDACi formulation that treats murine NPC neurological disease and lung pathology, a frequent cause of death in this and possibly additional disorders.
Niemann-Pick disease Type C1 (NPC1) is a rare hereditary neurodegenerative disease. NPC1-patients suffer, amongst others, from ataxia, based on a loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs). Impaired expression/function of excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) are suspected of contributing to PC-degeneration in hereditary spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). Thus, we studied EAAT-expression and its impact to PC-activity in NPC1-/-mice. Western blot revealed reduced EAAT1, EAAT2, EAAT4, and Œ≤III-spectrin levels in NPC1-/-mice. EAATs play a crucial role in synaptic transmission, thus we were interested in the impact of the reduced EAAT-expression on the function of PCs. Patch-clamp recordings of PCs showed no differences in the firing patterns of NPC1+/+and NPC1-/-mice using a low internal chloride concentration. Because EAAT4 also comprises a chloride permeable ion pore, we perturbed the chloride homeostasis using a high internal chloride concentration. We observed differences in the firing patterns of NPC1+/+and NPC1-/-mice, suggesting an impact of the altered EAAT4-expression. Additionally, the EAAT-antagonist DL-TBOA acts differently in NPC1+/+and NPC1-/-mice. Our data support the line of evidence that an altered EAAT-expression/function is involved in neurodegeneration of PCs observed in SCAs. Thus, we suggest that similar pathogenic mechanisms contribute the loss of PCs in NPC1.
Here, we present a case of a 31-year-old man with progressive cognitive decline, ataxia, and dystonia. Extensive laboratory, radiographic, and targeted genetic studies over the course of several years failed to yield a diagnosis. Initial whole exome sequencing through a commercial laboratory identified several variants of uncertain significance; however, follow-up clinical examination and testing ruled each of these out. Eventually, repeat whole exome sequencing identified a known pathogenic intronic variant in the NPC1 gene (NM_000271.4, c.1554-1009G&gt;A) and an additional heterozygous exonic variant of uncertain significance in the NPC1 gene (NM_000271.4, c.2524T&gt;C). Follow-up biochemical testing was consistent with a diagnosis of probable Niemann-Pick disease Type C (NP-C). This case illustrates the potential of whole exome sequencing for diagnosing rare complex neurologic diseases. It also identifies several potential common pitfalls that must be navigated by clinicians when interpreting commercial whole exome sequencing results.
Erythrocyte volume regulation and membrane elasticity are essential for adaptation to osmotic and mechanical stress, and life span. Here, we evaluated whether defective cholesterol trafficking caused by the rare lysosomal storages diseases (LSDs), Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) and Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) deficiency (LALD) impairs these properties. Moreover, we tested whether measurements of cholesterol membrane content and osmotic resistance serve as a screening test for these LSDs.
Patients were genotyped for mutations in NPC1, NPC2, or LIPA genes. We measured LSD plasma biomarkers and LAL activity. Red blood cells (RBC) membrane cholesterol content was evaluated in 73 subjects. Osmotic resistance tests (ORT) were conducted in 121 blood samples from LSD suspected patients and controls.
We did not find statistically significant differences between RBC cholesterol content between subjects and controls. However, the ORT, particularly at 0.49% (w/v) hypotonic sodium chloride solution, revealed a significant higher osmotic resistance in LSDs patients than in controls. We established a cut-off value of ‚â§51% of haemolysis with sensibility and specificity values of 80% and 70%, respectively.
NPC and LALD do not alter cholesterol content in the RBC membrane but increase osmotic resistance. Therefore, ORT serves as screening test for the studied LSDs.
We have tested the efficacy of hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPBCD) delivered by the nasal route in the mouse model of juvenile Niemann-Pick C1 disease (NPC1), as pulmonary disease has not responded to systemic therapy with this drug. Since mice have no gag reflex, coating of the nasal cavity, with possible access to the brain, would be followed by delivery of HPBCD to the lung. While foamy macrophages, containing stored cholesterol, were found in the Npc1 nmf164 homozygous mice, a marked inflammatory response was found with inhaled HPBCD, both in mutant and wild-type animals. Slight inflammation also occasionally occurred with saline inhalation. There was no difference between the saline-treated, HPBCD-treated, and untreated Npc1 nmf164 homozygous mice for weight, balance beam performance, or coat hanger performance. Interestingly, there was a trend to longer survival in the HPBCD-treated Npc1 nmf164 homozygous mice, which, when combined with the survival times of the saline-treated survivals (each of which was not different), became significant.
Niemann-Pick Type C (NPC) disease is a rare neurovisceral disorder caused by mutations of either NPC1 or NPC2 gene and characterized by defective intracellular transport of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids, leading to neuron loss and myelin aberration in the central nervous system. In this study, by comparing protein expression in the cortical white matter tracts from mice at different postnatal days, we identified that in the NPC1 mutant (NPC1-/-) mice, the onset of myelination is delayed and the amount of the major myelin protein MBP and PLP, and oligodendrocyte regulatory factor Olig1 and Olig2, but not NG2 and Sox10, decreased significantly, suggesting a disruption of oligodendrocyte differentiation. Furthermore, in in vitro oligodendrocyte cultivation, NPC1-/- oligodendrocytes showed less response to the stimulation of neuron-conditioned medium (CdM), indicating a defect of oligodendrocyte per se. Interestingly, lovastatin restores the number of mature myelin-forming oligodendrocytes by increasing Olig1 and Olig2 expressions. Our data suggest a potential strategy for improving myelination using lovastatin in NPC disease.
Niemann-Pick type C disease (NP-C) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by a deficiency of NPC1 gene function, which leads to severe neuroinflammation such as astrogliosis. While reports demonstrating neuroinflammation are prevalent in NP-C, information about the onset and progression of cerebellar astrogliosis in this disorder is lacking. Using gene targeting, we generated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) conditional null mutant mice. Deletion of VEGF in cerebellar Purkinje neurons (PNs) led to a significant increase of astrogliosis in the brain of NP-C mice in addition to the loss of PNs, suggesting PN-derived VEGF as an important factor in NP-C pathology. Moreover, replenishment of VEGF in neurons improved brain pathology in NP-C mice. Overall, our data provide a new pathological perspective on cerebellar astrogliosis in NP-C and suggest the importance of VEGF as a therapeutic target for this disease.

Objective: To analyze the clinical manifestations, therapeutic efficacy, prognosis and characteristics of NPC1 mutation in Chinese patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C(NPC). Methods: Ten unrelated Chinese NPC patients were diagnosed by NPC1 mutation analysis from July 2013 to February 2017 in Beijing Tian Tan Hospital of Capital Medical University. Clinical data of 10 cases were analyzed retrospectively which included clinical manifestations, laboratory results and NPC1 gene mutation features, and a series of follow-up were carried out about therapeutic efficacy and prognosis. Results: Ten patients suffering from NPC included 5 males and 5 females, aged from 42 days to 14 years when they presented to Tian Tan Hospital. According to their age of neurological onset, 4 were in early infantile period, 2 in late infantile period, 2 in juvenile periods, and the other 2 cases in neonatal period. They all presented with splenomegaly, 5 of 10 accompanied with hepatomegaly. Two cases of neonatal subtype presented mainly with delayed neonatal cholestatic jaundice and hepatosplenomegaly, accompanied with decreased muscle tone and slight psychomotor retardation. The other 8 cases presented with severe neurological involvement, such as progressive encephalopathy, ataxia and language impairment, 4 with dystonia, 3 with decreased muscle tension, 5 with vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, 5 with gelastic cataplexy, and 4 with epilepsy. Eight of 9 cases presented with foam cells in their bone marrow. Head MRI showed diffuse cerebral atrophy in 8 cases, thin corpus callosum in 2 cases, and brain white matter abnormal signals in 2 cases. Among 10 cases, 18 different mutations of NPC1 allelic genes were identified including 11 reported mutations, 3 novel missense mutations: c. 3683T&gt;C (p.Met1128Thr), c.1926G&gt;C (p.Met642Iie) and c. 3006C&gt;G (p.Phe1002Leu), 2 novel nonsense mutation: c. 1142G&gt;A(p.Trp381Ter ) and c. 3229C&gt;T(p.Arg1077Ter), 1 novel minimal deletion mutation: c. 1385-1386del, and 1 novel intron mutation: c. 1757+ 5G&gt;A. In 5 cases, the symptom of gelastic cataplexy was alleviated by imipramine, and the convulsion was relieved by valproate in 2 cases, by carbamazepine in 1 case at the beginning of seizure. During the 25 (3-66) months of follow-up, 4 cases died, the others' neurological symptoms were deteriorated progressively. Conclusions: The NPC1 gene mutation were high heterozygous in this group, and 7 novel mutations enriched the gene mutation spectrum of NPC1. The neurological manifestations were complicated in patients with NPC, and the symptomatology would be different according to their onset age of neurological symptoms. There might be effective symptomatic treatment for gelastic cataplexy by imipramine and for convulsion by valproate or carbamazepine.

Niemann-Pick disease, type C (NPC) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and early death. NPC is caused by mutations in either the NPC1 or NPC2 gene. Impaired NPC function leads to defective intracellular transport of unesterified cholesterol and its accumulation in late endosomes and lysosomes. A high frequency of Crohn disease has been reported in NPC1 patients, suggesting that gastrointestinal tract pathology may become a more prominent clinical issue if effective therapies are developed to slow the neurodegeneration. The Npc1 nih mouse model on a BALB/c background replicates the hepatic and neurological disease observed in NPC1 patients. Thus, we sought to characterize the gastrointestinal tract pathology in this model to determine whether it can serve as a model of Crohn disease in NPC1.
We analyzed the gastrointestinal tract and isolated macrophages of BALB/cJ cNctr-Npc1m1N/J (Npc1-/-) mouse model to determine whether there was any Crohn-like pathology or inflammatory cell activation. We also evaluated temporal changes in the microbiota by 16S rRNA sequencing of fecal samples to determine whether there were changes consistent with Crohn disease.
Relative to controls, Npc1 mutant mice demonstrate increased inflammation and crypt abscesses in the gastrointestinal tract; however, the observed pathological changes are significantly less than those observed in other Crohn disease mouse models. Analysis of Npc1 mutant macrophages demonstrated an increased response to lipopolysaccharides and delayed bactericidal activity; both of which are pathological features of Crohn disease. Analysis of the bacterial microbiota does not mimic what is reported in Crohn disease in either human or mouse models. We did observe significant increases in cyanobacteria and epsilon-proteobacteria. The increase in epsilon-proteobacteria may be related to altered cholesterol homeostasis since cholesterol is known to promote growth of this bacterial subgroup.
Macrophage dysfunction in the BALB/c Npc1-/- mouse is similar to that observed in other Crohn disease models. However, neither the degree of pathology nor the microbiota changes are typical of Crohn disease. Thus, this mouse model is not a good model system for Crohn disease pathology reported in NPC1 patients.
The non-specific phospholipase C (NPC) is a new member of the plant phospholipase family that reacts to abiotic environmental stresses, such as phosphate deficiency, high salinity, heat and aluminium toxicity, and is involved in root development, silicon distribution and brassinolide signalling. Six NPC genes (NPC1-NPC6) are found in the Arabidopsis genome. The NPC2 isoform has not been experimentally characterized so far.
The Arabidopsis NPC2 isoform was cloned and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. NPC2 enzyme activity was determined using fluorescent phosphatidylcholine as a substrate. Tissue expression and subcellular localization were analysed using GUS- and GFP-tagged NPC2. The expression patterns of NPC2 were analysed via quantitative real-time PCR. Independent homozygous transgenic plant lines overexpressing NPC2 under the control of a 35S promoter were generated, and reactive oxygen species were measured using a luminol-based assay.
The heterologously expressed protein possessed phospholipase C activity, being able to hydrolyse phosphatidylcholine to diacylglycerol. NPC2 tagged with GFP was predominantly localized to the Golgi apparatus in Arabidopsis roots. The level of NPC2 transcript is rapidly altered during plant immune responses and correlates with the activation of multiple layers of the plant defence system. Transcription of NPC2 decreased substantially after plant infiltration with Pseudomonas syringae, flagellin peptide flg22 and salicylic acid treatments and expression of the effector molecule AvrRpm1. The decrease in NPC2 transcript levels correlated with a decrease in NPC2 enzyme activity. NPC2-overexpressing mutants showed higher reactive oxygen species production triggered by flg22.
This first experimental characterization of NPC2 provides new insights into the role of the non-specific phospholipase C protein family. The results suggest that NPC2 is involved in the response of Arabidopsis to P. syringae attack.
Lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) are characterized by the accumulation of diverse lipid species in lysosomes. Niemann-Pick type A/B (NPA/B) and type C diseases Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) are progressive LSD caused by loss of function of distinct lysosomal-residing proteins, acid sphingomyelinase and NPC1, respectively. While the primary cause of these diseases differs, both share common biochemical features, including the accumulation of sphingolipids and cholesterol, predominantly in endolysosomes. Besides these alterations in lysosomal homeostasis and function due to accumulation of specific lipid species, the lysosomal functional defects can have far-reaching consequences, disrupting intracellular trafficking of sterols, lipids and calcium through membrane contact sites (MCS) of apposed compartments. Although MCS between endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria have been well studied and characterized in different contexts, emerging evidence indicates that lysosomes also exhibit close proximity with mitochondria, which translates in their mutual functional regulation. Indeed, as best illustrated in NPC disease, alterations in the lysosomal-mitochondrial liaisons underlie the secondary accumulation of specific lipids, such as cholesterol in mitochondria, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and defective antioxidant defense, which contribute to disease progression. Thus, a better understanding of the lysosomal and mitochondrial interactions and trafficking may identify novel targets for the treatment of Niemann-Pick disease.
This is the first study to objectively measure gait, balance, and upper limb coordination in a group of patients with NPC1 and compare the results to age and gender matched controls. This is also the first study to report effect sizes in these measures. Spatiotemporal gait analysis, static and dynamic posturography, and upper limb reaching motion analysis were performed. The findings showed that the NPC1 subjects had statistically significant deficits on 12 out of the 16 parameters investigated compared to controls, and large effect sizes for all but 1 parameter. When ranking the variables in terms of the effect sizes, the top 5 included at least 1 parameter from each of the 3 motor domains investigated. These results can provide insight to clinical researchers on the selection of outcome measures for longitudinal and interventional studies.
Niemann‚ÅªPick type C (NPC) disease is a rare neurovisceral cholesterol storage disorder that arises from loss of function mutations in the NPC1 or NPC2 genes. Soon after birth, some patients present with an aggressive hepatosplenomegaly and cholestatic signs. Histopathologically, the liver presents with large numbers of foam cells; however, their role in disease pathogenesis has not been explored in depth. Here, we studied the consequences of gadolinium chloride (GdCl‚ÇÉ) treatment, a well-known Kupffer/foam cell inhibitor, at late stages of NPC liver disease and compared it with NPC1 genetic rescue in hepatocytes in vivo. GdCl‚ÇÉ treatment successfully blocked the endocytic capacity of hepatic Kupffer/foam measured by India ink endocytosis, decreased the levels CD68-A marker of Kupffer cells in the liver-and normalized the transaminase levels in serum of NPC mice to a similar extent to those obtained by genetic Npc1 rescue of liver cells. Gadolinium salts are widely used as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrasts. This study opens the possibility of targeting foam cells with gadolinium or by other means for improving NPC liver disease. Synopsis: Gadolinium chloride can effectively rescue some parameters of liver dysfunction in NPC mice and its potential use in patients should be carefully evaluated.
We previously demonstrated that the direct transplantation of human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSCs) into the dentate gyrus ameliorated the neurological symptoms of Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1)-mutant mice. However, the clinical presentation of NPC1-mutant mice was not fully understood with a molecular mechanism. Here, we found 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (14,15-EET), a cytochrome P450 (CYP) metabolite, from hUCB-MSCs and the cerebella of NPC1-mutant mice and investigated the functional consequence of this metabolite. Our screening of the CYP2J family indicated a dysregulation in the CYP system in a cerebellar-specific manner. Moreover, in Purkinje cells, CYP2J6 showed an elevated expression level compared to that of astrocytes, granule cells, and microglia. In this regard, we found that one CYP metabolite, 14,15-EET, acts as a key mediator in ameliorating cholesterol accumulation. In confirming this hypothesis, 14,15-EET treatment reduced the accumulation of cholesterol in human NPC1 patient-derived fibroblasts in vitro by suppressing cholesterol synthesis and ameliorating the impaired autophagic flux. We show that the reduced activity within the CYP system in the cerebellum could cause the neurological symptoms of NPC1 patients, as 14,15-EET treatment significantly rescued cholesterol accumulation and impaired autophagy. We also provide evidence that the intranasal administration of hUCB-MSCs is a highly promising alternative to traumatic surgical transplantation for NPC1 patients.
Niemann Pick type C (NPC) lysosomal disorder is linked to the disruption of cholesterol transport. Recent data suggest that the molecular background of this disease is more complex. It was found that accumulation of cholesterol and glycolipids in the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment of NPC1 cells may affect mitochondrial functions.
In this study, primary skin fibroblasts derived from skin biopsies of two anonymous patients with NPC-carrying mutations in the NPC1 gene, characterized by a high total cholesterol content, as well as two healthy donors were used. The presence of signaling proteins in the whole cell lysates and mitochondrial fractions were examined by Western blotting assay.
In this report, we provide experimental evidence that in NPC1 cells, dysfunction of mitochondria and cellular metabolism, as reported by Wos et al in 2016, coexist with alterations in signal transduction pathways, such as the mammalian target of rapamycin, AKT, phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1, glycogen synthase kinase-3¬†Œ≤, and Jun amino-terminal kinase, leading to abnormal cholesterol accumulation and distribution.
Differences in signal transduction between control and NPC1 cells may suggest that the latter cells experienced significant alterations in the complex molecular mechanisms that control cellular energy metabolism and vesicular transport.
Large-scale "omic" studies investigating the pathophysiological processes that lead to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia have identified an increasing number of susceptibility genes, many of which are poorly characterized and have not previously been implicated in AD. Here, we evaluated the utility of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons and astrocytes as tools to systematically test AD-relevant cellular phenotypes following perturbation of candidate genes identified by genome-wide studies. Lentiviral-mediated delivery of shRNAs was used to modulate expression of 66 genes in astrocytes and 52 genes in induced neurons. Five genes (CNN2, GBA, GSTP1, MINT2, and FERMT2) in neurons and 9 genes (CNN2, ITGB1, MINT2, SORL1, VLDLR, NPC1, NPC2, PSAP, and SCARB2) in astrocytes significantly altered extracellular AŒ≤ levels. Knock down of AP3M2, CNN2, GSTP1, NPC1, NPC2, PSAP, and SORL1 reduced IL-6 levels in astrocytes. Only knock down of FERMT2 led to a reduction in the proportion of TAU that is phosphorylated. Further, CRISPR-Cas9 targeting of FERMT2 in both familial AD (fAD) and fAD-corrected human neurons validated the findings of reduced extracellular AŒ≤. Interestingly, FERMT2 reduction had no effect on the AŒ≤42:40 ratio in corrected neurons and a reduction of phospho-tau, but resulted in an elevation in AŒ≤42:40 ratio and no reduction in phospho-tau in fAD neurons. Taken together, this study has prioritized 15 genes as being involved in contributing to AŒ≤ accumulation, phosphorylation of tau, and/or cytokine secretion, and, as illustrated with FERMT2, it sets the stage for further cell-type specific dissection of the role of these genes in AD.
Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a tool to rapidly map the spatial location of analytes without the need for tagging or a reporter system. Niemann-Pick disease type C1 (NPC1) is a neurodegenerative, lysosomal storage disorder characterized by accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and sphingolipids in the endo-lysosomal system. Here, we use MSI to visualize lipids including cholesterol in cerebellar brain tissue from the NPC1 symptomatic mouse model and unaffected controls. To complement the imaging studies, a data-processing pipeline was developed to generate consensus mass spectra, thereby using both technical and biological image replicates to assess differences. The consensus spectra are used to determine true differences in lipid relative abundance; lipid distributions can be determined in an unbiased fashion without prior knowledge of location. We show the cerebellar distribution of gangliosides GM1, GM2, and GM3, including variants of lipid chain length. We also performed MALDI-MSI of cholesterol. Further analysis of lobules IV/V and X of the cerebellum gangliosides indicates regional differences. The specificity achieved highlights the power of MSI, and this new workflow demonstrates a universal approach for addressing reproducibility in imaging experiments applied to NPC1.
The monitoring of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis and trafficking is of great importance because their imbalance leads to many pathologies. Reliable tools for cholesterol detection are in demand. This study presents the design and synthesis of fluorescent probes for cholesterol recognition and demonstrates their selectivity by a variety of methods. The construction of dedicated library of 14 probes was based on heterocyclic (pyridine)-sterol derivatives with various attached fluorophores. The most promising probe, a P1-BODIPY conjugate FP-5, was analysed in detail and showed an intensive labelling of cellular membranes followed by intracellular redistribution into various cholesterol rich organelles and vesicles. FP-5 displayed a stronger signal, with faster kinetics, than the commercial TF-Chol probe. In addition, cells with pharmacologically disrupted cholesterol transport, or with a genetic mutation of cholesterol transporting protein NPC1, exhibited strong and fast FP-5 signal in the endo/lysosomal compartment, co-localizing with filipin staining of cholesterol. Hence, FP-5 has high potential as a new probe for monitoring cholesterol trafficking and its disorders.
Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is a lysosomal storage disorder resulting from mutations in either the NPC1 (95%) or NPC2 (5%) genes. NPC typically presents in childhood with visceral lipid accumulation and complex progressive neurodegeneration characterized by cerebellar ataxia, dysphagia, and dementia, resulting in a shortened lifespan. While cholesterol is widely acknowledged as the principal storage lipid in NPC, multiple species of sphingolipids accumulate as well. This accumulation of sphingolipids led to the initial assumption that NPC disease was caused by a deficiency in a sphingolipid catabolism enzyme, similar to sphingomyelinase deficiencies with which it shares a family name. It took about half a century to determine that NPC was in fact caused by a cholesterol trafficking defect, and still as we approach a century after the initial identification of the disease, the mechanisms by which sphingolipids accumulate remain poorly understood. Here we focus on the defects of sphingolipid catabolism in the endolysosomal compartment and how they contribute to the biology and pathology observed in NPC disease. This review highlights the need for further work on understanding and possibly developing treatments to correct the accumulation of sphingolipids in addition to cholesterol in this currently untreatable disease.
Niemann-Pick type C disease is a fatal, progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in NPC1, a multipass transmembrane glycoprotein essential for intracellular lipid trafficking. We sought to define the cellular machinery controlling degradation of the most common disease-causing mutant, I1061T NPC1. We show that this mutant is degraded, in part, by the proteasome following MARCH6-dependent ERAD. Unexpectedly, we demonstrate that I1061T NPC1 is also degraded by a recently described autophagic pathway called selective ER autophagy (ER-phagy). We establish the importance of ER-phagy both in vitro and in vivo, and identify I1061T as a misfolded endogenous substrate for this FAM134B-dependent process. Subcellular fractionation of I1061T Npc1 mouse tissues and analysis of human samples show alterations of key components of ER-phagy, including FAM134B. Our data establish that I1061T NPC1 is recognized in the ER and degraded by two different pathways that function in a complementary fashion to regulate protein turnover.
We report the first evidence of GEX1A, a polyketide known to modulate alternative pre-mRNA splicing, as a potential treatment for Niemann-Pick type C disease. GEX1A was isolated from its producing organism, Streptomyces chromofuscus, and screened in NPC1 mutant cells alongside several semisynthetic analogues. We found that GEX1A and analogues are capable of restoring cholesterol trafficking in NPC1 mutant fibroblasts, as well as altering the expression of NPC1 isoforms detected by Western blot. These results, along with the compound's favorable pharmacokinetic properties, highlight the potential of spliceosome-targeting scaffolds such as GEX1A for the treatment of genetic diseases.
The Niemann Pick type C (NPC) proteins, NPC1 and NPC2, are involved in the lysosomal storage disease, NPC disease. The formation of a NPC1‚ÅªNPC2 protein‚Åªprotein complex is believed to be necessary for the transfer of cholesterol and lipids out of the late endosomal (LE)/lysosomal (Lys) compartments. Mutations in either NPC1 or NPC2 can lead to an accumulation of cholesterol and lipids in the LE/Lys, the primary phenotype of the NPC disease. We investigated the NPC1(NTD)‚ÅªNPC2 protein‚Åªprotein complex computationally using two putative binding interfaces. A combination of molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations reveals atomic details that are responsible for interface stability. Cholesterol binding energies associated with each of the binding pockets for the two models are calculated. Analyses of the cholesterol binding in the two models support bidirectional ligand transfer when a particular interface is established. Based on the results, we propose that, depending on the location of the cholesterol ligand, a dynamical interface between the NPC2 and NPC1(NTD) proteins exists. Structural features of a particular interface can lower the energy barrier and stabilize the passage of the cholesterol substrate from NPC2 to NPC1(NTD).
Niemann-Pick disease type C1 (NPC1) is a rare, neurodegenerative cholesterol storage disorder. Diagnostic delay of &gt;5‚ÄØyears is common due to the rarity of the disease and non-specific early symptoms. To improve diagnosis and facilitate early intervention, we previously developed a newborn screening assay based on newly identified plasma bile acid biomarkers. Because the newborn screen had been validated using dried blood spots (DBS) from already diagnosed NPC1 patients, an unanswered question was whether the screen would be able to detect individuals with NPC1 at birth.
To address this critical question, we obtained the newborn DBS for already diagnosed NPC1 subjects (n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ15) and carriers (n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ3) residing in California, New York, and Michigan states that archive residual DBS in biorepositories. For each of the DBS, we obtained two neighbor controls - DBS from patients born on the same day and in the same hospital as the NPC1 patients and carriers. 3Œ≤,5Œ±,6Œ≤-trihydroxycholanic acid (bile acid A) and trihydroxycholanic acid glycine conjugate (bile acid B) were measured in the DBS using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay.
Bile acid B, the more specific biomarker for which the fully validated DBS assay was developed, was detected in 8/15 NPC1 patients, and elevated above the cut-off in 2/15 patients (the two samples with the shortest storage time). Bile acid B was detected in 2/2, 6/10, and 0/7 NPC1 samples that have been stored for &lt;10.5‚ÄØyears, 13-20‚ÄØyears, and‚ÄØ&gt;‚ÄØ20‚ÄØyears, respectively, indicating that the glycine conjugate is detectable in DBS but may have reduced long-term stability compared with bile acid A, the precursor trihydroxycholanic acid, which was elevated in 15/15 NPC1 subjects, but not in carriers and controls.
These results demonstrate that newborn screening for NPC1 disease is feasible using bile acid biomarkers.
Signaling through the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is mediated by the Patched (Ptch) family of proteins. Although the vertebrate Ptch proteins Ptch1 and Ptch2 harbor two closely related transmembrane modules related to sterol-sensing domains (SSDs), the role of these closely related receptors in the Hh pathway are not equivalent. Ptch1 is essential for development and appears to be the principal receptor mediating responses to Hh ligands, whereas Ptch2 is nonessential, and its role in Hh-signaling remains ambiguous. We hypothesized that the SSDs of the Ptch proteins function as generic modules whose protein-specific activities are determined by the adjacent cytoplasmic and luminal domains. We first showed that individual N-terminal and C-terminal halves of Ptch1 associated noncovalently to mediate ligand-dependent regulation of Hh signaling. The analogous regions of Ptch2 also interacted noncovalently but did not repress the Hh pathway. However, the SSD of Ptch2 were capable of repressing Hh signaling, as determined using chimeric proteins where the SSDs of Ptch1 were replaced by those from Ptch2. Replacement of the SSDs of Ptch1 with the analogous regions from the cholesterol transporter NPC1 failed to produce a chimeric protein capable of Hh repression. Further refinement of the specific regions in Ptch1 and Ptch2 revealed that specific cytoplasmic domains of Ptch1 were necessary but not sufficient for repression of Hh signaling and that the two principal luminal domains of Ptch1 and Ptch2 were interchangeable. These data support a model where the SSDs of the Ptch family proteins exhibit generic activities and that the adjacent cytoplasmic and luminal domains determine their protein-specific activities.
Elucidating which host factors are exploited by viruses to infect target cells is key to our understanding of how these pathogens cause disease and how it might be counteracted by future therapies. Pooled gene-trap mutagenesis of haploid human HAP1 cells has proven to be a formidable tool for revealing genes involved in the infection process for a suite of human pathogenic viruses. This method has led to the identification of a number of virus receptors and unconventional entry mechanisms into human cells. In the case of Ebola virus, for example, the discovery of the lysosomal protein NPC1 as an intracellular receptor sparked the development of tailored strategies to interfere with viral infection. The "single tube" pooled screening technique presented here does not require any automation or robotics and is potentially applicable to any virus able to infect HAP1 cells.
The sigma receptor (œÉR) family has been considered mysterious for a long time. In fact, the œÉ2R subtype has been cloned only recently, revealing its identity as TMEM97, a NPC1-binding protein involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer and neurologic disorders. With the aim of developing new chemical entities gifted with œÉR affinity, herein we report the design and synthesis of new piperidine-based alkylacetamide derivatives with mixed affinity towards both œÉ1 and œÉ2R subtypes.
To delineate the clinical and genetic features of a Chinese boy suspected for Niemann-Pick disease type C.
The patient underwent clinical examination and was subjected to next generation sequencing. Suspected mutations were validated by Sanger sequencing. Potential impact of the novel mutation was predicted by SIFT, PolyPhen-2 and MutationTaster software.
The child has featured hepatosplenomegaly, increased direct bilirubin, jaundiced skin and liver damage. DNA sequencing showed that he has carried compound heterozygous mutations of NPC1 gene, namely c.2728G&lt;A (p.G910S) and c.269C&gt;G (p.P90R), which were inherited from his mother and father, respectively. The c.2728G&gt;A (p.G910S) mutation was previously reported, while the c.269C&gt;G (p.P90R) was a novel mutation.
The child has suffered from Niemann-Pick disease type C due to mutations of NPC1 gene. Above finding has enriched the spectrum of NPC1 mutations and provided a basis for genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis.
Niemann Pick C (NPC) is a fatal hereditary neurovisceral disorder associated with a progressive loss of neurons of unknown mechanism. The disease is caused by mutation in either of two genes, termed npc1 and npc2, accounting for ‚àº95% and ‚àº5% of patients, respectively. Recent data suggest a cell-autonomous cause for neuronal cell death. In a former study we could demonstrate that cultured NPC1-deficient (NPC1-/-) neurons are more susceptible to autophagic stress than NPC1-wildtype (wt) neurons. In the present study we tested other stressors for a selective effect on the survival of NPC1-/- neurons. To that end we challenged cultured primary cortical neurons from a NPC mouse model and from wild type littermate mice by a variety of different stressors: glutamate, hydrogen superoxide, osmotic shock and inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. In all paradigms neurons behave virtually identical with one exception: NPC1 deficient neurons are more vulnerable against a challenge with lovastatin. The analysis of the molecular background provides evidence that statin endangers survival of neurons by interfering in the autophagy of cells.
Two proteins have been linked as the critical components in the molecular mechanisms involved in the Niemann Pick type C (NPC) disease: NPC1, a 140 kDa polytopic membrane-bound protein, and the smaller (132 residues), water-soluble NPC2 protein. NPC1 is believed to act in tandem with NPC2, transferring cholesterol and other sterols out of the LE/Lys compartments. Mutations in either NPC1 or NPC2 can lead to an accumulation of cholesterol and lipids in the LE/Lys, the primary phenotype of the NPC disease, but approximately 95% of identified disease-causing mutations have been mapped to the membrane-bound NPC1 protein. Here, we investigate the full length, membrane-bound NPC1 protein computationally using a combination of molecular modeling, docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. An analysis of titratable amino acid side chains, several buried in protein pockets, reveals several nonstandard protonation states for the low-pH scenario (pH 5) that is realized in the lysosome. Together with the location of these buried amino acids, docking studies have identified putative lipid binding domains that are in close proximity to amino acids that, when mutated, are connected to NPC1 loss-of-function. Using energy analyses and MD simulations, we analyze these domains as potential cholesterol binding sites and propose the possibility of multiple sterol binding pockets enabling the intramolecular transport of sterol molecules to the transmembrane domain.
Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC) is a fatal autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a defect in the intracellular transport of lipoproteins leading to the accumulation of lipids in diverse tissues. A visceral and neuronal phenotype mimicking human NPC1 disease has been described in NPC1 mutant mice. These mice are by now the most widely used NPC1 rodent model to study NPC and developmental compounds against this devastating disease. Here we characterized NPC1-/- mice for their hepatic and neuronal phenotype to confirm the stability of the phenotype, provide a characterization of disease progression and pinpoint the age of robust phenotype onset. Animals of 4-10 weeks of age were analyzed for general health, motor deficits as well as hepatic and neuronal alterations with a special focus on cerebellar pathology. Our results show that NPC1-/- mice have a reduced general health at the age of 9-10 weeks. Robust motor deficits can be observed even earlier at 8 weeks of age. Hepatic changes included increased organ weight and cholesterol levels at 6 weeks of age accompanied by severely increased liver enzyme levels. Analysis of NPC1-/- brain pathology showed decreased cholesterol and increased AŒ≤ levels in the hippocampus at the age of 6 weeks. Further analysis revealed a decrease of the cytokine IL-12p70 in the cerebellum along with a very early increase of astrocytosis. Hippocampal IL-12p70 levels were increased at the age of 6 weeks followed by increased activated microglia levels. By the age of 10 weeks, also cerebellar AŒ≤ levels were increased along with strongly reduced Calbindin D-28k levels. Our results validate and summarize the progressive development of the hepatic and neuronal phenotype of NPC1-/- mice that starts with cerebellar astrocytosis, making this mouse model a valuable tool for the development of new compounds against NPC.
Filoviruses infect a wide range of cell types with the exception of lymphocytes. The intracellular proteins cathepsin B and L, two-pore channel 1 and 2, and bona fide receptor Niemann‚ÅªPick Disease C1 (NPC1) are essential for the endosomal phase of cell entry. However, earlier steps of filoviral infection remain poorly characterized. Numerous plasma membrane proteins have been implicated in attachment but it is still unclear which ones are sufficient for productive entry. To define a minimal set of host factors required for filoviral glycoprotein-driven cell entry, we screened twelve cell lines and identified the nonlymphocytic cell line SH-SY5Y to be specifically resistant to filovirus infection. Heterokaryons of SH-SY5Y cells fused to susceptible cells were susceptible to filoviruses, indicating that SH-SY5Y cells do not express a restriction factor but lack an enabling factor critical for filovirus entry. However, all tested cell lines expressed functional intracellular factors. Global gene expression profiling of known cell surface entry factors and protein expression levels of analyzed attachment factors did not reveal any correlation between susceptibility and expression of a specific host factor. Using binding assays with recombinant filovirus glycoprotein, we identified cell attachment as the step impaired in filovirus entry in SH-SY5Y cells. Individual overexpression of attachment factors T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1 (TIM-1), Axl, Mer, or dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) rendered SH-SY5Y cells susceptible to filovirus glycoprotein-driven transduction. Our study reveals that a lack of attachment factors limits filovirus entry and provides direct experimental support for a model of filoviral cell attachment where host factor usage at the cell surface is highly promiscuous.
Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) is a neurovisceral, progressively detrimental lysosomal storage disease with very limited therapeutic options and no approved treatment available in the US. Despite its rarity, NPC has seen increased drug developmental efforts over the past decade, culminating in the completion of two potential registration trials in 2018. Areas covered: This review highlights the many available animal models that have been developed in the field and briefly covers classical and new cell technologies. This review provides a high-level evaluation and prioritization of the various models with regard to efficient and clinically translatable drug development, and briefly discusses the relevant developments and opportunities pertaining to this. Expert opinion: With a number of in vitro and in vivo models available, and with having several drugs, all with various mechanisms of action, either approved or in late stage development, the NPC field is in an exciting time. One of the challenges for researchers and developers will be the ability to make use of the lessons learnt from existing late-stage programs as well as the incorporation not only of the opportunities but also the limitations of the many models into successful drug discovery and translational development programs.
Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPCD) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with increases in cellular cholesterol and glycolipids and most commonly caused by defective NPC1, a late endosomal protein. Using ratiometric probes we find that NPCD cells show increased endolysosomal pH. In addition U18666A, an inhibitor of NPC1, was found to increase endolysosomal pH, and the number, size and heterogeneity of endolysosomal vesicles. NPCD fibroblasts and cells treated with U18666A also show disrupted targeting of fluorescent lipid BODIPY-LacCer to high pH vesicles. Inhibiting non-lysosomal glucocerebrosidase (GBA2) reversed increases in endolysosomal pH and restored disrupted BODIPY-LacCer trafficking in NPCD fibroblasts. GBA2 KO cells also show decreased endolysosomal pH. NPCD fibroblasts also show increased expression of a key subunit of the lysosomal proton pump vATPase on GBA2 inhibition. The results are consistent with a model where both endolysosomal pH and Golgi targeting of BODIPY-LacCer are dependent on adequate levels of cytosolic-facing GlcCer, which are reduced in NPC disease.
Hypomyelination in the central nerves system (CNS) is one of the most obviously pathological features in Niemann-Pick Type C disease (NPC), which is a rare neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 1 or 2 (Npc1 or Npc2). Npc1 plays key roles in both neurons and oligodendrocytes during myelination, however, the linkage between the disturbed cholesterol transport and inhibited myelination is unrevealed. In this study, mass spectrometry (MS)-based differential quantitative proteomics was applied to compare protein composition in the corpus callosum between wild type (WT) and NPC mice. In total, 3009 proteins from both samples were identified, including myelin structural proteins, neuronal proteins, and astrocyte-specific proteins. In line to hypomyelination, our data revealed downregulation of myelin structural and indispensable proteins in Npc1 mutant mice. Notably, the reduced ceramide synthase 2 (Cers2), UDP glycosyltransferase 8 (Ugt8), and glycolipid transfer protein (Gltp) indicate the altered sphingolipid metabolism in the disease and the involvement of Gltp in myelination. The identification of most reported myelin structural proteins and proteins from other cell types advocates the use of the corpus callosum to investigate proteins in different cell types that regulate myelination.
Niemann-Pick disease, type C (NPC) is a neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disease affecting the visceral organs and the central nervous system. The age of initial presentation varies from fetal to adult onset, although childhood onset is most common. The life expectancy for the full spectrum of NPC patients is not well defined, and it is unknown if current supportive care impacts the natural history. In order to assess age of death for a large cohort of NPC patients, we "crowd-sourced" age and year of death from information posted on disease support group website memorial walls. We analyzed data from 338 individuals who died between 1968 and 2018. In addition to age of death, gender can be inferred from given names and photographs. The median age of death was 13‚ÄØyears with a range from 0.1-69‚ÄØyears. Although sex significantly affects survival of NPC1 mutant mice, we did not observe a gender dependent survival difference in NPC patients. Median age of survival across time increased between the earliest patients and the most recently deceased patient; however, we found no significant change in survival over the last 20‚ÄØyears. These data suggest that supportive medical care has not impacted survival in the recent past and provides support for the use of historic controls in evaluating therapeutic interventions.
Niemann-Pick C disease (NPC) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder resulting from mutations in the NPC1 (95% of cases) or NPC2 genes. Disturbance of copper homeostasis has been reported in NPC1 disease. In this study we have used whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) and brain electronic autoradiography with copper-64 (64Cu), in the form of the copper(II) bis(thiosemicarbazonato) complex 64Cu-GTSM, to image short-term changes in copper trafficking after intravenous injection in a transgenic mouse model of NPC1 disease. 64Cu-GTSM is taken up in all tissues and dissociates rapidly inside cells, allowing monitoring of the subsequent efflux and redistribution of 64Cu from all tissues. Significantly enhanced retention of 64Cu radioactivity was observed in brain, lungs and blood at 15¬†h post-injection in symptomatic Npc1-/- transgenic mice compared to wildtype controls. The enhanced retention of 64Cu in brain was confirmed by electronic autoradiography, particularly in the midbrain, thalamus, medulla and pons regions. Positron emission tomography imaging with 64Cu in selected chemical forms could be a useful diagnostic and research tool for the management and understanding of NPC1 disease.
Niemann-Pick disease Type C (NPC) is a rare lysosomal storage disease characterized by the dysfunction of intracellular cholesterol trafficking with progressive neurodegeneration and hepatomegaly. We evaluated the potential of 6-O-Œ±-maltosyl-Œ≤-cyclodextrin (G2-Œ≤-CD) as a drug candidate against NPC. The physicochemical properties of G2-Œ≤-CD as an injectable agent were assessed, and molecular interactions between G2-Œ≤-CD and free cholesterol were studied by solubility analysis and two-dimensional proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The efficacy of G2-Œ≤-CD against NPC was evaluated using Npc1 deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and Npc1 deficient mice. G2-Œ≤-CD in aqueous solution showed relatively low viscosity and surface activity; characteristics suitable for developing injectable formulations. G2-Œ≤-CD formed higher-order inclusion complexes with free cholesterol. G2-Œ≤-CD attenuated dysfunction of intercellular cholesterol trafficking and lysosome volume in Npc1 deficient CHO cells in a concentration dependent manner. Weekly subcutaneous injections of G2-Œ≤-CD (2.9 mmol/kg) ameliorated abnormal cholesterol metabolism, hepatocytomegaly, and elevated serum transaminases in Npc1 deficient mice. In addition, a single cerebroventricular injection of G2-Œ≤-CD (21.4 Œºmol/kg) prevented Purkinje cell loss in the cerebellum, body weight loss, and motor dysfunction in Npc1 deficient mice. In summary, G2-Œ≤-CD possesses characteristics favorable for injectable formulations and has therapeutic potential against in vitro and in vivo NPC models.
Niemann-Pick type C (NP-C) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by storage of unesterified glycolipids and cholesterol in lysosome and/or late endosome due to mutations in either NPC1 or NPC2 gene. This study aims to identify the spectrum of sequence alterations associated to NP-C in individuals with clinical suspicion of this disease. The entire coding region and flanking sequences of both genes associated to NP-C were evaluated in a total of 265 individuals that were referred to our laboratory. Clinical and/or biochemical suspicion of NP-C was confirmed by molecular analysis in 54 subjects. In this cohort, 33 different sequence alterations were identified in NPC1 and one in NPC2. Among those, 5 novel alterations in NPC1 gene were identified as follows: one deletion (p.Lys38_Tyr40del), one frameshift (p.Asn195Lysfs*2), and three missense mutations (p.Cys238Arg, p.Ser365Pro and, p.Val694Met) that are likely to be pathogenic through different approaches, including in silico tools as well as multiple sequence alignment throughout different species. We have also reported main clinical symptoms of patients with novel alterations and distribution of frequent symptoms in the cohort. Findings reported here contribute to the knowledge of mutation spectrum of NP-C, defining frequent mutations as well as novel sequence alterations associated to the disease.
We previously reported the altered pulmonary function and pathology found in the mouse model of infantile Niemann-Pick C1 disease, the Npc1-/- mouse. Despite its salutary properties on brain and liver parameters, we did not find efficacious effects of hydroxypropyl-Œ≤-cyclodextrin (HPBCD) on pulmonary pathology. Since we had previously shown the beneficial effects of probucol on the somatic phenotype in the Npc1-/- mice, we have now studied the effects of combined therapy with HPBCD and probucol on the lung with mostly negative results. Body weight and lung weight for body weight were increased in parallel while inspiratory capacity for body weight was markedly decreased. Other physical, biochemical, and pulmonary function parameters were not much changed. There were trends towards improved lung elastance (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.09) and compliance (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.07).
Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) is a lysosomal lipid storage disease with mutation of NPC1/NPC2 genes, which transport lipids in the endosome and lysosome, and various neurological symptoms. NPC patients also develop hepatosplenomegaly or liver disorder in the neonatal period, and 10% suffer severe liver failure. Neonatal hemochromatosis (NH) is a liver disorder characterized by hepatic and extrahepatic siderosis. Although the etiology of NH is unclear, recent reports suggest that the gestational alloimmune mechanism is the cause of NH. Herein, we report a Japanese NPC patient initially diagnosed as NH.
A 5-day-old boy was transferred to our hospital with severe cholestatic liver failure. Congenital infections and metabolic screening were negative, and NH was suspected. However intra and extrahepatic siderosis were not found. As his liver deteriorated rapidly, liver transplantation was performed at 19‚ÄØdays old. The explanted liver showed cirrhosis, and strong C5b-9 complex staining of hepatocytes, so NH was diagnosed. From the age of one and a half years, he developed regression, vertical supranuclear gaze palsy and cataplexy. Fibroblast filipin staining was strong, blood oxysterol was high, and there were compound heterozygous mutations in NPC1,p.[(F288L)];[(K1206N)]. The patient was then diagnosed as NPC and started on miglustat.
Neonatal liver failure was initially diagnosed as NH. Later, the patient developed various neurological symptoms characteristic of NPC. Neurological follow-up of children who develop NH is required.
The accumulation of lipids in the late endosomes and lysosomes of Niemann‚ÅªPick type C disease (NPCD) cells is a consequence of the dysfunction of one protein (usually NPC1) but induces dysfunction in many proteins. We used molecular docking to propose (a) that NPC1 exports not just cholesterol, but also sphingosine, (b) that the cholesterol sensitivity of big potassium channel (BK) can be traced to a previously unappreciated site on the channel's voltage sensor, (c) that transient receptor potential mucolipin 1 (TRPML1) inhibition by sphingomyelin is likely an indirect effect, and (d) that phosphoinositides are responsible for both the mislocalization of annexin A2 (AnxA2) and a soluble NSF (N-ethylmaleimide Sensitive Fusion) protein attachment receptor (SNARE) recycling defect. These results are set in the context of existing knowledge of NPCD to sketch an account of the endolysosomal pathology key to this disease.
Low-density lipoprotein particles are taken up by cells and delivered to the lysosome where their cholesterol esters are cleaved off by acid lipase. The released, free cholesterol is then exported from lysosomes for cellular needs or storage. This article summarizes recent advances in our understanding of the molecular basis of cholesterol export from lysosomes. Cholesterol export requires NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 1 (NPC1) and NPC2, genetic mutations of which can cause Niemann-Pick type C disease, a disorder characterized by massive lysosomal accumulation of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids. Analysis of the NPC1 and NPC2 structures and biochemical properties, together with new structures of the related Patched (PTCH) protein, provides new clues to the mechanisms by which NPC proteins may function.
Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) disease is caused by a deleterious mutation in the Npc1 gene, causing lysosomal accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and sphingolipids. Consequently, NPC1 disease patients suffer from severe neurovisceral symptoms which, in the absence of effective treatments, result in premature death. NPC1 disease patients display increased plasma levels of cholesterol oxidation products such as those enriched in oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), a pro-inflammatory mediator. While it has been shown that inflammation precedes and exacerbates symptom severity in NPC1 disease, it is unclear whether oxLDL contributes to NPC1 disease progression. In this study, we investigated the effects of increasing anti-oxLDL IgM autoantibodies on systemic and neurological symptoms in an NPC1 disease mouse model. For this purpose, Npc1
                        nih
                     mice were immunized with heat-inactivated S. pneumoniae, an immunogen which elicits an IgM autoantibody-mediated immune response against oxLDL. Npc1
                        nih
                     mice injected with heat-inactivated pneumococci displayed an improved hepatic phenotype, including liver lipid accumulation and inflammation. In addition, regression of motor skills was delayed in immunized Npc1
                        nih
                     . In line with these results, brain analyses showed an improved cerebellar phenotype and neuroinflammation in comparison with control-treated subjects. This study highlights the potential of the pneumococcal immunization as a novel therapeutical approach in NPC1 disease. Future research should investigate whether implementation of this therapy can improve life span and quality of life of NPC1 disease patients.
Filoviruses, especially Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV), are notoriously pathogenic and capable of causing severe haemorrhagic fever diseases in humans with high lethality1,2. The risk of future outbreaks is exacerbated by the discovery of other bat-borne filoviruses of wide genetic diversity globally3-5. Here we report the characterization of a phylogenetically distinct bat filovirus, named Mƒõngl√† virus (MLAV). The coding-complete genome of MLAV shares 32-54% nucleotide sequence identity with known filoviruses. Phylogenetic analysis places this new virus between EBOV and MARV, suggesting the need for a new genus taxon. Importantly, despite the low amino acid sequence identity (22-39%) of the glycoprotein with other filoviruses, MLAV is capable of using the Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) as entry receptor. MLAV is also replication-competent with chimeric MLAV mini-genomes containing EBOV or MARV leader and trailer sequences, indicating that these viruses are evolutionally and functionally closely related. Finally, MLAV glycoprotein-typed pseudo-types transduced cell lines derived from humans, monkeys, dogs, hamsters and bats, implying a broad species cell tropism with a high risk of interspecies spillover transmission.
Balanced composition of a well-functioning pulmonary surfactant is crucial and essential for normal breathing. Here, we explored whether the composition of lipids recovered by broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) differ from children with protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) and controls. We wanted to differentiate, if alterations are primarily caused by the disease process or secondary due to an increased amount of cell-membrane lipids derived from inflammatory cells.
Comprehensive lipidomics profiles of BAL fluid from children diagnosed with CF, PBB and controls were generated by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry analysis. BAL cell differential and numbers were examined.
55 children (37 patients with CF, 8 children with PBB and 10 controls) were included in this study. Results showed comparable total quantities of lipids in all groups. Phospholipids were the major lipid fraction and similar in all groups, whereas the fractions of cholesteryl esters were less and of free cholesterol were increased in children with CF. Among the phospholipids, patients with CF had higher proportion of the non-surfactant membrane-lipids in the classes phosphatidylethanolamine based plasmalogens (PE P), phosphatidylethanolmine (PE) and phosphatidylserine (PS), but a lower proportion of phosphatidylcholine (PC) compared to healthy controls. No such changes were identified in the BAL fluid of children diagnosed with PBB. No differences were observed for the surfactant lipids dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholin (PC 32:0) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG).
In CF patients with neutrophilic airway inflammation the lipid composition for surfactant phospholipid components were unchanged, whereas alteration in lipid profile were characteristic for those found in membranes of inflammatory cells. We suspect that the changes in CF were caused by the prolonged inflammation in contrast to a relatively short standing process in PBB.
Sphingolipids are important lipids and integral members of membranes, where they form small microdomains called lipid rafts. These rafts are enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids, which influences biophysical properties. Interestingly, the membranes of the biomedical model organism Caenorhabditis elegans contain only low amounts of cholesterol. Sphingolipids in C. elegans are based on an unusual C17iso branched sphingoid base. In order to analyze and the sphingolipidome of C. elegans in more detail, we performed fractionation of lipid extracts and depletion of glycero- and glycerophospholipids together with in-depth analysis using UPLC-UHR-ToF-MS. In total we were able to detect 82 different sphingolipids from different classes, including several isomeric species.
Type 2 diabetes is associated with vascular complications that deteriorate the quality of life and decrease the life expectancy of individuals. We previously reported the efficacy of sitagliptin for glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes in the Sitagliptin Registration Type 2 Diabetes-Juntendo Collaborating Project (SPIRITS-J). Through the results of the SPIRITS-J study, we expected that optimal comprehensive management of type 2 diabetes according to current clinical practice guidelines in addition to achieving individualized glycemic goals would reduce macrovascular complications and all-cause mortality in Japan. The aim of this study was to evaluate this hypothesis.
We investigated the clinical outcomes prospectively in the extended SPIRITS-J study and compared these to previous Japanese cohort studies in the era before widespread use of guidelines. The primary clinical outcome was a composite of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and all-cause mortality.
Mean duration of follow-up was 3.5‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ1.3¬†years. The crude incidence of the primary outcome per 1000¬†person-years was 13.9 (non-fatal MI 1.44, non-fatal stroke 4.22, all-cause mortality 8.79 per 1000¬†person-years, respectively). It is noteworthy that the incidence of MI in the SPIRITS-J study was very much lower than that in a previous Japanese cohort study. In multivariate analysis, both the history of coronary artery disease and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were independently associated with incidence of primary clinical outcome.
The extended SPIRITS-J study demonstrated that optimal comprehensive management in patients with type 2 diabetes according to the recent practice guidelines has succeeded in preventing macrovascular complications in Japan. This study suggests that more intensive LDL-C-lowering therapy is important for further prevention of macrovascular complications even in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes (UMIN 000004121).
Glucokinase-maturity onset diabetes of the young (GCK-MODY), also known as MODY2, is caused by heterozygous inactivating mutations in the GCK gene. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship of birthweight and cardiometabolic characteristics in MODY2 patients.
Genetic screening for GCK mutations from 192 classical MODY families was performed, and birthweight and clinical profiles of 76 patients from 25 families with identified GCK mutations were collected.
Mutations in GCK were identified in 25 (13%) of the 192 families. Four novel (c.1334‚ÄâG‚Äâ&gt;‚ÄâC, c.1289_1294delTGACGC, c.584‚ÄâT‚Äâ&gt;‚ÄâC, and c.30delC) and twenty-one previously reported mutations were identified and cosegregated with the clinical phenotypes of MODY2 within the pedigrees. MODY2 patients presented a mean birthweight of 3.11‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.44‚Äâkg. Additionally, birthweight was negatively correlated with 2‚Äâh-postprandial glucose (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ-0.426, P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.006), glycated albumin (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ-0.462, P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.035), glycated hemoglobin (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ-0.529, P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.001), total cholesterol (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ-0.430, P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.016), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ-0.383, P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.033) levels after adjustment for age, gender and BMI. Importantly, among the patients who inherited mutations from their mothers, 7 patients whose mothers were treated with insulin during pregnancy had particularly lower birthweight (2.83‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.39‚Äâvs. 3.37‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.39‚Äâkg; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.003), higher total cholesterol (6.15‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.43 vs. 4.06‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.16‚Äâmmol/L; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.002) and LDL-C (4.05‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.35 vs. 2.21‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.13‚Äâmmol/L; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.001) levels compared to the other 21 patients whose mothers received no treatment.
The correlations between birthweight and cardiometabolic indexes indicated that MODY2 patients with lower birthweight (&lt;3.1‚Äâkg) should be monitored and treated more actively to prevent metabolic abnormalities, particularly dyslipidemia. Importantly, prenatal genic diagnosis is highly recommended to avoid inappropriate treatment in pregnancy leading to lower birthweight of offspring.
To investigate whether changes in serum lipids are associated with cognitive performance in first episode psychosis (FEP) patients during their first year of antipsychotic drug treatment. One hundred and thirty-two antipsychotic-treated FEP patients were included through the TOP study along with 83 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC). Information regarding cognitive performance, psychotic symptoms, lifestyle, body mass index, serum lipids [total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides] and antipsychotic treatment was obtained at baseline and after 1¬†year. The cognitive test battery is comprised of assessments for verbal learning, processing speed, working memory, verbal fluency, and inhibition. Mixed-effects models were used to study the relationship between changes over time in serum lipids and cognitive domains, controlling for potential confounders. There was a significant group by HDL interaction effect for verbal learning (F‚Äâ=‚Äâ11.12, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.001), where an increase in HDL levels was associated with improvement in verbal learning in FEP patients but not in HC. Practice effects, lifestyle, and psychotic symptoms did not significantly affect this relationship. Antipsychotic-treated FEP patients who increased in HDL levels during the first year of follow-up exhibited better verbal learning capacity. Further investigations are needed to clarify the underlying mechanisms.
Cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) is responsible for the transformation of high density lipoprotein (HDL) to low density lipoprotein (LDL) and is a risk factor for atherosclerosis. Our study investigated the association of the rs5883 CETP gene polymorphism with HDL and LDL levels, in 45 coronary artery disease patients and 45 control patients.
CETP gene polymorphism was detected using Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Lipoprotein levels were measured using Quantimetrix system.
There were lack of associaition regarding CETP polymorphism in atherosclerosis and HDL and LDL levels (p&gt;0.05) BMI was higher among coronary artery disease patients (CADP) compared to the control group (28.97¬±6.38, 26.52¬±4.39 respectively, p&lt;0.03). Frequency of CADP (82.6 %, n=19) who were taking treatment was higher (17.4 %, n=4) (p&lt;0.00). The frequencies of hypertension and type-2 diabetes were higher among CADP (p&lt;0.00). Families of CADP have more CADP (p&lt;0.02). Small HDL particle levels were higher in the control group (p&lt;0.00).
In Turkey, BMI, and frequencies of hypertension and type-2 diabetes were higher among CADP than among healthy controls. Furthermore, the genotypes of the rs5883 CETP gene polymorphism did not differ between CADP and healthy controls.
In order to improve diagnostics in pleural effusions, additional value of effusion cholesterol, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and syndecan-2 assays to cytology was studied.
Biomarkers were measured in effusion supernatants from 247 patients, of whom 126 had malignant pleural involvement, and their additional diagnostic efficacy to cytology was assessed.
Syndecan-2 measurement, although gave detectable concentrations in all effusions with highest median value in mesotheliomas, was non-discriminative between different pathological conditions. CEA concentrations exceeding 5‚Äâng/mL cut-off point indicated carcinomas, regardless of pleural involvement, which gave a sensitivity of 62% and specificity of 100% for carcinoma. Cholesterol concentration over 1.21‚Äâmmol/L cut-off value indicated neoplastic pleural involvement with 99% sensitivity and 'merely' 69% specificity, the latter mainly due to raised levels being associated also with benign inflammatory effusions. Combined CEA and cholesterol determinations increased the sensitivity for diagnosing carcinomatosis from 70% with cytology alone to 84% and established the correct diagnosis in 16 of 31 carcinomatosis cases with inconclusive cytology. Cholesterol measurement alone, with elevated level, in combination with absence of substantial number of inflammatory cells in effusion sediment proved to be a magnificent marker for neoplastic pleural involvement with 99% efficacy, and recognised all 36 such cases with inconclusive cytology.
Simultaneous measurement of CEA and cholesterol concentrations in effusion, or at least cholesterol alone, in combination with non-inflammatory fluid cytology, provides additional specific information about neoplastic pleural involvement, and can therefore be used as an adjunct to cytology, above all, in inconclusive cases.
Limited data are available on serum levels of different sphingomyelin (SM) and ceramide (CER) species in acne vulgaris (AV).
This study aimed to identify circulating levels of neutral sphingomyelinase activity (N-SMase), ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P), sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), C16-C24 SMs and C16-C24 CERs in AV patients and controls.
Serum was collected from 30 AV patients and 20 age, gender-matched control subjects. Serum levels of C16-C24 SMs and C16-C24 CERs were determined by an optimized multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) method using ultra fast-liquid chromatography (UFLC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Serum activity of N-SMase was assayed by standard kit methods, C1P and S1P levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
A significant increase was observed in serum levels of C16 SM in patients with AV compared to controls. No significant difference was found in C18 and C24 SM levels between the two groups. Very-long-chain C24 CER was significantly decreased in AV patients compared to controls. Long chain C16-C20 CER levels showed no significant difference between AV patients and controls. A significant positive correlation was found between serum total cholesterol levels and all measured SMs and CERs in both the control and patient groups. Patients with AV had increased circulating levels of C16 SM, C1P and lower circulating levels of C24 CER compared to healthy controls, which may provide prognostic value for the disease.
Future studies are needed to understand the role of altered sphingolipid levels in the pathophysiology of AV.
Evidences about the relationship between methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene polymorphism and metabolic syndrome are controversial. The present study aimed to investigate if MTHFR gene polymorphisms MTHFR C677T and MTHFR A1298C are related to metabolic syndrome (MS).
318 patients were enrolled and single nucleotide polymorphisms for MTHFR C667T and A1298C were genotyped. BMI, fasting blood glucose level (FBG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), High-density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglycerides (TG) were measured.
In our study population, there were no significant differences for BMI, FBG, TC, LDL, TG or any component disease of MS between MTHFR C667T, MTHFR A1298C wild type and variants. MTHFR A1298C wild type had significant higher HDL level than MTHFR A1298C variants (50.9¬±1.6 VS. 47.1¬±1.0, P=0.036). Binary logistic regression analysis also showed that MTHFR A1298C variants were significantly associated with lower HDL level (OR=0.963, 95%CI 0.93-0.99, P=0.027). General linear model showed that there was no statistically significant interaction between MTHFR C667T and A1298C gene polymorphism on HDL level. So the reduction in HDL in MTHFR 1298 variants was not due to its linkage disequilibrium with the C677T polymorphism or an interaction between MTHFR 677 and MTHFR 1298 genotypes.
Our study suggests that MTHFR C667T gene polymorphism is not related to any components of metabolic syndrome. MTHFR 1298 variants were significantly associated with lower HDL level compared to MTHFR 1298 wild type.
Hyperphosphatemia is associated with increased risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and reduced antiproteinuric effects of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers. We investigated whether the phosphate binder sevelamer carbonate may enhance the antiproteinuric effect of RAS inhibitors in patients with CKD.
Phase 2, randomized, controlled, open-label, crossover trial.
Between November 2013 and December 2014, we enrolled 53 patients with CKD with estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs)&gt;15mL/min/1.73m2 and residual proteinuria with protein excretion‚â•0.5g/24h despite maximal tolerated ramipril and/or irbesartan therapy from 2 nephrology units in Italy.
After stratification by serum phosphate level,¬†‚â§4 or&gt;4mg/dL, patients were randomly assigned to 3 months of sevelamer (1,600mg thrice daily) treatment followed by 3 months without sevelamer separated by a 1-month washout period or 3 months without sevelamer followed by 3 months with sevelamer, also separated by a 1-month washout period.
The primary outcome was 24-hour proteinuria (n=49patients). Secondary outcomes included measured GFR (using iohexol plasma clearance), office blood pressure (BP), serum lipid levels, levels of inflammation and bone metabolism biomarkers, urinary electrolyte levels, and arterial stiffness.
Changes in proteinuria during the 3-month treatment with (from 1.36 [IQR, 0.77-2.51] to 1.36 [IQR, 0.77-2.60] g/24h) or without (from 1.36 [IQR, 0.99-2.38] to 1.48 [IQR, 0.81-2.77] g/24h) sevelamer were similar (P=0.1). Sevelamer reduced urinary phosphate excretion without affecting serum phosphate levels. Sevelamer reduced C-reactive protein (CRP), glycated hemoglobin, and total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels without affecting levels of office BP, measured GFR, fibroblast growth factor 23, klotho, intact parathyroid hormone, serum vitamin D, or other urinary electrolytes. Results were similar in the low- and high-phosphate groups. Sevelamer was well tolerated. Adverse events were comparable between treatment periods. One case of transient hypophosphatemia was observed during treatment with sevelamer.
Short treatment duration, lower pretreatment proteinuria than expected.
3-month sevelamer treatment did not reduce proteinuria in patients with CKD on maximal RAS blockade. Amelioration of inflammation and dyslipidemia with sevelamer treatment raises the possibility that it may confer benefit in patients with CKD beyond reduction of proteinuria.

To determine the strength of the association between objectively and subjectively measured physical activity (PA) and cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) in a sample of older adults to assess which measure of PA is most appropriate for use in this population.
The study was a cross-sectional analysis of a community-dwelling sample aged 60 years or more (61 women and 34 men). Data collection included anthropometric measurements, blood analytics, and objective and subjective measurements of PA from accelerometers and Yale PA Survey questionnaires, respectively.
Although the questionnaire indicated a higher summary index (total units) of PA in men than in women, objective measurements of total PA (mean counts per minute and steps per day) did not differ by sex. However, we obtained different results between women and men when we analyzed the relation between objective and subjective PA parameters and CVRF. In women, parameters that indicate cardiovascular risk, such as body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), glucose, and total cholesterol, negatively correlated with objective PA parameters, while HDLc positively correlated with objective PA parameters and negatively with subjective PA parameters. In men, BMI and WC were negatively correlated with objective PA parameters, while blood cholesterol, LDLc, and triglycerides negatively correlated with subjective PA parameters.
In women, it seems more appropriate to use objective methods to measure PA, while in men, objective and subjective methods seem to be complementary. Both methods of measurement, accelerometers and questionnaires, should be used simultaneously in research studies in older populations to establish precise relationships between PA and cardiovascular risk.
The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between the qualitative abnormalities on nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NVC), and the concentrations of selected biomarkers (sE-selectin, endothelin-1, high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsCRP)) and lipid metabolism parameters in children and adolescents with Raynaud's phenomenon (RP). Raynaud's phenomenon, to assess whether nailfold capillary changes may reflect the degree of systemic blood vessel abnormalities. The study group included 66 patients (34 undifferentiated-uRP and 32 secondary-sRP) aged 6-19 years and the control group. In both groups, NVC was performed and the selected biomarkers were measured (sE-selectin, endothelin-1, hsCRP) and lipid profile. Endothelin-1, sE-selectin and hsCRP concentrations in patients from both RP groups were significantly higher; concentration of HDL fraction was significantly lower compared with the control group. The analysis of multiple linear regression demonstrated that megacapillaries most strongly determine the sE-selectin value (p = 0.04) and hsCRP (p = 0.03). Both the total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) fraction concentrations were determined by the presence of avascular areas (p = 0.02). In conclusion, specific pathologic NVC changes were associated with higher endothelial damage biomarkers concentration and adverse changes in the lipid profile.
Cardiovascular diseases are the main cause of deaths in the United Arab Emirates and reducing dietary salt intake is recommended to improve the population's health.
a cross-sectional survey was given to 401 students from the University of Sharjah to investigate knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to dietary salt intake and a 24-h dietary recall among a subsample of 122 students, to assess the dietary intake of total fat, cholesterol, saturated fat, trans fat, and sodium.
findings indicated low salt-related knowledge scores among students (17 out of 30), high prevalence of overweight (28%), obesity (14%), hypertension stage 1 (31%), and hypertension stage 2 (20%). The results also revealed a high percentage of students exceeding the recommended intake of total fat (48%), saturated fat (90%), trans fat (64%), and sodium (89%), and all students not meeting potassium recommendations.
culture-specific awareness campaigns on salt and fat intake and their association with health are needed.
(1) Background: Fasting during Ramadan involves large changes in daily eating patterns which strongly impacts the daily biorhythm and challenges the regular function of the digestive tract. The aim of this study was to assess satiety, bowel habits, body composition, blood glycaemia, and blood lipidemia after the consumption of high fiber cereal at dawn (Sohor) during the month of Ramadan; (2) Methods: A two-arm randomized, controlled, single-blinded, parallel-design study was conducted in Ramadan month. Participants were randomized to consume either 90 g of high fiber cereal (11 g fiber/90 g) at Sohor for 20 consecutive days (intervention group, n = 45) or to maintain their habitual diet intake (control group; n = 36); (3) Results: The intervention group reported higher satiety rating scores, improved bowel habits and reduced bloating frequency after the 20-day intervention. Significantly higher intake of carbohydrates and dietary fiber were observed in the intervention group. Total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were significantly lower among the intervention group compared to the control group (p-value = 0.043, and p-value = 0.033, respectively) at the end of the intervention. No significant differences in body weight, body fat percentage, waist circumference, body mass index, blood glucose, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides were observed between the two groups; (4) Conclusions: Consuming high fiber cereal had a positive effect on health and well-being during the month of Ramadan with better satiety, improved bowel functions, and improved blood lipids.
The brain is isolated from the whole body by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) which is located in brain microvessel endothelial cells (ECs). Through physical and metabolic properties induced by brain pericytes, astrocytes and neurons (these cells and the ECs referred to as the neurovascular unit (NVU)), the BBB hardly restricts exchanges of molecules between the brain and the bloodstream. Among them, cholesterol exchanges between these two compartments are very limited and occur through the transport of LDLs across the BBB. Oxysterols (mainly 24S and 27-hydroxycholesterol) daily cross the BBB and regulate molecule/cholesterol exchanges via Liver X nuclear Receptors (LXRs). In addition, these oxysterols have been linked to pathological processes in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Here we propose an overview of the actual knowledge concerning oxysterols and the NVU cells in physiological and in Alzheimer's disease.
The sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) is ascribed to target renal tubular glucose re-absorption, and its inhibition has been proved to induce glucosuria which improves the glycemic index. Accordingly, SGLT2 inhibitors have found to be the promising class of antidiabetic agents for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. A large number of SGLT2 inhibitors have developed through structural modification and investigated for their ability to selectivity inhibit SGLT2 transporters with better bioavailability. Areas covered: This review comprises a summary of patent applications (2013-2018) of SGLT2 inhibitors with focus on chemical structural advancement and therapeutic potentials in the management of diabetes and related disorders. Expert opinion: SGLT2 inhibitors exert multiple metabolic benefits, including reduced glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), improved glycemic control (fasting and postprandial), reduced body weight, reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure and improved HDL cholesterol. Due to the virtue of no interference with insulin action and secretion, their efficacy remains the same even in presence of progressive Œ≤ cell failure in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, few members of this class have been reported to exhibit cardioprotective, renoprotective, and anticancer activity. However, more study on the long-term outcomes in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors is warranted.
A causal relationship exists between macrophage cholesterol levels and inflammation, e.g., Interleukin-1Œ≤ (IL-1Œ≤) secretion. A decrease in intracellular K+ is essential for inflammasome activation/IL-1Œ≤ secretion and, herein, we examined the hypothesis that cellular cholesterol affects K+ -channel activity and K+ -efflux using mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPMs) and human/THP1 macrophages. An increase in cellular cholesterol led to a significant increase in K+ currents (&gt;350% in both MPM and THP1). Enhancing cholesterol efflux returned K+ currents back to basal levels with corresponding increase in intracellular K+ (11.2 - 14.5%) and reduced IL-1Œ≤ secretion (32 - 62%). These data demonstrate a novel mechanism by which cellular cholesterol modulates inflammation/inflammasome via regulation of K+ -channel activity and intracellular K+ levels. Attenuation of IL-1Œ≤ secretion by Nateglinide/Repaglinide further suggests involvement of Kir6 channels. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
Background Metabolic syndrome is associated with high risk of cardiovascular disease, although risk may differ according to the specific conditions present and variability in those conditions. Methods and Results We defined obesity (body mass index [BMI] ‚â•30¬†kg/m2) and metabolic health (&lt;2 nonobesity National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel¬†III conditions) among 3632 Framingham Heart Study offspring cohort participants (mean age, 50.8¬†years; 53.8% women) who were followed up from 1987 to 2014. We defined participants whose variance independent of the mean for a metabolic syndrome-associated measure was in the top quintile as being "variable" for that measure. Variable metabolic health was defined as ‚â•2 variable nonobesity metabolic syndrome components. We investigated the interaction between obesity and metabolic health in their associations with cardiometabolic disease and cardiovascular disease using Cox proportional hazards regression. In addition, we estimated the associations of BMI variability and variable metabolic health with study outcomes within categories of obesity and metabolic health status, respectively. We observed 567 incident obesity (41¬†439¬†person-years), 771 incident metabolically unhealthy state (25¬†765¬†person-years), 272 incident diabetes mellitus (56¬†233¬†person-years), 503 incident hypertension (12¬†957¬†person-years), 589 cardiovascular disease (60¬†300¬†person-years), and 195 chronic kidney disease (47¬†370¬†person-years) events on follow-up. Obesity and being metabolically unhealthy were independently and positively associated with all outcomes. BMI variability, compared with stable BMI, was associated with 163%, 67%, 58%, and 74% higher risks of having obesity, becoming metabolically unhealthy, having diabetes mellitus, and having hypertension, respectively, among nonobese participants. Variable metabolic health, compared with stable metabolic health, was associated with a 28% higher risk of cardiovascular disease, among metabolically healthy participants. Conclusions We did not observe evidence for a positive interaction between obesity and metabolic health status with regard to study outcomes. BMI and metabolic health variability are associated with adverse health outcomes.
Experimental models are essential for clarifying the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in the context of diabetes mellitus (DM). We aimed to evaluate the presence and the magnitude of several factors known to promote atherogenesis, and to assess the potential of a pro-atherogenic environment to stimulate the development of atherosclerotic lesions in a rat model of long-term type 1 DM.
Six control and five DM Wistar rats were evaluated. DM was induced at 11 weeks of age using streptozotocin (STZ; 60 mg/kg, intraperitoneal). Animals were monitored up to 38 weeks of age, when plasma glucose, lipid profile, and markers specific for systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and oxidative stress were measured. The amount of fat within the aortic wall was assessed semiquantitatively using Oil Red O staining.
Diabetic rats presented significantly higher plasma glucose (p &lt; 0.001), total cholesterol and triglycerides (both p = 0.02), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (p = 0.01), and vascular endothelial growth factor (p = 0.04) levels, and significantly lower interleukin-10 (p = 0.04), superoxide dismutase (p &lt; 0.01), and glutathione peroxidase (p = 0.01) levels than the control rats. Mild (grade 1) atherosclerotic lesions were observed in the aortic wall of 80% of the diabetic rats and in none of the control rats.
This study presents a STZ-induced type 1 DM rat model with one of the longest follow-ups in the literature. In this model, long-term DM created a highly pro-atherogenic environment characterised by hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and oxidative stress that resulted in the development of early aortic atherosclerotic lesions.
Systemic sclerosis is associated with an increased prevalence/incidence of coronary artery disease. The aim of this study was to investigate epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) thickness which may contribute to cardio-metabolic risk in systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients without overt cardiac disease. EAT thickness was measured by transthoracic conventional Doppler echocardiography and compared in SSc patients (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ47) and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ36). The relationships between EAT thickness and markers of cardio-metabolic risk in SSc were examined. EAT thickness was significantly greater in patients with SSc compared to healthy controls (6 [7-5] vs 5 [6.75-3.25], p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.041). Compared to controls, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), leukocyte, neutrophil, B-type natriuretic protein (BNP), fasting plasma insulin and HOMA-IR were elevated (18 [31-10] vs 8.5 [18-4], p‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.001; 0.4 [0.67-0.18] vs 0.21 [0.48-0.09], p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.012; 7510 [8731-5990] vs 6435 [7360-5195], p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.002; 4350 [5440-3570] vs 3390 [4168-2903], p‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.001; 111 [185-74] vs 70 [127-70], p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.010; 6.7 [10.5-4.7] vs 4.7 [6.8-4.1], p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.008; 1.7 [2.6-1] vs 1.1 [1.7-0.9], p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.015, respectively). The total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol were decreased in SSc patients (197‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ45 vs 284‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ36, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.005; 118 [148-84] vs 140 [180-115], p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.003, respectively). In patients with SSc, the EAT thickness correlated positively with age, ESR, CRP, insulin, hemoglobin A1c and total and LDL-cholesterol (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.574, p‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.001; r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.352, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.015; r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.334, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.022; r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.290, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.048; r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.317, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.030; r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.396, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.006 and r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.349, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.016, respectively). Our study confirms that EAT thickness is greater in SSc patients compared to healthy controls using echocardiographic measurements. The results of our study suggest that EAT thickness is a candidate for atherosclerotic risk assessment in SSc.
In this study, we investigated the interventional effect of resistant starch (RS) obtained from purple yam (Dioscorea alata L.) on regulating lipid metabolism and gut microbiota in hyperlipidemic hamsters. Compared to low level RS (LR) treatment, high dosage of RS (HR) administration in hamsters was shown to be more efficient in controlling the body weight and adipose tissue mass, and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration and decreased triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations were observed. Fat accumulation in the liver was reduced by RS, and the injury caused due to a high-fat diet on the histomorphology of the cecum and colon was repaired. Furthermore, HR altered the gut community composition by increasing the relative abundances of Bifidobacteria, Lactobacillus, Coprococcus, and Allobaculum, while decreasing Parabacteroides and Dorea. Probiotics, such as Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus, were dramatically increased and highly correlated with blood lipid levels. These results suggested that the usage of RS obtained from purple yam could ameliorate lipid metabolism in association with gut microbiota modulation, which could provide references for further medication.
Emerin (EMD) and barrier to autointegration factor 1 (BANF1) each bind A-type lamins (LMNA) as fundamental components of nuclear lamina structure. Mutations in LMNA, EMD and BANF1 are genetically linked to many tissue-specific disorders including Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathy (LMNA, EMD), lipodystrophy, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (LMNA) and progeria (LMNA, BANF1). To explore human genetic variation in these genes, we analyzed EMD and BANF1 alleles in the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) cohort of 60,706 unrelated individuals. We identified 13 rare heterozygous BANF1 missense variants (p.T2S, p.H7Y, p.D9N, p.S22R, p.G25E, p.D55N, p.D57Y, p.L63P, p.N70T, p.K72R, p.R75W, p.R75Q, p.G79R), and one homozygous variant (p.D9H). Several variants are known (p.G25E) or predicted (e.g., p.D9H, p.D9N, p.L63P) to perturb BANF1 and warrant further study. Analysis of EMD revealed two previously identified variants associated with adult-onset cardiomyopathy (p.K37del, p.E35K) and one deemed 'benign' in an Emery-Dreifuss patient (p.D149H). Interestingly p.D149H was the most frequent emerin variant in ExAC, identified in 58 individuals (overall allele frequency 0.06645%), of whom 55 were East Asian (allele frequency 0.8297%). Furthermore, p.D149H associated with four 'healthy' traits: reduced triglycerides (-0.336; p = 0.0368), reduced waist circumference (-0.321; p = 0.0486), reduced cholesterol (-0.572; p = 0.000346) and reduced LDL cholesterol (-0.599; p = 0.000272). These traits are distinct from LMNA-associated metabolic disorders and provide the first insight that emerin influences metabolism. We also identified one novel in-frame deletion (p.F39del) and 62 novel emerin missense variants, many of which were relatively frequent and potentially disruptive including p.N91S and p.S143F (‚àº0.041% and ‚àº0.034% of non-Finnish Europeans, respectively), p.G156S (‚àº0.39% of Africans), p.R204G (‚àº0.18% of Latinx), p.R207P (‚àº0.08% of South Asians) and p.R221L (‚àº0.15% of Latinx). Many novel BANF1 variants are predicted to disrupt dimerization or binding to DNA, histones, emerin or A-type lamins. Many novel emerin variants are predicted to disrupt emerin filament dynamics or binding to BANF1, HDAC3, A-type lamins or other partners. These new human variants provide a foundational resource for future studies to test the molecular mechanisms of BANF1 and emerin function, and to understand the link between emerin variant p.D149H and a 'healthy' lipid profile.
Clinacanthus nutans (Burm. f.) Lindau (C.¬†nutans) has been reported to lower blood glucose level; however, evidence on its efficacy in lowering diabetic complications is limited. The antidiabetic properties of C.¬†nutans aqueous leaf extract on serum metabolic indices, sorbitol production, and aldose reductase enzyme activities in the kidneys, lens, and sciatic nerve of type II diabetic (T2D) rats were evaluated. All rats except normal control rats were fed with a high-fat diet for 8¬†weeks to induce obesity and subsequently injected with 35¬†mg/kg streptozotocin to induce type II diabetes. Aqueous leaf extract of C.¬†nutans (100 and 200¬†mg¬†kg-1¬†day-1) and quercetin (10¬†mg¬†kg-1¬†day-1) were fed orally for 4¬†weeks. Diabetic rats administered with C.¬†nutans at 100, 200¬†mg¬†kg-1¬†day-1 and quercetin had significantly (p¬†&lt;¬†0.05) lower fasting blood glucose levels post-intervention: 14.2, 14.0, and 19.9¬†mm, respectively, compared with the untreated group (22.1¬†mm). Total cholesterol was significantly (p¬†&lt;¬†0.05) lower in the C.¬†nutans groups in comparison with the diabetic control group. Levels of F2-isoprostane, a marker of oxidative stress, were attenuated in the presence of the extract. Aldose reductase enzyme activity increased by 64, 99, and 0% and total antioxidant activities by 22, 29, and 126%, respectively. Sorbitol levels in the kidney, lens, and nerve were reduced in diabetic rats administered with C.¬†nutans and quercetin group (by 8, 16, and 3%, respectively). The protective effect of the extract to the liver and kidney was confirmed through liver and kidney enzyme markers and histological analyses. The C.¬†nutans has the potential to attenuate T2D-induced metabolic perturbations and complications related to sorbitol accumulation.
Egg white protein and chocolate milk were used for making protein beverage. Microbiological count, sensory attributes, and pH changes were investigated during 10¬†days of refrigerated storage. At the tenth day, the total numbers of bacteria were between 4.05 and 5.77 (Log CFU/ml). It was concluded that when the amount of egg white increases, the number of bacteria significantly decreases. No coliforms, E. coli, salmonella, mold, and yeast were observed. Also, pH levels were increased from 8.3 to 8.7 and acidic spoilage was reduced. The chocolate milk containing 14% egg white was the most preferred by the panelists in all of the evaluated items except texture. Protein, Ca, Na, and energy contents were increased, and fat, cholesterol, saturated fatty acids, total sugar, lactose, carbohydrate, Mg, Fe, and P contents of the treated samples were decreased.
Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) often have insulin resistance (IR) which may be worsened by obesity. The roles of dietary intake and activity are unclear. Our objectives were to determine whether (a) high caloric intake or inactivity explains obesity in PCOS, and (b) dietary composition is associated with PCOS phenotypes.
Eighty-seven women with PCOS and 50 women without PCOS participated in this cohort study at a reproductive medicine center. Data collected included 3-day food and physical activity records, anthropometrics, and metabolic and hormonal assays.
Women with PCOS had increased body mass index (BMI) but similar caloric intake and activity to women without PCOS. There were no differences in protein, carbohydrates, fat, or glycemic load consumption, but women with PCOS consumed less fiber (medians: 19.6 vs. 24.7¬†g) and less magnesium (medians: 238.9 vs. 273.9¬†mg). In women with PCOS, those with IR consumed less fiber, less magnesium, and greater glycemic load than those without IR (medians: 18.2 vs. 22.1¬†g, 208.4 vs. 264.5¬†mg, 89.6 vs. 83.5). Fiber intake of women with PCOS was negatively correlated with IR, fasting insulin, glucose tolerance, testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. Magnesium intake was negatively correlated with IR, C-reactive protein, and testosterone, but positively correlated with HDL cholesterol. Fiber intake and BMI accounted for 54.0% of the variance observed in IR.
Obesity in women with PCOS could not be explained by overeating or inactivity. Increasing dietary fiber and magnesium intakes may assist in reducing IR and hyperandrogenemia in women with PCOS.
Obesity has become one of the most important health problems worldwide requiring urgent need for efficient control. Pleurotuscitrinopileatus (P.¬†citrinopileatus)-a type of edible mushroom with abundant bioactive molecules-is a promising source for achieving this goal. In the present study, we evaluated the anti-obesity and hypolipidemic effect of P.¬†citrinopileatus water extract (PWE) using a series of biochemical assays in randomized high-fat diet-induced obese (DIO) C57BL/6J mice, which were gavaged daily with low or high levels of PWE (400 or 800¬†mg/kg of body weight, respectively) in addition to high-fat diet for 12¬†weeks. Results showed that PWE significantly reduced the weight gain, fat accumulation, and food intake of DIO mice within 12¬†weeks. PWE also decreased the serum triglycerides, cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein, aspartate transaminase, nonesterified fatty acid, and creatinine, but increased high-density lipoprotein. Additionally, PWE improved the glucose tolerance of mice fed with high fat. From above, we conclude that PWE has great potential as functional foods for management of obesity and/or associated metabolic disorders.
Thirty two individuals aged 40-65¬†years old with a moderate hyperlipidemia (serum triglycerides¬†&gt;¬†150¬†mg/dl and LDL from 130 to 160¬†mg/dl) were supplemented once daily for 30¬†days with a 250¬†mg conventional formulation of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) without lycopene (CF-DHA) or 250¬†mg of lycosome-formulated DHA containing 7¬†mg of lycopene (LF-DHA). It was shown that ingestion of CF-DHA led to a transient increase in serum DHA level after 2¬†weeks of the trial, whereas LF-DHA did not cause significant changes in serum DHA. However, there was a noticeable increase in serum eicosapentaenoic acid levels exceeding the pretreatment value by 42.8% and 39.1% after the 2nd and 4th weeks of LF-DHA ingestion. Patients supplemented with LF-DHA showed a significant (19.5¬†mg/dl, p¬†&lt;¬†0.05) decline in LDL, which was accompanied by a corresponding decrease in total serum cholesterol and a much stronger reduction in serum triglyceride levels (reduction of medians by 27.5¬†mg/dl). No changes in HDL were observed. LF-DHA caused a significant decline in the serum level of malonic dialdehyde (MDA), whereas the components of LF-DHA, lycopene and DHA, ingested as two separate formulations had a less significant effect on serum MDA. Moreover, LF-DHA increased both the plasma oxygen transport and tissue oxygen saturation by the end of the observational period, while lycopene or DHA taken alone, or both of them co-ingested separately had none or a much less effect on the oxygen turnover parameters.

                        Introduction:
                     This study aimed to evaluate the combination effect of voluntary exercise and garlic on oxidative markers, cholesterol level and histological alterations in streptozotocin (STZ)- induced diabetes in rat heart. 
                        Methods:
                     Thirty-five male Wistar rats were randomly assigned into five experimental groups (n=7): Control, Diabetes, Diabetes+Garlic, Diabetes+Exercise, Diabetes+Garlic+Exercise groups. Diabetes was induced by STZ (ip, 50 mg/kg) in animals. Animals received garlic homogenate (250 mg/kg) by oral gavage or subjected to voluntary exercise alone or together for 6 weeks. At the end of intervention blood and heart tissue samples were obtained and used for measurement of glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), cholesterol, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and histological analysis. 
                        Results:
                     Improved blood glucose, cholesterol, total antioxidant capacity, and MDA levels were established in both Diabetes+Garlic and Diabetes+Exercise groups. Additionally, staining with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) revealed that voluntary exercise and garlic alone and together reduced interstitial edema, leukocyte infiltration, and myonecrosis. Furthermore, simultaneous treatment of diabetic rats with garlic and exercise training had an additive effect on these parameters. 
                        Conclusion:
                     The findings indicated that combination therapy with garlic and voluntary exercise may present more beneficial effects in heart histological remodeling in diabetic rats than the use of garlic or voluntary exercise alone and that these beneficial effects might be associated with enhancement in cholesterol, total antioxidant capacity, and MDA levels.

                        Introduction:
                     Metabolic syndrome (Mets) has become most important public health problem in the world. We examined the association between Mets and different cardiometabolic phenotype in Azar cohort population. 
                        Methods:
                     In the present study, the data of 13099 subjects who participated in Azar cohort study were cross-sectionally analyzed. Mets was defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III report (ATPIII) criteria. Participants were categorized into four cardiometabolic phenotypes including metabolically healthy Lean (MHL), metabolically unhealthy lean (MUHL), metabolically healthy Obese (MHO), metabolically unhealthy obese (MUHO) according to BMI cut-off point (25 kg/m2 ), and the presence of Mets. 
                        Results:
                     Totally, the prevalence of Mets was 33.20% with the higher prevalence in women (40.1%). About 46.7% of participants were MHO and 1.6% of them were MHL. In both genders, MUHL had the highest prevalence of hyperglycemia, hypertrigliceridemia, hypo-HDL-cholestrolemia and Frahmingham 10-year CVD risk. In both MUHL and MUHO phenotypes, hypertriglyceridemia (OR: 31.97 [95% CI: 22.31, 45.81] and OR: 20.28 [95% CI: 17.32, 23.75]) and hypo-HDL cholestrolemia (OR:27.97 [95% CI: 17.35, 45.09] and OR:11.0 [95% CI: 9.62, 12.58]) are the strongest predictor of incidence of Mets. Also, the results of multinominal regression analyses indicated that in all cardiometabolic phenotypes, Framingham 10- year CVD risks had the lowest power for predicting of Mets incidence. 
                        Conclusion:
                     Based on the results, in addition to obese individuals, multiple metabolic abnormalities were seen in normal weight individuals and these subjects are even at higher risk of developing Mets compared with metabolically obese individuals. So, it seems that decision on initiation of lifestyle interventions should not be only based on the BMI; rather metabolic status seems to be even more important.

                        Introduction:
                     Lipid metabolism is one of the main concerns of cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis. Little is known about the association between dietary patterns and dyslipidemia. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine such association among Iranian adults. 
                        Methods:
                     This cross-sectional study was conducted on 1433 Iranian adults in Isfahan Healthy Heart Program (IHHP). Usual dietary intakes were assessed with the use of a 48 items food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Factor analysis was used to identify dietary patterns. Three major dietary patterns were identified: western, semi healthy and healthy fat patterns. 
                        Results:
                     After adjustment, subjects in the upper quartiles of western dietary pattern were more likely to have high total cholesterol concentrations than those in the first quartile (odds ratio [OR]: 2.07; 95% CI: 1.25-3.42). Individuals with greater adherence to western dietary pattern had greater odds of having high low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels compared with those in the lowest quartiles (2.53; 1.45-4.40). 
                        Conclusion:
                     Semi healthy dietary pattern was not associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Same trend was observed for healthy fat dietary pattern. Significant association was found between western dietary pattern and dyslipidemia among Iranian adults.
Bile salts (BS) are biosurfactants crucial for emulsification and intestinal absorption of cholesterol and other hydrophobic compounds such as vitamins and fatty acids. Interaction of BS with lipid bilayers is important for understanding their effects on membranes properties. The latter have relevance in passive diffusion processes through intestinal epithelium such as reabsorption of BS, as well as their degree of toxicity to intestinal flora and their potential applications in drug delivery. In this work, we used molecular dynamics simulations to address at the atomic scale the interactions of cholate, deoxycholate, and chenodeoxycholate, as well as their glycine conjugates with POPC bilayers. In this set of BS, variation of three structural aspects was addressed, namely conjugation with glycine, number and position of hydroxyl substituents, and ionization state. From atomistic simulations, the location and orientation of BS inside the bilayer, and their specific interactions with water and host lipid, such as hydrogen bonding and ion-pair formation, were studied in detail. Membrane properties were also investigated to obtain information on the degree of perturbation induced by the different BS. The results are described and related to a recent experimental study (Coreta-Gomes et al., 2015). Differences in macroscopic membrane partition thermodynamics and translocation kinetics are rationalized in terms of the distinct structures and atomic-scale behavior of the bile salt species. In particular, the faster translocation of cholate is explained by its higher degree of local membrane perturbation. On the other hand, the relatively high partition of the polar glycine conjugates is related to the longer and more flexible side chain, which allows simultaneous efficient solvation of the ionized carboxylate and deep insertion of the ring system.
The normal range for Aspartate and Alanine Aminotransferases (AST and ALT) levels (&lt;40¬†IU/L) were set in 1950s. Recent data from certain countries suggest lower levels of AST and ALT. Aim of the study was to redefine the normal values of aminotransferases in healthy Indian adults.
In a cross sectional prospective study, 1002 blood donors were evaluated to isolate a healthy cohort. Four and 9 subjects positive for HBsAg and anti-Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) respectively and three females were excluded. 986 male subjects were evaluated for levels of serum aminotransferases.
Of total 986 subjects (Group I), 543 (55.1%) had fatty liver on ultrasound [15 (1.5%) alcoholic fatty liver and 528 (53.5%) Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)]. Median AST and ALT in total group (Group I) were 27.69 (Interquartile Range (IQR) 22.33-37.04) and 34.19¬†IU/L (IQR 23.12-54.87) and in NAFLD (Group II) were 35.67 (IQR -27.49-47.43) and 50.36 (IQR 37.70-76.58)¬†IU/L. Of remaining 443 subjects without fatty liver, 288 had one or more components of metabolic syndrome. Out of 155 patients with no fatty liver and no component of metabolic syndrome (Group III), 103 subjects had normal Body Mass Index (BMI) and normal cholesterol and Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) (Group IIIB). Median AST and ALT in Group IIIB were 22.56 (IQR 20.23-26.91) and 21.36 (IQR 17.49-27.21)¬†U/L respectively with a 95th percentile of 34.28 and 36.57¬†U/L for AST and ALT, respectively.
Levels of AST and ALT in healthy men are lower than the conventional values in India.
Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) hydrolyzes cholesteryl (CE) and retinyl (RE) esters and triglyceride (TG). Mice globally lacking LAL accumulate CE most prominently in the liver. The severity of the CE accumulation phenotype progresses with age and is accompanied by hepatomegaly and hepatic cholesterol crystal deposition. In contrast, hepatic TG accumulation is much less pronounced in these mice, and hepatic RE levels are even decreased. To dissect the functional role of LAL for neutral lipid ester mobilization in the liver, we generated mice specifically lacking LAL in hepatocytes (hep-LAL-ko). On a standard chow diet, hep-LAL-ko mice exhibited increased hepatic CE accumulation, but unaltered TG and RE levels. Feeding the hep-LAL-ko mice a vitamin A excess/high-fat diet (VitA/HFD) further increased hepatic cholesterol levels, but hepatic TG and RE levels in these mice were lower than in control mice. Performing in vitro activity assays with lysosomal enriched fractions from liver of mice globally lacking LAL, we detected residual acid hydrolytic activities against TG and RE. Interestingly, this non-LAL acid TG hydrolytic activity was elevated in lysosomal enriched fractions from livers of hep-LAL-ko mice upon VitA/HFD feeding. In conclusion, the neutral lipid ester phenotype in livers from hep-LAL-ko mice indicates that LAL is limiting for CE turnover, but not for TG and RE turnovers. Furthermore, in vitro hydrolase activity assays revealed the existence of non-LAL acid hydrolytic activities for TG and RE. The corresponding acid lipase(s) catalyzing these reactions remains to be identified.
Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a fast-growing liver disease in the Western world. Currently, only a few animal models show both the metabolic and histological features of human NASH. We aimed to explore murine NASH models in a time dependent manner that exhibit metabolic, histological and transcriptomic hallmarks of human NASH. For this, the murine strains C57BL/6J, ob/ob, and KK-Ay were used and three types of nutritional regimes were administered: normal chow diet (NCD); high-fat, high-fructose, and high-cholesterol diet (fast food diet; FFD); or choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet (CDAHFD), for 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, and 30‚ÄÖweeks. All strains under the FFD and CDAHFD regimes developed steatohepatitis. Among the strains treated with FFD, the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) activity score, fibrosis progression and metabolic abnormalities such as hyperinsulinemia and obesity were more pronounced in ob/ob mice than in C57BL/6J and KK-Ay mice. In ob/ob mice fed FFD, the development of hepatic crown-like structures was confirmed. Furthermore, molecular pathways involved in steatohepatitis and fibrosis showed significant changes from as early as 2‚ÄÖweeks of starting the FFD regime. Ob/ob mice fed FFD showed metabolic, histological, and transcriptomic dysfunctions similar to human NASH, suggesting their potential as an experimental model to discover novel drugs for NASH.
The statin family of cholesterol-lowering drugs has been shown to induce tumor-specific apoptosis by inhibiting the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate (MVA) pathway, HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR). Accumulating evidence suggests that statin use may delay prostate cancer (PCa) progression in a subset of patients; however, the determinants of statin drug sensitivity in PCa remain unclear. Our goal was to identify molecular features of statin-sensitive PCa and opportunities to potentiate statin-induced PCa cell death.
Deregulation of HMGCR expression in PCa was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The response of PCa cell lines to fluvastatin-mediated HMGCR inhibition was assessed using cell viability and apoptosis assays. Activation of the sterol-regulated feedback loop of the MVA pathway, which was hypothesized to modulate statin sensitivity in PCa, was also evaluated. Inhibition of this statin-induced feedback loop was performed using RNA interference or small molecule inhibitors. The achievable levels of fluvastatin in mouse prostate tissue were measured using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.
High HMGCR expression in PCa was associated with poor prognosis; however, not all PCa cell lines underwent apoptosis in response to treatment with physiologically-achievable concentrations of fluvastatin. Rather, most cell lines initiated a feedback response mediated by sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2), which led to the further upregulation of HMGCR and other lipid metabolism genes. Overcoming this feedback mechanism by knocking down or inhibiting SREBP2 potentiated fluvastatin-induced PCa cell death. Notably, we demonstrated that this feedback loop is pharmacologically-actionable, as the drug dipyridamole can be used to block fluvastatin-induced SREBP activation and augment apoptosis in statin-insensitive PCa cells.
Our study implicates statin-induced SREBP2 activation as a PCa vulnerability that can be exploited for therapeutic purposes using clinically-approved agents.
We consider the plasma membrane that contains a cholesterol molar fraction of 0.4 and ask how that cholesterol is distributed between the two leaves. Because of the rapid flip-flop of cholesterol between leaves, we assume that its distribution is determined by the equality of its chemical potentials in the two leaves. When we consider only the contributions of entropy and interactions to the cholesterol chemical potential in our model system, we find, not surprisingly, that the cholesterol is mostly in the outer leaf because of the strong attraction between cholesterol and sphingomyelin (SM), which is predominantly in that leaf. We find 72% there. We then include the contribution from the bending energy in each leaf that must be overcome to join the leaves in a flat bilayer. The product of bending modulus and spontaneous curvature is obtained from simulation. We find that the addition of cholesterol to the outer leaf reduces the spontaneous curvature, which is initially positive, until it passes through zero when the molar fraction of cholesterol in the outer leaf is 0.28. Additional cholesterol is driven toward the inner leaf by the sphingomyelin phosphatidylcholine mixture. This is resisted by the bending energy contribution to the inner leaf. We find, again by simulation, that the addition of cholesterol monotonically increases the magnitude of the spontaneous curvature of the inner leaf, which is negative. This increases its bending energy. We conclude that, as a result of these competing effects, the percentage of cholesterol in the outer leaf is reduced to ‚àº63 ¬± 6%.
The impetus for the current study was to evaluate the efficacy of cranberry supplementation on cardiovascular disease metabolic risk factors in adult populations.
A systematic review was conducted on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar up to June 2018, to identify randomized controlled trials investigating the effect of cranberry supplementation on cardiovascular metabolic risk factors.
The results of the pooled effect size indicated that cranberry administration significantly reduced systolic blood pressure and body mass index. No statistically significant change was observed in triacylglycerol, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, fasting plasma glucose, fasting insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, diastolic blood pressure, waist circumference, C-reactive protein, and intercellular adhesion molecule. Stratified analysis showed that SBP reduction was more pronounced in studies with ‚â•50 mean age participants. Also, subgroup analysis suggested a significant increase in high-density lipoprotein concentrations in subgroups with subjects &lt;50 mean age, and triacylglycerol levels in subsets with cranberry administered in juice form.
This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests cranberry supplementation may be effective in managing systolic blood pressure, body mass index and high-density lipoprotein in younger adults. Further high-quality studies are needed to confirm these results.
The importance of glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (A1c) control as part of comprehensive risk factor management in patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) is controversial.
The purpose of this study was to determine whether a greater number of controlled risk factors at 1 year, including A1c, affects survival in patients with DM and SIHD.
Of 690 patients with DM followed in the COURAGE (Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation) trial, 592 (86%) had complete ascertainment of 7 pre-specified risk factors at baseline and after 1 year: systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, nonsmoking, physical activity, diet adherence, body mass index, and A1c. The primary outcome measure was mortality beyond 1 year after randomization.
During a mean follow-up of 7.0 ¬± 4.2 years beyond 1 year after randomization, 186 subjects died (31.4% overall, 4.5%/year). The greater the number of risk factors controlled at 1 year, the higher the probability of survival (unadjusted log rank p¬†=¬†0.002). Compared with 0 to 1 controlled risk factors, attaining 3 to 7 goals predicted progressively lower mortality (hazard ratio for control of 6 or 7 risk factors was 0.13; 95% confidence interval: 0.05 to 0.40). Importantly, only 10.3% of subjects achieved control of 6 or 7 risk factors. In multivariate analysis, the strongest predictors of improved survival were no smoking, regular physical activity, dietary adherence, and A1c¬†&lt;7%.
In this high-risk subset of SIHD patients with DM, the number of controlled risk factors, particularly lifestyle behaviors and A1c, were associated with improved survival. (Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and¬†Aggressive Drug Evaluation; NCT00007657).
Sex-based differences in cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden are widely acknowledged, with male sex considered a risk factor in high-income settings. However, these relationships have not been examined in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We aimed to apply the American Heart Association (AHA) ideal cardiovascular health (CVH) tool modified by the addition of C-reactive protein (CRP) to examine potential sex-based differences in the prevalence of CVD risk in rural Uganda.
In a cross-sectional study nested within a population-wide census, 857 community-living adults completed physical and laboratory-based assessments to calculate individual ideal CVH metrics including an eight category for CRP levels. We summarized sex-specific ideal CVH indices, fitting ordinal logistic regression models to identify correlates of improving CVH. As secondary outcomes, we assessed subscales of ideal CVH behaviours and factors. Models included inverse probability of sampling weights to determine population-level estimates.
The weighted-population mean age was 39.2 (1.2) years with 52.0 (3.7) % females. Women had ideal scores in smoking (80.4% vs. 68.0%; p‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.001) and dietary intake (26.7% vs. 16.8%; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.037) versus men, but the opposite in body mass index (47.3% vs. 84.4%; p‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.001), glycated hemoglobin (87.4% vs. 95.2%; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.001), total cholesterol (80.2% vs. 85.0%; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.039) and CRP (30.8% vs. 49.7%; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.009). Overall, significantly more men than women were classified as having optimal cardiovascular health (6-8 metrics attaining ideal level) (39.7% vs. 29.0%; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.025). In adjusted models, female sex was correlated with lower CVH health factors sub-scales but higher ideal CVH behaviors.
Contrary to findings in much of the world, female sex in rural SSA is associated with worse ideal CVH profiles, despite women having better indices for ideal CVH behaviors. Future work should assess the potential role of socio-behavioural sex-specific risk factors for ideal CVH in SSA, and better define the downstream consequences of these differences.
Background: The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review with meta-analysis and meta-regressions evaluating the effects of isolated strength training (ST), compared with a control group, on total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), C-reactive protein (CRP), and adiponectin of adults. Methods: Embase, PubMed, Cochrane, and Scopus data sources were searched up to May 2017. Clinical trials that compared ST with a control group of adults older than 18 years, which evaluated blood TC, TG, LDL, HDL, CRP, or adiponectin as an outcome were included. Random effect was used and the effect size (ES) was calculated by using the standardized mean difference with a 95% confidence interval. Results: ST promotes a reduction in TC (ES: -0.399; P‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ.001), TG (ES: -0.204; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.002), LDL (ES: -0.451; P‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ.001), and CRP (ES: -0.542; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.01) levels. In addition, ST is associated to an increase in HDL (ES: 0.363; P‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ.001) and adiponectin concentrations (ES: 1.105; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.01). Conclusion: ST promotes decreases in TC, TG, LDL, and CRP levels and increases HDL and adiponectin concentrations. Thus, progressive ST could be a potential therapeutic option for improving abnormalities in lipid and inflammatory outcomes in adults.
Lipids play an important role in processes such as the formation of membrane cells or in steroidogenesis, where androgens which stimulate the proliferation of prostate cancer (PCa) cells are produced. Previous studies presented links between cholesterol (CHOL) and PCa and concluded that cholesterol homeostasis changes in PCa patients during treatment and with age. This study further examines the correlation between the lipid profile, the treatment used, and the subjects' age. Ninety-one subjects (Group 1: &gt;69 years; Group 2: ‚â§69) histopathologically diagnosed with PCa were tested. Total CHOL, triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) were assessed from blood taken before the entire course of radiotherapy (RT) and in 3-month intervals after the treatment was completed, for up to 4 years (range: palliative and radical). In all the subjects, the CHOL decreased over time after RT ( p = .0445) with a simultaneous increase of prostate specific antigen (PSA) concentration ( p = .0366). A faster decrease of HDL was observed with a higher concentration of PSA ( p = .0053) and Gleason score ( p = .0304). In all the subjects, the HDL decreased after RT ( p = .0159) but in the older palliative group the HDL decrease progressed more slowly ( p = .0141). It could be stated, that after radical therapy TG levels tended to be consistently higher among younger men relative to the elderly ( p = .0151). But it was observed that RT treatment could lead to a decrease in the lipid serum concentration.
The international guideline recommendations for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering were made based on the results of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), meta-analyses, and observational studies mostly in the White population. It was not clear whether these LDL-C targets could be applicable to other ethnic groups, for example, Asian patients. This review aimed to address major aspects related to the lipid goal and statin therapy in Asia, including the epidemiology of cardiovascular disease, the LDL-C profiles, the lipid goals from localized guidelines, genetics and lifestyles, and the efficacy and safety of statins. Owing to the geographic, ethnic, genetic, and cultural diversity in this region, we observed a geographic pattern of diversity in cardiovascular epidemiology and statin response in Central Asia, East Asia (particularly for Asia-Pacific region), and South Asia. The rapidly growing literature from Asian countries questioning "lower is better" hypothesis was noticed. However, owing to the nature of these dominantly observational data, the conclusion was hardly confirmative. Despite the rapid expansion of the current literature in this region, efforts should be made to ensure an adequate sample size to assess the significance of a given lipid parameter on overall cardiovascular outcomes in this Asian population.
The relationship between high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and the severity of coronary artery disease beyond low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, the primary target of cholesterol-lowering therapy, remains uncertain. We evaluated the association between high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and obstructive coronary artery disease using parameters of any obstructive plaque, obstructive plaque in the left main coronary artery or proximal left anterior descending artery, and obstructive plaque in multi-vessels, according to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.
We analyzed 5130 asymptomatic non-diabetics who underwent coronary computed tomography angiography for general health examination. Obstructive plaque was defined as a plaque with ‚â•50% luminal diameter stenosis. The participants were divided into three groups based on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of ‚â§129, 130-159, and ‚â•160‚Äâmg/dl. The prevalence of any obstructive plaque (5.9% vs 6.4% vs 10.6%) and obstructive plaque in the left main coronary artery or proximal left anterior descending artery (2.1% vs 2.1% vs 4.3%) significantly increased with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol category (all p‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.05). Compared with subjects with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level ‚â•40‚Äâmg/dl, those with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level &lt;40‚Äâmg/dl had a significantly higher prevalence of any obstructive plaque (10.4% vs 5.1%), obstructive plaque in the left main coronary artery or proximal left anterior descending artery (3.6% vs 1.8%), and obstructive plaque in multi-vessels (4.3% vs 1.1%), only in the group with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level ‚â§129‚Äâmg/dl (all p‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.05). Multiple regression analysis showed that increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were associated with a reduced risk of all obstructive coronary artery disease parameters only in the group with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level ‚â§129‚Äâmg/dl (all p‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.05).
Increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were independently associated with a lower risk of obstructive coronary artery disease in asymptomatic non-diabetics with low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.
Using a community sample of 1205 elderly persons, we investigated the associations and potential interactions between Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype and serum phosphatidylethanolamine (PlsEtn) on cognition and dementia. For each person, APOE genotype, PlsEtn Biosynthesis value (PBV, the combination of three key PlsEtn species), cognition (the combination of five specific cognitive domains), and diagnosis of dementia was determined. APOE genotype and PBV were observed to be non-interacting (p &gt; 0.05) and independently associated with cognition: APOE (relative to Œµ3Œµ3:Œµ2Œµ3 (Coef = 0¬∑14, p = 4.2 √ó 10-2); Œµ3Œµ4/Œµ4Œµ4 (Coef = -0.22, p = 6.2 √ó 10-5); PBV (Coef = 0.12, p = 1.7 √ó 10-7) and dementia: APOE (relative to Œµ3Œµ3:Œµ2Œµ3 (Odds Ratio OR = 0.44, p = 3.0 √ó 10-2); Œµ3Œµ4/Œµ4Œµ4 (OR = 2.1, p = 2.2 √ó 10-4)); PBV (OR = 0.61, p = 3.3 √ó 10-6). Associations are expressed per standard deviation (SD) and adjusted for serum lipids and demographics. Due to the independent and non-interacting nature of the APOE and PBV associations, the prevalence of dementia in APOE Œµ3Œµ4/Œµ4Œµ4 persons with high PBV values (&gt;1 SD from mean) was observed to be the same as APOE Œµ3Œµ3 persons (14.3% versus 14.0%). Similarly, the prevalence of dementia in APOE Œµ3Œµ3 persons with high PBV values was only 5.7% versus 6.7% for APOE Œµ2Œµ3 persons. The results of these analyses indicate that the net effect of APOE genotype on cognition and the prevalence of dementia is dependent upon the plasmalogen status of the person.
Weight gain after childbirth is a significant risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2DM) development after gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The level of weight loss achieved in diabetes prevention programs for women after GDM is often low but its effects on the cardiometabolic risk are not known. In a secondary analysis of a diabetes prevention program in postpartum women with history of gestational diabetes, we evaluated the effect of weight change on the cardiometabolic outcomes at 1-year follow-up. Of the 284 women randomized to the intervention arm, 206 with the final outcome measurements were included in the analyses. Participants were categorized into weight loss (&gt;2 kg, n = 74), weight stable (¬±2 kg, n = 74) or weight gain (&gt;2 kg, n = 58) groups. The weight loss group had significantly greater decrease in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) than the weight gain group (-0.1 + 0.4% vs. 0 + 0.4%, p = 0.049). The weight loss group had significantly greater decrease in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol cholesterol than the other two groups (p &lt; 0.05). The weight gain group had significantly greater increase in triglyceride and triglyceride:high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio compare with the other groups (p &lt; 0.01). Overall, a small amount of weight loss and prevention of further weight gain was beneficial to the cardiometabolic outcomes of postpartum women after GDM.
In the present study, we show that cholesterol crystals induce NFŒ∫B activation, and ICAM1 and VCAM1 expression via xanthine oxidase-mediated H2O2 production and PP2A inhibition in influencing endothelial cell and monocyte interactions and all these adverse effects of cholesterol crystals could be attenuated by proresolving lipid mediator RvD1. In addition, feeding mice with cholesterol rich diet (CRD) increased xanthine oxidase expression, its activity and H2O2 production leading to PP2A inhibition, NFŒ∫B activation, and ICAM1 and VCAM1 expression and RvD1 attenuated all these effects of CRD substantially. Furthermore, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from wild type mice when injected into mice that were fed with CRD or RvD1¬†+¬†CRD showed increased leukocyte trafficking to arteries of CRD-fed mice as compared to RvD1¬†+¬†CRD mice. These findings suggest that cholesterol crystals via promoting oxidant stress and inhibiting Ser/Thr phosphatases such as PP2A stimulate NFŒ∫B activation and ICAM1 and VCAM1 expression, and thereby enhance EC-monocyte interactions. In addition, proresolving lipid mediators such as RvD1 appear to exert their anti-inflammatory effects via countering the adverse effects of cholesterol crystals or CRD.
The comorbidity of coronary heart disease (CHD) and depression in patients is extremely prevalent, with a rate from 20 to 50%, while depression-like behaviors exist in a larger percentage of patients. Therefore, the study of comorbidities is particularly urgent. Chaihu-Shugan-San (CSS), a classical traditional Chinese medicine formula, has been used to treat CHD with depression for hundreds of years. However, the mechanism of its action on comorbidities remains unclear. Here, we focused on the behavioral changes in ApoE-/- mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and elucidated the mechanism of CSS and its main absorbed component, meranzin hydrate (MH), as an anti-atherosclerosis and anti-depression agent. In the present study, mice were fed an HFD for 16 weeks and were intragastrically administered high and low doses of CSS and MH. Depressive-like behaviors were evaluated by the sucrose preference test, the open-field test, the light-dark test and the tail-suspension test, after which atherosclerotic plaques, plasma lipids, inflammatory cytokine levels and the expression of BDNF/TrkB were measured. We demonstrated that the atherosclerosis model group exhibited significant depressant behaviors. Moreover, CSS inhibited depressive-like behavioral changes, reduced atherosclerotic plaque areas, plasma total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol levels and inflammatory cytokines including TNF-Œ±, IL-1Œ≤, and IL-6 in plasma and hippocampi, increased the protein and mRNA expression of BDNF and TrkB in the aorta and the hippocampus. Interestingly, MH, the main component in CSS that is absorbed in the plasma and hippocampus, exerted effects similar to those of CSS. In addition, MH increased the protein and mRNA expression of BDNF and TrkB in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) induced by LPS. Collectively, these results suggest that MH represents the CSS decoction, induces anti-atherosclerosis effects and improves depression-like behaviors in HFD-fed ApoE-/- mice. Moreover, the regulation of proinflammatory factors and BDNF-TrkB signaling are possibly involved in this process. Our findings indicate that MH is a potential phytochemical compound for the prevention of the comorbidity of atherosclerosis and depression.
The organochlorine dieldrin (DLD) bioaccumulates in lipid-rich tissues and is associated with immunosuppression, altered metabolism, and cancer. The objective was to determine the effect of DLD on the hepatic proteome in zebrafish following dietary treatment. Females were fed a control dose or one of three doses of DLD-contaminated food pellets over 21‚ÄØdays. Both label-free and iTRAQ proteomics were conducted as two complementary methods to expand coverage of the liver proteome and to validate proteomic response. Label-free proteomics quantified 1563 proteins: 6 proteins showed a linear dose-response with DLD. iTRAQ quantified &gt;3500 proteins; 5 proteins were decreased and 34 proteins were increased in abundance within the liver with all three doses. Overall, DLD reduced the abundance of proteins associated with glucose and cholesterol metabolism, lipid oxidation, liver function, and immune-related processes. Few proteins were identified by both methods as being altered (~1%), suggesting that each method detected different protein subsets. Protein responses in the liver showed dose specificity. Despite this, proteins associated with liver and organ function, centrosome separation, glucose/energy metabolism, and immune-related pathways were confirmed by each independent technique as those suppressed by DLD at the proteome level. This study identifies proteomic responses that are associated with organochlorine-induced hepatotoxicity. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Environmental contaminants cause hepatotoxicity due to the fact that the liver is the major organ for detoxification. The legacy pesticide dieldrin significantly bioaccumulates in tissues, and can affect molecular processes that can lead to liver pathology. LC MS/MS proteomics identified protein networks related to tumors, energy homeostasis, and chromosomal separation as those affected by dietary exposure to dieldrin. We applied two orthogonal mass spectrometry-based methods to more completely survey the liver proteome, strengthening data interpretation. These data improve understanding as to the effects of organochlorine pesticide toxicity in the liver and identify proteome networks that can contribute to adverse outcome pathways for pesticide exposure.
BACKGROUND Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a potentially fatal complication of diabetes mellitus. While lifestyle changes can reduce diabetes risk, it is unclear whether improved lifestyle can slow or reverse DN progression. This study evaluated whether an intensive lifestyle intervention (IL-I) targeting weight loss and inflammation through increased physical activity and reduced caloric intake can delay DN progression. MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups. Both groups received diet and exercise guidelines, but one (IL-I) received more frequent external support than the other (control). We compared markers of metabolic and cardiovascular health, redox status, inflammation, and renal function between groups at 3 and 6 months. Metabolic and cardiovascular metrics included BMI, blood pressure, blood glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and serum HDL-cholesterol. Redox status was evaluated by serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the lipid oxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA), while inflammation was assessed by serum concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-alpha. Renal function was assessed by urine/serum 8-OHdG, albumin: creatinine ratio (ACR), and the renal fibrosis marker TGF-√ü1. RESULTS Both groups demonstrated initial BMI reduction, lower HbA1c, and higher HDL-cholesterol, but changes were significantly larger in the IL-I group at 6 months. Blood pressure at 6 months was reduced only in the IL-I group. The IL-I group also achieved a greater sustained SOD increase and MDA reduction. Finally, only the IL-I group demonstrated significant reductions in urine ACR, serum/urine 8-OHdG, and plasma TGF-√ü1. These indicators deteriorated after IL-I was stopped. CONCLUSIONS Lifestyle changes including exercise and diet can delay renal damage and promote improvement from DN.
Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have an excess risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD). The objective of the study was to compare CV risk profile in female and male RA patients with low disease activity.
The study group consisted of 70 RA patients with continuous low disease activity and no CVD (54 women, 16 men) and 33 healthy controls of comparable age. The groups were assessed for blood pressure, serum amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), carotid intima media thickness (cIMT), electrocardiography, ejection fraction (EF), and diastolic dysfunction (DD).
Significantly higher burden of atherosclerosis, as revealed by higher cIMT, was found in males [0.93 (0.2) mm] vs females [0.80 (0.2) mm]. The risk of 10-year CVD was significantly higher in men than in women with RA. High/very high risk of fatal CVD was found in 62.5% of male patients. Males were significantly more often current/ex-smokers and had lower HDL-cholesterol and higher atherogenic index. There were no significant differences in NT-proBNP, QTc duration, and parameters of EF and DD.
In RA patients with continued low disease activity, a higher burden of atherosclerosis was found in males than in females. The data suggest a significant impact of traditional CV risk factors.
Atherosclerosis is one of the primary causes of cardiovascular disease and mortality. This chronic immunometabolic disease evolves during decades in humans and encompasses different organs and immune cell types, as well as local and systemic processes that promote the progression of the disease. The most frequently used animal model to study these atherogenic processes and inter-organ crosstalk in a short time frame are genetically modified mouse models. Some models have been used throughout the last decades, and some others been developed recently. These models have important differences in cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism, reverse cholesterol transport pathway, obesity and diabetes as well as inflammatory processes. Therefore, the disease develops and progresses differently in the various mouse models. Since atherosclerosis is a multifaceted disease and many processes contribute to its progression, the choice of the right mouse model is important to study specific aspects of the disease. We will describe the different mouse models and provide a roadmap to facilitate current and future atherosclerosis researchers to choose the right model depending on their scientific question.
Low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) has been an object of research since the 1970s because of its role in various cell functions. The LDLR family members include LRP5, LRP6, and LRP8. Even though LRP5, 6, and 8 are in the same family, intriguingly, these three proteins have various roles in physiological events, as well as in regulating different mechanisms in various kinds of cancers. LRP5, LRP6, and LRP8 have been shown to play important roles in a broad panel of cancers. LRP5 is highly expressed in many tissues and is involved in the modulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion, bone development, and cholesterol metabolism, as well as cancer progression. Recently, LRP5 has also been shown to play a role in chondroblastic subtype of osteosarcoma (OS) and prostate cancer and also in noncancer case such as osteoporosis. LRP6, which has been previously discovered to share the same structures as LRP5, has also been associated with many cancer progressions such as human triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCL), lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In addition to its role in cancer progression, LRP8 (apolipoprotein E receptor 2 [APOER2]) has also been demonstrated to regulate canonical Wnt/Œ≤-catenin signaling pathway whereby this pathway plays a role in cell migration and development. Therefore, this review aimed to elucidate the role of LRP 5, 6, and 8 in regulating the cancer progression.
Background: Heart failure is a frequent complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Plasma cholesterol, particularly the proatherogenic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, impairs heart function by promoting atheroma formation and ventricular dysfunction. Considering the established effect of cholesterol on the cardiovascular system, we hypothesized that plasma LDL cholesterol may influence left ventricular function in individuals with T2DM. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Taiwan. Enrollment criteria were patients exceeding 21 years of age with T2DM who received antidiabetic and cholesterol-lowering medications. Candidates were excluded if they had heart failure, acute cardiovascular events, or familial hypercholesterolemia. Participants received blood sampling for plasma lipids after a 12-h fast, followed by transthoracic echocardiography in the cardiology clinic. Results: The study enrolled 118 participants who were divided into two groups according to their plasma LDL cholesterol levels. Demographic characteristics including age (69.7 vs. 66.9 years, P = 0.159), body mass index (26.2 vs. 25.9 kg/m2, P = 0.66), diabetes duration (5.4 vs. 5.1 years, P = 0.48), hemoglobin A1c (7.2 vs. 7.5%, P = 0.225), and systolic blood pressure (129 vs. 130 mm Hg, P = 0.735) were similar between these groups. Moreover, all participants received similar antihypertensive medications. Participants with lower plasma LDL cholesterol levels had better heart function, as measured by the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), than patients with higher LDL cholesterol levels (58.0 vs. 50.5%, P = 0.022). Multivariate regression analysis also showed an inverse correlation between plasma LDL cholesterol and left ventricular function (Œ≤ coefficient: -0.110, P = 0.024). Conclusion: This study observed an inverse correlation between plasma LDL cholesterol and heart function in individuals with T2DM. Patients with higher levels of plasma LDL cholesterol had worse left ventricular function. Therefore, plasma LDL cholesterol may be a modifiable risk factor of heart failure in diabetes, but prospective studies are necessary to confirm this finding.
The purpose of this study was to categorize patients into different grades of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by ultrasonography and to compare the findings with their serum lipid profile.
Descriptive, cross-sectional study design was used. One hundred and nine patients without a history of alcohol consumption of age more than 16 years attending general health checkup were selected at Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Maharajganj, Kathmandu, as per the exclusion and inclusion criteria. Ultrasound scanning of the patients was done and their liver size, as well as grading of fatty liver, was done. Data were collected in predesigned pro forma and were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 16.0, IBM (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).
In this study, the mean age of fatty liver in males was found to be 44.3 years and in females was found to be 51.9 years. 22.9% of patients with NAFLD had increased liver size. Significant association with increasing grades of fatty liver was found with increasing levels of cholesterol (P = 0.028), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (P = 0.017), liver size (P = 0.001), and body mass index (BMI) (P = 0.045) in patients diagnosed with NAFLD. No significant association with increasing grades of fatty liver was found with increasing levels of triglyceride (P = 0.32) and high-density lipoprotein (P = 0.25).
Ultrasound is a safe and first-line modality for the evaluation of fatty liver and its grading. Increasing grades of fatty liver had significant association with increasing levels of cholesterol LDL, increasing liver size, and BMI of patients.
A novel alcohol dehydrogenase from Bartonella apis (BaADH) was heterologous expressed in Escherichia coli. Its biochemical properties were investigated and used to catalyze the synthesis of ethyl (S)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate ((S)-CHBE), which is a chiral intermediate of the cholesterol-lowering drug atorvastatin. The purified recombinant BaADH displayed 182.4¬†U/mg of the specific activity using ethyl 4-chloroacetoacetate as substrate under the conditions of 50¬†¬∞C in pH 7.0 Tris-HCl buffer. It was stable in storage buffers of pH 7 to 9 and retains up to 96.7% of the initial activity after 24¬†h. The Km and Vmax values of BaADH were 0.11¬†mM and 190.4¬†Œºmol¬†min-1¬†mg-1, respectively. Synthesis of (S)-CHBE catalyzed by BaADH was performed with a cofactor regeneration system using a glucose dehydrogenase, and a conversion of 94.9% can be achieved after 1¬†h reaction. Homology modeling and substrate docking revealed that a typical catalytic triad is in contact with local water molecules to form a catalytic system. The results indicated this ADH could contribute to the further enzymatic synthesis of (S)-CHBE.
The incidence of hypertension (HTN) is rising worldwide with an estimated prevalence of 22%, 7.5 million deaths (12.8%). It is a major risk factor for coronary heart diseases and hemorrhagic strokes. In Oman, the crude prevalence of HTN was 33.1%, whereas the age-adjusted prevalence was 38.3%. Among Gulf Cooperation Countries, 47.2% of the individuals were hypertensive, and women were more likely to have HTN than men. Similarly, the prevalence of low-birth-weight (LBW) is also rising globally with the more prevalent incidence in developing countries reaching almost a rate just lower than 20.0/100 births. In Oman, the prevalence of LBW was 4.2% in 1980, which doubled (8.1%) in 2000 and has shown a slow but steady increase reaching 10.2% in 2013. LBW term is the most commonly used surrogate measure of intrauterine growth retardation and has been related to increased cardiovascular mortality, due to increased risk of cardiovascular risk factors, including blood pressure (BP), diabetes, cholesterol level, and other risk factors. The epidemiologic evidence clearly points to an inverse association between birth weight and many hemodynamic cardiovascular risk markers. Possible mechanisms operating in fetal life that might determine BP include the structural development of resistance arteries, the setting of hormone levels, and nephron endowment. Retarded fetal growth leads to permanently reduced cell numbers in the kidney. Patients with high BP had almost 50% less number of glomeruli compared to that of the normotensive individuals, and subsequent accelerated growth may lead to excessive metabolic demand on this limited cell mass. It is not merely a reduced nephron number that is responsible for HTN, but compensatory maladaptive changes that occur internally when nephrogenesis is compromised. The likelihood of an adverse outcome is greatly amplified in those born with LBW who later develop obesity or an increased ponderal index.
Serum amyloid A (SAA) is an apo-lipoprotein (12-14¬†kDa) produced by the liver in response to proinflammatory cytokines from activated monocytes. The precursor of SAA is an acute-phase protein involved in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis and has been found to be increased during exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer. However, no data are available on SAA levels in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the most common and severe idiopathic form of interstitial pneumonitis associated with a usual interstitial histological and radiological pattern. The aim of this preliminary study was to evaluate SAA concentration in patients with IPF and to explore its potential use as a clinical biomarker.
SAA levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in a population of 21 patients with IPF (14 male, aged 64.8¬†¬±¬†8.1 years) and compared with those in 11 healthy controls (3 male, aged 55¬†¬±¬†11.3 years). Clinical, functional, and immunological data were collected in a database.
SAA levels were significantly higher in patients with IPF than in controls (p¬†=¬†0.03). In patients with IPF, statistically significant correlations were found between SAA and HDL cholesterol levels (r¬†=¬†-0.62, p¬†=¬†0.05) and FVC % predicted value (r¬†=¬†-0.52, p¬†=¬†0.01).
SAA is a promising marker of disease severity in patients with IPF. Our preliminary data suggest a potential pathogenetic role of alteration in lipid metabolism in this rare disease.
Tumor-infiltrating T¬†cells often lose their effector function; however, the mechanisms are incompletely understood. We report that cholesterol in the tumor microenvironment induces CD8+ T¬†cell expression of immune checkpoints and exhaustion.¬†Tumor tissues enriched with cholesterol and cholesterol content in tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T¬†cells were positively and progressively associated with upregulated T¬†cell expression of PD-1, 2B4, TIM-3, and LAG-3. Adoptively transferred CD8+ T¬†cells acquired cholesterol, expressed high levels of immune checkpoints, and became exhausted upon entering a tumor. Tumor culture supernatant or cholesterol induced immune checkpoint expression by increasing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in CD8+ T¬†cells. Consequently, the ER stress sensor XBP1 was activated and regulated PD-1 and 2B4 transcription. Inhibiting XBP1 or reducing cholesterol in CD8+ T¬†cells effectively restored antitumor activity. This study reveals a mechanism underlying T¬†cell exhaustion and suggests a new strategy for restoring T¬†cell function by reducing cholesterol to enhance T¬†cell-based immunotherapy.
The fortification of milk with phytosterols is an increasingly common practice to enhance the sterol profile and offer consumers potential health benefits. This study investigated whether cattle feed can influence the profile of phytosterols and cholesterol in the milk produced as an alternative to direct fortification of milk. Five experiments were performed using feeds commonly used by Australian dairy farmers and selected formulated rumen-protected feeds. Statistical significances were observed for some individual plant sterols and cholesterol in milk under these differing feeding regimens compared with the respective controls. In the case of the phytosterols, where the daily recommended consumption is typically 2 g per day, the total phytosterols were &lt;0.12 mg/100 mL of milk. An experiment using a rumen-protected feed with high phytosterol levels suggested a decreased transfer of cholesterol to the milk by as much as 20%, although further work is required to confirm these preliminary results. Overall, the study suggests that different feeding practices have minimal effect on the resulting sterol profile of the milk.
Emergency Medical Services (EMS) professionals face high physical demands in high-stress settings; however, the prevalence of cardiovascular health (CVH) risk factors in this health care workforce has not been explored. The primary objective of this study was to compare the distribution of CVH and its individual components between a sample of emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and paramedics. The secondary objective was to identify associations between demographic and employment characteristics with ideal CVH in EMS professionals.
A cross-sectional survey based on the American Heart Association's (AHA; Dallas, Texas USA) Life's Simple 7 (LS7) was administered to nationally-certified EMTs and paramedics. The LS7 components were scored according to previously described cut points (ideal = 2; intermediate = 1; poor = 0). A composite CVH score (0-10) was calculated from the component scores, excluding cholesterol and blood glucose due to missing data. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR; 95% CI) for demographic and employment characteristics associated with optimal CVH (‚â•7 points).
There were 24,708 respondents that were currently practicing and included. More EMTs achieved optimal CVH (n = 4,889; 48.8%) compared to paramedics (n = 4,338; 40.6%). Factors associated with higher odds of optimal CVH included: higher education level (eg, college graduate or more: OR = 2.26; 95% CI, 1.97-2.59); higher personal income (OR = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.17-1.37); and working in an urban versus rural area (OR = 1.31; 95% CI, 1.23-1.40). Paramedic certification level (OR = 0.84; 95% CI, 0.78-0.91), older age (eg, 50 years or older: OR = 0.65; 95% CI, 0.58-0.73), male sex (OR = 0.54; 95% CI, 0.50-0.56), working for a non-fire-based agency (eg, private service: OR = 0.68; 95% CI, 0.62-0.74), and providing medical transport service (OR = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.69-0.94) were associated with lower odds of optimal CVH.
Several EMS-related characteristics were associated with lower odds of optimal CVH. Future studies should focus on better understanding the CVH and metabolic risk profiles for EMS professionals and their association with incident cardiovascular disease (CVD), major cardiac events, and occupational mortality.
Statin drugs have become the most highly prescribed drugs for cardiovascular disease. However, there is disagreement as to the existence of adverse effects of statin administration on cognitive function. Therefore, it is important to better understand the effects of statins on cognition and possible mechanisms of these effects. Areas covered: We analyzed relevant studies of the relationship between cognitive performance and statin and usage. We included articles published between 2018 and 1992. We identified three randomized trials, one observational study and 66 case reports that provided credible evidence of statin-induced cognitive impairment. We also identified seven randomized trials and two observational studies reporting no significant evidence of statin-induced cognitive impairment. Expert opinion: We found methodological differences that may have contributed to the divergence of these results. Evaluation of all these studies indicated that statin-associated cognitive decline is a real entity. Likely mechanisms to explain the adverse effects include 1. Reduction of synthesis of coenzyme Q10 with consequent increasing oxidative stress and reduction of cerebral energy production; 2. Depletion of central nervous system myelin by inhibition of cholesterol synthesis. We conclude that statin-induced cognitive decline does exist, needs to be better recognized and requires more studies of prevention and treatment.
Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have unfavorable metabolic profiles. Their offspring may be affected by such risks. The objective of the current study was to disclose associations between preconception health of these women and health of their offspring. 74 women diagnosed with PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria were screened systematically before conception. Cardiovascular health of their offspring was assessed at 2.5-4 (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ42) or at 6-8‚Äâyears of age (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ32). Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed with adjustments for potential confounders. In the primary analyses the association between preconception Body Mass index (BMI) and offspring BMI was evaluated. Secondly associations between preconception blood pressure, androgens, insulin-resistance (HOMA-IR), and LDL-cholesterol in women with PCOS and BMI and blood pressure of offspring were assessed. Results show that preconception BMI of women with PCOS was positively associated with sex- and age-adjusted BMI of their offspring at 6-8‚Äâyears of age (Œ≤‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.55 (95% CI: 0.12 to 0.97), p‚Äâ=‚Äâ.012). No other significant associations were found. In conclusion, our data suggest that preconception BMI in PCOS is significantly associated with offspring BMI at 6-8‚Äâyear of age. If this suggestion could be confirmed this may provide an opportunity for improving the future health of these children.
The prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in schizophrenia patients is increasing worldwide. The aim of the current study was to examine the progress of MetS in a schizophrenia cohort we had previously investigated and determine the role of various related factors, including sociodemographic and clinical variables, nutritional status and physical activity. Of the 319 patients investigated in the first study, 149 patients agreed to be included in the follow-up. Physical measurements and laboratory tests were performed in addition to evaluations with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser Side Effects Scale, International Physical Activity Questionnaire, 24¬†h dietary recall method and Nutrition Information Systems Package Program. According to the ATPIII, ATPIIIA and IDF criteria, the MetS prevalences had increased from 35.6 to 44.3%, 38.9 to 53% and 43.6 to 55.7%, respectively. Patients with MetS had a shorter period of hospitalization and a higher UKU total side effects score, and most of them were married or divorced/widowed. Patients with MetS also had a higher daily consumption of added sugar, cholesterol, polyunsaturated fatty acids and omega 3 fatty acid, and the daily added sugar intake was found to be related to the increase in MetS. Unexpectedly, the physical activity level was not found to significantly differ in the patients with and without MetS. In conclusion, the MetS prevalence was found to be increased among schizophrenia patients over time, and the increase in the young age group was particularly striking. Among all of the factors investigated, nutritional status was found to play a major role in this increased prevalence.
High fructose intake from soft drinks and sweets is assumed to have a negative impact on human health. Yet in spite of intensive research, the molecular mechanisms of these effects have not been fully elucidated yet, for example, the effect of high fructose intake could be different in normal and obese individuals. Four groups of mice were used in this study: control groups of lean mice and mice with obesity induced by a high-fat diet, then both of these groups with or without fructose administration in drinks. In plasma of each group, triacylglycerol, cholesterol, free fatty acids, alanine aminotransferase, insulin and adiponectin were measured. The expression levels of selected microRNAs (miRNAs) in plasma, the liver, white adipose tissue, brown adipose tissue and subcutaneous adipose tissue were quantified. In both lean and obese mice, high fructose intake increased cholesterol amount in the liver, up-regulated hepatic miR-27a, down-regulated miR-33a in white adipose tissue and increased plasmatic level of miR-21. The effect of high fructose intake on other miRNAs in the liver, plasma and adipose tissues differed in normal and obese mice. Fructose intake led to hepatic hypercholesterolemia and aberrant expression of several miRNAs participating in lipid metabolism, adipocytes differentiation and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease promotion. The effect of fructose on miRNAs expression differed in normal and obese mice. Nevertheless, plasmatic miR-21, which was induced by fructose in both lean and obese mice, may be considered as a potential biomarker of excessive fructose intake.
Natural compounds such as caffeine (CA), gallic acid (GA) and tannic acid (TA) have been reported to be useful for Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapy. It was proved that some natural compounds inhibit the formation of senil plaques composed by beta-amyloid peptide (AŒ≤), a hallmark of AD. Evidences suggest that the therapeutic activity of compounds depends of their interaction with biological membranes. To understand why these compounds fail in vivo and in clinical trials, it is important to evaluate their pharmacokinetics properties. Thus, a biophysical approach to study drug-membrane interactions is essential to understand the mechanisms by which the drugs interact with the cellular membranes and affect the AŒ≤ production, aggregation and clearance pathways. 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) and cholesterol (chol) were used to mimic the biophysical properties of cell membranes and study their interactions with these compounds. The partition coefficient, influence on membrane fluidity and location within the bilayer of the drugs were studied by derivative spectrophotometry, dynamic light scattering and fluorescence quenching, respectively. The results suggest that TA exhibited a significant higher partition than CA and GA and a preferential location near to the polar head of bilayer. The obtained results may explain the therapeutic mechanisms reported for these natural compounds.
Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have been associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D), but causality is uncertain.
Within longitudinal population-based data from northern Sweden, we assessed how POPs associated with T2D prospectively and cross-sectionally, and further investigated factors related to individual changes in POP concentrations.
For 129 case-controls pairs matched by age, sex and date of sampling, plasma concentrations of hexachlorobenzene (HCB), dichlorodiphenyl-dichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE), dioxin-like (DL) polychlorinated biphenyl congeners (PCB-118 and PCB-156), and non-dioxin like (NDL-PCB: PCB-74, -99, -138 -153, -170, -180, -183 and PCB-187) were analyzed twice (baseline and follow-up, 9-20 years apart). The cases received their T2D diagnose between baseline and follow-up. Prospective (using baseline data) and cross-sectional (using follow-up data) odds ratios (ORs) for T2D on lipid standardized POPs (HCB, p,p'-DDE, ‚àëDL-PCBs, ‚àëNDL-PCBs) were estimated using conditional logistic regression, adjusting for body mass index (BMI) and plasma lipids. The influence of BMI, weight-change, and plasma lipids on longitudinal changes in POP concentrations were evaluated among non-diabetic individuals (n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ306).
POPs were associated with T2D in both the prospective and cross-sectional assessments. Of a standard deviation increase in POPs, prospective ORs ranged 1.42 (95% CI: 0.99, 2.06) for ‚àëNDL-PCBs to 1.55 (95% CI: 1.01, 2.38) for HCB (p‚ÄØ&lt;‚ÄØ0.05 only for HCB), and cross-sectional ORs ranged 1.62 (95% CI: 1.13; 2.32) for p,p'-DDE to 2.06 (95% CI: 1.29, 3.28) for ‚àëDL-PCBs (p‚ÄØ&lt;‚ÄØ0.05 for all POPs). In analyses of non-diabetic individuals, higher baseline BMI, decreased weight and decreased plasma lipid concentrations were associated with a slower decrease of POPs. Cases had, besides a higher BMI, reduced cholesterol and weight gain at follow-up compared to controls, which can explain the higher ORs in the cross-sectional assessments.
The association between POPs and T2D was confirmed, but an indication that individuals body fat history might influence POP-T2D associations weakens the epidemiological support for a causal association. It also warrants studies based on other exposure metrics than biomonitoring. In addition, we note that a cross-sectional design overestimates the ORs if T2D cases have successfully intervened on weight and/or blood lipids, as changes in these factors cause changes in POPs.
Epidemiological data showing that high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is inversely associated with cardiovascular disease have led to the idea that cholesterol contained in this lipoprotein may be protective. Against, recent evidence suggests that the athero-protection from HDLs may result from other functions, unrelated to the carried cholesterol. HDL accessory proteins, such as paraoxonase 1 (PON1), have been suggested to endows HDL with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and to contribute to the athero-protective function of the lipoprotein. We aimed to evaluate whether extreme fluctuation in HDL-C levels correlates with PON1 activity.
Levels of PON1-related arylesterase and lactonase were assessed in subjects with primary hyperalphalipoproteinemia (HAL, HDL-C&gt;90th percentile), hypoalphalipoproteinemia (HA, HDL-C&lt;10th percentile) and controls. Cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) through several pathways and other metabolic parameters and markers of vascular disease were also determined.
Despite the marked change in HDL-C and Apoliprotein A1 (APO A1) (p‚ÄØ&lt;‚ÄØ0.001 for all comparisons), arylesterase and lactonase were only slightly increased in HAL compared with HA subjects (p‚ÄØ&lt;‚ÄØ0.05), but not vs. controls. This change in PON1 activities was no longer significant after adjustment for either HDL-C or APO A1. Both enzymatic activities were positively associated only with aqueous diffusion CEC (r‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.318, p‚ÄØ&lt;‚ÄØ0.05 and r‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.355, p‚ÄØ&lt;‚ÄØ0.05, respectively) and negatively with the presence of plaques (p‚ÄØ&lt;‚ÄØ0.05).
We showed that extreme high/low HDL-C levels are not associated with equal increase/decrease in PON1 activities. This enzyme appears to contribute to the HDL role in reverse cholesterol transport and anti-atherosclerosis processes. Further investigation is required to corroborate our findings.
Beet leaves and stalks are rich in polyphenols; however, their effect on risk factors for cardiovascular disease in humans, to our knowledge, has not yet been investigated. The aim of this study was to analyze the acute effect of beet leaves and stalk juice, containing different concentrations of polyphenols, on lipemia, glycemic control, nitric oxide concentration, and blood pressure in patients with dyslipidemia after a high-fat meal.
In a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover pilot study, patients 20 to 59 y of age with dyslipidemia were fed a single high-fat meal supplemented with either a placebo or one of two organic beet leaves and stalk juices rich in polyphenols (32 or 77.5 mg EAG/100 mL) with a 1-wk washout. Thus, each group was composed of 13 patients. Blood samples were obtained at fasting and 30, 60, 120, and 180 min after intervention. Total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, triacylglycerols, glucose, insulin, nitrite and nitrate, and blood pressure were assessed at each time period. The high-fat meal increased triacylglycerol levels after 120 (P &lt; 0.001) and 180 min (P &lt; 0.001) and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol after 60 min (P &lt; 0.05). This reduction was attenuated in both groups that received BLS juices after 120 min (P‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.005). A reduction in diastolic blood pressure within groups that received BLS juice was also observed.
There was no significant difference between groups for other biomarkers.
The beet leaves and stalk juice attenuated the reduction of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol induced by a high-fat meal.
Dyslipidemia is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Fucoidan (FUC) is a polysaccharide extracted from brown marine algae with various biological activities. Galactooligosaccharides (GOS) are important prebiotics that exert benefits on the intestinal microbiota. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of FUC and GOS on dyslipidemia in rats by modulating the gut microbiota and bile acid metabolism.
Twenty-four male inbred Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats aged 8 wk were fed a normal or high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 wk. During the feeding period, rats were gavaged with normal saline solution, FUC solution (100 mg/kg),or GOS solution (800 mg/kg), or a combination of both once daily. Serum biochemical parameters were determined, and the gut microbiota were analyzed via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity in the small intestinal contents was also analyzed. The effects of FUC and GOS on Lactobacillus casei DM8121 were analyzed in vitro.
In rats, GOS and FUC supplementation significantly improved serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, lipopolysaccharide, serum total bile acid, hepatic tissue steatosis, aortic arch injury, gut microbiota, serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, cholesterol 7-alpha hydroxylase expression in the liver, and BSH activity in the small intestinal contents. In an in vitro experiment, GOS and FUC supplementation significantly increased L. casei DM8121's BSH activity.
In rats, FUC and GOS supplementation improved serum dyslipidemia, gut microbiota, BSH activity, and bile acid metabolism-related pathways. In vitro, GOS and FUC supplementation increased L. casei DM8121's BSH activity.
Some adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been related to basal and adiponectin levels and metabolic parameters. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the genetic variant rs1501299 ADIPOQ gene on biochemical changes after weight loss secondary to a high-protein and low-carbohydrate diet versus a standard severe hypocaloric diet over 9 mo as the primary endpoint.
A white population of 270 obese patients was enrolled in a randomized clinical trial with two hypocaloric diets (high-protein and low carbohydrate diet [HP] versus standard diet [S]) over 9 mo of intervention. The statistical analysis was performed for the combined GT and TT as a group (T-allele carriers) and GG as second group (non-T-allele carriers). Before and after 12 wk on each hypocaloric diet, an anthropometric evaluation, an assessment of nutritional intake, and a biochemical analysis were realized.
With both dietary interventions, body weight, body mass index (BMI), fat mass, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and leptin levels decreased. In non-T-allele carriers after both diets, the decrease in total cholesterol levels -12.3 ¬± 2.2 mg/dL (T-allele carriers -6.9 ¬± 2.1 mg/dL; P‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.01 diet HP) and 12.2 ¬± 3.1 mg/dL (T-allele carriers -4.7 ¬± 1.2 mg/dL; P‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.02 after diet S), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol -13.2 ¬± 2.7 mg/dL (T-allele carriers -6.1 ¬± 2.1 mg/dL; P‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.02 after diet HP) and -9.3 ¬± 1.8 mg/dL (T-allele carriers -4.8 ¬± 2.9 mg/dL; P‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.01 after diet S), triacylglycerol levels -12.7 ¬± 6.1 mg/dL (T-allele carriers -6 ¬± 2.9 mg/dL; P‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.01 after diet HP) and -16.3 ¬± 7.2 mg/dL (T-allele carriers -5.3 ¬± 1.4 mg/dL; P‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.03 after diet S), insulin levels -5 ¬± 1.1 mUI/L (in T-allele -1.7 ¬± 0.9 mUI/L; P‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.02 after diet HP) and -3.2 1.1 mUI/L (T-allele carriers -0.7 ¬± 0.7 mUI/L; P‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.02 after diet S), and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance levels -0.4 ¬± 0.2 units (T-allele group -0.1 ¬± 0.1; P‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.04 after diet HP) and -0.7 ¬± 0.1 units (T-allele carriers -0.1 ¬± 0.5 mg/dL; P‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.01 after diet S) was higher than T-allele carriers. Only no T-allele carriers showed an increase in adiponectin levels after both diets.
After two different hypocaloric diets during 9 mo of intervention, the GG genotype of an ADIPOQ gene variant (rs1501299) is related to better improvement in adiponectin levels, insulin resistance, and lipid profile than T-allele carriers.
Cholesterol plays an essential role in determining cell membrane physico-chemical characteristics and functions. A proper membrane structure is critical in pancreatic Œ≤-cells for glucose-mediated insulin secretion, and alterations in cellular cholesterol content may negatively affect this process, leading to Œ≤-cell dysfunction. The low density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) appears to play a relevant role in √ü-cell dysfunction due to cholesterol accumulation. This observation raised the question of whether hypocholesterolemic drugs which increase LDL-R expression might bear diabetogenic properties, thus increasing the risk of new-onset diabetes or worsen glycaemic parameters in diabetic patients. Being at higher cardiovascular risk, diabetic patients are usually treated with hypolipidemic drugs to correct the atherogenic dyslipidemia characteristic of this pathological condition. Statin therapy has been associated with an increased incidence of new-onset diabetes (NOD), being the diabetogenic effect depending on the type and dose of statin. However, it is worth noting that the benefits on cardiovascular mortality largely exceed the increased risk associated with the development of diabetes. Although genetic variants associated with lower levels of LDL-C are also associated with an increased NOD risk, clinical trials with lipid-lowering drugs other than statins, namely ezetimibe or monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9, did not observe an increase of developing diabetes. In summary, molecular evidence clearly points to a key role for cholesterol homeostasis in pancreatic Œ≤-cell function which, in humans, is negatively affected by statins. Available data exclude that this could be the case for other hypocholesterolemic approaches, but long-term studies are warranted to explore this critical aspect.
A 10-week growth trial was conducted to investigate the effects of replacing dietary fishmeal with plant proteins on nutrition metabolism, immunity, inflammation and apoptosis responses in liver tissues of Japanese seabass, Lateolabrax japonicas (initial body weight‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ10.42‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ0.01‚ÄØg). Two isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets were formulated. A basal diet containing 54% fishmeal (FM), whereas another diet was prepared by totally replacing FM with a plant protein blend (PP) composed with soybean protein concentrate and cottonseed protein concentrate. Although essential amino acids, fatty acids, and available phosphorus had been balanced according to the FM diet profile, the significantly lower growth performance, metabolic disorder, and fatty liver symptom were observed in the PP group. Compared with the FM group, fish in the PP group showed significantly lower plasma free EAA level and PPV. Glucose metabolism disorder was expressed as the uncontrollable fasting glycolysis and pyruvate aerobic oxidation at postprandial 24‚ÄØh with significantly up-regulated GK, PK and PDH genes expression, which potentially over-produced acetyl-CoA as the substrate for protein and lipid synthesis. Significantly reduced plasma GLU, but increased GC level, along with very significantly reduced liver GLY storage could be observed in the PP group. Plasma TG and hepatic NEFA contents were significantly decreased, but the hepatic TC content was very significantly increased in the PP group, in addition, hepatocyte vacuolation appeared. The significantly up-regulated cholesterol synthesis gene (HMGCR) expression but down-regulated bile acid synthesis gene (CYP7A1) expression could be the main reason for the fatty liver induced by cholesterol accumulation. The reduced plasma IgM content accompanied by the up-regulated mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFŒ± and IL1Œ≤) and activated apoptosis signals of liver tissues were found in the PP group. The hyperthyroidism (higher plasma T3 and T4) and the accelerated energy metabolism rate decreased the growth performance in the PP group. The activated p65NF-kB may promote the hepatocytes apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway (caspase8/caspase3). Simultaneously, a "self-saving" response could be observed that activated cAMP promoted the lipolysis/Œ≤-oxidation process and up-regulated gene expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 via promoting CREB expression, further inhibited the over-phosphorylation of JNK protein, which might impede the intrinsic apoptosis pathway (caspase9/caspase3). In conclusion, the nutrient and energy metabolic disorder induced fatty liver related to the cholesterol accumulation in Japanese seabass fed full PP diet, which was under the regulation by cAMP-JNK/NF-kB-caspase signaling pathway. The hemostasis phosphorylation of JNK protein protected the liver tissues from more serious damage.
Acetaminophen overdose is a major cause of acute liver failure (ALF). Mitochondrial SH3BP5 (also called SAB) and phosphorylation of JNK mediate the hepatotoxic effects of acetaminophen. We investigated the involvement of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STARD1), a mitochondrial cholesterol transporter, in this process and sensitization by valproic acid (VPA), which depletes glutathione and stimulates steroidogenesis.
Non-fasted C57BL/6J mice (control) and mice with liver-specific deletion of STARD1 (Stard1ŒîHep), (SabŒîHep), or JNK1 and JNK2 (Jnk1+2ŒîHep) were given VPA with or without acetaminophen. Liver tissues were collected and analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry and for SH3BP5 acetaminophen metabolism, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and mitochondrial function. Adult human hepatocytes were transplanted into FRGN mice to create mice with humanized livers.
Administration of VPA before administration of acetaminophen increased the severity of liver damage in control mice. The combination of VPA and acetaminophen increased expression of CYP2E1, formation of NAPQI protein adducts, and depletion of glutathione from liver tissues of control mice, resulting in ER stress and the upregulation of STARD1. Livers from control mice given VPA and acetaminophen accumulated cholesterol in the mitochondria and had sustained mitochondrial depletion of glutathione and mitochondrial dysfunction. Inhibition of ER stress, by administration of tauroursodeoxycholic acid to control mice, prevented upregulation of STARD1 in liver and protected the mice from hepatoxicity following administration of VPA and acetaminophen. Administration of N-acetylcysteine to control mice prevented VPA- and acetaminophen-induced ER stress and liver injury. Stard1ŒîHep mice were resistant to induction of ALF by VPA and acetaminophen, despite increased mitochondrial levels of glutathione and phosphorylated JNK; we made similar observations in fasted Stard1ŒîHep mice given acetaminophen alone. SabŒîHep mice or Jnk1+2ŒîHep mice did not develop ALF following administration of VPA and acetaminophen. The ability of VPA to increase the severity of acetaminophen-induced liver damage was observed in FRGN mice with humanized liver.
In studies of mice, we found that upregulation of STARD1 following ER stress mediates acetaminophen hepatoxicity via SH3BP5 and phosphorylation of JNK1 and JNK2.
Albeit its well known potency as a postmenopausal osteoporosis treatment, Risedronate suffers from poor oral bioavailability and high oral toxicity. This is the first work to assess the potential of bilosomes to address challenges of RS oral delivery. Furthermore, impact of integrating cationic moiety into bilosomes on intestinal digestability and toxicity of RS nanovesicles was first investigated in this article. Prepared formulations were optimized based on physicochemical properties, digestibility, intestinal permeation and local toxicity studies. Optimized preparations were prepared by reversed phase evaporation technique with three extrusion cycles and loaded by 10‚ÄØmg/ml RS. Molar lipid to bile salt to cholesterol ratio was adjusted to 4:1:1 at pH 5. Addition of cholesterol had significantly improved bilosomes stability to digestive media. Results also revealed that permeation of anionic vesicles increased permeation by 1.5 times more than RS solution and reduced drug toxicity by 2 folds. On the other hand, Cationic bilosomes showed good stability in GIT fluids but their induced oral toxicity could limit their use. In conclusion, bilosomes are superior over liposomes regarding protection of delivery system from the damaging effect of external in digestive bile salts. In addition, it decreases toxicity issues of orally administered drugs.
Effective interventions are needed to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD) in people with severe mental illnesses (SMI) because their risk of CVD is higher than that of the general population.
(1) Develop and validate risk models for predicting CVD events in people with SMI and evaluate their cost-effectiveness, (2) develop an intervention to reduce levels of cholesterol and CVD risk in SMI and (3) test the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this new intervention in primary care.
Mixed methods with patient and public involvement throughout. The mixed methods were (1) a prospective cohort and risk score validation study and cost-effectiveness modelling, (2) development work (focus groups, updated systematic review of interventions, primary care database studies investigating statin prescribing and effectiveness) and (3) cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) assessing the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a new practitioner-led intervention, and fidelity assessment of audio-recorded appointments.
General practices across England.
All studies included adults with SMI (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or other non-organic psychosis). The RCT included adults with SMI and two or more CVD risk factors.
The intervention consisted of 8‚Äì12 appointments with a practice nurse/health-care assistant over 6 months, involving collaborative behavioural approaches to CVD risk factors. The intervention was compared with routine practice with a general practitioner (GP).
The primary outcome for the risk score work was CVD events, in the cost-effectiveness modelling it was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and in the RCT it was level of total cholesterol.
Databases studies used The Health Improvement Network (THIN). Intervention development work included focus groups and systematic reviews. The RCT collected patient self-reported and routine NHS GP data. Intervention appointments were audio-recorded.
Two CVD risk score models were developed and validated in 38,824 people with SMI in THIN: the Primrose lipid model requiring cholesterol levels, and the Primrose body mass index (BMI) model with no blood test. These models performed better than published Cox Framingham models. In health economic modelling, the Primrose BMI model was most cost-effective when used as an algorithm to drive statin prescriptions. Focus groups identified barriers to, and facilitators of, reducing CVD risk in SMI including patient engagement and motivation, staff confidence, involving supportive others, goal-setting and continuity of care. Findings were synthesised with evidence from updated systematic reviews to create the Primrose intervention and training programme. THIN cohort studies in 16,854 people with SMI demonstrated that statins effectively reduced levels of cholesterol, with similar effect sizes to those in general population studies over 12‚Äì24 months (mean decrease 1.2‚Äâmmol/l). Cluster RCT: 76 GP practices were randomised to the Primrose intervention (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ38) or treatment as usual (TAU) (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ38). The primary outcome (level of cholesterol) was analysed for 137 out of 155 participants in Primrose and 152 out of 172 in TAU. There was no difference in levels of cholesterol at 12 months [5.4‚Äâmmol/l Primrose vs. 5.5‚Äâmmol/l TAU; coefficient 0.03; 95% confidence interval (CI) ‚Äì0.22 to 0.29], nor in secondary outcomes related to cardiometabolic parameters, well-being or medication adherence. Mean cholesterol levels decreased over 12 months in both arms (‚Äì0.22‚Äâmmol/l Primrose vs. ‚Äì0.39‚Äâmmol/l TAU). There was a significant reduction in the cost of inpatient mental health attendances (‚Äì¬£799, 95% CI ‚Äì¬£1480 to ‚Äì¬£117) and total health-care costs (‚Äì¬£895, 95% CI ‚Äì¬£1631 to ‚Äì¬£160; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.012) in the intervention group, but no significant difference in QALYs (‚Äì0.011, 95% CI ‚Äì0.034 to 0.011). A total of 69% of patients attended two or more Primrose appointments. Audiotapes revealed moderate fidelity to intervention delivery (67.7%). Statin prescribing and adherence was rarely addressed.
RCT participants and practices may not represent all UK practices. CVD care in the TAU arm may have been enhanced by trial procedures involving CVD risk screening and feedback.
SMI-specific CVD risk scores better predict new CVD if used to guide statin prescribing in SMI. Statins are effective in reducing levels of cholesterol in people with SMI in UK clinical practice. This primary care RCT evaluated an evidence-based practitioner-led intervention that was well attended by patients and intervention components were delivered. No superiority was shown for the new intervention over TAU for level of cholesterol, but cholesterol levels decreased over 12 months in both arms and the intervention showed fewer inpatient admissions. There was no difference in cholesterol levels between the intervention and TAU arms, which might reflect better than standard general practice care in TAU, heterogeneity in intervention delivery or suboptimal emphasis on statins.
The new risk score should be updated, deployed and tested in different settings and compared with the latest versions of CVD risk scores in different countries. Future research on CVD risk interventions should emphasise statin prescriptions more. The mechanism behind lower costs with the Primrose intervention needs exploring, including SMI-related training and offering frequent support to people with SMI in primary care.

Chronic glucocorticoid overexposure predisposes to the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in humans. Cholestatic liver disease is associated with increased plasma glucocorticoid levels. Here we determined, in a preclinical setting, whether the chronic presence of cholestatic liver disease also induces a concomitant negative impact on atherosclerosis susceptibility. Hereto, regular chow diet-fed atherosclerosis-susceptible hypercholesterolemic apolipoprotein E (APOE) knockout mice were treated with the bile duct toxicant alpha‚Äënaphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT) for 8 weeks. ANIT exposure induced the development of fibrotic cholestatic liver disease as evident from collagen deposits and compensatory bile duct hyperproliferation within the liver and the rise in plasma levels of bilirubin (+60%; P&lt;0.01) and bile acids (10-fold higher; P&lt;0.01). Adrenal weights (+22%; P&lt;0.01) and plasma corticosterone levels (+72%; P&lt;0.01) were increased in ANIT-treated mice. In contrast, atherosclerosis susceptibility was not increased in response to ANIT feeding, despite the concomitant increase in plasma free cholesterol (+30%; P&lt;0.01) and cholesteryl ester (+42%; P&lt;0.001) levels. The ANIT-induced hypercorticosteronemia coincided with marked immunosuppression as judged from the 50% reduction (P&lt;0.001) in circulating lymphocyte numbers. However, hepatic glucocorticoid signaling was not enhanced after ANIT treatment. It thus appears that the immunosuppressive effect of glucocorticoids is uncoupled from their metabolic effect under cholestatic disease conditions. In conclusion, we have shown that cholestatic liver disease-associated endogenous glucocorticoid overexposure does not increase atherosclerosis susceptibility in APOE knockout mice. Our studies provide novel preclinical evidence for the observations that the hypercholesterolemia seen in cholestatic human subjects does not translate into a higher risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
Progress toward better diagnosis and treatment of lipid metabolism-related diseases requires high throughput approaches for multiplexed quantitative analysis of structurally diverse lipids, including phospholipids (PLs). This work demonstrates a simplified "one-pot" phospholipid extraction protocol, as an alternative to conventional liquid-liquid extraction. Performed in a 96-well format, the extraction was coupled with high throughput UPLC and multiplexed tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) detection, allowing non-targeted quantification of phosphatidylcholines (PC), sphingomyelins (SM), lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC), phosphatidylethanolamines (PE), and phosphatidylinositols (PI). Using 50‚ÄØŒºL aliquots of serum samples from 110 individuals, lipoproteins were fractionated by size, and analyzed for phospholipids and non-polar lipids including free cholesterol (FC), cholesteryl esters (CEs) and triglycerides (TGs). Analysis of serum samples with wide range of Total-TG levels showed significant differences in PL composition. The correlations of molar ratios in lipoprotein size fractions, SM/PL with FC/PL, PE/PL with TG/CE, and PE/PL with PI/PL, demonstrate the applicability of the method for quantitative composition analysis of high, low and very-low density lipoproteins (HDL, LDL and VLDL), and characterization of lipid metabolism related disease states.
Xiao Yao San (XYS) is thought to be beneficial for the treatment of hypertension in China.
A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of XYS in hypertension.
A comprehensive literature search was conducted in 7 electronic databases for randomized controlled trials from their inception until January 7, 2019.
Methodological quality was assessed independently using the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.
A total of 17 trials including 1460 hypertensive patients met the selection criteria. Pooled analysis favored XYS plus antihypertensive drugs on blood pressure (BP), Hamilton anxiety scale, self-rating anxiety scale, self-rating depression scale, 9-item patient health questionnaire scale, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, homocysteine, and C-reactive protein. No significant difference between XYS plus antihypertensive drugs and antihypertensive drugs on major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events was identified. XYS was well tolerated in the treatment of hypertension.
XYS adjuvant to antihypertensive drugs maybe beneficial for hypertensive patients in lowering BP, improving depression, regulating blood lipids, and inhibiting inflammation. However, the efficacy and safety of XYS are still uncertain due to methodological shortcomings. More long-term, randomized, double-blinded clinical trials are needed in future studies.
Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions that increase risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Among genetic factors that contributed to incidence of metabolic syndrome, Polymorphisms of Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) are major candidates especially because of their effect on obesity and dyslipidemia. S447X (rs328) and Hind III (rs320) Polymorphisms of LPL gene have been reported to change LPL activity, resulting in altered triglyceride (TG) and high density lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. This study investigates the effects of these gene polymorphisms on factors affecting metabolic syndrome in northern population of Iran.
Studied population included 223 adults consisting 90 women and 133 men with body mass index (BMI)‚ÄØ‚â•‚ÄØ30‚ÄØkg/m2 as obese subjects, and 156 healthy participants as a control group with BMI &lt;25 that included 68 women and 88 men. All factors causing metabolic syndrome were evaluated. Also DNA was extracted from blood samples and HindIII and S447X LPL gene polymorphisms were screened by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method (PCR-RFLP).
The present study proves that some genotypes of HindIII were associated with a reduced risk of developing low HDL-C only in men, while the protective effects of S447X on hypertriglyceridemia were only seen in women. The point is that this relation is affected by the weight profile of the participants. It can be concluded that there is a gender-related relation between the polymorphisms of LPL gene and the risk factors for incidence of metabolic syndrome in the northern population of Iran.
Clostridium difficile associated disease (CDAD) is the leading infectious cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis in the United States. Both the incidence and severity of CDAD have been increased over the past two decades. We evaluated the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and toxicokinetics of OG253, a novel lantibiotic in development for the treatment of CDAD. OG253 was orally administered to Wistar Han rats as enteric-coated capsules in a one-day dose escalation study, followed by a seven-day repeated dose toxicokinetics study. All three doses of OG253 (6.75, 27 and 108‚ÄØmg/day) were generally well-tolerated with no treatment-related clinical signs, alterations in body weight or food consumption in both one-day acute tolerability and seven-days repeated dose tolerability and toxicokinetics study. OG253 capsule administration neither significantly alter the weight of organs nor affect the hematology, coagulation, clinical biochemistry parameters and urine pH compared to placebo capsule administered rats. LC-MS/MS analysis did not detect OG253 in the plasma, indicating that OG253 is not absorbed into blood from the rat gastrointestinal tract. Glandular atrophy of the rectal mucosa was noticed in two out of six rats administered with a high dose of OG253. Surprisingly, we found that OG253 treatment significantly lowered both serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels in both sexes of rats. Overall, there was a 29.8 and 61.38% decrease in the serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels, respectively as compared to placebo-treated rats. The well tolerated high dose of OG253 (425.7‚ÄØmg/kg/day) is recommended as the MTD for safety and efficacy studies. Further preclinical study is needed to evaluate the safety profile of OG253 under longer exposure.
This study examined a range of anthropometric indices and their relationships with metabolic syndrome (MetS). Despite recommendations that central obesity assessment should be employed as a marker of metabolic health, there is no consensus regarding the protocol for measurement. The present study included 720 men aged 71 ¬± 8 years and 919 women aged 71 ¬± 7 years from a rural village. We examined the relationship between anthropometric indices {e.g., body mass index (BMI), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), waist-to-hip ratio (WHpR)}, and MetS based on the modified criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP-ATP) III report in a cross-sectional (N = 1,639) and cohort (N = 377) data. A receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis was performed to determine the optimal cut-off value and best discriminatory value of each of these anthropometric indices to predict MetS. In the cross-sectional study, WHtR as well as BMI and WHpR showed significantly predictive abilities for MetS in both genders; and WHtR showed the strongest predictive ability for the presence of MetS. Also in the cohort study, WHtR as well as BMI and WHpR showed significantly predictive abilities for incident MetS in both genders, and in men WHtR showed the strongest predictive ability for incident MetS, but in women BMI showed the strongest predictive ability. In the cross-sectional study, the optimal WHtR cutoff values were 0.52 (sensitivity, 71.0%; specificity, 77.9%) for men and 0.53 (sensitivity, 79.8%; specificity, 75.7%) for women. In the cohort study, the optimal WHtR values were 0.50 (sensitivity, 60.7%; specificity, 73.2%) for men and 0.50 (sensitivity, 75.0%; specificity, 56.1%) for women. Increased WHtR was significantly and independently associated with prevalence of MetS in both genders. These results suggest that WHtR is a useful screening tool for determining metabolic risk in Japanese elderly community dwelling individuals.

                        Background:
                     The relationship between insulin resistance and hypertension is well established, but the association of different surrogate insulin resistance indexes with the presence of hypertension is still under debate. The aim of this study was to compare the strength of the association between the presence of hypertension and six indexes: triglyceride/HDL cholesterol ratio (TG/HDL-C), Triglyceride Glucose (TyG) Index, Visceral adiposity index (VAI), Lipid accumulation product (LAP), TyG-Body mass index (TyG-BMI), and TyG-Waist circumference (TyG-WC). 
                        Methods:
                     Data from a cross-sectional epidemiological study enrolling a sample representative for the Romanian population aged 18-80 years, excluding those with diabetes or requiring treatment for hypertriglyceridemia, were used to calculate the six indexes. The association with the presence of hypertension was examined with binomial and multinomial logistic regression. 
                        Results:
                     In multinomial logistic models, which included age, gender, smoking, drinking, sedentary lifestyle, estimated glomerular filtration rate, urinary sodium, urinary albumin creatinine ratio, and use of medications known to influence insulin resistance as covariates, all individual components and surrogate insulin resistance indexes were independently associated with the presence of hypertension. Values of pseudo R square ranged from 0.342 for the multivariate model including TG/HDL-C to 0.357 for the model including TyG-WC, but with no clear superiority of any of the tested indexes over all others. Models including BMI and WC had a similar ability to predict the presence of hypertension as most of the surrogate indexes and they were slightly superior to TG/HDL-C and TyG. 
                        Conclusions:
                     Although TG/HDL-C, VAI, LAP, TyG, TyG-BMI, and TyG-WC were independently associated with the presence of hypertension, no superiority could be demonstrated over the use of BMI and WC as predictors of hypertension in this cross-sectional study.
To compare the effect of low-volume HIIT to moderate-intensity aerobic training (MICT) on fat mass, cardiometabolic profile and physical capacity and confirm its feasibility in older women.
Inactive older women (60-75 years) were randomly assigned to 8 weeks of either HIIT (75 min/week; n=9) or MICT (150 min/week; n=9). Body composition, fasting metabolic profile, cardiovascular risk (Framingham score), and physical capacity (senior fitness test, VO2peak) were assessed before and after the intervention. Feasibility was evaluated with completion rate (training compliance; dropout rate) and affective response (Feeling scale; pre- and post-exercise).
Total cholesterol, non-HDL-C levels and the Framingham risk score decreased in both groups (all p‚â§0.03). Although VO2peak remained unchanged, the 6MWT distance increased (p&lt;0.0001), irrespective of the group. Completion rate and affective responses were not different between groups (all p‚â•0.38).
A short-term HIIT program is feasible and provides as much benefits as MICT in older women.
To assess visualization of the intracranial arteries and internal carotid artery (ICA) on 3-D time-of-flight (TOF) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) images obtained at 1.5 T and to investigate factors that affect the image quality of those arteries in dogs.
39 dogs with idiopathic epilepsy.
Each dog underwent 3-D TOF MRA, and 5 pairs of intracranial arteries, the basilar artery, and both ICAs were evaluated. Each artery was assigned an image-quality score on a scale of 0 to 3, where 0 = poor and 3 = excellent. Multivariable regression analysis was used to assess whether age, body weight (BW), serum total cholesterol concentration, intracranial volume (ICV), and mean arterial pressure were significantly associated with the image quality of each vessel.
In all dogs, the image-quality score was 2 or 3 for the proximal middle cerebral arteries, basilar artery, and caudal aspect of the caudal communicating arteries. In some dogs, the rostral cerebellar arteries, rostral aspect of the caudal communicating arteries, and middle and rostral aspects of the ICA were poorly visualized. For various arteries, image quality was negatively associated with age and positively associated with BW and ICV.
Results indicated that 3-D TOF MRA images obtained at 1.5 T did not consistently and clearly delineate the ICA and narrow or peripheral intracranial arteries of dogs; therefore, careful attention is required when such images are assessed. Patient age, BW, and ICV can also affect the image quality of some intracranial arteries on 3-D TOF MRA images. (Am J Vet Res 2019;80:480-489).
Urinary phosphorus excretion has been proposed as a recovery biomarker of dietary phosphorus intake. However, it is unclear whether phosphorus excretion is constant across a range of dietary and nondietary factors.
We assessed whether percentage urinary phosphorus excretion is constant across 3 dietary patterns in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) trial.
DASH is a completed feeding study of 459 prehypertensive and stage 1 hypertensive adults (52% male, 56% black). After a 3-wk run-in on a typical American (control) diet, participants were randomly assigned to the control diet, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables (FV diet), or a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy with reduced saturated fat and cholesterol (DASH diet) for 8 wk. We estimated the percentage phosphorus excretion as urinary phosphorus excretion (from 24 h urine) divided by phosphorus intake (from analyzed food composites). Differences between group means for all 3 diets were compared by ANOVA followed by pairwise comparisons with Tukey's honest significant difference test.
At the end of the intervention, the mean phosphorus intake was 1176 mg/d (95% CI: 1119, 1233 mg/d), 1408 mg/d (1352, 1464 mg/d), and 2051 mg/d (1994, 2107 mg/d) in the control, FV, and DASH diet, respectively (P¬†&lt;¬†0.001, all comparisons). The mean phosphorus excretion was 734 mg/d (682, 787 mg/d), 705 mg/d (654, 756 mg/d), and 872 mg/d (820, 923 mg/d) in the control, FV, and DASH diet, respectively (P¬†=¬†0.74 control vs. FV, P¬†&lt;¬†0.001 all other comparisons). The mean percentage phosphorus excretion was 63% (60%, 67%), 51% (48%, 54%), and 43% (39%, 46%) in the control, FV, and DASH diet, respectively (P¬†&lt;¬†0.001, all comparisons).
These findings in prehypertensive and stage 1 hypertensive adults strongly suggest that urinary phosphorus excretion should not be used as a recovery biomarker for dietary phosphorus intake, given the wide range of urinary phosphorus excretion across dietary patterns. This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT0000054.
Based on compelling data from animal and human studies, over the past few decades, the viewpoint of atherosclerosis as an exclusively lipid-driven disease, has been gradually replaced by the concept of a chronic low-grade inflammatory process of the arterial wall. This review presents a brief description on the role of inflammation in atherosclerosis, and examines selected anti-inflammatory interventions that have been tested in clinical trials designed to prevent adverse cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and excess CVD risk.
The Canakinumab Anti-inflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study trial has provided convincing evidence that neutralization of the interleukin (IL)-1Œ≤ inflammatory pathway by the selective antibody canakinumab reduces major CVD events and significantly lowers IL-1Œ≤, IL-6 and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, without affecting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. In contrast, in the latest Cardiovascular Inflammation Reduction Trial, low-dose methotrexate compared with placebo did not reduce CVD events, probably because there was no reduction in IL-1Œ≤, or in downstream inflammatory biomarker levels either.
Notwithstanding the utilization of effective medical treatments including statins and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors or precise revascularizations, the recurrence of CVD events remains unacceptably high. Canakinumab is, at present, the only anti-inflammatory agent that has been proven to reduce cardiovascular events in patients with elevated markers of inflammation without modifying cholesterol levels. Nevertheless, clinical application related to this new evidence and associated knowledge has not yet been implemented in daily practice.
Cholesterol is a major component of the membrane and a key regulator of many ion channels. Multiple studies showed that cholesterol regulates ion channels in a stereospecific manner, with cholesterol but not its chiral isomers having a functional effect. This stereospecificity has been universally attributed to the specificity of cholesterol binding, with the assumption that only native cholesterol binds to the channels whereas its isomers do not. In this study, we challenge this paradigm by docking analyses of cholesterol and its chiral isomers to five ion channels whose response to cholesterol was shown to be stereospecific, Kir2.2, KirBac1.1, TRPV1, GABAA and BK. The analysis is performed using AutoDock Vina to predict the binding poses and energies of the sterols to the channels and identify amino acids interacting with the sterol molecules. We found that for every ion channel tested herein all three sterols showed similar binding poses and significant overlap in the set of the amino acids that comprise the predicted binding sites, along with similar energetic favorability to these overlapping sites. We also found, however, that specific orientations of the three sterols within the binding sites of the channels are distinct, so that a subset of the interacting amino acids is unique to each sterol. We propose therefore, that contrary to previous thought, stereospecific effects of cholesterol should be attributed not to the lack of binding of the stereoisomers but to specific, unique interactions between the cholesterol molecule and the residues within the binding sites of the channels.
Increased plasma free fatty acids (FFAs) and liver triglyceride (TG) accumulations have been implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis. On the other hand, trace elements function as essential cofactors that are involved in various biochemical processes in mammals, including metabolic homeostasis. Notably, clinical and animal studies suggest that the plasma levels of bromide negatively correlate with those of TG, total cholesterol (TC) and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C). However, the effect of bromide on lipid accumulation and the direct molecular target responsible for its action remains unknown. Oil red O (ORO) and Nile red staining were used to detect the effect of bromide on lipid accumulation in mouse primary hepatocytes (PHs) treated with different doses of sodium bromide (NaBr) in the presence of FFAs (0.4¬†mM oleate/palmitic acid 1:1). Spectrophotometric and fluorometric analyses were performed to assess cellular TG concentrations and rates of fatty acid oxidation (FAO), respectively, in mouse PHs. We found that bromide decreased FFA-induced lipid accumulation and increased FFA-inhibited oxygen consumptions in mouse PHs in a dose-dependent manner via activation of PPARŒ±. Mechanical studies demonstrated that bromide decreased the phosphorylation levels of JNK. More importantly, the PPARŒ±-specific inhibitor GW6471 partially abolished the beneficial effects of bromide on mouse PHs. Bromide alleviates FFA-induced excessive lipid storage and increases rates of FAO through the activation of PPARŒ±/JNK signals in mouse PHs. Therefore, bromide may serve as a novel drug in the treatment of hepatic steatosis.
CYP1A1 rs1048943 polymorphism was reported to be correlated with periodontitis; however, its association with aggressive periodontitis (AgP) has not yet been investigated. The aim of the study was to investigate the association between the CYP1A1 gene rs1048943 variant with generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAgP) and platelet activation and analyse whether its interaction with hyperlipidemia affects periodontal status in a Chinese population.
A case-control study of 224 GAgP patients and 139 healthy controls was conducted. The clinical parameters of probing depth (PD), attachment loss (AL) and bleeding index (BI) were recorded. Platelet count (PLT), platelet distribution width (PDW), platelet large cell ratio (PLCR), mean platelet volume (MPV), serum total cholesterol (TC), triacylglycerol (TG), high and low-density lipoprotein (HDL and LDL) were also measured. The CYP1A1 rs1048943 SNP was genotyped by time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Logistic and linear regression models were used to measure correlation.
The CYP1A1 rs1048943 AG/GG genotype was associated with GAgP (OR¬†=¬†1.56, 95%CI: 1.01, 2.42), PD, AL and decreased PDW, PLCR and MPV after adjustment for covariates. Gene-lipid interactions were found between CYP1A1 rs1048943 and HDL for PD (Pinteraction¬† =¬†0.0033), BI (Pinteraction¬† =¬†0.0311) and AL (Pinteraction¬† =¬†0.0141) and between CYP1A1 rs1048943 and LDL for PD (Pinteraction¬† =¬†0.013) among patients with GAgP.
The G allele of the CYP1A1 rs1048943 gene was associated with GAgP, periodontal status and platelet-related inflammation status in a Chinese population. Hyperlipidemia could modulate the effect of CYP1A1 rs1048943 on the periodontal status of GAgP.
Cannabidiol (CBD), an abundant nonpsychoactive constituent of marijuana, has been reported previously to protect against hepatic steatosis. In this study, we studied further the functions and mechanisms of CBD on liver inflammation induced by HFC diet. Mice feeding an HFC diet for 8 weeks were applied to test the protective effect of CBD on livers. RAW264.7 cells were incubated with LPS‚Äâ+‚ÄâATP‚Äâ¬±‚ÄâCBD to study the mechanisms of the effect of CBD against inflammasome activation. We found that CBD alleviated liver inflammation induced by HFC diet. CBD significantly inhibited the nuclear factor-Œ∫appa B (NF-Œ∫B) p65 nuclear translocation and the activation of nucleotide-binding domain like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome both in vivo and in vitro studies, which lead to the reduction of the expression of inflammation-related factors in our studies. In addition, Inhibitor of activation of NF-Œ∫B partly suppressed the NLRP3 inflammasome activation, while adding CBD further inhibited NF-Œ∫B activation and correspondingly suppressed the NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages. In conclusion, the suppression of the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome through deactivation of NF-Œ∫B in macrophages by CBD might be one mechanism of its anti-inflammatory function in the liver.
To investigate the prevalence and influencing factors of hyperuricemia among natural gas drilling workers in Northwest Sichuan gas field.
A census of 1051 natural gas drilling workers in Northwest Sichuan gas field at an average altitude of 2552 meters was conducted in the survey, the serum uric acid, fasting blood glucose, blood lipid, creatinine and hemoglobin were detected. A staff canteen was randomly selected and the method of weighing and 24-hour dietary review were used for dietary survey. The blood biochemical level and dietary intake of subjects with different blood uric acid levels were compared, and the influencing factors of hyperuricemia were analyzed by Logistic regression model.
(1)There were 513 hyperuricemia patients in natural gas drilling workers, with a detection rate of 48. 8%. (2)The levels of fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, triglyceride, creatinine and hemoglobin in the hyperuricemia group were higher than those in the normouricemia group. The risk of hyperuricemia in patients with diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, elevated serum creatinine and hemoglobin were 3. 57(95%CI 2. 45-4. 67), 2. 88(95%CI 1. 99-4. 16), 1. 93(95%CI 1. 30-2. 86), 1. 61(95%CI 1. 01-2. 51)and 2. 54(95%CI 2. 11-3. 36)times of normal fasting blood glucose, blood lipid, serum creatinine and hemoglobin, respectively(P&lt;0. 05). (3)The intakes of meat, oil and salt in the hyperuricemia group were higher than those in the normouricemia group, while the intakes of vegetables, milk products and vitamin B were lower than those in the normouricemia group(P&lt;0. 05). Intake of vegetable is a protective factor for hyperuricemia(0. 82(95%CI 0. 65-0. 93)), and intakes of protein(1. 47(95%CI 1. 16-2. 28))and fat(2. 34(95%CI 2. 01-3. 22)) are the risk factors.
Drilling workers in Northwest Sichuan gas field have a high prevalence of hyperuricemia and are related to diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, elevated creatinine and hemoglobin, and too much protein, fat intake and too little vegetable intake.
To understand the prevalence and epidemic characteristics of metabolic syndrome(MS) among adult residents in Nanjing City.
In 2010-2013, a total of 4918 adult residents in Nanjing City were surveyed using a multi-stage stratification and population proportional clustering random sampling method. Questionnaires, physical examinations and laboratory examinations were conducted to collect the basic conditions, health history of the subjects and related indicators including height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, etc. The 2009 International Joint Interim Statement(JIS) was used to filter patients with metabolic syndrome.
Among the 4918 surveyed subjects, 1627 were MS, with a crude prevalence rate of 33. 1% and an age-standardized prevalence rate of 26. 3%, the standardized prevalence rate of MS was 29. 0% in males and 24. 8% in females. Age-standardized prevalence rates between different genders had no significant statistical difference(œá~2=1. 352, P=0. 245). There were significant statistical differences between the crude prevalence rate of MS among subjects of different ages(œá~2=132. 557, P&lt;0. 001), occupations(œá~2=87. 572, P&lt;0. 001)and educational level(œá~2=26. 077, P&lt;0. 001). Patients with a family history of hypertension(œá~2=26. 582, P&lt;0. 001) and a family history of diabetes(œá~2=16. 013, P&lt;0. 001)had a higher prevalence of MS.
The prevalence of metabolic syndrome in adult residents in Nanjing City in 2010-2013 was relatively high.
To understand the dietary cholesterol intake status of elderly residents in 15 provinces(autonomous regions and municipality) of China, and to analyze the relationship between dietary cholesterol intake status and blood cholesterol level.
Using data from "China Nutritional Transition Cohort Survey" in 2015 on the subjects aged 60 and above in 15 provinces(autonomous regions and municipality) in China with complete 24-hour-dietary for 3 days method, the differences in dietary cholesterol intake of different genders, urban and rural areas, age, education, income and body mass index were analyzed by means of variance analysis. Chi-square test was used to analyze the distribution of different dietary cholesterol levels. The relationship between dietary cholesterol intake and blood cholesterol(TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol(LDL-C) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol(HDL-C) was analyzed by multiple linear regression analysis. Multivariate Logistic regression was used to analyze the risk of different dietary cholesterol intake levels with blood cholesterol edge elevation and hypercholesterolemia.
The average dietary cholesterol intake of the 4698 elderly residents over 60 years old in 15 provinces(autonomous regions and municipality) of China in 2015 was 223. 1 mg/d, which was higher for men than for women, higher for cities than for rural areas, and higher with the increase of education and income level. The proportion of the elderly residents who consumed more than 300 mg/d daily dietary cholesterol was 28. 0%. Eggs and red meat were the main food sources of dietary cholesterol for elderly residents, accounting for 53. 8% and 26. 0% of the total intake respectively. For every 100 mg increase in cholesterol intake in elderly residents, there were 0. 0409 mmol/L of TC and 0. 0280 mmol/L of LDL-C increase. Elderly residents whose dietary cholesterol intake was higher than 300 mg/d had 1. 320 times higher risk of elevated blood cholesterol margins and 1. 332 times higher risk of hypercholesterolemia than elderly residents whose dietary cholesterol intake was lower than 300 mg/d.
The dietary cholesterol intake of elderly residents in 15 provinces(autonomous regions and municipality) of China is higher for men than that for women, and is positively correlated with the economic and cultural levels. Eggs and red meat are the main food sources of dietary cholesterol for elderly residents. The dietary cholesterol intake of elderly residents is positively correlated with TC and LDL-C. High dietary cholesterol in older residents increases the risk of elevated blood cholesterol margins and hypercholesterolemia.
Diabetic dyslipidemia in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is characterized by elevated levels of triglycerides (TG), decreased levels of high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated levels of low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDLC), and the predominance of small and dense LDL particles (sdLDL). The mechanism underlying diabetic dyslipidemia remains unclear. Insulin resistance is believed to be an important determinant. Mechanisms underlying insulin resistance-induced diabetic dyslipidemia seem to be related to apolipoprotein CIII (ApoCIII), a known inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase. The concentration of very low density lipoprotein1 (VLDL1) with a higher TG content and abundant ApoCIII was found to be significantly elevated in patients with T2DM. Recently, volanesorsen as a promising ApoIII inhibitor was shown to improve the lipid profile in patients with diabetic dyslipidemia. Herein, this paper will review recent advance in pathophysiology of diabetic dyslipidemia and the role of ApoCIII in this condition, with focus on describing a novel drug volanesorsen as potential treatment strategy.
To observe the changes of apolipoprotein E (apoE) protein expression of pulmonary tissue in mice with pulmonary hypertension induced by hypoxia.
The animal model of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension was established by exposing the mice to isobaric hypoxic chamber for 3 weeks (23 h/d, regular chow feed).Twenty male wild type (WT) C57BL/6 mice and twenty apoE gene knockout (apoE-KO) mice were randomly divided into normoxia group and hypoxia group. The plasma concentrations of low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL) and total cholesterol were detected by ELISA method. The protein expression of apoE in lung and liver, and peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor gamma (PPARŒ≥) in lung were measured by Western blot.
‚ë†In WT mice, the right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and the weight ratio of right ventricle (RV) to left ventricle plus septum (LV+S) of hypoxia group were significantly higher than those of normoxia group by 68% and 59% (P&lt;0.05), respectively. The plasma concentration of HDL and HDL/LDL of hypoxia group were significantly lower than those of normoxia group by 17% and 40% (P&lt;0.05), respectively.The protein expression of apoE in lung and in liver of hypoxia group were significantly down-regulated than those of normoxia group by 48% and 52% (P&lt;0.05), respectively.The protein expression of PPARŒ≥ in lung was significantly down-regulated than that of normoxia group by 37%(P&lt;0.05).RVSP were significantly negative correlated with the protein levels of apoE and PPARŒ≥ in lung (P&lt;0.01).‚ë° In apoE-KO mice, RVSP and the weight ratio of RV to LV+S of hypoxia group were significantly higher than those of normoxia group by 96% and 86% (P&lt;0.05), respectively.RVSP and RV to (LV+S) of hypoxia group in apoE-KO mice were significantly higher than those of hypoxia group in WT mice by 29% and 24% (P&lt;0.05), respectively.
Down-regulated expression of apoE in lung tissue participates in the pathological proceeding of pulmonary hypertension induced by hypoxia.
Maternal inflammation induces intrauterine growth restriction (MI-IUGR) of the fetus, which compromises metabolic health in human offspring and reduces value in livestock. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of maternal inflammation at midgestation on fetal skeletal muscle growth and myoblast profiles at term. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were injected daily with bacterial endotoxin (MI-IUGR) or saline (controls) from the 9th to the 11th day of gestational age (dGA; term = 21 dGA). At necropsy on dGA 20, average fetal mass and upper hindlimb cross-sectional areas were reduced (P &lt; 0.05) in MI-IUGR fetuses compared with controls. MyoD+ and myf5+ myoblasts were less abundant (P &lt; 0.05), and myogenin+ myoblasts were more abundant (P &lt; 0.05) in MI-IUGR hindlimb skeletal muscle compared with controls, indicating precocious myoblast differentiation. Type I and Type II hindlimb muscle fibers were smaller (P &lt; 0.05) in MI-IUGR fetuses than in controls, but fiber type proportions did not differ between experimental groups. Fetal blood plasma TNFŒ± concentrations were below detectable amounts in both experimental groups, but skeletal muscle gene expression for the cytokine receptors TNFR1, IL6R, and FN14 was greater (P &lt; 0.05) in MI-IUGR fetuses than controls, perhaps indicating enhanced sensitivity to these cytokines. Maternal blood glucose concentrations at term did not differ between experimental groups, but MI-IUGR fetal blood contained less (P &lt; 0.05) glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Fetal-to-maternal blood glucose ratios were also reduced (P &lt; 0.05), which is indicative of placental insufficiency. Indicators of protein catabolism, including blood plasma urea nitrogen and creatine kinase, were greater (P &lt; 0.05) in MI-IUGR fetuses than in controls. From these findings, we conclude that maternal inflammation at midgestation causes muscle-centric fetal programming that impairs myoblast function, increases protein catabolism, and reduces skeletal muscle growth near term. Fetal muscle sensitivity to inflammatory cytokines appeared to be enhanced after maternal inflammation, which may represent a mechanistic target for improving these outcomes in MI-IUGR fetuses.
Sickle cell disease (SCD)-induced urinary concentration defect has been proposed as caused by impaired ability of the occluded vasa recta due to red blood cell sickling to serve as countercurrent exchangers and renal tubules to absorb water and solutes. However, the exact molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. The present studies were undertaken to determine the effects of SCD on vasopressin, aquaporin2 (AQP2), urea transporter A1 (UTA1), Na-K-Cl co-transporter 2 (NKCC2), epithelial Na channels (ENaC), aquaporin1 (AQP1), nuclear factor of activated T cells 5 (NFAT5) and Src homology region-2 domain-containing¬†phosphatase-1 (SHP-1), an important regulator of NFAT5, in the Berkeley SCD mouse kidney medulla. Under water repletion, SCD only induced a minor urinary concentration defect associated with increased urinary vasopressin level alone with the well-known effects of vasopressin: protein abundance of AQP2, UTA1 and ENaC-Œ≤ and apical targeting of AQP2 as compared with non-SCD. SCD did not significantly affect AQP1 protein level. Water restriction had no further significant effect on SCD urinary vasopressin. NFAT5 is also critical to urinary concentration. Instead, water restriction-activated NFAT5 associated with inhibition of SHP-1 in the SCD mice. Yet, water restriction only elevated urinary osmolality by 28% in these mice as opposed to 104% in non-SCD mice despite similar degree increases of protein abundance of AQP2, NKCC2 and AQP2-S256-P. Water-restriction had no significant effect on protein abundance of ENaC or AQP1 in either strain. In conclusion, under water repletion SCD, only induces a minor defect in urinary concentration because of compensation from the up-regulated vasopressin system. However, under water restriction, SCD mice struggle to concentrate urine despite activating NFAT5. SCD-induced urinary concentration defect appears to be resulted from the poor blood flow in vasa recta rather than the renal tubules' ability to absorb water and solutes.
In this study, we investigated the role of phenytoin (PHT) in death receptor-induced apoptosis of gingival fibroblasts to clarify the mechanism of PHT-induced gingival overgrowth.
Human gingival fibroblasts were cultured to semiconfluence and treated with PHT (0.025, 0.1, 0.25, and 1.0¬†ŒºM) for 48¬†h, and then, the apoptotic cell numbers were relatively determined by absorptiometry. After 24¬†h of 0.25¬†ŒºM PHT treatment, caspase activity was measured by absorptiometry, apoptotic and cell cycle phase distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry, expression levels of apoptotic genes were quantified by real-time qPCR, and expression of apoptotic proteins was detected by Western blot analysis. After 48¬†h of 0.25¬†ŒºM PHT treatment, appearance of apoptotic cells was detected by TUNEL assay.
PHT treatment decreased the proportion of apoptotic cells in gingival fibroblasts compared to a serum-free control culture in response to the protein changes as follows: PHT upregulated c-FLIP and, in turn, downregulated FADD, caspase-8, and caspase-3; PHT upregulated c-IAP2 and downregulated TRAF2; PHT downregulated caspase-9 and caspase-3 via decreased RIPK1 activity and increased Bcl-2 activity.
PHT-induced gingival overgrowth may result from the above-mentioned mechanisms involving apoptosis inhibition in gingival fibroblasts.
To investigate the protective effect of hypothermia (HT) on brain injury in moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI) rat models and the potential mechanisms, especially the involvement of RIPK1 in apoptosis and necroptosis.
Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to four groups: sham+normothermia (sham+NT), sham+hypothermia (sham+HT), moderate TBI+normothermia (TBI+NT) and moderate TBI+hypothermia (TBI+HT). The sham+HT and TBI+HT groups were submitted to 32¬∞C for 6 hours. The regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was assessed 24 hours after TBI; 24 and 48 hours after TBI, the modified neurological severity score (mNSS) was assessed. Immediately after behavioural tests, rats were sacrificed to harvest the brain tissues.
mNSS scores were lower in the TBI+HT group compared with the TBI+NT group (p &lt; 0.01) and cerebral blood flow was better (p &lt; 0.01). H&amp;E staining of the cortex and ipsilateral hippocampus showed pyknotic and irregularly shaped neurons in TBI+NT rats, which were less frequent in TBI+HT rats. The TBI+NT and TBI+HT groups showed higher TNF-Œ±, TRAIL, FasL, FADD, caspase-3, caspase-8, PARP-1, RIPK-1 and RIPK-3 levels than the sham+NT group (all p &lt; 0.05), but the levels of these proteins were all lower in the TBI+HT group compared with the TBI+NT group (all p &lt; 0.01).
HT treatment significantly reduced RIPK-1 upregulation, which may inhibit necroptosis and apoptosis pathways after moderate TBI.
The role of endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) in cholestatic liver disease and fibrosis is not fully unraveled. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a hydrophilic bile acid, has been shown to reduce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and counteract apoptosis in different pathologies. We aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of TUDCA in experimental secondary biliary liver fibrosis in mice, induced by common bile duct ligation. The kinetics of the hepatic UPR and apoptosis during the development of biliary fibrosis was studied by measuring markers at six different timepoints post-surgery by qPCR and Western blot. Next, we investigated the therapeutic potential of TUDCA, 10 mg/kg/day in drinking water, on liver damage (AST/ALT levels) and fibrosis (Sirius red-staining), in both a preventive and therapeutic setting. Common bile duct ligation resulted in the increased protein expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) at all timepoints, along with upregulation of pro-apoptotic caspase 3 and 12, tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 1A (TNFRsf1a) and Fas-Associated protein with Death Domain (FADD) expression. Treatment with TUDCA led to a significant reduction of liver fibrosis, accompanied by a slight reduction of liver damage, decreased hepatic protein expression of CHOP and reduced gene and protein expression of pro-apoptotic markers. These data indicate that TUDCA exerts a beneficial effect on liver fibrosis in a model of cholestatic liver disease, and suggest that this effect might, at least in part, be attributed to decreased hepatic UPR signaling and apoptotic cell death.
Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a malignancy with no effective therapy and poor prognosis. Forbesione, a caged xanthone isolated from Garcinia hanburyi, has been reported to inhibit proliferation and to induce apoptosis in human CCA cell lines. The present study aimed to further explore the potential anticancer properties of forbesione by testing its effects against the hamster CCA cell line Ham-1 in vitro and in vivo. It was observed that forbesione inhibited the growth of Ham-1 cells in vitro and suppressed Ham-1 growth as allograft in hamsters by inducing cell cycle arrest at the S phase. This was mediated by decreasing the protein expression of cyclin E, cyclin A and cyclin-dependent kinase 2. In addition, increased expression of p21 and p27 was detected, which could possibly explain the reduced expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and of the bile duct cell marker cytokeratin 19 observed in forbesione-treated Ham-1 cells in vitro and in tumor tissues of forbesione-treated hamsters. Furthermore, forbesione induced apoptosis through multiple pathways. The death receptor pathway was activated by increased expression of Fas, Fas-associated death domain and activated caspase-3, along with decreased expression of procaspase-8 and procaspase-3. The mitochondrial pathway was driven by increased expression of B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2-like protein 4, activated caspase-9 and inhibitor of Œ∫B-Œ±, along with decreased expression of Bcl-2, survivin, procaspase-9 and nuclear factor-Œ∫B/p65. The endoplasmic reticulum pathway was stimulated by increased expression of activated caspase-12 and decreased expression of procaspase-12. No side effects or toxicity were observed in forbesione-treated hamsters. Thus, forbesione is a potential drug candidate for cancer therapy that deserves further investigation.
Loss of Fas-associated factor 1 (FAF1) may act as a pro-survival signal in diseased cells, but whether this is true in gastric carcinoma remains unclear. Here we report that FAF1 was expressed at low levels in gastric carcinoma tissues and cell lines, and its expression correlated with larger tumors, higher histology grade, higher TNM stage, tumor infiltration, and lymph node metastasis. Univariate analysis and survival curve analysis identified low FAF1 expression as a predictor of poor prognosis. FAF1 overexpression in HGC-27 gastric cancer cells induced cell apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation and growth. It also reduced colony formation in vitro and tumor growth in mice. We found that Helicobacter pylori, a risk factor for gastric cancer, down-regulated FAF1 expression via NF-Œ∫B signaling. Knock-down of IKKŒ≤ or p65 expression in gastric cancer cells reversed H. pylori-induced down-regulation of FAF1 expression and partially blocked H. pylori-induced secretion of inflammatory cytokines TNF-Œ± and IL-8. Our results suggest that loss of FAF1 contributes to human gastric carcinogenesis by allowing H. pylori to activate NF-Œ∫B signaling.
The goal of this study was to elucidate the role of Fas, TNF-R1, FADD and cytochrome c in UVB-induced K+ channel activation, an early step in UVB-induced apoptosis, in human corneal limbal epithelial (HCLE) cells. HCLE cells were treated with Fas, TNF-R1 or FADD siRNA and exposed to 80 or 150¬†mJ/cm2 UVB. K+ channel activation and loss of intracellular K+ were measured using whole-cell patch-clamp recording and ion chromatography, respectively. Cytochrome c was measured with an ELISA kit. Cells in which Fas was knocked down exhibited identical UVB-induced K+ channel activation and loss of intracellular K+ to control cells. Cells in which TNF-R1 or FADD were knocked down demonstrated reduced K+ channel activation and decreased loss of intracellular K+ following UVB, relative to control cells. Application of TNF-Œ±, the natural ligand of TNF-R1, to HCLE cells induced K+ channel activation and loss of intracellular K+. Cytochrome c was translocated to the cytosol by 2¬†h after exposure to 150¬†mJ/cm2 UVB. However, there was no release by 10¬†min post-UVB. The data suggest that UVB activates TNF-R1, which in turn may activate K+ channels via FADD. This conclusion is supported by the observation that TNF-Œ± also causes loss of intracellular K+. This signaling pathway appears to be integral to UVB-induced K+ efflux, since knockdown of TNF-R1 or FADD inhibits the UVB-induced K+ efflux. The lack of rapid cytochrome c translocation indicates cytochrome c does not play a role in UVB-induced K+ channel activation.
The species-specific, as well as organ-specific expression of regulated necrosis (RN)-related molecules, is not known. We determined the expression levels of tumour necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR1), receptor activated protein kinase (RIPK)1, RIPK3, mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL), CASP8, Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD), cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein (CIAP)1, CIAP2, glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPX4), cyclophilin D (CYPD), CASP1, NLRP3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) in human and mouse solid organs. We observed significant differences in expression of these molecules between human and mice. In addition, we characterized their expression profiles in acute as well as persistent tissue injury and chronic tissue remodelling using acute and chronic kidney injury models. We observed that the degree and pattern of induction of RN-related molecules were highly dependent on the trigger and disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, we studied their expression patterns in mice with lupus-like systemic autoimmunity, which revealed that the expression of MLKL, GPX4 and PARP1 significantly increased in the spleen along disease progression and CASP1, RIPK1, RIPK3 and CYPD were higher at the earlier stages but were significantly decreased in the later stages. In contrast, in the kidney, the expression of genes involved in pyroptosis, e.g. NLRP3 and CASP1 were significantly increased and TNFR1, RIPK1, RIPK3, CIAP1/2 and GPX4 were significantly decreased along the progression of lupus nephritis (LN). Thus, the organ- and species-specific expression of RN-related molecules should be considered during designing experiments, interpreting the results as well as extrapolating the conclusions from one species or organ to another species or organ respectively.
Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) plays a key role in extrinsic apoptosis. Here, we show that FADD is SUMOylated as an essential step during intrinsic necrosis. FADD was modified at multiple lysine residues (K120/125/149) by small ubiquitin-related modifier 2 (SUMO2) during necrosis caused by calcium ionophore A23187 and by ischemic damage. SUMOylated FADD bound to dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) in cells both in vitro and in ischemic tissue damage cores, thus promoting Drp1 recruitment by mitochondrial fission factor (Mff) to accomplish mitochondrial fragmentation. Mitochondrial-fragmentation-associated necrosis was blocked by FADD or Drp1 deficiency and SUMO-defective FADD expression. Interestingly, caspase-10, but not caspase-8, formed a ternary protein complex with SUMO-FADD/Drp1 on the mitochondria upon exposure to A23187 and potentiated Drp1 oligomerization for necrosis. Moreover, the caspase-10 L285F and A414V mutants, found in autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, respectively, regulated this necrosis. Our study reveals an essential role of SUMOylated FADD in Drp1- and caspase-10-dependent necrosis, providing insights into the mechanism of regulated necrosis by calcium overload and ischemic injury.
KR33493, a newly developed FAS-associated factor 1 (FAF1) inhibitor for Parkinson's disease, is being evaluated in a Phase I clinical trial. In the present study, the subchronic toxicity of KR33493 in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and beagle dogs was investigated at various oral doses for 28 and 14 days, respectively. During the study, food consumption, body weights, organ weights, gross findings, and mortality were examined; and ophthalmoscopy, electrocardiography, hematology, serum biochemistry, urinalysis, histopathology, and toxicokinetics were performed. In rats, weight gain decreased in both sexes at 500¬†mg/kg/day, with no significant differences. In dogs, some significant differences compared with the control were found during the trial; however, at the end of recovery periods, these were no longer observed and there was no dose correlation. Some histopathological findings were observed, but these were considered as incidental changes. Since no other significant changes were observed, doses above 500 and 1000¬†mg/kg KR33493 in rat and dogs, respectively, caused no observed adverse effects. Therefore, based on these results, the Phase 1 clinical trial for KR33493 was approved by the Korean Food &amp; Drug Administration.
Cumulative damage caused by oxidative stress results in diverse pathological conditions. Therefore, elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying cell death following oxidative stress is important. Here, we describe a novel role for Fas-associated factor 1 (FAF1) as a crucial regulator of necrotic cell death elicited by hydrogen peroxide. Upon oxidative insult, FAF1 translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and promoted the catalytic activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) through physical interaction. Moreover, FAF1 depletion prevented PARP1-linked downstream events involved in the triggering of cell death, including energetic collapse, mitochondrial depolarization and nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), implying that FAF1 has a key role in PARP1-dependent necrosis in response to oxidative stress. We further investigated whether FAF1 might contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease through excessive PARP1 activation. Indeed, the overexpression of FAF1 using a recombinant adeno-associated virus system in the mouse ventral midbrain promoted PARP1 activation and dopaminergic neurodegeneration in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of Parkinson's disease. Collectively, our data demonstrate the presence of an FAF1-PARP1 axis that is involved in oxidative stress-induced necrosis and in the pathology of Parkinson's disease.
UVR-induced apoptosis in cutaneous antigen presenting cells (APC) causes systemic immune suppression and is dependent on TLR4/MyD88 signalling, but the apoptotic signalling pathways have not been defined. Macrophages pretreated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were unresponsive to subsequent LPS treatment, however, but were susceptible to UVR-induced apoptosis. Macrophage survival and apoptotic events after UVR were also unaffected by treatment with TLR4 antagonists, a blocking IgG or a TLR4 analog antagonist, suggesting that UVR cell death is independent of a soluble ligand. After UVR, IRAK4KDKI (catalytically inactive IRAK4) and wild-type (WT) macrophages show equivalent levels of survival, as measured by MTT assay, and apoptosis, as measured by cleaved caspase-3. Furthermore, in macrophages from both mice, UVR activated caspase-8 and PARP, while inactivating Rip3. This finding is supported by a lack of IRAK1 degradation after UVR, compared to treatment with TLR2 or TLR4 agonists. UVR induced association of MyD88 with FADD, an extrinsic apoptotic pathway protein, but not IRAK4. UVR-induced migration of FADD to the cell membrane of WT macrophages, but not MyD88-/- macrophages, was observed (confocal microscopy). Co-immunoprecipitation using an epitope-tagged MyD88 revealed that FADD, but not TRADD, was recruited to MyD88 within 30¬†minutes of UVR exposure. UVR engages TLR4/MyD88 as a death signalling complex, rather than the classical inflammatory signalling pathway triggered by PAMP recognition of TLR4. These studies provide the rationale for the future development of topical TLR4 modulating therapies to interfere with this UVB-mediated apoptosis and the associated negative consequences of immune suppression.
More than 60 genetic susceptibility loci associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have been established in populations of Asian and European ancestry. Given ethnic differences and environmental factors, validation of the effects of genetic risk variants with reported associations identified by Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWASs) is essential. The study aims at evaluating the associations of T2DM with 29 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 19 candidate genes derived from GWASs in a northern Han Chinese population.
In this case-control study, 461 T2DM-diagnosed patients and 434 controls were recruited at the Jidong oil field hospital (Hebei, China) from January 2009 to October 2013. A cumulative genetic risk score (cGRS) was calculated by summation of the number of risk alleles, and a weight GRS (wGRS) was calculated as the sum of risk alleles at each locus multiplied by their effect sizes for T2DM, using the independent variants selected.
The allelic frequency of the "A" allele at rs17106184 (Fas-associated factor 1, FAF1) was significantly higher in the T2DM patients than that of the healthy controls (11.7% vs. 6.4%, p &lt; 0.001). Individuals in the highestquartile of wGRS had an over three-fold increased risk for developing T2DM compared with those in the lowest quartile (odds ratio = 3.06, 95% CI = 1.92-4.88, p &lt; 0.001) adjusted for age, sex, BMI, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). The results were similar when analyzed with the cGRS.
We confirmed the association between rs17106184 (FAF1) and T2DM in a northern Han Chinese population. The GRS calculated based on T2DM susceptibility variants may be a useful tool for predicting the T2DM susceptibility.
Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP) is a rare X-linked disease characterized by early male lethality and multiple abnormalities in heterozygous females. IP is caused by NF-Œ∫B essential modulator (NEMO) mutations. The current mechanistic model suggests that NEMO functions as a crucial component mediating the recruitment of the IŒ∫B-kinase (IKK) complex to tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNF-R1), thus allowing activation of the pro-survival NF-Œ∫B response. However, recent studies have suggested that gene activation and cell death inhibition are two independent activities of NEMO. Here we describe that cells expressing the IP-associated NEMO-A323P mutant had completely abrogated TNF-induced NF-Œ∫B activation, but retained partial antiapoptotic activity and exhibited high sensitivity to death by necroptosis. We found that robust caspase activation in NEMO-deficient cells is concomitant with RIPK3 recruitment to the apoptosis-mediating complex. In contrast, cells expressing the ubiquitin-binding mutant NEMO-A323P did not recruit RIPK3 to complex II, an event that prevented caspase activation. Hence NEMO, independently from NF-Œ∫B activation, represents per se a key component in the structural and functional dynamics of the different TNF-R1-induced complexes. Alteration of this process may result in differing cellular outcomes and, consequently, also pathological effects in IP patients with different NEMO mutations.
Death Receptor 5 (DR5) is known to be an important anti-cancer drug target. TRAIL is a natural ligand of DR5, but its drug action is limited because of several factors. A few agonistic ligands were identified as TRAIL-DR5 axis modulators, which enhance the cellular apoptosis. Literature suggest that quinacrine (QC) acts as a DR5 agonistic ligand. However, the detailed mechanism explaining how QC interacts with TRAIL-DR5 axis has not been established. Also focused in vitro and in vivo experimental analysis to validate the hypothesis is not yet performed. In this work, extensive studies have been carried out using in silico analysis (molecular dynamics), in vitro analysis (cell based assays) and in vivo analysis (based on mice xenograft model), to delineate the mechanism of QC action in modulating the TRAIL-DR5 signaling. The MD simulations helped in identifying the important residues contributing to the formation of a QC-TRAIL-DR5 complex, which provide extra stability to it, consequently leading to the enhanced cellular apoptosis. QC caused a dose dependent increase of DR5 expression in cancer cells but not in normal breast epithelial cells, MCF-10A. QC showed a synergistic effect with TRAIL in causing cancer cell apoptosis. In DR5-KD MCF-10A-Tr (DR5 knocked down) cells, TRAIL+ QC failed to significantly increase the apoptosis but over expression of full length DR5 in DR5-silence cells induced apoptosis, further supporting DR5 as a drug target for QC. An increase in the release of reactive species (ROS and RNS) and activation of enzymes (FADD, CASPASES 3, 8, 9 and cytochrome-C) indicated the involvement of mitochondrial intrinsic pathway in TRAIL+QC mediated apoptosis. In vivo study pointed out that TRAIL+QC co-administration increases the expression of DR5 and reduce the tumor size in xenograft mice. This combined in silico, in vitro and in vivo analysis revealed that QC enhances the cellular apoptosis via the modulation of TRAIL-DR5 complexation and the mitochondrial intrinsic pathway.
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a potent cancer cell-specific apoptosis-inducing cytokine with little toxicity to most normal cells. However, acquired resistance of cancer cells to TRAIL is a roadblock. Agents that can either potentiate the effect of TRAIL or overcome resistance to TRAIL are urgently needed. This article reports that ginsenoside compound K (CK) potentiates TRAIL-induced apoptosis in HCT116 colon cancer cells and sensitizes TRAIL-resistant colon cancer HT-29 cells to TRAIL. On a cellular mechanistic level, CK downregulated cell survival proteins including Mcl-1, Bcl-2, surviving, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein and Fas-associated death domain-like IL-1-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein, upregulated cell pro-apoptotic proteins including Bax, tBid and cytochrome c, and induced the cell surface expression of TRAIL death receptor DR5. Reduction of DR5 levels by siRNAs significantly decreases CK- and TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Importantly, our results indicate, for the first time, that DR5 upregulation is mediated by autophagy, as blockade of CK-induced autophagy by 3-MA, LY294002 or Atg7 siRNAs substantially decreases DR5 upregulation and reduces the synergistic effect. Furthermore, CK-stimulated autophagy is mediated by the reactive oxygen species-c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase pathway. Moreover, we found that p53 and the C/EBP homologous (CHOP) protein is also required for DR5 upregulation but not related with autophagy. Our findings contribute significantly to the understanding of the mechanism accounted for the synergistic anticancer activity of CK and TRAIL, and showed a novel mechanism related with DR5 upregulation.
Several studies have addressed the possible role of hepatitis C virus genotype4 (HCV GT4) in apoptosis. However, this still not fully understood. In the current study a reconstructed clone of E1/E2 polyprotein region of the HCV GT4 was transfected into the Huh7 cell line and a human apoptotic PCR array of 84 genes was used to investigate its possible significance for apoptosis. Out of the 84 genes, only 35 showed significant differential expression, 12 genes being upregulated and 23 downregulated. The highestup regulated genes were APAF1 (apoptotic peptidaseactivating factor 1), BID (BH3 interacting domain death agonist) and BCL 10 (Bcell CLL/ lymphoma protein 10) with fold regulation of 33.2, 30.1 and 18.9, respectively. The most downregulated were FAS (TNF receptor super family), TNFRSF10B (tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 10b) and FADD (FASassociated death domain) with fold regulation of 30.2, 27.7 and 14.9, respectively. These results suggest that the E1/E2 proteins may be involved in HCVinduced pathogenesis by modulating apoptosis through the induction of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway and disruption of the BCL2 gene family. 
Alveolar epithelial injury and increased alveolar permeability are hallmarks of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Apoptosis of lung epithelial cells via the Fas/Fas ligand (FasL) pathway plays a critical role in alveolar epithelial injury. Activation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 by inhibition of prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins (PHDs) is a possible therapeutic approach to attenuate apoptosis and organ injury. Here, we investigated whether treatment with dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG), an inhibitor of PHDs, could attenuate Fas/FasL-dependent apoptosis in lung epithelial cells and lung injury. DMOG increased HIF-1Œ± protein expression in vitro in MLE-12 cells, a murine alveolar epithelial cell line. Treatment of MLE-12 cells with DMOG significantly suppressed cell surface expression of Fas and attenuated FasL-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptotic cell death. Inhibition of the HIF-1 pathway by echinomycin or small interfering RNA transfection abolished these antiapoptotic effects of DMOG. Moreover, intraperitoneal injection of DMOG in mice increased HIF-1Œ± expression and decreased Fas expression in lung tissues. DMOG treatment significantly attenuated caspase-3 activation, apoptotic cell death in lung tissue, and the increase in alveolar permeability in mice instilled intratracheally with FasL. In addition, inflammatory responses and histopathological changes were also significantly attenuated by DMOG treatment. In conclusion, inhibition of PHDs protects lung epithelial cells from Fas/FasL-dependent apoptosis through HIF-1 activation and attenuates lung injury in mice.
The importance of death receptor (DR) signaling in embryonic development and physiological homeostasis is well established, as is the existence of several molecules that modulate DRs function, among them Fas Apoptotis Inhibitory Molecules. Although FAIM1, FAIM2, and FAIM3 inhibit Fas-induced cell death, they are not structurally related, nor do they share expression patterns. Moreover, they inhibit apoptosis through completely different mechanisms. FAIM1 and FAIM2 protect neurons from DR-induced apoptosis and are involved in neurite outgrowth and neuronal plasticity. FAIM1 inhibits Fas ligand- and tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced apoptosis by direct interaction with Fas receptor and through the stabilization of levels of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, a potent anti-apoptotic protein that inhibits caspases. Low FAIM1 levels are found in Alzheimer's disease, thus sensitizing neurons to tumor necrosis factor alpha and prompting neuronal loss. FAIM2 protects from Fas by direct interaction with Fas receptor, as well as by modulating calcium release at the endoplasmic reticulum through interaction with Bcl-xL. Several studies prove the role of FAIM2 in diseases of the nervous system, such as ischemia, bacterial meningitis, and neuroblastoma. The less characterized member of the FAIM family is FAIM3, which is expressed in tissues of the digestive and urinary tracts, bone marrow and testes, and restricted to the cerebellum in the nervous system. FAIM3 protects against DR-induced apoptosis by inducing the expression of other DR-antagonists such as CFLAR or through the interaction with the DR-adaptor protein Fas-associated via death domain. FAIM3 null mouse models reveal this protein as an important mediator of inflammatory autoimmune responses such as those triggered in autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Given the differences between FAIMs and the variety of processes in which they are involved, here we sought to provide a concise review about these molecules and their roles in the physiology and pathology of the nervous system. Even though they share name and inhibit Fas-induced cell death, Fas apoptotic inhibitory molecules (FAIMs) are not structurally related and inhibit apoptosis through completely different mechanisms. In this review, we describe FAIM1, FAIM2, and FAIM3 functions in the nervous system, and their implication in diverse pathologies such as neurodegenerative disease, cancer, or autoimmune diseases.
The Sendai virus strain Tianjin is a novel genotype of the Sendai virus. In previous studies, ultraviolet-inactivated Sendai virus strain Tianjin (UV-Tianjin) demonstrated antitumor effects on human breast cancer cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate the in vitro antitumor effects of UV-Tianjin on the human cervical carcinoma HeLa, human small cell lung cancer NCI-H446 and human hepatocellular carcinoma Hep 3B cell lines, and the possible underlying mechanisms of these antitumor effects. A 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay revealed that UV-Tianjin treatment inhibited the proliferation of HeLa, NCI-H446 and Hep 3B cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Hoechst and Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide double staining indicated that UV-Tianjin induced dose-dependent apoptosis in all three cell lines with the most significant effect observed in the HeLa cell line. In the HeLa cell line, UV-Tianjin-induced apoptosis was further confirmed by the disruption of the mitochondria membrane potential and the activation of caspases, as demonstrated by fluorescent cationic dye and colorimetric assays, respectively. In addition, western blot analysis revealed that UV-Tianjin treatment resulted in significant upregulation of cytochrome c, apoptosis protease activating factor-1, Fas, Fas ligand and Fas-associated protein with death domain, and activated caspase-9, -8 and -3 in HeLa cells. Based on these results, it is hypothesized that UV-Tianjin exhibits anticancer activity in HeLa, NCI-H446 and Hep 3B cell lines via the induction of apoptosis. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that in the HeLa cell line, intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways may be involved in UV-Tianjin-induced apoptosis.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of exercise training on cardiac Fas receptor-dependent and mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathways in ovariectomized rats. Histopathological analysis, TUNEL assay, and Western blotting were performed on the excised hearts from three groups of Sprague-Dawley rats, which were divided into a sham-operated group, a bilaterally ovariectomized group (OVX), and a bilaterally ovariectomized group that underwent treadmill running exercise for 60 min/day, 5 sessions/wk, for 10 wk (OVX-EX). The abnormal myocardial architecture, cardiac trichome-stained fibrosis and cardiac TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells in ovariectomized rats improved after exercise training. The protein levels of tumor necrosis factor-Œ±, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1, Fas ligand, Fas receptors, Fas-associated death domain, activated caspase-8 and activated caspase-3 (Fas receptor-dependent apoptotic pathways), as well as t-Bid, Bad, Bak, Bax, cytosolic cytochrome c, activated caspase-9, and activated caspase-3 (mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathways) were decreased in the OVX-EX group compared with the OVX group. Exercise training suppressed ovariectomy-induced cardiac Fas receptor-dependent and mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathways in ovariectomized rat models. These findings might indicate a new therapeutic effect for exercise training to prevent cardiac apoptosis in menopausal or bilaterally oophorectomized women.
Pekinenin C is a casbane diterpenoid separated from the root of the traditional Chinese medicine, Euphorbia pekinensis Rupr., which is used as drug for the treatment of edema, ascites, and hydrothorax. Whereas pekinenin C exhibits severe cytotoxicity, the exact toxicity mechanism is unclear. In this study, the effects of pekinenin C on cell inhibition, cell cycle, and cell apoptosis were examined to explain its toxic mechanism. The proliferation of IEC-6 cells was accessed via MTT colorimetric assay after incubated with different concentrations of pekinenin C. Pekinenin C-treated IEC-6 cells labeled with RNase/PI and Annexin V/PI were analyzed by flow cytometric analyses for evaluation of cell cycle distribution and cell apoptosis, respectively. The apoptosis mechanism of pekinenin C on IEC-6 was investigated through assaying the activities of caspase-3, 8, 9 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), protein expression of Bax, Bcl-2, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), Apaf-1, Fas-associated death domain (FADD) and type 1-associated death domain (TRADD) by Western-blot, mRNA expression of Fas receptor (FasR), Fas ligand (FasL), tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR1) and NF-Œ∫B by RT-PCR. The results showed that pekinenin C has exhibited obvious IEC-6 cells toxicity and the IC50 value was 2.1 Œºg¬∑mL(-1). Typical apoptosis characteristics were observed under a transmission electron microscopy, and it was found that pekinenin C could cause G0/G1 phase arrest in IEC-6 cells in a dose-dependent manner and induce apoptosis of IEC-6 cells. Additionally, pekinenin C could increase the expressions of Bax, AIF, Apaf-1, FasR, FasL, TNFR1 and NF-Œ∫B, suppress the expression of Bcl-2, FADD and TRADD, then activate caspase-3, 8, 9 cascades, and at last result in apoptosis. These results demonstrated that pekinenin C effectively promoted cell apoptosis, and induced IEC-6 cells apoptosis through both the mitochondrial and death receptor pathways. 
Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction complicates central nervous system lupus, an important aspect of systemic lupus erythematosus. To gain insight into the underlying mechanism, vascular corrosion casts of brain were generated from the lupus mouse model, MRL/lpr mice and the MRL/MpJ congenic controls. Scanning electron microscopy of the casts showed loss of vascular endothelial cells in lupus mice compared with controls. Immunostaining revealed a significant increase in caspase 3 expression in the brain vascular endothelial cells, which suggests that apoptosis could be an important mechanism causing cell loss, and thereby loss of BBB integrity. Complement activation occurs in lupus resulting in increased generation of circulating C5a, which caused the endothelial layer to become 'leaky'. In this study, we show that C5a and lupus serum induced apoptosis in cultured human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMVECs), whereas selective C5a receptor 1 (C5aR1) antagonist reduced apoptosis in these cells, demonstrating C5a/C5aR1-dependence. Gene expression of initiator caspases, caspase 1 and caspase 8, and pro-apoptotic proteins death-associated protein kinase 1, Fas-associated protein (FADD), cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor 45 000 MW subunit A-like effector B (CIDEB) and BCL2-associated X protein were increased in HBMVECs treated with lupus serum or C5a, indicating that both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways could be critical mediators of brain endothelial cell apoptosis in this setting. Overall, our findings suggest that C5a/C5aR1 signalling induces apoptosis through activation of FADD, caspase 8/3 and CIDEB in brain endothelial cells in lupus. Further elucidation of the underlying apoptotic mechanisms mediating the reduced endothelial cell number is important in establishing the potential therapeutic effectiveness of C5aR1 inhibition that could prevent and/or reduce BBB alterations and preserve the physiological function of BBB in central nervous system lupus.
Endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFC) constitute an endothelial progenitor fraction with a promising interest for the treatment of ischaemic cardiovascular diseases. As soluble CD146 (sCD146) is a new factor promoting angiogenesis, we examined whether sCD146 priming could improve the therapeutic potential of ECFC and defined the involved mechanism.
We investigated the effects of sCD146 priming on regenerative properties of ECFC in vivo. In a mouse model of hindlimb ischaemia, the homing of radiolabelled cells to ischaemic tissue was assessed by SPECT-CT imaging. Soluble CD146 priming did not modify the number of engrafted ECFC but improved their survival capacity, leading to an enhanced revascularization. The mechanism of action of sCD146 on ECFC was studied in vitro. We showed that sCD146 acts in ECFC through a signalosome, located in lipid rafts, containing angiomotin, the short isoform of CD146 (shCD146), VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and presenilin-1. Soluble CD146 induced a sequential proteolytic cleavage of shCD146, with an extracellular shedding followed by an intramembrane cleavage mediated by matrix metalloprotease (MMP)/ADAM and presenilin-1, respectively. The generated intracellular part of shCD146 was directed towards the nucleus where it associated with the transcription factor CSL and modulated the transcription of genes involved in cell survival (FADD, Bcl-xl) and angiogenesis (eNOS). This effect was dependent on both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, which were rapidly phosphorylated by sCD146.
These findings establish that activation of the proteolytic processing of shCD146, in particular by sCD146, constitutes a promising pathway to improve endothelial progenitors' regenerative properties for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor, with poor prognosis and a lack of effective therapeutic options. The aberrant expression of transcription factor REST (repressor element 1-silencing transcription factor) had been reported in different kinds of tumors. However, the function of REST and its mechanisms in GBM remain elusive. Here, REST expression was inhibited by siRNA silencing in U-87 and U-251 GBM cells. Then CCK-8 assay showed significantly decreased cell proliferation, and the inhibition of migration was verified by scratch wound healing assay and transwell assay. Using cell cycle analysis and Annexin V/PI straining assay, G1 phase cell cycle arrest was found to be a reason for the suppression of cell proliferation and migration upon REST silencing, while apoptosis was not affected by REST silencing. Further, the detection of REST-downstream genes involved in cytostasis and migration inhibition demonstrated that CCND1 and CCNE1 were reduced; CDK5R1, BBC3, EGR1, SLC25A4, PDCD7, MAPK11, MAPK12, FADD and DAXX were enhanced, among which BBC3 and DAXX were direct targets of REST, as verified by ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) and Western blotting. These data suggested that REST is a master regulator that maintains GBM cells proliferation and migration, partly through regulating cell cycle by repressing downstream genes, which might represent a potential target for GBM therapy. 
Food restriction and weight loss are known to prevent obesity-related heart diseases. This study investigates whether food restriction elicits anti-apoptotic and pro-survival effects on high-fat diet-induced obese hearts. Histopathological analysis, TUNEL assay, and Western blotting were performed on the excised hearts from three groups of Sprague-Dawley rats which were fed with regular chow diet (CON, 13.5¬†% fat), a high-fat ad libitum diet (HFa, 45¬†% fat), or a high-fat food-restricted diet (HFr, 45¬†% fat, maintaining the same weight as CON) for 12¬†weeks. Body weight, blood pressure, heart weight, triglycerides, insulin, HOMAIR, interstitial spaces, cardiac fibrosis, and cardiac TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells were increased in HFa relative to CON, whereas these parameters were decreased in HFr relative to HFa. The protein levels of cardiac Fas ligand, Fas receptors, Fas-associated death domain (FADD), activated caspase-8, and activated caspase-3 (Fas receptor-dependent apoptotic pathways), as well as t-Bid/Bid, Bax/Bcl-2, Bad/p-Bad, Cytochrome c, activated caspase-9, and activated caspase-3 (mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathways) in HFr were lower than those in HFa. Moreover, the Bcl-xL and IGF-1-related components of IGF-1, p-PI3¬†K/PI3¬†K, p-Akt/Akt in HFr were higher than those in HFa. Our findings suggest that a restricted high-fat diet for maintaining weight control could diminish cardiac Fas receptor-dependent and mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathways as well as might enhance IGF-1-related pro-survival pathways. In sum, food restriction for maintaining normal weight could elicit anti-apoptotic and pro-survival effects on high-fat diet-induced obese hearts.
During studies on chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in lymphoid cells, we noted that aggregation of spectrin occurred early in apoptosis, i.e. before activation of initiator caspase(s) and prior to exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS). We also found that protein kinase C theta (PKC-Œ∏) co-localized with spectrin in these aggregates. Our previously published studies indicated that in formation of early apoptotic spectrin aggregates, either PKC-Œ∏ or other apoptosis-related proteins are involved. Taking into consideration above data, we decided to test the effect of PKC-Œ∏ and Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) on spectrin aggregation in these cells during tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis.
For PKC-Œ∏ gene (PRKCQ) or FADD gene expression silencing in Jurkat T cells we used lentiviral particles containing shRNA and scrambled shRNA, respectively. Spectrin aggregates were detected by Western blotting after Triton-X 100 extraction in pellet and soluble fractions or by confocal imaging.
TRAIL-induced apoptosis results in spectrin aggregation and leads to translocation and aggregation of PKC-Œ∏. We found that phorbol-myristate acetate, a PKC activator and translocation inducer, has only a small effect on spectrin aggregation. To further confirm this, we have also shown that knock down ofPRKCQin Jurkat T cells accelerates the formation of TRAIL-induced spectrin aggregates. Transient overexpression of theŒ≤-spectrin C-terminal fragment, containing multiple S/T phosphorylation sites, potential substrate sites for PKC-Œ∏, accelerated the formation of spectrin aggregates. Silencing of downstream TRAIL receptor effector gene,FADD, delayed aggregation of spectrin, but did not reduce PKC-Œ∏ localization to the plasma membrane.
In summary, our results show for the first time involvement of spectrin aggregation in TRAIL receptor-FADD apoptotic pathway and indicate that TRAIL-induced spectrin aggregate formation is mediated by FADD and negatively regulated by PKC-Œ∏.
Death receptor (DR) ligands such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) have been identified as fundamental mediators of liver damage both in mouse models and in humans. While the essential site of function of DR signaling is conceivably the hepatocyte, a systematic analysis is missing. Using mice with conditional gene ablation, we analyzed the tissue-specific function of DR signaling in T cell-dependent (concanavalin A) and independent (lipopolysaccharide/galactosamine) hepatitis and in models of bacterial infection (Listeria monocytogenes, lipopolysaccharide). We report that lipopolysaccharide/galactosamine-induced liver injury depends on hepatocyte-intrinsic TNF receptor 1 (p55, TNFR1). In contrast, we show that T cell-induced hepatitis was independent of TNFR1 signaling in hepatocytes, T cells, or endothelial cells. Moreover, T cell-induced hepatitis was independent of hepatocyte-intrinsic Fas-associated protein with death domain, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor, or Fas signaling. Instead, concanavalin A-induced hepatitis was completely prevented in mice with myeloid-derived cell (MDC)-specific deletion of TNFR1. Significantly, however, mice lacking TNFR1 in MDCs succumbed to listeria infection, although they displayed similar sensitivity toward endotoxin-induced septic shock when compared to control mice. These results suggest that TNFR1 signaling in MDCs is a critical mediator of both the detrimental and the protective functions of TNF in T cell-induced hepatitis and bacterial infection, respectively.
The critical site of action of DRs is completely dependent on the nature of hepatitis; the data specify MDCs as the essential cell type of TNFR1 function in T cell-mediated hepatitis and in the response to listeria, thereby identifying the opposing role of MDC TNFR1 in autoimmunity and bacterial infection. (Hepatology 2016;64:508-521).
Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) regulate gut immune homeostasis, and impaired epithelial responses are implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). IEC-specific ablation of nuclear factor Œ∫B (NF-Œ∫B) essential modulator (NEMO) caused Paneth cell apoptosis and impaired antimicrobial factor expression in the ileum, as well as colonocyte apoptosis and microbiota-driven chronic inflammation in the colon. Combined RelA, c-Rel, and RelB deficiency in IECs caused Paneth cell apoptosis but not colitis, suggesting that NEMO prevents colon inflammation by NF-Œ∫B-independent functions. Inhibition of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) kinase activity or combined deficiency of Fas-associated via death domain protein (FADD) and RIPK3 prevented epithelial cell death, Paneth cell loss, and colitis development in mice with epithelial NEMO deficiency. Therefore, NEMO prevents intestinal inflammation by inhibiting RIPK1 kinase activity-mediated IEC death, suggesting that RIPK1 inhibitors could be effective in the treatment of colitis in patients with NEMO mutations and possibly in IBD. 
We aimed to analyze the association of NFŒ∫B signaling pathway with the carcinogenesis of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC).
Protein array was used to identify the differentially expressed proteins involved in NFŒ∫B signaling pathway between LSCC cells and normal throat mucosa. Correlation analysis between significantly expressed proteins and clinical characteristics (differentiation, clinical stage, and node metastasis) was performed. The expression of IŒ∫B kinase-Œ≤ (IKK-Œ≤) in Hep-2 cells transfected with IKK-Œ≤-siRNA or pcDNA3.1-IKK-Œ≤ was detected both by real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot. Besides, a tetrazolium-based colorimetric assay (MTT), flow cytometer, and transwell assay were used to examine the proliferation, apoptosis, and migration rate of Hep-2 cells, respectively.
Three differentially expressed proteins were identified. Among them, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) and IKK-Œ≤ were significantly up-regulated (p &lt; 0.01) and Fas-associated via death domain (FADD) was significantly down-regulated (p &lt; 0.01). The correlation analysis showed that IKK-Œ≤ expression had a significant association with differentiation, clinical stage, and node metastasis (p &lt; 0.05). Besides, high expressed IKK-Œ≤ resulted in significantly increased proliferation and migration rate (p &lt; 0.05). Reversely, Hep-2 cells transfected with IKK-Œ≤-siRNA showed significantly lower proliferation and migration rate (p &lt; 0.05) and significantly higher apoptosis rate (p &lt; 0.05) than normal cells.
The NFŒ∫B signaling pathway involved TNFR1, IKK-Œ≤, and FADD is significantly associated with the development of LSCC. Over-expressed IKK-Œ≤ efficiently inhibits cell apoptosis and has positive effects on cell proliferation and migration.
The prognosis of metastatic or relapsed renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is still very poor, highlighting the need for new treatment strategies. Here, we identify a cooperative antitumor activity of interferon-Œ± (IFNŒ±) together with the Smac mimetic BV6 that antagonizes antiapoptotic IAP proteins. BV6 and IFNŒ± act together to reduce cell viability and to induce apoptosis in various RCC cell lines. Molecular studies revealed that BV6/IFNŒ± co-treatment triggers apoptosis independently of autocrine/paracrine Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)Œ± signaling, since the TNFŒ±-blocking antibody Enbrel fails to rescue cell death. Importantly, knockdown of Receptor-Interacting Protein (RIP)1 significantly decreases BV6/IFNŒ±-mediated apoptosis, whereas the RIP1 kinase inhibitor necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) provides no protection. This demonstrates that RIP1 protein is critically required for BV6/IFNŒ±-induced apoptosis, while RIP1 kinase activity is dispensable, pointing to a scaffold function of RIP1. Consistently, BV6 and IFNŒ± cooperate to trigger the interaction of RIP1, Fas-Associated Death Domain protein (FADD) and caspase-8 to form a cytosolic cell death complex that drives caspase activation. Addition of the broad-range caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD.fmk) significantly protects RCC cells against BV6/IFNŒ±-induced apoptosis, demonstrating that caspase activity is required for apoptosis. In conclusion, the combination approach of IFNŒ± and BV6 represents a promising strategy for cooperative induction of apoptosis in RCC cells, which warrants further investigation. 
Under the premise of smoke inhalation injury, to explore the effects of microRNA-146a on Fas-associated factor 2 (FAF-2) and inflammatory factors in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells under the stimulation of cigarette smoke extract (CSE).
(1) The pMIR-FAF-2 recombinant plasmid and the pMIR-FAF-2 recombinant mutated plasmid were constructed. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells of the third passage were divided into 3 groups according to the random number table, with 5 wells in each group. Cells in plasmid+ microRNA control group were transfected with pMIR-FAF-2 recombinant plasmid, pRL-TK plasmid, and microRNA control; cells in plasmid+ microRNA-146a group were transfected with pMIR-FAF-2 recombinant plasmid, pRL-TK plasmid, and microRNA-146a mimics; cells in mutated plasmid+ microRNA-146a group were transfected with pMIR-FAF-2 recombinant mutated plasmid, pRL-TK plasmid, and microRNA-146a inhibitor. After culture for 24 h, the relative luciferase activity in cells was assessed by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. (2) Human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells of the third passage were divided into 3 groups according to the random number table, with 4 wells in each group. Cells in microRNA control group were transfected with microRNA control; cells in microRNA-146a enhancement group were transfected with microRNA-146a mimics; cells in microRNA-146a inhibition group were transfected with microRNA-146a inhibitor. After culture for 24 h, the mRNA expression levels of microRNA-146a and FAF-2 in cells were determined with real-time fluorescent quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. (3) A549 cells of the third passage were stimulated by 0.8% CSE for 24 h after being divided and treated with the same method used in experiment (2). The mRNA expression levels of FAF-2, IL-8, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and growth-regulated oncogene-Œ± (GRO-Œ±) in cells were determined with real-time fluorescent quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. The protein expression levels of IL-8, MCP-1, and GRO-Œ± in A549 cell culture supernatant were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The protein expression level of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) of cells was assessed by Western blotting. Data were processed with one-way analysis of variance and LSD test.
(1) The pMIR-FAF-2 recombinant plasmid and pMIR-FAF-2 recombinant mutated plasmid were confirmed with successful construction. The relative luciferase activity in HEK-23 cells of plasmid+ microRNA control group was close to that of mutated plasmid+ microRNA-146a group (P&gt;0.05). The relative luciferase activity in HEK-23 cells of plasmid+ microRNA-146a group was significantly lower than that of plasmid+ microRNA control group and mutated plasmid+ microRNA-146a group (with P values below 0.01). (2) The expression level of microRNA-146a in A549 cells of microRNA control group was close to that of microRNA-146a inhibition group (P&gt;0.05), and they were both significantly lower than the expression level of microRNA-146a in A549 cells of microRNA-146a enhancement group (with P values below 0.01). The mRNA expression level of FAF-2 in A549 cells of microRNA control group was close to that of microRNA-146a inhibition group (P&gt;0.05), and they were both significantly higher than the mRNA expression level of FAF-2 in A549 cells of microRNA-146a enhancement group (with P values below 0.05). (3) After stimulation of CSE, the mRNA expression level of FAF-2 in A549 cells of microRNA control group (1.46¬±0.21) was close to that of microRNA-146a inhibition group (1.43¬±0.34, P&gt;0.05), which were both significantly higher than the mRNA expression level of FAF-2 in A549 cells of microRNA-146a enhancement group (0.57¬±0.11, with P values below 0.05). The mRNA expression levels of IL-8, MCP-1, and GRO-Œ± in A549 cells of microRNA-146a enhancement group were significantly lower than those of microRNA control group and microRNA-146a inhibition group (with P values below 0.01). The mRNA expression levels of IL-8, MCP-1, and GRO-Œ± in A549 cells of microRNA-146a inhibition group were significantly higher than those of microRNA control group (with P values below 0.05). The protein expression levels of IL-8, MCP-1, and GRO-Œ± in A549 cell culture supernatant of microRNA-146a enhancement group were significantly lower than those of microRNA control group and microRNA-146a inhibition group (with P values below 0.05). The protein expression level of IL-8 in A549 cell culture supernatant of microRNA-146a inhibition group was close to that of microRNA control group (P&gt;0.05), while the protein expression levels of MCP-1 and GRO-Œ± in A549 cell culture supernatant of microRNA-146a inhibition group were significantly lower than those of microRNA control group (with P values below 0.05). The protein expression level of COX-2 in A549 cells of microRNA-146a enhancement group was significantly lower than the levels of microRNA control group and microRNA-146a inhibition group (with P values below 0.05). The protein expression level of COX-2 in A549 cells of microRNA control group was close to that of microRNA-146a inhibition group (P&gt;0.05).
In A549 cells, after being transfected with microRNA-146a and stimulated by CSE, microRNA-146a can decrease the expression of FAF-2 through integrating with the 3'-untranslated region of target gene FAF-2, thereby decrease the expression of inflammatory factors.
This study is designed to examine the cellular functions of human Fas-associated factor 1 (FAF1) containing multiple ubiquitin-related domains. Microarray analyses revealed that interferon-stimulated genes related to the antiviral response are significantly increased in FAF1-knockdown HeLa cells. Silencing FAF1 enhanced the poly(I¬∑C)- and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-induced production of type I interferons (IFNs), the target genes of interferon regulator factor 3 (IRF3). IRF3 is a key transcription factor in IFN-Œ≤ signaling responsible for the host innate immune response. This study also found that FAF1 and IRF3 physically associate with IPO5/importin-Œ≤3 and that overexpression of FAF1 reduces the interaction between IRF3 and IPO5/importin-Œ≤3. These findings suggest that FAF1 negatively regulates IRF3-mediated IFN-Œ≤ production and the antiviral innate immune response by regulating nuclear translocation of IRF3. We conclude that FAF1 plays a novel role in negatively regulating virus-induced IFN-Œ≤ production and the antiviral response by inhibiting the translocation of active, phosphorylated IRF3 from the cytosol to the nucleus. 
Only very limited information regarding the protective effects of the superoxide anion scavenger on chronic intermittent hypoxia-induced cardiac apoptosis is available. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of the superoxide anion scavenger on cardiac apoptotic and prosurvival pathways in rats with sleep apnea. Forty-two Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups, rats with normoxic exposure (Control, 21% O2, 1 mo), rats with chronic intermittent hypoxia exposure (Hypoxia, 3-7% O2vs. 21% O2per 40 s cycle, 8 h per day, 1 mo), and rats with pretreatment of the superoxide anion scavenger and chronic intermittent hypoxia exposure (Hypoxia-O2 (-)-Scavenger, MnTMPyP pentachloride, 1 mg/kg ip per day; 3-7% O2vs. 21% O2per 40 s cycle, 8 h per day, 1 mo) at 5-6 mo of age. After 1 mo, the protein levels and apoptotic cells of excised hearts from three groups were measured by Western blotting and terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. The superoxide anion scavenger decreased hypoxia-induced myocardial architecture abnormalities, left ventricular hypertrophy, and TUNEL-positive apoptosis. The superoxide anion scavenger decreased hypoxia-induced Fas ligand, Fas death receptors, Fas-associated death domain (FADD), activated caspase-8, and activated caspase-3 (Fas-dependent apoptotic pathway) as well as Bad, activated caspase-9 and activated caspase-3 (mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway), endonuclease G (EndoG), apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), and TUNEL-positive apoptosis. The superoxide anion scavenger increased IGF-1, IGF-1R, p-PI3k, p-Akt, p-Bad, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL (survival pathway). Our findings imply that the superoxide anion scavenger might prevent cardiac Fas-mediated and mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis and enhance the IGF-1-related survival pathway in chronic intermittent hypoxia. The superoxide anion scavenger may prevent chronic sleep apnea-enhanced cardiac apoptotic pathways and enhances cardiac survival pathways. 
TNF is a primitive protein that has emerged from more than 550 million years of evolution. Our bioinformatics study of TNF from nine different taxa in vertebrates revealed several conserved regions in the TNF sequence. By screening overlapping peptides derived from human TNF to determine their role in three different TNF-induced processes--apoptosis, necrosis and NF-Œ∫B stimulation--we found that TNF conserved regions are mostly related to cell death rather than NF-Œ∫B stimulation. Among the most conserved regions, peptides (P)12, P13 and P1213 (comprising P12 and P13) induced apoptosis, whereas P14, P15, P16 and P1516 (comprising P15 and P16) induced necrosis. Cell death induced by these peptides was not through binding to the TNF receptor. P16-induced necrosis was mainly through disruption of the cell membrane, whereas P1213-induced apoptosis involved activation of TRADD followed by formation of complex II. Finally, using a monoclonal antibody and a mutant TNF protein, we show that TNF-induced apoptosis is determined by a conserved linear sequence that corresponds to that within P1213. Our results reveal the determinant sequence that is key to the TNF primitive function of inducing apoptosis.
Emergency granulopoiesis occurs in response to infectious or inflammatory challenge and is a component of the innate immune response. Some molecular events involved in initiating emergency granulopoiesis are known, but termination of this process is less well defined. In this study, we found that the interferon consensus sequence binding protein (Icsbp/Irf8) was required to terminate emergency granulopoiesis. Icsbp is an interferon regulatory transcription factor with leukemia suppressor activity. Expression of Icsbp is decreased in chronic myeloid leukemia, and Icsbp(-/-) mice exhibit progressive granulocytosis with evolution to blast crisis, similar to the course of human chronic myeloid leukemia. In this study, we found aberrantly sustained granulocyte production in Icsbp(-/-) mice after stimulation of an emergency granulopoiesis response. Icsbp represses transcription of the genes encoding Fas-associated phosphatase 1 (Fap1) and growth arrest-specific 2 (Gas2) and activates genes encoding Fanconi C and F. After stimulation of emergency granulopoiesis, we found increased and sustained expression of Fap1 and Gas2 in bone marrow myeloid progenitor cells from Icsbp(-/-) mice in comparison with the wild type. This was associated with resistance to Fas-induced apoptosis and increased Œ≤-catenin activity in these cells. We also found that repeated episodes of emergency granulopoiesis accelerated progression to acute myeloid leukemia in Icsbp(-/-) mice. This was associated with impaired Fanconi C and F expression and increased sensitivity to DNA damage in bone marrow myeloid progenitors. Our results suggest that impaired Icsbp expression enhances leukemogenesis by deregulating processes that normally limit granulocyte expansion during the innate immune response. 
The relevance of IL-33 and its receptor ST2 for bone remodeling is not well-defined. Our aim was to assess the role and underlying mechanisms of IL-33/ST2 in mechanically induced bone remodeling. BALB/c (wild type) and ST2 deficient (St2(-/-)) mice were subjected to mechanical loading in alveolar bone. Microtomography, histology, and real-time quantitative PCR were performed to analyze bone parameters, apoptosis and bone cell counts, and expression of bone remodeling markers, respectively. MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells and bone marrow cells were used to verify if mechanical force triggered IL-33 and ST2 expression as well as the effects of IL-33 on osteoclast differentiation and activity. Mechanical loading increased the expression of IL-33 and ST2 in alveolar bone in vivo and in osteoblastic cells in vitro. St2(-/-) mice had increased mechanical loading-induced bone resorption, number of osteoclasts, and expression of proresorptive markers. In contrast, St2(-/-) mice exhibited reduced numbers of osteoblasts and apoptotic cells in periodontium and diminished expression of osteoblast signaling molecules. In vitro, IL-33 treatment inhibited osteoclast differentiation and activity even in the presence of receptor activator of NF-Œ∫B ligand. IL-33 also increased the expression of pro-apoptotic molecules, including Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX), cell-surface Fas receptor (FAS), FASL, FAS-associated death domain, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, and BH3 interacting-domain death (BID). Overall, these findings suggest that IL-33/ST2 have anti-osteoclastogenic effects and reduce osteoclast formation and activity by inducing their apoptosis.
Increase in the apoptotic molecule Fas ligand (FasL) in serum and cardiomyocytes has been shown to be associated with progressive dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and congestive heart failure (CHF) in humans. However, the underlying mechanism(s) of FasL-related deterioration of heart function remain obscure. The aim of the present study is to determine roles of myocardial FasL in the activation of alternative pathways such as extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), inflammation or fibrosis and to identify effective treatments of progressive DCM and advanced CHF. Transgenic mice with cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of FasL were investigated and treated with an ERK1/2 inhibitor (U-0126), losartan (los), prednisolone (pred) or placebo. Morpho-histological and molecular studies were subsequently performed. FasL mice showed significantly higher mortality compared with wild-type (WT) littermates due to DCM and advanced CHF. Prominent perivascular and interstitial fibrosis, increased interleukin secretion and diffuse CD3-positive cell infiltration were evident in FasL hearts. Up-regulation of the short form of Fas-associated death domain (FADD)-like interleukin 1Œ≤-converting enzyme (FLICE) inhibitory protein (s-FLIP), RIP (receptor-interacting protein) and ERK1/2 and down-regulation of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFŒ≤1) and nuclear factor-Œ∫B (NF-Œ∫B) was determined in the myocardium, whereas expression of ERK1/2, periostin (Postn) and osteopontin increased in cardiac fibroblasts. U-0126 and los increased CHF survival by 75% compared with pred and placebo groups. U-0126 had both anti-fibrotic and anti-apoptotic effects, whereas los reduced fibrosis only. Myocardial FasL expression in mice activates differential robust fibrotic, apoptotic and inflammatory responses via ERK1/2 in cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts inducing DCM and CHF. Blocking the ERK1/2 pathway prevented progression of FasL-induced DCM and CHF by reducing fibrosis, inflammation and apoptosis in the myocardium.
Treatment of interferon-Œ≥ (IFN-Œ≥) causes cell growth inhibition and cytotoxicity in lung epithelial malignancies. Regarding the induction of autophagy related to IFN-Œ≥ signaling, this study investigated the link between autophagy and IFN-Œ≥ cytotoxicity. In A549 human lung cancer cells, IFN-Œ≥ treatment induced concurrent apoptotic and nonapoptotic events. Unexpectedly, the nonapoptotic cells present mimic extracellular trap cell death (ETosis), which was regulated by caspase-3 and by autophagy induction through immunity-related GTPase family M protein 1 and activating transcription factor 6. Furthermore, IFN-Œ≥ signaling controlled mimic ETosis through a mechanism involving an autophagy- and Fas-associated protein with death domain-controlled caspase-8/-3 activation. Following caspase-mediated lamin degradation, IFN-Œ≥ caused DNA damage-associated ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR)/ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-regulated mimic ETosis. Upon ATR/ATM signaling, peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4)-mediated histone 3 citrullination promoted mimic ETosis. Such IFN-Œ≥-induced effects were defective in PC14PE6/AS2 human lung cancer cells, which were unsusceptible to IFN-Œ≥-induced autophagy. Due to autophagy-based caspase cascade activation, IFN-Œ≥ triggers unconventional caspase-mediated DNA damage, followed by ATR/ATM-regulated PAD4-mediated histone citrullination during mimic ETosis in lung epithelial malignancy. 
The role of death receptor 5 (DR5), a well-known cell surface pro-apoptotic protein, in the negative regulation of invasion and metastasis of human cancer cells and the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown and were hence the focus of this study. In this report, we have demonstrated that DR5 functions to suppress invasion and metastasis of human cancer cells, as evidenced by enhanced cancer cell invasion and metastasis upon genetic suppression of DR5 either by gene knockdown or knockout. When DR5 is suppressed, FADD and caspase-8 may recruit and stabilize TRAF2 to form a metastasis and invasion signaling complex, resulting in activation of ERK and JNK/AP-1 signaling that mediate the elevation and activation of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1) and eventual promotion of cancer invasion and metastasis. Our findings thus highlight a novel non-apoptotic function of DR5 as a suppressor of human cancer cell invasion and metastasis and suggest a basic working model elucidating the underlying biology. 
The immune system-released activating agent (ISRAA) is an immune mediator activated as a result of a nerve stimulus initiated by immune challenge. We have previously demonstrated that ISRAA and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 1 (TNFR1) share an interspecies-conserved motif (72% homology) that induces the apoptosis and proliferation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs) in a dose-dependent manner. In the present study, cytokine profiles were examined in response to the stimulation of hPBMCs with ISRAA. Furthermore, the signaling pathways induced by ISRAA were mapped. The results revealed high measurable levels of TNF-Œ±, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10 and interferon (IFN)-Œ≥, but not IL-4, IL-17 (IL-17A) or transforming growth factor (TGF)-Œ≤. The analysis of signaling pathways revealed the activation of extracellular-regulated protein kinase (ERK)1/2 as a downstream signal in the mitogen‚Äëactivated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway during TNF‚ÄëŒ± and IL-6 production and apoptosis, but not during proliferation following stimulation with ISRAA by triggering the Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD). STAT3 was found to be unphosphorylated in the ISRAA‚Äëstimulated hPBMCs, and STAT3 was ubiquitously expressed in unstimulated cells, suggesting that ISRAA has a protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS)-like activity, by functioning as a negative regulator of the effects of STAT3 on the Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT pathway. The determination of the nature of cytokine responses together with the signaling pathways of cellular activity induced by ISRAA paves the way for the investigation of a potential target of ISRAA and for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of immune-regulated disorders.
Some cancer cells exhibit elevated levels of free fatty acids (FAs) as well as high levels of Œ≤-catenin, a transcriptional co-activator that promotes their growth. Here, we link these two phenomena by showing that unsaturated FAs inhibit degradation of Œ≤-catenin. Unsaturated FAs bind to the UAS domain of Fas-associated factor 1 (FAF1), a protein known to bind Œ≤-catenin, accelerating its degradation. FA binding disrupts the FAF1/Œ≤-catenin complex, preventing proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated Œ≤-catenin. This mechanism for stabilization of Œ≤-catenin differs from that of Wnt signaling, which blocks ubiquitination of Œ≤-catenin. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cells, unsaturated FAs stimulated cell proliferation through stabilization of Œ≤-catenin. In tissues from biopsies of human ccRCC, elevated levels of unsaturated FAs correlated with increased levels of Œ≤-catenin. Thus, targeting FAF1 may be an effective approach to treat cancers that exhibit elevated FAs and Œ≤-catenin. 
Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) arises from a human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I)-infected cell and has few therapeutic options. Here, we have uncovered a previously unrecognized role for a ubiquitin-editing enzyme A20 in the survival of HTLV-I-infected cells. Unlike in lymphomas of the B-cell lineage, A20 is abundantly expressed in primary ATL cells without notable mutations. Depletion of A20 in HTLV-I-infected cells resulted in caspase activation, cell death induction and impaired tumorigenicity in mouse xenograft models. Mechanistically, A20 stably interacts with caspase-8 and Fas-associated via death domain (FADD) in HTLV-I-infected cells. Mutational studies revealed that A20 supports the growth of HTLV-I-infected cells independent of its catalytic functions and that the zinc-finger domains are required for the interaction with and regulation of caspases. These results indicate a pivotal role for A20 in the survival of HTLV-I-infected cells and implicate A20 as a potential therapeutic target in ATL. 
Secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Aging is a physiological process that involves progressive impairment of normal heart functions due to increased vulnerability to damage. This study examines secondhand smoke exposure in aging rats to determine the age-related death-survival balance.
Rats were placed into a SHS exposure chamber and exposed to smog. Old age male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 10 cigarettes for 30 min, day and night, continuing for one week. After 4 weeks the rats underwent morphological and functional studies. Left ventricular sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin for histopathological examination. TUNEL detected apoptosis cells and protein expression related death and survival pathway were analyzed using western blot.
Death receptor-dependent apoptosis upregulation pathways and the mitochondria apoptosis proteins were apparent in young SHS exposure and old age rats. These biological markers were enhanced in aging SHS-exposed rats. The survival pathway was found to exhibit compensation only in young SHS-exposed rats, but not in the aging rats. Further decrease in the activity of this pathway was observed in aging SHS-exposed rats. TUNEL apoptotic positive cells were increased in young SHS-exposed rats, and in aging rats with or without SHS-exposure.
Aging reduces IGF-I compensated signaling with accelerated cardiac apoptotic effects from second-hand smoke.
TNF is a master pro-inflammatory cytokine. Activation of TNFR1 by TNF can result in both RIPK1-independent apoptosis and RIPK1 kinase-dependent apoptosis or necroptosis. These cell death outcomes are regulated by two distinct checkpoints during TNFR1 signaling. TNF-mediated NF-Œ∫B-dependent induction of pro-survival or anti-apoptotic molecules is a well-known late checkpoint in the pathway, protecting cells from RIPK1-independent death. On the other hand, the molecular mechanism regulating the contribution of RIPK1 to cell death is far less understood. We demonstrate here that the IKK complex phosphorylates RIPK1 at TNFR1 complex I and protects cells from RIPK1 kinase-dependent death, independent of its function in NF-Œ∫B activation. We provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that inhibition of IKKŒ±/IKKŒ≤ or its upstream activators sensitizes cells to death by inducing RIPK1 kinase-dependent apoptosis or necroptosis. We therefore report on an unexpected, NF-Œ∫B-independent role for the IKK complex in protecting cells from RIPK1-dependent death downstream of TNFR1.
Cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIP, gene symbol CFLAR) was first identified as a negative regulator of death receptor-mediated apoptosis in mammals. To understand the ubiquity and diversity of the c-FLIP protein subfamily during evolution, c-FLIP orthologs were identified from a comprehensive range of vertebrates, including birds, amphibians, and fish, and were characterized by combining experimental and computational analysis. Predictions of three-dimensional protein structures and molecular phylogenetic analysis indicated that the conserved structural features of c-FLIP proteins are all derived from an ancestral caspase-8, although they rapidly diverged from the subfamily consisting of caspases-8, -10, and -18. The functional role of the c-FLIP subfamily members is nearly ubiquitous throughout vertebrates. Exogenous expression of non-mammalian c-FLIP proteins in cultured mammalian cells suppressed death receptor-mediated apoptosis, implying that all of these proteins possess anti-apoptotic activity. Furthermore, non-mammalian c-FLIP proteins induced NF-Œ∫B activation much like their mammalian counterparts. The CFLAR mRNAs were synthesized during frog and fish embryogenesis. Overexpression of a truncated mutant of c-FLIP in the Xenopus laevis embryos by mRNA microinjection caused thorax edema and abnormal constriction of the abdomen. Depletion of cflar transcripts in zebrafish resulted in developmental abnormalities accompanied by edema and irregular red blood cell flow. Thus, our results demonstrate that c-FLIP/CFLAR is conserved in both protein structure and function in several vertebrate species, and suggest a significant role of c-FLIP in embryonic development.
The enzyme N-glycanase 1 (NGLY1) is considered a component of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery and clinical manifestations of its dysfunction include global developmental delay, a movement disorder, peripheral neuropathy, liver disorders, microcephaly, diminished reflexes and seizures. Although several mutations in NGLY1 have been identified, the relation between the defected protein and the above described pathologies is yet unknown. We hypothesised that NGLY1 failure to degrade certain proteins may result in their accumulation and overexpression and used a systems biology approach to identify proteins that may be affected by NGLY1 deficiency. Genes that interact with the NGLY1 gene according to BioGRID database of physical and genetic interactions were analysed with STRING Protein-Protein interaction database. Network analysis identified FAF1 (Fas-Associated Factor 1), an apoptosis-potentiating protein, as a possible degradation substrate of NGLY1. Examination of normal tissue microarrays demonstrated that FAF1-to-NGLY1 ratio is maximal (more than 3:1) in skeletal muscle and brain tissues microarrays. This evidence may explain the pathologies in brain and muscle tissues of patients with mutated NGLY1. To test this hypothesis, laboratory studies that will assess if FAF1 protein is overexpressed in tissues of patients with mutated NGLY1 are required. 
Dysfunction of the cholinergic system of the basal forebrain complex is one of the major contributors toward cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD, degeneration of cholinergic fibers that project to the cerebral cortex and hippocampus may be attributed to the development of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). Here, we evaluated the relationship between neurofibrillary changes and degeneration of septal cholinergic neurons in P301L tau transgenic mice. The number of cholinergic neurons in the medial septum and vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca (MS/VDB) in the basal forebrain was significantly reduced in P301L mice compared with age-matched wild-type mice. The phospho-tau levels and NFT formation in these P301L mice were higher than those in wild-type mice. However, it is still unknown how the development of NFT is caused in AD and AD-like pathology. Our results show that Fas-associated factor 1 (FAF1) expression as well as caspase-3 activation were increased in AT8-positive MS/VDB cholinergic neurons. Furthermore, the formation of AT8-positive paired helical filaments increased in proportion to FAF1 expression and caspase-3 activation in MS/VDB cholinergic neurons. On the basis of the collective findings, we suggest that increased FAF1 expression triggers caspase-3 cleavage and activation, leading to hyperphosphorylated tau aggregation and subsequent NFT formation, in turn initiating apoptosis in MS/VDB cholinergic neurons. 
Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) has potent antitumor effects in glioma cell lines but has shown little clinical benefit for patients. We investigated whether the widely used chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide (TMZ) can sensitize glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) from human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. GSCs were isolated from GBM, and stem cell properties were confirmed by immunocytochemistry and in vivo tumorigenicity. Primary GSCs (PGCs) were produced by serum treatment of GBM-derived cells. Changes in expression levels of various TRAIL-related signaling factors before and after TRAIL or TRAIL‚Äâ+‚ÄâTMZ treatment were measured by Western blotting. Overexpression vectors and siRNAs were used to investigate mechanism of TRAIL sensitivity. GSCs showed greater resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis than PGCs and had lower basal caspase activity. Caspase knockdown in PGCs reduced TRAIL sensitivity. Expression levels of c-Fas-associated death domain-like interleukin 1-converting enzyme-like inhibitory protein long and short isoforms (c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS) were significantly higher in GSCs than PGCs, and siRNA-mediated c-FLIP knockdown in GSCs enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis. TMZ enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis in GSCs and downregulated c-FLIP expression. Add of TMZ also upregulated the expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase casitas B-lineage lymphoma (c-Cbl). Moreover, overexpression of c-Cbl alone reduced c-FLIP expression, and c-Cbl knockdown both enhanced c-FLIP expression and reduced the potentiating effect of TMZ on TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The result indicated that TMZ may overcome TRAIL resistance in GSCs by suppressing c-FLIP expression through c-Cbl-mediated ubiquitination and degradation.
Malignant melanoma is a highly aggressive tumor which may occur in the skin, eye, and mucous membranes. The prognosis of melanoma remains poor in spite of therapeutic advances, emphasizing the importance of innovative treatment modalities. Currently, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is showing promising clinical responses, however its use is hampered by intrinsic or acquired melanoma resistance to apoptosis. Recently, we showed that the combination of TRAIL with the class I-specific histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) MS-275 was a privileged way to override TRAIL resistance through down-regulation of cellular Fas-associated death domain (FADD)-like interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP). Here, we elucidated the underlying mechanism and provided evidence that a crucial step in the c-FLIP downregulation triggered by MS-275 implies the up-regulation of c-myc, a transcriptional repressor of c-FLIP. Notably, MS-275 caused H3 histone acetylation at the promoter of c-myc and increased its binding to the c-FLIP promoter, that in turn led to reduced c-FLIP gene transcription. Knockdown of c-myc prevented the MS-275-mediated downregulation of c-FLIP and hindered TRAIL-plus MS-275-induced apoptosis. Findings reported here provide additional knowledge tools for a more aware and effective molecular therapy of melanoma. 
TLR2 promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation via an early MyD88-IRAK1-dependent pathway that provides a priming signal (signal 1) necessary for activation of the inflammasome by a second potassium-depleting signal (signal 2). Here we show that TLR3 binding to dsRNA promotes post-translational inflammasome activation through intermediate and late TRIF/RIPK1/FADD-dependent pathways. Both pathways require the scaffolding but not the catalytic function of caspase-8 or RIPK1. Only the late pathway requires kinase competent RIPK3 and MLKL function. Mechanistically, FADD/caspase-8 scaffolding function provides a post-translational signal 1 in the intermediate pathway, whereas in the late pathway it helps the oligomerization of RIPK3, which together with MLKL provides both signal 1 and 2 for inflammasome assembly. Cytoplasmic dsRNA activates NLRP3 independent of TRIF, RIPK1, RIPK3 or mitochondrial DRP1, but requires FADD/caspase-8 in wildtype macrophages to remove RIPK3 inhibition. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of pathways that lead to NLRP3 inflammasome activation in response to dsRNA. 
Apoptosis and programmed necrosis (necroptosis) determine cell fate, and antagonize infection. Execution of these complementary death pathways involves the formation of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) containing complexes. RIPK1 binds to adaptor proteins, such as TRIF (Toll-IL-1 receptor-domain-containing-adaptor-inducing interferon-beta factor), FADD (Fas-associated-protein with death domain), NEMO (NF-Œ∫B regulatory subunit IKKŒ≥), SQSTM1 (sequestosome 1/p62), or RIPK3 (receptor-interacting protein kinase 3), which are involved in RNA sensing, NF-Œ∫B signaling, autophagosome formation, apoptosis, and necroptosis. We report that a range of rhinoviruses impair apoptosis and necroptosis in epithelial cells late in infection. Unlike the double-strand (ds) RNA mimetic poly I:C (polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid), the exposure of dsRNA to toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) in rhinovirus-infected cells did not lead to apoptosis execution. Accordingly, necroptosis and the production of ROS (reactive oxygen species) were not observed late in infection, when RIPK3 was absent. Instead, a virus-induced alternative necrotic cell death pathway proceeded, which led to membrane rupture, indicated by propidium iodide staining. The impairment of dsRNA-induced apoptosis late in infection was controlled by the viral 3C-protease (3Cpro), which disrupted RIPK1-TRIF/FADD /SQSTM1 immune-complexes. 3Cpro and 3C precursors were found to coimmuno-precipitate with RIPK1, cleaving the RIPK1 death-domain, and generating N-terminal RIPK1 fragments. The depletion of RIPK1 or chemical inhibition of its kinase at the N-terminus did not interfere with virus progeny formation or cell fate. The data show that rhinoviruses suppress apoptosis and necroptosis, and release progeny by an alternative cell death pathway, which is controlled by viral proteases modifying innate immune complexes.
Fas-associated protein factor 1 (FAF1) is a Fas-associated protein that functions in multiple cellular processes. Previous research showed that mutations in Faf1 led to the lethality of cleavage stage embryos in a mouse model. The aim of the present study was to analyze the expression pattern, localization, and function of FAF1 in meiotic resumption of mouse oocytes. FAF1 was exclusively expressed in oocytes at various follicular stages within the ovary and was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm of growing oocytes. Furthermore, Faf1 mRNA and protein were persistently present during oocyte maturation and Faf1 mRNA levels were similar in the germinal vesicle (GV), GV breakdown (GVBD), and metaphase II (MII) stages of oocytes. Moreover, knockdown of Faf1 in GV-stage oocytes led to a significantly decreased rate of GVBD. To our knowledge, these results provide the first evidence regarding a novel function of FAF1 in meiotic resumption in mouse oocytes.
The Fas/FasL signaling pathway is one of the major pathways that regulate apoptosis. Increasing studies have shown that the activation of the Fas/FasL signaling pathway is closely associated with testicular cell apoptosis. However, the mechanism involved is still unclear. We discuss recent findings regarding the molecular mechanisms by which environmental toxicants induce testicular pathology via Fas/FasL signaling. These findings suggest that Fas/FasL signaling is employed to impact the sensitivity (a response to external factors) of germ cells, disrupt steroidogenic hormone and cytokine metabolism mediated by Sertoli cells, and elicit the activation of NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) in Leydig cell apoptosis. Consequently, degeneration of testicular somatic (Sertoli and Leydig) and spermatogenic cells, leads to decreased numbers of mature sperm and subsequently translates into infertility issues. Collectively, these findings illustrate that it is beneficial to develop potential targets for a new generation of new pharmaceutical therapies that would alleviate testicular dysfunctions.

DNA damage-induced apoptosis suppressor (DDIAS) has an anti-apoptotic function during DNA damage in lung cancer. However, the anti-apoptotic mechanism of DDIAS in cancer cells under other conditions has not been reported. We report here that DDIAS protects cancer cells from tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis by two distinct mechanisms in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. DDIAS depletion sensitized NSCLC and HCC cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, an effect that was abrogated by pharmacological or genetic inhibition of caspase-8 and was independent of caspase-9, p53, or mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. Interestingly, we found that the N terminus of DDIAS interacted with the death effector domain of Fas-associated protein death domain (FADD) and prevented its recruitment to the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), thereby blocking caspase-8 activation. DDIAS knockdown also suppressed epidermal growth factor-induced phosphorylation of p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) 2 and stabilized caspase-8 by preventing its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. This effect was abolished by RSK2 overexpression. Taken together, DDIAS has dual functions in inhibiting DISC formation as well as in destabilizing caspase-8, thereby suppressing TRAIL-mediated apoptosis of cancer cells. Thus, we suggest that DDIAS can serve as an effective therapeutic target in the treatment of NSCLC and HCC.
Parkin encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and mutations affecting its catalytic potential are implicated in autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease (PD). The M458L mutation of parkin and its enzymatic effects require characterization. Therefore, we examined the enzymatic activity of Parkin with M458L mutation. We show that the M458L mutant retains its autoubiquitination potential in vitro but not in cells. Fas-associated factor 1 and p38 (substrates of Parkin) are able to bind to the M458L mutant in cells; however, these Parkin substrates are not ubiquitinated and degraded in M458L mutant-transfected cells. Moreover, M458L mutant fails to protect the mitochondria against hydrogen peroxide, leading to cell death. Considering the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in PD pathogenesis, our results imply a causative role for the M458L mutation in neurodegeneration.
In mammalian cells, signaling pathways triggered by TNF can be switched from NF-Œ∫B activation to apoptosis and/or necroptosis. The in vivo mechanisms underlying the mutual regulation of these three signaling pathways are poorly understood. In this article, we report that the embryonic lethality of RelA-deficient mice is partially prevented by the deletion of Rip3 or Mlkl, but it is fully rescued by the combined ablation of Fadd and Rip3 or Mlkl or by blocking RIP1 kinase activity (RIP1K45A). RelA-/-Fadd-/-Rip3-/- triple-knockout (TKO) and RelA-/-Rip1K45A/K45A mice displayed bacterial pneumonia leading to death ‚àº2 wk after birth. Moreover, RelA-/-Rip1K45A/K45A mice, but not TKO mice, developed severe inflammation associated with inflammatory skin lesion. Antibiotic treatment improved bacterial pneumonia, extended the lifespan of TKO and RelA-/-Rip1K45A/K45A mice, and alleviated skin inflammation in RelA-/-Rip1K45A/K45A mice. These results show the mechanisms underlying the in vivo mutual regulation between NF-Œ∫B activation and the cell death pathway and provide new insights into this interplay in embryonic development and host immune homeostasis.
Plants have been a major source of inspiration in developing novel drug compounds in the treatment of various diseases that afflict human beings worldwide. Ruta angustifolia L. Pers known locally as Garuda has been conventionally used for various medicinal purposes such as in the treatment of cancer.
A dihydrofuranocoumarin named chalepin, which was isolated from the chloroform extract of the plant, was tested on its ability to inhibit molecular pathways of human lung carcinoma (A549) cells.
Cell cycle analysis and caspase 8 activation were conducted using a flow cytometer, and protein expressions in molecular pathways were determined using Western blot technique.
Cell cycle analysis showed that cell cycle was arrested at the S phase. Further studies using Western blotting technique showed that cell cycle-related proteins such as cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and inhibitors of CDKs correspond to a cell cycle arrest at the S phase. Chalepin also showed inhibition in the expression of inhibitors of apoptosis proteins. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-Œ∫B) pathway, signal transducer and activation of transcription 3 (STAT-3), cyclooxygenase-2, and c-myc were also downregulated upon treatment with chalepin. Chalepin was found to induce extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Death receptors 4 and 5 showed a dramatic upregulation at 24 h. Analysis of activation of caspase 8 with the flow cytometer showed an increase in activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Activation of caspase 8 induced cleavage of BH3-interacting domain death agonist, which initiated a mitochondrial-dependent or -independent apoptosis.
Chalepin causes S phase cell cycle arrest, NF-Œ∫B pathway inhibition, and STAT-3 inhibition, induces extrinsic apoptotic pathway, and could be an excellent chemotherapeutic agent.
This study reports the capacity of an isolated bioactive compound known as chalepin to suppress the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells pathway, signal transducer and activation of transcription 3, and extrinsic apoptotic pathway and also its ability to arrest cell cycle in S phase. This compound was from the leaves of Ruta angustifolia L. Pers. It provides new insight on the ability of this plant in suppressing certain cancers, especially the nonsmall cell lung carcinoma according to this study.

Aluminum (Al) is known to induce apoptosis of osteoblasts (OBs). However, the mechanism is not yet established. To investigate the apoptotic mechanism of OBs induced by aluminum trichloride (AlCl3), the primary OBs from the craniums of fetal Wistar rats were exposed to 0¬†mg/mL (control group, CG), 0.06¬†mg/mL (low-dose group, LG), 0.12¬†mg/mL (mid-dose group, MG), and 0.24¬†mg/mL (high-dose group, HG) AlCl3 for 24¬†h, respectively. We observed that AlCl3 induced OB apoptosis with the appearance of apoptotic morphology and increase of apoptosis rate. Additionally, AlCl3 treatment activated mitochondrial-mediated signaling pathway, accompanied by mitochondrial membrane potential (ŒîŒ®m) depolarization, release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm, as well as survival signal-related factor caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation. AlCl3 exposure also activated Fas/Fas ligand signaling pathway, presented as Fas, Fas ligand, and Fas-associated death domain expression enhancement and caspase-8 activation, as well as the hydrolysis of Bid to truncated Bid, suggesting that the Fas-mediated signaling pathway might aggravate mitochondria-mediated OB apoptosis through hydrolyzing Bid. Furthermore, AlCl3 exposure inhibited Bcl-2 protein expression and increased the expressions of Bax, Bak, and Bim in varying degrees. These results indicated that AlCl3 exposure induced OB apoptosis through activating Fas- and mitochondria-mediated signaling pathway and disrupted B-cell lymphoma-2 family proteins.
Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-induced ligand (TRAIL) is reported as a promising anti-cancer therapeutic agent. Nevertheless, a variety of cancer cells, including human malignant glioma cells, are resistant to TRAIL treatment, indicating that it is necessary to find effective strategies to overcome the TRAIL resistance. Linarin (LIN), a natural flavonoid compound in Flos Chrysanthemi Indici (FCI), has been exhibited to exert various pharmacological activities, including anti-cancer. Here in our study, we found that non-cytotoxic doses of LIN (5ŒºM) dramatically potentiated TRAIL (80ng/ml)-induced cytotoxicity (52.36¬±1.58%) and apoptosis (68.50¬±1.23%) using 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and flow cytometry assays, respectively, in human glioma cells of U87MG. Apoptosis was evidenced by enhanced cleavage of Caspase-8/-9/-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and reduced anti-apoptotic proteins, including B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), mantle cell lymphoma (Mcl)-1, and Survivin. Moreover, both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways were included in apoptosis induced by LIN and TRAIL co-treatment, along with high release of Cyto-c into cytoplasm and enhancement of fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD), death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), death receptor 4 (DR) 4 and DR5, respectively. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, up to 39.86¬±2.32%, was also highly triggered by TRAIL and LIN combinational treatment, which was accompanied with high phosphorylation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK). In vivo, TRAIL and LIN double treatment significantly reduced the tumor growth using xenograft tumor model through inducing apoptosis. We demonstrated that combining LIN with TRAIL treatments might be effective against TRAIL-resistant glioma cells through inducing apoptosis regulated by ROS generation.
Concomitant hepatocyte apoptosis and regeneration is a hallmark of chronic liver diseases (CLDs) predisposing to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we mechanistically link caspase-8-dependent apoptosis to HCC development via proliferation- and replication-associated DNA damage. Proliferation-associated replication stress, DNA damage, and genetic instability are detectable in CLDs before any neoplastic changes occur. Accumulated levels of hepatocyte apoptosis determine and predict subsequent hepatocarcinogenesis. Proliferation-associated DNA damage is sensed by a complex comprising caspase-8, FADD, c-FLIP, and a kinase-dependent function of RIPK1. This platform requires a non-apoptotic function¬†of caspase-8, but no caspase-3 or caspase-8 cleavage. It may represent a DNA damage-sensing mechanism in hepatocytes that can act via JNK and subsequent phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AX.
A saturated analog of the cytochrome P450-mediated œâ-3-17,18-epoxide of œâ-3-eicosapentaenoic acid (C20E) activated apoptosis in human triple-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. This study evaluated the apoptotic mechanism of C20E. Increased cytosolic cytochrome c expression and altered expression of pro- and antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma-2 proteins indicated activation of the mitochondrial pathway. Caspase-3 activation by C20E was prevented by pharmacological inhibition and silencing of the JNK and p38 MAP kinases (MAPK), upstream MAPK kinases MKK4 and MKK7, and the upstream MAPK kinase kinase apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1). Silencing of the death receptor TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), but not Fas, DR4, or DR5, and the adapters TRADD and TNF receptor-associated factor 2, but not Fas-associated death domain, prevented C20E-mediated apoptosis. B-cell lymphoma-2 homology 3-interacting domain death agonist (Bid) cleavage by JNK/p38 MAPK linked the extrinsic and mitochondrial pathways of apoptosis. In further studies, an antibody against the extracellular domain of TNFR1 prevented apoptosis by TNF-Œ± but not C20E. These findings suggest that C20E acts intracellularly at TNFR1 to activate ASK1-MKK4/7-JNK/p38 MAPK signaling and to promote Bid-dependent mitochondrial disruption and apoptosis. In in vivo studies, tumors isolated from C20E-treated nu/nu mice carrying MDA-MB-231 xenografts showed increased TUNEL staining and decreased Ki67 staining, reflecting increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation, respectively. œâ-3-Epoxy fatty acids like C20E could be incorporated into treatments for triple-negative breast cancers.-Dyari, H. R. E., Rawling, T., Chen, Y., Sudarmana, W., Bourget, K., Dwyer, J. M., Allison, S. E., Murray, M. A novel synthetic analogue of œâ-3 17,18-epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid activates TNF receptor-1/ASK1/JNK signaling to promote apoptosis in human breast cancer cells.
This study was designed to explore the protective effect of D4F, an apolipoprotein A-I mimetic peptide, on nuclear factor-Œ∫B (NF-Œ∫B)-dependent Fas/Fas ligand (FasL) pathway-mediated apoptosis in macrophages induced by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL). Our results showed that ox-LDL induced apoptosis, NF-Œ∫B P65 nuclear translocation and the upregulation of Fas/FasL pathway-related proteins, including Fas, FasL, Fas-associated death domain proteins (FADD), caspase-8 and caspase-3 in RAW264.7 macrophages, whereas silencing of Fas blocked ox-LDL-induced macrophage apoptosis. Furthermore, silencing of P65 attenuated macrophage apoptosis and the upregulation of Fas caused by ox-LDL, whereas P65 expression was not significantly affected by treatment with Fas siRNA. D4F attenuated the reduction of cell viability and the increase in lactate dehydrogenase leakage and apoptosis. Additionally, D4F inhibited ox-LDL-induced P65 nuclear translocation and upregulation of Fas/FasL pathway-related proteins in RAW264.7 cells and in atherosclerotic lesions of apoE-/- mice. However, Jo2, a Fas-activating monoclonal antibody, reversed the inhibitory effect of D4F on ox-LDL-induced cell apoptosis and upregulation of Fas, FasL and FADD. These data indicate that NF-Œ∫B mediates Fas/FasL pathway activation and apoptosis in macrophages induced by ox-LDL and that D4F protects macrophages from ox-LDL-induced apoptosis by suppressing the activation of NF-Œ∫B and the Fas/FasL pathway.
Necroptosis is a regulated form of cell death involved in several disease models including in particular liver diseases. Receptor-interacting protein kinases, RIPK1 and RIPK3, are the main serine/threonine kinases driving this cell death pathway. We screened a noncommercial, kinase-focused chemical library which allowed us to identify Sibiriline as a new inhibitor of necroptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD)-deficient Jurkat cells. Moreover, Sib inhibits necroptotic cell death induced by various death ligands in human or mouse cells while not protecting from caspase-dependent apoptosis. By using competition binding assay and recombinant kinase assays, we demonstrated that Sib is a rather specific competitive RIPK1 inhibitor. Molecular docking analysis shows that Sib is trapped closed to human RIPK1 adenosine triphosphate-binding site in a relatively hydrophobic pocket locking RIPK1 in an inactive conformation. In agreement with its RIPK1 inhibitory property, Sib inhibits both TNF-induced RIPK1-dependent necroptosis and RIPK1-dependent apoptosis. Finally, Sib protects mice from concanavalin A-induced hepatitis. These results reveal the small-molecule Sib as a new RIPK1 inhibitor potentially of interest for the treatment of immune-dependent hepatitis.
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), a member of the TNF superfamily, has garnered interest as it is relatively non-toxic to normal cells, but selectively induces apoptotic cell death in multiple types of transformed or malignant cells. Bufalin is the major digoxin-like immunoreactive component of Sum Su, which is obtained from the skin and parotid venom gland of the toad. Bufalin is known to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells. The present study investigated whether bufalin promoted TRAIL-induced apoptotic cell death. In the present study, a combined treatment using bufalin and TRAIL significantly increased TRAIL-mediated inhibition of cell viability and increased apoptosis in T24 human bladder cancer cells. The apoptotic effects were associated with the upregulation of death receptor proteins and the downregulation of cellular Fas-associated death domain-like interleukin-1Œ≤-converting enzyme inhibitory protein and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein. Furthermore, the data revealed that bufalin and TRAIL activated caspase-3, -8 and -9 and subsequently increased the degradation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. Taken altogether, the nontoxic doses of bufalin and TRAIL sensitized T24 cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Therefore, bufalin may provide an effective therapeutic strategy for the safe treatment of human bladder cancers that are resistant to TRAIL.
Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is fundamentally treatable through surgery, although CSDH recurs in some cases. We have observed several cases of spontaneous resolution of CSDH outer membranes, including in trabecular CSDH, after trepanation surgery. In this study, we examined the expression of molecules involved in caspase signaling in CSDH outer membranes. Eight patients whose outer membranes were obtained successfully during trepanation surgery were included in this study. The expression of Fas; Fas-associated death domain (FADD); tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1-associated death domain (TRADD); receptor-interacting protein (RIP); caspases 3, 7, 8, and 9; poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP); DNA fragmentation factor 45 (DFF45) and Œ≤-actin was examined by Western blot analysis. The expression levels of PARP, caspase-3, and cleaved caspase-3 were also examined by immunohistochemistry. Fas; FADD; TRADD; RIP; caspases 3, 7, 8, and 9; PARP, and DFF45 were detected in nearly all samples. Caspase-3 and PARP were localized in the endothelial cells of vessels and in fibroblasts in CSDH outer membranes. In addition, cleaved caspase-3 was detected in fibroblasts. We detected molecules of the caspase signaling pathway in CSDH outer membranes. In particular, cleaved caspase-3 was detected, which suggests that apoptosis may occur within these membranes. Thus, during the growth of CSDH outer membranes, the caspase signaling pathway may be restrained. Once the pathway is activated, gradual resolution of CSDH outer membranes may occur. Therefore, these molecules may be novel therapeutic targets for intractable CSDH.
The current study was conducted to investigate the effect of sodium fluoride (NaF) on the oxidative stress and apoptosis as well as their relationship in the mouse liver by using methods of flow cytometry, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), western blot, biochemistry and experimental pathology. 240 four-week-old ICR mice were randomly divided into 4 groups and exposed to different concentration of NaF (0 mg/kg, 12 mg/kg, 24 mg/kg and 48 mg/kg) for a period of 42 days. The results showed that NaF caused oxidative stress and apoptosis. NaF-caused oxidative stress was accompanied by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and decreasing mRNA expression levels and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) and glutathione-s-transferase (GST). NaF induced apoptosis via tumor necrosis factor recpter-1 (TNF-R1) signaling pathway, which was characterized by significantly increasing mRNA and protein expression levels of TNF-R1, Fas associated death domain (FADD), TNFR-associated death domain (TRADD), cysteine aspartate specific protease-8 (caspase-8) and cysteine aspartate specific protease-3 (caspase-3) in dose- and time-dependent manner. Oxidative stress is involved in the process of apoptotic occurrence, and can be triggered by promoting ROS production and reducing antioxidant function. NaF-caused oxidative stress and apoptosis finally impaired hepatic function, which was strongly supported by the histopathological lesions and increased serum alanine amino transferase (ALT), aspartic acid transferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activities and TBIL contents.
Pterygium is a common tumor-like ocular disease, which may be related to exposure to chronic ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Although the standard treatment for pterygium is surgical intervention, the recurrence rate of pterygium is high when no effective inhibitory drug is used after surgery. Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a polyphenol antioxidant with many biological activities, including anti-UV and anti-tumor properties. This study aimed to examine the inhibitory effects of RA on pterygium epithelial cells (PECs). Methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to examine the cell cytotoxicity of PECs after RA treatment. A fluorescent probe, DCFH-DA (2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate), was stained with PECs to measure intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Antioxidant activity assays were used to measure the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in PECs. Western blot analysis was used to determine the protein expression of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), quinone acceptor oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and apoptosis-associated proteins. RA significantly reduced the cell viability of the PECs. Treatment with RA remarkably increased the Nrf2 protein expression levels in the nucleus, HO-1 and NQO1 protein expression levels, and the activities of SOD and CAT. As a result, intracellular ROS levels in PECs were decreased. Additionally, the induction of extrinsic apoptosis on PECs by RA was associated with increasing expressions levels of Fas, Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Œ±), and caspase 8 protein. Moreover, the induction of intrinsic apoptotic cell death in PECs was confirmed through upregulation of cytochrome c, Bax, caspase 9, and caspase 3 and downregulation of Bcl-2 and pro-caspase 3. Our study demonstrated that RA could inhibit the viability of PECs through regulation of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways. Therefore, RA may have potential as a therapeutic medication for pterygium.
FAS-associated factor-1 (FAF1) is a component of the death-inducing signaling complex involved in Fas-mediated apoptosis. It regulates NF-Œ∫B activity, ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation. Here, we found that FAF1 positively regulates the type I interferon pathway. FAF1gt/gt mice, which deficient in FAF1, and FAF1 knockdown immune cells were highly susceptible to RNA virus infection and showed low levels of inflammatory cytokines and type I interferon (IFN) production. FAF1 was bound competitively to NLRX1 and positively regulated type I IFN signaling by interfering with the interaction between NLRX1 and MAVS, thereby freeing MAVS to bind RIG-I, which switched on the MAVS-RIG-I-mediated antiviral signaling cascade. These results highlight a critical role of FAF1 in antiviral responses against RNA virus infection.
Pannexin-1 (Panx1) channels mediate the efflux of ATP and AMP from cancer cells in response to induction of extrinsic apoptosis by death receptors or intrinsic apoptosis by chemotherapeutic agents. We previously described the accumulation of extracellular ATP /AMP during chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in Jurkat human leukemia cells. In this study, we compared how different signaling pathways determine extracellular nucleotide pools in control Jurkat cells versus Jurkat lines that lack the Fas-associated death domain (FADD) or receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIP1) cell death regulatory proteins. Tumor necrosis factor-Œ± induced extrinsic apoptosis in control Jurkat cells and necroptosis in FADD-deficient cells; treatment of both lines with chemotherapeutic drugs elicited similar intrinsic apoptosis. Robust extracellular ATP/AMP accumulation was observed in the FADD-deficient cells during necroptosis, but not during apoptotic activation of Panx1 channels. Accumulation of extracellular ATP/AMP was similarly absent in RIP1-deficient Jurkat cells during apoptotic responses to chemotherapeutic agents. Apoptotic activation triggered equivalent proteolytic gating of Panx1 channels in all three Jurkat cell lines. The differences in extracellular ATP/AMP accumulation correlated with cell-line-specific expression of ectonucleotidases that metabolized the released ATP/AMP. CD73 mRNA, and Œ±Œ≤-methylene-ADP-inhibitable ecto-AMPase activity were elevated in the FADD-deficient cells. In contrast, the RIP1-deficient cells were defined by increased expression of tartrate-sensitive prostatic acid phosphatase as a broadly acting ectonucleotidase. Thus, extracellular nucleotide accumulation during regulated tumor cell death involves interplay between ATP/AMP efflux pathways and different cell-autonomous ectonucleotidases. Differential expression of particular ectonucleotidases in tumor cell variants will determine whether chemotherapy-induced activation of Panx1 channels drives accumulation of immunostimulatory ATP versus immunosuppressive adenosine within the tumor microenvironment.
Cell death depends on the balance between the activities of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors. X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) plays an important role in the cytoprotective process by inhibiting the caspase cascade and regulating pro-survival signaling pathways. While searching for novel interacting partners of XIAP, we identified Fas-associated factor 1 (FAF1). Contrary to XIAP, FAF1 is a pro-apoptotic factor that also regulates several signaling pathways in which XIAP is involved. However, the functional relationship between FAF1 and XIAP is unknown. Here, we describe a new interaction between XIAP and FAF1 and describe the functional implications of their opposing roles in cell death and NF-Œ∫B signaling. Our results clearly demonstrate the interaction of XIAP with FAF1 and define the specific region of the interaction. We observed that XIAP is able to block FAF1-mediated cell death by interfering with the caspase cascade and directly interferes in NF-Œ∫B pathway inhibition by FAF1. Furthermore, we show that XIAP promotes ubiquitination of FAF1. Conversely, FAF1 does not interfere with the anti-apoptotic activity of XIAP, despite binding to the BIR domains of XIAP; however, FAF1 does attenuate XIAP-mediated NF-Œ∫B activation. Altered expression of both factors has been implicated in degenerative and cancerous processes; therefore, studying the balance between XIAP and FAF1 in these pathologies will aid in the development of novel therapies.
To investigate the relationship between 3 markers of apoptosis, that is, FADD (Fas-associated death domain-containing protein), caspase-3, and caspase-8, and incidence of coronary events (CEs) in a population-based cohort study.
In vitro experiments were performed to assess the response of the apoptotic biomarkers after Fas stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The experiments showed significantly increased releases of FADD, caspase-3, and caspase-8 after Fas stimulation. The relationship between FADD, caspase-3, and caspase-8, respectively, and incidence of CEs was studied in 4284 subjects from the population-based Malm√∂ Diet and Cancer Study. Cox' proportional hazards regression was used to examine the association between the apoptotic biomarkers and incidence of CE over a mean follow-up of 19 years. A total of 381 individuals had CE during the follow-up. High FADD at baseline was significantly associated with incident CE. In the highest compared with the lowest quartile of FADD, the risk factor adjusted hazards ratio for CE was 1.82 (95% confidence interval, 1.35-2.46; P for trend &lt;0.001). A significant association was also found between caspase-8 and CE; the hazards ratio (Q4 versus Q1) was 1.90 (95% confidence interval, 1.39-2.60; P for trend &lt;0.001) after adjustment for risk factors. No association was found between caspase-3 and CEs.
High levels of FADD and caspase-8, but not caspase-3, were associated with increased incidence of CE in subjects from the general population. The in vitro experiments support the view that these biomarkers could reflect activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.
Lung cancer is the most common type of malignancy and one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in the world. Non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) account for 85% cases of lung cancer. Sanguinarine (SNG) is a benzophenanthridine alkaloid isolated from plants of the Papaveraceae family that possess diverse biological activities. SNG exhibits antitumor effects in several cancer cells. However, the effects of SAN on NSCLC proliferation, invasion, and migration and the mechanisms remain to be clarified. We showed that SNG concentration- and time-dependently decreased the cell proliferation, viability, and induced a marked increase in cell death in A549 cells. SNG inhibited invasion and migration and induced S phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. SNG resulted in a significant increase of E-cadherin expression and a marked decrease of the expression of N-cadherin, Vimentin, Smad2/3, and Snail and the phosphorylation of Smad2. SNG increased Fas-associated factor 1 (FAF1) expression and upregulation of FAF1 inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, and migration and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in NSCLC cells. Knockdown of FAF1 suppressed SNG-induced inhibition of cell proliferation, invasion, and migration and induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in NSCLC cells. SNG also inhibited implanted tumor growth and increased FAF1 expression in tumors in vivo. Our findings highlight FAF1 as a novel therapeutic target and provide a new insight in the potential use of SNG for the inhibition of NSCLC.
The insect immune deficiency (IMD) pathway resembles the tumour necrosis factor receptor network in mammals and senses diaminopimelic-type peptidoglycans present in Gram-negative bacteria. Whether unidentified chemical moieties activate the IMD signalling cascade remains unknown. Here, we show that infection-derived lipids 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPG) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl diacylglycerol (PODAG) stimulate the IMD pathway of ticks. The tick IMD network protects against colonization by three distinct bacteria, that is the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and the rickettsial agents Anaplasma phagocytophilum and A. marginale. Cell signalling ensues in the absence of transmembrane peptidoglycan recognition proteins and the adaptor molecules Fas-associated protein with a death domain (FADD) and IMD. Conversely, biochemical interactions occur between x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and the E2 conjugating enzyme Bendless. We propose the existence of two functionally distinct IMD networks, one in insects and another in ticks.
NF-Œ∫B is crucial to regulate immune and inflammatory responses and cell survival. LUBAC generates a linear ubiquitin chain and activates NF-Œ∫B through ubiquitin ligase (E3) activity in the HOIP subunit. Here, we show that HOIP is predominantly cleaved by caspase at Asp390 upon apoptosis, and that is subjected to proteasomal degradation. We identified that FADD, as well as NEMO, is a substrate for LUBAC. Although the C-terminal fragment of HOIP retains NF-Œ∫B activity, linear ubiquitination of NEMO and FADD decreases upon apoptosis. Moreover, the N-terminal fragment of HOIP binds with deubiquitinases, such as OTULIN and CYLD-SPATA2. These results indicate that caspase-mediated cleavage of HOIP divides critical functional regions of HOIP, and that this regulates linear (de)ubiquitination of substrates upon apoptosis.
Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Œ±) exists in two forms: secretory TNF-Œ± (sTNF-Œ±) and transmembrane TNF-Œ± (tmTNF-Œ±). Although both forms of TNF-Œ± induce tumor cell apoptosis, tmTNF-Œ± is able to kill tumor cells that are resistant to sTNF-Œ±-mediated cytotoxicity, indicating their differences in signal transduction. Here, we demonstrate that internalization of TNFR1 is crucial for sTNF-Œ±- but not for tmTNF-Œ±-induced apoptosis. sTNF-Œ± induces binding of tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1-associated death domain protein (TRADD) to the death domain (DD) of TNFR1 and subsequent activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-Œ∫B), and the formation of death-inducing signaling complexes (DISCs) in the cytoplasm after internalization. In contrast, tmTNF-Œ± induces DISC formation on the membrane in a DD-independent manner. It leads to the binding of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) to a region spanning amino acids 319-337 of TNFR1 and induces phosphorylation of serine at 727 of STAT1. The phosphorylation of STAT1 promotes its binding to TRADD, and thus recruits Fas-associated protein with DD (FADD) and caspase 8 to form DISC complexes. This STAT1-dependent signaling results in apoptosis but not NF-Œ∫B activation. STAT1-deficiency in U3A cells counteracts tmTNF-Œ±-induced DISC formation and apoptosis. Conversely, reconstitution of STAT1 expression restores tmTNF-Œ±-induced apoptotic signaling in the cell line. Consistently, tmTNF-Œ± suppresses the growth of STAT1-containing HT1080 tumors, but not of STAT1-deficient U3A tumors in vivo. Our data reveal an unappreciated molecular mechanism of tmTNF-Œ±-induced apoptosis and may provide a new clue for cancer therapy.
KM-819 is a novel FAS-associated factor 1 (FAF1) inhibitor, and a neuroprotective agent, under clinical development for the treatment of Parkinson's disease as a disease-modifying drug.
This first-in-human, single and multiple ascending dose study investigated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of KM-819 in healthy volunteers. Additionally, the effect of age on safety and pharmacokinetics were assessed. The starting dose was determined considering the no observed adverse effect level based on preclinical studies, and the dose escalations in subsequent cohorts were decided based on safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic data from previous dose cohorts.
After a single dose, the KM-819 plasma exposure showed a less than dose-proportional increase across a dose range of 10-400 mg. After repeated dosing, KM-819 plasma exposure increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner across the evaluated dose range (30-400 mg once daily for 7 days). The mean elimination half-life was 1.8 to 4.8 h with the lower KM-819 doses (‚â§30 mg), which increased to around 9 h with the higher doses (100-400 mg). When administered to the elderly population, KM-819 plasma exposure increased to 102% after a 200 mg once-daily dosing for 7 days. No clear treatment-related effects on the estimated pharmacodynamic variables were observed. Single or multiple doses of KM-819 were generally well tolerated.
The data from this study can be used to guide rational drug dosing and choose therapeutic regimens in subsequent clinical studies.
Fas-associated factor 1 (FAF1) was originally isolated as a Fas-associated factor and was subsequently found to interact with numerous other proteins that are involved in various cellular events including Fas-mediated apoptosis, nuclear factor (NF)-Œ∫B, Wnt/Œ≤-catenin, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-Œ≤ signaling pathways, mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)-mediated transactivation, and ubiquitin-dependent processes. Herein, we defined two small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-interacting motifs (SIMs) within FAF1 and demonstrated to be crucial for transcriptional modulation of the MR. Our study demonstrated that the SIMs of FAF1 do not play a significant role in regulating its subcellular localization, Fas-mediated apoptosis, or NF-Œ∫B or Wnt/Œ≤-catenin pathways. Remarkably, FAF1 interacts with the sumoylated MR and represses aldosterone-activated MR transactivation in a SIM-dependent manner. Moreover, silencing of endogenous FAF1 in cells resulted in an increase in the induction of MR target genes by aldosterone, indicating that FAF1 functions as an MR co-repressor. We further provide evidence to suggest that the mechanisms of FAF1/SIM-mediated MR transrepression involve inhibition of MR N/C interactions and promotion of MR polyubiquitination and degradation. Sumoylation has been linked to impacting of repressive properties on several transcription factors and cofactors. Our findings therefore provide mechanistic insights underlying SUMO-dependent transcriptional repression of the MR.
Glioma is the most common malignant brain tumor and the patients are prone to poor prognosis. Due to limited treatments, new drug exploration has become a general trend. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the effect of the new drugs C18H17NO6 and its combination with Scutellarin on glioma cells and the underlying mechanism.
U251 and LN229 cells were administrated with C18H17NO6 and its combination with Scutellarin. The proliferation ability of glioma cells was determined by cell counting kit-8, plate clone formation assay, and EdU incorporation assay. The cell cycle and apoptosis detection were detected by flow cytometry. Moreover, TUNEL assay was also used for cell apoptosis analysis. Then, the transfer ability of cells was achieved through wound healing assay. Furthermore, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and western bolt analysis were used to detect the mRNA expression and protein expression, respectively. Lastly, immunofluorescence was for the purity identification of astrocyte.
The results showed that, with the increasing dose of C18H17NO6, the cell inhibition rate, the cells in G1 phase, and the apoptosis rate were gradually increased, but the clone number, proliferation rate, and the cells in G2 and S phases were gradually decreased in comparison with control group. However, with the increase of C18H17NO6, the transferred rate of U251 and LN229 was not significantly augmented, expect that on U251 in C18H17NO6 5 ŒºM group. In addition, Scutellarin 200 ŒºM has little effect on proliferation, with the inhibition rate 10-20% and proliferation rate except U251 in Scutellarin 200 ŒºM group similar to that in control group. Moreover, compared to control group, Scutellarin 300 ŒºM increased the U251 cells in G2 and S phases and the apoptosis rate of LN229 but decreased the LN229 cells in G2 and S phases. Besides, in Scutellarin 200 ŒºM group, the transfer ability of LN229 was inhibited, but not in U251. Furthermore, if C18H17NO6 was combined with Scutellarin 200/300ŒºM, the proliferation and transferred ability were suppressed and the apoptosis was elevated in LN229 cell in comparison with C18H17NO6 alone. Dramatically, the combined effect on U251 was the exact opposite. Importantly, there was little toxicity on astrocyte under the dose of C18H17NO6 and Scutellarin in the study. In molecular level, the mRNA and protein expression of Fas-associated factor 1 (FAF1) expression in U251 and LN229 were upregulated by C18H17NO6 and its combination with Scutellarin, especially the protein expression.
C18H17NO6 could efficiently suppress cell proliferation and induce cell apoptosis in glioma cells, and its combination with Scutellarin had a promoting effect, in which the underlying mechanism referred to the upregulation of Fas-associated factor 1.
Sun or therapy-related ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation induces different cell death modalities such as apoptosis, necrosis/necroptosis and autophagy. Understanding of mechanisms implicated in regulation and execution of cell death program is imperative for prevention and treatment of skin diseases. An essential component of death-inducing complex is Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD), involved in conduction of death signals of different death modalities. The purpose of this study was to enlighten the role of FADD in the selection of cell death mode after narrow-band UVB (NB-UVB) irradiation using specific cell death inhibitors (carbobenzoxy-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-[O-methyl]- fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk), Necrostatin-1 and 3-Methyladenine) and FADD-deficient (FADD-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and their wild type (wt) counterparts. The results imply that lack of FADD sensitized MEFs to induction of receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIPK1)-dependent apoptosis by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), but without activation of the proteins p53, Bax and Bcl-2 as well as without the enrolment of calpain-2. Autophagy was established as a contributing factor to NB-UVB-induced death execution. By contrast, wt cells triggered intrinsic apoptotic pathway that was resistant to the inhibition by zVAD-fmk and Necrostatin-1 pointing to the mechanism overcoming the cell survival. These findings support the role of FADD in prevention of autophagy-dependent apoptosis.
To observe the effect of herbal cake-partitioned moxibustion (Moxi) on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Œ±/ TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1)-associated death domain (TRADD) / Fas-associated death domain (FADD) pathway-mediated apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells in Crohn's disease (CD) rats, so as to explore its underlying mechanisms in the treatment of CD.
Forty-eight SD male rats were randomly divided into normal, model, Moxi and medication groups (nÔºù12 rats in each). The CD model was established by intra-annual perfusion of 2Ôºå4Ôºå6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) solution (TNBS‚à∂50% alcoholÔºù2‚à∂1, 3 mL/kg), once every 7 days, 4 times altogether. For rats of the Moxi group, moxibustion was given to "Tianshu" (ST25) and "Qihai" (CV6), two moxa-cones every time, once daily for 10 days. For rats of the medication group, intragastric perfusion of mesalazine solution was given twice daily for 10 days. After the treatment, the colonic epithelium tissue was sampled. The epithelial cells were purified and cultured to establish an in vitro intestinal epithelial barrier, and added with TNF-Œ± (a pro-inflammatory factor, 100 ng/mL) in the culture medium for 24 h for making an increased epithelial permeability model. The permeability of intestinal epithelial cell barrier was evaluated by detecting the fluorescence yellow transmittance of the TNF-Œ±-incubated cell medium. Western blot was used to detect the expression levels of TNFR1, TRADD, receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1), FADD and zinc finger protein A20 (A20, a ubiquitination enzyme for inhibiting activation of TRADD and RIP1) of the cultured intestinal epithelium cells. The apoptosis of the TNF-Œ±-incubated intestinal epithelial cells was detected by flow cytometry.
After modeling and compared with the normal group, the fluorescence yellow transmittance of intestinal epithelia cells, apoptosis rate, and expression levels of TNFR1, TRADD, and RIP1 proteins were significantly increased (P&lt;0.001, P&lt;0.01), and the expression of A20 was significantly decreased (P&lt;0.01) in the model group. In comparison with the model group, the fluorescence yellow transmittance of intestinal epithelial cells, the apoptosis rate and expression levels of TRADD, RIP1 and FADD were remarkably down-regulated (P&lt;0.001, P&lt;0.01), and the expression of A20 was significantly up-regulated (P&lt;0.01) in both the Moxi and medication groups.
Herbal cake-partitioned moxibustion may down-regulate the permeability of intestinal epithelial barrier and the apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells by way of suppressing TNF-Œ±-mediated cellular apoptosis pathway of intestinal epithelium in CD rats.
The p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), a member of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, involves in neuronal apoptosis after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). It has been previously demonstrated that phosphorylation of p35 is a crucial factor for fighting against the proapoptotic p25/CDK5 signaling in neuronal apoptosis. Then, in ICH models of rats and primary cortical neurons, we found that the expressions of p75NTR, p-histone H1 (the kinase activity of CDK5), p25, Fas-associated phosphatase-1 (FAP-1), and phosphorylated myocyte enhancer factor 2D (p-MEF2D) were enhanced after ICH, whereas the expression of p35-Thr(138) was attenuated. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis indicated several interactions as follows: p35/p25 and CKD5, p75NTR and p35, as well as p75NTR and FAP-1. After p75NTR or FAP-1 depletion with double-stranded RNA interference in PC12 cells, the levels of p25 and p-histone H1 were attenuated, whereas p35-Thr(138) was elevated. Considering p75NTR has no effect of dephosphorylation, our results suggested that p75NTR might promote the dephosphorylation of p35-Thr(138) via interaction with FAP-1, and the p75NTR/p35 complex upregulated p25/CDK5 signaling to facilitate the neuronal apoptosis following ICH. So, in the study, we aimed to provide a theoretical and experimental basis that p75NTR could be regulated to reduce neuronal apoptosis following ICH for potential clinical treatment.
TRADD is an adaptor for TNFR1-induced apoptosis and NFŒ∫B activation. However, TRADD-deficient mice undergo normal development and contain normal lymphoid populations, which contrasts with an embryonic defect in mice lacking FADD, the shared adaptor mediating apoptosis. Recent studies indicate FADD suppresses embryonic necroptosis mediated by RIPK1. TRADD was suggested to also mediate necroptosis. Here we report that targeting TRADD fails to rescue Fadd-/- embryos from necroptosis, and ablation of TRADD rescues Ripk1-/- mice from perinatal lethality when RIPK3-mediated necroptosis is disabled. The resulting Ripk1-/-Ripk3-/-Tradd-/- mice survive until early adulthood, but die thereafter. A single allele of Tradd is optimal for survival of Ripk1-/-Ripk3-/-Tradd+/- mice. We show that TRADD plays a more dominating role in NFŒ∫B-signaling than RIPK1. While RIPK1 protects thymocytes from TNFŒ±-induced apoptosis, TRADD promotes this process. The data demonstrate that TRADD is critical in perinatal and adult mice lacking RIPK1 and RIPK3, which has not been appreciated in prior studies.
Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is the most toxic among the mycotoxins and causes detrimental health effects on the liver of human and animals. Selenium (Se) plays an important role in protection of various animal species against numerous notorious toxic agents. The present study is designed to explore the protective effects of Se against AFB1-induced liver pathogenesis by the methods of histopathology, flow cytometry, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and biochemical analysis. A total of 312, 1-day-old healthy Cobb-500 broilers were randomly divided into four groups and fed with basal diet (control group), 0.6¬†mg/kg AFB1 (AFB1 group), 0.4¬†mg/kg Se (+ Se group), and 0.6¬†mg/kg AFB1‚Äâ+‚Äâ0.4¬†mg/kg Se (AFB1 + Se group) for 21¬†days, respectively. Our results showed that 0.4¬†mg/kg Se supplement in broiler's diets could alleviate the AFB1-induced histological lesions in the liver. The apoptosis analysis by flow cytometry showed that 0.4¬†mg/kg Se ameliorated the AFB1-induced apoptosis in the liver. Moreover, the mRNA expression levels of Fas, TNF-Œ±, FAS-associated death domain, TNF receptor-associated death domain, TNF receptor-associated factor 2, caspase 10, caspase 8, B cell lymphoma 2, IŒ∫B kinase, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, caspase 9, and caspase 3 analyzed by qRT-PCR demonstrated that 0.4¬†mg/kg Se could relieve the impact caused by AFB1 to these parameters. The biochemical analyses of activities of CAT, GSH-Px and SOD, hydroxyl ion scavenging and contents of MDA and GSH in liver cells also indicated that 0.4¬†mg/kg Se has positive effect on AFB1-induced oxidative stress in the liver. In conclusion, Se could relieve AFB1-induced apoptosis by the molecular regulation of death receptors pathway in the liver of broilers. The outcomes from the present study may lead to a better understanding of the nature of selenium's essentiality and its protective roles against AFB1.
Despite advances in HIV therapy, there is no cure, and lifelong antiretroviral treatment is required to suppress viral replication. We hypothesized that HIV maintains the survival of latently infected CD4+ T cells through increased expression of cell survival factors including XIAP, BIRC2 and BECN1. We found that DIABLO/SMAC mimetics promote the degradation of XIAP and BIRC2 in latent HIV-infected resting memory CD4+ T cells (HIV-TCM) without activating viral transcription. Also in HIV-TCM, but not in uninfected cells, the degradation of XIAP and BIRC2 leads to the induction of macroautophagy/autophagy, and the formation of a cell death complex on phagophore membranes that consist of autophagy (ATG5, ATG7 and SQSTM1) and pro-apoptotic (FADD, RIPK1, RIPK3, CASP8) proteins. This results in autophagy-dependent apoptosis of HIV-TCM while sparing uninfected cells. These findings support the potential use of DIABLO/SMAC mimetics as part of an HIV cure strategy.

Human glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive malignancy of the CNS, with less than 5% survival. Despite great efforts to find effective therapeutics, current options remain very limited. To develop a targeted cancer therapeutic, we selected RNA aptamers against platelet-derived growth factor receptor Œ± (PDGFRŒ±), which is a receptor tyrosine kinase. One RNA aptamer (PDR3) with high affinity (0.25¬†nM) showed PDGFRŒ± specificity and was internalized in U251-MG cells. Following treatment with the PDR3 aptamer, expression of the transcription factor STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) was inhibited, whereas the expression of the histone demethylase JMJD3 and the tumor suppressor p53 were upregulated. PDR3 also upregulated serine phosphorylation of p53, which subsequently mediated apoptosis through the death receptors: tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptors 1/2 (TRAIL-R1/R2), Fas-associated via death domain (FADD), and Fas. PDR3 significantly decreased cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, translocation of PDR3 into the nucleus induced hypomethylation at the promoters of cyclin D2. To assess the feasibility of targeted delivery, we conjugated PDR3 aptamer with STAT3-siRNA for a chimera. The PDR3-siSTAT3 chimera successfully inhibited the expression of target genes and showed significant inhibition of cell viability. In summary, our results show that well-tailored RNA aptamers targeting the PDGFRŒ±-STAT3 axis have the potential to act as anti-cancer therapeutics in GBM.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the combined 17Œ≤-estradiol (E2) and exercise training on cardiac pro-survival and anti-apoptotic pathways in ovariectomized rats.
Fifty-six female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into a sham-operated (Sham), a bilaterally ovariectomized (OVX), an OVX treated with E2 (OVX-E2; 10Œºg/kg/day), and an OVX with E2 and treadmill exercise training (OVX-E2-EX; 60 min/day, 5 days/week) for 10 weeks. Following 10 weeks of exercise training, rat hearts were isolated for the evaluation of Histopathological analysis, TUNEL assay, and Western blotting.
The protein levels of estrogen receptor Œ± (ERŒ±), estrogen receptor Œ≤ (ERŒ≤), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R), phospho-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p-PI3K) (estrogen receptors/IGF-1-related survival pathway) were significantly increased in either the OVX-E2 or OVX-E2-EX group when compared with the OVX group. The protein levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), B-cell lymphoma-extra-large (Bcl-xL) and phosphorylated-Bad (p-Bad) (Bcl-2 family survival pathway) were significantly increased in the OVX-E2-EX group when compared with the OVX group. Only the p-Bad was significantly increased in the OVX-E2 group when compared with the OVX group. The protein levels of truncation of Bid (t-Bid), Bcl-2-associated death promotor (Bad), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), Cytochrome c, caspases-9, and caspases-3 (mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway), as well as the protein levels of tumor necrosis factor-Œ± (TNF-Œ±), Fas ligand, Fas receptors, Fas-associated death domain (FADD), activated caspase-8 and activated caspase-3 (Fas receptor-dependent apoptotic pathway) were significantly decreased in either the OVX-E2 or OVX-E2-EX group when compared with the OVX group. Furthermore, when compared with the OVX-E2 group, the protein levels of ERŒ≤, IGF-1, IGF-1R, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were further enhanced in the OVX-E2-EX group as well as the protein levels of Cytochrome c, Fas receptors, FADD, activated caspase-8, activated caspase-9 and activated caspase-3 were further decreased in the OVX-EX-E2 group.
Combined E2 and exercise training exhibited a positive effect of protection on ovariectomy-induced cardiac apoptosis by enhancing ERŒ≤-related survival pathways, which might provide a more effective therapeutic effect on cardiac protection in bilaterally oophorectomized or menopausal women than E2 treatment only.
Wentilactone A (WA), a marine-derived compound, inhibits proliferation of NCI-H446, as demonstrated by previous research; however, the anti-SCLC mechanism underlying WA was not fully investigated. The present study aimed to investigate the anti-SCLC mechanism underlying WA in vitro and in vivo. Cell Counting Kit-8 was used to assay cell growth, flow cytometry was conducted to analyze cell apoptosis and nude mice xenografts were used to examine SCLC growth following WA treatment. Bioinformatics was used for verification of the target gene of WA. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot were used to examine aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C1 (AKR1C1) mRNA and protein levels, and AKR1C1-associated proteins prior to and following WA treatment. Cell growth, apoptosis and growth of nude mice xenografts were assayed prior to and following transfection with AKR1C1 knockdown or overexpression carriers, respectively. It was determined that AKR1C1 was a target gene of WA. Decreased AKR1C1 expression and WA treatment promoted apoptosis in SCLC via the insulin like growth factor-1 receptor/insulin receptor substrate 1/phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT/nuclear factor-erythroid 2-associated factor 2/Fas-associated death domain-like interleukin-1-converting enzyme-like inhibitory protein/Caspase-3 pathway. WA attenuated the proliferation and induced the apoptosis of SCLC cells in vitro and in vivo by targeting the AKR1C1 gene. WA may be a novel AKR1C1-targeted drug candidate for the treatment of SCLC in the future.
Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) frequently harbor genomic mutations in cell death pathways. Nearly 30% of HNSCCs overexpress Fas-Associated Death Domain (FADD), with or without BIRC2/3 genes encoding cellular Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins 1/2 (cIAP1/2), critical components of the Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) Receptor signaling pathways. ASTX660 is a novel non-peptidomimetic antagonist of cIAP1/2 and XIAP under evaluation in a clinical trial for advanced solid tumors and lymphomas. Herein, we show that ASTX660, at nanomolar concentrations, sensitized Murine Oral Cancer (MOC1) cells to TNFŒ±. Using syngeneic mouse models, ASTX660 showed additive anti-tumor activity with radiation therapy (XRT), cisplatin chemotherapy, and PD-1 blockade to significantly delay or eradicate MOC1 tumors. These combinations significantly increased CD8¬†+¬†T cells and dendritic cells, as well as T cell activity. ASTX660 stimulated cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) killing of MOC1 cells expressing ovalbumin. Early stages of CTL killing were predominantly mediated by perforin/granzyme B, whereas later stages were mediated by death ligands TNFŒ±, TRAIL, and FasL. Correspondingly, depletion of CD8¬†+¬†T cells and NK cells in vivo revealed both types of immune cells to be important components of the complete anti-tumor response enhanced by ASTX660+XRT. These findings serve to inform future studies of IAP inhibitors and support the potential for future clinical trials investigating ASTX660 with XRT and immunotherapies like PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in HNSCC.
The objective of this study was to clarify the molecular pathways involved in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-induced hepatoblastoma.
The expression of factors in different signaling pathways (H19, miR-675, miR-138, protein tyrosine kinase 2 [PTK2], fas-associated death domain [FADD], hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha [HIFIA], focal adhesion kinase [FAK], caspase-8, and caspase-3) was compared between HBV (+) and HBV (-) groups using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. Subsequently, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) assays were used to verify the expression of above proteins in HBV (+) and HBV (-) groups. Computational analysis was conducted to predict the target genes of miR-675 and miR-138, whose regulatory relationships were then clarified using luciferase assays and cell transfection studies.
The expression of H19, miR-675, PTK2, HIFIA, and FAK was increased in the HBV (+) group, while the expression of miR-138, FADD, caspase-8, and caspase-3 was decreased in the HBV (+) group. FADD and PTK2 were identified as target genes of miR-675 and miR-138, respectively. In addition, miR-675 was upregulated while miR-138 was downregulated by X protein (HBx).
In summary, the results of this study revealed the molecular pathways involved in HBV-induced hepatoblastoma. In the presence of HBV, HBX upregulated the expression of H19 through HIFIA. Consecutively, overexpressed H19 upregulated the expression of PTK2 via targeting miR-138 and downregulated the expression of FADD via targeting miR-675. Finally, increased expression of PTK2 and reduced expression of FADD both led to the inhibition of cell apoptosis, thus promoting the tumorigenesis of hepatoblastoma.
Silibinin is a flavonolignan from milk thistle with many pharmacological activities including lipid-lowering and antioxidant. Caspase 8 and Fas-associated protein with death domain-like apoptosis regulator (CFLAR) is an important target gene in regulating non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). At present, the effect of silibinin on CFLAR-JNK pathway related to NASH was unknown. Here the effect of silibinin on CFLAR-JNK pathway and its downstream target genes involved in lipid metabolism, glucose uptake, oxidative stress and inflammatory response were studied in oleic acid (OA)-treated HepG2 cells.
OA-treated HepG2 cells were employed as a in vitro model of steatosis, insulin resistance and oxidative stress. The model cells were then treated by silibinin (5, 20, 50, and 100‚ÄâŒºM) for 24‚Äâh and detected for the related indicators as follows: (1) cellular triglycerides (TG), nitric oxide (NO) and glucose uptake; (2) the mRNA levels of the sterol regulatory element binding protein-1C (SREBP-1C), patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3) and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-Œ± (PPARŒ±); (3) the protein levels of PPARŒ±, SREBP-1C, PNPLA3, CFLAR, phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (pJNK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphorylated serine-threonine protein kinase (pAKT), nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (NRF2), cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and 4A (CYP4A).
Compared to the control, OA-treatment led to a result as follows: (1) increased the intracellular levels of TG and NO; (2) up-regulated the protein expression of SREBP-1C, PNPLA3, pJNK, CYP 2E1 and CYP 4A; (3) decreased the uptake of 2-NBDG; (4) down-regulated the protein expression of CFLAR, PPARŒ±, PI3K, pAKT and NRF2. Compared to OA-treated HepG2 cells, silibinin treatment could improve the indicators as follows: (1) decreased the intracellular levels of TG and NO; (2) down-regulated the protein expression of SREBP-1C, PNPLA3, pJNK, CYP 2E1 and CYP 4A; (3) increased the uptake of 2-NBDG; (4) up-regulated the protein expression of CFLAR, PPARŒ±, PI3K, pAKT and NRF2.
Silibinin can ameliorate some metabolic alterations and induce some molecular changes by activating the CFLAR-JNK pathway and thereby regulating its downstream target genes involved in lipid metabolism (PPARŒ±, SREBP-1C and PNPLA3), glucose uptake (PI3K-AKT), oxidative stress (NRF2, CYP2E1, CYP4A) and inflammatory response(NO) in OA-treated HepG2 cells demonstrating its possible use in ameliorating various symptoms of NASH.

Aberrant cell death induced by ischemic stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of ischemic diseases. Fas-associated factor 1 (FAF1) has been identified as a death-promoting protein. This study demonstrates that FAF1 functions in death signaling triggered by ischemic insult.
The expression changes of FAF1 and phophorylated JNK1 were detected by Western blotting. Immunoprecipitation was employed to investigate protein-protein interaction. We determined the cell death using flow cytometry and lactate dehydrogenase release measurement. To validate the death-promoting role of FAF1 in the retina, we generated conditional retinal FAF1 knockout mice. We used hematoxylin and eosin staining to detect retinal cell death in retinal ganglion cell layer.
FAF1 was found to function upstream of c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1), followed by mitochondrial dysregulation and necrotic cell death processes upon ischemic insult. We investigated whether FAF1 is involved in the pathogenesis of ischemic diseases using a retinal ischemia model. Indeed, FAF1 potentiated necrosis through JNK1 activation upon ischemic stress in retinal cells demonstrating retinal ganglion-like character. Conditional FAF1 depletion attenuated JNK1 activation in the retinas of Dkk3-Cre;Faf1flox/flox mice and ameliorated death of retinal cells due to elevated intraocular pressure (IOP).
Our results show that FAF1 plays a key role in ischemic retinal damage and may be implicated in the pathogenesis of retinal ischemic disease.
FAS-associated protein with death domain (FADD) is the pivotal adaptor protein, which transmits apoptotic signals mediated by the death receptors. Here we report that high FADD protein level predicts poor prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and its protein level is mainly regulated by the 26S proteasome. We also found that ubiquitin ligase SPOP (speckle-type POZ protein) binds to FADD and mediates its degradation, which can be blocked by MG132 treatment. Notably, SPOP inhibits NF-Œ∫B (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) activity and its target genes expression via FADD. These results reveal the function of SPOP-FADDNFŒ∫B axis in NSCLC cells, which is associated with prognosis of NSCLC patients.
Whether and how garlic-derived S-allylmercaptocysteine (SAMC) inhibits hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is largely unknown. In the current study, the role of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)-related protein 6 (LRP6) in HCC progression and the anti-HCC mechanism of SAMC was examined in clinical sample, cell model and xenograft/orthotopic mouse models. We demonstrated that SAMC inhibited cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, while induced apoptosis of human HCC cells without influencing normal hepatocytes. SAMC directly interacted with Wnt-pathway co-receptor LRP6 on the cell membrane. LRP6 was frequently over-expressed in the tumor tissue of human HCC patients (66.7% of 48 patients) and its over-expression only correlated with the over-expression of Œ≤-catenin, but not with age, gender, tumor size, stage and metastasis. Deficiency or over-expression of LRP6 in hepatoma cells could partly mimic or counteract the anti-tumor properties of SAMC, respectively. In vivo administration of SAMC significantly suppressed the growth of Huh-7 xenograft/orthotopic HCC tumor without causing undesirable side effects. In addition, stable down-regulation of LRP6 in Huh-7 facilitated the anti-HCC effects of SAMC. In conclusion, LRP6 can be a potential therapeutic target of HCC. SAMC is a promising specific anti-tumor agent for treating HCC subtypes with Wnt activation at the hepatoma cell surface.
Fas associated phosphatase 1 (Fap1) is a ubiquitously expressed protein tyrosine phosphatase. Fap1 substrates include Fas and Gsk3Œ≤, suggesting a role in regulating cell survival. Consistent with this, increased Fap1 expression is associated with resistance to Fas or platinum induced apoptosis in some human colon cancer tumors or cell lines. In the current studies, we found that Fap1 expression was significantly greater in CD133+ colon cancer stem cells compared to CD133- tumor cells. PTPN13 promoter activity (encoding Fap1) was repressed by interferon regulatory factor 2 (irf2), and expression of Fap1 and Irf2 were inversely correlated in CD133+ or CD133- colon cancer cells. We determined that CD133+ cells were relatively resistant to Fas or oxaliplatin induced apoptosis, but this was reversed by Fap1-knockdown or a Fap1-blocking tripeptide (SLV). In a murine xenograft model of colon cancer, we found treatment with SLV peptide significantly decreased tumor growth and relative abundance of CD133+CD44+ cells; associated with increased phosphorylation of Fap1 substrates. SLV peptide also enhanced inhibitory effects of oxaliplatin on tumor growth and Fap1 substrate phosphorylation in this model. Our studies suggest that therapeutically targeting Fap1 may decrease persistence of colon cancer stem cells during treatment with platinum chemotherapy by activating Fap1 substrates. In a murine model of chronic myeloid leukemia, we previously determined that inhibition of Fap1 decreased persistence of leukemia stem cells during tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment. Therefore, Fap1 may be a tissue agnostic target to increase apoptosis in malignant stem cells.
This study investigated the effects of progesterone (PROG) on neonatal hypoxic/ischemic (NHI) brain injury, the differences in effects between genders, and the underlying mechanisms. NHI brain injury was established in both male and female neonatal mice induced by occlusion of the left common carotid artery followed by hypoxia. The mice were treated with PROG or vehicle. Fluoro-Jade B staining (F-JB), long term behavior testing, and brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) were applied to evaluate neuronal death, neurological function, and brain damage. The underlying molecular mechanisms were also investigated by Western blots. The results showed that, in the male mice, administration of PROG significantly reduced neuronal death, improved the learning and memory function impaired by cerebral HI, decreased infarct size, and maintained the thickness of the cortex after cerebral HI. PROG treatment, however, did not show significant neuroprotective effects on female mice subjected to HI. In addition, the data demonstrated a gender difference in the expression of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), TNF receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6), Fas associated protein with death domain (FADD), and TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-Œ≤ (TRIF) between males and females. Our results indicated that treatment with PROG had beneficial effects on NHI injured brain in acute stage and improved the long term cognitive function impaired by cerebral HI in male mice. In addition, the activation of TNF and TRIF mediated signaling in response to cerebral HI and the treatment of PROG varied between genders, which highly suggested that gender differences should be emphasized in evaluating neonatal HI brain injury and PROG effects, as well as the underlying mechanisms.
Chondrocyte apoptosis is the most common pathological feature in cartilage in osteoarthritis (OA). Transient receptor potential channel vanilloid 5 (TRPV5) is important in regulating calcium ion (Ca2+) influx. Accumulating evidences suggest that Ca2+ is a major intracellular second messenger that can trigger cell apoptosis. Therefore, we investigate the potential role of TRPV5 in mediating Ca2+ influx to promote chondrocyte apoptosis in OA.
The monoiodoacetic acid (MIA)-induced rat OA model was assessed by macroscopic and radiographic analyses. Calmodulin protein immunolocalization was detected by immunohistochemistry. The mRNA and protein level of TRPV5, calmodulin and cleaved caspase-8 in articular cartilage were assessed by real time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Primary chondrocytes were isolated and cultured in vitro. TRPV5 small interfering RNA was used to silence TRPV5 in chondrocytes. Then, calmodulin and cleaved caspase-8 were immunolocalized by immunofluorescence in chondrocyte. Fluo-4AM staining was used to assess intracellular Ca2+ to reflect TRPV5 function of mediation Ca2+ influx. Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanatepropidium iodide flow cytometric analysis was performed to determine chondrocytes apoptosis. Western blotting techniques were used to measure the apoptosis-related proteins in chondrocyte level.
Here, we reported TRPV5 was up-regulated in MIA-induced OA articular cartilage. Ruthenium red (a TRPV5 inhibitor) can relieve progression of joint destruction in vivo which promoted us to demonstrate the effect of TRPV5 in OA. We found that TRPV5 had a specific role in mediating extracellular Ca2+ influx leading to chondrocytes apoptosis in vitro. The apoptotic effect was inhibited even reversed by silencing TRPV5. Furthermore, we found that the increase Ca2+ influx triggered apoptosis by up-regulating the protein of death-associated protein, FAS-associated death domain, cleaved caspase-8, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-6, and cleaved caspase-7, and the up-regulated proteins were abolished by silencing TRPV5 or 1, 2-bis-(o-Aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, tetraacetoxymethyl ester (a Ca2+ chelating agent).
The up-regulated TRPV5 could used be as an initiating factor that induces extrinsic chondrocyte apoptosis via the mediation of Ca2+ influx. These findings suggested TRPV5 could be an intriguing mediator for drug target in OA.
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are capable of secreting exosomes, extracellular vesicles, and cytokines to regulate cell and tissue homeostasis. However, it is unknown whether MSCs use a specific exocytotic fusion mechanism to secrete exosomes and cytokines. We show that Fas binds with Fas-associated phosphatase-1 (Fap-1) and caveolin-1 (Cav-1) to activate a common soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) attachment protein receptor (SNARE)-mediated membrane fusion mechanism to release small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) in MSCs. Moreover, we reveal that MSCs produce and secrete interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) associated with sEVs to maintain rapid wound healing in the gingiva via the Fas/Fap-1/Cav-1 cascade. Tumor necrosis factor-Œ± (TNF-Œ±) serves as an activator to up-regulate Fas and Fap-1 expression via the nuclear factor Œ∫B pathway to promote IL-1RA release. This study identifies a previously unknown Fas/Fap-1/Cav-1 axis that regulates SNARE-mediated sEV and IL-1RA secretion in stem cells, which contributes to accelerated wound healing.
Recent preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that hyperuricemia (HU) is an independent risk factor for metabolic syndrome, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease. Receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3) is an important contributor in inducing programmed necrosis, representing a newly identified mechanism of cell death combining features of both apoptosis and necrosis. In our study, RIP3 was strongly expressed in mice with hyperuricemia. RIP3 deficiency attenuated hyperuricemia in mice, evidenced by reduced serum uric acid and creatinine and enhanced urinary uric acid and creatinine, as well as the improved histological alterations in renal sections. Additionally, RIP3-deletion reduced malondialdehyde (MDA), H2O2 and O2-, whereas enhanced superoxide dismutase (SOD), GSH and GSH-Px levels in potassium oxonate-induced mice. Potassium oxonate-treated mice showed significantly high mRNA levels of ATP-binding cassette, subfamily G, membrane 2 (ABCG2), organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1), OAT3, organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) and organic cation/carnitine transporter 1 (OCTN1) in renal tissue samples, which were reversed by RIP3-deficiency. Meanwhile, down-regulation of circulating and kidney pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1Œ≤, TNF-Œ± and IL-6) were observed in RIP3-knockout mice with hyperuricemia, associated with inactivation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), inhibitor of NF-Œ∫B alpha (IŒ∫BŒ±) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-Œ∫B). NLR family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome was also suppressed by RIP3 knockout in potassium oxonate-treated mice. Importantly, RIP3-knockout mice exhibited the decrease of FAS-associated protein with a death domain (FADD), cleaved Caspase-8/-3 and Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in renal samples, along with TUNEL reduction in mice with hyperuricemia. Similar results were observed in uric acid-incubated cells with RIP3 knockdown. Thus, we suggested that RIP3 played an important role in mice with hyperuricemia, which might be a novel signal pathway targeting for therapeutic strategies in future.
The goal of the present study was to investigate anticancer effect of amentoflavone on glioblastoma cells in vitro. Our results demonstrated that amentoflavone not only significantly reduced cell viability, nuclear factor-ƒ∏appa B (NF-ƒ∏B) activation, and protein expression of cellular Fas-associated protein with death domain-like interleukin 1 beta-converting enzyme inhibitory protein (C-FLIP) and myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1), but significantly triggered cell accumulation at the sub-G1 phase, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and expression of active caspase-3 and -8. In order to verify the effect of NF-ƒ∏B inhibitor on expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, we performed western blotting. We found that the of NF-ƒ∏B inhibitor or amentoflavone markedly diminished protein levels of MCL1 and C-FLIP. Taken all together, our findings show that amentoflavone induces intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis and inhibits NF-ƒ∏B-modulated anti-apoptotic signaling in U-87 MG cells in vitro.
UBX (ubiquitin regulatory X) domain-containing proteins act as cofactors for CDC-48/p97. CDC-48/p97 is essential for various cellular processes including retro-translocation in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation, homotypic membrane fusion, nuclear envelope assembly, degradation of ubiquitylated proteins, and cell cycle progression. CDC-48/p97-dependent processes are determined by differential binding of cofactors including UBX proteins, but the cellular functions of UBX proteins have not yet been elucidated, especially in multicellular organisms. Therefore, we investigated the functions of UBX family members using Caenorhabditis elegans, which expresses six UBX proteins, UBXN-1 to UBXN-6. All six UBXN proteins directly interacted with CDC-48.1 and CDC-48.2, and simultaneous knockdown of the expression of three genes, ubxn-1, ubxn-2 and ubxn-3, induced embryonic lethal and sterile phenotypes, but knockdown of either one or two did not. The sterile worms had a feminized germ-line phenotype, producing oocytes but no sperm. UBXN-1, UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 colocalized with CDC-48 in spermatocytes but not mature sperm. TRA-1A, which is a key factor in the sex determination pathway and inhibits spermatogenesis, accumulated in worms in which UBXN-1, UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 had been simultaneously knocked down. Taken together, these results suggest that UBXN-1, UBXN-2 and UBXN-3 are redundant cofactors for CDC-48/p97 and control spermatogenesis via the degradation of TRA-1A.
Ubiquitination is a versatile tool of eukaryotic cells for controlling the stability, function and subcellular localization of proteins. The variety of cellular processes regulated by ubiquitination demands high substrate specificity of the ubiquitination machinery as well as the existence of diverse downstream effector proteins interacting with ubiquitinated substrates. Most of these cellular effectors are characterized by a modular composition of ubiquitin-binding motifs and further domains mediating specific functions. Here, I give an overview of important ubiquitin-related protein motifs, including the UBA, UIM, UBD and UBX domains, and propose a model for the role of subclasses of UBA-domain-containing proteins in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis.
A comprehensive quantitative analysis of changes in protein phosphorylation preceding or accompanying transcriptional activation by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) in 5L rat hepatoma cells was performed using the SILAC approach. Following exposure of the cells to DMSO or 1 nM TCDD for 0.5 to 2 h, 5648 phosphorylated peptides corresponding to 2156 phosphoproteins were identified. Eight peptides exhibited a statistically significantly altered phosphorylation because of TCDD exposure and 22 showed a regulation factor of ‚â• 1.5 in one of the experiments per time point. The vast majority of the TCCD-induced phosphorylation changes had not been reported before. The transcription factor ARNT, the obligate partner for gene activation by the TCDD-bound Ah receptor, exhibited an up-regulation of its Ser77 phosphorylation, a modification known to control the differential binding of ARNT homodimers and heterodimers to different enhancers suggesting that this phosphorylation represents a novel mechanism contributing to the alteration of gene expression by TCDD. Other proteins with altered phosphorylation included, among others, various transcriptional coregulators previously unknown to participate in TCDD-induced gene activation, regulators of small GTPases of the Ras superfamily, UBX domain-containing proteins and the oncogenic protein LYRIC. The results open up new directions for research on the molecular mechanisms of dioxin action and toxicity.
Down's syndrome (DS) is a type of chromosome disease. The present study aimed to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of DS. GSE5390 microarray data downloaded from the gene expression omnibus database was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in DS. Pathway enrichment analysis of the DEGs was performed, followed by co-expression network construction. Significant differential modules were mined by mutual information, followed by functional analysis. The accuracy of sample classification for the significant differential modules of DEGs was evaluated by leave-one-out cross-validation. A total of 997 DEGs, including 638 upregulated and 359 downregulated genes, were identified. Upregulated DEGs were enriched in 15 pathways, such as cell adhesion molecules, whereas downregulated DEGs were enriched in maturity onset diabetes of the young. Three significant differential modules with the highest discriminative scores (mutual information&gt;0.35) were selected from a co-expression network. The classification accuracy of GSE16677 expression profile samples was 54.55% and 72.73% when characterized by 12 DEGs and 3 significant differential modules, respectively. Genes in significant differential modules were significantly enriched in 5 functions, including the endoplasmic reticulum (P=0.018) and regulation of apoptosis (P=0.061). The identified DEGs, in particular the 12 DEGs in the significant differential modules, such as B-cell lymphoma 2-associated transcription factor 1, heat shock protein 90 kDa beta member 1, UBX domain-containing protein 2 and transmembrane protein 50B, may serve important roles in the pathogenesis of DS.
In previous studies it was demonstrated that sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are able to interact with one of the nuclear receptors, hepatocyte nuclear receptor (HNF)-4, and that this interaction regulates transcriptional activities of these proteins (Misawa, K., Horiba, T., Arimura, N., Hirano, Y., Inoue, J., Emoto, N., Shimano, H., Shimizu, M., and Sato, R. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 36176-36182; Yamamoto, T., Shimano, H., Nakagawa, Y., Ide, T., Yahagi, N., Matsuzaka, T., Nakakuki, M., Takahashi, A., Suzuki, H., Sone, H., Toyoshima, H., Sato, R., and Yamada, N. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 12027-12035). In an attempt to identify other nuclear receptor family members affecting the SREBP transcriptional activities, we found that the liver receptor homolog (LRH)-1 suppresses them. Several types of luciferase assays revealed that coexpression of these two proteins (LRH-1 and SREBP-1a, -1c, or -2) results in reciprocal inhibition of the transcriptional activity of each protein. It was confirmed that suppression in endogenous LRH-1 by small interference RNA stimulates the mRNA levels of certain SREBP target genes and that elevation in active SREBPs in the nucleus in response to cholesterol depletion suppresses the LRH-1 activity. In vitro/in vivo glutathione S-transferase pulldown experiments demonstrated that the basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper domain in SREBP-2 binds to the ligand-binding domain in LRH-1. Furthermore, we found that SREBP-2 interferes with the recruitment of a coactivator of LRH-1, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha, thereby leading to the inhibition of the LRH-1 transcriptional activity. These results clearly indicate that the interaction between SREBPs and LRH-1 exerts a suppressive influence on their target gene expression responsible for cholesterol and bile acid metabolism.
The liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) is an orphan nuclear receptor believed to play a key role in bile acid metabolism, cholesterol homeostasis, and intestinal cell crypt renewal. LRH-1 has recently been reported to negatively regulate the hepatic acute phase response by antagonizing, at least in part, the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein signaling pathway. Here we have shown, using adenovirus-mediated LRH-1 overexpression and gene-silencing experiments, that the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) gene is a novel LRH-1 target gene in hepatic cells. Promoter mapping and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that LRH-1 regulates IL-1RA gene expression under inflammatory conditions at the transcriptional level via the binding to an LRH-1 response element. Interestingly, IL-1RA induction by an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide is significantly lower in LRH-1 heterozygous compared with wild-type mice, demonstrating the contribution of LRH-1 in IL-1RA gene regulation. Finally, RNA interference experiments indicate that LRH-1 blocks the hepatic acute phase response by, at least in part, inducing IL-1RA expression. Taken together, these results lead to the identification of IL-1RA as a novel LRH-1 target gene and demonstrate the existence of multiple mechanisms contributing to the overall anti-inflammatory properties of LRH-1 in hepatic cells.
The nuclear receptor LRH-1 (NR5A2) functions to regulate expression of a number of genes associated with bile acid homeostasis and other liver functions, but mechanisms that modulate its activity remain unclear. We have found that mitogenic stimuli, including treatment with phorbol myristate (PMA), increase LRH-1 transactivation. This response maps to the hinge and ligand binding domains of LRH-1 and is blocked by the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126. LRH-1 is a phosphoprotein and hinge domain serine residues at 238 and 243 are required for effective phosphorylation, both in vitro and in cells. Preventing phosphorylation of these residues by mutating both to alanine decreases PMA-dependent LRH-1 transactivation and mimicking phosphorylation by mutation to positively charged aspartate residues increases basal transactivation. Although serine phosphorylation of the hinge of SF-1 (NR5A1), the closest relative of LRH-1, confers a similar response, the specific targets differ in the two closely related orphan receptors. These results define a novel pathway for the modulation of LRH-1 transactivation and identify specific LRH-1 residues as downstream targets of mitogenic stimuli. This pathway may contribute to recently described proliferative functions of LRH-1.
Cholesterol homeostasis in mammals involves pathways for biosynthesis, cellular uptake, and hepatic conversion to bile acids. Key genes for all three pathways are regulated by negative feedback control. Uptake and biosynthesis are directly regulated by cholesterol through its inhibition of the proteolytic activation of the sterol regulatory element binding proteins. The conversion of cholesterol into bile acids in the liver is regulated through the bile acid-dependent induction of the negatively acting small heterodimer partner nuclear receptor. In this report, we have shown that the small heterodimer partner also directly regulates cholesterol biosynthesis through inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase but has no effect on low density lipoprotein receptor expression. This has significant metabolic significance, as it provides both a mechanism to independently regulate cholesterol synthesis from uptake (an essential regulatory feature known to occur in vivo) and a pathway for direct regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis by bile acids. This latter feature ensures that the early phase of bile acid synthesis (pre-cholesterol) is in metabolic communication with the later stages of the pathway to properly regulate whole pathway flux. This highlights an important regulatory feature that is shared with other key branched, multienzyme pathways, such as glycolysis, where pathway outflow through pyruvate kinase is regulated by the concentration of a key early intermediate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.
The orphan nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) has been reported to play a role in bile acid biosynthesis and reverse cholesterol transport. In this study, we examined the role of LRH-1 in the regulation of the apolipoprotein AI (APOAI) gene. Using RNA interference and adenovirus-mediated overexpression, we show that LRH-1 directly regulates APOAI gene transcription. Transient transfection experiments and EMSAs revealed that LRH-1 directly regulates APOAI transcription by binding to an LRH-1 response element located in the proximal APOAI promoter region. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that LRH-1 binds to the human APO AI promoter in vivo. Finally, we show that the transcriptional repressor SHP (small heterodimer partner) suppressed APOAI gene expression by inhibiting LRH-1 transcriptional activity. Taken together, our results demonstrate that LRH-1 is a novel regulator of APOAI transcription and underscore the role of this receptor in cholesterol homeostasis.
The most important pathway for the catabolism and excretion of cholesterol in mammals is the formation of bile acids. Improper regulation of this pathway has implications for atherosclerosis, cholesterol gallstone formation, and some lipid storage diseases. Sterol 12 alpha-hydroxylase (12 alpha-hydroxylase) is required for cholic acid biosynthesis. The alpha(1)-fetoprotein transcription factor FTF is crucial for the expression and the bile acid-mediated down-regulation of 12 alpha-hydroxylase. Cholesterol, on the other hand, down-regulates expression of the 12 alpha-hydroxylase gene. In this study, we show that the two sterol regulatory binding proteins (SREBPs) have opposite effects on the 12 alpha-hydroxylase promoter. SREBP-1 activated the 12 alpha-hydroxylase promoter, as it does with many other cholesterol-regulated genes. In contrast, SREBP-2 suppressed 12 alpha-hydroxylase promoter activity. SREBP-1 mediates the cholesterol-down-regulation of 12 alpha-hydroxylase promoter by binding to two inverted sterol regulatory elements found approximately 300 nucleotides from the transcriptional initiation site. SREBP-2 mediated suppression of 12 alpha-hydroxylase without binding to its promoter. Data are presented suggesting that SREBP-2 suppresses the 12 alpha-hydroxylase promoter by interacting with FTF. This is the first report of a promoter responding oppositely to two members of the SREBP family of transcription factors. These studies provide a novel function and mode of action of a SREBP protein.
The enterohepatic circulation is essential for the maintenance of bile acids and cholesterol homeostasis. The ileal bile acid transporter on the apical membrane of enterocytes mediates the intestinal uptake of bile salts, but little is known about the bile salt secretion from the basolateral membrane of enterocytes into blood. In the basolateral membrane of enterocytes, an ATP-binding cassette transporter, multidrug resistance protein 3 (MRP3), is expressed, which has the ability to transport bile salts. We hypothesized that MRP3 might play a role in the enterohepatic circulation of bile salts by transporting them from enterocytes into circulating blood through the up-regulation of MRP3 expression, so we investigated the transcriptional control of MRP3 in response to bile salts. MRP3 mRNA levels were increased about 3-fold in human colon cells by chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In the promoter assay, the promoter activity of MRP3 was increased about 3-fold over the basal promoter activity when treated with CDCA, and the putative bile salt-responsive elements exist in the region -229/-138 including two alpha-1 fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF)-like elements. Constructs with a specific mutation in the consensus sequence of FTF elements showed no increase in basal transcriptional activity following CDCA treatment. In electrophoretic mobility shift assay with nuclear extracts, specific binding of FTF to FTF-like elements was observed when treated with CDCA. The expression of FTF mRNA levels were also markedly enhanced in response to CDCA, and overexpression of FTF specifically activated the MRP3 promoter activity about 4-fold over the basal promoter activity. FTF thus might play a key role not only in the bile salt synthetic pathway in hepatocytes but also in the bile salt excretion pathway in enterocytes through the regulation of MRP3 expression. MRP3 may contribute as a plausible bile salt-exporting transporter to the enterohepatic circulation of bile salts.
Bile acids repress the transcription of cytochrome P450 7A1 (CYP7A1), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in bile acid biosynthesis. Although bile acids activate the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), the mechanism underlying bile acid-mediated repression of CYP7A1 remained unclear. We have used a potent, nonsteroidal FXR ligand to show that FXR induces expression of small heterodimer partner 1 (SHP-1), an atypical member of the nuclear receptor family that lacks a DNA-binding domain. SHP-1 represses expression of CYP7A1 by inhibiting the activity of liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1), an orphan nuclear receptor that is known to regulate CYP7A1 expression positively. This bile acid-activated regulatory cascade provides a molecular basis for the coordinate suppression of CYP7A1 and other genes involved in bile acid biosynthesis.
Cholesterol conversion to bile acids occurs via the "classic" (neutral) or the "alternative" (acidic) bile acid biosynthesis pathways. Sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase/CYP8b1 is the specific enzyme required for cholic acid synthesis. The levels of this enzyme determine the ratio of cholic acid to chenodeoxycholic acid and thus the hydrophobicity of the circulating bile acid pool. Expression of the 12alpha-hydroxylase gene is tightly down-regulated by hydrophobic bile acids. In this study, we report the characterization of two DNA elements that are required for both the 12alpha-hydroxylase promoter activity and bile acid-mediated regulation. Mutation of these elements suppresses 12alpha-hydroxylase promoter activity. Mutations of any other part of the promoter do not alter substantially the promoter activity or alter regulation by bile acids relative to the wild type promoter. These two DNA elements bind alpha(1)-fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF), a member of the nuclear receptor family. We also show that overexpression of FTF in a non-liver cell line activates the sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase promoter. These studies demonstrate the crucial role of FTF for the expression and regulation of a critical gene in the bile acid biosynthetic pathways.
The liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1; NR5A2) and steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1; NR5A1) are two orphan members of the Ftz-F1 subfamily of nuclear receptors. LRH-1 is expressed in tissues derived from endoderm, including intestine, liver and exocrine pancreas, as well as in the ovary. In these tissues, LRH-1 plays a predominant role in development, reverse cholesterol transport, bile-acid homeostasis and steroidogenesis. SF-1 expression is confined to steroidogenic tissues and the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, where it is involved in the control of development, differentiation, steroidogenesis and sexual determination. In this article, we will review data concerning the structure, regulation and function of LRH-1. These data highlight structural similarities between LRH-1 and other Ftz-F1 members but also underscore important functional differences, assigning to LRH-1 a unique position among nuclear receptors.
The ATP binding cassette (ABC) half-transporters ABCG5 and ABCG8 facilitate biliary and intestinal removal of neutral sterols. Here, we identify a binding site for the orphan nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) at nt 134-142 of the ABCG5/ABCG8 intergenic region necessary for the activity of both the ABCG5 and ABCG8 promoters. Mutating this LRH-1 binding site reduced promoter activity of the human ABCG5/ABCG8 intergenic region more than 7-fold in HepG2 and Caco2 cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with HepG2 nuclear extracts demonstrated specific binding of LRH-1 to the LRH-1 binding motif in the human ABCG5/ABCG8 intergenic region. LRH-1 overexpression increased promoter activity up to 1.6-fold and 3-fold in Caco2 and 293 cells, respectively. Finally, deoxycholic acid repressed the ABCG5 and ABCG8 promoters, consistent with bile acid regulation via the farnesoid X receptor-small heterodimeric partner-LRH-1 pathway. These results demonstrate that LRH-1 is a positive transcription factor for ABCG5 and ABCG8 and, in conjunction with studies on LRH-1 activation of other promoters, identify LRH-1 as a "master regulator" for genes involved in sterol and bile acid secretion from liver and intestine.
Although hereditary or acquired defects in hepatobiliary transporter systems cause or predispose to cholestasis, adaptive bile acid transporter changes can counteract cholestasis by reducing hepatocellular and systemic concentrations of retained cholephiles. An important level in the regulation of adaptive bile acid transporters and overflow pathways is mediated at the transcriptional level by nuclear hormone receptors. Moreover, therapeutic approaches targeting nuclear receptors in cholestasis may stimulate these adaptive changes and open a new perspective for the treatment of cholestatic liver diseases. This review gives a comprehensive overview on bile acid transporters in the enterohepatic circulation and their adaptive changes in response to cholestasis as well as the regulatory networks underlying these adaptive mechanisms.
alpha(1)-Fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF), also known as liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1) is highly expressed in the liver and intestine, where it is implicated in the regulation of cholesterol, bile acid and steroid hormone homeostasis. FTF is an important regulator of bile acid metabolism. We show here that FTF plays a key regulatory role in lipid homeostasis including triglyceride and cholesterol homeostasis. FTF deficient mice developed lower levels of serum triglyceride and cholesterol as a result of lower expression of several hepatic FTF target genes. Chenodeoxycholic acid repressed FTF expression resulting in a decrease in serum triglyceride in wild-type mice. The absence of chenodeoxycholic acid-mediated repression in FTF(+/-) mice demonstrated the essential role of FTF in triglyceride metabolism. Taken together, our results identify the nuclear receptor FTF as a central regulator of lipid metabolism.
The orphan nuclear receptor LRH-1 (liver receptor homologue-1; NR5A2) plays a critical role in development, bile acid synthesis and cholesterol metabolism. LRH-1 is also expressed in the ovary where it is implicated in the regulation of steroidogenic genes for steroid hormone synthesis. In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of the transcriptional regulation of CYP11A1 by LRH-1 and found that LRH-1-mediated transactivation was markedly repressed by PIASy [protein inhibitor of activated STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) y], the shortest member of the PIAS family. The suppression of LRH-1 activity requires the N-terminal repression domain. Although PIAS proteins also function as E3 SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier) ligases and enhance SUMO conjugation, PIASy-mediated repression was independent of LRH-1 SUMOylation status. In addition, histone deacetylase activity was not involved in the inhibition of LRH-1 by PIASy. Immunoprecipitation and mammalian two-hybrid analyses indicated that PIASy interacted with LRH-1 through the C-terminal region, including the AF-2 (activation function-2) motif, which was also involved in the interaction between LRH-1 and the co-activator SRC-1 (steroid receptor co-activator-1). PIASy inhibited the binding of SRC-1 to LRH-1, although overexpression of SRC-1 partially overcame the PIASy inhibition of LRH-1 induction of the CYP11A1 promoter. The results of the present study suggest that competition with co-activators may be an important mechanism underlying the PIASy repression of LRH-1-mediated transactivation.
The liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1; NR5A2) belongs to nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, and is expressed mainly in the liver, intestine, exocrine pancreas, and ovary. It binds DNA as a monomer, and is best known as a regulator of hepatic expression of the key bile acid biosynthetic enzyme cholesterol 7alpha hydroxylase (Cyp7A1). It is also expressed in embryonic stem cells and the initial stages of embryonic development, and the very early lethality of LRH-1 knockout mice highlights its essential developmental role. Recent crystal structures of LRH-1 and its closest relative steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1; NR5A1) identified phospholipids as potential ligands. This intriguing discovery raises the possibility of an unexpected new class of nuclear receptor signaling molecules, but the broader functional roles of LRH-1 and these new ligands remain to be established.
Cholelithiasis is a multifactorial process, and several mechanisms have been postulated. A decreased expression of the ileal apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) and of the cytosolic ileal lipid binding protein (ILBP) was recently described in female non-obese patients. The role of the recently identified organic solute transporters alpha and beta (OSTalpha, OSTbeta) in gallstone pathogenesis remains unclear. Therefore, we performed analysis of OSTalpha-OSTbeta in gallstone patients according to body weight. Ileal mucosal biopsies were collected during routine colonoscopy from female gallstone carriers (n = 19) and controls (n = 34). OSTalpha-OSTbeta mRNA expression was measured using the LightCycler sequence detection system; protein was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. The mRNA expression of OSTalpha-OSTbeta was significantly reduced (OSTalpha: 3.3-fold, P = 0.006; OSTbeta: 2.6-fold, P = 0.03) in normal-weight but not overweight gallstone carriers compared with controls. OSTalpha-OSTbeta protein levels also showed a reduction by 40-67%. The expression of OSTalpha-OSTbeta correlated positively with ASBT (r = 0.65, 0.58, respectively), ILBP (r = 0.77, 0.67), and the farnesoid X receptor (r = 0.58, 0.50). Fibroblast growth factor-19 showed a 2.8-fold reduction (P = 0.06), and liver receptor homolog-1 showed a 2-fold reduction (P = 0.04) in non-obese patients. In conclusion, an impaired function of all three ileal bile acid transporters may lead to low ileal bile acid reabsorption and an altered bile acid pool composition and therefore may contribute to the formation of gallstones in non-obese patients.
Cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the classic pathway of hepatic bile acid biosynthesis from cholesterol. During fasting and in type I diabetes, elevated levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) induce expression of the Cyp7A1 gene and overexpression of PGC-1alpha in hepatoma cells stimulates bile acid synthesis. Using Ad-PGC-1alpha-RNA interference to induce acute disruption of PGC-1alpha in mice, here we show that PGC-1alpha is necessary for fasting-mediated induction of CYP7A1. Co-immunoprecipitation and promoter activation studies reveal that the induction of CYP7A1 is mediated by direct interaction between PGC-1alpha and the AF2 domain of liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1). In contrast, the very similar PGC-1beta could not substitute for PGC-1alpha. We also show that transactivation of PGC-1alpha and LRH-1 is repressed by the small heterodimer partner (SHP). Treatment of mice with GW4064, a synthetic agonist for farnesoid X receptor, induced SHP expression and decreased both the recruitment of PGC-1alpha to the Cyp7A1 promoter and the fasting-induced expression of CYP7A1 mRNA. These data suggest that PGC-1alpha is an important co-activator for LRH-1 and that SHP targets the interaction between LRH-1 and PGC-1alpha to inhibit CYP7A1 expression. Overall, these studies provide further evidence for the important role of PGC-1alpha in bile acid homeostasis and suggest that pharmacological targeting of farnesoid X receptor in vivo can be used to reverse the increase in CYP7A1 associated with adverse metabolic conditions.
The metabolic conversion of cholesterol into bile acids in liver is initiated by the rate-limiting cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), whereas the bile salt export pump (BSEP) is responsible for the canalicular secretion of bile acids. Liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1) is a key transcriptional factor required for the hepatic expression of CYP7A1. We hypothesized that LRH-1 was also involved in the transcriptional regulation of BSEP. In support of our hypothesis, we found that overexpression of LRH-1 induced, whereas knockdown of LRH-1 decreased, BSEP expression. Consistent with its role in transcriptional regulation, LRH-1 dose-dependently transactivated the BSEP promoter. In addition, such transactivation by LRH-1 was required for maximal induction of BSEP expression through the bile acid/farnesoid X receptor (FXR) activation pathway. Bioinformatic and mutational analysis led to the identification of a functional liver receptor homolog 1-responsive element (LRHRE) in the BSEP promoter. Specific binding of LRH-1 to the LRHRE and recruitment of LRH-1 to the BSEP promoter were demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, respectively. In conclusion, LRH-1 transcriptionally activated the BSEP promoter and functioned as a modulator in bile acid/FXR-mediated BSEP regulation. These results suggest that LRH-1 plays a supporting role to FXR in maintaining hepatic bile acid levels by coordinately regulating CYP7A1 and BSEP for bile acid synthesis and elimination, respectively.
Bile acids are required for intestinal absorption and biliary solubilization of cholesterol and lipids. In addition, bile acids play a crucial role in cholesterol homeostasis. One of the key enzymes in the bile acid biosynthetic pathways is cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase/cytochrome P450 7alpha-hydroxylase (7alpha-hydroxylase), which is the rate-limiting and regulatory step of the "classic" pathway. Transcription of the 7alpha-hydroxylase gene is highly regulated. Two nuclear receptors, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF-4alpha) and alpha(1)-fetoprotein transcription factor, are required for both transcription and regulation by different physiological events. It has been shown that some mitogen-activated protein kinases, such as the c-Jun N-terminal kinase and the ERK, play important roles in the regulation of 7alpha-hydroxylase transcription. In this study, we show evidence that the p38 kinase pathway plays an important role in 7alpha-hydroxylase expression and hence in bile acid synthesis. Inhibition of p38 kinase activity in primary hepatocytes results in approximately 5-10-fold reduction of 7alpha-hydroxylase mRNA. This suppression is mediated, at least in part, through HNF-4alpha. Inhibition of p38 kinase activity diminishes HNF-4alpha nuclear protein levels and its phosphorylation in vivo and in vitro, and it renders a less stable protein. Induction of the p38 kinase pathway by insulin results in an increase in HNF-4alpha protein and a concomitant induction of 7alpha-hydroxylase expression that is blocked by inhibiting the p38 pathway. These studies show a functional link between the p38 signaling pathway, HNF-4alpha, and bile acid synthesis.
Œ±(1)-Fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF), also known as liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1) is highly expressed in liver and intestine, where it is implicated in the regulation of cholesterol, bile acid and steroid hormone homeostasis. FTF is an important regulator of bile acid metabolism. We show here that FTF plays a key regulatory role in lipid homeostasis including triglyceride and cholesterol homeostasis. FTF deficient mice developed lower levels of serum triglyceride and cholesterol as a result of lower expression of several hepatic FTF target genes. Chenodeoxycholic acid repressed FTF expression resulting in a decrease in serum triglyceride in wild-type mice. The absence of chenodeoxycholic acid-mediated repression in FTF(+/-) mice demonstrated the essential role of FTF in triglyceride metabolism. Taken together, our results identify the nuclear receptor FTF as a central regulator of lipid metabolism.
Liver receptor homolog-1 (NR5A2) is a nuclear receptor originally identified in the liver and mostly known for its regulatory role in cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis. More recently, liver receptor homolog-1 has emerged as a key regulator of intestinal function, coordinating unanticipated actions, such as cell renewal and local immune function with important implications to common intestinal diseases, including colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease. Unlike most of the other nuclear receptors, liver receptor homolog-1 acts as a constitutively active transcription factor to drive the transcription of its target genes. Liver receptor homolog-1 activity however is to a major extent regulated by different corepressors and posttranslational modifications, which may account for its tissue-specific functions. This review will provide an update on the molecular aspects of liver receptor homolog-1 action and focus on some emerging aspects of its function in normal and diseased gut. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Translating nuclear receptors from health to disease.
The orphan nuclear receptor liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1) has roles in the development, cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis, and steroidogenesis. It also enhances proliferation and cell cycle progression of cancer cells. In breast cancer, LRH-1 expression is associated with invasive breast cancer; positively correlates with ERŒ± status and aromatase activity; and promotes oestrogen-dependent cell proliferation. However, the mechanism of action of LRH-1 in breast cancer epithelial cells is still not clear. By silencing or over-expressing LRH-1 in ER-positive MCF-7 and ER-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, we have demonstrated that LRH-1 promotes motility and cell invasiveness. Similar effects were observed in the non-tumourigenic mammary epithelial cell line, MCF-10A. Remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton and E-cadherin cleavage was observed with LRH-1 over-expression, contributing to increased migratory and invasive properties. Additionally, in LRH-1 over-expressing cells, the truncation of the 120‚ÄäkDa E-cadherin to the inactive 97‚ÄäkDa form was observed. These post-translational modifications in E-cadherin may be associated with LRH-1-dependent changes to matrix metalloproteinase 9 expression. These findings suggest a new role of LRH-1 in promoting migration and invasion in breast cancer, independent of oestrogen sensitivity. Therefore, LRH-1 may represent a new target for breast cancer therapeutics.
Rituximab (RIT) is effective as a part of the desensitization therapy before ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation (ABOi-KTx), and a single dose of RIT at 375 mg/m2 or less is recommended. However, adequate RIT dose recommendations have not yet been established for individual recipients. Therefore, we evaluated the relationship between the proportion of B cells in peripheral blood and acute antibody-mediated rejection (AAMR).
Forty-four consecutive ABOi-KTx recipients were enrolled in this retrospective study. Before transplantation, subjects were treated with RIT at various doses, ranging from 65 to 400 mg/body (46-263 mg/m2), followed by plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin as a desensitization therapy. The percentage of CD19+ cells in the total peripheral blood lymphocytes population (%CD19) was determined the day before transplantation. Transplant recipients were divided into 2 groups according to pretransplant %CD19, as follows: low %CD19 group,¬†‚â§ 1.2% (n¬†= 35) and high %CD19 group, &gt; 1.2% (n¬†= 9). The relationship between %CD19 and incidence of AAMR was evaluated, and the predicting factors for AAMR incidence were determined by univariate and multivariate analyses.
The incidence of AAMR was significantly higher in the high %CD19 group than in the low %CD19 group (44.4% vs 5.7%, P¬†= .006). Furthermore, multivariate analysis showed that %CD19 &gt; 1.2% was the only independent factor to predict AAMR, with an odds ratio of 14.31 (P¬†= .038).
High %CD19 values after rituximab administration in ABOi-KTx recipients implies insufficient depletion of B cells, which can lead to AAMR.
Here, we report the isolation, identification, whole-genome sequencing, and annotation of the bacterium Yimella sp. strain RIT 621. Concentrated spent medium extract treated with ethyl acetate was found to produce bactericidal compounds against the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis BGSC 168 and the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli ATCC 25922.
Spike and wave discharges are the main electrographic characteristic of a number of epileptic brain disorders including childhood absence epilepsy and photosensitive epilepsy. The basic dynamic mechanism that underlies the occurrence of these abnormal electrical patterns in the brain is not well understood. The current paper aims to provide a dynamic explanation for features and generation mechanism of spike and wave discharges in the brain. The main proposition of this study is that epileptic seizures could be interpreted as a resonance phenomenon rather than a limit cycle behavior. To shows this, a revised version of Jansen-Rit neural mass model is employed. The system can switch between monostable and bistable regimes, which are considered in this paper as wake and sleep states of the brain, respectively. In particular, it is shown that, in monostable region, the model can depict the alpha rhythm and alpha rhythm suppression due to mental activity. Frequency responses of the model near the bistable regime demonstrate that high amplitude harmonic excitation may lead to spike and wave like oscillations. Based on the computational results and the concept of stochastic resonance, a model for absence epilepsy is presented which can simulate spontaneous transitions between ictal and interictal states. Finally, it is shown that spike and wave discharges during epileptic seizures can be explained as a resonance phenomenon in a nonlinear system.
An approach for accelerating a quasimonoenergetic proton bunch via a hemispherically converging collisionless shock created in laser-cluster interactions at the relativistically induced transparency (RIT) regime is studied using three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. By the action of focusing a petawatt class laser pulse onto a micron-size spherical hydrogen cluster, a crescent-shaped collisionless shock is launched at the laser-irradiated hemisphere and propagates inward. The shock converges at the sphere center in concurrence with the onset of the RIT, thereby allowing the proton bunch to be pushed out from the shock surface in the laser propagation direction. The proton bunch experiences further acceleration both inside and outside of the cluster to finally exhibit a quasimonoenergetic spectral peak around 300¬†MeV while maintaining a narrow energy spread (‚àº10%) and a small half-divergence angle (‚àº5¬∞) via the effect of the RIT. This mechanism works for finite ranges of parameters with threshold values concerning the laser peak intensity and the cluster radius, resulting from the synchronization of the multiple processes in a self-consistent manner. The present scheme utilizing the internal and external degrees of freedom ascribed to the spherical cluster leads to the proton bunch alternative to the plain target, which allows the operation with a high repetition rate and impurity free.
The orphan receptor SHP interacts with many nuclear receptors and inhibits their transcriptional activities. SHP is central to feedback repression of cholesterol 7alpha hydroxylase gene (CYP7A1) expression by bile acids, which is critical for maintaining cholesterol homeostasis. Using CYP7A1 as a model system, we studied the molecular mechanisms of SHP repression at the level of native chromatin. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies showed that mSin3A and a Swi/Snf complex containing Brm as a central ATPase were recruited to the promoter. This recruitment was associated with chromatin remodeling after bile acid treatment that was blunted by inhibition of the endogenous Swi/Snf function by dominant-negative ATPase mutants. Biochemical studies indicated that SHP was associated with the mSin3A-Swi/Snf complex by direct interaction with Brm and mSin3A through its repression domain. Expression of Brm, but not an ATPase mutant, inhibited CYP7A1 promoter activity and further enhanced SHP-mediated repression. Bile acid-induced recruitment of mSin3A/Brm, chromatin remodeling, and concomitant repression of endogenous CYP7A1 expression were impaired when SHP expression was inhibited by SHP small interfering RNA. Our results suggest that SHP mediates recruitment of mSin3A-Swi/Snf to the CYP7A1 promoter, resulting in chromatin remodeling and gene repression, which may also be a mechanism for the repression by SHP of genes activated by many nuclear receptors. Our study establishes the first link between a Swi/Snf complex and regulation of cholesterol metabolism.
The orphan nuclear hormone receptor SHP (gene designation NROB2) is an important component of a negative regulatory cascade by which high levels of bile acids repress bile acid biosynthesis. Short term studies in SHP null animals confirm this function and also reveal the existence of additional pathways for bile acid negative feedback regulation. We have used long term dietary treatments to test the role of SHP in response to chronic elevation of bile acids, cholesterol, or both. In contrast to the increased sensitivity predicted from the loss of negative feedback regulation, the SHP null mice were relatively resistant to the hepatotoxicity associated with a diet containing 0.5% cholic acid and the much more severe effects of a diet containing both 0.5% cholic acid and 2% cholesterol. This was associated with decreased hepatic accumulation of cholesterol and triglycerides in the SHP null mice. There were also alterations in the expression of a number of genes involved in cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis, notably cholesterol 12alpha-hydroxylase (CYP8B1), which was strongly reexpressed in the SHP null mice, but not the wild type mice fed either bile acid containing diet. This contrasts with the strong repression of CYP8B1 observed with short term bile acid feeding, as well as the effects of long term feeding on other bile acid biosynthetic enzymes such as cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). CYP8B1 expression could contribute to the decreased toxicity of the chronic bile acid treatment by increasing the hydrophilicity of the bile acid pool. These results identify an unexpected role for SHP in hepatotoxicity and suggest new approaches to modulating effects of chronically elevated bile acids in cholestasis.
The liver and intestine play crucial roles in maintaining bile acid homeostasis. Here, we demonstrate that fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15) signals from intestine to liver to repress the gene encoding cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), which catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in the classical bile acid synthetic pathway. FGF15 expression is stimulated in the small intestine by the nuclear bile acid receptor FXR and represses Cyp7a1 in liver through a mechanism that involves FGF receptor 4 (FGFR4) and the orphan nuclear receptor SHP. Mice lacking FGF15 have increased hepatic CYP7A1 mRNA and protein levels and corresponding increases in CYP7A1 enzyme activity and fecal bile acid excretion. These studies define FGF15 and FGFR4 as components of a gut-liver signaling pathway that synergizes with SHP to regulate bile acid synthesis.
Recent studies reveal that bile acids are signalling molecules that activate several nuclear receptors and regulate many physiological pathways and processes to maintain bile acid and cholesterol homeostasis. Analysis of orphan receptor expression patterns in enterohepatic tissues identified bile acids as ligands for farnesoid X receptor (FXR). The primary bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) was shown to be the most potent FXR ligand in vitro at an EC50 of 10-50 microM. FXR can also be activated by the secondary bile acids lithocholic acid (LCA) and deoxycholic acid (DCA). Upon activation FXR heterodimerises with 9-cis retinoic X receptor (RXR) and regulates a cohort of genes involved in cholesterol catabolism and bile acids biosynthesis. Thus bile acid-activated FXR directly induces expression of Small Heterodimer Partner (SHP), a nuclear receptor that suppresses bile acid biosynthesis down-regulates the Na+ taurocholate cotransport peptide (NTCP), a pump depicted to transport bile acids from the lumen into hepatocyte, and induces expression of bile salt export pump (BSEP), the principal bile acid efflux transporter in the liver. As demonstrated by the Fxr null mice, FXR defends the liver against cholestasis. The 6-ethyl derivative of CDCA (6-ECDCA) is approximately 100 fold more potent than CDCA in activating FXR in vitro. In vivo administration of 6-ECDCA protects against cholestasis induced by estrogen and LCA in rats providing evidence that development of potent FXR agonists might represent a new approach for the treatment of cholestastic disorders.
SHP (small heterodimer partner) is an important component of the feedback regulatory cascade, which controls the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids. In order to identify the bona fide molecular targets of SHP, we performed global gene expression profiling combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in transgenic mice constitutively expressing SHP in the liver. We demonstrate that SHP affects genes involved in diverse biological pathways, and in particular, several key genes involved in consecutive steps of cholesterol degradation, bile acid conjugation, transport and lipogenic pathways. Sustained expression of SHP leads to the depletion of hepatic bile acid pool and a concomitant accumulation of triglycerides in the liver. The mechanism responsible for this phenotype includes SHP-mediated direct repression of downstream target genes and the bile acid sensor FXRalpha, and an indirect activation of PPARgamma and SREBP-1c genes. We present evidence for the role of altered chromatin configurations in defining distinct gene-specific mechanisms by which SHP mediates differential transcriptional repression. The multiplicity of genes under its control suggests that SHP is a pleiotropic regulator of diverse metabolic pathways.
The orphan nuclear hormone receptor liver receptor homologous protein-1 (LRH-1; NR5A2, also known as FTF), an unusual receptor that binds DNA as a monomer, is an essential regulator of expression of a rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid formation, cholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase. In a classic negative feedback loop that is a crucial component of the complex regulation of cholesterol metabolism, cholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase expression is decreased when bile acid levels are high. This repression is thought to be based on the bile acid-dependent induction of expression of the orphan receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP) NR0B2, which inhibits the activity of LRH-1. We have explored the molecular basis for this important regulatory effect by characterizing the mechanisms by which mouse and human SHP inhibit LRH-1-mediated transactivation. Both SHP proteins specifically interact with the AF-2 transactivation domain of LRH-1 both in vivo and in vitro. This domain is a common target for coactivator interaction, and the SHP proteins can compete with p160 coactivators for binding to LRH-1. In addition to the N-terminal receptor interaction domain, SHP includes a C-terminal domain with autonomous repression function. Neither a deletion nor a point mutation specifically affecting this domain blocked the ability to interact with LRH-1 to compete for coactivator binding or to repress LRH-1 transactivation. However, the relative ability of these mutants to inhibit LRH-1-mediated transactivation was markedly decreased. We conclude that the proposed central role of SHP in cholesterol metabolism is based on a two-step mechanism that is dependent on both coactivator competition and direct transcriptional repression.
Hepatic bile acid homeostasis is regulated by negative feedback inhibition of genes involved in the uptake and synthesis of bile acids. Bile acids down-regulate the rate-limiting gene for bile acid synthesis, cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (cyp7a), via bile acid receptor (fxr) activation of an inhibitory nuclear receptor, shp. We hypothesized that shp would also mediate negative feedback regulation of ntcp, the principal hepatic bile acid transporter.
Primary rat hepatocytes or transfected HepG2 and Cos cells were treated with retinoids with or without bile acids, and effects on bile acid transport and ntcp and shp gene expression and promoter activity were determined. Gel shift assays were performed using synthetic fxr, rxr, and rar proteins.
Bile acid treatment of primary rat hepatocytes prevented retinoid activation of ntcp gene expression and function; this corresponded temporally with shp gene activation. Bile acid-mediated down-regulation occurred via fxr-dependent suppression of the ntcp RXR:RAR response element. Moreover, cotransfected shp directly inhibited retinoid activation of the ntcp promoter.
These studies show negative feedback regulation of ntcp by bile acid-activated fxr via induction of shp. This novel regulatory pathway provides a means for coordinated down-regulation of bile acid import and synthesis, thereby protecting the hepatocyte from bile acid-mediated damage in cholestatic conditions.
SHP (small heterodimer partner, NR1I0) is an atypical orphan member of the nuclear receptor subfamily in that it lacks a DNA-binding domain. It is mostly expressed in the liver, where it binds to and inhibits the function of nuclear receptors. SHP is up-regulated by primary bile acids, through the activation of their receptor farnesoid X receptor, leading to the repression of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7alpha) expression, the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid production from cholesterol. PXR (pregnane X receptor, NR1I2) is a broad-specificity sensor that recognizes a wide variety of synthetic drugs as well as endogenous compounds such as bile acid precursors. Upon activation, PXR induces CYP3A and inhibits CYP7alpha, suggesting that PXR can act on both bile acid synthesis and elimination. Indeed, CYP7alpha and CYP3A are involved in biochemical pathways leading to cholesterol conversion into primary bile acids, whereas CYP3A is also involved in the detoxification of toxic secondary bile acid derivatives. Here, we show that PXR is a target for SHP. Using pull-down assays, we show that SHP interacts with both murine and human PXR in a ligand-dependent manner. From transient transfection assays, SHP is shown to be a potent repressor of PXR transactivation. Furthermore, we report that chenodeoxycholic acid and cholic acid, two farnesoid X receptor ligands, induce up-regulation of SHP and provoke a repression of PXR-mediated CYP3A induction in human hepatocytes as well as in vivo in mice. These results reveal an elaborate regulatory cascade, tightly controlled by SHP, for both the maintenance of bile acid production and detoxification in the liver.
Guggulipid is an extract of the guggul tree Commiphora mukul and has been widely used to treat hyperlipidemia in humans. The plant sterol guggulsterone (GS) is the active agent in this extract. Recent studies have shown that GS can act as an antagonist ligand for farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and decrease expression of bile acid-activated genes. Here we show that GS, although an FXR antagonist in coactivator association assays, enhances FXR agonist-induced transcription of bile salt export pump (BSEP), a major hepatic bile acid transporter. In HepG2 cells, in the presence of an FXR agonist such as chenodeoxycholate or GW4064, GS enhanced endogenous BSEP expression with a maximum induction of 400-500% that induced by an FXR agonist alone. This enhancement was also readily observed in FXR-dependent BSEP promoter activation using a luciferase reporter construct. In addition, GS alone slightly increased BSEP promoter activation in the absence of an FXR agonist. Consistent with the results in HepG2, guggulipid treatment in Fisher rats increased BSEP mRNA. Interestingly, in these animals expression of the orphan nuclear receptor SHP (small heterodimer partner), a known FXR target, was also significantly increased, whereas expression of other FXR targets including cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (Cyp 7a1), sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase (Cyp 8b1), and the intestinal bile acid-binding protein (I-BABP), remained unchanged. Thus, we propose that GS is a selective bile acid receptor modulator that regulates expression of a subset of FXR targets. Guggulipid treatment in rats lowered serum triglyceride and raised serum high density lipoprotein levels. Taken together, these data suggest that guggulsterone defines a novel class of FXR ligands characterized by antagonist activities in coactivator association assays but with the ability to enhance the action of agonists on BSEP expression in vivo.
We investigated the roles of hydrophobic deoxycholic acid (DCA) and hydrophilic ursocholic acid (UCA) in the regulation of the orphan nuclear farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in vivo. Rabbits with bile fistula drainage (removal of the endogenous bile acid pool), rabbits with bile fistula drainage and replacement with either DCA or UCA, and intact rabbits fed 0.5% cholic acid (CA) (enlarged endogenous bile acid pool) were studied. After bile fistula drainage, cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) mRNA and activity levels increased, FXR-mediated transcription was decreased, and FXR mRNA and nuclear protein levels declined. Replacing the enterohepatic bile acid pool with DCA restored FXR mRNA and nuclear protein levels and activated FXR-mediated transcription as evidenced by the increased expression of its target genes, SHP and BSEP, and decreased CYP7A1 mRNA level and activity. Replacing the bile acid pool with UCA also restored FXR mRNA and nuclear protein levels but did not activate FXR-mediated transcription, because the SHP mRNA level and CYP7A1 mRNA level and activity were unchanged. Feeding CA to intact rabbits expanded the bile acid pool enriched with the FXR high affinity ligand, DCA. FXR-mediated transcription became activated as shown by increased SHP and BSEP mRNA levels and decreased CYP7A1 mRNA level and activity but did not change FXR mRNA or nuclear protein levels. Thus, both hydrophobic and hydrophilic bile acids are effective in maintaining FXR mRNA and nuclear protein levels. However, the activating ligand (DCA) in the enterohepatic flux is necessary for FXR-mediated transcriptional regulation, which leads to down-regulation of CYP7A1.
The orphan nuclear hormone receptor SHP has been proposed to have a key role in the negative feedback regulation of bile acid production. Consistent with this, mice lacking the SHP gene exhibit mild defects in bile acid homeostasis and fail to repress cholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase expression in response to a specific agonist for the bile acid receptor FXR. However, this repression is retained in SHP null mice fed bile acids, demonstrating the existence of compensatory repression pathways of bile acid signaling. We provide evidence for two such pathways, based on activation of the xenobiotic receptor PXR or the c-Jun N-terminal kinase JNK. We conclude that redundant mechanisms regulate this critical aspect of cholesterol homeostasis.
TSPX is a tumor suppressor gene located at Xp11.22, a prostate cancer susceptibility locus. It is ubiquitously expressed in most tissues but frequently downregulated in various cancers, including lung, brain, liver and prostate cancers. The C-terminal acidic domain (CAD) of TSPX is crucial for the tumor suppressor functions, such as inhibition of cyclin B/CDK1 phosphorylation and androgen receptor transactivation. Currently, the exact role of the TSPX CAD in transcriptional regulation of downstream genes is still uncertain. Using different variants of TSPX, we showed that overexpression of either TSPX, that harbors a CAD, or a CAD-truncated variant (TSPX[‚àÜC]) drastically retarded cell proliferation in a prostate cancer cell line LNCaP, but cell death was induced only by overexpression of TSPX. Transcriptome analyses showed that TSPX or TSPX[‚àÜC] overexpression downregulated multiple cancer-drivers/oncogenes, including MYC and MYB, in a CAD-dependent manner and upregulated various tumor suppressors in a CAD-independent manner. Datamining of transcriptomes of prostate cancer specimens in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset confirmed the negative correlation between the expression level of TSPX and those of MYC and MYB in clinical prostate cancer, thereby supporting the hypothesis that the CAD of TSPX plays an important role in suppression of cancer-drivers/oncogenes in prostatic oncogenesis.
Drought is the most serious meteorological disaster affecting wheat production. Members of the R2R3-MYB gene subfamily play a crucial role in the regulation of the wheat drought stress response. In this study, the function of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-induced expression of the wheat R2R3-MYB gene TaSIM in response to drought stress was characterized. Œ≤-Glucuronidase (GUS) histochemical staining revealed that the TaSIM promoter can drive the expression of the GUS gene in the flowers, roots, stems and rosette leaves. Moreover, TaSIM was expressed in the stamens, pistils, roots, stems and leaves of wheat. The TaSIM promoter contains a known stress-responsive cis-acting element and is inducible by stress, PEG and abscisic acid (ABA). Under drought stress, compared with wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis, transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing TaSIM presented significantly lower leaf water loss rates and increased survival. Moreover, the content of soluble sugars and proline and the expression of stress-related genes (RD29A and RD22) in transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing TaSIM were higher than those in WT Arabidopsis under drought stress. Our results indicate that TaSIM plays a positive role in the drought stress response and can be used as a candidate gene for the genetic engineering of wheat drought resistance.
Rosa roxburghii Tratt (Rosaceae) has a fruit that is flavorful, economically valuable, and highly nutritious, providing numerous health benefits. Myeloblastosis (MYB) proteins play key roles in the development and fruit quality of R. roxburghii. However, there is little available genomic and transcriptomic information for R. roxburghii. Here, a normalized cDNA library was constructed from five tissues, including the stem, leaf, flower, young fruit, and mature fruit, using the Illumina HiSeq 3000 platform. De novo assembly was performed, and 470.66 million clean reads were obtained. In total, 63,727 unigenes, with an average GC content of 42.08%, were discovered, 60,406 of which were annotated. In addition, 9,354 unigenes were assigned to Gene Ontology categories, and 20,202 unigenes were assigned to 25 Eukaryotic Ortholog Groups. Additionally, 19,508 unigenes were classified into 140 pathways of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database. Based on the transcriptome, 163 unigenes associated with MYBs were detected. Among these genes, 75 genes were significantly expressed in the various tissues, including 10 R1 MYB, 42 R2R3 MYB, one R1R2R3 MYB, three R4 MYB and 19 atypical MYB-like proteins. The expression levels of the 12 MYB genes randomly selected for quantitative real-time PCR analysis corroborated the RNA sequencing results. A total of 37,545 microsatellites were detected, with an average expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeat frequency of 0.59 (37,545/63,727). This transcriptome data improves our understanding of the role of MYB in R. roxburghii and will be valuable for identifying genes of interest.
Plants with purple leave attain interest because of their biological importance. A new rice mutant, purple leaf (pl) was isolated from an indicia cultivar Zhenong 34, which was induced by ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis. The genetic analyses substantiated that pl was corroborated by one recessive allele and confirmed by map based cloning using Insertion-Deletion (InDel) markers located on the long arm of chromosome 5. DNAseq data of the candidate part showed one bp insertion ('C' insertion) at +901‚ÄØbp position in the 3rd exon of OsPL gene. The pl was characterized as purple leaves, sheaths and leaf senescence phenotype at late grain filling stage of growth cycle. It possessed abnormal cell with distorted chloroplasts, less chlorophyll, and increased anthocyanin content in leaves. The anthocyanin biosynthesis genes, OsPAL, OsCHS, OsANS, and OsMYB55 showed up-regulation in pl plants compared to wild type (WT). High super oxide dismutase enzyme (SOD), catalase enzyme activity (CAT), total soluble sugar (TSS) and malondialdehyde activity (MDA) were detected in the pl; contrastingly, photosynthesis linked genes were down-regulated. The germinated pl seeds showed comparatively higher temperature stress tolerance than WT. The phytohormones abscicic acid (ABA), jasmonic acid (JA) and indole acetic acid (IAA) content were increased significantly in the pl plants. This research work will be provided information on better understanding of the molecular mechanism toward the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway in rice. Therefore, OsPL gene could be a good genetic tool in marker aided backcrossing or gene editing for improving the rice cultivation in future.
