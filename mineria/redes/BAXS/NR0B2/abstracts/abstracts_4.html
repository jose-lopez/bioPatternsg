<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>	<meta charset="utf-8">	<title>generaci√≥n de archivo html</title></head><body>Tob belongs to the anti-proliferative Tob/BTG family. The level of Tob throughout the cell cycle is regulated by the SCF (Skp1/Cullin/F-box protein)(Skp2) ubiquitin ligase (E3) complex. Here, we show that Coronin7 (CRN7) is also involved in Tob degradation. We identified CRN7 as a Tob-interacting molecule. A sequence containing two of the six WD motifs in the middle of CRN7 was responsible for the interaction. CRN7 enhanced the polyubiquitination of Tob in vitro, and overexpression of CRN7 promoted proteasome-dependent degradation of Tob. Furthermore, CRN7 interacted with Cullin1 and Roc1 to form a novel SCF-like E3 complex, suggesting that Tob protein is regulated by multiple ubiquitination machineries.
RBX1 (RING box protein 1), also known as ROC1 (Regulator of Cullin 1), is an essential component of SCF (Skp1/Cullins/F-box) E3 ubiquitin ligases, which target diverse proteins for proteasome-mediated degradation. Our recent study showed that RBX1 silencing triggered a DNA damage response (DDR) leading to G(2)-M arrest, senescence, and apoptosis, with the mechanism remaining elusive. Here, we show that, in human cancer cells, RBX1 silencing causes the accumulation of DNA replication licensing proteins CDT1 and ORC1, leading to DNA double-strand breaks, DDR, G(2) arrest, and, eventually, aneuploidy. Whereas CHK1 activation by RBX1 silencing is responsible for the G(2) arrest, enhanced DNA damage renders cancer cells more sensitive to radiation. In Caenorhabditis elegans, RBX-1 silencing causes CDT-1 accumulation, triggering DDR in intestinal cells, which is largely abrogated by simultaneous CDT-1 silencing. RBX-1 silencing also induces lethality during development of embryos and in adulthood. Thus, RBX1 E3 ligase is essential for the maintenance of mammalian genome integrity and the proper development and viability in C. elegans.
The SCF (Skp1-cullin-F-box proteins), also known as CRL (cullin-based RING ligase), is the largest family of E3 ubiquitin ligases that mediate approximately 20% ubiquitinated protein substrates for 26S proteasome degradation. Through promoting timely degradation of many key regulatory proteins, SCF E3 ligase controls numerous cellular processes; its dysfunction contributes to a number of human diseases, including cancer. The RING component of SCF complex consists of 2 family members, RBX1 (RING box protein 1), also known as ROC1 (regulator of cullins), and RBX2/ROC2 (also known as SAG [sensitive to apoptosis gene]), both of which are essential for the catalytic activity of SCF. RBX1 and RBX2 are evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans and play an essential role during mouse embryonic development. Moreover, RBX1 and RBX2 are both overexpressed in multiple human cancer tissues and required for the growth and survival of cancer cells. In this review, we will discuss the similarities and differences between 2 RING family members, their regulation of SCF E3 ligase activity, and their role in development, cancer cell survival, and skin carcinogenesis, along with a brief discussion of RBX-SCF E3 ligases as the cancer targets and a recently discovered small molecule inhibitor of SCF E3 ligases as a novel class of anticancer drugs.
Retrovirus-mediated transduction of Hoxb4 enhances hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) activity and enforced expression of Hoxb4 induces in vitro development of HSCs from differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. We previously showed that the HSC activity was abrogated by accumulated Geminin, an inhibitor for the DNA replication licensing factor Cdt1 in mice deficient in Rae28 (also known as Phc1), which encodes a member of Polycomb-group complex 1. In this study we found that Hoxb4 transduction reduced accumulated Geminin in Rae28-deficient mice, despite increasing the mRNA, and restored the impaired HSC activity. Supertransduction of Geminin suppressed the HSC activity induced by Hoxb4 transduction, whereas knockdown of Geminin promoted the clonogenic and replating activities, indicating the importance of Geminin regulation in the molecular mechanism underlying Hoxb4 transduction-mediated enhancement of the HSC activity. This facilitated our investigation of how transduced Hoxb4 reduced Geminin. We showed in vitro and in vivo that Hoxb4 and the Roc1 (also known as Rbx1)-Ddb1-Cul4a ubiquitin ligase core component formed a complex designated as RDCOXB4, which acted as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for Geminin and down-regulated Geminin through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Down-regulated Geminin and the resultant E2F activation may provide cells with proliferation potential by increasing a DNA prereplicative complex loaded onto chromatin. Here we suggest that transduced Hoxb4 down-regulates Geminin protein probably by constituting the E3 ubiquitin ligase for Geminin to provide hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells with proliferation potential.
Wavelet index (WLI) is a new parameter for monitoring depth of anesthesia based on Wavelet analysis. We observed the change of WLI and bispectral index (BIS) in patients regain of consciousness (ROC) in the absence of frontalis electromyographic (EMG) interference. The aim of this study was to compare the ability of WLI and BIS for reflecting ROC in patients undergone surgery.
Twelve patients who were scheduled for maxillofacial surgeries were enrolled in the study. BIS and WLI values were monitored continually. After being given midazolam and remifentanil, patients were asked to squeeze the investigator's hand ever 30 seconds. Patients were continuously given propofol until loss of consciousness (LOC1). Tunstall's isolated forearm technique was used to test the surgical consciousness in patients. After total muscle relaxation, endotracheal intubations were performed, and the patients were connected to a ventilator. Then, propofol was withdrawn until the patients showed regain of consciousness (ROC1) and an awareness reaction. After the command test, patients were readministered with propofol until loss of consciousness (LOC2). After surgery, all of the sedatives were withdrawn, and the patients were let to regain consciousness (ROC2).
The BIS values of twelve patients at ROC1 after using muscle relaxant were much lower than those at LOC1 and ROC2 without using muscle relaxant, showing statistical significance (P &lt; 0.05). Meanwhile, the WLI values of twelve patients at ROC1 after using muscle relaxant were much higher than those at LOC1 and equal to ROC2 without using muscle relaxant, showing statistical significances (P &lt; 0.05) between ROC1 and LOC1.
This study showed that under muscle relaxation or facial paralysis, when there is no EMG signal, BIS can not accurately reflect regain of consciousness in surgical patients, but WLI can reflect it accurately. So WLI may have advantages for reflecting state of consciousness in surgical patients.
Death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) was identified as a mediator of interferon (IFN)-induced cell death. How IFN controls DAPK activation remains largely unknown. Here, we identify the BTB-Kelch protein KLHL20 as a negative regulator of DAPK. KLHL20 binds DAPK and Cullin 3 (Cul3) via its Kelch-repeat domain and BTB domain, respectively. The KLHL20-Cul3-ROC1 E3 ligase complex promotes DAPK polyubiquitination, thereby inducing the proteasomal degradation of DAPK. Accordingly, depletion of KLHL20 diminishes DAPK ubiquitination and degradation. The KLHL20-mediated DAPK ubiquitination is suppressed in cells receiving IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma, which induces an enrichment/sequestration of KLHL20 in the PML nuclear bodies, thereby separating KLHL20 from DAPK. Consequently, IFN triggers the stabilization of DAPK. This mechanism of DAPK stabilization is crucial for determining IFN responsiveness of tumor cells and contributes to IFN-induced autophagy. This study identifies KLHL20-Cul3-ROC1 as an E3 ligase for DAPK ubiquitination and reveals a regulatory mechanism of DAPK, through blocking its accessibility to this E3 ligase, in IFN-induced apoptotic and autophagic death. Our findings may be relevant to the problem of IFN resistance in cancer therapy.
UV-damaged-DNA-binding protein (UV-DDB) is a heterodimer comprised of DDB1 and DDB2 and integrated in a complex that includes a ubiquitin ligase component, cullin 4A, and Roc1. Here we show that the ubiquitin ligase activity of the DDB2 complex is required for efficient global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) in chromatin. Mutant DDB2 proteins derived from xeroderma pigmentosum group E patients are not able to mediate ubiquitylation around damaged sites in chromatin. We also found that CSN, a negative regulator of cullin-based ubiquitin ligases, dissociates from the DDB2 complex when the complex binds to damaged DNA and that XPC and Ku oppositely regulate the ubiquitin ligase activity, especially around damaged sites. Furthermore, the DDB2 complex-mediated ubiquitylation plays a role in recruiting XPA to damaged sites. These findings shed some light on the early stages of GG-NER.
Jasmonates control defense gene expression, growth, and fertility throughout the plant kingdom and have been studied extensively in Arabidopsis thaliana. The prohormone jasmonic acid (JA) is conjugated to amino acids such as isoleucine to form the active hormone jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile). A series of breakthroughs has identified the SCF [SCF consists of four subunits: a cullin, SKP1 (S-phase kinase-associated protein 1), a RING finger protein (RBX1/HRT1/ROC1), and an F-box protein] CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and the JASMONATE ZIM-DOMAIN (JAZ) proteins as central components in the perception of and transcriptional response to JA-Ile. JAZ proteins (most probably as dimers) bind transcription factors such as MYC2 before JA-Ile production. JA-Ile binds to COI1 to facilitate the formation of COI1-JAZ complexes, leading to ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of JAZ proteins. The degradation of JAZ proteins liberates transcription factors that function in the presence of the RNA polymerase II coregulatory complex Mediator to permit the expression of a number of jasmonate-regulated genes. Recent developments include the identification of COI1 as a receptor for jasmonates. Upstream of the signaling events, microRNA319 (miR319) negatively regulates the production of JA and JA-derived signals.
The mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex facilitates DNA access by transcription factors and the transcription machinery. The characteristic member of human SWI/SNF-A is BAF250/ARID1, of which there are two isoforms, BAF250a/ARID1a and BAF250b/ARID1b. Here we report that BAF250b complexes purified from mammalian cells contain elongin C (Elo C), a BC box binding component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase. BAF250b was found to have a BC box motif, associate with Elo C in a BC box-dependent manner, and, together with cullin 2 and Roc1, assemble into an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The BAF250b BC box mutant protein was unstable in vivo and was autoubiquitinated in a manner similar to that for the VHL BC box mutants. The discovery that BAF250 is part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase adds an enzymatic function to the chromatin-remodeling complex SWI/SNF-A. The immunopurified BAF250b E3 ubiquitin ligase was found to target histone H2B at lysine 120 for monoubiquitination in vitro. To date, all H2B monoubiquitination was attributed to the human homolog of yeast Bre1 (RNF20/40). Mutation of Drosophila osa, the homolog of BAF250, or depletion of BAF250 by RNA interference (RNAi) in cultured human cells resulted in global decreases in monoubiquitinated H2B, implicating BAF250 in the cross talk of histone modifications.
In a process contributing to the innate immunity of higher plants, Arabidopsis thaliana cyclophilin ROC1 induces the self-cleavage of Pseudomonas syringae putative cysteine protease AvrRpt2, triggering limited cleavage of A. thaliana RIN4, a negative regulator of plant immunity. We report an increase in AvRpt2 activity in hydrolysis of decapeptide substrates at -GG- sites of more than 5 orders of magnitude, in the presence of cyclophilin-like peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerases including ROC1 or hCyp18. Both full-length AvrRpt2 and its 21 kDa self-cleavage product (AvrRpt2(72-255)) were found to be equally active under these conditions. In contrast to classical isomer-specific proteolysis, inertness toward cleavage of a cis/trans prolyl bond isomer at the substrate P4 subsite is not the cause of cyclophilin-mediated activation of the proteolytic reaction. Monitoring single- and double-jump kinetics of proteolytic reactions in the presence of the PPIase inhibitor cyclosporin A revealed that the cis/trans ratio of potentially relevant prolyl bonds of AvrRpt2(72-255) remained the same in the functionally inactive state of AvrRpt2(72-255) and the productive AvrRpt2(72-255)-cyclophilin-substrate complex.
The SCF(Fbw7) ubiquitin ligase complex plays important roles in cell growth, survival, and differentiation via the ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated regulation of protein stability. Fbw7 (also known as Fbxw7, Sel-10, hCdc4, or hAgo), a substrate recognition subunit of SCF(Fbw7) ubiquitin ligase, facilitates the degradation of several proto-oncogene products by the proteasome. Given that mutations in Fbw7 are found in various types of human cancers, Fbw7 is considered to be a potent tumor suppressor. In the present study, we show that E1A, an oncogene product derived from adenovirus, interferes with the activity of the SCF(Fbw7) ubiquitin ligase. E1A interacted with SCF(Fbw7) and attenuated the ubiquitylation of its target proteins in vivo. Furthermore, using in vitro purified SCF(Fbw7) component proteins, we found that E1A directly bound to Roc1/Rbx1 and CUL1 and that E1A inhibited the ubiquitin ligase activity of the Roc1/Rbx1-CUL1 complex but not that of another RING-type ubiquitin ligase, Mdm2. Ectopically expressed E1A interacted with cellular endogenous Roc1/Rbx1 and CUL1 and decelerated the degradation of several protooncogene products that were degraded by SCF(Fbw7) ubiquitin ligase. Moreover, after wild-type adenovirus infection, adenovirus-derived E1A interacted with endogenous Roc1/Rbx1 and decelerated degradation of the endogenous target protein of SCF(Fbw7). These observations demonstrated that E1A perturbs protein turnover regulated by SCF(Fbw7) through the inhibition of SCF(Fbw7) ubiquitin ligase. Our findings may help to explain the mechanism whereby adenovirus infection induces unregulated proliferation.
 RBX1 (also known as ROC1) is a RING subunit of SCF (Skp1, Cullins, F-box proteins) E3 ubiquitin ligases, required for SCF to direct a timely degradation of diverse substrates, thereby regulating numerous cellular processes under both physiological and pathological conditions. Previous studies have shown that RBX1 is essential for growth in yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila. The role of RBX1 in mouse development and in regulation of cancer cell survival was unknown. Our recent work demonstrated that RBX1 is an essential gene for mouse embryogenesis, and targeted disruption of RBX1 causes embryonic lethality at E7.5 due to hypoproliferation as a result of p27 accumulation. We also showed that RBX1 is overexpressed in a number of human cancers, and siRNA silencing of RBX1 caused cancer cell death as a result of sequential induction of G2-M arrest, senescence and apoptosis. These findings reveal a physiological role of RBX1 during mouse development and a pathological role for the survival of human cancer cells. Differential outcomes between normal (growth arrest) and cancer cells (cell death) upon RBX1 disruption/silencing suggest RBX1 as a valid anticancer target.Comments on:Tan M, Davis SW, Saunders TL, Zhu Y, Sun Y. RBX1/ROC1 disruption results in early embryonic lethality due to proliferation failure, partially rescued by simultaneous loss of p27.

The cellular response to hypoxia involves several signalling pathways that mediate adaptation and survival. REDD1 (regulated in development and DNA damage responses 1), a hypoxia-inducible factor-1 target gene, has a crucial role in inhibiting mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling during hypoxic stress. However, little is known about the signalling pathways and post-translational modifications that regulate REDD1 function. Here, we show that REDD1 is subject to ubiquitin-mediated degradation mediated by the CUL4A-DDB1-ROC1-beta-TRCP E3 ligase complex and through the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta. Furthermore, REDD1 degradation is crucially required for the restoration of mTOR signalling as cells recover from hypoxic stress. Our findings define a mechanism underlying REDD1 degradation and its importance for regulating mTOR signalling.
Regulator of Cullins-1 (ROC1) or Ring Box Protein-1 (RBX1) is a RING component of SCF (Skp-1, cullins, F-box proteins) E3 ubiquitin ligases, which regulate diverse cellular processes by targeting a variety of substrates for degradation. However, little is known about the role of ROC1 in human cancer. Here, we report that ROC1 is ubiquitously overexpressed in primary human tumor tissues and human cancer cell lines. ROC1 silencing by siRNA significantly inhibited the growth of multiple human cancer cell lines via induction of senescence and apoptosis as well as G(2)-M arrest. Senescence induction is coupled with DNA damage in p53/p21- and p16/pRB-independent manners. Apoptosis is associated with accumulation of Puma and reduction of Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and survivin; and G(2)-M arrest is associated with accumulation of 14-3-3sigma and elimination of cyclin B1 and Cdc2. In U87 glioblastoma cells, these phenotypic changes occur sequentially upon ROC1 silencing, starting with G(2)-M arrest, followed by apoptosis and senescence. Thus, ROC1 silencing triggers multiple death and growth arrest pathways to effectively suppress tumor cell growth, suggesting that ROC1 may serve as a potential anticancer target.
RBX1 (RING box protein-1) or ROC1 (regulator of cullins-1) is the RING component of SCF (Skp1, Cullins, F-box proteins) E3 ubiquitin ligases, which regulate diverse cellular processes by targeting various substrates for degradation. However, the in vivo physiological function of RBX1 remains uncharacterized. Here, we show that a gene trap disruption of mouse Rbx1 causes embryonic lethality at embryonic day (E)7.5, mainly due to a failure in proliferation; p27, a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, normally undetectable in the early embryos, accumulates at high levels in the absence of Rbx1. Although mice heterozygous for the Rbx1 gene trap appear viable and fertile without obvious abnormalities, the Rbx1(+/Gt) MEFs do show retarded growth with G1 arrest and p27 accumulation. Simultaneous loss of p27 extended the life span of Rbx1(Gt/Gt) embryos from E6.5 to E9.5, indicating that p27-mediated cell cycle inhibition contributes to the early embryonic lethality in the Rbx1-deficient embryos. Our study demonstrates that the in vivo physiological function of RBX1 is to ensure cell proliferation by preventing p27 accumulation during the early stage of embryonic development.
NEDD8 is a small ubiquitin-like protein that modifies target proteins in a reaction similar to ubiquitination. In this reaction, three enzymes are required and sufficient: NEDD8 activating E1-like enzyme (APP-BP1/Uba3), NEDD8-specific E2 enzyme (Ubc12) and RING-finger protein ROC1 (NEDD8 E3 ligase). Unlike ubiquitin, which is well known to form poly-ubiquitin chain, little is known about the formation of poly-NEDD8 chain. Here we show the mechanism of poly-NEDD8 chain formation on Cullin-1 using a complete in vitro reconstituted NEDD8 conjugation system. Intriguingly, poly-NEDD8 chain was build up on catalytic Cysteine residue of Ubc12. Furthermore, Ubc12 formed poly-NEDD8 chain without the activity of ROC1. Rather ROC1 mutant, defective for ubiquitin ligase activity, dramatically enhanced the poly-NEDD8 chain formation. In turn, ROC1 was essential for the transfer of poly-NEDD8 chain from Ubc12 to Cul-1. These results suggest the important regulatory role of ROC1 for poly-NEDD8 chain formation.
von Hippel-Lindau disease is characterized by a spectrum of hypervascular tumors, including renal cell carcinoma, hemangioblastoma, and pheochromocytoma, which occur with VHL genotype-specific differences in penetrance. VHL loss causes a failure to regulate the hypoxia inducible factors (HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha), resulting in accumulation of both factors to high levels. Although HIF dysregulation is critical to VHL disease-associated renal tumorigenesis, increasing evidence points toward gradations of HIF dysregulation contributing to the degree of predisposition to renal cell carcinoma and other manifestations of the disease.
This investigation examined the ability of disease-specific VHL missense mutations to support the assembly of the VBC complex and to promote the ubiquitylation of HIF. Our interaction analysis supported previous observations that VHL Type 2B mutations disrupt the interaction between pVHL and Elongin C but maintain partial regulation of HIF. We additionally demonstrated that Type 2B mutant pVHL forms a remnant VBC complex containing the active members ROC1 and Cullin-2 which retains the ability to ubiquitylate HIF-1alpha.
Our results suggest that subtypes of VHL mutations support an intermediate level of HIF regulation via a remnant VBC complex. These findings provide a mechanism for the graded HIF dysregulation and genetic predisposition for cancer development in VHL disease.
Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is the principal pathway for counteracting cytotoxic and mutagenic effects of UV irradiation. To provide insight into the in vivo regulation of the DNA damage recognition step of global genome NER (GG-NER), we constructed cell lines expressing fluorescently tagged damaged DNA binding protein 1 (DDB1). DDB1 is a core subunit of a number of cullin 4-RING ubiquitin ligase complexes. UV-activated DDB1-DDB2-CUL4A-ROC1 ubiquitin ligase participates in the initiation of GG-NER and triggers the UV-dependent degradation of its subunit DDB2. We found that DDB1 rapidly accumulates on DNA damage sites. However, its binding to damaged DNA is not static, since DDB1 constantly dissociates from and binds to DNA lesions. DDB2, but not CUL4A, was indispensable for binding of DDB1 to DNA damage sites. The residence time of DDB1 on the damage site is independent of the main damage-recognizing protein of GG-NER, XPC, as well as of UV-induced proteolysis of DDB2. The amount of DDB1 that is temporally immobilized on damaged DNA critically depends on DDB2 levels in the cell. We propose a model in which UV-dependent degradation of DDB2 is important for the release of DDB1 from continuous association to unrepaired DNA and makes DDB1 available for its other DNA damage response functions.
Cullin7 (CUL7) is a molecular scaffold that organizes an E3 ubiquitin ligase containing the F-box protein Fbw8, Skp1 and the ROC1 RING finger protein. Dysregulation of the CUL7 E3 Ligase has been directly linked to hereditary human diseases as cul7 germline mutations were found in patients with autosomal-recessive 3-M and Yakuts short stature syndromes, which are characterized by profound pre- and postnatal growth retardation. In addition, genetic ablation of CUL7 in mice resulted in intrauterine growth retardation and perinatal lethality, underscoring its importance for growth regulation. The recent identification of insulin receptor substrate 1, a critical mediator of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling, as the proteolytic target of the CUL7 E3 ligase, provided a molecular link between CUL7 and a well-established growth regulatory pathway. This result, coupled with other studies demonstrating interactions between CUL7 and the p53 tumor suppressor protein, as well as the simian virus 40 large T antigen oncoprotein, further implicated CUL7 as a novel player in growth control and suggested pathomechanistic insights into CUL7-linked growth retardation syndromes.
Covalent modification of cullins by the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 (neddylation) regulates protein ubiquitination by promoting the assembly of cullin-RING ligase E3 complexes. Like ubiquitination, neddylation results from an enzymatic cascade involving the sequential activity of a dedicated E1 (APPBP1/Uba3), E2 (Ubc12), and an ill-defined E3. We show that SCCRO (also known as DCUN1D1) binds to the components of the neddylation pathway (Cullin-ROC1, Ubc12, and CAND1) and augments but is not required for cullin neddylation in reactions using purified recombinant proteins. We also show that SCCRO recruits Ubc12 approximately NEDD8 to the CAND1-Cul1-ROC1 complex but that this is not sufficient to dissociate or overcome the inhibitory effects of CAND1 on cullin neddylation in purified protein assays. In contrast to findings in cellular systems where no binding is seen, we show that SCCRO and CAND1 can bind to the neddylated Cul1-ROC1 complex in assays using purified recombinant proteins. Although neddylated (not unneddylated) Cul1-ROC1 is released from CAND1 upon incubation with testis lysate from SCCRO+/+ mice, the addition of recombinant SCCRO is required to achieve the same results in lysate from SCCRO(-/-) mice. Combined, these results suggest that SCCRO is an important component of the neddylation E3 complex that functions to recruit charged E2 and is involved in the release of inhibitory effects of CAND1 on cullin-RING ligase E3 complex assembly and activity.
Members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family, including TGF-beta, activin and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), are multifunctional proteins that regulate a wide variety of cellular responses, such as proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis. Alterations in their downstream signaling pathways are associated with a range of human diseases like cancer. TGF-beta family members transduce signals through membrane serine/threonine kinase receptors and intracellular Smad proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, an evolutionarily conserved cascade, tightly regulates TGF-beta family signaling. In this pathway, E3 ubiquitin ligases play a crucial role in the recognition and degradation of target proteins by the 26S proteasomes. Smad degradation regulates TGF-beta family signaling; HECT (homologous to the E6-accessory protein C-terminus)-type E3 ubiquitin ligases, Smad ubiquitin regulatory factor 1 (Smurf1), Smurf2, and a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, ROC1-SCF(Fbw1a) have been implicated in Smad degradation. Smurf1 and Smurf2 bind to TGF-beta family receptors via the inhibitory Smads, Smad6 and Smad7, to induce their ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Arkadia, a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, induces the ubiquitination and degradation of Smad7 and corepressors, c-Ski and SnoN, to enhance TGF-beta family signaling. Abnormalities in E3 ubiquitin ligases that control components of TGF-beta family signaling may lead to the development and progression of various cancers.
The nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a master transcriptional activator of genes encoding numerous cytoprotective enzymes that are induced in response to environmental and endogenously derived oxidative/electrophilic agents. Under normal, nonstressed circumstances, low cellular concentrations of Nrf2 are maintained by proteasomal degradation through a Keap1-Cul3-Roc1-dependent mechanism. A model for Nrf2 activation has been proposed in which two amino-terminal motifs, DLG and ETGE, promote efficient ubiquitination and rapid turnover; known as the two-site substrate recognition/hinge and latch model. Here, we show that in human cancer, somatic mutations occur in the coding region of NRF2, especially among patients with a history of smoking or suffering from squamous cell carcinoma; in the latter case, this leads to poor prognosis. These mutations specifically alter amino acids in the DLG or ETGE motifs, resulting in aberrant cellular accumulation of Nrf2. Mutant Nrf2 cells display constitutive induction of cytoprotective enzymes and drug efflux pumps, which are insensitive to Keap1-mediated regulation. Suppression of Nrf2 protein levels by siRNA knockdown sensitized cancer cells to oxidative stress and chemotherapeutic reagents. Our results strongly support the contention that constitutive Nrf2 activation affords cancer cells with undue protection from their inherently stressed microenvironment and anti-cancer treatments. Hence, inactivation of the Nrf2 pathway may represent a therapeutic strategy to reinforce current treatments for malignancy. Congruously, the present study also provides in vivo validation of the two-site substrate recognition model for Nrf2 activation by the Keap1-Cul3-based E3 ligase.
SCF (Skp1 x CUL1 x F-box protein x ROC1) E3 ubiquitin ligase and Cdc34 E2-conjugating enzyme catalyze polyubiquitination in a precisely regulated fashion. Here, we describe biochemical evidence suggesting an autoinhibitory role played by the human CUL1 ECTD (extreme C-terminal domain; spanning the C-terminal 50 amino acids), a region that is predicted to contact the ROC1 RING finger protein by structural studies. We showed that ECTD did not contribute to CUL1's stable association with ROC1. Remarkably, deletion of ECTD, or missense mutations designed to disrupt the predicted ECTD x ROC1 interaction, markedly increased the ability of SCF(betaTrCP2) to promote IkappaB alpha polyubiquitination and polyubiquitin chain assembly by Cdc34 in vitro. Thus, disruption of ECTD yields in vitro effects that parallel SCF activation by Nedd8 conjugation to CUL1. We propose that SCF may be subject to autoinhibitory regulation, in which Nedd8 conjugation acts as a molecular switch to drive the E3 into an active state by diminishing the inhibitory ECTD x ROC1 interaction.
Poxviruses are notorious for encoding multiple proteins that regulate cellular signaling pathways, including the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Bioinformatics indicated that ectromelia virus, the causative agent of lethal mousepox, encoded four proteins, EVM002, EVM005, EVM154, and EVM165, containing putative F-box domains. In contrast to cellular F-box proteins, the ectromelia virus proteins contain C-terminal F-box domains in conjunction with N-terminal ankyrin repeats, a combination that has not been previously reported for cellular proteins. These observations suggested that the ectromelia virus F-box proteins interact with SCF (Skp1, cullin-1, and F-box) ubiquitin ligases. We focused our studies on EVM005, since this protein had only one ortholog in cowpox virus. Using mass spectrometry, we identified cullin-1 as a binding partner for EVM005, and this interaction was confirmed by overexpression of hemagglutinin (HA)-cullin-1. During infection, Flag-EVM005 and HA-cullin-1 colocalized to distinct cellular bodies. Significantly, EVM005 coprecipitated with endogenous Skp1, cullin-1, and Roc1 and associated with conjugated ubiquitin, suggesting that EVM005 interacted with the components of a functional ubiquitin ligase. Interaction of EVM005 with cullin-1 and Skp1 was abolished upon deletion of the F-box, indicating that the F-box played a crucial role in interaction with the SCF complex. Additionally, EVM002 and EVM154 interacted with Skp1 and conjugated ubiquitin, suggesting that ectromelia virus encodes multiple F-box-containing proteins that regulate the SCF complex. Our results indicate that ectromelia virus has evolved multiple proteins that interact with the SCF complex.
Damaged DNA binding protein 1, DDB1, bridges an estimated 90 or more WD40 repeats (DDB1-binding WD40, or DWD proteins) to the CUL4-ROC1 catalytic core to constitute a potentially large number of E3 ligase complexes. Among these DWD proteins is the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vpr-binding protein VprBP, whose cellular function has yet to be characterized but has recently been found to mediate Vpr-induced G(2) cell cycle arrest. We demonstrate here that VprBP binds stoichiometrically with DDB1 through its WD40 domain and through DDB1 to CUL4A, subunits of the COP9/signalsome, and DDA1. The steady-state level of VprBP remains constant during interphase and decreases during mitosis. VprBP binds to chromatin in a DDB1-independent and cell cycle-dependent manner, increasing from early S through G(2) before decreasing to undetectable levels in mitotic and G(1) cells. Silencing VprBP reduced the rate of DNA replication, blocked cells from progressing through the S phase, and inhibited proliferation. VprBP ablation in mice results in early embryonic lethality. Conditional deletion of the VprBP gene in mouse embryonic fibroblasts results in severely defective progression through S phase and subsequent apoptosis. Our studies identify a previously unknown function of VprBP in S-phase progression and suggest the possibility that HIV-1 Vpr may divert an ongoing chromosomal replication activity to facilitate viral replication.
Recent genetic studies have documented a pivotal growth-regulatory role played by the Cullin 7 (CUL7) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex containing the Fbw8-substrate-targeting subunit, Skp1, and the ROC1 RING finger protein. In this report, we identified insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), a critical mediator of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling, as a proteolytic target of the CUL7 E3 ligase in a manner that depends on mammalian target of rapamycin and the p70 S6 kinase activities. Interestingly, while embryonic fibroblasts of Cul7-/- mice were found to accumulate IRS-1 and exhibit increased activation of IRS-1's downstream Akt and MEK/ERK pathways, these null cells grew poorly and displayed phenotypes reminiscent of those associated with oncogene-induced senescence. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a key role for the CUL7 E3 in targeting IRS-1 for degradation, a process that may contribute to the regulation of cellular senescence.
Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by hamartoma formation in various organs and is caused by mutations targeting either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes. TSC1 and TSC2 proteins form a functionally interdependent dimeric complex. Phosphorylation of either TSC subunit by different kinases regulates the function of TSC and represents a major mechanism to integrate various signals into a centralized cell growth pathway. The majority of disease-associated mutations targeting either TSC1 or TSC2 results in a substantial decrease in protein level, suggesting that protein turnover also plays a critical role in TSC regulation. Here we report that TSC2 protein binds to FBW5, a DDB1-binding WD40 (DWD) protein, and is recruited by FBW5 to the DDB1-CUL4-ROC1 E3 ubiquitin ligase. Overexpression of FBW5 or CUL4A promotes TSC2 protein degradation, and this is abrogated by the coexpression of TSC1. Conversely, depletion of FBW5, DDB1, or CUL4A/B stabilizes TSC2. Ddb1 or Cul4 mutations in Drosophila result in Gigas/TSC2 protein accumulation and cause growth defects that can be partially rescued by Gigas/Tsc2 reduction. These results indicate that FBW5-DDB1-CUL4-ROC1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase regulating TSC2 protein stability and TSC complex turnover.
Inactivation of the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene function has been observed not only in familial schwannomas and other central nervous system tumors, but also in malignant tumors unrelated to the NF2 syndrome, indicating a broader role of NF2 in human tumorigenesis. The NF2-encoded protein Merlin is closely related to the Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin family of membrane/cytoskeleton linker proteins, and has been demonstrated to suppress tumor growth by inhibiting extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Rac1 activation. Interestingly, serum deprivation has been shown to regulate Merlin at the protein level, however, exactly how such condition affects Merlin remains elusive. In this study, we provide evidence to show that Merlin is regulated in a Roc1-Cullin4A-DDB1-dependent manner. Following serum stimulation, Merlin is recruited to the E3 ligase complex through a direct interaction with the WD40-containing adaptor protein VprBP. Loading of Merlin to the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex resulted in its polyubiquitination, and consequently its proteasome-mediated degradation. Consistently, VprBP depletion abolished the in vivo interaction of Merlin and Roc1-Cullin4A-DDB1, which resulted in Merlin stabilization and inhibited ERK and Rac activation. Together, our data revealed a novel regulatory mechanism for the tumor suppressor function of Merlin.
Ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) is involved in the regulation of cell growth and cellular metabolism. The activation of S6K in response to diverse extracellular stimuli is mediated by multiple phosphorylations coordinated by the mTOR and PI3K signaling pathways. We have recently found that both forms of S6K are modified by ubiquitination. Following these findings, we demonstrate here for the first time that S6K1 associates specifically with ubiquitin ligase ROC1 in vitro and in vivo. The interaction was initially identified in the yeast two-hybrid screening and further confirmed by pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Furthermore, the overexpression of ROC1 leads to an increase in S6K1 ubiquitination. Consistent with this observation, we showed that the steady-state level of S6K1 is regulated by ROC1, since downregulation of ROC1 by specific siRNA promotes stabilization of S6K1 protein. The results suggest the involvement of ROC1 in S6K1 ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation.
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise the largest family of cell surface receptors, regulate a wide range of physiological processes, and are the major targets of pharmaceutical drugs. Canonical signaling from GPCRs is relayed to intracellular effector proteins by trimeric G proteins, composed of Œ±, Œ≤, and Œ≥ subunits (GŒ±Œ≤Œ≥). Here, we report that G protein Œ≤ subunits (GŒ≤) bind to DDB1 and that GŒ≤2 targets GRK2 for ubiquitylation by the DDB1-CUL4A-ROC1 ubiquitin ligase. Activation of GPCR results in PKA-mediated phosphorylation of DDB1 at Ser645 and its dissociation from GŒ≤2, leading to increase of GRK2 protein. Deletion of Cul4a results in cardiac hypertrophy in male mice that can be partially rescued by the deletion of one Grk2 allele. These results reveal a non-canonical function of the GŒ≤ protein as a ubiquitin ligase component and a mechanism of feedback regulation of GPCR signaling. 
The use of thalidomide derivatives (IMIDs) has improved multiple myeloma prognosis, through an unknown mechanism of action. Recently one molecular target, the cereblon (CRBN) protein, has been identified. CRBN acts by binding to DDB1-CUL4-ROC1 forming a ubiquitin ligase multiprotein complex. We have generated antibodies to different regions of CRBN protein, and analyzed the biological consequences of augmenting or decreasing CRBN levels. CRBN was expressed in all the myeloma cell lines tested, independently of their sensitivity to IMIDs, and the CRBN-DDB1-CUL4 complex was efficiently formed. At the molecular level, long-term treatment with IMIDs induced a slight decrease in CRBN levels and a reduction in the CRBN-DDB1-CUL4 complex. Interestingly, treatment with other anti-myeloma drugs downregulated cellular contents of CRBN, and in a much faster fashion. These results suggest that CRBN is an important mediator of the cellular response to IMIDs, but also critical in the maintenance of cell viability and/or proliferation. 
Autophagy is an important intracellular catabolic mechanism involved in the removal of misfolded proteins. Atg14L, the mammalian ortholog of Atg14 in yeast and a critical regulator of autophagy, mediates the production PtdIns3P to initiate the formation of autophagosomes. However, it is not clear how Atg14L is regulated. In this study, we demonstrate that ubiquitination and degradation of Atg14L is controlled by ZBTB16-Cullin3-Roc1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Furthermore, we show that a wide range of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) ligands and agonists regulate the levels of Atg14L through ZBTB16. In addition, we show that the activation of autophagy by pharmacological inhibition of GPCR reduces the accumulation of misfolded proteins and protects against behavior dysfunction in a mouse model of Huntington's disease. Our study demonstrates a common molecular mechanism by which the activation of GPCRs leads to the suppression of autophagy and a pharmacological strategy to activate autophagy in the CNS for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. 
Melanomas are highly proliferative and invasive, and are most frequently metastatic. Despite many advances in cancer treatment over the last several decades, the prognosis for patients with advanced melanoma remains poor. New treatment methods and strategies are necessary. The main hallmark of cancer is uncontrolled cellular proliferation with alterations in the expression of proteins. Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-related proteins posttranslationally modify proteins and thereby alter their functions. The ubiquitination process is involved in various physiological responses, including cell growth, cell death, and DNA damage repair. E3 ligases, the most specific enzymes of ubiquitination system, participate in the turnover of many key regulatory proteins and in the development of cancer. E3 ligases are of interest as drug targets for their ability to regulate proteins stability and functions. Compared to the general proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, which blocks the entire protein degradation, drugs that target a particular E3 ligase are expected to have better selectivity with less associated toxicity. Components of different E3 ligases complexes (FBW7, MDM2, RBX1/ROC1, RBX2/ROC2, cullins and many others) are known as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in melanomagenesis. These proteins participate in regulation of different cellular pathways and such important proteins in cancer development as p53 and Notch. In this review we summarized published data on the role of known E3 ligases in the development of melanoma and discuss the inhibitors of E3 ligases as a novel approach for the treatment of malignant melanomas. 
DNA methylation at the C-5 position of cytosine (5mC) regulates gene expression and plays pivotal roles in¬†various biological processes. The TET dioxygenases catalyze iterative oxidation of 5mC, leading to¬†eventual demethylation. Inactivation of TET enzymes causes multistage developmental defects, impaired cell reprogramming, and hematopoietic malignancies. However, little is known about how TET activity is regulated. Here we show that all three TET proteins bind to VprBP and are monoubiquitylated by the VprBP-DDB1-CUL4-ROC1 E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL4(VprBP)) on a highly conserved lysine residue. Deletion of VprBP in oocytes abrogated paternal DNA hydroxymethylation in zygotes. VprBP-mediated monoubiquitylation promotes TET binding to chromatin. Multiple recurrent TET2-inactivating mutations derived from leukemia target either the monoubiquitylation site (K1299) or residues essential for VprBP binding. Cumulatively, our data demonstrate that CRL4(VprBP) is a critical regulator of TET dioxygenases during development and in tumor suppression. 
Inositol polyphosphates containing an energetic pyrophosphate bond are formed primarily by a family of three inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) kinases (IP6K1-3). The Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) regulate diverse biological processes through substrate ubiquitylation. CRL4, comprising the scaffold Cullin 4A/B, the E2-interacting Roc1/2, and the adaptor protein damage-specific DNA-binding protein 1, is activated by DNA damage. Basal CRL4 activity is inhibited by binding to the COP9 signalosome (CSN). UV radiation and other stressors dissociate the complex, leading to E3 ligase activation, but signaling events that trigger signalosome dissociation from CRL4 have been unclear. In the present study, we show that, under basal conditions, IP6K1 forms a ternary complex with CSN and CRL4 in which IP6K1 and CRL4 are inactive. UV dissociates IP6K1 to generate IP7, which then dissociates CSN-CRL4 to activate CRL4. Thus, IP6K1 is a novel CRL4 subunit that transduces UV signals to mediate disassembly of the CRL4-CSN complex, thereby regulating nucleotide excision repair and cell death. 
The activity of cullin-RING type ubiquitination E3 ligases is regulated by neddylation, a process analogous to ubiquitination that culminates in covalent attachment of the ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8 to cullins. As a component of the E3 for neddylation, SCCRO/DCUN1D1 plays a key regulatory role in neddylation and, consequently, cullin-RING ligase activity. The essential contribution of SCCRO to neddylation is to promote nuclear translocation of the cullin-ROC1 complex. The presence of a myristoyl sequence in SCCRO3, one of four SCCRO paralogues present in humans that localizes to the membrane, raises questions about its function in neddylation. We found that although SCCRO3 binds to CAND1, cullins, and ROC1, it does not efficiently bind to Ubc12, promote cullin neddylation, or conform to the reaction processivity paradigms, suggesting that SCCRO3 does not have E3 activity. Expression of SCCRO3 inhibits SCCRO-promoted neddylation by sequestering cullins to the membrane, thereby blocking its nuclear translocation. Moreover, SCCRO3 inhibits SCCRO transforming activity. The inhibitory effects of SCCRO3 on SCCRO-promoted neddylation and transformation require both an intact myristoyl sequence and PONY domain, confirming that membrane localization and binding to cullins are required for in vivo functions. Taken together, our findings suggest that SCCRO3 functions as a tumor suppressor by antagonizing the neddylation activity of SCCRO. 
In the absence of pathogen infection, plant effector-triggered immune (ETI) receptors are maintained in a preactivation state by intermolecular interactions with other host proteins. Pathogen effector-induced alterations activate the receptor. In Arabidopsis, the ETI receptor RPM1 is activated via bacterial effector AvrB-induced phosphorylation of the RPM1-interacting protein RIN4 at Threonine 166. We find that RIN4 also interacts with the prolyl-peptidyl isomerase (PPIase) ROC1, which is reduced upon RIN4 Thr166 phosphorylation. ROC1 suppresses RPM1 immunity in a PPIase-dependent manner. Consistent with this, RIN4 Pro149 undergoes cis/trans isomerization in the presence of ROC1. While the RIN4(P149V) mutation abolishes RPM1 resistance, the deletion of Pro149 leads to RPM1 activation in the absence of RIN4 phosphorylation. These results support a model in which RPM1 directly senses conformational changes in RIN4 surrounding Pro149 that is controlled by ROC1. RIN4 Thr166 phosphorylation indirectly regulates RPM1 resistance by modulating the ROC1-mediated RIN4 isomerization. 
Although it has been suggested that kinesin family member 14 (KIF14) has oncogenic potential in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the molecular mechanism of this potential remains unknown. We aimed to elucidate the role of KIF14 in hepatocarcinogenesis by knocking down KIF14 in HCC cells that overexpressed KIF14. After KIF14 knockdown, changes in tumor cell growth, cell cycle and cytokinesis were examined. We also examined cell cycle regulatory molecules and upstream Skp1/Cul1/F-box (SCF) complex molecules. Knockdown of KIF14 resulted in suppression of cell proliferation and failure of cytokinesis, whereas KIF14 overexpression increased cell proliferation. In KIF14-silenced cells, the levels of cyclins E1, D1 and B1 were profoundly decreased compared with control cells. Of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, the p27(Kip1) protein level specifically increased after KIF14 knockdown. The increase in p27(Kip1) was not due to elevation of its mRNA level, but was due to inhibition of the proteasome-dependent degradation pathway. To explore the pathway upstream of this event, we measured the levels of SCF complex molecules, including Skp1, Skp2, Cul1, Roc1 and Cks1. The levels of Skp2 and its cofactor Cks1 decreased in the KIF14 knockdown cells where p27(Kip1) accumulated. Overexpression of Skp2 in the KIF14 knockdown cells attenuated the failure of cytokinesis. On the basis of these results, we postulate that KIF14 knockdown downregulates the expression of Skp2 and Cks1, which target p27(Kip1) for degradation by the 26S proteasome, leading to accumulation of p27(Kip1). The downregulation of Skp2 and Cks1 also resulted in cytokinesis failure, which may inhibit tumor growth. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that has identified the molecular target and oncogenic effect of KIF14 in HCC. 
Inhibition of protein neddylation, particularly cullin neddylation, has emerged as a promising anticancer strategy, as evidenced by the antitumor activity in preclinical studies of the Nedd8-activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor MLN4924. This small molecule can block the protein neddylation pathway and is now in clinical trials. We and others have previously shown that the antitumor activity of MLN4924 is mediated by its ability to induce apoptosis, autophagy and senescence in a cell context-dependent manner. However, whether MLN4924 has any effect on tumor angiogenesis remains unexplored. Here we report that MLN4924 inhibits angiogenesis in various in vitro and in vivo models, leading to the suppression of tumor growth and metastasis in highly malignant pancreatic cancer, indicating that blockage of angiogenesis is yet another mechanism contributing to its antitumor activity. At the molecular level, MLN4924 inhibits Cullin-RING E3 ligases (CRLs) by cullin deneddylation, causing accumulation of RhoA at an early stage to impair angiogenic activity of vascular endothelial cells and subsequently DNA damage response, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis due to accumulation of other tumor-suppressive substrates of CRLs. Furthermore, we showed that inactivation of CRLs, via small interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing of its essential subunit ROC1/RBX1, recapitulates the antiangiogenic effect of MLN4924. Taken together, our study demonstrates a previously unrecognized role of neddylation in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis using both pharmaceutical and genetic approaches, and provides proof of concept evidence for future development of neddylation inhibitors (such as MLN4924) as a novel class of antiangiogenic agents. 
The promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) protein controls multiple tumour suppressive functions and is downregulated in diverse types of human cancers through incompletely characterized post-translational mechanisms. Here we identify USP11 as a PML regulator by RNAi screening. USP11 deubiquitinates and stabilizes PML, thereby counteracting the functions of PML ubiquitin ligases RNF4 and the KLHL20-Cul3 (Cullin 3)-Roc1 complex. We find that USP11 is transcriptionally repressed through a Notch/Hey1-dependent mechanism, leading to PML destabilization. In human glioma, Hey1 upregulation correlates with USP11 and PML downregulation and with high-grade malignancy. The Notch/Hey1-induced downregulation of USP11 and PML not only confers multiple malignant characteristics of aggressive glioma, including proliferation, invasiveness and tumour growth in an orthotopic mouse model, but also potentiates self-renewal, tumour-forming capacity and therapeutic resistance of patient-derived glioma-initiating cells. Our study uncovers a PML degradation mechanism through Notch/Hey1-induced repression of the PML deubiquitinase USP11 and suggests an important role for this pathway in brain tumour pathogenesis. 
We hypothesized aldosteronoma responsiveness to cosyntropin may be a characterizing feature that could be determined in addition to standard adrenal vein sampling (AVS) data. We reviewed an AVS database from June 2005 to October 2011 including 65 patients with confirmed primary aldosteronism (PA) who underwent AVS and, if applicable, unilateral adrenalectomy. Patients were divided into confirmed lateralized and non-lateralized groups and subgrouped by histology. Plasma aldosterone in inferior vena cava (IVC) pre- and post-cosyntropin infusion during AVS was measured. Peak aldosterone and proportional change was compared between groups. Baseline and peak IVC aldosterone was higher in lateralized patients but incremental aldosterone rise was much greater in subjects with bilateral hyperplasia. From receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analysis, the optimized diagnostic cut point of peak IVC aldosterone of &gt;649‚Äâpmol‚Äâl(-1) would have a sensitivity of 94% for surgical disease although specificity of just 59%. A 250% increase in IVC aldosterone following cosyntropin would be specific enough to exclude 87% of surgical/lateralized disease. These diagnostic capabilities are similar to other results with non-AVS tests performed for diagnosis of lateralization. Although not specific enough to replace standard AVS interpretation, a marked IVC aldosterone increase after cosyntropin during AVS is a useful additional test to diagnose non-lateralizing forms of PA. Such a calculation requires no additional expense or tests.
Replication of plus-stranded RNA viruses is greatly affected by numerous host-encoded proteins that act as restriction factors. Cyclophilins, which are a large family of cellular prolyl isomerases, have been found to inhibit Tomato bushy stunt tombusvirus (TBSV) replication in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae model based on genome-wide screens and global proteomics approaches. In this report, we further characterize single-domain cyclophilins, including the mammalian cyclophilin A and plant Roc1 and Roc2, which are orthologs of the yeast Cpr1p cyclophilin, a known inhibitor of TBSV replication in yeast. We found that recombinant CypA, Roc1, and Roc2 strongly inhibited TBSV replication in a cell-free replication assay. Additional in vitro studies revealed that CypA, Roc1, and Roc2 cyclophilins bound to the viral replication proteins, and CypA and Roc1 also bound to the viral RNA. These interactions led to inhibition of viral RNA recruitment, the assembly of the viral replicase complex, and viral RNA synthesis. A catalytically inactive mutant of CypA was also able to inhibit TBSV replication in vitro due to binding to the replication proteins and the viral RNA. Overexpression of CypA and its mutant in yeast or plant leaves led to inhibition of tombusvirus replication, confirming that CypA is a restriction factor for TBSV. Overall, the current work has revealed a regulatory role for the cytosolic single-domain Cpr1-like cyclophilins in RNA virus replication. 
Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) are the largest family of E3 ligases and require cullin neddylation for their activation. The NEDD8-activating enzyme inhibitor MLN4924 reportedly blocked cullin neddylation and inactivated CRLs, which resulted in apoptosis induction and tumor suppression. However, CRL roles in ovarian cancer cell survival and the ovarian tumor repressing effects of MLN4924 are unknown. We show here that CRL4 components are highly expressed in human epithelial ovarian cancer tissues. MLN4924-induced DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In addition, MLN4924 sensitized ovarian cancer cells to other chemotherapeutic drug treatments. Depletion of CRL4 components Roc1/2, Cul4a, and DDB1 had inhibitory effects on ovarian cancer cells similar to MLN4924 treatment, which suggested that CRL4 inhibition contributed to the chemotherapeutic effect of MLN4924 in ovarian cancers. We also investigated for key CRL4 substrate adaptors required for ovarian cancer cells. Depleting Vprbp/Dcaf1 did not significantly affect ovarian cancer cell growth, even though it was expressed by ovarian cancer tissues. However, depleting Cdt2/Dcaf2 mimicked the pharmacological effects of MLN4924 and caused the accumulation of its substrate, CDT1, both in vitro and in vivo. MLN4924-induced DNA damage and apoptosis were partially rescued by Cdt1 depletion, suggesting that CRL4(CDT2) repression and CDT1 accumulation were key biochemical events contributing to the genotoxic effects of MLN4924 in ovarian cancer cells. Taken together, these results indicate that CRL4(CDT2) is a potential drug target in ovarian cancers and that MLN4924 may be an effective anticancer agent for targeted ovarian cancer therapy. 
Oxidative damage has been associated with various neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Alzheimer's disease, as well as non-neurodegenerative conditions such as cancer and heart disease. The Keap1-Nrf2 system plays a central role in the protection of cells against oxidative and xenobiotic stress. The Nrf2 transcription function and its degradation by the proteasomal pathway (Keap1-Nrf2-Cul3-Roc1 complex) are regulated by the cytoplasmic repressor protein, Keap1 which possesses BTB, BACK (IVR region) and Kelch domains. The BTB-BACK domains are important for Keap1 homo-dimerization as well as to interact with Cullin-3 for Nrf2 degradation. The crystal structure of the Keap1-Kelch domain is known; however, that of the BTB-BACK domains are not yet determined. We present here, through molecular modeling studies, the analysis of Keap1-BTB dimerization, and of BTB-BACK domains role in complex with Cul3. The electrostatic charge distribution at the BTB dimer interface of Keap1 is significantly different from other known BTB containing protein structures. Another intriguing feature is also observed that the non-conserved residues at the BTB-BACK-Cul3 interface region may play critical role for differentiating Cul3 recognition by Keap1 from other adaptor proteins for their specific substrates proteasomal degradation. 
Regulator of Cullins-1 (ROC1) is a key subunit in the Cullin-RING ligase (CRL) protein complex. Overexpression of ROC1 protein is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis of non-muscle invasive bladder transitional cell carcinoma (NMIBC). This study was designed to assess the effects of ROC1 knockdown in bladder cancer cells and to determine the potential mechanisms involved. A total of 112 bladder cancer tissue specimens were recruited for immunohistochemical analyses of ROC1 overexpression. Bladder cancer cell lines were used to knockdown ROC1 expression using ROC1 siRNA. Our data showed that ROC1 knockdown remarkably inhibited bladder cancer cell growth, arrested cells at the G2 phase of the cell cycle, and induced the p53-dependent cell senescence. Molecularly, G2 arrest was associated with upregulation of p21, p27, cyclin B1, and Cdc2 proteins. ROC1 knockdown induced-senescence functioned through p53/p21 pathway. Knockdown of p21 expression partially rescued ROC1 knockdown-induced growth inhibition in cancer cells. Furthermore, nude mouse xenograft analyses confirmed these in vitro data. In conclusion, data from the current study indicate that ROC1 plays an essential role in bladder cancer progression and could serve as a novel anticancer target for bladder transitional cell carcinoma (BTCC).
The Pseudomonas aeruginosa fimbrial structures encoded by the cup gene clusters (cupB and cupC) contribute to its attachment to abiotic surfaces and biofilm formation. The P. aeruginosa pvcABCD gene cluster encodes enzymes that synthesize a novel isonitrile functionalized cumarin, paerucumarin. Paerucumarin has already been characterized chemically, but this is the first report elucidating its role in bacterial biology. We examined the relationship between the pvc operon and the cup gene clusters in the P. aeruginosa strain MPAO1. Mutations within the pvc genes compromised biofilm development and significantly reduced the expression of cupB1-6 and cupC1-3, as well as different genes of the cupB/cupC two-component regulatory systems, roc1/roc2. Adjacent to pvc is the transcriptional regulator ptxR. A ptxR mutation in MPAO1 significantly reduced the expression of the pvc genes, the cupB/cupC genes, and the roc1/roc2 genes. Overexpression of the intact chromosomally-encoded pvc operon by a ptxR plasmid significantly enhanced cupB2, cupC2, rocS1, and rocS2 expression and biofilm development. Exogenously added paerucumarin significantly increased the expression of cupB2, cupC2, rocS1 and rocS2 in the pvcA mutant. Our results suggest that pvc influences P. aeruginosa biofilm development through the cup gene clusters in a pathway that involves paerucumarin, PtxR, and different cup regulators.
Nucleotide excision repair (NER) removes a variety of DNA lesions, including ultraviolet-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. NER comprises two subpathways: transcription-coupled NER (TC-NER) and global genome NER. TC-NER efficiently removes lesions from the transcribed strands of active genes. Mutations in Cockayne syndrome groups A and B genes (CSA and CSB) result in defective TC-NER. In mammalian cells, TC-NER is presumably initiated by the arrest of RNA polymerase II at a lesion on the transcribed strand of an active gene, but the molecular mechanism underlying TC-NER remains unclear. The CSA protein has seven WD40 repeat motifs and beta-propeller architecture. A protein complex consisting of CSA, DDB1, cullin 4A, and Roc1 exhibits ubiquitin ligase activity. The role of CSA protein in TC-NER is described in this review.
The SCF (SKP1 (S-phase-kinase-associated protein 1), Cullin-1, F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligases, the founding member of Cullin-RING ligases (CRLs), are the largest family of E3 ubiquitin ligases in mammals. Each individual SCF E3 ligase consists of one adaptor protein SKP1, one scaffold protein cullin-1 (the first family member of the eight cullins), one F-box protein out of 69 family members, and one out of two RING (Really Interesting New Gene) family proteins RBX1/ROC1 or RBX2/ROC2/SAG/RNF7. Various combinations of these four components construct a large number of SCF E3s that promote the degradation of many key regulatory proteins in cell-context, temporally, and spatially dependent manners, thus controlling precisely numerous important cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, gene transcription, signal transduction, DNA replication, maintenance of genome integrity, and tumorigenesis. To understand how the SCF E3 ligases regulate these cellular processes and embryonic development under in vivo physiological conditions, a number of mouse models with transgenic (Tg) expression or targeted deletion of components of SCF have been established and characterized. In this review, we will provide a brief introduction to the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligases, followed by a comprehensive overview on the existing Tg and knockout (KO) mouse models of the SCF E3s, and discuss the role of each component in mouse embryogenesis, cell proliferation, apoptosis, carcinogenesis, as well as other pathogenic processes associated with human diseases. We will end with a brief discussion on the future directions of this research area and the potential applications of the knowledge gained to more effective therapeutic interventions of human diseases.
Cryptochrome (CRY) is the primary circadian photoreceptor in Drosophila. It resets the circadian clock by promoting light-induced degradation of the clock proteins Timeless and Period, as well as its own proteolysis. The E3 ligases that ubiquitylate Timeless and Period before degradation are known and it is known that Drosophila (d) CRY is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system as well. To identify the E3 ligase for dCRY we screened candidates in S2 cells by RNAi. Knockdown of each of the 25 putative F-box proteins identified by bioinformatics did not attenuate the light-induced degradation of dCRY. However, knockdown of a WD40 protein, Bromodomain and WD repeat domain containing 3 (Brwd3) (CG31132/Ramshackle) caused strong attenuation of dCRY degradation following light exposure. We found that BRWD3 functions as a Damage-specific DNA binding protein 1 (DDB1)- and CULLIN (CUL)4-associated factor in a Cullin4-RING Finger E3 Ligase (CRL4) that mediates light-dependent binding of dCRY to CUL4-ROC1-DDB1-BRWD3, inducing ubiquitylation of dCRY and its light-induced degradation. Thus, this study identifies a light-activated E3 ligase complex essential for light-mediated CRY degradation in Drosophila cells.
Cullin 4B (CUL4B) is a scaffold protein involved in the assembly of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase (E3) complexes. Contemporary reports have identified multiple mutations of CUL4B gene as being causally associated with X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). Identifying the specific protein substrates will help to better understand the physiological functions of CUL4B. The current study identified Jun activation domain-binding protein (Jab1/CSN5) in the COP9 signalosome (CSN) complex as a novel proteolytic target for the CUL4B ubiquitin ligase complex. The impaired degradation of Jab1 was observed in cells after RNAi-mediated CUL4B depletion. Integrity of DDB1-CUL4B-ROC1 was further demonstrated to be indispensable for the degradation of Jab1. In addition, the degradation of Jab1 is independent of CUL4A, a cullin family member closely related to CUL4B. In vitro and in vivo ubiquitination assays revealed that CUL4B promoted the polyubiquitination of Jab1. Interestingly, CUL4B-silenced cells were shown to exhibit abnormal upregulation of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. Furthermore, in vivo studies of embryonic fibroblasts in Cul4b-deficient mice demonstrated Jab1 accumulation and increased activation of the BMP signaling pathway. Together, the current findings demonstrate the CUL4B E3 ubiquitin ligase plays a key role in targeting Jab1 for degradation, potentially revealing a previously undocumented mechanism for regulation of the BMP signaling pathway involved with the CUL4B-based E3 complex. This observation may provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying CUL4B-associated XLID pathogenesis.
Hoxb4, a 3'-located Hox gene, enhances hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) activity, while a subset of 5'-located Hox genes is involved in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis, and some of them are common translocation partners for Nucleoporin 98 (Nup98) in patients with leukemia. Although these Hox gene derivatives are believed to act as transcription regulators, the molecular involvement of the Hox gene derivatives in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis remains largely elusive. Since we previously showed that Hoxb4 forms a complex with a Roc1-Ddb1-Cul4a ubiquitin ligase core component and functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase activator for Geminin, we here examined the E3 ubiquitin ligase activities of the 5'-located Hox genes, Hoxa9 and Hoxc13, and Nup98-Hoxa9. Hoxa9 formed a similar complex with the Roc1-Ddb1-Cul4a component to induce ubiquitination of Geminin, but the others did not. Retroviral transduction-mediated overexpression or siRNA-mediated knock-down of Hoxa9 respectively down-regulated or up-regulated Geminin in hematopoietic cells. And Hoxa9 transduction-induced repopulating and clonogenic activities were suppressed by Geminin supertransduction. These findings suggest that Hoxa9 and Hoxb4 differ from Hoxc13 and Nup98-Hoxa9 in their molecular role in hematopoiesis, and that Hoxa9 induces the activity of HSCs and hematopoietic progenitors at least in part through direct down-regulation of Geminin.
The cullin-RING family of ubiquitin ligases regulates diverse cellular functions, such as cell cycle control, via ubiquitylation of specific substrates. CUL3 targets its substrates through BTB proteins. Here we show that depletion of CUL3 and the BTB protein KLHL18 causes a delay in mitotic entry. Centrosomal activation of Aurora-A, a kinase whose activity is required for entry into mitosis, is also delayed in depleted cells. Moreover, we identify Aurora-A as a KLHL18-interacting partner. Overexpression of KLHL18 and CUL3 promotes Aurora-A ubiquitylation in vivo, and the CUL3-KLHL18-ROC1 ligase ubiquitylates Aurora-A in vitro. Our study reveals that the CUL3-KLHL18 ligase is required for timely entry into mitosis, as well as for the activation of Aurora-A at centrosomes. We propose that the CUL3-KLHL18 ligase regulates mitotic entry through an Aurora-A-dependent pathway.
Polycomb-group (PcG) complex 1 acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase both for histone H2A to silence transcription and for geminin to regulate its stability. Scmh1 is a substoichiometric component of PcG complex 1 that provides the complex with an interaction domain for geminin. Scmh1 is unstable and regulated through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, but its molecular roles are unknown, so we generated Scmh1-deficient mice to elucidate its function. Loss of Scmh1 caused derepression of Hoxb4 and Hoxa9, direct targets of PcG complex 1-mediated transcriptional silencing in hematopoietic cells. Double knockdown of Hoxb4 and Hoxa9 or transduction of a dominant-negative Hoxb4N‚ÜíA mutant caused geminin accumulation. Age-related transcriptional downregulation of derepressed Hoxa9 also leads to geminin accumulation. Transduction of Scmh1 lacking a geminin-binding domain restored derepressed expression of Hoxb4 and Hoxa9 but did not downregulate geminin like full-length Scmh1. Each of Hoxb4 and Hoxa9 can form a complex with Roc1-Ddb1-Cul4a to act as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for geminin. We suggest that geminin dysregulation may be restored by derepressed Hoxb4 and Hoxa9 in Scmh1-deficient mice. These findings suggest that PcG and a subset of Hox genes compose a homeostatic regulatory system for determining expression level of geminin.
Plant architecture is an important agronomic trait and is useful for identification of plant species. The molecular basis of plant architecture, however, is largely unknown. Forward genetics was used to identify an Arabidopsis mutant with altered plant architecture. Using genetic and molecular approaches, we analyzed the roles of a mutated cyclophilin in the control of plant architecture. The Arabidopsis mutant roc1 has reduced stem elongation and increased shoot branching, and the mutant phenotypes are strongly affected by temperature and photoperiod. Map-based cloning and transgenic experiments demonstrated that the roc1 mutant phenotypes are caused by a gain-of-function mutation in a cyclophilin gene, ROC1. Besides, application of the plant hormone gibberellic acid (GA) further suppresses stem elongation in the mutant. GA treatment enhances the accumulation of mutated but not of wildtype (WT) ROC1 proteins. The roc1 mutation does not seem to interfere with GA biosynthesis or signaling. GA signaling, however, antagonizes the effect of the roc1 mutation on stem elongation. The altered plant architecture may result from the activation of an R gene by the roc1 protein. We also present a working model for the interaction between the roc1 mutation and GA signaling in regulating stem elongation.
SAG (Sensitive to Apoptosis Gene) and ROC1 (Regulator of Cullin-1) are two family members of the RING component of CRL (Cullin RING ligase). Both members are essential for growth and survival of several types of human cancer cells; their role in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), however, remains elusive. Here we reported that compared to adjacent normal tissues, both SAG and ROC1 are overexpressed in RCC, which is positively correlated with poor patient survival, particularly for SAG. Depletion of SAG or ROC1 inhibited growth and survival of RCC cells by inducing G2/M arrest, senescence, and apoptosis likely due to accumulation of WEE1, p21, p27, NOXA, and BIM. Interestingly, simultaneous BIM knockdown in RCC cells partially rescues growth suppression triggered by depletion of SAG, but not ROC1, suggesting a differential role of BIM. Collectively, our study provides the proof-of-concept evidence that RING components of CRL are attractive candidates for targeted therapy of RCC.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major health concern worldwide. To prevent HBV-related mortality, elimination of viral proteins is considered the ultimate goal of HBV treatment; however, currently available nucleos(t)ide analogs rarely achieve this goal, as viral transcription from episomal viral covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) is not prevented. HBV regulatory protein X was recently found to target the protein structural maintenance of chromosomes 5/6 (Smc5/6) for ubiquitination and degradation by DDB1-CUL4-ROC1 E3 ligase, resulting in enhanced viral transcription from cccDNA. This ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal pathway requires an additional ubiquitin-like protein for activation, neuronal precursor cell-expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 8 (NEDD8). Here, we show that pevonedistat, a NEDD8-activating enzyme inhibitor, works efficiently as an antiviral agent. Pevonedistat significantly restored Smc5/6 protein levels and suppressed viral transcription and protein production in the HBV minicircle system in in vitro HBV replication models and in human primary hepatocytes infected naturally with HBV. Conclusion: These results indicate that pevonedistat is a promising compound to treat chronic HBV infection.
CereblonÔºàCRBN) is a brain-associated protein with ionic protease activity, which interacts with DNA damage-binding protein-1 (DDB1), Cullin 4 (Cul4A or Cul4B), and regulator of Cullins 1 (RoC1) to form the functional E3 ubiquitin ligase complex(CRBN-CRL4) that performs proteolysis via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. And CRBN is a necessary target protein for the anti-myeloma effect of immunomodulators. The combination of lenalidomide and CRBN recruited a new substrate that binds to the CRBN-CRL4 complex, leading to increased ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation, thus resulting in anti-myeloma activity. The substrates binding to this complex are IKZF1, IKZF3 proteins and GS, etc. The CRBN-dependent degradation of IKZF1 and IKZF3 after lenalidomide treatment is also the result of H2O2-mediated oxidative stress. In addition to ubiquitination, lenalidomide also mediates ubiquitin-independent pathways that prevent CRBN from binding to CD147-MCT1 in a competitive manner to regulate its antitumor activity. Lenalidomide can also play a role in multiple myeloma(MM) cells by modulating miRNA levels and CRBN binding to downstream protein AGO2 expression. Thus, there are many molecular mechanisms of lenalidomide anti-myeloma activity. This review summarizes the molecular mechanisms of CRBN in lenalidomide against myeloma activity in terms of ubiquitin-dependent and ubiquitin-independent pathways.
Skp2 is a member of the F-box family of proteins that serve as substrate-specific adaptors in Skp1-CUL1-ROC1-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligases. Skp2 (Fbxl1) directly binds to the tumor suppressor p27 in the context of the SCFSkp2 E3 ubiquitin ligase to ubiquitylate and target-phosphorylated p27 for proteasomal degradation. As p27 is a powerful suppressor of growth in a variety of cells, and as Skp2 is also overexpressed in many human cancers, Skp2 is considered an oncogene and an intriguing drug target. However, despite 20 years of investigation, a valid chemical inhibitor of Skp2-mediated degradation of p27 has not been identified. Recently, an increasing number of compounds designed to have this bioactivity have been reported. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis of the evidence regarding bioactivity, structure, and medicinal chemistry in order to evaluate and compare these Skp2 inhibitor compounds. Despite chemically diverse compounds with a wide array of Skp2-mediated p27 ubiquitylation inhibition properties reported by several independent groups, no current chemical probe formally qualifies as a validated pharmaceutical hit compound. This finding suggests that our knowledge of the structural biochemistry of the Skp2-p27 complex remains incomplete and highlights the need for novel modes of inquiry.
Regulator of cullins-1 (ROC1) is a pivotal component of cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases, which help to regulate distinct cellular processes by governing the degradation of various substrates. Because the role of ROC1 in gastric cancer is largely uncharacterized, we investigated the relationship between ROC1 expression and the prognosis of gastric cancer patients and explored the biological function of ROC1 and its underlying mechanisms in gastric cancer.
Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate the correlation between the carcinogenesis of gastric cancer and ROC1. SA-Œ≤-gal staining and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) were used to assess ROC1 silencing-induced cellular senescence. A xenograft zebrafish model was used to evaluate the effects of BCL-XL and ROC1 co-silencing on tumor formation in vivo.
High ROC1 expression was correlated with poor prognosis and a low 5-year survival rate of gastric cancer patients. ROC1 depletion significantly inhibited the growth of gastric cancer cells by sequentially inducing p21-mediated cellular senescence and mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis. Functional studies revealed successive upregulation of c-Jun, BCL-XL, and p21 upon ROC1 knockdown. BCL-XL suppression via RNA interference or a BH3 mimetic (ABT-737 or ABT-263) efficiently enhanced the anti-tumor effects of ROC1 knockdown. Equally as important, BCL-XL silencing strengthened ROC1 knockdown-induced apoptosis by blocking p21-mediated senescence.
The c-Jun/BCL-XL/p21 axis promotes senescence to resist ROC1 knockdown-induced apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. Targeted inactivation of BCL-XL could sensitize gastric cancer cells to ROC1 knockdown in clinical practice.
HIV-1 expresses several accessory proteins to counteract host anti-viral restriction factors to facilitate viral replication and disease progression. One such protein, Vpr, has been implicated in affecting multiple cellular processes, but its mechanism remains elusive. Here we report that Vpr targets TET2 for polyubiquitylation by the VprBP-DDB1-CUL4-ROC1 E3 ligase and subsequent degradation. Genetic inactivation or Vpr-mediated degradation of TET2 enhances HIV-1 replication and substantially sustains expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). This process correlates with reduced recruitment of histone deacetylase 1 and 2 to the IL-6 promoter, thus enhancing its histone H3 acetylation level during resolution phase. Blocking IL-6 signaling reduced the ability of Vpr to enhance HIV-1 replication. We conclude that HIV-1 Vpr degrades TET2 to sustain IL-6 expression to enhance viral replication and disease progression. These results suggest that disrupting the Vpr-TET2-IL6 axis may prove clinically beneficial to reduce both viral replication and inflammation during HIV-1 infection.
The E3 ubiquitin ligase HUWE1/Mule/ARF-BP1 plays an important role in diverse biological processes including DNA damage repair and apoptosis. Our previous study has shown that in response to DNA damage HUWE1 was downregulated in CUL4B-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation, and CUL4B-mediated regulation of HUWE1 was important for cell survival upon DNA damage. CUL4B is a core component of the CUL4B Ring ligase complexes containing ROC1, DDB1 and a DDB1-Cullin Associated Factors (DCAFs), the latter of which are DDB1-binding WD40 adaptors critical for substrate recognition and recruitment. However, the identity of DCAF in CRL4B that mediates degradation of HUWE1 remains elusive. Here we report that RBBP7 is the DCAF in the CRL4B complex bridging the DDB1-CUL4B-ROC1 to HUWE1. Loading of HUWE1 to the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex resulted in its polyubiquitination, and consequently its proteasome mediated degradation. Overexpression of RBBP7 promoted HUWE1 protein degradation, while depletion of RBBP7 stabilized HUWE1, and hence accelerated the degradation of MCL-1 and BRCA1, two substrates of HUWE1 that are critical in apoptosis and DNA damage repair. Taken together, these data reveal CRL4BRBBP7 is the E3 ligase responsible for the proteasomal degradation of HUWE1, and further provide a potential strategy for cancer therapy by targeting HUWE1 and the CUL4B E3 ligase complex.
Upon binding to thalidomide and other immunomodulatory drugs, the E3 ligase substrate receptor cereblon (CRBN) promotes proteosomal destruction by engaging the DDB1-CUL4A-Roc1-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase in human cells but not in mouse cells, suggesting that sequence variations in CRBN may cause its inactivation. Therapeutically, CRBN engagers have the potential for broad applications in cancer and immune therapy by specifically reducing protein expression through targeted ubiquitin-mediated degradation. To examine the effects of defined sequence changes on CRBN's activity, we performed a comprehensive study using complementary theoretical, biophysical, and biological assays aimed at understanding CRBN's nonprimate sequence variations. With a series of recombinant thalidomide-binding domain (TBD) proteins, we show that CRBN sequence variants retain their drug-binding properties to both classical immunomodulatory drugs and dBET1, a chemical compound and targeting ligand designed to degrade bromodomain-containing 4 (BRD4) via a CRBN-dependent mechanism. We further show that dBET1 stimulates CRBN's E3 ubiquitin-conjugating function and degrades BRD4 in both mouse and human cells. This insight paves the way for studies of CRBN-dependent proteasome-targeting molecules in nonprimate models and provides a new understanding of CRBN's substrate-recruiting function.
Cullin 4 (CUL4) and small ring finger protein ROC1 assemble to form E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL4) complexes. CUL4 interacts with WD-40 proteins through the adaptor protein DNA damage-binding protein 1 (DDB1) to target substrates for ubiquitylation. Very little is known on how the CUL4 and DDB1 interaction is regulated. Here, we show that DDB1 is acetylated and acetylation promotes DDB1 binding to CUL4. We also identify nucleolar sirtuin 7 (SIRT7) as a major deacetylase that negatively regulates DDB1-CUL4 interaction. Following inhibition of nucleolar function by actinomycin D or 5-fluorouracil treatment or knocking down the gene for the RNA polymerase I component UBF, SIRT7 is mobilized from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm and promotes DDB1 deacetylation, leading to decreased DDB1-CUL4 association and CRL4 activity. This results in the accumulation or activation of CRL4 substrates including LATS1 and p73, which contribute to cell apoptosis induced by actinomycin D and 5-fluorouracil. Our study uncovers a novel regulation of CRL4 E3 ligase complexes.
A subset of WD40 proteins with DWD motif has been proposed to serve as substrate receptor of DDB-CUL4-ROC1 complex, thereby getting involved in protein degradation via ubiquitination pathway. Here, we identified a total of 161 potential DWD proteins in soybean (Glycine max) by searching DWD motif against the genome-wide WD40 repeats, and classified them into 20 groups on the basis of their functional domains and annotations. These putative DWD genes in soybean displayed tissue-specific expression patterns, and their genome localization and analysis of evolutionary relationship identified 48 duplicated gene pairs within 161 GmDWDs. Among the 161 soybean DWD proteins, Gm08DWD was previously found to interact with an isoflavonoid regulator, GmMYB176. Therefore, Gm08DWD and its homologue Gm05DWD were further investigated. Expression profile of both genes in different soybean tissues revealed that Gm08DWD was expressed higher in embryo, while Gm05DWD exhibited maximum transcript accumulation in leaf. Our protein-protein interaction studies demonstrated that Gm08DWD interacts with GmMYB176. Although Gm08DWD was localized both in nucleus and cytoplasm, the resulting complex of Gm08DWD and GmMYB176 was mainly observed in the nucleus. This finding is consistent with the functional localization of CUL4-E3 ligase complex. In conclusion, the survey on soybean potential DWD protein is useful reference for the further functional investigation of their DDB1-binding ability. Based on the functional investigation of Gm08DWD, we speculate that protein-protein interaction between Gm08DWD and GmMYB176 may lead to the degradation of GmMYB176 through CUL4-DDB1complex.
Recent reports showed that regulator of Cullins-1 (ROC1) play an important role in tumor progression in a tumor-specific manner. However, the role and mechanism of ROC1 in esophageal cancer remains elusive. Here we demonstrated that ROC1 was overexpressed in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, which was positive associated with poor prognosis of esophageal cancer patients. ROC1 knockdown significantly inhibited the growth of esophageal cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, ROC1 silencing induced G2 cell cycle arrest and triggered apoptosis by accumulating the pro-apoptotic protein NOXA. Consistently, the downregulation of NOXA expression via siRNA substantially attenuated apoptosis induced by ROC1 silencing. These findings suggest that ROC1 is an appealing drug target for esophageal cancer.
Ring box protein-1 (RBX1), also called Regulator of Cullins-1 (ROC1), is a key component of SCF (Skp-1, cullins, F-box proteins) E3 ubiquitin ligases, which regulate diverse cellular processes by targeting protein substrates for degradation. Although RBX1 plays an important role in ubiquitination machinery of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, studies on the RBX1 have not been involved in the unicellular green alga Dunaliella salina. In this study, a full-length RBX1 cDNA fragment of 817¬†bp was cloned using rapid amplification of cDNA end (RACE) technique. The full-length sequence contained an open reading frame of 411¬†bp encoding 136 amino acids. The predicted protein had a molecular molar mass of 14.8¬†kDa and pI of 5.9 with a high degree of homology to RBX1 from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (92¬†%). Recombinant RBX1 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and was purified and characterized. The apparent molecular mass of the recombinant protein was approximately 17¬†kDa, and the optimal induction time and concentration were 3¬†h and 0.1¬†mmol/L IPTG, respectively. The predicted 3D structures of RBX1 proteins contained RING-H2 finger domain including "Cys59-X2-Cys62-X30-Cys93-X1-His95-X2-His98-X2-Cys101-X10-Cys112-X2-Cys115." The expression of RBX1 protein was increased by 132¬†% during flagellar disassembly and decreased by 76¬†% during flagellar assembly of D. salina. The expression of RBX1 mRNA had a similar tendency with the expression of RBX1 protein. The results indicated that RBX1 responded to flagellar disassembly of D. salina.
The hepatitis B virus (HBV) regulatory protein X (HBx) activates gene expression from the HBV covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) genome. Interaction of HBx with the DDB1-CUL4-ROC1 (CRL4) E3 ligase is critical for this function. Using substrate-trapping proteomics, we identified the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) complex proteins SMC5 and SMC6 as CRL4(HBx) substrates. HBx expression and HBV infection degraded the SMC5/6 complex in human hepatocytes in¬†vitro and in humanized mice in¬†vivo. HBx targets SMC5/6 for ubiquitylation by the CRL4(HBx) E3 ligase and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. Using a minicircle HBV (mcHBV) reporter system with HBx-dependent activity, we demonstrate that SMC5/6 knockdown, or inhibition with a dominant-negative SMC6, enhance HBx null¬†mcHBV-Gluc gene expression. Furthermore, SMC5/6 knockdown rescued HBx-deficient HBV replication in human hepatocytes. These results indicate that a¬†primary function of HBx is to degrade SMC5/6, which restricts HBV replication by inhibiting HBV gene expression.
Population-based and case-control studies in different ethnicities have linked a polymorphism, C825T, in exon 10 of GNB3 gene to hypertension and several additional diseases. The 825T allele is associated with alternative splicing and results in a shortened GŒ≤3 protein, referred to as GŒ≤3s, which loses 41 amino acids encompassing one WD40 repeat domain. The mechanism of how GŒ≤3 C825T polymorphism is associated with hypertension has remained unclear, but an impairment of its canonical function in G-protein-coupled receptor signaling has been ruled out. Here, we report that GŒ≤3, like other GŒ≤ proteins, binds to DDB1 and assembles a DDB1-CUL4A-ROC1 E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL4A(GŒ≤3)) to target GRK2 ubiquitination. The loss of the 41 amino-acid residues disrupts the GŒ≤3-DDB1 binding and impairs the function of GŒ≤3s to ubiquitinate GRK2. GRK2 ubiquitination levels were decreased and protein levels were accumulated in the blood samples of GŒ≤3 825T allele carriers. Deletion of Cul4a in mice resulted in systolic pressure increased and weakened heart function in male mice that can be partially rescued by the deletion of one Grk2 allele. These results reveal a mechanism explaining the link between GŒ≤3 C825T polymorphism and hypertension. 
G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are responsible for regulating a wide variety of physiological processes, and distinct mechanisms for GPCR inactivation exist to guarantee correct receptor functionality. One of the widely used mechanisms is receptor phosphorylation by specific G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), leading to uncoupling from G proteins (desensitization) and receptor internalization. GRKs and Œ≤-arrestins also participate in the assembly of receptor-associated multimolecular complexes, thus initiating alternative G-protein-independent signaling events. In addition, the abundant GRK2 kinase has diverse "effector" functions in cellular migration, proliferation, and metabolism homeostasis by means of the phosphorylation or interaction with non-GPCR partners. Altered expression of GRKs (particularly of GRK2 and GRK5) occurs during pathological conditions characterized by impaired GPCR signaling including inflammatory syndromes, cardiovascular disease, and tumor contexts. It is increasingly appreciated that different pathways governing GRK protein stability play a role in the modulation of kinase levels in normal and pathological conditions. Thus, enhanced GRK2 degradation by the proteasome pathway occurs upon GPCR stimulation, what allows cellular adaptation to chronic stimulation in a physiological setting. Œ≤-arrestins participate in this process by facilitating GRK2 phosphorylation by different kinases and by recruiting diverse E3 ubiquitin ligase to the receptor complex. Different proteolytic systems (ubiquitin-proteasome, calpains), chaperone activities and signaling pathways influence the stability of GRKs in different ways, thus endowing specificity to GPCR regulation as protein turnover of GRKs can be differentially affected. Therefore, modulation of protein stability of GRKs emerges as a versatile mechanism for feedback regulation of GPCR signaling and basic cellular processes.
UV-induced DNA damage, a major risk factor for skin cancers, is primarily repaired by nucleotide excision repair (NER). UV radiation resistance-associated gene (UVRAG) is a tumor suppressor involved in autophagy. It was initially isolated as a cDNA partially complementing UV sensitivity in xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), but this was not explored further. Here we show that UVRAG plays an integral role in UV-induced DNA damage repair. It localizes to photolesions and associates with DDB1 to promote the assembly and activity of the DDB2-DDB1-Cul4A-Roc1 (CRL4(DDB2)) ubiquitin ligase complex, leading to efficient XPC recruitment and global genomic NER. UVRAG depletion decreased substrate handover to¬†XPC and conferred UV-damage hypersensitivity. We confirmed the importance of UVRAG for UV-damage tolerance using a Drosophila model. Furthermore, increased UV-signature mutations in melanoma correlate with reduced expression of UVRAG. Our results identify UVRAG as a regulator of CRL4(DDB2)-mediated NER and suggest that its expression levels may influence melanoma predisposition.
WDTC1/Adp encodes an evolutionarily conserved suppressor of lipid accumulation. While reduced WDTC1 expression is associated with obesity in mice and humans, its cellular function is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that WDTC1 is a component of a DDB1-CUL4-ROC1 (CRL4) E3 ligase. Using 3T3-L1 cell culture model of adipogenesis, we show that disrupting the interaction between WDTC1 and DDB1 leads to a loss of adipogenic suppression by WDTC1, increased triglyceride accumulation and adipogenic gene expression. We show that the CRL4(WDTC) (1) complex promotes histone H2AK119 monoubiquitylation, thus suggesting a role for this complex in transcriptional repression during adipogenesis. Our results identify a biochemical role for WDTC1 and extend the functional range of the CRL4 complex to the suppression of fat accumulation.
Abiotic stress, including salinity, drought and cold, severely affect diverse aspects of plant development and production. Rice is an important crop that does not acclimate to cold; therefore, it is relatively sensitive to low temperature stress. Dehydration-responsive element-binding protein 1s (DREB1s)/C-repeat binding factors (CBFs) are well known for their function in cold tolerance, but the transcriptional regulation of CBFs remains elusive, especially in rice. Here, we performed a yeast one-hybrid assay using the promoter of CBF1, a cold-induced gene, to isolate transcriptional regulators of CBF1. Among the seven candidates identified, an indeterminate domain (IDD) protein named ROC1 (a regulator of CBF1) was further analyzed. The ROC1 transcript was induced by exogenously-treated auxin, while it was not altered by cold or ABA stimuli. ROC1-GFP was localized at the nucleus, and ROC1 showed trans-activation activity in yeast. The electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and ChIP analyses revealed that ROC1 directly bound to the promoter of CBF1. Furthermore, ROC1 mutants exhibited chilling-sensitive symptoms and inhibited cold-mediated induction of CBF1 and CBF3, indicating that ROC1 is a positive regulator of cold stress responses. Taken together, this study identified the CBF1 regulator, and the results are important for rice plant adaptation to chilling stress. 
The formation of body axes is the basis of morphogenesis during plant embryogenesis. We identified embryo-lethal mutants of rice (Oryza sativa) in which T-DNAs were inserted in OsMPK6 Embryonic organs were absent because their development was arrested at the globular stage. Similar to observations made with gle4, shootless, and organless, the osmpk6 mutations affected the initial step of cell differentiation. Expression of an apical-basal axis marker gene, OSH1, was reduced in the mutant embryos while that of the radial axes marker genes OsSCR and OsPNH1 was not detected. The signal for ROC1, a protodermal cell marker, was weak at the globular stage and gradually disappeared. Transcript levels of auxin and gibberellin biosynthesis genes were diminished in osmpk6 embryos. In addition, phytoalexin biosynthesis genes were down-regulated in osmpk6 and a major diterpene phytoalexin, momilactone A, did not accumulate in the mutant embryos. These results indicate that OsMPK6 begins to play a critical role during early embryogenesis, especially when the L1 radial axis is being formed.
Regulator of cullins-1 (ROC1) is a key subunit in the cullin-RING ligase (CRL) protein complex. Our previous study indicated that ROC1 was essential for bladder cancer cell survival and that ROC1 knockdown inhibited CRL activity, triggering G2 phase arrest and senescence. However, the role of ROC1 in the malignant progression of bladder cancer remained unknown.
ROC1 expression in cancer cells was knocked down by siRNA silencing. The effects of ROC1 silencing were evaluated by in vitro assays for cell migration and by an in vivo mouse metastasis model. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induction was evaluated by immunofluorescence staining and western blotting of EMT-associated proteins. ROC1 expression in human tumours was further evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis.
ROC1 knockdown suppresses bladder cancer cell migration by inhibiting EMT. ROC1 knockdown inhibited EMT by inhibiting mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity via the accumulation of the mTOR-inhibitory protein DEPTOR, a CRL substrate. DEPTOR knockdown partially rescued ROC1 knockdown-inhibited EMT and the ROC1-induced inhibition of cancer cell migration. Furthermore, in vivo studies using a nude mouse metastasis model confirmed the in vitro data. Finally, tissue microarray analysis of clinical bladder cancer specimens indicated a positive correlation between ROC1 expression and EMT.
ROC1 has an important role in the malignant progression of bladder cancer via the mTOR/DEPTOR pathway. ROC1 may serve as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of muscle-invasive transitional cell carcinoma.
The Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS) is a core regulator with various protein components (ubiquitin-activating E1 enzymes, ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzymes, ubiquitin-protein E3 ligases, and the 26S proteasome) which work together in a coordinated fashion to ensure the appropriate and efficient proteolysis of target substrates. E3 ubiquitin ligases are essential components of the UPS machinery, working with E1 and E2 enzymes to bind substrates and assist the transport of ubiquitin molecules onto the target protein. As the UPS controls the degradation of several oncogenes and tumor suppressors, dysregulation of this pathway leads to several human malignancies. A major category of E3 Ub ligases, the SCF (Skp-Cullin-F-box) complex, is composed of four principal components: Skp1, Cul1/Cdc53, Roc1/Rbx1/Hrt1, and an F-box protein (FBP). FBPs are the substrate recognition components of SCF complexes and function as adaptors that bring substrates into physical proximity with the rest of the SCF. Besides acting as a component of SCF complexes, FBPs are involved in DNA replication, transcription, cell differentiation and cell death. This review will highlight the recent literature on three well characterized FBPs SKP2, Fbw7, and beta-TRCP. In particular, we will focus on the involvement of these deregulated FBPs in the progression and development of various human cancers. We will also highlight some novel substrates recently identified for these FBPs. 
Protein remote homology detection is one of the fundamental problems in computational biology, aiming to find protein sequences in a database of known structures that are evolutionarily related to a given query protein. Some computational methods treat this problem as a ranking problem and achieve the state-of-the-art performance, such as PSI-BLAST, HHblits and ProtEmbed. This raises the possibility to combine these methods to improve the predictive performance. In this regard, we are to propose a new computational method called ProtDec-LTR for protein remote homology detection, which is able to combine various ranking methods in a supervised manner via using the Learning to Rank (LTR) algorithm derived from natural language processing.
Experimental results on a widely used benchmark dataset showed that ProtDec-LTR can achieve an ROC1 score of 0.8442 and an ROC50 score of 0.9023 outperforming all the individual predictors and some state-of-the-art methods. These results indicate that it is correct to treat protein remote homology detection as a ranking problem, and predictive performance improvement can be achieved by combining different ranking approaches in a supervised manner via using LTR.

B cell development past the pro-B cell stage in mice requires the Cul4-Roc1-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase substrate recognition subunit VprBP. Enforced Bcl2 expression overcomes defects in distal VH-DJH and secondary VŒ∫-JŒ∫ rearrangement associated with VprBP insufficiency in B cells and substantially rescues maturation of marginal zone and IgŒª(+) B cells, but not IgŒ∫(+) B cells. In this background, expression of a site-directed IgŒ∫ L chain transgene increases IgŒ∫(+) B cell frequency, suggesting VprBP does not regulate L chain expression from a productively rearranged Igk allele. In site-directed anti-dsDNA H chain transgenic mice, loss of VprBP function in B cells impairs selection of IgŒ∫ editor L chains typically arising through secondary Igk rearrangement, but not selection of IgŒª editor L chains. Both H and L chain site-directed transgenic mice show increased B cell anergy when VprBP is inactivated in B cells. Taken together, these data argue that VprBP is required for the efficient receptor editing and selection of IgŒ∫(+) B cells, but is largely dispensable for IgŒª(+) B cell development and selection, and that VprBP is necessary to rescue autoreactive B cells from anergy induction. 
Human CRBN (cereblon) gene is located on chromosome 3 at 3p26 and its encoding protein is a member of E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (composed of CRBN, DDB1, CUL4A and ROC1). The E3 ubiquitin ligase complex functions in the ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation pathway and attaches polyubiquitin chains to substrate proteins for degradation via the protease complex. Currently, there are no standardized assays for CRBN gene and protein measurement although quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), immunohistochemistry and Western blot are widely used. CRBN has been identified as a direct target for immunomodulatory drugs (IMiD) and plays a significant role in anti-proliferation, pro-apoptotic effects, anti-angiogenic activities, immunomodulatory activities and intervention of cell surface adhesion molecules between myeloma cells and bone marrow stromal cells. Recently, clinical data show that majority of the multiple myeloma patients treated with IMiD develop drug-resistance over time by unknown mechanisms. Fortunately, various in vivo and in vitro studies have revealed that the decreased CRBN expression or CRBN deletion is associated with resistance to IMiD in treating multiple myeloma, and CRBN expression levels may have a prognostic significance. Furthermore, the most recently discovered protein IKZF1, IKZF3, IRF4, C/EBPŒ≤ and Wnt/catenin signaling pathways may also be closely related to IMiD resistance in myeloma.
Although every organism shares some common features of replication, this process varies greatly among eukaryotic species. Current data show that mathematical models of the organization of origins based on possibility theory may be applied (and remain accurate) in every model organism i.e. from yeast to humans. The major differences lie within the dynamics of origin firing and the regulation mechanisms that have evolved to meet new challenges throughout the evolution of the organism. This article elaborates on the relations between chromatin structure, organization of origins, their firing times and the impact that these features can have on genome stability, showing both differences and parallels inside the eukaryotic domain. 
The RGK family of small G-proteins, including Rad, Gem, Rem1, and Rem2, is inducibly expressed in various mammalian tissues and interacts with voltage-dependent calcium channels and Rho kinase. Many questions remain regarding their physiological roles and molecular mechanism. Previous crystallographic studies reported RGK G-domain:guanosine di-phosphate structures. To test whether RGK proteins undergo a nucleotide-induced conformational change, we determined the crystallographic structures of Rad:GppNHp and Rem2:GppNHp to 1.7 and 1.8¬†√Ö resolutions, respectively. Also, we characterized the nucleotide-binding properties and conformations for Gem, Rad, and several structure-based mutants using fluorescence spectroscopy. The results suggest that RGK G-proteins may not behave as Ras-like canonical nucleotide-induced molecular switches. Further, the RGK proteins have differing structures and nucleotide-binding properties, which may have implications for their varied action on effectors.
Rit (Ras-like expressed in many tissues) is the founding member of a novel subgroup within the larger Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins. Although Rit shares more than 50% amino acid identity with Ras, it contains a unique effector domain in common with the closely related Rin and Drosophila Ric proteins and lacks the C-terminal lipidation motifs critical for the membrane association and biological activity of many Ras proteins. Interestingly, whereas Rit has only modest transforming ability when assayed in NIH 3T3 cells, Rit exhibits neuronal differentiation activities comparable to those of oncogenic mutants of Ras when assayed in PC12 and other neuronal cell lines. This cell-type specificity is explained in part by the ability of Rit to selectively activate the neuronal Raf isoform, B-Raf. Importantly, Rit seems to play a critical role in neurotrophin-mediated MAP kinase signaling, because Rit gene silencing significantly alters NGF-dependent MAP kinase signaling and neuronal differentiation. In this chapter, we discuss the reagents and methods used to characterize Rit-mediated signaling to MAP kinase-signaling pathways to determine the extracellular stimuli that regulate Rit activation and to characterize Rit-induced neuronal differentiation.
GTPases of the Rho family are molecular switches that play important roles in converting and amplifying external signals into cellular effects. Originally demonstrated to control the dynamics of the F-actin cytoskeleton, Rho GTPases have been implicated in many basic cellular processes that influence cell proliferation, differentiation, motility, adhesion, survival, or secretion. To elucidate the evolutionary history of the Rho family, we have analyzed over 20 species covering major eukaryotic clades from unicellular organisms to mammals, including platypus and opossum, and have reconstructed the ontogeny and the chronology of emergence of the different subfamilies. Our data establish that the 20 mammalian Rho members are structured into 8 subfamilies, among which Rac is the founder of the whole family. Rho, Cdc42, RhoUV, and RhoBTB subfamilies appeared before Coelomates and RhoJQ, Cdc42 isoforms, RhoDF, and Rnd emerged in chordates. In vertebrates, gene duplications and retrotranspositions increased the size of each chordate Rho subfamily, whereas RhoH, the last subfamily, arose probably by horizontal gene transfer. Rac1b, a Rac1 isoform generated by alternative splicing, emerged in amniotes, and RhoD, only in therians. Analysis of Rho mRNA expression patterns in mouse tissues shows that recent subfamilies have tissue-specific and low-level expression that supports their implication only in narrow time windows or in differentiated metabolic functions. These findings give a comprehensive view of the evolutionary canvas of the Rho family and provide guides for future structure and evolution studies of other components of Rho signaling pathways, in particular regulators of the RhoGEF family.
The mitogenic pathway, composed of RAF kinases, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MEK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), promotes cell proliferation and migration and is upregulated in many tumours. DiRas3 (ARHI, Noey2), a mainly GTP-bound Ras-like protein with an unusual N-terminal extension, is predominantly lost in ovarian and breast cancers. Its re-expression in these tissues impairs cell proliferation, autophagy, apoptosis and cell migration. Further, loss of DiRas3 correlates with an increase in growth factor-induced ERK phosphorylation. Therefore, DIRAS3 proves to be a curious gene with remarkable tumour suppressing capabilities. However, how DiRas3 interferes with ERK phosphorylation, has remained unknown.
We demonstrate that DiRas3 associates in vivo with C-RAF and directly binds in vitro to C-RAF, which is upstream of MEK and ERK. Direct binding of DiRas3 to C-RAF is nucleotide independent, and DiRas3's N-terminal extension alone is not sufficient for binding C-RAF. DiRas3 expression inhibits the activating phosphorylations of MEK and ERK. Serum-induced recruitment of DiRas3 to the plasma membrane depends mainly on its N-terminal extension and less on its C-terminus, bound nucleotide or the presence of Ras-GTP. Correspondingly, removal of the N-terminal extension strongly decreases DiRas3's inhibition of MEK and ERK phosphorylations. Tyrosyl-phosphatases do not contribute significantly to reduction of ERK-phosphorylation byDiRas3. Consistently, downregulation of DiRas3 results in a small but significant and persistent increase in MEK and ERK phosphorylation, but does not increase phosphorylation of P38, AKT and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase. Finally, downregulation of DiRas3 causes increased cell migration, through a mechanism that is MEK dependent.
These results support a model in which serum signals induce the recruitment of DiRas3 to the plasma membrane, where it is tethered via its N- and C-termini. At the plasma membrane, DiRas3 interacts with C-RAF to specifically suppress the activating phosphorylations on MEK and ERK, thus restricting migration of non-cancer cells. This effect is relatively small, but it is also persistent, suggesting that it contributes to the maintenance of the non-migratory phenotype of non-cancerous tissues, in which DiRas3 is expressed.
RAS-like protein expressed in many tissues 1 (RIT1) is a disease-associated RAS subfamily small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase). Recent studies revealed that germ-line and somatic RIT1 mutations can cause Noonan syndrome (NS), and drive proliferation of lung adenocarcinomas, respectively, akin to RAS mutations in these diseases. However, the locations of these RIT1 mutations differ significantly from those found in RAS, and do not affect the three mutational "hot spots" of RAS. Moreover, few studies have characterized the GTPase cycle of RIT1 and its disease-associated mutants. Here we developed a real-time NMR-based GTPase assay for RIT1 and investigated the effect of disease-associated mutations on GTPase cycle. RIT1 exhibits an intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate similar to that of H-RAS, but its intrinsic nucleotide exchange rate is ‚àº4-fold faster, likely as a result of divergent residues near the nucleotide binding site. All of the disease-associated mutations investigated increased the GTP-loaded, activated state of RIT1 in vitro, but they could be classified into two groups with different intrinsic GTPase properties. The S35T, A57G, and Y89H mutants exhibited more rapid nucleotide exchange, whereas F82V and T83P impaired GTP hydrolysis. A RAS-binding domain pulldown assay indicated that RIT1 A57G and Y89H were highly activated in HEK293T cells, whereas T83P and F82V exhibited more modest activation. All five mutations are associated with NS, whereas two (A57G and F82V) have also been identified in urinary tract cancers and myeloid malignancies. Characterization of the effects on the GTPase cycle of RIT1 disease-associated mutations should enable better understanding of their role in disease processes.
Noonan syndrome (NS) is a relatively common genetic disorder, characterized by typical facies, short stature, developmental delay, and cardiac abnormalities. Known causative genes account for 70-80% of clinically diagnosed NS patients, but the genetic basis for the remaining 20-30% of cases is unknown. We performed next-generation sequencing on germ-line DNA from 27 NS patients lacking a mutation in the known NS genes. We identified gain-of-function alleles in Ras-like without CAAX 1 (RIT1) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MAP2K1) and previously unseen loss-of-function variants in RAS p21 protein activator 2 (RASA2) that are likely to cause NS in these patients. Expression of the mutant RASA2, MAP2K1, or RIT1 alleles in heterologous cells increased RAS-ERK pathway activation, supporting a causative role in NS pathogenesis. Two patients had more than one disease-associated variant. Moreover, the diagnosis of an individual initially thought to have NS was revised to neurofibromatosis type 1 based on an NF1 nonsense mutation detected in this patient. Another patient harbored a missense mutation in NF1 that resulted in decreased protein stability and impaired ability to suppress RAS-ERK activation; however, this patient continues to exhibit a NS-like phenotype. In addition, a nonsense mutation in RPS6KA3 was found in one patient initially diagnosed with NS whose diagnosis was later revised to Coffin-Lowry syndrome. Finally, we identified other potential candidates for new NS genes, as well as potential carrier alleles for unrelated syndromes. Taken together, our data suggest that next-generation sequencing can provide a useful adjunct to RASopathy diagnosis and emphasize that the standard clinical categories for RASopathies might not be adequate to describe all patients. 
Ras-like without CAAX 2 (RIT2), a member of the Ras superfamily of small guanosine triphosphatases, is involved in regulating neuronal function. RIT2 is a unique member of the Ras family in that RIT2 is preferentially expressed in various neurons, including retinal neurons. The mechanisms that regulate RIT2 expression in neurons were studied.
Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), immunohistochemistry, western blotting, bioinformatic prediction, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), and cell transfection methods were used.
With immunohistochemistry of the mouse retina, RIT2 protein was detected in the ganglion cell layer (GCL), inner plexiform layer, inner nuclear layer, and outer plexiform layer, with the strongest staining in the GCL and the inner plexiform layer. RT-qPCR combined with laser capture microdissection detected Rit2 messenger RNA in the GCL and the inner nuclear layer. Western blot analysis showed a large increase in the RIT2 protein in the retina during maturation from newborn to adult. Transient transfection identified the 1.3 kb upstream region of human RIT2 as capable of driving expression in neuronal cell lines. Based on the known expression pattern and biological activity, we hypothesized that POU4 family factors might modulate RIT2 expression in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Bioinformatic analyses predicted six POU4 factor-binding sites within the 1.3 kb human RIT2 promoter region. EMSA analyses showed binding of POU4 proteins to three of the six predicted sites. Cotransfection with expression vectors demonstrated that POU4 proteins can indeed modulate the human RIT2 promoter, and that ISL1, a LIM homeodomain factor, can further modulate the activity of the POU4 factors.
These studies confirm the expression of RIT2 in retinal neuronal cells, including RGCs, begin to reveal the mechanisms responsible for neuronal expression of RIT2, and suggest a role for the POU4 family factors in modulating RIT2 expression in RGCs.
The Ras-like small GTPases RalA and RalB are well validated effectors of RAS oncogene-driven human cancer growth, and pharmacologic inhibitors of Ral function may provide an effective anti-Ras therapeutic strategy. Intriguingly, although RalA and RalB share strong overall amino acid sequence identity, exhibit essentially identical structural and biochemical properties, and can utilize the same downstream effectors, they also exhibit divergent and sometimes opposing roles in the tumorigenic and metastatic growth of different cancer types. These distinct biological functions have been attributed largely to sequence divergence in their carboxyl-terminal hypervariable regions. However, the role of posttranslational modifications signaled by the hypervariable region carboxyl-terminal tetrapeptide CAAX motif (C = cysteine, A = aliphatic amino acid, X = terminal residue) in Ral isoform-selective functions has not been addressed. We determined that these modifications have distinct roles and consequences. Both RalA and RalB require Ras converting CAAX endopeptidase 1 (RCE1) for association with the plasma membrane, albeit not with endomembranes, and loss of RCE1 caused mislocalization as well as sustained activation of both RalA and RalB. In contrast, isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase (ICMT) deficiency disrupted plasma membrane localization only of RalB, whereas RalA depended on ICMT for efficient endosomal localization. Furthermore, the absence of ICMT increased stability of RalB but not RalA protein. Finally, palmitoylation was critical for subcellular localization of RalB but not RalA. In summary, we have identified striking isoform-specific consequences of distinct CAAX-signaled posttranslational modifications that contribute to the divergent subcellular localization and activity of RalA and RalB. 
Protein geranylgeranyltransferase type I (PGGT-I) and protein farnesyltransferase (PFT) occur in many eukaryotic cells. Both consist of two subunits, the common alpha subunit and a distinct beta subunit. In the gene database of protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas' disease, a putative protein that consists of 401 amino acids with approximately 20% amino acid sequence identity to the PGGT-I beta of other species was identified, cloned, and characterized. Multiple sequence alignments show that the T. cruzi ortholog contains all three of the zinc-binding residues and several residues uniquely conserved in the beta subunit of PGGT-I. Co-expression of this protein and the alpha subunit of T. cruzi PFT in Sf9 insect cells yielded a dimeric protein that forms a tight complex selectively with [(3)H]geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, indicating a key characteristic of a functional PGGT-I. Recombinant T. cruzi PGGT-I ortholog showed geranylgeranyltransferase activity with distinct specificity toward the C-terminal CaaX motif of protein substrates compared to that of the mammalian PGGT-I and T. cruzi PFT. Most of the CaaX-containing proteins with X=Leu are good substrates of T. cruzi PGGT-I, and those with X=Met are substrates for both T. cruzi PFT and PGGT-I, whereas unlike mammalian PGGT-I, those with X=Phe are poor substrates for T. cruzi PGGT-I. Several candidates for T. cruzi PGGT-I or PFT substrates containing the C-terminal CaaX motif are found in the T. cruzi gene database. Among five C-terminal peptides of those tested, a peptide of a Ras-like protein ending with CVLL was selectively geranylgeranylated by T. cruzi PGGT-I. Other peptides with CTQQ (Tcj2 DNAJ protein), CAVM (TcPRL-1 protein tyrosine phosphatase), CHFM (a small GTPase like protein), and CQLF (TcRho1 GTPase) were specific substrates for T. cruzi PFT but not for PGGT-I. The mRNA and protein of the T. cruzi PGGT-I beta ortholog were detected in three life-cycle stages of T. cruzi. Cytosol fractions from trypomastigotes (infectious mammalian stage) and epimastigotes (insect stage) were shown to contain levels of PGGT-I activity that are approximately 100-fold lower than PFT activity. The CaaX mimetics known as PGGT-I inhibitors show very low potency against T. cruzi PGGT-I compared to the mammalian enzyme, suggesting the potential to develop selective inhibitors against the parasite enzyme.
Cellular processes including proliferation, organization of the actin cytoskeleton, vesicular traffic and secretion of proteins comprising the lysosomal/endosomal system are regulated by low-molecular-weight GTP-binding proteins of the Ras superfamily. However, to date only three Dictyostelium discoideum ras-like genes and two ypt-1/sec4-like genes have been identified and characterized. We report here the identification (using an oligodeoxyribonucleotide probe) of seven additional cDNAs coding for members highly related to the Rac proteins (Ras-related-C3 botulinum toxin substrate) which belong to the Rho (Ras homologous) family of GTPases. Three of these rac-related genes (rac1A, rac1B and rac1C) predict proteins with &gt; 90% amino acid (aa) sequence identity with each other and &gt; 80% identity to the human rac1 gene product, whereas the other members (racA, racB, racC and racD) predict proteins with 46-74% identity to the rac1 and rhoA gene products and to each other. The D. discoideum proteins were entirely conserved over the four regions known to be important for GTP binding and all contained the C-terminal CAAX aa motifs shared by other Rho proteins. Interestingly, the D. discoideum rac-related genes revealed unique patterns of expression during growth and development. For instance, the steady-state level of rac1 mRNA, encoded by three highly related genes, increased transiently during aggregation and then rapidly decreased. In contrast, the cellular abundance of mRNAs encoded by the other rac-like genes decreased at different rates and to different levels during development from the peak levels observed during growth. This suggests that the GTP-binding proteins encoded by these genes may play unique roles during the different stages of the D. discoideum life cycle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Interstitial 18q deletions encompassing band 18q12.3 define the del(18)(q12.2q21.1) syndrome. Usual manifestations are mild dysmorphic features, mental retardation, behaviour abnormalities and lack of serious malformation. Seizures have also been found. Recently, more specifically, impairment of expressive language has been reported. We report on two patients with de novo 18q interstitial deletions characterized by oligonucleotide array CGH. The smallest, a 5.3Mb deletion (35.7-40.9Mb) within band q12.3, was found in a 4-year-old girl who suffered mainly from expressive dysphasia. A larger 9.5Mb deletion (34.6-43.9Mb) was observed in a 20-year-old man with a more severe clinical picture including seizures and limited speech. Among the four genes located in the 5.3Mb region, RIT2 (Ras-like without CAAX 2) and SYT4 (synaptotagmin IV), both strongly expressed in the brain, are pointed out as likely candidate genes for language development.
Prenyltransferase enzymes promote the membrane localization of their target proteins by directing the attachment of a hydrophobic lipid group at a conserved C-terminal CAAX motif. Subsequently, the prenylated protein is further modified by postprenylation processing enzymes that cleave the terminal 3¬†amino acids and carboxymethylate the prenylated cysteine residue. Many prenylated proteins, including Ras1 and Ras-like proteins, require this multistep membrane localization process in order to function properly. In the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, previous studies have demonstrated that two distinct forms of protein prenylation, farnesylation and geranylgeranylation, are both required for cellular adaptation to stress, as well as full virulence in animal infection models. Here, we establish that the C.¬†neoformans RAM1 gene encoding the farnesyltransferase Œ≤-subunit, though not strictly essential for growth under permissive in vitro conditions, is absolutely required for cryptococcal pathogenesis. We also identify and characterize postprenylation protease and carboxyl methyltransferase enzymes in C.¬†neoformans. In contrast to the prenyltransferases, deletion of the genes encoding the Rce1 protease and Ste14 carboxyl methyltransferase results in subtle defects in stress response and only partial reductions in virulence. These postprenylation modifications, as well as the prenylation events themselves, do play important roles in mating and hyphal transitions, likely due to their regulation of peptide pheromones and other proteins involved in development. IMPORTANCE Cryptococcus neoformans is an important human fungal pathogen that causes disease and death in immunocompromised individuals. The growth and morphogenesis of this fungus are controlled by conserved Ras-like GTPases, which are also important for its pathogenicity. Many of these proteins require proper subcellular localization for full function, and they are directed to cellular membranes through a posttranslational modification process known as prenylation. These studies investigate the roles of one of the prenylation enzymes, farnesyltransferase, as well as the postprenylation processing enzymes in C.¬†neoformans. We demonstrate that the postprenylation processing steps are dispensable for the localization of certain substrate proteins. However, both protein farnesylation and the subsequent postprenylation processing steps are required for full pathogenesis of this fungus. 
Noonan syndrome is a heterogeneous autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in at least eight genes involved in the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway. Recently, RIT1 (Ras-like without CAAX 1) has been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of some patients. We report a series of 44 patients from 30 pedigrees (including nine multiplex families) with mutations in RIT1. These patients display a typical Noonan gestalt and facial phenotype. Among the probands, 8.7% showed postnatal growth retardation, 90% had congenital heart defects, 36% had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (a lower incidence compared with previous report), 50% displayed speech delay and 52% had learning difficulties, but only 22% required special education. None had major skin anomalies. One child died perinatally of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Compared with the canonical Noonan phenotype linked to PTPN11 mutations, patients with RIT1 mutations appear to be less severely growth retarded and more frequently affected by cardiomyopathy. Based on our experience, we estimate that RIT1 could be the cause of 5% of Noonan syndrome patients. Because mutations found constitutionally in Noonan syndrome are also found in several tumors in adulthood, we evaluated the potential contribution of RIT1 to leukemogenesis in Noonan syndrome. We screened 192 pediatric cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemias (96 B-ALL and 96 T-ALL) and 110 cases of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemias (JMML), but detected no variation in these tumoral samples, suggesting that Noonan patients with germline RIT1 mutations are not at high risk to developing JMML or ALL, and that RIT1 has at most a marginal role in these sporadic malignancies.
Recent studies investigating the association of the Ras-like without CAAX 2 (RIT2) polymorphism, rs12456492, with Parkinson's disease (PD) are controversial. We performed a meta-analysis to study the association between rs12456492 and PD susceptibility in Asian populations. Literature searches of PubMed and Embase were performed up to June 3, 2015, and the strength of the association between rs12456492 and PD was evaluated by odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Four studies conducted between 2013 and 2015, comprising 2017 PD cases and 2010 controls, were included in the meta-analysis. Significant association of rs12456492 with PD was found in the dominant (GG‚Äâ+‚ÄâAG vs. AA: OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.26, 95% CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.20-1.44, P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.00) and additive models (GG vs. AA: OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.38, 95% CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.03-1.83, P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.030). Although sensitivity analysis found that the overall result was stable only in the dominant genetic model, a publication bias was also detected. Therefore, the results should be treated with caution. The current meta-analysis suggested that rs12456492 might be associated with increased PD risk in Asian populations, but studies using larger sample sizes and different ethnic populations will be needed to further confirm this association. 
Ras-like without CAAX 1 (RIT1/Rit) is a member of the Ras subfamily of small GTP-binding proteins with documented roles in regulating neuronal function, including contributions to neurotrophin signaling, neuronal survival, and neurogenesis. The aim of the study was to (1) examine the expression of RIT1 protein in mouse retina and retinal cell types and (2) determine whether RIT1 contributes to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival and synaptic stability following excitotoxic stress.
Gene expression and immunohistochemical analysis were used to examine RIT1 expression in the mouse retina. Primary RGC and M√ºller glia cultures were used to validate novel RIT1 lentiviral RNAi silencing reagents, and to demonstrate that RIT1 loss does not alter RGC morphology. Finally, in vitro glutamate exposure identified a role for RIT1 in the adaptation of RGCs to excitotoxic stress.
Gene expression analysis and immunohistochemical studies in whole eyes and primary cell culture demonstrate RIT1 expression throughout the retina, including M√ºller glia and RGCs. While genetic RIT1 knockout (RIT1-KO) does not affect gross retinal anatomy, including the thickness of constituent retinal layers or RGC cell numbers, RNAi-mediated RIT1 silencing results in increased RGC death and synaptic loss following exposure to excitotoxic stress.
RIT1 is widely expressed in the murine retina, including both M√ºller glia and RGCs. While genetic deletion of RIT1 does not result in gross retinal abnormalities, these studies identify a novel role for RIT1 in the adaptation of RGC to excitotoxic stress, with RIT1 promoting both neuronal survival and the retention of PSD-95+ synapses.
Ras-like without CAAX2 (RIT2) which encodes a GTP-binding protein has recently been reported as a new susceptibility gene for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) in a genome-wide association study. Since the gene is suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of different neurological diseases, we investigated the association of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) rs16976358 and rs4130047 of this gene with ASD in Iranian patients. A total of 1004 individuals, comprising 532 ASD cases and 472 healthy subjects participated in this study. Allele frequency analyses showed significant over-presentation of rs16976358-C allele in cases versus controls (P¬†&lt;¬†0.0001). In addition, rs16976358 CC genotype (OR (95% CI) =3.57(1.72-7.69) and P¬†&lt;¬†0.0001) and rs4130047 CC genotype (OR (95% CI) =0.64(0.43-0.97) and P¬†=¬†0.035) were associated with ASD in recessive inheritance model. Besides, haplotype analysis demonstrated an association between the C/T haplotype block (rs16976358/rs4130047) and ASD (OR (95%CI)¬†=¬†0.44 (0.31-0.62), P¬†&lt;¬†0.0001). Altogether, our findings provided additional confirmation for the RIT2 gene participation in ASD risk and suggested the rs16976358 variant as a possible genetic risk factor for this disorder.
Ras family small GTPases serve as binary molecular switches to regulate a broad array of cellular signaling cascades, playing essential roles in a vast range of normal physiological processes, with dysregulation of numerous Ras-superfamily G-protein-dependent regulatory cascades underlying the development of human disease. However, the physiological function for many "orphan" Ras-related GTPases remain poorly characterized, including members of the Rit subfamily GTPases. Rit is the founding member of a novel branch of the Ras subfamily, sharing close homology with the neuronally expressed Rin and Drosophila Ric GTPases. Here, we highlight recent studies using transgenic and knockout animal models which have begun to elucidate the physiological roles for the Rit subfamily, including emerging roles in the regulation of neuronal morphology and cellular survival signaling, and discuss new genetic data implicating Rit and Rin signaling in disorders such as cancer, Parkinson's disease, autism, and schizophrenia. 
3,4-Dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate synthase (DHBPS) encoded by ribB gene is one of the first enzymes in riboflavin biosynthesis pathway and catalyzes the conversion of ribulose-5-phosphate (Ru5P) to 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate and formate. DHBPS is an attractive target for developing anti-bacterial drugs as this enzyme is essential for pathogens, but absent in humans. The recombinant DHBPS enzyme of Salmonella requires magnesium ion for its activity and catalyzes the formation of 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate from Ru5P at a rate of 199 nmol min(-1) mg(-1) with K(m) value of 116 ŒºM at 37¬∞C. Further, we have determined the crystal structures of Salmonella DHBPS in complex with sulfate, Ru5P and sulfate-zinc ion at a resolution of 2.80, 2.52, and 1.86 √Ö, respectively. Analysis of these crystal structures reveals that the acidic loop (residues 34-39) responsible for the acid-base catalysis is disordered in the absence of substrate or metal ion at the active site. Upon binding either substrate or sulfate and metal ions, the acidic loop becomes stabilized, adopts a closed conformation and interacts with the substrate. Our structure for the first time reveals that binding of substrate Ru5P alone is sufficient for the stabilization of the acidic active site loop into a closed conformation. In addition, the Glu38 residue from the acidic active site loop undergoes a conformational change upon Ru5P binding, which helps in positioning the second metal ion that stabilizes the Ru5P and the reaction intermediates. This is the first structural report of DHBPS in complex with either substrate or metal ion from any eubacteria.
Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is a Gram-negative, chemolithoautotrophic bacterium involved in metal bioleaching. Using the RNA arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (RAP-PCR), we have identified several cDNAs that were differentially expressed when A. ferrooxidans LR was submitted to potassium- and phosphate-limiting conditions. One of these cDNAs showed similarity with ribB. An analysis of the A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 genome, made available by The Institute for Genomic Research, showed that the ribB gene was not located in the rib operon, but a ribBA gene was present in this operon instead. The ribBA gene was isolated from A. ferrooxidans LR and expression of both ribB and ribBA was investigated. Transcript levels of both genes were enhanced in cells grown in the absence of K2HPO4, in the presence of zinc and copper sulfate and in different pHs. Transcript levels decreased upon exposure to a temperature higher than the ideal 30 degrees C and at pH 1.2. A comparative genomic analysis using the A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 genome revealed similar putative regulatory elements for both genes. Moreover, an RFN element was identified upstream from the ribB gene. Phylogenetic analysis of the distribution of RibB and RibBA in bacteria showed six different combinations. We suggest that the presence of duplicated riboflavin synthesis genes in bacteria must provide their host with some benefit in certain stressful situations.
One of the pathways involved in the acquisition of the essential metal iron by bacteria involves the reduction of insoluble Fe(3+) to soluble Fe(2+), followed by transport of Fe(2+) to the cytoplasm. Flavins have been implicated as electron donors in this poorly understood process. Ferrous iron uptake is essential for intestinal colonization by the important pathogen Campylobacter jejuni and may be of particular importance under low-oxygen conditions. In this study, the links among riboflavin biosynthesis, ferric reduction, and iron acquisition in C. jejuni NCTC11168 have been investigated. A riboflavin auxotroph was generated by inactivation of the ribB riboflavin biosynthesis gene (Cj0572), and the resulting isogenic ribB mutant only grew in the presence of exogenous riboflavin or the riboflavin precursor diacetyl but not in the presence of the downstream products flavin adenine dinucleotide and flavin mononucleotide. Riboflavin uptake was unaffected in the ribB mutant under iron-limited conditions but was lower in both the wild-type strain and the ribB mutant under iron-replete conditions. Mutation of the fur gene, which encodes an iron uptake regulator of C. jejuni, resulted in an increase in riboflavin uptake which was independent of the iron content of the medium, suggesting a role for Fur in the regulation of the as-yet-unknown riboflavin transport system. Finally, ferric reduction activity was independent of iron availability in the growth medium but was lowered in the ribB mutant compared to the wild-type strain and, conversely, increased in the fur mutant. Taken together, the findings confirm close relationships among iron acquisition, riboflavin production, and riboflavin uptake in C. jejuni.
Six representatives of a luminous bacterium commonly found in association with deep, cold-dwelling marine fishes were isolated from the light organs and skin of different fish species. These bacteria were Gram-negative, catalase-positive, and weakly oxidase-positive or oxidase-negative. Morphologically, cells of these strains were coccoid or coccoid-rods, occurring singly or in pairs, and motile by means of polar flagellation. After growth on seawater-based agar medium at 22 degrees C for 18 h, colonies were small, round and white, with an intense cerulean blue luminescence. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity placed these bacteria in the genus Photobacterium. Phylogenetic analysis based on seven housekeeping gene sequences (16S rRNA gene, gapA, gyrB, pyrH, recA, rpoA and rpoD), seven gene sequences of the lux operon (luxC, luxD, luxA, luxB, luxF, luxE and luxG) and four gene sequences of the rib operon (ribE, ribB, ribH and ribA), resolved the six strains as members of the genus Photobacterium and as a clade distinct from other species of Photobacterium. These strains were most closely related to Photobacterium phosphoreum and Photobacterium iliopiscarium. DNA-DNA hybridization values between the designated type strain, Photobacterium kishitanii pjapo.1.1(T), and P. phosphoreum LMG 4233(T), P. iliopiscarium LMG 19543(T) and Photobacterium indicum LMG 22857(T) were 51, 43 and 19 %, respectively. In AFLP analysis, the six strains clustered together, forming a group distinct from other analysed species. The fatty acid C(17 : 0) cyclo was present in these bacteria, but not in P. phosphoreum, P. iliopiscarium or P. indicum. A combination of biochemical tests (arginine dihydrolase and lysine decarboxylase) differentiates these strains from P. phosphoreum and P. indicum. The DNA G+C content of P. kishitanii pjapo.1.1(T) is 40.2 %, and the genome size is approximately 4.2 Mbp, in the form of two circular chromosomes. These strains represent a novel species, for which the name Photobacterium kishitanii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain, pjapo.1.1(T) (=ATCC BAA-1194(T)=LMG 23890(T)), is a luminous symbiont isolated from the light organ of the deep-water fish Physiculus japonicus.
In Streptomyces davawensis roseoflavin is synthesized from GTP and ribulose-5-phosphate through riboflavin. As a first step towards the molecular analysis of flavin metabolism in S. davawensis the genes involved in riboflavin biosynthesis were cloned by hybridization of heterologous probes to a genomic library on a high-density colony-array. The genes ribB (riboflavin synthase, alpha-chain; EC 2.5.1.9), ribM (putative membrane protein), ribA (bifunctional GTP cyclohydrolase II/3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate synthase; EC 3.5.4.25) and ribH (lumazine synthase; EC 2.5.1.9) are organized in an operon-like cluster. Northern blot analysis of this cluster revealed two transcripts of 1.7 and 3.1 kb, respectively. The gene ribB was overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The specific riboflavin synthase activity in a cell-free extract of a recombinant strain was 0.246 nmol mg(-1 )min(-1). Overexpression of ribM enhanced the transport of riboflavin in the corresponding recombinant E. coli strain. Furthermore, overexpression of ribM increased roseoflavin sensitivity of E. coli. On another subgenomic fragment a putative S. davawensis ribG gene coding for the missing pyrimidine deaminase/reductase (EC 3.5.4.26 and EC 1.1.1.193) of the riboflavin biosynthetic pathway and ribY coding for a second (monofunctional) GTP cyclohydrolase II were identified.
The regulation of the lux operon (luxICDABEG) of Vibrio fischeri has been intensively studied as a model for quorum sensing in proteobacteria. Two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis previously identified several non-Lux proteins in V. fischeri MJ-100 whose expression was dependent on LuxR and 3-oxo-hexanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C6-HSL). To determine if the LuxR-dependent regulation of the genes encoding these proteins was due to direct transcriptional control by LuxR and 3-oxo-C6-HSL or instead was due to indirect control via an unidentified regulatory element, promoters of interest were cloned into a lacZ reporter and tested for their LuxR and 3-oxo-C6-HSL dependence in recombinant Escherichia coli. The promoters for qsrP, acfA, and ribB were found to be directly activated via LuxR-3-oxo-C6-HSL. The sites of transcription initiation were established via primer extension analysis. Based on this information and the position of the lux box-binding site near position -40, all three promoters appear to have a class II-type promoter structure. In order to more fully characterize the LuxR regulon in V. fischeri MJ-100, real-time reverse transcription-PCR was used to study the temporal expression of qsrP, acfA, and ribB during the exponential and stationary phases of growth, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to compare the binding affinities of LuxR to the promoters under investigation. Taken together, the results demonstrate that regulation of the production of QsrP, RibB, and AcfA is controlled directly by LuxR at the level of transcription, thereby establishing that there is a LuxR regulon in V. fischeri MJ-100 whose genes are coordinately expressed during mid-exponential growth.
Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 is a Gram-negative, facultative aerobic bacterium, able to respire a variety of electron acceptors. Due to its capability to reduce solid ferric iron, S. oneidensis plays an important role in microbially induced corrosion of metal surfaces. Since this requires cellular adhesion to the metal surface, biofilm growth is an essential feature of this process. The goal of this work was to compare the global protein expression patterns of sessile and planktonic grown S. oneidensis cells by two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis. Mass spectrometry was used as an identification tool of the differentially expressed proteins. An IPG strip of pH 3-10 as well as pH 4-7 was applied for iso-electrofocusing. Analysis of the 2-D patterns pointed out a total of 59 relevant spots. Among these proteins, we highlight the involvement of a protein annotated as an agglutination protein (AggA). AggA is a TolC-like protein which is presumably part of an ABC transporter. Another differentially expressed protein is RibB, an enzyme of the riboflavin biosynthesis pathway. Riboflavin is the precursor molecule of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and may be necessary for the altered respiratory properties of the biofilm cells versus planktonic cells. Some proteins that were identified indicate an anaerobic state of the biofilm. This anaerobic way of living affects the energy gaining pathways of the cell and is reflected by the presence of several proteins, including those of a heme-utilization system.
Escherichia coli grows over a wide range of pHs (pH 4.4 to 9.2), and its own metabolism shifts the external pH toward either extreme, depending on available nutrients and electron acceptors. Responses to pH values across the growth range were examined through two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-D gels) of the proteome and through lac gene fusions. Strain W3110 was grown to early log phase in complex broth buffered at pH 4.9, 6.0, 8.0, or 9.1. 2-D gel analysis revealed the pH dependence of 19 proteins not previously known to be pH dependent. At low pH, several acetate-induced proteins were elevated (LuxS, Tpx, and YfiD), whereas acetate-repressed proteins were lowered (Pta, TnaA, DksA, AroK, and MalE). These responses could be mediated by the reuptake of acetate driven by changes in pH. The amplified proton gradient could also be responsible for the acid induction of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) enzymes SucB and SucC. In addition to the autoinducer LuxS, low pH induced another potential autoinducer component, the LuxH homolog RibB. pH modulated the expression of several periplasmic and outer membrane proteins: acid induced YcdO and YdiY; base induced OmpA, MalE, and YceI; and either acid or base induced OmpX relative to pH 7. Two pH-dependent periplasmic proteins were redox modulators: Tpx (acid-induced) and DsbA (base-induced). The locus alx, induced in extreme base, was identified as ygjT, whose product is a putative membrane-bound redox modulator. The cytoplasmic superoxide stress protein SodB was induced by acid, possibly in response to increased iron solubility. High pH induced amino acid metabolic enzymes (TnaA and CysK) as well as lac fusions to the genes encoding AstD and GabT. These enzymes participate in arginine and glutamate catabolic pathways that channel carbon into acids instead of producing alkaline amines. Overall, these data are consistent with a model in which E. coli modulates multiple transporters and pathways of amino acid consumption so as to minimize the shift of its external pH toward either acidic or alkaline extreme.
A riboflavin biosynthesis ribB mutant of Escherichia coli deficient of 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate synthase was complemented with a cDNA library from Lycopersicon esculentum. The complementing gene was isolated and expressed in E. coli. The resulting protein was shown to specify a 62 kDa protein which phosphorylates dihydroxyacetone, both enantiomers of 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone, and several other aldoses and ketoses. Sequence analysis revealed homology to dihydroacetone kinases (dak) genes from plants, animals, fungi and some eubacteria. Genes with similarity to the 5' part of the dak gene from tomato were found in many other eubacteria. The physiological role of the dak gene is still incompletely known.
Nucleotide sequence of the riboflavin synthesis genes ribE, ribB, ribH, ribA (GenBank Accession No. AF364106) resided in the lux operon of Photobacterium leiognathi PL741 has been determined, and the amino acid sequences of riboflavin synthetase (RibE), DHBP synthetase (RibB), lumazine synthetase (RibH), GTP cyclohydrolase II (RibA) encoded by the riboflavin synthesis genes are deduced. Nucleotide sequence reveals that the ribE gene encodes the riboflavin synthetase responsible for converting lumazine to riboflavin, the ribB gene encodes the DHBP synthetase responsible for 3,4-dihydroxyl-2-butanone 4-phosphate synthesis, the ribH gene encodes the lumazine synthetase responsible for lumazine synthesis, and the ribA gene encodes the GTP cyclohydrolase II responsible for lumazine synthesis. Functional analysis illustrates that the specific segments lay behind the ribH and ribA genes might form potential loops Omega(oT) and Omega(TI)--Omega(TII); Omega(oT) is functioned as mRNA stability loop or/and for subregulation by alternative modulation, and Omega(TI)--Omega(TII) could be the transcriptional terminator of the lux operon. The gene order of the ribE, ribB, ribH, ribA genes resided in the lux operon and linked to the lum operon is &lt;--ter*-lumQ-lumP-R&amp;R-luxC-luxD-luxA-luxB-luxN-luxE-luxG-ribE-ribB-ribH-ribA-ter--&gt; (R&amp;R: regulatory region; ter: transcriptional terminator), whereas the R&amp;R is the regulatory region for the lum and the lux operons, and ter and ter* are the transcriptional terminators for the lux and lum operons.
The functions of the riboflavin synthesis gene homologues ribA, ribBA, ribC, and ribD from Helicobacter pylori strain P1 were confirmed by complementation of defined Escherichia coli mutant strains. The H. pylori ribBA gene, which is similar to bifunctional ribBA genes of Gram-positive bacteria, fully complemented the ribB mutation and partially restored growth in a ribC mutant. However, ribBA did not complement the ribA mutation in E. coli, thus explaining the presence of the additional separate copy of the ribA gene in the H. pylori chromosome. In E. coli exclusively ribA conferred hemolytic activity and gave rise to production of molecules with fluorescence characteristics similar to flavins, as observed earlier. The E. coli hemolysin ClyA was not involved in causing the hemolytic phenotype. No riboflavin synthesis genes on plasmids conferred iron uptake functions to a siderophore-deficient mutant of E. coli. Marker exchange mutagenesis of the genes in H. pylori was not successful indicating that riboflavin synthesis is essential for basic metabolic functions of the gastric pathogen.
The luminescence (lux) operon (luxICDABEG) of the symbiotic bacterium Vibrio fischeri is regulated by the transcriptional activator LuxR and two acyl-homoserine lactone (acyl-HSL) autoinducers (the luxI-dependent 3-oxo-hexanoyl-HSL [3-oxo-C6-HSL] and the ainS-dependent octanoyl-HSL [C8-HSL]) in a population density-responsive manner called quorum sensing. To identify quorum-sensing-regulated (QSR) proteins different from those encoded by lux genes, we examined the protein patterns of V. fischeri quorum-sensing mutants defective in luxI, ainS, and luxR by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Five non-Lux QSR proteins, QsrP, RibB, AcfA, QsrV, and QSR 7, were identified; their production occurred preferentially at high population density, required both LuxR and 3-oxo-C6-HSL, and was inhibited by C8-HSL at low population density. The genes encoding two of the QSR proteins were characterized: qsrP directs cells to synthesize an apparently novel periplasmic protein, and ribB is a homolog of the Escherichia coli gene for 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate synthase, a key enzyme for riboflavin synthesis. The qsrP and ribB promoter regions each contained a sequence similar to the lux operon lux box, a 20-bp region of dyad symmetry necessary for LuxR/3-oxo-C6-HSL-dependent activation of lux operon transcription. V. fischeri qsrP and ribB mutants exhibited no distinct phenotype in culture. However, a qsrP mutant, in competition with its parent strain, was less successful in colonizing Euprymna scolopes, the symbiotic host of V. fischeri. The newly identified QSR genes, together with the lux operon, define a LuxR/acyl-HSL-responsive quorum-sensing regulon in V. fischeri.
We have been developing an externally coupled transcutaneous energy transmission system (ECTETS) for a totally implantable total artificial heart (TITAH). When the ECTETS is unable to supply the energy to drive the TITAH from outside the body, a rechargeable internal back-up battery (RIBB) implanted inside the body is used as a back-up to supply the required energy. This paper reports on the performance characteristics of our ECTETS with an RIBB. In this study, a lithium-ion (Li+) secondary battery was used as the RIBB. The transcutaneous energy transmission and the charging control characteristics of the ECTETS, while simultaneously supplying energy to the TITAH and the RIBB, were evaluated in an in vitro experiment. The output power and transmission efficiency of the ECTETS operating in this mode were found to vary from 20 W to 34 W and from 84% to 71%, respectively. It was also found that a sufficient power of more than 20 W could be supplied to the TITAH. The time needed to fully charge the RIBB was 117 minutes, and a fully charged RIBB could drive the TITAH, consuming 20 W for 62 minutes. It may, therefore, reasonably be concluded that the ECTETS with the RIBB is sufficient to drive the TITAH.
Three kinds of rechargeable batteries, NiCd, NiMH, and Li+, were compared for the purpose of selecting the most appropriate battery for use in a Rechargeable Internal Back-up Battery (RIBB) unit for a Totally Implantable Artificial Heart. Batteries of each kind were connected in series to obtain the required driving voltage of 24 V. The NiCd and NiMH batteries were charged by a constant current of 1 C, and the Li+ batteries were charged first by a constant current of 1 C and later by a constant voltage of 28.7 V. All three types of batteries were discharged using a dummy electronic pulsatile load consuming 20 W of power. The tests showed that the Li+ batteries were capable of supplying the required energy for more than 60 minutes. The Li+ batteries had a specific energy of 121.5 Wh/kg, which was more than 3x that of the NiCd and NiMH, and an energy density of 282.5 Wh/L more than double that of the other two. In addition, the Li+ batteries recorded the least temperature rise during charging and discharging. The results of our tests conclusively showed that the Li+ battery is the best among the three for use in an RIBB from the viewpoint of energy density and temperature rise.
The RIB7 gene encoding the enzyme of the final stage of riboflavin biosynthesis in Pichia guilliermondii--riboflavin synthase was cloned on the pFL38 shuttle vector as the Sau3A fragment of the chromosomal DNA of about 4 kb. The HindIII fragment of 1.4 kb was subcloned from the hybrid plasmid pFR7 obtained onto the pUC18 plasmid. The plasmid pR7 thus constructed transform Escherichia coli ribB-45 mutant cells with a blocked riboflavin synthase approximately at the same frequency as pFR7. High riboflavin synthase activity was discovered in the E. coli transformants carrying pR7 but not pFR7. Using both plasmids we also complemented rib17 mutant of P. guilliermondii.
Three open reading frames (ORFs) have been found in the region downstream of the luxG gene in the Photobacterium leiognathi lux operon. These genes (ORF I, II, and III) are not only closely linked to the lux operon and transcribed in the same direction but also show the same organization and code for proteins homologous in sequence to the gene products of ribB, ribA, and ribH of Bacillus subtilis, respectively. The Photobacterium leiognathi gene (ORF II) corresponding to ribA was expressed in Escherichia coli in the bacteriophage T7 promoter-RNA polymerase system and a 40 kDa 35S-labeled polypeptide has been detected on SDS-PAGE. Expression of DNA extending from luxBEG to ORF II inserted between a strong promoter and a reporter gene and transferred by conjugation into Vibrio harveyi did not affect the expression of the reporter gene. The results provide evidence that neither promoter nor terminator sites were present in the DNA between the luxG and ORF II indicating that these genes might be part of the lux operon.
3,4-Dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate is biosynthesized from ribulose 5-phosphate and serves as the biosynthetic precursor for the xylene ring of riboflavin. The gene coding for 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate synthase of Escherichia coli has been cloned and sequenced. The gene codes for a protein of 217 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 23,349.6 Da. The enzyme was purified to near homogeneity from a recombinant E. coli strain and had a specific activity of 1,700 nmol mg-1 h-1. The N-terminal amino acid sequence and the amino acid composition of the protein were in agreement with the deduced sequence. The molecular mass as determined by ion spray mass spectrometry was 23,351 +/- 2 Da, which is in agreement with the predicted mass. The previously reported loci htrP, "luxH-like," and ribB at 66 min of the E. coli chromosome are all identical to the gene coding for 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate synthase, but their role had not been hitherto determined. Sequence homology indicates that gene luxH of Vibrio harveyi and the central open reading frame of the Bacillus subtilis riboflavin operon code for 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate synthase.
We identified and characterized a new Escherichia coli gene, htrP. The htrP gene was identified because its insertional inactivation by the Tn10 transposon results in the inability of E. coli to form colonies at temperatures above 37 degrees C and a slow growth phenotype at 30 degrees C. The htrP gene was cloned and mapped to 66.3 min on the E. coli genetic map, 4 kbp clockwise from the tolC gene. The htrP gene was sequenced and shown to code for an acidic, 27,471-Da polypeptide and to be transcribed counterclockwise with respect to the genetic map. The predicted HtrP protein has two potential transmembrane segments and shares an identity of 64.4% over a length of 210 amino acids with the LuxH protein. Despite the fact that the htrP gene is essential for E. coli growth exclusively at high temperatures, the levels of htrP-specific transcripts decrease with increasing temperature.
A survey of intestinal schistosomiasis and vector snails was conducted in the Gumara and Ribb Irrigation project located on the eastern side of Lake Tana, northwest Ethiopia. Within the project area, stool specimens from 1273 people were examined by the thick smear method. The average infection rate for Schistosoma mansoni was 1.6%. Two localities, Addis Zemen and Yifag, located just outside the project area, were also examined, the former showing an S. mansoni prevalence of 34% (75/223) and the latter 18% (18/101) among school children. In Debre Tabor, the provincial capital 50 km away from the project site at an altitude of 2800 m., five S. mansoni cases were found among 111 school children, but they were considered to be imported cases. The possible establishment of intestinal schistosomiasis in the project area is discussed.
Using transposon Tn5 inactivation technology a collection of Escherichia coli mutants defective in riboflavine biosynthesis was obtained. All mutations were distributed within three linkage groups. With the help of P1-transduction mapping, group I mutations (ribA locus) were localized near cysB locus (28 min of the standard 100 min E. coli map) and mutations of group II (ribB locus) were mapped near tolC locus (66 min). The location of group III mutations was approximately determined by the F' complementation analysis: this linkage group lies in the region of 56-60 min of the E. coli map.
Bacillus licheniformis was transformed with plasmids pUB110 and pJJ10 (pUB110 - pBR322) isolated from Bac. subtilis and Escherichia coli, respectively. It was revealed that the structure and genetic properties of the plasmids did not change during the transformation process. pJJ101 (pJJ10-rib) DNA isolated from E. coli and containing helper pJJ10 plasmid was used, as a recipient. It was shown that pJJ101 rib markers were "rescued" by the resident plasmid during transformation of Bac. licheniformis (pJJ10). Plasmid pLP1 containing ribB, ribD, Kmr genes and the pUB110 replicator, was isolated from the transformants. pLP1 plasmid might be considered as a detected derivative of the parental pJJ101 plasmid. The deletion is presented by 3,9 MD segment that contains the pBR322 replicator. pLP1 DNA is capable of transforming plasmidless strains of Bac. licheniformis and Bac. subtilis.
A primary genomic screen for quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting carcass and growth traits was performed by genotyping 238 microsatellite markers on 185 out of 300 total progeny from a Bos indicus x Bos taurus sire mated to Bos taurus cows. The following traits were analyzed for QTL effects: birth weight (BWT), weaning weight (WW), yearling weight (YW), hot carcass weight (HCW), dressing percentage (DP), fat thickness (FT), marbling score (MAR), longissimus muscle area (LMA), rib bone (RibB), rib fat (RibF), and rib muscle (RibM), and the predicted whole carcass traits, retail product yield (RPYD), fat trim yield (FATYD), bone yield (BOYD), retail product weight (RPWT), fat weight (FATWT), and bone weight (BOWT). Data were analyzed by generating an F-statistic profile computed at 1-cM intervals for each chromosome by the regression of phenotype on the conditional probability of receiving the Brahman allele from the sire. There was compelling evidence for a QTL allele of Brahman origin affecting an increase in RibB and a decrease in DP on chromosome 5 (BTA5). Putative QTL at or just below the threshold for genome-wide significance were as follows: an increase in RPYD and component traits on BTA2 and BTA13, an increase in LMA on BTA14, and an increase in BWT on BTA1. Results provided represent a portion of our efforts to identify and characterize QTL affecting carcass and growth traits.
3,4-Dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate synthase catalyses the release of C-4 from the substrate, ribulose phosphate, via a complex series of rearrangement reactions. The cognate ribB gene of Escherichia coli was hyperexpressed in a recombinant E. coli strain. The protein was shown to be a 46-kDa homodimer by hydrodynamic analysis. A variety of protein samples labelled with different grades of 13C, 15N and 2H, i.e. one with 100% 2H and 15N, one with 75% 2H, 99% 13C, 15N, and one with 100% 2H, 99% 13C,15N were prepared. Despite the large molecular size, 2- and 3-dimensional NMR spectra of reasonable quality were obtained. Attempts at the assignment of individual 13C, 15N and 1H signals show, in principle, the feasibility of structure determination. The number of NMR signals shows unequivocally that the homodimeric protein obeys strict C2 symmetry.
In this study, we cloned and sequenced a DNA fragment from an ordered cosmid library of Helicobacter pylori NCTC 11638 which confers to a siderophore synthesis mutant of Escherichia coli (EB53 aroB hemA) the ability to grow on iron-restrictive media and to reduce ferric iron. Sequence analysis of the DNA fragment revealed the presence of an open reading frame with high homology to the ribA gene of Bacillus subtilis. This gene encodes a bifunctional enzyme with the activities of both 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate (DHBP) synthase and GTP cyclohydrolase II, which catalyze two essential steps in riboflavin biosynthesis. Expression of the gene (designated ribBA) resulted in the formation of one translational product, which was able to complement both the ribA and the ribB mutation in E. coli. Expression of ribBA was iron regulated, as was suggested by the presence of a putative FUR box in its promotor region and as shown by RNA dot blot analysis. Furthermore, we showed that production of riboflavin in H. pylori cells is iron regulated. E. coli EB53 containing the plasmid with H. pylori ribBA excreted riboflavin in the culture medium, and this riboflavin excretion also appeared to be iron regulated. We postulate that the iron-regulated production of riboflavin and ferric-iron-reduction activity by E. coli EB53 transformed with the H. pylori ribBA gene is responsible for the survival of EB53 on iron-restrictive medium. Because disruption of ribBA in H. pylori eliminates its ferric-iron-reduction activity, we conclude that ribBA has an important role in ferric-iron reduction and iron acquisition by H. pylori.
Previously a N-acetyl-D-glucosamine specific cell-associated haemagglutinin (HA) had been purified from a Vibrio cholerae O1 strain. This study documents the role of this purified HA as an adhesin of V. cholerae O1. A significant inhibition in the adhesion of V. cholerae O1 bacterial cells to isolated rabbit intestinal brush borders (RIBB) was observed when the latter were pretreated with purified HA in ELISA. Antibody raised against purified HA and Fab (IgG) fragment of this serum inhibited adhesion of the bacteria to isolated rabbit intestinal epithelial cells (RIEC). V. cholerae O1 (both Ogawa and Inaba serovars) showed less adherence to isolated RIEC of animals immunised with the purified HA. Patients convalescing from V. cholerae O1 infection showed high ELISA titres against the purified HA indicating that it is expressed in the host during the disease process.
Four genes immediately downstream of luxG in the Photobacterium phosphoreum lux operon (ribEBHA) have been sequenced and shown to be involved in riboflavin synthesis. Sequence analyses and complementation of Escherichia coli riboflavin auxotrophs showed that the gene products of ribB and ribA are 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate (DHBP) synthetase and GTP cyclohydrolase II, respectively. By expression of P. phosphoreum ribE in E. coli using the bacteriophage T7 promoter-RNA polymerase system, ribE was shown to code for riboflavin synthetase, which catalyzes the conversion of lumazine to riboflavin. Increased thermal stability of RibE on expression with RibH indicated that ribH coded for lumazine synthetase. The organization of the rib genes in P. phosphoreum is quite distinct, with ribB and ribA being linked but separated by ribH, whereas in E. coli, they are unlinked and in Bacillus subtilis, RibB and RibA functions are coded by a single gene.
We have sequenced 6006 bp DNA of a region from the Bacillus subtilis SHgw chromosome known to contain riboflavin biosynthesis genes (rib gene cluster, 210 degrees on the B. subtilis genetic map). Five of the seven open reading frames found within the sequence are shown to represent the genes ribG, ribB, ribA, ribH and ribTD. The calculated molecular masses for the putative translation products are 39,305, 23,481, 44,121, 16,287 and 14,574 daltons respectively. The five rib genes are transcribed as a polycistronic 4277 nucleotide messenger RNA. The steady-state level of the transcript is negatively regulated by riboflavin. A cis-acting element necessary for regulation was mapped by analysis of constitutive mutations within the 5' untranslated region of the operon. The element is at least 48 bp in length and does not bear obvious similarity to well defined prokaryotic regulatory elements. The molecular mechanism of regulation remains unknown, but the data presented argue against regulation by attenuation.
Three different lambda phage clones with overlapping inserts of Bacillus subtilis DNA, which cover the region from spoIIAA to serA, have been isolated. The nucleotide sequence of their inserts, starting after spoVAF and ending at serA, has been determined. A contiguous sequence of 35,354 bp was established, including previously analysed overlapping adjacent regions. Within the newly determined sequence 31 open reading frames (ORFs) with putative ribosome-binding sites have been found. Nine of them correspond to previously sequenced and characterized genes: spo-VAF, lysA, sipS, ribG, ribB, ribA, ribH, ribTD and dacB. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the products encoded by the other ORFs to known proteins allowed putative functions to be assigned to seven of these ORFs. Among these are the following: (i) the ppiB gene, encoding a cytoplasmic peptidylprolyl isomerase; (ii) two pairs of signal-transducers, one homologous to phoR-phoP of B. subtilis, encoding regulators of phosphatase biosynthesis, and the second to the fecI-fecR of Escherichia coli, which is responsible for the regulation of the citrate-dependent iron (III) transport system; (iii) aroC and serA genes, involved in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids and serine, respectively, the function of which has been confirmed by constructing corresponding mutants with disrupted ORFs. The organization of putative operons has been postulated on the basis of the sequences of their transcription terminators, promoters and regulatory elements.
FMN riboswitches are genetic elements that, in many bacteria, control genes responsible for biosynthesis and/or transport of riboflavin (vitamin B2 ). We report that the Escherichia coli ribB FMN riboswitch controls expression of the essential gene ribB coding for the riboflavin biosynthetic enzyme 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate synthase (RibB; EC 4.1.99.12). Our data show that the E. coli ribB FMN riboswitch is unusual because it operates at the transcriptional and also at the translational level. Expression of ribB is negatively affected by FMN and by the FMN analog roseoflavin mononucleotide, which is synthesized enzymatically from roseoflavin and ATP. Consequently, in addition to flavoenzymes, the E. coli ribB FMN riboswitch constitutes a target for the antibiotic roseoflavin produced by Streptomyces davawensis.
Terpene synthesis in the majority of bacterial species, together with plant plastids, takes place via the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) pathway. The first step of this pathway involves the condensation of pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate by DXP synthase (Dxs), with one-sixth of the carbon lost as CO2. A hypothetical novel route from a pentose phosphate to DXP (nDXP) could enable a more direct pathway from C5 sugars to terpenes and also circumvent regulatory mechanisms that control Dxs, but there is no enzyme known that can convert a sugar into its 1-deoxy equivalent. Employing a selection for complementation of a dxs deletion in Escherichia coli grown on xylose as the sole carbon source, we uncovered two candidate nDXP genes. Complementation was achieved either via overexpression of the wild-type E. coli yajO gene, annotated as a putative xylose reductase, or via various mutations in the native ribB gene. In vitro analysis performed with purified YajO and mutant RibB proteins revealed that DXP was synthesized in both cases from ribulose 5-phosphate (Ru5P). We demonstrate the utility of these genes for microbial terpene biosynthesis by engineering the DXP pathway in E. coli for production of the sesquiterpene bisabolene, a candidate biodiesel. To further improve flux into the pathway from Ru5P, nDXP enzymes were expressed as fusions to DXP reductase (Dxr), the second enzyme in the DXP pathway. Expression of a Dxr-RibB(G108S) fusion improved bisabolene titers more than 4-fold and alleviated accumulation of intracellular DXP. 
Immediately after infection, virulent bacteriophages hijack the molecular machinery of their bacterial host to create an optimal climate for phage propagation. For the vast majority of known phages, it is completely unknown which bacterial functions are inhibited or coopted. Early expressed phage genome regions are rarely identified, and often filled with small genes with no homology in databases (so-called ORFans). In this work, we first analysed the temporal transcription pattern of the N4-like Pseudomonas-infecting phages and selected 26 unknown, early phage ORFans. By expressing their encoded proteins individually in the host bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we identified and further characterized six antibacterial early phage proteins using time-lapse microscopy, radioactive labelling and pull-down experiments. Yeast two-hybrid analysis gaveclues to their possible role in phage infection. Specifically, we show that the inhibitory proteins may interact with transcriptional regulator PA0120, the replicative DNA helicase DnaB, the riboflavin metabolism key enzyme RibB, the ATPase PA0657and the spermidine acetyltransferase PA4114. The dependency of phage infection on spermidine was shown in a final experiment. In the future, knowledge of how phages shut down their hosts as well ass novel phage-host interaction partners could be very valuable in the identification of novel antibacterial targets.
Human biospecimens represent invaluable resources to advance molecular medicine, epidemiology, and biomarker discovery/validation, among other biomedical research. Biobanks typically cryopreserve biospecimens to safeguard their biochemical composition. However, exposing specimens repeatedly to freeze/thaw cycles can degrade their integrity in unforeseen ways. Those biobanks storing liquid samples, thus, regularly make a fundamental compromise at collection time between freezing samples in many small volumes (e.g., 0.5 mL or smaller) or in fewer, larger volumes (e.g., 1.8 mL). The former eliminates the need to expose samples to repeated freeze/thaw cycling, although increasing up-front labor costs, consumables used, and cold storage space requirements. The latter decreases up-front labor costs, consumables, and cold storage requirements, yet exposes samples repeatedly to damaging freeze/thaw cycles when smaller aliquots are needed for analysis. The Rhode Island BioBank at Brown University (RIBB) thoroughly evaluated the performance of an original technology that minimizes a sample's exposure to freeze/thaw cycling by enabling the automated extraction of frozen aliquots from one single frozen parent sample without thawing it. A technology that eliminates unnecessary sample exposures to freeze/thaw cycles could help protect sample integrity, extend its useful life, and effectively rectify and eliminate the aforementioned need to compromise. This report presents the results of the evaluation, and conclusively demonstrates the technology's ability to extract multiple uniform frozen aliquots from a single cryotube of never-thawed frozen human plasma, which faithfully represent the parent sample when analyzed for typical biochemical analytes, showing a coefficient of variability lower than 5.5%.
To study the network dynamics of the riboflavin biosynthesis pathway and to identify potential bottlenecks in the system, an ordinary differential equation-based model was constructed using available literature data for production strains. The results confirmed that the RibA protein is rate limiting in the pathway. Under the conditions investigated, we determined a potential limiting order of the remaining enzymes under increased RibA concentration (&gt;0.102 mM) and therefore higher riboflavin production (&gt;0.045 mmol g(CDW)(-1) h(-1) and 0.0035 mM s(-1), respectively). The reductase activity of RibG and lumazine synthase (RibH) might be the next most limiting steps. The computational minimization of the enzyme concentrations of the pathway suggested the need for a greater RibH concentration (0.251 mM) compared with the other enzymes (RibG: 0.188 mM, RibB: 0.023 mM).
Engineering complex biological systems typically requires combinatorial optimization to achieve the desired functionality. Here, we present Multiplex Iterative Plasmid Engineering (MIPE), which is a highly efficient and customized method for combinatorial diversification of plasmid sequences. MIPE exploits ssDNA mediated Œª Red recombineering for the introduction of mutations, allowing it to target several sites simultaneously and generate libraries of up to 10(7) sequences in one reaction. We also describe "restriction digestion mediated co-selection (RD CoS)", which enables MIPE to produce enhanced recombineering efficiencies with greatly simplified coselection procedures. To demonstrate this approach, we applied MIPE to fine-tune gene expression level in the 5-gene riboflavin biosynthetic pathway and successfully isolated a clone with 2.67-fold improved production in less than a week. We further demonstrated the ability of MIPE for highly multiplexed diversification of protein coding sequence by simultaneously targeting 23 codons scattered along the 750 bp sequence. We anticipate this method to benefit the optimization of diverse biological systems in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering.
Treatment with antithyroid drugs may be accompanied by side effects. We present a patient diagnosed with Grave's Disease who developed extensive vasculitis in the lower limbs during methimazole use. After suspension of the methimazole and the introduction of prednisone in immunesupressor doses the cutaneous lesions started to involute.
In the present study, the proteome of a strain of S. enterica serovar Enteritidis PT4, grown either as biofilm on stainless steel surface or as free-floating (planktonic) in Brain Heart (BH) broth, was investigated in order to detect the strong differences in whole-cell protein expression patterns between the two growth styles. The proteins extracted from both types of cells were subjected to 2-D PAGE, followed by in-gel tryptic digestion, extraction, subsequent MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) analysis and finally database searches for protein identification. Using this approach, 30 proteins were identified as differentially expressed between the two growth modes on an "on-off" basis, that is, proteins that were detected in one case but not in the other. In particular, 20 and 10 proteins were identified in biofilm and planktonic-grown cells, respectively. The group of proteins whose expression was visible only during biofilm growth included proteins involved in global regulation and stress response (ArcA, BtuE, Dps, OsmY, SspA, TrxA, YbbN and YhbO), nutrient transport (Crr, DppA, Fur and SufC), degradation and energy metabolism (GcvT, GpmA, RibB), detoxification (SseA and YibF), DNA metabolism (SSB), curli production (CsgF), and murein synthesis (MipA). To summarize, this study demonstrates that biofilm growth of S. Enteritidis causes distinct changes in protein expression and offers valuable new data regarding some of the proteins presumably involved in this process. The putative role of these proteins in the maintenance of a biofilm community in Salmonella and other bacteria is discussed.
Riboflavin serves as a precursor for flavocoenzymes (FMN and FAD) and is essential for all living organisms. The two committed enzymatic steps of riboflavin biosynthesis are performed in plants by bifunctional RIBA enzymes comprised of GTP cyclohydrolase II (GCHII) and 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate synthase (DHBPS). Angiosperms share a small RIBA gene family consisting of three members. A reduction of AtRIBA1 expression in the Arabidopsis rfd1mutant and in RIBA1 antisense lines is not complemented by the simultaneously expressed isoforms AtRIBA2 and AtRIBA3. The intensity of the bleaching leaf phenotype of RIBA1 deficient plants correlates with the inactivation of AtRIBA1 expression, while no significant effects on the mRNA abundance of AtRIBA2 and AtRIBA3 were observed. We examined reasons why both isoforms fail to sufficiently compensate for a lack of RIBA1 expression. All three RIBA isoforms are shown to be translocated into chloroplasts as GFP fusion proteins. Interestingly, both AtRIBA2 and AtRIBA3 have amino acid exchanges in conserved peptides domains that have been found to be essential for the two enzymatic functions. In vitro activity assays of GCHII and DHBPS with all of the three purified recombinant AtRIBA proteins and complementation of E. coli ribA and ribB mutants lacking DHBPS and GCHII expression, respectively, confirmed the loss of bifunctionality for AtRIBA2 and AtRIBA3. Phylogenetic analyses imply that the monofunctional, bipartite RIBA3 proteins, which have lost DHBPS activity, evolved early in tracheophyte evolution.
A functional 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway is required for isoprenoid biosynthesis and hence survival in Escherichia coli and most other bacteria. In the first two steps of the pathway, MEP is produced from the central metabolic intermediates pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate via 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) by the activity of the enzymes DXP synthase (DXS) and DXP reductoisomerase (DXR). Because the MEP pathway is absent from humans, it was proposed as a promising new target to develop new antibiotics. However, the lethal phenotype caused by the deletion of DXS or DXR was found to be suppressed with a relatively high efficiency by unidentified mutations. Here we report that several mutations in the unrelated genes aceE and ribB rescue growth of DXS-defective mutants because the encoded enzymes allowed the production of sufficient DXP in vivo. Together, this work unveils the diversity of mechanisms that can evolve in bacteria to circumvent a blockage of the first step of the MEP pathway.
A useful goal for metabolic engineering would be to generate non-growing but metabolically active quiescent cells which would divert the metabolic fluxes towards product formation rather than growth. However, for products like recombinant proteins, which are intricately coupled to the growth process it is difficult to identify the genes that need to be knocked-out/knocked-in to get this desired phenotype. To circumvent this we adopted an inverse metabolic engineering strategy which would screen for the desired phenotype and thus help in the identification of genetic targets which need to be modified to get overproducers of recombinant protein. Such quiescent cells would obviate the need for high cell density cultures and increase the operational life span of bioprocesses.
A novel strategy for generating a library, consisting of randomly down regulated metabolic pathways in E. coli was designed by cloning small genomic DNA fragments in expression vectors. Some of these DNA fragments got inserted in the reverse orientation thereby generating anti-sense RNA upon induction. These anti-sense fragments would hybridize to the sense mRNA of specific genes leading to gene 'silencing'. This library was first screened for slow growth phenotype and subsequently for enhanced over-expression ability. Using Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) as a reporter protein on second plasmid, we were able to identify metabolic blocks which led to significant increase in expression levels. Thus down-regulating the ribB gene (3, 4 dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate synthase) led to a 7 fold increase in specific product yields while down regulating the gene kdpD (histidine kinase) led to 3.2 fold increase in specific yields.
We have designed a high throughput screening approach which is a useful tool in the repertoire of reverse metabolic engineering strategies for the generation of improved hosts for recombinant protein expression.
Streptomyces davawensis is the only organism known to synthesize the antibiotic roseoflavin, a riboflavin (vitamin B2) analog. Roseoflavin is converted to roseoflavin mononucleotide (RoFMN) and roseoflavin adenine dinucleotide in the cytoplasm of target cells. (Ribo-)Flavin mononucleotide (FMN) riboswitches are genetic elements, which in many bacteria control genes responsible for the biosynthesis and transport of riboflavin. Streptomyces davawensis is roseoflavin resistant, and the closely related bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor is roseoflavin sensitive. The two bacteria served as models to investigate roseoflavin resistance of S. davawensis and to analyze the mode of action of roseoflavin in S. coelicolor. Our experiments demonstrate that the ribB FMN riboswitch of S. davawensis (in contrast to the corresponding riboswitch of S. coelicolor) is able to discriminate between the two very similar flavins FMN and RoFMN and shows opposite responses to the latter ligands.
This study aims at investigating the spawning migration of the endemic Labeobarbus species and C. gariepinus from Lake Tana, through Ribb River, to Welala and Shesher wetlands. The study was conducted during peak spawning months (July to October, 2010). Fish were collected through overnight gillnet settings. A total of 1725 specimens of the genus Labeobarbus (13 species) and 506 specimens of C. gariepinus were collected. Six species of Labeobarbus formed prespawning aggregation at Ribb River mouth. However, no Labeobarbus species was found to spawn in the two wetlands. More than 90% of the catch in Welala and Shesher wetlands was contributed by C. gariepinus. This implies that these wetlands are ideal spawning and nursery habitats for C. gariepinus but not for the endemic Labeobarbus species. Except L. intermedius, all the six Labeobarbus species (aggregated at Ribb River mouth) and C. gariepinus (spawning at Shesher and Welala wetlands) were temporally segregated.
Riboswitches are RNA sensors that regulate gene expression upon binding specific metabolites or ions. Bacterial riboswitches control gene expression primarily by promoting intrinsic transcription termination or by inhibiting translation initiation. We now report a third general mechanism of riboswitch action: governing the ability of the RNA-dependent helicase Rho to terminate transcription. We establish that Rho promotes transcription termination in the Mg(2+)-sensing mgtA riboswitch from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and the flavin mononucleotide-sensing ribB riboswitch from Escherichia coli when the corresponding riboswitch ligands are present. The Rho-specific inhibitor bicyclomycin enabled transcription of the coding regions at these two loci in bacteria experiencing repressing concentrations of the riboswitch ligands in vivo. A mutation in the mgtA leader that favors the "high Mg(2+)" conformation of the riboswitch promoted Rho-dependent transcription termination in vivo and in vitro and enhanced the ability of the RNA to stimulate Rho's ATPase activity in vitro. These effects were overcome by mutations in a C-rich region of the mRNA that is alternately folded at high and low Mg(2+), suggesting a role for this region in regulating the activity of Rho. Our results reveal a potentially widespread mode of gene regulation whereby riboswitches dictate whether a protein effector can interact with the transcription machinery to prematurely terminate transcription.
Solvent-producing clostridia are well known for their capacity to use a wide variety of renewable biomass and agricultural waste materials for biobutanol production. To investigate the possibility of co-production of a high value chemical during biobutanol production, the Clostridium acetobutylicum riboflavin operon ribGBAH was over-expressed in C. acetobutylicum on Escherichia coli-Clostridium shuttle vector pJIR750. Constructs that either maintained the original C. acetobutylicum translational start codon or modified the start codons of ribG and ribB from TTG to ATG were designed. Riboflavin was successfully produced in both E. coli and C. acetobutylicum using these plasmids, and riboflavin could accumulate up to 27 mg/l in Clostridium culture. Furthermore, the C. acetobutylicum purine pathway was modified by over-expression of the Clostridium purF gene, which encodes the enzyme PRPP amidotransferase. The function of the plasmid pJaF bearing C. acetobutylicum purF was verified by its ability to complement an E. coli purF mutation. However, co-production of riboflavin with biobutanol by use of the purF over-expression plasmid was not improved under the experimental conditions examined. Further rational mutation of the purF gene was conducted by replacement of amino acid codons D302 V and K325Q to make it similar to the feedback-resistant enzymes of other species. However, the co-expression of ribGBAH and purFC in C. acetobutylicum also did not improve riboflavin production. By buffering the culture pH, C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824(pJpGN) could accumulate more than 70 mg/l riboflavin while producing 190 mM butanol in static cultures. Riboflavin production was shown to exert no effect on solvent production at these levels.
Malignant melanoma is a highly aggressive type of cancer that requires radical treatment strategies to inhibit the cancer cell progression and metastasis. In recent years, preclinical research and clinical trials on melanoma treatment have been considerably focused on the adjuvant-based immunotherapy for enhancing the immune response of innate immune cells against cancer cells. However, the clinical outcome of these adjuvant-based treatments is inadequate due to an improper delivery system for these immune activators to reach the target site. Hence, we developed a vaccine formulation containing tumor lysate protein (TL) and poly I:C (PIC) complexed with positively charged poly (sorbitol-co-polyethylenimine (PEI) (PSPEI). The resulting ionic PSPEI-polyplexed antigen/adjuvant (PAA) (PSPEI-PAA) nanocomplexes were stable at the physiological condition, are non-toxic, and have enhanced intracellular uptake of antigen and adjuvant in immature dendritic cells leading to dendritic cell maturation. In the murine B16F10 tumor xenograft model, PSPEI-PAA nanocomplexes significantly suppressed tumor growth and did not exhibit any noticeable sign of toxicity. The level of matured dendritic cells (CD80+/CD86+ cells) in the tumor draining lymph node of PSPEI-PAA treated tumor mice were enhanced and therefore CD8+ T cells infiltration in the tumor were enriched. Additionally, the cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) assay involving co-culturing of splenocytes isolated from the PSPEI-PAA-treated mice with that of B16F10 cells significantly revealed enhanced cancer killing by the TL-reactivated CTLs compared to untreated control mice bearing tumor. Therefore, we strongly believe that PSPEI-PAA nanocomplexes could be an efficient antigen/adjuvant delivery system and enhance the antitumor immune response against melanoma tumor in the future clinical trials.
Calprotectin (CP) inhibits bacterial viability through extracellular chelation of transition metals. However, how CP influences general metabolism remains largely unexplored. We show here that CP restricts bioavailable Zn and Fe to the pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii, inducing an extensive multi-metal perturbation of cellular physiology. Proteomics reveals severe metal starvation, and a strain lacking the candidate ZnII metallochaperone ZigA possesses altered cellular abundance of multiple essential Zn-dependent enzymes and enzymes in de novo flavin¬†biosynthesis. The ŒîzigA strain exhibits decreased cellular flavin levels during metal starvation. Flavin mononucleotide provides regulation of this biosynthesis pathway, via a 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate synthase (RibB) fusion protein, RibBX, and authentic RibB. We propose that RibBX ensures flavin sufficiency under CP-induced Fe limitation, allowing flavodoxins to substitute for Fe-ferredoxins as cell reductants. These studies elucidate adaptation to nutritional immunity and define an intersection between metallostasis and cellular metabolism in A.¬†baumannii.
To determine the feasibility, safety and tolerability of lumbar punctures (LPs) in research participants with early Parkinson disease (PD), subjects without evidence of dopaminergic deficiency (SWEDDs) and healthy volunteers (HC).
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is becoming an essential part of the biomarkers discovery effort in PD with still limited data on safety and feasibility of serial LPs in PD participants.
Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) is a longitudinal observation study designed to identify PD progression biomarkers. All PPMI participants undergo LP at baseline, 6, 12 months and yearly thereafter. CSF collection is performed by a trained investigator using predominantly atraumatic needles. Adverse events (AEs) are monitored by phone one week after LP completion. We analyzed safety data from baseline LPs.
PPMI enrolled 683 participants (423 PD/196 HC/64 SWEDDs) from 23 study sites. CSF was collected at baseline in 97.5% of participants, of whom 5.4% underwent collection under fluoroscopy. 23% participants reported any related AEs, 68% of all AE were mild while 5.6% were severe. The most common AEs were headaches (13%) and low back pain (6.5%) and both occurred more commonly in HC and SWEDDs compared to PD participants. Factors associated with higher incidence of AEs across the cohorts included female gender, younger age and use of traumatic needles with larger diameter. AEs largely did not impact compliance with the future LPs.
LPs are safe and feasible in PD research participants. Specific LP techniques (needle type and gauge) may reduce the overall incidence of AEs.
Clinical translation of nanoparticle drug (nanodrug) delivery systems for cancer therapy is primarily hindered by short half-life of nanodrugs in blood circulation and their poor ability of tumor targeting and penetration in vivo. Circulatory cells have garnered much attention in cancer therapy as drug delivery vehicles due to their biocompatibility, high mobility, biodegradability, tissue targeting capability, high drug loading capacity, ability to cross biological barriers and inherent ability to remain in blood circulation long enough to accumulate within the tumors. Here, we review the progress and potential of circulatory cells as nanodrug delivery vehicles, especially for cancer therapy.
A riboflavin biosynthesis pathway-specific phenotypic screen using a library of compounds, all with unspecified antibiotic activity, identified one small molecule later named ribocil, for which intrinsic antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli was completely suppressed by addition of exogenous riboflavin to the bacterial growth medium. The ability of riboflavin to suppress the activity of ribocil, and further demonstration that ribocil inhibited riboflavin synthesis (IC50¬†=¬†0.3¬†ŒºM), supported that a component of the riboflavin synthesis pathway was the molecular target. Remarkably, resistance mutation selection and whole-genome sequencing showed that the target of ribocil was not an enzyme in the riboflavin biosynthesis pathway, but instead the flavin mononucleotide riboswitch, a noncoding structural RNA element in the ribB gene that encodes a key riboflavin synthesis enzyme. Although ribocil is structurally distinct from the natural riboswitch regulatory ligand flavin mononucleotide, ribocil binding to the riboswitch results in efficient repression of ribB expression and inhibition of riboflavin biosynthesis and bacterial growth. A cell-based riboswitch regulated gene reporter assay as well as an in vitro riboswitch RNA aptamer-binding assay, both of which¬†are described in detail here along with the riboflavin pathway-specific screen, were developed to further validate the mechanism of action of ribocil and to facilitate the discovery of more potent analogues.
Two compounds, compounds 1 and 2, were isolated from Preussia sp. The molecular structures of both compounds were elucidated by analyzing one-dimensional (1D) and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance data along with high-resolution mass spectrometry data. Compound 1 was obtained as novel in structure, and compound 2 was recently reported elsewhere. Compound 1 did not show antioxidant and antimicrobial activities and brine shrimp toxicity, while compound 2 showed strong antioxidant activity (DPPH reduction capacity; IC50=3 Œºg/mL) and brine shrimp toxicity (LD50=50 Œºg/mL).
Several lichen species are reported to be used tradiationally in many theraupatic practices. Many lichen species are reported as sources of several bioactive natural compounds. Several lichen species of Nepal are so far chemically unexplored.
The morphological, anatomical and phytochemical characteristics of lichens were compared for the taxonomic identification of the species. Methanol- water extract of lichens were sub fractionated into hexane, dichloromethane and methanol fractions for bioactivity assays. Antimicrobial activities of extracts were evaluated agaisnt pathogenic bacteria and fungal species. DPPH test was used for antioxidant potential evaluation. Brineshrimp test was perfermed to evaluate toxicity of the extracts.
A total of 84 lichen specimens were collected and identified from Annapurna Conservation Area (ACA) Nepal. The specimens were identified as belonging to 19 genera and 47 species. Methanol fractions of 16 specimens and dichloromethane (DCM) fractions of 21 lichens specimens showed antioxidant activities comparable with commercial standards (BHA, Butylated hydroxyanisole, IC50=4.9¬±0.9 Œºg/mL) even at crude extract level. Similarly, the DCM fraction of 17 lichens showed potential antimicrobial activity against a Gram-positive bacterium (Staphylococcus aureus KCTC3881) and DCM fractions of 45 lichens showed antimicrobial activity against a Gram-negative bacterium (Klebsiella pneumoniae KCTC2242). DCM fractions of three lichens showed antifungal activity against the yeast, Candida albicans KCTC 7965. Likewise, methanol fractions of 39 lichens and DCM fractions of 74 lichens showed strong toxicity against brine shrimp nauplii with more than 80% mortality.
Such biological activity-rich lichen specimens warrant further research on exploration of natural products with antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti cancer (toxic) potential.
Riboflavin is the precursor of important redox cofactors such as flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide, required for several biological processes. Vibrio cholerae, a pathogenic bacterium responsible for the cholera disease, possesses the ability to biosynthesize de novo as well as to uptake riboflavin through the riboflavin biosynthetic pathway (RBP) and the RibN importer, respectively. The intra-organism relationship between riboflavin biosynthesis and uptake functions has not been studied.
This work determined the transcriptional organization of RBP genes and ribN in V. cholerae through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and analyzed their expression when growing with or without extracellular riboflavin using real time PCR. The RBP is organized in three transcriptional units, the major one containing ribD, ribE, ribA and ribH together with genes involved in functions not directly related to riboflavin biosynthesis such as nrdR and nusB. In addition, two independent monocistronic units contain ribA2 and ribB, the later conserving a putative FMN riboswitch. The ribN gene is encoded in operon with a gene coding for a predicted outer membrane protein and a gene encoding a protein with a glutaredoxin domain. Regulation analysis showed that among these transcriptional units, only ribB is negatively regulated by riboflavin and that its repression depends on the RibN riboflavin importer. Moreover, external riboflavin highly induced ribB transcription in a ŒîribN strain. Also, a genomic database search found a negative correlation between the presence of nrdR and nusB and the FMN riboswitch in bacterial RBP operons.
Growing in the presence of riboflavin downregulates only a single element among the transcriptional units of riboflavin supply pathways. Thus, endogenous riboflavin biosynthesis seems to be negatively regulated by extracellular riboflavin through its specific effect on transcription of ribB in V. cholerae.
Riboflavin (vitamin B2 ) is one of the B-group water-soluble vitamins and is essential for energy metabolism of the cell. The aim of this study was to determine factors that affect riboflavin production by Lactobacillus (L.) plantarum CRL 725 grown in a semi defined medium and evaluate the expression of its rib genes. The factors found to enhance riboflavin production in this medium were incubation at 30‚Äâ¬∞C, and the addition of specific medium constituents, such as casamino acids (10‚Äâg‚ÄâL-1 ), guanosine (0.04‚Äâg‚ÄâL-1 ), and sucrose as carbon source (20‚Äâg‚ÄâL-1 ). In these conditions, higher riboflavin concentrations were directly associated with significant increases in the expression of ribA, ribB, and ribC genes. The culture conditions defined in this work and its application to a roseoflavin resistant mutant of L. plantarum allowed for a sixfold increase in riboflavin concentrations in our semi-defined medium which were also significantly higher than those obtained previously using the same strain to ferment soymilk. These conditions should thus be evaluated to increase vitamin production in fermented foods.
Bacterial riboswitches are non-coding RNA structural elements that direct gene expression in numerous metabolic pathways. The key regulatory roles of riboswitches, and the urgent need for new classes of antibiotics to treat multi-drug resistant bacteria, has led to efforts to develop small-molecules that mimic natural riboswitch ligands to inhibit metabolic pathways and bacterial growth. Recently, we reported the results of a phenotypic screen targeting the riboflavin biosynthesis pathway in the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli that led to the identification of ribocil, a small molecule inhibitor of the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) riboswitch controlling expression of this biosynthetic pathway. Although ribocil is structurally distinct from FMN, ribocil functions as a potent and highly selective synthetic mimic of the natural ligand to repress riboswitch-mediated ribB gene expression and inhibit bacterial growth both in vitro and in vivo. Herein, we expand our analysis of ribocil; including mode of binding in the FMN binding pocket of the riboswitch, mechanisms of resistance and structure-activity relationship guided efforts to generate more potent analogs.
Riboswitches are non-coding RNA structures located in messenger RNAs that bind endogenous ligands, such as a specific metabolite or ion, to regulate gene expression. As such, riboswitches serve as a novel, yet largely unexploited, class of emerging drug targets. Demonstrating this potential, however, has proven difficult and is restricted to structurally similar antimetabolites and semi-synthetic analogues of their cognate ligand, thus greatly restricting the chemical space and selectivity sought for such inhibitors. Here we report the discovery and characterization of ribocil, a highly selective chemical modulator of bacterial riboflavin riboswitches, which was identified in a phenotypic screen and acts as a structurally distinct synthetic mimic of the natural ligand, flavin mononucleotide, to repress riboswitch-mediated ribB gene expression and inhibit bacterial cell growth. Our findings indicate that non-coding RNA structural elements may be more broadly targeted by synthetic small molecules than previously expected. 
The obligate intracellular bacterium, Wolbachia pipientis (Rickettsiales), is a widespread, vertically transmitted endosymbiont of filarial nematodes and arthropods. In insects, Wolbachia modifies reproduction, and in mosquitoes, infection interferes with replication of arboviruses, bacteria and plasmodia. Development of Wolbachia as a tool to control pest insects will be facilitated by an understanding of molecular events that underlie genetic exchange between Wolbachia strains. Here, we used nucleotide sequence, transcriptional and proteomic analyses to evaluate expression levels and establish the mosaic nature of genes flanking the T4SS virB8-D4 operon from wStr, a supergroup B-strain from a planthopper (Hemiptera) that maintains a robust, persistent infection in an Aedes albopictus mosquito cell line. Based on protein abundance, ribA, which contains promoter elements at the 5'-end of the operon, is weakly expressed. The 3'-end of the operon encodes an intact wspB, which encodes an outer membrane protein and is co-transcribed with the vir genes. WspB and vir proteins are expressed at similar, above average abundance levels. In wStr, both ribA and wspB are mosaics of conserved sequence motifs from Wolbachia supergroup A- and B-strains, and wspB is nearly identical to its homolog from wCobU4-2, an A-strain from weevils (Coleoptera). We describe conserved repeated sequence elements that map within or near pseudogene lesions and transitions between A- and B-strain motifs. These studies contribute to ongoing efforts to explore interactions between Wolbachia and its host cell in an in vitro system. 
We describe 2 new mosquito bioassays for use with insecticide-treated netting or other textiles. The 1st is a cylinder bioassay in which a mosquito is forced to contact treated material regardless of where it lands within the bioassay construct. The 2nd is a repellency/irritancy and biting-inhibition bioassay (RIBB) in which human arms and breath are used as attractants. Mosquitoes have the choice to pass through holes cut in untreated or treated netting to move from a center release chamber into side chambers to reach arms and potentially bite. Trials were conducted with pyrethroid-susceptible (New Orleans), moderately resistant (Hunucm√°), and highly resistant (Vergel) strains of Aedes aegypti. Tests with netting treated with different pyrethroids demonstrated the utility of the cylinder bioassay to quantify knockdown and mortality following exposure to treated netting, and of the RIBB to quantify spatial repellency/contact irritancy of the treated netting and biting inhibition after females land on and then pass through holes in the treated netting. Both tested brands of pyrethroid-treated mosquitocidal netting (DuraNet¬Æ and NetProtect¬Æ) were effective against New Orleans but ineffective against Vergel strains. Mortality in the cylinder bioassay was 100% for New Orleans for all tested brands of treated netting, but only 10-14% for Vergel. Rates of passage through treated netting to reach a human arm in the RIBB were 10-15% for New Orleans versus 24-37% for Vergel. The reduction in biting after passage through treated netting, compared with untreated netting in the same trial replicates, was 12-39% for New Orleans versus ‚â§9% for Vergel. 
The riboflavin biosynthesis pathway has been shown to be essential in many pathogens and is absent in humans. Therefore, enzymes involved in riboflavin synthesis are considered as potential antibacterial drug targets. The enzyme 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate synthase (DHBPS) catalyzes one of the two committed steps in the riboflavin pathway and converts d-ribulose 5-phosphate (Ru5P) to l-3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate and formate. Moreover, DHBPS is shown to be indispensable for Mycobacterium, Salmonella, and Helicobacter species. Despite the essentiality of this enzyme in bacteria, no inhibitor has been identified hitherto. Here, we describe kinetic and crystal structure characterization of DHBPS from Vibrio cholerae (vDHBPS) with a competitive inhibitor 4-phospho-d-erythronohydroxamic acid (4PEH) at 1.86-√Ö resolution. In addition, we also report the structural characterization of vDHBPS in its apo form and in complex with its substrate and substrate plus metal ions at 1.96-, 1.59-, and 2.04-√Ö resolution, respectively. Comparison of these crystal structures suggests that 4PEH inhibits the catalytic activity of DHBPS as it is unable to form a proposed intermediate that is crucial for DHBPS activity. Furthermore, vDHBPS structures complexed with substrate and metal ions reveal that, unlike Candida albicans, binding of substrate to vDHBPS induces a conformational change from an open to closed conformation. Interestingly, the position of second metal ion, which is different from that of Methanococcus jannaschii, strongly supports an active role in the catalytic mechanism. Thus, the kinetic and structural characterization of vDHBPS reveals the molecular mechanism of inhibition shown by 4PEH and that it can be explored further for designing novel antibiotics. 
Development of an embryo from a single cell, zygote, to multicellular morulae requires activation of hundreds of genes that were mostly inactivated before fertilization. Inevitably, transcription factors (TFs) would be involved in modulating the drastic changes in gene expression pattern observed at all preimplantation stages. Despite many ongoing efforts to uncover the role of TFs at the early stages of embryogenesis, still many unanswered questions remained that need to be explored. This could be done by studying the expression pattern of multiple genes obtained by high-throughput techniques. In the current study, we have identified a set of TFs that are involved in the progression of the zygote to blastocyst. Global gene expression patterns of consecutive stages were compared and differences documented. Expectedly, at the early stages of development, only a few sets of TFs differentially expressed while at the later stages hundreds of TFs appear to be upregulated. Interestingly, the expression levels of many TFs show an oscillation pattern during development indicating a need for their precise expression. A significant shift in gene expression was observed during the transition from four- to eight-cell stages, an indication of zygote genome activation. Additionally, we have found 11 TFs that were common in all stages including ATF3, EN1, IFI16, IKZF3, KLF3, NPAS3, NR2F2, RUNX1, SOX2, ZBTB20, and ZSCAN4. However, their expression patterns did not follow similar trends in the steps studied. Besides, our findings showed that both upregulation and active downregulation of the TFs expression is required for successful embryogenesis. Furthermore, our detailed network analysis identified the hub TFs for each transition. We found that HNF4A, FOXA2, and EP300 are the three most important elements for the first division of zygote.
microRNA (miR)-141-3p has context-dependent effects on tumor progression. In this study, we attempted to explore the expression and function of miR-141-3p in cervical cancer. We found that miR-141-3p expression was significantly increased in cervical cancer specimens relative to normal cervical tissues. Moreover, miR-141-3p levels were associated with tumor size and lymph node metastasis status. Ectopic expression of miR-141-3p significantly increased cervical cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, invasion, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition, whereas depletion of miR-141-3p suppressed cervical cancer cell proliferation and invasion. FOXA2 was identified to be a target of miR-141-3p. Overexpression of miR-141-3p led to a marked inhibition of endogenous FOXA2 in cervical cancer cells. FOXA2 silencing phenocopied the effects of miR-141-3p overexpression on cervical cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Enforced expression of FOXA2 blocked the effects of miR-141-3p on cervical cancer cell proliferation and invasion. miR-141-3p overexpression significantly accelerated the growth of xenograft tumors, which was accompanied by a striking reduction in FOXA2 expression. miR-141-3p acts as an oncogene in cervical cancer largely through repression of FOXA2. Targeting miR-141-3p may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for cervical cancer.
Hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia (HH) is a heterogeneous condition with dysregulated insulin secretion which persists in the presence of low blood glucose levels. It is the most common cause of severe and persistent hypoglycaemia in neonates and children. Recent advances in genetics have linked congenital HH to mutations in 14 different genes that play a key role in regulating insulin secretion (ABCC8, KCNJ11, GLUD1, GCK, HADH, SLC16A1, UCP2, HNF4A, HNF1A, HK1, PGM1, PPM2, CACNA1D, FOXA2). Histologically, congenital HH can be divided into 3 types: diffuse, focal and atypical. Due to the biochemical basis of this condition, it is essential to diagnose and treat HH promptly in order to avoid the irreversible hypoglycaemic brain damage. Recent advances in the field of HH include new rapid molecular genetic testing, novel imaging methods (18F-DOPA PET/CT), novel medical therapy (long-acting octreotide formulations, mTOR inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor antagonists) and surgical approach (laparoscopic surgery). The review article summarizes the current diagnostic methods and management strategies for HH in children.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by the inability of the insulin-producing Œ≤-cells to overcome insulin resistance. We previously identified an imprinted region on chromosome 14, the DLK1-MEG3 locus, as being downregulated in islets from humans with T2DM. In this study, using targeted epigenetic modifiers, we prove that increased methylation at the promoter of Meg3 in mouse Œ≤TC6 Œ≤-cells results in decreased transcription of the maternal transcripts associated with this locus. As a result, the sensitivity of Œ≤-cells to cytokine-mediated oxidative stress was increased. Additionally, we demonstrate that an evolutionarily conserved intronic region at the MEG3 locus can function as an enhancer in Œ≤TC6 Œ≤-cells. Using circular chromosome conformation capture followed by high-throughput sequencing, we demonstrate that the promoter of MEG3 physically interacts with this novel enhancer and other putative regulatory elements in this imprinted region in human islets. Remarkably, this enhancer is bound in an allele-specific manner by the transcription factors FOXA2, PDX1, and NKX2.2. Overall, these data suggest that the intronic MEG3 enhancer plays an important role in the regulation of allele-specific expression at the imprinted DLK1-MEG3 locus in human Œ≤-cells, which in turn impacts the sensitivity of Œ≤-cells to cytokine-mediated oxidative stress.
The Foxa1 and Foxa2 transcription factors are essential for mouse development. Here we show that they are expressed in thymic epithelial cells (TEC) where they regulate TEC development and function, with important consequences for T-cell development. TEC are essential for T-cell differentiation, lineage decisions and repertoire selection. Conditional deletion of Foxa1 and Foxa2 from murine TEC led to a smaller thymus with a greater proportion of TEC and a greater ratio of medullary to cortical TEC. Cell-surface MHCI expression was increased on cortical TEC in the conditional Foxa1Foxa2 knockout thymus, and MHCII expression was reduced on both cortical and medullary TEC populations. These changes in TEC differentiation and MHC expression led to a significant reduction in thymocyte numbers, reduced positive selection of CD4+CD8+ cells to the CD4 lineage, and increased CD8 cell differentiation. Conditional deletion of Foxa1 and Foxa2 from TEC also caused an increase in the medullary TEC population, and increased expression of Aire, but lower cell surface MHCII expression on Aire-expressing mTEC, and increased production of regulatory T-cells. Thus, Foxa1 and Foxa2 in TEC promote positive selection of CD4SP T-cells and modulate regulatory T-cell production and activity, of importance to autoimmunity.
The crosstalk between cells is important for differentiation of cells. Murine-derived feeder cells, SNL76/7 feeder cells (SNLs) or mouse primary embryonic fibroblast feeder cells (MEFs) are widely used for culturing undifferentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). It is still unclear whether different culture conditions affect the induction efficiency of definitive endoderm (DE) differentiation from hiPSCs. Here we show that the efficiency of DE differentiation from hiPSCs cultured on MEFs was higher than that of hiPSCs cultured on SNLs. The qPCR, immunofluorescent and flow cytometry analyses revealed that the expression levels of mRNA and/or proteins of the DE marker genes, SOX17, FOXA2 and CXCR4, in DE cells differentiated from hiPSCs cultured on MEFs were significantly higher than those cultured on SNLs. Comprehensive RNA sequencing and molecular network analyses showed the alteration of the gene expression and the signal transduction of hiPSCs cultured on SNLs and MEFs. Interestingly, the expression of non-coding hXIST exon 4 was up-regulated in hiPSCs cultured on MEFs, in comparison to that in hiPSCs cultured on SNLs. By qPCR analysis, the mRNA expression of undifferentiated stem cell markers KLF4, KLF5, OCT3/4, SOX2, NANOG, UTF1, and GRB7 were lower, while that of hXIST exon 4, LEFTY1, and LEFTY2 was higher in hiPSCs cultured on MEFs than in those cultured on SNLs. Taken together, our finding indicated that differences in murine-feeder cells used for maintenance of the undifferentiated state alter the expression of pluripotency-related genes in hiPSCs by the signaling pathways and affect DE differentiation from hiPSCs, suggesting that the feeder cells can potentiate hiPSCs for DE differentiation.
Reprogramming technology holds great promise for the study and treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) as patient-specific ventral midbrain dopamine (vmDA) neurons can be generated. This should facilitate the investigation of early changes occurring during PD pathogenesis, permitting the identification of new drug targets and providing a platform for drug screening. To date, most studies using reprogramming technology to study PD have employed induced pluripotent stem cells. Research into PD using direct reprogramming has been limited due to an inability to generate high yields of authentic human vmDA neurons. Nevertheless, direct reprogramming offers a number of advantages, and development of this technology is warranted. Previous reports have indicated that induced neural precursors (iNPs) derived from adult human fibroblasts by lineage factor-mediated direct reprogramming can give rise to dopamine neurons expressing tyrosine hydroxylase (TH+). Using normal adult human fibroblasts, the present study aimed to extend these findings and determine the capacity of iNPs for generating vmDA neurons, with the aim of utilising this technology for the future study of PD. While iNPs expressed late vmDA fate markers such as NURR1 and PITX3, critical early regional markers LMX1A, FOXA2 and EN1 were not expressed. Upon differentiation, iNPs gave rise to dopamine neuronal-like cells expressing TUJ1, TH, AADC, DAT, VMAT2 and GIRK2. To induce an authentic A9 phenotype, a series of experiments investigated temporal exposure to patterning factors. Exposure to SHH-C24II, purmorphamine, CHIR99021 and/or FGF8b during or after reprogramming was insufficient to induce expression of early vmDA regional markers. Addition of LMX1A/FOXA2 to the transfection cocktail did not induce a sustained vmDA iNP phenotype. This study reports for the first time that iNPs derived from healthy adult human cells by non-viral expression of lineage factors can give rise to dopamine neuronal-like cells. Direct-to-iNP reprogramming could be a suitable strategy for modelling PD in vitro using aged donor-derived cells.
Previously, we reported that the fluorapatite (FA)-modified polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofiber could be an odontogenic/osteogenic inductive tissue-engineering scaffold by inducing stem cell differentiation and mineralization. The present study aimed to explore which of the signal pathways affected this differentiation and mineralization process. The Human Signal Transduction PathwayFinder RT2 Profiler PCR Array was used to analyze the involvement of potential signal transduction pathways during human dental pulp stem cell (DPSCs) osteogenic differentiation induced by FA-modified PCL nanofiber scaffolds. Based on the results, perturbation studies of the signaling pathways hedgehog, insulin, and Wnt were performed. Moreover, the autophagy process was studied, as indicated by the expression of the microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3A/B-II (LC3-II) and the cell osteogenic phenotypic changes. In a comparison of the cells grown on PCL + FA scaffolds and those on PCL-only scaffolds, the transcript expression of BMP2, BMP4, FOXA2, PTCH1, WNT1, and WNT2 (PCR array-labeled signal proteins of the hedgehog pathway); CEBPB, FASN, and HK2 (PCR array-labeled signal proteins of the insulin pathway); and CCND1, JUN, MYC, TCF7, and WISP1 (PCR array-labeled signal proteins of the Wnt pathway) doubled at day 14 when obvious cell osteogenic differentiation occurred. Phenotypically, in all the perturbation groups at day 14, ALP activity, OPN, and autophagy marker LC3-II expression were coincidently decreased. Consistently, no positive alizarin red staining or von Kossa staining was observed in the specimens from these perturbation groups at day 28. The results showed that when obvious cell differentiation occurred at day 14 on PCL + FA control groups, the inhibition of the hedgehog, insulin, and Wnt pathways significantly decreased DPSC osteogenic differentiation and mineralization. The osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs grown on FA-modified PCL scaffolds appeared to be positively modulated by the hedgehog, insulin, and Wnt signal pathways, which were coordinated with and/or mediated by the cell autophagy process.
Lineage segregation in the mouse embryo is a finely controlled process dependent upon coordination of signalling pathways and transcriptional responses. Here we employ a conditional deletion system to investigate embryonic patterning and lineage specification in response to loss of Oct4. We first observe ectopic expression of Nanog in Oct4-negative postimplantation epiblast cells. The expression domains of lineage markers are subsequently disrupted. Definitive endoderm expands at the expense of mesoderm; the anterior-posterior axis is positioned more distally and an ectopic posterior-like domain appears anteriorly, suggesting a role for Oct4 in maintaining the embryonic axis. Although primitive streak forms in the presumptive proximal-posterior region, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition is impeded by an increase of E-cadherin, leading to complete tissue disorganisation and failure to generate germ layers. In explant and in vitro differentiation assays, Oct4 mutants also show upregulation of E-cadherin and Foxa2, suggesting a cell-autonomous phenotype. We confirm requirement for Oct4 in self-renewal of postimplantation epiblast ex vivo Our results indicate a role for Oct4 in orchestrating multiple fates and enabling expansion, correct patterning and lineage choice in the postimplantation epiblast.
The present study determined the expression and biological functions of FOXA2 gene in colon cancer in tissues, cells and animals. A total of 66 patients with colon cancer were included in the present study. Using The Human Protein Atlas database, expression and distribution of FOXA2 in colon cancer tissues were analyzed. Using immunohistochemistry, the expression and distribution of FOXA2 in colon cancer cells were studied. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to determine the expression of FOXA2 mRNA in colon cancer tissues. Following in vitro transfection with FOXA2 interference sequence (siR-FOXA2), the proliferation, cell cycle, migration and invasion of colon cancer HCT116 and HT29 cells were investigated using Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, flow cytometry, and Transwell assay, respectively. Furthermore, flow cytometry was used to determine apoptosis of HCT116 and HT29 cells. Western blotting was used to determine the expression of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) proteins, E-Cadherin and Vimentin. Laser scanning confocal microscopy was performed to observe the cytoskeleton in HCT116 and HT29 cells. Results indicated tumorigenesis of colon cancer cells in nude mice. In addition, the expression of FOXA2 in colon cancer tissues was elevated and associated with the metastasis and clinical staging of colon cancer. Notably, inhibition of FOXA2 reduced the proliferation of colon cancer cells in vitro and reduced expression of FOXA2 was able to decrease the migration and invasion abilities of colon cancer cells. Furthermore, FOXA2 promoted EMT, inhibited apoptosis and enhanced the invasion ability of colon cancer cells. Decreased expression of FOXA2 inhibited tumorigenesis of colon cancer cells in nude mice. To conclude, the present study demonstrated that the expression of FOXA2 in colon cancer tissues was elevated and associated with the metastasis and clinical staging of colon cancer. As an oncogene, FOXA2 may promote the proliferation, migration and invasion and EMT in colon cancer.
Adipose tissue-derived stem cell (ADSC)-based therapy is promising for the treatment of intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration, but the difficulty in inducing nucleus pulposus (NP)-like differentiation limits its clinical applications. Forkhead box (Fox)-A2 is an essential transcription factor for the formation of a normal NP. We demonstrated that type II collagen stimulates NP-like differentiation of ADSCs, partly by increasing the expression of FoxA2. We constructed FoxA2-overexpressing and -knockdown ADSCs by using lentiviral vectors. FoxA2 overexpression significantly enhanced NP-specific gene expression and the synthesis of glycosaminoglycan and collagen, whereas FoxA2 knockdown decreased NP-like differentiation and the expression of aggrecan and collagen II. The enhanced NP-like differentiation related to FoxA2 overexpression was partially rescued by an Shh signaling pathway inhibitor. In addition, FoxA2 inhibited the expression of Itg-Œ±2 and further promoted NP-like differentiation induced by type II collagen. Furthermore, FoxA2-overexpressing ADSCs combined with type II collagen hydrogels promoted regeneration of degenerated NP in vivo. Our findings suggest that FoxA2 plays an essential role in the NP-like differentiation of ADSCs by activating the Shh signaling pathway.-Zhou, X., Ma, C., Hu, B., Tao, Y., Wang, J., Huang, X., Zhao, T., Han, B., Li, H., Liang, C., Chen, Q., Li, F. FoxA2 regulates the type II collagen-induced nucleus pulposus-like differentiation of adipose-derived stem cells by activation of the Shh signaling pathway.
Previous studies have demonstrated that several members of the Forkhead-box (FOX) family of genes are associated with tumor progression and metastasis. The objective of the current study was to screen candidate FOX family genes identified from analysis of molecular networks in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). The expression of FOX family genes as well as FOX family-associated genes was examined, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort (n=525). Patient characteristics, including sex, age, tumor diameter, laterality, tumor-node-metastasis, tumor grade, stage, white blood cell count, platelet count, the levels of hemoglobin, overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), were collected for univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards ratio analyses. A total of seven candidate FOX family genes were selected from the TCGA database subsequent to univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards ratio analyses. FOXA1, FOXA2, FOXD1, FOXD4L2, FOXK2 and FOXL1 were associated with poor OS time, while FOXA1, FOXA2, FOXD1 and FOXK2 were associated with poor DFS time (P&lt;0.05). FOXN2 was associated with favorable outcomes for overall and disease-free survival (P&lt;0.05). In the gene cluster network analysis, the expression of FOX family-associated genes, including nuclear receptor coactivator (NCOA)1, NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase flavoprotein 3 (NDUFV3), phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (PISD) and pyruvate kinase liver and red blood cell (PKLR), were independent prognostic factors for OS in patients with ccRCC. Results of the present study revealed that the expression of FOX family genes, including FOXA1, FOXA2, FOXD1, FOXD4L2, FOXK2 and FOXL1, and FOX family-associated genes, including NCOA1, NDUFV3, PISD and PKLR, are independent prognostic factors for patients with ccRCC.
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are proposed to play essential roles in regulating gene transcription. Moreover, a subset has been implicated in modulating the expression of the nearby loci. Here we systematically evaluated the relationship between lncRNAs and their neighboring genes based on transcriptome expression profiles from 4900 samples across 12 cancer types. Our findings reveal that lncRNAs, especially those of high syntenic conservation across species, are spatially correlated with transcription factors across the genome. Combining the methods of conservation, co-expression, and causal inference test, we identified a list of 28 lncRNA/TF regulatory pairs across 12 TCGA cancer types, and 19 of which were further confirmed in additional cancer cell lines. Several of these pairs, including PTV1/MYC and GATA6-AS1/GATA6, show prior evidence of regulatory relationships. Other candidates such as LINC00261/FOXA2 and PITRM1-AS1/KLF6 were novel. Our study highlights the significant roles of lncRNAs in tumorigenesis and provides a comprehensive overview of lncRNA regulation on its neighboring TF genes in human cancers.
Tctn3 belongs to the Tectonic (Tctn) family and is a single-pass membrane protein localized at the transition zone of primary cilia as an important component of ciliopathy-related protein complexes. Previous studies showed that mutations in Tctn1 and Tctn2, two members of the tectonic family, have been reported to disrupt neural tube development in humans and mice, but the functions of Tctn3 in brain development remain elusive. In this study, Tctn3 knockout (KO) mice were generated by utilizing the piggyBac (PB) transposon system. We found that Tctn3 KO mice exhibited abnormal global development, including prenatal lethality, microphthalmia, polysyndactyly, and abnormal head, sternum, and neural tube, whereas Tctn3 heterozygous KO mice did not show abnormal development or behaviors. Further, we found that the mRNA levels of Gli1 and Ptch1, downstream signaling components of the Shh pathway, were significantly reduced. Likewise, neural tube patterning-related proteins, such as Shh, Foxa2, and Nkx2.2, were altered in their distribution. Interestingly, Tctn3 KO led to significant changes in apoptosis-related proteins, including Bcl-2, Bax, and cleaved PARP1, resulting in reduced numbers of neuronal cells in embryonic brains. Tctn3 KO inhibited the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway but not the mTOR-dependent pathway. The small molecule SC79, a specific Akt activator, blocked apoptotic cell death in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts from Tctn3 KO mice. Finally, NPHP1, a protein with anti-apoptotic ability, was found to form a complex with Tctn3, and its levels were decreased in Tctn3 KO mice. In conclusion, our results show that Tctn3 KO disrupts the Shh signaling pathway and neural tube patterning, resulting in abnormal embryonic development, cellular apoptosis, and prenatal death in mice.
Gastric cancer is the eighth most common cancer in Taiwan, with a 40% 5-year survival rate. Approximately 40% of patients are refractory to chemotherapy. Currently, the anti-HER2 therapy is the only clinically employed targeted therapy. However, only 7% patients in Taiwan are HER2-positive. Identifying candidate target genes will facilitate the development of adjuvant targeted therapy to increase the efficacy of gastric cancer treatment.
Clinical specimens were analyzed by targeted RNA sequencing to assess the expression levels of target genes. Statistical significance of differential expression and correlation between specimens was evaluated. The correlation with patient survival was analyzed as well. In vitro cell mobility was determined using wound-healing and transwell mobility assays.
Expression of BMP1, COL1A1, STAT3, SOX2, FOXA2, and GATA6 was progressively dysregulated through the stages of gastric oncogenesis. The expression profile of these six genes forms an ubiquitously biomarker signature that is sufficient to differentiate cancer from non-cancerous specimens. High expression status of BMP1 correlates with poor long-term survival of late-stage patients. In vitro, suppression of BMP1 inhibits the mobility of the gastric cancer cell lines, indicating a role of BMP1 in metastasis.
BMP1 is upregulated in gastric cancer and is correlated with poor patient survival. Suppression of BMP1 reduced gastric cancer mobility in vitro. Our finding suggests that anti-BMP1 therapy will likely augment the efficacy of standard chemotherapy and improve the treatment outcome.
Identification of optimal transcription factor expression patterns to direct cellular differentiation along a desired pathway presents significant challenges. We demonstrate massively combinatorial screening of temporally-varying mRNA transcription factors to direct differentiation of neural progenitor cells using a dynamically-reconfigurable magnetically-guided spotting technology for localizing mRNA, enabling experiments on millimetre size spots. In addition, we present a time-interleaved delivery method that dramatically reduces fluctuations in the delivered transcription factor copy numbers per cell. We screened combinatorial and temporal delivery of a pool of midbrain-specific transcription factors to augment the generation of dopaminergic neurons. We show that the combinatorial delivery of LMX1A, FOXA2 and PITX3 is highly effective in generating dopaminergic neurons from midbrain progenitors. We show that LMX1A significantly increases TH-expression levels when delivered to neural progenitor cells either during proliferation or after induction of neural differentiation, while FOXA2 and PITX3 increase expression only when delivered prior to induction, demonstrating temporal dependence of factor addition.
About 50% of patients with asthma exhibit chronic airway inflammation driven by the type 2 cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13. These patients with type 2-high asthma experience more allergic symptoms, greater airway hyperresponsiveness, and more severe mucus obstruction than patients with type 2-low asthma. Mouse models of asthma have shown that much of the airway dysfunction in these models can be generated by IL-13 stimulation of the airway epithelium alone. Both in vivo mouse model studies and in vitro studies of human mucociliary airway epithelial cultures have shown that IL-13 induces cellular remodeling of the airway epithelium through proliferation-independent transdifferentiation processes. In both humans and mice, IL-13 stimulation of the airway epithelium results in generation of hypersecretory mucin 5AC (MUC5AC)-expressing mucus cells. Whereas club cells have been shown to be the source of these mucin 5AC-positive mucus cells in mice, the origin of these mucus cells in humans is unclear. In humans, chronic IL-13 stimulation appears to result in loss of ciliated cells. Moreover, IL-13 stimulation can block ciliated cell differentiation from human basal airway epithelial cells. Coincident with IL-13 cellular remodeling are reported decreases in mucociliary transport and ciliary beat frequency. These IL-13-mediated changes in mucociliary function are accompanied by disorganization of cilia, a decrease in the ratio of mucin 5B (MUC5B) to mucin 5AC, and mucus gel tethering to the epithelial surface by mucin 5AC. These airway epithelial responses to IL-13 are mediated by multiple transcription factors, including signal transducer and activator of transcription-6 (STAT6), SAM pointed domain-containing Ets transcription factor (SPDEF), Forkhead box A2 (FOXA2), and Forkhead box J1 (FOXJ1). In addition, analysis of RNA-sequencing data derived from airway epithelial cells shows how IL-13 stimulation promotes broad changes in gene expression across the transcriptome. These results reveal the plastic nature of airway epithelial cells that enables the epithelium to undergo remodeling and functional shifts in response to IL-13 stimulation. With use of new technology, future studies should lead to greater understanding of how IL-13 and other stimuli of disease bring about airway epithelial remodeling, which may aid in the development of therapies that ameliorate airway dysfunction in asthma and other diseases.
Little is known regarding how steroid hormone exposures impact the epigenetic landscape in a living organism. Here, we took a global approach to understanding how exposure to the estrogenic chemical, diethylstilbestrol (DES), affects the neonatal mouse uterine epigenome.¬†Integration of RNA- and ChIP-sequencing data demonstrated that ‚àº80% of DES-altered genes had higher H3K4me1/H3K27ac signal in close proximity. Active enhancers, of which ‚àº3% were super-enhancers, had a high density of estrogen receptor alpha (ERŒ±) binding sites and were correlated with alterations in nearby gene expression. Conditional uterine deletion of ERŒ±, but not the pioneer transcription factors FOXA2 or FOXO1, prevented the majority of DES-mediated changes in gene expression and H3K27ac signal at target enhancers. An ERŒ± dependent super-enhancer was located at the Padi gene locus and a topological connection to the Padi1 TSS was documented using 3C-PCR. Chromosome looping at this site was independent of ERŒ± and DES exposure, indicating that the interaction is established prior to ligand signaling. However, enrichment of H3K27ac and transcriptional activation at this locus was both DES and ERŒ±-dependent.¬†These data suggest that DES alters uterine development and consequently adult reproductive function by modifying the enhancer landscape at ERŒ± binding sites near estrogen-regulated genes.
A variety of approaches have been developed for the derivation of hepatocyte-like cells from pluripotent stem cells. Currently, most of these strategies employ step-wise differentiation approaches with recombinant growth-factors or small-molecule analogs to recapitulate developmental signaling pathways. Here, we tested the efficacy of a small-molecule based differentiation protocol for the generation of hepatocyte-like cells from human pluripotent stem cells. Quantitative gene-expression, immunohistochemical, and western blot analyses for SOX17, FOXA2, CXCR4, HNF4A, AFP, indicated the stage-specific differentiation into definitive endoderm, hepatoblast and hepatocyte-like derivatives. Furthermore, hepatocyte-like cells displayed morphological and functional features characteristic of primary hepatocytes, as indicated by the production of ALB (albumin) and Œ±-1-antitrypsin (A1AT), as well as glycogen storage capacity by periodic acid-Schiff staining. Together, these data support that the small-molecule based hepatic differentiation protocol is a simple, reproducible, and inexpensive method to efficiently drive the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells towards a hepatocyte-like phenotype, for downstream pharmacogenomic and regenerative medicine applications.
Diabetes is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and this is in part due to the effects of hyperglycemia on vascular smooth muscle cells. Small non-coding microRNAs are known to control smooth muscle phenotype and arterial contractility and are dysregulated in diabetes. The effect of microRNAs on smooth muscle differentiation is in part mediated by the transcription factor KLF4 but the role of this mechanism in diabetic vascular disease is not fully understood. Herein, we have investigated the importance of hyperglycemia and diabetes for the expression of KLF4 in vascular smooth muscle and the involvement of miRNAs in this regulation. Hyperglycemia down-regulated KLF4 in vascular smooth muscle cells and similar results were found in arteries of diabetic mice and patients. This correlated with a Foxa2-dependent up-regulation of miR-29c, which targeted KLF4 in vascular smooth muscle cells. Importantly, by preventing downregulation of KLF4, the induction of smooth muscle contractile protein markers by glucose was inhibited. In conclusion, miR-29 mediated inhibition of KLF4 in hyperglycemic conditions contributes to increased expression of contractile markers in vascular smooth muscle cells. Further studies are warranted to determine the therapeutic implications of miR-29 inhibition in diabetic vascular disease.
The Forkhead transcription family member FOXA2 plays a fundamental role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression, but the precise interaction factor and molecular regulation of FOXA2 are not fully understood.
In this study, we found that FOXA2 could interact with sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) directly in vivo and in vitro. We explored that the expressions of FOXA2 and SIRT6 were significantly downregulated in human HCC and HCC cell lines.
Functionally, cell counting kit-8 assay and Transwell¬Æ assay were performed; we demonstrated that the knockdown of FOXA2 and SIRT6 promoted HepG2 cells and Huh7 cells proliferation and invasion in vitro.
Mechanically, using luciferase reporter assay and fast chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we showed that FOXA2 and SIRT6 regulated the expression of ZEB2 from transcription level. ZEB2 suppression was involved in the anti-oncogenesis effect of FOXA2 and SIRT6. The negative correlation between the expressions of ZEB2 and FOXA2 or SIRT6 was observed in the tissues of HCC patients.
Our findings indicated that the coordination function of FOXA2 and SIRT6 played a critical role in HCC progression and may serve as potential drug candidates for HCC.
HL1-hT1 cell line represents adult human liver stem cells (LSCs) immortalized with human telomerase reverse transcriptase. In this study, HL1-hT1 cells were found to express mesenchymal markers (vimentin, CD73, CD90/THY-1 and CD105) and an early hepatic endoderm marker FOXA2, while not expressing hepatic progenitor (HNF4A, LGR5, Œ±-fetoprotein) or differentiated hepatocyte markers (albumin, transthyretin, connexin 32). In response to microcystin-LR (MC-LR), a time- and concentration-dependent formation of MC-positive protein bands in HL1-hT1 cells was observed. Cellular accumulation of MC-LR occurred most likely via mechanisms independent on organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) or multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins, as indicated (a) by a gene expression analysis of 11 human OATP genes and 4 major MDR genes (MDR1/P-glycoprotein, MRP1, MRP2 and BCRP); (b) by non-significant effects of OATP or MDR1 inhibitors on MC-LR uptake. Accumulation of MC-positive protein bands in HL1-hT1 cells was associated neither with alterations of cell viability and growth, dysregulations of ERK1/2 and p38 kinases, reactive oxygen species formation, induction of double-stranded DNA breaks nor modulations of stress-inducible genes (ATF3, HSP5). It suggests that LSCs might have a selective, MDR1-independent, survival advantage and higher tolerance towards MC-induced cytotoxic, genotoxic or cancer-related events than differentiated adult hepatocytes, fetal hepatocyte or malignant liver cell lines. HL1-hT1 cells provide a valuable in vitro tool for studying effects of toxicants and pharmaceuticals on LSCs, whose important role in the development of chronic toxicities and liver diseases is being increasingly recognized.
Increasing evidence suggests that regulation of heterochromatin at the nuclear envelope underlies metabolic disease susceptibility and age-dependent metabolic changes, but the mechanism is unknown. Here, we profile lamina-associated domains (LADs) using lamin B1 ChIP-Seq in young and old hepatocytes and find that, although lamin B1 resides at a large fraction of domains at both ages, a third of lamin B1-associated regions are bound exclusively at each age in¬†vivo. Regions occupied by lamin B1 solely in young livers are enriched for the forkhead motif, bound by Foxa pioneer factors. We also show that Foxa2 binds more sites in Zmpste24 mutant mice, a progeroid laminopathy model, similar to increased Foxa2 occupancy in old livers. Aged and Zmpste24-deficient livers share several features, including nuclear lamina abnormalities, increased Foxa2 binding, de-repression of PPAR- and LXR-dependent gene expression, and fatty liver. In old livers, additional Foxa2 binding is correlated to loss of lamin B1 and heterochromatin (H3K9me3 occupancy) at these loci. Our observations suggest that changes at the nuclear lamina are linked to altered Foxa2 binding, enabling opening of chromatin and de-repression of genes encoding lipid synthesis and storage targets that contribute to etiology of hepatic steatosis.
Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is a common histological lung cancer subtype, but unlike lung adenocarcinoma, limited therapeutic options are available for treatment. Curcumin, a natural compound, may have anticancer effects in various cancer cells, but how it may be used to treat LSCC has not been well studied. Here, we applied curcumin to a human NCI-H292 LSCC cell line to test anticancer effects and explored underlying potential mechanisms of action. Curcumin treatment inhibited NCI-H292 cell growth and increased FOXA2 expression in a time-dependent manner. FOXA2 expression was decreased in LSCC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues and knockdown of FOXA2 increased NCI-H292 cells proliferation. Inhibition of cell proliferation by curcumin was attenuated by FOXA2 knockdown. Moreover inhibition of STAT3 pathways by curcumin increased FOXA2 expression in NCI-H292 cells whereas a STAT3 activator (IL-6) significantly inhibited curcumin-induced FOXA2 expression. Also, SOCS1 and SOCS3, negative regulators of STAT3 activity, were upregulated by curcumin treatment. Thus, curcumin inhibited human NCI-H292 cells growth by increasing FOXA2 expression via regulation of STAT3 signaling pathways.
Adaptation to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been indicated as a driver of malignancy and resistance to therapy in human melanoma. However, the relationship between cancer stem cells and adaptation to ER stress remains unclear. Here, we show that the ratio of cancer stem cells is increased in ER stress-resistant melanoma cells, which inhibit ER stress-induced apoptosis and promote tumorigenesis. Further mechanistic studies showed that HOXB9 triggered by ER stress favors cancer stem cell self-renewal and enhances ER stress resistance. HOXB9 directly binds to the promoter of microRNA-765 and facilitates its transcription, which in turn targets FOXA2, resulting in a FOXA2 decrease and cancer stem cell increase. Additionally, an increase in HOXB9 promotes melanoma growth and inhibits cell apoptosis in a mouse xenograft model. Elevated HOXB9 is found in human melanoma tissues, which is associated with microRNA-765 up-regulation and FOXA2 decreases. Thus, our data showed that the HOXB9-dependent, microRNA-765-mediated FOXA2 pathway contributes to the survival of melanoma under ER stress by maintaining the properties of cancer stem cells.
Biliary atresia (BA) is a necroinflammatory occlusive cholangiopathy that affects infants. Genetic and environmental factors has been proposed for its occurrence. The objectives of this study was to investigate the protein expression of 2 important genes regulating ductal plate remodeling, hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-beta (Hnf1Œ≤) and the fork head box protein A2 (FoxA2) in liver tissue from patients with BA and to compare their expression with other causes of neonatal cholestasis (NC). This retrospective study included 60 pediatric patients, 30 with BA and 30 with NC. Immunohistochemistry of Hnf1Œ≤ and FoxA2 was performed on liver tissues from studied patients as well as 20 healthy subjects. Statistical analysis between immunohistochemistry results and other parameters was performed. Liver tissue from patients with BA revealed reduced Hnf1Œ≤ and FoxA2 immunoexpression. A strong significant statistical difference between BA and NC group (P&lt;0.0001) with regard to Hnf1Œ≤ and FoxA2 immunoexpression was evident. Moreover, Hnf1Œ≤ was significantly correlated with FoxA2 immunoexpression, stage of fibrosis, bile ductular proliferation, and bile plugs in bile ductules. Hnf1Œ≤ immunoreaction in BA cases showed 76.7% sensitivity, 90% specificity, 88.5% positive predictive value, 79.4% negative predictive value, and 83.4% accuracy. FoxA2 expression in BA cases revealed 70.0% sensitivity, 80.0% specificity, 77.8% positive predictive value, 72.7% negative predictive value, 75.0% accuracy. Hnf1Œ≤ and FoxA2 immunoexpression could differentiate between BA from other cause of NC.
Tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) encodes the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine biosynthesis, and the regulation of its transcription is critical for the specification and maintenance of catecholaminergic neuron phenotypes. For many genes, regulatory genomic DNA sequences that are upstream of the proximal promoter control expression levels as well as region-specific expression patterns. The regulatory architecture of the genomic DNA upstream of the Th proximal promoter, however, is poorly understood. In this study, we examined the 11¬†kb upstream nucleotide sequence of Th from nine mammalian species and identified five highly conserved regions. Using cultured human cells and mouse olfactory bulb tissue, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays show that these conserved regions recruit transcription factors that are established regulators of Th transcription (such as NURR1, PITX3, FOXA2, MEIS2, and PAX6). This analysis also identified a conserved binding site for CTCF, and functional studies in cultured human cells and ChIP assays with mouse tissue show that CTCF is a novel regulator of Th transcription in the forebrain. Together, the findings in this study provide key insights into the upstream regulatory genomic architecture and regulatory mechanisms controlling mammalian Th gene transcription.
As an adaptation to the land, the clitellate annelid had reorganized its embryogenesis to develop "directly" without the ancestral planktonic larval stage. To study the evolution of gut development in the directly developing clitellates, we characterized the expression pattern of the conserved gut gene, FoxA, in the embryonic development of the leech.
The leech has three FoxA paralogs. Hau-FoxA1 is first expressed in a subset of endoderm cells and then in the foregut and the midgut. Hau-FoxA2 is expressed in the stomodeum, which is secondarily derived from the anterior ectoderm in the clitellates rather than the tissue around the blastopore, the ancestral site of mouth formation in Phylum Annelida. Hau-FoxA3 is expressed during the morphogenesis of segmental ganglia from the ectodermal teloblast lineages, a clitellate-specific trait. Hau-FoxA1 and Hau-FoxA2 are also expressed during the morphogenesis of the leech-specific front sucker.
The expression patterns suggested that Hau-FoxA1 carries out most of the conserved function in the endoderm and gut development, while the other two duplicates appear to have evolved unique novel functions in the directly developing clitellate embryos. Therefore, neofunctionalization and co-option of FoxA might have made a significant contribution to the evolution of direct development in Clitellata.

The organic compound diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) represents a high production volume chemical found in cosmetics, personal care products, laundry detergents, and household items. DEHP, along with other phthalates causes endocrine disruption in males. Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals has been linked to the development of several adverse health outcomes with apical end points including Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). This study examined the adult male zebrafish (Danio rerio) transcriptome after exposure to environmental levels of DEHP and 17Œ±-ethinylestradiol (EE2) using both DNA microarray and RNA-sequencing technologies. Our results show that exposure to DEHP is associated with differentially expressed (DE) transcripts associated with the disruption of metabolic processes in the liver, including perturbation of five biological pathways: 'FOXA2 and FOXA3 transcription factor networks', 'Metabolic pathways', 'metabolism of amino acids and derivatives', 'metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins', and 'fatty acid, triacylglycerol, and ketone body metabolism'. DE transcripts unique to DEHP exposure, not observed with EE2 (i.e. non-estrogenic effects) exhibited a signature related to the regulation of transcription and translation, and ruffle assembly and organization. Collectively our results indicate that exposure to low DEHP levels modulates the expression of liver genes related to fatty acid metabolism and the development of NAFLD.
Transcription factors (TFs) direct developmental transitions by binding to target DNA sequences, influencing gene expression and establishing complex gene-regultory networks. To systematically determine the molecular components that enable or constrain TF activity, we investigated the genomic occupancy of FOXA2, GATA4 and OCT4 in several cell types. Despite their classification as pioneer factors, all three TFs exhibit cell-type-specific binding, even when supraphysiologically and ectopically expressed. However, FOXA2 and GATA4 can be distinguished by low enrichment at loci that are highly occupied by these factors in alternative cell types. We find that expression of additional cofactors increases enrichment at a subset of these sites. Finally, FOXA2 occupancy and changes to DNA accessibility can occur in G1-arrested cells, but subsequent loss of DNA methylation requires DNA replication.
The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway plays a critical role in the maintenance of equilibrium between cell survival and apoptosis. The Pik3ca gene is mutated in a range of human cancers. It has been found to be oncogenic, and mutations lead to constitutive activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. The expression patterns of PIK3CA proteins in the uterus of mice during early pregnancy indicate that it may play a role in the regulation of glandular epithelial cells, which is required to support uterine receptivity. To further investigate the role of Pik3ca in uterine function, Pik3ca was conditionally ablated only in the PGR-positive cells (Pgrcre/+Pik3caf/f; Pik3cad/d). A defect of uterine gland development and decidualization led to subfertility observed in Pik3cad/d mice. Pik3cad/d mice showed significantly decreased uterine weight compared to Pik3caf/f mice. Interestingly, a significant decrease of gland numbers were detected in Pik3cad/d mice compared to control mice. In addition, we found a decrease of Foxa2 expression, which is a known uterine gland marker in Pik3cad/d mice. Furthermore, the excessive proliferation of endometrial epithelial cells was observed in Pik3cad/d mice. Our studies suggest that Pik3ca has a critical role in uterine gland development and female fertility.
Dynamic suspension culture of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in stirred bioreactors provides a valuable scalable culture platform for integrated differentiation toward different lineages for potential research and therapeutic applications. However, current protocols for scalable and integrated differentiation of hPSCs limited due to high cost of growth factors and technical challenges. Here, hPSCs aggregates primed with 6 and 12‚ÄâŒºM of CHIR99021 (CHIR), a Wnt agonist, in combination with different concentrations of high cost Activin A (10, 25, 50, 100‚Äâng/mL). We sought to determine the appropriate treatment duration for efficient and cost-effective differentiation protocol for foregut definitive endoderm production in a dynamic suspension culture. Afterward, we evaluated the impact of the initial hPSC aggregate sizes (small: 86‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ18‚ÄâŒºm; medium: 142‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ32‚ÄâŒºm; large: 214‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ34‚ÄâŒºm) as critical bioprocess parameter on differentiation efficacy at the beginning of induction. The results indicated that 1-day priming of hPSCs as 3D aggregates (hPSpheres) with 6‚ÄâŒºM CHIR followed by treatment with a low concentration of Activin (10‚Äâng/mL) for 2 days resulted in efficient differentiation to definitive endoderm. This finding confirmed by the presence of ‚â•70% SOX17/FOXA2-double positive cells that highly expressed the anterior endodermal marker HEX. These endodermal cells differentiated efficiently into mature functional hepatocytes [60% albumin (ALB)-positive cells]. The results showed that the initial size of hPSC aggregates significantly impacted on the efficacy of differentiation. The medium sized-hPSpheres resulted in higher productivity and differentiation efficiency for scalable hepatocytes production, whereas small aggregates resulted in significant cell-loss after CHIR treatment and large aggregates had less efficacious endodermal differentiation. Differentiated cells exhibited multiple characteristics of primary hepatocytes as evidenced by expressions of liver-specific markers, indocyanine green and low-density lipoprotein uptake, and glycogen storage. Thus, this platform could be employed for scalable production of hPSC-derived hepatocytes for clinical and drug discovery applications.
Lung cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with little improvement in patient survival rates in the past decade. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are gaining importance as possible biomarkers with prognostic potential. By large-scale data mining, we identified LINC00261 as a lncRNA which was significantly downregulated in lung cancer. Low expression of LINC00261 was associated with recurrence and poor patient survival in lung adenocarcinoma. Moreover, the gene pair of LINC00261 and its neighbor FOXA2 were significantly co-regulated. LINC00261 as well as FOXA2 negatively correlated with markers for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and were suppressed by the EMT inducer TGFŒ≤. Hierarchical clustering of gene expression data from lung cancer cell lines could further verify the association of high LINC00261/FOXA2 expression to an epithelial gene signature. Furthermore, higher expression of the LINC00261/FOXA2 locus was associated with lung cancer cell lines with lower migratory capacity. All these data establish LINC00261 and FOXA2 as an epithelial-specific marker pair, downregulated during EMT and lung cancer progression, and associated with lower cell migration potential in lung cancer cells.
Human SCGB1A1 protein has been shown to be significantly reduced in bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum and serum from human asthmatics as compared to healthy individuals. However, the mechanism of this reduction and its functional impact have not been entirely elucidated. By mining online datasets, we found that the message RNA of SCGB1A1 was significantly repressed in brushed human airway epithelial cells from asthmatics and this repression appeared to be associated with the reduced expression of FOXA2. Consistently, both Scgb1A1 and FoxA2 were downregulated in an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced mouse model of asthma. Furthermore, compared to wild-type mice, Scgb1a1 knockout mice had increased airway hyperreactivity and inflammation when the mice were exposed to OVA, confirming the anti-inflammatory role of Scgb1a1 in the protection against asthma phenotypes. To search for potential asthma-related stimuli of SCGB1A1 repression, we tested T-helper 2 (Th2) cytokines. Both IL4 and IL13 repressed epithelial expression of SCGB1A1 and FOXA2. Importantly, infection of epithelial cells with human rhinovirus similarly reduced expression of these two genes, which suggests that FOXA2 may be the common regulator of SCGB1A1. To establish the causal role of reduced FOXA2 in SCGB1A1 repression, we demonstrated that FOXA2 was required for SCGB1A1 expression at base line. FOXA2 overexpression was sufficient to drive the promoter activity and the expression of SCGB1A1, and it was also able to restore the repressed SCGB1A1 expression in IL13-treated or RV infected cells. Taken together, we conclude that low levels of epithelial SCGB1A1 in asthma is caused by reduced FOXA2 expression.
The placenta plays a pivotal role in the development of the fetal brain and also influences maternal brain function, but our understanding of communication between the placenta and brain remains limited. Using a gene expression and network analysis approach, we provide evidence that the placenta transcriptome is tightly interconnected with the maternal brain and fetal brain in d 15 pregnant C57BL/6J mice. Activation of serotonergic synapse signaling and inhibition of neurotrophin signaling were identified as potential mediators of crosstalk between the placenta and maternal brain and fetal brain, respectively. Genes encoding specific receptors and ligands were predicted to affect functional interactions between the placenta and brain. Paralogous genes, such as sex comb on midleg homolog 1/scm-like with 4 mbt domains 2 and polycomb group ring finger (Pcgf) 2/ Pcgf5, displayed antagonistic regulation between the placenta and brain. Additionally, conditional ablation of forkhead box a2 ( Foxa2) in the glands of the uterus altered the transcriptome of the d 15 placenta, which provides novel evidence of crosstalk between the uterine glands and placenta. Furthermore, expression of cathepsin 6 and monocyte to macrophage differentiation associated 2 was significantly different in the fetal brain of Foxa2 conditional knockout mice compared with control mice. These findings provide a better understanding of the intricacies of uterus-placenta-brain interactions during pregnancy and provide a foundation and model system for their exploration.-Behura, S. K., Kelleher, A. M., Spencer, T. E. Evidence for functional interactions between the placenta and brain in pregnant mice.
A suitable alternative strategy for liver transplantation is the use of nanofibrous scaffolds together with stem cells. In this study, a random hybrid of poly-l-lactic acid (PLLA) and poly(Œµ-caprolactone) (PCL) was used as a three-dimensional (3D) culture for differentiation of hepatocyte-like cells and compared with routine culture (two-dimensional [2D]). The expression of the endodermal marker, forkhead box A2 (FOXA2), was assessed on Day 3 and the hepatic markers; albumin (ALB), Œ±-1 antitrypsin (AAT), and cytokeratin-18 (CK-18) were evaluated on Day 18 using quantitative polymerase chain reaction qPCR. As well as, ALB, Œ±-fetoprotein (AFP), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake were evaluated using immunocytochemistry; moreover, periodic acid-Schiff and Oil Red were done by cell staining. In addition, AFP and urea production were evaluated by chemiluminescence and colorimetric assays. Light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed changes in the cells in 2D and 3D models. The gene expression of hepatic markers was significantly higher in the 3D cultures. In addition, immunocytochemistry and cell staining showed that ALB, AFP, LDL-uptake, periodic acid-Schiff, and Oil Red were expressed in both cells derived on 2D and 3D. Furthermore, the evaluation of AFP and urea secretion was significantly different between 2D and 3D strategies. These findings suggest that functionally cells cultured on a PLLA/PCL scaffold may be suitable for cell therapy and regenerative medicine.
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the leading cancer among men. Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) is a common treatment for advanced PCa. However, ADT eventually fails and PCa relapses, developing into castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPCa). Although alternative pathways such as cancer stem-cell pathway and neuroendocrine differentiation bypass androgen receptor (AR) signaling, AR remains the central player in mediating CRPCa. In this study, we identified a mechanism that retains AR signaling after androgen deprivation. The TRAMP SV40 T antigen transgenic mouse is a model for PCa. The expression of SV40 T-antigen is driven by the androgen-responsive, prostate specific, Probasin promoter. It has been recognized that in this model, T-antigen is still expressed even after androgen ablation. It is unclear how the androgen-responsive Probasin promoter remains active and drives the expression of T-antigen in these tumors. In our study, we found that the expression of Foxa2, a forkhead transcription factor that is expressed in embryonic prostate and advanced stage prostate cancer, is co-expressed in T-antigen positive cells. To test if Foxa2 activates AR-responsive promoters and promotes the expression of T-antigen, we established the prostate epithelial cells that stably express Foxa2, NeoTag1/Foxa2 cells. Neotag1 cells were derived from the Probasin promoter driven SV40 T-antigen transgenic mouse. We found ectopic expression of Foxa2 drives the T-antigen expression regardless of the presence of androgens. Using this model system, we further explored the mechanism that activates AR-responsive promoters in the absence of androgens. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed the occupancy of both H3K27Ac, an epigenetic mark of an active transcription, and Foxa2 at the known AR target promoters, Probasin and FKBP5, in the absence of androgen stimulation. In conclusion, we have identified a mechanism that enables PCa to retain the AR signaling pathway after androgen ablation.
The enteric nervous system is thought to originate solely from the neural crest. Transgenic lineage tracing revealed a novel population of clonal pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1 (Pdx1)-Cre lineage progenitor cells in the tunica muscularis of the gut that produced pancreatic descendants as well as neurons upon differentiation in vitro. Additionally, an in vivo subpopulation of endoderm lineage enteric neurons, but not glial cells, was seen especially in the proximal gut. Analysis of early transgenic embryos revealed Pdx1-Cre progeny (as well as Sox-17-Cre and Foxa2-Cre progeny) migrating from the developing pancreas and duodenum at E11.5 and contributing to the enteric nervous system. These results show that the mammalian enteric nervous system arises from both the neural crest and the endoderm. Moreover, in adult mice there are separate Wnt1-Cre neural crest stem cells and Pdx1-Cre pancreatic progenitors within the muscle layer of the gut.
Directed differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) toward hepatobiliary lineages has been increasingly used as models of human liver development/diseases. As protein kinases are important components of signaling pathways regulating cell fate changes, we sought to define the key molecular mediators regulating human liver development using inhibitors targeting tyrosine kinases during hepatic differentiation of human iPSCs. A library of tyrosine kinase inhibitors was used for initial screening during the multistage differentiation of human iPSCs to hepatic lineage. Among the 80 kinase inhibitors tested, only Src inhibitors suppressed endoderm formation while none had significant effect on later stages of hepatic differentiation. Transient inhibition of c-Src during endodermal induction of human iPSCs reduced endodermal commitment and expression of endodermal markers, including SOX17 and FOXA2, in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, the transiently treated cells later developed into profibrogenic cholangiocyte-like cells expressing both cholangiocyte markers, such as CK7 and CK19, and fibrosis markers, including Collagen1 and smooth muscle actin. Further analysis of these cells revealed colocalized expression of collagen and yes-associated protein (YAP; a marker associated with bile duct proliferation/fibrosis) and an increased production of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-Œ±. Moreover, treatment with verteporfin, a YAP inhibitor, significantly reduced expression of fibrosis markers. In summary, these results suggest that c-Src has a critical role in cell fate determination during endodermal commitment of human iPSCs, and its alteration in early liver development in human may lead to increased production of abnormal YAP expressing profibrogenic proinflammatory cholangiocytes, similar to those seen in livers of patients with biliary fibrosis.

It is highly desirable to specify human developmental principles in an appropriate human model with advanced genetic tools. However, genetically engineering human cells with lineage-tracing systems has not been achieved. Here we introduce strategies to construct lineage-tracing systems in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). The AAVS1 locus was suitable for the integration of the conditional reporter. The Cre-LoxP and Flp-FRT systems were highly sensitive, which may cause inaccurate lineage labeling in human cells. The recombination sensitivity and tracing fidelity could be finely tuned by modification of the LoxP recombination site. Moreover, tamoxifen-controllable CreERT2-LoxP and FlpERT2-FRT systems showed compelling advantages in tightly tracing human lineages temporally. In proof-of-principle experiments, we traced human PAX6+ neuroectoderm cells and revealed their full neural lineage differentiation potency both in¬†vitro and in¬†vivo. Devising and optimizing of lineage-tracing systems in hESCs will thus set up a solid foundation for human developmental studies.
Despite advances in early diagnosis and treatment, cancer still remains the major reason of mortality worldwide. The forkhead box A (FOXA) family is reported to participate in diverse human diseases. However, little is known about their expression and prognostic values in human lung cancer. Herein, we conducted a detailed cancer vs. normal analysis. The mRNA expression levels of FOXA family in numerous kind of cancers, including lung cancer, were analyzed using the Oncomine and GEPIA database. We observed that the mRNA expression levels of FOXA1, and FOXA3 were all increased while FOXA2 were decreased in most cancers compared with normal tissues, especially in lung cancer. Moreover, the expression levels of FOXA1, and FOXA3 are also highly expressed, while FOXA2 were decreased in almost all cancer cell lines, particularly in lung cancer cell lines, analyzing by Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and EMBL-EBI databases. Furthermore, the LinkedOmics database was used to evaluate the prognostic values, indicating that higher expression of FOXA1, FOXA3 indicated a poor overall survival (OS), while increased FOXA2 revealed a better OS in lung cancer. To conclusion, FOXA family showed significant expression differences between cancer and normal tissues, especially lung cancer, and FOXA1, FOXA3 could be promising prognostic biomarkers for lung cancer.
We report a patient with congenital complex pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) with intestinal malrotation and anal atresia. We identified a de novo heterozygous mutation, c.664T‚ÄØ&gt;‚ÄØG (p.Cys222Gly), in the FOXA2 gene in this individual. This missense mutation had the potential to affect the DNA binding properties of the FOXA2 protein based on a protein structure prediction. Since a CPHD patient with another missense mutation and one other case with an entire gene deletion have also been reported, we speculated that a haploinsufficiency of the FOXA2 gene might be a genetic etiology for this disorder. Phenotypic similarities and differences among these three cases are also discussed.
Cell replacement therapy has been envisioned as a promising treatment for neurodegenerative diseases. Due to the ethical concerns of ESCs-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and tumorigenic potential of iPSCs, reprogramming of somatic cells directly into multipotent NPCs has emerged as a preferred approach for cell transplantation.
Mouse astrocytes were reprogrammed into NPCs by the overexpression of transcription factors (TFs) Foxg1, Sox2, and Brn2. The generation of subtypes of neurons was directed by the force expression of cell-type specific TFs Lhx8 or Foxa2/Lmx1a.
Astrocyte-derived induced NPCs (AiNPCs) share high similarities, including the expression of NPC-specific genes, DNA methylation patterns, the ability to proliferate and differentiate, with the wild type NPCs. The AiNPCs are committed to the forebrain identity and predominantly differentiated into glutamatergic and GABAergic neuronal subtypes. Interestingly, additional overexpression of TFs Lhx8 and Foxa2/Lmx1a in AiNPCs promoted cholinergic and dopaminergic neuronal differentiation, respectively.
Our studies suggest that astrocytes can be converted into AiNPCs and lineage-committed AiNPCs can acquire differentiation potential of other lineages through forced expression of specific TFs. Understanding the impact of the TF sets on the reprogramming and differentiation into specific lineages of neurons will provide valuable strategies for astrocyte-based cell therapy in neurodegenerative diseases.
Our study aimed to investigate the role of lncRNA-Neighboring Enhancer of FOXA2 (NEF) in esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma.
Tumor tissues and adjacent tissues were obtained from esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma patients, and blood samples were extracted from both patients with esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma and healthy volunteers. The expression of NEF was detected by quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). All patients were followed-up for 5 years and ROC curve analysis and survival analysis were performed to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic values of serum NEF for esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma. NEF expression vector was transfected into cells of esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma cell lines. Cell proliferation, migration and invasion were detected by CCK-8 assay, transwell migration assay, and transwell invasion assay, respectively. The interaction between NEF and wnt/Œ≤-catenin pathway were explored by Western blot and qRT-PCR.
Expression of NEF was significantly downregulated in tumor tissues than in adjacent tissues in most patients. Serum level of NEF was higher in esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma patients than in healthy controls, and was significantly correlated with tumor size and tumor distant tumor metastasis. Serum NEF is a promising diagnostic and prognostic marker for esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma. NEF overexpression inhibited cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion. NEF overexpression decreased the expression levels of wnt/Œ≤-catenin pathway-related proteins, while Wnt activator showed no significant effects on NEF. However, Wnt inhibitor reduced the effects of NEF overexpression on cell proliferation, migration and invasion.
LncRNA NEF may inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion of esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma cells by inactivating with wnt/Œ≤-catenin pathway.
Diabetes mellitus is an autoimmune and chronic disorder that is rapidly expanding worldwide due to increasing obesity. In the current study, we were able to design a reliable 3-dimensional differentiation process of human Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells into pancreatic beta cell precursors (PBCPs) and detected that transplanted PBCPs could improve hyperglycemia in a diabetes-induced model in mice. Polylactic acid/chitosan nanofibrous scaffold was prepared using an electrospinning method. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemistry analysis were carried out to assess pancreatic marker expression in the differentiated cells. PBCPs were transplanted under the kidney capsule of diabetic mice that induced streptozotocin injection 14 days before the transplantation. Moreover, an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (ipGTT) was carried out 2 and 4 weeks after the transplantation to measure the reaction to a sudden increase of the blood glucose level in the transplanted animals. The results indicated that the expression of SRY (sex determining region Y)-box (Sox17), forkhead box A2 (FoxA2), pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (Pdx1), neurogenin 3 (Ngn3), hepatic nuclear factor 4, alpha (Hnf4Œ±), and NK2 homeobox 2 (Nkx2.2) were increased significantly in the differentiated cells compared with that of the control group. In the current study, the diabetic disease was confirmed by measuring blood glucose and proved by conducting some other behavioral tests. After the PBCPs transplantation in a diabetic model, the ipGTT and hyperglycemia investigation during the determinant times confirmed the disease's significant improvement in the experimental models. In this study, some preclinical data suggested that the transplantation of PBCPs associated with appropriate nanofiber scaffold can be utilized for the treatment of diabetes models. In addition, studies are required to elucidate the molecular mechanism of PBCPs acting in diabetes models before being used for patients with diabetes.
Objective To investigate a protocol for the efficient differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into insulin-producing cells (IPCs) in vitro. Methods Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) gene was knocked down in hiPSCs by RNAi. A four-step method was performed to induce the differentiation of hiPSCs into IPCs. The differentiation efficiency of IPCs was analyzed by flow cytometry. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to detect the mRNA levels of LSD1, OCT4, SOX17, FOXA2, PDX1, PAX4, PAX6, HNF6, TCF1, NKX6.1, GLUT2, GK, insulin and MAFA. The expression and localization of PDX1 and insulin were determined by immunofluorescence technique. DTZ staining and transmission electron microscopy were used to observe the secretion and distribution of intracellular insulin-containing granules in IPCs. In addition, the yield of insulin and C-peptide of IPCs were tested by ELISA. Results Compared with the control, the LSD1 knockdown group showed a higher differentiation efficiency of IPCs and the mRNA expression of pancreatic islet Œ≤-cell development-related genes SOX17, PDX1, PAX4 and insulin were significantly up-regulated. IPCs from the LSD1 knockdown group co-expressed mature Œ≤-cell specific markers PDX1 and insulin. In the LSD1 knockdown group, IPCs released insulin as secretory vesicles in response to glucose stimuli, and the yield of insulin or C-peptide reached 1/6 of adult human islets (only 1/8 in the control group). Conclusion Knockdown of LSD1 can promote the efficient differentiation of hiPSCs into IPCs in vitro.
Hyperglycemia during pregnancy is associated with fetal lung development disorders and surfactant protein (SP) deficiency. Here, we examined the role of FOXA2 and Akt signaling in fetal lung development during diabetic pregnancy. Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with streptozocin (STZ) during pregnancy to induce diabetes (DM). DM-exposed fetal lungs exhibited reduced numbers of alveoli, irregularities in the appearance and thickness of the alveolar septum, increased levels of glycogen and lipids in type II alveolar epithelial cells, fewer microvilli and mature lamellar bodies, and swollen mitochondria. SP-B and SP-C in DM amniotic fluid and DM lungs were lower than in the control group (P¬†&lt;¬†0.05). DM lung nuclear FOXA2 was lower compared with the control group (P¬†&lt;¬†0.05), but p-FOXA2 was higher (P¬†&lt;¬†0.05). In murine lung epithelial (MLE) 12 cells, p-AKT levels were increased by high glucose/insulin, but decreased by the Akt inhibitor MK2206 (P¬†&lt;¬†0.05). Expression of nuclear FOXA2 was increased by MK2206 compared with the high glucose/insulin group (P¬†&lt;¬†0.05). These results suggest that maternal diabetes induces fetal lung FOXA2 phosphorylation through the Akt pathway, and also affects the maturation of alveolar epithelial cells and reduces levels of SP-B and SP-C in the fetal lungs. An Akt inhibitor reversed the changes in SP expression in¬†vitro.
Neuronal subtype is largely fixed in the adult mammalian brain. Here, however, we unexpectedly reveal that adult mouse striatal neurons can be reprogrammed into dopaminergic neuron-like cells (iDALs). This in¬†vivo phenotypic reprogramming can be promoted by a stem cell factor (SOX2), three dopaminergic neuron-enriched transcription regulators (NURR1, LMX1A, and FOXA2), and a chemical compound (valproic acid). Although the site of action of the reprogramming factors remains to be determined, immunohistochemistry and genetic lineage mappings confirm striatal neurons as the cell origin for iDALs. iDALs exhibit electrophysiological properties stereotypical to endogenous dopaminergic rather than striatal neurons. Together, these results indicate that neuronal phenotype can be reengineered even in the adult brain, implicating a therapeutic strategy for neurological diseases.
Patients with locally advanced or recurrent prostate cancer typically undergo androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), but the benefits are often short-lived and the responses variable. ADT failure results in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which inevitably leads to metastasis. We hypothesized that differences in tumor transcriptional programs may reflect differential responses to ADT and subsequent metastasis.
We performed whole transcriptome analysis of 20 patient-matched Pre-ADT biopsies and 20 Post-ADT prostatectomy specimens, and identified two subgroups of patients (high impact and low impact groups) that exhibited distinct transcriptional changes in response to ADT. We found that all patients lost the AR-dependent subtype (PCS2) transcriptional signatures. The high impact group maintained the more aggressive subtype (PCS1) signal, while the low impact group more resembled an AR-suppressed (PCS3) subtype. Computational analyses identified transcription factor coordinated groups (TFCGs) enriched in the high impact group network. Leveraging a large public dataset of over 800 metastatic and primary samples, we identified 33 TFCGs in common between the high impact group and metastatic lesions, including SOX4/FOXA2/GATA4, and a TFCG containing JUN, JUNB, JUND, FOS, FOSB, and FOSL1. The majority of metastatic TFCGs were subsets of larger TFCGs in the high impact group network, suggesting a refinement of critical TFCGs in prostate cancer progression.
We have identified TFCGs associated with pronounced initial transcriptional response to ADT, aggressive signatures, and metastasis. Our findings suggest multiple new hypotheses that could lead to novel combination therapies to prevent the development of CRPC following ADT.
Disruption of normal barrier function is a fundamental factor in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, and intestinal stem cell (ISC) transplantation may be an optional treatment for patients. However, it is complicated and inefficient to isolate ISCs from the intestine, which hampers its wide application in clinic. We developed a two-step protocol in which mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were first induced into Sox17- or Foxa2-positive definitive endoderm cells by activin A treatment and then into Lgr5-positive ISC-like cells by miR-17 and FGF2 treatment. Furthermore, these Lgr5-positive cells could differentiate into enterocyte-like cells following induction with EGF. The results from an in¬†vivo experiment showed that the MSC-derived Lgr5-positive cells were able to¬†protect against dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. Taken together, our work might provide a new source of autologous ISCs.
Obesity is one of the largest global health problems associated with increased morbidity and mortality mediated by its association with several other metabolic disorders. The interaction between the genes and environment plays an important role in the manifestation of obesity. Despite a high heritability (40-70%) of obesity, the search for genetic variants associated with obesity susceptibility has been a challenging task. To date, limited studies have been conducted in India, restricted to the validation of few genetic variants identified by genomewide association studies. In this critical review, we sought to examine the current knowledge of genetic basis of obesity and its measures in the Indian population. A comprehensive literature search was performed using 'PubMed', 'Medline' and 'IndMed' databases to search for citations published until 31st May 2017, using the key terms as 'Genetics' AND 'obesity' AND 'India'. We identified 48 potential studies which fulfilled the eligibility criteria. The findings indicated that FTO, MC4R, TNF-Œ±, PPAR-Œ≥ , UCP1, UCP2, LPL, LEPR, AMD1, IL6, APOE, ADIPOQ, DOK5, INSIG2, PBEF1, IL6R, Myostatin, CXCR4, HHEX, IRX3, POMC, NGN3, FOXA2, MTR, TCN and CHDH are some of the important genes studied among the Indian population. Importantly, the role of sexual dimorphism in the genetic regulation of obesity and body fat distribution was also reported in a few studies. Further, seven biological pathways have been identified that contribute to obesity pathogenesis in India. In conclusion, further exploration of pathway-based research on genetics of obesity can be useful for better understanding the pathophysiology of obesity in India.
Mitochondrial carriers catalyse the translocation of numerous metabolites across the inner mitochondrial membrane, playing a key role in different cell functions. For this reason, mitochondrial carrier gene expression needs tight regulation. The human SLC25A13 gene, encoding for the mitochondrial aspartate/glutamate carrier isoform 2 (AGC2), catalyses the electrogenic exchange of aspartate for glutamate plus a proton, thus taking part in many metabolic processes including the malate-aspartate shuttle. By the luciferase (LUC) activity of promoter deletion constructs we identified the putative promoter region, comprising the proximal promoter (-442 bp/-19 bp), as well as an enhancer region (-968 bp/-768 bp). Furthermore, with different approaches, such as in silico promoter analysis, gene silencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we identified two transcription factors responsible for SLC25A13 transcriptional regulation: FOXA2 and USF1. USF1 acts as a positive transcription factor which binds to the basal promoter thus ensuring SLC25A13 gene expression in a wide range of tissues. The role of FOXA2 is different, working as an activator in hepatic cells. As a tumour suppressor, FOXA2 could be responsible for SLC25A13 high expression levels in liver and its downregulation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Studies in vertebrates have outlined conserved molecular control of definitive endoderm (END) development. However, recent work also shows that key molecular aspects of human END regulation differ even from rodents. Differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to END offers a tractable system to study the molecular basis of normal and defective human-specific END development. Here, we interrogated dynamics in chromatin accessibility during differentiation of ESCs to END, predicting DNA-binding proteins that may drive this cell fate transition. We then combined single-cell RNA-seq with parallel CRISPR perturbations to comprehensively define the loss-of-function phenotype of those factors in END development. Following a few candidates, we revealed distinct impairments in the differentiation trajectories for mediators of TGFŒ≤ signaling and expose a role for the FOXA2 transcription factor in priming human END competence for human foregut and hepatic END specification. Together, this single-cell functional genomics study provides high-resolution insight on human END development.
Modeling Parkinson's disease (PD) using advanced experimental in vitro models is a powerful tool to study disease mechanisms and to elucidate unexplored aspects of this neurodegenerative disorder. Here, we demonstrate that three-dimensional (3D) differentiation of expandable midbrain floor plate neural progenitor cells (mfNPCs) leads to organoids that resemble key features of the human midbrain. These organoids are composed of midbrain dopaminergic neurons (mDANs), which produce and secrete dopamine. Midbrain-specific organoids derived from PD patients carrying the LRRK2-G2019S mutation recapitulate disease-relevant phenotypes. Automated high-content image analysis shows a decrease in the number and complexity of mDANs in LRRK2-G2019S compared to control organoids. The floor plate marker FOXA2, required for mDAN generation, increases in PD patient-derived midbrain organoids, suggesting a neurodevelopmental defect in mDANs expressing LRRK2-G2019S. Thus, we provide a robust method to reproducibly generate 3D human midbrain organoids containing mDANs to investigate PD-relevant patho-mechanisms.
The pioneer forkhead box (FOX)A2 transcription factor is specifically expressed in the glands of the uterus, which are central to endometrial function and fertility. In mice, FOXA2 is a critical regulator of uterine gland development in the neonate and gland function in the adult. An integrative approach was used here to define the FOXA2 cistrome in the human endometrium. Genome-wide mapping of FOXA2 binding intervals by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing was performed using proliferative (P)- and midsecretory (MS)-phase endometrium and integrated with the transcriptome determined by RNA sequencing. Distinctive FOXA2 binding intervals, enriched for different transcription factor binding site motifs, were detected in the P and MS endometrium. Pathway analysis revealed different biologic processes regulated by genes with FOXA2 binding intervals in the P and MS endometrium. Thus, FOXA2 is postulated to regulate gene expression in concert with other transcription factors and impact uterine gland development and function in a cycle phase-dependent manner. Analyses also identified potential FOXA2-regulated genes that influence uterine receptivity, blastocyst implantation, and stromal cell decidualization, which are key events in pregnancy establishment.-Kelleher, A. M., Behura, S. K., Burns, G. W., Young, S. L., DeMayo, F. J., Spencer, T. E. Integrative analysis of the forkhead box A2 (FOXA2) cistrome for the human endometrium.
Esophageal cancer (EC) is one of the most lethal cancers currently known. Members of the forkhead-box A (FOXA) family, including FOXA1 and FOXA2, have been reported to regulate EC progression. However, the role of FOXA3, which is another FOXA member, has not yet been investigated. In the present study, public dataset analyses and immunohistochemistry of 96 samples from patients with EC were performed to determine the potential roles of FOXA3 in EC. The results revealed that FOXA3 was significantly upregulated in EC tumor tissues and Barrett's esophagus tissues. In addition, FOXA3 upregulation was positively associated with tumor invasion, distant metastasis, tumor-node-metastasis stage and shorter overall survival in patients with EC, and multivariate analysis identified FOXA3 as an independent prognostic marker. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the migratory and invasive abilities of EC109 and EC9706 cell lines were inhibited following FOXA3 knockdown. Notably, FOXA3 expression levels were positively correlated with FOXA1 and FOXA2 expression levels according to The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset analysis. Furthermore, FOXA3 knockdown decreased the expression levels of FOXA1 and FOXA2 in EC109 and EC9706 cell lines. Conversely, FOXA1 or FOXA2 overexpression compensated for the effects of FOXA3 knockdown on the migratory and invasive capacities of EC cells. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that FOXA3 upregulation in EC cells promoted metastasis through regulation of other FOXA members.
Nucleotide oligomerization domain protein-1 (NOD1), a cytosolic pattern recognition receptor for the Œ≥-D-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid (iE-DAP) is associated with the inflammatory diseases. Very little is known how bovine hepatocytes respond to specific ligands of NOD1 and sodium butyrate (SB). Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate the role of bovine hepatocytes in NOD1-mediated inflammation during iE-DAP or LPS treatment or SB pretreatment. To achieve this aim, hepatocytes separated from cows at ‚àº160 days in milk (DIM) were divided into six groups: The nontreated control group (CON), the iE-DAP-treated group (DAP), the lipopolysaccharide-treated group (LPS), iE-DAP with SB group (DSB), LPS with SB group (LSB), and the SB group. Both iE-DAP and LPS highly increased the expression of both NOD1 and RIPK2, the two key factors for the immune response in hepatocytes. IŒ∫BŒ±, NF-Œ∫B/p65, and MAP kinases (ERK, JNK, and p38) were activated through phosphorylation. The activation of NF-Œ∫B and MAPK pathway consequently increased the proinflammatory cytokines, IL-6, TNF-Œ±, IL-8, and IFN-Œ≥ and the chemokines CCL5, CCL20, and CXCL-10. Both treatments improved iNOS/NOS2 expression. However, iE-DAP was failed to express acute phase protein SAA3, but HP and LPS HP but SAA3. These ligands also increased LRRK2, TAK1, TAB1, and Œ≤-defensins expression. The SB pretreatment at lower dose restored the function of hepatocytes by suppressing these increased molecules, as HDAC3 was inhibited. The activated NOD1 negatively regulated the expression of FOXA2. Altogether these data suggest an important role of bovine hepatocytes to promote immune responses via NOD1 expression during infection in the liver and a key role of SB to attenuate inflammation.
Phloretin is a flavonoid with known anticancer activities. However, we do not fully understand how phloretin mitigates prostate cancer on the molecular level. In the present study, we examined changes in proliferation, colony formation, and migration after phloretin treatment in human prostate cancer cells PC3 and DU145. We measured reactive oxygen species (ROS) and gene expression. Phloretin increased ROS and suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and colony formation in both cell lines. Additionally, phloretin treatment increased oxidative stress, as demonstrated through lower antioxidant enzymes (catalase, SOD2, Gpx1, Gpx3). In addition, their regulator CISD2 decreased in expression. We also found that increased ROS significantly downregulated multiple components of the Wnt/Œ≤-catenin signaling pathway (Œ≤-catenin, TCF4, FoxA2, c-Myc) and Twist1. Thus, anticancer activity of phloretin against human prostate cancer cells occurs through generating ROS to influence Wnt/Œ≤-catenin signaling. The results of this study suggest that phloretin has a therapeutic effect on prostate cancer in vitro, inhibiting the proliferation and migration of cancer cell lines PC3 and DU145. The mechanism of phloretin appears to be increasing ROS production. We thus recommend phloretin as a promising anticancer therapeutic agent.
Hepatocyte glucose production is a complex process that integrates cell-autonomous mechanisms with cellular signaling, modulation of enzyme activities, and gene transcription. Transcriptional mechanisms controlling glucose production are redundant, and involve nuclear hormone receptors as well as unliganded transcription factors (TFs). Our knowledge of this circuitry is incomplete. Here we used DNA affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry to probe the network of hormone-regulated TFs using Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck1) and Glucose-6-phosphatase (G6pc) in liver as well as primary hepatocytes as model systems. The repertoire of insulin-regulated TFs is unexpectedly broad and diverse. Whereas in liver the two test promoters are regulated by largely overlapping sets of TFs, in primary hepatocytes Pck1 and G6pc regulation diverge. Insulin treatment preferentially results in increased occupancy of the two promoters, consistent with a model in which the hormone's primary role is to recruit co-repressors, rather than to clear activators. Nine insulin-responsive TFs are present in both models, but only FoxK1, FoxA2, ZFP91, and ZHX3 require an intact Pck1p insulin response sequence for binding. Knockdown of FoxK1 in primary hepatocytes decreased glucose production as well as insulin's ability to suppress it. The findings expand the repertoire of insulin-dependent TFs, and identify FoxK1 as a contributor to insulin signaling.
Transcription factors (TFs) are dosage-sensitive master regulators of gene expression, with haploinsufficiency frequently leading to life-threatening disease. Numerous mechanisms have evolved to tightly regulate the expression and activity of TFs at the transcriptional, translational, and posttranslational levels. A subset of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) is spatially correlated with transcription factors in the genome, but the regulatory relationship between these lncRNAs and their neighboring TFs is unclear. We identified a regulatory feedback loop between the TF Foxa2 and a downstream lncRNA, Falcor (Foxa2-adjacent long noncoding RNA). Foxa2 directly represses Falcor expression by binding to its promoter, while Falcor functions in cis to positively regulate the expression of Foxa2. In the lung, loss of Falcor is sufficient to lead to chronic inflammatory changes and defective repair after airway epithelial injury. Moreover, disruption of the Falcor-Foxa2 regulatory feedback loop leads to altered cell adhesion and migration, in turn resulting in chronic peribronchial airway inflammation and goblet cell metaplasia. These data reveal that the lncRNA Falcor functions within a regulatory feedback loop to fine-tune the expression of Foxa2, maintain airway epithelial homeostasis, and promote regeneration.
Hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide a renewable source of cells for drug discovery, disease modelling and cell-based therapies. Here, by using GRO-Seq we provide the first genome-wide analysis of the nascent RNAs in iPSCs, HLCs and primary hepatocytes to extend our understanding of the transcriptional changes occurring during hepatic differentiation process. We demonstrate that a large fraction of hepatocyte-specific genes are regulated at transcriptional level and identify hundreds of differentially expressed non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Differentiation induced alternative transcription start site (TSS) usage between the cell types as evidenced for miR-221/222 and miR-3613/15a/16-1 clusters. We demonstrate that lncRNAs and coding genes are tightly co-expressed and could thus be co-regulated. Finally, we identified sets of transcriptional regulators that might drive transcriptional changes during hepatocyte differentiation. These included RARG, E2F1, SP1 and FOXH1, which were associated with the down-regulated transcripts, and hepatocyte-specific TFs such as FOXA1, FOXA2, HNF1B, HNF4A and CEBPA, as well as RXR, PPAR, AP-1, JUNB, JUND and BATF, which were associated with up-regulated transcripts. In summary, this study clarifies the role of regulatory ncRNAs and TFs in differentiation of HLCs from iPSCs.
The Onecut 1 transcription factor (Oc1, a.k.a. HNF6) promotes differentiation of endocrine and duct cells of the pancreas; however, it has no known role in acinar cell differentiation. We sought to better understand the role of Oc1 in exocrine pancreas development and to identify its direct transcriptional targets.
Pancreata from Oc1Œîpanc (Oc1fl/fl;Pdx1-Cre) mouse embryos and neonates were analyzed morphologically. High-throughput RNA-sequencing was performed on control and Oc1-deficient pancreas; chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing was performed on wild-type embryonic mouse pancreata to identify direct Oc1 transcriptional targets. Immunofluorescence labeling was used to confirm the RNA-sequencing /chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing results and to further investigate the effects of Oc1 loss on acinar cells.
Loss of Oc1 from the developing pancreatic epithelium resulted in disrupted duct and acinar cell development. RNA-sequencing revealed decreased expression of acinar cell regulatory factors (Nr5a2, Ptf1a, Gata4, Mist1) and functional genes (Amylase, Cpa1, Prss1, Spink1) at embryonic day (e) 18.5 in Oc1Œîpanc samples. Approximately 1000 of the altered genes were also identified as direct Oc1 targets by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, including most of the previously noted genes. By immunolabeling, we confirmed that Amylase, Mist1, and GATA4 protein levels are significantly decreased by P2, and Spink1 protein levels were significantly reduced and mislocalized. The pancreatic duct regulatory factors Hnf1Œ≤ and FoxA2 were also identified as direct Oc1 targets.
These findings confirm that Oc1 is an important regulator of both duct and acinar cell development in the embryonic pancreas. Novel transcriptional targets of Oc1 have now been identified and provide clarity into the mechanisms of Oc1 transcriptional regulation in the developing exocrine pancreas. Oc1 can now be included in the gene-regulatory network of acinar cell regulatory genes. Oc1 regulates other acinar cell regulatory factors and acinar cell functional genes directly, and it can also regulate some acinar cell regulatory factors (eg, Mist1) indirectly. Oc1 therefore plays an important role in acinar cell development.
The forkhead box transcription factor FoxM1 is essential for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development, and its overexpression coincides with poor prognosis. Here, we show that the mechanisms by which FoxM1 drives HCC progression involve overcoming the inhibitory effects of the liver differentiation gene FoxA2. First, the expression patterns of FoxM1 and FoxA2 in human HCC are opposite. We show that FoxM1 represses expression of FoxA2 in G1 phase. Repression of FoxA2 in G1 phase is important, as it is capable of inhibiting expression of the pluripotency genes that are expressed mainly in S-G2 phases. Using a transgenic mouse model for oncogenic Ras-driven HCC, we provide genetic evidence for a repression of FoxA2 by FoxM1. Conversely, FoxA2 inhibits expression of FoxM1 and inhibits FoxM1-induced tumorigenicity. Also, FoxA2 inhibits Ras-induced HCC progression that involves FoxM1. IMPLICATIONS: The observations provide strong genetic evidence for an opposing role of FoxM1 and FoxA2 in HCC progression. Moreover, FoxM1 drives high-grade HCC progression partly by inhibiting the hepatocyte differentiation gene FoxA2.
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of regulatory molecules whose role in lung carcinogenesis is poorly understood. In this study, we profiled lncRNA expression in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cell lines, compared their expression to that of purified alveolar epithelial type II cells (the purported cell of origin for LUAD), cross-referenced these with lncRNAs altered in primary human tumors, and interrogated for lncRNA whose expression correlated with patient survival. We identified LINC00261, a lncRNA with unknown function in LUAD, adjacent to the pioneering transcription factor FOXA2. Loss of LINC00261 was observed in multiple tumor types, including liver, breast, and gastric cancer. Reintroduction of LINC00261 into human LUAD cell lines inhibited cell migration and slowed proliferation by inducing a G2/M cell cycle arrest while upregulating DNA damage pathway genes and inducing phosphorylation-mediated activation of components of the DNA damage pathway. FOXA2 was able to induce LINC00261 expression, and the entire locus underwent hypermethylation in LUAD, leading to loss of expression. We have thus identified an epigenetically deregulated lncRNA, whose loss of expression in LUAD promotes the malignant phenotype and blocks activation of the DNA damage machinery, predisposing lung cells to cancer development.
A large proportion of the transcriptome is sex biased in a wide range of taxa. Sexually dimorphic genes expression is highly tissue-dependent. Although gastric cancer exhibits sex bias to some extent, sexually dimorphic gene expression in the stomach is yet to be fully understood. The aim of the present study was to compare the expression levels of 12 genes in the gastric tissue between age-matched healthy men and women of different age groups. A total of 70 human antrum gastric tissue samples were obtained by endoscopy. The difference in expression levels of the 12 intended genes between two genders was investigated using quantitative Real-Time PCR, following total RNA extraction. The results indicated that the expression levels of both the GKN2 (7.2-fold, p‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.001) and FOXA2 (3.7-fold, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.003) were significantly higher in men compared to those in women. In addition, FOXA1 gene expression was age-dependent only in women. Interestingly, the expression level of FOXA1 was significantly higher in premenopausal women compared to postmenopausal women (2.53-fold, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.016). The expression levels of some of the investigated genes in this study were sex-dependent in the stomach. This sexual dimorphism in gene expression might influence the differential susceptibility to the gastric cancer between the sexes.
Airway mucus responses to subclinical infections may explain variations in progression of chronic lung diseases and differences in clinical expression of respiratory infections across individuals. Pneumocystis associates to more severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), asthma, respiratory distress of premature newborns, and is a consistent subclinical infection between 2 and 5 months of age when hospitalizations for respiratory cause and infant mortality are higher. This atypical fungus associates to increased mucin 5AC (MUC5AC), a central effector of Th2-type allergic inflammation, in infant lungs. However, mucus progression, expression of MUC5B essential for airway defense, and potential for pharmacologic modulation of mucus during Pneumocystis infection remain unknown. We measured MUC5B and Pneumocystis in infant lungs, and progression of mucin levels and effect of inhibition of the STAT6/FoxA2 mucus pathway using Kaempferol, a JAK/STAT6 inhibitor, in immunocompetent rats during Pneumocystis primary infection. Pneumocystis associated to increased MUC5B in infant lungs. Muc5b increased earlier and more abundantly than Muc5ac during experimental primary infection suggesting an acute defensive response against Pneumocystis as described against bacteria, while increased Muc5ac levels supports an ongoing allergic, Th2 lymphocyte-type response during primary Pneumocystis infection. Kaempferol partly reversed Muc5b stimulation suggesting limited potential for pharmacological modulation via the STAT6-FoxA2 pathway.
Oxygenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (OPAHs) are a class of anthropogenic, persistent and very toxic PAH contaminant associated with developmental toxicity. Abnormal glucose metabolism disturbs energy balances that impair the early development of vertebrates, but the mechanisms by which maternal OPAH exposure alters glucose homeostasis in offspring are not well understood. Studies have suggested that epigenetic changes, particularly in DNA methylation, provide a memory of plastic developmental responses to the environment, leading to the generation of novel offspring phenotypes. The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that embryonic exposure to low-dose OPAH can impair early Œ≤-cell differentiation in zebrafish (Danio rerio) by altering DNA methylation and gene expression. The zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1 and 3‚ÄØŒºM 9‚Äëfluorenone (9-FLO) at 3‚ÄØh postfertilization (hpf) until 120‚ÄØhpf to assess pancreatic organogenesis. 9-FLO exposure reduced total body length, eye length and heart rate, decreased insulin generation, interfered with glucose metabolism, and altered the expression of pancreatic organogenesis-related genes pdx-1, foxa2, isl1 and ptf1a. In particular, low-dose embryonic 9-FLO exposure significantly decreased Œ≤-cell differentiation marker gene pdx-1 mRNA levels, indicating that pancreatic endocrine is a more sensitive target response to embryonic low-dose OPAH exposure. Additionally, we found that DNA methyltransferases dnmt1 and dnmt3 were elevated and the DNA methylation at promoter regions of pdx-1 was increased at an early stage of development. These data demonstrated that the low-dose OPAH embryonic exposure can impair pancreatic endocrine development by increasing DNA methylation at the promoter regions of pdx-1 that are essential for Œ≤-cell differentiation.
The two most frequent types of endometrial cancer (EC) are endometrioid (EEC) and serous carcinomas (SC). Differential diagnosis between them is not always easy. A subset of endometrial cancers shows misleading microscopical features, which cause problems in differential diagnosis, and may be a good scenario for next-generation sequencing. Previous studies have assessed the usefulness of targeted sequencing with panels of generic cancer-associated genes in EC histological typing. Based on the analysis of TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas), EEC and SC have different mutational profiles. In this proof of principle study, we have performed targeted sequencing analysis with a customized panel, based on the TCGA mutational profile of EEC and SC, in a series of 24 tumors (16 EEC and 8 SC). Our panel comprised coding and non-coding sequences of the following genes: ABCC9, ARID1A, ARID5B, ATR, BCOR, CCND1, CDH19, CHD4, COL11A1, CSDE1, CSMD3, CTCF, CTNNB1, EP300, ERBB2, FBXW7, FGFR2, FOXA2, KLLN, KMT2B, KRAS, MAP3K4, MKI67, NRAS, PGAP3, PIK3CA, PIK3R1, PPP2R1A, PRPF18, PTEN, RPL22, SCARNA11, SIN3A, SMARCA4, SPOP, TAF1, TP53, TSPYL2, USP36, and WRAP53. Targeted sequencing validation by Sanger sequencing and immunohistochemistry was performed in a group of genes. POLE mutation status was assessed by Sanger sequencing. The most mutated genes were PTEN (93.7%), ARID1A (68.7%), PIK3CA (50%), and KMT2B (43.7%) for EEC, and TP53 (87.5%), PIK3CA (50%), and PPP2R1A (25%) for SC. Our panel allowed correct classification of all tumors in the two categories (EEC, SC). Coexistence of mutations in PTEN, ARID1A, and KMT2B was diagnostic of EEC. On the other hand, absence of PTEN, ARID1A, and KMT2B mutations in the presence of TP53 mutation was diagnostic of SC. This proof of concept study demonstrates the suitability of targeted sequencing with a customized endometrial cancer gene panel as an additional tool for confirming histological typing.
Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in ATP7B encoding a copper transporter. Consequent copper accumulation results in a variable WD clinical phenotype involving hepatic, neurologic, and psychiatric symptoms, without clear genotype-phenotype correlations. The goal of this study was to analyze alterations in DNA methylation at the whole-genome level in liver and blood from patients with WD to investigate epigenomic alterations associated with WD diagnosis and phenotype. We used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to examine distinct cohorts of WD subjects to determine whether DNA methylation could differentiate patients from healthy subjects and subjects with other liver diseases and distinguish between different WD phenotypes.
WGBS analyses in liver identified 969 hypermethylated and 871 hypomethylated differentially methylated regions (DMRs) specifically identifying patients with WD, including 18 regions with genome-wide significance. WD-specific liver DMRs were associated with genes enriched for functions in folate and lipid metabolism and acute inflammatory response and could differentiate early from advanced fibrosis in WD patients. Functional annotation revealed that WD-hypermethylated liver DMRs were enriched in liver-specific enhancers, flanking active liver promoters, and binding sites of liver developmental transcription factors, including Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4 alpha (HNF4A), Retinoid X Receptor alpha (RXRA), Forkhead Box A1 (FOXA1), and FOXA2. DMRs associated with WD progression were also identified, including 15 with genome-wide significance. However, WD DMRs in liver were not related to large-scale changes in proportions of liver cell types. DMRs detected in blood differentiated WD patients from healthy and disease control subjects, and distinguished between patients with hepatic and neurologic WD manifestations. WD phenotype DMRs corresponded to genes enriched for functions in mental deterioration, abnormal B cell physiology, and as members of the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). 44 DMRs associated with WD phenotype tested in a small validation cohort had a predictive value of 0.9.
We identified a disease-mechanism relevant epigenomic signature of WD that reveals new insights into potential biomarkers and treatments for this complex monogenic disease.
Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is an aggressive disease with high mortality and an overall 5-year survival rate of less than 20%. Barrett's esophagus (BE) is the only known precursor of EAC, and patients with BE have a persistent and excessive risk of EAC over time. Individuals with BE are up to 30-125 times more likely to develop EAC than the general population. Thus, early detection of EAC and BE could significantly improve the 5-year survival rate of EAC. Due to the limitations of endoscopic surveillance and the lack of clinical risk stratification strategies, molecular biomarkers should be considered and thoroughly investigated.
To explore the transcriptome changes in the progression from normal esophagus (NE) to BE and EAC.
Two datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) in NCBI Database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) were retrieved and used as a training and a test dataset separately, since NE, BE, and EAC samples were included and the sample sizes were adequate. This study identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the R/Bioconductor project and constructed trans-regulatory networks based on the Transcriptional Regulatory Element Database and Cytoscape software. Enrichment of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) terms was identified using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) Bioinformatics Resources. The diagnostic potential of certain DEGs was assessed in both datasets.
In the GSE1420 dataset, the number of up-regulated DEGs was larger than that of down-regulated DEGs when comparing EAC vs NE and BE vs NE. Among these DEGs, five differentially expressed transcription factors (DETFs) displayed the same trend in expression across all the comparison groups. Of these five DETFs, E2F3, FOXA2, and HOXB7 were up-regulated, while PAX9 and TFAP2C were down-regulated. Additionally, the majority of the DEGs in trans-regulatory networks were up-regulated. The intersection of these potential DEGs displayed the same direction of changes in expression when comparing the DEGs in the GSE26886 dataset to the DEGs in trans-regulatory networks above. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed for both datasets and found that TIMP1 and COL1A1 could discriminate EAC from NE tissue, while REG1A, MMP1, and CA2 could distinguish BE from NE tissue. DAVID annotation indicated that COL1A1 and MMP1 could be potent biomarkers for EAC and BE, respectively, since they participate in the majority of the enriched KEGG and GO terms that are important for inflammation and cancer.
After the construction and analyses of the trans-regulatory networks in EAC and BE, the results indicate that COL1A1 and MMP1 could be potential biomarkers for EAC and BE, respectively.
Transplantation of dopaminergic precursors (DPs) is a promising therapeutic strategy of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, limited cell source for dopaminergic precursors has become a major obstacle for transplantation therapy. Our group demonstrated previously that mouse fibroblasts can be reprogrammed into induced dopaminergic precursors (iDPs) with high differentiation efficiency. In the current study, we hypothesized that a similar strategy can be applied to generate human iDPs for future cell therapy of PD. We overexpressed transcription factors Brn2, Sox2, and Foxa2 in human fibroblasts and observed formation of neurospheres. Subsequent characterization of the precursor colonies confirmed the generation of human induced dopaminergic precursors (hiDPs). These hiDPs were capable of self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation. The hiDPs demonstrated high immunoreactivity for neural progenitor markers and high levels of gene expression for ventral mesencephalon-related neural progenitor markers such as Lmx1a, NIKX6.1, Corin, Otx2 and Mash1. Furthermore, the hiDPs could be differentiated into dopaminergic neurons with Àú80% efficiency, which significantly increased major functionally relevant proteins such as TH, DAT, AADC, Lmx1B, and VMAT2 compared to hiDPs. Additionally, hiDPs are more dopaminergic progenitor-restricted compare to those hiDP-like cells reprogrammed only by Brn2 and Sox2. Together, these results suggest that hiDPs with high differentiation efficiency can be generated by direct lineage reprogramming of fibroblasts with transcription factors Brn2, Sox2, and Foxa2. These hiDPs may serve as a safe and effective cell source for transplantation treatment of PD.
Neighboring enhancer of FOXA2 (NEF) is a newly discovered long non‚Äëcoding RNA (lncRNA) that serves an oncogenic function in the metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma, while its involvement in other types of cancer and in tumor cell proliferation remain unknown. In the present study, tumor tissues and adjacent healthy tissues were obtained from patients with gastric carcinoma, and blood was extracted from patients with gastric carcinoma and healthy controls. Expression of NEF in those tissues was detected using a reverse transcription‚Äëquantitative polymerase chain reaction. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic value of serum lncRNA NEF for gastric carcinoma. All patients were followed‚Äëup for 5¬†years following discharge, and survival curves were plotted to evaluate the diagnostic value of serum lncRNA‚ÄëNEF for gastric carcinoma. LncRNA‚ÄëNEF overexpression and small interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing cell lines were established and the effects on cell proliferation and runt‚Äërelated transcription factor 1 (Runx1) expression were detected using a Cell Counting Kit‚Äë8 assay and western blot analysis, respectively. It was revealed that NEF was significantly downregulated in tumor tissues compared with in adjacent tissues. Levels of circulation NEF in serum were lower in patients with gastric carcinoma compared with in healthy controls, and were decreased with the increasing stages of primary tumor. Serum NEF is a sensitive diagnostic and prognostic marker for gastric carcinoma. NEF siRNA silencing promoted, and overexpression inhibited, gastric carcinoma proliferation. In addition, NEF overexpression promoted, and NEF siRNA silencing inhibited, Runx1 expression. Therefore, it was concluded that lncRNA NEF may participate in the regulation of cancer cell proliferation by regulating Runx1 expression.
For the clinical application of stem cell therapy, functional enhancement is needed to increase the survival rate and the engraftment rate. The purpose of this study was to investigate functional enhancement of the paracrine effect using stem cells and hepatocyte-like cells and to minimize stem cell homing by using a scaffold system in a liver disease model.
A microporator was used to overexpress Foxa2 in adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs), which were cultured in a poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) scaffold. Later, the ADSCs were cultured in hepatic differentiation medium for 2 weeks by a 3-step method. For in vivo experiments, Foxa2-overexpressing ADSCs were loaded in the scaffold, cultured in hepatic differentiation medium and later were implanted in the dorsa of nude mice subjected to acute liver injury (thioacetamide intraperitoneal injection).
Foxa2-overexpressing ADSCs showed greater increases in hepatocyte-specific gene markers (alpha fetoprotein [AFP], cytokeratin 18 [CK18], and albumin), cytoplasmic glycogen storage, and cytochrome P450 expression than cells that underwent the conventional differentiation method. In vivo experiments using the nude mouse model showed that 2 weeks after scaffold implantation, the mRNA expression of AFP, CK18, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (CD26), and connexin 32 (CX32) was higher in the Foxa2-overexpressing ADSCs group than in the ADSCs group. The Foxa2-overexpressing ADSCs scaffold treatment group showed attenuated liver injury without stem cell homing in the thioacetamide-induced acute liver injury model.
Foxa2-overexpressing ADSCs applied in a scaffold system enhanced hepatocyte-like differentiation and attenuated acute liver damage in an acute liver injury model without homing effects.
Gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) is important for maintaining the pluripotency of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC). However, human ESC (hESC) have a high level of connexin (Cx) molecules with unknown function. In this study, we found that the major Cx molecule, Cx43, was highly expressed in undifferentiated hESC. It was down-regulated upon spontaneously differentiation by embryoid body formation and induced differentiation along ectoderm, mesoderm and extraembryonic lineages, but up-regulated along endoderm differentiation. The knockdown of Cx43 and GJIC had no effect on the maintenance of hESC, as demonstrated by no morphological changes and similar expression levels of pluripotent markers (OCT4, NANOG, SSEA-3 and SSEA-4) and early differentiation markers (KRT8 and KRT18). Meanwhile, Cx43 knock down had no effect on endodermal markers (SOX17, FOXA2 and CXCR4) expression when hESC were differentiating into definitive endoderm lineage. On the contrary, it led to lower levels of mesodermal markers (CD56, CD34 and PDGFR-Œ±) when cells were undergoing mesoderm differentiation. When compared to control, Cx43 knockdown led to higher attachment rate, HCG secretion and cell invasion of the hESC derived trophoblastic cells. Cx43 knockdown also resulted in up-regulated expressions of placental hormone (Œ≤-hCG) and implantation related genes (LIFR, CDH5, LEP, PGF, TGFBR2). Our study suggested that Cx43 and GJIC had no effect on the undifferentiated growth of hESC but affected specific lineage differentiation.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are nuclear receptors that regulate macrophage cholesterol efflux by inducing ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and ABCG1/ABCG4 gene expression. The Niemann-Pick C (NPC) proteins NPC1 and NPC2 are located in the late endosome, where they control cholesterol trafficking to the plasma membrane. The mobilization of cholesterol from intracellular pools to the plasma membrane is a determinant governing its availability for efflux to extracellular acceptors. Here we investigated the influence of LXR activation on intracellular cholesterol trafficking in primary human macrophages. Synthetic LXR activators increase the amount of free cholesterol in the plasma membrane by inducing NPC1 and NPC2 gene expression. Moreover, ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux induced by LXR activators was drastically decreased in the presence of progesterone, which blocks postlysosomal cholesterol trafficking, and reduced when NPC1 and NPC2 mRNA expression was depleted using small interfering RNA. The stimulation of cholesterol mobilization to the plasma membrane by LXRs led to a decrease in cholesteryl ester formation and Acyl-coenzyme A cholesterol acyltransferase-1 activity. These data indicate that LXR activation enhances cholesterol trafficking to the plasma membrane, where it becomes available for efflux, at the expense of esterification, thus contributing to the overall effects of LXR agonists in the control of macrophage cholesterol homeostasis.
ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) mediates the rate-limiting step in high density lipoprotein (HDL) particle formation, and its expression is regulated primarily by oxysterol-dependent activation of liver X receptors. We previously reported that ABCA1 expression and HDL formation are impaired in the lysosomal cholesterol storage disorder Niemann-Pick disease type C1 and that plasma HDL-C is low in the majority of Niemann-Pick disease type C patients. Here, we show that ABCA1 regulation and activity are also impaired in cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD), caused by mutations in the LIPA gene that result in less than 5% of normal lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) activity. Fibroblasts from patients with CESD showed impaired up-regulation of ABCA1 in response to low density lipoprotein (LDL) loading, reduced phospholipid and cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein A-I, and reduced Œ±-HDL particle formation. Treatment of normal fibroblasts with chloroquine to inhibit LAL activity reduced ABCA1 expression and activity, similar to that of CESD cells. Liver X receptor agonist treatment of CESD cells corrected ABCA1 expression but failed to correct LDL cholesteryl ester hydrolysis and cholesterol efflux to apoA-I. LDL-induced production of 27-hydroxycholesterol was reduced in CESD compared with normal fibroblasts. Treatment with conditioned medium containing LAL from normal fibroblasts or with recombinant human LAL rescued ABCA1 expression, apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux, HDL particle formation, and production of 27-hydroxycholesterol by CESD cells. These results provide further evidence that the rate of release of cholesterol from late endosomes/lysosomes is a critical regulator of ABCA1 expression and activity, and an explanation for the hypoalphalipoproteinemia seen in CESD patients.
Niemann Pick disease type C1 (NPC) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by progressive neurological deterioration leading to premature death. In this study, we hypothesized that human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSCs) have the multifunctional  abilities to ameliorate NPC symptoms in the brain. To test this hypothesis, hUCB-MSCs were transplanted into the hippocampus of NPC mice in the early asymptomatic stage. This transplantation resulted in the recovery of motor function in the Rota Rod test and impaired cholesterol homeostasis  leading to increased levels of cholesterol efflux-related genes such as LXRŒ±, ABCA1, and ABCG5 while decreased levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase were observed in NPC mice. In the cerebrum, hUCB-MSCs enhanced neuronal cell survival and proliferation, where they  directly differentiated into electrically active MAP2-positive neurons as demonstrated by whole-cell patch clamping. In addition, we observed that hUCB-MSCs reduced Purkinje neuronal loss by suppression of inflammatory and apoptotic signaling in the cerebellum as shown by immunohistochemistry.  We further investigated how hUCB-MSCs enhance cellular survival and inhibit apoptosis in NPC mice. Neuronal cell survival was associated with increased PI3K/AKT and JAK2/STAT3 signaling; moreover, hUCB-MSCs modulated the levels of GABA/glutamate transporters such as GAT1, EAAT2, EAAT3, and  GAD6 in NPC mice as assessed by Western blot analysis. Taken together, our findings suggest that hUCB-MSCs might play multifunctional roles in neuronal cell survival and ameliorating motor deficits of NPC mice.
Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) promotes the transport of LDL receptor (LDL-R)-derived cholesterol from late endosomes/lysosomes to other cellular compartments. NPC1-deficient cells showed impaired regulation of liver_X receptor (LXR) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) target genes. We observed that Apoe(-/-)Npc1(-/-) mice displayed a marked increase in total plasma cholesterol mainly due to increased VLDL, reflecting decreased clearance. Although nuclear SREBP-2 and Ldlr mRNA levels were increased in Apoe(-/-)Npc1(-/-) liver, LDL-R protein levels were decreased in association with marked induction of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (Pcsk9) and inducible degrader of the LDL-R (Idol), both known to promote proteolytic degradation of LDL-R. While Pcsk9 is known to be an SREBP-2 target, marked upregulation of IDOL in Apoe(-/-)Npc1(-/-) liver was unexpected. However, several other LXR target genes also increased in Apoe(-/-)Npc1(-/-) liver, suggesting increased synthesis of endogenous LXR ligands secondary to activation of sterol biosynthesis. In conclusion, we demonstrate that NPC1 deficiency has a major impact on VLDL metabolism in Apoe(-/-) mice through modulation of hepatic LDL-R protein levels. In contrast to modest induction of hepatic IDOL with synthetic LXR ligands, a striking upregulation of IDOL in Apoe(-/-)Npc1(-/-) mice could indicate a role of endogenous LXR ligands in regulation of hepatic IDOL.
Insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are characterized by hyperlipidemia. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether T2D contributes to abnormal cholesterol (CHOL) homeostasis. Experiments were carried out in the small intestine and liver of Psammomys obesus, a model of nutritionally induced T2D. Our results show that diabetic animals exhibited a lower intestinal CHOL uptake, which was associated with a decrease in 1) the gene and protein expression of Niemann-Pick C1 like 1 that plays a pivotal role in CHOL incorporation in the enterocytes; and 2) mRNA of ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC)A1 that mediates CHOL efflux from intestinal cells to apolipoprotein A-I and high-density lipoprotein. No changes were observed in the other intestinal transporters scavenger receptor-class B type I (SR-BI) and annexin 2. On the other hand, in diabetic animals, a significant mRNA decrease was noticed in intestinal ABCG5 and ABCG8 responsible for the secretion of absorbed CHOL back into the lumen. Furthermore, jejunal PCSK9 protein was diminished and low-density lipoprotein receptor was raised, along with a significant down-regulation in jejunal 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase in P. obesus with T2D. Finally, among the transcription factors tested, only an increase in liver X receptors alpha and a decrease in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors delta/beta mRNAs were detected in the intestine. In the liver, there was 1) an augmentation in the protein mass of Niemann-Pick C1 like 1, SR-BI, and annexin 2; 2) an up-regulation of SR-BI mRNA; 3) a fall in ABCG8 protein content as well as in ABCG5 and ABCA1 mRNA; and 4) an augmentation in liver X receptors alpha and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors beta/delta mRNA, together with a drop in sterol regulatory element binding protein-2 protein. Our findings show that the development in P. obesus with T2D modifies the whole intraenterocyte and hepatocyte machinery responsible for CHOL homeostasis.
The synthetic sphingosine analog FTY720 is undergoing clinical trials as an immunomodulatory compound, acting primarily via sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor activation. Sphingolipid and cholesterol homeostasis are closely connected but whether FTY720 affects atherogenesis in humans is not known.
We examined the effects of FTY720 on the processing of scavenged lipoprotein cholesterol in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages.
FTY720 did not affect cholesterol uptake but inhibited its delivery to the endoplasmic reticulum, reducing cellular free cholesterol cytotoxicity. This was accompanied by increased levels of Niemann-Pick C1 protein (NPC1) and ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC)A1 proteins and increased efflux of endosomal cholesterol to apolipoprotein A-I. These effects were not dependent on sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor activation. Instead, FTY720 stimulated the production of 27-hydroxycholesterol, an endogenous ligand of the liver X receptor, leading to liver X receptor-induced upregulation of ABCA1. Fluorescently labeled FTY720 was targeted to late endosomes, and the FTY720-induced upregulation of ABCA1 was NPC1-dependent, but the endosomal exit of FTY720 itself was not.
We conclude that FTY720 decreases cholesterol toxicity in primary human macrophages by reducing the delivery of scavenged lipoprotein cholesterol to the endoplasmic reticulum and facilitating its release to physiological extracellular acceptors. Furthermore, FTY720 stimulates 27-hydroxycholesterol production, providing an explanation for the atheroprotective effects and identifying a novel mechanism by which FTY720 modulates signaling.
Elevated blood cholesterol is an important risk factor associated with atherosclerosis and CHD. The search for mediators that fine tune cholesterol homeostasis has recognised probiotics as being potentially beneficial. Here, we present data describing bacterial regulation of Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), which, when weakly expressed, results in a marked reduction in intestinal absorption of cholesterol. The probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 reduced NPC1L1 gene expression and inhibited the cellular uptake of micellar cholesterol in Caco-2 cells. Soluble effector molecules secreted by ATCC 4356 were shown to be responsible for the decrease in NPC1L1. Furthermore, ATCC 4356 mediated this effect partly through the liver X receptors (LXR). The role of NPC1L1 and the LXR in cholesterol metabolism underscores the basis for the use of probiotics, such as ATCC 4356, in managing hypercholesterolaemia.
The Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) protein regulates the transport of cholesterol from late endosomes/lysosomes to other compartments responsible for maintaining intracellular cholesterol homeostasis. Liver X receptors (LXRs) operate as cholesterol sensors which may protect from cholesterol overload by increasing the amount of free cholesterol in the plasma membrane through inducing NPC1 expression. NO-1886 has been proven to be highly effective at increasing liver X receptor alpha expression and promoting cellular cholesterol efflux. In this study, the effects of NO-1886 on NPC1 expression were investigated in THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells.
Results showed that NO-1886 markedly increased expression of NPC1 at both mRNA level and protein level in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Cellular cholesterol content was decreased while cholesterol efflux was increased by NO-1886 treatment. In addition, LXR alpha was also up-regulated by NO-1886 treatment. And LXR alpha small interfering RNA completely abolished the promotion effect which was induced by NO-1886.
These results provide evidence that NO-1886 up-regulates expression of NPC1 through LXR alpha pathway in THP-1 macrophage- derived foam cells.
Fibrates, including fenofibrate, exert their biological effects by binding peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors. Treatment with PPARalpha agonists enhances fatty acid oxidation, decreases plasma triglycerides, and may promote reverse cholesterol transport. In addition, fibrate administration can reduce intestinal cholesterol absorption in patients, although the molecular mechanism for this effect is unknown. Because Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) is already known to be a critical protein for cholesterol absorption, we hypothesized that fenofibrate might modulate NPC1L1 expression to alter intestinal cholesterol transport. Here, we find that fenofibrate-treated wild-type mice have decreased fractional cholesterol absorption (35-47% decrease) and increased fecal neutral sterol excretion (51-83% increase), which correspond to decreased expression of NPC1L1 mRNA and protein (38-66% decrease) in the proximal small intestine. These effects of fenofibrate are dependent on PPARalpha, as Ppar alpha-knockout mice fail to respond like wild-type littermates. Fenofibrate affects the ezetimibe-sensitive pathway and retains the ability to decrease cholesterol absorption and NPC1L1 mRNA expression in chow-fed liver X receptor alpha/beta-double-knockout mice and high-cholesterol- or cholic acid-fed wild-type mice. These data demonstrate that fenofibrate specifically acts via PPARalpha to decrease cholesterol absorption at the level of intestinal NPC1L1 expression.
Constitutive expression of a cholesterol-7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) transgene in LDL receptor-deficient mice blocked the ability of a cholesterol-enriched diet to increase plasma levels of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins. LDL receptor-deficient mice expressing the CYP7A1 transgene exhibited complete resistance to diet-induced hypercholesterolemia and to the accumulation of cholesterol in the liver. Hepatic mRNA expression of liver X receptor-inducible ABCG5 and ABCG8 was decreased in CYP7A1 transgenic, LDL receptor-deficient mice fed a cholesterol-enriched diet. Thus, increased biliary cholesterol excretion could not account for the maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis. CYP7A1 transgenic, LDL receptor-deficient mice fed the cholesterol-enriched diet exhibited decreased jejunal Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 protein (NPC1L1) mRNA expression, an important mediator of intestinal cholesterol absorption. A taurocholate-enriched diet also decreased NPC1L1 mRNA expression in a farnesoid X receptor-independent manner. Reduced expression of NPC1L1 mRNA was associated with decreased cholesterol absorption ( approximately 20%; P &lt; 0.05) exhibited by CYP7A1 transgenic LDL receptor-deficient mice fed the cholesterol-enriched diet. The combined data show that enhanced expression of CYP7A1 is an effective means to prevent the accumulation of cholesterol in the liver and of atherogenic apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins in plasma.
Niemann-Pick C1 like 1 (NPC1L1) is a protein critical for intestinal cholesterol absorption. The nuclear receptors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) and liver X receptors (LXRalpha and LXRbeta) are major regulators of cholesterol homeostasis and their activation results in a reduced absorption of intestinal cholesterol. The goal of this study was to define the role of PPARalpha and LXR nuclear receptors in the regulation of NPC1L1 gene expression. We show that LXR activators down-regulate NPC1L1 mRNA levels in the human enterocyte cell line Caco-2/TC7, whereas PPARalpha ligands have no effect. Furthermore, NPC1L1 mRNA levels are decreased in vivo, in duodenum of mice treated with the LXR agonist T0901317. In conclusion, the present study identifies NPC1L1 as a novel LXR target gene further supporting a crucial role of LXR in intestinal cholesterol homeostasis.
Recent insights in the role of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters ABCG5 and ABCG8, the discovery of ezetimibe, the first approved direct cholesterol absorption inhibitor, as well as the identification of Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1 (NPC1L1) protein as sterol transporter in the gut, focused attention on sterol transport processes in the small intestine and the liver. The identification of defective structures in the ABCG5 or ABCG8 transporters in patients with the rare disease of sitosterolemia elucidated their role as sterol efflux pumps regulating at least in parts the intestinal sterol absorption and the hepatic sterol output. ABCG5 and ABCG8 themselves are regulated by cholesterol via liver X receptors (LXRs), which are also activated by oxysterols and some derivatives of plant sterols. NPC1L1 could recently be identified as a major sterol transporter for the intestinal uptake of cholesterol as well as plant sterols. Studies in NPC1L1 knockout mice indicate that this transporter is essential for the intestinal uptake of sterols and that NPC1L1 might also be involved in the mechanism of action of ezetimibe. However, studies with photoreactive cholesterol as well as with photoreactive ezetimibe analogues suggest that other processes might also be involved in the mechanism of action of ezetimibe.
Mutations in the Niemann-Pick disease genes cause lysosomal cholesterol accumulation and impaired low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol esterification. These findings have been attributed to a block in cholesterol movement from lysosomes to the site of the sterol regulatory machinery. In this study we show that Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) and Niemann-Pick type C2 (NPC2) mutants have increased cellular cholesterol, yet they are unable to suppress LDL receptor activity and cholesterol biosynthesis. Cholesterol overload in both NPC1 and NPC2 mutants results from the failure of LDL cholesterol tobothsuppresssterolregulatoryelement-bindingprotein-dependent gene expression and promote liver X receptor-mediated responses. However, the severity of the defect in regulation of sterol homeostasis does not correlate with endoplasmic reticulum cholesterol levels, but rather with the degree to which NPC mutant fibroblasts fail to appropriately generate 25-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol in response to LDL cholesterol. Moreover, we demonstrate that treatment with oxysterols reduces cholesterol in NPC mutants and is able to correct the NPC1I1061T phenotype, the most prevalent NPC1 disease genotype. Our findings support a role for NPC1 and NPC2 in the regulation of sterol homeostasis through generation of LDL cholesterol-derived oxysterols and have important implications for the treatment of NPC disease.
In this study, we studied the effect of liver X receptor (LXR) agonist T0901317 on Niemann-Pick C1 protein (NPC1) expression in apoE-/- mice. Male apoE-/- mice were randomized into 4 groups, baseline group (n=10), control group (n = 14), treatment group (n = 14) and prevention group (n = 14). All of the mice were fed with a high-fat/high-cholesterol (HFHC) diet containing 15% fat and 0.25% cholesterol. The baseline group treated with vehicle was sacrificed after 8 weeks of the diet. The control group and the prevention group were treated with either vehicle or T0901317 daily by oral gavage for 14 weeks. The treatment group was treated with vehicle for 8 weeks, and then was treated with the agonist T0901317 for additional 6 weeks. Gene and protein expression was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting, respectively. Plasma lipid concentrations were measured by commercially enzymatic methods. We used RNA interference technology to silence NPC1 gene expression in THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells and then detected the effect of LXR agonist T0901317 on cholesterol efflux. Plasma triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apoA-I concentrations were markedly increased in T0901317-treated groups. T0901317 treatment reduced the aortic atherosclerotic lesion area by 64.2% in the prevention group and 58.3% in the treatment group. LXR agonist treatment increased NPC1 mRNA expression and protein levels in the small intestine, liver and aorta of apoE-/- mice. Compared with the normal cells, cholesterol efflux of siRNA THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells was significantly decreased, whereas cholesterol efflux of LXR agonist T0901317-treated THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells was significantly increased. Our results suggest that LXR agonist T0901317 inhibits atherosclerosis development in apoE-/- mice, which is related to up-regulating NPC1 expression.
Although a range of studies indicated Liver X receptor (LXR) activation inhibited the development of atherosclerosis in animal models, the mechanism of this effect for LXR agonists has not been fully understood. A recent study has suggested LXR activators increased the amount of free cholesterol in the plasma membrane of human macrophages by inducing Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) gene expression. Therefore, we hypothesize that LXRs may also promote NPC1 expression in vivo. Here we investigated the effect of a synthetic LXR agonist T0901317 on ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and NPC1 in apolipoprotein E knockout (apoE-/-) mice. Male apoE-/- mice were randomized into four groups: baseline group (n = 10), vehicle group (n = 14), prevention group (n = 14), and treatment group (n = 14). En face analysis and Oil red O staining were used to examine the aortic atherosclerotic lesions. Macrophage content of aortic root atherosclerotic lesions and cholesterol efflux form peritoneal macrophages were measured. Gene and protein expression was analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, respectively. T0901317 treatment reduced aortic atherosclerotic lesion area by 64.2% in prevention group (P &lt; 0.001) and 58.3% in treatment group (P &lt; 0.001) and resulted in a reduction in macrophage content. Plasma triglyceride, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apoA-I concentrations were markedly increased in T0901317-treated groups. T0901317 also promoted ABCA1 and NPC1 gene and protein levels in the aorta, liver, and small intestine of apoE-/- mice and significantly increased cholesterol efflux from peritoneal macrophages. T0901317 upregulates ABCA1 and NPC1. This study gives us a new insight into the mechanism for antiatherogenic effect of LXR synthetic agonists.
Transporters present in the epithelium of the small intestine determine the efficiency by which dietary and biliary cholesterol are taken up into the body and thus control whole-body cholesterol balance. Niemann-Pick C1 Like Protein 1 (Npc1l1) transports cholesterol into the enterocyte, whereas ATP-binding cassette transporters Abca1 and Abcg5/Abcg8 are presumed to be involved in cholesterol efflux from the enterocyte toward plasma HDL and back into the intestinal lumen, respectively. Abca1, Abcg5, and Abcg8 are well-established liver X receptor (LXR) target genes. We examined the effects of a high-fat diet on expression and function of cholesterol transporters in the small intestine in mice. Npc1l1, Abca1, Abcg5, and Abcg8 were all downregulated after 2, 4, and 8 wk on a cholesterol-free, high-fat diet. The high-fat diet did not affect biliary cholesterol secretion but diminished fractional cholesterol absorption from 61 to 42% (P &lt; 0.05). In an acute experiment in which triacylglycerols of unsaturated fatty acids were given by gavage, we found that this downregulation occurs within a 6-h time frame. Studies in LXRalpha-null mice, confirmed by in vitro data, showed that fatty acid-induced downregulation of cholesterol transporters is LXRalpha independent and associated with a posttranslational increase in 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase activity that reflects induction of cholesterol biosynthesis as well as with a doubling of neutral fecal sterol loss. This study highlights the induction of adaptive changes in small intestinal cholesterol metabolism during exposure to dietary fat.
Administration of beta-sitosterol (42 mg/kg per day) for 3 weeks to 8-month-old male LXRbeta-/- mice resulted in the death of motor neurons in the lumbar region of the spinal cord and loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. In mice at 5 months of age, beta-sitosterol had no observed toxicity but at 16 months of age, it caused severe paralysis and symptoms typical of dopaminergic dysfunction in LXRbeta-/- mice. WT mice were not affected by these doses of beta-sitosterol. In 5-month-old mice, levels of the intestinal transporters, ABCG5/8 and Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1, were not affected by loss of liver X receptor (LXR) beta and/or treatment with beta-sitosterol nor were there changes in plasma levels of cholesterol or beta-sitosterol. In 8-month-old LXRbeta-/- mice there was activation of microglia in the substantia nigra pars reticulata and aggregates of ubiquitin and TDP-43 in the cytoplasm of large motor neurons in the lumbar spinal cord. Brain cholesterol concentrations were higher in LXRbeta-/- than in their WT counterparts, and treatment with beta-sitosterol reduced brain cholesterol in both WT and LXRbeta-/- mice. In LXRbeta-/- mice but not in WT mice levels of 24-hydrocholesterol were increased upon beta-sitosterol treatment. These data indicate that multiple mechanisms are involved in the sensitivity of LXRbeta-/- mice to beta-sitosterol. These include activation of microglia, accumulation of protein aggregates in the cytoplasm of large motor neurons, and depletion of brain cholesterol.
Dyslipidemic patients with diabetes mellitus, including metabolic syndrome, are at increased risk of coronary heart disease. It has been reported that ezetimibe, a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, improves metabolic diseases in mice and humans. However, the underlying mechanism has been unclear. Here we explored the effects of ezetimibe on lipid and glucose homeostasis. Male KK-A(y) mice were fed a high-fat diet, which is the mouse model of metabolic syndrome, with or without ezetimibe for 14 weeks. Ezetimibe improved dyslipidemia, steatosis, and insulin resistance. Ezetimibe decreased hepatic oxysterols, which are endogenous agonists of liver X receptor (LXR), to decrease hepatic lipogenic gene expressions, especially in stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), leading to a remarkable reduction of hepatic oleate content that would contribute to the improvement of steatosis by reducing triglycerides and cholesterol esters. Simultaneously, hepatic Œ≤-oxidation, NADPH oxidase and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) were reduced, and thus reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokines were also decreased. Consistent with these changes, ezetimibe diminished c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation and improved insulin signaling in the liver. In vitro study using primary hepatocytes obtained from male SD rats, treated with oleate and LXR agonist, showed excess lipid accumulation, increased oxidative stress and impaired insulin signaling. Therefore, in obese subjects, ezetimibe reduces hepatic LXR activity by reducing hepatic oxysterols to lower hepatic oleate content. This improves steatosis and reduces oxidative stress, and this reduction improves insulin signaling in the liver. These results provide insight into pathogenesis and strategies for treatment of the metabolic syndrome. 
The Niemann-Pick disease, type C1 (NPC1) gene encodes a transmembrane protein involved in cholesterol efflux from the lysosome. SNPs within NPC1 have been associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes, and mice heterozygous or null for NPC1 are insulin resistant. However, the molecular mechanism underpinning this association is currently undefined. This study aimed to investigate the effects of inhibiting NPC1 function on insulin action in adipocytes. Both pharmacological and genetic inhibition of NPC1 impaired insulin action. This impairment was evident at the level of insulin signalling and insulin-mediated glucose transport in the short term and decreased GLUT4 expression due to reduced liver X receptor (LXR) transcriptional activity in the long-term. These data show that cholesterol homeostasis through NPC1 plays a crucial role in maintaining insulin action at multiple levels in adipocytes. 
We investigated whether: (1) liver X receptor (LXR)-driven induction of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and other LXR-mediated effects on cholesterol metabolism depend on intestinal cholesterol absorption; and (2) combined treatment with the LXR agonist GW3965 and the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe results in synergistic effects on cholesterol metabolism that could be beneficial for treatment of atherosclerosis. Mice were fed 0.2¬†% cholesterol and treated with GW3965+ezetimibe, GW3965 or ezetimibe. GW3965+ezetimibe treatment elevated serum HDL-C and Apolipoprotein (Apo) AI, effectively reduced the intestinal cholesterol absorption and increased the excretion of faecal neutral sterols. No changes in intestinal ATP-binding cassette (ABC) A1 or ABCG5 protein expression were observed, despite increased mRNA expression, while hepatic ABCA1 was slightly reduced. The combined treatment caused a pronounced down-regulation of intestinal Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) and reduced hepatic and intestinal cholesterol levels. GW3965 did not affect the intestinal cholesterol absorption, but increased serum HDL-C and ApoAI levels. GW3965 also increased Apoa1 mRNA levels in primary mouse hepatocytes and HEPA1-6 cells. Ezetimibe reduced the intestinal cholesterol absorption, ABCA1 and ABCG5, but did not affect the serum HDL-C or ApoAI levels. Thus, the LXR-driven induction of HDL-C and ApoAI was independent of the intestinal cholesterol absorption and increased expression of intestinal or hepatic ABCA1 was not required. Inhibited influx of cholesterol via NPC1L1 and/or low levels of intracellular cholesterol prevented post-transcriptional expression of intestinal ABCA1 and ABCG5, despite increased mRNA levels. Combined LXR activation and blocked intestinal cholesterol absorption induced effective faecal elimination of cholesterol. 
The CD36 selective ligand, EP 80317, features potent anti-atherosclerotic and hypocholesterolemic effects that are associated with an increase in macrophage cholesterol efflux through the activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Œ≥-liver X receptor Œ± (LXRŒ±)-ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter pathway. Cholesterol efflux is the first step of reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). However, whether EP 80317 exerts its hypocholesterolemic and anti-atherosclerotic activity through RCT in vivo has yet to be determined. In the present study, we investigated the effects of EP 80317 on RCT, in particular on macrophage-to-feces RCT and the expression of selected genes associated with hepatic cholesterol metabolism and intestinal cholesterol transport.
Reverse cholesterol transport was assessed following the intraperitoneal injection of [(3)H]-cholesterol-labelled J774 macrophages to hypercholesterolemic apoE- and apoE/CD36 double-deficient mice that had been treated for 12 weeks with EP 80317. Forty-eight hours after the administration of [(3)H]-cholesterol-labelled cells, blood, liver, intestines and feces were harvested. The radioactivity recovered in the feces (cholesterol and bile acid combined) was significantly increased by 311% (P = 0.0259) in EP 80317-treated mice compared with that found in vehicle-treated mice despite no significant change in [(3)H]-tracer recovery in plasma between groups. Whereas the mRNA levels of LXRŒ± in the gut were significantly upregulated, mRNA and protein levels of the Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 protein (NPC1L1) transporter, a LXRŒ± target which regulates intestinal cholesterol absorption, were downregulated in EP 80317-treated mice. In contrast, neither mRNA nor protein levels of investigated transporters and receptors were modulated in the small intestine of double-deficient mice, nor was the fecal recovery of radioactivity. No change was observed in targeted genes in liver of either apoE- or apoE/CD36 double-deficient mice after a chronic treatment with EP 80317.
This study shows that EP 80317 elicits macrophage-to-feces reverse cholesterol transport in a manner dependent on CD36 expression. This effect is associated with the upregulation of LXRŒ± and the downregulation of NPC1L1 expression.
JNJ-26854165 (serdemetan) has previously been reported to inhibit the function of the E3 ligase human double minute 2, and we initially sought to characterize its activity in models of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and multiple myeloma (MM). Serdemetan induced a dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation in both wild-type (wt) and mutant (mut) p53 cell lines, with IC50 values from 0.25 to 3 ŒºM/l, in association with an S phase cell cycle arrest. Caspase-3 activation was primarily seen in wtp53-bearing cells but also occurred in mutp53-bearing cells, albeit to a lesser extent. 293T cells treated with JNJ-26854165 and serdemetan-resistant fibroblasts displayed accumulation of cholesterol within endosomes, a phenotype reminiscent of that seen in the ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member-1 (ABCA1) cholesterol transport disorder, Tangiers disease. MM and MCL cells had decreased cholesterol efflux and electron microscopy demonstrated the accumulation of lipid whorls, confirming the lysosomal storage disease phenotype. JNJ-26854165 induced induction of cholesterol regulatory genes, sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor-1 and -2, liver X receptors Œ± and Œ≤, along with increased expression of Niemann-Pick disease type-C1 and -C2. However, JNJ-26854165 induced enhanced ABCA1 turnover despite enhancing transcription. Finally, ABCA1 depletion resulted in enhanced sensitivity to JNJ-26854165. Overall, these findings support the hypothesis that serdemetan functions in part by inhibiting cholesterol transport and that this pathway is a potential new target for the treatment of MCL and MM. 
The human Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) gene has been found to be associated with extreme (early-onset and morbid-adult) obesity and type 2 diabetes independent of body weight. We previously performed growth studies using BALB/cJ Npc1 normal (Npc1+/+) and Npc1 heterozygous (Npc1+/-) mice and determined that decreased Npc1 gene dosage interacts with a high-fat diet to promote weight gain and adiposity. The present study was performed using both BALB/cJ and C57BL/6J Npc1+/+ and Npc1+/- mice to determine if decreased Npc1 gene dosage predisposes to metabolic features associated with type 2 diabetes. The results indicated that C57BL/6J Npc1+/- mice, but not BALB/cJ Npc1+/- mice, have impaired glucose tolerance when fed a low-fat diet and independent of body weight. The results also suggest that an accumulation of liver free fatty acids and hepatic lipotoxicity marked by an elevation in the amount of plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) may be responsible for hepatic insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance. Finally, the peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor Œ± (PPARŒ±) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) pathways known to have a central role in regulating free fatty acid metabolism were downregulated in the livers, but not in the adipose or muscle, of C57BL/6J Npc1+/- mice compared to C57BL/6J Npc1+/+ mice. Therefore, decreased Npc1 gene dosage among two different mouse strains interacts with undefined modifying genes to manifest disparate yet often related metabolic diseases.
Psychological stress is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. However, the connecting mechanisms of the stress-inducing activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis with atherosclerosis are not well-understood.
To study the effect of acute psychological stress on reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), which transfers peripheral cholesterol to the liver for its ultimate fecal excretion.
C57Bl/6J mice were exposed to restraint stress for 3 hours to induce acute psychological stress. RCT in vivo was quantified by measuring the transfer of [(3)H]cholesterol from intraperitoneally injected mouse macrophages to the lumen of the small intestine within the stress period. Surprisingly, stress markedly increased the contents of macrophage-derived [(3)H]cholesterol in the intestinal lumen. In the stressed mice, intestinal absorption of [(14)C]cholesterol was significantly impaired, the intestinal mRNA expression level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Œ± increased, and that of the sterol influx transporter Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 decreased. The stress-dependent effects on RCT rate and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Œ± gene expression were fully mimicked by administration of the stress hormone corticosterone (CORT) to nonstressed mice, and they were blocked by the inhibition of CORT synthesis in stressed mice. Moreover, the intestinal expression of Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 protein decreased when circulating levels of CORT increased. Of note, when either peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Œ± or liver X receptor Œ± knockout mice were exposed to stress, the RCT rate remained unchanged, although plasma CORT increased. This indicates that activities of both transcription factors were required for the RCT-accelerating effect of stress.
Acute psychological stress accelerated RCT by compromising intestinal cholesterol absorption. The present results uncover a novel functional connection between the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and RCT that can be triggered by a stress-induced increase in circulating CORT.
Nuclear receptors (NRs) play crucial roles in the regulation of hepatic cholesterol synthesis, metabolism, and conversion to bile acids, but their actions in cholangiocytes have not been examined. In this study, we investigated the roles of NRs in cholangiocyte physiology and cholesterol metabolism and flux. We examined the expression of NRs and other genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis in freshly isolated and cultured murine cholangiocytes and found that these cells express a specific subset of NRs, including liver X receptor (LXR) Œ≤ and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) Œ¥. Activation of LXRŒ≤ and/or PPARŒ¥ in cholangiocytes induces ATP-binding cassette cholesterol transporter A1 (ABCA1) and increases cholesterol export at the basolateral compartment in polarized cultured cholangiocytes. In addition, PPARŒ¥ induces Niemann-Pick C1-like L1 (NPC1L1), which imports cholesterol into cholangiocytes and is expressed on the apical cholangiocyte membrane via specific interaction with a peroxisome proliferator-activated response element (PPRE) within the NPC1L1 promoter.
We propose that (1) LXRŒ≤ and PPARŒ¥ coordinate NPC1L1/ABCA1-dependent vectorial cholesterol flux from bile through cholangiocytes and (2) manipulation of these processes may influence bile composition with important applications in cholestatic liver disease and gallstone disease, two serious health concerns for humans.
Previous work demonstrated that intestinal cholesterol absorption and regulated expression of intestinal Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 and ATP-binding cassette protein A1 are required for liver X receptor (LXR) agonist-mediated increases in high-density lipoprotein biogenesis. We re-examined those conclusions in mice with intestine-specific deletion of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP-IKO), where chylomicron formation is eliminated.
MTTP-IKO mice demonstrated sustained ‚âà90% reduction in cholesterol absorption and &gt;80% reduction in Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 expression, yet LXR agonist treatment increased serum high-density lipoprotein and upregulated intestinal ATP-binding cassette protein A1 expression. Hepatic lipogenesis and triglyceride content increased with LXR agonist treatment in both genotypes. Biliary cholesterol secretion was increased in MTTP-IKO mice without further increase upon LXR agonist administration. LXR agonist treatment caused a paradoxical increase in cholesterol absorption in MTTP-IKO mice and decreased fecal neutral sterol excretion, but to levels that still exceeded fecal neutral sterol excretion in LXR agonist-treated control mice. Finally, MTTP-IKO mice demonstrated indistinguishable patterns of increased cholesterol turnover and efflux after intravenous radiolabeled cholesterol administration, with or without LXR agonist treatment.
Both intestinal and hepatic cholesterol efflux pathways are basally upregulated in MTTP-IKO mice. Moreover, LXR-dependent pathways modulate intestinal cholesterol absorption, transport, efflux, and high-density lipoprotein production independent of chylomicron assembly and secretion.
Intestinal cholesterol absorption includes intestinal Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) and is an important target pathway in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We investigated the expression of NPC1L1 and its correlation with liver X receptor (LXR) expression in peripheral mononuclear (PMN) cells in patients with NAFLD.
We evaluated intestinal expression of NPC1L1 in 25 NAFLD patients and 28 healthy controls. We calculated the mRNA expression levels of LXR and farnesoid X receptor (FXR), which are master players of cholesterol metabolism in PMN cells. The protein expression of ABCA1, ABCG5/8, NPC1L1, SREBP, LXR, FXR, and CD36 was measured on tissue samples from the duodenum and ileum.
The expression of LXR (p = 0.01) and FXR (p = 0.03) in PMN cells was increased in the NAFLD group compared to the control group. Duodenal NPC1L1 decreased in the NAFLD group compared to the healthy controls (3.38 ¬± 1.4 vs. 2.42 ¬± 1.2, p = 0.05). NPC1L1 expression in the duodenum was negatively correlated with LXR expression in PMN cells. Expression of LXR and FXR in the ileum was also negatively correlated with the expression of LXR in PMN cells.
Duodenal NPC1L1 expression was decreased in NAFLD and was negatively correlated with LXR expression in PMN cells.
Statins, 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, are the first-line medications prescribed for the prevention and treatment of coronary artery diseases. The efficacy of statins has been attributed not only to their systemic cholesterol-lowering actions but also to their pleiotropic effects that are unrelated to cholesterol reduction. These pleiotropic effects have been increasingly recognized as essential in statins therapy. This study was designed to investigate the pleiotropic actions of simvastatin, one of the most commonly prescribed statins, on macrophage cholesterol homeostasis with a focus on lysosomal free cholesterol egression. With simultaneous nile red and filipin staining, analysis of confocal/multi-photon imaging demonstrated that simvastatin markedly attenuated unesterified (free) cholesterol buildup in macrophages loaded with oxidized low-density lipoprotein but had little effect in reducing the sizes of cholesteryl ester-containing lipid droplets; the reduction in free cholesterol was mainly attributed to decreases in lysosome-compartmentalized cholesterol. Functionally, the egression of free cholesterol from lysosomes attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. It was determined that the reduction of lysosomal free cholesterol buildup by simvastatin was due to the up-regulation of Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), a lysosomal residing cholesterol transporter. Moreover, the enhanced enzymatic production of 7-hydroxycholesterol by cytochrome P450 7A1 and the subsequent activation of liver X receptor Œ± underscored the up-regulation of NPC1. These findings reveal a novel pleiotropic effect of simvastatin in affecting lysosomal cholesterol efflux in macrophages and the associated significance in the treatment of atherosclerosis.
Elevated blood cholesterol is an important risk factor associated with atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. Tomato lycopene has been found to have a hypocholesterolemic effect, and the effect was considered to be related to inhibition of cholesterol synthesis. However, since plasma cholesterol levels are also influenced by the absorption of cholesterol in the gut, the present study is to investigate whether lycopene affects cholesterol absorption in the intestinal Caco-2 cells.
The Caco-2 cells were pretreated with lycopene at different concentrations for 24 h and then incubated with radioactive micellar cholesterol for 2 h. The absorption of radioactive cholesterol was quantified by liquid scintillation. The expression of Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) and liver X receptor Œ± (LXRŒ±) was analyzed by Western blot and qPCR. We found that lycopene dose dependently inhibited cholesterol absorption and the expression of NPC1L1 protein and NPC1L1 mRNA. The inhibitory effects of lycopene on cholesterol absorption and NPC1L1 expression could be prevented by blockade of the LXRŒ± pathway.
This study provides the first evidence that lycopene inhibits cholesterol absorption in the intestinal cells and this inhibitory effect of lycopene is mediated, at least in part, by LXRŒ±-NPC1L1 signaling pathway.
Sesame seed is rich in sesamin. The present study was to (i) investigate the plasma cholesterol-lowering activity of dietary sesamin and (ii) examine the interaction of dietary sesamin with the gene expression of sterol transporters, enzymes, receptors, and proteins involved in cholesterol metabolism. Thirty hamsters were divided into three groups fed the control diet (CON) or one of two experimental diets containing 0.2% (SL) and 0.5% (SH) sesamin, respectively, for 6 weeks. Plasma total cholesterol (TC) levels in hamsters given the CON, SL, and SH diets were 6.62 ¬± 0.40, 5.32 ¬± 0.40, and 5.00 ¬± 0.44 mmol/L, respectively, indicating dietary sesamin could reduce plasma TC in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, the excretion of total fecal neutral sterols was dose-dependently increased with the amounts of sesamin in diets (CON, 2.65 ¬± 0.57; SL, 4.30 ¬± 0.65; and SH, 5.84 ¬± 1.27 Œºmol/day). Addition of sesamin into diets was associated with down-regulation of mRNA of intestinal Niemann-Pick C1 like 1 protein (NPC1L1), acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 2 (ACAT2), microsomal triacylglycerol transport protein (MTP), and ATP-binding cassette transporters subfamily G members 5 and 8 (ABCG5 and ABCG8). Results also showed that dietary sesamin could up-regulate hepatic cholesterol-7Œ±-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), whereas it down-regulated hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase and liver X receptor alpha (LXRŒ±). It was concluded that the cholesterol-lowering activity of sesamin was mediated by promoting the fecal excretion of sterols and modulating the genes involved in cholesterol absorption and metabolism. 
Ezetimibe is a potent inhibitor of Niemann-Pick type C1-Like 1 and has been approved for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Our preliminary study showed that ezetimibe promotes cholesterol efÔ¨Çux from vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Our aim was to investigate the cellular mechanisms underlying the ezetimibe actions.
Rat VSMCs were converted to foam cells by incubation with cholesterol:methyl-Œ≤-cyclodextrin. The intracellular free cholesterol, total cholesterol, and the ratio of cholesteryl ester to total cholesterol were decreased after the incubation of VSMCs with different concentrations of ezetimibe (3, 10, 30, and 30 Œºmol/l) or treated with 30 Œºmol/l of ezetimibe for different time periods (6, 12, 24, and 48 h). Our results also showed that the expression of caveolin-1, liver X receptor Œ±, and ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCA1 was enhanced, but the expression of nSREBP-1c was decreased in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. RNA interference was used to determine the roles of caveolin-1 and SREBP-1 in the lipid-lowering effect of ezetimibe. The results showed that caveolin-1 was involved in the regulation of intracellular cholesterol content, and the expression of caveolin-1 was repressed by SREBP-1.
The present study indicates that ezetimibe protects VSMCs from cholesterol accumulation by regulating the expression of lipid metabolism-related genes.
The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 on the development of atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-knockout (ApoE(-/-)) mice. Eight-week-old ApoE(-/-) mice were fed a Western diet with or without L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 daily for 16 weeks. L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 protected ApoE(-/-) mice from atherosclerosis by reducing their plasma cholesterol levels from 923 ¬± 44 to 581 ¬± 18 mg/dl, likely via a marked decrease in cholesterol absorption caused by modulation of Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1). In addition, suppression of cholesterol absorption induced reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) in macrophages through the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor/liver X receptor (PPAR/LXR) pathway. Fecal lactobacillus and bifidobacterium counts were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher in the L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 treatment groups than in the control groups. Furthermore, L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 was detected in the rat small intestine, colon, and feces during the feeding trial. The bacterial levels remained high even after the administration of lactic acid bacteria had been stopped for 2 weeks. These results suggest that administration of L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 can protect against atherosclerosis through the inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption. Therefore, L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 may be a potential therapeutic material for preventing the progression of atherosclerosis. 
Plant sterols and stanols are natural food ingredients found in plants. It was already shown in 1950 that they lower serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations. Meta-analysis has reported that a daily intake of 2.5 g plant sterols/stanols reduced serum LDL-C concentrations up to 10%. Despite many studies, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. Therefore, the proposed mechanisms that have been presented over the past decades will be described and discussed in the context of the current knowledge. In the early days, it was suggested that plant sterols/stanols compete with intestinal cholesterol for incorporation into mixed micelles as well as into chylomicrons. Next, the focus shifted toward cellular processes. In particular, a role for sterol transporters localized in the membranes of enterocytes was suggested. All these processes ultimately lowered intestinal cholesterol absorption. More recently, the existence of a direct secretion of cholesterol from the circulation into the intestinal lumen was described. First results in animal studies suggested that plant sterols/stanols activate this pathway, which also explains the increased fecal neutral sterol content and as such could explain the cholesterol-lowering activity of plant sterols/stanols.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are essential for the regulation of intestinal cholesterol absorption. Because two isoforms exist, LXRŒ± and LXRŒ≤, with overlapping but not identical functions, we investigated whether LXRŒ± and LXRŒ≤ exert different effects on intestinal cholesterol absorption.
Wild-type (WT), LXRŒ±(-/-) and LXRŒ≤(-/-) mice were fed control diet, 0.2% cholesterol-enriched diet or 0.2% cholesterol-enriched diet plus the LXR agonist GW3965.
When fed a control diet, all three genotypes showed similar levels of cholesterol absorption. Of interest, a significant increase in cholesterol absorption was found in the LXRŒ±(-/-) mice, but not in the WT or LXRŒ≤(-/-) animals, when fed a diet enriched with 0.2% cholesterol or 0.2% cholesterol + GW3965. Reduced faecal neutral sterol excretion and a hydrophobic bile acid profile were also observed in LXRŒ±(-/-) mice. Greater increases in the apolipoprotein (apo)B-containing lipoproteins in serum were seen in the LXRŒ±(-/-) mice. A 0.2% cholesterol +GW3965 diet suppressed intestinal Npc1l1 protein expression to the same extent for all genotypes, while Abca1 and Abcg5 were elevated to the same degree.
In the intestine, LXRŒ± and LXRŒ≤ seem to exert similar effects on expression of cholesterol-transporting proteins such as Npc1l1. Selective activation of LXRŒ≤ may generate effects such as increased cholesterol absorption and elevated serum levels of apoB-containing lipoproteins, which seem to be counteracted by LXRŒ±. Therefore, an intestinal LXRŒ≤-specific pathway might exist in terms of cholesterol transportation in addition to the main pathway.
The liver is currently known to be the major organ to eliminate excess cholesterol from our body. It accomplishes this function in two ways: conversion of cholesterol molecules into bile acids (BAs) and secretion of unesterified cholesterol molecules into bile. BAs are synthesized in the hepatocytes, secreted into bile and delivered to the lumen of the small intestine where they act as detergents to facilitate absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins. About 95% of BAs are recovered in the ileum during each cycle of the enterohepatic circulation. Five percent are lost and replaced by newly synthesized BAs, which amounts to approximately 500 mg/day in adult humans. In contrast to the efficiency of the BAs' enterohepatic circulation, 50% of the 1000 mg of cholesterol secreted daily into bile is lost in feces. It is known that rare human mutations in certain genes in bile acid and bile metabolic pathway influence blood cholesterol levels. With the recent success of genome-wide association studies, we are convinced that common genetic variants also play a role in the genetic architecture of plasma lipid traits. In this review, we summarized the current state of knowledge about genetic variations in bile acid and bile metabolic pathway, and assessed their impact on blood cholesterol levels and cholesterol metabolic kinetics in the population.
The fetus has a high requirement for cholesterol and synthesizes cholesterol at elevated rates. Recent studies suggest that fetal cholesterol also can be obtained from exogenous sources. The purpose of the current study was to examine the transport of maternal cholesterol to the fetus and determine the mechanism responsible for any cholesterol-driven changes in transport. Studies were completed in pregnant hamsters with normal and elevated plasma cholesterol concentrations. Cholesterol feeding resulted in a 3.1-fold increase in the amount of LDL-cholesterol taken up by the fetus and a 2.4-fold increase in the amount of HDL-cholesterol taken up. LDL-cholesterol was transported to the fetus primarily by the placenta, and HDL-cholesterol was transported by the yolk sac and placenta. Several proteins associated with sterol transport and efflux, including those induced by activated liver X receptor, were expressed in hamster and human placentas: NPC1, NPC1L1, ABCA2, SCP-x, and ABCG1, but not ABCG8. NPC1L1 was the only protein increased in hypercholesterolemic placentas. Thus, increasing maternal lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations can enhance transport of maternal cholesterol to the fetus, leading to 1) increased movement of cholesterol down a concentration gradient in the placenta, 2) increased lipoprotein secretion from the yolk sac (shown previously), and possibly 3) increased placental NPC1L1 expression.
The aim of this study was to determine the effects of an atherogenic diet (AD; 40¬†% lipid, 1.25¬†% cholesterol, kcal) on triglyceride (TAG) and cholesterol accumulation in liver and on gene expression of liver X receptor (LXR) and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and their target genes and to observe if these responses are affected by endurance training.
Sprague-Dawley rats (n¬†=¬†32) were divided into two groups and randomly assigned to an AD or a standard diet (SD) for 7¬†weeks. Half of the rats in each group were assigned to an exercise training program for 5¬†days/week.
The AD resulted in a large (P¬†&lt;¬†0.01) accumulation in liver TAG (4√ó) along with elevated liver and plasma cholesterol without any gain in peripheral fat mass. The liver TAG and cholesterol accumulations were associated with an important reduction (P¬†&lt;¬†0.01; 60¬†%) in FXR, but no change in LXR transcripts. Accompanying the reduction in FXR gene expression, we found an increase (P¬†&lt;¬†0.001) in SREBP-1c and a decrease (P¬†&lt;¬†0.01) in MTP mRNAs suggesting an increased lipogenesis and a reduced VLDL production, respectively. The AD was also associated with lower HMG-CoA-r, squalene synthase, and ABCG8 transcripts (P¬†&lt;¬†0.001). In the intestine, exercise training resulted in higher NPC1L1, ABCG5, and ABCG8 in SD-fed animals, while all these increases were suppressed under the AD feeding.
It is concluded that dietary cholesterol favors liver TAG and cholesterol accumulations associated with an important reduction in FXR transcripts.
Fucosterol, a sterol that is abundant in marine algae, has hypocholesterolemic activity, but the mechanism underlying its effect is not clearly understood. Because data suggest that fucosterol can increase plasma high-density lipoprotein concentrations, we investigated whether it could activate liver X receptors (LXRs), critical transcription factors in reverse cholesterol transport. Fucosterol dose-dependently stimulated the transcriptional activity of both LXR-Œ± and -Œ≤ in a reporter gene assay, responses that were attenuated by the LXR antagonist As(2)O(3). Fucosterol also activated co-activator recruitment in cell-free time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis. In THP-1-derived macrophages, it induced the transcriptional activation of ABCA1, ABCG1, and ApoE, key genes in reverse cholesterol transport, and thereby significantly increased the efflux of cholesterol. Fucosterol also regulated intestinal NPC1L1 and ABCA1 in Caco-2 cells. Notably, fucosterol did not induce cellular triglyceride accumulation in HepG2 cells, primarily because of its upregulation of Insig-2a, which delays nuclear translocation of SREBP-1c, a key hepatic lipogenic transcription factor. These results suggest that fucosterol is a dual-LXR agonist that regulates the expression of key genes in cholesterol homeostasis in multiple cell lines without inducing hepatic triglyceride accumulation.
Dietary supplementation with plant sterols, stanols, and their esters reduces intestinal cholesterol absorption, thus lowering plasma LDL cholesterol concentration in humans. It was suggested that these beneficial effects are attributable in part to induction of genes involved in intestinal cholesterol transport, e.g., Abcg5 and Abcg8, via the liver X receptor (LXR), but direct proof is lacking. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a purified diet (control), diets containing cholesterol (0.12 g/100 g) only, or in combination with either plant sterols or stanols (0.5 g/100 g) for 4 wk. Plant sterols and stanols dramatically increased neutral fecal sterol excretion (2.2 and 1.4-fold, respectively, compared with cholesterol-fed mice; P &lt; 0.05). Cholesterol and cholesterol ester concentrations were higher in livers of mice fed cholesterol compared with controls (+135% and +925%; P &lt; 0.05). Plant sterols and stanols completely prevented cholesterol accumulation as well as induction of LXR target genes in liver. Feeding plant sterols and stanols did not alter intestinal expression of Abcg5, Abcg8, or other LXR target genes nor of Npc1l1. Fractional cholesterol absorption in Abcg5-/- mice was reduced to the same extent by dietary plant sterols (49%) as in wild-type littermates (44%). Plant sterol and stanol-induced reduction of cholesterol absorption in mice is not associated with upregulation of intestinal LXR target genes nor is it influenced by Abcg5-deficiency. Our data indicate that dietary plant sterols and stanols inhibit cholesterol absorption within the intestinal lumen independently of LXR.
Activation of liver x receptor (LXR) raises plasma HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) in mice. Interestingly, the LXR agonist GW3965 fails to raise plasma HDL-C in mice lacking intestinal ABCA1, indicating that intestinal ABCA1 plays a predominant role in GW3965-mediated HDL production. How this is coupled to intestinal function remains elusive. Because cholesterol is essential for HDL assembly and directly regulates intestinal ABCA1 expression via activating LXR, we hypothesized that cholesterol absorption, a major function of intestine, modulates LXR-dependent HDL formation.
Mice lacking Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) (L1-KO mice), a gene that is essential for cholesterol absorption, were treated with LXR agonist T0901317 for 7 days. Intriguingly, this treatment failed to significantly raise plasma HDL-C but caused a much greater fecal cholesterol excretion in L1-KO mice. The intestinal ABCA1 mRNA level was about 4-fold lower in L1-KO versus wild-type mice, and increased 3.9-fold and 8.8-fold after T0901317 treatment in wild-type and L1-KO mice, respectively. Hepatic ABCA1 failed to respond to T0901317 in mice of both genotypes, although hepatic mRNAs for many LXR target genes were higher in the T0901317-treated versus untreated wild-type animals.
NPC1L1 is required for an LXR agonist to increase plasma HDL-C in mice.
Sitosterolemia is caused by mutations in either ABCG5 or ABCG8, but simultaneous mutations of these genes have never been observed. To explore whether ABCG8, the sterol efflux (hemi-)transporter, plays a major role in determining intestinal absorption efficiency and hepatic secretion rates of cholesterol and sitostanol, we performed direct measurements of the absorption and lymphatic transport of these sterols in mice with chronic biliary and lymphatic fistulae, as well as the transport rates of radiolabeled cholesterol and sitostanol from plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) into bile in male Abcg8(-/-) and wild-type mice. We observed that the absorption and lymphatic transport rates of radiolabeled cholesterol and sitostanol were increased by approximately 40% and approximately 500%, respectively, in Abcg8(-/-) mice in the setting of constant intraduodenal infusion of micellar taurocholate and lecithin. Both strains displayed identical intestinal Npc1l1 expression levels and small intestinal transit rates. After 45 minutes of intraduodenal infusion, acute intestinal uptake rates of trace [(14)C]cholesterol and [(3)H]sitostanol were essentially similar in both groups of mice with intact biliary secretion. Furthermore, in wild-type mice, mass transport rate of [(3)H]sitostanol from plasma HDL into bile was significantly faster than that of [(14)C]cholesterol; however, no [(3)H]sitostanol and only traces of [(14)C]cholesterol were detected in bile of Abcg8(-/-) mice.
Deletion of the Abcg8 gene alone significantly increases the mass of intestinal cholesterol and sitostanol absorption and reduces but does not eliminate hepatic secretion of cholesterol. Moreover, the mutation has no influence on acute uptake of cholesterol and sitostanol by the enterocyte nor small intestinal transit time.
Liver X receptor Œ± (LXRŒ±) plays an important role in the cholesterol metabolism process, and LXRŒ± activation can reduce atherosclerosis. In the present study, using an LXRŒ±-GAL4 luciferase reporter screening, we discovered IMB-170, a structural analog of quinazolinone, which showed potent LXRŒ± agonistic activity. IMB-170 significantly activated LXRŒ±, with an EC50 value of 0.27ŒºM. Interestingly, IMB-170 not only increased the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and G1 (ABCG1), which are related to the reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) process, but also influenced the expression levels of other genes involved in the cholesterol metabolism pathway in many cell lines. Moreover, IMB-170 significantly reduced cellular lipid accumulation and increased cholesterol efflux from RAW264.7 and THP-1 macrophages. Interestingly, compared with TO901317, IMB-170 only slightly increased protein expression levels of lipogenesis-related genes in HepG2 cells, indicating that IMB-170 may have a lower lipogenesis side effect in vivo. These results suggest that IMB-170 showed the selective agonistic activity for LXRŒ±. Moreover, compared with full LXR-agonists, IMB-170 possesses a differential ability to recruit coregulators. This suggests that IMB-170 has distinct interactions with the active sites in the LXRŒ± ligand-binding domain. In summary, IMB-170 is a novel partial LXRŒ± agonist without the classical lipogenesis side effects, which could be used as a potential anti-atherosclerotic leading compound in the future. 
Liver X receptor (LXR) is an oxysterol-activated nuclear receptor involved in the control of major metabolic pathways for cholesterol homeostasis and lipogenesis. Although the role of LXR in hepatic steatosis is well known, its correlation with intrahepatic inflammation and fibrosis has not been thoroughly studied. We investigated the association between LXRŒ±, hepatic inflammation, and fibrosis, as well as its correlation with other intrahepatic lipid transporters in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
We evaluated clinical characteristics including sex, age, body mass index, and laboratory findings from 40 NAFLD and 16 control patients. Immunohistochemical staining was carried out on liver biopsy samples from all patients.
The positive rate of LXRŒ± expression was 30¬†% in the control group, 50¬†% in the NAFLD group, and 97¬†% in NASH groups. LXRŒ± expression was positively correlated with not only the amount of intrahepatic fat, but also with intrahepatic inflammation and hepatic fibrosis. LXRŒ± expression showed positive correlation with intrahepatic expression of ABCG5/8, CD36, and SREBP-1c. The expression of ABCA1, ABCG5/8, SREBP-1c, and CD36 was higher in NAFLD than in controls and there was no further increase in the NASH group. NPC1L1 was abundant in human liver. Expression of NPC1L1 was negatively correlated with intrahepatic inflammation and LXRŒ± intensity.
LXR expression correlated with the degree of hepatic fat deposition, as well as with hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in NAFLD patients. Our research suggests that LXR is an attractive target for treatment and regulation of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis.
We have recently shown that a high glucose (HG) concentration raised intestinal cholesterol (CHOL) transport and metabolism in intestinal epithelial cells. The objective of the present work is to determine whether the stimulus for increased CHOL absorption by glucose originates from the apical site (corresponding to the intestinal lumen) or from the basolateral site (related to blood circulation). We tackled this issue by using differentiated Caco-2/15 cells. Only basolateral medium, supplemented with 25 mmol/L glucose, stimulated [(14)C]-CHOL uptake via the up-regulation of the critical CHOL transporter NPC1L1 protein, as confirmed by its specific ezetimibe inhibitor that abolished the rise in glucose-mediated CHOL capture. No significant changes were noted in SR-BI and CD36. Elevated CHOL uptake was associated with an increase in the transcription factors SREBP-2, LXR-Œ≤, and ChREBP, along with a fall in RXR-Œ±. Interestingly, although the HG concentration in the apical medium caused modest changes in CHOL processing, its impact was synergetic with that of the basolateral medium. Our results suggest that HG concentration influences positively intestinal CHOL uptake when present in the basolateral medium. In addition, excessive consumption of diets containing high levels of carbohydrates may strengthen intestinal CHOL uptake in metabolic syndrome, thereby contributing to elevated levels of circulating CHOL and, consequently, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. 
Essential oil components from turmeric (Curcuma longa L.) are documented for neuroprotective, anti-cancer, anti-thrombotic and antioxidant effects. The present study aimed to investigate the disease-modifying potential of curcuma oil (C. oil), a lipophilic component from C. longa L., in hyperlipidaemic hamsters. Male golden Syrian hamsters were fed a chow or high-cholesterol (HC) and fat-rich diet with or without C. oil (30, 100 and 300 mg/kg) for 28 d. In HC diet-fed hamsters, C. oil significantly reduced plasma total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and TAG, and increased HDL-cholesterol when compared with the HC group. Similar group comparisons showed that C. oil treatment reduced hepatic cholesterol and oxidative stress, and improved liver function. Hyperlipidaemia-induced platelet activation, vascular dysfunction and repressed eNOS mRNA expression were restored by the C. oil treatment. Furthermore, aortic cholesterol accumulation and CD68 expression were also reduced in the C. oil-treated group. The effect of C. oil at 300 mg/kg was comparable with the standard drug ezetimibe. Delving into the probable anti-hyperlipidaemic mechanism at the transcript level, the C. oil-treated groups fed the chow and HC diets were compared with the chow diet-fed group. The C. oil treatment significantly increased the hepatic expression of PPARa, LXRa, CYP7A1, ABCA1, ABCG5, ABCG8 and LPL accompanied by reduced SREBP-2 and HMGCR expression. C. oil also enhanced ABCA1, ABCG5 and ABCG8 expression and suppressed NPC1L1 expression in the jejunum. In the present study, C. oil demonstrated an anti-hyperlipidaemic effect and reduced lipid-induced oxidative stress, platelet activation and vascular dysfunction. The anti-hyperlipidaemic effect exhibited by C. oil seems to be mediated by the modulation of PPARa, LXRa and associated genes involved in lipid metabolism and transport.
Modulation of the cholesterol-sensing liver X receptors (LXRs) and their downstream targets has emerged as promising therapeutic avenues in atherosclerosis. The intestine is important for its unique capabilities to act as a gatekeeper for cholesterol absorption and to participate in the process of cholesterol elimination in the feces and reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). Pharmacological and genetic intestine-specific LXR activation have been shown to protect against atherosclerosis. In this review we discuss the LXR-targeted molecular players in the enterocytes as well as the intestine-driven pathways contributing to cholesterol homeostasis with therapeutic potential as targets in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis..
Human pregnancy is associated with enhanced de novo lipogenesis in the early stages followed by hyperlipidemia during advanced gestation. Liver X receptors (LXRs) are oxysterol-activated nuclear receptors that stimulate de novo lipogenesis and also promote the efflux of cholesterol from extrahepatic tissues followed by its transport back to the liver for biliary excretion. Although LXR is recognized as a master regulator of triglyceride and cholesterol homeostasis, it is unknown whether it facilitates the gestational adaptations in lipid metabolism. To address this question, biochemical profiling, protein quantification, and gene expression studies were used, and gestational metabolic changes in T0901317-treated wild-type mice and Lxrab-/- mutants were investigated. Here, we show that altered LXR signaling contributes to the enhanced lipogenesis in early pregnancy by increasing the expression of hepatic Fas and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (Scd1). Both the pharmacological activation of LXR with T0901317 and the genetic ablation of its two isoforms disrupted the increase in hepatic fatty acid biosynthesis and the development of hypertriglyceridemia during early gestation. We also demonstrate that absence of LXR enhances maternal white adipose tissue lipolysis, causing abnormal accumulation of triglycerides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids in the fetal liver. Together, these data identify LXR as an important factor in early-pregnancy lipogenesis that is also necessary to protect against abnormalities in fetoplacental lipid homeostasis.
Vitamin E membrane transport has been shown to involve the cholesterol transporters SR-BI, ABCA1 and NPC1L1. Our aim was to investigate the possible participation of another cholesterol transporter in cellular vitamin E efflux: ABCG1. In Abcgl-deficient mice, vitamin E concentration was reduced in plasma lipoproteins whereas most tissues displayed a higher vitamin E content compared to wild-type mice. Œ±- and Œ≥-tocopherol efflux was increased in CHO cells overexpressing human ABCG1 compared to control cells. Conversely, Œ±- and Œ≥- tocopherol efflux was decreased in ABCG1-knockdown human cells (Hep3B hepatocytes and THP-1 macro- phages). Interestingly, Œ±- and Œ≥-tocopherol significantly downregulated ABCG1 and ABCA1 expression levels in Hep3B and THP-1, an effect confirmed in vivo in rats given vitamin E for 5 days. This was likely due to reduced LXR activation by oxysterols, as Hep3B cells and rat liver treated with vitamin E displayed a significantly reduced content in oxysterols compared to their respective controls. Overall, the present study reveals for the first time that ABCG1 is involved in cellular vitamin E efflux.
Liver X receptor Œ± (LXRŒ±) controls important biological and pathophysiological processes such as lipid homeostasis. Inhibiting LXRŒ± transactivation may beneficial in the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is one of the main causes of liver diseases and hyperlipidemia. Oleanolic acid (OA) is a naturally occurring triterpenoid found in many plants. It has several beneficial effects on biological pathways; however, the mechanisms underlying its effects on LXRŒ± are unclear. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of OA on T0901317-induced LXRŒ± activation and explored whether OA can attenuate hepatic lipogenesis. The results showed that OA significantly decreased the promoter activities of LXR response element and sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c). It also decreased the mRNA and protein expression of LXRŒ± target genes. These resulted in reduced hepatocellular lipid content. Our results also revealed that the overall binding pose of OA is similar to the X-ray pose of T0901317. Furthermore, OA stimulated AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation in hepatic cells. Additionally, it increased small heterodimer partner-interacting leucine zipper protein (SMILE) but decreased steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) recruitment to the SREBP-1c promoter region. OA also enhanced LXRŒ±-mediated induction of reverse cholesterol transport (RCT)-related gene, ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC) A1, and ABCG1 expression in intestinal cells. It was found that OA increased the binding of SRC-1 but decreased SMILE recruitment to the ABCG1 gene promoter region. Furthermore, it reduced valproate- and rifampin-induced LXRŒ±- and pregnane X receptor-mediated lipogenesis, respectively, which indicates its potential benefit in treating drug-induced hepatic steatosis. The results also show that OA is liver-specific and can be selectively repressed of lipogenesis. Moreover, it preserves and enhances LXRŒ±-induced RCT stimulation. The results show that OA may be a promising treatment for NAFLD. Additionally, it can be used in the development of LXRŒ± agonists to prevent atherosclerosis.
Nuclear receptors (NRs) are ligand-activated transcription factors. Class 2 NRs, such as the liver X receptor (LXR)Œ± and (LXR)Œ≤, are typically retained in the nucleus bound to the DNA in both the presence and absence of ligand. Upon binding ligands including hydroxylated cholesterol, LXR releases corepressor proteins in exchange for coactivators resulting in target gene transcription. Activity of the LXRs therefore depends on a combination of the local ligand concentration(s) and cofactor expression, which itself is a function of cell and tissue type, mutation load, and epigenetic regulation. Cross talk with other transcription factors or signaling pathways can also alter LXR activity. The role that LXR plays in both normal physiology and disease progression is becoming increasingly apparent, and a better understanding of how and when LXR is activated or repressed is pressing biological and clinical questions.The complexity of LXR regulation makes identifying novel ligands and determining LXR activity in new cell types challenging. Generating cell lines that contain a stably integrated luciferase reporter gene with an upstream LXR-dependent promoter provides a quick, cheap, robust, efficient, and high-throughput solution to identify novel ligands and assess ligand activity in new cell types. Transplant of these stable cell culture cell lines as xenografts allows reporter activation to be assessed in vivo. Here we describe the generation of stable LXR reporter cell lines, how to confirm transgene insertion and select single cell clones, as well a method to assess transgene activity in vitro.
Preparing rat model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by fat-rich diet to observe the expression and the role of LXR-alpha in rat nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
Thirty-six SD rats were randonmized into basic diet-control group and high-fat diet group. Each of the two groups was subdivided into 3 subgroups (4, 8, 12 weeks). Changes in animal weight, liver exponent and the level of TG and TC in serum and liver were observed dynamically. Meanwhile,the expression of hepatocyte LXR-alpha and SREBP-1c were assayed by Reverse transcript-polymerase chain reaction at 4, 8, 12 weeks. The level of steatosis was observed under light microscope after haematoxylon-eosin (HE) staening.
Compared with control group, body weight, liver exponent, TG and Tc in serum and liver were increased dynamically in model groups. Compared with control group, the mRNA of LXR-a and SREBP-1c were obviously increased dynamically in model groups (P &lt; 0.05) .
The increase of LXR-alpha and SREBP-1c in liver may be concered with energy disorder and closely associated with the activity of inflammation and the severity of the liver damage in NAFLD rats.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are nuclear receptors family of ligand-dependent transcription factors that play a crucial role in regulating cholesterol metabolism and inflammation. Recent studies show that LXR agonists exhibit anti-cancer activities in a variety of cancer cell lines including prostate. To further identify the potential mechanisms of LXRŒ± activation on prostate cancer, we investigated the effect of LXR agonist T0901317 on PC3 prostate cancer cell and in which activity of beta-catenin pathway involved.
Prostate cancer PC3 cells were transfected with LXR-a siRNA and treated with LXR activator T0901317. qRT-PCR and western blot were used to detect the LXR-a expression. beta-catenin, cyclin D1 and c-MYC were analyzed by western blot. Cell apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry and Cell proliferation was assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. Cell migration was detected by Transwell chambers.
Data showed that T0901317 significantly inhibited PC3 cell proliferation as well as invasion and increased apoptosis in vitro. Furthermore, we found that LXRŒ± activation induced the reduction of beta-catenin expression in PC3 cells, and this inhibitory effect could be totally abolished when cells were treated with LXRŒ±. Meanwhile, the expression of beta-catenin target gene cyclin D1 and c-MYC were also decreased.
This study provided additional evidence that LXR activation inhibited PC-3 prostate cancer cells via suppressing beta-catenin pathway.
Lead exposure has been evidenced as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), mainly affecting the ageing. However, the early manifestation and mechanisms of AD-like pathology induced by lead exposure remains to be elucidated. Considering the fact that impaired cholesterol metabolism is associated with many neurodegenerative disorders including AD, in this study we focused on the role of cholesterol metabolism in lead induced premature AD-like pathology. We treated weaning rats with lead at different concentrations for 4 weeks. We found that developmental lead exposure increased amyloid-beta (AŒ≤) accumulation and amyloid plaque deposition in the cortex and hippocampus. Lead exposure increased amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression and activated the sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP2)-beta secretase (BACE1) pathway. In addition, we found that lead exposure decreased cholesterol levels by upregulating the expression of liver X receptor-a (LXR-a) and ATP-binding cassette transporter protein family member A1 (ABCA1) and decreasing the expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CR) and low density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) in young rat brain tissues. Taken together, our data demonstrated that developmental lead exposure induced early manifestation of AD-like pathology and disturbed cholesterol metabolism in young rat brains.
Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC) is an inherited disorder mainly caused by loss-of-function mutations in the NPC1 gene, that lead to intracellular cholesterol accumulation and disturbed cholesterol homeostasis. Similarly to Alzheimer's disease (AD), NPC is associated with progressive neurodegeneration and altered metabolism of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Liver X receptors (LXRs), the key transcriptional regulators of cholesterol homeostasis, were reported to play neuroprotective roles in NPC mice. We investigated the impacts of LXRs on APP metabolism in mutant CHO cells lacking the NPC1 gene (-NPC1 cells). Pharmacological activation of LXRs in -NPC1 cells tended to reduce the ratio of total secreted APP (sAPP) to full length APP (flAPP) levels and sAPPŒ≤ levels as well as to increase the ratio of APP Cterminal fragments to flAPP levels, resulting in decreased levels of amyloid Œ≤ (AŒ≤) peptides. -NPC1 cells treated with LXR agonist TO901317 (TO90) displayed a modest increase in cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) but not to HDL3, or in the absence of extracellular cholesterol acceptors. The observed similar reduction of AŒ≤ levels upon TO90 treatment in the presence or in the absence of extracellular apoA-I indicated a cholesterol-efflux independent effect of TO90 on AŒ≤ levels. Furthermore, TO90 had no effect on the cholesterol synthesis rate in -NPC1 cells, while it reduced the rate of cholesterol esterification. The obtained results indicate that LXR activation may decrease AŒ≤ levels in NPC1- deficient conditions. The underlying mechanism of this action does not appear to be related to effects on cholesterol efflux or synthesis rates. 
This review traces the evolution of the 'Oxysterol Hypothesis', which was first formulated by Kandutsch and colleagues in 1978. The original hypothesis asserted that the suppressive effect of cholesterol on its own synthesis is mediated not by cholesterol itself, but by oxygenated forms of cholesterol, so called oxysterols. Subsequently, it has become clear that cholesterol plays a pivotal role in its own feedback regulation. However, recent findings have rekindled interest in oxysterols as potential physiological regulators of cholesterol homeostasis, in addition to drawing attention to other sterol regulators. Thus, certain oxysterols can suppress the activation of the master transcriptional regulators of lipid homeostasis (SREBPs) by binding to an oxysterol sensing protein in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (Insig). Some (oxy)sterols can accelerate the degradation of the key cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme, HMG-CoA reductase, and/or serve as natural ligand activators of a nuclear receptor (LXR) involved in coordinating many aspects of reverse cholesterol transport. Recent studies on endogenously produced oxysterols indicate that they may play a more subtle and acute role than originally envisaged, smoothing cholesterol responses in the short term. We also review the metabolism of oxysterols and other recent findings about oxysterols beyond a purely cholesterol homeostatic context, such as their proposed role in the Hedgehog development pathway.
Post-lysosomal cholesterol trafficking is an important, but poorly understood process that is essential to maintain lipid homeostasis. Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1), an integral membrane protein on the limiting membrane of late endosome/lysosome (LE/LY), is known to accept cholesterol from NPC2 and then mediate cholesterol transport from LE/LY to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane in a vesicle- or oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP)-related protein 5 (ORP5)-dependent manner. Mutations in the NPC1 gene can be found in the majority of NPC patients, who accumulate massive amounts of cholesterol and other lipids in the LE/LY due to a defect in intracellular lipid trafficking. Liver X receptor (LXR) is the major positive regulator of NPC1 expression. Atherosclerosis is the pathological basis of coronary heart disease, one of the major causes of death worldwide. NPC1 has been shown to play a critical role in the atherosclerotic progression. In this review, we have summarized the role of NPC1 in regulating intracellular cholesterol trafficking and atherosclerosis. 
Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)19, an endocrine hormone produced in the gut, acts in the liver to control bile acid synthesis. NGM282, an engineered FGF19 analog, is currently in clinical development for treating nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. However, the molecular mechanisms that integrate FGF19 with cholesterol metabolic pathways are incompletely understood. Here, we report that FGF19 and NGM282 promote HDL biogenesis and cholesterol efflux from the liver by selectively modulating LXR signaling while ameliorating hepatic steatosis. We further identify ABCA1 and FGF receptor 4 as mediators of this effect, and that administration of a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor or a blocking antibody against proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 abolished FGF19-associated elevations in total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), and LDL cholesterol in db/db mice. Moreover, we show that a constitutively active MEK1, but not a constitutively active STAT3, mimics the effect of FGF19 and NGM282 on cholesterol change. In dyslipidemic Apoe-/- mice fed a Western diet, treatment with NGM282 dramatically reduced atherosclerotic lesion area in aortas. Administration of NGM282 to healthy volunteers for 7 days resulted in a 26% increase in HDL-C levels compared with placebo. These findings outline a previously unrecognized role for FGF19 in the homeostatic control of cholesterol and may have direct impact on the clinical development of FGF19 analogs.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a very common indication for liver transplantation. How fat-rich diets promote progression from fatty liver to more damaging inflammatory and fibrotic stages is poorly understood. Here, we show that disrupting phosphorylation at Ser196 (S196A) in the liver X receptor alpha (LXRŒ±, NR1H3) retards NAFLD progression in mice on a high-fat-high-cholesterol diet. Mechanistically, this is explained by key histone acetylation (H3K27) and transcriptional changes in pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory genes. Furthermore, S196A-LXRŒ± expression reveals the regulation of novel diet-specific LXRŒ±-responsive genes, including the induction of Ces1f, implicated in the breakdown of hepatic lipids. This involves induced H3K27 acetylation and altered LXR and TBLR1 cofactor occupancy at the Ces1f gene in S196A fatty livers. Overall, impaired Ser196-LXRŒ± phosphorylation acts as a novel nutritional molecular sensor that profoundly alters the hepatic H3K27 acetylome and transcriptome during NAFLD progression placing LXRŒ± phosphorylation as an alternative anti-inflammatory or anti-fibrotic therapeutic target.
Natural-occurring polymer intercalated inorganic clay composites have received increasing interests in water cleanup for the features of eco-friendliness, cost-effectiveness, and availability. Herein, a new lignin xanthate resin (LXR) intercalated bentonite clay composite (LXR-BT) for the adsorption of representative organic doxycycline hydrochloride (DCH) antibiotic and inorganic Hg(II) in water was created through a feasible process. Structural characterizations by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Thermo gravimetric analysis (TG), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed LXR was successfully intercalated between the layers of bentonite clay. The adsorption performance of DCH/Hg(II) by LXR-BT was studied in detail with varied dosage, solution pH, contact time, and initial DCH/Hg(II) concentration. The results indicated that the adsorption capacities of DCH/Hg(II) on LXR-BT were much higher than that on bentonite, and the adsorption kinetics and isotherms followed the pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir model, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirmed the adsorption mechanisms of DCH (or Hg(II)) was mainly due to œÄ-œÄ interaction and hydrogen bonding interaction of DCH (or the complexation of Hg(II)) with the functional groups in the LXR-BT. This study suggested the possibility of LXR-BT as a new cost-effective adsorbent for both organic and inorganic pollutants removal in water.
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is closely associated with the development of drug resistance. Lipid metabolism plays an important role in EMT. This work was to study the cholesterol-lowering drug simvastatin for reversing EMT-associated resistance to chemotherapy via lipid metabolism.
The combination of simvastatin and paclitaxel was used to overcome the EMT-associated drug resistance. For dual-action on both cancer cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), the tumor microenvironment-activatable multifunctional liposomes were developed for drug codelivery. The liposomes were modified with a hairpin-structured, activatable cell-penetrating peptide that is specifically responsive to the tumor-associated protease legumain.
It was revealed simvastatin can disrupt lipid rafts (cholesterol-rich domains) and suppress integrin-Œ≤3 and focal adhesion formation, thus inhibiting FAK signaling pathway and re-sensitizing the drug-resistant cancer cells to paclitaxel. Furthermore, simvastatin was able to re-polarize tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), promoting M2-to-M1 phenotype switch via cholesterol-associated LXR/ABCA1 regulation. The repolarization increased TNF-Œ±, but attenuated TGF-Œ≤, which, in turn, remodeled the tumor microenvironment and suppressed EMT. The liposomal formulation achieved enhanced treatment efficacy.
This study provides a promising simvastatin-based nanomedicine strategy targeting cholesterol metabolism to reverse EMT and repolarize TAM to treat drug-resistant cancer. The elucidation of the molecular pathways (cholesterol/lipid raft/integrin Œ≤3/FAK and cholesterol-associated LXR/ABCA1 regulation) for anti-EMT and the new application of simvastatin should be of clinical significance.
Sphingolipid and cholesterol metabolism are closely associated at the structural, biochemical, and functional levels. Although HDL-associated sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) contributes to several HDL functions, and S1P signaling regulates glucose and lipid metabolism, no study has addressed the involvement of S1P in cholesterol efflux. Here, we show that sphingosine kinase (Sphk) activity was induced by the LXR agonist 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and required for the stimulation of ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein A-I. In support, pharmacological Sphk inhibition and Sphk2 but not Sphk1 deficiency abrogated efflux. The involved mechanism included stimulation of both transcriptional and functional ABCA1 regulatory pathways and depended for the latter on the S1P receptor 3 (S1P3). Accordingly, S1P3-deficient macrophages were resistant to 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol-stimulated cholesterol efflux. The inability of excess exogenous S1P to further increase efflux was consistent with tonic S1P3 signaling by a pool of constitutively generated Sphk-derived S1P dynamically regulating cholesterol efflux. In summary, we have established S1P as a previously unrecognized intermediate in LXR-stimulated ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux and identified S1P/S1P3 signaling as a positive-feedback regulator of cholesterol efflux. This constitutes a novel regulatory mechanism of cholesterol efflux by sphingolipids.
Lots of studies have demonstrated that immune cells could regulate reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). However, neither T cell receptor (TCR) signalling nor Zeta-chain associated protein 70 (ZAP70) have been demonstrated to be associated with RCT. To investigate this association, we used a ZAP70-deficient Jurkat-derived mutant, P116 cell line, to detect the effect of ZAP70 on RCT and inflammatory response. ZAP70 deficiency improved cholesterol efflux capacity by 14%. Meanwhile, mRNA and proteins expression of RCT regulatory proteins such as ABCA1, ABCG1 and SR-BI were increased in P116 cells. ZAP70-deficiency had no influence on LXR-Œ± and PPAR-Œ≥. Regarding the inflammatory response, the mRNA expression and secretion of pro-atherosclerotic cytokines, TNF-Œ±, IFN-Œ≥, IL-2 and IL-6, were significantly decreased in the ZAP70-deficient cell line. Activation of MAP kinases cascades, as determined by of ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation, were found to be inhibited in the absence of ZAP70. Specific inhibition of ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK activity was also found to decreased TNF-Œ±, IFN-Œ≥, and IL-6 secretion. However, only the ERK inhibition was observed to reduce IL-2 secretion, improve cholesterol efflux capacity and increase expression of ABCA1, ABCG1 and SR-BI without increasing LXR-Œ± and PPAR-Œ≥. Using ChIP assay to detect the binding of LXR-Œ± to LXRE, which promotes the expression of ABCG1, we found that inhibiting ERK improved binding without increasing LXR-Œ± levels. Thus, we speculate that ZAP70-deficiency may improve RCT and decrease the inflammatory response of T cells. Furthermore, these effects are probably achieved via ERK signalling pathway.
Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is an intractable disorder with a poor prognosis. Although lung fibroblasts play a central role in PF, the key regulatory molecules involved in this process remain unknown. To address this issue, we performed a time-course transcriptome analysis on lung fibroblasts of bleomycin- and silica-treated murine lungs. We found gene modules whose expression kinetics were associated with the progression of PF and human idiopathic PF (IPF). Upstream analysis of a transcriptome network helped in identifying 55 hub transcription factors that were highly connected with PF-associated gene modules. Of these hubs, the expression of Srebf1 decreased in line with progression of PF and human IPF, suggesting its suppressive role in fibroblast activation. Consistently, adoptive transfer and genetic modification studies revealed that the hub transcription factor SREBP-1c suppressed PF-associated gene expression changes in lung fibroblasts and PF pathology in vivo. Moreover, therapeutic pharmacological activation of LXR, an SREBP-1c activator, suppressed the Srebf1-dependent activation of fibroblasts and progression of PF. Thus, SREBP-1c acts as a protective hub of lung fibroblast activation in PF. Collectively, the findings of the current study may prove to be valuable in the development of effective therapeutic strategies for PF.
To compare the growth and biosynthetic ability of long-chain PUFA (LC-PUFA) of the genetically improved farmed tilapia (GIFT) (Oreochromis niloticus) in different water salinities, an 8-week feeding trial was conducted on the GIFT juveniles at 0, 12 and 24 ‚Ä∞ (parts per thousand; ppt), respectively, with three isonitrogenous (32 %) and isolipidic (8 %) diets (D1-D3). Diet D1 with fish oils (rich in LC-PUFA) as lipid source was used as the control, while D2 and D3 with vegetable oil (free LC-PUFA) blends as lipid source contained different ratios of linoleic acid (LA, 18 : 2n-6) and Œ±-linolenic acid (ALA, 18 : 3n-3) at 4¬∑04 (D2) and 0¬∑54 (D3), respectively. At the end of feeding trial, the growth performance of D2 and D3 groups under all salinity treatments was as good as that of D1 group, which indicates that the GIFT juveniles may convert dietary LA and ALA into LC-PUFA to meet the requirement of essential fatty acids for normal growth and physiology. When fed the same diets, GIFT at 12 ppt had a better growth performance coupled with a higher liver and muscle arachidonic acid content than those in freshwater. Furthermore, brackish water (24 ppt) significantly promoted the mRNA levels of elongase 5 of very long-chain fatty acids (elovl5) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Œ± (pparŒ±) in liver, when compared with freshwater. These results suggest that the GIFT may display better growth performance together with a relatively higher endogenous LC-PUFA biosynthetic ability under brackish water (12 and 24 ppt), probably through improving the expression of elovl5 and pparŒ± in liver.
The relationship between repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (r-mTBI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is well-recognized. However, the precise nature of how r-mTBI leads to or precipitates AD pathogenesis is currently not understood. Plasma biomarkers potentially provide non-invasive tools for detecting neurological changes in the brain, and can reveal overlaps between long-term consequences of r-mTBI and AD. In this study we address this by generating time-dependent molecular profiles of response to r-mTBI and AD pathogenesis in mouse models using unbiased proteomic analyses. To model AD, we used the well-validated hTau and PSAPP(APP/PS1) mouse models that develop age-related tau and amyloid pathological features, respectively, and our well-established model of r-mTBI in C57BL/6 mice. Plasma were collected at different ages (3, 9, and 15 months-old for hTau and PSAPP mice), encompassing pre-, peri- and post-"onset" of the cognitive and neuropathological phenotypes, or at different timepoints after r-mTBI (24 h, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-injury). Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS) approaches coupled with Tandem Mass Tag labeling technology were applied to develop molecular profiles of protein species that were significantly differentially expressed as a consequence of mTBI or AD. Mixed model ANOVA after Benjamini-Hochberg correction, and a stringent cut-off identified 31 proteins significantly changing in r-mTBI groups over time and, when compared with changes over time in sham mice, 13 of these were unique to the injured mice. The canonical pathways predicted to be modulated by these changes were LXR/RXR activation, production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species and complement systems. We identified 18 proteins significantly changing in PSAPP mice and 19 proteins in hTau mice compared to their wild-type littermates with aging. Six proteins were found to be significantly regulated in all three models, i.e., r-mTBI, hTau, and PSAPP mice compared to their controls. The top canonical pathways coincidently changing in all three models were LXR/RXR activation, and production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species. This work suggests potential biomarkers for TBI and AD pathogenesis and for the overlap between these two, and warrant targeted investigation in human populations. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD010664.
Kidney fibrosis is the common pathophysiological mechanism in end-stage renal disease characterized by excessive accumulation of myofibroblast-derived extracellular matrix. Natriuretic peptides have been demonstrated to have cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent anti-fibrotic properties likely due to interference with pro-fibrotic tissue growth factor Œ≤ (TGF-Œ≤) signaling. However, in vivo, natriuretic peptides are rapidly degraded by neutral endopeptidases (NEP). In a unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) mouse model for kidney fibrosis we assessed the anti-fibrotic effects of SOL1, an orally active compound that inhibits NEP and endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE). Mice (n=10 per group) subjected to UUO were treated for 1 week with either solvent, NEP-/ECE-inhibitor SOL1 (two doses), reference NEP-inhibitor candoxatril or the angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1)-antagonist losartan. While NEP-inhibitors had no significant effect on blood pressure, they did increase urinary cGMP levels as well as endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels. Immunohistochemical staining revealed a marked decrease in renal collagen (‚àº55% reduction, P&lt;0.05) and Œ±-smooth muscle actin (Œ±-SMA; ‚àº40% reduction, P&lt;0.05). Moreover, the number of Œ±-SMA positive cells in the kidneys of SOL1-treated groups inversely correlated with cGMP levels consistent with a NEP-dependent anti-fibrotic effect. To dissect the molecular mechanisms associated with the anti-fibrotic effects of NEP inhibition, we performed a 'deep serial analysis of gene expression (Deep SAGE)' transcriptome and targeted metabolomics analysis of total kidneys of all treatment groups. Pathway analyses linked increased cGMP and ET-1 levels with decreased nuclear receptor signaling (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor [PPAR] and liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor [LXR/RXR] signaling) and actin cytoskeleton organization. Taken together, although our transcriptome and metabolome data indicate metabolic dysregulation, our data support the therapeutic potential of NEP inhibition in the treatment of kidney fibrosis via cGMP elevation and reduced myofibroblast formation.
Angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) belongs to a multifunctional secreted protein that mainly expresses in the liver, and is regulated by numerous post-translational modifications, including multiple cleavage and glycosylation. Accumulating evidences have revealed that ANGPTL3 plays a critical role in both biological processes, such as lipid metabolism, angiogenesis and haematopoietic function and pathological changes, including atherosclerosis, carcinogenesis, nephrotic syndrome, diabetes, liver diseases and so on. Thus, ANGPTL3 may serve as a potential biomarker in these diseases. Furthermore, ANGPTL3 signalling pathways including LXR/ANGPTL3, thyroid hormone/ANGPTL3, insulin/ANGPTL3 and leptin/ANGPTL3 are also involved in physiological and pathological processes. Some biological ANGPTL3 inhibitors, chemical drugs and traditional Chinese medicine exert beneficial effects by targeting ANGPTL3 directly or indirectly. Therefore, elucidating the effects and underlying mechanisms of ANGPTL3 is essential to develop promising strategies in the diagnosis and treatment of related diseases.
Background The molecular mechanisms through which high-demand pacing induce myocardial dysfunction remain unclear. Methods and Results We created atrioventricular block in pigs using dependent right ventricular septal pacing for 6¬†months. Echocardiography was performed to evaluate dyssynchrony between pacing (n=6) and sham control (n=6) groups. Microarray and enrichment analyses were used to identify differentially expressed genes ( DEG s) in the left ventricular ( LV ) myocardium between pacing and sham control groups. Histopathological and protein changes were also analyzed and an A cell pacing model was also performed. Pacing significantly increased mechanical dyssynchrony. Enrichment analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and the activation z-score analysis method demonstrated that there were 5 DEG s ( ABCA 1, APOD , CLU , LY 96, and SERPINF 1) in the LV septum (z-score=-0.447) and 5 DEG s ( APOD , CLU , LY 96, MSR 1, and SERPINF 1) in the LV free wall (z-score=-1.000) inhibited the liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor ( LXR / RXR ) pathway, and 4 DEG s ( ACTA 2, MYL 1, PPP 2R3A, and SNAI 2) activated the integrin-linked kinase ( ILK ) pathway in the LV septum (z-score=1.000). The pacing group had a larger cell size, higher degree of myolysis and fibrosis, and increased expression of intracellular lipid, inflammatory cytokines, and apoptotic markers than the sham control group. The causal relationships between pacing and DEG s related to LXR / RXR and ILK pathways, apoptosis, fibrosis, and lipid expression after pacing were confirmed in the cell pacing model. Luciferase reporter assay in the cell pacing model also supported inhibition of the LXR pathway by pacing. Conclusions Right ventricular septal-dependent pacing was associated with persistent LV dyssynchrony-induced cardiomyopathy through inhibition of the LXR / RXR pathway.
Lymphocytes play a central role in the pathology of a range of chronic conditions such as autoimmune disease, transplant rejection, leukemia, lymphoma HIV/AIDs and cardiometabolic diseases such as atherosclerosis. Current treatments for lymphocyte-associated conditions are incompletely effective and/or complicated by a range of off-target toxicities. One major challenge is poor drug access to lymphocytes via the systemic blood and this may be attributed, at least in part, to the fact that lymphocytes are concentrated within lymph fluid and lymphoid tissues, particularly in gut-associated lymphatics. Here we demonstrate that promoting drug uptake into the intestinal lymphatics with a long chain fatty acid, thereby increasing lymphocyte access, enhances the pharmacodynamic effect of a highly lipophilic liver X receptor (LXR) agonist, WAY-252623, that has been suggested as a potential treatment for atherosclerosis. This has been exemplified by: (1) increased mRNA expression of key markers of LXR activation (ABCA1) and regulatory T cells (Foxp3) in local lymphatic lymphocytes and (2) enhanced numbers of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in the systemic circulation, after administration of a 5-fold lower dose with a lymph directing lipid formulation when compared with a non-lipid containing formulation. These data suggest that combining lipophilic, lymphotropic drug candidates such as WAY-252,623, with lymph-directing long chain lipid based formulations can enhance drug targeting to, and activity on, lymphocytes in lymph and that this effect persists through to the systemic circulation. This presents a promising approach to achieve more selective and effective therapeutic outcomes for the treatment of lymphocyte associated diseases.
The activation of liver X receptor (LXR) promotes cholesterol efflux and repression of inflammatory genes with anti-atherogenic consequences. The mechanisms underlying the repressive activity of LXR are controversial and have been attributed to cholesterol efflux or to transrepression of activator protein-1 (AP-1) activity. Here, we find that cholesterol efflux contributes to LXR repression, while the¬†direct repressive functions of LXR also play a key role but are independent of AP-1. We use assay¬†for¬†transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) to show that LXR reduces chromatin accessibility in cis at inflammatory gene enhancers containing LXR binding sites. Targets of this repressive activity are associated with leukocyte adhesion and neutrophil migration, and LXR agonist treatment suppresses neutrophil recruitment in a mouse model of sterile peritonitis. These studies suggest a model of repression in which liganded LXR binds in cis to canonical nuclear receptor binding sites and represses pro-atherogenic leukocyte functions in tandem with the induction of LXR targets mediating cholesterol efflux.
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is more prevalent in African and African American (AA) women compared to European American (EA) women. African and AA women diagnosed with TNBC experience high frequencies of metastases and less favorable outcomes. Emerging evidence indicates that this disparity may in fact be the result of the uniquely aggressive biology of African and AA disease.
To understand the reasons for TNBC in AA aggressive biology, we designed the present study to examine the proteomic profiles of TNBC and luminal A (LA) breast cancer within and across patients' racial demographic groups in order to identify proteins or molecular pathways altered in TNBC that offer some explanation for its aggressiveness and potential targets for treatment.
Proteomic profiles of TNBC, LA tumors, and their adjacent normal tissues from AA and EA women were obtained using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and bioinformatics, and differentially expressed proteins were validated by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Our data showed that a number of proteins have significantly altered in expression in LA tumors compared to TNBC, both within and across patients' racial demographic groups. The differentially overexpressed proteins in TNBC (compared to LA) of AA samples were distinct from those in TNBC (compared to LA) of EA women samples. Among the signaling pathways altered in AA TNBC compared to EA TNBC are innate immune signaling, calpain protease, and pyrimidine de novo synthesis pathways. Furthermore, liver LXR/RXR signaling pathway was altered between LA and TNBC in AA women and may be due to the deficiency of the CYP7B1 enzyme responsible for cholesterol degradation.
These findings suggest that TNBC in AA women enriched in signaling pathways that are different from TNBC in EA women. Our study draws a link between LXR/RXR expression, cholesterol, obesity, and the TNBC in AA women.
Liver‚ÄØX‚ÄØReceptor (LXR) agonists have been reported as a potential treatment for atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We have designed and synthesized a series of potent compounds based on a 1,2,4-triazole scaffold as novel LXR modulators. In cell-based cotransfection assays these compounds generally functioned as LXR agonists and we observed compounds with selectivity towards LXRŒ± (7-fold) and LXRŒ≤ (7-fold) in terms of potency. Assessment of the effects of selected compounds on LXR target gene expression in HepG2 cells revealed that compounds 6a-b and 8a-b behaved as inverse agonists on FASN expression even though they were agonists in the LXRŒ± and LXRŒ≤ cotransfection assays. Interestingly, these compounds had no effect on the expression of SREBP-1c confirming a unique LXR modulator pharmacology. Molecular docking studies and evaluation of ADME properties in-silico show that active compounds possess favorable binding modes and ADME profiles. Thus, these compounds may be useful for in vivo characterization of LXR modulators with unique profiles and determination of their potential clinical utility.
As plant-derived natural products, saponins have been widely applied for the dietary modification of metabolic syndrome. However, the underlying mechanisms of their preventive and therapeutic effects are still largely unclear. Nuclear receptors have been identified as potential pharmaceutical targets for treating various types of metabolic disorders. With similar structure to endogenous hormones, several saponins may serve as selective ligands for nuclear receptors. Recently, a series of saponins are proved to exert their physiological activities through binding to nuclear receptors. This review summarizes the biological and pharmacological activities of typical saponins mediated by some of the most well described nuclear receptors, including the classical steroid hormone receptors (ER, GR, MR, and AR) and the adopted orphan receptors (PPAR, LXR, FXR, and PXR).
Œ≤-(1,4)-d-Glucan with (1,2) and (1,6)-linked branches (short for Œ≤-glucan), extracted from Agaricus bisporus (Lange) Sing, had significant anti-obesity and lowering-fat effect. FITC-Œ≤-glucan was absorbed by adipocytes of zebrafish larvae when stained by Nile Red. Œ≤-Glucan decreased the adiposity mass, reduced the expression of ppar g, mtp, L-fabp, ifabp in ISH, which was coincident as the results of RT-PCT. Œ≤-Glucan lowered the level of C/EBP Œ±, c SREBP1, LXR Œ±, PPAR Œ≥ by WB analysis, which were accompanied by an increase level in LC3 II/LC3 I and a decline level in p62 in dose-dependent manner. This study explored the effect and mechanisms of Agaricus bisporus derived-Œ≤-glucan to regulate lipid metabolism and prevent lipid deposits, and provided the experimental data for its use in diet food and food addictive.
Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is one of the most common complications of diabetes. In this study, we employed a systems biology approach to identify DPN-related transcriptional pathways conserved across human and various murine models. Eight microarray datasets on peripheral nerve samples from murine models of type 1 (streptozotocin-treated) and type 2 (db/db and ob/ob) diabetes of various ages and human subjects with non-progressive and progressive DPN were collected. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between non-diabetic and diabetic samples in murine models, and non-progressive and progressive human samples using a unified analysis pipeline. A transcriptional network for each DEG set was constructed based on literature-derived gene-gene interaction information. Seven pairwise human-vs-murine comparisons using a network-comparison program resulted in shared sub-networks including 46 to 396 genes, which were further merged into a single network of 688 genes. Pathway and centrality analyses revealed highly connected genes and pathways including LXR/RXR activation, adipogenesis, glucocorticoid receptor signalling, and multiple cytokine and chemokine pathways. Our systems biology approach identified highly conserved pathways across human and murine models that are likely to play a role in DPN pathogenesis and provide new possible mechanism-based targets for DPN therapy.
LXRs, which are nuclear receptors, have 2 isoforms-LXRŒ± and LXRŒ≤. Generally, LXRŒ± is expressed in the liver, kidney, and a limited number of other organs, whereas LXRŒ≤ is thought to be expressed ubiquitously. Nevertheless, no clear consensus has been reached on the role of each in kidney lipid metabolism. Many researchers have reported that lipids accumulate in renal tubular epithelial cells during nephrosis. The nephrosis model we used showed the presence of urinary protein 4 days after the induction of illness. Additionally, the model maintained high levels of urinary protein from day 7-14. Lipid accumulation was clearly verified at day 4 and extreme accumulation was observed at day 7. We observed increased expression of LXRŒ± from an early stage of nephrosis. To explore the role of increased LXRŒ± in diseased kidney in¬†vitro, NRK52E, normal kidney tubular epithelial cells, were forced to overexpress LXRŒ±. These cells showed significantly lower lipid accumulation than mock cells did. In contrast, LXRŒ≤ knockdown lead to increased lipid accumulation in mock cells, and constancy in overexpressing cells. In normal kidneys, LXRŒ≤ is expressed stably to control mainly the intracellular lipids. However, with increasing intracellular lipid accumulation, expression of LXRŒ± and its downstream gene, ABCA1, was upregulated, followed by lipid excretion in an LXRŒ±-dependent manner. This phenomenon strongly suggests the importance of LXRŒ± in lipid metabolism in the diseased kidney.
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 27A1 is a key enzyme in both the acidic and neutral pathways of bile acid biosynthesis accepting cholesterol and ring-hydroxylated sterols as substrates introducing a (25R)26-hydroxy and ultimately a (25R)26-acid group to the sterol side-chain. In human, mutations in the CYP27A1 gene are the cause of the autosomal recessive disease cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). Surprisingly, Cyp27a1 knockout mice (Cyp27a1-/-) do not present a CTX phenotype despite generating a similar global pattern of sterols. Using liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry and exploiting a charge-tagging approach for oxysterol analysis we identified over 50 cholesterol metabolites and precursors in the brain and circulation of Cyp27a1-/- mice. Notably, we identified (25R)26,7Œ±- and (25S)26,7Œ±-dihydroxy epimers of oxysterols and cholestenoic acids, indicating the presence of an additional sterol 26-hydroxylase in mouse. Importantly, our analysis also revealed elevated levels of 7Œ±-hydroxycholest-4-en-3-one, which we found increased the number of oculomotor neurons in primary mouse brain cultures. 7Œ±-Hydroxycholest-4-en-3-one is a ligand for the pregnane X receptor (PXR), activation of which is known to up-regulate the expression of CYP3A11, which we confirm has sterol 26-hydroxylase activity. This can explain the formation of (25R)26,7Œ±- and (25S)26,7Œ±-dihydroxy epimers of oxysterols and cholestenoic acids; the acid with the former stereochemistry is a liver X receptor (LXR) ligand that increases the number of oculomotor neurons in primary brain cultures. We hereby suggest that a lack of a motor neuron phenotype in some CTX patients and Cyp27a1-/- mice may involve increased levels of 7Œ±-hydroxycholest-4-en-3-one and activation PXR, as well as increased levels of sterol 26-hydroxylase and the production of neuroprotective sterols capable of activating LXR.
CYP46A1 is the cytochrome P450 enzyme that converts cholesterol to 24-hydroxycholesterol, a cholesterol elimination product and a potent liver X receptor (LXR) ligand. We conducted retinal characterizations of Cyp46a1-/- mice that had normal fasting blood glucose levels but up to a 1.8-fold increase in retinal cholesterol. The retina of Cyp46a1-/- mice exhibited venous beading and tortuosity, microglia/macrophage activation, and increased vascular permeability, features commonly associated with diabetic retinopathy. The expression of LxrŒ± and LxrŒ≤ was increased in both the whole Cyp46a1-/- retina and retinal macroglia/macrophages. The LXR-target genes were affected as well, primarily in activated microglial cells and macrophages. In the latter, the LXR-transactivated genes (Abca1, Abcg1, Apod, Apoe, Mylip, and Arg2) were up-regulated; similarly, there was an up-regulation of the LXR-transrepressed genes (Ccl2, Ptgs2, Cxcl1, Il1b, Il6, Nos2, and Tnfa). For comparison, gene expression was investigated in bone marrow-derived macrophages from Cyp46a1-/- mice as well as retinal and bone marrow-derived macrophages from Cyp27a1-/- and Cyp27a1-/-Cyp46a1-/- mice. CYP46A1 expression was detected in retinal endothelial cells, and this expression was increased in the proinflammatory environment. Retinal Cyp46a1-/- phosphoproteome revealed altered phosphorylation of 30 different proteins, including tight junction protein zonula occludens 1 and aquaporin 4. Collectively, the data obtained establish metabolic and regulatory significance of CYP46A1 for the retina and suggest pharmacologic activation of CYP46A1 as a potential therapeutic approach to dyslipidemia-induced retinal damage.
The activities of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of metabolites are regulated by human cytosolic sulfotransferases (SULTs) - a 13-member family of disease relevant enzymes that catalyze transfer of the sulfuryl moiety (-SO3) from PAPS (3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfonate) to the hydroxyls and amines of acceptors. SULTs harbor two independent allosteric sites, one of which, the focus of this work, binds non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The structure of the first NSAID-binding site - that of SULT1A1 - was elucidated recently and homology modeling suggest that variants of the site are present in all SULT isoforms. The objective of the current study was to assess whether the NSAID-binding site can be used to regulate sulfuryl transfer in humans in an isoform specific manner. Mefenamic acid (Mef) is a potent (Ki 27‚ÄØnM) NSAID-inhibitor of SULT1A1 - the predominant SULT isoform in small intestine and liver. Acetaminophen (APAP), a SULT1A1 specific substrate, is extensively sulfonated in humans. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is specific for SULT2A1, which we show here is insensitive to Mef inhibition. APAP and DHEA sulfonates are readily quantified in urine and thus the effects of Mef on APAP and DHEA sulfonation could be studied non-invasively. Compounds were given orally in a single therapeutic dose to a healthy, adult male human with a typical APAP-metabolite profile. Mef profoundly decreased APAP sulfonation during first pass metabolism and substantially decreased systemic APAP sulfonation without influencing DHEA sulfonation; thus, it appears the NSAID site can be used to control sulfonation in humans in a SULT-isoform specific manner.
A number of studies have demonstrated effects of gestational undernutrition on fetal ovarian development and postnatal female fertility. However the mechanism underlying these effects remains elusive. Using a cohort of animals in which altered gestational nutrition affected indicators of postnatal fertility, this study applies RNAseq to fetal ovaries to identify affected genes and pathways that may underlie the relationship between gestational plane of nutrition and postnatal fertility. Pregnant ewes were exposed to either a maintenance diet or 0.6 of maintenance for the first 55 days of gestation followed by an ad libitum diet. Complementary DNA libraries were constructed from 5-6 fetal ovaries from each nutritional group at both days 55 and 75 of gestation and sequenced using Ion Proton. Of approximately 16,000 transcripts, 69 genes were differentially expressed at day 55 and 145 genes differentially expressed at day 75. At both gestational ages, genes expressed preferentially in germ cells were common amongst the differentially expressed genes. Enriched gene ontology terms included ion transport, nucleic acid binding, protease inhibitor activity and carrier proteins of the albumin family. Affected pathways identified by IPA analysis included LXR/RXR activation, FXR/RXR activation, pathways associated with nitric oxide production and citrullination (by NOS1), vitamin C transport and metabolism, and REDOX reactions. The data offers some insights into potential mechanisms underlying the relationship between gestational plane of nutrition and postnatal fertility observed in these animals. In particular the roles of nitric oxide and protease inhibitors in germ cell development are highlighted and warrant further study.
Cardiovascular disease associated with metabolic syndrome has a high prevalence, but the mechanistic basis of metabolic cardiomyopathy remains poorly understood. We characterised the cardiac transcriptome in a murine metabolic syndrome (MetS) model (LDLR-/-; ob/ob, DKO) relative to the healthy, control heart (C57BL/6, WT) and the transcriptional changes induced by ACE-inhibition in those hearts. RNA-Seq, differential gene expression and transcription factor analysis identified 288 genes differentially expressed between DKO and WT hearts implicating 72 pathways. Hallmarks of metabolic cardiomyopathy were increased activity in integrin-linked kinase signalling, Rho signalling, dendritic cell maturation, production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species in macrophages, atherosclerosis, LXR-RXR signalling, cardiac hypertrophy, and acute phase response pathways. ACE-inhibition had a limited effect on gene expression in WT (55 genes, 23 pathways), and a prominent effect in DKO hearts (1143 genes, 104 pathways). In DKO hearts, ACE-I appears to counteract some of the MetS-specific pathways, while also activating cardioprotective mechanisms. We conclude that MetS and control murine hearts have unique transcriptional profiles and exhibit a partially specific transcriptional response to ACE-inhibition.
Neuronal cell death induced by amyloid-Œ≤ (AŒ≤) oligomers is implicated in neuronal degeneration and is a leading cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, to identify effective therapeutic agents for AD, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of two naturally occurring retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonists (SPF1 and SPF2), isolated from the root of Sophora tonkinensis Gagnep., on the AŒ≤25-35-induced cytotoxicity against nerve growth factor-differentiated rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. Pretreatment with SPFs significantly prevented AŒ≤25-35-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells, similarly to the synthetic RXR agonist bexarotene. These effects were blocked by the RXR antagonist PA452. When the effects of SPFs were studied in the presence of the liver X receptor (LXR) agonist T0901317, the protective effects of SPFs were enhanced, suggesting that RXR/LXR heterodimers may play a key role in the neuroprotective effects of SPFs. SPFs and T0901317 induced ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1) protein expression in PC12 cells when administered alone or in combination. Intriguingly, a functional inhibitor of ABCA1 cyclosporine A negated the neuroprotective effects of SPFs or T0901317. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the RXR agonists SPF1 and SPF2 protect PC12 cells from AŒ≤25-35-induced neurotoxicity in an RXR-dependent manner and that their effects are markedly enhanced by the LXR agonist T0901317, in part related to ABCA1 function. These results suggest a novel approach to the treatment or prevention of AD.
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), an important gasotransmitter, is involved in a variety of cellular functions and pathophysiologic processes. Drug resistance due to alterations in drug trafficking and metabolism severely limits the effectiveness of cancer therapy. This study examined the role of H2S in drug resistance in liver cancer cells.
Human primary hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2) and doxorubicin (Dox)-resistant cells were used in this study. Cell survival was analyzed by MTT, Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide staining and clonogenic assay. Western blotting was used for analysis of protein expression, and immunoprecipitation was used to determine interactions of LXR/RXR.
The expression of H2S-generating enzyme cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) was inhibited by doxorubicin treatment in HepG2 cells, and H2S sensitized Dox-inhibited cell survival and colony formation. In addition, H2S promoted cellular retention of Dox by suppressing the expressions of ABCA1 and ABCG8. H2S significantly blocked Dox-induced heterodimer formation between LXRŒ± and RXRŒ≤ and attenuated the binding of LXRŒ±/RXRŒ≤ to the promoters of ABCA1 and ABCG8 genes. RXRŒ≤ but not LXRŒ± was S-sulfhydrated by H2S, and blockage of RXRŒ≤ S-sulfhydration abolished the inhibitory role of H2S on LXRŒ±/RXRŒ≤ heterodimer formation. CSE expression was reduced in Dox-resistant cells in comparison with their parental cells, while H2S could reverse drug resistance in Dox-resistant cells.
Our study provides a novel solution for reversing drug resistance in cancer cells by targeting H2S signalling.
The study attempted to elucidate whether lipid genes are closely associated with lipid metabolic abnormalities during the lithogenic time and how Yinchenhao Decoction (YCHD) works on the transcriptions of lipid genes against cholesterol gallstone model. C57BL/6J mice fed on lithogenic diet (LD) were used for model establishment and randomized into 5 groups. All groups received LD for different weeks with isometrically intragastric administration of YCHD or NS. Biochemical tests were measured and liver tissues were harvested for histological and genetic detection. It was found that all groups with increasing LD showed a following tendency of gallstone incidence, bile cholesterol, phospholipids, total bile acid, and cholesterol saturation index (CSI). Conversely, YCHD could significantly normalize the levels of gallstone incidence, bile lipids, and CSI (CSI&lt;1). As lithogenic time progressed, ABCG5, ABCG8, PPAR-Œ±, and ABCB4 were upregulated, and SREBP2, CYP7A1, and CYP7B1 were downregulated, while CYP7A1, CYP7B1, LXR, and HMGCR mRNA were increased 3-fold under the administration of YCHD. It was concluded that abnormal expressions of the mentioned genes may eventually progress to cholesterol gallstone. CYP7A1, CYP7B1, LXR, and HMGCR mRNA may be efficient targets of YCHD, which may be a preventive drug to reverse liver injury, normalize bile lipids, facilitate gallstone dissolution, and attenuate gallstone formation.
Production of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), a potent inhibitor of viral infection, is catalyzed by cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H). We previously reported that 25HC induced CH25H expression in a liver X receptor (LXR)-dependent manner, implying that LXR can play an important role in antiviral infection. In this study, we determined that activation of LXR by 25HC or synthetic ligands [T0901317 (T317) or GW3965] inhibited infection of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) or MLV-(VSV)-GFP in HepG2 cells or RAW 264.7 macrophages. Genetic deletion of LXRŒ±, LXRŒ≤, or CH25H expression in HepG2 cells by CRISPR/Cas9 method increased cell susceptibility to HSV-1 infection and attenuated the inhibition of LXR on viral infection. Lack of interferon (IFN)-Œ≥ expression also increased cell susceptibility to viral infection. However, it attenuated, but did not block, the inhibition of LXR on HSV-1 infection. In addition, expression of CH25H, but not IFN-Œ≥, was inversely correlated to cell susceptibility to viral infection and the antiviral actions of LXR. Metabolism of 25HC into 25HC-3-sulfate (25HC3S) by cholesterol sulfotransferase-2B1b moderately reduced the antiviral actions of 25HC because 25HC3S is a weaker inhibitor of HSV-1 infection than 25HC. Furthermore, administration of T317 to BALB/c mice reduced HSV-1 growth in mouse tissues. Taken together, we demonstrate an antiviral system of 25HC with involvement of LXR activation, interaction between CH25H and IFN-Œ≥, and 25HC metabolism.
Although GPR35 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor, synthetic agonists and antagonists have been developed. Recently, cromolyn, a mast cell stabilizer, was reported as an agonist of GPR35 and was shown to exhibit antifibrotic effects through its actions on hepatocytes and stellate cells. In this study, the role of GPR35 in hepatic steatosis was investigated using an in vitro model of liver X receptor (LXR)-mediated hepatocellular steatosis and an in vivo model of high fat diet-induced liver steatosis. GPR35 was expressed in Hep3B human hepatoma cells and mouse primary hepatocytes. A specific LXR activator, T0901317, induced lipid accumulation in Hep3B cells. Lodoxamide, the most potent agonist of GPR35, inhibited lipid accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. The protective effect of lodoxamide was inhibited by a specific GPR35 antagonist, CID2745687, and by siRNA-mediated knockdown of GPR35. The expression of SREBP-1c, a key transcription factor for lipid synthesis, was induced by T0901317 and the induction was inhibited by lodoxamide. Through the use of specific inhibitors of cellular signaling components, the lodoxamide-induced inhibition of lipid accumulation was found to be mediated through p38 MAPKs and JNK, but not through Gi/o proteins and ERKs. Furthermore, the protective effect of lodoxamide was confirmed in mouse primary hepatocytes. Lodoxamide suppressed high fat diet-induced fatty liver development, which suggested the protective function of GPR35 in liver steatosis. Therefore, the present data suggest that GPR35 may function to protect against fatty liver development.
Macrophages are professional phagocytic cells that play key roles in innate and adaptive immunity, metabolism, and tissue homeostasis. Lipid metabolism is tightly controlled at the transcriptional level, and one of the key players of this regulation in macrophages and other cell types is the LXR subfamily of nuclear receptors (LXRŒ± and LXRŒ≤). The use of LXR double knockout (LXR-DKO) macrophages in vitro has yielded extensive benefits in metabolism research, but this technique is hindered by primary macrophage cell expansion capability, which diminishes along terminal cell differentiation process. Here we detail a method to immortalize LXR double knockout bone marrow-derived macrophage cells at an early stage of differentiation, using a retroviral delivery of a combination of murine v-myc and v-raf oncogenes. This methodology enables the generation of autonomous self-renewing macrophages bearing an LXR-DKO genetic background, as a valuable tool for research in lipid metabolism and other LXR receptor-mediated effects.
Pancreatic Œ≤-cells are sensitive to fluctuations in cholesterol content, which can damage the insulin secretion pathway, contributing to the aetiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cholesterol efflux to (apo)lipoproteins, via ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter A1 (ABCA1), can prevent intracellular cholesterol accumulation; in some peripheral cells, ABCA1-dependent efflux is enhanced by promotion of cholesterol trafficking to, and generation of Liver X receptor (LXR) ligands by, mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase (Cyp27A1 (cytochrome P450 27 A1/sterol 27-hydroxylase)) and its redox partners, adrenodoxin (ADX) and ADX reductase (ADXR). Despite this, the roles of mitochondrial cholesterol trafficking (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein [StAR] and 18-kDa translocator protein [TSPO]) and metabolising proteins in insulin-secreting cells remain wholly uncharacterised. Here, we demonstrate an increase in pancreatic expression of Cyp27A1, ADXR, TSPO and LXRŒ±, but not ADX or StAR, in obese (fa/fa) rodents compared with lean (Fa/?) controls. Overexpression of Cyp27A1 alone in BRIN-BD11 cells increased INS2 expression, without affecting lipid metabolism; however, after exposure to low-density lipoprotein (LDL), cholesterol efflux to (apo)lipoprotein acceptors was enhanced in Cyp27A1-overexpressing cells. Co-transfection of Cyp27A1, ADX and ADXR, at a ratio approximating that in pancreatic tissue, stimulated cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) in both basal and cholesterol-loaded cells; insulin release was stimulated equally by all acceptors in cholesterol-loaded cells. Thus, genetic obesity increases pancreatic expression of Cyp27A1, ADXR, TSPO and LXRŒ±, while modulation of Cyp27A1 and its redox partners promotes cholesterol efflux from insulin-secreting cells to acceptor (apo)lipoproteins; this response may help guard against loss of insulin secretion caused by accumulation of excess intracellular cholesterol.
Obesity is a complex disease that has a strong association with diet and lifestyle. Dietary factors can influence the expression of key genes connected to insulin resistance, lipid metabolism, and adipose tissue composition. In this study, our objective was to determine gene expression and fatty acid (FA) profiles in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) from lean and morbidly obese individuals. We also aimed to study the agonist effect of dietary factors on glucose metabolism.
Lean and low and high insulin resistance morbidly obese subjects (LIR-MO and HIR-MO) were included in this study. The gene expression of liver X receptor type alpha (LXR-Œ±) and glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) and the FA profiles in VAT were determined. Additionally, the in vivo and in vitro agonist effects of oleic acid (OA), linoleic acid (LA), and arachidonic acid (AA) by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor type gamma 2 (PPAR-Œ≥2) on the activity of GLUT4 were studied.
Our results showed a dysregulation of GLUT4 and LXR-Œ± in VAT of morbidly obese subjects. In addition, a specific FA profile for morbidly obese individuals was found. Finally, AA was an PPAR-Œ≥2 agonist that activates the expression of GLUT4.
Our study suggests a dysregulation of LXR-Œ± and GLUT4 expression in VAT of morbidly obese individuals. FA profiles in VAT could elucidate their possible role in lipolysis and adipogenesis. Finally, AA binds to PPAR-Œ≥2 to activate the expression of GLUT4 in the HepG2 cell line, showing an alternative insulin-independent activation of GLUT4.
Liver X receptor (LXR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that plays vital roles in maintaining cholesterol and lipid homeostasis. Much work has been done on mammalian LXRs, but the role of LXR in fish remains unclear. In the present study, LXR gene was identified from adult Asian seabass, Lates calcarifer, and its predicted protein structure was docked with several cholesterol derivatives at the binding site. The LXR cDNA consisted of 1495¬†bp encoding a putative LXR protein of 494 amino acids. The Asian seabass LXR retained many important structural features found in LXRs of other fishes and mammals, such as putative signal peptide, activation function-1 (AF-1) domain, DNA-binding domain (DBD), ligand-binding domain (LBD), activation function-2 (AF-2) domain, and eight conserved cysteine residues. The deduced amino acid sequence of LXR shared significant identity with those of other species ranging from 65.7 to 95.8%. The homology modeling and in silico molecular docking demonstrated that Asian seabass LXR could interact with cholesterol derivatives at amino acid residues Phe274 and Ile312. Real-time PCR further revealed that LXR transcripts are ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined, with the highest levels detected in the gonad followed by the liver. Given the well-known importance of cholesterol-mediated signaling in these tissues, Asian seabass LXR may reasonably be involved in reproduction and lipid metabolism.
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a manifestation of systemic atherosclerotic disease. It is assessed by intervention or traditional scoring risk factors. Diagnosis is limited by inaccurate and invasive methods. Developing noninvasive methods to screen for the risk of CAD is a major challenge. We aimed to identify urinary proteins associated with CAD. We utilized iTRAQ labeling followed by 2D LC-MS/MS to compare the urinary proteome of CAD patients to healthy cohorts. The multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was used to verify the differential proteins. ROC analysis based on MRM data was used to evaluate the diagnostic application. A total of 876 proteins were quantified, and 100 differential proteins were found. Functional analysis revealed that the differential proteins were mainly associated with Liver X Receptor/Retinoid X Receptor (LXR/RXR) pathway activation, atherosclerosis signaling, production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species, and the top upstream regulator of the differential proteins by IPA analysis indicated to the APOE. Nineteen differential proteins were verified by MRM analysis. ROC based on MRM data revealed that the combination of two proteins (APOD and TFF1) could diagnose CAD with 85% sensitivity and 99% specificity (AUC 0.95). The urinary proteome might reflect the pathophysiological changes in CAD and be used for the clinical study of CAD.
G0/G1 switch gene 2 (G0S2) is a specific inhibitor of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), the rate-limiting enzyme for intracellular lipolysis. Recent studies show that G0S2 plays a critical role in promoting triacylglycerol (TG) accumulation in the liver, and its encoding gene is a direct target of a major lipogenic transcription factor liver X receptor (LXR)Œ±. Here we sought to investigate a lipolysis-independent role of G0S2 in hepatic triglyceride synthesis. Knockdown of G0S2 decreased hepatic TG content in mice with ATGL ablation. Conversely, overexpression of G0S2 promoted fatty acid incorporation into TGs and diacylglycerols in both wild-type and ATGL-deficient hepatocytes. Biochemical characterization showed that G0S2 mediates phosphatidic acid synthesis from lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and acyl-coenzyme A. In response to a high-sucrose lipogenic diet, G0S2 is up-regulated via LXRŒ± and required for the increased TG accumulation in liver. Furthermore, deletion of a distinct 4-aa motif necessary for the LPA-specific acyltransferase (LPAAT) activity impaired G0S2's ability to mediate TG synthesis both in vitro and in vivo. These studies identify G0S2 as a dual-function regulator of lipid metabolism as well as a novel mechanism whereby hepatic TG storage is promoted in response to lipogenic stimulation. In addition to its role as a lipolytic inhibitor, G0S2 is capable of directly promoting TG synthesis by acting as a lipid-synthesizing enzyme.-Zhang, X., Xie, X., Heckmann, B. L., Saarinen, A. M., Gu, H., Zechner, R., Liu, J. Identification of an intrinsic lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase activity in the lipolytic inhibitor G0/G1 switch gene 2 (G0S2).
Despite a massive industry endeavor to develop RORy-modulators for autoimmune disorders, there has been no indication of efforts to target the close family member RORŒ± for similar indications. This may be due to the misconception that RORŒ± is redundant to RORy, or the inherent difficulty in cultivating tractable starting points for RORŒ±. RORŒ±-selective modulators would be useful tools to interrogate the biology of this understudied orphan nuclear receptor.
The goal of this research effort was to identify and optimize synthetic ligands for RORŒ± starting from the known LXR agonist T0901317.
Fourty-five analogs of the sulfonamide lead (1) were synthesized and evaluated for their ability to suppress the transcriptional activity of RORŒ±, RORy, and LXRŒ± in cell-based assays. Analogs were characterized by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, and LC-MS analysis. The pharmacokinetic profile of the most selective RORŒ± inverse agonist was evaluated in rats with intraperitoneal (i.p.) and per oral (p.o.)dosing.
Structure-activity relationship studies led to potent dual RORŒ±/RORy inverse agonists as well as RORŒ±-selective inverse agonists (20, 28). LXR activity could be reduced by removing the sulfonamide nitrogen substituent. Attempts to improve the potency of these selective leads by varying substitution patterns throughout the molecule proved challenging.
The synthetic RORŒ±-selective inverse agonists identified (20, 28) can be utilized as chemical tools to probe the function of RORŒ± in vitro and in vivo.
X-Linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a severe metabolic disorder characterized by the accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). Recently, we demonstrated that levels of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) and cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) were found to be elevated in X-ALD. Herein, we report that the exogenous addition of 25-HC significantly reduces C26:0 levels in X-ALD patient-derived fibroblasts and oligodendrocytes differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from X-ALD patients. Moreover, 25-HC treatment was found to down-regulate the expression of ELOVL1, a key enzyme for the synthesis of C26. In addition, activation of liver X receptor (LXR), a molecular target of endogenous 25-HC, also reduced C26:0 level. The reduction of C26:0 levels by 25-HC treatment might result, at least partially, from the decrease of ELOVL1 expression as well as the activation of LXR. Our findings could provide a better understanding of the role of 25-HC in X-ALD and useful information to find therapeutic agents to treat X-ALD.
Niacin, the first antidyslipidemic drug, has been at the center stage of lipid research for many decades before the discovery of statins. However, to date, despite its remarkable effects on lipid profiles, the clinical outcomes of niacin treatment on cardiac events is still debated. In addition to its historically well-defined interactions with central players of lipid metabolism, niacin can be processed by eukaryotic cells to synthesize a crucial cofactor, NAD+ NAD+ acts as a cofactor in key cellular processes, including oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, and DNA repair. More recently, evidence has emerged that NAD+ also is an essential cosubstrate for the sirtuin family of protein deacylases and thereby has an impact on a wide range of cellular processes, most notably mitochondrial homeostasis, energy homeostasis, and lipid metabolism. NAD+ achieves these remarkable effects through sirtuin-mediated deacetylation of key transcriptional regulators, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-Œ±, LXR, and SREBPs, that control these cellular processes. Here, we present an alternative point of view to explain niacin's mechanism of action, with a strong focus on the importance of how this old drug acts as a control switch of NAD+/sirtuin-mediated control of metabolism.
The nuclear receptor liver X receptor (LXR) impacts on cholesterol metabolism as well as hepatic lipogenesis via transcriptional regulation. It is proposed that inhibition of the protein arginine methyltransferase 3 (PRMT3) uncouples these two transcriptional pathways in vivo by acting as a specific lipogenic coactivator of LXR. Here we validated the hypothesis that treatment with the allosteric PRMT3 inhibitor SGC707 will diminish the hepatic steatosis extent, while leaving global cholesterol metabolism, important in cholesterol-driven pathologies like atherosclerosis, untouched. For this purpose, 12-week old hyperlipidemic apolipoprotein E knockout mice were fed a Western-type diet for six weeks to induce both hepatic steatosis and atherosclerosis. The mice received 3 intraperitoneal injections with SGC707 or solvent control per week. Mice chronically treated with SGC707 developed less severe hepatic steatosis as exemplified by the 51% reduced (P‚ÄØ&lt;‚ÄØ0.05) liver triglyceride levels. In contrast, the extent of in vivo macrophage foam cell formation and aortic root atherosclerosis was not affected by SGC707 treatment. Interestingly, SGC707-treated mice gained 94% less body weight (P‚ÄØ&lt;‚ÄØ0.05), which was paralleled by changes in white adipose tissue morphology, i.e. reduction in adipocyte size and browning. In conclusion, we have shown that through PRMT3 inhibitor treatment specific functions of LXR involved in respectively the development of fatty liver disease and atherosclerosis can be uncoupled, resulting in an overall diminished hepatic steatosis extent without a negative impact on atherosclerosis susceptibility. As such, our studies highlight that PRMT3 inhibition may constitute a novel therapeutic approach to limit the development of fatty liver disease in humans.
Proteins play an essential role in the biological processes associated with cancer. Their altered expression levels can deregulate critical cellular pathways and interactive networks. In this study, the mass spectrometry-based label-free quantification followed by functional annotation was performed to investigate the most significant deregulated proteins among tissues of primary breast tumor (PT) and axillary metastatic lymph node (LN) and corresponding non-tumor tissues contralateral (NCT) and adjacent (ANT) from patients diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma. A total of 462 proteins was observed as differentially expressed (DEPs) among the groups analyzed. A high level of similarity was observed in the proteome profile of both non-tumor breast tissues and DEPs (n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ12) were mainly predicted in the RNA metabolism. The DEPs among the malignant and non-tumor breast tissues [n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ396 (PTxNCT) and n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ410 (LNxNCT)] were related to pathways of the LXR/RXR, NO, eNOS, eIF2 and sirtuins, tumor-related functions, fatty acid metabolism and oxidative stress. Remarkable similarity was observed between both malignant tissues, which the DEPs were related to metastatic capabilities. Altogether, our findings revealed differential proteomic profiles that affected cancer associated and interconnected signaling processes. Validation studies are recommended to demonstrate the potential of individual proteins and/or pathways as biological markers in breast cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: The proteomic analysis of this study revealed high similarity in the proteomic profile of the contralateral and adjacent non-tumor breast tissues. Significant differences were identified among the proteome of the malignant and non-tumor tissue groups of the same patients, providing relevant insights into the hallmarks, signaling pathways, biological functions, and interactive protein networks that act during tumorigenesis and breast cancer progression. These proteins are suggested as targets of relevant interest to be explored as potential biological markers related to tumor development and metastatic progression in the breast cancer disease.
In bovine mammary tissue and cells, liver X receptor (LXR) regulates lipid synthesis mainly via transactivation of the transcription factor sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1). In the present work, we investigated the role of LXR in controlling lipid synthesis via transactivation of SREBP1 in goat primary mammary cells (GMEC). The GMEC were treated with a synthetic agonist of LXR, T0901317, and transactivation and transcription of SREBP1, expression of lipogenic genes, and fatty acid profiling and triacylglycerol (TAG) content of the cells were measured. A mild increase in the mRNA expression level of LXRŒ± (NR1H3) was observed following treatment with different concentrations of T0901317, and a dose-dependent increase in mRNA and transactivation of SREBP1 was detected. Activation of LXR resulted in a significant increase in the mRNA expression of most of the measured genes related to de novo synthesis, desaturation, and transport of fatty acids; TAG synthesis; and transcription regulators. Compared with the control, total content of cellular TAG increased by more than 20% with T0901317 treatment. Furthermore, addition of T0901317 increased the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids (e.g., C16:1, C18:1, C20:1, and C22:1), and decreased the proportion of saturated fatty acids (e.g., C16:0, C18:0, C20:0, and C22:0). These results provide evidence that LXR regulates the expression and activity of SREBP1. Our results indicated that LXR participate in regulating the transcription of genes involved in milk fat synthesis in GMEC in an SREBP1-dependent fashion.
Schisandrachinensisbee pollen has been used as a health food in China for centuries; however, its bioactive constituents and functions are not very clear. In this study, we investigated the phenolic compounds of Schisandrachinensisbee pollen extract (SCPE) by UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-HRMS/HPLC-DAD-ECD and its prevention from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and modulation of gut microbiota in high fat diet induced obese C57BL/6 mice. The results showed that 12 phenolic compounds were identified in SCPE, and naringenin, rutin and chrysin were the main constituents. The content of naringenin reached 1.89 mg/g, and total phenolic content (TPC) of SCPE were 101.83 mg GA/g. After obese mice were administrated with SCPE at 7.86 and 15.72 g/kg BW for 8 weeks, body weight gains were reduced by 18.23% and 19.37%. SCPE could decrease fasting blood glucose, cut down the lipid accumulation in serum and liver, lessen oxidative injury and inflammation in obesity mice. Moreover, SCPE could effectively inhibit the formation of NAFLD by inhibition of LXR-Œ±, SREBP-1c and FAS genes expression, and modulate the structural alteration of gut microbiota in obesity mice. These findings suggested that SCPE could attenuate the features of the metabolism syndrome in obesity mice, which can be used to prevent obesity and NAFLD of human beings.
We have previously demonstrated the pro-tumoral role of neutrophils using a kras-induced zebrafish hepatocarcinogenesis model. To further illustrate the molecular basis of the pro-tumoral role, Tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and transcriptomic analyses were carried out by RNA-Seq. Differentially expressed gene profiles of TANs from larvae, male and female livers indicate great variations during liver tumorigenesis, but the common responsive canonical pathways included an immune pathway (Acute Phase Response Signaling), a liver metabolism-related pathway (LXR/RXR Activation) and Thrombin Signaling. Consistent with the pro-tumoral role of TANs, gene module analysis identified a consistent down-regulation of Cytotoxicity module, which may allow continued proliferation of malignant cells. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis indicated up-regulation of several genes promoting angiogenesis. Consistent with this, we found decreased density of blood vessels accompanied with decreased oncogenic liver sizes in neutrophil-depleted larvae. Collectively, our study has indicated some molecular mechanisms of the pro-tumoral roles of TANs in hepatocarcinogenesis, including weakened immune clearance against tumor cells and enhanced function in angiogenesis.
Dendritic cells (DCs) initiate adaptive immune responses after their migration to secondary lymphoid organs. The LXR ligands/oxysterols and the RXR ligand 9-cis Retinoic Acid (9-cis RA) were shown to dampen DC migration to lymphoid organs through the inhibition of CCR7 expression. We performed transcriptomics of DCs undergoing maturation in the presence of the LXR ligand 22R-Hydroxycholesterol (22R-HC). The analysis highlighted more than 1500 genes modulated by 22R-HC treatment, including the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM)-1, which was found markedly up-regulated. We tested the effect of other nuclear receptor ligands (NRL) and we reported the induction of TREM-1 following RXR, RAR and VDR activation. From a functional point of view, triggering of TREM-1 induced by retinoids increased TNFŒ± and IL-1Œ≤ release, suggesting an active role of NRL-activated TREM-1+ DCs in inflammation-driven diseases, including cancer. Consistently with this hypothesis we detected DCs expressing TREM-1 in pleural effusions and ascites of cancer patients, an observation validated by the induction of TREM-1, LXR and RAR target genes when monocyte-DCs were activated in the presence of tumor-conditioned fluids. Finally, we observed a better control of LLC tumor growth in Trem-1-/- bone marrow chimera mice as compared to wild type chimera mice. Future studies will be necessary to shed light on the mechanism of TREM-1 induction by distinct NRL, and to characterize the role of TREM-1+ DCs in tumor growth.
Pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.) is a legume crop consumed as an indigenous vegetable in the human diet and a traditional medicinal plant with therapeutic properties. The current study highlights the cholesterol-modulating effect and underlying mechanisms of the methanol extract of Cajanus cajan L. leaves (MECC) in HepG2 cells. We found that MECC increased the LDLR expression, the cell-surface LDLR levels and the LDL uptake activity in HepG2 cells. We further demonstrated that MECC suppressed the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) mRNA and protein expression, but not affected the expression of other cholesterol or lipid metabolism-related genes including inducible degrader of LDLR (IDOL), HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), fatty acid synthase (FASN), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC1), and liver X receptor-Œ± (LXR-Œ±) in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that MECC down-regulated the PCSK9 gene expression through reducing the amount of nuclear hepatocyte nuclear factor-1Œ± (HNF-1Œ±), a major transcriptional regulator for activation of PCSK9 promoter, but not that of nuclear sterol-responsive element binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) in HepG2 cells. Finally, we identified the cajaninstilbene acid, a main bioactive stilbene component in MECC, which significantly modulated the LDLR and PCSK9 expression in HepG2 cells. Our current data suggest that the cajaninstilbene acid may contribute to the hypocholesterolemic activity of Cajanus cajan L. leaves. Our findings support that the extract of Cajanus cajan L. leaves may serve as a cholesterol-lowering agent.
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) constitutes an autoimmune disease characterized by the breakdown of tolerance to self-antigens, sustained production of pathogenic autoantibodies, and damage to multiple organs and tissues. Nanoparticle (NP)-based therapeutics have demonstrated efficacy in attenuating the progression of SLE. However, investigations of nano-drugs that address the crucial initiating factor in the pathogenesis of SLE; e.g., inefficient clearance of apoptotic cells by phagocytes and consequent accumulation of self-antigens, have seldom been reported. Here, an apoptotic cell-mimicking gold nanocage (AuNC)-based nano drug carrier capable of correcting the impaired clearance of apoptotic cells in SLE was rationally designed and generated by conjugating phosphatidylserine (PS) on the surface of liposome-coated AuNCs for liver X receptor (LXR) agonist T0901317 delivery. Notably, PS-lipos-AuNC@T0901317 could efficiently enhance apoptotic cell clearance by elevating the expression of Mer, one of the pivotal phagocytosis-associated receptors on macrophages, resulting in decreased production of anti-dsDNA autoantibodies, reduced inflammatory response, and alleviation of kidney damage in lupus model mice. Additionally, PS-lipos-AuNC could be tracked by photoacoustic imaging for nano drug carrier biodistribution. By addressing the crucial pathogenic factor of SLE, the NP-based delivery system in this study is envisioned to provide a promising strategy to treat this complex and challenging disease.
Smoking alters pulmonary reverse lipid transport and leads to intracellular lipid accumulation in alveolar macrophages. We investigated whether stimulating reverse lipid transport with an agonist of the liver X receptor (LXR) would help alveolar macrophages limit lipid accumulation and dampen lung inflammation in response to cigarette smoke. Mice were exposed to cigarette smoke and treated intraperitoneally with the LXR agonist T0901317. Expression of lipid capture and lipid export genes was assessed in lung tissue and alveolar macrophages. Pulmonary inflammation was assessed in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Finally, cholesterol efflux capacity and pulmonary surfactant levels were determined. In room air-exposed mice, T0901317 increased the expression of lipid export genes in macrophages and the whole lung and increased cholesterol efflux capacity without inducing inflammation or affecting the pulmonary surfactant. However, cigarette smoke-exposed mice treated with T0901317 showed a marked increase in BAL neutrophils, IL-1Œ±, C-C motif chemokine ligand 2, and granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor levels. T0901317 treatment in cigarette smoke-exposed mice failed to increase the ability of alveolar macrophages to export cholesterol and markedly exacerbated IL-1Œ± release. Finally, T0901317 led to pulmonary surfactant depletion only in cigarette smoke-exposed mice. This study shows that hyperactivation of LXR and the associated lipid capture/export mechanisms only have minor pulmonary effects on the normal lung. However, in the context of cigarette smoke exposure, where the pulmonary surfactant is constantly oxidized, hyperactivation of LXR has dramatic adverse effects, once again showing the central role of lipid homeostasis in the pulmonary response to cigarette smoke exposure.
Objective- APOA5 variants are strongly associated with hypertriglyceridemia, as well as increased risks of cardiovascular disease and acute pancreatitis. Hypertriglyceridemia in apo AV dysfunction often aggravates by environmental factors such as high-carbohydrate diets or aging. To date, the molecular mechanisms by which these environmental factors induce hypertriglyceridemia are poorly defined, leaving the high-risk hypertriglyceridemia condition undertreated. Previously, we reported that LXR (liver X receptor)-SREBP (sterol regulatory element-binding protein)-1c pathway regulates large-VLDL (very low-density lipoprotein) production induced by LXR agonist. However, the pathophysiological relevance of the finding remains unknown. Approach and Results- Here, we reconstitute the environment-induced hypertriglyceridemia phenotype of human APOA5 deficiency in Apoa5-/- mice and delineate the role of SREBP-1c in vivo by generating Apoa5-/- ;Srebp-1c-/- mice. The Apoa5-/- mice, which showed moderate hypertriglyceridemia on a chow diet, developed severe hypertriglyceridemia on high-carbohydrate feeding or aging as seen in patients with human apo AV deficiency. These responses were nearly completely abolished in the Apoa5-/- ;Srebp-1c-/- mice. Further mechanistic studies revealed that in response to these environmental factors, SREBP-1c was activated to increase triglyceride synthesis and to permit the incorporation of triglyceride into abnormally large-VLDL particles, which require apo AV for efficient clearance. Conclusions- Severe hypertriglyceridemia develops only when genetic factors (apo AV deficiency) and environmental effects (SREBP-1c activation) coexist. We demonstrate that the regulated production of large-sized VLDL particles via SREBP-1c determines plasma triglyceride levels in apo AV deficiency. Our findings explain the long-standing enigma of the late-onset hypertriglyceridemia phenotype of apo AV deficiency and suggest a new approach to treat hypertriglyceridemia by targeting genes that mediate environmental effects.
Although shikimic acid from Illicium verum has antioxidant, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic effects, the effect of shikimic acid on lipogenesis has not yet been explored. Thus, in the present study, hypolipogenic mechanism of shikimic acid was examined in HepG2, Huh7 and 3T3-L1 adipocyte cells. Shikimic acid showed weak cytotoxicity in HepG2, Huh7 and 3T3-L1 cells, but suppressed lipid accumulation in HepG2, Huh7 and 3T3-L1 cells by Oil Red O staining. Also, shikimic acid attenuated the mRNA expression of de novo lipogenesis related genes such as FAS, SREBP-1c, and LXR-Œ± in HepG2 cells by RT-PCR analysis and suppressed the protein expression of SREBP-1c and LXR-Œ± in HepG2 and 3T3-L1 cells. It should be noted that shikimic acid activated phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/Aacetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) and reduced the expression of MID1 Interacting Protein 1 (MID1IP1) in HepG2, Huh7 and 3T3-L1 cells. Conversely, depletion of MID1IP1 activated phosphorylation of AMPK, while overexpression of MID1IP1 suppressed phosphorylation of AMPK in HepG2 cells. However, AMPK inhibitor compound c did not affect the expression of MID1IP1, indicating MID1IP1 as an upstream of AMPK. Taken together, our findings suggest that shikimic acid has hypolipogenic effect in HepG2 and 3T3-L1 cells via phosphorylation of AMPK/ACC and inhibition of MID1IP1 as a potent candidate for prevention or treatment of fatty liver and hyperlipidemia.
Glioblastoma is a highly lethal adult brain tumor with no effective treatments. In this review, we discuss the potential to target cholesterol metabolism as a new strategy for treating glioblastomas. Twenty percent of cholesterol in the body is in the brain, yet the brain is unique among organs in that it has no access to dietary cholesterol and must synthesize it de novo. This suggests that therapies targeting cholesterol synthesis in brain tumors might render their effects without compromising cell viability in other organs. We will describe cholesterol synthesis and homeostatic feedback pathways in normal brain and brain tumors, as well as various strategies for targeting these pathways for therapeutic intervention.
Estrogenic contaminants released into water bodies are potentially affecting the reproduction of aquatic organisms. Exposure to 17Œ±-ethinylestradiol (EE2), a synthetic estrogen agonist commonly found in sewage effluents, has been shown to cause gonadal changes in male gonochoristic fish ranging from gonadal intersex to complete sex reversal. Although these gonadal changes have been well studied in Japanese medaka Oryzias latipes, the molecular mechanisms behind them are poorly understood. Our objective was to study the signaling pathways elicited by exposure to different concentrations of EE2 in this species. Embryos and larvae were sexed by the presence of leucophores and dmy expression (only in males). Male medaka were exposed to two EE2 concentrations (30 and 300‚Äâng/L) during their gonadal differentiation period (7-22 dpf). The transcriptome of larvae was analyzed using RNA sequencing followed by pathway analysis. Genes involved in sex differentiation and gonadal development (e.g., cldn19, ctbp1, hsd17b4) showed a female-like expression pattern in EE2-exposed males with some genes changing in expression in an EE2 concentration-dependent manner. However, not all genes known to be involved in sex differentiation and gonadal development (e.g., wnt4b) were altered by EE2. Several of the prominently affected signaling pathways involved genes associated with steroidogenesis, steroid receptor signaling and steroid metabolism, such as cyp2b3, cyp3b40, cyp1a, hsd17b4. We also report on novel genes and pathways affected that might play a role in gonadal changes, including several genes associated with FXR/RXR and LXR/RXR activation networks. This study is the first to examine the transcriptomic changes in male fish resulting from exposure to EE2 during the gonadal differentiation period, providing new insights on the signaling pathways involved in the development of gonadal changes in gonochoristic fish.
The selection of active compounds for the quality evaluation of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), specifically complex formulas, remains a challenge for researchers, as components selected as indexes usually have no clear relation with the therapeutic effects of interest. As a suggested resolution, quality control markers (Q-markers) showed good perspective for discriminating numerous compounds found for specific efficacies. In the presented study, the components of the Yinlan (YL) capsule, a TCM patent formula comprising four ingredients, were evaluated and selected for their lipid regulatory effects using principles for Q-marker selection.
The mechanism of TCM therapeutic effects involves several pathways and targets that combine to become an integrated action in the body. Therefore, it is assumed that specific compounds in YL should have good affinity for related targets and obvious effects (both up- and downregulating). Thus, a series of experiments, including cytobiology, animal-based pharmacodynamics, computer-assisted drug design, conventional content determination and pharmacokinetics, would be helpful for the selection and final confirmation of Q-markers.
The capsule was first administered to Wistar mice fed a high-fat diet and tested for their triglycerides (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) values to evaluate the effectiveness of YL. Then, liver tissue was extracted for gene expression. According to the results, the compounds in YL with good affiliation were selected and determined using UHPLC-MS-MS, and those with adequate results in the capsule were chosen as Q-marker candidates. Finally, pharmacokinetics research was performed; the candidates with desirable metabolite and bioavailability parameters were confirmed as Q-markers of YL.
YL capsule was capable of lowering TG and TC levels. For target selection, the expression of LXR mRNA increased significantly at all three tested dosages. Downstream genes, such as LCAT, CYP7A1, and ABCA1, and intestinal FXR mRNA also showed significant increases in expression. For screening of the Q-marker candidates, 5 compounds were selected according to abovementioned results. The pharmacokinetics research demonstrated that the rats exploited lupeol and ginsenoside Rb3 in a desirable pattern with adequate bioavailability, which confirmed their roles as lipid regulatory Q-markers.
The YL capsule was demonstrated to have obvious lipid regulatory effects, which are mainly exerted by targeting LXR and its related pathway. Lupeol and ginsenoside Rb3 were validated as Q-markers that represent the anti-hyperlipidemia activity of the capsule.
Previous findings supported that fetuin B, a new hepatokine, may be involved in the development of hepatic steatosis, but the mechanism is still unknown. This study aims to investigate the role of fetuin B in hepatic steatosis in C57BL/6 mice and HepG2 cells. 1) We found that the administration of recombinant fetuin B aggravated hepatic lipid accumulation caused by free fatty acids (FFAs) or high fat diet, in vivo and in vitro. It lowered the phosphorylated AMPK levels and activated the LXR-SREBP1c pathway, accompanied by the downregulation of fatty acid oxidation and upregulation of lipogenesis. Furthermore, in HepG2 cells exposed to recombinant fetuin B and FFAs, the AMPK agonist depressed the LXR-SREBP1c pathway and alleviated lipid accumulation. The knockdown of LXR protected against steatosis but failed to change phosphorylated AMPK. 2) The knockdown of fetuin B by siRNA or shRNA alleviated lipid accumulation, in vivo and in vitro. It enhanced phosphorylated AMPK and depressed the LXR-SREBP1c pathway, accompanied by upregulation of fatty acid oxidation and downregulation of lipogenesis. Moreover, in HepG2 cells exposed to fetuin B siRNA and FFAs, LXR agonist aggravated lipid accumulation but failed to influence AMPK. This study indicated that fetuin B aggravated LXR-mediated hepatic steatosis through AMPK. It might offer new insights into clinical management and biomarker research on fatty liver.
A study of the structural requirements of cholic acid derivatives as liver‚ÄØX‚ÄØreceptor (LXR) ligands was performed. A model of cholenamide derivative 1 complexed with LXR showed that the C24 carbonyl oxygen forms a hydrogen bond with His435 located close to Trp457. The N,N-dimethyl group is located in a hydrophobic pocket. Based on these data, we designed compounds with high affinity for LXRs. Cholenamide derivatives 1-11 were synthesized from 3Œ≤-acetyl-Œî5-cholenic acid 20, and lactams 12-19 were synthesized from alcohol 25. Tertiary amides 3 and 4 showed higher activity in reporter assays, and compounds with hydrophobic residues exhibited the highest activity of all derivatives. The stereochemistry at C23 was found to be an important determinant of EC50 and gene transactivation, as each isomer exhibited different activity.
Obesity and rheumatic disease are mechanistically linked via chronic inflammation. The orphan receptor TREM-1 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1) is a potent amplifier of proinflammatory and noninfectious immune responses. Here, we show that the pan modulator SR1903 effectively blocks TREM-1 activation. SR1903 emerged from a chemical series of potent RORŒ≥ inverse agonists, although unlike close structural analogues, it has modest agonist activity on LXR and weak repressive activity (inverse agonism) of PPARŒ≥, three receptors that play essential roles in inflammation and metabolism. The anti-inflammatory and antidiabetic efficacy of this unique modulator in collagen-induced arthritis and diet-induced obesity mouse models is demonstrated. Interestingly, in the context of obesity, SR1903 aided in the maintenance of the thymic homeostasis unlike selective RORŒ≥ inverse agonists. SR1903 was well-tolerated following chronic administration, and combined, these data suggest that it may represent a viable strategy for treatment of both metabolic and inflammatory disease. More importantly, the ability of SR1903 to block LPS signaling suggests the potential utility of this unique polypharmacological modulator for treatment of innate immune response disorders.
Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is linked to the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and thus has been suggested to be an important therapeutic target. In our drug screening effort, we identified Ondansetron (OS), an FDA-approved 5-HT3 antagonist, as an apoE-modulating drug. OS at low micromolar concentrations significantly increased apoE secretion from immortalized astrocytes and primary astrocytes derived from apoE3 and apoE4-targeted replacement mice without generating cellular toxicity. Other 5-HT3 antagonists also had similar effects as OS, though their effects were milder and required higher concentrations. Antagonists for other 5-HT receptors did not increase apoE secretion. OS also increased mRNA and protein levels of the ATB-binding cassette protein A1 (ABCA1), which is involved in lipidation and secretion of apoE. Accordingly, OS increased high molecular weight apoE. Moreover, the liver X receptor (LXR) and ABCA1 antagonists blocked the OS-induced increase of apoE secretion, indicating that the LXR-ABCA1 pathway is involved in the OS-mediated facilitation of apoE secretion from astrocytes. The effects of OS on apoE and ABCA1 were also observed in human astrocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) carrying the APOE Œµ3/Œµ3 and APOE Œµ4/Œµ4 genotypes. Oral administration of OS at clinically-relevant doses affected apoE levels in the liver, though the effects in the brain were not observed. Collectively, though further studies are needed to probe its effects in vivo, OS could be a potential therapeutic drug for AD by modulating poE metabolism through the LXR-ABCA1 pathway.
After 15 years of research into Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutics, including billions of US dollars provided by federal agencies, pharmaceutical companies and private foundations, there are still no meaningful therapies that can delay the onset or slow the progression of AD. Understanding of the proteolytic processing of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) and the hypothesis that pathogenic mechanisms in familial and sporadic forms of AD are very similar, led to the assumption that pharmacological inhibition of secretases or immunological approaches to clear amyloid depositions in brain would have been the core of drug discovery strategies and successful therapies. However, there are other understudied approaches including: targeting genes, gene networks and metabolic pathways outside the proteolytic processing of APP. The advancement of newly developed sequencing technologies and mass-spectrometry, as well as the availability of animal models expressing human APOE isoforms has been critical in rationalizing additional AD-therapeutics. The purpose of this review is to present one of those approaches, based on the role of ligand activated Nuclear Liver X and Retinoid X Receptors in brain. This therapeutic approach was initially proposed utilizing in vitro models 15 years ago and has since been examined in numerous studies using AD-like mouse models.
Atherosclerosis is a chronic progressive inflammation course, which could induce life-threatening diseases such as stroke and myocardial infarction. Optimal medical treatments for atherosclerotic risk factors with current antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs (for example, statins) are widely used in clinical practice. However, many patients with established disease still continue to have recurrent cardiovascular events in spite of treatment with a state-of-the-art therapy. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Hence, current treatment of atherosclerosis is still far from being satisfactory. Recently, M2 macrophages have been found associated with atherosclerosis regression. The M2 phenotype can secrete anti-inflammatory factors such as IL-10 and TGF-Œ≤, promote tissue remodeling and repairing through collagen formation, and clear dying cells and debris by efferocytosis. Therefore, modulators targeting macrophages' polarization to the M2 phenotype could be another promising treatment strategy for atherosclerosis. Two main signaling pathways, the Akt/mTORC/LXR pathway and the JAK/STAT6 pathway, are found playing important roles in M2 polarization. In addition, researchers have reported several potential approaches to modulate M2 polarization. Inhibiting or activating some kinds of enzymes, affecting transcription factors, or acting on several membrane receptors could regulate the polarization of the M2 phenotype. Besides, biomolecules, for example vitamin D, were found to affect the process of M2 polarization. Pomegranate juice could promote M2 polarization via unclear mechanism. In this review, we will discuss how M2 macrophages affect atherosclerosis regression, signal transduction in M2 polarization, and outline potential targets and compounds that affect M2 polarization, thus controlling the progress of atherosclerosis.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming a worldwide health problem, but no approved medical treatment exists so far. Nuclear receptors are one of the drug targets for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Among them, liver X receptor (LXR) has been studied in recent years in tumors, metabolic diseases and inflammatory diseases, but its physiological and pharmacological effects in the treatment of NASH are controversial. Activation of LXR has the potential to modulate cholesterol homeostasis, induce anti-inflammatory effects and increase insulin sensitivity, but liver lipid deposition and hypertriglyceridemia are also increased. Inhibition of liver LXR transcriptional activity in the context of NAFLD can effectively alleviate hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis but elevates the risk of potential cardiovascular disease. The contradictory pharmacodynamic effects of LXR in the treatment of NASH increase the difficulty of developing targeted drugs. Moreover, natural compounds play an important part in drug development, and in recent years, some natural compounds have been reported to treat NAFLD by acting on LXR or LXR pathways with fewer adverse reactions, presenting a promising therapeutic prospect. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of LXR in NASH and summarize the natural products reported to modulate NAFLD via LXR or the LXR pathway, offering an alternative approach for LXR-related drug development in NAFLD.
The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is known to regulate the gene expression of SR‚ÄëBI, which mediates plasma high‚Äëdensity lipoprotein (HDL)‚Äëcholesterol uptake. Our previous study demonstrated that the activation of FXR by obeticholic acid (OCA) lowered plasma HDL‚Äëcholesterol levels and increased the hepatic mRNA and protein expression levels of SR‚ÄëBI in hypercholesterolemic hamsters, but not in normolipidemic hamsters, suggesting that dietary cholesterol may be involved in the OCA‚Äëinduced transcription of SR‚ÄëBI. In the present study, a functional 90‚Äëbase‚Äëpair regulatory region was identified in the first intron of the SR‚ÄëBI gene of hamster and mouse that contains a FXR response element (IR‚Äë1) and an adjacent liver X receptor (LXR) response element (LXRE). By in vitro DNA binding and luciferase reporter gene assays, it was demonstrated that FXR and LXR bind to their recognition sequences within this intronic region and transactivate the SR‚ÄëBI reporter gene in a synergistic manner. It was also shown that mutations at either the IR‚Äë1 site or the LXRE site eliminated OCA‚Äëmediated gene transcription. Utilizing chow‚Äëfed hamsters as an in vivo model, it was demonstrated that treating normolipidemic hamsters with OCA or GW3965 alone did not effectively induce levels of SR‚ÄëBI, whereas their combined treatment significantly increased the mRNA and protein levels of SR‚ÄëBI in the liver. The study further investigated effects of FXR and LXR coactivation on the gene expression of SR‚ÄëBI in human liver cells. The intronic FXRE and LXRE regulatory region was not conserved in the human SR‚ÄëBI genomic sequence, however, higher mRNA expression levels of SR‚ÄëBI were observed in human primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells exposed to combined treatments of FXR and LXR agonists, compared with those in cells exposed to individual ligand treatment. Therefore, these results suggest that human SR‚ÄëBI gene transcription may also be subject to concerted activation by FXR and LXR, mediated via currently unidentified regulatory sequences.
Blood has been widely collected and analyzed for diagnosing and monitoring diseases in humans and animals; a range of plasma proteins and peptide can be used as biomarkers to describe pathological or physiological status. Changes in the environment such as high-altitude hypoxia (HAH) can lead to adaptive changes in the blood system of mammals. However, the adaptation mechanism induced by HAH remains unclear. In this study, we used 12 multiparous Jersey cattle (400 ¬± 35 kg, average 3 yr old, dry period). We applied an iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation) proteomics approach and microRNA (miRNA) microarray to explore differences in the plasma proteomic and miRNA profiles of Jersey cattle exposed to HAH conditions in Nyingchi, Tibet (altitude 3,000 m) and HAH-free conditions in Shenyang, China (altitude 50 m). Such quantitative proteomic strategies are suitable for accurate and comprehensive prediction of miRNA targets. In total, 264 differentially expressed proteins (127 upregulated, fold-change &gt;1.2; 137 downregulated, fold-change &lt;0.8) and 47 differential miRNAs (25 upregulated, fold-change &gt;2; 22 downregulated, fold-change &lt;0.5) were observed in the HAH-stressed group compared with the HAH-free group. Integrative analysis of proteomic and miRNA profiles demonstrated that the biological processes associated with differentially expressed proteins were immune response, complement system, and conjugation system. Integrative analysis of canonical pathways showed that most were associated with acute phase response signaling (z-score = -0.125), liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor (LXR/RXR) activation pathway (z-score = 1.134), coagulation system (z-score = -0.943), and complement system (z-score = -0.632). The current results indicated that Jersey cattle exposed to HAH could adapt to that condition through regulation of inflammatory homeostasis by inhibiting the acute phase response, coagulation system, and complement system and promoting LXR/RXR activation.
LXR-623 (WAY-252623), a liver X receptor agonist, reduces atherosclerotic plaque progression and remarkably inhibits the proliferation of glioblastoma cells, owing to its brain-penetrant ability. However, the role of LXR-623 against the proliferation of other cancer cells and the underlying mechanism remain unknown. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) serve as novel and crucial regulators that participate in cancer tumorigenesis and diverse biological processes. Here, we report a previously uncharacterized mechanism underlying lncRNA-mediated exocytosis of LXR-623 via the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)/protein kinase B (AKT)/p53 axis to suppress the proliferation of cancer cells in vitro. We found that LXR-623 significantly inhibited the proliferation and induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at S phase in breast cancer cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Experiments using a xenograft mouse model revealed the inhibitory effects of LXR-623 on tumor growth. We used lncRNA microarray to investigate the potential genes regulated by LXR-623. As a result, LINC01125 was found to be significantly upregulated in the cells treated with LXR-623. Gain- and loss-of-function assays were conducted to investigate the anti-proliferation role of LINC01125. LINC01125 knockdown resulted in the inhibition of the cytotoxic effect of LXR-623; in contrast, LINC01125 overexpression significantly enhanced the effect of LXR-623. LXR-623 and LINC01125-mediated anti-growth regulation is, at least in part, associated with the participation of the PTEN/AKT/mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2)/p53 pathway. In addition, SF1670, a specific PTEN inhibitor with prolonged intracellular retention, may strongly block the anti-proliferation effect induced by LXR-623 and LINC01125 overexpression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay results suggest that p53 binds to the promoter of LINC01125 to strengthen the expression of the PTEN/AKT pathway. Taken together, our findings suggest that LXR-623 possesses significant antitumor activity in breast cancer cells that is partly mediated through the upregulation in LINC01125 expression and enhancement in apoptosis via the PTEN/AKT/MDM2/p53 pathway.
Far beyond hemostasis and thrombosis, significant evidence has indicated the critical role of platelets in atherosclerosis. SDF-1 is among the pro-inflammatory chemokines that are increased in platelets of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The goal of the current work is to identify the in vitro effect of platelets from either CAD patients or healthy volunteers on the induction of macrophages and foam cells.
The expression of SDF-1 on platelet surfaces in CAD patients and healthy volunteers was investigated using flow cytometry. We also evaluated the CXCR4/CXCR7 expression on monocytes from buffy coats of healthy volunteers. The effect of platelets from CAD patients and healthy volunteers on differentiation of monocytes and foam cell formation was evaluated using Oil Red O (ORO) staining. Flow cytometry and real-time PCR were also employed to evaluate surface markers and mRNA expression of genes involved in this process after co-culture of platelets with monocytes.
Monocytes in co-culture with platelets acquired a spindleshape appearance and ORO-positive lipid droplets. In addition, platelets could induce CD163 expression, as an important marker of M2 macrophage, and upregulate the mRNA expression of the SRB, CD36, ACAT, LXR-Œ±, and ABCA1 genes in monocytes. Notably, platelets of CAD patients with higher expression of SDF-1, increased the expression of genes encoding SRB and CD36 as compared to platelets of healthy volunteers.
Our results indicate that platelets from CAD patients could provoke monocyte differentiation into macrophages with an M2 phenotype, which in turn may participate in an atheroprotective process.

Atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the arterial wall. Macrophages are considered to be closely associated with the development and progression of AS. However, the precise mechanism of miR-17-5p in the macrophages under AS remains incompletely clarified. This study investigated the regulatory effect of miR-17-5p on the inflammation and lipid accumulation in mouse macrophages both in¬†vivo and in¬†vitro. It was found that miR-17-5p was highly expressed with lowered ATP-binding cassette transporterA1 (ABCA1) level in the peripheral blood leucocytes (PBLs) of AS patients. Moreover, the level of miR-17-5p was up-regulated in the macrophages of ApoE-/- mice fed with a high-cholesterol diet. Furthermore, we injected miR-17-5p antagomir into AS mice or transfected miR-17-5p inhibitors into mouse macrophage RAW264.7¬†cells. Results showed that downregulation of miR-17-5p significantly reduced the production of inflammatory cytokines, inhibited the lipid accumulation and up-regulated ABCA1, and activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) Œ≥/Liver X receptor (LXR) Œ± signaling pathway. Additionally, ABCA1 was found to be a target of miR-17-5p by directly binding to 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of its mRNA. Our study indicates a novel regulatory mechanism for miR-17-5p by interacting with ABCA1, which could be a therapy-target for the treatment of AS.
Hypercholesterolemia is closely associated with cardiovascular disease. Supplementation with probiotics has been shown to contribute to improving lipid metabolism. The probiotic mechanisms of cholesterol reduction are complicated and remain unclear. One of the potential probiotic mechanisms for cholesterol reduction is the deconjugation of bile salts. We previously found a high bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity of Lactobacillus casei pWQH01 (overexpression of bsh1) and Lactobacillus plantarum AR113, but found no BSH activity for Lactobacillus casei LC2W in vitro. Therefore, we decided to investigate whether the high BSH activity of L. plantarum AR113 and L. casei pWQH01 could exert a cholesterol-reducing effect in vivo. Compared to the high-cholesterol diet (HCD) group, AR113 and pWQH01 groups had a significantly lower body weight (BW), serum total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and atherogenic index (AI), whereas the LC2W group had a poor capability to mitigate the blood lipid levels in the hypercholesterolemic mice. In addition, the AR113 and pWQH01 groups decreased the hepatic levels of TC and LDL-C and improved hepatic steatosis compared with the HCD group. To explore their cholesterol-lowering mechanisms of action, we determined the expression levels of these genes on the cholesterol metabolic pathways. AR113 and pWQH01 groups downregulated the expression of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and small heterodimer partner (SHP) genes, but upregulated the expression of the cholesterol 7Œ±-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) gene in the liver. Simultaneously, the expression of cholesterol liver X receptor (LXR) and low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) genes was upregulated in the liver. These results indicated that L. plantarum AR113 and L. casei pWQH01 could inhibit the cholesterol absorption and accelerate the cholesterol transportation. Taken together, these findings suggest that Lactobacillus strain overexpression of bile salt hydrolase has beneficial effects against hypercholesterolemia by reducing cholesterol absorption and increasing cholesterol catabolism.
PDZK1 (NHERF3) interacts with membrane proteins whereby modulating their spatial arrangement, membrane stability, and function. One of the membrane proteins shown to be stabilized by interaction with PDZK1 is the HDL-receptor SR-BI (SCARB1). Testing the influence of TO 901317, a known activator of liver X receptor alpha (LXRŒ±, NR1H3) which is a central regulator of the lipid homeostasis, Grefhorst et al. reported in 2012 that administration of TO 901317 did not affect PDZK1 expression and reduced the amount of SR-BI protein in mouse liver. Considering that TO 901317 also activates the xenosensor pregnane X receptor (PXR, NR1I2), it was aim of this study to further investigate the influence of LXRŒ± and PXR activation on transcription of PDZK1. First, we tested the transactivation of PDZK1 by LXRŒ± or PXR in cell-based reporter gene assays comparing the effect of prototypical ligands to that of TO 901317. Ligand mediated activation of LXRŒ± increased, while that of PXR lowered luciferase activity. Further, we located the most likely binding site for LXRŒ± and PXR on the PDZK1 promoter between -85‚ÄØbp and -54‚ÄØbp. The transcriptional regulation by LXRŒ± was further supported showing enhanced mRNA expression of PDZK1 in HepG2 cells treated with the selective LXRŒ±-agonist GW3965, while treatment with TO 901317 reduced the protein amount of PDZK1. Taken together, we provide evidence that both LXRŒ± and PXR are transcriptional regulators of PDZK1 supporting the previous notion that the scaffold protein is part of cholesterol homeostasis and drug metabolism.
Efferocytosis is the process of recognizing and removing dead and dying cells, performed by a variety of phagocytic cells including macrophages. It has recently been shown that liver X receptor (LXR) signaling in macrophages regulates the expression of important efferocytosis receptors, bridging and signaling molecules. Here we describe a sensitive yet robust efferocytosis assay, optimized to measure bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) apoptotic cell engulfment capability. This assay can be applied to genetically or pharmacologically altered BMDMs.
Macrophages are phagocytic cells that actively engulf and kill microorganisms within a specialized phagolysosomal system. Several pathogenic bacteria, however, actively co-opt host mechanisms and escape from microbial digestion to establish intracellular replication within macrophages. This chapter highlights detailed protocols to measure the effects of the LXR pathway on bacterial infection of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages.
Measuring cholesterol efflux involves the tracking of cholesterol movement out of cells. Cholesterol efflux is an essential mechanism to maintain cellular cholesterol homeostasis, and this process is largely regulated via the LXR transcription factors and their regulated genes, the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) cholesterol transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1. Typically, efflux assays are performed utilizing radiolabeled cholesterol tracers to label intracellular cholesterol pools, and these assays may be tailored to quantify the efflux of exogenously delivered cholesterol or alternatively the efflux of newly synthesized (endogenous) cholesterol, in different cell types (macrophages, hepatocytes). Cholesterol efflux may also be customized to quantify cholesterol flux out of the cell to various exogenous cholesterol acceptors, such as apolipoprotein A-I, high-density lipoprotein, or methyl-beta-cyclodextrin, depending on the purpose of the experiment. Here, we provide comprehensive protocols to quantify the net flux of cholesterol out of cells and recommendations on how this assay may be tailored as a function of the experimental question at hand.
It has been shown that calcium supplementation favorably modifies plasma lipoprotein profile in postmenopausal women. The present study investigated the interaction of dietary calcium with genes of transporters, receptors and enzymes involved in cholesterol metabolism.
Forty-eight ovariectomized hamsters were fed one of the four diets containing 0, 2, 6 and 8 g calcium per kg. Plasma total cholesterol (TC), triacylglycerols (TG), and non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol were dose-dependently decreased, whereas high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was dose-dependently increased with the increasing dietary calcium levels. Dietary calcium had no effect on protein mass of hepatic sterol regulatory element binding protein-2 (SREBP), liver X receptor-alpha (LXR), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR), LDL receptor (LDLR) and cholesterol-7Œ±-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). However, dietary calcium up-regulated the mRNA levels of hepatic CYP7A1 and intestinal ATP binding cassette transporters (ABCG5/8) whereas it down-regulated the intestinal Niemann-Pick C1 like 1 (NPC1L1) and microsomal triacylglycerol transport protein (MTP). In addition, dietary calcium increased the activity of intestinal acyl coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase 2, while it decreased plasma cholesteryl ester transport protein (CETP).
Beneficial modification of lipoprotein profile by dietary calcium was mediated by sequestering bile acid absorption and enhancing excretion of fecal cholesterol, via up-regulation of mRNA CYP7A1 and intestinal ABCG 5/8 with down-regulation of mRNA NPC1L1 and MTP.
Niemann-Pick type C1 (Npc1) protein inactivation results in lipid accumulation in late endosomes and lysosomes, leading to a defect of ATP binding cassette protein A1 (Abca1)-mediated lipid efflux to apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) in macrophages and fibroblasts. However, the role of Npc1 in Abca1-mediated lipid efflux to apoA-I in hepatocytes, the major cells contributing to HDL formation, is still unknown. Here we show that, whereas lipid efflux to apoA-I in Npc1-null macrophages is impaired, the lipidation of endogenously synthesized apoA-I by low density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol or de novo synthesized cholesterol or phospholipids in Npc1-null hepatocytes is significantly increased by about 1-, 3-, and 8-fold, respectively. The increased cholesterol efflux reflects a major increase of Abca1 protein in Npc1-null hepatocytes, which contrasts with the decrease observed in Npc1-null macrophages. The increased Abca1 expression is largely post-transcriptional, because Abca1 mRNA is only slightly increased and Lxr alpha mRNA is not changed, and Lxr alpha target genes are reduced. This differs from the regulation of Abcg1 expression, which is up-regulated at both mRNA and protein levels in Npc1-null cells. Abca1 protein translation rate is higher in Npc1-null hepatocytes, compared with wild type hepatocytes as measured by [(35)S]methionine incorporation, whereas there is no difference for the degradation of newly synthesized Abca1 in these two types of hepatocytes. Cathepsin D, which we recently identified as a positive modulator of Abca1, is markedly increased at both mRNA and protein levels by Npc1 inactivation in hepatocytes but not in macrophages. Consistent with this, inhibition of cathepsin D with pepstatin A reduced the Abca1 protein level in both Npc1-inactivated and WT hepatocytes. Therefore, Abca1 expression is specifically regulated in hepatocytes, where Npc1 activity modulates cathepsin D expression and Abca1 protein translation rate.
Data suggest that intestinal carotenoid absorption is a facilitated process. The present study was conducted to determine whether carotenoids and cholesterol share common pathways (transporters) for their intestinal absorption. Differentiated Caco-2 cells on membranes were incubated (16 h) with a carotenoid (1 micromol/L) with or without ezetimibe (EZ; Zetia, an inhibitor of cholesterol transport), and with or without antibodies against the receptors, cluster determinant 36 (CD36) and scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI). Carotenoid transport in Caco-2 cells (cellular uptake + secretion) was decreased by EZ (10 mg/L) as follows: beta-carotene approximately alpha-carotene (50% inhibition) &gt; beta-cryptoxanthin approximately lycopene (20%) &gt; lutein:zeaxanthin (1:1) (7%). EZ reduced cholesterol transport by 31%, but not retinol transport. beta-Carotene transport was also inhibited by anti-SR-BI, but not by anti-CD36. The inhibitory effects of EZ and anti-SR-BI on beta-carotene transport were additive, indicating that they may have different targets. Finally, differentiated Caco-2 cells treated with EZ showed a significant decrease in mRNA expression for the surface receptors SR-BI, Niemann-Pick type C1 Like 1 protein (NPC1L1), and ATP-binding cassette transporter, subfamily A (ABCA1) and for the nuclear receptors retinoid acid receptor (RAR)gamma, sterol-regulatory element binding proteins (SREBP)-1 and -2, and liver X receptor (LXR)beta as assessed by real-time PCR analysis. The data indicate that 1) EZ is an inhibitor of carotenoid transport, an effect that decreases with increasing polarity of the carotenoid molecule, 2) SR-BI is involved in carotenoid transport, and 3) EZ may act, not only by interacting physically with cholesterol transporters as previously suggested, but also by downregulating expression of these proteins. The cellular uptake and efflux of carotenoids, like that of cholesterol, likely involve more than one transporter.
Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) is a key participant in cellular cholesterol trafficking. Loss of NPC1 function leads to defective suppression of SREBP-dependent gene expression and failure to appropriately activate liver X receptor-mediated (LXR-mediated) pathways, ultimately resulting in intracellular cholesterol accumulation. To determine whether NPC1 contributes to regulation of macrophage sterol homeostasis in vivo, we examined the effect of NPC1 deletion in BM-derived cells on atherosclerotic lesion development in the Ldlr-/- mouse model of atherosclerosis. High-fat diet-fed chimeric Npc1-/- mice reconstituted with Ldlr-/-Npc1-/- macrophages exhibited accelerated atherosclerosis despite lower serum cholesterol compared with mice reconstituted with wild-type macrophages. The discordance between the low serum lipoprotein levels and the presence of aortic atherosclerosis suggested that intrinsic alterations in macrophage sterol metabolism in the chimeric Npc1-/- mice played a greater role in atherosclerotic lesion formation than did serum lipoprotein levels. Macrophages from chimeric Npc1-/- mice showed decreased synthesis of 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-HC), an endogenous LXR ligand; decreased expression of LXR-regulated cholesterol transporters; and impaired cholesterol efflux. Lower 27-HC levels were associated with elevated cholesterol oxidation products in macrophages and plasma of chimeric Npc1-/- mice and with increased oxidative stress. Our results demonstrate that NPC1 serves an atheroprotective role in mice through regulation of LXR-dependent cholesterol efflux and mitigation of cholesterol-induced oxidative stress in macrophages.
Cholesterol is essential for the growth and function of all mammalian cells, but abnormally increased blood cholesterol is a major risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters G5 (ABCG5) and G8 (ABCG8) form an obligate heterodimer that limits intestinal absorption and facilitates biliary secretion of cholesterol and phytosterols. Consistent with their function, ABCG5 and ABCG8 are located on the apical membrane of enterocytes and hepatocytes. Liver X receptor is the major positive regulator of ABCG5 and ABCG8 expression. Mutations in either of the two genes cause sitosterolemia, a condition in which cholesterol and plant sterols accumulate in the circulation leading to premature cardiovascular disease. Overexpression of ABCG5 and ABCG8 in mice retards diet-induced atherosclerosis because of reduced circulating and hepatic cholesterol. In the current review, we summarize recent developments and propose a future framework that provides new perspectives on the regulation of cholesterol metabolism and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. 
The transcription factor cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein H (CREBH, encoded by Creb3l3) is highly expressed in the liver and small intestine. Hepatic CREBH contributes to glucose and triglyceride metabolism by regulating fibroblast growth factor 21 (Fgf21) expression. However, the intestinal CREBH function remains unknown.
To investigate the influence of intestinal CREBH on cholesterol metabolism, we compared plasma, bile, fecal, and tissue cholesterol levels between wild-type (WT) mice and mice overexpressing active human CREBH mainly in the small intestine (CREBH Tg mice) under different dietary conditions.
Plasma cholesterol, hepatic lipid, and cholesterol crystal formation in the gallbladder were lower in CREBH Tg mice fed a lithogenic diet (LD) than in LD-fed WTs, while fecal cholesterol output was higher in the former. These results suggest that intestinal CREBH overexpression suppresses cholesterol absorption, leading to reduced plasma cholesterol, limited hepatic supply, and greater excretion. The expression of Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (Npc1l1), a rate-limiting transporter mediating intestinal cholesterol absorption, was reduced in the small intestine of CREBH Tg mice. Adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter A1 (Abca1), Abcg5/8, and scavenger receptor class B, member 1 (Srb1) expression levels were also reduced in CREBH Tg mice. Promoter assays revealed that CREBH directly regulates Npc1l1 expression. Conversely, CREBH null mice exhibited higher intestinal Npc1l1 expression, elevated plasma and hepatic cholesterol, and lower fecal output.
Intestinal CREBH regulates dietary cholesterol flow from the small intestine by controlling the expression of multiple intestinal transporters. We propose that intestinal CREBH could be a therapeutic target for hypercholesterolemia.
Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), ATP-binding cassette (ABC)G5, and ABCG8 are all involved in intestinal cholesterol absorption. It is unclear whether a high-cholesterol (HC) diet affects the expression of these transporters in rats and mice as well as humans. We examined the effects of an HC diet on their expression in small intestine and the differences between rats and mice in the responsive of this expression to an HC diet. In addition to these transporters, alterations in six representative drug and nutrient transporters (multidrug resistance-associated protein, breast cancer resistance protein, peptide transporter, sodium-glucose linked transporter, glucose transporter, and L-type amino acid transporter) and transcriptional factors such as hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)4Œ±, sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)2, and liver X receptor (LXR)Œ± were determined. In rats and mice fed an HC diet for 7¬†days, the mRNA and protein levels of NPC1L1 in the small intestine were determined by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively. The mRNA levels of ABCG5 and ABCG8, six representative transporters, and transcriptional factors such as HNF4Œ±, SREBP2, and LXR were examined. Significant decreases in the expression levels of NPC1L1 were observed in mice, but not rats, fed the HC diet. The mRNA levels of ABCG5 and ABCG8 were significantly increased in HC rats but not in mice. Only minor changes in the mRNA levels of the other transporters were seen in HC rats and mice. Decreased mRNA levels of HNF4Œ± and SREBP2 in mice could be involved in the reduction in NPC1L1 expression observed upon the introduction of an HC diet. These results indicate that the effects of an HC diet on the expression levels of NPC1L1, ABCG5, and ABCG8 differ between mice and rats. 
Niemann-Pick type C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) is an intestinal cholesterol transporter that is known to be the target of the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe. We previously discovered steroidal NPC1L1 ligands by using a novel cell-based assay that employs pharmacological chaperone effect as a readout. Those steroid derivatives bound to a site different from both the sterol-binding domain and the ezetimibe-binding site, implying that they may be a novel class of NPC1L1 inhibitors with a distinct mode of action. As an extension of that work, we aimed here to find non-steroidal NPC1L1 ligands, which may be better candidates for clinical application than steroidal ligands, by using the same assay to screen our focused library of ligands for liver X receptor (LXR), a nuclear receptor that recognizes oxysterols as endogenous ligands. Here we describe identification of a novel class of NPC1L1 ligands with a ring-fused quinolinone scaffold, and an analysis of the structure-activity relationships of their derivatives as NPC1L1 ligands. 
Exogenous cholesterol uptake involves a complex process in the intestines for the absorption of cholesterol and bile acids. This process is regulated by intestinal nuclear transcription factors such as LXR that affect sterol transporters NPC1L1, ABCG5/G8, and ABCG1, and enzymes such as ACAT-2. Plant sterol/stanols, ezetimibe, and bile acid sequestrants have a variety of effects on these various transporters, and new insights into their mechanism(s) of action have provided a plethora of exciting targets for metabolic diseases, dyslipidemia, and atherosclerosis.
Disodium ascorbyl phytostanol phosphate (FM-VP4) is a synthetic compound derived from sitostanol and campestanol that has proved to be efficient as a cholesterol-lowering therapy in mice and human subjects. However, the mechanism of action of FM-VP4 remains unknown. The present study tests the ability of FM-VP4 to alter intestinal and liver cholesterol homeostasis in mice. Female C57BL/6J mice were fed either a control chow or a 2 % FM-VP4-enriched diet for 4 weeks. FM-VP4 reduced the in vivo net intestinal cholesterol absorption and plasma and liver cholesterol concentrations by 2.2-, 1.5- and 1.6-fold, respectively, compared with control mice. Furthermore, FM-VP4 also showed an impact on bile acid homeostasis. In FM-VP4 mice, liver and intestinal bile acid content was increased by 1.3- and 2.3-fold, respectively, whereas faecal bile acid output was 3.3-fold lower. FM-VP4 also increased the intestinal absorption of orally administered [3H]taurocholic acid to small intestine in vivo. Inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption by FM-VP4 was not mediated via transcriptional increases in intestine liver X receptor (LXR)-alpha, adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter (ABC)-A1, ABCG5/G8 nor to decreases in intestinal Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) expression. In contrast, FM-VP4 up-regulated liver LXRalpha, ABCA1, ABCG5, scavenger receptor class BI (SR-BI) and hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCoA-R) gene expression, whereas it down-regulated several farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-target genes such as cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily A polypeptide 1 (CYP7A1) and Na+/taurocholate co-transporter polypeptide (NTCP). In conclusion, FM-VP4 reduced intestinal cholesterol absorption, plasma and liver cholesterol and affected bile acid homeostasis by inducing bile acid intestinal reabsorption and changed the liver expression of genes that play an essential role in cholesterol homeostasis. This is the first phytosterol or stanol that affects bile acid metabolism and lowers plasma cholesterol levels in normocholesterolaemic mice.
Disturbances in lipid homeostasis and myelination have been proposed in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. We have previously shown that several antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs increase lipid biosynthesis through activation of the Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein (SREBP) transcription factors, which control the expression of numerous genes involved in fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis. The aim of the present proof-of-principle study was to investigate whether such drugs also affect lipid transport and export pathways in cultured human CNS and liver cells.
Quantitative PCR and immunoblotting were used to determine the level of lipid transport genes in human glioblastoma (GaMg) exposed to clozapine, olanzapine, haloperidol or imipramine. The effect of some of these drugs was also investigated in human astrocytoma (CCF-STTG1), neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells. We found significant transcriptional changes of cholesterol transport genes (ApoE, ABCA1, NPC1, NPC2, NPC1L1), which are predominantly controlled by the Liver X receptor (LXR) transcription factor. The up-regulation was observed after 24 to 48 hours of drug exposure, which is markedly delayed as compared to the drug-induced SREBP-controlled stimulation of lipid biosynthesis seen after 6 hours.
Our data show that stimulation of cellular lipid biosynthesis by amphiphilic psychotropic drugs is followed by a transcriptional activation of cholesterol transport and efflux pathways. Such effects may be relevant for both therapeutic effects and metabolic adverse effects of psychotropic drugs.
Several transporter proteins regulate intestinal cholesterol absorption. Of these proteins, NPC1L1 is a major contributor to this process. Fatty acids (FAs) modulate cholesterol absorption by a mechanism that remains unknown. We evaluate the effect of saturated fatty acids (SFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on the expression of NPC1L1 and others proteins associated with cholesterol absorption (SR-BI, ABCG5, ABCG8, ABCA1, CAV-1, ANX-2) in human enterocytes in vitro. The role of SREBPs, PPARs, LXR and RXR in this process was also investigated. Caco-2/TC-7 enterocytes were incubated for 24 h with a wide range of concentrations of FA-bovine serum albumin (50-300 microM). Gene expression was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. The NPC1L1 protein present in enterocyte membranes was analyzed using Western blot. NPC1L1 mRNA levels were reduced 35-58% by the n-3 PUFAs, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (P&lt;.05). Linoleic acid (n-6), palmitic acid and oleic acid did not affect NPC1L1 mRNA expression. ABCA1 mRNA levels were reduced 44-70% by n-6 arachidonic acid and 43-55% by n-3 EPA (P&lt;.05). LXR and LXR+RXR agonists decreased NPC1L1 mRNA expression by 28% and 57%, respectively (P&lt;.05). A concentration of 200 microM of EPA and DHA decreased NPC1L1 protein expression in enterocyte membranes by 58% and 59%, respectively. We have demonstrated that the PUFAs n-3 EPA and DHA down-regulate NPC1L1 mRNA expression. In addition, PUFAs also down-regulate NPC1L1 protein expression in enterocyte membranes. LXR and RXR activation induced a similar repression effect. The lipid-lowering effect of n-3 PUFAs could be mediated in part by their action at the NPC1L1 gene level.
Growing evidence suggests that the small intestine may contribute to excessive postprandial lipemia, which is highly prevalent in insulin-resistant/Type 2 diabetic individuals and substantially increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. The aim of the present study was to determine the role of high glucose levels on intestinal cholesterol absorption, cholesterol transporter expression, enzymes controlling cholesterol homeostasis, and the status of transcription factors. To this end, we employed highly differentiated and polarized cells (20 days of culture), plated on permeable polycarbonate filters. In the presence of [(14)C]cholesterol, glucose at 25 mM stimulated cholesterol uptake compared with Caco-2/15 cells supplemented with 5 mM glucose (P &lt; 0.04). Because combination of 5 mM glucose with 20 mM of the structurally related mannitol or sorbitol did not change cholesterol uptake, we conclude that extracellular glucose concentration is uniquely involved in the regulation of intestinal cholesterol transport. The high concentration of glucose enhanced the protein expression of the critical cholesterol transporter NPC1L1 and that of CD36 (P &lt; 0.02) and concomitantly decreased SR-BI protein mass (P &lt; 0.02). No significant changes were observed in the protein expression of ABCA1 and ABCG8, which act as efflux pumps favoring cholesterol export out of absorptive cells. At the same time, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase activity was decreased (P &lt; 0.007), whereas ACAT activity remained unchanged. Finally, increases were noted in the transcription factors LXR-alpha, LXR-beta, PPAR-beta, and PPAR-gamma along with a drop in the protein expression of SREBP-2. Collectively, our data indicate that glucose at high concentrations may regulate intestinal cholesterol transport and metabolism in Caco-2/15 cells, thus suggesting a potential influence on the cholesterol absorption process in Type 2 diabetes.
Various studies have delineated the causal role of dietary cholesterol in atherogenesis. Strategies have thus been developed to minimize cholesterol absorption, and cholesterol transport proteins found at the apical membrane of enterocytes have been extensively investigated. This review focuses on recent progress related to various brush-border proteins that are potentially involved in alimentary cholesterol transport.
Molecular mechanisms responsible for dietary cholesterol and plant sterol uptake have not been completely defined. Growing evidence, however, supports the concept that several proteins are involved in mediating intestinal cholesterol transport, including SR-BI, NPC1L1, CD36, aminopeptidase N, P-glycoprotein, and the caveolin-1/annexin-2 heterocomplex. Other ABC family members (ABCA1 and ABCG5/ABCG8) act as efflux pumps favoring cholesterol export out of absorptive cells into the lumen or basolateral compartment. Several of these cholesterol carriers influence intracellular cholesterol homeostasis and are controlled by transcription factors, including RXR, LXR, SREBP-2 and PPARalpha. The lack of responsiveness of NPC1L1-deficient mice to ezetimibe suggests that NPC1L1 is likely to be the principal target of this cholesterol-lowering drug.
The understanding of the role, genetic regulation and coordinated function of proteins mediating intestinal cholesterol transport may lead to novel ways of treating cardiovascular disease.
Ezetimibe belongs to a group of selective and very effective 2-azetidione cholesterol absorption inhibitors which act on the level of cholesterol entry into enterocytes. Recent data indicated that the drug prevents the formation of a heterocomplex consisting of annexin-2 and caveolin-l and leads to specific inhibition of an NPCILI-dependent cholesterol uptake pathway required for uptake of micellar cholesterol into enterocytes. Earlier studies have shown that caveolin-l and annexin-2 are also expressed in human macro-phages and we show in this study that human macrophages express NPC1L1. Moreover in human macrophages, Ezetimibe(SCH58235) and its analogue, SCH354909, are bound to specific cell surface receptors followed by endocytosis via the classical endocytic pathway. SCH58235 had no effect on uptake and/or processing of acetylated LDL (Ac-LDL). In contrast, the compound inhibited uptake of oxidized LDL (Ox-LDL) by -50% in a dose-dependent manner. SCH58235 blocked the lipid-induced induction of LXR/RXR target genes ABCAI, ABCGI, and apolipoprotein E distinctively more effectively in macrophages loaded with Ox-LDL than in those loaded with Ac-LDL. Based on these findings, we presume that the caveolin-l-, annexin-2-, and NPClLI-dependent cholesterol uptake system that is operating in enterocytes may also contribute to class B scavenger receptor-dependent uptake of Ox-LDL in human monocyte-derived macrophages.
The purpose of the study was to test the hypothesis that gene expression of members of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily known to act as endo- and xeno-sensors is reduced in the ileum of exercise-trained (Tr) rats. Healthy female rats were either treadmill-trained for 8 weeks, 5 times/week, or remained sedentary (Sed). Training resulted in a significant (p &lt; 0.05) decrease in plasma free fatty acid (0.18 ¬± 0.01 to 0.15 ¬± 0.01 mmol/L) and glycerol (24.8 ¬± 0.8 to 18.7 ¬± 0.8 mg/L) concentrations. Gene expressions of NRs farnesoid X receptor (FXR; p &lt; 0.05), liver X receptor (LXR; p &lt; 0.05), pregnane X receptor (PXR; p &lt; 0.01), and retinoid X receptor (RXR; p &lt; 0.06) were reduced in the ileum of Tr compared with Sed animals. Tr was also associated with a reduction (p &lt; 0.05) in gene expression of FXR downstream heterodimeric organite solute transporters Œ± (OSTŒ±) and Œ≤ (OSTŒ≤) involved in the transport of bile acids, LXR downstream genes heterodimeric ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABCG5/G8) involved in transport of absorbed cholesterol back to the lumen, and Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) involved in cholesterol absorption. These data indicate that exercise training lowers the expression of molecules involved in the defense system of the ileum against endobiotic and xenobiotic insults under normal conditions, thus, suggesting that regular exercise contributes to the intestinal maintenance of cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis. 
As a cholesterol-induced metabolic disease, cholesterolosis of the gallbladder is often resected clinically, which could lead to many complications. The histopathology of cholesterolosis is due to excessive lipid droplet accumulation in epithelial and subcutaneous tissues. The main components of lipid droplets are cholesterol esters (CEs). Removal of CEs from gallbladder epithelial cells (GBECs) is very important for maintaining intracellular cholesterol homeostasis and for treating cholesterol-related diseases. In this study, pioglitazone was used to reduce intracellular CEs. To further elucidate the mechanism, cholesterolosis GBECs were treated with pioglitazone, 22-(R)-hydroxycholesterol (a liver X receptor Œ± (LXRŒ±) agonist), or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARŒ≥) siRNA. Western blotting for PPARŒ≥, LXRŒ±, ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), and neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase 1 (NCEH1) was performed. At length, cholesterol efflux to apoA-I was measured, and oil red O staining was used to visualize lipid droplet variations in cells. In conclusion, we observed that pioglitazone increased ABCA1 expression in an LXR-dependent manner and NCEH1 expression in an LXRŒ±-independent manner, which mobilized CE hydrolysis and cholesterol efflux to reduce lipid droplet content in cholesterolosis GBECs. Our data provide a plausible alternative to human gallbladder cholesterolosis. 
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are oxysterol-activated nuclear receptors regulating reverse cholesterol transport, in part by modulating cholesterol efflux from macrophages to apoAI and HDL via the ABCA1 and ABCG1/ABCG4 pathways. Moreover, LXR activation increases intracellular cholesterol trafficking via the induction of NPC1 and NPC2 expression. However, implication of LXRs in the selective uptake of cholesteryl esters from lipoproteins in human macrophages has never been reported.
Our results show that (1) selective CE uptake from HDL(3) is highly efficient in human monocyte-derived macrophages; (2) surprisingly, HDL(3)-CE uptake is strongly increased by LXR activation despite antiatherogenic effects of LXRs; (3) HDL(3)-CE uptake increase is not linked to SR-BI expression modulation but it is dependent of proteoglycan interactions; (4) HDL(3)-CE uptake increase is associated with increased expression and secretion of apoE and LPL, two proteins interacting with proteoglycans; (5) HDL(3)-CE uptake increase depends on the integrity of raft domains and is associated with an increased caveolin-1 expression.
Our study identifies a new role for LXRs in the control of cholesterol homeostasis in human macrophages. LXR activation results in enhanced dynamic intracellular cholesterol fluxes through an increased CE uptake from HDL and leads to an increased cholesterol availability to efflux to apoAI and HDL.
Synthetic activators of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR)-alpha and -gamma are capable of reducing macrophage foam cell cholesterol accumulation through the activation of genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Since conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) were also demonstrated to activate PPARalpha and PPARgamma in vivo and in vitro, we tested the hypothesis that CLA are also capable of reducing macrophage foam cell cholesterol accumulation. Thus, mouse RAW264.7 macrophage-derived foam cells were treated with CLA isomers, c9t11-CLA and t10c12-CLA, and linoleic acid (LA), as reference fatty acid, and analyzed for the concentrations of free and esterified cholesterol, cholesterol efflux and expression of genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis (CD36, ABCA1, LXRalpha, NPC-1, and NPC-2). Treatment with c9t11-CLA and t10c12-CLA, but not LA, lowered cholesterol accumulation, stimulated acceptor-dependent cholesterol efflux, and increased relative mRNA concentrations of CD36, ABCA1, LXRalpha, NPC-1, and NPC-2 (P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, the present study showed that CLA isomers reduce cholesterol accumulation in RAW264.7 macrophage-derived foam cells presumably by enhancing lipid acceptor-dependent cholesterol efflux.
Cellular cholesterol homeostasis is maintained through activation of the designated sterol regulatory element binding proteins and liver X receptor transcriptional pathways. Insight into the molecular mechanisms that regulate these pathways has come from the study of Niemann-Pick C (NPC) disease. Mutations in the NPC1 and NPC2 disease genes lead to lysosomal accumulation of cholesterol and defects in regulation of sterol homeostatic responses. NPC1 and NPC2 are key participants in intracellular cholesterol trafficking and are required for production of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-derived oxysterols. In this review, the function of NPC1 and NPC2 in sterol trafficking and regulation of cholesterol homeostasis is examined. Study of the NPC proteins will further understanding of the mechanisms involved in atherogenesis.
Although cholesterol is a major component of the CNS, there is little information on how or whether a change in sterol flux across the blood-brain barrier might alter neurodegeneration. In Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease, a mutation in NPC1 protein causes unesterified cholesterol to accumulate in the lysosomal compartment of every cell, including neurons and glia. Using the murine model of this disease, we used genetic and pharmacologic approaches in an attempt to alter cholesterol homeostasis across the CNS. Genetic deletion of the sterol transporters ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and low-density lipoprotein receptor in the NPC1 mouse did not affect sterol balance or longevity. However, deletion of the nuclear receptor, liver X receptor beta (LXRbeta), had an adverse effect on progression of the disease. We therefore tested the effects of increasing LXR activity by oral administration of a synthetic ligand for this transcription factor. Treatment with this LXR agonist increased cholesterol excretion out of brain from 17 to 49 microg per day, slowed neurodegeneration, and prolonged life. This agonist did not alter synthesis of cholesterol or expression of genes associated with the formation of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol or neurosteroids such as CYP46A1, 3alphaHSD, and CYP11A1. However, levels of the sterol transporters ABCA1 and ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 were increased. Concomitantly, markers of neuroinflammation, CD14, MAC1, CD11c, and inducible nitric oxide synthase, were reduced, and microglia reverted from their amoeboid, active form to a ramified, resting configuration. Thus, LXR activation resulted in increased cholesterol excretion from the brain, decreased neuroinflammation, and deactivation of microglia to slow neurodegeneration and extend the lifespan of the NPC1 mouse.
Emerging experimental and human evidence has linked altered hepatic cholesterol homeostasis and free cholesterol (FC) accumulation to the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic steatohepatits (NASH). This review focuses on cellular mechanisms of cholesterol toxicity involved in liver injury and on alterations in cholesterol homeostasis promoting hepatic cholesterol overload in NASH. FC accumulation injures hepatocytes directly, by disrupting mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane integrity, triggering mitochondrial oxidative injury and ER stress, and by promoting generation of toxic oxysterols, and indirectly, by inducing adipose tissue dysfunction. Accumulation of oxidized LDL particles may also activate Kupffer and hepatic stellate cells, promoting liver inflammation and fibrogenesis. Hepatic cholesterol accumulation is driven by a deeply deranged cellular cholesterol homeostasis, characterized by elevated cholesterol synthesis and uptake from circulating lipoproteins and by a reduced cholesterol excretion. Extensive dysregulation of cellular cholesterol homeostasis by nuclear transcription factors sterol regulatory binding protein (SREBP)-2, liver X-receptor (LXR)-Œ± and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) plays a key role in hepatic cholesterol accumulation in NASH. The therapeutic implications and opportunities for normalizing cellular cholesterol homeostasis in these patients are also discussed.
Neurodegenerative processes are often accompanied by disruption of cholinergic systems; therefore, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors (AChEIs) may have therapeutic potential in some neurological conditions. We evaluated the effects of administration of donepezil, a widely used AChEI, in the cerebellum in a murine model of Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC). The NPC mice developed Purkinje cell loss at the age of 8 weeks; 4-week-old NPC mice given donepezil led to improvement of Purkinje cell survival that was associated with improvement of motor dysfunction in the mice. Because abnormal accumulation of cholesterol caused by impaired lipid homeostasis is the principal pathogenetic mechanism underlying NPC, we investigated the effects of donepezil on cholesterol metabolism in the NPC mice. Donepezil treatment reduced cholesterol accumulation in adult neural stem cells in vitro, and it downregulated the expression of the cholesterol synthesis factors' sterol regulatory element-binding proteins and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase in the cerebellum, implying that AChE activity might be associated with cholesterol homeostasis. Taken together, our findings suggest the role of a cholinergic pathway as a novel regulator of NPC progression and the potential application of AChEIs for the treatment of human NPC. 
Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease and represents the major cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. There is evidence that dihydrocapsaicin (DHC) can exert multiple pharmacological and physiological effects. Here, we explored the effect of DHC in atherosclerotic plaque progression in apoE(-/-) mice fed a high-fat/high-cholesterol diet.
apoE(-/-) mice were randomly divided into two groups and fed a high-fat/high-cholesterol diet with or without DHC for 12 weeks. We demonstrated that cellular cholesterol content was significantly decreased while apoA1-mediated cholesterol efflux was significantly increased following treatment with DHC in THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells. We also observed that plasma levels of TG, LDL-C, VLDL-C, IL-1Œ≤, IL-6, TNF-Œ± and CRP were markedly decreased while plasma levels of apoA1 and HDL-C were significantly increased, and consistent with this, atherosclerotic lesion development was significantly inhibited by DHC treatment of apoE(-/-) mice fed a high-fat/high-cholesterol diet. Moreover, treatment with both LXRŒ± siRNA and PPARŒ≥ siRNA made the up-regulation of DHC on ABCA1, ABCG1, ABCG5, SR-B1, NPC1, CD36, LDLR, HMGCR, apoA1 and apoE expression notably abolished while made the down-regulation of DHC on SRA1 expression markedly compensated. And treatment with PPARŒ≥ siRNA made the DHC-induced up-regulation of LXRŒ± expression notably abolished while treatment with LXRŒ± siRNA had no effect on DHC-induced PPARŒ≥ expression.
These observations provide direct evidence that DHC can significantly decrease atherosclerotic plaque formation involving in a PPARŒ≥/LXRŒ± pathway and thus DHC may represent a promising candidate for a therapeutic agent for the treatment or prevention of atherosclerosis.
Oxyresveratrol (OXY) is a naturally occurring polyhydroxylated stilbene that is abundant in mulberry wood (Morus alba L.), which has frequently been supplied as a herbal medicine. It has been shown that OXY has regulatory effects on inflammation and oxidative stress, and may have potential in preventing or curing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This study examined the effects of OXY on in vitro model of NAFLD in hepatocyte by the liver X receptor Œ± (LXRŒ±)-mediated induction of lipogenic genes and in vivo model in mice along with its molecular mechanism. OXY inhibited the LXRŒ± agonists-mediated sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) induction and expression of the lipogenic genes and upregulated the mRNA of fatty acid Œ≤-oxidation-related genes in hepatocytes, which is more potent than genistein and daidzein. OXY also induced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation in a time-dependent manner. Moreover, AMPK activation by the OXY treatment helped inhibit SREBP-1c using compound C as an AMPK antagonist. Oral administration of OXY decreased the Oil Red O stained-positive areas significantly, indicating lipid droplets and hepatic steatosis regions, as well as the serum parameters, such as fasting glucose, total cholesterol, and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol in high fat diet fed-mice, as similar with orally treatment of atorvastatin. Overall, this result suggests that OXY has the potency to inhibit hepatic lipogenesis through the AMPK/SREBP-1c pathway and can be used in the development of pharmaceuticals to prevent a fatty liver.
The commonly prescribed Tangshen Formula (TSF) is a traditional Chinese formulation that has been shown to reduce plasma lipid metabolism and proteinuria and improve the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients with diabetic kidney disease. This study investigated the underlying mechanism whereby TSF regulates renal lipid accumulation and ameliorates diabetic renal injuries in spontaneous diabetic db/db mice and in vitro in sodium palmitate (PA)-stimulated and Abca1-SiRNA-transfected mouse tubular epithelial cells (mTECs). The results revealed that TSF treatment significantly ameliorated the renal injuries by lowering urinary albumin excretion and improving renal tissue injuries in diabetic (db/db) mice. Interestingly, the treatment with TSF also resulted in decreased cholesterol levels in the renal tissues of db/db mice, which was associated with increased expression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Œ≥ coactivator 1-Œ± (PGC-1Œ±), the Liver X receptors (LXR), and ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1), suggesting that TSF might attenuate diabetic kidney injury via a mechanism associated with improving cholesterol efflux in the diabetic kidney. This was investigated in vitro in mTECs, and the results showed that TSF reduced the PA-stimulated cholesterol accumulation in mTECs. Mechanistically, the addition of TSF was capable of reversing PA-induced downregulation of PGC-1Œ±, LXR, and ABCA1 expression and cholesterol accumulation in mTECs, suggesting that TSF might act the protection via the PGC-1Œ±-LXR-ABCA1 pathway to improve the cholesterol efflux in the renal tissues of db/db mice. This was further confirmed by silencing ABCA1 to block the promotive effect of TSF on cholesterol efflux in vitro. In conclusion, TSF might ameliorate diabetic kidney injuries by promoting ABCA1-mediated renal cholesterol efflux.
Abnormal metabolism of cholesterol may be a contributing factor in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) pathogenesis. Accumulating evidence has shown that liver X receptor (LXR) is closely related to intrahepatic inflammation and fibrosis. In this study, we evaluated the effects of a novel liver-specific LXR inverse agonist, SR9243, on antifibrosis in NASH mice. A high-cholesterol diet was employed to induce NASH in BALB/c mice by either carbon tetrachloride (CCL4) administration or bile-duct ligation (BDL). Once NASH was induced, mice were treated with SR9243 for one month by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. Liver tissues were collected to determine the degree of fibrosis and intrahepatic inflammation via pathological examination and QPCR; serum was collected to analyze the plasma lipid levels and liver function by clinical biochemistry. The mice developed hepatic steatosis, severe hepatic inflammation, and fibrosis by BDL or CCL4. Treatment with SR9243 significantly reduced the severity of hepatic inflammation and ameliorated hepatic fibrosis; simultaneously, body weight, serum glucose, and plasma lipid levels were controlled effectively. Our data demonstrate that SR9243 exerts an antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory effect in NASH mice; hence these findings highly suggest that LXR inverse agonist could be therapeutically important in NASH treatment.
We hypothesized that consumption of saturated fatty acids in the form of high-fat ground beef for 5 weeks would depress liver X receptor signaling targets in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and that changes in gene expression would be associated with the corresponding changes in lipoprotein cholesterol (C) concentrations. Older men (n = 5, age 68.0 ¬± 4.6 years) and postmenopausal women (n = 7, age 60.9 ¬± 3.1 years) were assigned randomly to consume ground-beef containing 18% total fat (18F) or 25% total fat (25F), five patties per week for 5 weeks with an intervening 4-week washout period. The 25F and 18F ground-beef increased (p &lt; 0.05) the intake of saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, palmitic acid, and stearic acid, but the 25F ground-beef increased only the intake of oleic acid (p &lt; 0.05). The ground-beefs 18F and 25F increased the plasma concentration of palmitic acid (p &lt; 0.05) and decreased the plasma concentrations of arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenic acids (p &lt; 0.05). The interventions of 18F and 25F ground-beef decreased very low-density lipoprotein C concentrations and increased particle diameters and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-I-C and LDL-II-C concentrations (p &lt; 0.05). The ground-beef 25F decreased PBMC mRNA levels for the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding cassette A, ATP binding cassette G1, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1, and LDL receptor (LDLR) (p &lt; 0.05). The ground-beef 18F increased mRNA levels for stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (p &lt; 0.05). We conclude that the increased LDL particle size and LDL-I-C and LDL-II-C concentrations following the 25F ground-beef intervention may have been caused by decreased hepatic LDLR gene expression.
Liver X receptors (LXRs), including LXRŒ± and LXRŒ≤ isoforms, have been implicated in multiple physiological functions including promoting neurogenesis, improving synaptic plasticity, preventing neurodegeneration, inhibiting inflammation as well as regulating cholesterol metabolism. However, a potential role of LXRs in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) has never been investigated previously. Our present results demonstrated that levels of hippocampal LXRŒ≤ but not LXRŒ± were down-regulated in rats exposed to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) and were negatively correlated with the severity of CUS-induced depressive-like behaviors. Furthermore, rats with LXRŒ≤ knockdown by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in hippocampus displayed depressive-like behaviors and impaired hippocampal neurogenesis similar to those observed after CUS exposure. Conversely, LXRs activation by GW3965 (GW), a synthetic dual agonist for both LXRŒ± and LXRŒ≤ isoforms, could improve depression-like behaviors and reverse the impaired hippocampal neurogenesis in rats exposed to CUS. LXRŒ≤ knockdown by shRNA completely abrogated the antidepressant and hippocampal neurogenesis-promoting effects of GW, suggesting that LXRŒ≤ isoform mediated the antidepressant and hippocampal neurogenesis-promoting effects of the LXRŒ±/Œ≤ dual agonist. However, ablation of hippocampal neurogenesis with x-irradiation only partly but not completely abolished the antidepressant effects of GW in the behavioral tests, implying that the antidepressant effects mediated by LXRŒ≤ isoform are likely through both neurogenesis-dependent and -independent pathways. Thus, our findings suggest that LXRŒ≤ activation may represent a potential novel target for the treatment of MDD and also provide a novel insight into the underlying mechanisms of MDD.
Activation of liver X receptors (LXRs) with synthetic agonists promotes reverse cholesterol transport and protects against atherosclerosis in mouse models. Most synthetic LXR agonists also cause marked hypertriglyceridemia by inducing the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)1c and downstream genes that drive fatty acid biosynthesis. Recent studies demonstrated that desmosterol, an intermediate in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway that suppresses SREBP processing by binding to SCAP, also binds and activates LXRs and is the most abundant LXR ligand in macrophage foam cells. Here we explore the potential of increasing endogenous desmosterol production or mimicking its activity as a means of inducing LXR activity while simultaneously suppressing SREBP1c-induced hypertriglyceridemia. Unexpectedly, while desmosterol strongly activated LXR target genes and suppressed SREBP pathways in mouse and human macrophages, it had almost no activity in mouse or human hepatocytes in vitro. We further demonstrate that sterol-based selective modulators of LXRs have biochemical and transcriptional properties predicted of desmosterol mimetics and selectively regulate LXR function in macrophages in vitro and in vivo. These studies thereby reveal cell-specific discrimination of endogenous and synthetic regulators of LXRs and SREBPs, providing a molecular basis for dissociation of LXR functions in macrophages from those in the liver that lead to hypertriglyceridemia.
Accumulation of the Œ±-synuclein (Œ±-syn) protein is a hallmark of a group of brain disorders collectively known as synucleinopathies. The mechanisms responsible for Œ±-syn accumulation are not well understood. Several studies suggest a link between synucleinopathies and the cholesterol metabolite 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC). 27-OHC is the major cholesterol metabolite in the blood that crosses the blood brain barrier, and its levels can increase following hypercholesterolemia, aging, and oxidative stress, which are all factors for increased synucleinopathy risk. In this study, we determined the extent to which 27-OHC regulates Œ±-syn levels in human dopaminergic neurons, the cell type in which Œ±-syn accumulates in PD, a major synucleinopathy disorder.
Our results show that 27-OHC significantly increases the protein levels, not the mRNA expression of Œ±-syn. The effects of 27-OHC appear to be independent of an action through liver X receptors (LXR), its cognate receptors, as the LXR agonist, GW3965, or the LXR antagonist ECHS did not affect Œ±-syn protein or mRNA levels. Furthermore, our data strongly suggest that the 27-OHC-induced increase in Œ±-syn protein levels emanates from inhibition of the proteasomal degradation of this protein and a decrease in the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70).
Identifying 27-OHC as a factor that can increase Œ±-syn levels and the inhibition of the proteasomal function and reduction in HSP70 levels as potential cellular mechanisms involved in regulation of Œ±-syn. This may help in targeting the correct degradation of Œ±-syn as a potential avenue to preclude Œ±-syn accumulation.
The Liver X Receptor Œ± (LXRŒ±) belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily and plays an essential role in regulating cholesterol, lipid and glucose metabolism and inflammatory responses. We have previously shown that LXRŒ± is post-translationally modified by O-linked Œ≤-N-acetyl-glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) with increased transcriptional activity. Moreover, we showed that LXRŒ± associates with O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) in¬†vitro and in¬†vivo in mouse liver. In this study, we report that human LXRŒ± is O-GlcNAc modified in its N-terminal domain (NTD) by identifying a specific O-GlcNAc site S49 and a novel O-GlcNAc modified peptide 20LWKPGAQDASSQAQGGSSCILRE42. However, O-GlcNAc site-mutations did not modulate LXRŒ± transactivation of selected target gene promoters in¬†vitro. Peptide array and co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that LXRŒ± interacts with OGT in its NTD and ligand-binding domain (LBD) in a ligand-independent fashion. Moreover, we map two new O-GlcNAc sites in the longest OGT isoform (ncOGT): S437 in the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) 13 domain and T1043 in the far C-terminus, and a new O-GlcNAc modified peptide (amino acids 826-832) in the intervening region (Int-D) within the catalytic domain. We also map four new O-GlcNAc sites in the short isoform sOGT: S391, T393, S399 and S437 in the TPRs 11-13 domain. Future studies will reveal the biological role of identified O-GlcNAc sites in LXRŒ± and OGT.
Amyloid beta (AŒ≤) formation is one of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which induces the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), further leading to the alteration of several signalling pathways. In the present study, vitexin has been evaluated for its neuroprotective activity against AŒ≤25-35 induced toxicity in Neuro-2a cells. Results of cell free studies indicated that vitexin significantly inhibited the aggregation of AŒ≤25-35. Studies in Neuro-2a cells revealed that AŒ≤25-35 significantly affected the cell viability by inducing ROS mediated toxicity and apoptosis. However, pre-treatment of Neuro-2a cells with vitexin (50‚ÄØŒºM) significantly restored the cell viability up to 92.86‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ5.57%. Vitexin has been found to inhibit the production of free radicals and suppress ROS mediated lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and loss of membrane potential. Also, vitexin modulated the expression of genes involved in antioxidant response mechanisms (Nrf-2, HO-1), cholesterol metabolism (LXR-Œ±, APOE, ABCA-1, Seladin-1), and endoplasmic reticulum stress (Grp78, Gadd153) to offer neuroprotection. AŒ≤25-35 induced caspase-3 activation, and Bax protein expression was also found to be significantly inhibited by vitexin. Taken together, our results indicate that vitexin offers neuroprotection to cells in part via augmenting the antioxidant mechanisms, maintaining lipid homeostasis and inhibiting apoptosis induced by AŒ≤.
Cholesterol is an important lipid for maintaining cell membrane fluidity and generation of various hormones and bile acids. Thus, it is critical to maintain cholesterol homeostasis including absorption, trafficking, biosynthesis, and efflux; dysregulation of cholesterol homeostasis may lead to human disorders such as atherosclerosis. As a cholesterol sensor, nuclear receptor liver X receptor (LXR) is an important factor regulating cholesterol homeostasis. Extensive research has been carried out to examine the roles of LXR in atherosclerosis. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the mechanisms how LXR regulates cholesterol synthesis, efflux, absorption, and conversion of cholesterol esters to cholesterol in the context of atherosclerosis. In addition, we also discuss the possibility of targeting LXR and cholesterol homeostasis as a potential interventional strategy for treating atherosclerosis.
As the most abundant flavonoid in Ampelopsis grossedentata, the protective effects of dihydromyricetin on atherosclerosis have been well established, yet the detailed mechanisms are not fully understood. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of dihydromyricetin on lipid accumulation and the underlying molecular mechanisms in macrophages and ApoE-/- mice. Incubation with dihydromyricetin significantly attenuated oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-mediated cholesterol and lipid accumulation in THP-1-derived macrophages, which was due to increased cholesterol efflux. In addition, dihydromyricetin increased mRNA and protein expressions of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and ABCG1 but had no effect on the mRNA and protein expressions of SR-A, CD36, or SR-BI involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Furthermore, the upregulation of ABCA1 and ABCG1 by dihydromyricetin depended on liver X receptor Œ± (LXRŒ±), as evidenced by an increase in the nuclear level of LXRŒ± and its prevention of the expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 after inhibition of LXRŒ± activity by knockdown of LXRŒ± expression with small interfering RNA (siRNA). Accordingly, dihydromyricetin-mediated suppression of cholesterol and lipid accumulation in macrophages was also abrogated by LXRŒ± siRNA. Moreover, the lesion size of atherosclerosis was smaller in dihydromyricetin-treated ApoE-/- mice compared with the vehicle-treated mice, and the protein expression of CD36, SR-A, ABCA1, ABCG1 and LXRŒ± in aortas was modulated similar to that observed in THP-1-derived macrophages. These data suggest that promotion of LXRŒ±-ABCA1/ABCG1-dependent cholesterol efflux is crucial event in suppression of lipid accumulation by dihydromyricetin in the transformation of macrophage foam cells.
Liver X Receptors (LXRs) belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily, have been reported that activation of LXRs with synthetic ligands has anti-inflammatory effects in various inflammatory diseases. This study aims at investigating the effects of T0901317 (T0), a synthetic LXRs ligand, on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated primary bovine mammary epithelial cells (bMECs). BMECs were stimulated by LPS in the presence or absence of T0. The results showed that treatment with T0 significantly inhibited LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor-Œ± (TNF-Œ±), interleukin-1Œ≤ (IL-1Œ≤), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression. LPS-induced NF-Œ∫B activation was also suppressed by T0. Furthermore, T0 was found to inhibit the translocation of TLR4 to lipid rafts. T0 could activate ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) dependent pathway which induced cholesterol efflux from cells and disrupted the formation of lipid rafts. Thus, based on those findings we proposed that LXRs agonist might become a novel therapeutic target for inflammation.
The generation of CD138+ phagocytic macrophages with an alternative (M2) phenotype that clear apoptotic cells from tissues is defective in lupus. Liver X receptor-alpha (LXRŒ±) is an oxysterol-regulated transcription factor that promotes reverse cholesterol transport and alternative (M2) macrophage activation. Conversely, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-Œ± (HIF1Œ±) promotes classical (M1) macrophage activation. The objective of this study was to see if lupus can be treated by enhancing the generation of M2-like macrophages using LXR agonists. Peritoneal macrophages from pristane-treated mice had an M1 phenotype, high HIFŒ±-regulated phosphofructokinase and TNFŒ± expression (quantitative PCR, flow cytometry), and low expression of the LXRŒ±-regulated gene ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (Abca1) and Il10 vs. mice treated with mineral oil, a control inflammatory oil that does not cause lupus. Glycolytic metabolism (extracellular flux assays) and Hif1a expression were higher in pristane-treated mice (M1-like) whereas oxidative metabolism and LXRŒ± expression were higher in mineral oil-treated mice (M2-like). Similarly, lupus patients' monocytes exhibited low LXRŒ±/ABCA1 and high HIF1Œ± vs.
The LXR agonist T0901317 inhibited type I interferon and increased ABCA1 in lupus patients' monocytes and in murine peritoneal macrophages. In vivo, T0901317 induced M2-like macrophage polarization and protected mice from diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), an often fatal complication of lupus. We conclude that end-organ damage (DAH) in murine lupus can be prevented using an LXR agonist to correct a macrophage differentiation abnormality characteristic of lupus. LXR agonists also decrease inflammatory cytokine production by human lupus monocytes, suggesting that these agents may be have a role in the pharmacotherapy of lupus.
Liver X receptor (LXR), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, mainly serves as a reverse cholesterol transporter in lipid metabolism. It has been demonstrated that LXR is a promising target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. LXR is also involved in cancer metabolism, glucose homeostasis, immunity, and various physiological processes. The antitumor function of LXR has become of great interest to researchers in recent years. However, while it is believed that activating LXR with small molecules could be a promising approach to cancer treatment, effective drugs that target LXR are yet to be reported. To find compounds that are potentially capable of activating LXR, we utilized a high-throughput screening method to search the MolMall database for suitable compounds. Seven candidates with lower GB/SA Hawkins scores than the reference ligand T0901317 were identified. Based on the results of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, binding free energy analysis, and an analysis of the agonism mechanism, ZINC90512020 and ZINC3845032 were predicted to have high affinities for LXR and high relative stabilization, and were therefore selected as potential LXR agonists. Both of these compounds will undergo further development with a view to utilizing them for the treatment of LXR-related cardiovascular diseases or cancers.
Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH), a leading cause of various cerebrovascular diseases, leads to cognitive dysfunction due to neuron loss and impaired neurogenesis. Liver X receptors (LXRs), including LXRŒ± and LXRŒ≤ isoforms, are crucial for cholesterol metabolism, synaptic plasticity as well as neurogenesis. However, it is not clear the potential roles of LXRs in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment induced by CCH. In this study, we demonstrated that LXRŒ≤ expression decreased in hippocampus of CCH mice. GW3965, a synthetic dual agonist for both LXRŒ± and LXRŒ≤, ameliorated impairment of learning and memory in CCH mice by promoting neuronal survival and neural stem cells (NSCs) proliferation in dentate gyrus (DG) of CCH mice. The proliferative effects of GW3965 were further confirmed in cultured neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and showed in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, GW3965 phosphorylated protein kinase B (Akt) at Ser473 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in NPCs. Furthermore, both LY294002, an inhibitor for phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), and short hairpin RNAs for LXRŒ≤ knockdown, abrogated GW3965-induced Akt phosphorylation, and therefore abolished GW3965-mediated proliferation-promoting of NPCs. All the data suggested that GW3965 ameliorated impaired cognitive functions in CCH by promoting NSC proliferation through PI3K/Akt pathway followed LXRŒ≤ activation. This study correlates a deficit of LXRŒ≤ in cognitive dysfunction in CCH with impaired neurogenesis in hippocampus, and LXRs may serve as a potential therapeutic target for chronic cerebral ischemia.
Nuclear receptors regulate gene expression in response to environmental cues, but the molecular events governing the cell type specificity of nuclear receptors remain poorly understood. Here we outline a role for a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) in modulating the cell type-specific actions of liver X receptors (LXRs), sterol-activated nuclear receptors that regulate the expression of genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis and that have been causally linked to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. We identify the lncRNA MeXis as an amplifier of LXR-dependent transcription of the gene Abca1, which is critical for regulation of cholesterol efflux. Mice lacking the MeXis gene show reduced Abca1 expression in a tissue-selective manner. Furthermore, loss of MeXis in mouse bone marrow cells alters chromosome architecture at the Abca1 locus, impairs cellular responses to cholesterol overload, and accelerates the development of atherosclerosis. Mechanistic studies reveal that MeXis interacts with and guides promoter binding of the transcriptional coactivator DDX17. The identification of MeXis as a lncRNA modulator of LXR-dependent gene expression expands understanding of the mechanisms underlying cell type-selective actions of nuclear receptors in physiology and disease.
The Liver X receptors (LXRs) are members of the nuclear receptor family, that play fundamental roles in cholesterol transport, lipid metabolism and modulation of inflammatory responses. In recent years, the synthetic steroid N,N-dimethyl-3Œ≤-hydroxycholenamide (DMHCA) arised as a promising LXR ligand. This compound was able to dissociate certain beneficial LXRs effects from those undesirable ones involved in triglyceride metabolism. Here, we synthetized a series of DMHCA analogues with different modifications in the steroidal nucleus involving the A/B ring fusion, that generate changes in the overall conformation of the steroid. The LXRŒ± and LXRŒ≤ activity of these analogues was evaluated by using a luciferase reporter assay in BHK21 cells. Compounds were tested in both the agonist and antagonist modes. Results indicated that the agonist/antagonist profile is dependent on the steroid configuration at the A/B ring junction. Notably, in contrast to DMHCA, the amide derived from lithocholic acid (2) with an A/B cis configuration and its 6,19-epoxy analogue 4 behaved as LXRŒ± selective agonists, while the 2,19-epoxy analogues with an A/B trans configuration were antagonists of both isoforms. The binding mode of the analogues to both LXR isoforms was assessed by using 50‚ÄØns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Results revealed conformational differences between LXRŒ±- and LXRŒ≤-ligand complexes, mainly in the hydrogen bonding network that involves the C-3 hydroxyl. Overall, these results indicate that the synthetized DMHCA analogues could be interesting candidates for a therapeutic modulation of the LXRs.
(1) To investigate the expression patterns of MŒ¶1 and MŒ¶2 phenotype markers of peripheral blood monocyte (PBMC)-derived macrophages in atherosclerosis patients and healthy controls, as well as the expression correlation among these genes. (2) To elucidate whether a high level of liver X receptor Œ± (LXRŒ±) expression is associated with anti-inflammatory MŒ¶2-type polarization.
Peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) were obtained from 28 patients with carotid artery plaques and 10 normal persons, who did not have carotid artery plaques. M1 and M2 phenotype markers were analyzed after cellular differentiation into macrophages. Human macrophages derived from healthy donors were transfected with plasmid DNA encoding LXRŒ± and control null-plasmids. Gene expression levels were quantified after further differentiation.
Three genes (LXRŒ±, CD68, and CD36) were expressed at a significantly lower rate in the atherosclerotic group than normal patients. There were correlations between the expression of LXRŒ±, CD68, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARŒ≥), and between CD163, CD36 and scavenger receptor class A (SRA1). Macrophages over-expressing LXRŒ± exhibited enhanced expression level of MŒ¶2-type genes and decreased expression level of MŒ¶1-type genes.
PBMCs from healthy persons were predisposed to the MŒ¶2 differentiation phenotype, which exhibits elevated cholesterol uptake and anti-inflammatory properties. LXRŒ± over-expression polarizes macrophages towards the anti-inflammatory MŒ¶2 phenotype.
Dendrogenin A (DDA) is a mammalian cholesterol metabolite recently identified that displays tumor suppressor properties. The discovery of DDA has revealed the existence in mammals of a new metabolic branch in the cholesterol pathway centered on 5,6Œ±-epoxycholesterol and bridging cholesterol metabolism with histamine metabolism. Metabolic studies showed a drop in DDA levels in cancer cells and tumors compared to normal cells, suggesting a link between DDA metabolism deregulation and oncogenesis. Importantly, complementation of cancer cells with DDA induced 1) cancer cell re-differentiation, 2) blockade of 6-oxo-cholestan-3Œ≤,5Œ±-diol (OCDO) production, an endogenous tumor promoter and 3) lethal autophagy in tumors. Importantly, by binding the liver X receptor (LXR), DDA activates the expression of genes controlling autophagy. These genes include NR4A1, NR4A3, LC3 and TFEB. The canonical LXR ligands 22(R)hydroxycholesterol, TO901317 and GW3965 did not induce these effects indicating that DDA delineates a new class of selective LXR modulator (SLiM). The induction of lethal autophagy by DDA was associated with the accumulation in cancer cells of lysosomes and of the pro-lysosomal cholesterol precursor zymostenol due to the inhibition of the 3Œ≤-hydroxysteroid-Œî8Œî7-isomerase enzyme (D8D7I). The anti-cancer efficacy of DDA was established on different mouse and human cancers such as breast cancers, melanoma and acute myeloid leukemia, including patient derived xenografts, and did not discriminate bulk cancer cells from cancer cell progenitors. Together these data highlight that the mammalian metabolite DDA is a promising anticancer compound with a broad range of anticancer applications. In addition, DDA and LXR are new actors in the transcriptional control of autophagy and DDA being a "first in line" driver of lethal autophagy in cancers via the LXR.
Our aim was to evaluate lipid trafficking and inflammatory response of macrophages exposed to lipoproteins from subjects with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (CKD), and to investigate the potential benefits of activating cellular cholesterol transporters via liver X receptor (LXR) agonism.
LDL and HDL were isolated by sequential density gradient ultracentrifugation of plasma from patients with stage 3-4 CKD and individuals without kidney disease (HDLCKD and HDLCont, respectively). Uptake of LDL, cholesterol efflux to HDL, and cellular inflammatory responses were assessed in human THP-1 cells. HDL effects on inflammatory markers (MCP-1, TNF-Œ±, IL-1Œ≤), Toll-like receptors-2 (TLR-2) and -‚Äâ4 (TLR-4), ATP-binding cassette class A transporter (ABCA1), NF-Œ∫B, extracellular signal regulated protein kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) were assessed by RT-PCR and western blot before and after in vitro treatment with an LXR agonist.
There was no difference in macrophage uptake of LDL isolated from CKD versus controls. By contrast, HDCKD was significantly less effective than HDLCont in accepting cholesterol from cholesterol-enriched macrophages (median 20.8% [IQR 16.1-23.7] vs control (26.5% [IQR 19.6-28.5]; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.008). LXR agonist upregulated ABCA1 expression and increased cholesterol efflux to HDL of both normal and CKD subjects, although the latter continued to show lower efflux capacity. HDLCKD increased macrophage cytokine response (TNF-Œ±, MCP-1, IL-1Œ≤, and NF-Œ∫B) versus HDLCont. The heightened cytokine response to HDLCKD was further amplified in cells treated with LXR agonist. The LXR-augmentation of inflammation was associated with increased TLR-2 and TLR-4 and ERK1/2.
Moderate to severe impairment in kidney function promotes foam cell formation that reflects impairment in cholesterol acceptor function of HDLCKD. Activation of cellular cholesterol transporters by LXR agonism improves but does not normalize efflux to HDLCKD. However, LXR agonism actually increases the pro-inflammatory effects of HDLCKD through activation of TLRs and ERK1/2 pathways.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a life-threatening pathogen in humans. Bacterial infection of macrophages usually triggers strong innate immune mechanisms, including IL-1 cytokine secretion. The newer member of the IL-1 family, IL-36, was recently shown to be involved in cellular defense against Mtb. To unveil the underlying mechanism of IL-36 induced antibacterial activity, we analyzed its role in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism, together with the involvement of Liver X Receptor (LXR) in this process. We report that, in Mtb-infected macrophages, IL-36 signaling modulates cholesterol biosynthesis and efflux via LXR. Moreover, IL-36 induces the expression of cholesterol-converting enzymes and the accumulation of LXR ligands, such as oxysterols. Ultimately, both IL-36 and LXR signaling play a role in the regulation of antimicrobial peptides expression and in Mtb growth restriction. These data provide novel evidence for the importance of IL-36 and cholesterol metabolism mediated by LXR in cellular host defense against Mtb.
Macrophages play an essential role in lipid metabolism; however, the excessive uptake of modified lipids and cholesterol crystals (CC) leads to the formation of pro-inflammatory lipid-laden macrophages called foam cells. Since the Œ±-1,6- and Œ≤-1,3-d-glucans from the basidiome and the mycelium of the edible mushroom Pleurotus albidus have previously been shown to regulate macrophage function, these glucans were tested in macrophage-like THP-1 cells previously exposed to acetylated low-density lipoproteins (acLDL) or CC. The glucans inhibited lipid-induced inflammation, but only the Œ≤-1,3-d-glucan regulated both the NLRP3 inflammasome activation and the expression of genes involved on lipid efflux in acLDL- or CC-pretreated cells, thereby reducing foam cell formation. In contrast, the two Œ±-1,6-glucans tested inhibited foam cell formation only in acLDL-pretreated cells and had no effect on the expression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and liver X receptor alpha genes, suggesting that these glucans regulate lipid influx rather than lipid efflux. Thus, Œ±- and Œ≤-d-glucans differentially regulate lipid-induced inflammation and foam cell formation in macrophage-like cells. Furthermore, results emphasize that P. albidus has potential to be used as a functional food or as a source for the extraction of biologically-active glucans.
There is increased expression of liver x receptor (LXR) target genes and reduced low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) during spontaneous luteolysis in primates. The LXRs are nuclear receptors that increase cholesterol efflux by inducing transcription of their target genes. Transcription of LDLR is regulated by sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs). Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) prevents luteolysis and stimulates progesterone synthesis via protein kinase A (PKA). Thus, our primary objectives are: 1) Determine the effects of LXR activation and SREBP inhibition on progesterone secretion and cholesterol metabolism, and 2) Determine whether hCG signaling via PKA regulates transcription of LXR and SREBP target genes in human luteinized granulosa cells. Basal and hCG-stimulated progesterone secretion was significantly decreased by the combined actions of the LXR agonist T0901317 and the SREBP inhibitor fatostatin, which was associated with reduced intracellular cholesterol storage. Expression of LXR target genes in the presence of T0901317 was significantly reduced by hCG, while hCG promoted transcriptional changes that favor LDL uptake. These effects of hCG were reversed by a specific PKA inhibitor. A third objective was to resolve a dilemma concerning LXR regulation of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR) expression in primate and non-primate steroidogenic cells. T0901317 induced STAR expression and progesterone synthesis in ovine, but not human cells, revealing a key difference between species in LXR regulation of luteal function. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that LXR-induced cholesterol efflux and reduced LDL uptake via SREBP inhibition mediates luteolysis in primates, which is prevented by hCG.
Oxysterols are oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol formed in the human body or ingested in the diet. By modulating the activity of many proteins (for instance, liver X receptors, oxysterol-binding proteins, some ATP-binding cassette transporters), oxysterols can affect many cellular functions and influence various physiological processes (e.g., cholesterol metabolism, membrane fluidity regulation, intracellular signaling pathways). Due to their crucial role, it is important to be able to quantify them in pathological conditions. The method described here permits to measure the content of oxysterol in plasma, cell, or media using GC-MS.
Targeting at enhancing reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) is apromising strategy for treating atherosclerosis via infusion of reconstitute high density lipoprotein (HDL) as cholesterol acceptors or increase of cholesterol efflux by activation of macrophage liver X receptors (LXRs). However, systemic activation of LXRs triggers excessive lipogenesis in the liver and infusion of HDL downregulates cholesterol efflux from macrophages. Here we describe an enlightened strategy using phospholipid reconstituted apoA-I peptide (22A)-derived synthetic HDL (sHDL) to deliver LXR agonists to the atheroma and examine their effect on atherosclerosis regression in vivo. A synthetic LXR agonist, T0901317 (T1317) was encapsulated in sHDL nanoparticles (sHDL-T1317). Similar to the T1317 compound, the sHDL-T1317 nanoparticles upregulated the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporters and increased cholesterol efflux in macrophages in vitro and in vivo. The sHDL nanoparticles accumulated in the atherosclerotic plaques of ApoE-deficient mice. Moreover, a 6-week low-dose LXR agonist-sHDL treatment induced atherosclerosis regression while avoiding lipid accumulation in the liver. These findings identify LXR agonist loaded sHDL nanoparticles as a promising therapeutic approach to treat atherosclerosis by targeting RCT in a multifaceted manner: sHDL itself serving as both a drug carrier and cholesterol acceptor and the LXR agonist mediating upregulation of ABC transporters in the aorta.
Cholesterol synthesis and clearance by astrocytes are tightly regulated to maintain constant levels within the brain. In this context, liver X receptors (LXRs) are the master regulators of cholesterol homeostasis in the central nervous system (CNS). Increasing levels of cholesterol in astrocytes trigger LXR activation leading to the transcription of target genes involved in cholesterol trafficking and efflux, including apolipoprotein E, cytochrome P450 enzymes, sterol regulatory binding protein, and several ATP-binding cassette transporter proteins. The disturbance of LXR signaling in the brain can lead to significant dysfunctions in cholesterol homeostasis, and disruptions in this pathway have been implicated in numerous neurological diseases including Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease. HIV infection of the CNS in combination with cocaine use is associated with astrocyte and neuronal energy deficit and damage. We propose that dysregulation in CNS cholesterol metabolism may be involved in the progression of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) and in cocaine-mediated neurocognitive impairments. We hypothesize that exposure of astrocytes to cocaine and the HIV protein Tat will disrupt LXR signaling. Alterations in these pathways will in turn, affect cholesterol bioavailability for neurons. Our data show that exposure of astrocytes to cocaine and HIV-Tat significantly decreases LXRŒ≤ levels, downstream signaling and bioavailability of cholesterol. Taken together, these data uncover novel alterations in a bioenergetic pathway in astrocytes exposed to cocaine and the HIV protein Tat. Results from these studies point to a new pathway in the CNS that may contribute to HAND in HIV+ cocaine user individuals.
Macrophage foam cells store excess cholesterol as cholesteryl esters, which need to be hydrolyzed for cholesterol efflux. We recently reported that silencing expression of carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) in human THP-1 macrophages [CES1KD (THP-1 cells with CES1 expression knocked down) macrophages] reduced cholesterol uptake and decreased expression of CD36 and scavenger receptor-A in cells loaded with acetylated low-density lipoprotein (acLDL). Here, we report that CES1KD macrophages exhibit reduced transcription of cytochrome P45027A1 (CYP27A1) in nonloaded and acLDL-loaded cells. Moreover, levels of CYP27A1 protein and its enzymatic product, 27-hydroxycholesterol, were markedly reduced in CES1KD macrophages. Transcription of LXRŒ± (liver X receptor Œ±) and ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette transporter A1) was also decreased in acLDL-loaded CES1KD macrophages, suggesting reduced signaling through PPARŒ≥-CYP27A1-LXRŒ±. Consistent with this, treatment of CES1KD macrophages with agonists for PPARŒ≥, RAR, and/or RAR/RXR partially restored transcription of CYP27A1 and LXRŒ±, and repaired cholesterol influx. Conversely, treatment of control macrophages with antagonists for PPARŒ≥ and/or RXR decreased transcription of CYP27A1 and LXRŒ± Pharmacologic inhibition of CES1 in both wild-type THP-1 cells and primary human macrophages also decreased CYP27A1 transcription. CES1 silencing did not affect transcript levels of PPARŒ≥ and RXR in acLDL-loaded macrophages, whereas it did reduce the catabolism of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol. Finally, the gene expression profile of CES1KD macrophages was similar to that of PPARŒ≥ knockdown cells following acLDL exposures, further suggesting a mechanistic link between CES1 and PPARŒ≥. These results are consistent with a model in which abrogation of CES1 function attenuates the CYP27A1-LXRŒ±-ABCA1 signaling axis by depleting endogenous ligands for the nuclear receptors PPARŒ≥, RAR, and/or RXR that regulate cholesterol homeostasis.
The ABC lipid transporters, ABCA1 and ABCG1, are essential for maintaining lipid homeostasis in cells such as macrophages by exporting excess cholesterol to extracellular acceptors. These transporters are highly regulated at the post-translational level, including protein ubiquitination. Our aim was to investigate the role of the E3 ubiquitin ligase HECTD1, recently identified as associated with ABCG1, on ABCG1 and ABCA1 protein levels and cholesterol export function. Here, we show that HECTD1 protein is widely expressed in a range of human and murine primary cells and cell lines, including macrophages, neuronal cells and insulin secreting Œ≤-cells. siRNA knockdown of HECTD1 unexpectedly decreased overexpressed ABCG1 protein levels and cell growth, but increased native ABCA1 protein in CHO-K1 cells. Knockdown of HECTD1 in unloaded THP-1 macrophages did not affect ABCG1 but significantly increased ABCA1 protein levels, in wild-type as well as THP-1 cells that do not express ABCG1. Cholesterol export from macrophages to apoA-I over time was increased after knockdown of HECTD1, however these effects were not sustained in cholesterol-loaded cells. In conclusion, we have identified a new candidate, the E3 ubiquitin ligase HECTD1, that may be involved in the regulation of ABCA1-mediated cholesterol export from unloaded macrophages to apoA-I. The exact mechanism by which this ligase affects this pathway remains to be elucidated.
oxLDL is involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic lesions through cholesterol accumulation in macrophage foam cells. Andrographolide, the bioactive component of Andrographis paniculata, possesses several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anticancer functions. Scavenger receptors (SRs), including class A SR (SR-A) and CD36, are responsible for the internalization of oxLDL. In contrast, receptors for reverse cholesterol transport, including ABCA1 and ABCG1, mediate the efflux of cholesterol from macrophage foam cells. Transcription factor liver X receptor [Formula: see text] (LXR[Formula: see text] plays a key role in lipid metabolism and inflammation as well as in the regulation of ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression. Because of the contribution of inflammation to macrophage foam cell formation and the potent anti-inflammatory activity of andrographolide, we hypothesized that andrographolide might inhibit oxLDL-induced macrophage foam cell formation. The results showed that andrographolide reduced oxLDL-induced lipid accumulation in macrophage foam cells. Andrographolide decreased the mRNA and protein expression of CD36 by inducing the degradation of CD36 mRNA; however, andrographolide had no effect on SR-A expression. In contrast, andrographolide increased the mRNA and protein expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1, which were dependent on LXR[Formula: see text]. Andrographolide enhanced LXR[Formula: see text] nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity. Treatment with the LXR[Formula: see text] antagonist GGPP and transfection with LXR[Formula: see text] siRNA reversed the ability of andrographolide to stimulate ABCA1 and ABCG1 protein expression. In conclusion, inhibition of CD36-mediated oxLDL uptake and induction of ABCA1- and ABCG1-dependent cholesterol efflux are two working mechanisms by which andrographolide inhibits macrophage foam cell formation, which suggests that andrographolide could be a potential candidate to prevent atherosclerosis.
Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) is the process to deliver cholesterol to the liver for further excretion and involves scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI)-mediated selective lipid uptake (SLU) from high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). The up-regulation of hepatic SR-BI expression accelerates HDL-C clearance in circulation and impedes the development of atherosclerosis (AS). In the present study, we explored the modulation of hepatic SR-BI expression and SR-BI-mediated SLU by quercetin, a natural flavonoid compound in the diet with a favorable role in cardiovascular disorders. We found that quercetin significantly increased the expression level of SR-BI in HepG2 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Besides, quercetin had stimulatory effects on the binding of 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (Dil)-labeled HDL to hepatocytes and 125I/3H-CE-HDL association. Treatment with small interfering RNA (siRNA) or SR-BI specific inhibitor, BLT-1, inhibited quercetin-induced Dil-HDL binding and selective HDL-C uptake. Treatment with quercetin increased both proliferator-activated receptor Œ≥ (PPARŒ≥) and liver X receptor Œ± (LXRŒ±) levels. Additionally, the quercetin-induced expression of SR-BI, Dil-HDL binding and the selective uptake of HDL-C were significantly attenuated by treatment with PPARŒ≥ siRNA, LXRŒ± siRNA, and their antagonists, respectively. In C57BL/6 mice, quercetin administration potently increased SR-BI, PPARŒ≥ and LXRŒ± levels and lipid accumulation in the liver. Altogether, our results suggest that quercetin-induced up-regulation of SR-BI and subsequent lipid uptake in hepatocytes might contribute to its beneficial effects on cholesterol homeostasis and atherogenesis.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are important members of the nuclear receptor family that were originally determined to function in cholesterol transport and the regulation of immune responses. Synthetic LXR ligands have been developed to treat various diseases including diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis. Previous studies have suggested that LXRs are also involved in numerous types of cancer and are therefore potential targets for cancer therapeutics. The present review summarizes LXR ligands and their mechanisms of action, the effects of LXRs in different types of cancer and their potential applications in clinical treatment. Together, the studies discussed in the present review indicate that LXRs may be potential targets for cancer therapeutics.
It is well established that cholesterol and glycosphingolipids are enriched in the plasma membrane (PM) and form signaling platforms called lipid rafts, essential for T-cell activation and function. Moreover, changes in PM lipid composition affect the biophysical properties of lipid rafts and have a role in defining functional T-cell phenotypes. Here, we review the role of transcriptional regulators of lipid metabolism including liver X receptors Œ±/Œ≤, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Œ≥, estrogen receptors Œ±/Œ≤ (ERŒ±/Œ≤), and sterol regulatory element-binding proteins in T-cells. These receptors lie at the interface between lipid metabolism and immune cell function and are endogenously activated by lipids and/or hormones. Importantly, they regulate cellular cholesterol, fatty acid, glycosphingolipid, and phospholipid levels but are also known to modulate a broad spectrum of immune responses. The current evidence supporting a role for lipid metabolism pathways in controlling immune cell activation by influencing PM lipid raft composition in health and disease, and the potential for targeting lipid biosynthesis pathways to control unwanted T-cell activation in autoimmunity is reviewed.
Deficiency of hepatic Nogo-B receptor (NgBR) expression activates liver X receptor Œ± (LXRŒ±) in an adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase Œ± (AMPKŒ±)-dependent manner, thereby inducing severe hepatic lipid accumulation and hypertriglyceridemia. Statins have been demonstrated non-cholesterol lowering effects including anti-nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Herein, we investigated if the anti-NAFLD function of statins depends on activation of NgBR expression. In vivo, atorvastatin protected apoE deficient or NgBR floxed, but not hepatic NgBR deficient mice, against Western diet (WD)-increased triglyceride levels in liver and serum. In vitro, statins reduced lipid accumulation in nonsilencing small hairpin RNA-transfected (shNSi), but not in NgBR small hairpin RNA-transfected (shNgBRi) HepG2 cells. Inhibition of cellular lipid accumulation by atorvastatin is related to activation of AMPKŒ±, and inactivation of LXRŒ± and lipogenic genes. Statin also inhibited expression of oxysterol producing enzymes. Associated with changes of hepatic lipid levels by WD or atorvastatin, NgBR expression was inversely regulated. At cellular levels, statins increased NgBR mRNA and protein expression, and NgBR protein stability. In contrast to reduced cellular cholesterol levels by statin or Œ≤-cyclodextrin, increased cellular cholesterol levels decreased NgBR expression suggesting cholesterol or its synthesis intermediates inhibit NgBR expression. Indeed, mevalonate, geranylgeraniol or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, but not farnesyl pyrophosphate or farnesol, blocked atorvastatin-induced NgBR expression. Furthermore, we determined that induction of hepatic NgBR expression by atorvastatin mainly depended on inactivation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) and protein kinase B (Akt). Taken together, our study demonstrates that statins inhibit NAFLD mainly through activation of NgBR expression.
Oxysterols, oxygenated by-products of cholesterol biosynthesis, play roles in various physiological and pathological systems. However, the effects of oxysterols on periodontal regeneration are unknown. This study investigated the effects of the specific oxysterol combination of 22(S)-hydroxycholesterol and 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol (SS) on the regeneration of periodontal tissues using in-vitro periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) and in-vivo models of alveolar bone defect.
To evaluate the effects of the combined oxysterols on PDLSC biology, we studied the SS-induced osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs by assessing alkaline phosphatase activity, intracellular calcium levels [Ca2+]i, matrix mineralization, and osteogenic marker mRNA expression and protein levels. To verify the effect of oxysterols on alveolar bone regeneration, we employed tooth extraction bone defect models.
Oxysterols increased the osteogenic activity of PDLSCs compared with the control group. The expression of liver X receptor (LXR) Œ± and Œ≤, the nuclear receptors for oxysterols, and their target gene, ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), increased significantly during osteogenesis. Oxysterols also increased protein levels of the hedgehog (Hh) receptor Smo and the transcription factor Gli1. We further confirmed the reciprocal reaction between the LXRs and Hh signaling. Transfection of both LXRŒ± and LXRŒ≤ siRNAs decreased Smo and Gli1 protein levels. In contrast, the inhibition of Hh signaling attenuated the LXRŒ± and LXRŒ≤ protein levels. Subsequently, SS-induced osteogenic activity of PDLSCs was suppressed by the inhibition of LXRs or Hh signaling. The application of SS also enhanced bone formation in the defect sites of in-vivo models, showing equivalent efficacy to recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2.
These findings suggest that a specific combination of oxysterols promoted periodontal regeneration by regulating PDLSC activity and alveolar bone regeneration.
Dendrogenin A (DDA) is a newly discovered cholesterol metabolite with tumor suppressor properties. Here, we explored its efficacy and mechanism of cell death in melanoma and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We found that DDA induced lethal autophagy in vitro and in vivo, including primary AML patient samples, independently of melanoma Braf status or AML molecular and cytogenetic classifications. DDA is a partial agonist on liver-X-receptor (LXR) increasing Nur77, Nor1, and LC3 expression leading to autolysosome formation. Moreover, DDA inhibited the cholesterol biosynthesizing enzyme 3Œ≤-hydroxysterol-Œî8,7-isomerase (D8D7I) leading to sterol accumulation and cooperating in autophagy induction. This mechanism of death was not observed with other LXR ligands or D8D7I inhibitors establishing DDA selectivity. The potent anti-tumor activity of DDA, its original mechanism of action and its low toxicity support its clinical evaluation. More generally, this study reveals that DDA can direct control a nuclear receptor to trigger lethal autophagy in cancers.
Nimbolide is a bioactive compound found in Azadirachta indica. This work was devised to investigate the potential effects of nimbolide on intracellular lipid deposition and its associated redox modulation in primary hepatocytes (Heps). Lipid accumulation was induced in Heps by supplementing 1¬†mM oleic acid for 24¬†h which was marked by significant accumulation of lipids. The results demonstrated that nimbolide can decrease intracellular cholesterol, free fatty acids and triglycerides. Nimbolide may also improve hepatocytes function through its antioxidant effects by inhibiting oxidative DNA damage and lipid peroxidation by curtailing the reactive oxygen species levels. Further it also restore the mitochondrial potential, improving the endogenous antioxidant levels such as GSH and antioxidant enzyme activities. Nimbolide increased (P‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.05) liver X receptor-Œ± (LXRŒ±), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Œ≥ (PPARŒ≥) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP1c) gene expression in Heps. The biological significance of nimbolide may involve hypolipidemic effect, lipid peroxidation inhibition, DNA damage inhibition, ROS inhibition, restoring mitochondrial function, increases in GSH and SOD &amp; CAT activities, and direct regulation of LXRŒ±, PPARŒ≥ and SREBP1c gene expression. Nimbolide may be used as effective lipid lowering compound and lipid deposition-induced Heps changes.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) participate not only in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis but also in controlling cellular growth in many types of normal and tumor cells. We previously reported that LXRŒ± was aberrantly expressed in human oral squamous cell carcinoma (HOSCC) tissues and cell lines, and that LXR stimulation led to significant reduction of proliferation of HOSCC cells via accelerating cholesterol efflux. Since LXRs and downstream proteins involved in cholesterol metabolism could be also applied as therapeutic targets in small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), we herein analyzed the distribution of LXR proteins in these refractory cancers as well as in normal human lung and pancreatic tissues. LXRŒ≤ was observed in ciliated epithelial cells, bronchial gland epithelia, type II alveolar epithelia and alveolar macrophages of the lung, and was less expressed in bronchial basal cells and type I alveolar epithelia. In addition, LXRŒ≤ was detected in epithelium of the pancreatic duct and acinar cells of the pancreas, and was weakly expressed in pancreatic islet cells. By contrast, LXRŒ± expression was restricted to alveolar macrophages, and was not evident in any types of epithelial cells in the lung and pancreas. We also demonstrated that LXRŒ≤ but not LXRŒ± was abundantly expressed in nine cases of SCLC and twenty cases of PDAC tissues. These findings provide basic information for evaluating the efficacy of LXR-targeted treatment in SCLC and PDAC.
Dysfunctional macrophages underlie the development of several diseases including atherosclerosis where accumulation of cholesteryl esters and persistent inflammation are 2 of the critical macrophage processes that regulate the progression as well as stability of atherosclerotic plaques. Ligand-dependent activation of liver-x-receptor (LXR) not only enhances mobilization of stored cholesteryl ester but also exerts anti-inflammatory effects mediated via trans-repression of proinflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B. However, increased hepatic lipogenesis by systemic administration of LXR ligands (LXR-L) has precluded their therapeutic use. The objective of the present study was to devise a strategy to selectively deliver LXR-L to atherosclerotic plaque-associated macrophages while limiting hepatic uptake. Mannose-functionalized dendrimeric nanoparticles (mDNP) were synthesized to facilitate active uptake via the mannose receptor expressed exclusively by macrophages using polyamidoamine dendrimer. Terminal amine groups were used to conjugate mannose and LXR-L T091317 via polyethylene glycol spacers. mDNP-LXR-L was effectively taken up by macrophages (and not by hepatocytes), increased expression of LXR target genes (ABCA1/ABCG1), and enhanced cholesterol efflux. When administered intravenously to LDLR-/- mice with established plaques, significant accumulation of fluorescently labeled mDNP-LXR-L was seen in atherosclerotic plaque-associated macrophages. Four weekly injections of mDNP-LXR-L led to significant reduction in atherosclerotic plaque progression, plaque necrosis, and plaque inflammation as assessed by expression of nuclear factor kappa B target gene matrix metalloproteinase 9; no increase in hepatic lipogenic genes or plasma lipids was observed. These studies validate the development of a macrophage-specific delivery platform for the delivery of anti-atherosclerotic agents directly to the plaque-associated macrophages to attenuate plaque burden.
The lung has a unique relationship to cholesterol that is shaped by its singular physiology. On the one hand, the lungs receive the full cardiac output and have a predominant dependence on plasma lipoprotein uptake for their cholesterol supply. On the other hand, surfactant lipids, including cholesterol, are continually susceptible to oxidation owing to direct environmental exposure and must be cleared or recycled because of the very narrow biophysical mandates placed upon surfactant lipid composition. Interestingly, increased lipid-laden macrophage "foam cells" have been noted in a wide range of human lung pathologies. This suggests that lipid dysregulation may be a unifying and perhaps contributory event in chronic lung disease pathogenesis. Recent studies have shown that perturbations in intracellular cholesterol trafficking critically modify the immune response of macrophages and other cells. This minireview discusses literature that has begun to demonstrate the importance of regulated cholesterol traffic through the lung to pulmonary immunity, inflammation, and fibrosis. This emerging recognition of coupling between immunity and lipid homeostasis in the lung presents potentially transformative concepts for understanding lung disease and may also offer novel and exciting avenues for therapeutic development.
The present work investigates the modulation of grapefruit flavonoid naringenin over liver X receptor alpha (LXRŒ±) and its target genes in THP-1 macrophages, focusing on AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) implication. Naringenin induced LXRŒ± at mRNA and protein levels besides influencing the expression of LXRŒ± target genes ABCA1, ABCG1 (ATP-binding cassette A1 and G1), and SREBP1c (sterol response element binding protein 1c) in THP-1 macrophages. The increased LXRŒ± mRNA and protein expression was reverted when AMPK was inhibited by its chemical inhibitor, compound C or by transfection with AMPK Œ±1 and Œ±2 siRNA. Naringenin treatments were also able to promote reverse cholesterol transport in THP-1 cells, which is in line with the increase in the ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression found. Treatments with this flavonoid also inhibited cell migration in THP-1 cells. In conclusion, LXRŒ± and its target genes are up-regulated by naringenin in an AMPK dependent manner in human macrophages. The enhancement in the expression of genes involved in cholesterol efflux may reveal a new mechanism by which this polyphenol can prevent atherosclerosis and foam cell progression.
Liver X receptors (LXR) are important transcription factors involved in the regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Recently, we described LXR receptors expression in the hypothalamus but their function in this brain area remains unknown. Here, we evaluated the function of LXR on the expression of factors produced in the hypothalamus in vitro and in vivo by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. More precisely we studied the expression of GnRH and GHRH, Œ±MSH and NPY in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The effects of two synthetic LXR agonists, T0901317 and GW3965, were first tested in vitro. Hypothalamic explants were treated with either T0901317 or GW3965 (10ŒºM) for 2, 4, 6 and 8h. As a positive control the cholesterol ABCA1 and glucose GLUT2 transporters were used. No changes were observed in the expression of the factors evaluated in vitro. The effects of the LXR agonists were then tested in vivo. Rats were injected ICV into the third ventricle with either T0901317 or GW3965 (2.5Œºg/5ŒºL ICV) and after 3.5h or 24h the hypothalami were dissected out and rapidly frozen for analysis. Œ±MSH and GnRH expression was significantly increased after 3.5h of T0901317 treatment. Anterior/posterior hypothalamic ratio increases for Œ±MSH expression and decreases for GnRH expression after 24h of LXR activation. Altogether these results show that LXR activation affects the expression of GnRH and Œ±MSH, suggesting that LXR in the hypothalamus is capable of modulating hypothalamic responses related to appetite, sexual behavior and reproductive functions.
Ribosome biogenesis has been implicated in resistance exercise training (RET)-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy. However, it is unclear how increasing bouts of RET affects ribosome content and biogenesis. This was investigated in the present study using simulated RET where rat skeletal muscle is subjected to increasing bouts of electrical stimulations. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to the following seven groups: sedentary for 5 days (SED) or 6 weeks (SED_6w), resistance-exercise trained with 1 bout (1B), 2 bouts (2B), 3 bouts (3B), 6 bouts (6B), and 18 bouts (18B). RET was simulated on the right gastrocnemius muscle by transcutaneous electric stimulation under isoflurane anesthesia, and RET bout was given 3 times a week. Rats in 1B, 2B and 3B groups showed increased 45S precursor (pre-) rRNA and 18S+28S rRNA content per muscle weight and elevated mRNA levels of c-myc and upstream binding factor (UBF). Increases in phosphorylated UBF and total cyclin D1 protein level were observed 48 h after RET; the former increased as a function of RET duration. In 3B, 6B and 18B groups, the 18S+28S rRNA content per muscle weight was kept unchanged, and 45S pre-rRNA, cyclin D1 and phosphorylated UBF levels in 18B were lower than those in 3B. These results suggest that RET activates ribosome biogenesis and increases ribosome content through modulation of UBF and cyclin D1 activity at its early phase. Additional bouts of RET may not lead to further increase in ribosome content per muscle weight through possibly the attenuation of transcription process.
The cardioprotective effects of HDL have been largely attributed to their role in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway, whose efficiency is affected by many proteins involved in the formation and remodelling of HDL. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects, and possible mechanisms of action, of unsaturated fatty acids on the expression of genes involved in HDL metabolism in HepG2 cells. The mRNA concentration of target genes was assessed by real-time PCR. Protein concentrations were determined by Western blot or immunoassays. PPAR and liver X receptor (LXR) activities were assessed in transfection experiments. Compared with the SFA palmitic acid (PA), the PUFA arachidonic acid (AA), EPA and DHA significantly decreased apoA-I, ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1), lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) and phospholipid transfer protein mRNA levels. EPA and DHA significantly lowered the protein concentration of apoA-I and LCAT in the media, as well as the cellular ABCA1 protein content. In addition, DHA repressed the apoA-I promoter activity. AA lowered only the protein concentration of LCAT in the media. The activity of PPAR was increased by DHA, while the activity of LXR was lowered by both DHA and AA, relative to PA. The regulation of these transcription factors by PUFA may explain some of the PUFA effects on gene expression. The observed n-3 PUFA-mediated changes in gene expression are predicted to reduce the rate of HDL particle formation and maturation.
The transition from the nonlactating to the lactating state represents a critical period for dairy cow lipid metabolism because body reserves have to be mobilized to meet the increasing energy requirements for the initiation of milk production. The purpose of this study was to provide a comprehensive overview on cholesterol homeostasis in transition dairy cows by assessing in parallel plasma, milk, and hepatic tissue for key factors of cholesterol metabolism, transport, and regulation. Blood samples and liver biopsies were taken from 50 multiparous Holstein dairy cows in wk 3 antepartum (a.p.), wk 1 postpartum (p.p.), wk 4 p.p., and wk 14 p.p. Milk sampling was performed in wk 1, 4, and 14 p.p. Blood and milk lipid concentrations [triglycerides (TG), cholesterol, and lipoproteins], enzyme activities (phospholipid transfer protein and lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase) were analyzed using enzymatic assays. Hepatic gene expression patterns of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMGC) synthase 1 (HMGCS1) and HMGC reductase (HMGCR), sterol regulatory element-binding factor (SREBF)-1 and -2, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP), ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC) A1 and ABCG1, liver X receptor (LXR) Œ± and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) Œ± and Œ≥ were measured using quantitative RT-PCR. Plasma TG, cholesterol, and lipoprotein concentrations decreased from wk 3 a.p. to a minimum in wk 1 p.p., and then gradually increased until wk 14 p.p. Compared with wk 4 p.p., phospholipid transfer protein activity was increased in wk 1 p.p., whereas lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase activity was lowest at this period. Total cholesterol concentration and mass, and cholesterol concentration in the milk fat fraction decreased from wk 1 p.p. to wk 4 p.p. Both total and milk fat cholesterol concentration were decreased in wk 4 p.p. compared with wk 1 and 14 p.p. The mRNA abundance of genes involved in cholesterol synthesis (SREBF-2, HMGCS1, and HMGCR) markedly increased from wk 3 a.p. to wk 1 p.p., whereas SREBF-1 was downregulated. The expression of ABCA1 increased from wk 3 a.p. to wk 1 p.p., whereas ABCG1 was increased in wk 14 p.p. compared with other time points. In conclusion, hepatic expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of cholesterol as well as the ABCA1 transporter were upregulated at the onset of lactation, whereas plasma concentrations of total cholesterol, phospholipids, lipoprotein-cholesterol, and TG were at a minimum. Thus, at the gene expression level, the liver seems to react to the increased demand for cholesterol after parturition. Whether the low plasma cholesterol and TG levels are due to impaired hepatic export mechanisms or reflect an enhanced transfer of these compounds into the milk to provide essential nutrients for the newborn remains to be elucidated. 
Liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor (LXR/RXR) transcription factors have been found to induce a number of genes involved in the regulation of cellular cholesterol efflux, including the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), which mediates the active efflux of cellular cholesterol and phospholipids to extracellular acceptors, such as apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I). In a screen for macrophage LXR/RXR target genes, we identified stearoyl-CoA desaturases 1 and 2 (Scd1 and Scd2), and subsequently tested the hypothesis that SCD activity might modulate cellular cholesterol efflux. In HEK 293 cells co-transfection of ABCA1 with either SCD1 or SCD2 inhibited ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux but not phospholipid efflux. In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with moderate stable overexpression of SCD1, cholesterol efflux to apoA-I was inhibited by 73%, whereas phospholipid efflux and ABCA1 protein levels were unchanged. In contrast, cholesterol efflux to HDL(2), which is not dependent on ABCA1, was increased 2-fold in CHO-SCD1 cells. The effect of SCD on cholesterol efflux to apoA-I was independent of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) activity. SCD activity led to an increased content of plasma membrane monounsaturated fatty acids (18:1) at the expense of saturated fatty acids (18:0). As shown by confocal microscopy, SCD overexpression led to a decrease of Triton X-100-resistant domains in the plasma membrane, indicating a decrease in membrane-ordered regions. The data suggest that SCD changes membrane organization and depletes a specific pool of membrane cholesterol supporting ABCA1-mediated efflux, whereas increasing availability of cholesterol for passive efflux by HDL(2). ABCA1-mediated cholesterol and phospholipid efflux may be uncoupled in pathological states associated with high SCD activity, as in hyperinsulinemic obese mice, or in animals treated with LXR activators.
Genetic deficiency or inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) leads to a marked increase in plasma levels of large HDL-2 particles. However, there is concern that such particles may be dysfunctional in terms of their ability to promote cholesterol efflux from macrophages. Recently, the ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCG1, a macrophage liver X receptor (LXR) target, has been shown to stimulate cholesterol efflux to HDL. We have assessed the ability of HDL from subjects with homozygous deficiency of CETP (CETP-D) to promote cholesterol efflux from macrophages and have evaluated the role of ABCG1 and other factors in this process. CETP-D HDL-2 caused a 2- to 3-fold stimulation of net cholesterol efflux compared with control HDL-2 in LXR-activated macrophages, due primarily to an increase in lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase-mediated (LCAT-mediated) cholesteryl ester formation in media. Genetic knockdown or overexpression of ABCG1 showed that increased cholesterol efflux to CETP-D HDL was ABCG1 dependent. LCAT and apoE contents of CETP-D HDL-2 were markedly increased compared with control HDL-2, and increased cholesterol esterification activity resided within the apoE-HDL fraction. Thus, CETP-D HDL has enhanced ability to promote cholesterol efflux from foam cells in an ABCG1-dependent pathway due to an increased content of LCAT and apoE.
Phospholipids are important determinants of membrane biophysical properties, but the impact of membrane acyl chain composition on dietary-lipid absorption is unknown. Here we demonstrate that the LXR-responsive phospholipid-remodeling enzyme Lpcat3 modulates intestinal fatty acid and cholesterol absorption and is required for survival on a high-fat diet. Mice lacking Lpcat3 in the intestine thrive on carbohydrate-based chow but lose body weight rapidly and become moribund on a triglyceride-rich diet. Lpcat3-dependent incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids into phospholipids is required for the efficient transport of dietary lipids into enterocytes. Furthermore, loss of Lpcat3 amplifies the production of gut hormones, including GLP-1 and oleoylethanolamide, in response to high-fat feeding, contributing to the paradoxical cessation of food intake in the setting of starvation. These results reveal that membrane phospholipid composition is a gating factor in passive lipid absorption and implicate LXR-Lpcat3 signaling in a gut-brain feedback loop that couples absorption to food intake.
Diabetes is characterized by increased lipogenesis as well as increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and inflammation. The nuclear hormone receptor liver X receptor (LXR) is induced by insulin and is a key regulator of lipid metabolism. It promotes lipogenesis and cholesterol efflux, but suppresses endoplasmic reticulum stress and inflammation. The goal of these studies was to dissect the effects of insulin on LXR action. We used antisense oligonucleotides to knock down LxrŒ± in mice with hepatocyte-specific deletion of the insulin receptor and their controls. We found, surprisingly, that knock-out of the insulin receptor and knockdown of LxrŒ± produced equivalent, non-additive effects on the lipogenic genes. Thus, insulin was unable to induce the lipogenic genes in the absence of LxrŒ±, and LXRŒ± was unable to induce the lipogenic genes in the absence of insulin. However, insulin was not required for LXRŒ± to modulate the phospholipid profile, or to suppress genes in the ER stress or inflammation pathways. These data show that insulin is required specifically for the lipogenic effects of LXRŒ± and that manipulation of the insulin signaling pathway could dissociate the beneficial effects of LXR on cholesterol efflux, inflammation, and ER stress from the negative effects on lipogenesis. 
This study compares the roles of ABCG1 and scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) singly or together in promoting net cellular cholesterol efflux to plasma HDL containing active LCAT. In transfected cells, SR-BI promoted free cholesterol efflux to HDL, but this was offset by an increased uptake of HDL cholesteryl ester (CE) into cells, resulting in no net efflux. Coexpression of SR-BI with ABCG1 inhibited the ABCG1-mediated net cholesterol efflux to HDL, apparently by promoting the reuptake of CE from medium. However, ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux was not altered in cholesterol-loaded, SR-BI-deficient (SR-BI(-/-)) macrophages. Briefly cultured macrophages collected from SR-BI(-/-) mice loaded with acetylated LDL in the peritoneal cavity did exhibit reduced efflux to HDL. However, this was attributable to reduced expression of ABCG1 and ABCA1, likely reflecting increased macrophage cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein E-enriched HDL during loading in SR-BI(-/-) mice. In conclusion, cellular SR-BI does not promote net cholesterol efflux from cells to plasma HDL containing active LCAT as a result of the reuptake of HDL-CE into cells. Previous findings of increased atherosclerosis in mice transplanted with SR-BI(-/-) bone marrow probably cannot be explained by a defect in macrophage cholesterol efflux.
The beneficial therapeutic effects of raising HDL cholesterol are proving difficult to confirm in humans. The evaluation of antiatherogenic functions of HDL is an important area of research which includes the role of HDL in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), especially macrophage-specific RCT, and its antioxidant and antiinflammatory roles. The antioxidant and antiinflammatory functions of HDL can be assessed using cell-free and cell-based assays. Also, a new approach was developed to measure RCT from labeled-cholesterol macrophages to liver and feces of mice. Studies in genetically engineered animals indicate that these major HDL antiatherogenic functions are better predictors of atherosclerosis susceptibility than HDL cholesterol or total RCT. Thus, functional testing of the antiatherogenic functions of HDL in experimental animal models may facilitate the development of new strategies for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis.
Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency is frequently associated with hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) in animal models and humans. We investigated the mechanism of HTG in the ldlr-/- x lcat-/- (double knockout (dko)) mice using the ldlr-/- x lcat+/+ (knock-out (ko)) littermates as control. Mean fasting triglyceride (TG) levels in the dko mice were elevated 1.75-fold compared with their controls (p &lt; 0.002). Both the very low density lipoprotein and the low density lipoprotein/intermediate density lipoprotein fractions separated by fast protein liquid chromatography were TG-enriched in the dko mice. In vitro lipolysis assay revealed that the dko mouse very low density lipoprotein (d &lt; 1.019 g/ml) fraction separated by ultracentrifugation was a more efficient substrate for lipolysis by exogenous bovine lipoprotein lipase. Post-heparin lipoprotein lipase activity was reduced by 61% in the dko mice. Hepatic TG production rate, determined after intravenous Triton WR1339 injection, was increased 8-fold in the dko mice. Hepatic mRNA levels of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (srebp-1) and its target genes acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1 (acc-1), fatty acid synthase (fas), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (scd-1) were significantly elevated in the dko mice compared with the ko control. The hepatic mRNA levels of LXRalpha (lxralpha) and its target genes including angiopoietin-like protein 3 (angptl-3) in the dko mice were unchanged. Fasting glucose and insulin levels were reduced by 31 and 42%, respectively in the dko mice, in conjunction with a 49% reduction in hepatic pepck-1 mRNA (p = 0.014). Both the HTG and the improved fasting glucose phenotype seen in the dko mice are at least in part attributable to an up-regulation of the hepatic srebp-1c gene.
Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) is a central regulator of lipogenesis whose activity is controlled by proteolytic cleavage. The metabolic factors that affect its processing are incompletely understood. Here, we show that dynamic changes in the acyl chain composition of ER phospholipids affect SREBP-1c maturation in physiology and disease. The abundance of polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine in liver ER is selectively increased in response to feeding and in the setting of obesity-linked insulin resistance. Exogenous delivery of polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine to ER accelerated SREBP-1c processing through a mechanism that required an intact SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) pathway. Furthermore, induction of the phospholipid-remodeling enzyme LPCAT3 in response to liver X receptor (LXR) activation promoted SREBP-1c processing by driving the incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids into ER. Conversely, LPCAT3 deficiency increased membrane saturation, reduced nuclear SREBP-1c abundance, and blunted the lipogenic response to feeding, LXR agonist treatment, or obesity-linked insulin resistance. Desaturation of the ER membrane may serve as an auxiliary signal of the fed state that promotes lipid synthesis in response to nutrient availability.
Atherosclerosis is a chronic disease characterized by the deposition of excessive cholesterol in the arterial intima. Macrophage foam cells play a critical role in the occurrence and development of atherosclerosis. The generation of these cells is associated with imbalance of cholesterol influx, esterification and efflux. CD36 and scavenger receptor class A (SR-A) are mainly responsible for uptake of lipoprotein-derived cholesterol by macrophages. Acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase-1 (ACAT1) and neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase (nCEH) regulate cholesterol esterification. ATP-binding cassette transporters A1(ABCA1), ABCG1 and scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) play crucial roles in macrophage cholesterol export. When inflow and esterification of cholesterol increase and/or its outflow decrease, the macrophages are ultimately transformed into lipid-laden foam cells, the prototypical cells in the atherosclerotic plaque. The aim of this review is to describe what is known about the mechanisms of cholesterol uptake, esterification and release in macrophages. An increased understanding of the process of macrophage foam cell formation will help to develop novel therapeutic interventions for atherosclerosis. 
Macrophages are central to the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis and thus can be very appropriate targets for therapy. Cell adhesion molecules mediating monocytes recruitment to the endothelium are attractive therapy targets and their inhibitors are in clinical trials. Macrophage scavenger receptors like SR-A and CD-36 mediate foam cell formation by facilitating the uptake of modified lipids. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), liver X receptor (LXR)-mediated signaling, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) induced phosphorylation events seem to play an important role in this phenomenon. Proteins affecting macrophage cholesterol metabolism and transport, including ATP-binding cassette (ABC) A1, ABCG1, acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), apolipoprotein A-1 (ApoA-1), neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase (NCEH) also regulate foam cell formation and are being developed as therapeutic targets by many pharmaceutical companies. Macrophage proliferation and apoptosis are important events controlling inflammatory response, plaque vulnerability, and destabilization. Free cholesterol (FC) activates the macrophage endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway and apoptosis. Free radicals and nitric oxide also modulate macrophage foam cell formation and apoptosis. Various antioxidants like AGI-1067 and BO-653 are in clinical trials for atherosclerosis treatment. Macrophage matrix metalloproteinase's (MMP's) play a significant role in weakening and rupture of plaques. Efforts are on to develop isoform specific MMP inhibitor. CD-14, MMP-3, ABCA1, Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4), lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1), arachidonate lipoxygenase-15 (ALOX-15), and Connexin37 polymorphisms and macrophage dysfunction signify their importance in atherosclerosis. Deciphering the role of macrophages in regulating dyslipidemia and inflammation during atherosclerosis is important for developing them as therapeutic targets.
Impaired cell cholesterol trafficking in Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease results in the first known instance of impaired regulation of the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), a lipid transporter mediating the rate-limiting step in high density lipoprotein (HDL) formation, as a cause of low plasma HDL-cholesterol in humans. We show here that treatment of human NPC1(-/-) fibroblasts with the liver X receptor (LXR) agonist TO-901317 increases ABCA1 expression and activity in human NPC1(-/-) fibroblasts, as indicated by near normalization of efflux of radiolabeled phosphatidylcholine and a marked increase in efflux of cholesterol mass to apoA-I. LXR agonist treatment prior to and during apoA-I incubation resulted in reduction in filipin staining of unesterified cholesterol in late endosomes/lysosomes, as well as cholesterol mass, in NPC1(-/-) cells. HDL species in human NPC disease plasma showed the same pattern of diminished large, cholesterol-rich alpha-1 HDL particles as seen in isolated heterozygous ABCA1 deficiency. Incubating NPC1(-/-) fibroblasts with the LXR agonist normalized the pattern of HDL particle formation by these cells. ABCG1, another LXR target gene involved in cholesterol efflux to HDL, also showed diminished expression in NPC1(-/-) fibroblasts and increased expression upon LXR agonist treatment. These results suggest that NPC1 mutations can be largely bypassed and that NPC1 protein function is non-essential for the trafficking and removal of cellular cholesterol if the down-stream defects in ABCA1 and ABCG1 regulation in NPC disease cells are corrected using an LXR agonist.
In Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease, cholesterol associated with either apoE or apoB100 is taken up by cells in all tissues, including the central nervous system, through clathrin-coated pits and becomes trapped in late endosomes and lysosomes. This study defines the functional, biochemical, and molecular events that ensue as nerve cell death occurs. In mice homozygous for a mutation in NPC1, neuromuscular dysfunction begins at 5 weeks and death occurs at 13 weeks of age. Cholesterol accumulates in every tissue in the body. Purkinje cell loss in the cerebellum begins at 3 to 4 weeks of age and is nearly complete by 11 weeks. This neurodegeneration in the cerebellum is associated with increases in the levels of mRNA for caspase 1, caspase 3, NPC2, LipA, apoE, apoD, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, but not for most target genes of the LXR nuclear receptors. The level for apoER2 is significantly reduced. These studies show there is a compensatory increase in NPC2 and LipA in an attempt to overcome the physiological defect caused by the mutation. Nevertheless, neurodegeneration proceeds utilizing apoptosis with activation of glial cells, increased apoE and apoD synthesis, and increased cholesterol turnover across the CNS.
The transport of lipids across mammary gland epithelial cells (MEC) determines milk lipid content and composition. We investigated the expression of lipid transporters and their regulators in comparison to blood metabolites during lactation and dry period (DP) in dairy cows. Repeated mammary gland biopsies and blood samples were taken from 10 animals at 7 stages of the pregnancy-lactation cycle. Expression levels of the specific mRNAs were determined by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, whereas ABCA1 was localized by immunohistochemistry. Blood serum metabolites were determined by common enzymatic chemistries. Elevated mRNA profiles of ABCA1 and ABCA7 were found during DP as compared with lactation and were inversely associated with blood cholesterol levels. Elevated levels of ABCG2, NPC1, SREBP1, SREBP2, LXR alpha, and PPAR gamma were found postpartum, whereas ABCG1 did not differ between the functional stages of the mammary gland. The ABCA1 protein was localized in MEC and showed differential activity between DP and lactation suggesting a role of ABCA1 in the removal of excess cellular cholesterol from MEC during the DP. The expression profiles of ABCA7 and NPC1 may reflect a role of these transporters in the clearance of apoptotic cells and the intracellular redistribution of cholesterol, respectively. Regulation of lipid transporters in the mammary gland is partially associated with transcription factors that control lipid homeostasis.
Cholesterol is an essential component of eukaryotic cell membranes with an important role in signal transduction. Although cholesterol can operate to auto-regulate its own disposal via gene transcriptional mechanisms, glucose also binds to the same cholesterol-binding transcription factors to regulate gene expression. Different sterol binding proteins bind different lipids to regulate both lipid homeostasis and antigen presentation. This mini-review examines the recently reported new functions of cholesterol binding proteins in cholesterol homeostasis, function and trafficking, and explores the molecular mechanisms whereby sterol sensors respond to glucose and other ligands to regulate diverse cellular functions in metabolism. Several new models are proposed from studies on a range of sterol binding proteins including Insig, SCAP, LXR, HMG-CoAR, NPC1 and NPC2.
Angiotensin II has been shown to exert complex effects on proximal tubular cell function and growth. To assess some of the direct effects on proximal tubular cells, changes in gene expression of selected cellular pathways were determined after exposure to angiotensin II. We used DNA microarrays to analyze multiple gene expression responses to increasing angiotensin II concentrations. Human proximal tubular cells were grown in flasks, and the presence of angiotensin type 1 receptor was confirmed by Western blot analysis. At passages 4-6, these cells were exposed to angiotensin II and harvested 4 h later and mRNA of the cells was extracted; 2 microg of mRNA was fluorescently conjugated for cDNA microarray hybridization. A custom-made DNA microarray was designed by selecting 300 human genes from 10 different functional systems and amplifying clones using polymerase chain reaction. Cells were subjected to 10 and 100 nM angiotensin II with paired untreated cells as controls. RNA was isolated, reverse transcribed, labeled and hybridized to the arrays and the ratios calculated. Ratios of &gt; or =2.0 and &lt; or =0.5 were considered significant. Coordinated changes were observed in genes of the hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 family (NHF3; HNF3A, HNF3B and HNF3G), in the E2F genes (E2F1, E2F3) and the interferon regulatory factors IRF1 and IRF5. Induction of the expression of transcription factors points towards complex regulation of gene expression upon angiotensin II exposure. Three genes involved in the dampening of oxidative stress were enhanced. Taken together, brief exposure of human tubular epithelial cells to angiotensin II elicited a marked induction of nuclear factors, antioxidant genes and hormones and hormone receptor genes. The quick activation of transcription factors by angiotensin II indicates that angiotensin II can directly initiate a cascade of expressional events in proximal tubular cells.
We have discovered two single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the 5' flanking region of the HFE gene. These mutations are -970 T--&gt;G and -467 C--&gt;G, numbering from the ATG start codon. When a T was present at -970, a C was always found at -467. The C allele was the less common at nt -467 with a gene frequency of 0.31 in white subjects with wild-type HFE. Slightly lower gene frequencies were observed in a small number of Hispanic and African-American subjects and a slightly higher frequency in a few Asian subjects. The less common -467 mutation was found in almost 12 chromosomes that bore the 845G--&gt;A (C282Y) mutation and was significantly more prevalent in chromosomes containing the 187C--&gt;G (H63D) mutation. Although this mutation is near an HNF3B/HFH2 site, its presence did not seem to affect iron metabolism as judged by the serum ferritin or transferrin saturation levels. The tighter association of the -467 polymorphism with the C282Y mutation is consistent with other data that suggest that the C282Y mutation has occurred relatively recently and that the H63D mutation is considerably older.
One known genetic mechanism for transient neonatal diabetes is loss of methylation at 6q24. The etiology of prune belly sequence is unknown but a genetic defect, affecting the mesoderm from which the triad abdominal muscle hypoplasia, urinary tract abnormalities, and cryptorchidism develop, has been suggested. We investigated a family, including one twin, with transient neonatal diabetes and prune belly sequence. Autoantibody tests excluded type 1 diabetes. Microsatellite marker analysis confirmed the twins being monozygotic. We identified no mutations in ZFP57, KCNJ11, ABCC8, GCK, HNF1A, HNF1B, HNF3B, IPF1, PAX4, or ZIC3. The proband had loss of methylation at the 6q24 locus TNDM and also at the loci IGF2R, DIRAS3, and PEG1, while the other family members, including the healthy monozygotic twin, had normal findings. The loss of methylation on chromosome 6q24 and elsewhere may indicate a generalized maternal hypomethylation syndrome, which accounts for both transient neonatal diabetes and prune belly sequence.
Mammalian tissue- and/or time-specific transcription is primarily regulated in a combinatorial fashion through interactions between a specific set of transcriptional regulatory factors (TRFs) and their cognate cis-regulatory elements located in the regulatory regions. In exploring the DNA regions and TRFs involved in combinatorial transcriptional regulation, we noted that individual knockdown of a set of human liver-enriched TRFs such as HNF1A, HNF3A, HNF3B, HNF3G and HNF4A resulted in perturbation of the expression of several single TRF genes, such as HNF1A, HNF3G and CEBPA genes. We thus searched the potential binding sites for these five TRFs in the highly conserved genomic regions around these three TRF genes and found several putative combinatorial regulatory regions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that almost all of the putative regulatory DNA regions were bound by the TRFs as well as two coactivators (CBP and p300). The strong transcription-enhancing activity of the putative combinatorial regulatory region located downstream of the CEBPA gene was confirmed. EMSA demonstrated specific bindings of these HNFs to the target DNA region. Finally, co-transfection reporter assays with various combinations of expression vectors for these HNF genes demonstrated the transcriptional activation of the CEBPA gene in a combinatorial manner by these TRFs.
Mutations in the transcription factors hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4alpha and -1alpha, insulin promoter factor-1, and HNF-1beta are the causes of four forms of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY1 and 3-5, respectively). The winged-helix transcription factor HNF-3beta has been implicated in the regulation of expression of each of these MODY genes, suggesting that mutations in the HNF-3beta gene (HNF3B) may also cause MODY. We have tested this hypothesis by screening a panel of 57 unrelated Japanese subjects with a clinical diagnosis of MODY for mutations in HNF3B. This analysis revealed four frequent polymorphisms that were not associated with MODY, including one in the promoter region (-213A/G), two silent mutations in the codons for Ala 97 (291C/T) and Gly 279 (837A/G), and one in the 3'-untranslated region (1424C/T). Two rare substitutions in the 5'-untranslated region, -156C/T and -67A/C, were found in a heterozygous state in two subjects, and two subjects were heterozygous for putative missense mutations, S109N (326G &gt; A) and A328V (983C&gt;T). The two missense mutations were not found in 106 normal chromosomes from nondiabetic subjects. It was not possible to test for co-segregation of these mutations with diabetes and thus, it is unclear whether or not these mutations can cause MODY. The results of our study suggest that mutations in HNF3B are not a common cause of MODY in Japanese subjects.
We cloned and characterized the mouse gene for microtubule-associated protein (MAP) 1A, an important protein for neuronal morphology and mitotic spindle formation. We also investigated the 5' untranslated region of the gene to characterize the promoter units. Two alternative transcripts different in the 5' region were identified by 5' RACE. Both transcripts were principally observed in the brain. Genomic cloning revealed that exons 1, 2, and 4 generate the 5' part of a long transcript, whereas exons 3 and 4 generate a short transcript. Putative 5' and intronic promoters flanking exons 1 and 3, respectively, are GC-rich and lack a canonical TATA box. DNase I footprinting from mouse cells revealed that several potential cis-elements were occupied by nuclear proteins. A reporter assay system in conjunction with a number of deletion and mutation constructs was used to test the two putative promoters. Both putative promoters showed transactivity and their function was dependent upon Sp1 sites. In addition, an NF-1 site, an HNF3B site, and an AP-1/ATF site were necessary for basal promoter activity of the intronic promoter. Our data provide insight into the regulatory mechanisms that govern the expression of the MAP1A gene.
Mutations in genes encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) are responsible for three of the five subtypes of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). This observation and molecular studies indicate that the HNF network is required for normal function of pancreatic beta-cells. This suggests that transcription factors involved in this complex network are candidates for genetic defects in MODY. Because the HNF-3beta gene is implicated in this network, we screened it for mutations in 21 probands of French ancestry with clinical diagnosis of MODY and early-onset type 2 diabetes. All of the five known MODY genes, HNF-4alpha, glucokinase, HNF-1alpha, HNF-1beta, and IPF1, were previously excluded as being the cause of diabetes in these families. By direct sequencing, we identified two transitions, an A-to-G at position -213 and a C-to-T at position -63 in the promoter and exon 1, respectively, of the HNF-3beta gene. A G-to-C transversion at position +32 in the intron 1 and three transitions, C-to-T at position 291, A-to-G at position 837, and G-to-A at position 1188 in the exon 3, resulting in noncoding mutations Ala97Ala, Gly279Gly, and Gln396Gln, respectively, were also identified. The allele frequencies were not significantly different between a control group and MODY probands. Familial segregation studies and linkage analysis showed that genetic variation in the HNF-3beta gene is unlikely to be the cause of early-onset type 2 diabetes in these Caucasian families.
Lung carcinoma is the most common and aggressive malignant tumor with poor clinical outcome. Identification of new marker of lung cancer is essential for the diagnosis and prognosis of the disease. To identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and find associated pathways that may function as targets of lung cancer. Gene expression profiling of GSE40791 were downloaded from GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus), including 100 normal specimens and 94 lung cancer samples. The DEGs were screened out by LIMMA package in R language. Besides, novel genes associated with lung cancer were identified by co-expression analysis. Then, GO enrichment and transcription binding site analysis were performed on these DEGs, and novel genes were predicted using DAVID. Finally, PPI network was constructed by String software in order to get the hub codes involved in cancer carcinoma. A total of 541 DEGs were filtered out between normal samples and patients with lung carcinoma, including 155 up-regulated genes and 386 down-regulated genes. Additionally, nine novel genes, CA4, CDC20, CHRDL1, DLGAP5, EMCN, GPM6A, NUSAP1, S1PR1 and TCF21, were figured out. The transcription biding site analysis showed that these genes were regulated by LHX3, HNF3B, CDP, HFH1, FOXO4, STAT, SOX5, MEF2, FOXO3 and SRY. Hub codes as BUB1B, MAD2L and TOP2A may play as target genes in lung carcinoma in the result of PPI network analysis. Newly predicted genes and hub codes can perform as target genes for diagnose and clinical therapy of lung cancer. 
Tracheo-oesophageal malformations result from disturbed foregut separation during early development. The notochord, a specialised embryonic structure, forms immediately adjacent to the dividing foregut. In the Adriamycin mouse model of oesophageal atresia, foregut and notochord abnormalities co-exist, and the site and severity of foregut malformations closely correlate to the position and extent of the notochord defects. Notochord and foregut abnormalities also co-exist in the Noggin Knockout mouse as well in a small number of human cases. The notochord is a source of powerful molecular signals during early embryogenesis, being particularly important for neural crest development. The influence of notochord signaling on the adjacent foregut is not known. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of notochord manipulation on foregut separation using a robust 3D explant method for culturing isolated foregut which permits oeosphageal and tracheal formation in vitro.
Foregut was micro-dissected from embryonic day 9 mice (License B100/4447 Irish Medicines Board), embedded in collagen and cultured for 48¬†h with native notochord intact (n¬†=¬†6), notochord removed (n¬†=¬†10) or additional notochord transplanted from stage matched controls (n¬†=¬†8). Specimens were analysed for foregut morphology and molecular patterning using immunohistochemistry for Hnf3b (an endoderm marker) and Sox2 (a notochord and oesophageal marker) on cryosections.
Foregut separation into distinct oesophagus and trachea was observed in isolated foregut specimens with or without their native notochord. In specimens with additional notochord transplants, foregut morphology and molecular patterning were comparable to controls whether or not the native notochord was maintained. In particular foregut separation was not disrupted by the transplantation of additional notochord at the dorsal foregut endoderm.
The relationship between the embryonic foregut and notochord is complex and ill-defined; however, the notochord does not contribute essentially to oesophagus and trachea formation beyond E9 in the mouse, and the transplantation of additional notochord does not disrupt foregut separation in 3D explant culture.
Severe shortage of liver donors and hepatocytes highlights urgent requirement of extra-liver and stem cell source of hepatocytes for treating liver-related diseases. Here we hypothesized that spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) can directly transdifferentiate to hepatic stem-like cells capable of differentiating into mature hepatocyte-like cells in vitro without an intervening pluripotent state.
SSCs first changed into hepatic stem-like cells since they resembled hepatic oval cells in morphology and expressed Ck8, Ck18, Ck7, Ck19, OV6, and albumin. Importantly, they co-expressed CK8 and CK19 but not ES cell markers. Hepatic stem-like cells derived from SSCs could differentiate into small hepatocytes based upon their morphological features and expression of numerous hepatic cell markers but lacking of bile epithelial cell hallmarks. Small hepatocytes were further coaxed to differentiate into mature hepatocyte-like cells, as identified by their morphological traits and strong expression of Ck8, Ck18, Cyp7a1, Hnf3b, Alb, Tat, Ttr, albumin, and CYP1A2 but not Ck7 or CK19. Notably, these differentiated cells acquired functional attributes of hepatocyte-like cells because they secreted albumin, synthesized urea, and uptake and released indocyanine green. Moreover, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Smad2/3 rather than Akt was activated in hepatic stem cells and mature hepatocytes. Additionally, cyclin A, cyclin B and cyclin E transcripts and proteins but not cyclin D1 or CDK1 and CDK2 transcripts or proteins were reduced in mature hepatocyte-like cells or hepatic stem-like cells derived from SSCs compared to SSCs.
SSCs can transdifferentiate to hepatic stem-like cells capable of differentiating into cells with morphological, phenotypic and functional characteristics of mature hepatocytes via the activation of ERK1/2 and Smad2/3 signaling pathways and the inactivation of cyclin A, cyclin B and cyclin E. This study thus provides an invaluable source of mature hepatocytes for treating liver-related diseases and drug toxicity screening and offers novel insights into mechanisms of liver development and cell reprogramming.
Death-associated protein kinase (DAPK), a mediator of apoptotic systems, is silenced by promoter hypermethylation in lung and breast tumors. This gene has a CpG island extending 2500 bp from the translational start site; however, studies characterizing its transcriptional regulation have not been conducted. Two transcripts for DAPK were identified that code for a single protein, while being regulated by two promoters. The previously identified DAPK transcript designated as exon 1 transcript was expressed at levels 3-fold greater than the alternate exon 1b transcript. Deletion constructs of promoter 1 identified a 332 bp region containing a functional CP2-binding site important for expression of the exon 1 transcript. While moderate reporter activity was seen in promoter 2, the region comprising intron 1 and containing a HNF3B-binding site sustained expression of the alternate transcript. Sequencing the DAPK CpG island in tumor cell lines revealed dense, but heterogenous methylation of CpGs that blocked access of the CP2 and HNF3B proteins that in turn, was associated with loss of transcription that was restored by treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Prevalences were similar for methylation of promoter 1 and 2 and intron 1 in lung tumors, but significantly greater in promoter 2 and intron 1 in breast tumors, indicative of tissue-specific differences in silencing these two transcripts. These studies show for the first time dual promoter regulation of DAPK, a tumor suppressor gene silenced in many cancers, and substantiate the importance of screening for silencing of both transcripts in tumors.
Growing evidence indicates that microRNAs have a significant role in tumor development and may constitute robust biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. In this study, we evaluated the clinical and functional relevance of microRNA-122 (miR-122) expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We report that miR-122 is specifically repressed in a subset of primary tumors that are characterized by poor prognosis. We further show that the loss of miR-122 expression in tumor cells segregates with specific gene expression profiles linked to cancer progression, namely the suppression of hepatic phenotype and the acquisition of invasive properties. We identify liver-enriched transcription factors as central regulatory molecules in the gene networks associated with loss of miR-122, and provide evidence suggesting that miR-122 is under the transcriptional control of HNF1A, HNF3A and HNF3B. We further show that loss of miR-122 results in an increase of cell migration and invasion and that restoration of miR-122 reverses this phenotype. In conclusion, miR-122 is a marker of hepatocyte-specific differentiation and an important determinant in the control of cell migration and invasion. From a clinical point of view, our study emphasizes miR-122 as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for HCC progression.
Stimulation of BxPC-3, Panc-1, and MIA PaCA-2 pancreatic cancer cells with EGF, HGF, FGF-1, FGF-2, FGF-7, and FGF-10 growth factors caused changes in the expression of master genes regulating pancreatic development (SOX9, HNF3b, GATA-4, GATA-6, and HES1). This, in turn, caused changes in the expression profile of important transcription factors, embryonic development regulators. It was also found that the master genes belonging to the same family may cause opposite effects (suppression or enhancement of expression of a particular transcriptional regulator) in the same cell line.
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have a great potential for application in patient-specific therapy. The reprogramming method that does not involve c-Myc reduces tumorigenic risk, but also largely reduces the efficiency of generation of iPSCs, especially for those reprogrammed from damaged cells. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (Parp1) catalyzes a reaction of poly(ADP-ribosylation) and has been reported to enhance cell reprogramming.
Using Oct-4/Sox2/Klf4/Parp1 (OSKP) reprogramming method, reprogramming factors plus Parp1 were capable of generation of iPSCs from adult fibroblasts and further toward to differentiate from iPSCs status into hepatocyte-like cells.
Our results showed that Oct-4/Sox2/Klf4/Parp1 (OSKP)-derived iPSC exhibited regular pluripotent properties, long-term passages and more stable cellular-divided period. These OSKP-derived iPSCs can effectively differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells (OSKP-iPSC-Heps), and present high mRNA levels of Sox17, HNF3b, and HNF4a in OSKP-iPSC-Heps. The mature hepatic functions, including CYP3A4, LDL uptake, glycogen synthesis and urea secretion were analyzed and well detected in OSKP-iPSC-Heps on day 14 post-differentiation.
In conclusion, we demonstrated that Parp1 promoted reprogramming process to generate the high quality of iPSCs, which could be used as a high quality source of hepatocytes.
UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) are important phase II drug metabolism enzymes. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between age and changes in mRNA expression and activity of major human hepatic UGTs, as well as to understand the potential regulatory mechanism underlying this relationship. Using previously generated data, we investigated age-dependent mRNA expression levels of 11 hepatic UGTs (UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A4, UGT1A5, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, UGT2B4, UGT2B7, UGT2B10, UGT2B15, and UGT2B17) and 16 transcription factors (AHR, AR, CAR, ESR2, FXR, GCCR, HNF1a, HNF3a, HNF3b, HNF4a, PPARA, PPARG, PPARGC, PXR, SP1, and STAT3) in liver tissue of donors (n = 38) ranging from 0 to 25 years of age. We also examined the correlation between age and microsomal activities using 14 known UGT drug substrates in the liver samples (n = 19) of children donors. We found a statistically significant increase (nominal p &lt; 0.05) in the expression of UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A4, UGT1A5, UGT1A6, UGT2B7, and UGT2B17, as well as glucuronidation activities of serotonin, testosterone, and vorinostat during the first 25 years of life. Expression of estrogen receptor 1 and pregnane X receptor, two strong UGT transcriptional regulators, were significantly correlated with both age and UGT mRNA expression (p ‚â§ 0.05). These results suggest that both UGT expression and activity increase during childhood and adolescence, possibly driven in part by hormonal signaling. Our findings may help explain inter-patient variability in response to medications among children.
Atherosclerosis is a multifaceted inflammatory disease involving cells in the vascular wall (eg, endothelial cells [ECs]), as well as circulating and resident immunogenic cells (eg, monocytes/macrophages). Acting as a ligand for liver X receptor (LXR), but an inhibitor of SREBP2 (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2), 25-hydroxycholesterol, and its catalyzing enzyme cholesterol-25-hydroxylase (Ch25h) are important in regulating cellular inflammatory status and cholesterol biosynthesis in both ECs and monocytes/macrophages.
Bioinformatic analyses were used to investigate RNA-sequencing data to identify cholesterol oxidation and efflux genes regulated by Kr√ºppel-like factor 4 (KLF4). In vitro experiments involving cultured ECs and macrophages and in vivo methods involving mice with Ch25h ablation were then used to explore the atheroprotective role of KLF4-Ch25h/LXR.
Vasoprotective stimuli increased the expression of Ch25h and LXR via KLF4. The KLF4-Ch25h/LXR homeostatic axis functions through suppressing inflammation, evidenced by the reduction of inflammasome activity in ECs and the promotion of M1 to M2 phenotypic transition in macrophages. The increased atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-/-/Ch25h-/- mice further demonstrates the beneficial role of the KLF4-Ch25h/LXR axis in vascular function and disease.
KLF4 transactivates Ch25h and LXR, thereby promoting the synergistic effects between ECs and macrophages to protect against atherosclerosis susceptibility.
Liver X receptors (LXR) play an integral role in cholesterol metabolism and the inflammatory response. High-fat (HF) diets and microbial infection can antagonize the LXR pathway leading to accumulation of cholesteryl-esters (CE) and increased expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in macrophages. The probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus paracasei possesses cholesterol lowering and immune modulating properties. Therefore, the present study sought to model whether daily feeding of L. paracasei to juvenile Ossabaw pigs fed a HF diet could modulate cholesterol metabolism and the LXR/inflammatory axis in lipopolysacharide (LPS)-stimulated alveolar macrophages (AM). The results showed that AM from pigs fed a HF diet had significantly higher concentrations of CE compared to AM from pigs fed a control (C) diet, but not in pigs fed a HF diet with L. paracasei (HFPB). Ex vivo LPS stimulation of AM opposed LXR agonist-mediated transcription of cholesterol metabolism related genes: ABCA1, CH25H and PPARŒ≥ in pigs on the C diet, and LXRŒ±, ABCA1, ABCG1, CH25H and PPARŒ≥ in pigs on the HF diet. This effect was abrogated for all these genes except LXRŒ± in AM from pigs given L. paracasei. Protein analysis of culture supernatants revealed that AM from HFPB-fed pigs had significantly lower LPS-induced protein expression of IL-1Œ≤ than AM from HF-fed pigs. Moreover, AM from pigs fed the C diet and given L. paracasei, had significantly higher mRNA levels of IL-8, and IL-6, in response to LPS. These data demonstrated a role for L. paracasei in modulating AM cholesterol metabolism and the response to LPS. 
X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), caused by an ABCD1 mutation, is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with the accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA). Cerebral inflammatory demyelination is the major feature of childhood cerebral ALD (CCALD), the most severe form of ALD, but its underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we identify the aberrant production of cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) and 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) in the cellular context of CCALD based on the analysis of ALD patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells and ex vivo fibroblasts. Intriguingly, 25-HC, but not VLCFA, promotes robust NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation via potassium efflux-, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS)- and liver X receptor (LXR)-mediated pathways. Furthermore, stereotaxic injection of 25-HC into the corpus callosum of mouse brains induces microglial recruitment, interleukin-1Œ≤ production, and oligodendrocyte cell death in an NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent manner. Collectively, our results indicate that 25-HC mediates the neuroinflammation of X-ALD via activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.
Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) catalyzes the production of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC), an oxysterol that can play an important role in different biological processes. However, the mechanisms regulating CH25H expression have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we determined that CH25H is highly expressed in mouse liver and peritoneal macrophages. We identified several liver X receptor (LXR) response elements (LXREs) in the human CH25H promoter. In HepG2 cells, activation of LXR by 25-HC or other oxysterols and synthetic ligands [T0901317 (T317) and GW3965] induced CH25H protein expression, which was associated with increased CH25H mRNA expression. 25-HC or T317 activated CH25H transcription in an LXRE-dependent manner. Thus, high-expressing LXRŒ± or LXRŒ≤ activated CH25H expression, and the activation was further enhanced by LXR ligands. In contrast, inhibition of LXRŒ±/Œ≤ expression attenuated 25-HC or T317-induced CH25H expression. Deficiency of interferon Œ≥ expression reduced, but did not block, LXR ligand-induced hepatic CH25H expression. Activation of LXR also substantially induced macrophage CH25H expression. In vivo, administration of GW3965 to mice increased CH25H expression in both liver and peritoneal macrophages. Taken together, our study demonstrates that 25-HC can activate CH25H expression in an LXR-dependent manner, which may be an important mechanism to exert the biological actions of 25-HC.
High-density lipoproteins (HDL) are considered atheroprotective in contrast to low-density lipoproteins (LDL), which are atherogenic in their oxidized form. A growing body of evidence suggests that HDL exert part of their antiatherogenic effect by counteracting LDL oxidation as well as their proinflammatory effect. However, a number of studies, carried over the past 30 years, have shown that cholesterol efflux plays a major role in the atheroprotective effects of HDL and cholesterol homeostasis. These studies have further identified the scavenger receptor type B-I (SR-BI), the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporters ATP-binding cassette subfamily A1 (ABCA1), ATP-binding cassette subfamily G1 (ABCG1) and ABCG4, the liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor (LXR/RXR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptorgamma(PPAR gamma) transcription factors, the HDL components apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), and phospholipids as additional mediators of cholesterol transport. Cholesterol efflux occurs via three independent pathways: (1) aqueous diffusion, (2) nonspecific efflux via SR-BI receptors, and (3) specific efflux via cholesterol-responsive members of the ABC superfamily. Whereas aqueous diffusion and scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI)-mediated efflux transport free cholesterol to a wide variety of cholesterol acceptors (particles containing phospholipids, HDL, and lipidated apo-lipoproteins; LDL, etc), the ABCA1 pathway mediates the transport of cholesterol in a unidirectional manner, mainly to lipid-poor apoA-I. In contrast, the ABCG1 pathway is responsible for the transport of cholesterol to all the subfamily members of HDL. Although HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux is apoA-I-dependent, recent studies have suggested an involvement of the enzyme paraoxonase 1 (PON1). Cholesterol efflux is carried on by a number of factors such as genetic mutations, smoking, stress, and high-fat diets. It is attenuated with aging due to changes in the composition and structure of HDL, especially the phosphatidylcholine/sphingomyelin ratio, the fluidity of the phospholipidic layer, the concentration of apoA-I, and the activity of PON1. This review summarizes the findings that cholesterol homeostasis is disrupted with aging as a consequence of dysfunctional cholesterol efflux and the impairment of physiological functions.
Chronic renal failure (CRF) causes oxidative stress, inflammation, oxidation of lipoproteins, impaired maturation of HDL and accelerated atherosclerosis. Uptake of oxidized lipoproteins by macrophages via scavenger receptors (scavenger receptor class A type I--SR-AI, and lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor--LOX-1) leads to foam cell formation and atherosclerosis. HDL mitigates atherosclerosis by retrieving surplus cholesterol via ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and ABCG1 transporters whose expression is regulated by liver X receptor (LXR). Free cholesterol reaching the surface of HDL is esterified by lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) and sequestered in the core of HDL, thereby maximizing cholesterol uptake. In the liver, lipid-rich HDL unloads its lipid contents via reversible binding to SR-BI while lipid-poor HDL is degraded by the holo-receptor (ATP synthase beta-chain).
Expression of the above molecules involved in reverse cholesterol/lipid transport was assessed in rats 8 weeks after 5/6 nephrectomy (CRF) or sham operation.
CRF caused heavy accumulation of neutral lipids, upregulation of SR-AI, LOX-1, LXRalpha/beta, ABCA1 and ABCG1 in the aorta, reduction in LCAT in the plasma and no significant change in either SR-BI or beta-chain ATP synthase in the liver.
Lipid accumulation despite upregulation of the efflux (LXR, ABCA1, ABCG1) system in the aorta in CRF is largely due to upregulation of influx (SR-AI and LOX-1) pathway and LCAT deficiency.
We are continuing to both elucidate underlying mechanisms and identify clinical applications for a chemically induced murine model of dose-controlled hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. This murine model neither utilizes genetically modified mice nor a high-fat, cholate-containing diet, although simultaneous ingestion of a high-fat, cholate-enriched diet potentiates the hyperlipidemic response and the number and size of aortic atherosclerotic lesions formed in C57BL/6 mice. The chemical agent used to induce hyperlipidemia is poloxamer 407 (P-407), a nonionic surface-active-agent. To date, we have investigated the effect of P-407 on the biologic activity of a variety of key enzymes involved with lipid metabolism and transport. These enzymes include 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), cholesterol 7alpha-hydoxylase (C7alphaH), sterol 27-hydroxylase (S27H), lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), cholesteryl-ester-transfer-protein (CETP), hepatic lipase (HL), and endothelial lipase (EL). P-407 directly inhibits the heparin-releasable fraction of LPL and HL and indirectly increases the biologic activity of CETP and LCAT. Long-term (&gt; 4 months) administration of P-407 to C57BL/6 mice appears to have no effect on the biologic activity of S27H and HMG-CoA reductase, but decreases the activity of C7alphaH. This would suggest that hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia result from inhibition of LPL and C7alphaH, respectively, while the biologic activity of CETP and LCAT are indirectly increased to compensate for the increased cholesterol burden. The above model has proven useful for predicting the therapeutic efficacy of existing and possibly newer statin drugs, as well as evaluating the potential of one statin drug (atorvastatin calcium) to cause the regression of P-407-induced atherosclerotic lesions in mice. The P-407-induced murine model of atherogenesis represents an alternative to the use of either genetically modified or diet-induced models and may also prove beneficial for the evaluation of newer classes of antihyperlipidemic agents such as antioxidants, CETP inhibitors, and liver X receptor (LXR) agonists.
Current lipid-altering agents that lower low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) primarily through increased hepatic LDL receptor activity include statins, bile acid sequestrants/resins and cholesterol absorption inhibitors such as ezetimibe, plant stanols/sterols, polyphenols, as well as nutraceuticals such as oat bran, psyllium and soy proteins; those currently in development include newer statins, phytostanol analogues, squalene synthase inhibitors, bile acid transport inhibitors and SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) activating ligands. Other current agents that affect lipid metabolism include nicotinic acid (niacin), acipimox, high-dose fish oils, antioxidants and policosanol, whilst those in development include microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) inhibitors, acylcoenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibitors, gemcabene, lifibrol, pantothenic acid analogues, nicotinic acid-receptor agonists, anti-inflammatory agents (such as Lp-PLA(2) antagonists and AGI1067) and functional oils. Current agents that affect nuclear receptors include PPAR-alpha and -gamma agonists, while in development are newer PPAR-alpha, -gamma and -delta agonists, as well as dual PPAR-alpha/gamma and 'pan' PPAR-alpha/gamma/delta agonists. Liver X receptor (LXR), farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and sterol-regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) are also nuclear receptor targets of investigational agents. Agents in development also may affect high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) blood levels or flux and include cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors (such as torcetrapib), CETP vaccines, various HDL 'therapies' and upregulators of ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC) A1, lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) and scavenger receptor class B Type 1 (SRB1), as well as synthetic apolipoprotein (Apo)E-related peptides. Fixed-dose combination lipid-altering drugs are currently available such as extended-release niacin/lovastatin, whilst atorvastatin/amlodipine, ezetimibe/simvastatin, atorvastatin/CETP inhibitor, statin/PPAR agonist, extended-release niacin/simvastatin and pravastatin/aspirin are under development. Finally, current and future lipid-altering drugs may include anti-obesity agents which could favourably affect lipid levels.
Numerous epidemiological studies have demonstrated the atheroprotective roles of high density lipoproteins (HDL), so that HDL is established as an independent negative risk factor. The protective effect of HDL against atherosclerosis is mainly attributed to their capacity to bring peripheral excess cholesterol back to the liver for further elimination into the bile. In addition, HDL can exert other protective functions on the vascular wall, through their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antithrombotic and cytoprotective properties. HDL-targeted therapy is thus an innovative approach against cardiovascular risk and atherosclerosis. These pleiotropic atheroprotective properties of HDL have led experts to believe that "HDL-related therapies" represent the most promising next step in fighting against atherosclerosis. However, because of the heterogeneity of HDL functions, targeting HDL is not a simple task and HDL therapies that lower cardiovascular risk are NOT yet available. In this paper, an overview is presented about the therapeutic strategies currently under consideration to raise HDL levels and/or functions. Recently, clinical trials of drugs targeting HDL-C levels have disappointingly failed, suggesting that HDL functions through specific mechanisms should be targeted rather than increasing per se HDL levels. 
Coconut oil has gained in popularity over recent years as a healthy oil due to its potential cardiovascular benefits. Coconut oil contains medium chain triglycerides (MCT) including lauric acid and capric acid that display beneficial properties in human health. Licorice ( Glycyrrhiza uralensis) is used as a sweetener and in traditional Chinese medicine with anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant activities. This study investigated the in vivo effects of medium chain-triglycerides (MCT)-coconut oil (MCO) and its combination with licorice extract (LE-MCO) on serum lipid profile, hepatic steatosis, and local fat pad proteins in diet-induced obese mice. No liver toxicity was observed in 45% fat diet (HFD)-fed mice orally treated with LE, MCO, and LE-MCO for 12 weeks. Their supplementation reduced HFD-enhanced body weight, blood glucose, and insulin in mice. Plasma levels of both PLTP and LCAT were boosted in LE-MCO-administered mice. Supplementation of LE-MCO diminished plasma levels of TG and TC with concomitant reduction of the LDL-C level and tended to raise blood HDL-C level compared to that of HFD alone-mice. Treatment of LE-MCO encumbered the hepatic induction of hepatosteatosis-related proteins of SREBP2, SREBP1c, FAS, ACC, and CD36 in HFD-fed mice. Substantial suppression of this induction was also observed in the liver of mice treated with MCO. Oral administration of LE-MCO to HFD mice boosted hepatic activation of AMPK and the induction of UCP-1 and FATP1 in brown fat. Conversely, LE-MCO disturbed hepatic PPAR-LXR-RXR signaling in HFD-fed animals and reversed HFD-elevated epididymal PPARŒ≥. Collectively, oral administration of LE-MCO may impede hyperlipidemia and hepatosteatosis through curtailing hepatic lipid synthesis.
Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) is a liver-specific, intramitochondrial, rate-limiting enzyme in the urea cycle. A previous study showed that CPS1 is the antigen for hepatocyte paraffin 1 antibody, a commonly used antibody in surgical pathology practice; and CPS1 expression appears to be down-regulated in liver cancer tissue and cell lines. The aim of this study is to understand how the CPS1 gene is regulated in liver carcinogenesis. In this report, we show that human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells do not express CPS1, whereas cultured human primary hepatocytes express abundant levels. In addition, CPS1 was silenced or down-regulated in liver tumor tissues compared with the matched noncancerous tissues. The expression of CPS1 in HCC cells was restored with a demethylation agent, 5-azacytidine. We show that two CpG dinucleotides, located near the transcription start site, and a CpG-rich region in the first intron were hypermethylated in HCC cells. The hypermethylation of the two CpG dinucleotides was also detected in HCC tumor tissues compared with noncancerous tissues. Further molecular analysis with mutagenesis indicated that the two CpG dinucleotides play a role in promoter activity of the CPS1 gene. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that DNA methylation is a key mechanism of silencing CPS1 expression in human HCC cells, and CPS1 gene hypermethylation of the two CpG dinucleotides is a potential biomarker for HCC.
On the basis of their self-renewal capacity and their ability to differentiate into derivatives of all three germ layers, germ line-derived multipotent adult stem cells (maGSCs) from mouse testis might serve as one of preferable sources for pluripotent stem cells in regenerative medicine. In our study, we aimed for an efficient hepatic differentiation protocol that is applicable for both maGSCs and embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We attempted to accomplish this goal by using a new established co-culture system with OP9 stroma cells for direct differentiation of maGSCs and ESCs into hepatic cells. We found that the hepatic differentiation of maGSCs was induced by the OP9 co-culture system in comparison to the gelatin culture. Furthermore, we showed that the combination of OP9 co-culture with activin A resulted in the increased expression of endodermal and early hepatic markers Gata4, Sox17, Foxa2, Hnf4, Afp, and Ttr compared to differentiated cells on gelatin or on OP9 alone. Moreover, the hepatic progenitors were capable of differentiating further into mature hepatic cells, demonstrated by the expression of liver-specific markers Aat, Alb, Tdo2, Krt18, Krt8, Krt19, Cps1, Sek, Cyp7a1, Otc, and Pah. A high percentage of maGSC-derived hepatic progenitors (51% AFP- and 61% DLK1-positive) and mature hepatic-like cells (26% ALB-positive) were achieved using this OP9 co-culture system. These generated hepatic cells successfully demonstrated in vitro functions associated with mature hepatocytes, including albumin and urea secretion, glycogen storage, and uptake of low-density lipoprotein. The established co-culture system for maGSCs into functional hepatic cells might serve as a suitable model to delineate the differentiation process for the generation of high numbers of mature hepatocytes in humans without genetic manipulations and make germ line-derived stem cells a potential autologous and alternative cell source for hepatic transplants in metabolic liver disorders.
Atherosclerosis attracts increasing global attention because of its morbidity and mortality. G004, as a synthetic sulfonylurea compound, has been confirmed to have anti-hyperglycaemia, anti-platelet and anti-thrombus effects. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether G004 suppress the onset and development of atherosclerosis and illuminate its probable mechanism of action. ApoE-/- mice that were fed a high-fat diet were randomly divided into five groups by weight; subsequently, they were treated with vehicle, G004, at different doses or atorvastatin once daily for 12weeks. Meanwhile, C57BL/6 mice with the same diet served as the normal controls. Then, the serum lipid profiles and histopathological damage to the liver, kidney, aortic arch and aortic root were analysed. The activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and levels of inflammatory markers were detected. Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) was assessed in vivo by intraperitoneal injection of RAW264.7 cells that were radiolabelled with 3H-cholesterol. The results indicated that G004 ameliorated the serum lipid accumulation, atherosclerotic lesions and liver steatosis. Additionally, this compound increased the expression of SIRT1 and eNOS as well as the phosphorylation and deacetylation of eNOS in the aorta, alleviating the inflammatory state. RCT was promoted in ApoE-/- mice, which was accompanied by increased expression of SIRT1/LXRŒ±/ABCA1/G1 in the liver, and similar results appeared in the cholesterol efflux assay in RAW264.7 cells. The results provide a strong rationale for G004 to be an efficient anti-atherosclerosis agent that improved vascular endothelial dysfunction by stimulating SIRT1/eNOS and promoted RCT by stimulating SIRT1/LXRŒ±/ABCA1/G1.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a rapidly emerging global health-problem. NAFLD encompasses a range of conditions associated with hepatic steatosis, aberrant accumulation of fat in hepatocytes. Although obesity and metabolic syndrome are considered to have a strong association with NAFLD, genetic factors that predispose liver to NAFLD and molecular mechanisms by which excess hepatic lipid develops remain largely unknown. We report that the transcription cofactor CRTC1 confers broad spectrum protection against hepatic steatosis development. CRTC1 directly interferes with the expression of genes regulated by lipogenic transcription factors, most prominently liver x receptor Œ± (LXRŒ±). Accordingly, Crtc1 deficient mice develop spontaneous hepatic steatosis in young age. As a cyclic AMP effector, CRTC1 mediates anti-steatotic effects of calorie restriction (CR). Notably, CRTC1 also mediates anti-lipogenic effects of bile acid signaling, whereas it is negatively regulated by miR-34a, a pathogenic microRNA upregulated in a broad spectrum of NAFLD. These patterns of gene function and regulation of CRTC1 are distinct from other CR-responsive proteins, highlighting critical protective roles that CRTC1 selectively plays against NAFLD development, which in turn provides novel opportunities for selectively targeting beneficial therapeutic effects of CR.
To explore the large-scale effect of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Œ≥ (PPARG) in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMEC), an oligonucleotide microarray platform was used for transcriptome profiling in cells overexpressing PPARG and incubated with or without rosiglitazone (ROSI, a PPARŒ≥ agonist). A total of 1143 differentially expressed genes (DEG) due to treatment were detected. The Dynamic Impact Approach (DIA) analysis uncovered the most impacted and induced pathways "fatty acid elongation in mitochondria," "glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis-keratan sulfate," and "pentose phosphate pathway." The data highlights the central role of PPARG in milk fatty acid metabolism via controlling fatty acid elongation, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acid, lipid formation, and lipid secretion; furthermore, its role related to carbohydrate metabolism promotes the production of intermediates required for milk fat synthesis. Analysis of upstream regulators indicated that PPARG participates in multiple physiological processes via controlling or cross talking with other key transcription factors such as PPARD and NR1H3 (also known as liver-X-receptor-Œ±). This transcriptome-wide analysis represents the first attempt to better understand the biological relevance of PPARG expression in ruminant mammary cells. Overall, the data underscored the importance of PPARG in mammary lipid metabolism and transcription factor control.
Identifying rare genetic variants that drive the onset of disease is challenging, even before considering the additional genetic and environmental influences that likely exist in complex diseases. We recently published a study proposing a rare variant in the NR1H3 gene (p.R415Q, rs61731956) as responsible for the onset of multiple sclerosis (MS) in two multi-incident families (Wang et¬†al., 2016). This publication has generated much discussion, and fortunately the possibility to validate a finding or prove it spurious can occur rapidly in genetic studies. All novel discoveries must be replicated, and best efforts should be made to ensure that these replications use the appropriate samples and approach, and provide the correct interpretation of the results. This Matters Arising Response paper addresses the Minikel and MacArthur (2016) and The International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium (2016) Matters Arising papers, published concurrently in Neuron.
It has recently been reported that an NR1H3 missense variant, R415Q, causes a novel familial form of multiple sclerosis (Wang et¬†al., 2016a). This claim is at odds with publicly available data from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC; http://exac.broadinstitute.org). The allele frequency of R415Q is not significantly higher in cases (0.024%-0.049%) than in ExAC population controls (0.031%), whereas if R415Q conferred even 50% lifetime risk of developing MS, it would be hundreds of times more common in cases than in controls. The upper bound of the 95% confidence interval of penetrance for R415Q can be estimated at 2.2% for women and 1.2% for men, indicating that even if this variant is disease associated, individuals harboring the variant would have a lifetime risk of developing MS no higher than a few percent. ExAC data should be considered when evaluating claims of variant pathogenicity. This Matters Arising paper is in response to Wang et¬†al. (2016a), published in Neuron. See also the related Matters Arising paper by The International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium (2016) and the response by Wang et¬†al. (2016b), published in this issue.
A recent study by Wang et¬†al. (2016a) claims that the low-frequency variant NR1H3 p.Arg415Gln is sufficient to cause multiple sclerosis in certain individuals and determines a patient's likelihood of primary progressive disease. We sought to replicate this finding in the International MS Genetics Consortium (IMSGC) patient collection, which is 13-fold larger than the collection of Wang et¬†al. (2016a), but we find no evidence that this variant is associated with either MS or disease subtype. Wang et¬†al. (2016a) also report a common variant association in the region, which we show captures the association the IMSGC reported in 2013. Therefore, we conclude that the reported low-frequency association is a false positive, likely generated by insufficient sample size. The claim of NR1H3 mutations describing a Mendelian form of MS-of which no examples exist-can therefore not be substantiated by data. This Matters Arising paper is in response to Wang et¬†al. (2016a), published in Neuron. See also the related Matters Arising paper by Minikel and MacArthur (2016) and the response by Wang et¬†al. (2016b), published in this issue.
The liver X receptor (LXR) functions as a receptor for oxysterols and plays a critical role in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. We recently described a synthetic LXR inverse agonist that displayed efficacy in treatment of hepatic steatosis in a mouse model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This compound, SR9238, was designed to display liver specificity so as to avoid potential detrimental effects on reverse cholesterol transport in peripheral tissues. Here, we examined the effects of a LXR antagonist/inverse agonist, GSK2033, which displays systemic exposure. Although GSK2033 performed as expected in cell-based models as a LXR inverse agonist, it displayed unexpected activity in the mouse NAFLD model. The expression of lipogenic enzyme genes such as fatty acid synthase and sterol regulatory binding protein 1c were induced rather than suppressed and no effect on hepatic steatosis was found. Further characterization of the specificity of GSK2033 revealed that it displayed a significant degree of promiscuity, targeting a number of other nuclear receptors that could clearly alter hepatic gene expression.
The apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is the most highly associated susceptibility locus for late onset Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and augmenting the beneficial physiological functions of apoE is a proposed therapeutic strategy. In a high throughput phenotypic screen for small molecules that enhance apoE secretion from human CCF-STTG1 astrocytoma cells, we show the chrysanthemic ester 82879 robustly increases expressed apoE up to 9.4-fold and secreted apoE up to 6-fold and is associated with increased total cholesterol in conditioned media. Compound 82879 is unique as structural analogues, including pyrethroid esters, show no effect on apoE expression or secretion. 82879 also stimulates liver x receptor (LXR) target genes including ATP binding cassette A1 (ABCA1), LXRŒ± and inducible degrader of low density lipoprotein receptor (IDOL) at both mRNA and protein levels. In particular, the lipid transporter ABCA1 was increased by up to 10.6-fold upon 82879 treatment. The findings from CCF-STTG1 cells were confirmed in primary human astrocytes from three donors, where increased apoE and ABCA1 was observed along with elevated secretion of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-like apoE particles. Nuclear receptor transactivation assays revealed modest direct LXR agonism by compound 82879, yet 10 ŒºM of 82879 significantly upregulated apoE mRNA in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) depleted of both LXRŒ± and LXRŒ≤, demonstrating that 82879 can also induce apoE expression independent of LXR transactivation. By contrast, deletion of LXRs in MEFs completely blocked mRNA changes in ABCA1 even at 10 ŒºM of 82879, indicating the ability of 82879 to stimulate ABCA1 expression is entirely dependent on LXR transactivation. Taken together, compound 82879 is a novel chrysanthemic ester capable of modulating apoE secretion as well as apoE-associated lipid metabolic pathways in astrocytes, which is structurally and mechanistically distinct from known LXR agonists. 
The objective of this study was to study how changing the ratio of Lys to Thr, Lys to His, and Lys to Val affects the expression of lipogenic genes and microRNA (miRNA) in bovine mammary epithelial cells.
Triplicate cultures with the respective "optimal" amino acid (AA) ratio (OPAA‚Äâ=‚ÄâLys:Met 2.9:1; Thr:Phe 1.05:1; Lys:Thr 1.8:1; Lys:His 2.38:1; Lys:Val 1.23:1) plus rapamycin (OPAARMC; positive control), OPAA, Lys:Thr 2.1:1 (LT2.1), Lys:Thr 1.3:1 (LT1.3), Lys:His 3.05:1 (LH3.0), or Lys:Val 1.62:1 (LV1.6) were incubated in lactogenic medium for 12¬†h. The expression of 15 lipogenic genes and 7 miRNA were evaluated. Responses to LT2.1, LT1.3, LH3.0, and LV1.6 relative to the control (OPAARMC) included up-regulated expression of ACSS2, FABP3, ACACA, FASN, SCD, LPIN1, INSIG1, SREBF1, PPARD, and NR1H3 (commonly known as LXR-Œ±). Furthermore, LV1.6 up-regulated expression of ACSL1, DGAT1, and RXRA and down-regulated PPARG expression. Although no effect of OPAA on expression of PPARG was observed, compared with the control, OPAA up-regulated expression of the PPAR targets ACSS2, FABP3, ACACA, FASN, SCD, LPIN1, INSIG1, and SREBF1. Compared with the control, the expression of the anti-lipogenic MIR27AB was down-regulated by OPAA, LT2.1, LT1.3 and LH3.0. In contrast, compared with the control, the expression of the pro-lipogenic MIR21 was up-regulated by LT2.1, LT1.3, LH3.0, and LV1.6.
The observed up-regulation of lipogenic gene networks and the changes in expression of key miRNA involved in the control of lipogenic balance are indicative of a potentially important role of EAA ratios and mTOR signaling in the regulation of milk fat synthesis.
Liver X Receptor (LXR) modulators have shown potential as drugs since they target genes affecting metabolism and fatty acid synthesis. LXR antagonists are of particular interest since they are able to reduce the synthesis of complex fatty acids and glucose uptake. Based on molecular modeling, five new cholesterol mimics were synthesized, where four contained a hydroxyl group in the 22-S-position. The new compounds were screened in vitro against several genes affecting lipid metabolism. The compound that performed best in vitro was a dimethylamide derivative of 22(S)-hydroxycholesterol and it was chosen for in vivo testing. However, the blood plasma analysis from the in vivo tests revealed a concentration lower than needed to give any response, indicating either rapid metabolism or low bioavailability.
Cellular mechanisms that mediate steatohepatitis, an increasingly prevalent condition in the Western world for which no therapies are available, are poorly understood. Despite the fact that its synthetic agonists induce fatty liver, the liver X receptor (LXR) transcription factor remains a target of interest because of its anti-atherogenic, cholesterol removal, and anti-inflammatory activities. Here we show that tetratricopeptide repeat domain protein 39B (Ttc39b, C9orf52) (T39), a high-density lipoprotein gene discovered in human genome-wide association studies, promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of LXR. Chow-fed mice lacking T39 (T39(-/-)) display increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels associated with increased enterocyte ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (Abca1) expression and increased LXR protein without change in LXR messenger RNA. When challenged with a high fat/high cholesterol/bile salt diet, T39(-/-) mice or mice with hepatocyte-specific T39 deficiency show increased hepatic LXR protein and target gene expression, and unexpectedly protection from steatohepatitis and death. Mice fed a Western-type diet and lacking low-density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr(-/-)T39(-/-)) show decreased fatty liver, increased high-density lipoprotein, decreased low-density lipoprotein, and reduced atherosclerosis. In addition to increasing hepatic Abcg5/8 expression and limiting dietary cholesterol absorption, T39 deficiency inhibits hepatic sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1, ADD1) processing. This is explained by an increase in microsomal phospholipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids, linked to an LXRŒ±-dependent increase in expression of enzymes mediating phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis and incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids into phospholipids. The preservation of endogenous LXR protein activates a beneficial profile of gene expression that promotes cholesterol removal and inhibits lipogenesis. T39 inhibition could be an effective strategy for reducing both steatohepatitis and atherosclerosis.
Patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) are ideally suited to identify differentially methylated genes in response to starvation.
We examined high-throughput DNA methylation derived from whole blood of 47 females with AN, 47 lean females without AN and 100 population-based females to compare AN with both controls. To account for different cell type compositions, we applied two reference-free methods (FastLMM-EWASher, RefFreeEWAS) and searched for consensus CpG sites identified by both methods. We used a validation sample of five monozygotic AN-discordant twin pairs.
Fifty-one consensus sites were identified in AN vs. lean and 81 in AN vs. population-based comparisons. These sites have not been reported in AN methylation analyses, but for the latter comparison 54/81 sites showed directionally consistent differential methylation effects in the AN-discordant twins. For a single nucleotide polymorphism rs923768 in CSGALNACT1 a nearby site was nominally associated with AN. At the gene level, we confirmed hypermethylated sites at TNXB. We found support for a locus at NR1H3 in the AN vs. lean control comparison, but the methylation direction was opposite to the one previously reported.
We confirm genes like TNXB previously described to comprise differentially methylated sites, and highlight further sites that might be specifically involved in AN starvation processes.
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of SSa on LPS-induced endotoxemia in mice and clarify the possible mechanism. An LPS-induced endotoxemia mouse model was used to confirm the anti-inflammatory activity of SSa in vivo. The primary mouse macrophages were used to investigate the molecular mechanism and targets of SSa in vitro. In vivo, the results showed that SSa improved survival during lethal endotoxemia. In vitro, our results showed that SSa dose-dependently inhibited the expression of TNF-Œ±, IL-6, IL-1Œ≤, IFN-Œ≤-and RANTES in LPS-stimulated primary mouse macrophages. Western blot analysis showed that SSa suppressed LPS-induced NF-Œ∫B and IRF3 activation. Furthermore, SSa disrupted the formation of lipid rafts by depleting cholesterol and inhibited TLR4 translocation into lipid rafts. Moreover, SSa activated LXRŒ±, ABCA1 and ABCG1. Silencing LXRŒ± abrogated the effect of SSa. In conclusion, the anti-inflammatory effects of SSa is associated with activating LXRŒ± dependent cholesterol efflux pathway which result in disrupting lipid rafts by depleting cholesterol and reducing translocation of TLR4 to lipid rafts, thereby attenuating LPS mediated inflammatory response.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease characterized by myelin loss and neuronal dysfunction. Despite the aggregation observed in some families, pathogenic mutations have remained elusive. In this study, we describe the identification of NR1H3 p.Arg415Gln in seven MS patients from two multi-incident families presenting severe and progressive disease, with an average age at onset of 34 years. Additionally, association analysis of common variants in NR1H3 identified rs2279238 conferring a 1.35-fold increased risk of developing progressive MS. The p.Arg415Gln position is highly conserved in orthologs and paralogs, and disrupts NR1H3 heterodimerization and transcriptional activation of target genes. Protein expression analysis revealed that mutant NR1H3 (LXRA) alters gene expression profiles, suggesting a disruption in transcriptional regulation as one of the mechanisms underlying MS pathogenesis. Our study indicates that pharmacological activation of LXRA or its targets may lead to effective treatments for the highly debilitating and currently untreatable progressive phase of MS.
A mutation in a nuclear receptor (NR1H3) gene was detected in a familial, progressive form of multiple sclerosis (PPMS). Further analyses showed a significant association between a common NR1H3 variant in PPMS patients and loss of function for the encoded protein.
Screening of bona fide ligands for nuclear receptors is a real tour de force as the identified molecules are supposed to be able to activate the targeted proteins in cell culture as well as in vivo. Indeed orphan nuclear receptors are putative pharmacologically targets for various diseases. It is thus necessary to have quick and reproductive systems that help in identifying new ligands, agonist or antagonist, before using them in vivo in animal models to check for secondary effects. Here, we describe the transient transfections (homologous and heterologous) used for the screening of ligands for liver X receptor Œ± (LXRŒ±, NR1H3) in HeLa cells.
Nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group H, member 3 (NR1H3, an alias for Liver X receptor Œ±, LXRŒ±) is a member of the LXR nuclear receptor super family and is an important regulator of lipid and fatty acid accumulation in the liver, adipose and skeletal muscle.
In this study, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from six populations of pig (Sus scrofa) were screened by PCR-sequencing and genotyped, and its association with backfat thickness was analyzed in a population of New Huai line (NHP, n = 117). In addition, quantitative real-time PCR and western blot were used to measure expression of NR1H3 in the liver tissue, backfat and longissimus dorsi muscle of DSP (n = 10), TP (n = 10) and YY (n = 10) pigs.
Three SNPs (exon2-C105T, exon2-G106C, and exon5-A201C) were screened and exon5-A201C was identified; the genotype frequencies were significantly different between indigenous and introduced breeds. The CC genotype was associated with higher backfat thickness than the AA and AC genotypes in the NYP. NR1H3 mRNA and protein expression were higher in the liver and longissimus dorsi of DSP and TP than in those of YY. This increased NR1H3 expression might be associated with higher lipid deposition. NR1H3 expression in the backfat of YY was not lower than that in DSP or TP, which might because NR1H3 has an alternative regulatory function for lipid metabolism in the subcutaneous fat of pigs.
Our results suggest that allele A of the exon5-A201C in NR1H3 may promote a reduction in backfat thickness, and differences in NR1H3 expression may be associated with differences in lipid deposition capacity among pigs.
Interesterified fats are currently being used to replace trans fatty acids. However, their impact on biological pathways involved in the atherosclerosis development was not investigated. Weaning male LDLr-KO mice were fed for 16weeks on a high-fat diet (40% energy as fat) containing polyunsaturated (PUFA), TRANS, palmitic (PALM), palmitic interesterified (PALM INTER), stearic (STEAR) or stearic interesterified (STEAR INTER). Plasma lipids, lipoprotein profile, arterial lesion area, macrophage infiltration, collagen content and inflammatory response modulation were determined. Macrophage cholesterol efflux and the arterial expression of cholesterol uptake and efflux receptors were also performed. The interesterification process did not alter plasma lipid concentrations. Although PALM INTER did not increase plasma cholesterol concentration as much as TRANS, the cholesterol enrichment in the LDL particle was similar in both groups. Moreover, PALM INTER induced the highest IL-1Œ≤, MCP-1 and IL-6 secretion from peritoneal macrophages as compared to others. This inflammatory response elicited by PALM INTER was confirmed in arterial wall, as compared to PALM. These deleterious effects of PALM INTER culminate in higher atherosclerotic lesion, macrophage infiltration and collagen content than PALM, STEAR, STEAR INTER and PUFA. These events can partially be attributed to a macrophage cholesterol accumulation, promoted by apoAI and HDL2-mediated cholesterol efflux impairment and increased Olr-1 and decreased Abca1 and Nr1h3 expressions in the arterial wall. Interesterified fats containing palmitic acid induce atherosclerosis development by promoting cholesterol accumulation in LDL particles and macrophagic cells, activating the inflammatory process in LDLr-KO mice.
Sequence variants affecting blood lipids and coronary artery disease (CAD) may enhance understanding of the atherogenicity of lipid fractions. Using a large resource of whole-genome sequence data, we examined rare and low-frequency variants for association with non-HDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides in up to 119,146 Icelanders. We discovered 13 variants with large effects (within ANGPTL3, APOB, ABCA1, NR1H3, APOA1, LIPC, CETP, LDLR, and APOC1) and replicated 14 variants. Five variants within PCSK9, APOA1, ANGPTL4, and LDLR associate with CAD (33,090 cases and 236,254 controls). We used genetic risk scores for the lipid fractions to examine their causal relationship with CAD. The non-HDL cholesterol genetic risk score associates most strongly with CAD (P = 2.7 √ó 10(-28)), and no other genetic risk score associates with CAD after accounting for non-HDL cholesterol. The genetic risk score for non-HDL cholesterol confers CAD risk beyond that of LDL cholesterol (P = 5.5 √ó 10(-8)), suggesting that targeting atherogenic remnant cholesterol may reduce cardiovascular risk.
Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), one persistent organic pollutant, has been widely detected in the environment, wildlife and human. Currently few studies have documented the effects of chronic PFOS exposure on lipid metabolism, especially in aquatic organisms. The underlying mechanisms of hepatotoxicity induced by chronic PFOS exposure are still largely unknown. The present study defined the effects of chronic exposure to low level of PFOS on lipid metabolism using zebrafish as a model system. Our findings revealed a severe hepatic steatosis in the liver of males treated with 0.5ŒºM PFOS as evidenced by hepatosomatic index, histological assessment and liver lipid profiles. Quantitative PCR assay further indicated that PFOS significantly increase the transcriptional expression of nuclear receptors (nr1h3, rara, rxrgb, nr1l2) and the genes associated with fatty acid oxidation (acox1, acadm, cpt1a). In addition, chronic PFOS exposure significantly decreased liver ATP content and serum level of VLDL/LDL lipoprotein in males. Taken together, these findings suggest that chronic PFOS exposure induces hepatic steatosis in zebrafish via disturbing lipid biosynthesis, fatty acid Œ≤-oxidation and excretion of VLDL/LDL lipoprotein, and also demonstrate the validity of using zebrafish as an alternative model for PFOS chronic toxicity screening. 
Atherosclerosis is a major cause of coronary artery disease (CAD). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Œ≥ (PPARŒ≥), liver X receptor-Œ± (LXRŒ±), and PPARŒ≥ co-activator-1Œ± (PGC-1Œ±) are nuclear factors that regulate lipid metabolism and inflammation implicated in atherosclerosis. Although association of genetic variations in these nuclear factors with CAD risk has been reported, it was based on individual gene with inconsistent results among different ethnicities. We investigated the association of combined gene-polymorphisms of these nuclear factors with the risk and severity of CAD in Thai population.
Hospital-based subjects, 225 CADs and 162 non-CADs, were genotyped for PPARŒ≥ C1431T, PGC-1Œ± G482S, and LXRŒ±¬†-115G/A polymorphisms. Gene-polymorphisms were examined for their association with CAD risk and the severity of coronary atherosclerosis, assessed by both the number of main vessels with ‚â•50% stenosis and Gensini score.
The minor allele frequencies were 21.6% (1431T), 44.8% (482S), and 10.7% (-115A). Initially, only 482S allele revealed association with CAD risk [OR¬†=¬†1.64 (95%CI: 1.01-2.66), P¬†=¬†0.048] and severity [ORs for four-vessel disease¬†=¬†1.23 (95%CI: 1.01-1.48), P¬†=¬†0.036, and for severe atherosclerosis (score &gt;32)¬†=¬†1.76 (95%CI: 1.05-2.96), P¬†=¬†0.032]. Combined two risk-genotypes, 1431T/482S and¬†-115GG/482S, also predicted the risk of CAD [OR¬†=¬†1.87 (95%CI: 1.09-3.21), P¬†=¬†0.023 and OR¬†=¬†1.87 (95%CI: 1.15-3.03), P¬†=¬†0.012 respectively]. The combination of three risk-genotypes further increased the risk of both CAD [OR¬†=¬†2.13 (95%CI: 1.12-4.06), P¬†=¬†0.022] and severe coronary atherosclerosis [OR¬†=¬†2.09 (95%CI 1.09-4.02), P¬†=¬†0.027].
The combined PPARŒ≥ C1431T, PGC-1Œ± G482S, and LXRŒ±¬†-115G/A polymorphisms increased the risk of CAD and predicted the severity of coronary atherosclerosis in Thais.
This article describes the application of Contour to the design and discovery of a novel, potent, orally efficacious liver X receptor Œ≤ (LXRŒ≤) agonist (17). Contour technology is a structure-based drug design platform that generates molecules using a context perceptive growth algorithm guided by a contact sensitive scoring function. The growth engine uses binding site perception and programmable growth capability to create drug-like molecules by assembling fragments that naturally complement hydrophilic and hydrophobic features of the protein binding site. Starting with a crystal structure of LXRŒ≤ and a docked 2-(methylsulfonyl)benzyl alcohol fragment (6), Contour was used to design agonists containing a piperazine core. Compound 17 binds to LXRŒ≤ with high affinity and to LXRŒ± to a lesser extent, and induces the expression of LXR target genes in vitro and in vivo. This molecule served as a starting point for further optimization and generation of a candidate which is currently in human clinical trials for treating atopic dermatitis. 
Statins decrease cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) levels, which have been positively associated with hepatic lipid content as well as serum low density lipoproteins-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. However, the relationship between the CETP status and statin-induced reductions in LDL-C levels has not yet been elucidated in detail. We herein examined the influence of the CETP status on the lipid-reducing effects of pitavastatin in hypercholesterolemic patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus as well as the molecular mechanism underlying pitavastatin-induced modifications in CETP levels.
Fifty-three patients were treated with 2 mg of pitavastatin for 3 months. Serum levels of LDL-C, small dense (sd) LDL-C, and CETP were measured before and after the pitavastatin treatment. The effects of pitavastatin, T0901317, a specific agonist for liver X receptor (LXR) that reflects hepatic cholesterol contents, and LXR silencing on CETP mRNA expression in HepG2 cells were also examined by a real-time PCR assay.
The pitavastatin treatment decreased LDL-C, sdLDL-C, and CETP levels by 39, 42, and 23%, respectively. Despite the absence of a significant association between CETP and LDL-C levels at baseline, baseline CETP levels and its percentage change were an independent positive determinant for the changes observed in LDL-C and sdLDL-C levels. The LXR activation with T0901317 (0.5 ŒºM), an in vitro condition analogous to hepatic cholesterol accumulation, increased CETP mRNA levels in HepG2 cells by approximately 220%, while LXR silencing markedly diminished the increased expression of CETP. Pitavastatin (5 ŒºM) decreased basal CETP mRNA levels by 21%, and this was completely reversed by T0901317.
Baseline CETP levels may predict the lipid-reducing effects of pitavastatin. Pitavastatin-induced CETP reductions may be partially attributed to decreased LXR activity, predictable by the ensuing decline in hepatic cholesterol synthesis.

Melanogenesis is a physiological process that results in the synthesis of melanin pigments, which play a crucial protective role against skin photocarcinogenesis. We investigated the effects of a Polygoni Multiflori Ramulus extract on melanogenesis and isolated emodin from Polygoni Multiflori as an active compound. In addition, the possible mechanisms of action were examined. We found that emodin inhibited both melanin content and tyrosinase activity concentration and time dependently. Tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein (TRP)-1, and TRP-2 mRNA levels decreased following emodin treatment. However, while the mRNA levels of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) were not affected by emodin, emodin reduced MITF protein levels. Furthermore, expression of the liver X-receptor (LXR) Œ± gene, but not the LXR Œ≤ gene was upregulated by emodin. Moreover, emodin regulated melanogenesis by promoting degradation of the MITF protein by upregulating the LXR Œ± gene. The emodin effects on MITF was found to be mediated by phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK. Taken together, these findings indicate that the inhibition of melanogenesis by emodin occurs through reduced MITF protein expression, which is mediated by upregulation of the LXR Œ± gene and suggest that emodin may be useful as a hyperpigmentation inhibitor. 
The mammalian circadian timing system coordinates key molecular, cellular and physiological processes along the 24-h cycle. Accumulating evidence suggests that many clock-controlled processes display a sexual dimorphism. In mammals this is well exemplified by the difference between the male and female circadian patterns of glucocorticoid hormone secretion and clock gene expression. Here we show that the non-circadian nuclear receptor and metabolic sensor Liver X Receptor alpha (LXRŒ±) which is known to regulate glucocorticoid production in mice modulates the sex specific circadian pattern of plasma corticosterone. LxrŒ±(-/-) males display a blunted corticosterone profile while females show higher amplitude as compared to wild type animals. Wild type males are significantly slower than females to resynchronize their locomotor activity rhythm after an 8 h phase advance but this difference is abrogated in LxrŒ±(-/-) males which display a female-like phenotype. We also show that circadian expression patterns of liver 11Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11Œ≤-HSD1) and Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pepck) differ between sexes and are differentially altered in LxrŒ±(-/-) animals. These changes are associated with a damped profile of plasma glucose oscillation in males but not in females. Sex specific alteration of the insulin and leptin circadian profiles were observed in LxŒ±(-/-) females and could be explained by the change in corticosterone profile. Together this data indicates that LXRŒ± is a determinant of sexually dimorphic circadian patterns of key physiological parameters. The discovery of this unanticipated role for LXRŒ± in circadian physiology underscores the importance of addressing sex differences in chronobiology studies and future LXRŒ± targeted therapies.
Quercetin, a common member of the flavonoid family, is widely present in plant kingdom. Despite that quercetin is implicated in regulating cholesterol metabolism, the molecular mechanism is poorly understood. We hypothesized that quercetin regulates cholesterol homeostasis through regulating the key enzymes involved in hepatic cholesterol metabolism. To test this hypothesis, we compared the profile of key enzymes and transcription factors involved in the hepatic cholesterol metabolism in rats with or without quercetin supplementation. Twenty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into control and quercetin-supplemented groups. Serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and total bile acids in feces and bile were measured. Hepatic enzymatic activities were determined by activity assay kit and high-performance liquid chromatography-based analyses. The messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expressions were determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses, respectively. The results showed that the activity of hepatic cholesterol 7Œ±-hydroxylase, a critical enzyme in the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids, was significantly elevated by quercetin. The expression of cholesterol 7Œ±-hydroxylase, as well as liver X receptor Œ±, an important transcription factor, was also increased at both mRNA and protein levels by quercetin. However, quercetin exposure had no impact on the activity of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of cholesterol. We also found that quercetin treatment significantly increased ATP binding cassette transporter G1 mRNA and protein expression in the liver, suggesting that quercetin may increase hepatic cholesterol efflux. Collectively, the results presented here indicate that quercetin regulates hepatic cholesterol metabolism mainly through the pathways that promote cholesterol-to-bile acid conversion and cholesterol efflux. 
Experimental data indicate that high-fat diet (HFD) may alter proliferative activity and prostate health. However, the consequences of HFD exposure during different periods of ontogenetic development on prostate histophysiology remain to be elucidated. Herein, we compare the influence of obesogenic environment (OE) due to maternal obesity and HFD at different periods of life on proliferative activity and nuclear receptors frequency in the rat ventral prostate and a possible relationship with metabolic and hormonal alterations.
Male Wistar rats (19 weeks old), treated with balanced chow (Control group-C; 3% high-fat, 3.5‚ÄâKcal/g), were compared with those exposed to HFD (20% high-fat, 4.9‚Äâkcal/g) during gestation (G-maternal obesity), gestation and lactation (GL), from post-weaning to adulthood (WA), from lactation to adulthood (LA) and from gestation to adulthood (GA). After the experimental period, the ventral prostate lobes were removed and analyzed with different methods.
Metabolic data indicated that G and GL rats became insulin resistant and WA, LA, and GA became insulin resistant and obese. There was a strong inverse correlation between serum testosterone (‚àº133% lower) and leptin levels (‚àº467% higher) in WA, LA, and GA groups. Estrogen serum levels increased in GA, and insulin levels increased in all groups, especially in WA (64.8√ó). OE-groups exhibited prostatic hypertrophy, since prostate weight increased ‚àº40% in G, GL, LA, and GA and 31% in WA. As indicated by immunohistochemistry, all HFD-groups except G exhibited an increase in epithelial cell proliferation (PCNA-positive) and a decrease in frequency of AR- and ERŒ≤-positive epithelial cells; there was also an increment of ERŒ±-positive stromal cells in comparison with control. Cells containing PPARŒ≥ increased in both epithelium and stroma of all OE groups and those expressing LXRŒ± decreased, particularly in groups OE-exposed during gestation (G, GL and GA).
OE leads to prostate hypertrophy regardless of the period of development and, except when restricted to gestation, leads to a hyperproliferative status which was correlated to downregulation of AR and LXRŒ± and upregulation of ERŒ± and PPARŒ≥ signaling.
Members of the poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) family catalyse the ADP-ribosylation of target proteins and are known to play important roles in many cellular processes, including DNA repair, differentiation and transcription. The majority of PARPs exhibit mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase activity rather than PARP activity; however, little is known about their biological activity. In the present study, we report that 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)-inducible poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (TIPARP), mono-ADP-ribosylates and positively regulates liver X receptor Œ± (LXRŒ±) and LXRŒ≤ activity. Overexpression of TIPARP enhanced LXR-reporter gene activity. TIPARP knockdown or deletion reduced LXR regulated target gene expression levels in HepG2 cells and in Tiparp(-/-)mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) respectively. Deletion and mutagenesis studies showed that TIPARP's zinc-finger and catalytic domains were required to enhance LXR activity. Protein interaction studies using TIPARP and LXRŒ±/Œ≤ peptide arrays revealed that LXRs interacted with an N-terminal sequence (a.a. 209-236) of TIPARP, which also overlapped with a putative co-activator domain of TIPARP (a.a. 200-225). Immunofluorescence studies showed that TIPARP and LXRŒ± or LXRŒ≤ co-localized in the nucleus.In vitroribosylation assays provided evidence that TIPARP mono-ADP-ribosylated both LXRŒ± and LXRŒ≤. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) studies revealed that ADP-ribosylase macrodomain 1 (MACROD1), but not MACROD2, interacted with LXRs in a TIPARP-dependent manner. This was complemented by reporter gene studies showing that MACROD1, but not MACROD2, prevented the TIPARP-dependent increase in LXR activity. GW3965-dependent increases in hepatic Srebp1 mRNA and protein expression levels were reduced in Tiparp(-/-)mice compared with Tiparp(+/+)mice. Taken together, these data identify a new mechanism of LXR regulation that involves TIPARP, ADP-ribosylation and MACROD1.
Excess nitric oxide (NO) deregulates cholesterol metabolism in macrophage foam cells, yet the underlying molecular mechanism is incompletely understood. To investigate the mechanism, we found that in macrophages, treatment with NO donors S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D,L-penicillamine (SNAP) or diethylenetriamine/nitric oxide induced LXRŒ± degradation and reduced the expression of the downstream target of LXRŒ±, ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), and cholesterol efflux. In addition, SNAP induced calcium (Ca(2+)) influx into cells, increased calpain activity and promoted the formation of calpain-LXRŒ± complex. Pharmacological inhibition of calpain activity reversed the SNAP-induced degradation of LXRŒ±, down-regulation of ABCA1 and impairment of cholesterol efflux in macrophages. SNAP increased the formation of calpain-LXRŒ± complex in a Pro-Glu-Ser-Thr (PEST) motif-dependent manner. Truncation of the PEST motif in LXRŒ± abolished the calpain-dependent proteolysis. Removal of extracellular Ca(2+) by EGTA or pharmacological inhibition of TRPV1 channel activity diminished SNAP-induced increase in intracellular Ca(2+), calpain activation, LXRŒ± degradation, ABCA1 down-regulation and impaired cholesterol efflux. In conclusion, excess NO may activate calpain via TRPV1-Ca(2+) signaling and promote the recognition of calpain in the PEST motif of LXRŒ±, thereby leading to degradation of LXRŒ± and, ultimately, downregulated ABCA1 expression and impaired ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux in macrophages.
