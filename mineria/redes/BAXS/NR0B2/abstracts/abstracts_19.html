<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>	<meta charset="utf-8">	<title>generación de archivo html</title></head><body>Recent studies have indicated that a recurrent t(6;9)(q22-23;p23-24) chromosomal translocation in salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) results in a MYB proto-oncogene transcription factor-nuclear factor I/B (MYB-NFIB) gene fusion, which has not previously been detected in any non-ACC carcinomas of the head and neck. In the present study, data on clinical factors affecting the survival rate of patients with salivary ACC from a single institution was retrospectively analyzed, and the frequency of MYB gene rearrangement determined. A total of 97 patient cases were analyzed, and young adults presenting with ACC (&lt;40 years old) accounted for 19.6% of all patients (n=19). A total of 70.1% (n=68) displayed neurological symptoms, including pain, paraesthesia, tongue deviation, and facial paralysis. A marked majority of the analyzed tumors (85.6%) displayed evidence of MYB rearrangement. MYB rearrangement was significantly higher in patients with late Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) stage cancer compared with that in patients with early TNM stage (P=0.033), as detected by a dual color MYB break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization probe. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed significant differences in patient overall survival (OS) time with regard to age, gender, TNM stage, neurological symptoms, margin status and MYB rearrangement. Specifically, young age was significantly associated with a shorter OS time. In summary, the present study suggested that young patients with salivary ACC presented with a worse prognosis, in contrast to the majority of patients with salivary ACC. Moreover, MYB alterations exhibited a high positive rate in salivary ACC, and therefore, the absence of MYB rearrangements may be associated with a better prognosis.
This perspective paper explores the utilization of abiotic stress-responsive transcription factors (TFs) from crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants to improve abiotic stress tolerance in crop plants. CAM is a specialized type of photosynthetic adaptation that enhances water-use efficiency (WUE) by shifting CO2 uptake to all or part of the nighttime when evaporative water losses are minimal. Recent studies have shown that TF-based genetic engineering could be a useful approach for improving plant abiotic stress tolerance because of the role of TFs as master regulators of clusters of stress-responsive genes. Here, we explore the use of abiotic stress-responsive TFs from CAM plants to improve abiotic stress tolerance and WUE in crops by controlling the expression of gene cohorts that mediate drought-responsive adaptations. Recent research has revealed several TF families including AP2/ERF, MYB, WRKY, NAC, NF-Y, and bZIP that might regulate water-deficit stress responses and CAM in the inducible CAM plant Mesembryanthemum crystallinum under water-deficit stress-induced CAM and in the obligate CAM plant Kalanchoe fedtschenkoi. Overexpression of genes from these families in Arabidopsis thaliana can improve abiotic stress tolerance in A. thaliana in some instances. Therefore, we propose that TF-based genetic engineering with a small number of CAM abiotic stress-responsive TFs will be a promising strategy for improving abiotic stress tolerance and WUE in crop plants in a projected hotter and drier landscape in the 21st-century and beyond.
T. HALOPHILA HOMEOBOX PROTEIN 1(TsHD1) cloned from the halophyte Thellungiella halophila is a homeodomain (HD) transcription factor gene and functions as a collaborator of TsNAC1. TsHD1 can form heterodimers with TsNAC1 via the interaction between its zinc finger (ZF) domain and the A subdomain of TsNAC1. The overexpression of TsHD1 improved the heat stress resistance of T. halophila and retarded its vegetative growth slightly. The co-overexpression of TsHD1 and TsNAC1 highly improved heat and drought stress resistance by increasing the accumulation of heat shock proteins and enhancing the expression levels of drought stress response genes, such as MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN 77 and MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN 96 (MYB77and MYB96) and SALT TOLERANCE ZINC FINGER 10 and SALT TOLERANCE ZINC FINGER 18 (ZAT10 and ZAT18), but seriously retarded the vegetative growth of T. halophila by restraining cell expansion. The heterodimer of TsHD1 and TsNAC1 has higher transcriptional activation activity and higher stability compared with the homodimer of TsHD1 or TsNAC1. The binding sites of the TsHD1 and TsNAC1 heterodimers were found to exist in the promoters of most upregulated genes in Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (P35S)::TsHD1 and P35S::TsNAC1 transgene lines compared with the wild type using RNA-seq and genomic data analyses. Moreover, the binding sites in the promoter region of the most downregulated genes were located in the vicinity of the TATA-box. This study reveals that TsNAC1 and TsHD1 play roles in plant growth and abiotic stress resistance synergistically, and the effects depend on the heterodimer binding to the specific target sites in the promoter region.
Anthocyanin is an important parameter for evaluating the quality of wine grapes. However, the effects of different light intensities on anthocyanin synthesis in grape berry skin and its regulation mechanisms are still unclear. In this experiment, clusters of wine grape cv. 'Marselan' were bagged using fruit bags with different light transmittance of 50%, 15%, 5%, and 0, designated as treatment A, B, C and D, respectively. Fruits that were not bagged were used as the control, designated as CK. The anthocyanin composition and concentration, as well as gene expression profiles in the berry skin were determined. The results showed that the degree of coloration of the berry skin reduced with the decrease of the light transmittance, and the veraison was postponed for 10 days in D when compared with the CK. Total anthocyanin concentration in the berry skin treated with D decreased by 51.50% compared with CK at the harvest stage. A total of 24 and 21 anthocyanins were detected in CK and D, respectively. Among them, Malvidin-3-O-coumaroylglucoside (trans), which showed a significant positive correlation with the total concentration of anthocyanins at the harvest stage (r = 0.775) and was not detected in D, was presumed to be light-induced anthocyanin. Other anthocyanins which were both synthesized in CK and D were considered to be light-independent anthocyanins. Among them, Malvidin-3-O-coumaroylglucoside (cis) and Malvidin-3-O-acetylglucoside were typical representatives. Remarkably, the synthesis of light-inducible anthocyanins and light-independent anthocyanins were regulated by different candidate structural genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis pathway and members of MYB and bHLH transcription factors.
157 known and 55 novel miRNAs were found in sweet cherry fruit. MiRNA target genes involved in fruit ripening and the differentially expressed miRNAs under CO2 treatment were identified. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs and play important functions in many biological processes, including fruit ripening and senescence. In the current study, the high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics methods were implemented to decipher the miRNAs landscape in sweet cherry fruit. A total of 157 known miRNAs belonging to 50 families and 55 putative novel miRNAs were found. Target genes of the miRNAs were predicted and genes involved in fruit ripening were found, including F-box proteins and TFs such as SPL, TCP, NAC, MYB, ARF and AP2/ERF. And these target genes were further confirmed by degradome sequencing. A regulatory network model was constructed to uncover the miRNAs and their targets involved in fruit ripening and senescence. Importantly, elevated carbon dioxide can significantly postpone the ripening and senescence of sweet cherry fruit and the differentially expressed miRNAs exposed to CO2 were identified. These miRNAs included miR482j, miR6275, miR164, miR166, miR171, miR393, miR858, miR3627a, miR6284, miR6289 and miR7122b, and some of their functions were linked to fruit ripening. This study was the first report to profile miRNAs in sweet cherry fruit and it would provide more information for further study of miRNA roles in the ripening processes and their regulation mechanism underlying the effects of high carbon dioxide treatment on fruit ripening.
MYB transcription factors have been demonstrated to play key regulatory roles in plant growth, development and abiotic stress response. However, knowledge concerning the involvement of rice MYB genes in salinity and drought stress resistance are largely unknown. In the present study, we cloned and characterized the OsMYB6 gene, which was induced by drought and salinity stress. Subcellular localization of OsMYB6-YFP fusion protein in protoplast cells indicated that OsMYB6 was localized in the nucleus. Overexpression of OsMYB6 in rice did not suggest a negative effect on the growth and development of transgenic plants, but OsMYB6-overexpressing plants showed increased tolerance to drought and salt stress compared with wild-type plants, as are evaluated by higher proline content, higher CAT and SOD activities, lower REL and MDA content in transgenic plants under drought and salt stress conditions. In addition, the expression of abiotic stress-responsive genes were significantly higher in OsMYB6 transgenic plants than that in wild-type plants under drought and salt stress conditions. These results indicate that OsMYB6 gene functions as a stress-responsive transcription factor which plays a positive regulatory role in response to drought and salt stress resistance, and may be used as a candidate gene for molecular breeding of salt-tolerant and drought-tolerant crop varieties.
Plants have evolved sophisticated systems in response to environmental changes, and growth arrest is a common strategy used to enhance stress tolerance. Despite the growth-survival trade-off being essential to the shaping of plant productivity, the mechanisms balancing growth and survival remain largely unknown. Aquaporins play a crucial role in growth and stress responses by controlling water transport across membranes. Here, we show that RhPIP2;1, an aquaporin from rose (Rosa sp.), interacts with a membrane-tethered MYB protein, RhPTM. Water deficiency triggers nuclear translocation of the RhPTM C terminus. Silencing of RhPTM causes continuous growth under drought stress and a consequent decrease in survival rate. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) indicated that RhPTM influences the expression of genes related to carbohydrate metabolism. Water deficiency induces phosphorylation of RhPIP2;1 at Ser 273, which is sufficient to promote nuclear translocation of the RhPTM C terminus. These results indicate that the RhPIP2;1-RhPTM module serves as a key player in orchestrating the trade-off between growth and stress survival in Rosa.
MYB-type transcription factors (TFs) play important roles in plant growth and development, and in the responses to several abiotic stresses. In rice (Oryza sativa), the roles of MYB-related TFs in leaf senescence are not well documented. Here, we examined the rice MYB TF gene OsMYB102 and found that an OsMYB102 T-DNA activation-tagged line (termed osmyb102-D), which constitutively expresses OsMYB102 under the control of four tandem repeats of the 35S promoter, and OsMYB102-overexpressing transgenic lines (35S:OsMYB102 and 35S:GFP-OsMYB102) maintain green leaves much longer than the wild type under natural, dark-induced, and abscisic acid (ABA)-induced senescence conditions. Moreover, an osmyb102 knockout mutant showed an accelerated senescence phenotype under dark-induced and ABA-induced leaf senescence conditions. Microarray analysis showed that a variety of senescence-associated genes (SAGs) were downregulated in the osmyb102-D line. Further studies demonstrated that overexpression of OsMYB102 regulates the expression of SAGs, including genes associated with ABA degradation and ABA signaling (OsABF4, OsNAP, and OsCYP707A6), under dark-induced senescence conditions. OsMYB102 inhibits ABA accumulation by directly activating the transcription of OsCYP707A6, which encodes the ABA catabolic enzyme ABSCISIC ACID 8'-HYDROXYLASE. OsMYB102 also indirectly represses ABA-responsive genes, such as OsABF4 and OsNAP. Collectively, these results demonstrate that OsMYB102 plays a critical role in leaf senescence by downregulating ABA accumulation and ABA signaling responses.
Kernel size in cereal is an important agronomic trait controlled by the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. The endosperm occupies most of the kernel area; for this reason, the endosperm cells dimension, number and metabolic content strongly influence kernel properties. This paper presents the transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis of the maize defective endosperm 18 (de18) mutant, where auxin accumulation in the endosperm is impaired. This mutation, involving the ZmYuc1 gene, leads to a reduced kernel size compared to the wild-type line B37. Our results mainly indicate that IAA concentration controls sugar and protein metabolism during kernel differentiation and it is necessary for BETL formation. Furthermore, a fine tuning of different auxin conjugates is reported as the main mechanism to counteract the auxin deficit. Some candidates as master regulators of endosperm transcriptional regulation mediated by auxin are found between MYB and MADS-box gene families. A link between auxin and storage protein accumulation is highlighted, suggesting that IAA directly or indirectly, through CK or ABA, regulates the transcription of zein coding genes. This study represents a move forward with respect to the current knowledge about the role of auxin during maize endosperm differentiation thus revealing the genes that are modulated by auxin and that control agronomic traits as kernel size and metabolic composition.
Plants have evolved phosphate (Pi) starvation response to adapt the low-Pi environment. The regulation of adaptive responses to phosphorus deficiency by the PHR1-miR399-PHO2 module has been well studied in Arabidopsis thaliana but not in strawberry. Transcription factor PHR1 as the central regulator in the Pi starvation signaling has been revealed in a few plant species. However, the function of PHR1 homologues in strawberry is still unknown. In this study, a total of 13 MYB-CC genes were identified in the woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca) genome and the FvPHR1 gene was characterized. FvPHR1 contains MYB domain and coiled-coil (CC) domain and is localized in the nucleus. FvPHR1 also exhibits trans-activation ability. Furthermore, the P content in leaves of FvPHR1-overexpressing woodland strawberries was significantly increased by 1.38-fold to 1.78-fold compared with that in the wild type. FvPHR1 was also demonstrated to directly bind to the FvMIR399a promoter and positively regulate the expression of FvmiR399a in woodland strawberry. These results showed that PHR1-miR399 module is involved in the regulation of phosphate-signaling pathway and phosphate homeostasis in woodland strawberry.
Flower color is a charming phenotype with very important ornamental and commercial values. Anthocyanins play a critical role in determining flower color pattern formation, and their biosynthesis is typically regulated by R2R3-MYB transcription factors (TFs). Paeonia suffruticosa is a famous ornamental plant with colorful flowers. However, little is known about the R2R3-MYB TFs that regulate anthocyanin accumulation in P. suffruticosa. In the present study, two R2R3-MYB TFs, namely, PsMYB114L and PsMYB12L, were isolated from the petals of P. suffruticosa 'Shima Nishiki' and functionally characterized. Sequence analysis suggested that PsMYB114L contained a bHLH-interaction motif, whereas PsMYB12L contained two flavonol-specific motifs (SG7 and SG7-2). Subsequently, the in vivo function of PsMYB114L and PsMYB12L was investigated by their heterologous expression in Arabidopsis thaliana and apple calli. In transgenic Arabidopsis plants, overexpression of PsMYB114L and of PsMYB12L caused a significantly higher accumulation of anthocyanins, resulting in purple-red leaves. Transgenic apple calli overexpressing PsMYB114L and PsMYB12L also significantly enhanced the anthocyanins content and resulted in a change in the callus color to red. Meanwhile, gene expression analysis in A. thaliana and apple calli suggested that the expression levels of the flavonol synthase (MdFLS) and anthocyanidin reductase (MdANR) genes were significantly downregulated and the dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (AtDFR) and anthocyanin synthase (AtANS) genes were significantly upregulated in transgenic lines of PsMYB114L. Moreover, the expression level of the FLS gene (MdFLS) was significantly downregulated and the DFR (AtDFR/MdDFR) and ANS (AtANS/MdANS) genes were all significantly upregulated in transgenic lines plants of PsMYB12L. These results indicate that PsMYB114L and PsMYB12L both enhance anthocyanin accumulation by specifically regulating the expression of some anthocyanin biosynthesis-related genes in different plant species. Together, these results provide a valuable resource with which to further study the regulatory mechanism of anthocyanin biosynthesis in P. suffruticosa and for the breeding of tree peony cultivars with novel and charming flower colors.
Lycoris longituba, belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family, is a perennial bulb bearing flowers with diverse colors and fragrance. Selection of cultivars with excellent colored and scented flowers has always been the breeding aim for ornamental plants. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying color fading and aroma production during flower expansion in L. longituba remain unclear. Therefore, to systematically investigate these important biological phenomena, the tepals of L. longituba from different developmental stages were used to screen and analyze the metabolic components and relevant genes. Utilizing the Illumina platform, a total of 144,922 unigenes were obtained from the RNA-Seq libraries. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis indicated that the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways might play important roles during color and aroma changes. Metabolomic analysis identified 29 volatile organic components (VOCs) from different developmental stages of L. longituba tepals, and orthogonal partial least-squares discriminate analysis (OPLS-DA) revealed that trans-β-ocimene-a terpene-was the most important aroma compound. Meanwhile, we found the content of anthocyanin was significantly reduced during the tepal color fading process. Then, we identified two dihydroflavonol-4-reductase (DFR) and three terpene synthase (TPS) genes, for which expression changes coincided with the production patterns of anthocyanins and trans-β-ocimene, respectively. Furthermore, a number of MYB and bHLH transcription factors (TFs) which might be involved in color- and aroma-formation were also identified in L. longituba tepal transcriptomes. Taken together, this is the first comprehensive report of the color and fragrance in tepals of L. longituba and these results could be helpful in understanding these characteristics and their regulation networks.
Previously, we demonstrated that pollen chamber formation (PCF) in G. biloba ovules was a process of programmed cell death (PCD) within the nucellar cells at the micropylar end. However, the signal triggering the cascades of the programmed events in these nucellar cells remains unexplored.
A transcriptomic strategy was employed to unravel the mechanism underlying the nucellar PCD via the comparative profiles of RNA-seq between pre-PCF and post-PCF ovules. A total of 5599 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with significance was identified from G. biloba ovules and classified into three main categories of GO annotation, including 17 biological processes, 15 cellular components and 17 molecular functions. KEGG analysis showed that 72 DEGs were enriched in "Plant hormone signal transduction". Furthermore, 99 DEGs were found to be associated with the PCD process, including the genes involved in ethylene signaling pathway, PCD initiation, and PCD execution. Moreover, calcium-cytochemical localization indicated that calcium could play a role in regulating PCD events within the nucellar cells during pollen chamber formation in G. biloba ovules.
A putative working model, consisting of three overlapping processes, is proposed for the nucellar PCD: at the stage of PCD preparation, ethylene signaling pathway is activated for transcriptional regulation of the downstream targets; subsequently, at the stage of PCD initiation, the upregulated expression of several transcription factors, i.e., NAC, bHLH, MADS-box, and MYB, further promotes the corresponding transcript levels of CYTOCHROME C and CALMODULINs, thereby, leads to the PCD initiation via the calcium-dependent signaling cascade; finally, at the stage of PCD execution, some proteases like metacaspases and vacuolar processing enzyme for hydrolysis, together with the process of autophagy, play roles in the clearance of cellular components. Afterwards, a pollen chamber is generated from the removal of specific nucellar cells in the developing ovule.
The members of the Triticeae tribe are characterised by the presence of orthologous and homoeologous gene copies regulating flavonoid biosynthesis. Among transcription factors constituting a regulatory MBW complex, the greatest contribution to the regulation of flavonoid biosynthetic pathway is invested by R2R3-Myb-type TFs. Differently expressed R2R3-Myb copies activate the synthesis of various classes of flavonoid compounds in different plant tissues. The aim of this research was the identification, comparison and analysis of full-length sequences of the duplicated R2R3-Myb Mpc1 (Myb protein c1) gene copies in barley and wheat genomes.
The Mpc1 genes were identified in homoeologous group 4 and 7 chromosomes: a total of 3 copies in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and 8 copies in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genomes. All Mpc1 genes have a similar two-exon structure, and almost all of them are transcriptionally active. The calculation of the divergence time revealed that first duplication between 4 and 7 chromosomes of the common ancestor of the Triticeae tribe occurred about 35-46 million years ago (MYA); the last duplication arised about 16-19 MYA before the divergence Triticum and Hordeum genera The connection between gene expression and the appearance of anthocyanin pigmentation was found for three genes from homoeologous group 4 chromosomes: TaMpc1-A2 (5AL) in wheat coleoptile, HvMpc1-H2 (4HL) in barley lemma and aleurone layer, and HvMpc1-H3 (4HL) in barley aleurone layer. TaMpc1-D4 (4DL) from the wheat genome showed a strong level of expression regardless of the colour of coleoptile or pericarp. It is assumed, that this gene regulates the biosynthesis of uncoloured flavonoids in analysed tissues.
The regulatory R2R3-Myb genes involved in anthocyanin synthesis were identified and characterised in Triticeae tribe species. Genes designated HvMpc1-H2 and HvMpc1-H3 appeared to be the main factors underlying intraspecific variation of H. vulgare by lemma and aleurone colour. TaMpc1-A2 is the co-regulator of the Mpc1-1 genes in bread wheat genome controlling anthocyanin synthesis in coleoptile.
Anthocyanins are plants secondary metabolites important for plant adaptation to severe environments and potentially beneficial to human health. Purple colour of barley grain is caused by the pigments synthesized in pericarp. One or two genes determine the trait. One of them is Ant2 mapped on chromosome 2HL and is known to encode transcription factor (TF) with a bHLH domain. In plants, bHLH regulates anthocyanin biosynthesis together with TF harboring an R2R3-MYB domain. In wheat, the R2R3-MYBs responsible for purple colour of grain pericarp are encoded by the homoallelic series of the Pp-1 genes that were mapped on the short arms of chromosomes 7. In barley, in orthologous positions to wheat's Pp-1, the Ant1 gene determining red colour of leaf sheath has been mapped. In the current study, we tested whether Ant1 has pleiotropic effect not only on leaf sheath colour but also on pericarp pigmentation.
А set of near isogenic lines (NILs) carrying different combinations of alleles at the Ant1 and Ant2 loci was created using markers-assisted backcrossing approach. The dominant alleles of both the Ant1 and Ant2 genes are required for anthocyanin accumulation in pericarp. A qRT-PCR analysis of the Ant genes in lemma and pericarp of the NILs revealed that some reciprocal interaction occurs between the genes. Expression of each of the two genes was up-regulated in purple-grained line with dominant alleles at the both loci. The lines carrying dominant allele either in the Ant1 or in the Ant2 locus were characterized by the decreased level of expression of the dominant gene and scant activity of the recessive one. The Ant1 and Ant2 expression was barely detected in uncolored line with recessive alleles at both loci. The anthocyanin biosynthesis structural genes were differently regulated: Chs, Chi, F3h, Dfr were transcribed in all lines independently on allelic state of the Ant1 and Ant2 genes, whereas F3'h and Ans were activated in presence on dominant alleles of the both regulatory genes.
The R2R3-MYB-encoding counterpart (Ant1) of the regulatory Ant2 gene was determined for the first time. The dominant alleles of both of them are required for activation of anthocyanin synthesis in barley lemma and pericarp. The R2R3-MYB + bHLH complex activates the synthesis via affecting expression of the F3'h and Ans structural genes. In addition, positive regulatory loop between Ant1 and Ant2 was detected. Earlier the interaction between the anthocyanin biosynthesis regulatory genes has been revealed in dicot plant species only. Our data demonstrated that the regulatory mechanism is considered to be more common for plant kingdom than it has been reported so far.
Myc-like regulatory factors carrying the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain belong to a large superfamily of transcriptional factors (TFs) present in all eukaryotic kingdoms. In plants, the representatives of this superfamily regulate diverse biological processes including growth and development as well as response to various stresses. As members of the regulatory MBW complexes, they participate in biosynthesis of flavonoids. In wheat, only one member (TaMyc1) of the Myc-like TFs family has been studied, while structural and functional organization of further members remained uncharacterized. From two Myc-subfamilies described recently in the genomes of Triticeae tribe species, we investigated thoroughly the members of the subfamily I which includes the TaMyc1 gene.
Comparison of the promoter regions of the Myc subfamily I members in wheat suggested their division into two groups (likely homoeologous sets): TaMyc-1 (TaMyc-A1/TaMyc1, TaMyc-B1, TaMyc-D1) and TaMyc-2 (TaMyc-A2 and TaMyc-D2). It was demonstrated that the TaMyc-D1 copy has lost its functionality due to the frame shift mutation. The study of functional features of the other four copies suggested some of them to be involved in the biosynthesis of anthocyanins. In particular, TaMyc-B1 is assumed to be a co-regulator of the gene TaC1-A1 (encoding R2R3-Myb factor) in the MBW regulatory complex activating anthocyanin synthesis in wheat coleoptile. The mRNA levels of the TaMyc-A1, TaMyc-B1, TaMyc-A2 and TaMyc-D2 genes increased significantly in wheat seedlings exposed to osmotic stress. Salinity stress induced expression of TaMyc-B1 and TaMyc-A2, while TaMyc-A1 was repressed.
The features of the structural and functional organization of the members of subfamily I of Myc-like TFs in wheat were determined. Myc-like co-regulator (TaMyc-B1) of anthocyanin synthesis in wheat coleoptile was described for the first time. The Myc-encoding genes presumably involved in response to drought and salinity were determined in wheat. The results obtained are important for further manipulations with Myc genes, aimed on increasing wheat adaptability.
Arbuscular mycorrhiza can improve the salt-tolerance of host plant. A systematic study of mycorrhizal plant responses to salt stress may provide insights into the acquired salt tolerance. Here, the transcriptional profiles of mycorrhizal Sesbania cannabina shoot and root under saline stress were obtained by RNA-Seq. Using weighted gene coexpression network analysis and pairwise comparisons, we identified coexpressed modules, networks and hub genes in mycorrhizal S. cannabina in response to salt stress. In total, 10,371 DEGs were parsed into five coexpression gene modules. One module was positively correlated with both salt treatment and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) inoculation, and associated with photosynthesis and ROS scavenging in both enzymatic and nonenzymatic pathways. The hub genes in the module were mostly transcription factors including WRKY, MYB, ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR, and TCP members involved in the circadian clock and might represent central regulatory components of acquired salinity tolerance in AM S. cannabina. The expression patterns of 12 genes involved in photosynthesis, oxidation-reduction processes, and several transcription factors revealed by qRT-PCR confirmed the RNA-Seq data. This large-scale assessment of Sesbania genomic resources will help in exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying plant-AM fungi interaction in salt stress responses.
The control of bud burst process depending on temperature is crucial factor in woody perennial plants to survive in unfavorable ecological conditions. Although it has important economic and agronomic values, little information is available on the molecular mechanism of the bud burst process in Corylus avellana. Here for the first time, we conducted a de novo transcriptome-based experiment using eco-dormant leaf bud tissues. Four transcriptome libraries were constructed from the leaf bud tissues and sequenced via Illumina platform. Transcriptome analysis revealed 86,394 unigenes with a mean length of 1189 nt and an N50 of 1916 nt. Among these unigenes, 63,854 (73.78%) of them were annotated by at least one database. De novo assembled transcripts were enriched in phenylpropanoid metabolism, phytohormone biosynthesis and signal transduction pathways. Analyses of phytohormone-associated genes revealed important changes during bud burst, in response to gibberellic acid, auxin, and brassinosteroids. Approximately 2163 putative transcription factors were predicted, of which the largest number of unique transcripts belonged to the MYB transcription factor family. These results contribute to a better understanding of the regulation of bud burst genes in perennial plants.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of single-stranded non-coding small RNAs (sRNAs) that are 20-24 nucleotides (nt) in length. Extensive studies have indicated that miRNAs play important roles in plant growth, development and stress responses. With more copper (Cu) and copper containing compounds used as bactericides and fungicides in plants, Cu stress has become one of the serious environmental problems that affect plant growth and development. In order to uncover the hidden response mechanisms of Cu stress, two small RNA libraries were constructed from Cu-treated and water-treated (Control) leaves of 'Summer Black' grapevine. Following high-throughput sequencing and filtering, a total of 158 known and 98 putative novel miRNAs were identified in the two libraries. Among these, 100 known and 47 novel miRNAs were identified as differentially expressed under Cu stress. Subsequently, the expression patterns of nine Cu-responsive miRNAs were validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). There existed some consistency in expression levels of Cu-responsive miRNAs between high throughput sequencing and qRT-PCR assays. The targets prediction of miRNAs indicates that miRNA may regulate some transcription factors, including AP2, SBP, NAC, MYB and ARF during Cu stress. The target genes for two known and two novel miRNAs showed specific cleavage sites at the 10th and/or 11th nucleotide from the 5'-end of the miRNA corresponding to their miRNA complementary sequences. The findings will lay the foundation for exploring the role of the regulation of miRNAs in response to Cu stress and provide valuable gene information for breeding some Cu-tolerant grapevine cultivars.
MYB proteins are major transcription factors that play significant roles in plant defenses against various stresses. However, available information regarding stress-related MYB genes in maize is minimal. Herein, a maize MYB gene, ZmMYB3R, was cloned and functionally characterized. Subcellular localisation analysis showed that ZmMYB3R is localised to the nucleus. Yeast one-hybrid results revealed that ZmMYB3R has trans-activation activity, and a minimal activation domain at the C-terminus spanning residues 217-563. Gene expression analysis suggested that ZmMYB3R was induced by drought, salt and abscisic acid (ABA). Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing ZmMYB3R displayed enhanced growth performance and higher survival rates, elevated catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme activities, increased sensitivity to ABA, and regulation of the stomatal aperture, suggesting that ZmMYB3R enhances tolerance to drought and salt stress. qRT-PCR assays revealed elevated expression levels of stress/ABA genes in transgenic plants following stress treatments. Moreover, transgenic plants accumulated higher ABA content than wild-type plants under drought and salt stress conditions. Collectively, these results indicate that ZmMYB3R is a positive transcription factor that enhances tolerance to drought and salt stress via an ABA-dependent pathway. The findings may prove useful for engineering economically important crops.
Purple corn is a rich source of anthocyanins. In the experiment, two anthocyanins-enriched purple corn lines Ha0414 and Ha6130 were identified. The anthocyanins were respectively accumulated in the pericarp of Ha0414 and the aleurone layer of Ha6130 with different composition and content. Transcriptome analysis of the two tissues in both lines identified 16 and 14 differentially expressed genes belonging to anthocyanin metabolism pathway in pericarp and the aleurone layer, individually. Of these genes, two genes encoding 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) and Fe (II)-dependent oxygenase superfamily proteins, and one gene annotated as UDP-glycosyltransferase superfamily protein exhibited increased transcript abundance in both the colored pericarp and aleurone layer. Otherwise, one gene annotated as flavonoid 3', 5'-hydroxylase, and another gene encoding flavonoid 3'-monooxygenase displayed increased transcript abundance in the aleurone layer of Ha6130. Moreover, 36 transcription factors were identified with increased transcript abundance in the pericarp of Ha0414, such as bHLH transcription factors, WRKY transcription factors, and HB transcription factors. And 79 transcription factors were isolated with an increased expression level in the aleurone layer of Ha6130, including MYB transcription factors, MYB-related transcription factors, and bHLH transcription factors. These genes expression may result in the tissue-specific accumulation of anthocyanins in pericarp and aleurone layer.
Abscisic acid (ABA) reduces accumulation of potentially toxic cadmium (Cd) in plants. How the ABA signal is transmitted to modulate Cd uptake remains largely unclear. Here, we report that the basic region/Leu zipper transcription factor ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE5 (ABI5), a central ABA signaling molecule, is involved in ABA-repressed Cd accumulation in plants by physically interacting with a previously uncharacterized R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, MYB49. Overexpression of the Cd-induced MYB49 gene in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) resulted in a significant increase in Cd accumulation, whereas myb49 knockout plants and plants expressing chimeric repressors of MYB49:ERF-associated amphiphilic repression motif repression domain (SRDX49) exhibited reduced accumulation of Cd. Further investigations revealed that MYB49 positively regulates the expression of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors bHLH38 and bHLH101 by directly binding to their promoters, leading to activation of IRON-REGULATED TRANSPORTER1, which encodes a metal transporter involved in Cd uptake. MYB49 also binds to the promoter regions of the heavy metal-associated isoprenylated plant proteins (HIPP22) and HIPP44, resulting in up-regulation of their expression and subsequent Cd accumulation. On the other hand, as a feedback mechanism to control Cd uptake and accumulation in plant cells, Cd-induced ABA up-regulates the expression of ABI5, whose protein product interacts with MYB49 and prevents its binding to the promoters of downstream genes, thereby reducing Cd accumulation. Our results provide new insights into the molecular feedback mechanisms underlying ABA signaling-controlled Cd uptake and accumulation in plants.
Floral development is one of the model systems for investigating the mechanisms underlying organogenesis in plants. Floral organ identity is controlled by the well-known ABC model, which has been generalized to many flowering plants. Here, we report a previously uncharacterized MYB-like gene, AGAMOUS-LIKE FLOWER (AGLF), involved in flower development in the model legume Medicago truncatula Loss-of-function of AGLF results in flowers with stamens and carpel transformed into extra whorls of petals and sepals. Compared with the loss-of-function mutant of the class C gene AGAMOUS (MtAG) in M. truncatula, the defects in floral organ identity are similar between aglf and mtag, but the floral indeterminacy is enhanced in the aglf mutant. Knockout of AGLF in the mutants of the class A gene MtAP1 or the class B gene MtPI leads to an addition of a loss-of-C-function phenotype, reflecting a conventional relationship of AGLF with the canonical A and B genes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AGLF activates MtAG in transcriptional levels in control of floral organ identity. These data shed light on the conserved and diverged molecular mechanisms that control flower development and morphology among plant species.
Stem cells are maintained by transcriptional programs that promote self-renewal and repress differentiation. Here, we found that the transcription factor c-Myb was essential for generating and maintaining stem cells in the CD8+ T cell memory compartment. Following viral infection, CD8+ T cells lacking Myb underwent terminal differentiation and generated fewer stem cell-like central memory cells than did Myb-sufficient T cells. c-Myb acted both as a transcriptional activator of Tcf7 (which encodes the transcription factor Tcf1) to enhance memory development and as a repressor of Zeb2 (which encodes the transcription factor Zeb2) to hinder effector differentiation. Domain-mutagenesis experiments revealed that the transactivation domain of c-Myb was necessary for restraining differentiation, whereas its negative regulatory domain was critical for cell survival. Myb overexpression enhanced CD8+ T cell memory formation, polyfunctionality and recall responses that promoted curative antitumor immunity after adoptive transfer. These findings identify c-Myb as a pivotal regulator of CD8+ T cell stemness and highlight its therapeutic potential.
Seed germination, as an integral stage of crop production, directly affects Zea mays (maize) yield and grain quality. However, the molecular mechanisms of seed germination remain unclear in maize. We performed comparative transcriptome analysis of two maize inbred lines, Yu82 and Yu537A, at two stages of seed germination. Expression profile analysis during seed germination revealed that a total of 3381 and 4560 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in Yu82 and Yu537A at the two stages. Transcription factors were detected from several families, such as the bZIP, ERF, WRKY, MYB and bHLH families, which indicated that these transcription factor families might be involved in driving seed germination in maize. Prominent DEGs were submitted for KEGG enrichment analysis, which included plant hormones, amino acid mechanism, nutrient reservoir, metabolic pathways and ribosome. Of these pathways, genes associated with plant hormones, especially gibberellins, abscisic acid and auxin may be important for early germination in Yu82. In addition, DEGs involved in amino acid mechanism showed significantly higher expression levels in Yu82 than in Yu537A, which indicated that energy supply from soluble sugars and amino acid metabolism may contribute to early germination in Yu82. This results provide novel insights into transcriptional changes and gene interactions in maize during seed germination.
Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) is considered as Rasayana in Indian systems of medicine. This study reports a novel transcriptome of W. somnifera berries, with high depth, quality and coverage. Assembled and annotated transcripts for nearly all genes related with the withanolide biosynthetic pathway was obtained. Tissue-wide gene expression analysis reflected almost similar definitions for terpenoid pathway in leaf, root and berry tissues with relatively higher abundance of transcripts linked with steroid, phenylpropanoid metabolism as well as flavonoid metabolism in berry The metabolome map generated from the data embodied transcripts from 143 metabolic pathways connected together and mediated collectively by about 1792 unique enzyme functions specific to berry, leaf and root tissues, respectively. Transcripts specific to cytochrome p450 (CYP450), methyltransferases and glycosyltransferases were distinctively located in a tissue specific manner and exhibited a complex network. Significant distribution of transcription factor genes such as MYB, ELI, MADS, and WRKY etc was observed, as the major transcriptional regulators of the secondary metabolism. Validation of the assembly was ascertained by cloning WsELI, which has a light dependent regulatory role in development. Quantitative expression of WsELI was observed to be considerably modulated up on exposure to abiotic stress and elicitors. Co-relation of over-expression of WsELI, may provide new aspects for the functional role of ELI proteins in plants linked to secondary metabolism. The study offers the first comprehensive and comparative evaluation of W. somnifera transcriptome data between the three tissues and across other members of Solanaceae (Nicotiana, Solanum and Capsicum) with respect to major pathways and their metabolome regulation.
Germin-like proteins (GLPs) are involved in biotic and abiotic stress tolerance in different plant species. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) genome contains about 40 GLP family member proteins in nine chromosomes. Although some of the rice GLP (OsGLP) promoters have been studied through in silico analysis as well as experimentally, studies regarding the distribution pattern of the biotic and abiotic stress associated transcription factor binding sites (TFbs) in the promoter regions of OsGLP genes have not been attempted thoroughly. Several transcription factors (TFs) namely NAC, WRKY, bHLH, bZIP, MYB and AP2/ERF act as major TFs concerned with biotic as well as abiotic stress responses across various plant species. In the present study the in silico analysis was carried out using the 1.5 kilobases (kb) promoter regions from 40 different OsGLP genes for the presence of NAC, WRKY, bHLH, bZIP, MYB and AP2/ERF TFbs in it. Among various OsGLP gene promoters, OsGLP8-11 was found to contain highest number of tested TFbs in the promoter region whereas the promoter region of OsGLP5-1 depicted least amount of TFbs. Phylogenetic study of promoter regions of different OsGLP genes revealed four different clades. Our analyses could reveal the evolutionary significance of different OsGLP gene promoters. It can be presumed from the present findings as well as previous reports that OsGLP gene duplications and subsequent variations in the TFbs in OsGLP gene promoter regions might be the consequences of neofunctionalization of OsGLP genes and their promoters for biotic and abiotic stress tolerance in rice.
Coumestrol (CMS), a coumestan isoflavone, plays key roles in nodulation through communication with rhizobia, and has been used as phytoestrogens for hormone replacement therapy in humans. Because CMS content is controlled by multiple genetic factors, the genetic basis of CMS biosynthesis has remained unclear. We identified soybean genotypes with consistently high (Daewonkong) or low (SS0903-2B-21-1-2) CMS content over 2 years. We performed RNA sequencing of leaf samples from both genotypes at developmental stage R7, when CMS levels are highest. Within the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway, 41 genes were tightly connected in a functional co-expression gene network; seven of these genes were differentially expressed between two genotypes. We identified 14 candidate genes involved in CMS biosynthesis. Among them, seven were annotated as encoding oxidoreductases that may catalyze the transfer of electrons from daidzein, a precursor of CMS. Two of the other genes, annotated as encoding a MYB domain protein and a MLP-like protein, may increase CMS accumulation in response to stress conditions. Our results will help to complete our understanding of the CMS biosynthetic pathway, and should facilitate development of soybean cultivars with high CMS content that could be used to promote the fitness of plants and human beings.
Linkage maps of muscadine grape generated using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) provide insight into genome collinearity between Muscadinia and Euvitis subgenera and genetic control of flower sex and berry color. The muscadine grape, Vitis rotundifolia, is a specialty crop native to the southeastern USA. Muscadine vines can be male, female, or perfect-flowered, and berry color ranges from bronze to black. Genetic linkage maps were constructed using genotyping-by-sequencing in two F1 populations segregating for flower sex and berry color. The linkage maps consisted of 1244 and 2069 markers assigned to 20 linkage groups (LG) for the 'Black Beauty' × 'Nesbitt' and 'Supreme' × 'Nesbitt' populations, respectively. Data from both populations were used to generate a consensus map with 2346 markers across 20 LGs. A high degree of collinearity was observed between the genetic maps and the Vitis vinifera physical map. The higher chromosome number in muscadine (2n = 40) compared to V. vinifera (2n = 38) was accounted for by the behavior of V. vinifera chromosome 7 as two independently segregating LGs in muscadine. The muscadine sex locus mapped to an interval that aligned to 4.64-5.09 Mb on V. vinifera chromosome 2, a region which includes the previously described V. vinifera subsp. sylvestris sex locus. While the MYB transcription factor genes controlling fruit color in V. vinifera are located on chromosome 2, the muscadine berry color locus mapped to an interval aligning to 11.09-11.88 Mb on V. vinifera chromosome 4, suggesting that a mutation in a different gene in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway determines berry color in muscadine. These linkage maps lay the groundwork for marker-assisted breeding in muscadine and provide insight into the evolution of Vitis species.
The pollen wall is a complex, durable structure essential for plant reproduction. A substantial portion of phenylpropanoids (e.g. flavonols) produced by pollen grain tapetal cells are deposited in the pollen wall. Transcriptional regulation of pollen wall formation has been studied extensively, and a specific regulatory mechanism for Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) pollen flavonol biosynthesis has been postulated. Here, metabolome and transcriptome analyses of anthers from mutant and overexpression genotypes revealed that Arabidopsis MYB99, a putative ortholog of the petunia (Petunia hybrida) floral scent regulator ODORANT1 (ODO1), controls the exclusive production of tapetum diglycosylated flavonols and hydroxycinnamic acid amides. We discovered that MYB99 acts in a regulatory triad with MYB21 and MYB24, orthologs of emission of benzenoids I and II, which together with ODO1 coregulate petunia scent biosynthesis genes. Furthermore, promoter-activation assays showed that MYB99 directs precursor supply from the Calvin cycle and oxidative pentose-phosphate pathway in primary metabolism to phenylpropanoid biosynthesis by controlling TRANSKETOLASE2 expression. We provide a model depicting the relationship between the Arabidopsis MYB triad and structural genes from primary and phenylpropanoid metabolism and compare this mechanism with petunia scent control. The discovery of orthologous protein triads producing related secondary metabolites suggests that analogous regulatory modules exist in other plants and act to regulate various branches of the intricate phenylpropanoid pathway.
MicroRNAs are noncoding RNA molecules of ~ 22 nucleotides with diagnostic and therapeutic action [Curr Drug Targets, 2015. 16(12): p. 1381-403], affecting the expression of mRNAs involved in invasion, migration, and development [Oncotarget, 2015. 6(9): p. 6472-98, Cancer Manag Res, 2014. 6: p. 205-16]. miR-200c is part of the miR-200c/141 cluster on chromosome 12p13. Its mechanism of action when encapsulated is critical in lung cancer when patients express changes in miRNAs. miR-200c be a potential biomarkers for various lung diseases. As a potential therapy, miR-200c can impacts lives as target lung cancer is a leading cause of death with about 234,000 cases annually, high heterogeneity, complex screening, and a 5-year survival rate of 16% [CA Cancer J Clin, 2016.66(1): p. 7-30]. Encapsulated miR-200c efficiently enhances bioavailability, pharmacokinetics of therapeutics and targeting to cells, improves efficacy and provides potential cure.
The functions of miR-200c were determined in non-metastatic KW-634 and metastatic 821-T4 and 821-LN mouse lung cancer cell lines after various Nano vehicle treatments. Viability and cytotoxicity were determined by cell cycle and quantitative real-time PCR analyses were used to quantify levels of miR-200c and its target genes. In situ hybridization was used to visualize patterns of expression of miR-200c and others in the lung and many organs. Next-generation sequencing accession number GSE125000, invasion and migration assays using transwell chambers, and ActivSignal were used to elucidate the activation and inhibition profiles and perform direct expression measurements and modification of cellular components.
Due to their effectiveness as intracellular vesicles transporting miR-200c into, out, and between parts of the cells, miR-200c is encapsulated with cholesterol, an integral part of the biological membranes with very important physical properties of the vehicle. Nano miR-200c showed efficient cellular uptake in KW-634, 821-T4, and 821-LN cells with important changes in gene expression and new isoforms. In KW-634, when treated with encapsulated miR-200c and compare to the non-encapsulated control; miR-29b increased by 5261-fold, and in 821-T4/LN, miR-1247 increased by 150-fold. Conversely, miR-1247 and miR-675 decreased by 348 and 1029.5-fold, respectively. miR-189 decreased by 34-fold in treated 821-T4 cells. A reduction of growth was observed only after 48 h of treatment with Nano miR-200c. Moreover, labeling the vehicle with carboxy-fluorescein showed that the encapsulated particles enter the nucleus and mitochondria. Encapsulated miR-200c by entering the cells, the nucleus and mitochondria, trigger changes in cell cycle phases with 4 up to 12 fold percentage in G2 and S phase respectively compare to miR-200c. Endogenous expression of Nkx2.1, miR-200c, and their targets Myb, Nfib, Six4 and Six1 showed an inverse correlation, as observed in development.
Little is known about miR-200c involvement in regulatory processes. Nano miR-200c affects invasion and migration mechanisms. The expression of encapsulated miR-200c contributes to the inhibition/activation of Kras, EMT, Hippo, regulatory pathways and blockers of metastasis. Delivery of miR-200c increases the expression of miR-29b, an EMY regulator, and miR-1247, an inhibitor of cancer genes, both tumor suppressors involved in lung metastasis. Encapsulated miR-200c act on different proteins that regulates cell cycle pathways. These findings represent a part of a regulatory network providing new insights towards improvement of therapy.
Soil salinization is one of the most crucial abiotic stresses that limit the growth and production of eggplant. The existing researches in eggplant were mostly focused on salt-induced morphological, biochemical and physiological changes, with only limited works centered on salt-response genes in eggplant at the transcriptomic level.
Our preliminary work found that Zhusiqie (No.118) is salt-tolerant and Hongqie (No.30) is salt-sensitive. Consequently, they were re-named as ST118 and SS30, respectively. ST118 showed less damaged on growth and higher K+/Na+ ratios in leaves than SS30. Comparative-transcriptome analysis was used as a powerful approach to understand the salt-response mechanisms in the leaves and roots of SS30 and ST118. And it revealed that genotype-specific and organ-specific manners exist in eggplant in response to salt stress. Strikingly, the genotype-specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in ST118 were considered crucial to its higher salt-tolerance, because the expression patterns of common DEGs in the leaves/roots of the two eggplant genotypes were almost the same. Among them, some transcription factors have been reported to be in response to elevated external salinity, including the members of C2C2-CO-like, WRKY, MYB and NAC family. In addition, the AKT1, KAT1 and SOS1 were up-regulated only in the leaves of ST118. Furthermore, the complementation assays demonstrated that the salt-tolerances of both yeast and Arabidopsis akt1 mutants were enhanced by heterologous expression of SmAKT1.
The comparative-transcriptome analysis indicated that the salt-tolerance can be increased by higher transcript level of some genotype-specific genes. This work revealed that eggplants seem to be more inclined to absorb K+ rather than to exclude Na+ under salt stress conditions because seven K+ transporters were significantly up-regulated, while only one Na+ transporter was similarly regulated. Finally, the complementation assays of SmAKT1, which is genotype-specific up-regulated in ST118, suggest that the other TFs and K+ transport genes were worthy of future investigation for their functions in salinity tolerance.
Maturation of litchi (Litchi chinensis) fruit is characterized by dramatic changes in pigments in the pericarp and flavor compounds in the aril. Among them, the biosynthesis of anthocyanins is most noticeable. Previous studies showed that LcMYB1 and LcbHLH transcription factors participated in regulating the anthocyanin biosynthesis in litchi. However, the roles of other MYB factors remain unclear.
In this study, we cloned and characterized the function of LcMYB5, a novel R2R3-MYB identified from litchi transcriptome. Although LcMYB5 was constitutively expressed in litchi tissues and its expressions was not correlated with tissue coloration, overexpression of LcMYB5 resulted in enhanced biosynthesis of anthocyanins in tobacco and petunia concurrent with the up-regulation of their endogenous bHLHs and key structural genes in anthocyanin precursor biosynthesis. These results indicate that LcMYB5 is an R2R3 transcriptional factor regulates anthocyanin biosynthesis either by directly activating the expression of key structural genes such as DFR or by indirectly up regulating the expressions of endogenous bHLH regulators. More interestingly, the pH values in petals and leaves from transgenic lines were significant lower than those in both untransformed tobacco and petunia, indicating LcMYB5 is also associated with pH regulation. The expressions of LcMYB5 and its bHLH partner LcbHLH1 were consistent with the expression of putative tissue acidification gene LcPH1, and the changes in malic acid provided further evidence for the close relationship between LcMYB5 and tissue acidification.
Taking together, our study indicated that LcMYB5 is involved in not only anthocyanin biosynthesis but also tissue acidification.
Genetic manipulation of genes to upregulate specific branches of metabolic pathways is a method that is commonly used to improve fruit quality. However, the use of a single gene to impact several metabolic pathways is difficult. Here, we show that overexpression of the single gene SlMYB75 (SlMYB75-OE) is effective at improving multiple fruit quality traits. In these engineered fruits, the anthocyanin content reached 1.86 mg g-1 fresh weight at the red-ripe stage, and these SlMYB75-OE tomatoes displayed a series of physiological changes, including delayed ripening and increased ethylene production. In addition to anthocyanin, the total contents of phenolics, flavonoids and soluble solids in SlMYB75-OE fruits were enhanced by 2.6, 4, and 1.2 times, respectively, compared to those of wild-type (WT) fruits. Interestingly, a number of aroma volatiles, such as aldehyde, phenylpropanoid-derived and terpene volatiles, were significantly increased in SlMYB75-OE fruits, with some terpene volatiles showing more than 10 times higher levels than those in WT fruits. Consistent with the metabolic assessment, transcriptomic profiling indicated that the genes involved in the ethylene signaling, phenylpropanoid and isoprenoid pathways were greatly upregulated in SlMYB75-OE fruits. Yeast one-hybrid and transactivation assays revealed that SlMYB75 is able to directly bind to the MYBPLANT and MYBPZM cis-regulatory elements and to activate the promoters of the LOXC, AADC2 and TPS genes. The identification of SlMYB75 as a key regulator of fruit quality attributes through the transcriptional regulation of downstream genes involved in several metabolic pathways opens new avenues towards engineering fruits with a higher sensory and nutritional quality.
Lily R3-MYB transcription factors are involved in negative regulation to limit anthocyanin accumulation in lily flowers and leaves and create notable color patterns on ectopically expressed petunia flowers. In eudicots, both positive and negative regulators act to precisely regulate the level of anthocyanin accumulation. The R3-MYB transcription factor is among the main factors repressing anthocyanin biosynthesis. Although, in monocots, the positive regulators have been well characterized, the negative regulators have not been examined. Two R3-MYBs, LhR3MYB1 and LhR3MYB2, which were identified in lily transcriptomes, were characterized in this study to understand the regulatory mechanisms of anthocyanin biosynthesis. LhR3MYB1 and LhR3MYB2 had a C2 suppressor motif downstream of a single MYB repeat; the similar amino acid motif appears only in AtMYBL2 among the eudicot R3-MYB proteins. Stable and transient overexpression of LhR3MYB1 and LhR3MYB2 in tobacco plants showed suppression of anthocyanin biosynthesis by both; however, suppression by LhR3MYB2 was stronger than that by LhR3MYB1. In the lily plant, the LhR3MYB2 transcript was detected in leaves with light stimulus-induced anthocyanin accumulation and in pink tepals. Although LhR3MYB1 was expressed in some, but not all tepals, its expression was not linked to anthocyanin accumulation. In addition, LhR3MYB1 expression levels in the leaves remained unchanged by the light stimulus, and LhR3MYB1 transcripts predominantly accumulated in the ovaries, which did not accumulate anthocyanins. Thus, although LhR3MYB1 and LhR3MYB2 have an ability to repress anthocyanin accumulation, LhR3MYB2 is more strongly involved in the negative regulation to limit the accumulation than that by LhR3MYB1. In addition, the overexpression of LhR3MYB2 generated notable color patterns in petunia flowers; thus, the usefulness of the LhR3MYB genes for creating unique color patterns by genetic engineering is discussed.
Stone cells negatively affect fruit quality because of their firm and lignified cell walls, so are targets for reduction in pear breeding programmes. However, there is only limited knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of stone cells. Here, we show that PbrMYB169, an R2R3 MYB transcription factor, of Pyrus bretschneideri positively regulates lignification of stone cells in pear fruit. PbrMYB169 was shown to be co-expressed with lignin biosynthesis genes during pear fruit development, and this co-expression pattern was coincident with stone cell formation in the fruit of Pyrus bretschneideri 'Dangshansuli'. The PbrMYB169 expression level was also positively correlated with stone cell content in 36 pear cultivars tested. PbrMYB169 protein significantly activated the promoter of lignin genes C3H1, CCR1, CCOMT2, CAD, 4CL1, 4CL2, HCT2, and LAC18 via binding to AC elements [ACC(T/A)ACC] in these promoters. Furthermore, overexpression of PbrMYB169 in transgenic Arabidopsis plants enhanced the expression of lignin genes, and increased lignin deposition and cell wall thickness of vessel elements, but did not change the ratio of syringyl and guaiacyl lignin monomers. In conclusion, PbrMYB169 appears to be a transcriptional activator of lignin biosynthesis and regulates secondary wall formation in fruit stone cells. This study advances the understanding of the regulation of lignin biosynthesis and provides valuable molecular genetic information for reducing stone cell content in pear fruit.
Transcription factor MYB59 is involved in plant growth and stress responses by acting as negative regulator of Ca signalling and homeostasis. The Arabidopsis thaliana transcription factor MYB59 is induced by cadmium (Cd) and plays a key role in the regulation of cell cycle progression and root elongation, but its mechanism of action is poorly understood. We investigated the expression of MYB59 and differences between wild-type plants, the myb59 mutant and MYB59-overexpressing lines (obtained by transformation in the mutant genotype) during plant growth and in response to various forms of stress. We also compared the transcriptomes of wild-type and myb59 mutant plants to determine putative MYB59 targets. The myb59 mutant has longer roots, smaller leaves and smaller cells than wild-type plants and responds differently to stress in germination assay. Transcriptomic analysis revealed the upregulation in the myb59 mutant of multiple genes involved in calcium (Ca) homeostasis and signalling, including those encoding calmodulin-like proteins and Ca transporters. Notably, MYB59 was strongly induced by Ca deficiency, and the myb59 mutant was characterized by higher levels of cytosolic Ca in root cells and showed a modest alteration of Ca transient frequency in guard cells, associated with the absence of Ca-induced stomatal closure. These results indicate that MYB59 negatively regulates Ca homeostasis and signalling during Ca deficiency, thus controlling plant growth and stress responses.
Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus (CGMMV) is a member of the genus Tobamovirus, which cause diseases in cucurbits, especially watermelon. In watermelon, symptoms develop on the whole plant, including leaves, stems, peduncles, and fruit. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of watermelon early responses to CGMMV infection, a comparative transcriptome analysis of 24 h CGMMV-infected and mock-inoculated watermelon leaves was performed. A total of 1641 differently expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, with 886 DEGs upregulated and 755 DEGs downregulated after CGMMV infection. A functional analysis indicated that the DEGs were involved in photosynthesis, plant⁻pathogen interactions, secondary metabolism, and plant hormone signal transduction. In addition, a few transcription factor families, including WRKY, MYB, HLH, bZIP and NAC, were responsive to the CGMMV-induced stress. To confirm the high-throughput sequencing results, 15 DEGs were validated by qRT-PCR analysis. The results provide insights into the identification of candidate genes or pathways involved in the responses of watermelon leaves to CGMMV infection.
The phenylpropanoid pathway gives rise to lignin, flavonoids, and other metabolites and is regulated by MYB transcription factors. Many R2R3-MYB transcriptional activators are known, but the prevalence of MYB repressors has only recently become recognized. This review article summarizes recent progress on function and mechanism of these MYB repressors. The characterized phenylpropanoid R2R3-MYB repressors comprise two phylogenetic clades that act on the lignin and general phenylpropanoid genes, or the flavonoid genes, respectively; anthocyanin R3-MYB repressors form a separate clade. While some flavonoid MYBs repressors can bind basic-helix-loop-helix factors and disrupt the MBW complex, for the lignin repressor MYBs interactions with promoter cis-elements have been demonstrated. The role of the conserved repression motifs that define the MYB repressors is not yet known, however.
The circadian clock regulates numerous biological processes in plants, especially development and stress responses. CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) is one of the core components of the day-night rhythm response and is reportedly associated with ambient temperature in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, it remains unknown if alternative splicing of ZmCCA1 is modulated by external stress in maize, such as drought stress and photoperiod. Here, we identified three ZmCCA1 splice variants in the tropical maize line CML288, which are predicted to encode three different protein isoforms, i.e., ZmCCA1.1, ZmCCA1.2, and ZmCCA1.3, which all retain the MYB domain. In maize, the expression levels of ZmCCA1 splice variants were influenced by photoperiod, tissue type, and drought stress. In transgenic A. thaliana, ZmCCA1.1 may be more effective than ZmCCA1.3 in increasing drought tolerance while ZmCCA1.2 may have only a small effect on tolerance to drought stress. Additionally, although CCA1 genes have been found in many plant species, alternative CCA1 splicing events are known to occur in species-specific ways. Our study provides new sight to explore the function of ZmCCA1 splice variants' response to abiotic stress, and clarify the linkage between circadian clock and environmental stress in maize.
The MYB transcription factor (TF) superfamily, one of the largest gene superfamilies, regulates a variety of physiological processes in plants. Although many MYB superfamily genes have been identified in plants, the MYB TFs in Chinese jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) have not been fully identified and characterized. Additionally, the functions of these genes remain unclear. In total, we identified 171 MYB superfamily genes in jujube and divided them into five subfamilies containing 99 genes of the R2R3-MYB subfamily, 58 genes of the MYB-related subfamily, four genes of the R1R2R3-MYB subfamily, one gene of the 4R-MYB subfamily, and nine genes of the atypical MYB subfamily. The 99 R2R3-MYB genes of jujube were divided into 35 groups, C1-C35, and the 58 MYB-related genes were divided into the following groups: the R-R-type, CCA1-like, I-box-binding-like, TBP-like, CPC-like, and Chinese jujube-specific groups. ZjMYB genes in jujube were well supported by additional highly conserved motifs and exon/intron structures. Most R1 repeats of MYB-related proteins comprised the R2 repeat and had highly conserved EED and EEE residue groups in jujube. Three tandem duplicated gene pairs were found on 12 chromosomes in jujube. According to an expression analysis of 126 ZjMYB genes, MYB-related genes played important roles in jujube development and fruit-related biological processes. The total flavonoid content of jujube fruit decreased as ripening progressed. A total of 93 expressed genes were identified in the RNA-sequencing data from jujube fruit, and 56 ZjMYB members presented significant correlations with total flavonoid contents by correlation analysis. Five pairs of paralogous MYB genes within jujube were composed of nine jujube MYB genes. A total of 14 ZjMYB genes had the same homology to the MYB genes of Arabidopsis and peach, indicating that these 14 MYB genes and their orthologs probably existed before the ancestral divergence of the MYB superfamily. We used a synteny analysis of MYB genes between jujube and Arabidopsis to predict that the functions of the ZjMYBs involve flavonoid/phenylpropanoid metabolism, the light signaling pathway, auxin signal transduction, and responses to various abiotic stresses (cold, drought, and salt stresses). Additionally, we speculate that ZjMYB108 is an important TF involved in the flavonoid metabolic pathway. This comprehensive analysis of MYB superfamily genes in jujube lay a solid foundation for future comprehensive analyses of ZjMYB gene functions.
Anthocyanin pigments play many roles in plants, including providing protection against biotic and abiotic stresses. To identify new regulatory genes in apple (Malus domestica) that may be involved in regulating low temperature induced anthocyanin biosynthesis, we performed RNA-seq analysis of leaves from the 'Gala' apple cultivar following exposure to a low temperature (16 °C). A visible red color appeared on the upper leaves and the anthocyanin content increased significantly after the low temperature treatment. Genes from the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway were significantly enriched among the differentially expressed genes, and the expression of several transcription factors was shown by WGCNA (weighted gene co-expression network analysis) to correlate with anthocyanin accumulation, including members of the MYB, MADS, WRKY, WD40, Zinc Finger and HB-ZIP families. Three MYB transcription factors (MdMYB12, MdMYB22 and MdMYB114), which had several CBF/DREB response elements in their promoters, were significantly induced by low temperature exposure and their expression also correlated highly with anthocyanin accumulation. We hypothesize that they may act as regulators of anthocyanin biosynthesis and be regulated by CBF/DREB transcription factors in apple leaves under low temperature conditions. The analyses presented here provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying anthocyanin accumulation during low temperature exposure.
Purple carrots can accumulate large quantities of anthocyanins in their roots and -in some genetic backgrounds- petioles, and therefore they represent an excellent dietary source of antioxidant phytonutrients. In a previous study, using linkage analysis in a carrot F2 mapping population segregating for root and petiole anthocyanin pigmentation, we identified a region in chromosome 3 with co-localized QTL for all anthocyanin pigments of the carrot root, whereas petiole pigmentation segregated as a single dominant gene and mapped to one of these "root pigmentation" regions conditioning anthocyanin biosynthesis. In the present study, we performed fine mapping combined with gene expression analyses (RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR) to identify candidate genes controlling anthocyanin pigmentation in the carrot root and petiole. Fine mapping was performed in four carrot populations with different genetic backgrounds and patterns of pigmentation. The regions controlling root and petiole pigmentation in chromosome 3 were delimited to 541 and 535 kb, respectively. Genome wide prediction of transcription factor families known to regulate the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway coupled with orthologous and phylogenetic analyses enabled the identification of a cluster of six MYB transcription factors, denominated DcMYB6 to DcMYB11, associated with the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis. No anthocyanin biosynthetic genes were present in this region. Comparative transcriptome analysis indicated that upregulation of DcMYB7 was always associated with anthocyanin pigmentation in both root and petiole tissues, whereas DcMYB11 was only upregulated with pigmentation in petioles. In the petiole, the level of expression of DcMYB11 was higher than DcMYB7. DcMYB6, a gene previously suggested as a key regulator of carrot anthocyanin biosynthesis, was not consistently associated with pigmentation in either tissue. These results strongly suggest that DcMYB7 is a candidate gene for root anthocyanin pigmentation in all the genetic backgrounds included in this study. DcMYB11 is a candidate gene for petiole pigmentation in all the purple carrot sources in this study. Since DcMYB7 is co-expressed with DcMYB11 in purple petioles, the latter gene may act also as a co-regulator of anthocyanin pigmentation in the petioles. This study provides linkage-mapping and functional evidence for the candidacy of these genes for the regulation of carrot anthocyanin biosynthesis.
The red flesh trait gives red pitayas more healthful components and a higher price, while the genetic mechanism behind this trait is unknown. In this manuscript, transcriptome analysis was employed to discover the genetic differences between white and red flesh in pitayas. A total of 27.99 Gb clean data were obtained for four samples. Unigenes, 79,049 in number, were generated with an average length of 1333 bp, and 52,618 Unigenes were annotated. Compared with white flesh, the expression of 10,215 Unigenes was up-regulated, and 4853 Unigenes were down-regulated in red flesh. The metabolic pathways accounted for 64.6% of all differentially expressed Unigenes in KEGG pathways. The group with high betalain content in red flesh and all structural genes, related to betalain biosynthesis, had a higher expression in red flesh than white flesh. The expression of the key gene, tyrosine hydroxylase CYP76AD1, was up-regulated 245.08 times, while 4,5-DOPA dioxygenase DODA was up-regulated 6.46 times. Moreover, the special isomers CYP76AD1α and DODAα were only expressed in red flesh. The competitive anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway had a lower expression in red flesh. Two MYB transcription factors were of the same branch as BvMYB1, regulating betalain biosynthesis in beet, and those transcription factors had expression differences in two kinds of pitayas, which indicated that they should be candidate genes controlling betalain accumulation in red pitayas. This research would benefit from identifying the major gene controlling red flesh trait and breed new cultivars with the red flesh trait. Future research should aim to prove the role of each candidate gene in betalain biosynthesis in red pitayas.
Stem gall (Protomyces macrosporus Unger), a serious disease that affects leaves, petioles, stems and fruits of coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.) causing heavy loss in yield. Genetic improvement of coriander for stem gall disease is indispensable. Coriander cultivars of stem gall resistance (ACr-1) and susceptible (CS-6) leaf samples were utilized and transcriptome sequenced using Illumina NextSeq500 platform. After trimming low-quality reads and adapter sequences, a total of 49,163,108 and 43,746,120 high-quality reads were retained and further assembly resulted validated transcripts of 59,933 and 56,861. We have predicted 52,506 and 48,858 coding sequences (CDS) ofwhich 50,506 and 46,945 were annotated using NCBInr database. Gene ontology analysis annotated 19,099 and 17,625 terms; pathway analysis obtained 24 different functional pathway categories; signal transduction, transport, catabolism, translation and carbohydrate metabolism pathways etc. were dominated. Differentially expressed genes analysis predicted 13,123 CDS commonly expressed of which 431 and 400 genes were significantly upregulated and downregulated, respectively, in which Rgenes, stress inducible transcription factors such as ERF, NAC, bZIP, MYB, DREB and WRKY and antifungal related genes were predicted. The real-time PCR analysis of HSP20 gene expression in resistance showed upregulation by 10-fold over susceptible sample and 18s used as a housekeeping gene for normalization. The present results provide an insights into various aspects underlying the development of resistance to stem gall in coriander.
Cell cycle arrest is an active response to stresses that enables organisms to survive under fluctuating environmental conditions. While signalling pathways that inhibit cell cycle progression have been elucidated, the putative core module orchestrating cell cycle arrest in response to various stresses is still elusive. Here we report that in Arabidopsis, the NAC-type transcription factors ANAC044 and ANAC085 are required for DNA damage-induced G2 arrest. Under genotoxic stress conditions, ANAC044 and ANAC085 enhance protein accumulation of the R1R2R3-type Myb transcription factor (Rep-MYB), which represses G2/M-specific genes. ANAC044/ANAC085-dependent accumulation of Rep-MYB and cell cycle arrest are also observed in the response to heat stress that causes G2 arrest, but not to osmotic stress that retards G1 progression. These results suggest that plants deploy the ANAC044/ANAC085-mediated signalling module as a hub which perceives distinct stress signals and leads to G2 arrest.
Ampelopsis megalophylla is an important species used in Chinese folk medicine. Flavonoids, the most important active components of plants, greatly determine the quality of A. megalophylla. However, biosynthesis of flavonoids at the molecular and genetic levels in A. megalophylla is not well understood. In this study, we performed chemical analysis and transcriptome analysis of A. megalophylla in different seasons (i.e., May, August, and October). Accumulation of flavonoids was higher in May than in the other two months. Genes involved in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway, such as chalcone synthase, anthocyanidin synthase, flavanone 3-hydroxylase, flavonoid-3',5'-hydroxylase, caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, flavonoid 3'-monooxygenase, shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase, and leucoanthocyanidin reductase, were identified based on transcriptome data. Fifty ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter, nine SNARE, forty-nine GST, and eighty-four glycosyltransferases unigenes related to flavonoid transport and biomodification were also found. Moreover, seventy-eight cytochrome P450s and multiple transcription factors (five MYB, two bHLH, and three WD40 family genes) may be associated with the regulation of the flavonoid biosynthesis process. These results provide insights into the molecular processes of flavonoid biosynthesis in A. megalophylla and offer a significant resource for the application of genetic engineering in developing varieties with improved quality.
The oncogene yes-associated protein (YAP) is a key modifier of liver homeostasis and regulates mitosis in hepatocytes as well as in malignantly transformed cells. However, the question of how YAP supports cell proliferation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not well understood. Here we identified U2AF momology motif kinase 1 (UHMK1) as a direct transcriptional target of YAP and the transcription factor forkhead box M1 (FOXM1), which supports HCC cell proliferation but not migration. Indeed, UHMK1 stimulates the expression of genes that are specific for cell cycle regulation and which are known downstream effectors of YAP. By using BioID labeling and mass spectrometry, the dimerization partner, RB-like, E2F and multi-vulval class B (DREAM) complex constituent MYB proto-oncogene like 2 (MYBL2, B-MYB) was identified as a direct UHMK1 interaction partner. Like YAP, UHMK1 stimulates nuclear enrichment of MYBL2, which is associated HCC cell proliferation and the expression of the cell cycle regulators CCNB1, CCNB2, KIF20A, and MAD2L1. The association between YAP, UHMK1, MYBL2, and proliferation was confirmed in YAPS127A-transgenic mice and human HCC tissues. In summary, we provide a model by which YAP supports cell proliferation through the induction of important cell cycle regulators in a UHMK1- and MYBL2-dependent manner.
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a highly heterogeneous malignancy with various outcomes, and therefore needs better risk stratification tools to help select optimal therapeutic options.
In this study, we identify miRNAs that could predict clinical outcome in a heterogeneous AML population using TCGA dataset.
We found that MiR-363 is a novel prognostic factor in AML patients undergoing chemotherapy. In multivariable analyses, high miR-363 remained predictive for shorter OS (HR = 2.349, P = 0.012) and EFS (HR = 2.082, P = 0.001) independent of other well-known prognostic factors. More importantly, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) overcame the adverse outcomes related to high miR-363 expression. In gene expression profiling, high miR-363 expression was positively correlated with the amounts of leukemogenic transcription factors, including Myb, RUNX3, GATA3, IKZF3, ETS1 and MLLT3. Notably, we found that the in silico predicted target genes (EZH2, KLF6 and PTEN) of miR-363 were downregulated in association with high miR-363 expression.
In summary, miR-363 expression may help identify patients in need of strategies to select the optimal therapy between chemotherapeutic and allo-HCST regimens. AML patients with high miR-363 expression may be highly recommended for early allo-HSCT regimen.
Secondary cell wall (SCW) thickening provides the mechanical force for anther dehiscence and plays an important role in the formation of xylem structure. We have previously reported that γMYB2, a MYB coiled-coil protein, directly binds to the P1BS cis-element of the PLA2-γ promoter and acts as a co-activator of γMYB1 in controlling the expression of PLA2-γ. In this study, we analyzed morphological phenotypes of the constitutive overexpression (γMYB2-OE) and knock-down (γMYB2-KD) lines of γMYB2. We found that γMYB2 overexpression caused the collapse of the endothecium layer, thereby suppressing anther dehiscence and forming short infertile siliques. The γMYB2-OE also showed less cellulose deposition in the xylem and had a longer primary stem than the wild-type, while γMYB2-KD had greater cellulose accumulation and a shorter primary stem than the wild-type. We demonstrated that the male sterility and the longer primary stem in γMYB2-OE were caused by reduced expression of SCW thickening-related genes. Our results suggest that γMYB2 acts as a negative regulator in controlling the SCW thickening in Arabidopsis.
Anthocyanins in apple species are important secondary metabolites that are beneficial for human health. Previous studies revealed that methyl jasmonate (MeJA) promotes anthocyanin accumulation by up-regulating the transcription of related genes. In this study, we isolated a jasmonate (JA)-induced apple MYB gene, MdMYB24-like (MdMYB24L). The encoded nuclear protein contains a conserved R2R3 domain and is homologous to Arabidopsis thaliana AtMYB24. Additionally, MdMYB24L was observed to interact with JA signaling factors (MdJAZ8, MdJAZ11, and MdMYC2) in yeast and in planta. The MdMYC2 protein was also targeted by MdJAZ8 and MdJAZ11, which are rapidly degraded under MeJA treatment. The overexpression of MdMYB24L resulted in higher anthocyanin contents in the transgenic apple 'Orin' calli than in the wild-type control calli. Moreover, the expression levels of the anthocyanin biosynthesis structural genes MdUFGT and MdDFR were up-regulated in the transgenic calli. Furthermore, MdMYB24L positively regulated the transcription of MdDFR and MdUFGT by binding to the MYB-binding site motifs in their promoters. Interestingly, the interaction between MdMYC2 and MdMYB24L further enhanced the transcription of MdUFGT, whereas MdJAZ8 and MdJAZ11 attenuated this effect. We herein provide new details regarding the molecular mechanism by which MYB transcription factors help regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis via JA signaling pathways.
Premature senescence can reduce the yield and quality of crops. WRKY transcription factors (TFs) play important roles during leaf senescence, but little is known about their ageing mechanisms in cotton.
In this study, a group III WRKY TF, GhWRKY27, was isolated and characterized. The expression of GhWRKY27 was induced by leaf senescence and was higher in an early-ageing cotton variety than in a non-early-ageing cotton variety. Overexpression of GhWRKY27 in Arabidopsis promoted leaf senescence, as determined by reduced chlorophyll content and elevated expression of senescence-associated genes (SAGs). Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays showed that GhWRKY27 interacted with an MYB TF, GhTT2. Putative target genes of GhWRKY27 were identified via chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq). Yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) revealed that GhWRKY27 binds directly to the promoters of cytochrome P450 94C1 (GhCYP94C1) and ripening-related protein 2 (GhRipen2-2). In addition, the expression patterns of GhTT2, GhCYP94C1 and GhRipen2-2 were identified during leaf senescence. Transient dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated that GhWRKY27 could activate the expression of GhCYP94C1 and GhRipen2-2.
Our work lays the foundation for further study of the functional roles of WRKY genes during leaf senescence in cotton. In addition, our data provide new insights into the senescence-associated mechanisms of WRKY genes in cotton.
Many Actinidia cultivars are characterized by anthocyanin accumulation, specifically in the inner pericarp, but the underlying regulatory mechanism remains elusive. Here we report two interacting transcription factors, AcMYB123 and AcbHLH42, that regulate tissue-specific anthocyanin biosynthesis in the inner pericarp of Actinidia chinensis cv. Hongyang. Through transcriptome profiling analysis we identified five MYB and three bHLH transcription factors that were upregulated in the inner pericarp. We show that the combinatorial action of two of them, AcMYB123 and AcbHLH42, is required for activating promoters of AcANS and AcF3GT1 that encode the dedicated enzymes for anthocyanin biosynthesis. The presence of anthocyanin in the inner pericarp appears to be tightly associated with elevated expression of AcMYB123 and AcbHLH42. RNA interference repression of AcMYB123, AcbHLH42, AcF3GT1 and AcANS in 'Hongyang' fruits resulted in significantly reduced anthocyanin biosynthesis. Using both transient assays in Nicotiana tabacum leaves or Actinidia arguta fruits and stable transformation in Arabidopsis, we demonstrate that co-expression of AcMYB123 and AcbHLH42 is a prerequisite for anthocyanin production by activating transcription of AcF3GT1 and AcANS or the homologous genes. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that AcMYB123 or AcbHLH42 are closely related to TT2 or TT8, respectively, which determines proanthocyanidin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis, and to anthocyanin regulators in monocots rather than regulators in dicots. All these experimental results suggest that AcMYB123 and AcbHLH42 are the components involved in spatiotemporal regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis specifically in the inner pericarp of kiwifruit.
Phosphofructokinase plays an essential role in sugar metabolism in plants. Plants possess two types of phosphofructokinase proteins for phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate, the pyrophosphate-dependent fructose-6-phosphate phosphotransferase (PFP), and the ATP-dependent phosphofructokinase (PFK). Until now, the gene evolution, expression patterns, and functions of phosphofructokinase proteins were unknown in pear. In this report, 14 phosphofructokinase genes were identified in pear. The phylogenetic tree indicated that the phosphofructokinase gene family could be grouped into two subfamilies, with 10 genes belonging to the PbPFK subfamily, and 4 genes belonging to the PbPFP subfamily. Conserved motifs and exon numbers of the phosphofructokinase were found in pear and other six species. The evolution analysis indicated that WGD/Segmental and dispersed duplications were the main duplication models for the phosphofructokinase genes expansion in pear and other six species. Analysis of cis-regulatory element sequences of all phosphofructokinase genes identified light regulation and the MYB binding site in the promoter of all pear phosphofructokinase genes, suggesting that phosphofructokinase might could be regulated by light and MYB transcription factors (TFs). Gene expression patterns revealed that PbPFP1 showed similar pattern with sorbitol contents, suggesting important contributions to sugar accumulation during fruit development. Further functional analysis indicated that the phosphofructokinase gene PbPFP1 was localized on plasma membrane compartment, indicating that PbPFP1 had function in plasma membrane. Transient transformation of PbPFP1 in pear fruits led to significant increases of fructose and sorbitol compared to controls. Overall, our study provides important insights into the gene expression patterns and important potential functions of phosphofructokinase for sugar accumulation in pear fruits, which will help to enrich understanding of sugar-related bio-pathways and lay the molecular basis for fruit quality improvement.
The function of the plant hormone jasmonic acid (JA) in the development of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) flowers was analyzed with a mutant defective in JA perception (jasmonate-insensitive1-1, jai1-1). In contrast to Arabidopsis thaliana JA-insensitive plants, which are male sterile, the tomato jai1-1 mutant is female sterile, with major defects in female development. To identify putative JA-dependent regulatory components, we performed transcriptomics on ovules from flowers at three developmental stages from wild type and jai1-1 mutants. One of the strongly down-regulated genes in jai1-1 encodes the MYB transcription factor SlMYB21. Its Arabidopsis orthologue plays a crucial role in JA-regulated stamen development. SlMYB21 was shown here to exhibit transcription factor activity in yeast, to interact with SlJAZ9 in yeast and in planta, and to complement Arabidopsis myb21-5. To analyze SlMYB21 function, we generated CRISPR/Cas9 mutants and identified a TILLING mutant. These mutants showed female sterility, corroborating a function of MYB21 in tomato ovule development. Transcriptomics analysis of wild type, jai1-1 and myb21-2 carpels revealed processes that might be controlled by SlMYB21. The data suggest positive regulation of JA biosynthesis by SlMYB21, but negative regulation of auxin and gibberellins. The results demonstrate that SlMYB21 mediates at least partially the action of JA and might control the flower to fruit transition.
Wild and cultivated rice show a significant difference in anthocyanin biosynthesis in the leaf. The regulation system of anthocyanin biosynthesis in rice leaf and the causal mechanism of the difference in this biosynthesis between wild and cultivated rice remain largely unknown. In this study, a genome-wide association study and transcriptome analysis were performed to identify the determinant factors and dissect the regulatory system for anthocyanin biosynthesis in rice leaves. OsC1, OsRb and OsDFR were identified as the determinants of anthocyanin biosynthesis in rice leaves. Artificial selection of certain null mutations of OsC1 and OsRb was the main causal mechanism underlying the loss of anthocyanin pigmentation in most cultivated rice. OsP1 and the MYB-bHLH-WD40 complexes regulate anthocyanin biosynthetic genes in rice leaves with partial functional overlap. OsP1 specifically activates upstream biosynthetic genes (OsCHS, OsCHI and OsF3'H) for anthocyanin biosynthesis, whereas the ternary MYB-bHLH-WD40 complex activates all anthocyanin biosynthetic genes including OsCHS, OsCHI, OsF3'H, OsF3H, OsDFR and OsANS. OsC1 and OsRb are tissue-specific regulators that do not influence anthocyanin biosynthesis in the pericarp. Our results reveal the determinant factors, regulatory system and domestication of anthocyanin biosynthesis in rice leaves, and show the potential of engineering anthocyanin biosynthesis in rice.
The cultivated potato Solanum tuberosum L. is the fourth most important crop worldwide. Anthocyanins synthesis and accumulation in potato tissues are considered as one of important traits related to stress resistance and nutritional value. It is considered that the major regulatory gene for anthocyanin biosynthesis is R2R3 MYB-encoding gene StAN1. However, the genetic control of pigmentation of different potato tissues is substantially under investigated. The development of genetic markers for breeding of potato with specific pigmentation pattern remains an actual task.
We investigated 36 potato varieties and hybrids with different pigmentation of tubers and leaves. Sequence organization of regulatory R2R3 MYB (StAN1, StMYBA1, StMYB113), bHLH (StbHLH1, StJAF13) and WD40 (StWD40) genes potentially controlling anthocyanin biosynthesis has been evaluated. The results demonstrated a high variability in the StAN1 third exon and promoter region with the exception for 35 bp, containing elements for the transcription start and activation of gene expression in roots. The analysis of transcriptional activity of genes coding R2R3 MYBs, bHLHs and WD40 transcriptional factors in leaves of eight potato genotypes with different anthocyanin pigmentation was performed. The results showed a relation between the gene expression level and plant pigmentation only for the StAN1 and StWD40 genes, while other studied genes had either strong expression in all varieties and hybrids (StMYBA1, StbHLH1 and StJAF13) or they were not expressed at all (StMYB113).
It was found that StAN1 is the major regulatory gene controlling potato anthocyanin synthesis. However, diagnostic markers developed for the functional StAN1 alleles (StAN1777 and StAN1816) can not be used efficiently for prediction of potato pigmentation patterns. It is likely that the sequence organization of StAN1 promoter is important for anthocyanin synthesis control and the development of additional diagnostic markers is necessary.
Nickel oxide nanoparticles (NiO NPs) are utilized in various industries and their release into the environment may lead to the pollution of agricultural areas. However, assessing the toxicity of NiO NPs in major food crops is difficult due to the limited information available on their toxicity. The present investigation was carried out to evaluate how NiO NPs affect plant growth, photosynthetic efficiency, and phytochemical content, as well as changes at the transcriptional level of these phytochemicals in Chinese cabbage seedlings. Chlorophyll, carotenoid, and sugar contents were reduced, while proline and the anthocyanins were significantly upregulated in NiO NPs-treated seedlings. The levels of malondialdehyde, hydrogen peroxide, and reactive oxygen species, as well as peroxidase (POD) enzyme activity, were all enhanced in seedlings exposed to NiO NPs. The levels of glucosinolates and phenolic compounds were also significantly increased in NiO NPs-treated seedlings compared to control seedlings. The expression of genes related to oxidative stress (CAT, POD, and GST), MYB transcription factors (BrMYB28, BrMYB29, BrMYB34, and BrMYB51), and phenolic compounds (ANS, PAP1, and PAL) were significantly upregulated. We suggest that NiO NPs application stimulates toxic effects and enhances the levels of phytochemicals (glucosinolates and phenolic compounds) in Chinese cabbage seedlings.
Mutations at the N- or C-terminus of C/EBPα are frequent in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with normal karyotype. Here, we investigate the role of the transcription factor Myb in AMLs driven by different combinations of CEBPA mutations. Using knockdown of Myb in murine cell lines modelling the spectrum of CEBPA mutations, we show that the effect of reduced Myb depends on the mutational status of the two Cebpa alleles. Importantly, Myb knockdown fails to override the block in myeloid differentiation in cells with biallelic N-terminal C/EBPα mutations, demonstrating for the first time that the dependency on Myb is much lower in AML with this mutational profile. By comparing gene expression following Myb knockdown and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data for the binding of C/EBPα isoforms, we provide evidence for a functional cooperation between C/EBPα and Myb in the maintenance of AML. This co-dependency breaks down when both alleles of CEBPA harbour N-terminal mutations, as a subset of C/EBPα-regulated genes only bind the short p30 C/EBPα isoform and, unlike other C/EBPα-regulated genes, do so without a requirement for Myb.
Tcrd and Tcrg display identical developmental programs that depend on the activity of the enhancers Eδ and Eγ being "on" in pre-β-selection thymocytes to activate transcription and V(D)J recombination of the unrearranged genes and "off" in post-β-selection CD4+CD8+ double-positive thymocytes to inhibit transcription of the rearranged genes and avoid the expression of TCR δ- and TCR γ-chains in αβ T lymphocytes. Eδ and Eγ activity depends on transcription factor binding to essential Runx and Myb sites and parallels that of Notch signaling. We performed Notch gain- and loss-of-function experiments and found that Notch signaling activates Tcrd and Tcrg transcription by favoring the recruitment of RUNX1 and MYB to the enhancers. Our results suggest that the dissociation of RUNX1 and MYB from Eδ and Eγ chromatin in double-positive thymocytes, which results in enhancer inactivation, is caused by decreased Notch signaling triggered by pre-TCR signaling, thereby deciphering the molecular mechanism of Tcrd and Tcrg silencing during β-selection. These findings reveal a novel molecular mechanism for gene regulation via Notch signaling through the recruitment of RUNX1 and MYB to enhancer chromatin during thymocyte development.
Oxidation of methionine to methionine sulfoxide is a type of posttranslational modification reversed by methionine sulfoxide reductases (Msrs), which present an exceptionally high number of gene copies in plants. The side-form general antioxidant function-specific role of each Msr isoform has not been fully studied. Thirty homologous genes of Msr type A (MsrA) and type B (MsrB) that originate from the genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana, Populus trichocarpa, and Oryza sativa were analyzed in silico. From 109 to 201 transcription factors and responsive elements were predicted for each gene. Among the species, 220 and 190 common transcription factors and responsive elements were detected for the MsrA and MsrB isoforms, respectively. In a comparison of 14 MsrA and 16 MsrB genes, 424 transcription factors and responsive elements were reported in both types of genes, with almost ten times fewer unique elements. The transcription factors mainly comprised plant growth and development regulators, transcription factors important in stress responses with significant overrepresentation of the myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog (MYB) and no apical meristem, Arabidopsis transcription activation factor and cup-shaped cotyledon (NAC) families and responsive elements sensitive to ethylene, jasmonate, sugar, and prolamine. Gene Ontology term-based functional classification revealed that cellular, metabolic, and developmental process terms and the response to stimulus term dominated in the biological process category. Available experimental transcriptomic and proteomic data, in combination with a set of predictions, gave coherent results validating this research. Thus, new manners Msr gene expression regulation, as well as new putative roles of Msrs, are proposed.
LIM proteins have been found to play important roles in many life activities, including the regulation of gene expression, construction of the cytoskeleton, signal transduction and metabolic regulation. Because of their important roles in many aspects of plant development, LIM genes have been studied in many plant species. However, the LIM gene family has not yet been characterized in foxtail millet. In this study, we analyzed the whole genome of foxtail millet and identified 10 LIM genes. All LIM gene promoters contain MYB and MYC cis-acting elements that are related to drought stress. Based on the presence of multiple abiotic stress-related cis-elements in the promoter of SiWLIM2b, we chose this gene for further study. We analyzed SiWLIM2b expression under abiotic stress and hormone treatments using qRT-PCR. We found that SiWLIM2b was induced by various abiotic stresses and hormones. Under drought conditions, transgenic rice of SiWLIM2b-overexpression had a higher survival rate, higher relative water content and less cell damage than wild type (WT) rice. These results indicate that overexpression of the foxtail millet SiWLIM2b gene enhances drought tolerance in transgenic rice, and the SiWLIM2b gene can potentially be used for molecular breeding of crops with increased resistance to abiotic stress.
Anthocyanin is part of secondary metabolites, which is induced by environmental stimuli and developmental signals, such as high light and sucrose. Anthocyanin accumulation is activated by the MYB-bHLH-WD40 (MBW) protein complex in plants. But the evidence of how plants maintain anthocyanin in response to signals is lacking. Here we perform molecular and genetic evidence to display that HAT1 plays a new breaker of anthocyanin accumulation via post-translational regulations of MBW protein complex. Loss of function of HAT1 in the Arabidopsis seedlings exhibits increased anthocyanin accumulation, whereas overexpression of HAT1 significantly repressed anthocyanin accumulation. We found that HAT1 interacted with MYB75 and thereby interfered with MBW protein complex. Overexpression of HAT1 suppresses abundant anthocyanin phenotype of pap1-D plant. HAT1 is characterized as a transcriptional repressor possessing an N-terminal EAR motif, which determines to interact with TOPLESS corepressor. Repression activity of HAT1 in regulation of gene expression and anthocyanin accumulation can be abolished by deletion or mutation of the EAR motif 1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that MYB75 formed a transcriptional repressor complex with HAT1-TPL by histone H3 deacetylation in target genes. We proposed that HAT1 restrained anthocyanin accumulation by inhibiting the activities of MBW protein complex through blocking the formation of MBW protein complex and recruiting the TPL corepressor to epigenetically modulate the anthocyanin late biosynthetic genes (LBGs).
To unravel the molecular mechanisms underpinning maize (Zea mays L.) drought stress tolerance, we conducted comprehensive comparative transcriptome and physiological analyses of drought-tolerant YE8112 and drought-sensitive MO17 inbred line seedlings that had been exposed to drought treatment for seven days. Resultantly, YE8112 seedlings maintained comparatively higher leaf relative water and proline contents, greatly increased peroxidase activity, but decreased malondialdehyde content, than MO17 seedlings. Using an RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)-based approach, we identified a total of 10,612 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). From these, we mined out four critical sets of drought responsive DEGs, including 80 specific to YE8112, 5140 shared between the two lines after drought treatment (SD_TD), five DEGs of YE8112 also regulated in SD_TD, and four overlapping DEGs between the two lines. Drought-stressed YE8112 DEGs were primarily associated with nitrogen metabolism and amino-acid biosynthesis pathways, whereas MO17 DEGs were enriched in the ribosome pathway. Additionally, our physiological analyses results were consistent with the predicted RNA-seq-based findings. Furthermore, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis and the RNA-seq results of twenty representative DEGs were highly correlated (R² = 98.86%). Crucially, tolerant line YE8112 drought-responsive genes were predominantly implicated in stress signal transduction; cellular redox homeostasis maintenance; MYB, NAC, WRKY, and PLATZ transcriptional factor modulated; carbohydrate synthesis and cell-wall remodeling; amino acid biosynthesis; and protein ubiquitination processes. Our findings offer insights into the molecular networks mediating maize drought stress tolerance.
The flower color of Paeonia 'Coral Sunset' and 'Pink Hawaiian Coral' changes from coral to pink to pale yellow during flowering, which confers high ornamental value to these two cultivars. However, the molecular mechanism underlying flower color change is still unclear. In this study, flavonoids in petals of Paeonia 'Coral Sunset' and 'Pink Hawaiian Coral' at seven flowering stages were analyzed to explore the effects of the flavonoid component on changes in flower color. In addition, four cDNA libraries of 'Coral Sunset' during the critical blooming stages were constructed and the transcriptome was sequenced to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying changes to flower color. Two anthocyanins (cyanidin-3,5-di-O-glucoside and peonidin-3,5-di-O-glucoside) were detected in both cultivars. Total anthocyanin content in both cultivars accumulated continuously from stages 1-3 and then decreased sharply. Correlation analysis showed that the change in flower color from coral to pink to pale yellow is due to a significant decrease in anthocyanin content. A total of 91,583 Unigenes were obtained in 'Coral Sunset', 33,962 (37.08%) of which were annotated to major databases. Based on the enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes, eight structural genes (CHS, F3H, F3'H, FLS, DRF, ANS, ANR and UFGT) and 13 transcription factors (five MYB, three bHLH, one WD40, one HY5, one PIF3, one COP1 and two PHY) related to flavonoid biosynthesis were screened. The qRT-PCR results were generally consistent with the high-throughput sequencing results. This research will provide a foundation to clarify the mechanisms underlying changes in flower color of herbaceous peony.
Melatonin (MT; N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a pleiotropic signaling molecule that has been demonstrated to play an important role in plant growth, development, and regulation of environmental stress responses. Studies have been conducted on the role of the exogenous application of MT in a few species, but the potential mechanisms of MT-mediated stress tolerance under salt stress are still largely unknown. In this study, naked oat seedlings under salt stress (150 mM NaCl) were pretreated with two different concentrations of MT (50 and 100 μM), and the effects of MT on the growth and antioxidant capacity of naked oat seedlings were analyzed to explore the regulatory effect of MT on salt tolerance. The results showed that pretreating with different concentrations of MT promoted the growth of seedlings in response to 150 mM NaCl. Different concentrations of MT reduced hydrogen peroxide, superoxide anion, and malondialdehyde contents. The exogenous application of MT also increased superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase, and ascorbate peroxide activities. Chlorophyll content, leaf area, leaf volume, and proline increased in the leaves of naked oat seedlings under 150 mM NaCl stress. MT upregulated the expression levels of the lipid peroxidase genes lipoxygenase and peroxygenase, a chlorophyll biosynthase gene (ChlG), the mitogen-activated protein kinase genes Asmap1 and Aspk11, and the transcription factor genes (except DREB2), NAC, WRKY1, WRKY3, and MYB in salt-exposed MT-pretreated seedlings when compared with seedlings exposed to salt stress alone. These results demonstrate an important role of MT in the relief of salt stress and, therefore, provide a reference for managing salinity in naked oat.
MYB proteins play important roles in the regulation of plant growth, development, and stress responses. Overexpression of BplMYB46 from Betula platyphylla improved plant salt and osmotic tolerances. In the present study, the interaction of eight avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog (MYB) transcription factors with BplMYB46 was investigated using the yeast two-hybrid system, which showed that BplMYB46 could form homodimers and heterodimers with BplMYB6, BplMYB8, BplMYB11, BplMYB12, and BplMYB13. Relative beta-glucuronidase activity and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that the interaction between BplMYB46 and the five MYBs increased the binding of BplMYB46 to the MYBCORE motif. A subcellular localization study showed that these MYBs were all located in the nucleus. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR results indicated that the expressions of BplMYB46 and the five MYB genes could be induced by salt and osmotic stress, and the BplMYB46 and BplMYB13 exhibited the most similar expression patterns. BplMYB46 and BplMYB13 co-overexpression in tobacco using transient transformation technology improved tobacco's tolerance to salt and osmotic stresses compared with overexpressing BplMYB13 or BplMYB46 alone. Taken together, these results demonstrated that BplMYB46 could interact with five other MYBs to form heterodimers that activate the transcription of target genes via an enhanced binding ability to the MYBCORE motif to mediate reactive oxygen species scavenging in response to salt and osmotic stresses.
Red coleoptiles can help crops to cope with adversity and the key genes that are responsible for this trait have previously been isolated from Triticum aestivum, Triticum urartu, and Aegilops tauschii. This report describes the use of transcriptome analysis to determine the candidate gene that controls the trait for white coleoptiles in T. monococcum by screening three cultivars with white coleoptiles and two with red coleoptiles. Fifteen structural genes and two transcription factors that are involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis were identified from the assembled UniGene database through BLAST analysis and their transcript levels were then compared in white and red coleoptiles. The majority of the structural genes reflected lower transcript levels in the white than in the red coleoptiles, which implied that transcription factors related to anthocyanin biosynthesis could be candidate genes. The transcript levels of MYC transcription factor TmMYC-A1 were not significantly different between the white and red coleoptiles and all of the TmMYC-A1s contained complete functional domains. The deduced amino acid sequence of the MYB transcription factor TmMYB-A1 in red coleoptiles was homologous to TuMYB-A1, TaMYB-A1, TaMYB-B1, and TaMYB-D1, which control coleoptile color in corresponding species and contained the complete R2R3 MYB domain and the transactivation domain. TmMYB-a1 lost its two functional domains in white coleoptiles due to a single nucleotide deletion that caused premature termination at 13 bp after the initiation codon. Therefore, TmMYB-A1 is likely to be the candidate gene for the control of the red coleoptile trait, and its loss-of-function mutation leads to the white phenotype in T. monococcum.
Maize (Zea mays L.) is an important model plant with an important role in agriculture and national economies all over the world. The optimum growth temperature of maize is between 25 and 28 °C. At temperatures below 12 °C, maize is vulnerable to damage by chilling stress. MYB transcription factors play important roles in plants' response to low temperature stress. Maize ZmMYB31 encodes a R2R3-MYB transcription factor, ZmMYB31, which localized in the nucleus. ZmMYB31 expression was induced by chilling stress and the highest expression level was detected with the 24 h chilling treatment. ZmMYB31 expression also increased in overexpressing Arabidopsis lines. The minimal fluorescence (Fo) with all photosystem II reaction centers open increased in wild type (WT) and transgenic plants under chilling stress, with the highest increase in WT. The maximal photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) decreased more in WT than in transgenic plants during chilling stress. Furthermore, the ZmMYB31-overexpressing lines showed higher superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase activity and lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) content than the WT. The expression of genes related to chilling stress was higher in transgenic plants than in WT. These results suggest that ZmMYB31 plays a positive regulatory role in chilling and peroxide stress by regulating the expression of chilling stress-related genes to reduce ion extravasation, ROS content, and low-temperature photoinhibition, thereby improving low temperature resistance.
To investigate the genetic and epigenetic differences between human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) and HPV-negative OPSCC.
Microarray data of HPV-positive and -negative OPSCC were retrieved from NCBI GEO datasets. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNAs) were identified by performing differential expression analysis. A functional enrichment analysis was performed to explore the biological processes and signaling pathways that DEGs and DE-miRNAs were involved in, respectively. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DEGs was constructed to identify hub genes. miRNA-target network and miRNA-miRNA functional synergistic network were each constructed in order to identify risk-marker miRNAs. An miRNA-target-pathway network was constructed in order to explore the function of identified risk-marker miRNAs.
Microarray data from 3 datasets (GSE39366, GSE40774, and GSE55550) was included and analyzed. The PPI network identified 3 hub genes (VCAM1, UBD, and RPA2). MiR-107 and miR-142-3p were found to play the most significant role in both the DE-miRNA-target network as well as in the miRNA-miRNA functional synergistic network. MiR-107 was involved in HPV-induced tumorigenesis by targeting many genes (CAV1, CDK6, MYB, and SERPINB5) and regulating the p53 signaling pathway, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and the autophagy pathway. In addition, miR-142-3p was implicated in HPV-induced tumorigenesis by targeting the PPFIA1 gene and regulating transcriptional dysregulation and other cancerous pathways.
Three genes (VCAM1, UBD, and RPA2), two miRNAs (miR-107 and miR-142-3p), and four pathways (p53, PI3K-Akt, autophagy, and transcription dysregulation in cancer) were identified to play critical roles in distinguishing HPV-positive OPSCC from HPV-negative OPSCC.
Lycium ruthenicum Murray is an important economic plant in China and contains higher levels of anthocyanins in its fruits than other Lyciums. However, the genetic mechanism of anthocyanin production in this plant is unknown.
Based on previous transcriptome analysis, LrAN2 and LbAN2, encoding MYB transcription factors, were isolated from L. ruthenicum and L. barbarum, respectively. Both genes contained two introns, encoded 257 amino acids with two-Aa difference, and carried the unabridged HTH-MYB, MYB-like DNA-binding, and SANT domains. In the phylogenetic trees, LrAN2 and LbAN2 were found to be closely related to NtAN2, which regulates anthocyanin biosynthesis in tobacco. Overexpression of LrAN2 and LbAN2 induced anthocyanin biosynthesis in all tissues of tobacco. The anthocyanin content in the leaves of transgenic lines with LbAN2 was lower than LrAN2. It indicated that the function of LbAN2 was weaker than LrAN2. The AN2 transcript could be detected only in the fruits of L. ruthenicum and increased during fruit development, accompanied by anthocyanin accumulation. In natural population, the alleles LrAN2 and LrAN2 were associated strictly with L. ruthenicum and L. barbarum, respectively. Moreover, an AN2 genetic diversity study suggested that Lyciums with yellow, white, purple, and jujube red fruits were derived from L. ruthenicum.
Two AN2 alleles, from L. ruthenicum and L. barbarum, were functional MYB transcriptor regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis. The functional diversity and high expression level of LrAN2 could be the reason for high anthocyanin content in the fruit of L. ruthenicum. Lyciums with yellow, white, purple, and jujube red fruits were derived from L. ruthenicum based on AN2 sequence diversity. The results may be advantageous in identifying new varieties and breeding new cultivars.
Transcription factor (TF) genes play essential roles in abiotic stress responses as master switches in complex regulatory networks. In the present study, the transcript abundance of 4287 TF genes in Populus simonii × P.nigra were profiled under NaCl, KCl, CdCl2 and PEG stresses, respectively. A total of 118 up-regulated and 226 down-regulated TFs were identified to be shared in the four stress conditions. Among the top seven TF families (ERF, NAC, WRKY, MYB, bHLH, C2H2, bZIP), there were 76 up-regulated TFs found common in the four stresses, and 67% of them were likely to be involved in stress responses. We identified three TFs, which can enhance stress tolerance of transgenic plants, were members of the most significantly up-regulated genes in the respective TF family. Among them, a highly salt-inducible ERF gene, ERF76, was proved to activate the expression of other TFs in the transgenic poplar lines overexpressing ERF76. Transcriptome analysis indicated there was a synergistic effect of TFs on improving salinity tolerance of the transgenic plants. Of significant interest in the study is the discovery of the role and interactions of various TF genes under multiple stress conditions.
Primary tracheobronchial adenoid cystic carcinoma is rare, accounting for less than 1% of all lung tumors. Many adenoid cystic carcinomas have been reported to have a specific chromosome translocation t(6;9)/MYB-NFIB. More recently, t(8;9)/MYBL1-NFIB gene fusion was reported in salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinomas which lacked a t(6;9)/MYB-NFIB. Two prior studies showed t(6;9)/MYB-NFIB in tracheobronchial adenoid cystic carcinoma; however, only rare cases of MYBL1 rearrangement have been reported in this carcinoma. In this study, we used targeted RNA sequencing to investigate fusion genes in tracheobronchial adenoid cystic carcinoma at our institution. Fusions of either MYB or MYBL1 genes were detected in 7 of 7 carcinomas. Three cases had MYB-NFIB, and 3 had MYBL1-NFIB. The remaining case showed a rare MYBL1-RAD51B fusion. These findings suggest that rearrangement involving MYB or MYBL1 is a hallmark of tracheobronchial adenoid cystic carcinoma.
The herb Sedum alfredii (S. alfredii) Hance is a hyperaccumulator of heavy metals (cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn) and lead (Pb)); therefore, it could be a candidate plant for efficient phytoremediation. The GDSL esterase/lipase protein (GELP) family plays important roles in plant defense and growth. Although the GELP family members in a variety of plants have been cloned and analyzed, there are limited studies on the family's responses to heavy metal-stress conditions.
Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses were performed according to the criteria described. A WGCNA was used to construct co-expression regulatory networks. The roots of S. alfredii seedlings were treated with 100 µM CdCl2 for qRT-PCR to analyze expression levels in different tissues. SaGLIP8 was transformed into the Cd sensitive mutant strain yeast Δycf1 to investigate its role in resistance and accumulation to Cd.
We analyzed GELP family members from genomic data of S. alfredii. A phylogenetic tree divided the 80 identified family members into three clades. The promoters of the 80 genes contained certain elements related to abiotic stress, such as TC-rich repeats (defense and stress responsiveness), heat shock elements (heat stress) and MYB-binding sites (drought-inducibility). In addition, 66 members had tissue-specific expression patterns and significant responses to Cd stress. In total, 13 hub genes were obtained, based on an existing S. alfredii transcriptome database, that control 459 edge genes, which were classified into five classes of functions in a co-expression subnetwork: cell wall and defense function, lipid and esterase, stress and tolerance, transport and transcription factor activity. Among the hub genes, Sa13F.102 (SaGLIP8), with a high expression level in all tissues, could increase Cd tolerance and accumulation in yeast when overexpressed.
Based on genomic data of S. alfredii, we conducted phylogenetic analyses, as well as conserved domain, motif and expression profiling of the GELP family under Cd-stress conditions. SaGLIP8 could increase Cd tolerance and accumulation in yeast. These results indicated the roles of GELPs in plant responses to heavy metal exposure and provides a theoretical basis for further studies of the SaGELP family's functions.
Plants require different inorganic minerals in an appropriate amount for growth; however, imbalance can limit growth and productivity. Heavy metal accumulation causes toxicity and generates signalling crosstalk with reactive oxygen species (ROS), phytohormones, genes and transcription factors (TFs). The MYB (myeloblastoma) TFs participate in plant processes such as metabolism, development, cell fate, hormone pathways and responses to stresses. This is the first report towards characterisation of R2R3-type MYB TF, SbMYB15, from succulent halophyte Salicornia brachiata Roxb. for heavy metal tolerance. The SbMYB15 showed &gt;5-fold increased transcript expression in the presence of CdCl2 and NiCl2•6H2O. The constitutive overexpression of SbMYB15 conferred cadmium and nickel tolerance in transgenic tobacco, with improved growth and chlorophyll content. Further, the transgenics showed reduced generation of reactive oxygen species (H2O2 and O2•-) as compared with the wild-type (WT) with both Cd2+ and Ni2+ stress. Transgenics also showed low uptake of heavy metal ions, increased scavenging activity of the antioxidative enzymes (CAT and SOD) and higher transcript expression of antioxidative genes (CAT1 and MnSOD). Thus, the present study signifies that SbMYB15 can be deployed for developing heavy metal tolerance in crop plants via genetic engineering.
The secondary cell wall is an important carbon sink in higher plants and its biosynthesis requires coordination of metabolic fluxes in the phenylpropanoid pathway. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), MYB75 and the KNOX transcription factor KNAT7 form functional complexes to regulate secondary cell wall formation in the inflorescence stem. However, the molecular mechanism by which these transcription factors control different branches of the phenylpropanoid pathway remains poorly understood in woody species. We isolated an R2R3-MYB transcription factor MYB6 from Populus tomentosa and determined that it was expressed predominately in young leaves. Overexpression of MYB6 in transgenic poplar up-regulated flavonoid biosynthetic gene expression, resulting in significantly increased accumulation of anthocyanin and proanthocyanidins. MYB6-overexpression plants showed reduced secondary cell wall deposition, accompanied by repressed expression of secondary cell wall biosynthetic genes. We further showed that MYB6 interacted physically with KNAT7 and formed functional complexes that acted to repress secondary cell wall development in poplar and Arabidopsis. The results provide insight into the transcriptional mechanisms involved in the regulation of the metabolic fluxes between the flavonoid and lignin biosynthetic pathways in poplar.

High temperatures are known to reduce anthocyanin accumulation in a number of diverse plant species. In potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), high temperature significantly reduces tuber anthocyanin pigment content. However, the mechanism of anthocyanin biosynthesis in potato tuber under heat stress remains unknown. Here we show that high temperature causes reduction of anthocyanin biosynthesis in both potato tuber skin and flesh, with white areas forming between the vasculature and periderm. Heat stress reduced the expression of the R2R3 MYB transcription factor (TF) StAN1 and StbHLH1, members of the transcriptional complex responsible for coordinative regulation of the skin and flesh pigmentation, as well as anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway genes in white regions. However, the core phenylpropanoid pathway genes, lignin and chlorogenic acid (CGA) pathway genes were up-regulated in white areas, suggesting that suppression of the anthocyanin branch may result in re-routing phenylpropanoid flux into the CGA or lignin biosynthesis branches. Two R2R3 MYB TFs, StMYB44-1 and StMYB44-2, were highly expressed in white regions under high temperature. In transient assays, StMYB44 represses anthocyanin accumulation in leaves of N. tabacum and N. benthamiana by directly suppressing the activity of the dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR) promoter. StMYB44-1 showed stronger repressive capacity than StMYB44-2 with both predicted proteins containing the repression-associated EAR motif with some variation. StMYB44-1 conferred repression without a requirement for a bHLH partner, suggesting a different repression mechanism from reported anthocyanin repressors. We propose that temperature-induced reduction of anthocyanin accumulation in potato flesh is caused by down-regulation of the activating anthocyanin regulatory complex, by enhancing the expression of flesh-specific StMYB44 and alteration of phenylpropanoid flux.
Despite the significant importance of soybean isoflavone, the regulatory mechanism of miRNAs during its biosynthesis is highly unexplored. In the present work, nine existing miRNAs along with their ten corresponding target genes were identified and validated in soybean for their possible role during isoflavonoid biosynthesis and accumulation. Temporal expression analysis at four key stages of seed development (35, 45, 55 and 65DAF) of all the miRNA-target pairs showed varying degree of differential accumulation in two soybean genotypes (NRC37: high isoflavone; and NRC7: low isoflavone). Differential expression of MYB65-Gma-miR159, MYB96-Gma-miRNA1534, MYB176-Gma-miRNA5030, SPL9-Gma-miRNA156, TCP3, TCP4-Gma-miRNA319, WD40-Gma-miRNA162, UDP-glucose: flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase-Gma-miRNA396, and CHI3-Gma-miRNA5434 showed an important relationship with their targets in both the soybean genotypes across all the stages. Therefore, the finding of the present work would certainly increase our understanding of molecular regulation of isoflavone biosynthetic pathway mediated by the miRNA which would guide molecular breeder to develop isoflavone rich soybean cultivars.
The plant metabolite montbretin A (MbA) and its simpler precursor mini-MbA are being developed as new drugs against Type-2 diabetes. The only known source for these complex acylated flavonol glycosides is the ornamental plant montbretia (Crocosmia x crocosmiiflora). MbA occurs in small amounts in below-ground storage organs, called corms. Our long-term goal is to metabolically engineer Nicotiana benthamiana as a heterologous production system for mini-MbA and MbA. Two montbretia UDP-dependent glycosyltransferases (UGTs), CcUGT1 and CcUGT2, catalyze the formation of myricetin 3-O-rhamnoside and myricetin 3-O-glucosyl rhamnoside, the first two pathway-specific intermediates in MbA biosynthesis. Expression of these UGTs in N. benthamiana resulted in small amounts of kaempferol glycosides, but not myricetin glycosides, suggesting myricetin is limiting. We investigated montbretia genes and enzymes of flavonol biosynthesis to enhance myricetin formation in N. benthamiana. We characterized two flavanone hydroxylases (F3H), a flavonol synthase (FLS), a flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase (F3'H) and a flavonoid 3'5'-hydroxylase (F3'5'H). Montbretia FLS converted dihydromyricetin into myricetin. Unexpectedly, montbretia F3'5'H shared higher sequence-relatedness to F3'Hs in the CYP75B subfamily of cytochromes P450 than those with known F3'5'H activity. Transient expression of combinations of montbretia flavonol biosynthesis genes and a montbretia MYB transcription factor in N. benthamiana resulted in availability of myricetin for MbA biosynthesis. Transient co-expression of montbretia flavonol biosynthesis genes combined with CcUGT1 and CcUGT2 in N. benthamiana resulted in 2 mg x g-1 fresh weight of the MbA pathway-specific compound myricetin 3-O-glucosyl rhamnoside. Additional expression of the montbretia acyltransferase CcAT1 led to detectable levels of mini-MbA in N. benthamiana.
Temperature is one of the most important environmental factors affecting flowering in plants. Adonis amurensis, a perennial herbaceous flower that blooms in early spring in northeast China where the temperature can drop to -15 °C, is an ideal model for studying the molecular mechanisms of flowering at extremely low temperatures. This study first investigated global gene expression profiles at different developmental stages of flowering in A. amurensis by RNA-seq transcriptome and iTRAQ proteomics. Finally, 123 transcription factors (TFs) were detected in both the transcriptome and the proteome. Of these, 66 TFs belonging to 14 families may play a key role in multiple signaling pathways of flowering in A. amurensis. The TFs FAR1, PHD, and B3 may be involved in responses to light and temperature, while SCL, SWI/SNF, ARF, and ERF may be involved in the regulation of hormone balance. SPL may regulate the age pathway. Some members of the TCP, ZFP, MYB, WRKY, and bHLH families may be involved in the transcriptional regulation of flowering genes. The MADS-box TFs are the key regulators of flowering in A. amurensis. Our results provide a direction for understanding the molecular mechanisms of flowering in A. amurensis at low temperatures.
The utilization of the nutrient potential of alfalfa ( Medicago sativa L.) cannot be maximized because of its rapidly degradable protein content in the rumen, leading to waste and various digestive disorders. This might be alleviated if protein-binding proanthocyanidins are present in aerial parts of alfalfa forage in adequate amounts. The Lc (bHLH) and C1 (MYB) genes of maize are transcription factors known to be collectively involved in the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthetic pathways. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of Lc and C1 gene transformations on the proanthocyanidin content, nutrient composition, and degradation characteristics of proteins and carbohydrates by comparing the transgenic alfalfa with its parental nontransgenic (NT) alfalfa and commercial AC-Grazeland cultivar. The DNA extracted from transgenic plants was tested for the presence of respective transgenes by amplification with specific primers of respective transgenes using PCR. Both Lc-single and LcC1-double transgenic alfalfa accumulated both monomeric and polymeric proanthocyanidins with total proanthocyanidins ranging from ca. 460 to 770 μg/g of DM. The C1-transgenic alfalfa did not accumulate proanthocyanidins similar to NT alfalfa. The C1 gene increased the NPN content significantly only in C1-single and Lc1C1-double transgenic alfalfa. The LcC1 combination seemed to have a synergic effect on reducing sugar in alfalfa. In contrast, the Lc gene appears to have a negative effect on starch content. The C1 gene tended to lower the PB3 content irrespective of the presence of the Lc gene. Although the cotransformation of Lc and C1 increased the total N/CHO ratio compared to Lc single gene transformation, the total N/CHO ratio of transgenic alfalfa was not significantly different from NT. In conclusion, Lc-bHLH single and LcC1 double gene transformation resulted in the accumulation of proanthocyanidins and affected the chemical profiles in alfalfa, which altered ruminal degradation patterns and impacted the nutrient availability of alfalfa in ruminant livestock systems.
MYB-CC transcription factors (TFs) genes have been demonstrated to be involved in the response to inorganic phosphate (Pi) starvation and regulate some Pi-starvation-inducible genes. However, their role in drought stress has not been investigated in bread wheat. In this study, the TaMYBsm3 genes, including TaMYBsm3-A, TaMYBsm3-B, and TaMYBsm3-D, encoding MYB-CC TF proteins in bread wheat, were isolated to investigate the possible molecular mechanisms related to drought-tolerance in plants.
TaMYBsm3-A, TaMYBsm3-B, and TaMYBsm3-D were mapped on chromosomes 6A, 6B, and 6D in wheat, respectively. TaMYBsm3 genes belonged to MYB-CC TFs, containing a conserved MYB DNA-binding domain and a conserved coiled-coil domain. TaMYBsm3-D was localized in the nucleus, and the N-terminal region was a transcriptional activation domain. TaMYBsm3 genes were ubiquitously expressed in different tissues of wheat, and especially highly expressed in the stamen and pistil. Under drought stress, transgenic plants exhibited milder wilting symptoms, higher germination rates, higher proline content, and lower MDA content comparing with the wild type plants. P5CS1, DREB2A, and RD29A had significantly higher expression in transgenic plants than in wild type plants.
TaMYBsm3-A, TaMYBsm3-B, and TaMYBsm3-D were associated with enhanced drought tolerance in bread wheat. Overexpression of TaMYBsm3-D increases the drought tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis through up-regulating P5CS1, DREB2A, and RD29A.
Anthocyanin accumulation is crucial for the development of quality for most fruit. The mechanism underlying the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis by transcription factors in litchi fruit remains largely unknown. In this study, we isolated one NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2 and CUC2) TF gene, LcNAC13. Expression of LcNAC13 was upregulated as ripening proceeded, followed by the accumulation of anthocyanins. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and transient expression assay showed that LcNAC13 could negatively regulate the expression of anthocyanin biosynthesis-related genes, including LcCHS1/2, LcCHI, LcF3H, LcF3'H, LcDFR, and LcMYB1. Furthermore, LcR1MYB1, as one R1-MYB type MYB, was identified to physically interact with LcNAC13 and reverse the effect of LcNAC13. Taken together, these results suggested that LcNAC13 and LcR1MYB1 may act together to antagonistically regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis during litchi fruit ripening, which helps to provide new insights into the regulatory networks of anthocyanin biosynthesis.
Autoimmune Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a chronic neuromuscular disease mainly due to antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) at the neuromuscular junction that induce invalidating muscle weaknesses. In early-onset MG, the thymus is the effector organ and is often characterized by B-cell infiltrations leading to ectopic germinal center (GC) development. The microRNA miR-150-5p has been previously characterized as a biomarker in MG due to its increase in the serum of patients and its decrease after thymectomy, correlated with an improvement of symptoms. Here, we investigated the causes and consequences of the miR-150 increase in the serum of early-onset MG patients. We observed that miR-150 expression was upregulated in MG thymuses in correlation with the presence of thymic B cells and showed by in situ hybridization experiments, that miR-150 was mainly expressed by cells of the mantle zone of GCs. However, we did not observe any correlation between the degree of thymic hyperplasia and the serum levels in MG patients. In parallel, we also investigated the expression of miR-150 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from MG patients. We observed that miR-150 was down-regulated, especially in CD4+ T cells compared to controls. These results suggest that the increased serum levels of miR-150 could result from a release from activated peripheral CD4+ T cells. Next, we demonstrated that the in vitro treatment of PBMCs with miR-150 or antimiR-150 oligonucleotides, respectively, decreased or increased the expression of one of its major target gene: the proto-oncogene MYB, a well-known actor of hematopoiesis. These results revealed that increased serum levels of miR-150 in MG patients could have a functional effect on PBMCs. We also showed that antimiR-150 caused increased cellular death of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, along with the overexpression of pro-apoptotic genes targeted by miR-150 suggesting that miR-150 controlled the survival of these cells. Altogether, these results showed that miR-150 could play a role in MG both at the thymic level and in periphery by modulating the expression of target genes and peripheral cell survival.
Soil salinity imposes a serious threat to the productivity of agricultural crops. Among several other transporters, high-affinity K+ transporter (HKT)'s play an important role in reducing the phytotoxicity of Na+. Expression of Eutrema salsugineum (a halophyte) HKT1;2 is induced upon salt exposure. To elucidate the role of its promoter, we compared the sequences of HKT1;2 promoters from E. salsugineum (1822 bp) and E. botschantzevii (1811 bp) with Arabidopsis thaliana HKT1;1 (846 bp) promoter. In silico analysis predicted several cis-acting regulatory elements (GT-1 elements, core motifs of DRE/CRT, MYC/MYB-recognition sites and ACGT elements). Activities of the three promoters were analyzed by measuring HKT1;1 and/or HKT1;2 transcript level in the Athkt1;1 mutant plants. NaCl tolerance of the transgenics was also assessed. Our results depicted that expressing either AtHKT1;1 or EsHKT1;2 coding regions under the control of AtHKT1;1 promoter, almost reversed the hypersensitivity of the mutant for salt, on contrarily, when AtHKT1;1 coding sequence expressed under either Es or EbHKT1;2 promoters did not. Changes in shoot Na+/K+ concentrations under salt exposure is significantly consistent with the complementation ability of the mutant. The transcript concentration for genes under the control of either of Eutrema promoters, at control level was very less. This may suggest that either an important upstream response motif is missed or that A. thaliana misses a transcriptional regulator that is essential for salt-inducible HKT1 expression in Eutrema.
The phosphate starvation response 1 (PHR1) protein has a central role in mediating the response to phosphate starvation in plants. PHR1 is composed of a number of domains including a MYB domain involved with DNA binding and a coiled-coil domain proposed to be involved with dimer formation. PHR1 binds to the promoter of phosphate starvation-induced genes to control the levels of phosphate required for nutrition. Previous studies have shown that both the MYB domain and the coiled-coil domain of PHR1 are required for binding the target DNA. Here, we describe the crystal structure of the PHR1 MYB domain and two structures of its complex with the PHR1-binding DNA sequence (P1BS). Structural and isothermal titration calorimetry has been carried out showing that the MYB domain of PHR1 alone is sufficient for target DNA recognition and binding. Two copies of the PHR1 MYB domain bind to the same major groove of the P1BS DNA with few direct interactions between the individual MYB domains. In addition, the PHR1 MYB-P1BS DNA complex structures reveal amino acid residues involved in DNA recognition and binding. Mutagenesis of these residues results in lost or impaired ability of PHR1 MYB to bind to its target DNA. The results presented reveal the structural basis for DNA recognition by the PHR1 MYB domain and demonstrate that two PHR1 MYB domains attach to their P1BS DNA targeting sequence. DATABASE: Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession codes 6J4K (PHR1 MYB), 6J4R (PHR1 MYB-R-P1BS), 6J5B (MYB-CC-R2-P1BS).
Over 70% of human breast cancers are estrogen receptor-positive (ER+), most of which express MYB. In these and other cell types, the MYB transcription factor regulates the expression of many genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, tumorigenesis, and apoptosis. So far, no clear link has been established between MYB and the DNA damage response in breast cancer. Here, we found that silencing MYB in the ER+ breast cancer cell line MCF-7 led to increased DNA damage accumulation, as marked by increased γ-H2AX foci following induction of double-stranded breaks. We further found that this was likely mediated by decreased homologous recombination-mediated repair (HRR), since silencing MYB impaired the formation of RAD51 foci in response to DNA damage. Moreover, cells depleted for MYB exhibited reduced expression of several key genes involved in HRR including BRCA1, PALB2, and TOPBP1. Taken together, these data imply that MYB and its targets play an important role in the response of ER+ breast cancer cells to DNA damage, and suggest that induction of DNA damage along with inhibition of MYB activity could offer therapeutic benefits for ER+ breast cancer and possibly other cancer types.
Apigenin has been proven to possess many pharmacological properties, but the mechanism of regulation of apigenin biosynthesis in plants remains unclear. Apigenin is the main flavonoid in celery and is mainly accumulated in the middle stage of leaf blade development. In this study, comparative transcriptomic analysis revealed a large number of structural genes and transcription factor genes that may be involved in the apigenin metabolic pathway. On the basis of the apigenin content in different celery accessions, an R2R3-MYB transcription factor gene, named AgMYB1, was isolated from the high apigenin celery accession C014. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that AgMYB1 may be involved in flavonoid metabolism. AgMYB1 expression showed a positive relation with the expression of the apigenin accumulation marker gene FNSI and with the apigenin content in different celery tissues. Moreover, overexpression and antisense expression of AgMYB1 in transgenic celery plants significantly increased and reduced the expression of apigenin biosynthetic genes and the apigenin content, respectively. These findings suggest that AgMYB1 is involved in positive regulation of apigenin metabolism in celery.
Secondary cell wall biosynthesis during wood formation in trees is controlled by a multilevel regulatory network that coordinates the expression of substantial genes. However, few transcription factors involved in the negative regulation of secondary wall biosynthesis have been characterized in tree species. In this study, we isolated an R2R3 MYB transcription factor MYB189 from Populus trichocarpa, which is expressed predominantly in secondary vascular tissues, especially in the xylem. A novel repression motif was identified in the C-terminal region of MYB189, which indicates this factor was a transcriptional repressor. Overexpression of MYB189 in Arabidopsis and poplar resulted in a significant reduction in the contents of lignin, cellulose and hemicelluloses. Vascular development in stems of MYB189 overexpression lines was markedly inhibited, leading to a dramatic decrease in secondary cell wall thickness of xylem fibres. Gene expression analyses showed that most of the structural genes involved in the biosynthesis of lignin, cellulose and xylans were significantly down-regulated in MYB189-overexpressing poplars compared with the wild-type control. ChIP-qPCR and transient expression assays revealed that MYB189 could directly bind to the promoters of secondary wall biosynthetic genes to repress their expression. Together, these data suggest that MYB189 acts as a repressor to regulate secondary cell wall biosynthesis in poplar.
In plants, male sterility is an important agronomic trait, especially in hybrid crop production. Many factors are known to affect crop male sterility, but it remains unclear whether sucrose transporters (SUTs) participate directly in this process. Here, we identified and functionally characterized the cucumber (Cucumis sativus) CsSUT1, a typical plasma membrane-localized energy-dependent high-affinity sucrose-H+ symporter. CsSUT1 is expressed in male flowers and encodes a protein that is localized primarily in the tapetum, pollen and companion cells (CCs) of the phloem of sepals, petals, filaments and pedicel. The male flowers of CsSUT1-RNAi lines exhibited a decrease in sucrose, hexose and starch content, relative to those of the wild type (WT), during the later stages of male flower development, a finding that was highly associated correlated with male sterility. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that numerous genes associated with sugar metabolism, transport and signaling, as well as with auxin signaling, were down-regulated, whereas most MYB transcription factor genes were up-regulated in these CsSUT1-RNAi lines relative to WT. Our findings demonstrate that male sterility can be induced by RNAi-mediated down-regulation of CsSUT1 expression, through the resultant perturbation in carbohydrate delivery and subsequent alteration in sugar and hormone signaling and up-regulation of specific MYB transcription factors. This knowledge provides a novel approach for bioengineering male sterility in crop plants.
Loquat (Eriobotrya japonica) fruit accumulates lignin during postharvest storage under chilling conditions (0 °C), while low-temperature conditioning (LTC; 5 °C for 6 days followed by transfer to 0 °C) or heat treatment (HT; 40 °C for 4 h followed by transfer to 0 °C) can alleviate lignification. Here we compared transcriptome profiles of loquat fruit samples under LTC or HT to those stored at 0 °C at five time points from day 1 to day 8 after treatment. High-throughput transcriptome sequences were de novo assembled into 53,319 unique transcripts with an N50 length of 1306 bp. A total of 2235 differentially expressed genes were identified in LTC, and 1020 were identified in HT compared to 0 °C. Key genes in the lignin biosynthetic pathway, including EjPAL2, EjCAD1, EjCAD3, 4CL, COMT, and HCT, were responsive to LTC or HT treatment, but they showed different expression patterns during the treatments, indicating that different structural genes could regulate lignification at different treatment stages. Coexpression network analysis showed that these candidate biosynthetic genes were associated with a number of transcription factors, including those belonging to the AP2, MYB, and NAC families. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes indicated that biological processes such as stress responses, cell wall and lignin metabolism, hormone metabolism, and metal ion transport were significantly affected under LTC or HT treatment when compared to 0 °C. Our analyses provide insights into transcriptome responses to postharvest treatments in loquat fruit.
Flavonoids play critical roles in plant responses to various stresses. Few studies have been reported on what the mechanism of activating flavonoid biosynthesis in plant responses to wounding and oxidation is. In this study, flavonoid metabolites and many MYB transcript factors from Rosa rugosa were verified to be induced by wounding and oxidation. RrMYB5 and RrMYB10, which belong to PA1- and TT2-type MYB TFs, respectively, showed extremely high induction. Overexpression of RrMYB5 and RrMYB10 resulted in an increased accumulation of proanthocyanidins in R. rugosa and tobacco by promoting the expression of flavonoid structural genes. Transcriptomic analysis of the transgenic plants showed that most genes, involved in wounding and oxidation response and ABA signalling modulation, were up-regulated by the overexpression of RrMYB10, which was very much similar to that observed in RrANR and RrDFR overexpression transgenics. RrMYB5 and RrMYB10 physically interacted and mutually activated each other's expressions. They solely or synergistically activated the different sets of flavonoid pathway genes in a bHLH TF EGL3-independent manner. Eventually, the accumulation of proanthocyanidins enhanced plant tolerance to wounding and oxidative stresses. Therefore, RrMYB5 and RrMYB10 regulated flavonoid synthesis in feedback loop responding to wounding and oxidation in R. rugosa. Our study provides new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of flavonoid biosynthesis by MYB TFs and their essential physiological functions in plant responses to wounding and oxidative stresses.
Transcription factors (TFs) regulate plant gene expression in different tissues. To investigate TF genes in rice ( L.), a genome-wide TF identification was conducted with the japonica rice genome. This study identified 3078 putative TFs in 59 families. The TF number of the top 10 TF families accounted for 58% of the 3078 rice TFs. The three largest TF families were the myeloblastosis (MYB) superfamily, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH), and far-red-impaired response (FAR1), which contained 413, 228, and 210 TF members, respectively. The expression profiles of the 3078 TF genes were surveyed with the RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data of 13 rice tissue types. Based on these expression profiles, we validated 1087 TFs expressed in 13 rice tissue types, which accounted for 35.32% of the 3078 putative TFs. We further analyzed the tissue-specific TFs in rice. In total, 28, 14, 14, 10, 9, 5, 5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 11, and 1 tissue-specific TF sequences were identified in the dry seed, pistil, spikelet, aleurone, anther, ovules, embryo 25 d after pollination (DAP), seed 5 DAP, root, leaf, seed 10 DAP, shoot, and endosperm 25 DAP, respectively. Moreover, we constructed RicetissueTFDB (), a comprehensive and public rice TF database that integrates tissue expression characters, genomic location, and Gene Ontology (GO) terms for each TF. The RicetissueTFDB database will facilitate the identification of target TFs and the functional studies about rice TFs.
Claudins are major tight-junction proteins that mediate cellular polarity and differentiation. The present study investigated whether the 4D3 antibody to the human CLDN4 extracellular domain (that we previously established) is capable of modulating chemotherapeutic sensitivity in gastric cancer (GC). The results of the present study showed that CLDN4 was overexpressed in 137 of the 192 analyzed GC cases, and that CLDN4 expression was retained in tumors of a lower histological grade (more differentiated), and/or those that were caudal-type homeobox protein 2 (CDX2)-positive, but was reduced in more highly undifferentiated, and CDX2-negative GC cases. The study also compared the synergic effects of combining 4D3 with CDDP treatment and knocking down CLDN4 expression in MKN74 and TMK-1 human GC cells. Co-treatment with 4D3 increased anti-tumor effects of CDDP, whereas CLDN4 knockdown did not. In the TMK-1 cells, non-tight junction CLDN4 associated with integrin β1, increasing stem cell-associated proteins via FAK-c-SRC signals. The anti-tumoral effect of CDDP and 4D3 was examined in a nude mouse subcutaneous tumor model. In the two GC cell lines, concurrent treatment with 4D3 and CDDP synergistically inhibited cell proliferation and increased tumor necrosis and apoptosis to a greater degree than CDDP treatment alone. These findings suggest that 4D3 might increase chemotherapeutic sensitivity by evoking structural disintegration of tight-junction CLDN4 expressed in gastric cancer.
Humans express two ACAT (acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase) genes, ACAT1 and ACAT2. ACAT1 is ubiquitously expressed, whereas ACAT2 is primarily expressed in intestinal mucosa and plays an important role in intestinal cholesterol absorption. To investigate the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for the tissue-specific expression of ACAT2, we identified five cis-elements within the human ACAT2 promoter, four for the intestinal-specific transcription factor CDX2 (caudal type homeobox transcription factor 2), and one for the transcription factor HNF1alpha (hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha). Results of luciferase reporter and electrophoretic mobility shift assays show that CDX2 and HNF1alpha exert a synergistic effect, enhancing the ACAT2 promoter activity through binding to these cis-elements. In undifferentiated Caco-2 cells, the ACAT2 expression is increased when exogenous CDX2 and/or HNF1alpha are expressed by co-transfection. In differentiated Caco-2 cells, the ACAT2 expression significantly decreases when the endogenous CDX2 or HNF1alpha expression is suppressed by using RNAi (RNA interference) technology. The expression levels of CDX2, HNF1alpha, and ACAT2 are all greatly increased when the Caco-2 cells differentiate to become intestinal-like cells. These results provide a molecular mechanism for the tissue-specific expression of ACAT2 in intestine. In normal adult human liver, CDX2 expression is not detectable and the ACAT2 expression is very low. In the hepatoma cell line HepG2 the CDX2 expression is elevated, accounting for its elevated ACAT2 expression. A high percentage (seven of fourteen) of liver samples from patients affected with hepatocellular carcinoma exhibited elevated ACAT2 expression. Thus, the elevated ACAT2 expression may serve as a new biomarker for certain form(s) of hepatocellular carcinoma.
In this study we examined the role of sorghum flavonoids in providing resistance against corn leaf aphid (CLA) Rhopalosiphum maidis. In sorghum, accumulation of these flavonoids is regulated by a MYB transcription factor, yellow seed1 (y1). Functional y1 alleles accumulate 3-deoxyflavonoids (3-DFs) and 3-deoxyanthocyanidins (3-DAs) whereas null y1 alleles fail to accumulate these compounds. We found that significantly higher numbers of alate CLA adults colonized null y1 plants as compared to functional y1 plants. Controlled cage experiments and pairwise choice assays demonstrated that apterous aphids preferred to feed and reproduce on null y1 plants. These near-isogenic sorghum lines do not differ in their epicuticular wax content and were also devoid of any leaf trichomes. Significantly higher mortality of CLA was observed on artificial aphid diet supplemented with flavonoids obtained from functional y1 plants as compared to null y1 plants or the relevant controls. Our results demonstrate that the proximate mechanism underlying the deleterious effects on aphids is y1-regulated flavonoids which are important defense compounds against CLA.
The complex quantitative nature of drought-related traits is a major constraint to breed tolerant wheat varieties. Pairs of near-isogenic lines (NILs) with a common genetic background but differing in a particular locus could turn quantitative traits into a Mendelian factor facilitating our understanding of genotype and phenotype interactions. In this study, we report our fast track development and evaluation of NILs from C306 × Dharwar Dry targeting a wheat 4BS QTL hotspot in C306, which confers drought tolerance following the heterogeneous inbreed family (HIF) analysis coupled with immature embryo culture-based fast generation technique. Molecular marker screening and phenotyping for grain yield and related traits under post-anthesis water stress (WS) confirmed four isoline pairs, viz., qDSI.4B.1-2, qDSI.4B.1-3, qDSI.4B.1-6, and qDSI.4B.1-8. There were significant contrasts of responses between the NILs with C306 QTL (+NILs) and the NILs without C306 QTL (-NILs). Among the four confirmed NIL pairs, mean grain yield per plant of the +NILs and -NILs showed significant differences ranging from 9.61 to 10.81 and 6.30 to 7.56 g, respectively, under WS condition, whereas a similar grain yield was recorded between the +NILs and -NILs under well-watered condition. Isolines of +NIL and -NIL pairs showed similar chlorophyll content (SPAD), assimilation rate (A), and transpiration rate (Tr) at the beginning of the stress. However, the +NILs showed significantly higher SPAD (12%), A (66%), stomatal conductance (75%), and Tr (97%) than the -NILs at the seventh day of stress. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis targeting the MYB transcription factor gene Triticum aestivum MYB 82 (TaMYB82), within this genomic region which was retrieved from the wheat reference genome TGACv1, also revealed differential expression in +NILs and -NILs under stress. These results confirmed that the NILs can be invaluable resources for fine mapping of this QTL, and also for cloning and functional characterization of the gene(s) responsible for drought tolerance in wheat.
The MYB transcription factors are important for many aspects of plant stress responses. In this study, we isolated and identified an apple MYB gene, MdMYB108L, whose expression is induced by light and cold stresses. An analysis of MdMYB108L-overexpressing transgenic apple calli revealed that MdMYB108L enhances cold tolerance in apple by upregulating MdCBF3 expression. Interestingly, the expression of MdHY5, which encodes an integrator of light and cold signals, was significantly downregulated in transgenic calli. Yeast one-hybrid and electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that MdMYB108L positively regulates cold tolerance by binding to the MdCBF3 promoter. Additionally, MdHY5 functions upstream of MdMYB108L, and the resulting increase in MdMYB108L abundance downregulates MdHY5 transcription. The results of this study elucidate a new pathway for the regulation of apple cold tolerance via a feedback mechanism involving MdMYB108L and MdHY5.
Boron (B) toxicity in Citrus is a common physiological disorder leading to reductions in both productivity and quality. Studies on how Citrus roots evade B toxicity may provide new insight into plant tolerance to B toxicity. Here, using Illumina sequencing, differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) were identified in B toxicity-treated Citrus sinensis (tolerant) and C. grandis (intolerant) roots. The results showed that 37 miRNAs in C. grandis and 11 miRNAs in C. sinensis were differentially expressed when exposed to B toxicity. Among them, miR319, miR171, and miR396g-5p were confirmed via 5'-RACE and qRT-PCR to target a myeloblastosis (MYB) transcription factor gene, a SCARECROW-like protein gene, and a cation transporting ATPase gene, respectively. Maintenance of SCARECROW expression in B treated Citrus roots might fulfill stem cell maintenance, quiescent center, and endodermis specification, thus allowing regular root elongation under B-toxic stress. Down-regulation of MYB due to up-regulation of miR319 in B toxicity-treated C. grandis roots might decrease the number of root tips, thereby dramatically changing root system architecture. Our findings suggested that miR319 and miR171 play a pivotal role in Citrus adaptation to long-term B toxicity by targeting MYB and SCARECROW, respectively, both of which are responsible for root growth and development.
Benzene exposure is associated with various hematological disorders, in particular leukemia. The reactive metabolite of benzene, 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ), generated in bone marrow, is suggested to be a key molecule in mediating benzene-induced hematotoxicity and carcinogenicity. However, its pathogenic role remains largely unknown due to a lack of suitable vertebrate whole-organism models. Here, we present an in vivo study to reveal the effect of BQ exposure on hematotoxicity in zebrafish. From embryonic stages to adulthood, BQ exposure suppressed erythroid and lymphoid hematopoiesis but led to abnormal accumulation of myeloid cells and precursors, which resembles benzene-induced cytopenia and myeloid dysplasia in humans. This myeloid expansion is caused by granulocyte, but not macrophage, lineage, emphasizing the significant role of lineage specificity in BQ-mediated hematopoietic toxicity. Analysis of the c-myb (also known as myb)-deficient mutant cmybhkz3 revealed that BQ induced neutrophilia in a c-myb-dependent manner, demonstrating that c-myb is a key intrinsic mediator of BQ hematotoxicity. Our study reveals that BQ causes lineage-specific hematotoxicity in zebrafish from embryonic stages to adulthood. Since c-myb is indispensable for BQ to induce neutrophilia, c-myb could serve as a potential drug target for reversing BQ hematotoxicity.
The incidence of recurrent t(6;9) translocation of the MYB proto‑oncogene to NFIB (the gene that encodes nuclear factor 1 B‑type) in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) tumour tissues is high. However, MYB [the gene that encodes transcriptional activator Myb (MYB)] overexpression is more common, indicating that MYB serves a key role in ACC. The current study aimed to investigate the role of MYB in salivary (S)ACC growth and metastasis. A total of 50 fresh‑frozen SACC tissues and 41 fresh‑frozen normal submandibular gland (SMG) tissues were collected to measure MYB mRNA expression, and to analyse the associations between MYB and epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. Compared with normal SMG tissue, SACC tissues demonstrated significantly increased MYB expression, with a high expression rate of 90%. Interestingly, MYB tended to be negatively correlated with CDH1 [the gene that encodes cadherin‑1 (E‑cadherin)] and positively correlated with VIM (the gene that encodes vimentin), suggesting that MYB is associated with SACC metastasis. To explore the role of MYB in SACC, the authors stably overexpressed and knocked down MYB in SACC cells. The authors of the current study demonstrated that MYB overexpression promoted SACC cell proliferation, migration and invasion, whereas its knockdown inhibited these activities. Additionally, when MYB was overexpressed, CDH1 expression was downregulated, and CDH2 (the gene that encodes cadherin‑2), VIM and ACTA2 (the gene that encodes actin, aortic smooth muscle) expression was upregulated. Then, the effect of MYB on lung tumour metastasis was investigated in vivo in non‑obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice. MYB overexpressing and control cells were injected into the mice through the tail vein. The results revealed that MYB promoted SACC lung metastasis. Collectively, these results demonstrated that MYB is aberrantly overexpressed in SACC tissues, and promotes SACC cell proliferation and metastasis, indicating that MYB may be a novel therapeutic target for SACC.
Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects over 2 million people worldwide with high morbidity and mortality in underdeveloped countries. Therapeutic interventions aimed at reactivating fetal haemoglobin (HbF) is an effective approach for improving survival and ameliorating the clinical severity of SCD. A class of agents that inhibit DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) activity show promise as HbF inducers because off-target effects are not observed at low concentrations. However, these compounds are rapidly degraded by cytidine deaminase when taken by oral administration, creating a critical barrier to clinical development for SCD. We previously demonstrated that microRNA29B (MIR29B) inhibits de novo DNMT synthesis, therefore, the goal of our study was to determine if MIR29 mediates HbF induction. Overexpression of MIR29B in human KU812 cells and primary erythroid progenitors significantly increased the percentage of HbF positive cells, while decreasing the expression of DNMT3A and the HBG repressor MYB. Furthermore, HBG promoter methylation levels decreased significantly following MIR29B overexpression in human erythroid progenitors. We subsequently, observed higher MIR29B expression in SCD patients with higher HbF levels compared to those with low HbF. Our findings provide evidence for the ability of MIR29B to induce HbF and supports further investigation to expand treatment options for SCD.
In this paper, a simple and easy high-precision calibration method is proposed for the LRF-camera combined measurement system which is widely used at present. This method can be applied not only to mainstream 2D and 3D LRF-cameras, but also to calibrate newly developed 1D LRF-camera combined systems. It only needs a calibration board to record at least three sets of data. First, the camera parameters and distortion coefficients are decoupled by the distortion center. Then, the spatial coordinates of laser spots are solved using line and plane constraints, and the estimation of LRF-camera extrinsic parameters is realized. In addition, we establish a cost function for optimizing the system. Finally, the calibration accuracy and characteristics of the method are analyzed through simulation experiments, and the validity of the method is verified through the calibration of a real system.
The MYBL2 gene, a highly conserved member of the Myb transcription-factor family, has been implicated in the genesis and progression of many types of tumors.
We analyzed the expression of MYBL2 and Ki67 in tissue samples of esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients by immunohistochemistry. We further analyzed the effect of MYBL2 on cell proliferation and DNA replication using a CCK8 assay, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine-retention assay, flow-cytometry analysis, real-time quantitative PCR, Western blot, and a xenograft model of ESCC cells in nude mice.
MYBL2 expression was significantly higher in ESCC tissue when compared to the adjacent normal tissue (P=0.007). MYBL2 was found to be positively correlated with Ki67 (γ=0.286, P=0.003). Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier curves indicated that MYBL2 expression in ESCC tissue was associated with poor patient outcome (P&lt;0.001), with MYBL2-positive patients who exhibited high Ki67 expression in ESCC tissue showing the worst prognosis for overall survival (P=0.003). Our in vitro results showed that downregulation of MYBL2 in ESCC cell lines inhibited cell proliferation and DNA replication (P&lt;0.05 for both). We also found that loss of MYBL2 caused a reduction in levels of cell cycle-related G2/M proteins CDK1 and cyclin B1 in ESCC cells. In contrast, overexpression of MYBL2 caused an increase in these proteins. In vivo, we found that in nude mice that received cells knocked down for MYBL2, tumor growth was inhibited in comparison to the group that received control cells (P&lt;0.05).
MYBL2 overexpression induces tumor proliferation in ESCC cells by regulating cell-cycle at the S and G2/M phase. Therefore, MYBL2 may serve as a novel prognostic biomarker in ESCC patients.
Varieties of Citrus are commercially important fruits that are cultivated worldwide and are valued for being highly nutritious and having an appealing flavor. Lignification of citrus fruit juice sacs is a serious physiological disorder that occurs during postharvest storage, for which the underlying transcriptional regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we identified and isolated a candidate MYB transcription factor, CsMYB85, that is involved in the regulation of lignin biosynthesis in Citrus sinensis, which has homologs in Arabidopsis and other plants. We found that during juice sac lignification, CsMYB85 expression levels increase significantly, and therefore, suspected that this gene may control lignin biosynthesis during the lignification process. Our results indicated that CsMYB85 binds the CsMYB330 promoter, regulates its expression, and interacts with CsMYB308 in transgenic yeast and tobacco. A transient expression assay indicated that Cs4CL1 expression levels and lignin content significantly increased in fruit juice sacs overexpressing CsMYB85. At4CL1 expression levels and lignin content were also significantly increased in Arabidopsis overexpressing CsMYB85. We accordingly present convincing evidence for the participation of the CsMYB85 transcription factor in fruit juice sac lignification, and thereby provide new insights into the transcriptional regulation of this process in citrus fruits.
Regulation of lignin biosynthesis is known to occur at the level of transcription factors (TFs), of which R2R3-MYB family members have been proposed to play a central role via the AC cis-elements. Despite the important roles of TFs in lignin biosynthesis, the post-translational regulation of these TFs, particularly their ubiquitination regulation, has not been thoroughly explored.
We describe the discovery of a Populus tomentosa E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 34 (PtoUBC34), which is involved in the post-translational regulation of transactivation activity of lignin-associated transcriptional repressors PtoMYB221 and PtoMYB156. PtoUBC34 is localized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane where it interacts with transcriptional repressors PtoMYB221 and PtoMYB156. This specific interaction allows for the translocation of TFs PtoMYB221 and PtoMYB156 to the ER and reduces their repression activity in a PtoUBC34 abundance-dependent manner. By taking a molecular biology approach with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis, we found that PtoUBC34 is expressed in all aboveground tissues of trees in P. tomentosa, and in particular, it is ubiquitous in all distinct differentiation stages across wood formation, including phloem differentiation, cambium maintaining, early and developing xylem differentiation, secondary cell wall thickening, and programmed cell death. Additionally, we discovered that PtoUBC34 is induced by treatment with sodium chloride and heat shock.
Our data suggest a possible mechanism by which lignin biosynthesis is regulated by ER-localized PtoUBC34 in poplar, probably through the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of lignin-associated repressors PtoMYB221 and PtoMYB156.
High levels of salinity induce serious oxidative damage in plants. Flavonoids, as antioxidants, have important roles in reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging. In the present study, the tobacco R2R3 MYB type repressor, NtMYB4, was isolated and characterized. The expression of NtMYB4 was suppressed by salinity. Overexpression of NtMYB4 reduced the salt tolerance in transgenic tobacco plants. NtMYB4 repressed the promoter activity of NtCHS1 and negatively regulated its expression. Rutin accumulation was significantly decreased in NtMYB4 overexpressing transgenic plants and NtCHS1 RNAi silenced transgenic plants. Moreover, high H2O2 and O2- contents were detected in both types of rutin-reduced transgenic plants under high salt stress. In addition, exogenous rutin supplementation effectively scavenged ROS (H2O2 and O2- ) and improved the salt tolerance of the rutin-reduced transgenic plants. In contrast, NtCHS1 overexpressing plants had increased rutin accumulation, lower H2O2 and O2- contents, and higher tolerance to salinity. These results suggested that tobacco NtMYB4 acts as a salinity response repressor and negatively regulates NtCHS1 expression, which results in the reduced flavonoid accumulation and weakened ROS-scavenging ability under salt stress.
Heteroblasty refers to a phenomenon that a plant produces morphologically or functionally different lateral organs in an age-dependent manner. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the production of trichomes (epidermal leaf hairs) on the abaxial (lower) side of leaves is a heteroblastic mark for the juvenile-to-adult transition. Here, we show that the heteroblastic development of abaxial trichomes is regulated by a spatiotemporally regulated complex comprising the leaf abaxial fate determinant (KAN1) and the developmental timer (miR172-targeted AP2-like proteins). We provide evidence that a short-distance chromatin loop brings the downstream enhancer element into close association with the promoter elements of GL1, which encodes a MYB transcription factor essential for trichome initiation. During juvenile phase, the KAN1-AP2 repressive complex binds to the downstream sequence of GL1 and represses its expression through chromatin looping. As plants age, the gradual reduction in AP2-like protein levels leads to decreased amount of the KAN1-AP2 complex, thereby licensing GL1 expression and the abaxial trichome initiation. Our results thus reveal a novel molecular mechanism by which a heteroblastic trait is governed by integrating age and leaf polarity cue in plants.
Angiosperms integrate a multitude of endogenous and environmental signals to control floral development, thereby ensuring reproductive success. Here, we report the identification of AGAMOUS AND TERMINAL FLOWER (AGTFL), a novel regulator of floral development in Medicago truncatula. Mutation of AGTFL led to the transformation of carpels and stamens into numerous sepals and petals and altered primary inflorescence identity. AGTFL encodes a nucleus-localized protein containing a putative Myb/SANT-like DNA-binding domain and a PKc kinase domain. Molecular and genetic analyses revealed that AGTFL regulates the transcription of MtAGs and MtTFL1 to control floral organ identity and inflorescence development.
The HER2 oncogene and its truncated form p95HER2 play central roles in breast cancer. Here, we show that although HER2 and p95HER2 generally elicit qualitatively similar changes in miRNA profile in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, a subset of changes are distinct and p95HER2 shifts the miRNA profile towards the basal breast cancer subtype. High-throughput miRNA profiling was carried out 15, 36 and 60 h after HER2 or p95HER2 expression and central hits validated by RT-qPCR. miRNAs strongly regulated by p95HER2 yet not by HER2, included miR-221, miR-222, miR-503, miR-29a, miR-149, miR-196 and miR-361. Estrogen receptor-α (ESR1) expression was essentially ablated by p95HER2 expression, in a manner recapitulated by miR-221/-222 mimics. c-Myb family transcription factors MYB and MYBL1, but not MYBL2, were downregulated by p95HER2 and by miR-503 or miR-221/-222 mimics. MYBL1 3'UTR inhibition by miR-221/222 was lost by deletion of a single putative miR-221/222 binding sites. p95HER2 expression, or knockdown of either MYB protein, elicited upregulation of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloprotease-2 (TIMP2). miR-221/222 and -503 mimics increased, and TIMP2 knockdown decreased, cell migration and invasion. A similar pathway was operational in T47D- and SKBr-3 cells. This work reveals important differences between HER2- and p95HER2- mediated miRNA changes in breast cancer cells, provides novel mechanistic insight into regulation of MYB family transcription factors by p95HER2, and points to a role for a miR-221/222- MYB family-TIMP2 axis in regulation of motility in breast cancer cells.
Aquaporins (AQPs) are water channel proteins that play a significant role in drought stress. Although the AQPs identified in multiple plant species, there is no detailed evolutionary and comparative study of AQPs regarding chickpea plant. The current study involved evolutionary analyses coupled with promoter and expression analyses of chickpea AQPs (CaAQPs). A total of 924 non-redundant AQPs were studied in 24 plant species including algae, mosses, lycophytes, monocots and dicots. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a clear divergence of eight AQP subfamilies (LIPs, SIPs, GIPs, NIPs, XIPs, PIPs, HIPs and TIPs). The comparative phylogenetic trees of AQP subfamilies among Arabidopsis, soybean, common bean, maize and chickpea demonstrated that the AQPs were highly species-specific. Interestingly, the dual NPA motif was conserved in all species. However, the ar/R selectivity filter signatures [W/T/S/N/G/A]-[V/S/L/I/A]-[S/G/A]-R (in NIPs), F-H-T-R (in PIPs), [H/N/Q/S]-[A/I/L/S/V]-[A/G]-[A/C/L/M/R/V] (in TIPs) and [V/I/L/M]-[V/I/A/F/M]-[A/S/F/C]-[N/F/L/I/A/S (in SIPs) were found in five species. Moreover, the Froger's positions (P1-P5) were found as [F/L/Y]-[S/T]-A-Y-[L/I/M/V/F] (in NIPs), [Q/E/M]-S-A-F-W (in PIPs), [A/L/S/T/V]-[A/C/N/S/T/V]-[P/R/S]-[Y/N/F]-[W/Q] (in TIPs) and [I/M/F]-[A/V]-[A/V]-Y-W (in SIPs). The MEME motif analyses showed that most of the motifs were specific to subfamily and subgroups. Tissue-specific expression profiling of CaAQPs revealed that CaTIPs and CaPIPs are highly expressed in most of the tissues, while CaNIPs and CaSIPs have low expression. In promoter analysis of CaAQPs, multiple stress-related cis-acting elements e.g. MYB, MYC, ABRE, etc. were found. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that CaPIP2;3 and CaNIP3;1 are positive regulator, while CaSIP1;1 and CaPIP2;1 have a negative role in drought tolerance. The findings and implications of this study are discussed in detail.
Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a relatively rare malignant neoplasm that occurs in salivary glands and various other organs. Recent studies have revealed that a significant proportion of ACCs harbor gene alterations involving MYB or MYBL1 (mostly fusions with NFIB) in a mutually-exclusive manner. However, its clinical significance remains to be well-established.
We investigated clinicopathological and molecular features of 36 ACCs with special emphasis on the significance of MYBL1 alterations. Reverse-transcription polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) were performed to detect MYB/MYBL1-NFIB fusions and MYBL1 alterations, respectively. Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate MYB expression in the tumors. The results were correlated with clinicopathological profiles of the patients.
RT-PCR revealed MYB-NFIB and MYBL1-NFIB fusions in 10 (27.8%) and 7 (19.4%) ACCs, respectively, in a mutually-exclusive manner. FISH for MYBL1 rearrangements was successfully performed in 11 cases, and the results were concordant with those of RT-PCR. Immunohistochemically, strong MYB expression was observed in 23 (63.9%) tumors, none of which showed MYBL1 alterations. Clinicopathologically, a trend of a better disease-specific survival was noted in patients with MYBL1 alterations than in those with MYB-NFIB fusions and/or strong MYB expression; however, the difference was not significant. Interestingly, we found tumors with MYBL1 alterations significantly frequently occurred in the mandibular regions (P = 0.012). Moreover, literature review revealed a similar tendency in a previous study.
Our results suggest that there are some biological or etiological differences between ACCs with MYB and MYBL1 alterations. Moreover, the frequent occurrence of MYBL1-associated ACC in the mandibular regions suggests that MYB immunohistochemistry is less useful in diagnosing ACCs arising in these regions. Further studies are warranted to verify our findings.
The Gap phases of the cell cycle are essential to perceive internal and external signals and control cell division and differentiation. However, our knowledge of molecular mechanisms underlying G2 progression in plants remains quite limited. In this review, we summarize recent findings about core G2-phase regulators, such as B-type cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and R1R2R3-type MYB transcription factors. We highlight developmental and stress signals that regulate expression and accumulation of the G2-phase regulators, and discuss how they fine-tune mitotic CDK activity and control cell proliferation, endoreplication and cell cycle checkpoints. A particular focus is on DNA damage-induced G2 arrest, which is prerequisite for maintenance of genome stability.
Phosphorus (P), an essential macronutrient, is pivotal for growth and development of plants. Availability of phosphate (Pi), the only assimilable P, is often suboptimal in rhizospheres. Pi deficiency triggers an array of spatiotemporal adaptive responses including the differential regulation of several transcription factors (TFs). Studies on MYB TF PHR1 in Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) and its orthologs OsPHRs in Oryza sativa (rice) have provided empirical evidence of their significant roles in the maintenance of Pi homeostasis. Since the functional characterization of PHR1 in 2001, several other TFs have now been identified in these model plants. This raised a pertinent question whether there are any likely interactions across these TFs. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system has provided an attractive paradigm for editing genome in plants. Here, we review the applications and challenges of this technique for genome editing of the TFs for deciphering the function and plausible interactions across them. This technology could thus provide a much-needed fillip towards engineering TFs for generating Pi use efficient plants for sustainable agriculture. Furthermore, we contemplate whether this technology could be a viable alternative to the controversial genetically modified (GM) rice or it may also eventually embroil into a limbo.
Recurrent or metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma (R/M ACC) is a malignant neoplasm of predominantly salivary gland origin for which effective therapies are lacking. We conducted a phase II trial evaluating the multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor lenvatinib in patients with R/M ACC.
This study was conducted with a two-stage minimax design. Patients with histologically confirmed R/M ACC of any primary site with radiographic and/or symptomatic progression were eligible. Any prior therapy was allowed except previous lenvatinib. Patients received lenvatinib 24 mg orally per day. The primary end point was overall response rate. Secondary end points were progression-free survival and safety. An exploratory analysis of how MYB expression and genomic alterations relate to outcomes was conducted.
Thirty-three patients were enrolled; 32 were evaluable for the primary end point. Five patients (15.6%) had a confirmed partial response, 24 patients (75%) had stable disease, two patients (6.3%) discontinued treatment as a result of toxicity before the first scan, and one patient (3.1%) had progression of disease as best response. Median progression-free survival time was 17.5 months (95% CI, 7.2 months to not reached), although only eight progression events were observed. Patients otherwise were removed for toxicity (n = 5), as a result of withdrawal of consent (n = 9), or at the treating physician's discretion (n = 6). Twenty-three patients required at least one dose modification, and 18 of 32 patients discontinued lenvatinib for drug-related issues. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were hypertension (n = 9; 28.1%) and oral pain (n = 3; 9.4%). Three grade 4 adverse events were observed (myocardial infarction, n = 1; posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, n = 1; and intracranial hemorrhage, n = 1).
This trial met the prespecified overall response rate primary end point, demonstrating antitumor activity with lenvatinib in R/M ACC patients. Toxicity was comparable to previous studies, requiring monitoring and management.
Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is an aggressive salivary gland malignancy without effective systemic therapies. Delineation of molecular profiles in ACC has led to an increased number of biomarker-stratified clinical trials; however, the clinical utility and U.S.-centric financial sustainability of integrated next-generation sequencing (NGS) in routine practice has, to our knowledge, not been assessed.
In our practice, NGS genotyping was implemented at the discretion of the primary clinician. We combined NGS-based mutation and fusion detection, with MYB break-apart fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and MYB immunohistochemistry. Utility was defined as the fraction of patients with tumors harboring alterations that are potentially amenable to targeted therapies. Financial sustainability was assessed using the fraction of global reimbursement.
Among 181 consecutive ACC cases (2011-2018), prospective genotyping was performed in 11% (n = 20/181; n = 8 nonresectable). Testing identified 5/20 (25%) NOTCH1 aberrations, 6/20 (30%) MYB-NFIB fusions (all confirmed by FISH), and 2/20 (10%) MYBL1-NFIB fusions. Overall, these three alterations (MYB/MYBL1/NOTCH1) made up 65% of patients, and this subset had a more aggressive course with significantly shorter progression-free survival. In 75% (n = 6/8) of nonresectable patients, we detected potentially actionable alterations. Financial analysis of the global charges, including NGS codes, indicated 63% reimbursement, which is in line with national (U.S.-based) and international levels of reimbursement CONCLUSION: Prospective routine clinical genotyping in ACC can identify clinically relevant subsets of patients and is approaching financial sustainability. Demonstrating clinical utility and financial sustainability in an orphan disease (ACC) requires a multiyear and multidimensional program.
Delineation of molecular profiles in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) has been accomplished in the research setting; however, the ability to identify relevant patient subsets in clinical practice has not been assessed. This work presents an approach to perform integrated molecular genotyping of patients with ACC with nonresectable, recurrent, or systemic disease. It was determined that 75% of nonresectable patients harbor potentially actionable alterations and that 63% of charges are reimbursed. This report outlines that orphan diseases such as ACC require a multiyear, multidimensional program to demonstrate utility in clinical practice.
Condensed tannins (CTs) have been studied extensively as potential defenses against pests and pathogens, and for their beneficial effects on human health. They are known to possess high in vitro antioxidant capacity, but whether they can function as in planta antioxidants for protection against oxidative stress has not been previously tested. Here, we show that stress induction of CTs in poplar (Populus) is matched closely by an increase in antioxidant activity under both high light and nitrogen deficiency. We also investigate the effects of CTs as in vivo antioxidants directly, using transgenic poplar plants which overexpress poplar MYB transcription factors that regulate the CT pathway. These transgenics have 50-fold higher CT concentrations than controls, and and also have dramatically higher antioxidant activity. High-CT and control poplar leaves were exposed to methyl viologen for 24 h. Chlorophyll fluorescence was used to measure maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II photochemistry (Fv/Fm), and leaf discs were stained with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) to assess hydrogen peroxide and superoxide levels. After methyl viologen exposure, high-CT transgenics retained higher Fv/Fm ratios and accumulated less hydrogen peroxide and superoxide than the controls. Our findings indicate that high-CT concentrations protect poplar against methyl viologen-induced oxidative stress and suggest a broader function of CTs than previously supposed.
cIMPACT-NOW (the Consortium to Inform Molecular and Practical Approaches to CNS Tumor Taxonomy) was established to provide a forum to evaluate and recommend proposed changes to future CNS tumor classifications. From 2016 to 2019 (Round 1), cIMPACT published four updates. Update 1 clarified the use of the term NOS (Not Otherwise Specified) and proposed use of the additional term NEC (Not Elsewhere Classified). Update 2 issued clarifications regarding two diagnoses: Diffuse Midline Glioma, H3 K27M-mutant and Diffuse Astrocytoma/Anaplastic Astrocytoma, IDH-mutant. Update 3 proposed molecular criteria that could be used in the setting of an IDH-wildtype diffuse or anaplastic astrocytic glioma without histological features of glioblastoma to infer that the tumor would behave similarly to a grade IV glioblastoma. Update 4 suggested that, in children and young adults, subtypes of IDH-wildtype / H3-wildtype diffuse gliomas may have distinct clinical features in the setting of a BRAFV600E mutation, FGFR1 alteration, other MAPK pathway alteration, or a MYB or MYBL1 rearrangement. The practical diagnostic relevance of these cIMPACT proposals is highlighted in this summary. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
c-Myb regulates tumorigenesis in multiple cancers. Here we show, for the first time, the mechanism of c-Myb-mediated proliferation, invasion, and drug resistance in ovarian cancer (OC), the most lethal gynecological cancer, and a comparative analyses of dietary agents, curcumin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), and sulforaphane in inhibiting c-Myb activity. We evaluated myb expression in patients with OC and found its increased expression in patients with cancer, compared with normal controls and in higher grade tumors, compared with low-grade tumors. Using ES2 and OVCAR3 cell line models, along with the silencing or overexpression of c-Myb, we establish a role of c-Myb in determining resistance to cisplatin. c-Myb overexpression activated NF-κB and STAT3 signaling leading to enhanced proliferation, invasion, and cisplatin resistance. Contrary to this, silencing of c-Myb inhibited proliferation, invasion, and sensitized OC cells to cisplatin. Further, among the dietary agents tested, EGCG almost completely inhibited the c-Myb-induced proliferation and invasion whereas sulforaphane also had significant inhibitory effect. Both compounds significantly sensitized OC cells to cisplatin, reversing the c-Myb effects. Higher c-Myb levels in patients with ovarian cancer lead to poor survival and our results indicate a possible effect of dietary factors EGCG and sulforaphane against c-Myb-mediated ovarian cancer progression and chemoresistance.
Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents a serious challenge for oncologists due to high incidence and large heterogeneity. Prognostic factors are needed to stratify patients according to risk of disease progression. In this study, we report that high expression of c-Myb protein, determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC), associates with better overall and disease-free survival (OS, DFS) in a cohort of 103 patients. Although MYB has been previously considered to act as oncogene in CRC, our further analysis of datasets deposited in PrognoScan and SurvExpress databases confirmed that high MYB expression largely associates with good prognosis in CRC. As therapies targeting c-Myb have been developed and tested in preclinical studies, we believe that further studies are needed for detailed understanding of c-Myb function in CRC, before the c-Myb-targeted therapy enters clinical trials.
Plants respond to herbivore or pathogen attacks by activating specific defense programs that include the production of bioactive specialized metabolites to eliminate or deter the attackers. Volatiles play an important role in the interaction of a plant with its environment. Through transcript profiling of jasmonate-elicited Medicago truncatula cells we identified Emission of Methyl Anthranilate (EMA) 1, a MYB transcription factor that is involved in the emission of the volatile compound methyl anthranilate when expressed in M. truncatula hairy roots, giving them a fruity scent. RNA-Seq analysis of the fragrant roots revealed the upregulation of a methyltransferase that was subsequently characterized to catalyze the O-methylation of anthranilic acid and was hence named M. truncatula Anthranilic Acid Methyl Transferase (MtAAMT) 1. Given that direct activation of the MtAAMT1 promoter by EMA1 could not be unambiguously demonstrated, we further probed the RNA-Seq data and identified the repressor protein M. truncatula Plant AT-rich sequence and Zinc-binding (MtPLATZ) 1. EMA1 binds a tandem repeat of the ACCTAAC motif in the MtPLATZ1 promoter to transactivate gene expression. Overexpression of MtPLATZ1 in transgenic M. truncatula hairy roots led to transcriptional silencing of EMA1, indicating that MtPLATZ1 may be part of a negative feedback loop to control the expression of EMA1. Finally, exogenous methyl anthranilate application boosted EMA1 and MtAAMT1 expression dramatically, thus also revealing a positive amplification loop. Such positive and negative feedback loops seem to be a norm rather than an exception in the regulation of plant specialized metabolism. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
The expression of ubiquitin specific peptidase 22 (USP22) is upregulated in several types of cancer, and has been implicated in tumorigenesis. Pirarubicin (THP), an anthracycline antineoplastic drug, can induce apoptosis of several types of cancer cells. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the action of THP remain to be elucidated. In the current study, treatment with THP induced HeLa cell apoptosis and decreased USP22 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. THP reduced the USP22 promoter-regulated luciferase activity, regardless of the mutation of transcriptional activator MYB or E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase SP1 binding sequences; however, this effect was abrogated by the mutation of cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) binding sequence in HeLa cells. Furthermore, the inhibition on the USP22 promoter activity by THP was not affected by overexpression of CREB-1 in HeLa cells. Additionally, treatment with THP significantly decreased the phosphorylation of CREB-1 at ser133 in HeLa cells. Quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that THP significantly inhibited the binding of CREB-1 to the USP22 promoter in HeLa cells. The present study demonstrated that THP decreased USP22 expression and promoted HeLa cell apoptosis partially by inhibiting the phosphorylation of CREB-1. The current results may provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the pharmacological effect of THP on cancer cell apoptosis.
Rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS) are a heterogeneous group of mesodermal tumors, the most common sub-types are embryonal (eRMS) and alveolar (aRMS) rhabdomyosarcoma. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed c-Myb expression in both eRMS and aRMS. c-Myb has been reported to be often associated with malignant human cancers. We therefore investigated the c-Myb role in RMS using cellular models of RMS. Specific suppression of c-Myb by a lentiviral vector expressing doxycycline (Dox)-inducible c-Myb shRNA inhibited proliferation, colony formation, and migration of the eRMS cell line (RD), but not of the aRMS cell line (RH30). Upon c-Myb knockdown in eRMS cells, cells accumulated in G0/G1 phase, the invasive behaviour of cells was repressed, and elevated levels of myosin heavy chain, marker of muscle differentiation, was detected. Next, we used an RD-based xenograft model to investigate the role of c-Myb in eRMS tumorigenesis in vivo. We found that Dox administration did not result in efficient suppression of c-Myb in growing tumors. However, when c-Myb-deficient RD cells were implanted into SCID mice, we observed inefficient tumor grafting and attenuation of tumor growth during the initial stages of tumor expansion. The presented study suggests that c-Myb could be a therapeutic target in embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma assuming that its expression is ablated.
High oncogenic risk human papillomaviruses (HR-HPVs) promote cervical carcinoma development, the fourth most common feminine cancer. A slow oncodevelopmental phase-defined histopathologically as Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) grades 1-3, or cytologically as Low- or High-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions (LSIL or HSIL)-precedes the malignancy. Cervical carcinoma screenings through HR-HPV genotyping and Pap smears are regularly performed in Western countries. Faulty cytology screening or genotyping or patients' non-compliance with follow-ups can let slip an oncoprogression diagnosis. Novel biomarker tests flanking HR-HPV genotyping and cytology could objectively predict the risk of disease progression thus helping triage LSIL/ASCUS patients. Here, anonymized leftovers of fresh cervical epithelium scrapings from twice (LSIL/ASCUS and HR-HPV DNA)-positive and twice (Pap smear- and HR-HPV DNA)-negative (control) patients in a proteome-preserving solution served to assess the biomarker worth of three cervical carcinoma-related proteins, i.e., B-MYB (or MYBL2), Cancerous Inhibitor of PP2A (CIP-2a), and transketolase-like1 (TKTL1). Leftovers anonymity was strictly kept and storage at -80°C, protein extraction, immunoblotting, and band densitometry were blindly performed. Only after tests completion, the anonymous yet code-corresponding HR-HPV-genotyping and cytology data allowed to assign each sample to the twice-positive or twice-negative group. Descriptive statistics showed that the three proteins levels significantly increased in the twice-positive vs. twice-negative scrapings. Diagnostic ROC curve analysis identified each protein's Optimal Decision Threshold (OTD) showing that TKTL1 and CIP-2a are stronger risk predictive biomarkers (Sensitivity, 0.91-0.93; Specificity, 0.77-0.83) than B-MYB. Logistic Regression coupled with Likelihood-Ratio Tests confirmed that a highly significant relation links increasing TKTL1/CIP-2a/B-MYB protein levels in twice-positive cervical scrapings to the risk of HR-HPV-driven oncoprogression. Finally, a 3 year clinical follow-up showed that 13 patients (50% of total) of the twice-positive group with biomarker values over OTDs compliantly underwent scheduled colposcopy and biopsy. Of these, 11 (i.e., 84.7%) received a positive histological diagnosis, i.e., CIN1 (n = 5; 38.5%) or CIN2/CIN2+ (n = 6; 46,2%). Therefore, TKTL1/CIP-2a/B-MYB protein levels could objectively predict oncoprogression risk in twice (HR-HPV- and Pap smear)-positive women. Further studies will assess the translatability of these findings into clinical settings.
'Jimba', a well-known white flowered chrysanthemum cultivar, occasionally and spontaneously produces red colored petals under natural cultivation, but there is little information about the molecular regulatory mechanism underlying this process. We analysed the expression patterns of 91 MYB transcription factors in 'Jimba' and 'Turning red Jimba' and identified an R3 MYB, CmMYB#7, whose expression was significantly decreased in 'Turning red Jimba' compared with 'Jimba', and confirmed it is a passive repressor of anthocyanin biosynthesis. CmMYB#7 competed with CmMYB6, which together with CmbHLH2 is an essential component of the anthocyanin activation complex, for interaction with CmbHLH2 through the bHLH binding site in the R3 MYB domain. This reduced binding of the CmMYB6-CmbHLH2 complex and inhibited its ability to activate CmDFR and CmUFGT promoters. Moreover, using transient expression assays we demonstrated that changes in the expression of CmMYB#7 accounted for alterations in anthocyanin content. Taken together, our findings illustrate that CmMYB#7 is a negative regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis in chrysanthemum.
Tumors are cellular ecosystems where different populations and subpopulations of cells coexist. Among these cells, cancer stem cells (CSCs) are considered to be the origin of the tumor mass, being involved in metastasis and in the resistance to conventional therapies. Furthermore, tumor cells have an enormous plasticity and a phenomenon of de-differentiation of mature tumor cells to CSCs may occur. Therefore, it is essential to identify genetic alterations that cause the de-differentiation of mature tumor cells to CSCs for the future design of therapeutic strategies. In this study, we characterized the role of MYBBP1A by experiments in cell lines, xenografts and human tumor samples. We have found that MYBBP1A downregulation increases c-MYB (Avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog) activity, leading to a rise in the stem-like cell population. We identified that the downregulation of MYBBP1A increases tumorigenic properties, in vitro and in vivo, in renal carcinoma cell lines that express high levels of c-MYB exclusively. Moreover, in a cohort of renal tumors, MYBBP1A is downregulated or lost in a significant percentage of tumors correlating with poor patient prognosis and a metastatic tendency. Our data support the role of MYBBP1A as a tumor suppressor by repressing c-MYB, acting as an important regulator of the plasticity of tumor cells.
The biological function and underlying mechanism of miR-1258 has seldom been investigated in cancer progression, including in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). In the current study, we revealed that the expression level of miR-1258 was significantly down-regulated in OSCC tissues and cell lines. Restoration of miR-1258 decreased OSCC cell growth and invasion. The luciferase and Western blot assays revealed that SP1 protein was a downstream target of miR-1258. Overexpression of SP1 dismissed miR-1258's effect on cell growth and invasion. We also revealed that c-Myb inhibited miR-1258 by directly binding at its promoter. In addition, miR-1258 inhibited PI3K/AKT and ERK signalling pathway activity. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that miR-1258 may function as a tumour-suppressive micorRNA in OSCC and suggested that miR-1258 may be a potential therapeutic target for OSCC patients.
Proanthocyanidins (PAs, also called condensed tannins), are an important class of secondary metabolites and exist widely in plants. Tea ( Camellia sinensis) is rich in PAs and their precursors, (-)-epicatechin (EC) and (+)-catechin (C). The biosynthesis of PAs is constantly regulated by many different MBW complexes, consisting of MYB transcription factors (TFs), basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs, and WD-repeat (WDR) proteins. These regulatory factors can be environmentally affected, such as by biotic and abiotic stresses. In this study, we revalidated the effect of sucrose treatment on tea branches, and a sucrose-induced MYB (SIMYB) TF was screened and studied. Phylogenetic analysis indicted that this SIMYB TF belonged to MYB subgroup 5, named CsMYB5b. Heterologous expression of CsMYB5b in tobacco strongly induced PA accumulation, through up-regulating the key target genes LAR or ANRs. In addition, CsMYB5b restored PA production in the seed coat of A. thaliana tt2 mutant and rescued its phenotype. Yeast two-hybrid assay demonstrated CsMYB5b can interact directly with CsTT8 (an AtTT8 ortholog) and CsWD40 protein. Linking to the expression profiling of CsMYB5b and the PA accumulation pattern in tea plants suggest that the CsMYB5b acts as an important switch for the synthesis of monomeric catechins and PAs. Therefore, these data provide insight into the regulatory mechanisms controlling the biosynthesis of PAs.
The flavonoids are important and nourishing compounds for plants and human. The transcription regulation of anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin (PA) biosynthesis was extensively studied in dicot compared with monocot plants. In this study, we characterized the functionality of an R2R3-MYB gene FhMYB5 from the monocotyledonous flowering plant of Iridaceae, Freesia hybrida. Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis implied that FhMYB5 was clustered into grapevine VvMYB5b subclade. Correlation analysis indicated that the spatio-temporal expression patterns of FhMYB5 coincided well with anthocyanin and PA accumulations in Freesia per se. Furthermore, transient transfection assays in Freesia protoplasts revealed that the late flavonoid biosynthetic genes (e.g., DFR and LDOX) were slightly up-regulated by FhMYB5 alone, whereas both early and late biosynthetic genes were significantly activated when FhMYB5 were co-infected with either of the two IIIf clade bHLH genes, FhTT8L and FhGL3L. Moreover, these results were further confirmed by co-transfection of FhMYB5 with either of the bHLH genes aforementioned into protoplasts expressing GUS reporter gene driven by Freesia promoters. In addition, the overexpression of FhMYB5 in tobacco and Arabidopsis could also significantly up-regulate the expression of genes participating in the general flavonoid pathway. In conclusion, FhMYB5 was proved to function in the general flavonoid pathway in Freesia. The results implied a function conservation of flavonoid biosynthesis related MYB regulators in angiosperm plants.
Human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocytes (hESC-Hep and hiPSC-Hep) have the potential to provide relevant human in vitro model systems for toxicity testing and drug discovery studies. In this study, the expression and function of important drug metabolizing cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and transporter proteins in hESC-Hep and hiPSC-Hep were compared to cryopreserved human primary hepatocytes (hphep) and HepG2 cells. Overall, CYP activities in hESC-Hep and hiPSC-Hep were much lower than in hphep cultured for 4 h, but CYP1A and 3A activities were comparable to levels in hphep cultured for 48h (CYP1A: 35% and 26% of 48 h hphep, respectively; CYP3A: 80% and 440% of 48 h hphep, respectively). Importantly, in hESC-Hep and hiPSC-Hep, CYP activities were stable or increasing for at least one week in culture which was in contrast to the rapid loss of CYP activities in cultured hphep between 4 and 48 h after plating. With regard to transporters, in hESC-Hep and hiPSC-Hep, pronounced NTCP activity (17% and 29% of 4 h hphep, respectively) and moderate BSEP activity (6% and 8% of 4 h hphep, respectively) were observed. Analyses of mRNA expression and immunocytochemistry supported the observed CYP and transporter activities and showed expression of additional CYPs and transporters. In conclusion, the stable expression and function of CYPs and transporters in hESC-Hep and hiPSC-Hep for at least one week opens up the possibility to reproducibly perform long term and extensive studies, e.g. chronic toxicity testing, in a stem cell-derived hepatic system.
Despite advances in our understanding of the molecular basis for particular subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), effective therapy remains a challenge for many individuals suffering from this disease. A significant proportion of both pediatric and adult AML patients cannot be cured and since the upper limits of chemotherapy intensification have been reached, there is an urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches. The transcription factor c-MYB has been shown to play a central role in the development and progression of AML driven by several different oncogenes, including mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)-fusion genes. Here, we have used a c-MYB gene expression signature from MLL-rearranged AML to probe the Connectivity Map database and identified mebendazole as a c-MYB targeting drug. Mebendazole induces c-MYB degradation via the proteasome by interfering with the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) chaperone system. Transient exposure to mebendazole is sufficient to inhibit colony formation by AML cells, but not normal cord blood-derived cells. Furthermore, mebendazole is effective at impairing AML progression in vivo in mouse xenotransplantation experiments. In the context of widespread human use of mebendazole, our data indicate that mebendazole-induced c-MYB degradation represents a safe and novel therapeutic approach for AML.
Metastasis accounts for most of cancer-related deaths. Paracrine signaling between tumor cells and the stroma induces changes in the tumor microenvironment required for metastasis. Transcription factor c-Myb was associated with breast cancer (BC) progression but its role in metastasis remains unclear. Here we show that increased c-Myb expression in BC cells inhibits spontaneous lung metastasis through impaired tumor cell extravasation. On contrary, BC cells with increased lung metastatic capacity exhibited low c-Myb levels. We identified a specific inflammatory signature, including Ccl2 chemokine, that was expressed in lung metastatic cells but was suppressed in tumor cells with higher c-Myb levels. Tumor cell-derived Ccl2 expression facilitated lung metastasis and rescued trans-endothelial migration of c-Myb overexpressing cells. Clinical data show that the identified inflammatory signature, together with a MYB expression, predicts lung metastasis relapse in BC patients. These results demonstrate that the c-Myb-regulated transcriptional program in BCs results in a blunted inflammatory response and consequently suppresses lung metastasis.
Although the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) has been shown to be critically involved in the transformation and progression of various tumors, little is known about the role of eIF4E in retinoblastoma. In this work, we report that ribavirin, a pharmacologic inhibitor of eIF4E function, effectively targets retinoblastoma and angiogenesis. Ribavirin treatment dose-dependently blocked the growth and stimulated apoptosis in various retinoblastoma cell lines, with IC50 values that are within the clinically achievable range. Ribavirin also significantly inhibited angiogenesis via disrupting capillary network formation and suppressing VEGF-induced migration, proliferation and survival of human retinal endothelial cells. In addition, ribavirin significantly augments chemotherapy agent's inhibitory effects in retinoblastoma in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, ribavirin inhibited eIF4E function in retinoblastoma cells as shown by the decreased protein levels of Cyclin D1, c-Myc and VEGF without affecting their mRNA expression. Overexpression of the wildtype and phosphormimetic but not the nonphosphorylatable form of eIF4E significantly abolished the inhibitory effects of ribavirin, further demonstrating eIF4E as the target of ribavirin. Genetic knockdown of eIF4E using two independent siRNAs mirrored ribavirin's effects, confirming the role of eIF4E in retinoblastoma growth, survival and response to chemotherapy. Our findings provide a preclinical rationale to explore ribavirin as a strategy to treat retinoblastoma and highlight the therapeutic value of targeting eIF4E in retinoblastoma.
Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is an aggressive cancer with no curative treatment for patients with recurrent/metastatic disease. The MYB-NFIB gene fusion is the main genomic hallmark and a potential therapeutic target.
Oncogenic signaling pathways were studied in cultured cells and/or tumors from 15 ACC patients. Phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) arrays were used to study the activity of RTKs. Effects of RTK inhibition on cell proliferation were analyzed with AlamarBlue, sphere assays, and two ACC xenograft models (n = 4-9 mice per group). The molecular effects of MYB-NFIB knockdown and IGF1R inhibition were studied with quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunoblot, and gene expression microarrays. All statistical tests were two-sided.
The MYB-NFIB fusion drives proliferation of ACC cells and is crucial for spherogenesis. Intriguingly, the fusion is regulated through AKT-dependent signaling induced by IGF1R overexpression and is downregulated upon IGF1R-inhibition (% expression of control ± SD = 27.2 ± 1.3, P &lt; .001). MYB-NFIB regulates genes involved in cell cycle control, DNA replication/repair, and RNA processing. The transcriptional program induced by MYB-NFIB affects critical oncogenic mediators normally controlled by MYC and is reversed by pharmacological inhibition of IGF1R. Co-activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and MET promoted proliferation of ACC cells, and combined targeting of IGFR1/EGFR/MET induced differentiation and synergistically inhibited the growth of patient-derived xenografted ACCs (ACCX5M1, % growth of control ± SD = 34.9 ± 20.3, P = .006; ACCX6, % growth of control ± SD = 24.1 ± 17.5, P = .04).
MYB-NFIB is an oncogenic driver and a key therapeutic target in ACC that is regulated by AKT-dependent IGF1R signaling. Our studies uncover a new strategy to target an oncogenic transcriptional master regulator and provide new important insights into the biology and treatment of ACC.
Glucosinolates (GSLs) are widely known secondary metabolites that have anticarcinogenic and antioxidative activities in humans and defense roles in plants of the Brassicaceae family. Some R2R3-type MYB (myeloblastosis) transcription factors (TFs) control GSL biosynthesis in Arabidopsis. However, studies on the MYB TFs involved in GSL biosynthesis in Brassica species are limited because of the complexity of the genome, which includes an increased number of paralog genes as a result of genome duplication. The recent completion of the genome sequencing of the Brassica species permits the identification of MYB TFs involved in GSL biosynthesis by comparative genome analysis with A. thaliana. In this review, we describe various findings on the regulation of GSL biosynthesis in Brassicaceae. Furthermore, we identify 63 orthologous copies corresponding to five MYB TFs from Arabidopsis, except MYB76 in Brassica species. Fifty-five MYB TFs from the Brassica species possess a conserved amino acid sequence in their R2R3 MYB DNA-binding domain, and share close evolutionary relationships. Our analysis will provide useful information on the 55 MYB TFs involved in the regulation of GSL biosynthesis in Brassica species, which have a polyploid genome.
MicroRNAs play an important role in T cell responses. However, how microRNAs regulate CD8 T cell memory remains poorly defined. Here, we found that miR-150 negatively regulates CD8 T cell memory in vivo. Genetic deletion of miR-150 disrupted the balance between memory precursor and terminal effector CD8 T cells following acute viral infection. Moreover, miR-150-deficient memory CD8 T cells were more protective upon rechallenge. A key circuit whereby miR-150 repressed memory CD8 T cell development through the transcription factor c-Myb was identified. Without miR-150, c-Myb was upregulated and anti-apoptotic targets of c-Myb, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, were also increased, suggesting a miR-150-c-Myb survival circuit during memory CD8 T cell development. Indeed, overexpression of non-repressible c-Myb rescued the memory CD8 T cell defects caused by overexpression of miR-150. Overall, these results identify a key role for miR-150 in memory CD8 T cells through a c-Myb-controlled enhanced survival circuit.
Cancer-associated p53 missense mutants confer gain of function (GOF) and promote tumorigenesis by regulating crucial signaling pathways. However, the role of GOF mutant p53 in regulating DNA replication, a commonly altered pathway in cancer, is less explored. Here, we show that enhanced Cdc7-dependent replication initiation enables mutant p53 to confer oncogenic phenotypes. We demonstrate that mutant p53 cooperates with the oncogenic transcription factor Myb in vivo and transactivates Cdc7 in cancer cells. Moreover, mutant p53 cells exhibit enhanced levels of Dbf4, promoting the activity of Cdc7/Dbf4 complex. Chromatin enrichment of replication initiation factors and subsequent increase in origin firing confirm increased Cdc7-dependent replication initiation in mutant p53 cells. Further, knockdown of CDC7 significantly abrogates mutant p53-driven cancer phenotypes in vitro and in vivo Importantly, high CDC7 expression significantly correlates with p53 mutational status and predicts poor clinical outcome in lung adenocarcinoma patients. Collectively, this study highlights a novel functional interaction between mutant p53 and the DNA replication pathway in cancer cells. We propose that increased Cdc7-dependent replication initiation is a hallmark of p53 gain-of-function mutations.
MYB transcription factors play important roles in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stress. In this study, TaODORANT1, a R2R3-MYB gene, was cloned from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). TaODORANT1 was localized in the nucleus and functioned as a transcriptional activator. TaODORANT1 was up-regulated in wheat under PEG6000, NaCl, ABA, and H2O2 treatments. TaODORANT1-overexpressing transgenic tobacco plants exhibited higher relative water content and lower water loss rate under drought stress, as well as lower Na+ accumulation in leaves under salt stress. The transgenic plants showed higher CAT activity but lower ion leakage, H2O2 and malondialdehyde contents under drought and salt stresses. Besides, the transgenic plants also exhibited higher SOD activity under drought stress. Our results also revealed that TaODORANT1 overexpression up-regulated the expression of several ROS- and stress-related genes in response to both drought and salt stresses, thus enhancing transgenic tobacco plants tolerance. Our studies demonstrate that TaODORANT1 positively regulates plant tolerance to drought and salt stresses.
When herbivores attack, plants specifically reconfigure their metabolism. Herbivory on the wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata strongly induces the R2R3 MYB transcriptional activator MYB8, which was reported to specifically regulate the accumulation of phenolamides (PAs). We discovered that transcriptional regulation of trypsin protease inhibitors (TPIs) and a threonine deaminase (TD) also depend on MYB8 expression. Induced distributions of PAs, TD and TPIs all meet predictions of optimal defense theory: their leaf concentrations increase with the fitness value and the probability of attack of the tissue. Therefore, we suggest that these defensive compounds have evolved to be co-regulated by MYB8.
There is a trend of increasing prevalence of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), and the inherited multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome serves as a genetic model to investigate how NETs develop and the underlying mechanisms. Menin, encoded by the MEN1 gene, at least partly acts as a scaffold protein by interacting with multiple partners to regulate cellular homeostasis of various endocrine organs. Menin has multiple functions including regulation of several important signaling pathways by controlling gene transcription. Here, we focus on reviewing the recent progress in elucidating the key biochemical role of menin in epigenetic regulation of gene transcription and cell signaling, as well as posttranslational regulation of menin itself. In particular, we will review the progress in studying structural and functional interactions of menin with various histone modifiers and transcription factors such as MLL, PRMT5, SUV39H1 and other transcription factors including c-Myb and JunD. Moreover, the role of menin in regulating cell signaling pathways such as TGF-beta, Wnt and Hedgehog, as well as miRNA biogenesis and processing will be described. Further, the regulation of the MEN1 gene transcription, posttranslational modifications and stability of menin protein will be reviewed. These various modes of regulation by menin as well as regulation of menin by various biological factors broaden the view regarding how menin controls various biological processes in neuroendocrine organ homeostasis.
The gene encoding the RUNX1 transcription factor is mutated in a subset of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients, and RUNX1 mutations are associated with a poor prognosis. These mutations cluster in the DNA-binding Runt domain and are thought to represent loss-of-function mutations, indicating that RUNX1 suppresses T-cell transformation. RUNX1 has been proposed to have tumor suppressor roles in T-cell leukemia homeobox 1/3-transformed human T-ALL cell lines and NOTCH1 T-ALL mouse models. Yet, retroviral insertional mutagenesis screens identify RUNX genes as collaborating oncogenes in MYC-driven leukemia mouse models. To elucidate RUNX1 function(s) in leukemogenesis, we generated Tal1/Lmo2/Rosa26-CreER
                        T2
                    Runx1
                        f/f
                     mice and examined leukemia progression in the presence of vehicle or tamoxifen. We found that Runx1 deletion inhibits mouse leukemic growth in vivo and that RUNX silencing in human T-ALL cells triggers apoptosis. We demonstrate that a small molecule inhibitor, designed to interfere with CBFβ binding to RUNX proteins, impairs the growth of human T-ALL cell lines and primary patient samples. We demonstrate that a RUNX1 deficiency alters the expression of a crucial subset of TAL1- and NOTCH1-regulated genes, including the MYB and MYC oncogenes, respectively. These studies provide genetic and pharmacologic evidence that RUNX1 has oncogenic roles and reveal RUNX1 as a novel therapeutic target in T-ALL.
Root hairs are specialized cells that are important for nutrient uptake. It is well established that nutrients such as phosphate have a great influence on root hair development in many plant species. Here we investigated the role of nitrate on root hair development at a physiological and molecular level. We showed that nitrate increases root hair density in Arabidopsis thaliana. We found that two different root hair defective mutants have significantly less nitrate than wild-type plants, suggesting that in A. thaliana root hairs have an important role in the capacity to acquire nitrate. Nitrate reductase-null mutants exhibited nitrate-dependent root hair phenotypes comparable with wild-type plants, indicating that nitrate is the signal that leads to increased formation of root hairs. We examined the role of two key regulators of root hair cell fate, CPC and WER, in response to nitrate treatments. Phenotypic analyses of these mutants showed that CPC is essential for nitrate-induced responses of root hair development. Moreover, we showed that NRT1.1 and TGA1/TGA4 are required for pathways that induce root hair development by suppression of longitudinal elongation of trichoblast cells in response to nitrate treatments. Our results prompted a model where nitrate signaling via TGA1/TGA4 directly regulates the CPC root hair cell fate specification gene to increase formation of root hairs in A. thaliana.
Increasing matrix stiffness caused by the extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition surrounding cancer cells is accompanied by epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Here, we show that expression levels of EMT marker genes along with discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) can increase upon matrix stiffening. DDR2 silencing by short hairpin RNA downregulated EMT markers. Promoter analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that c-Myb and LEF1 may be responsible for DDR2 induction during cell culture on a stiff matrix. Mechanistically, c-Myb acetylation by p300, which is upregulated on the stiff matrix, seems to be necessary for the c-Myb-and-LEF1-mediated DDR2 expression. Finally, we found that the c-Myb-DDR2 axis is crucial for lung cancer cell line proliferation and expression of EMT marker genes in a stiff environment. Thus, our results suggest that DDR2 regulation by p300 expression and/or c-Myb acetylation upon matrix stiffening may be necessary for regulation of EMT and invasiveness of lung cancer cells.
This study intended to investigate the role of microRNA-27b (miR-27b) in proliferation of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells and to explore the potential molecular mechanism. Cell proliferation was detected by MTT assay. The expression levels of miR-27b, Frizzled7 (FZD7), cyclin D1 and c-myc were detected by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The protein expression level of FZD7 was detected by western blot analysis. The relationship between miR-27b and FZD7, and the activity of Wnt signaling pathway were determined using luciferase reporter assay. The miR-27b expression in OSCC cell lines was significantly decreased compared with control. Overexpression of miR-27b remarkably inhibited OSCC cell proliferation. Additionally, miR-27b could target and inhibit FZD7 expression and decrease the activity of Wnt signaling pathway.miR-27b could inhibit OSCC cell proliferation through inhibiting FZD7 and FZD7-mediated Wnt signaling pathway.
The CAPRICE (CPC) encodes an R3-type MYB transcription factor, which promotes root-hair differentiation. Previously, we showed that the CPC protein moves from the non-hair cell to the neighboring cell and induces root-hair differentiation in Arabidopsis. In addition, we proposed two cell-to-cell movement signal sequences, S1 and S2, in CPC. However, an S1:2xGFP:S2 chimera protein did not move between root epidermal cells. Here, we show that the S1 and S2 sequences do not confer cell-to-cell movement or nuclear localization ability to a GFP protein. The ENHANCER OF TRY AND CPC1 (ETC1) gene encodes the CPC homolog R3 MYB; this protein does not possess cell-to-cell movement ability or the S1 sequence. To elucidate whether the S1 sequence can induce cell-to-cell movement ability in ETC1, CPCp:S1:ETC1:2xGFP was constructed and introduced into Arabidopsis. Our results indicate that the addition of the S1 sequence was not sufficient for ETC1 to acquire cell-to-cell movement ability.
The term 'undruggable' was coined to describe proteins that could not be targeted pharmacologically. However, progress is being made to 'drug' many of these targets, and therefore more appropriate terms might be 'difficult to drug' or 'yet to be drugged'. Many desirable targets in cancer fall into this category, including the RAS and MYC oncogenes, and pharmacologically targeting these intractable proteins is now a key challenge in cancer research that requires innovation and the development of new technologies. In this Viewpoint article, we asked four scientists working in this field for their opinions on the most crucial advances, as well as the challenges and what the future holds for this important area of research.
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a subclass of noncoding RNAs widely expressed in mammalian cells. We report here the tumorigenic capacity of a circRNA derived from angiomotin-like1 (circ-Amotl1). Circ-Amotl1 is highly expressed in patient tumor samples and cancer cell lines. Single-cell inoculations using circ-Amotl1-transfected tumor cells showed a 30-fold increase in proliferative capacity relative to control. Agarose colony-formation assays similarly revealed a 142-fold increase. Tumor-take rate in nude mouse xenografts using 6-day (219 cells) and 3-day (9 cells) colonies were 100%, suggesting tumor-forming potential of every cell. Subcutaneous single-cell injections led to the formation of palpable tumors in 41% of mice, with tumor sizes &gt;1 cm3 in 1 month. We further found that this potent tumorigenicity was triggered through interactions between circ-Amotl1 and c-myc. A putative binding site was identified in silico and tested experimentally. Ectopic expression of circ-Amotl1 increased retention of nuclear c-myc, appearing to promote c-myc stability and upregulate c-myc targets. Expression of circ-Amotl1 also increased the affinity of c-myc binding to a number of promoters. Our study therefore reveals a novel function of circRNAs in tumorigenesis, and this subclass of noncoding RNAs may represent a potential target in cancer therapy.
Microglia are increasingly implicated in brain pathology, particularly neurodegenerative disease, with many genes implicated in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and motor neuron disease expressed in microglia. There is, therefore, a need for authentic, efficient in vitro models to study human microglial pathological mechanisms. Microglia originate from the yolk sac as MYB-independent macrophages, migrating into the developing brain to complete differentiation. Here, we recapitulate microglial ontogeny by highly efficient differentiation of embryonic MYB-independent iPSC-derived macrophages then co-culture them with iPSC-derived cortical neurons. Co-cultures retain neuronal maturity and functionality for many weeks. Co-culture microglia express key microglia-specific markers and neurodegenerative disease-relevant genes, develop highly dynamic ramifications, and are phagocytic. Upon activation they become more ameboid, releasing multiple microglia-relevant cytokines. Importantly, co-culture microglia downregulate pathogen-response pathways, upregulate homeostatic function pathways, and promote a more anti-inflammatory and pro-remodeling cytokine response than corresponding monocultures, demonstrating that co-cultures are preferable for modeling authentic microglial physiology.
This perspective describes the usefulness of zebrafish as a model to study interaction of hematopoietic stem cells with the associated niche in vivo, explains how such interactions influence regeneration, migration, and clonality of HSCs, and defines their fate during differentiation.
Basal-like/triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are among the most aggressive forms of breast cancer, and disproportionally affects young premenopausal women and women of African descent. Patients with TNBC suffer a poor prognosis due in part to a lack of molecularly targeted therapies, which represents a critical barrier for effective treatment. Here, we identify EphA2 receptor tyrosine kinase as a clinically relevant target for TNBC. EphA2 expression is enriched in the basal-like molecular subtype in human breast cancers. Loss of EphA2 function in both human and genetically engineered mouse models of TNBC reduced tumor growth in culture and in vivo. Mechanistically, targeting EphA2 impaired cell cycle progression through S-phase via downregulation of c-Myc and stabilization of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27/KIP1. A small molecule kinase inhibitor of EphA2 effectively suppressed tumor cell growth in vivo, including TNBC patient-derived xenografts. Thus, our data identify EphA2 as a novel molecular target for TNBC.
Cancer stem cells (CSC) are considered the major cause of aggressive tumor behavior, recurrence, metastases, and resistance to radiation, making them an attractive therapeutic target. However, isolation of CSC from tumor tissue and their characterization are challenging due to uncertainty about their molecular markers and conditions for their propagation. Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), which arises predominantly in the salivary glands, is a slow-growing but relentless tumor that frequently invades nerves and metastasizes. New effective treatment approaches for ACC have not emerged over the last 40years. Previously, based on a highly conserved SOX10 gene signature that we identified in the majority of ACC tumors, we suggested the existence in ACC of SOX10+ cells with neural stem properties and corroborated this hypothesis via isolation from ACC tissue a novel population of CSC, termed ACC-CSC. These cells activated NOTCH1 signaling and co-expressed SOX10 and other ACC-intrinsic neural crest stem cell markers with CD133, a CSC cell surface marker, suggesting that ACC is driven by a previously uncharacterized population of SOX10+/CD133+ cells with neural stem cell properties. Here, we authenticated ACC identity of our primary cultures by demonstrating that most of them harbor MYB-NFIB fusions, which are found in 86% of ACC. We demonstrated using CyTOF, a novel mass cytometry technology, that these cells express high β-catenin and STAT3 levels and are marked by CD24 and CD44. Finally, to streamline development of ACC cell lines, we developed RT-PCR tests for distinguishing mouse and human cells and used immunomagnetic cell sorting to eliminate mouse cells from long-term cell cultures. Overall, this study describes a new population of CSC that activates signaling pathways associated with poor prognosis, validates their ACC identity, and optimizes approaches that can be used for purification of ACC-CSC and generation of cell lines.
Breast adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a primary breast carcinoma that, like salivary gland ACC, displays the t(6;9) translocation resulting in the MYB-NFIB gene fusion and immunopositivity for MYB by immunohistochemistry (IHC). However, it is not well established whether MYB immunoreactivity or rearrangement can be used to support a diagnosis of ACC in a malignant basaloid or benign cribriform breast lesion. Whole sections of primary breast ACC (n=11), collagenous spherulosis (CS; n=7), and microglandular adenosis (MGA; n=5) and tissue microarrays containing 16 basal-like, triple-negative breast carcinomas (TNBC) were labeled for MYB by IHC and underwent MYB fluorescence in situ hybridization using a break-apart probe. Strong, diffuse nuclear MYB labeling was seen in 100% ACC compared with no cases of basal-like TNBC, CS, or MGA (P=0.0001). Any degree of nuclear MYB labeling was seen in 100% ACC compared with 54% of all other cases (P=0.007), with any labeling seen in 71% CS, 63% basal-like TNBC, and 0% MGA. MYB rearrangement was detected in 89% (8/9) of evaluable ACC compared with 4% (1/26) of all other evaluable cases (P=0.0001), with a rearrangement detected in 1 (7%; n=1/15) evaluable basal-like TNBC. Strong, diffuse nuclear labeling for MYB is more sensitive than MYB fluorescence in situ hybridization for breast ACC and can be used to support a diagnosis of ACC in a cribriform or basaloid lesion in the breast. However, weak and focal labeling should be interpreted with caution as it can be seen in other benign cribriform and malignant basaloid lesions.
LIM-domain proteins, containing multiple cysteine-rich zinc finger-like motifs, have been shown to play diverse roles in several cellular processes. A common theme is that they mediate important protein-protein interactions that are key to their function. Androgen receptor-associated protein 55 (ARA55) belongs to this family of bridging proteins containing four C-terminal LIM domains. It has a dual role with functions both at focal adhesions and in the nucleus, apparently shuttling between the two compartments. In the present work, we have expanded our understanding of its nuclear functions by showing that it interacts with three nuclear regulators not previously linked to ARA55. We first identified ARA55 as a novel interaction partner of the nuclear kinase HIPK1 and found that ARA55, like HIPK1, also interacts with the transcription factor c-Myb. In search of a function for these associations, we observed that the coactivator p300 not only binds to c-Myb, but to ARA55 as well. When combined, c-Myb, p300, HIPK1 and ARA55 caused strong synergistic activation of a chromatinized reporter gene. In parallel, all partners, including p300, were efficiently recruited to chromatin at the c-Myb-bound promoter. Consistent with this cooperation, we found that c-Myb and ARA55 share a common set of target genes in an osteosarcoma cellular context. We propose that ARA55 and HIPK1 assist c-Myb in recruiting the coactivator and acetyltransferase p300 to chromatin.
The transcription factor c-Myb is involved in early differentiation and proliferation of haematopoietic cells, where it operates as a regulator of self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation. Deregulated c-Myb plays critical roles in leukaemias and other human cancers. Due to its role as a master regulator, we hypothesized it might function as a pioneer transcription factor. Our approach to test this was to analyse a mutant of c-Myb, D152V, previously reported to cause haematopoietic defects in mice by an unknown mechanism. Our transcriptome data from K562 cells indicates that this mutation specifically affects c-Myb's ability to regulate genes involved in differentiation, causing failure in c-Myb's ability to block differentiation. Furthermore, we see a major effect of this mutation in assays where chromatin opening is involved. We show that each repeat in the minimal DNA-binding domain of c-Myb binds to histones and that D152V disrupts histone binding of the third repeat. ATAC-seq data indicates this mutation impairs the ability of c-Myb to cause chromatin opening at specific sites. Taken together, our findings support that c-Myb acts as a pioneer factor and show that D152V impairs this function. The D152V mutant is the first mutant of a transcription factor specifically destroying pioneer factor function.
Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum) is a traditional coarse cereal that exhibits strong plasticity in its adaptation to harsh and complicated environmental stresses. In an attempt to study the strong tolerance of tartary buckwheat, the FtMYB9 gene, which encodes an R2R3-MYB transcription factor protein, was functionally investigated. FtMYB9 expression was rapidly and strongly induced by ABA, cold, salt, and drought treatments in the seedling stage. A yeast one-hybrid system assay indicated that FtMYB9 is an activator of transcriptional activity, consistent with its roles as a transcription factor. Its overexpression in plants resulted in increased sensitivity to ABA at the germination and seedling stages compared to wild type. The overexpression of FtMYB9 increased tolerance to drought and salt stresses by the activation of some stress-related genes from both ABA-independent and ABA-dependent pathways in transgenic Arabidopsis. Furthermore, enhanced proline content and the activation of the P5CS1 gene implied that FtMYB9 may be involved in proline synthesis in plants. Collectively, these results suggest that FtMYB9 functions as a novel R2R3-MYB TF which plays positive roles in salt and drought tolerance by regulating different stress-responsive signaling pathways.
SETBP1 is a SET-binding protein regulating self-renewal potential through HOXA-protein activation. Somatic SETBP1 mutations were identified by whole exome sequencing in several phenotypes of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN), including atypical chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia as well as in secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML). Surprisingly, its recurrent somatic activated mutations are located at the identical positions of germline mutations reported in congenital Schinzel-Giedion syndrome. In general, somatic SETBP1 mutations have a significant clinical impact on the outcome as poor prognostic factor, due to downstream HOXA-pathway as well as associated aggressive types of chromosomal defects (-7/del(7q) and i(17q)), which is consistent with wild-type SETBP1 activation in aggressive types of acute myeloid leukemia and leukemic evolution. Biologically, mutant SETBP1 attenuates RUNX1 and activates MYB. The studies of mouse models confirmed biological significance of SETBP1 mutations in myeloid leukemogenesis, particularly associated with ASXL1 mutations. SETBP1 is a major oncogene in myeloid neoplasms, which cooperates with various genetic events and causes distinct phenotypes of MDS/MPN and sAML.
Booreana mice carrying the c-Myb308G point mutation were analyzed to determine changes in early hematopoiesis in the bone marrow and among mature cells in the periphery. This point mutation led to increased numbers of early hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), with a subsequent reduction in the development of B cells, erythroid cells, and neutrophils, and increased numbers of myeloid cells and granulocytes. Myelopoiesis was further investigated by way of particular subsets affected. A specific question addressed whether booreana mice contained increased numbers of dendritic-like cells (L-DC subset) recently identified in the spleen, since L-DCs arise in vitro by direct differentiation from HSPCs co-cultured over splenic stroma. The non-lethal c-Myb mutation in booreana mice was associated with significantly lower representation of splenic CD8- conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), inflammatory monocytes, and neutrophils compared to wild-type mice. This result confirmed the bone marrow origin of progenitors for these subsets since c-Myb is essential for their development. Production of L-DCs and resident monocytes was not affected by the c-MybE308G mutation. These subsets may derive from different progenitors than those in bone marrow, and are potentially established in the spleen during embryogenesis. An alternative explanation may be needed for why there was no change in CD8+ cDCs in booreana spleen since these cells are known to derive from common dendritic progenitors in bone marrow.
Plant 3R-MYB transcription factors are an important subgroup of the MYB super family in plants; however, their evolutionary history and functions remain poorly understood. We identified 225 3R-MYB proteins from 65 plant species, including algae and all major lineages of land plants. Two segmental duplication events preceding the common ancestor of angiosperms have given rise to three subgroups of the 3R-MYB proteins. Five conserved introns in the domain region of the 3R-MYB genes were identified, which arose through a step-wise pattern of intron gain during plant evolution. Alternative splicing (AS) analysis of selected species revealed that transcripts from more than 60% of 3R-MYB genes undergo AS. AS could regulate transcriptional activity for some of the plant 3R-MYBs by generating different regulatory motifs. The 3R-MYB genes of all subgroups appear to be enriched for Mitosis-Specific Activator (MSA) element core sequences within their upstream promoter region, which suggests a functional involvement in cell cycle. Notably, expression of 3R-MYB genes from different species exhibits differential regulation under various abiotic stresses. These data suggest that the plant 3R-MYBs function in both cell cycle regulation and abiotic stress response, which may contribute to the adaptation of plants to a sessile lifestyle.
This study aims to investigate the molecular mechanism of injury development in the cortex and the striatum after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R).
Gene expression data (GSE23160) in the cortex and the striatum of an intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion-I/R mouse model (N = 12) and sham controls (N = 4) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Limma package was used to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the I/R (2, 8, and 24 hours) and control groups. Correlation analysis was then performed to identify the highly correlated differentially expressed genes (HCDEGs). STRING and Cytoscape software were used to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of HCDEGs. Furthermore, Venny 2.0 was used to identify common overlapped DEGs whose transcription factors (TFs) were predicted using iRegulon in Cytoscape.
For the cortex and the striatum, 2295 and 2282 DEGs were respectively identified between the I/R group and the controls, and were classified into 3 and 2 correlation modules. For each module, a PPI network was constructed, and Toll-like receptor 2 (Tlr2, degree = 25), interleukin 1β (Il1b, degree = 21), and heme oxygenase-1 (Hmox1, degree = 17) had high connective degrees. Furthermore, 29 common overlapped DEGs were found across time and tissue, which might be targeted by 13 TFs. Especially, Tlr2, Il1b, and Hmox1 were targeted by myeloblastosis protein (Myb, target count = 16) and FBJ osteosarcoma protein (Fos, target count = 15). Moreover, plasminogen activator urokinase receptor (Plaur) was targeted by Fos, and it was an HCDEG in correlation modules of both cortex and striatum. Upregulation of Tlr2, Il1b, Hmox1, and Plaur in I/R injury was confirmed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining.
Tlr2, Il1b, Hmox1, and Plaur regulated by Myb and Fos might participate in cortex and striatum injury after cerebral I/R.
Humoral immune responses are tailored to the invading pathogen through regulation of key transcription factors and their networks. This is critical to establishing effective antibody-mediated responses, yet it is unknown how B cells integrate pathogen-induced signals to drive or suppress transcriptional programs specialized for each class of pathogen. Here, we detail the key role of the transcription factor c-Myb in regulating the T-bet-mediated anti-viral program. Deletion of c-Myb in mature B cells significantly increased serum IgG2c and CXCR3 expression by upregulating T-bet, normally suppressed during Th2-cell-mediated responses. Enhanced expression of T-bet resulted in aberrant plasma cell differentiation within the germinal center, mediated by CXCR3 expression. These findings identify a dual role for c-Myb in limiting inappropriate effector responses while coordinating plasma cell differentiation with germinal center egress. Identifying such intrinsic regulators of specialized antibody responses can assist in vaccine design and therapeutic intervention in B-cell-mediated immune disorders.
Developing B lymphocytes undergo clonal expansion following successful immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement. During this proliferative burst, expression of the Rag genes is transiently repressed to prevent the generation of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) breaks in cycling large pre-B cells. The Rag genes are then reexpressed in small, resting pre-B cells for immunoglobulin light chain gene rearrangement. We previously identified c-Myb as a repressor of Rag transcription during clonal expansion using Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed B cells. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms by which c-Myb achieved precise spatiotemporal repression of Rag expression remained obscure. Here, we identify two mechanisms by which c-Myb represses Rag transcription. First, c-Myb negatively regulates the expression of the Rag activator Foxo1, an activity dependent on M303 in c-Myb's transactivation domain, and likely the recruitment of corepressors to the Foxo1 locus by c-Myb. Second, c-Myb represses Rag transcription directly by occupying the Erag enhancer and antagonizing Foxo1 binding to a consensus forkhead site in this cis-regulatory element that we show is crucial for Rag expression in Abelson pre-B cell lines. This work provides important mechanistic insight into how spatiotemporal expression of the Rag genes is tightly controlled during B lymphocyte development to prevent mistimed dsDNA breaks and their deleterious consequences.
Increased Hb F levels can ameliorate the symptoms of β-thalassemia (β-thal). Due to the genetic heterogenicity of β-thal, the relationship between genetic variants in modifier genes and Hb F level has been studied in different populations. The Chinese Zhuang has the second largest population in China and has 6.78% prevalence of β-thal. However, the effects of these single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants on the Hb F levels of β-thal intermedia (β-TI) patients in this population have not been reported. To explore the association between modifier loci (β-globin gene cluster, HBS1L-MYB intergenic region and BCL11A) and Hb F levels in Chinese Zhuang β-TI patients, 96 unrelated β-TI patients (50 males and 46 females) with different Hb F levels were recruited and genotyped by mass spectrometry. A total of 13 SNPs were confirmed to be in a significant relationship with Hb F levels in this population. Of these, high-risk genotypes of six Hb F-associated SNPs, rs9376090, rs7776054, rs9399137, rs9389268, rs9402685 in the HBS1L-MYB intergenic region and rs189984760 in the BCL11A locus, showed association with high Hb F levels, especially for SNPs in linkage disequilibrium. One novel Hb F-associated SNP, rs189984760, was identified in our study. Our findings will be of valuable reference for correlation between modifier genes and Hb F in Chinese Zhuang populations and may lead to better understand the modifying mechanisms for β-thal.
We aimed to investigate the distribution of selected BCL11A and HMIP polymorphisms (SNP's), and to assess the correlation with HPFH in a cohort of sickle cell patients.
A preliminary cross-sectional study was conducted in 102 patients. Group 1 was composed of patients with HPFH and Group 2 consisted of patients without HbF. We assessed 8 SNPs previously associated with HPFH in cohorts genetically close to the Congolese population. Observed frequencies were compared to expected frequencies.
In the group 1, at rs7606173, the observed frequency for the genotype GG was significantly higher and the genotype GC was significantly lower than their respective expected frequencies. At rs9399137, the observed frequency of the genotype TT was significantly lower than expected. Conversely, the observed frequency of the genotype TC was significantly higher than expected. The observed frequency of the genotype TT at rs11886868 was significantly lower than the expected whereas the frequency of the genotype TC was significantly higher than observed. The lowest HbF level was recorded in patients with genotype CC at rs11886868.
In this preliminary study, the results demonstrate that alleles of some of the 8 studied SNPs are not randomly distributed among patients with or without HPFH in this cohort.
Knowledge of staining pattern of certain immunostains might be useful in the classification of cutaneous adnexal tumors that can have clinical importance. We studied GATA3 and MYB expression in archival materials of 220 adnexal tumors comprised of sebaceous carcinomas, follicular tumors, apocrine carcinoma, predominantly apocrine tumors, predominantly eccrine tumors, and others including adenoid cystic carcinomas. Nuclear GATA3 expression was seen in 70% (153/220) of cases, including sebaceous carcinoma (93%), apocrine carcinoma (93%), follicular neoplasms (100%), and predominantly apocrine neoplasms (69%), yet only 38% of predominantly eccrine neoplasms. Nuclear MYB expression was seen in 43% (81/188) of cases, including adenoid cystic carcinoma (90%), predominantly apocrine tumors (66%), follicular neoplasms (49%), apocrine carcinomas (14%), predominantly eccrine tumors (11%), and sebaceous carcinomas (4%). GATA3 and MYB expression were noted in 43% (9/21) and 24% (5/21) of cutaneous metastases, respectively. Expression of both GATA3 and MYB was noted in 33% (60/184) of primary adnexal tumors versus 19% (4/21) of cutaneous metastases. GATA3 preferentially labels tumors with follicular, sebaceous, and apocrine differentiation. MYB is potentially a helpful stain in the distinction of desmoplastic trichoepithelioma versus basal cell carcinoma. The coexpression of GATA3 and MYB might be helpful in the distinction of primary cutaneous adnexal carcinoma versus metastatic breast, salivary gland, or urothelial carcinoma.
The Arabidopsis thaliana R2R3-MYB transcription factor MYB12 is a light-inducible, flavonol-specific activator of flavonoid biosynthesis. The transactivation activity of the AtMYB12 protein was analyzed using a C-terminal deletion series in a transient A. thaliana protoplast assay with the goal of mapping the activation domain (AD). Although the deletion of the last 46 C-terminal amino acids did not affect the activation capacity, the deletion of the last 98 amino acids almost totally abolished transactivation of two different target promoters. A domain swap experiment using the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain revealed that the region from positions 282 to 328 of AtMYB12 was sufficient for transactivation. In contrast to the R2R3-MYB ADs known thus far, that of AtMYB12 is not located at the rearmost C-terminal end of the protein. The AtMYB12 AD is conserved in other experimentally proven R2R3-MYB flavonol regulators from different species.
Oncogenic driver mutations are those that provide a proliferative or survival advantage to neoplastic cells, resulting in clonal selection. Although most cancer-causing mutations have been detected in the protein-coding regions of the cancer genome; driver mutations have recently also been discovered within noncoding genomic sequences. Thus, a current challenge is to gain precise understanding of how these unique genomic elements function in cancer pathogenesis, while clarifying mechanisms of gene regulation and identifying new targets for therapeutic intervention. Here we report a C-to-T single nucleotide transition that occurs as a somatic mutation in noncoding sequences 4 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site of the LMO1 oncogene in primary samples from patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. This single nucleotide alteration conforms to an APOBEC-like cytidine deaminase mutational signature, and generates a new binding site for the MYB transcription factor, leading to the formation of an aberrant transcriptional enhancer complex that drives high levels of expression of the LMO1 oncogene. Since APOBEC-signature mutations are common in a broad spectrum of human cancers, we suggest that noncoding nucleotide transitions such as the one described here may activate potent oncogenic enhancers not only in T-lymphoid cells but in other cell lineages as well.
MicroRNA (miRNA) biogenesis is finely controlled by complex layers of post-transcriptional regulators, including RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Here, we show that an RBP, QKI5, activates the processing of primary miR-124-1 (pri-124-1) during erythropoiesis. QKI5 recognizes a distal QKI response element and recruits Microprocessor through interaction with DGCR8. Furthermore, the recruited Microprocessor is brought to pri-124-1 stem loops by a spatial RNA-RNA interaction between two complementary sequences. Thus, mutations disrupting their base-pairing affect the strength of QKI5 activation. When erythropoiesis proceeds, the concomitant decrease of QKI5 releases Microprocessor from pri-124-1 and reduces mature miR-124 levels to facilitate erythrocyte maturation. Mechanistically, miR-124 targets TAL1 and c-MYB, two transcription factors involved in normal erythropoiesis. Importantly, this QKI5-mediated regulation also gives rise to a unique miRNA signature, which is required for erythroid differentiation. Taken together, these results demonstrate the pivotal role of QKI5 in primary miRNA processing during erythropoiesis and provide new insights into how a distal element on primary transcripts affects miRNA biogenesis.
Solute carrier family 34 member 2 (SLC34A2), a pH-sensitive sodium-dependent phosphate transporter, is associated with several human cancers. In this study, we investigate the clinical significance of SLC34A2 and its function in human bladder cancer (BC). The expression dynamics of SLC34A2 were examined in two independent cohorts of BC samples by quantitative PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemical staining. In the training cohort (156 cases), we applied the X-tile program software to assess the optimal cutoff points for biomarkers in order to accurately classify patients according to clinical outcome. In the validation cohort (130 cases), the cutoff score derived from X-title analysis was investigated to determine the association of SLC34A2 expression with survival outcome. A series of in vitro and in vivo assays were then performed to elucidate the function of SLC34A2 in BC and its underlying mechanisms. Results showed that SLC34A2 was significantly upregulated in BC cell lines and clinical samples. In both two cohorts of BC samples, high expression of SLC34A2 was associated with large tumor size, advanced T status and poor patients' survival. The depletion of SLC34A2 in BC suppressed cellular viability, colony formation and anchorage-independent growth in vitro, and inhibited xenograft tumor growth in vivo, whereas overexpression of SLC34A2 had the converse effect. Simultaneously, downregulation of SLC34A2 decreased the transcriptional activity and protein expression level of c-Myc in BC cells, whereas restoration of c-Myc expression could compromise the anti-proliferation effect of SLC34A2 depletion. Furthermore, miR-214 was proved as a negative regulator of SLC34A2. Our present study illustrated that SLC34A2 has an important role in promoting proliferation and tumorigenicity of BC, and may represent a novel therapeutic target for this disease.
To investigate the expression of kisspeptin in gastric adenocarcinoma and its effect on the proliferation and migration of gastric cancer cells.
The level of kisspeptin in 50 gastric cancer tissues and their paracancerous tissues were detected by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting. Kisspeptin-siRNA,control-siRNA,p EGFP-N1-kisspeptin,p EGFP-N1 were separately transfected into MKN-45 gastric cancer cells. After 48-hour culture,the levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2( MMP-2),β-catenin,C-myc,MMP-9,kisspeptin were detected by Western blotting; MTT assay was used to detect the proliferation of MKN-45 cells; wound healing assay was performed to assess the migration ability of MKN-45 cells. After MKN-45 cells were treated with Wnt / β-catenin signal pathway inhibitor FH535,MTT assay and flow cytometry were used to evaluate cell proliferation ability and cell apoptosis,respectively.
Kisspeptin expression in gastric adenocarcinoma tissues was significantly lower than that of the adjacent normal tissues. The cell survival rate and migration rate of p EGFP-N1-kisspeptin group were significantly lower than those of p EGFP-N1 group. Cell survival rate and migration rate of kisspeptin-siRNA group were significantly higher than those of control siRNA group. The levels of MMP-9,MMP-2,β-catenin and C-myc in p EGFP-N1-kisspeptin group were significantly lower than those in p EGFP-N1 group. The levels of MMP-9, MMP-2, β-catenin and C-myc in kisspeptin-siRNA group were significantly higher than those in control-siRNA group. The proliferation and migration trend of gastric cancer cells treated with FH535 was similar to that of the p EGFP-N1-kisspeptin group.
The expression of kisspeptin decreases in gastric cancer tissues,and kisspeptin can interact with Wnt / β-catenin signaling pathway to inhibit the proliferation and migration of gastric cancer cells.
To investigate the influence of hepatic stellate cells( HSCs) on malignant biological behavior of hepatoma cells and related mechanisms.
Human hepatoma cell lines SMMC-7721 and Hep G2,and hepatic stellate cell line LX-2 were cultured separately. HSC conditioned medium( LX2-CM),MAPK specific inhibitor U0126 were used to treat hepatoma cells,separately or together. The invasion and migration abilities of hepatoma cells were detected by TranswellTMassay,and cell proliferation was analyzed by CCK-8 assay. The mRNA and protein expression levels of p-ERK1 /2,ERK1 /2,c-Myc,vimentin and E-cadherin were determined by real-time PCR and Western blot analysis,respectively.
LX2-CM promoted the proliferation,invasion and migration of SMMC-7721 and Hep G2 cells,and these effects were inhibited by U0126. LX2-CM up-regulated the expression levels of p-ERK1 /2,c-Myc,vimentin and down-regulated the expression level of E-cadherin. Conversely,after U0126 treatment,the expression levels of p-ERK1 /2,c-Myc and vimentin decreased significantly,while E-cadherin expression level increased.
LX2-CM could activate c-Myc via ERK1 /2signaling pathway in hepatoma cells,and consequently promote cell proliferation,invasion and migration,and also induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition.
Traditionally, transplantation has been a major experimental procedure to study the development and function of hematopoietic and immune systems. Here, we describe the use of a zebrafish strain lacking definitive hematopoiesis (cmybI181N) for interspecific analysis of hematopoietic and immune cell development. Without conditioning prior to transplantation, allogeneic and xenogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cells stably engraft in adult zebrafish homozygous for the cmyb mutation. This unique animal model can be used to genetically and functionally disentangle universal and species-specific contributions of the microenvironment to hematopoietic progenitor cell maintenance and development.
c-Myb is a transcription factor that plays a key role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It has been reported that c-Myb is expressed within the chicken otic placode, but whether c-Myb exists in the mammalian cochlea, and how it exerts its effects, has not been explored yet. Here, we investigated the expression of c-Myb in the postnatal mouse cochlea and HEI-OC1 cells and found that c-Myb was expressed in the hair cells (HCs) of mouse cochlea as well as in cultured HEI-OC1 cells. Next, we demonstrated that c-Myb expression was decreased in response to neomycin treatment in both cochlear HCs and HEI-OC1 cells, suggesting an otoprotective role for c-Myb. We then knocked down c-Myb expression with shRNA transfection in HEI-OC1 cells and found that c-Myb knockdown decreased cell viability, increased expression of pro-apoptotic factors, and enhanced cell apoptosis after neomycin insult. Mechanistic studies revealed that c-Myb knockdown increased cellular levels of reactive oxygen species and decreased Bcl-2 expression, both of which are likely to be responsible for the increased sensitivity of c-Myb knockdown cells to neomycin. This study provides evidence that c-Myb might serve as a new target for the prevention of aminoglycoside-induced HC loss.
FoxP3-expressing regulatory T (Treg) cells are essential for maintaining immune homeostasis. Activated Treg cells undergo further differentiation into an effector state that highly expresses genes critical for Treg cell function, although how this process is coordinated on a transcriptional level is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that mice lacking the transcription factor Myb in Treg cells succumbed to a multi-organ inflammatory disease. Myb was specifically expressed in, and required for the differentiation of, thymus-derived effector Treg cells. The combination of transcriptome and genomic footprint analyses revealed that Myb directly regulated a large proportion of the gene expression specific to effector Treg cells, identifying Myb as a critical component of the gene regulatory network controlling effector Treg cell differentiation and function.
Elevated MYB expression has been documented in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), cylindroma, and spiradenoma, but the specificity of this finding is unknown. CD117 and SOX-10 expression also occurs in some cutaneous adnexal tumors. This study assesses MYB, CD117 and SOX-10 expression in cutaneous adnexal tumors.
Retrospective analysis of 184 benign adnexal tumors (140 eccrine/apocrine, 40 follicular and 10 sebaceous), and 30 malignant adnexal tumors was performed with MYB, SOX-10 and CD117 immunostaining.
In the benign adnexal tumors, 16% (23/140) significantly expressed MYB. MYB expression was limited to cylindromas and to a lesser extent, spiradenomas in the benign cohort. Elevated MYB expression was detected in mucinous carcinoma, endocrine mucin-producing sweat gland carcinoma and 1 and 4 cases of extramammary Paget's disease (EMPD) in the malignant cohort. CD117 and SOX-10 had similar overall positivity rates in benign apocrine and eccrine tumors (45% and 68% respectively), and were generally negative in other benign and malignant adnexal tumors.
Expression of MYB appears limited to a small number of cutaneous adnexal tumors, including cylindromas, spiradenomas, ACCs, mucinous carcinoma, endocrine mucin-producing sweat gland carcinoma and some cases of EMPD.
The transcription factor Myb is a key regulator of hematopoietic cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival and has been implicated in the development of leukemia and several other human cancers. Pharmacological inhibition of Myb is therefore emerging as a potential therapeutic strategy. Recently, the first low-molecular-weight compounds that show Myb inhibitory activity have been identified. Characterization of these compounds suggests disruption of the protein-protein-interaction of Myb and the coactivator p300 as a suitable strategy to inhibit Myb.
The transcription factor c-MYB is a well-known marker of undifferentiated cells such as haematopoietic cell precursors, but recently it has also been observed in differentiated cells that produce hard tissues. Our previous findings showed the presence of c-MYB in intramembranous bones and its involvement in the chondrogenic steps of endochondral ossification, where the up-regulation of early chondrogenic markers after c-myb overexpression was observed. Since we previously detected c-MYB in osteoblasts, we aimed to analyse the localisation of c-MYB during later stages of endochondral bone formation and address its function during bone matrix production. c-MYB-positive cells were found in the chondro-osseous junction zone in osteoblasts of trabecular bone as well as deeper in the zone of ossification in cells of spongy bone. To experimentally evaluate the osteogenic potential of c-MYB during endochondral bone formation, micromasses derived from embryonic mouse limb buds were established. Nuclear c-MYB protein expression was observed in long-term micromasses, especially in the areas around nodules. c-myb overexpression induced the expression of osteogenic-related genes such as Bmp2, Comp, Csf2 and Itgb1. Moreover, alizarin red staining and osteocalcin labelling promoted mineralised matrix production in c-myb-overexpressing cultures, whereas downregulation of c-myb by siRNA reduced mineralised matrix production. In conclusion, c-Myb plays a role in the osteogenesis of long bones by inducing osteogenic genes and causing the enhancement of mineral matrix production. This action of the transcription factor c-Myb might be of interest in the future for the establishment of novel approaches to tissue regeneration.
Adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC) is a malignant epithelial neoplasm that occurs rarely in the lower respiratory tract (LRT). AdCC at various sites is associated with the novel fusion transcript MYB-NFIB, along with the overexpression of the Myb protein. The expression of the Myb protein in AdCC of the LRT has not been evaluated much.
Cases of AdCC of the LRT diagnosed on cytology or histology were retrieved from our institutional archives. c-Myb expression was analyzed on immunocytochemistry/immunohistochemistry (ICC/IHC) and was correlated with clinicopathological parameters.
Twenty-three samples of AdCC originating from the LRT were included in the study. Four cases were diagnosed on cytology, 3 of which had corresponding histology specimens. The remaining 19 cases had either biopsy or resection. Most of the patients presented with endobronchial mass. The mean age was 49.4 years and a male predominance was seen. ICC and IHC for c-Myb showed positivity in 75 and 59% of the cases, respectively. Western blot was used to validate IHC results.
AdCC of the LRT is rare and hence poses diagnostic difficulty. Cytology smears can be utilized for c-Myb ICC. The presence of c-Myb immunopositivity in most cases may possibly make Myb a diagnostic biomarker and a therapeutic target for personalized treatment.
Glucocorticoid (GC) hormones are an important ingredient of leukemia therapy since they are potent inducers of lymphoid cell apoptosis. However, the development of GC resistance remains an obstacle in GC-based treatment. In the present investigation we found that miR-103 is upregulated in GC-sensitive leukemia cells treated by the hormone. Transfection of GC resistant cells with miR-103 sensitized them to GC induced apoptosis (GCIA), while miR-103 sponging of GC sensitive cells rendered them partially resistant. miR-103 reduced the expression of cyclin dependent kinase (CDK2) and its cyclin E1 target, thereby leading to inhibition of cellular proliferation. miR-103 is encoded within the fifth intron of PANK3 gene. We demonstrate that the GC receptor (GR) upregulates miR-103 by direct interaction with GC response element (GRE) in the PANK3 enhancer. Consequently, miR-103 targets the c-Myc activators c-Myb and DVL1, thereby reducing c-Myc expression. Since c-Myc is a transcription factor of the miR-17~92a poly-cistron, all six miRNAs of the latter are also downregulated. Of these, miR-18a and miR-20a are involved in GCIA, as they target GR and BIM, respectively. Consequently, GR and BIM expression are elevated, thus advancing GCIA. Altogether, this study highlights miR-103 as a useful prognostic biomarker and drug for leukemia management in the future.
Although circadian oscillators in diverse eukaryotes all depend on interlinked transcriptional feedback loops, specific components are not conserved across higher taxa. Moreover, the circadian network in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana is notably more complex than those found in animals and fungi. Here, we combine mathematical modeling and experimental approaches to investigate the functions of two classes of Myb-like transcription factors that antagonistically regulate common target genes. Both CCA1/LHY- and RVE8-clade factors bind directly to the same cis-element, but the former proteins act primarily as repressors, while the latter act primarily as activators of gene expression. We find that simulation of either type of loss-of-function mutant recapitulates clock phenotypes previously reported in mutant plants, while simulated simultaneous loss of both type of factors largely rescues circadian phase at the expense of rhythmic amplitude. In accord with this prediction, we find that plants mutant for both activator- and repressor-type Mybs have near-normal circadian phase and period but reduced rhythmic amplitude. Although these mutants exhibit robust rhythms when grown at mild temperatures, they are largely arrhythmic at physiologically relevant but nonoptimal temperatures. LHY- and RVE8-type Mybs are found in separate clades across the land plant lineage and even in some unicellular green algae, suggesting that they both may have functioned in even the earliest arising plant circadian oscillators. Our data suggest that the complexity of the plant circadian network may have arisen to provide rhythmic robustness across the range of environmental extremes to which plants, as sessile organisms, are regularly subjected.
Previous structural analyses have shown that R2R3, the minimum unit of the DNA-binding domain of the transcriptional factor c-Myb, is largely flexible in solution, and changes to a more rigid structure upon DNA binding. In this study, we evaluated the structural dynamics using the diffracted X-ray tracking method, in correlation with DNA-binding abilities under different salt conditions, and compared them with the previous results. The resultant curve of the mean square angular displacements (MSD) clearly showed that the flexibility of R2R3 was decreased upon DNA binding, and the DNA-binding energies determined using the angular diffusion coefficients were in good agreement with those determined using isothermal titration calorimetry. The results of the MSD curves also indicate that the translational length reduces by approximately half upon DNA binding.
The postmeiotic development of male germ cells, also known as spermiogenesis, features the coordinated expression of a large number of spermatid-specific genes. However, only a limited number of key transcription factors have been identified and the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we report that SOX30, the most-divergent member of the Sry-related high-motility group box (SOX) family of transcription factors, is essential for mouse spermiogenesis. The SOX30 protein was predominantly expressed in spermatids, while its transcription was regulated by retinoic acid and by MYBL1 before and during meiosis. Sox30 knockout mice arrested spermiogenesis at step 3 round spermatids, which underwent apoptosis and abnormal chromocenter formation. We also determined that SOX30 regulated the expression of hundreds of spermatid-specific protein-coding and long non-coding RNA genes. SOX30 bound to the proximal promoter of its own gene and activated its transcription. These results reveal SOX30 as a novel key regulator of spermiogenesis that regulates its own transcription to enforce and activate this meiotic regulatory pathway.
Genetic divergence between populations can lead to reproductive isolation. Hybrid incompatibilities (HI) represent intermediate points along a continuum toward speciation. In plants, genetic variation in disease resistance (R) genes underlies several cases of HI. The progeny of a cross between Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) accessions Landsberg erecta (Ler, Poland) and Kashmir2 (Kas2, central Asia) exhibits immune-related HI. This incompatibility is due to a genetic interaction between a cluster of eight TNL (TOLL/INTERLEUKIN1 RECEPTOR-NUCLEOTIDE BINDING-LEU RICH REPEAT) RPP1 (RECOGNITION OF PERONOSPORA PARASITICA1)-like genes (R1-R8) from Ler and central Asian alleles of a Strubbelig-family receptor-like kinase (SRF3) from Kas2. In characterizing mutants altered in Ler/Kas2 HI, we mapped multiple mutations to the RPP1-like Ler locus. Analysis of these suppressor of Ler/Kas2 incompatibility (sulki) mutants reveals complex, additive and epistatic interactions underlying RPP1-like Ler locus activity. The effects of these mutations were measured on basal defense, global gene expression, primary metabolism, and disease resistance to a local Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis isolate (Hpa Gw) collected from Gorzów (Gw), where the Landsberg accession originated. Gene expression sectors and metabolic hallmarks identified for HI are both dependent and independent of RPP1-like Ler members. We establish that mutations suppressing immune-related Ler/Kas2 HI do not compromise resistance to Hpa Gw. QTL mapping analysis of Hpa Gw resistance point to RPP7 as the causal locus. This work provides insight into the complex genetic architecture of the RPP1-like Ler locus and immune-related HI in Arabidopsis and into the contributions of RPP1-like genes to HI and defense.
In-Stent Restenosis (ISR) is the major reason for recurrent ischemia and amputation after endovascular treatment of Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD). Our previous study demonstrated that miR-140-3p is significantly down-regulated in PAD arteries. However, expression and function of miR-140-3p in ISR of human PAD are currently unclear.The aim of this study is to determine the miR-140-3p expression and its regulative role in ISR of PAD.
The RNA level was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) and in situ hybridization. Primary cultured ASMCs were isolated from human femoral arterial of the healthy donors or ISR patients. Cell proliferation was determined by Edu incorporation and CCK-8 assay. Apoptosis was determined by Annexin-Ⅴ/PI Double-Staining assay and TUNEL assay. A rat carotid artery balloon angioplasty model was used to investigate the effect of miR-140-3p on restenosis.
MiR-140-3p was significantly down-regulated in PAD and ISR arteries than normal arteries. Primary cultured ISR ASMCs exhibited elevated proliferation and down-regulated miR-140-3p than normal ASMCs. Transfection of miR-140-3p mimic attenuated PDGF-BB-induced proliferation in cultured ASMCs and induced apoptosis. Luciferase reporter assay indicated that miR-140-3p transfection significantly down-regulated C-Myb and BCL-2 in ISR ASMCs by targeting to their 3'-UTRs. MiR-140-3p transfection induced anti-proliferation and apoptosis in ASMCs, which were ameliorated by over-expression of C-Myb or BCL-2. Moreover, the animal study showed that miR-140-3p can reduce restenosis following angioplasty via targeting C-Myb and BCL-2.
The result suggests that miR-140-3p regulates ASMC function via targeting C-Myb and BCL-2 in the process of ISR in PAD. The novel findings may offer a hopeful therapeutic target for human PAD.
MYB is a transcription factor which was identified in birds as a viral oncogene (v-MYB). Its cellular counterpart was subsequently isolated as c-MYB which has three functional domains - DNA binding domain, transactivation domain and negative regulatory domain. c-MYB is essential for survival, and deletion of both alleles of the gene results in embryonic death. It is highly expressed in hematopoietic cells, thymus and neural tissue, and required for T and B lymphocyte development and erythroid maturation. Additionally, aberrant MYB expression has been found in numerous solid cancer cells and human leukemia. Recent studies have also implicated c-MYB in the regulation of expression of fetal hemoglobin which is highly beneficial to the β-hemoglobinopathies (beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease). These findings suggest that MYB could be a potential therapeutic target in leukemia, and possibly also a target for therapeutic increase of fetal hemoglobin in the β-hemoglobinopathies.
miR-150 has been demonstrated to inhibit tumor progression in various human cancers, including colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, and thyroid cancer. However, the role of miR-150 in melanoma remains to be determined. In this study, we found that miR-150 was underexpressed in melanoma tissues and cell lines. Through transfection of miR-150 mimics, we found that miR-150 significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of melanoma cells. In mechanism, we found that MYB was a target of miR-150 in melanoma cells. Overexpression of miR-150 significantly inhibited mRNA and protein levels of MYB in melanoma cells. Moreover, there was an inverse correlation between the expression of miR-150 and MYB in melanoma tissues. We also showed that MYB was upregulated in melanoma tissues and cell lines. Through functional experiments, we found that restoration of MYB in miR-150-overexpressed melanoma cells rescued the proliferation, migration, and invasion. Therefore, our findings demonstrated that miR-150 suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of melanoma cell by downregulating MYB.
We analyzed the genetic mutation status of 13 patients with therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN). Consistent with previous reports, t-MN cells preferentially acquired mutations in TP53 and epigenetic modifying genes, instead of mutations in tyrosine kinase and spliceosome genes. Furthermore, we compared the mutation status of three t-MN cells with each of the initial lymphoid malignant cells, and identified common mutations among t-MN and the initial malignant cells in two patients. In a patient who developed chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) after follicular lymphoma (FL), TET2 mutation was identified in both CMML and FL cells. Notably, the TET2 mutation was also identified in peripheral blood cells in the disease-free period with the same allelic frequency as CMML and FL cells, but not in a germ-line control, indicating that the TET2 mutation occurred somatically in the initiating clone for both malignant cells. On the other hand, a germ-line MYB mutation was identified in a patient who developed myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) after FL. These results suggest that germ-line deposition and clonal hematopoiesis are closely associated with t-MN susceptibility; however, further analysis is necessary to clarify the mechanism required to provide the initiating clone with lineage commitment and clonal expansion.
The c-Myb transcription factor is required for adult hematopoiesis, yet little is known about c-Myb function during lineage-specific differentiation due to the embryonic lethality of Myb-null mutations. We previously used tissue-specific inactivation of the murine Myb locus to demonstrate that c-Myb is required for differentiation to the pro-B cell stage, survival during the pro-B cell stage, and the pro-B to pre-B cell transition during B lymphopoiesis. However, few downstream mediators of c-Myb-regulated function have been identified. We demonstrate that c-Myb regulates the intrinsic survival of CD19+ pro-B cells in the absence of IL-7 by repressing expression of the proapoptotic proteins Bmf and Bim and that levels of Bmf and Bim mRNA are further repressed by IL-7 signaling in pro-B cells. c-Myb regulates two crucial components of the IL-7 signaling pathway: the IL-7Rα-chain and the negative regulator SOCS3 in CD19+ pro-B cells. Bypassing IL-7R signaling through constitutive activation of Stat5b largely rescues survival of c-Myb-deficient pro-B cells, whereas constitutively active Akt is much less effective. However, rescue of pro-B cell survival is not sufficient to rescue proliferation of pro-B cells or the pro-B to small pre-B cell transition, and we further demonstrate that c-Myb-deficient large pre-B cells are hypoproliferative. Analysis of genes crucial for the pre-BCR checkpoint demonstrates that, in addition to IL-7Rα, the genes encoding λ5, cyclin D3, and CXCR4 are downregulated in the absence of c-Myb, and λ5 is a direct c-Myb target. Thus, c-Myb coordinates survival with the expression of genes that are required during the pre-BCR checkpoint.
Trichome formation in Arabidopsis is regulated by a MBW complex formed by MYB, bHLH and WD40 transcriptional factors, which can activate GLABRA2 (GL2) and the R3 MYB transcription factor genes. GL2 promotes trichome formation, whereas R3 MYBs are able to block the formation of the MBW complex. It has been reported that the C2H2 transcription factor GIS (GLABROUS INFLORESCENCE STEMS) functions upstream of the MBW activator complex to regulate trichome formation, and that the expression of TCL1 is not regulated by the MBW complex. However, gis and the R3 MYB gene mutant tcl1 (trichomeless 1) have opposite inflorescence trichome phenotypes, but their relationship in regulating trichome formation remained unknown.
By generating and characterization of the gis tcl1 double mutant, we found that trichome formation in the gis tcl1double and the tcl1 single mutants were largely indistinguishable, but the trichome formation in the 35S:TCL1/gis transgenic plant was similar to that in the gis mutant. By using quantitative RT-PCR analysis, we showed that expression level of GIS was increased in the triple mutant tcl1 try cpc, but the expression level of TCL1 was not affected in the gis mutant. On the other hand, trichome morphology in both gis tcl1 and 35S:TCL1/gis plants was similar to that in the gis mutant.
In summary, our results indicate that GIS may work downstream of TCL1 to regulate trichome formation, and GIS has a dominant role in controlling trichome morphology.
During Drosophila spermatogenesis, testis-specific meiotic arrest complex (tMAC) and testis-specific TBP-associated factors (tTAF) contribute to activation of hundreds of genes required for meiosis and spermiogenesis. Intriguingly, tMAC is paralogous to the broadly expressed complex Myb-MuvB (MMB)/dREAM and Mip40 protein is shared by both complexes. tMAC acts as a gene activator in spermatocytes, while MMB/dREAM was shown to repress gene activity in many cell types.
Our study addresses the intricate interplay between tMAC, tTAF, and MMB/dREAM during spermatogenesis. We used cell type-specific DamID to build the DNA-binding profiles of Cookie monster (tMAC), Cannonball (tTAF), and Mip40 (MMB/dREAM and tMAC) proteins in male germline cells. Incorporating the whole transcriptome analysis, we characterized the regulatory effects of these proteins and identified their gene targets. This analysis revealed that tTAFs complex is involved in activation of achi, vis, and topi meiosis arrest genes, implying that tTAFs may indirectly contribute to the regulation of Achi, Vis, and Topi targets. To understand the relationship between tMAC and MMB/dREAM, we performed Mip40 DamID in tTAF- and tMAC-deficient mutants demonstrating meiosis arrest phenotype. DamID profiles of Mip40 were highly dynamic across the stages of spermatogenesis and demonstrated a strong dependence on tMAC in spermatocytes. Integrative analysis of our data indicated that MMB/dREAM represses genes that are not expressed in spermatogenesis, whereas tMAC recruits Mip40 for subsequent gene activation in spermatocytes.
Discovered interdependencies allow to formulate a renewed model for tMAC and tTAFs action in Drosophila spermatogenesis demonstrating how tissue-specific genes are regulated.
Myeloblastosis (MYB) transcription factors play central roles in plant developmental processes and in responses to nutrient deficiency. In this study, OsMYB5P, an R2R3-MYB transcription factor, was isolated and identified from rice (Oryza sativa L. 'Dongjin') under inorganic phosphate (Pi)-deficient conditions. OsMYB5P protein is localized to the nucleus and functions as a transcription activator in plant development. Overexpression of OsMYB5P in rice and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0) increases tolerance to phosphate starvation, whereas OsMYB5P knock-out through RNA interference increases sensitivity to Pi depletion in rice. Furthermore, shoots and roots of transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsMYB5P were longer than those of wild plants under both normal and Pi-deficient conditions. These results indicate that OsMYB5P is associated with the regulation of shoot development and root- system architecture. Overexpression of OsMYB5P led to increased Pi accumulation in shoots and roots. Interestingly, OsMYB5P directly bound to MBS (MYB binding site) motifs on the OsPT5 promoter and induced transcription of OsPT5 in rice. In addition, overexpression of OsMYB5P in Arabidopsis triggered increased expression of AtPht1;3, an Arabidopsis Pi transporter, in shoots and roots under normal and Pi-deficient conditions. Together, these results demonstrate that overexpression of OsMYB5P increases tolerance to Pi deficiency in plants by modulating Pi transporters at the transcriptional level in monocots and dicots.
The objective of the study was to study the regulation of B lymphocytes in patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA)/Evans syndrome. From October 2015 to May 2016, 35 patients with AIHA/Evans in the Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital were enrolled into this study. c-Myb mRNA and miR-150 expression in B lymphocytes were measured using real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Correlation between c-Myb and miR-150 and clinical parameters in patients with AIHA/Evans were analyzed. c-Myb mRNA expression in hemolysis patients was significantly higher than in remission patients and CLL patients, negatively correlated with hemoglobin (Hb) level and complement 3(C3) levels, and positively correlated with total bilirubin (TBIL) concentration and indirect bilirubin (IBIL) concentration. miR-150 expression in hemolysis patients was significantly lower than in patients in remission and CLL patients. miR-150 was negatively correlated with TBIL and IBIL, and positively correlated with Hb, C3. c-Myb mRNA expression levels in hemolytic episode patients were negatively correlated with the expression levels of miR-150. The expression of c-Myb, a regulatory factor of B lymphocytes, is increased in B lymphocytes of AIHA/Evans patients, while miR-150 expression is decreased. c-Myb was negatively correlated with miR-150.
Objectives Burkitt lymphoma is one of the most common types of haematopoietic malignancy in children and adolescents. Mda-7/IL-24 had been identified as a differentiation inducer of Burkitt lymphoma cells. Previous studies have revealed that knockdown of C-myb can also lead to the terminal differentiation of Burkitt lymphoma cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate the correlation between the expression of Mda-7/IL-24 and C-myb, as well as their prognostic significance, for Burkitt lymphoma patients. Methods The tumour tissues were collected from 59 cases of Burkitt lymphoma patients and detected with Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Results The results showed that the expression of Mda-7/IL-24 was lower, whereas the expression of C-myb was higher in Burkitt lymphoma tissues compared to specimens of normal lymph node tissues. Furthermore, C-myb expression was negatively correlated with Mda-7/IL-24 expression at the protein level in Burkitt lymphoma tissues and cell lines. Both the expression of Mda-7/IL-24 and C-myb in Burkitt lymphoma tissues was associated with some clinicopathological parameters, such as clinical stage, infiltration in the bone marrow, Ki67 and overall survival rates. Conclusion These results indicated that low expression of Mda-7/IL-24 along with high expression of C-myb are predictors for poor prognosis of Burkitt lymphoma patients; this outcome suggests that Mda-7/IL-24 and C-myb might be potential targets for clinical treatment of Burkitt lymphoma.

Myb is a key regulator of hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation and has emerged as a potential target for the treatment of acute leukemia. Using a myeloid cell line with a stably integrated Myb-inducible reporter gene as a screening tool we have previously identified Celastrol, a natural compound with anti-tumor activity, as a potent Myb inhibitor that disrupts the interaction of Myb with the co-activator p300. We showed that Celastrol inhibits the proliferation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and prolongs the survival of mice in an in vivo model of AML, demonstrating that targeting Myb with a small-molecule inhibitor is feasible and might have potential as a therapeutic approach against AML. Recently we became aware that the reporter system used for Myb inhibitor screening also responds to inhibition of C/EBPβ, a transcription factor known to cooperate with Myb in myeloid cells. By re-investigating the inhibitory potential of Celastrol we have found that Celastrol also strongly inhibits the activity of C/EBPβ by disrupting its interaction with the Taz2 domain of p300. Together with previous studies our work reveals that Celastrol independently targets Myb and C/EBPβ by disrupting the interaction of both transcription factors with p300. Myb, C/EBPβ and p300 cooperate in myeloid-specific gene expression and, as shown recently, are associated with so-called super-enhancers in AML cells that have been implicated in the maintenance of the leukemia. We hypothesize that the ability of Celastrol to disrupt the activity of a transcriptional Myb-C/EBPβ-p300 module might explain its promising anti-leukemic activity.
An R3-type MYB transcription factor, CAPRICE (CPC), is known to promote root hair cell differentiation in Arabidopsis root epidermis. The CPC protein moves from non-hair cells to the neighboring cells, and acts as an inducer of root hair formation. In contrast, we previously showed that the CPC homolog, ENHANCER OF TRY AND CPC1 (ETC1), does not move between the root epidermal cells. To clarify the critical difference in the cell-to-cell movement ability of CPC and ETC1 proteins, we generated five different chimeras of CPC and ETC1. As expected, four of the five chimeric proteins with substitution of CPC amino acids with those of ETC1 induced many root hair and no-trichome phenotype, like CPC. These chimeric proteins essentially maintained the cell-to-cell movement ability of CPC. However, one chimeric protein in which ETC1 was sandwiched between the CPC-specific movement motifs of S1 and S2 did not induce ectopic root hair formation. This chimeric protein did not move between the cells. These results indicate that the maintenance of not only the S1 and S2 motifs but also the precise structure of CPC protein might be necessary for the cell-to-cell movement of CPC. Our results should help in further unraveling of the roles of these MYB transcription factors in root hair formation.
Aberrant gene expression is a hallmark of acute leukemias. MYB-driven transcriptional coactivation with CREB-binding protein (CBP)/P300 is required for acute lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemias, including refractory MLL-rearranged leukemias. Using structure-guided molecular design, we developed a peptidomimetic inhibitor MYBMIM that interferes with the assembly of the molecular MYB:CBP/P300 complex and rapidly accumulates in the nuclei of AML cells. Treatment of AML cells with MYBMIM led to the dissociation of the MYB:CBP/P300 complex in cells, its displacement from oncogenic enhancers enriched for MYB binding sites, and downregulation of MYB-dependent gene expression, including of MYC and BCL2 oncogenes. AML cells underwent mitochondrial apoptosis in response to MYBMIM, which was partially rescued by ectopic expression of BCL2. MYBMIM impeded leukemia growth and extended survival of immunodeficient mice engrafted with primary patient-derived MLL-rearranged leukemia cells. These findings elucidate the dependence of human AML on aberrant transcriptional coactivation, and establish a pharmacologic approach for its therapeutic blockade.
Patients with gastric cancer commonly have a poor prognosis, owing to its invasiveness and distant metastasis. Recent studies have confirmed the pivotal role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in tumorigenesis and the progression of malignant tumors, including gastric cancer. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism by which lncRNA AK023391 contributes to gastric cancer.
A lncRNA microarray was used to identify the differentially expressed lncRNA AK023391 in gastric cancer and adjacent normal tissues. In addition, RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to investigate the association between AK023391 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of patients with gastric cancer. Subsequently, a series of in vitro assays and a xenograft tumor model were used to observe the functions of lncRNA AK023391 in gastric cancer cells. A cancer pathway microarray, bioinformatic analysis, western blotting, and immunochemistry were carried out to verify the regulation of AK023391 and its downstream PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
Expression of lncRNA AK023391 was significantly upregulated in gastric cancer samples and cell lines in comparison to adjacent normal tissues, and was positively correlated with poor survival in patients with gastric cancer. The multivariate Cox regression model revealed that AK023391 expression acted as an independent prognostic factor for survival in patients with gastric cancer. Knockdown of AK023391 inhibited cell growth and invasion both in vitro and in vivo, and induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in gastric cancer cells, whereas its overexpression reversed these effects. Mechanistically, PI3K/Akt signaling mediated the NF-κB, FOXO3a, and p53 pathways. Moreover, downstream transcription factors, such as c-myb, cyclinB1/G2, and BCL-6 might be involved in AK023391-induced tumorigenesis in gastric cancer.
The novel oncogenic lncRNA AK023391 in gastric cancer exerts its effects through activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, and may act as a potential biomarker for survival in patients with gastric cancer.
Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is one of the common malignant tumors in salivary glands, and the clinical prognosis is poor with frequent distant metastasis which may lead to death. Expression of the MYB-NFIB chimeric gene in ACC has been reported recently. MYB is an oncogene with transcription regulating functions, and NFIB encodes nuclear transcription factor although detailed functions are unknown. This study investigated whether MYB-NFIB chimeric gene expression affects tumor angiogenesis and proliferation in salivary gland ACC. In 26 salivary gland ACC cases, MYB-NFIB chimeric gene expression was analyzed by RT-PCR and direct sequencing. Immunohistochemical studies for CD31, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Ki-67 were performed. Tumor angiogenesis was evaluated by blood vessel (CD31-positive) density and tumor proliferation by Ki-67 labeling index, and the relationship with MYB-NFIB chimeric gene expression was analyzed. MYB-NFIB chimeric gene expression was detected in nine of 26 ACC cases. Blood vessel density was significantly higher in chimeric gene-expressing cases compared to non-expressing cases. VEGF score tended to be higher in chimeric gene-expressing cases than in non-expressing cases, while Ki-67 labeling index was not significantly different. The number of chimeric gene-expressing cases increased with age, peaking in the sixties age group and declining thereafter, while the number of non-expressing cases increased with age continuously. In ACC, blood vessel density was significantly higher in MYB-NFIB chimeric gene-expressing cases compared to non-expressing cases, which may be due to higher VEGF production capability. MYB-NFIB chimeric gene expression may also be related to the onset age of ACC.
Protein c-Myb is a therapeutic target. Some sesquiterpene lactones suppress Myb-dependent gene expression, which results in their potential anti-cancer activity.
Database ChEMBL is a representative of lactones for physicochemical and physiochemical properties. Data presented for 31 natural lactones are discussed in terms of quantitative structureactivity relationships with the objective to predict inhibitors of Myb-induced gene expression. Several constitutional descriptors are related to structure-activity. α-Methylene-γ-lactone groups enhance while OH functions worsen potency. The latter feature is in agreement with the fact that the more lipophilic the lactone, the greater the cytotoxicity because of the ability to cross lipoidal biomembranes. In general, numbers of &amp;#960;-systems and atoms, and polarizability enhance activity. Linear and nonlinear structure-activity models are developed, between lactones of a great structural diversity, to predict inhibitors of Myb-induced gene expression. Four variables (ML, UNC, TCO+OCOR, UNC+UNA) related to ATOM show a positive correlation because of the partial anionic and H-acceptor characters of O-atom. In most, CO group is conjugated.
Term OH shows negative coefficients because of the partial cationic quality of H-atom and because OH forms H-bonds with CO, causing them to be less H-acceptor. s-trans-s-trans-Germacranolide structure is the most active. Coefficients standard errors result acceptable in almost all equations. After cross-validation, linear equations for lactones, pseudoguaianolides and germacranolides are the most predictive. Most descriptors are constitutional variables.
The enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) is key in the synthesis of leukotrienes, which are potent proinflammatory lipid mediators involved in chronic inflammatory diseases including cancer. 5-LO is expressed in immune cells but also found in cancer cells. Although the role of 5-LO in tumor cells is beginning to emerge, with the notion that tumor-promoting functions are attributed to its products, the function of 5-LO in the tumor microenvironment remains unclear. To understand the role of 5-LO and its products in the tumor microenvironment, we analyzed its expression and function in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). TAMs were generated by coculturing primary human macrophages (MΦ) with human MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells, which caused cell death of cancer cells followed by phagocytosis of cell debris by MΦ. Expression and activity of 5-LO in TAMs were reduced upon coculture with cancer cells. Downregulation of 5-LO in TAMs required tumor cell death and the direct contact between MΦ and dying cancer cells via Mer tyrosine kinase. Subsequently, upregulation of proto-oncogene c-Myb in TAMs induced a stable transcriptional repression of 5-LO. Reduced 5-LO expression in TAMs was mechanistically coupled to an attenuated T cell recruitment. In primary TAMs from human and murine breast tumors, 5-LO expression was absent or low when compared with monocyte-derived MΦ. Our data reveal that 5-LO, which is required for leukotriene production and subsequent T cell recruitment, is downregulated in TAMs through Mer tyrosine kinase-dependent recognition of apoptotic cancer cells. Mechanistically, we noticed transcriptional repression of 5-LO by proto-oncogene c-Myb and conclude that loss of stromal 5-LO expression favors tumor progression.
Ferroptosis is a recently discovered form of iron-dependent nonapoptotic cell death. It is characterized by loss of the activity of the lipid repair enzyme, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and accumulation of lethal reactive lipid oxygen species. However, we still know relatively little about ferroptosis and its molecular mechanism in gastric cancer (GC) cells. Here, we demonstrate that erastin, a classic inducer of ferroptosis, induces this form of cell death in GC cells and that cysteine dioxygenase 1 (CDO1) plays an important role in this process.
We performed quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, cell viability assay, reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay, glutathione assay, lipid peroxidation assay, RNAi and gene transfection, immunofluorescent staining, dual-luciferase reporter assay, transmission electron microscopy, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to study the regulation of ferroptosis in GC cells. Mouse xenograft assay was used to figure out the mechanism in vivo.
Silencing CDO1 inhibited erastin-induced ferroptosis in GC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Suppression of CDO1 restored cellular GSH levels, prevented ROS generation, and reduced malondialdehyde, one of the end products of lipid peroxidation. In addition, silencing COO1 maintained mitochondrial morphologic stability in erastin-treated cells. Mechanistically, c-Myb transcriptionally regulated CDO1, and inhibition of CDO1 expression upregulated GPX4 expression.
Our findings give a better understanding of ferroptosis and its molecular mechanism in GC cells, gaining insight into ferroptosis-mediated cancer treatment.
There have been numerous reports about neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Nevertheless, the molecules responsible for the neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease are basically unknown. Recent findings indicate that the cellular myeloblastosis (c-myb) regulates neural progenitor cell proliferation. In the current study, the function of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) against cell toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells induced by β-amyloid 25-35 (Aβ25-35) and its molecular mechanism were investigated. It was found that p25 protein production was raised by Aβ25-35 (25 μM), similar to the increased expression of μ-calpain. The results also showed that Aβ25-35 reduced c-myb, elevated tau hyper-phosphorylation, and induced death of SH-SY5Y cells. Loss of cell viability and apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells induced by Aβ25-35 were attenuated by IGF-1 pretreatment in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, IGF-1 blocked μ-calpain expression, which was induced by Aβ25-35 and reduced p25 formation and tau hyper-phosphorylation. Moreover, the expression of c-myb in SH-SY5Y cells was increased by combining IGF-1 with Aβ25-35 or IGF-1 alone. The neuroprotective function of IGF-1 was attenuated in the SH-SY5Y cells, which were transfected with a c-myb small interfering RNA. Furthermore, LY294002, a specific PI3K inhibitor, reduced c-myb expression and abolished IGF-1's protective function in SH-SY5Y cell apoptosis induced by Aβ25-35. The facts above indicate that c-myb has a role in IGF-1-mediated protection from Aβ25-35-induced cytotoxicity via the PI3K/Akt pathway.
Brooke-Spiegler syndrome (BSS; a.k.a. tuban tumor syndrome) is an autosomal dominant inherited skin disorder caused by germline mutations in the CYLD tumor suppressor gene. BSS is characterized by multiple skin adnexal tumors, mainly cylindromas and spiradenomas on the head and neck. The tumors are often severely disfiguring and require repeated surgical interventions. Here, we describe a four-generation BSS-family with a novel germline c.1613_1614delGC CYLD mutation that introduces a premature STOP codon predicted to result in a truncated, inactivated CYLD protein. In addition, we present a pilot study describing establishment of the first patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) from cutaneous CYLD-defective cylindromas. Fresh tumor tissues from cylindromas were transplanted into immunocompromised mice to generate PDXs. One xenograft showed progressive tumor growth after 3 months whereas the others remained unchanged in size during the 6 months study period. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses of the PDXs revealed that they recapitulate the histological and molecular features of their respective primary tumors, including expression of NTRK3 and the oncogenic driver MYB. In summary, we present the first preclinical BSS-model that morphologically and genetically recapitulates human CYLD-defective cylindromas. This model will be useful for preclinical therapeutic drug testing and for further studies of the molecular pathogenesis of inherited cylindromas.
In most species, size homeostasis appears to be exerted in late G1 phase as cells commit to division, called Start in yeast and the Restriction Point in metazoans. This size threshold couples cell growth to division, and, thereby, establishes long-term size homeostasis. Our former investigations have shown that hundreds of genes markedly altered cell size under homeostatic growth conditions in the opportunistic yeast Candida albicans, but surprisingly only few of these overlapped with size control genes in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Here, we investigated one of the divergent potent size regulators in C. albicans, the Myb-like HTH transcription factor Dot6. Our data demonstrated that Dot6 is a negative regulator of Start, and also acts as a transcriptional activator of ribosome biogenesis (Ribi) genes. Genetic epistasis uncovered that Dot6 interacted with the master transcriptional regulator of the G1 machinery, SBF complex, but not with the Ribi and cell size regulators Sch9, Sfp1, and p38/Hog1. Dot6 was required for carbon-source modulation of cell size, and it is regulated at the level of nuclear localization by the TOR pathway. Our findings support a model where Dot6 acts as a hub that integrates growth cues directly via the TOR pathway to control the commitment to mitotic division at G1.
Sirtuin 4 (SIRT4) belongs to the mitochondrial sirtuin protein family, a class of NAD+-dependent protein deacylases that remove post-translational acyl modifications from cellular substrates during the regulation of various biological pathways. SIRT4 has been shown to regulate lipid homeostasis. However, the mechanism by which the bovine SIRT4 gene is transcriptionally regulated remains unknown. To explore the molecular mechanism of SIRT4 expression, we obtained a 400-kb fragment of the 5'-regulatory region of bovine SIRT4 by molecular cloning, which contained a CpG island. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and luciferase reporter gene assays identified the nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) and myb proto-oncogene protein (CMYB) binding sites as transcriptional repression and activation sites in the SIRT4 promoter region, respectively. We further verified that NRF1 and CMYB bind to the SIRT4 promoter using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. In addition, from DNA methylation and reporter gene assays, results revealed that SIRT4 promoter activity was enhanced by demethylation. Further, NRF1-mediated transcriptional inhibition and CMYB-mediated transcriptional activation of SIRT4 expression were strengthened by demethylation during bovine adipocyte differentiation. Taken together, our results shed light on the mechanism underlying the promoter methylation and transcriptional regulation of SIRT4 expression in bovine adipocytes.
Lignin is one of the most important components of the plant cell wall, and the expression and transcriptional regulation of lignin biosynthesis-related genes have been studied widely in Arabidopsis and other plants. Citrus fruit juice sacs often undergo lignification, particularly during fruit ripening and storage periods; however, the underlying genetic mechanisms have been little investigated. In this study, we isolated and identified CsMYB330 and CsMYB308 transcription factors, and found that their expression levels are significantly altered during the lignification of citrus fruit juice sacs. We found that CsMYB330 and CsMYB308 can recognize and bind AC elements in the Cs4CL1 promoter and finely regulate expression of the Cs4CL1 gene. In this regulatory process, CsMYB330 was identified as a transcriptional activator, whereas CsMYB308 appears to be a transcriptional repressor. In addition, using a transient assay, we demonstrated that expression of the Cs4CL1 gene is significantly altered in fruit juice sacs overexpressing these two transcription factors. These results indicate that the transcription factors CsMYB330 and CsMYB308 play important roles in the lignification of citrus fruit juice sacs and provide novel insights into the transcriptional regulation associated with fruit juice sac lignification.
Melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer, is characterized by high rates of metastasis, drug resistance and mortality. Here we investigated the role of Semaphorin 5A (Sema5A) on the properties associated with melanoma progression and the factors involved in Sema5A regulation.
Western blotting, qRT-PCR, Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, immunohistochemistry of melanoma patient specimens and xenograft tissues, in vitro Transwell assay for cell migration and invasion evaluation, in vitro capillary-like structure formation analysis.
A significant correlation of Sema5A mRNA expression and melanoma progression was observed by analyzing GEO profile dataset. Endogenous Sema5A protein was detected in 95% of human melanoma cell lines tested, in 70% of metastatic specimens from patients affected by melanoma, and 16% of in situ melanoma specimens showed a focal positivity. We demonstrated that Sema5A regulates in vitro cell migration and invasion and the formation of vasculogenic structures. We also found an increase of Sema5A at both mRNA and protein level after forced expression of Bcl-2. By use of transcriptional and proteasome inhibitors, we showed that Bcl-2 increases the stability of Sema5A mRNA and protein. Moreover, by ChIP we demonstrated that Sema5A expression is under the control of the transcription factor c-Myb and that c-Myb recruitment on Sema5A promoter is increased after Bcl-2 overexpression. Finally, a concomitant decrease in the expression of Sema5A, Bcl-2 and c-Myb proteins was observed in melanoma cells after miR-204 overexpression.
Overall our data provide evidences supporting the role of Sema5A in melanoma progression and the involvement of Bcl-2, miR-204 and c-Myb in regulating its expression.
In vascular plants, R2R3-MYB transcription factors are important regulators of secondary cell wall formation. Although 192 annotated R2R3 MYB genes were identified in the poplar genome, only a few members were characterized to participate in the regulation of the secondary cell wall biosynthesis. In this paper, we identify an R2R3-MYB transcription factor, PtoMYB74, which is predicted to be an ortholog of Arabidopsis AtMYB61, a transcription activator that regulates the secondary cell wall formation, lignin biosynthesis, stomatal aperture, and the mucilage of seed coat. PtoMYB74 is mainly expressed in the stems, especially in the xylem tissues and organs. PtoMYB74 as a transcriptional activator is localized to the nucleus. The overexpression of PtoMYB74 increased the secondary cell wall thickness of vessels in transgenic poplar and changed the secondary cell wall compositions. The expression levels of lignin and cellulose biosynthetic genes were elevated in the transgenic poplar overexpressing PtoMYB74 compared to the wild type, while there was no change in the xylan biosynthetic genes. Transcriptional activation assays demonstrated that PtoMYB74 could activate the promoters of structural genes in the lignin and cellulose biosynthetic pathways. Taken together, our data show that PtoMYB74 positively regulates the secondary cell wall biosynthesis in poplar.
Starch degradation is a necessary process determining banana fruit quality during ripening. Many starch degradation-related genes are well studied. However, the transcriptional regulation of starch degradation during banana fruit ripening remains poorly understood. In this study, we identified a MYB transcription factor (TF) termed MaMYB3, as a putative protein binding the promoter of MaGWD1, a member of glucan water dikinase (GWD) family which has been demonstrated as an important enzyme of starch degradation. MaMYB3 was ripening- and ethylene-repressible, and its expression was negatively correlated with starch degradation. Acting as a nucleus-localized transcriptional repressor, MaMYB3 repressed the transcription of 10 starch degradation-related genes, including MaGWD1, MaSEX4, MaBAM7-MaBAM8, MaAMY2B, MaAMY3, MaAMY3A, MaAMY3C, MaMEX1, and MapGlcT2-1, by directly binding to their promoters. Interestingly, a previously identified activator of starch degradation-related genes, MabHLH6, was also suppressed by MaMYB3. The ectopic overexpression of MaMYB3 in tomato down-regulated the expression of starch degradation-related genes, inhibited starch degradation and delayed fruit ripening. Based on these findings, we conclude that MaMYB3 negatively impacts starch degradation by directly repressing starch degradation-related genes and MabHLH6, and thereby delays banana fruit ripening. Collectively, our study expands our understanding of the complex transcriptional regulatory hierarchy modulating starch degradation during fruit ripening.
The human T cell leukemia virus I basic leucine zipper protein (HTLV-1 HBZ) maintains chronic viral infection and promotes leukemogenesis through poorly understood mechanisms involving interactions with the KIX domain of the transcriptional coactivator CBP and its paralog p300. The KIX domain binds regulatory proteins at the distinct MLL and c-Myb/pKID sites to form binary or ternary complexes. The intrinsically disordered N-terminal activation domain of HBZ (HBZ AD) deregulates cellular signaling pathways by competing directly with cellular and viral transcription factors for binding to the MLL site and by allosterically perturbing binding of the transactivation domain of the hematopoietic transcription factor c-Myb. Crystal structures of the ternary KIX:c-Myb:HBZ complex show that the HBZ AD recruits two KIX:c-Myb entities through tandem amphipathic motifs (L/V)(V/L)DGLL and folds into a long α-helix upon binding. Isothermal titration calorimetry reveals strong cooperativity in binding of the c-Myb activation domain to the KIX:HBZ complex and in binding of HBZ to the KIX:c-Myb complex. In addition, binding of KIX to the two HBZ (V/L)DGLL motifs is cooperative; the structures suggest that this cooperativity is achieved through propagation of the HBZ α-helix beyond the first binding motif. Our study suggests that the unique structural flexibility and the multiple interaction motifs of the intrinsically disordered HBZ AD are responsible for its potency in hijacking KIX-mediated transcription pathways. The KIX:c-Myb:HBZ complex provides an example of cooperative stabilization in a transcription factor:coactivator network and gives insights into potential mechanisms through which HBZ dysregulates hematopoietic transcriptional programs and promotes T cell proliferation.
Abiotic stress causes various negative impacts on plants, such as water loss, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and decreased photosynthesis. R2R3-MYB transcription factors (TFs) play crucial roles in the response of plants to abiotic stress. However, their functions in Tartary buckwheat, a strongly abiotic and resistant coarse cereal, haven't been fully investigated. In this paper, we report that a R2R3-MYB from Tartary buckwheat, FtMYB13, is not an activator of transcriptional activity but is located in the nucleus. Moreover, compared to the wild type (WT), transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing FtMYB13 had a lower sensitivity to ABA and caused improved drought/salt tolerance, which was attributed to the higher proline content, greater photosynthetic efficiency, higher transcript abundance of some stress-related genes and the smaller amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the transgenic lines compared to WT. Consequently, our work indicates that FtMYB13 is involved in mediating plant responses to ABA, as well as salt and drought.
Anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin (PA) accumulation is regulated by both myeloblastosis (MYB) activators and repressors, but little information is available on hierarchical interactions between the positive and negative regulators. Here, we report on a R2R3-MYB repressor in peach, designated PpMYB18, which acts as a negative regulator of anthocyanin and PA accumulation. PpMYB18 can be activated by both anthocyanin- and PA-related MYB activators, and is expressed both at fruit ripening and juvenile stages when anthocyanins or PAs, respectively, are being synthesized. The PpMYB18 protein competes with MYB activators for binding to basic Helix Loop Helixes (bHLHs), which develops a fine-tuning regulatory loop to balance PA and anthocyanin accumulation. In addition, the bHLH binding motif in the R3 domain and the C1 and C2 repression motifs in the C-terminus of PpMYB18 both confer repressive activity of PpMYB18. Our study also demonstrates a modifying negative feedback loop, which prevents cells from excess accumulation of anthocyanin and PAs, and serves as a model for balancing secondary metabolite accumulation at the transcriptional level.
The phenylpropanoid pathway leads to the production of many important plant secondary metabolites including lignin, chlorogenic acids, flavonoids, and phenolic glycosides. Early studies have demonstrated that flavonoid biosynthesis is transcriptionally regulated, often by a MYB, bHLH, and WDR transcription factor complex. In poplar, several R2R3 MYB transcription factors are known to be involved in flavonoid biosynthesis. Previous work determined that poplar MYB134 and MYB115 are major activators of the proanthocyanidin pathway, and also induce the expression of repressor-like MYB transcription factors. Here we characterize two new repressor MYBs, poplar MYB165 and MYB194, paralogs which comprise a subgroup of R2R3-MYBs distinct from previously reported poplar repressors. Both MYB165 and MYB194 repressed the activation of flavonoid promoters by MYB134 in transient activation assays, and both interacted with a co-expressed bHLH transcription factor, bHLH131, in yeast two-hybrid assays. Overexpression of MYB165 and MYB194 in hybrid poplar resulted in greatly reduced accumulation of several phenylpropanoids including anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins, phenolic glycosides, and hydroxycinnamic acid esters. Transcriptome analysis of MYB165- and MYB194-overexpressing poplars confirmed repression of many phenylpropanoid enzyme genes. In addition, other MYB genes as well as several shikimate pathway enzyme genes were downregulated by MYB165-overexpression. By contrast, leaf aromatic amino acid concentrations were greater in MYB165-overexpressing poplars. Our findings indicate that MYB165 is a major repressor of the flavonoid and phenylpropanoid pathway in poplar, and may also affect the shikimate pathway. The coordinated action of repressor and activator MYBs could be important for the fine tuning of proanthocyanidin biosynthesis during development or following stress.
MicroRNAs (miR) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate diverse biological functions. The bicistronic gene miR-143/145 determines cell fate and phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), in part, by destabilizing Elk-1 mRNA. The transcription factor c-Myb also regulates differentiation and proliferation of VSMC, and here we test whether these effects may be mediated by miR-143/145.
Flow cytometry of cardiovascular-directed d3.75 embryoid bodies (EBs) isolated smooth muscle progenitors with specific cell surface markers. In c-myb knockout (c-myb -/-) EB, these progenitors manifest low levels of miR-143 (19%; p&lt;0.05) and miR-145 (6%; p&lt;0.01) expression as compared to wild-type (wt) EB. Primary VSMC isolated from transgenic mice with diminished expression (c-myblx/lx) or reduced activity (c-mybh/h) of c-Myb also manifest low levels of miR-143 (c-myblx/lx: 50%; c-mybh/h: 41%), and miR-145 (c-myblx/lx: 49%; c-mybh/h: 56%), as compared to wt (P&lt;0.05). Sequence alignment identified four putative c-Myb binding sites (MBS1-4) in the proximal promoter (PP) of the miR-143/145 gene. PP-reporter constructs revealed that point mutations in MBS1 and MBS4 abrogated c-Myb-dependent transcription from the miR-143/145 PP (P&lt;0.01). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) revealed preferential c-Myb binding at MBS4 (p&lt;0.001). By conjugating Elk-1 3'-untranslated region (UTR) to a reporter and co-transducing wt VSMC with this plus a miR-143-antagomir, and co-transducing c-myblx/lx VSMC with this plus a miR-143-mimic, we demonstrate that c-Myb's ability to repress Elk-1 is mediated by miR-143.
c-Myb regulates VSMC gene expression by transcriptional activation of miR-143/145.
The regulation of natural killer (NK) cell activity is an important research goal for the development of immunotherapies. In this study, we identified transcription factors affecting NK cell activity. In particular, we screened transcription factors affected by interleukin-2 (IL-2) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) by protein/DNA arrays using primary NK cells. We found that celastrol, a c-Myb inhibitor, inhibited NK-92 cells more strongly than any other inhibitors of transcription factor candidates. In addition, c-Myb and c-Myb-related signaling molecules, e.g., Nemo-like kinase (NLK) and c-Myc, were regulated by the activation status of NK cells, suggesting that c-Myb is a key regulator of NK cell activity. We also found that celastrol inhibits NK-92-cell-mediated cytotoxicity via the downregulation of NKG2D and granzyme B. Knockdown studies also showed that c-Myb is important for NK cell activation. In particular, the knockdown of c-Myb did not significantly affect NK cell proliferation and survival but decreased the secretion of IFN-γ and the cytotoxicity of NK cells. Our data demonstrate that c-Myb plays a critical role in the activation of NK cells and therefore is a therapeutic target for cancer and viral diseases.
Grass biomass is comprised chiefly of secondary walls that surround fiber and xylem cells. A regulatory network of interacting transcription factors in part regulates cell wall thickening. We identified Brachypodium distachyon SECONDARY WALL ASSOCIATED MYB1 (SWAM1) as a potential regulator of secondary cell wall biosynthesis based on gene expression, phylogeny, and transgenic plant phenotypes. SWAM1 interacts with cellulose and lignin gene promoters with preferential binding to AC-rich sequence motifs commonly found in the promoters of cell wall-related genes. SWAM1 overexpression (SWAM-OE) lines had greater above-ground biomass with only a slight change in flowering time while SWAM1 dominant repressor (SWAM1-DR) plants were severely dwarfed with a striking reduction in lignin of sclerenchyma fibers and stem epidermal cell length. Cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin genes were significantly down-regulated in SWAM1-DR plants and up-regulated in SWAM1-OE plants. There was no reduction in bioconversion yield in SWAM1-OE lines; however, it was significantly increased for SWAM1-DR samples. Phylogenetic and syntenic analyses strongly suggest that the SWAM1 clade was present in the last common ancestor between eudicots and grasses, but is not in the Brassicaceae. Collectively, these data suggest that SWAM1 is a transcriptional activator of secondary cell wall thickening and biomass accumulation in B. distachyon.
Lymph node involvement of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) is characterised by the diffuse infiltration of small neoplastic lymphocytes, which is accompanied by the presence of proliferation centres (PCs) comprising prolymphocytes and paraimmunoblasts. There is increasing evidence of accumulation of various molecular alterations in the tumour cells of PCs, which may explain why extended PCs are related to a less favourable prognosis. To further characterize PCs, we compared the expression level of EZH2 protein, the overexpression of which has recently been recognized as poor prognostic factor in CLL/SLL, in the PCs and the intervening small cell areas in lymph nodes of 15 patients with CLL/SLL. We also investigated the mutational profile of EZH2 and the expression of its upstream regulators c-Myc, E2F1, pRB and miR-26a. Our results showed a significantly increased expression of EZH2 in the PCs. No EZH2 mutations were detected, however, overexpression of c-Myc, E2F1 and pRb proteins as well as reduced expression of the tumor suppressor miR-26a were demonstrated in the PCs. In summary our findings indicate that EZH2 pathway is significantly upregulated in the PCs of CLL/SLL lymph nodes, providing further evidence for the distinguished biological features of the PCs.
The skin represents a physical and chemical barrier against invading pathogens, which is additionally supported by restriction factors that provide intrinsic cellular immunity. These factors detect viruses to block their replication cycle. Here, we uncover the Myb-related transcription factor, partner of profilin (MYPOP) as a novel antiviral protein. It is highly expressed in the epithelium and binds to the minor capsid protein L2 and the DNA of human papillomaviruses (HPV), which are the primary causative agents of cervical cancer and other tumors. The early promoter activity and early gene expression of the oncogenic HPV types 16 and 18 is potently silenced by MYPOP. Cellular MYPOP-depletion relieves the restriction of HPV16 infection, demonstrating that MYPOP acts as a restriction factor. Interestingly, we found that MYPOP protein levels are significantly reduced in diverse HPV-transformed cell lines and in HPV-induced cervical cancer. Decades ago it became clear that the early oncoproteins E6 and E7 cooperate to immortalize keratinocytes by promoting degradation of tumor suppressor proteins. Our findings suggest that E7 stimulates MYPOP degradation. Moreover, overexpression of MYPOP blocks colony formation of HPV and non-virally transformed keratinocytes, suggesting that MYPOP exhibits tumor suppressor properties.
Adenomyoepithelioma (AME) and adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) of the breast have been noted to occur simultaneously, raising the possibility that AME may represent a related or precursor lesion to ACC. ACC frequently harbours genetic rearrangement of the MYB gene. We sought to clarify the relationship between AME and ACC by comparing their rates of MYB expression by IHC and MYB rearrangement by FISH.
IHC and FISH for MYB rearrangement were performed on paraffin-embedded sections of 11 breast ACCs, 11 non-breast ACCs and 11 breast-AMEs. Using FISH, five of eight (63%) interpretable breast ACCs demonstrated MYB gene rearrangement. Nine of 11 (81%) breast ACCs demonstrated MYB expression (range = 20-95%). Of the three FISH-negative breast ACCs, two were solid variant and demonstrated strong MYB expression by IHC. Of the 10 interpretable non-breast ACCs, six showed MYB rearrangement, all of which were conventional type. Nine of these 11 (81%) cases showed MYB immunoexpression (range = 10-90%), including three solid-variant cases which were negative by FISH. No MYB rearrangements were detected by FISH in 10 interpretable AMEs. However, three of 11 cases (27%) showed weak to moderate MYB expression by IHC (range = 10-40%).
Our results indicate that AMEs do not harbour MYB gene rearrangement. IHC for MYB may be helpful in diagnosing FISH-negative cases of ACC, particularly the diagnostically more difficult solid variants. However, weak to moderate MYB expression in a subset of AMEs highlights not only a potential diagnostic pitfall, but also shared pathophysiology with ACC worth investigating further at the genomic level.
The concept of pioneer transcription factors is emerging as an essential part of the epigenetic regulation, taking place during cell development and differentiation. However, the precise molecular mechanism underlying pioneer factor activity remains poorly understood. We recently reported that the transcription factor c-Myb acts as a pioneer factor in haematopoiesis, and a point mutation in its DNA binding domain, D152V, is able to abrogate this function.
Here, we show that specific histone modifications, including H3K27ac, prevent binding of c-Myb to histone tails, representing a novel effect of histone modifications, namely restricting binding of a pioneer factor to chromatin. Furthermore, we have taken advantage of the pioneer-defect D152V mutant to investigate mechanisms of c-Myb's pioneer factor activity. We show that c-Myb-dependent transcriptional activation of a gene in inaccessible chromatin relies on c-Myb binding to histones, as well as on c-Myb interacting with the histone acetyltransferase p300. ChIP assays show that both wild type and the D152V mutant of c-Myb bind to a selected target gene at its promoter and enhancer, but only wild-type c-Myb causes opening and activation of the locus. Enhancement of histone acetylation restores activation of the same gene in the absence of c-Myb, suggesting that facilitating histone acetylation is a crucial part of the pioneer factor function of c-Myb.
We suggest a pioneer factor model in which c-Myb binds to regions of closed chromatin and then recruits histone acetyltransferases. By binding to histones, c-Myb facilitates histone acetylation, acting as a cofactor for p300 at c-Myb bound sites. The resulting H3K27ac leads to chromatin opening and detachment of c-Myb from the acetylated chromatin. We propose that the latter phenomenon, acetylation-induced chromatin dissociation, represents a mechanism for controlling the dynamics of pioneer factor binding to chromatin.
Dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) plays an important role in stress responses, but the transcriptional regulation of DHAR in response to abiotic stress is still poorly understood. In this study, we isolated a novel R2R3-type MYB transcription factor from Pyrus betulaefolia by yeast one-hybrid screening, designated as PbrMYB5. PbrMYB5 was localized in the nucleus and could bind specifically to the promoter of PbrDHAR2. PbrMYB5 was greatly induced by cold and salt but slightly by dehydration. Overexpression of PbrMYB5 in tobacco conferred enhanced tolerance to chilling stresses, whereas down-regulation of PbrMYB5 in P. betulaefolia by virus-induced gene silencing resulted in elevated chilling sensitivity. Transgenic tobacco exhibited higher expression levels of NtDHAR2 and accumulated larger amount of ascorbic acid (AsA) than the wild-type plants. Virus-induced gene silencing of PbrMYB5 in P. betulaefolia down-regulated PbrDHAR2 abundance and decreased AsA level, accompanied by an increased sensitivity to the chilling stress. Taken together, these results demonstrated that PbrMYB5 was an activator of AsA biosynthesis and may play a positive role in chilling tolerance, at least in part, due to the modulation of AsA synthesis by regulating the PbrDHAR2 expression.
Ten years have passed since the molecular cloning of interleukin 6 (IL-6) in 1986. IL-6 is a typical cytokine, exhibiting functional pleiotropy and redundancy. IL-6 is involved in the immune response, inflammation, and hematopoiesis. The IL-6 receptor consists of an IL-6 binding alpha chain and a signal transducer, gp130, which is shared among the receptors for the IL-6 related cytokine subfamily. The sharing of a receptor subunit is a general feature of cytokine receptors and provides the molecular basis for the functional redundancy of cytokines. JAK tyrosine kinase is a key molecule that can initiate multiple signal-transduction pathways by inducing the tyrosine-phosphorylation of the cytokine receptor, gp130 in the case of IL-6, on which several signaling molecules are recruited, including STAT, a signal transducer and activator of transcription, and SHP-2, which links to the Ras-MAP kinase pathway. JAK can also directly activate signaling molecules such as STAT and Tec. These multiple signal-transduction pathways intimately regulate the expression of several genes including c-myc, c-myb, junB, IRF1, egr-1, and bcl-2, leading to the induction of cell growth, differentiation, and survival. The deregulated expression of IL-6 and its receptor is involved in a variety of diseases.
The internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of enteroviruses, and especially human rhinoviruses (HRV), functions very inefficiently in rabbit reticulocyte lysates, but can be stimulated by addition of HeLa cell extracts. Two HeLa cell activities have been identified: the A-type activity is due to polypyrimidine tract binding protein and the B-type to unr. In addition HRV and enterovirus IRES function requires a third RNA binding protein, poly(rC) binding protein 2, but this is present in reticulocyte lysates in non-limiting amounts. IRES activity can also be stimulated by the cleavage of initiation factor eIF4G mediated by either HRV 2A protease, or foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) L protease. This raises the question of whether this stimulation is independent of that effected by the three RNA binding proteins, or whether cleaved eIF4G functionally mimics one or more of these proteins. It is shown here that the stimulation of HRV IRES activity resulting from cleavage of eIF4G is additive with the stimulation effected by HeLa cell A- and B-type activities. It is proposed that the role of the RNA binding proteins is to maintain or attain the appropriate 3-dimensional structure of the IRES RNA element, whereas the function of eIF4G is to deliver the 40S ribosomal subunit to the correct site on the IRES, a function which, for reasons not yet fully understood, is fulfilled more efficiently by the C-terminal cleavage product of eIF4G than by the intact factor.
Drosophila female viability requires translational repression of msl-2 mRNA by the SXL-UNR 3' UTR corepressor complex, which inhibits ribosome recruitment by an unknown mechanism. Here, we reveal a key role for the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), a translational activator, in this inhibitory mechanism. Efficient msl-2 mRNA silencing via the 3' UTR requires both a poly(A) tail and PABP function, and we find that UNR directly interacts with PABP. To investigate how the repressor complex and PABP affect RNP composition during early steps in translation initiation, we established direct biochemical assays for synergistic recruitment of eIF4F and ribosomes by the cap and poly(A) tail. We find that the repressor complex targets ribosome binding after PABP-mediated recruitment of eIF4E/G. Our results uncover an important regulatory mechanism of Drosophila dosage compensation and provide insight into PABP-dependent translational control by 3' UTR-bound regulatory proteins.
