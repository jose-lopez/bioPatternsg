Chronic inflammation of the bile duct and cholestasis are major risk factors, but most cases in the West are sporadic. Genetic polymorphisms in biliary transporter proteins have been implicated in benign biliary disease and, in the case of progressive familial cholestasis, have been associated with childhood onset of CC. In the current study, five biologically plausible candidate genes were investigated: ABCB11 (BSEP), ABCB4 (MDR3), ABCC2 (MRP2), ATP8B1 (FIC1) and NR1H4 (FXR).
DNA was collected from 172 Caucasian individuals with confirmed CC. A control cohort of healthy Caucasians was formed. Seventy-three SNPs were selected using the HapMap database to capture genetic variation around the five candidate loci. Genotyping was undertaken with a competitive PCR-based system. Confirmation of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and Cochran-Armitage trend testing were performed using PLINK. Haplotype frequencies were compared using haplo.stats.
All 73 SNPs were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Four SNPs in ABCB11 were associated with altered susceptibility to CC, including the V444A polymorphism, but these associations did not retain statistical significance after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. Haplotype analysis of the genotyped SNPs in ATP8B1 identified significant differences in frequencies between cases and controls (global p value of 0.005).
Haplotypes in ATP8B1 demonstrated a significant difference between CC and control groups. There was a trend towards significant association of V444A with CC. Given the biological plausibility of polymorphisms in ABCB11 and ATP8B1 as risk modifiers for CC, further study in a validation cohort is required.
The heteromeric organic solute transporter alpha-beta (Ostα-Ostβ) is expressed at relatively high levels on the basolateral membrane of enterocytes, where it plays a critical role in the intestinal absorption of bile acids and the enterohepatic circulation. However, this transporter is also expressed in nearly all human tissues, including those that are not normally thought to be involved in bile acid homeostasis, indicating that Ostα-Ostβ may have additional roles beyond bile acid transport in these other tissues, or that bile acids and their derivatives are more pervasive than currently envisioned. Emerging data from different laboratories provide support for both of these hypotheses. In particular, recent studies indicate that tissues such as brain and ovary have the capacity to synthesize bile acids or bile acid precursors. In addition, studies examining Ostα-Ostβ substrate specificity have revealed that this transporter can also accept conjugated steroids, including some neurosteroids, and that the transporter is selectively expressed in steroidogenic cells of the brain and adrenal gland, suggesting a novel function for Ostα-Ostβ. The broad tissue expression of Ostα-Ostβ is also consistent with the emerging concept that bile acids and their derivatives act as signaling molecules in diverse tissues. Bile acids activate nuclear receptors such as the farnesoid X receptor (FXR/NR1H4), the pregnane X receptor and the vitamin D receptor, are ligands for a G-protein-coupled bile acid receptor (GPBAR1/TGR5), and can also activate protein kinases A and C as well as mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. These signaling pathways are present in many tissues and regulate processes such as triglyceride, glucose and energy homeostasis. Note that although FXR and TGR5 are thought to function primarily as bile acid receptors, they are modulated by some other sterols and select lipid metabolites, and are also widely expressed in tissues, indicating a complex interplay among diverse regulatory networks that impact critical cell and organ functions. The present report summarizes the evidence for a pleiotropic role of Ostα-Ostβ in different tissues.
This study aimed to evaluate the genetic effect of the NR1H4 gene in the pathogenesis of idiopathic infantile cholestasis of Chinese subjects in Guangxi, China.
Seventy-eight patients with idiopathic infantile cholestasis served as a study group and 95 infants without cholestasis as controls. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral venous blood leucocytes by phenol chloroform procedures. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify all coded exons of NR1H4, and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) was used to analyze all amplification fragments. The PCR products with abnormal bands in SSCP were sequenced using an ABI 3100 sequencer.
A novel heterozygous termination codon mutation in NR1H4 exon 5 (NR1H4 R176X, CGA-TGA) was found in one of the 78 patients. The patient with mutation R176X had high levels of bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, γ-glutamyltransferase, cirrhosis and ascites despite biliary tract flushing procedures and drug therapy. In the other patients and controls, no mutation was detected.
Heterozygous termination codon mutation of NR1H4 R176X was found in idiopathic infantile cholestasis. The novel mutation is useful to establish particular characteristics for differential diagnosis of idiopathic infantile cholestasis and to determine the influence of such gene defects in the prognosis.
Bile acids from duodenogastric reflux promote inflammation and increase the risk for gastro-oesophageal cancers. FXR (farnesoid X receptor/NR1H4) is a transcription factor regulated by bile acids such as CDCA (chenodeoxycholic acid). FXR protects the liver and the intestinal tract against bile acid overload; however, a functional role for FXR in the stomach has not been described. We detected FXR expression in the normal human stomach and in GC (gastric cancer). FXR mRNA and protein were also present in the human GC cell lines MKN45 and SNU5, but not in the AGS cell line. Transfection of FXR into AGS cells protected against TNFα (tumour necrosis factor α)-induced cell damage. We identified K13 (keratin 13), an anti-apoptotic protein of desmosomes, as a novel CDCA-regulated FXR-target gene. FXR bound to a conserved regulatory element in the proximal human K13 promoter. Gastric expression of K13 mRNA was increased in an FXR-dependent manner by a chow diet enriched with 1% (w/w) CDCA and by indomethacin (35 mg/kg of body weight intraperitoneal) in C57BL/6 mice. FXR-deficient mice were more susceptible to indomethacin-induced gastric ulceration than their WT (wild-type) littermates. These results suggest that FXR increases the resistance of human and murine gastric epithelial cells to inflammation-mediated damage and may thus participate in the development of GC.
Abnormally elevated lipid and glucose levels due to the disruption of metabolic homeostasis play causative roles in the development of metabolic diseases. A cluster of metabolic conditions, including dyslipidemia, abdominal obesity, and insulin resistance, is referred to as metabolic syndrome, which has been increasing globally at an alarming rate. The primary nuclear bile acid receptor, Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR, NR1H4), plays important roles in controlling lipid and glucose levels by regulating expression of target genes in response to bile acid signaling in enterohepatic tissues. In this review, I discuss how signal-dependent FXR transcriptional activity is dynamically regulated under normal physiological conditions and how it is dysregulated in metabolic disease states. I focus on the emerging roles of post-translational modifications (PTMs) and transcriptional cofactors in modulating FXR transcriptional activity and pathways. Dysregulation of nuclear receptor transcriptional signaling due to aberrant PTMs and cofactor interactions are key determinants in the development of metabolic diseases. Therefore, targeting such abnormal PTMs and transcriptional cofactors of FXR in disease states may provide a new molecular strategy for development of pharmacological agents to treat metabolic syndrome. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Translating nuclear receptors from health to disease.
Chronic HCV (hepatitis C virus)-associated cirrhosis represents a major indication for liver transplantation. Bile acids contribute to hepatic stellate cell activation as a key event in fibrogenesis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of bile acids and polymorphisms in bile acid level-regulating genes on fibrosis progression. A total of 206 subjects with chronic HCV infection were included for ABCB11 (ATP-binding cassette, subfamily B, member II) 1331T&gt;C and NR1H4 (nuclear receptor) -1G&gt;T genotyping, 178 of which were analysed for fibrosis stage. Exclusion criteria were HBV (hepatitis B virus) or HIV coinfection, alcohol &gt;40 g/day and morbid obesity. A total of 358 patients with NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) were genotyped for comparison with a non-viral liver disease. Caucasian individuals (n = 110), undergoing liver resection for focal hepatic metastasis, served as controls. The ABCB11 1331C allele was significantly overrepresented in HCV patients compared with controls {allelic frequency 62.9%; OR (odds ratio), 1.41 [95% CI (confidence interval), 1.012-1.965]}. Median plasma bile acid levels were not significantly increased in the CC compared with TT genotype [7.2 (1-110) μmol/l compared with 3.5 (1-61) μmol/l; values are medians (range). A significant association between the presence of cirrhosis and ABCB11 genotype (CC compared with CT or TT, P=0.047) was observed in the χ2 test and independent of other risk factors of age, gender, body mass index and disease duration in multivariate analysis (P = 0.010). No such association could be observed in fatty liver patients with regard to advanced fibrosis (F ≥ 2). The common ABCB11 1331CC genotype, which is present in 40% of HCV patients and renders the carrier susceptible to increased bile acid levels, is associated with cirrhosis.
Nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs) are transcription factors that work in concert with co-activators and co-repressors to regulate gene expression. Some examples of ligands for NHRs include endogenous compounds such as bile acids, retinoids, steroid hormones, thyroid hormone, and vitamin D. This review describes the evolution of liver X receptors α and β (NR1H3 and 1H2, respectively), farnesoid X receptor (NR1H4), vitamin D receptor (NR1I1), pregnane X receptor (NR1I2), and constitutive androstane receptor (NR1I3). These NHRs participate in complex, overlapping transcriptional regulation networks involving cholesterol homeostasis and energy metabolism. Some of these receptors, particularly PXR and CAR, are promiscuous with respect to the structurally wide range of ligands that act as agonists. A combination of functional and computational analyses has shed light on the evolutionary changes of NR1H and NR1I receptors across vertebrates, and how these receptors may have diverged from ancestral receptors that first appeared in invertebrates.
The nuclear receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR, NR1H4), is known to regulate cholesterol, bile acid, lipoprotein, and glucose metabolism. In the current study, we provide evidence to support a role for FXR in hepatoprotection from acetaminophen (APAP)-induced toxicity. Pharmacological activation of FXR induces the expression of several genes involved in phase II and phase III xenobiotic metabolism in wild-type, but not Fxr(-/-) mice. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation-based genome-wide response element analyses coupled with luciferase reporter assays to identify functional FXR response elements within promoters, introns, or intragenic regions of these genes. Consistent with the observed transcriptional changes, FXR gene dosage is positively correlated with the degree of protection from APAP-induced hepatotoxicity in vivo. Further, we demonstrate that pretreatment of wild-type mice with an FXR-specific agonist provides significant protection from APAP-induced hepatotoxicity. Based on these findings, we propose that FXR plays a role in hepatic xenobiotic metabolism and, when activated, provides hepatoprotection against toxins such as APAP.
The pregnane X receptor (PXR; NR1I2) and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR; NR1H4) regulate the expression of many major metabolic enzymes. With the pig being used as a model for humans in metabolic and toxicological studies and also an important food animal, we characterized the transactivation profile of the porcine orthologs of these receptors, pgPXR and pgFXR. We compared the transactivation profiles of these receptors and their splice variants to their human orthologs using mostly endogenous ligands. Five alternatively spliced variants were identified for pgFXR as part of this study, while five alternatively spliced variants of pgPXR had been previously described. Insertions and deletions within these splice variants generated truncated proteins or proteins with altered tertiary structures, resulting in altered transactivation. Realtime polymerase chain reaction analyses showed that the pgPXR variants were present in liver cDNA samples from 3.33% to 7.92% of the total pgPXR, while the pgFXR variants were present from 1.92% to 9.26% of the total pgFXR. pgFXR was fairly evenly expressed in seven different tissues. In a luciferase reporter assay, wild-type pgPXR (pgPXR-WT) and human PXR (hPXR) responded to 12 common ligands, with similar levels of activation occurring for six of these. Wild-type pgFXR (pgFXR-WT) significantly responded to three ligands, two of which also activated hFXR. 3-Methylindole (skatole) was identified as a novel inverse agonist for pgPXR-WT and pgFXR-WT as well as porcine constitutive androstane receptor. None of the pgPXR splice variants (SVs) were active in the luciferase reporter assay on their own; pgFXR-SV1 was activated by chenodeoxycholic acid to a similar degree as pgFXR-WT. When co-transfected with their corresponding wild-type proteins, pgPXR-SV1 and pgFXR-SV1 significantly increased receptor transactivation. In conclusion, pgPXR-WT and pgFXR-WT both responded to ligands that activated their human orthologs, and some of the alternatively spliced variants significantly altered pgPXR and pgFXR transactivation at in vivo expression levels.
Besides their well-established roles in dietary lipid absorption and cholesterol homeostasis, bile acids (BA) also act as metabolically active signaling molecules. The flux of reabsorbed BA undergoing enterohepatic circulation, arriving in the liver with the co-absorbed nutrients (e.g. glucose, lipids), provides a signal that coordinates hepatic triglyceride (TG), glucose and energy homeostasis. As signaling molecules with systemic endocrine functions, BA can activate protein kinases A and C as well as mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Additionally, they are ligands for a G-protein-coupled BA receptor (TGR5/Gpbar-1) and activate nuclear receptors such as farnesoid X receptor (FXR; NR1H4). FXR and its downstream targets play a key role in the control of hepatic de novo lipogenesis, very-low-density lipoprotein-TG export and plasma TG turnover. BA-activated FXR and signal transduction pathways are also involved in the regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis, glycogen synthesis and insulin sensitivity. Via TGR5, BA are able to stimulate glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion in the small intestine and energy expenditure in brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. Dysregulation of BA transport and impaired BA receptor signaling may contribute to the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Thus, BA transport and BA-controlled nuclear receptors and signaling pathways are promising drug targets for treatment of NAFLD. As such, FXR and/or TGR5 ligands have shown promising results in animal models of NAFLD and clinical pilot studies. Despite being a poor FXR and TGR5 ligand, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) improves hepatic ER stress and insulin sensitivity. Notably, norUDCA, a side chain-shortened homologue of UDCA, improves fatty liver and atherosclerosis in Western diet-fed ApoE(-/-) mice. Collectively, these findings suggest that BA and targeting their receptor/signaling pathways may represent a promising approach to treat NAFLD and closely linked disorders such as obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia and arteriosclerosis.
Nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1; NR5A2) plays a crucial role in the homeostasis of bile acids and cholesterol by controlling the expression of genes central to bile acid synthesis and efflux, reverse cholesterol transport, and high density lipoprotein-remodeling. However, the molecular mechanisms that modulate the transactivation activity of LRH-1 remain unclear. It is proposed that LRH-1's activity is regulated by post-modifications, the binding of small heterodimer partner (SHP), or the binding of coregulators. To search for cofactors that regulate the transactivation activity of LRH-1, we performed a pull-down assay using glutathione S-transferase (GST) fused to the N-terminal portion of LRH-1 and nuclear extracts from HeLa cells, and identified Ku proteins as interacting proteins with LRH-1. We also found that Ku proteins associate with LRH-1 through its DNA-binding domain and hinge region. Luciferase reporter assays revealed that Ku proteins repressed the SHP promoter activity mediated by LRH-1. Furthermore, Ku proteins suppressed the coactivating effect of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha), an LRH-1 coactivator, on the LRH-1-mediated SHP promoter activity. Previously, we showed that Ku proteins interacted with nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR; NR1H4) and decreased the expression of its target gene. In this study, we demonstrated that Ku proteins also interacted with not only LRH-1 but various nuclear receptors, such as the estrogen receptor, PPAR, and Rev-erb. Ku proteins may function as corepressors for various nuclear receptors including LRH-1.
The nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor alpha (FXRalpha, NR1H4) is activated by bile acids in multiple species including mouse, rat, and human and in this study we have identified two isoforms of Fxralpha in Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes), a small freshwater teleost. Both isoforms share a high amino acid sequence identity to mammalian FXRalpha (approximately 70% in the ligand-binding domain). Fxralpha1 and Fxralpha2 differ within the AF1 domain due to alternative splicing at the fourth intron-exon boundary. This process results in Fxralpha1 having an extended N-terminus compared to Fxralpha2. A Gal4DBD-FxralphaLBD fusion construct was activated by chenodeoxycholic, cholic, deoxycholic and lithocholic acids, and the synthetic agonist GW4064 in transient transactivation assays. Activation of the Gal4DBD-FxralphaLBD fusion construct was enhanced by addition of PGC-1alpha, as demonstrated through titration assays. Surprisingly, when the full-length versions of the two Fxralpha isoforms were compared in transient transfection assays, Fxralpha2 was activated by C(24) bile acids and GW4064, while Fxralpha1 was not significantly activated by any of the compounds tested. Since the only significant difference between the full-length constructs was sequence in the AF1 domain, these experiments highlight a key functional region in the Fxralpha AF1 domain. Furthermore, mammalian two-hybrid studies demonstrated the ability of Fxralpha2, but not Fxralpha1, to interact with PGC-1alpha and SRC-1, and supported our results from the transient transfection reporter gene activation assays. These data demonstrate that both mammalian and teleost FXR (Fxralpha2 isoform) are activated by primary and secondary bile acids.
Liver repair is key to resuming homeostasis and preventing fibrogenesis as well as other liver diseases. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR, NR1H4) is an emerging liver metabolic regulator and cell protector. Here we show that FXR is essential to promote liver repair after carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4))-induced injury. Expression of hepatic FXR in wild-type mice was strongly suppressed by CCl(4) treatment, and bile acid homeostasis was disrupted. Liver injury was induced in both wild-type and FXR(-/-) mice by CCl(4), but FXR(-/-) mice had more severe defects in liver repair than wild-type mice. FXR(-/-) livers had a decreased peak of regenerative DNA synthesis and reduced induction of genes involved in liver regeneration. Moreover, FXR(-/-) mice displayed increased mortality and enhanced hepatocyte deaths. During the early stages of liver repair after CCl(4) treatment, we observed overproduction of TNFalpha and a strong decrease of phosphorylation and DNA-binding activity of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 in livers from FXR(-/-) mice. Exogenous expression of a constitutively active signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 protein in FXR(-/-) liver effectively reduced hepatocyte death and liver injury after CCl(4) treatment. These results suggest that FXR is required to regulate normal liver repair by promoting regeneration and preventing cell death.
The small freshwater teleost, medaka (Oryzias latipes), has a history of usage in studies of chronic toxicity of liver and biliary system. Recent progress with this model has focused on defining the medaka hepatobiliary system. Here we investigate critical liver function and toxicity by examining the in vivo role and function of the farnesoid X receptor alpha (FXRalpha, NR1H4), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that plays an essential role in the regulation of bile acid homeostasis. Quantitative mRNA analysis of medaka FXRalpha demonstrates differential expression of two FXRalpha isoforms designated Fxralpha1 and Fxralpha2, in both free swimming medaka embryos with remaining yolk (eleutheroembryos, EEs) and adults. Activation of medaka Fxralpha in vivo with GW4064 (a strong FXRalpha agonist) resulted in modification of gene expression for defined FXRalpha gene targets including the bile salt export protein, small heterodimer partner, and cytochrome P450 7A1. Histological examination of medaka liver subsequent to GW4064 exposure demonstrated significant lipid accumulation, cellular and organelle alterations in both hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells of the liver. This report of hepatobiliary injury following GW4064 exposure extends previous investigations of the intrahepatic biliary system in medaka, reveals sensitivity to toxicant exposure, and illustrates the need for added resolution in detection and interpretation of toxic responses in this vertebrate.
Emodin--a major component of Rheum palmatum L.-exerts antiproliferative effects in cancer cells that are regulated by different signaling pathways. Hepatocellular carcinoma has high-incidence rates and is associated with poor prognosis and high mortality rates. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of emodin on human hepatocarcinoma cell viability and investigate its mechanisms of action in Huh7, Hep3B, and HepG2 cells. To define the molecular changes associated with this process, expression profiles were compared in emodin-treated hepatoma cells by cDNA microarray hybridization, quantitative RT-PCRs, and Western blot analysis. G2/M phase arrest was observed in all 3 cell lines. Cell cycle regulatory gene analysis showed increased protein levels of cyclin A, cyclin B, Chk2, Cdk2, and P27 in hepatoma cells after time courses of emodin treatment, and Western blot analysis showed decreased protein levels of Cdc25c and P21. Microarray expression profile data and quantitative PCR revealed that 15 representative genes were associated with emodin treatment response in hepatoma cell lines. The RNA expression levels of CYP1A1, CYP1B1, GDF15, SERPINE1, SOS1, RASD1, and MRAS were upregulated and those of NR1H4, PALMD, and TXNIP were downregulated in all three hepatoma cells. Moreover, at 6h after emodin treatment, the levels of GDF15, CYP1A1, CYP1B1, and CYR61 were upregulated. Here, we show that emodin treatment caused G2/M arrest in liver cancer cells and increased the expression levels of various genes both in mRNA and protein level. It is likely that these genes act as biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma therapy.
The farnesoid X receptor (FXR; NR1H4) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily and regulates the expression of genes involved in enterohepatic circulation and the metabolism of bile acids. Based on functional analyses, nuclear receptors are divided into regions A-F. To explore the cofactors interacting with FXR, we performed a pull-down assay using GST-fused to the N-terminal A/B region and the C region, which are required for the ligand-independent transactivation and DNA-binding, respectively, of FXR, and nuclear extracts from HeLa cells. We identified DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), Ku80, and Ku70 as FXR associated factors. These proteins are known to have an important role in DNA repair, recombination, and transcription. DNA-PKcs mainly interacted with the A/B region of FXR, whereas the Ku proteins interacted with the C region and with the D region (hinge region). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that the Ku proteins associated with FXR on the bile salt export pump (BSEP) promoter. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ectopic expression of the Ku proteins decreased the promoter activity and expression of BSEP gene mediated by FXR. These results suggest that the Ku proteins function as corepressors for FXR.
As nuclear receptors and transcription factors have an important regulatory function in adipocyte differentiation and fat storage, genetic variation in these key regulators and downstream pathways may be involved in the onset of obesity.
To explore associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes from regulatory pathways that control fatty acid and glucose metabolism, and repeated measurements of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference in a large Dutch study population.
Data of 327 SNPs across 239 genes were analyzed for 3575 participants of the Doetinchem cohort, who were examined three times during 11 years, using the Illumina Golden Gate assay. Adjusted random coefficient models were used to analyze the relationship between SNPS and obesity phenotypes. False discovery rate q-values were calculated to account for multiple testing. Significance of the associations was defined as a q-value &lt; or = 0.20.
Two SNPs (in NR1H4 and SMARCA2 in women only) were significantly associated with both BMI and waist circumference. In addition, two SNPs (in SIRT1 and SCAP in women only) were associated with BMI alone. A functional SNP, in IL6, was strongly associated with waist.
In this explorative study among participants of a large population-based cohort, five SNPs, mainly located in transcription mediator genes, were strongly associated with obesity phenotypes. The results from whole genome and candidate gene studies support the potential role of NR1H4, SIRT1, SMARCA2 and IL6 in obesity. Although replication of our findings and further research on the functionality of these SNPs and underlying mechanism is necessary, our data indirectly suggest a role of GATA transcription factors in weight control.
In healthy individuals, a hyperbolic relationship exists between whole-body insulin-sensitivity and insulin secretion. Thus, for any difference in insulin-sensitivity, a reciprocal proportionate change occurs in insulin secretion. Such a feedback loop is evident in healthy individuals ingesting diets high in saturated fat and in late pregnancy where, despite lipid-induced insulin resistance, glucose tolerance is maintained through augmented GSIS (glucose-stimulated insulin secretion). NRs (nuclear receptors) are members of a superfamily of ligand-regulated and orphan transcription factors. On activation by a cognate ligand, many ligand-activated NRs recruit the RXR (retinoid X receptor) for heterodimer formation. Such NRs include the PPARs (peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptors), which are involved in lipid sensing and liporegulation. PPARs exert important lipid-lowering effects in vivo, thereby opposing the development of lipid-induced insulin resistance by relieving the inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal by muscle and lowering the necessity for augmented GSIS to counter lipid-induced insulin resistance. Long-chain fatty acids are proposed as natural PPAR ligands and some specific endogenous pathways of lipid metabolism are believed to generate PPAR agonists. Other NRs, e.g. the LXR (liver X receptor), which senses expansion of the metabolically active pool of cholesterol, and the FXR (farnesoid X receptor; NR1H4), which, like the LXR, is involved in sterol metabolism, also modulate systemic lipid levels and insulin-sensitivity. In this review, we discuss how these NRs impact insulin secretion via effects on the insulin-sensitivity-insulin secretion feedback loop and, in some cases, via direct effects on the islet itself. In addition, we discuss interactions between these nutrient/metabolite-responsive NRs and NRs that are central to the action of metabolically important hormones, including (i) the glucocorticoid receptor, critical for maintaining glucose homoeostasis in stress, inflammation and during fasting, and (ii) the thyroid hormone receptors, vital for maintenance of oxidative functions. We present data indicating that the RXR occupies a key role in directly modulating islet function and that its heterodimerization with at least two of its partners modulates GSIS.
The nuclear receptor farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR; NR1H4) is expressed not only in the liver, gut, kidney and adipose tissue but also in the immune cells. FXR has been shown to confer protection in several animal models of inflammation, including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). FXR agonists are currently tested in clinical trials for treatment of human metabolic diseases. The beneficial effect of FXR agonists in EAE suggests that FXR might represent a potential target in inflammatory-demyelinating CNS diseases, such as MS. In MS, oligodendrocytes not only undergo cell death but also contribute to remyelination. This repair mechanism is impaired due to a differentiation block of oligodendroglial progenitor cells. Activation of other nuclear receptors that heterodimerize with FXR promote oligodendroglial differentiation. Therefore, we wanted to address the functional relevance of FXR for glial cells, especially for oligodendroglial differentiation.
We isolated primary murine oligodendrocytes from FXR-deficient (FXR Ko) and wild-type (WT) mice and determined the effect of FXR deficiency and activation on oligodendroglial differentiation by analysing markers of oligodendroglial progenitor cells (OPCs) and mature oligodendrocytes (OLs) using qRT-PCR and immunocytochemistry. Additionally, we determined whether FXR activation modulates the pro-inflammatory profile of astrocytes or microglia and whether this may subsequently modulate oligodendroglial differentiation. These in vitro studies were complemented by histological analyses of oligodendrocytes in FXR Ko mice.
FXR is expressed by OPCs and mature oligodendrocytes. However, lack of FXR did not affect oligodendroglial differentiation in vitro or in vivo. Furthermore, activation of FXR using the synthetic agonist GW4064 did not affect oligodendroglial differentiation, remyelination in an ex vivo model or the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules in astrocytes or microglia. Concordantly, no effects of supernatants from macrophages cultured in the presence of GW4064 were observed regarding a possible indirect impact on oligodendroglial differentiation.
Our data suggest that FXR is dispensable for oligodendroglial differentiation and that FXR agonists, such as GW4064, represent a potential therapeutic approach for MS which specifically targets peripheral immune cells including macrophages but not brain-resident cells, such as oligodendrocytes, astrocytes or microglia.
The nuclear receptors PPARα (encoded by NR1C1) and farnesoid X receptor (FXR, encoded by NR1H4) are activated in the liver in the fasted and fed state, respectively. PPARα activation induces fatty acid oxidation, while FXR controls bile acid homeostasis, but both nuclear receptors also regulate numerous other metabolic pathways relevant to liver energy balance. Here we review evidence that they function coordinately to control key nutrient pathways, including fatty acid oxidation and gluconeogenesis in the fasted state and lipogenesis and glycolysis in the fed state. We have also recently reported that these receptors have mutually antagonistic impacts on autophagy, which is induced by PPARα but suppressed by FXR. Secretion of multiple blood proteins is a major drain on liver energy and nutrient resources, and we present preliminary evidence that the liver secretome may be directly suppressed by PPARα, but induced by FXR. Finally, previous studies demonstrated a striking deficiency in bile acid levels in malnourished mice that is consistent with results in malnourished children. We present evidence that hepatic targets of PPARα and FXR are dysregulated in chronic undernutrition. We conclude that PPARα and FXR function coordinately to integrate liver energy balance.
Bile acids (BAs) are steroid molecules that are synthesized in the liver. In addition to their important role as a surfactant in solubilizing lipids and promoting the absorption of lipids in the gastrointestinal tract, they act as inflammagens. The role of BAs and their receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) during viral infection has not been studied in detail.
By using FXR-deficient mice, we investigated the role of bile acid receptor FXR during infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). The importance of FXR in inducing IFN-I and monocytes proliferation were investigated and viral titers and T cell exhaustion were analyzed at different time points.
This study shows that controlled levels of BAs activate FXR in hepatocytes and FXR in response upregulates the production of type I interferon. In turn, FXR maintains BAs within a balanced range to inhibit their toxic effects. The absence of FXR results in high levels of BAs, which inhibit the proliferation of monocytes and result in a defect in viral elimination, consequently leading to T cell exhaustion.
We found that FXR contributes to IFN-I production in hepatocytes and balances BA levels to inhibit their toxic effects on monocytes.
The nuclear receptors (NR)-farnesoid X receptor (FXR, NR1H4) and pregnane X receptor (PXR, NR1I2)-have important effects on the expression of genes related to the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of rosuvastatin. This study was designed to investigate whether the genetic variants in drug disposition genes (SLCO1B1 and ABCG2) combined with their upstream regulators (NR1H4 and NR1I2) would affect the PKs of rosuvastatin in a Chinese population. Sixty-one healthy male volunteers were enrolled and the plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin were measured using the liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometry/MS method. All subjects were analyzed and grouped according to the genotypes of NR1H4, NR1I2, SLCO1B1, and ABCG2. The exposure of rosuvastatin was higher in subjects carrying the SLCO1B1 521C or ABCG2 421A allele compared with noncarriers. No association was observed of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in NR1H4 or NR1I2 genes with the PKs of rosuvastatin. After adjusting for the 421C&gt;A and 521T&gt;C variants, the Cmax in subjects with NR1I2 63396TT wild type were about 2-fold of those of NR1I2 mutant type (63396CC and CT) (10.7 vs. 20.4 ng/mL, P = 0.023), whereas no significant differences were observed for other parameters. Polymorphisms investigated in the genes of NR1H4 and NR1I2 seemed to play no significant role in the disposition of rosuvastatin.
Innate immune responses by myeloid cells decisively contribute to perpetuation of central nervous system (CNS) autoimmunity and their pharmacologic modulation represents a promising strategy to prevent disease progression in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Based on our observation that peripheral immune cells from relapsing-remitting and primary progressive MS patients exhibited strongly decreased levels of the bile acid receptor FXR (farnesoid-X-receptor, NR1H4), we evaluated its potential relevance as therapeutic target for control of established CNS autoimmunity. Pharmacological FXR activation promoted generation of anti-inflammatory macrophages characterized by arginase-1, increased IL-10 production, and suppression of T cell responses. In mice, FXR activation ameliorated CNS autoimmunity in an IL-10-dependent fashion and even suppressed advanced clinical disease upon therapeutic administration. In analogy to rodents, pharmacological FXR activation in human monocytes from healthy controls and MS patients induced an anti-inflammatory phenotype with suppressive properties including control of effector T cell proliferation. We therefore, propose an important role of FXR in control of T cell-mediated autoimmunity by promoting anti-inflammatory macrophage responses.
Farnesoid X receptor (FXR, NR1H4) plays an important role in the regulation of bile acid homeostasis in liver and intestine and may exert protective effects against certain forms of cancer such as colon carcinoma. However, the role of FXR in cell growth regulation, apoptosis, and carcinogenesis is still controversial. Similar to FXR, microRNA-192 (miR-192) is mainly expressed in the liver and colon and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of colon carcinoma. In this study, we investigated the extent to which FXR is regulated by miR-192. Two in silico-predicted binding sites for miR-192-3p within the NR1H4-3' untranslated region (UTR) were examined in vitro by luciferase reporter assays. Wild-type and mutated forms of the NR1H4-3'UTR were subcloned into a pmirGLO vector and cotransfected into Huh-7 cells with miR-192-3p. To study the effects of miR-192 on the expression of FXR, FXR target genes and cell proliferation, Huh-7 and Caco-2 cells were transfected with miR-192-5p and -3p mimics or antagomirs. In addition, the correlation between FXR and miR-192 expression was studied by linear regression analyses in colonic adenocarcinoma tissue from 27 patients. MiR-192-3p bound specifically to the NR1H4-3'UTR and significantly decreased luciferase activity. Transfection with miR-192 led to significant decreases in NR1H4 mRNA and protein levels as well as the mRNA levels of the FXR-inducible bile acid transporters OSTα-OSTβ and OATP1B3. Significant inverse correlations were detected in colonic adenocarcinoma between NR1H4 mRNA and miR-192-3p expression. In summary, microRNA-192 suppresses the expression of FXR and FXR target genes in vitro and in vivo.
Zebrafish phenotypic assays have shown promise to assess human hepatotoxicity, though scoring of liver morphology remains subjective and difficult to standardize. Liver toxicity in zebrafish larvae at 5 days was assessed using gene expression as the biomarker approach, complementary to phenotypic analysis and analytical data on compound uptake. This approach aimed to contribute to improved hepatotoxicity prediction, with the goal of identifying biomarker(s) as a step towards the development of transgenic models for prioritization. Morphological effects of hepatotoxic compounds (acetaminophen, amiodarone, coumarin, methapyrilene and myclobutanil) and saccharin as the negative control were assessed after exposure in zebrafish larvae. The hepatotoxic compounds induced the expected zebrafish liver degeneration or changes in size, whereas saccharin did not have any phenotypic adverse effect. Analytical methods based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were optimized to measure stability of selected compounds in exposure medium and internal concentration in larvae. All compounds were stable, except amiodarone for which precipitation was observed. There was a wide variation between the levels of compound in the zebrafish larvae with a higher uptake of amiodarone, methapyrilene and myclobutanil. Detection of hepatocyte markers (CP, CYP3A65, GC and TF) was accomplished by in situ hybridization of larvae to coumarin and myclobutanil and confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Experiments showed decreased expression of all markers. Next, other liver-specific biomarkers (i.e. FABP10a and NR1H4) and apoptosis (i.e. CASP-3 A and TP53) or cytochrome P450-related (CYP2K19) and oxidoreductase activity-related (ZGC163022) genes, were screened. Links between basic mechanisms of liver injury and results of biomarker responses are described. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.
Neonatal cholestasis is a potentially life-threatening condition requiring prompt diagnosis. Mutations in several different genes can cause progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis, but known genes cannot account for all familial cases. Here we report four individuals from two unrelated families with neonatal cholestasis and mutations in NR1H4, which encodes the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a bile acid-activated nuclear hormone receptor that regulates bile acid metabolism. Clinical features of severe, persistent NR1H4-related cholestasis include neonatal onset with rapid progression to end-stage liver disease, vitamin K-independent coagulopathy, low-to-normal serum gamma-glutamyl transferase activity, elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein and undetectable liver bile salt export pump (ABCB11) expression. Our findings demonstrate a pivotal function for FXR in bile acid homeostasis and liver protection. 
Bile acids are steroid-derived molecules synthesized in the liver, secreted from hepatocytes into the bile canaliculi, and subsequently stored in the gall bladder. During the feeding, bile flows into the duodenum, where it contributes to the solubilization and digestion of lipid-soluble nutrients. After a meal, bile-acid levels increase in the intestine, liver, and also in the systemic circulation. Therefore, serum bile-acid levels serve as an important sensing mechanism for nutrient and energy. Recent studies have described bile acids as versatile signaling molecules endowed with systemic endocrine functions. Bile acids are ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as TGR5 (also known as GPBAR1, M-BAR, and BG37) and nuclear hormone receptors including farnesoid X receptor (FXR; also known as NR1H4). Acting through these diverse signaling pathways, bile acids regulate triglyceride, cholesterol, glucose homeostasis, and energy expenditure. These bile-acid-controlled signaling pathways have become the source of promising novel drug targets to treat common metabolic and hepatic diseases.
Infected pork meat is an important source of non-typhoidal human salmonellosis. Understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in disease pathogenesis is important for the development of therapeutic and preventive strategies. Thus, hereby we study the transcriptional profiles along the porcine intestine during infection with Salmonella Typhimurium, as well as post-transcriptional gene modulation by microRNAs (miRNA). Sixteen piglets were orally challenged with S. Typhimurium. Samples from jejunum, ileum and colon, collected 1, 2 and 6 days post infection (dpi) were hybridized to mRNA and miRNA expression microarrays and analyzed. Jejunum showed a reduced transcriptional response indicating mild inflammation only at 2 dpi. In ileum inflammatory genes were overexpressed (e.g., IL-1B, IL-6, IL-8, IL1RAP, TNFα), indicating a strong immune response at all times of infection. Infection also down-regulated genes of the FXR pathway (e.g., NR1H4, FABP6, APOA1, SLC10A2), indicating disruption of the bile acid absorption in ileum. This result was confirmed by decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in serum of infected pigs. Ileal inflammatory gene expression changes peaked at 2 dpi and tended to resolve at 6 dpi. Furthermore, miRNA analysis of ileum at 2 dpi revealed 62 miRNAs potentially regulating target genes involved in this inflammatory process (e.g., miR-374 and miR-451). In colon, genes involved in epithelial adherence, proliferation and cellular reorganization were down-regulated at 2 and 6 dpi. In summary, here we show the transcriptional changes occurring at the intestine at different time points of the infection, which are mainly related to inflammation and disruption of the bile acid metabolism.
Bile acids, synthesized by hepatocytes from cholesterol, are specific and quantitatively important organic components of bile, where they are the main driving force of the osmotic process that generates bile flow toward the canaliculus. The bile acid pool comprises a variety of species of amphipathic acidic steroids. They are not mere detergent molecules that play a key role in fat digestion and the intestinal absorption of hydrophobic compounds present in the intestinal lumen after meals, including liposoluble vitamins. They are now known to be involved in the regulation of multiple functions in liver cells, mainly hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, and also in extrahepatic tissues. The identification of nuclear receptors, such as farnesoid X receptor (FXR or NR1H4), and plasma membrane receptors, such as the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor (TGR5, GPBAR1 or MBAR), which are able to trigger specific and complex responses upon activation (with dissimilar sensitivities) by different bile acid molecular species and synthetic agonists, has opened a new and promising field of research whose implications extend to physiology, pathology and pharmacology. In addition, pharmacological development has taken advantage of advances in the understanding of the chemistry and biology of bile acids and the biological systems that interact with them, which in addition to the receptors include several families of transporters and export pumps, to generate novel bile acid derivatives aimed at treating different liver diseases, such as cholestasis, biliary diseases, metabolic disorders and cancer. This review is an update of the role of bile acids in health and disease. 
Angiogenesis is vitally important in diabetic wound healing. We had previously demonstrated that a Chinese 2-herb formula (NF3) significantly stimulated angiogenesis of HUVEC in wound healing. However, the molecular mechanism has not yet been elucidated. In line with this, global expression profiling of NF3-treated HUVEC was performed so as to assess the regulatory role of NF3 involved in the underlying signaling pathways in wound healing angiogenesis. The microarray results illustrated that different panels of differentially expressed genes were strictly governed in NF3-treated HUVEC in a time-regulated manner. The microarray analysis followed by qRT-PCR and western blotting verification of NF3-treated HUVEC at 6 h revealed the involvement of various genes in diverse biological process, e.g., MAP3K14 in anti-inflammation; SLC5A8 in anti-tumorogenesis; DNAJB7 in protein translation; BIRC5, EPCAM, INSL4, MMP8 and NPR3 in cell proliferation; CXCR7, EPCAM, HAND1 and MMP8 in migration; CXCR7, EPCAM and MMP8 in tubular formation; and BIRC5, CXCR7, EPCAM, HAND1, MMP8 and UBD in angiogenesis. After 16 h incubation of NF3, other sets of genes were shown with differential expression in HUVEC, e.g., IL1RAPL2 and NR1H4 in anti-inflammation; miR28 in anti-tumorogenesis; GRIN1 and LCN1 in anti-oxidation; EPB41 in intracellular signal transduction; PRL and TFAP2A in cell proliferation; miR28, PRL and SCG2 in cell migration; PRL in tubular formation; and miR28, NR1H4 and PRL in angiogenesis. This study provided concrete scientific evidence in support of the regulatory role of NF3 on endothelial cells involved in wound healing angiogenesis. 
We studied the impact of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) on the density and hormonal gene expression of small-intestinal enteroendocrine cells in obese patients with type 2 diabetes.
Twelve patients with diabetes and 11 age- and BMI-matched controls underwent RYGB followed by enteroscopy ~10 months later. Mucosal biopsies taken during surgery and enteroscopy were immunohistochemically stained for glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), peptide YY (PYY), cholecystokinin (CCK), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and prohormone convertase 2 (PC2) and the expression of GCG (encoding preproglucagon), PYY, CCK, GIP, GHRL (encoding ghrelin), SCT (encoding secretin), NTS (encoding neurotensin) and NR1H4 (encoding farnesoid X receptor) was evaluated.
The density of cells immunoreactive for GLP-1, CCK and GIP increased in patients after RYGB and the density of those immunoreactive for GLP-1, PYY, CCK and PC2 increased in controls. In both groups, GHRL, SCT and GIP mRNA was reduced after RYGB while PYY, CCK, NTS and NR1H4 gene expression was unaltered. GCG mRNA was upregulated in both groups.
Numerous alterations in the distribution of enteroendocrine cells and their expression of hormonal genes are seen after RYGB and include increased density of GLP-1-, PYY-, CCK-, GIP- and PC2-positive cells, reduced gene expression of GHRL, SCT and GIP and increased expression of GCG.
Bile acid (BA) is de novo synthesized exclusively in the liver and has direct or indirect antimicrobial effects. On the other hand, the composition and size of the BA pool can be altered by intestinal microbiota via the biotransformation of primary BAs to secondary BAs, and subsequently regulate the nuclear farnesoid X receptor (FXR; NR1H4). The BA-activated FXR plays important roles in BA synthesis and metabolism, glucose and lipid metabolism, and even hepatic autophagy. BAs can also play a role in the interplays among intestinal microbes. In this review, we mainly discuss the interactions between BAs and intestinal microbiota and their roles in regulating host metabolism, and probably the autophagic signaling pathway. 
To investigate the effect of two extracts obtained from Agaricus bisporus on the mRNA expression of cholesterol-related genes. One of the extracts contained ergosterol and other fungal sterols (SFE) and the other contained β-glucans and fungal sterols (EβG).
Firstly, the dietary mixed micelles (DMMs) generated after in vitro digestion of standards and SFE were applied to Caco2 cells. Then, the lower compartment after a Caco2-transport experiment was applied to HepG2 cells. The mRNA expression was assessed in both cell lines by low-density arrays (LDA). Mice received the extracts, ergosterol or control drugs after 4 weeks of a high-cholesterol diet. The lipid profile of plasma, liver and feces was determined. LDA assays were performed in liver and intestines.
The DMM fraction of SFE up-regulated the LDLR mRNA expression in Caco2 cells. The lower compartment after Caco2-transport experiments up-regulated LDLR and modulated several other lipid-related genes in HepG2 cells. In mice, SFE decreased TC/HDL ratio and reduced hepatic triglycerides paralleled with down-regulation of Dgat1 expression, while EβG did it without transcriptional changes. Addition of SFE or ergosterol induced in jejunum a similar transcriptional response to simvastatin and ezetimibe; they all down-regulated Srebf2 and Nr1h4 (FXR) genes.
Ergosterol-containing extracts from A. bisporus lowered hepatic triglyceride and modify the mRNA expression of cholesterol-related genes although the transcriptional regulation was unrelated to changes in plasma lipid profile. These extracts may be useful limiting hepatic steatosis and as bioactive ingredients to design novel functional foods preventing lifestyle-related diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
Increased consumption of folic acid is prevalent, leading to concerns about negative consequences. The effects of folic acid on the liver, the primary organ for folate metabolism, are largely unknown. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) provides methyl donors for S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) synthesis and methylation reactions.
Our goal was to investigate the impact of high folic acid intake on liver disease and methyl metabolism.
Folic acid-supplemented diet (FASD, 10-fold higher than recommended) and control diet were fed to male Mthfr(+/+) and Mthfr(+/-) mice for 6 mo to assess gene-nutrient interactions. Liver pathology, folate and choline metabolites, and gene expression in folate and lipid pathways were examined.
Liver and spleen weights were higher and hematologic profiles were altered in FASD-fed mice. Liver histology revealed unusually large, degenerating cells in FASD Mthfr(+/-) mice, consistent with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. High folic acid inhibited MTHFR activity in vitro, and MTHFR protein was reduced in FASD-fed mice. 5-Methyltetrahydrofolate, SAM, and SAM/S-adenosylhomocysteine ratios were lower in FASD and Mthfr(+/-) livers. Choline metabolites, including phosphatidylcholine, were reduced due to genotype and/or diet in an attempt to restore methylation capacity through choline/betaine-dependent SAM synthesis. Expression changes in genes of one-carbon and lipid metabolism were particularly significant in FASD Mthfr(+/-) mice. The latter changes, which included higher nuclear sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1, higher Srepb2 messenger RNA (mRNA), lower farnesoid X receptor (Nr1h4) mRNA, and lower Cyp7a1 mRNA, would lead to greater lipogenesis and reduced cholesterol catabolism into bile.
We suggest that high folic acid consumption reduces MTHFR protein and activity levels, creating a pseudo-MTHFR deficiency. This deficiency results in hepatocyte degeneration, suggesting a 2-hit mechanism whereby mutant hepatocytes cannot accommodate the lipid disturbances and altered membrane integrity arising from changes in phospholipid/lipid metabolism. These preliminary findings may have clinical implications for individuals consuming high-dose folic acid supplements, particularly those who are MTHFR deficient.
The nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) (nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group H, member 4, or NR1H4) is highly expressed in the liver and intestine. Previous reports have suggested beneficial functions of FXR in the homeostasis of bile acids, lipids, and glucose, as well as in promoting liver regeneration and inhibiting carcinogenesis. To investigate the effect of chronic FXR activation in vivo, we generated transgenic mice that conditionally and tissue specifically express the activated form of FXR in the liver and intestine. Unexpectedly, the transgenic mice showed several intriguing phenotypes, including partial neonatal lethality, growth retardation, and spontaneous liver toxicity. The transgenic mice also displayed heightened sensitivity to a high-cholesterol diet-induced hepatotoxicity but resistance to the gallstone formation. The phenotypes were transgene specific, because they were abolished upon treatment with doxycycline to silence the transgene expression. The perinatal toxicity, which can be rescued by a maternal vitamin supplement, may have resulted from vitamin deficiency due to low biliary bile acid output as a consequence of inhibition of bile acid formation. Our results also suggested that the fibroblast growth factor-inducible immediate-early response protein 14 (Fn14), a member of the proinflammatory TNF family, is a FXR-responsive gene. However, the contribution of Fn14 induction in the perinatal toxic phenotype of the transgenic mice remains to be defined. Because FXR is being explored as a therapeutic target, our results suggested that a chronic activation of this nuclear receptor may have an unintended side effect especially during the perinatal stage. 
Pigs are well recognized as a model for humans in research studies due to similarities in metabolism and physiology between the two species. The potential for pigs to model humans in studying metabolic diseases is highly dependent on similarities in hepatic metabolism between the two species, including similarities in the farnesoid X receptor (FXR; NR1H4) which regulate bile acid homeostasis. During initial cloning of porcine FXR (pFXR), an alternative splice variant (pFXR-SV1) was isolated which contained a four amino acid (MYTG) insert that exerted a dominant positive effect on the wild type receptor (pFXR-WT). The current study investigated the role of this insert in the dominant positive effect. Individual point mutations were made to the first three amino acids of the MYTG insert. Mutations of the methionine (M) or threonine (T) to alanine (A) reduced the dominant positive effect, while mutation of the tyrosine (Y) to either A or phenylalanine (F) completely abolished the dominant positive effect. Treatment with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4) increased the dominant positive effect of pFXR-SV1 by about 30%. These results suggest that the dominant positive effect may be dependent on the phosphorylation status of the tyrosine in the MYTG insert. The human variant hFXRα+ has the same MYTG insert as pFXR-SV1, but did not cause a dominant positive effect on hFXR-WT and significantly reduced the activity of hFXR-WT. Thus, although the MYTG insert is conserved in both human and pig, the effects of this insert are different in the two species.
To determine whether activation of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) alters cellular and plasma cholesterol homeostasis as a result of regulation of Srebp-2 and miR-33.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data identified an FXR response element within intron 10 of the Srebp-2 gene. Consistent with this observation, treatment of mice with FXR-specific agonists (GSK2324 or GW4064) rapidly increased hepatic levels of Srebp-2 mRNA, precursor sterol response element binding protein 2 (pSREBP-2) protein, and miR-33. Furthermore, miR-33 targets, that include ABCA1 (ATP binding cassette transporter A1), NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor), and CPT1 (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1), were all reduced in GSK2324-treated mice. In contrast, neither nuclear SREBP-2 protein (nSREBP-2) nor SREBP-2 target genes were induced after FXR activation. The inability to process pSREBP-2 to nSREBP-2 is likely a consequence of the induction of insulin INSIG-2A (induced gene 2A) by FXR agonists. Finally, we show that FXR-dependent induction of both Srebp-2 and miR-33 is ablated in Scap(-/-) mice that lack nuclear SREBP-2.
We demonstrate that the activation of FXR uncouples the expression of nuclear SREBP-2 and miR-33, and the regulation of their respective target genes. Further, we conclude that the FXR agonist-dependent increase in miR-33 requires transcription of the Srebp-2 gene.
The cationic, water-soluble quaternary trospium chloride (TC) is incompletely absorbed from the gut and undergoes wide distribution but does not pass the blood-brain barrier. It is secreted by the kidneys, liver, and intestine. To evaluate potential transport mechanisms for TC, we measured affinity of the drug to the human uptake and efflux transporters known to be of pharmacokinetic relevance. Affinity of TC to the uptake transporters OATP1A2, -1B1, -1B3, -2B1, OCT1, -2, -3, OCTN2, NTCP, and ASBT and the efflux carriers P-gp, MRP2 and MRP3 transfected in HEK293 and MDCK2 cells was measured. To identify relevant pharmacokinetic mechanisms in the bladder urothelium, mRNA expression of multidrug transporters, drug metabolizing enzymes, and nuclear receptors, and the uptake of TC into primary human bladder urothelium (HBU) cells were measured. TC was shown to be a substrate of OATP1A2 (Km = 6.9 ± 1.3 μmol/L; Vmax = 41.6 ± 1.8 pmol/mg·min), OCT1 (Km = 106 ± 16 μmol/L; Vmax = 269 ± 18 pmol/mg·min), and P-gp (Km = 34.9 ± 7.5 μmol/L; Vmax = 105 ± 9.1 pmol/mg·min, lipovesicle assay). The genetic OATP1A2 variants *2 and *3 were loss-of-function transporters for TC. The mRNA expression analysis identified the following transporter proteins in the human urothelium: ABCB1 (P-gp), ABCC1-5 (MRP1-5), ABCG2 (BCRP), SLCO2B1 (OATP2B1), SLCO4A1 (OATP4A1), SLC22A1 (OCT1), SLC22A3 (OCT3), SLC22A4 (OCTN1), SLC22A5 (OCTN2), and SLC47A1 (MATE1). Immuno-reactive P-gp and OATP1A2 were localized to the apical cell layers. Drug metabolizing enzymes CYP3A5, -2B6, -2B7 -2E1, SULT1A1-4, UGT1A1-10, and UGT2B15, and nuclear receptors NR1H3 and NR1H4 were also expressed on mRNA level. TC was taken up into HBU cells (Km = 18.5 ± 4.8 μmol/L; Vmax = 106 ± 11.3 pmol/mg·min) by mechanisms that could be synergistically inhibited by naringin (IC50 = 10.8 (8.4; 13.8) μmol/L) and verapamil (IC50 = 4.6 (2.8; 7.5) μmol/L), inhibitors of OATP1A2 and OCT1, respectively. Affinity of TC to OCT1 and P-glycoprotein may be the reason for incomplete oral absorption, wide distribution into liver and kidneys, and substantial intestinal and renal secretions. Absence of brain distribution may result from affinity to P-gp and a low affinity to OATP1A2. The human urothelium expresses many drug transporters and drug metabolizing enzymes that may interact with TC and other drugs eliminated into the urine. 
Farnesoid X receptor (FXR, NR1H4), a nuclear receptor (NR) highly expressed in the liver, intestine, kidney, adrenal glands and other cholesterol-rich tissues, functions as the master regulator for bile acid homeostasis. FXR, which regulates the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in cholesterol homeostasis, plays an essential role in regulating cholesterol, lipid, and glucose metabolism. Recently, some FXR agonists are reported to have low selectivity on NRs, which forces the researchers to move their eyes onto the development of FXR antagonists with high selectivity. The development of non-steroidal FXR antagonists with different scaffolds including AGN34, tuberatolides, atractylenolides, andrographolides, GW4064 derivatives and 1,3,4-trisubstitutedpyrazolones, provides us a prospect for the therapy of in ammation, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, cholesterol gallstones, and cancer. 
Histone deacetylases (HDACs) can enzymatically transferred acetyl functional group from protein or lysine residues of histone, so they can regulate the expression of lots of genes. Now HDACs are used as drug targets and many HDAC inhibitors (HDACis) were approved for cancer therapy or in clinical trials. However, the physiological mechanisms and regulatory processes of HDACi anti-cancer effects are largely unexplored and uncompleted. Here we use the virtual screening workflow obtained 25 hit compounds and ZINC24469384 can significantly inhibit HDAC activity while arrest cell cycle at G1/S phase and significantly induced HepG2 cell apoptosis, time-course RNA-seq demonstrate that HepG2 cells transcriptionally respond to ZINC24469384. Pathway analysis of DEGs and DASGs reveal that NR1H4 may play an important role in ZINC24469384-induced anti-proliferation effect and is dramatically alleviated by down-regulating the SOCS2 expression and promoting STAT3 phosphorylation in knockdown NR1H4 HepG2 cells. Analysis based on TCGA database indicated that NR1H4 and SOCS2 were downregulated in liver cancer, this suggest NR1H4 and SOCS2 may play an important role in tumorigenesis. These results indicated that ZINC24469384 is a novel benzamine lead compound of HDACi and provides a novel mechanism for HDACi to inhibit cancer.
Lipid expression is increased in the atrial myocytes of mitral regurgitation (MR) patients. This study aimed to investigate key regulatory genes and mechanisms of atrial lipotoxic myopathy in MR.
The HL-1 atrial myocytes were subjected to uniaxial cyclic stretching for eight hours. Fatty acid metabolism, lipoprotein signaling, and cholesterol metabolism were analyzed by PCR assay (168 genes).
The stretched myocytes had significantly larger cell size and higher lipid expression than non-stretched myocytes (all p &lt; 0.001). Fatty acid metabolism, lipoprotein signaling, and cholesterol metabolism in the myocytes were analyzed by PCR assay (168 genes). In comparison with their counterparts in non-stretched myocytes, seven genes in stretched monocytes (Idi1, Olr1, Nr1h4, Fabp2, Prkag3, Slc27a5, Fabp6) revealed differential upregulation with an altered fold change &gt;1.5. Nine genes in stretched monocytes (Apoa4, Hmgcs2, Apol8, Srebf1, Acsm4, Fabp1, Acox2, Acsl6, Gk) revealed differential downregulation with an altered fold change &lt;0.67. Canonical pathway analysis, using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software, revealed that the only genes in the "superpathway of cholesterol biosynthesis" were Idi1 (upregulated) and Hmgcs2 (downregulated). The fraction of stretched myocytes expressing Nile red was significantly decreased by RNA interference of Idi1 (p &lt; 0.05) and was significantly decreased by plasmid transfection of Hmgcs2 (p = 0.004).
The Idi1 and Hmgcs2 genes have regulatory roles in atrial lipotoxic myopathy associated with atrial enlargement.
Nucleoside diphosphate kinase 7, non-metastatic cells 7 (NME7) is an acknowledged member of ciliome and is involved in the biogenesis or function of cilia. As obesity and diabetes are common in several ciliopathies, we aimed to analyze changes of gene expression within Nme7 interactome in genetically designed rat models of metabolic syndrome. We assessed the liver transcriptome by Affymetrix microarrays in adult males of 14 PXO recombinant inbred rat strains and their two progenitor strains, SHR-Lx and BXH2. In the strains with the lowest expression of Nme7, we have identified significant enrichment of transcripts belonging to Nme7 interactome. In the subsequent network analysis, we have identified three major upstream regulators - Hnf4a, Ppara and Nr1h4 and liver steatosis (p=0.0001) and liver necrosis/cell death (apoptosis of liver cells, p=0.0003) among the most enriched Tox categories. The mechanistic network reaching the top score showed substantial overlap with Assembly of non-motile cilium and Glucose metabolism disorder gene lists. In summary, we show in a genetic model of metabolic syndrome that rat strains with the lowest expression of Nme7 present gene expression shifts of Nme7 interactome that are perturbing networks relevant for carbohydrate and lipid metabolism as well as ciliogenesis.
Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent disease. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) activation has been shown to inhibit estrogen signaling in breast cancer and testicular tumors. However, the role of FXR in endometriosis is still poorly understood. Here, we aimed to investigate whether FXR activation by its synthetic agonist GW4064 has a therapeutic effect on endometriosis and the underlying molecular mechanisms. We found that the expression of FXR (encoded by the NR1H4 gene) in endometriotic tissues and stromal cells (ESCs) was higher than that in eutopic endometrial tissues and stromal cells. The GW4064 treatment led to a dose-dependent decrease in aromatase and estrogen receptor β (ERβ) expression and induced ERK1/2, p38, AMPK, and Stat3 activation in ESCs. In contrast, ERK1/2 inhibitor reversed the GW4064-induced reduction in aromatase expression. In addition, treatment with p38, AMPK, and Stat3 inhibitors or small interfering RNAs could also reverse the GW4064-induced reduction of ERβ expression in ESCs. The GW4064 treatment markedly increased Stat3 phosphorylation, enhancing the binding of Stat3 to the ESR2 promoter, which resulted in the downregulation of ERβ. Coimmunoprecipitation assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that FXR was able to compete with cyclic AMP response element-binding (CREB) protein for binding to a common sequence on the aromatase promoter region after GW4064 treatment in ESCs. Moreover, treatment of endometriosis xenografts with GW4064 suppressed aromatase and ERβ expression in nude mice. Our results suggest that FXR may represent a potential therapeutic target for future therapy.
Dietary and genetic folate disturbances can lead to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). A common variant in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR 677C→T) causes mild MTHFR deficiency with lower 5-methyltetrahydrofolate for methylation reactions. The goal is to determine whether mild murine MTHFR deficiency contributes to NAFLD-related effects.
Wild-type and Mthfr+/- mice, a model for the human variant, are fed control (CD) or high-fat (HFAT) diets for 8 weeks. On both diets, MTHFR deficiency results in decreased S-adenosylmethionine, increased S-adenosylhomocysteine, and decreased betaine with reduced methylation capacity, and changes in expression of several inflammatory or anti-inflammatory mediators (Saa1, Apoa1, and Pon1). On CD, MTHFR deficiency leads to microvesicular steatosis with expression changes in lipid regulators Xbp1s and Cyp7a1. The combination of MTHFR deficiency and HFAT exacerbates changes in inflammatory mediators and introduces additional effects on inflammation (Saa2) and lipid metabolism (Nr1h4, Srebf1c, Ppara, and Crot). These effects are consistent with increased expression of pro-inflammatory HDL precursors and greater lipid accumulation. MTHFR deficiency may enhance liver injury through alterations in methylation capacity, inflammatory response, and lipid metabolism.
Individuals with the MTHFR variant may be at increased risk for liver disease and related complications, particularly when consuming high-fat diets.
To test the application of a target enrichment next-generation sequencing (NGS) jaundice panel in genetic diagnosis of pediatric liver diseases.
We developed a capture-based target enrichment NGS jaundice panel containing 42 known disease-causing genes associated with jaundice or cholestasis and 10 pathway-related genes. During 2015-2017, 102 pediatric patients with various forms of cholestasis or idiopathic liver diseases were tested, including patients with initial diagnosis of cholestasis in infancy, progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis, syndromic cholestasis, Wilson disease, and others.
Of the 102 patients, 137 mutations/variants in 44 different genes were identified in 84 patients. The genetic disease diagnosis rate was 33 of 102 (32.4%). A total of 79 of 102 (77.5%) of patients had at least 1 heterozygous genetic variation. Those with progressive intrahepatic cholestasis or syndromic cholestasis in infancy had a diagnostic rate of 62.5%. Disease-causing mutations, including ATP8B1, ABCB11, ABCB4, ABCC2, TJP2, NR1H4 (FXR), JAG1, AKR1D1, CYP7B1, PKHD1, ATP7B, and SLC25A13, were identified. Nine patients had unpredicted genetic diagnosis with atypical phenotype or novel mutations in the investigational genes. We propose an NGS diagnosis classification categorizing patients into high (n = 24), moderate (n = 9), or weak (n = 25) levels of genotype-phenotype correlations to facilitate patient management.
This panel enabled high-throughput detection of genetic variants and disease diagnosis in patients with a long list of candidate causative genes. A NGS report with diagnosis classification may aid clinicians in data interpretation and patient management.
Searching for novel sequence variants associated with cholesterol levels is of particular interest due to the causative role of non-HDL cholesterol levels in cardiovascular disease. Through whole-genome sequencing of 15,220 Icelanders and imputation of the variants identified, we discovered a rare missense variant in NR1H4 (R436H) associating with lower levels of total cholesterol (effect = -0.47 standard deviations or -0.55 mmol L-1, p = 4.21 × 10-10, N = 150,211). Importantly, NR1H4 R436H also associates with lower levels of non-HDL cholesterol and, consistent with this, protects against coronary artery disease. NR1H4 encodes FXR that regulates bile acid homeostasis, however, we do not detect a significant association between R436H and biological markers of liver function. Transcriptional profiling of hepatocytes carrying R436H shows that it is not a loss-of-function variant. Rather, we observe changes in gene expression compatible with effects on lipids. These findings highlight the role of FXR in regulation of cholesterol levels in humans.
Genetic cholestasis has been dissected through genetic investigation. The major PFIC genes are now described. ATP8B1 encodes FIC1, ABCB11 encodes BSEP, ABCB4 encodes MDR3, TJP2 encodes TJP2, NR1H4 encodes FXR, and MYO5B encodes MYO5B. The full spectra of phenotypes associated with mutations in each gene are discussed, along with our understanding of the disease mechanisms. Differences in treatment response and targets for future treatment are emerging.
Genomic sequencing of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) uncovers a paucity of actionable mutations, underscoring the necessity to exploit epigenetic vulnerabilities for therapeutics. In HCC, EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 represents a major oncogenic chromatin modification, but how it modulates the therapeutic vulnerability of signaling pathways remains unknown. Here, we show EZH2 acts antagonistically to AKT signaling in maintaining H3K27 methylome through epigenetic silencing of IGFBP4. ChIP-seq revealed enrichment of Ezh2/H3K27me3 at silenced loci in HBx-transgenic mouse-derived HCCs, including Igfbp4 whose down-regulation significantly correlated with EZH2 overexpression and poor survivals of HCC patients. Functional characterizations demonstrated potent growth- and invasion-suppressive functions of IGFBP4, which was associated with transcriptomic alterations leading to deregulation of multiple signaling pathways. Mechanistically, IGFBP4 stimulated AKT/EZH2 phosphorylation to abrogate H3K27me3-mediated silencing, forming a reciprocal feedback loop that suppressed core transcription factor networks (FOXA1/HNF1A/HNF4A/KLF9/NR1H4) for normal liver homeostasis. Consequently, the in vivo tumorigenicity of IGFBP4-silenced HCC cells was vulnerable to pharmacological inhibition of EZH2, but not AKT. Our study unveils chromatin regulation of a novel liver tumor suppressor IGFBP4, which constitutes an AKT-EZH2 reciprocal loop in driving H3K27me3-mediated epigenetic reprogramming. Defining the aberrant chromatin landscape of HCC sheds light into the mechanistic basis of effective EZH2-targeted inhibition.
The primary cilia are evolutionarily conserved microtubule-based cellular organelles that perceive metabolic status and thus link the sensory system to cellular signaling pathways. Therefore, ciliogenesis is thought to be tightly linked to autophagy, which is also regulated by nutrient-sensing transcription factors, such as PPARA (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha) and NR1H4/FXR (nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group H, member 4). However, the relationship between these factors and ciliogenesis has not been clearly demonstrated. Here, we present direct evidence for the involvement of macroautophagic/autophagic regulators in controlling ciliogenesis. We showed that activation of PPARA facilitated ciliogenesis independently of cellular nutritional states. Importantly, PPARA-induced ciliogenesis was mediated by controlling autophagy, since either pharmacological or genetic inactivation of autophagy significantly repressed ciliogenesis. Moreover, we showed that pharmacological activator of autophagy, rapamycin, recovered repressed ciliogenesis in ppara-/- cells. Conversely, activation of NR1H4 repressed cilia formation, while knockdown of NR1H4 enhanced ciliogenesis by inducing autophagy. The reciprocal activities of PPARA and NR1H4 in regulating ciliogenesis were highlighted in a condition where de-repressed ciliogenesis by NR1H4 knockdown was further enhanced by PPARA activation. The in vivo roles of PPARA and NR1H4 in regulating ciliogenesis were examined in greater detail in ppara-/- mice. In response to starvation, ciliogenesis was facilitated in wild-type mice via enhanced autophagy in kidney, while ppara-/- mice displayed impaired autophagy and kidney damage resembling ciliopathy. Furthermore, an NR1H4 agonist exacerbated kidney damage associated with starvation in ppara-/- mice. These findings indicate a previously unknown role for PPARA and NR1H4 in regulating the autophagy-ciliogenesis axis in vivo.
Cholesterol levels are strictly regulated to maintain its homeostasis; therefore, if it is not absorbed with the diet, the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway is enhanced and vice versa. Nowadays, the commonly prescribed therapeutic treatments for hypocholesterolemic patients are targeted toward the reduction of both cholesterol intestinal absorption and/or its endogenous biosynthesis. But, when hypercholesterolemia is still moderate the consumption of food products with cholesterol-lowering capacities is more desirable than using drugs. Marketed foods supplemented with hypocholesterolemic compounds are only inhibiting mechanisms for cholesterol absorption (i.e. phytosterols and cereal β-glucans). However, certain fungal extracts obtained from edible mushrooms might be able to modulate cholesterol levels by both strategies, pharmaceutical drugs and functional foods. In vitro and in vivo studies indicated that fungal sterols down-regulated genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis (such as Srebf2 and Nr1h4 (FXR)) and other specific mushroom extracts (β-glucans and other water-soluble compounds) also stimulated transcriptional profiles similar to simvastatin or ezetimibe (two hypocholesterolemic drugs). These and other observations suggested that the hypocholesterolemic effect of mushroom extracts could be due to transcriptional and post-transcriptional modulations besides other indirect effects.
Farnesoid X receptor (FXR, NR1H4) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors. Since the role of FXR in osteoclast differentiation remains ill-defined, we investigated the biological function of FXR on osteoclastogenesis, using FXR-deficient mice. We demonstrated that FXR deficiency increases osteoclast formation in vitro and in vivo. First, FXR deficiency was found to accelerate osteoclast formation via down-regulation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) 1/2 expression. Increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 (PGC-1)β seems to mediate the pro-osteoclastogenic effect of FXR deficiency via the JNK pathway. In addition, we found that FXR deficiency downregulated the expression of interferon-β (IFN-β), a strong inhibitor of osteoclastogenesis, via receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL). We further suggested that interference of IFN-β expression by FXR deficiency impaired the downstream JAK3-STAT1 signaling pathways, which in turn increased osteoclast formation. Finally, FXR deficiency accelerated unloading- or ovariectomy-induced bone loss in vivo. Thus, our findings demonstrate that FXR is a negative modulator in osteoclast differentiation and identify FXR as a potential therapeutic target for postmenopausal osteoporosis and unloading-induced bone loss.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects obesity-associated metabolic syndrome, which exhibits hepatic steatosis, insulin insensitivity and glucose intolerance. Previous studies indicated that hepatic microRNAs (miRs) play critical roles in the development of NAFLD. In this study, we aim to explore the pathophysiological role of miR-194 in obesity-mediated metabolic dysfunction. Our findings show that the high fat diet or palmitic acid treatment significantly increase hepatic miR-194 levels in vivo and in vitro. Silence of miR-194 protects palmitic acid-induced inflammatory response in cultured hepatocytes, and attenuates structural disorders, lipid deposits and inflammatory response in fatty liver. MiR-194 inhibitor also improves glucose and insulin intolerance in obese mice. Through dual luciferase assay, we demonstrate that miR-194 directly binds to FXR/Nr1h4 3'-UTR, and inhibits gene expression of FXR/Nr1h4. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-194 downregulates FXR/Nr1h4 in cultured hepatocytes, but miR-194 inhibitor reversely increases FXR/Nr1h4 expression in obese mouse liver tissues. On the contrast, silence of FXR/Nr1h4 abolishes the hepatic benefits in obese mice treated with miR-194 inhibitor. Present study provides a novel finding that suppression of miR-194 attenuates dietary-induced NAFLD via upregulation of FXR/Nr1h4. The findings suggest miR-194/FXR are potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for NAFLD.
Experimental studies suggest that maternal hypercholesterolemia may be relevant for the early onset of cardiovascular disease in offspring. We investigated the effect of perinatal hypercholesterolemia on the atherosclerosis development in the offspring of apolipoprotein E-deficient mice and the underlying mechanism.
Atherosclerosis and related parameters were studied in adult male or female apolipoprotein E-deficient mice offspring from either normocholesterolemic or hypercholesterolemic mothers and normocholesterolemic fathers. Female born to hypercholesterolemic mothers had more aortic root lesions than female born to normocholesterolemic mothers. Lesions in whole aorta did not differ between groups. Higher trimethylamine-N-oxide levels and Fmo3 hepatic gene expression were higher in female born to hypercholesterolemic mothers offspring compared with female born to normocholesterolemic mothers and male. Trimethylamine-N-oxide levels were correlated with the size of atherosclerotic root lesions. Levels of hepatic cholesterol and gallbladder bile acid were greater in male born to hypercholesterolemic mothers compared with male born to normocholesterolemic mothers. At 18 weeks of age, female born to hypercholesterolemic mothers showed lower hepatic Scarb1 and Cyp7a1 but higher Nr1h4 gene expression compared with female born to normocholesterolemic mothers. Male born to hypercholesterolemic mothers showed an increase in Scarb1 and Ldlr gene expression compared with male born to normocholesterolemic mothers. At 25 weeks of age, female born to hypercholesterolemic mothers had lower Cyp7a1 gene expression compared with female born to normocholesterolemic mothers. DNA methylation of Fmo3, Scarb1, and Ldlr promoter regions was slightly modified and may explain the mRNA expression modulation.
Our findings suggest that maternal hypercholesterolemia may exacerbate the development of atherosclerosis in female offspring by affecting metabolism of trimethylamine-N-oxide and bile acids. These data could be explained by epigenetic alterations.
Eculizumab-treated paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) patients (pts) show a dramatic decrease in serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities and bilirubin concentrations. However, some pts remain hyperbilirubinemic, possibly indicating an inadequate response due to extravascular hemolysis.
Mutation analyses of hepatocanalicular transporter/nuclear receptor variants (ABCB4, ABCB11, ATP8B1, NR1H4) were performed in eight (five of eight males; mean age 38 years [range 26-68 years]) out of the 174 pts with PNH/-clone at our department due to a persistent increase in total bilirubin concentrations (median 3.4 mg/dL; range 2.1-8.1 mg/dL) during chronic eculizumab treatment and normal/or slightly increased serum aminotransferase activities. Median observation time was 70.1 months (range 10.6-135.2 months). All pts were treated according to German PNH guidelines.
Homozygous and heterozygous procholestatic variants in the ABCB4, ABCB11, and ATP8B1 genes were identified in all eight pts. All carried the common ABCB4 c.787A&gt;T polymorphism. The A(TA)7 TAA variant in the UGT1A1 promoter causing Gilbert syndrome was detected in three pts (5/8).
Hyperbilirubinemia in PNH pts treated with eculizumab might not only be due to an insufficient response but rather a combination of mutations in hepatocanalicular transporter variants, Gilbert syndrome, and extravascular hemolysis. Our findings warrant further studies concerning transporter and enzyme variants in PNH to determine their clinical significance.
The transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor-1β (HNF-1β) is essential for normal kidney development and function. Inactivation of HNF-1β in mouse kidney tubules leads to early-onset cyst formation and postnatal lethality. Here, we used Pkhd1/Cre mice to delete HNF-1β specifically in renal collecting ducts (CDs). CD-specific HNF-1β mutant mice survived long term and developed slowly progressive cystic kidney disease, renal fibrosis, and hydronephrosis. Compared with wild-type littermates, HNF-1β mutant mice exhibited polyuria and polydipsia. Before the development of significant renal structural abnormalities, mutant mice exhibited low urine osmolality at baseline and after water restriction and administration of desmopressin. However, mutant and wild-type mice had similar plasma vasopressin and solute excretion levels. HNF-1β mutant kidneys showed increased expression of aquaporin-2 mRNA but mislocalized expression of aquaporin-2 protein in the cytoplasm of CD cells. Mutant kidneys also had decreased expression of the UT-A urea transporter and collectrin, which is involved in apical membrane vesicle trafficking. Treatment of HNF-1β mutant mIMCD3 cells with hypertonic NaCl inhibited the induction of osmoregulated genes, including Nr1h4, which encodes the transcription factor FXR that is required for maximal urinary concentration. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing experiments revealed HNF-1β binding to the Nr1h4 promoter in wild-type kidneys, and immunoblot analysis revealed downregulated expression of FXR in HNF-1β mutant kidneys. These findings reveal a novel role of HNF-1β in osmoregulation and identify multiple mechanisms, whereby mutations of HNF-1β produce defects in urinary concentration.
Control of gene transcription relies on concomitant regulation by multiple transcriptional regulators (TRs). However, how recruitment of a myriad of TRs is orchestrated at cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) to account for coregulation of specific biological pathways is only partially understood. Here, we have used mouse liver CRMs involved in regulatory activities of the hepatic TR, NR1H4 (FXR; farnesoid X receptor), as our model system to tackle this question. Using integrative cistromic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and interactomic analyses, we reveal a logical organization where trans-regulatory modules (TRMs), which consist of subsets of preferentially and coordinately corecruited TRs, assemble into hierarchical combinations at hepatic CRMs. Different combinations of TRMs add to a core TRM, broadly found across the whole landscape of CRMs, to discriminate promoters from enhancers. These combinations also specify distinct sets of CRM differentially organized along the genome and involved in regulation of either housekeeping/cellular maintenance genes or liver-specific functions. In addition to these TRMs which we define as obligatory, we show that facultative TRMs, such as one comprising core circadian TRs, are further recruited to selective subsets of CRMs to modulate their activities. TRMs transcend TR classification into ubiquitous versus liver-identity factors, as well as TR grouping into functional families. Hence, hierarchical superimpositions of obligatory and facultative TRMs bring about independent transcriptional regulatory inputs defining different sets of CRMs with logical connection to regulation of specific gene sets and biological pathways. Altogether, our study reveals novel principles of concerted transcriptional regulation by multiple TRs at CRMs.
Cholesterol over-intake is involved in the onset of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and hepatocellular bile acid (BA) accumulation correlates with liver injuries. However, how dietary cholesterol influences cholesterol and BA kinetics in NASH liver remains ambiguous and needs to be clarified.
Molecular markers involved in cholesterol and BA kinetics were investigated at protein and mRNA levels in an already-established stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive 5/Dmcr rat model with fibrotic steatohepatitis, by feeding a high fat-cholesterol (HFC) diet.
Unlike the control diet, the HFC diet deposited cholesterol greatly in rat livers, where 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and LDL receptor-related protein-1 were expectedly downregulated, especially at 8 and 14 weeks, suggesting that cholesterol synthesis and uptake in response to cholesterol accumulation may not be disorganized. The HFC diet did not upregulate liver X receptor-α, conversely, it enhanced classic BA synthesis by upregulating cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase but downregulating sterol 12α-hydroxylase, and influenced alternative synthesis by downregulating sterol 27-hydroxylase but upregulating oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase, mainly at 8 and 14 weeks, indicating that there were different productions of primary BA species. Unexpectedly, no feedback inhibition of BA synthesis by farnesoid X receptor occurred. Additionally, the HFC diet impaired BA detoxification by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase and sulfotransferase 2A1, and decreased excretion by bile salt export pump at 8 and 14 weeks, although it induced compensatory export by multidrug resistance-associated protein-3. The disturbed BA detoxification may correlate with suppressed pregnane X receptor and constitutive androstane receptor.
The HFC diet may accumulate BA in rat livers, which influences fibrotic steatohepatitis progression.
The present study was to evaluate the cholesterol-lowering effect of two novel plant stanol derivatives and its potential molecular mechanism in hyper-cholesterol mice induced by a high-cholesterol diet. Results showed that oral administration of plant stanyl hemisuccinate (2×, 5×) and plant stanyl sorbitol succinate (2×, 5×) effectively attenuated the serum total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, while had no effect on the serum triacylglycerol and high density lipoprotein cholesterol. And plant stanol derivatives decreased liver cholesterol concentration and increased faecal cholesterol output. Meanwhile, both plant stanyl hemisuccinate and plant stanyl sorbitol succinate could remarkably promote liver X receptor alpha (LXRα) expression, and increased cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) expression and faecal total bile acid output to varying degrees. These results suggested two novel plant stanol derivatives possessed hypocholesterolemic effect, and the cholesterol-lowering action of plant stanol derivatives may be through activating the potential LXRα-CYP7A1-bile acid excretion pathway.
Liver X receptors (Lxrα and Lxrβ) are ligand-dependent nuclear receptors critical for ventral midbrain neurogenesis in vivo. However, no endogenous midbrain Lxr ligand has so far been identified. Here we used LC/MS and functional assays to identify cholic acid as a new Lxr ligand. Moreover, 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol (24,25-EC) was found to be the most potent and abundant Lxr ligand in the developing mouse midbrain. Both Lxr ligands promoted neural development in an Lxr-dependent manner in zebrafish in vivo. Notably, each ligand selectively regulated the development of distinct midbrain neuronal populations. Whereas cholic acid increased survival and neurogenesis of Brn3a-positive red nucleus neurons, 24,25-EC promoted dopaminergic neurogenesis. These results identify an entirely new class of highly selective and cell type-specific regulators of neurogenesis and neuronal survival. Moreover, 24,25-EC promoted dopaminergic differentiation of embryonic stem cells, suggesting that Lxr ligands may thus contribute to the development of cell replacement and regenerative therapies for Parkinson's disease.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, one of the most prevalent liver disorders in Western countries, is characterized by hepatic accumulation of triglycerides. Bile acids have long been known to affect triglyceride homeostasis through a not completely understood mechanism.
To analyse the effects of two different manipulations of bile acid circulation on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
Two animal models of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease were developed by either feeding rats with a choline deficient or with a high fat diet. After 4 weeks, rats were randomized to undergo either bile duct ligation, sham operation or cholic acid administration.
During cholestasis there was an increased CYP7A1 expression, the rate limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis, and a reduction of hepatic concentration of oxysterols, ligands of the liver X receptors. Target genes of the liver X receptors, involved in fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis, were down-regulated in association with decreased hepatic triglyceride content and improvement of fatty liver. Administration of cholic acid, ligand of farnesoid X receptor, also had a beneficial effect on fatty liver in rats on choline deficient diet.
These results indicate that pharmacological approaches increasing the expression of CYP7A1 or stimulating farnesoid X receptor pathway could represent a promising treatment for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
Bile acids, bile alcohols, and hormonal steroids represent the ultimate biologically active products of cholesterol metabolism in vertebrates. However, intermediates in their formation, including oxysterols and cholestenoic acids, also possess known, e.g., as ligands to nuclear and G-protein-coupled receptors, and unknown regulatory activities. The potential diversity of molecules originating from the cholesterol structure is very broad and their abundance in biological materials ranges over several orders of magnitude. Here we describe the application of enzyme-assisted derivatization for sterol analysis (EADSA) in combination with liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry to define the oxysterol and cholestenoic acid metabolomes of human plasma. Quantitative profiling of adult plasma using EADSA leads to the detection of over 30 metabolites derived from cholesterol, some of which are ligands to the nuclear receptors LXR, FXR, and pregnane X receptor or the G-protein-coupled receptor Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 2. The potential of the EADSA technique in screening for inborn errors of cholesterol metabolism and biosynthesis is demonstrated by the unique plasma profile of patients suffering from cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. The analytical methods described are easily adapted to the analysis of other biological fluids, including cerebrospinal fluid, and also tissues, e.g., brain, in which nuclear and G-protein-coupled receptors may have important regulatory roles.
Liver X receptor (LXR)α regulates the genes involved in cholesterol, fatty acid and glucose metabolism. Soy protein (SP) consumption reduces the hepatic accumulation of cholesterol and triacylglycerol, and improves insulin sensitivity. However, it is not known whether these effects are mediated via LXRα. We therefore investigated whether the consumption of SP regulates metabolic changes in cholesterol metabolism and insulin sensitivity via LXRα.
Wild-type (WT) and Lxrα(-/-) (Lxrα, also known as Nr1h3) mice were fed an SP diet with or without cholesterol for 28 days. The expression of LXRα target genes was measured in liver and intestine, as were hepatic lipid content and faecal bile acid concentration. Oral glucose and insulin tolerance tests were also performed. Hepatocytes were used to study the effect of isoflavones on LXR activity.
The livers of WT and Lxrα(-/-) mice fed an SP high-cholesterol diet showed less steatosis than those fed casein. The SP diet increased the expression of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) sub-family genes Abca1, Abcg5 and Abcg8 in the liver and intestine, as well as increasing total faecal bile acid excretion and insulin sensitivity in WT mice compared with mice fed a casein diet. However, these effects of SP were not observed in Lxrα(-/-) mice. The SP isoflavone, genistein, repressed the activation of LXRα target genes by T0901317, whereas it stimulated the activation of LXRβ target genes. The AMP-activated protein kinase inhibitor, compound C, had the opposite effects to those of genistein.
Our results suggest that SP isoflavones stimulate the phosphorylation of LXRα or LXRβ, resulting in different biological effects for each LXR isoform.
Resveratrol (RSV), a naturally occurring polyphenolic stilbenoid, is known to possess potent anti-atherogenic properties; however, the effect of RSV on hypercholesterolemia is not fully understood. We hypothesized that RSV decreases blood cholesterol levels through the activation of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1)-mediated bile acid synthetic pathway pathways in vitro and in vivo.
In this study, we evaluated body weight, serum lipid concentrations, hepatic lipid content and the size of the bile acid pool in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed C57BL/6 J mice that were treated with RSV. In addition, we characterized the underlying mechanism of the effects of RSV in HepG2 hepatocytes by Western blot analysis.
RSV (200 mg/kg per day) reduced body weight and liver weight gains, improved serum lipid parameters, reduced hepatic cholesterol accumulation and increased the bile acid pool size in mice fed an HFD for 8 wks. RSV significantly increased liver expression of CYP7A1 mRNA and protein and CYP7A1 enzyme activity. Furthermore, RSV treatment upregulated CYP7A1 expression and induced liver X receptor alpha (LXRα) activation in a time- and dose-dependent manner in HepG2 cells. In addition, the specific liver X receptor alpha (LXRα) inhibitor geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) inhibited the RSV-induced expression of CYP7A1 in HepG2 hepatocytes.
The beneficial effects of RSV on HFD-induced hypercholesterolemia are mediated through LXRα signaling pathways, suggesting a potential target for the prevention of dyslipidemia.
Although previous studies have shown that consumption of anthocyanin extract from plant foods reduces hypercholesterolemia and the severity of atherosclerosis in different animal models, the mechanisms of these actions remained unclear. This study investigated whether pure anthocyanin inhibit atherosclerosis development and reduce hypercholesterolemia in the apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-deficient mice through enhancement of fecal bile acid excretion, a critical pathway for eliminating circulation cholesterol from the body.
Five-week-old male ApoE-deficient mice were fed the AIN-93G diet supplemented with or without cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside (0.06% w/w) for 12 weeks. Results showed that cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside consumption inhibited the formation of aortic sinus plaque and reduced hypercholesterolemia, along with promoted fecal bile acid excretion and upregulated hepatic cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase expression (CYP7A1). In mouse primary hepatocytes, cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside treatment increased bile acid synthesis and CYP7A1 expression in a liver X receptor alpha (LXRα)-)-dependent manner. Scintillation proximity and time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays revealed that cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside functions as an agonist of LXRα.
Our results indicate that the hypocholesterolemic activity of cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside was, at least in part, mediated by activating the potential LXRα-CYP7A1-bile acid excretion pathway, thus contributing to the antiatherogenic effect of cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside. Importantly, cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside could activate LXRα in an agonist-dependent manner.
Pharmacological LXR activation has anti-atherosclerotic actions in animal models. Part of these beneficial effects may be explained by accelerated reverse cholesterol transport since both plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and fecal neutral sterol secretion are higher upon LXR activation. Mechanisms underlying these LXR-mediated effects have not been fully elucidated.
We investigated the roles of the isoforms LXRα and LXRβ and the HDL cholesterol uptake receptor SR-B1 in modulation of cholesterol metabolism upon treatment of mice with the LXR ligand T0901317.
HDL cholesterol was maximally 60% increased in a time-dependent fashion due to appearance of more and larger HDL particles. Fecal neutral sterol secretion was maximally induced after 1 week treatment. T0901317 treatment induced fecal neutral sterol secretion by ~300% in wild-type but not in Lxrα deficient mice. Surprisingly, LXR activation reduced SR-B1 protein amount in hepatic membranes, suggesting that this might contribute to elevated HDL cholesterol. However, T0901317 still elevated plasma HDL cholesterol in Sr-b1 deficient mice, suggesting that SR-B1 is not the only step involved in LXR-mediated induction of plasma HDL cholesterol. In addition, SR-B1 is not essential for LXR-induced cholesterol removal from the body.
Induction of fecal neutral sterol secretion by T0901317 critically depends on LXRα but not on LXRβ. LXR activation reduces SR-B1 in hepatic membranes, probably partly contributing to elevated HDL cholesterol. SR-B1 is not required to enhance fecal neutral sterol secretion.
Nuclear receptors are integrators of hormonal and nutritional signals, mediating changes to metabolic pathways within the body. Given that modulation of lipid and glucose metabolism has been linked to diseases including type 2 diabetes, obesity and atherosclerosis, a greater understanding of pathways that regulate metabolism in physiology and disease is crucial. The liver X receptors (LXRs) and the farnesoid X receptors (FXRs) are activated by oxysterols and bile acids, respectively. Mounting evidence indicates that these nuclear receptors have essential roles, not only in the regulation of cholesterol and bile acid metabolism but also in the integration of sterol, fatty acid and glucose metabolism.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are members of the nuclear receptor family and are present in two isoforms, α and β, encoded by two separate genes. Originally described in the liver, LXRs have in the last 15 years been implicated in central metabolic pathways, including bile acid synthesis, lipid and glucose homeostasis. Although the vast majority of studies have been performed in non-adipose cells/tissues, results in recent years suggest that LXRs may have important modulatory roles in adipose tissue and adipocytes. Although several authors have published reviews on LXR, there have been no attempts to summarize the effects reported specifically in adipose systems. This overview gives a brief introduction to LXR and describes the sometimes-contradictory results obtained in murine cell systems and in rodent adipose tissue. The so far very limited number of studies performed in human adipocytes and adipose tissue are also presented. It should be apparent that although LXR may impact on several different pathways in metabolism, the clinical role of LXR modulation in adipose tissue is still not clear.
Oxysterols are oxidized 27-carbon cholesterol derivatives or by-products of cholesterol biosynthesis, with a spectrum of biologic activities. Several oxysterols have cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic activities, the ability to interfere with the lateral domain organization, and packing of membrane lipids. These properties may account for their suggested roles in the pathology of diseases such as atherosclerosis, age-onset macular degeneration and Alzheimer's disease. Oxysterols also have the capacity to induce inflammatory responses and play roles in cell differentiation processes. The functions of oxysterols as intermediates in the synthesis of bile acids and steroid hormones, and as readily transportable forms of sterol, are well established. Furthermore, their actions as endogenous regulators of gene expression in lipid metabolism via liver X receptors and the Insig (insulin-induced gene) proteins have been investigated in detail. The cytoplasmic oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) homologues form a group of oxysterol/cholesterol sensors that has recently attracted a lot of attention. However, their mode of action is, as yet, poorly understood. Retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptors (ROR) α and γ, and Epstein-Barr virus induced gene 2 (EBI2) have been identified as novel oxysterol receptors, revealing new physiologic oxysterol effector mechanisms in development, metabolism, and immunity, and evoking enhanced interest in these compounds in the field of biomedicine. 
Both inflammation and cholesterol accumulation play important roles in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. This study was undertaken to investigate whether inflammation aggravated cholesterol accumulation via disrupting hepatic cholesterol export and we explored the underlying mechanisms.
We used casein injection in C57BL/6J mice, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) stimulation in human hepatoblastoma cell line (HepG2) cells to induce inflammation. Intracellular cholesterol level was examined by Oil Red O staining and quantitative analysis. Bile acid level was quantified by colorimetric analysis. (3)[H] cholesterol assay by scintillation counting was performed to evaluate the cholesterol efflux. The mRNA and protein expression was examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot.
Inflammation increased cholesterol accumulation in livers of C57BL/6J mice and in HepG2 cells. High-fat diet in mice and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) loading in HepG2 cells increased bile acid synthesis and cholesterol efflux, enhanced the mRNA and protein expression of liver X receptor α (LXRα), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARα, γ), cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). However, inflammation reduced bile acid synthesis and cholesterol efflux even in high-fat-diet-fed mice and HepG2 cells in the presence of LDL loading. The enhanced effects of these genes and proteins expression due to high-fat diet and LDL loading were inhibited by inflammation both in vivo and in vitro.
Inflammation disrupted PPAR-LXR-CYP7A1/ABCA1-mediated bile acid synthesis and cholesterol efflux resulting in exacerbated cholesterol accumulation in livers of C57BL/6J mice and HepG2 cells.
It has been previously observed that low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout (LDLR--/--) mice fed a Western-type diet without cholate and given the liver X receptor agonist T1317 develop a persistent and enhanced hypertriglyceridemia. In contrast, LDLR--/-- mice fed a Paigen diet with cholate exhibit only a transient increase in plasma triglycerides when given T1317. Cholate as an activator of farnesoid X receptor may attenuate T1317-induced triglyceridemia. To determine if cholate was responsible for this transient nature of the hypertriglyceridemia, we orally administered T1317 to LDLR--/-- mice fed a modified Paigen diet without cholate. T1317 transiently elevated plasma triglycerides by increasing plasma very-low-density lipoprotein. Cholesterol and triglyceride levels in plasma very-low-density lipoprotein in T1317-treated mice decreased from peak levels to levels found in vehicle-treated mice after 8 weeks of treatment. A gradual decline of hepatic cholesterol and a transient increase in hepatic triglycerides were also observed in T1317-treated mice. T1317 only transiently activated the expression of genes related to liver de novo lipogenesis, whereas genes related to lipid metabolism were induced in T1317-treated mice, including a gradual increase in plasma lipoprotein lipase activity. Atheroprotective effects of T1317 were observed in the innominate artery and aortic arch but not in the aortic sinus. This work indicates that some component(s) in the Paigen diet other than cholate affect the T1317-induced gene expression profile and ameliorate its effects on lipid synthesis, which lead to hypertriglyceridemia and fatty liver. These findings are important for liver X receptor-related pharmaceutical development for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.
Nuclear receptors (NRs) are ligand-activated transcription factors that are important to life by regulating a wide variety of physiological and pathological functions. There are three classes of NRs defined by ligands and heterodimer partners. The Class II NRs are involved in a broad range of pathophysiological functions in the liver, including cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis; lipid and glucose metabolism; inflammation; liver regeneration and hepatocellular carcinogenesis. Due to highly complicated molecular mechanisms in the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), HCC is still one of the most common malignancies in the world. Given the pivotal functions of the Class II NRs in the liver, the roles of these NRs in hepatocellular carcinogenesis are emerging. This review summarizes the roles of Class II NRs in liver carcinogenesis and their potential application in the prevention and treatment of HCC.
Global prevalence of Western-type diet has increased in the last decades resulting in occurrence of certain chronic diseases. This type of diet is also linked to high-cholesterol intake and increase in blood cholesterol. Many of the molecular mechanisms of dealing with increased levels of cholesterol and its metabolites have been elucidated in animal models and humans. It is also evident that cholesterol metabolism is closely connected to drug metabolism. Cholesterol/bile acids and drugs share many transporters, enzymes and regulatory proteins which are key points in the crosstalk.
This review presents an overview of the effect of cholesterol and its metabolites on drug metabolism with special emphasis on species-specific differences. The article focuses on the role of nuclear receptors farnesoid X receptor, vitamin D receptor and liver X receptor in the regulation of drug metabolism genes and the role of cholesterol biosynthesis intermediates, oxysterols and bile acids in the induction of drug metabolism through pregnane X receptor.
Studies show that the regulation of drug metabolism by sterols is multileveled. Many species-dependent differences were observed which hinder the transfer of findings from model animals to humans. As of now, there is little evidence available for cholesterol impact on drug metabolism in vivo in humans. There is also the need to confirm the results obtained in animal models and in vitro analyses in human cells but this is very difficult given the current lack of tools.
As a signaling molecule with system endocrine function, UDCA improves insulin sensitivity by activating the nuclear farnezoid X-receptor; as a ligand for the TGR5/Gpbar-1 receptor, UDCA is able to stimulate the secretion of GLP-1. UDCA ameliorate of the anti-oxidative defenses in NAFLD, normalizes NAD+/NADH ratio, beta-oxidation. UDCA improves the liver biochemical and histological picture in NASH, also reduces hepatocytes apoptosis and restores adiponectin levels; in other studies, these data are not confirmed. In the experiment, UDCA prevents the development of steatosis in the liver. UDCA may increase efficiency in combination with statins, thiazolidinediones, vitamin E. Further controlled prospective trials are needed for research of the UDCA effect in NAFLD.
High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) protect against atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, mainly by promoting reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). Biliary sterol secretion supposedly represents the final step in RCT, but the relevance of this pathway has not been explored. We tested the dependency of RCT on functional biliary sterol secretion.
Macrophage-to-feces RCT was studied in mice with abolished (bile duct ligation) or decreased biliary sterol secretion (adenosine triphosphate binding cassette transporter B4 (Abcb4)-/- mice, with and without administration of a liver X receptor [LXR] agonist) after intraperitoneal injection of (3)H-cholesterol-loaded primary macrophage foam cells from mice. Fecal tracer excretion and also fecal mass sterol excretion were measured. Metabolism and tissue uptake of HDL cholesteryl ester was assessed with HDL kinetic studies.
Bile-duct ligation completely abolished RCT from (3)H-cholesterol-loaded macrophages to feces (P &lt; .001). In Abcb4-/- mice lacking biliary cholesterol secretion, RCT was decreased markedly; fecal (3)H-tracer excretion was almost absent within neutral sterols (P &lt; .001) and reduced within bile acids (P &lt; .05). LXR activation stimulated RCT in wild-type (5.5-fold; P &lt; .001) but not Abcb4-/- mice, whereas mass fecal sterol excretion increased similarly in both models (P &lt; .05). Kinetic studies revealed minimal uptake of HDL cholesteryl ester by the intestine, which decreased on LXR activation (P &lt; .05).
Functional RCT depends on biliary sterol secretion; there is no compensatory increase in RCT via bile acids. The stimulating effect of LXR agonists on RCT requires biliary cholesterol secretion. These results have implications for therapies against atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease targeting the RCT pathway.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) promote macrophage reverse cholesterol transport and cholesterol excretion from the body. The synthetic LXR ligands T0901317 and GW3965 were shown to significantly inhibit atherosclerosis in mice and to increase the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) in the atherosclerotic lesions. However, these compounds increase plasma and hepatic triglyceride (TG) levels in mice. Methyl-3β-hydroxy-5α,6α-epoxycholanate (MHEC), synthesized from hyodeoxycholic acid, functions as an LXR agonist, but its role in atherogenesis and lipid metabolism remained to be elucidated.
THP-1-derived macrophages were cultured in the medium con- taining various concentrations of MHEC or T0901317 (0-10 μmol/l) for 24 h. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify LXRα, LXRβ and ABCA1 mRNA levels in macrophages. Additionally, MHEC or T0901317 was orally administered at 10 mg/kg daily for 6 weeks in apolipoprotein E knockout (apoE⁻/⁻) mice fed a high-cholesterol diet. Plasma lipids were determined enzymatically. The area of and ABCA1 expression in the aortic atherosclerotic lesions were measured by oil red O staining and immunohistochemistry, respectively.
Both MHEC and T0901317 equally stimulated LXRα and ABCA1 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner in THP-1-derived macrophages, but they did not induce LXRβ mRNA expression significantly. The plasma levels of total cholesterol, TG and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly higher in T0901317-treated mice than in the vehicle-treated control group. Interestingly, MHEC treatment dramatically increased plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol without altering plasma levels of total cholesterol and TG. Both MHEC and T0901317 equally inhibited the development of atherosclerotic lesions in apoE⁻/⁻ mice. The expression of ABCA1, a cholesterol efflux transporter, was greatly induced by the two LXR agonists in the artery wall.
MHEC is a novel LXR agonist and it inhibits atherosclerosis in apoE⁻/⁻ mice without raising blood TG. Thus, MHEC relative to T0901317 may be a better therapeutic LXR agonist for the treatment of atherosclerosis.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are members of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors. They play a crucial role in lipid metabolism processes such as bile acid and fatty acid synthesis, as well as minor or limited roles in the regulation of cholesterol synthesis and uptake in mammals. In avian species, however, little is known about the role of LXRs except for the fact that they are involved in the stimulation of fatty acid synthesis. In this study, we characterize the expression profile of genes related to bile acid, cholesterol, and fatty acid synthesis and VLDL secretion in chicken primary hepatocytes treated with T0901317, a synthetic agonist of LXR. The activity of chicken cholesterol 7α hydroxylase (CYP7A1), a key enzyme in bile acid synthesis, mRNA expression, and bile acid excretion, was stimulated by supplementation of the culture medium with a low concentration (0.01 μM) of T0901317. In contrast, the levels of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-1, fatty acid synthase mRNA, and VLDL-triacylglycerol in cells cultured in the presence of a high concentration (10 μM) of T0901317 were higher than those cultured in zero or low concentrations of T0901317. These results suggest that cellular responses to this LXR agonist were similar to those present in mammals. A novel finding of this study concerned changes to the regulation of cholesterol synthesis and uptake in chicken hepatocytes treated with T0901317. Levels of SREBP-2,3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) mRNA expression increased as a function of increasing T0901317 (up to 1.0 μM), but remained similar to those in cells cultured under control conditions when the concentration of T0901317 was increased to 10 μM. These results suggest that LXRs play an important role in cholesterol synthesis and uptake in chicken hepatocytes and, as such, differ to findings in mammals where the effect of LXR agonists on cholesterol synthesis plays only a minor role in the regulation of cellular sterol homeostasis.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are nuclear receptors that play a major role in the expression of genes which are involved in lipid metabolism. LXRs are part of the superfamily of steroid receptors that work to deliver metabolic signals on the transcriptional level to either suppress or activate target genes. LXRs, once ligand-activated, work by forming heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor, after which they act as transcription factors by binding to the promoter region of deoxyribonucleic acid sequences, thereby affecting gene expression. Specifically, LXR has been shown to be involved with genes that help in the modulation of lipid metabolism, therein having a significant effect on the development or propagation of atherosclerosis. This review paper will discuss the overall function of LXRs and their role in lipid metabolism, and will help identify possible therapeutic modulators of LXRs that can be used for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis.
Organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) is a liver-enriched transporter involved in the hepatocellular uptake of many endogenous molecules and several structurally divergent drugs in clinical use. Although OATP1B1 coding region polymorphisms are known to make an impact on substrate drug disposition in humans, little is known regarding the mechanisms underlying the transcriptional regulation of this transporter. In this study, we note that messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of OATP1B1 in a large human liver bank exhibited marked interindividual variability that was not associated with coding region polymorphisms. Accordingly, we hypothesized that such variability in expression is reflective of nuclear receptor-mediated transcriptional regulation of this transporter. We tested prototypical ligands for the nuclear receptors pregnane X receptor (PXR), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), liver X receptor (LXR) α, and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in a human hepatoma-derived cell line and noted induction of OATP1B1 mRNA when the cells were treated with LXRα or FXR ligands. To confirm a direct role for LXRα and FXR to OATP1B1 expression, we performed detailed promoter analysis and cell-based reporter gene assays resulting in the identification of two functional FXR response elements and one LXRα response element. The direct interaction between nuclear receptors with the identified response elements was assessed using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Using isolated primary human hepatocytes, we show that LXRα or FXR agonists, but not PXR or CAR agonists, are capable of OATP1B1 induction.
We note that OATP1B1 transcriptional regulation is under dual nuclear receptor control through the oxysterol sensing LXRα and the bile acid sensor FXR. Accordingly, the interplay between OATP1B1 and nuclear receptors may play an important and heretofore unrecognized role during cholestasis, drug-induced liver injury, and OATP1B1 induction-related drug interactions.
Cholesterol and other cholesterol related metabolites, oxysterols, and bile acids, establish specific interactions with enzymes and other proteins involved in cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis, triggering a variety of biological responses. The substrate-enzyme binding represents the best-characterized type of complementary interaction between proteins and small molecules. Key enzymes in the pathway that converts cholesterol to bile acids belong to the cytochrome P450 superfamily. In contrast to the majority of P450 enzymes, those acting on cholesterol and related metabolites exhibit higher stringency with respect to substrate molecules. This stringency, coupled with the specificity of the reactions, dictates the chemical features of intermediate metabolites (oxysterols) and end products (bile acids). Both oxysterols and bile acids have emerged in recent years as new signalling molecules due to their ability to interact and activate nuclear receptors, and consequently to regulate the transcription of genes involved in cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis and metabolism, but also in glucose and fatty acid metabolism. Interestingly, other proteins function as bile acid or sterol receptors. New findings indicate that bile acids also interact with a membrane G protein-coupled receptor, triggering a signalling cascade that ultimately promote energy expenditure. On the other end, cholesterol and side chain oxysterols establish specific interactions with different proteins residing in the endoplasmic reticulum that result in controlled protein degradation and/or trafficking to the Golgi and the nucleus. These regulatory pathways converge and contribute to adapt cholesterol uptake and synthesis to the cellular needs.
Interest in grape seed proanthocyanidin (GSP) as a cholesterol-lowering nutraceutical is growing. This study was to investigate the effect of GSP on blood cholesterol level and gene expression of cholesterol-regulating enzymes in Golden Syrian hamsters maintained on a 0.1% cholesterol diet. Results affirmed supplementation of 0.5% or 1.0% GSP could decrease plasma total cholesterol and triacylglycerol level. Western blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses demonstrated GSP did not affect sterol regulatory element binding protein-2 and low-density lipoprotein receptor; however, it increased mRNA 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. GSP had no effect on the protein mass of liver X receptor alpha (LXRα) but it decreased mRNA LXRα. Most importantly, GSP increased not only the protein level of cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) but also mRNA CYP7A1. It was concluded that the hypocholesterolemic activity of GSP was most likely mediated by enhancement of bile acid excretion and up-regulation of CYP7A1.
Diabetes is characterized by high blood glucose levels and dyslipidemia. Bile salt sequestration has been found to improve both plasma glycemic control and cholesterol profiles in diabetic patients. Yet bile salt sequestration is also known to affect triglyceride (TG) metabolism, possibly through signaling pathways involving farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha). We quantitatively assessed kinetic parameters of bile salt metabolism in lean C57Bl/6J and in obese, diabetic db/db mice upon bile salt sequestration using colesevelam HCl (2% wt/wt in diet) and related these to quantitative changes in hepatic lipid metabolism. As expected, bile salt sequestration reduced intestinal bile salt reabsorption. Importantly, bile salt pool size and biliary bile salt secretion remained unchanged upon sequestrant treatment due to compensation by de novo bile salt synthesis in both models. Nevertheless, lean and db/db mice showed increased, mainly periportally confined, hepatic TG contents, increased expression of lipogenic genes, and increased fractional contributions of newly synthesized fatty acids. Lipogenic gene expression was not induced in sequestrant-treated Fxr(-/-) and Lxralpha(-/-) mice compared with wild-type littermates, in line with reports indicating a regulatory role of FXR and LXRalpha in bile salt-mediated regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism.
Bile salt sequestration by colesevelam induces the lipogenic pathway in an FXR- and LXRalpha-dependent manner without affecting the total pool size of bile salts in mice. We speculate that a shift from intestinal reabsorption to de novo synthesis as source of bile salts upon bile salt sequestration affects zonation of metabolic processes within the liver acinus.
In this study we have profiled the free sterol content of cerebrospinal fluid by a combination of charge tagging and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Surprisingly, the most abundant cholesterol metabolites were found to be C(27) and C(24) intermediates of the bile acid biosynthetic pathways with structures corresponding to 7alpha-hydroxy-3-oxocholest-4-en-26-oic acid (7.170 +/- 2.826 ng/ml, mean +/- S.D., six subjects), 3beta-hydroxycholest-5-en-26-oic acid (0.416 +/- 0.193 ng/ml), 7alpha,x-dihydroxy-3-oxocholest-4-en-26-oic acid (1.330 +/- 0.543 ng/ml), and 7alpha-hydroxy-3-oxochol-4-en-24-oic acid (0.172 +/- 0.085 ng/ml), and the C(26) sterol 7alpha-hydroxy-26-norcholest-4-ene-3,x-dione (0.204 +/- 0.083 ng/ml), where x is an oxygen atom either on the CD rings or more likely on the C-17 side chain. The ability of intermediates of the bile acid biosynthetic pathways to activate the liver X receptors (LXRs) and the farnesoid X receptor was also evaluated. The acidic cholesterol metabolites 3beta-hydroxycholest-5-en-26-oic acid and 3beta,7alpha-dihydroxycholest-5-en-26-oic acid were found to activate LXR in a luciferase assay, but the major metabolite identified in this study, i.e. 7alpha-hydroxy-3-oxocholest-4-en-26-oic acid, was not an LXR ligand. 7Alpha-hydroxy-3-oxocholest-4-en-26-oic acid is formed from 3beta,7alpha-dihydroxycholest-5-en-26-oic acid in a reaction catalyzed by 3beta-hydroxy-Delta(5)-C(27)-steroid dehydrogenase (HSD3B7), which may thus represent a deactivation pathway of LXR ligands in brain. Significantly, LXR activation has been found to reduce the symptoms of Alzheimer disease (Fan, J., Donkin, J., and Wellington C. (2009) Biofactors 35, 239-248); thus, cholesterol metabolites may play an important role in the etiology of Alzheimer disease.
Liver X receptor (LXR) activation promotes reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) in rodents but has major side effects (increased triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol levels) in species expressing cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP). In the face of dyslipidemia, it remains unclear whether LXR activation stimulates RCT in CETP species. We therefore used a hamster model made dyslipidemic with a 0.3% cholesterol diet and treated with vehicle or LXR agonist GW3965 (30 mg/kg bid) over 10 days. To investigate RCT, radiolabeled (3)H-cholesterol macrophages or (3)H-cholesteryl oleate-HDL were then injected to measure plasma and feces radioactivity over 72 or 48 h, respectively. The cholesterol-enriched diet increased VLDL-triglycerides and total cholesterol levels in all lipoprotein fractions and strongly increased liver lipids. Overall, GW3965 failed to improve both dyslipidemia and liver steatosis. However, after (3)H-cholesterol labeled macrophage injection, GW3965 treatment significantly increased the (3)H-tracer appearance by 30% in plasma over 72 h, while fecal (3)H-cholesterol excretion increased by 156% (P &lt; 0.001). After (3)H-cholesteryl oleate-HDL injection, GW3965 increased HDL-derived cholesterol fecal excretion by 64% (P &lt; 0.01 vs. vehicle), while plasma fractional catabolic rate remained unchanged. Despite no beneficial effect on dyslipidemia, LXR activation promotes macrophage-to-feces RCT in dyslipidemic hamsters. These results emphasize the use of species with a more human-like lipoprotein metabolism for drug profiling.
To investigate the hypocholesterolemic activity of red yeast rice (RYR) and its underlying mechanism.
Three groups of hamsters were fed either the control diet or one of the two experimental diets containing by weight 0.1% RYR (0.1RYR) or 0.3% RYR (0.3RYR). Blood (0.5 mL) was collected from the retro-orbital sinus into a heparinized capillary tube at the end of week 0, 3, and 6. Plasma lipoproteins were measured using enzymatic kits, while fecal neutral and acidic sterols were quantified using a gas-liquid chromatography.
Plasma total cholesterol was reduced by 12% in 0.1RYR group and by 18% in 0.3RYR group compared with the control value. Similarly, plasma triacylglycerol was decreased by 11% in 0.1RYR group and by 24% in 0.3RYR group. Western blotting analysis demonstrated that RYR had no effect on sterol regulatory element binding protein 2, liver X receptor, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutary-CoA reductase, LDL receptor, and cholesterol-7alpha-hydroxylase. HPLC analysis confirmed that RYR contained 0.88% monacolin K. It was recently found that RYR supplementation increased excretion of fecal acidic sterols by 3-4 folds compared with the control value.
Hypocholesterolemic activity of RYR is mediated at least partially by enhancement of acidic sterol excretion.
Recent investigations indicate that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is closely associated with hepatocytic lipid metabolism and induces hepatic steatosis. However, the actual lipid metabolism in HCV-infected liver has not been extensively investigated in humans. In this study, we evaluated the expression of lipid metabolism-associated genes in patients with HCV infection by real-time PCR. Sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-2 expression was unchanged and low density lipoprotein receptor expression was markedly reduced by 90% in HCV-infected liver. The expression of apolipoprotein B100, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein and ATP-binding cassette G5 was significantly increased. Up-regulation of cholesterol synthesis-associated genes, including HMG-CoA reductase, HMG-CoA synthase, farnesyl-diphosphate synthase and squalene synthase, confirmed enhanced de novo cholesterol synthesis. The expression of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase and farnesoid X receptor was enhanced, while bile salt export pump expression was unchanged. Fatty acid synthase expression was increased which was accompanied by increased expression of liver X receptor alpha and SREBP-1c. In summary, the regulation of lipid metabolism was impaired and cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis continued to increase without negative feedback in HCV-infected liver. These changes may be beneficial for HCV replication.
In mammals, many aspects of behavior and physiology, and in particular cellular metabolism, are coordinated by the circadian timing system. Molecular clocks are thought to rely on negative feedback loops in clock gene expression that engender oscillations in the accumulation of transcriptional regulatory proteins, such as the orphan receptor REV-ERBalpha. Circadian transcription factors then drive daily rhythms in the expression of clock-controlled output genes, for example genes encoding enzymes and regulators of cellular metabolism. To gain insight into clock output functions of REV-ERBalpha, we carried out genome-wide transcriptome profiling experiments with liver RNA from wild-type mice, Rev-erbalpha knock-out mice, or REV-ERBalpha overexpressing mice. On the basis of these genetic loss- and gain-of-function experiments, we concluded that REV-ERBalpha participates in the circadian modulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) activity, and thereby in the daily expression of SREBP target genes involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism. This control is exerted via the cyclic transcription of Insig2, encoding a trans-membrane protein that sequesters SREBP proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum membranes and thereby interferes with the proteolytic activation of SREBPs in Golgi membranes. REV-ERBalpha also participates in the cyclic expression of cholesterol-7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the rate-limiting enzyme in converting cholesterol to bile acids. Our findings suggest that this control acts via the stimulation of LXR nuclear receptors by cyclically produced oxysterols. In conclusion, our study suggests that rhythmic cholesterol and bile acid metabolism is not just driven by alternating feeding-fasting cycles, but also by REV-ERBalpha, a component of the circadian clockwork circuitry.
Because dyslipidemia, such as hypercholesterolemia, is a characteristic of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), hepatic lipid metabolism may be disturbed in PBC patients. We examined the expression of lipid metabolism-associated genes in PBC liver.
All of the patients examined were in stage I or II PBC and without medication. RNA was isolated from liver specimens by needle biopsies of PBC patients and controls. The expression levels of various genes were measured by real-time RT-PCR. Multidrug resistance 3 (MDR3) expression was examined immunohistochemically. Statistical correlations between the gene expression levels and indices of blood testing were calculated.
The expression levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) 2 and LDL receptor were significantly lower, and those of apolipoprotein B, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, ATP-binding cassette G5, and liver X receptor α (LXRα) were significantly higher in the PBC liver than in the normal control liver. The expression levels of bile acid synthesis- and excretion-associated genes did not change, and those of farnesoid X receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α, and SREBP-1c were similar between the PBC and normal liver. MDR3 gene expression levels in the PBC liver were more than 4-fold higher than those in the control liver. Immunohistochemically, strong canalicular staining for MDR3 was observed in the PBC liver. LXRα expression was positively correlated with MDR3 levels. Serum levels of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and IgM were negatively correlated with MDR3 levels.
Hepatocellular cholesterol metabolism was at least partially disturbed, even in the early stage of PBC. The most characteristic finding was a distinct elevation of MDR3 expression, and the MDR3 levels were negatively correlated with GGT and IgM levels.
Scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) mediates selective uptake of cholesterol from high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles by the liver and influences biliary cholesterol secretion. However, it is not clear, if this effect is direct or indirect. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of SR-BI on biliary cholesterol secretion, especially in a functional context with ATP-binding cassette transporter g5 (Abcg5)/Abcg8 and Abcb4. SR-BI was overexpressed by means of adenovirus (AdSR-BI) in livers of wild-type, liver X receptor-null (Lxr(-/-)), Abcg5(-/-), and Abcb4(-/-) mice. Consistent with previous reports, AdSR-BI decreased plasma HDL cholesterol levels in all models (P &lt; 0.001). Hepatic cholesterol content increased (at least P &lt; 0.05), whereas expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 target genes was decreased (at least P &lt; 0.05,) and established Lxr target genes were unaltered. Biliary cholesterol secretion was increased by AdSR-BI in wild-type as well as in Lxr(-/-) and Abcg5(-/-) mice, and considerably less in Abcb4(-/-) mice (each P &lt; 0.001), independent of bile acid and phospholipid secretion. Immunogold electron microscopy and western blot showed a substantial increase of SR-BI protein localized to basolateral and canalicular membranes in response to SR-BI overexpression. Subcellular fractionation revealed a significantly higher cholesterol content of canalicular membranes (P &lt; 0.001) upon SR-BI overexpression. Inhibition of microtubule function did not affect SR-BI-mediated biliary cholesterol secretion, indicating that transcytosis pathways are not involved.
Our data indicate that SR-BI mediates biliary cholesterol secretion independent of Abcg5, yet largely depends on Abcb4-mediated phospholipid secretion and mixed micelles as acceptors in bile. SR-BI-mediated biliary cholesterol secretion has a high capacity, can compensate for the absence of Abcg5, and does not require transcytosis pathways.
High density lipoprotein cholesterol is thought to represent a preferred source of sterols secreted into bile following hepatic uptake by scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI). The present study aimed to determine the metabolic effects of an endothelial lipase (EL)-mediated stimulation of HDL cholesterol uptake on liver lipid metabolism and biliary cholesterol secretion in wild-type, SR-BI knockout, and SR-BI overexpressing mice. In each model, injection of an EL expressing adenovirus decreased plasma HDL cholesterol (P &lt; 0.001) whereas hepatic cholesterol content increased (P &lt; 0.05), translating into decreased expression of sterol-regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP2) and its target genes HMG-CoA reductase and LDL receptor (each P &lt; 0.01). Biliary cholesterol secretion was dependent on hepatic SR-BI expression, being decreased in SR-BI knockouts (P &lt; 0.001) and increased following hepatic SR-BI overexpression (P &lt; 0.001). However, in each model, biliary secretion of cholesterol, bile acids, and phospholipids as well as fecal bile acid and neutral sterol content, remained unchanged in response to EL overexpression. Importantly, hepatic ABCG5/G8 expression did not correlate with biliary cholesterol secretion rates under these conditions. These results demonstrate that an acute decrease of plasma HDL cholesterol levels by overexpressing EL increases hepatic cholesterol content but leaves biliary sterol secretion unaltered. Instead, biliary cholesterol secretion rates are related to the hepatic expression level of SR-BI. These data stress the importance of SR-BI for biliary cholesterol secretion and might have relevance for concepts of reverse cholesterol transport.
Bile acids subserve important physiological functions in the control of cholesterol homeostasis. Indeed, hepatic bile acid synthesis and biliary excretion constitute the main route for cholesterol removal from the human body. On the other hand, bile acids serve as natural detergents for the intestinal absorption of dietary cholesterol. However, due to their detergent properties, bile acids are inherently cytotoxic, and their cellular level may be tightly controlled to avoid pathological situations such as cholestasis. Recent investigations have illustrated the crucial roles that a series of ligand-activated transcription factors has in the control of hepatic bile acids synthesis, transport and metabolism. Thus, the lipid-activated nuclear receptors, farnesoid X-receptor (FXR), liver X-receptor (LXR), pregnane X-receptor (PXR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha), modulate the expression and activity of genes controlling bile acid homeostasis in the liver. Several members of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes family are among the bile acid metabolizing enzymes regulated by these receptors. UGTs catalyze glucuronidation, a major phase II metabolic reaction, which converts hydrophobic bile acids into polar and urinary excretable metabolites. This article summarizes our recent observations on the regulation of bile acid conjugating UGTs upon pharmacological activation of lipid-activated receptors, with a particular interest for the role of PPAR alpha and LXRalpha in controlling human UGT1A3 expression.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are nuclear receptors that play a crucial role in regulating the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism. Ligand activation of LXRs improves cholesterol homeostasis via multiple coordinated effects, and this function is likely to explain in part the protective effects of LXR activation on atherosclerosis reported in animal models. However, LXR activation may also induce undesirable side effects, such as lipogenesis and hypertriglyceridemia. This review discusses the potential to develop LXR modulators as therapeutic agents for atherosclerosis.
Liver X receptors, LXRalpha and LXRbeta, are nuclear receptors belonging to the large family of transcription factors. After activation by oxysterols, LXRs play a central role in the control of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism as well as inflammation. The role of LXRalpha has been extensively studied, particularly in the liver and macrophages. In the liver it prevents cholesterol accumulation by increasing bile acid synthesis and secretion into the bile through ATP-binding cassette G5/G8 transporters, whereas in macrophages it increases cholesterol reverse transport. The function of LXRbeta is still under investigation with most of the current knowledge coming from the study of phenotypes of LXRbeta-/- mice. With these mice new emerging roles for LXRbeta have been demonstrated in the pathogenesis of diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and chronic pancreatitis. The present review will focus on the abnormalities described so far in LXRbeta-/- mice and the insight gained into the possible roles of LXRbeta in human diseases.
Increased dietary fat consumption is associated with colon cancer development. The exact mechanism by which fat induces colon cancer is not clear, however, increased bile acid excretion in response to high-fat diet may promote colon carcinogenesis. The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, and bile acids are endogenous ligands of FXR. FXR is highly expressed in the intestine and liver where FXR is essential for maintaining bile acid homeostasis. The role of FXR in intestine cancer development is not known. The current study evaluated the effects of FXR deficiency in mice on intestinal cell proliferation and cancer development. The results showed that FXR deficiency resulted in increased colon cell proliferation, which was accompanied by an up-regulation in the expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression and inflammation, including cyclin D1 and interleukin-6. Most importantly, FXR deficiency led to an increase in the size of small intestine adenocarcinomas in adenomatous polyposis coli mutant mice. Furthermore, after treatment with a colon carcinogen, azoxymethane, FXR deficiency increased the adenocarcinoma multiplicity and size in colon and rectum of C57BL/6 mice. Loss of FXR function also increased the intestinal lymphoid nodule numbers in the intestine. Taken together, the current study is the first to show that FXR deficiency promotes cell proliferation, inflammation, and tumorigenesis in the intestine, suggesting that activation of FXR by nonbile acid ligands may protect against intestinal carcinogenesis.
In primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), pathogenesis is influenced by genetic factors that remain poorly elucidated up to now. We investigated the impact of sequence diversity in candidate genes involved in immunity (CTLA-4 and TNFalpha), in bile formation (10 hepatobiliary transporter genes) and in the adaptative response to cholestasis (three nuclear receptor genes) on the susceptibility and severity of PBC.
A total of 42 Ht SNPs were identified and compared in 258 PBC patients and two independent groups of 286 and 269 healthy controls. All participants were white continental individuals with French ancestry.
Ht SNPs of CTLA-4 and TNFalpha genes were significantly associated with susceptibility to PBC. The progression rate of liver disease under ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) therapy was significantly linked to SNPs of TNFalpha and SLC4A2/anion exchanger 2 (AE2) genes. A multivariate Cox regression analysis including clinical and biochemical parameters showed that SLC4A2/AE2 variant was an independent prognostic factor.
These data point to a primary role of genes encoding regulators of the immune system in the susceptibility to PBC. They also demonstrate that allelic variations in TNFalpha and SLC4A2/AE2 have a significant impact on the evolutive profile of PBC under UDCA therapy.
The G2A receptor is a member of the ovarian cancer G protein-coupled receptor 1 family of stress-inducible G protein-coupled receptors. In this study, we examined the hepatobiliary effects of loss of function of G2A in mice fed either a chow or lithogenic diet. G2A-deficient (G2A(-/-)) mice fed chow had a 25% reduction in biliary phosphatidylcholine content, reduced hepatic gene expression of the phosphatidylcholine transporter adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette B4, and an 8-fold increase in expression of the nuclear receptor liver X receptor (LXR). Despite the increased expression of LXR, transcription of several LXR target genes was reduced. G2A(-/-) mice fed a lithogenic diet had rapid gallstone formation, an increased cholesterol saturation index, a 2.5-fold increase in farnesoid X receptor expression, a 5-fold increase in LXR expression, and a 90% reduction in cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase expression in comparison with wild-type mice. There were no changes in gallbladder volume.
These data demonstrate that the G2A receptor is important for hepatobiliary bile salt, cholesterol, and phospholipid homeostasis and for the pathogenesis of cholesterol gallstone formation.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are important regulators of cholesterol and lipid metabolism. LXR agonists have been shown to limit the cellular cholesterol content by inducing reverse cholesterol transport, increasing bile acid production, and inhibiting intestinal cholesterol absorption. Most of them, however, also increase lipogenesis via sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP1c) and carbohydrate response element-binding protein activation resulting in hypertriglyceridemia and liver steatosis. We report on the antiatherogenic properties of the steroidal liver X receptor agonist N,N-dimethyl-3beta-hydroxy-cholenamide (DMHCA) in apolipoprotein E (apoE)-deficient mice. Long-term administration of DMHCA (11 weeks) significantly reduced lesion formation in male and female apoE-null mice. Notably, DMHCA neither increased hepatic triglyceride (TG) levels in male nor female apoE-deficient mice. ATP binding cassette transporter A1 and G1 and cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase mRNA abundances were increased, whereas SREBP1c mRNA expression was unchanged in liver, and even decreased in macrophages and intestine. Short-term treatment revealed even higher changes on mRNA regulation. Our data provide evidence that DMHCA is a strong candidate as therapeutic agent for the treatment or prevention of atherosclerosis, circumventing the negative side effects of other LXR agonists.
Bile acid binding resin (BAR) improves glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Although the mechanism is hypothesised to involve the clearance of excess hepatic triglyceride, this hypothesis has not been examined in appropriately designed studies. Therefore, we investigated whether reduced hepatic triglyceride deposition is involved in BAR-mediated improvements in glycaemic control in spontaneous fatty liver diabetic mice without dietary interventions.
Male 6-week-old fatty liver Shionogi (FLS) mice were fed a standard diet without or with 1.5% BAR (colestilan) for 6 weeks. Glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, hepatic lipid content, and gene expression were assessed. A liver X receptor (LXR) agonist was also administered to activate the LXR pathway. We also retrospectively analysed the medical records of 21 outpatients with type 2 diabetes who were treated with colestilan for ≥6 months.
BAR enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in FLS mice without altering fat mass. BAR improved hepatic insulin sensitivity, increased IRS2 expression, and decreased SREBP expression. BAR reduced hepatic cholesterol levels but not hepatic triglyceride levels. BAR also reduced the expression of LXR target genes, and LXR activation abolished the BAR-mediated improvements in glycaemic control. Colestilan significantly lowered serum cholesterol levels and improved glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.
BAR improved hepatic insulin resistance in FLS mice by reducing hepatic cholesterol without affecting hepatic triglyceride levels or body fat distribution. Our study revealed that BAR improves glycaemic control at least in part by downregulating the hepatic cholesterol-LXR-IRS2 pathway.
In view of the recent discoveries of novel nuclear receptors (NRs) whose ligands remain to be determined, metabolic intermediates may be considered as ligands for these receptors and undiscovered or overlooked intermediates may play important roles in regulating gene expression by activating or repressing the action of these nuclear receptors. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Steroid Perspectives'. 
Rhus verniciflua stokes (RVS) is a popular medicinal plant in oriental medicines which is commonly used to resolve extravasated blood. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of the role of RVS extracts on the regulation of lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis, we investigated whether RVS extract protect the hyperlipidemia in western diet-induced C57BL6/J mice. Mice fed a western diet and additionally RVS extracts was administered orally at a dose of 0.1 or 1 g/kg/day for 2 weeks respectively. Group with higher dose of RVS extract showed a significantly decreased body weight compared with western diet fed mice groups. And total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol levels and fatty liver formation were also improved especially in group of mice fed western diet supplemented high dose RVS extracts. Next, synthesis of hepatic bile acids were significantly increased in RVS extract fed groups. Furthermore, RVS extracts significantly increase promoter activity of Cyp7a1 via up-regulate the transcriptional expression level of LXRα. Our data suggest that RVS extracts could be a potent therapeutic ingredient for prevent a hyperlipidemia via increase of bile acids biosynthesis. 
Nuclear receptors are involved in many important function and mediate signaling by factors including hormones, vitamins and a number of endogenous ligands and xenobiotics, several of which are involved in lipid metabolism. This review focuses on the liver X receptor (LXR), which is an important regulator of whole-body cholesterol, fatty acid, and glucose homeostasis that binds to LXR response elements as a heterodimer with retinoid X receptors, and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), which is a bile acid receptor involved in feedback inhibition of bile acid synthesis, and thus cholesterol catabolism. These nuclear receptors regulate gene programs that control intestinal and hepatic lipid homeostasis through their effects on cholesterol transport and catabolism. 
Biliary cholesterol may contribute to the formation of cholesterol gallstones, and regulation of these levels could be a useful therapeutic strategy for gallstones disease. Piperine (PA) is a potential cholesterol lowering agent. In this study, we assessed the effect and mechanism of PA in preventing cholesterol gallstones formation induced by feeding lithogenic diet containing high cholesterol levels to mice. C57BL/6 inbred mice were fed lithogenic or chow diets for 10 weeks, with or without PA (15, 30 and 60 mg/kg) or ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA, 60 mg/kg) administration. Cholesterol, phospholipids and crystals in bile, the lipid in serum, pathological changes and proteins expression in liver were analyzed. The results showed that PA could decrease the cholesterol potency and crystals in bile, reduce total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG) and increase high-density lipoprotein/low-density lipoprotein (HDL/LDL) levels in serum. Furthermore, PA treatment reduced liver lipid peroxidation and protected hepatobiliary cells from liver injury by decreasing malondialdehyde (MDA) and increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD). In addition, PA inhibited the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporters G5/8 (ABCG5/8) and liver X receptor (LXR) in liver, and reduced cholesterol transport from the hepatocytes to the gallbladder. It may be the mechanism of PA in preventing cholesterol gallstones formation. PA as a potential drug for prevention cholesterol gallstones merits further investigation.
Liver X Receptors (LXRs) α and β are nuclear hormone receptors that regulate multiple genes involved in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) and are potential drug targets for atherosclerosis. However, full pan agonists also activate lipogenic genes, resulting in elevated plasma and hepatic lipids. We report the pharmacology of BMS-779788 [2-(2-(1-(2-chlorophenyl)-1-methylethyl)-1-(3'-(methylsulfonyl)-4-biphenylyl)-1H-imidazol-4-yl)-2-propanol], a potent partial LXR agonist with LXRβ selectivity, which has an improved therapeutic window in the cynomolgus monkey compared with a full pan agonist. BMS-779788 induced LXR target genes in blood in vivo with an EC50 = 610 nM, a value similar to its in vitro blood gene induction potency. BMS-779788 was 29- and 12-fold less potent than the full agonist T0901317 in elevating plasma triglyceride and LDL cholesterol, respectively, with similar results for plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein and apolipoprotein B. However, ABCA1 and ABCG1 mRNA inductions in blood, which are critical for RCT, were comparable. Increased liver triglyceride was observed after 7-day treatment with BMS-779788 at the highest dose tested and was nearly identical to the dose response for plasma triglyceride, consistent with the central role of liver LXR in these lipogenic effects. Dose-dependent increases in biliary cholesterol and decreases in phospholipid and bile acid occurred in BMS-779788-treated animals, similar to LXR agonist effects reported in mouse. In summary, BMS-779788, a partial LXRβ selective agonist, has decreased lipogenic potential compared with a full pan agonist in cynomolgus monkeys, with similar potency in the induction of genes known to stimulate RCT. This provides support in nonhuman primates for improving LXR agonist therapeutic windows by limiting LXRα activity. 
There is a growing evidence that bile acids are involved in the regulation of triglyceride-, cholesterol-homoeostasis and fat absorption. In this study organ-specific Fxr knockout mice were used to further investigate the influence of farnesoid X receptor FXR in lipogenesis.
Liver- and intestine-specific Fxr knockout mice were fed a 1% cholesterol diet for 28 days. Histological examination of frozen tissue sections included Sudan III/H&amp;E, BODIPY staining and liver X receptor (LXR) immunohistochemistry. Liver triglycerides, serum cholesterol, serum bile acids and nuclear LXR protein were measured. mRNA expression of several genes involved in bile acid-, cholesterol-homoeostasis and lipogenesis was quantified by real-time PCR.
Hepatic FXR deficiency contributes to lipid accumulation under 1% cholesterol administration which is not observed in intestinal Fxr knockout mice. Strong lipid accumulation, characterized by larger vacuoles could be observed in hepatic Fxr knockout sections, while intestinal Fxr knockout mice show no histological difference to controls. In addition, these mice have the ability to maintain normal serum cholesterol and bile acid levels. Hepatic Fxr knockouts were characterized by elevated triglycerides and bile acid levels. Expression level of LXR was significantly elevated under control and 1% cholesterol diet in hepatic Fxr knockout mice and was followed by concomitant lipogenic target gene induction such as Fas and Scd-1. This protective FXR effect against hepatic lipid accumulation was independent of intestinal Fgf15 induction.
These results show that the principal site of protective bile acid signalling against lipid accumulation is located in the liver since the absence of hepatic but not intestinal FXR contributes to lipid accumulation under cholesterol diet.
Bone repair required for successful arthroplasty can be compromised in patients with comorbid conditions, such as osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. Biological compounds have been proposed to promote bone health and repair. The authors have designed a new animal model for testing bone promoting compounds in the in vivo environment. For initial validation of this model, they used a synthetic agonist of a nuclear receptor, liver X receptor, which has been postulated to play a regulatory role in modulating bone growth. A distal femoral unicortical osteotomy was surgically created on skeletally mature C57Bl/6 male and female mice. A nanoparticle carrier delivery system was used to directly introduce N,N-dimethyl-3β-hydroxycholenamide into the osteotomy. At 35 days post-procedure, the femora were harvested and specimens were obtained for histologic processing and qualitative analysis. The results indicate that the carrier nanoparticles entered the osteotomy defect. Results also indicate that bone repair occurred, although significant differences between groups were not detected in the current study. This study validates the mouse model for testing bone repair promoting compounds. This model can be combined with transgenic or other mouse models to simulate problematic bone repair environments, can be used with a variety of drug carriers, and can test many types of interventional compounds to evaluate potential orthopedic therapeutic applications. 
Transcriptional coregulators are important components of nuclear receptor (NR) signaling machinery and provide additional mechanisms for modulation of NR activity. Expression of a mutated nuclear corepressor 1 (NCoR1) that lacks 2 NR interacting domains (NCoRΔID) in the liver leads to elevated expression of genes regulated by thyroid hormone receptor (TR) and liver X receptor (LXR), both of which control hepatic cholesterol metabolism. Here, we demonstrate that expression of NCoRΔID in mouse liver improves dietary cholesterol tolerance in an LXRα-independent manner. NCoRΔID-associated cholesterol tolerance was primarily due to diminished intestinal cholesterol absorption as the result of changes in the composition and hydrophobicity of the bile salt pool. Alterations of the bile salt pool were mediated by increased expression of genes encoding the bile acid metabolism enzymes CYP27A1 and CYP3A11 as well as canalicular bile salt pump ABCB11. We have determined that these genes are regulated by thyroid hormone and that TRβ1 is recruited to their regulatory regions. Together, these data indicate that interactions between NCoR1 and TR control a specific pathway involved in regulation of cholesterol metabolism and clearance. 
Nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a regulator of lipid metabolism as well as various cytoprotective enzymes and may be involved in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Although, bile acids affect lipid metabolism, the role of Nrf2 in bile acid metabolism remains unclear. In this study, it was tested how Nrf2 modulates lipid and bile acid homeostasis in liver in response to changes of cholesterol absorption under high-fat diet using Nrf2-null mice. Eight-week-old male wild-type and Nrf2-null mice (n = 6/group) were divided into three groups fed the following diets: 1) control diet containing 4% soybean oil and 16% lard, 2) control diet plus ezetimibe, 3) control diet plus cholesterol. Blood and livers were removed after 4 weeks feeding. High cholesterol diet increased hepatic expression of liver X receptor α target genes related to fatty acid metabolism (FAS, ACC1, SREBP-1c, SCD-1c and CD36), cholesterol transport (Abcg5/abcg8) and bile acid synthesis (Cyp7a1) in wild type mice. However, these genes were not induced in Nrf2-null mice. These findings suggest that Nrf2 has a relation to liver X receptor α and controls the regulation of gene expressions related to lipid and bile acid metabolism. 
Statins are suggested to preserve gallbladder function by suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines and preventing cholesterol accumulation in gallbladder epithelial cells. They also affect cross-talk among the nuclear hormone receptors that regulate cholesterol-bile acid metabolism in the nuclei of hepatocytes. However, there is controversy over whether or how statins change the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)alpha, PPARgamma, liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), ABCG5, ABCG8, and 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) which are directly involved in the cholesterol saturation index in bile.
Human Hep3B cells were cultured on dishes. MTT assays were performed to determine the appropriate concentrations of reagents to be used. The protein expression of PPARalpha and PPARgamma was measured by Western blotting analysis, and the mRNA expression of LXRalpha, FXR, ABCG5, ABCG8 and CYP7A1 was estimated by RT-PCR.
In cultured Hep3B cells, pravastatin activated PPARalpha and PPARgamma protein expression, induced stronger expression of PPARgamma than that of PPARalpha, increased LXRalpha mRNA expression, activated ABCG5 and ABCG8 mRNA expression mediated by FXR as well as LXRalpha, enhanced FXR mRNA expression, and increased CYP7A1 mRNA expression mediated by the PPARgamma and LXRalpha pathways, together or independently.
Our data suggested that pravastatin prevents cholesterol gallstone diseases via the increase of FXR, LXRalpha and CYP7A1 in human hepatocytes.
The development and lifespan of C. elegans are controlled by the nuclear hormone receptor DAF-12, an important model for the vertebrate vitamin D and liver X receptors. As with its mammalian homologues, DAF-12 function is regulated by bile acid-like steroidal ligands; however, tools for investigating their biosynthesis and function in vivo are lacking. A flexible synthesis for DAF-12 ligands and masked ligand derivatives that enable precise temporal control of DAF-12 function was developed. For ligand masking, photocleavable amides of 5-methoxy-N-methyl-2-nitroaniline (MMNA) were introduced. MMNA-masked ligands are bioavailable and after incorporation into the worm, brief UV irradiation can be used to trigger the expression of DAF-12 target genes and initiate development from dauer larvae into adults. The in vivo release of DAF-12 ligands and other small-molecule signals by using photocleavable MMNA-masked ligands will enable functional studies with precise spatial and temporal resolution. 
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become a common liver disease, as its prevalence has increased markedly in recent decades. The aim of the present study was to examine the improving effect of Clostridium butyricum MIYAIRI 588 (CBM588), a probiotic in clinical use for antibiotic-associated diarrhea, against high-fat diet (HFD)-induced fatty liver in rats.
After feeding HFD or HFD coated with CBM588 (HFD-CBM) for 12 weeks, we evaluated the hepatic mRNA levels related to lipid metabolism, and then assessed the hepatic protein levels of several transcription factors regulating these lipogenic gene expressions.
The HFD-CBM group had decreased accumulation of lipid droplets in the liver compared with the HFD group. The HFD-CBM group had significantly decreased diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) 2 mRNA in the liver compared with the HFD group, whereas DGAT1 mRNA did not change between the HFD group and the HFD-CBM group. Moreover, the HFD-CBM group had significantly increased hepatic mRNA regulating cholesterol catabolism enzymes and excretion transporters. Correspondingly, the HFD-CBM588 groups had increased hepatic protein levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α/γ and liver X receptor α compared with the HFD group. The HFD-CBM group had accelerated excretion of total bile acid and non-esterified fatty acid in the feces.
CBM588 intake may have novel potential for improving NAFLD.
The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and the liver x receptors (LXRs) are bile acid-activated receptors that are highly expressed in the enterohepatic tissues. The mechanisms that support the beneficial effects of bariatric surgery are only partially defined. We have investigated the effects of ileal interposition (IT), a surgical relocation of the distal ileum into the proximal jejunum, on FXR and LXRs in rats. Seven months after surgery, blood concentrations of total bile acids, taurocholic acid, an FXR ligand, and taurohyocholic acid, an LXRα ligand, were significantly increased by IT (P &lt; 0.05). In contrast, liver and intestinal concentrations of conjugated and nonconjugated bile acids were decreased (P &lt; 0.05). These changes were associated with a robust induction of FXR and FXR-regulated genes in the intestine, including Fgf15, a negative regulator of bile acid synthesis. IT repressed the liver expression of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pepck), two gluconeogenetic genes, along with the expression of LXRα and its target genes sterol regulatory element-binding protein (Srebp) 1c and fatty acid synthase (Fas) in the liver. Treating IT rats with chenodeoxycholic acid ameliorated insulin signaling in the liver. Whether confirmed in human settings, these results support the association of pharmacological therapies with bariatric surgeries to exploit the selective activation of intestinal nuclear receptors. 
The vitamin D receptor(VDR)is a ligand-dependent transcription factor of the nuclear receptor superfamily. VDR belongs to the NR1I subfamily along with other nuclear receptors involved in xenobiotic metabolism, such as pregnane X receptor. The oxysterol receptors liver X receptors α/β and the bile acid receptor farnesoid X receptor belong to the NR1H subfamily, which are closely related to the NR1I subfamily. NR1I and NR1H nuclear receptors form heterodimers with retinoid X receptor. The active form of vitamin D, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3[1,25(OH)2D3], acts as a physiological VDR ligand, and regulates various physiological processes, including calcium and bone metabolism, cellular growth and differentiation, immunity, and cardiovascular function. The secondary bile acid lithocholic acid, which is produced by intestinal bacteria, is another natural VDR ligand. Lithocholic acid stimulates xenobiotic metabolism and regulates immune and inflammatory responses via VDR, and its calcemic action is limited and observed only in vitamin D-deficient animals. Thus, lithocholic acid may be a function-selective VDR ligand. VDR is a promising drug in the treatment of bone and mineral disorders, cancer, autoimmune disease, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease. However, the adverse effect hypercalcemia limits wider clinical application of 1,25(OH)2D3 and its derivatives. Elucidation of the mechanism of VDR function by lithocholic acid should expand the possibility of VDR-targeted approaches.
Schaftoside (SS) is a bioactive compound present in the Herba Desmodii Styracifolii (DS), a herb that has been used to treat cholelithiasis and urolithiasis in Chinese medicine. Whether SS inhibits cholesterol (Ch) gallstone formation has not been investigated. This study examined the effects of oral intake of SS on Ch gallstone formation in C57BL/6 mice fed a lithogenic diet. The rate of gallstone formation was recorded. Levels of Ch, triglycerides (TG) and bile salts (BS) were measured in the bile and serum. Liver histopathology was examined microscopically, and mRNA expression levels of key genes involved in cholesterol and bile metabolism were determined by qPCR. Mice fed SS were protected against gallstone formation, had increased biliary levels of BS, and reduced biliary Ch levels, resulting in a lower Ch saturation index (CSI). In addition, mice fed SS had lower serum TG and Ch levels, increased mRNA expression of liver X receptor α, ATP binding cassette transporter 5/8 (ABCG5/8), and ileal bile acid binding protein (IBABP) in the ileum, and of farnesoid X receptor and bile salt export protein (BSEP) in the liver and ileum. SS also protected against histologically determined liver damage. Overall, these data indicate that SS protects against Ch gallstone formation in mice, and that the effect is mediated by activation of ileal liver X receptor α and hepatic farnesoid X receptor.
Usnea is a lichen of Usnea diffracta Vain and Usnea longissima Ach, which belongs to the genus Usnea Adans of Usneaceae. Usnea exerts numerous pharmacological activities, while its lipid regulatory activities remain unreported. This study aims to evaluate the effects of aqueous and ethanol extracts of Usnea on the regulation of lipid metabolism and to explore the possible mechanism.
Hyperlipidemia rat model was established by feeding with high-fat diet for 45days. Therapy rats were intragastrically administered with simvastatin (0.004g/kg/d), Usnea aqueous extract (2.766g/kg/d), or Usnea ethanol extract (2.766g/kg/d) for 20days. Pharmacodynamic effects, including body weight, serum and liver lipid levels, total bile acid (TBA), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), liver index, and hepatic morphological changes were evaluated. To explore the mechanisms, the lipase activities and protein expressions related to lipid metabolism were detected.
Compared with the model group, aqueous and ethanol extracts of Usnea can slow down the weight gain of rats, significantly reduce the serum levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and the liver contents of TG, LDL-C, as well as significantly increase the contents of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in serum. In addition, aqueous and ethanol extracts of Usnea can significantly reduce the serum contents of AST and ALT. Furthermore, ethanol extract of Usnea can also significantly reduce the TBA content in serum and liver index. Liver tissue pathological observation showed that aqueous and ethanol extracts of Usnea can improve cell degeneration to a certain extent. Aqueous and ethanol extracts of Usnea can significantly reduce sterol regulatory element-binding proteins-1c, and liver X receptor α (LXR-α) protein expressions. Furthermore, aqueous extract of Usnea can significantly increase hepatic lipase activity and promote apoprotein A5 (ApoA5) protein expression.
These findings strongly suggest that the aqueous and ethanol extracts of Usnea play significant roles in regulating lipid metabolism, and the ethanol extract exhibits higher activity than the aqueous extract. The mechanism of the regulation of lipid metabolism by Usnea aqueous extract may involve the increased ApoA5 protein expression via inhibition of the LXR-α signal pathway; however, the mechanism of the regulation of lipid metabolism by Usnea ethanol extract remains to be further studied.
Cholesterol gallstone disease (CGD) is one of the most common gastrointestinal diseases. Lithogenic hepatic bile secretion precedes the formation of cholesterol gallstones. Constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), a member of nuclear family, plays an important role in cholesterol and bile acid metabolism. To examine whether activation of CAR can prevent cholesterol gallstone formation, we treated C57BL6/J mice maintained on a lithogenic diet with CAR agonist 1,4-bis-[2-(3, 5-dichlorpyridyloxy)] benzene and performed bile duct cannulation to study the dynamics of biliary lipids. We report that activation of CAR decreases the biliary cholesterol concentration and prevents CGD formation. The lower biliary cholesterol level was largely attributed to suppressed Abcg5 and Abcg8 expression in CAR-activated mice. CAR activation also promoted cholesterol conversion into bile acids by increasing the expression of Cyp7a1, a rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid biosynthesis. Activation of CAR enhanced bile acid re-absorption via increasing the expression of bile acid transporters Asbt and Ostβ in the ileum. The hepatic steatosis was also improved in the liver of CAR-activated mice. Furthermore, activation of CAR protected the mice against the liver X receptor α-sensitized CGD through suppressing the expression of Abcg5/8. Collectively, CAR plays an important role in maintaining the homeostasis of cholesterol, bile acids, and triglycerides levels, and it might be a promising therapeutic target for preventing or treating CGD.
Valeriana jatamansi Jones, a plant with heart-shaped leaves in the Valeriana genus of Valerianaceae, is widely used in Chinese folk medicine. Iridoid is an important constituent of V. jatamansi that contributes to the pharmacological efficacy of the herb. This study aims to investigate the regulation of lipid metabolism and its mechanism of the iridoids rich fraction in V. jatamansi (IRFV). A high fat diet was used to establish the hyperlipidemia rat model, with 2mg/kg/d of simvastatin as a positive control, fed with 7.5, 15, and 30mg/kg/d of IRFV for 20days to investigate the lipid regulation activity and mechanism of IRFV. Body weight, liver index, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in both serum and liver, as well as total bile acid (TBA), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in serum were measured. The lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase (HL) activities and the apoprotein A5 (ApoA5), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPAR-α), sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP-1c), and liver X receptor α (LXR-α) protein expressions were observed. Liver pathology was described through hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. Compared with the model group, three different IRFV dosages can slow down the weight gain of rats, reduce the contents of TG, and increase the contents of HDL-C in serum. Low IRFV dosage can significantly reduce the AST and ALT contents in serum, liver index, and the TG contents in liver, enhance LPL activity. Medium IRFV dosage can significantly decrease the TG and LDL-C contents in liver. High IRFV dosage can significantly reduce LDL-C, TBA, AST, and ALT contents in serum, and enhance HL activity. Three different IRFV dosages can significantly increase the ApoA5 and PPAR-α protein expression and decrease the SREBP-1c protein expression. Furthermore, the LXR-α protein expression decreased in low- and high-dose groups. Liver tissue pathological observation showed that IRFV can improve cell degeneration to a certain extent. These results strongly suggest that IRFV play significant roles in regulating lipid metabolism, the mechanism may be related to the increased ApoA5 protein expression.
To examine the role of hepatocyte myeloid differentiation primary-response gene 88 (MyD88) on glucose and lipid metabolism.
To study the impact of the innate immune system at the level of the hepatocyte and metabolism, we generated mice harbouring hepatocyte-specific deletion of MyD88. We investigated the impact of the deletion on metabolism by feeding mice with a normal control diet or a high-fat diet for 8 weeks. We evaluated body weight, fat mass gain (using time-domain nuclear magnetic resonance), glucose metabolism and energy homeostasis (using metabolic chambers). We performed microarrays and quantitative PCRs in the liver. In addition, we investigated the gut microbiota composition, bile acid profile and both liver and plasma metabolome. We analysed the expression pattern of genes in the liver of obese humans developing non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
Hepatocyte-specific deletion of MyD88 predisposes to glucose intolerance, inflammation and hepatic insulin resistance independently of body weight and adiposity. These phenotypic differences were partially attributed to differences in gene expression, transcriptional factor activity (ie, peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-α, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), liver X receptors and STAT3) and bile acid profiles involved in glucose, lipid metabolism and inflammation. In addition to these alterations, the genetic deletion of MyD88 in hepatocytes changes the gut microbiota composition and their metabolomes, resembling those observed during diet-induced obesity. Finally, obese humans with NASH displayed a decreased expression of different cytochromes P450 involved in bioactive lipid synthesis.
Our study identifies a new link between innate immunity and hepatic synthesis of bile acids and bioactive lipids. This dialogue appears to be involved in the susceptibility to alterations associated with obesity such as type 2 diabetes and NASH, both in mice and humans.
Atherosclerosis is both a chronic inflammatory disease and a lipid metabolism disorder. C/EBPβ is well documented for its role in the development of hematopoietic cells and integration of lipid metabolism. However, C/EBPβ's role in atherosclerotic progression has not been examined. We assessed the impact of hematopoietic CEBPβ deletion in ApoE(-/-) mice on hyperlipidemia, inflammatory responses and lesion formation in the aorta.
ApoE(-/-) mice were reconstituted with bone marrow cells derived from either WT or C/EBPβ(-/-) mice and placed on low fat or high fat/high cholesterol diet for 11 weeks. Hematopoietic C/EBPβ deletion in ApoE(-/-) mice reduced blood and hepatic lipids and gene expression of hepatic stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 and fatty acid synthase while expression of ATP binding cassette transporter G1, cholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase, and liver X receptor alpha genes were significantly increased. ApoE(-/-) mice reconstituted with C/EBPβ(-/-) bone marrow cells also significantly reduced blood cytokine levels and reduced lesion area in aortic sinuses compared with ApoE(-/-) mice reconstituted with WT bone marrow cells. Silencing of C/EBPβ in RAW264.7 macrophage cells prevented oxLDL-mediated foam cell formation and inflammatory cytokine secretion in conditioned medium.
C/EBPβ in hematopoietic cells is crucial to regulate diet-induced inflammation, hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis development.
Triptolide, a diterpenoid isolated from the plant Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. f., exerts a unique bioactive spectrum of anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities. However, triptolide's clinical applications are limited due to its severe toxicities. Fatty liver toxicity occurs in response to triptolide, and this toxic response significantly differs between males and females. This report investigated the pathogenesis underlying the sex-related differences in the dyslipidosis induced by triptolide in rats. Wistar rats were administered 0, 150, 300, or 450 μg triptolide/kg/day by gavage for 28 days. Ultrastructural examination revealed that more lipid droplets were present in female triptolide-treated rats than in male triptolide-treated rats. Furthermore, liver triglyceride, total bile acid and free fatty acid levels were significantly increased in female rats in the 300 and 450 μg/kg dose groups. The expression of liver X receptor α (LXRα) and its target genes, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and Sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1(SREBP-1), increased following triptolide treatment in both male and female rats; however, the female rats were more sensitive to triptolide than the male rats. In addition, the expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1(ACC1), a target gene of SREBP-1, increased in the female rats treated with 450 μg triptolide/kg/day, and ACC1 expression contributed to the sex-related differences in the triptolide-induced dysfunction of lipid metabolism. Our results demonstrate that the sex-related differences in LXR/SREBP-1-mediated regulation of gene expression in rats are responsible for the sex-related differences in lipid metabolism induced by triptolide, which likely underlie the sex-related differences in triptolide hepatotoxicity. This study will be important for predicting sex-related effects on the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of triptolide and for improving its safety. 
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the most common cause of liver disease in the United States. There are no drug therapies approved for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Multiple different pathways are involved in the pathogenesis and each can be the target of the therapy. It is possible that more than 1 target is involved in disease development and progression. Multiple clinical trials with promising agents are underway. Because NASH is a slowly progressive disease and treatment likely to be of prolonged duration, acceptance and approval of any agent will require information on long-term clinical benefits and safety. 
Omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω3PUFA) have been shown to be antiinflammatory in the attenuation of hepatocellular injury. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) is a nuclear receptor transcription factor that inhibits the activation of nuclear factor κB, thereby repressing inflammation, and ωPUFA are PPARα ligands. The purpose of this study was to determine if ω3PUFA attenuate bile acid-induced apoptosis via PPARα.
Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells were treated with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) ± ω3PUFA. Activation of PPARα was evaluated, and expression of PPARα, farnesoid X receptor, liver X receptor alpha (LXRα), and retinoid X receptor mRNA was evaluated by reverse-transcriptase PCR.
PPARα activation was increased in HepG2 cells treated with ω3PUFA, and decreased in the presence of CDCA when compared with untreated cells. PPARα mRNA was reduced by 67% with CDCA and restored to the level of control with ω3PUFA. LXRα mRNA increased twofold with CDCA treatment and was significantly reduced by ω3PUFA.
Expression of PPARα, as well as LXRα mRNA levels, was reduced with CDCA treatment and restored with the addition of ω3PUFA. These results suggest that PPARα and LXRα may be mediators by which ω3PUFA attenuate bile acid-induced hepatocellular injury.
The cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), a key player in cholesterol metabolism, has been shown to promote the transfer of triglycerides from very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) to high density lipoprotein (HDL) in exchange for cholesterol ester. Here we demonstrate that farnesoid X receptor alpha (FXRalpha; NR1H4) down-regulates CETP expression in HepG2 cells. A FXRalpha ligand, chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), suppressed basal mRNA levels of the CETP gene in HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Using gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, we found that FXRalpha could bind to the liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha; NR1H3) binding site (LXRE; DR4RE) located within the CETP 5' promoter region. FXRalpha suppressed LXRalpha-induced DR4RE-luciferase activity and this effect was mediated by a binding competition between FXRalpha and LXRalpha for DR4RE. Furthermore, the addition of CDCA together with a LXRalpha ligand, GW3965, to HepG2 cells was shown to substantially decrease mRNA levels of hepatic CETP gene, which is typically induced by GW3965. Together, our data demonstrate that FXRalpha down-regulates CETP gene expression via binding to the DR4RE sequence within the CETP 5' promoter and this FXRalpha binding is essential for FXRalpha inhibition of LXRalpha-induced CETP expression.
To investigate changes in bile acid biosynthesis in chicken (Gallus gallus) during embryonic stages, we studied the contribution of hepatic and plasma total bile acid levels, mRNA expression of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), and the expression of its regulatory genes in two embryo models (i.e., broilers and layers) differing in lipid metabolism. Total bile acid levels in plasma and liver were low during embryonic stages, as well as expression of CYP7A1. At hatch (P0), hepatic and plasma total bile acid levels and CYP7A1 mRNA expression in liver were markedly increased in both models. The hepatic mRNA expression of liver X receptor (LXR)alpha, a regulator of CYP7A1 gene expression gradually decreased with developmental stages of both broilers and layers. The hepatic mRNA expression of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a repressor of CYP7A1 gene expression, also decreased with embryonic development. The present results showed that the mRNA expression of CYP7A1 and synthesis of bile acids was low in embryonic stages, suggesting that FXR might be a key regulator of CYP7A1 gene expression in the chicken embryo.
Alagille syndrome (AGS) is a rare hereditary disorder exhibiting fluctuating cholestasis and dyslipidemia. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and liver X receptor (LXR) are hepatic nuclear receptors that regulate bile acid and lipoprotein metabolism. To investigate whether cholestasis is related to dyslipidemia and hepatic nuclear receptor expression in AGS patients, we determined the blood levels of total bile acid (TBA) and lipoprotein parameters, and examined hepatic nuclear receptor expression in three AGS children and their three incomplete AGS parents repeatedly over several years. In the AGS children, TBA level showed significant positive correlations with low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, apolipoprotein E (apoE)-rich high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), apoA-I, apoE, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) concentrations, but negative correlation with apoE-poor HDL-C concentration. Western blot analysis of liver biopsy specimens revealed that FXR and LXR expression increased in parallel with TBA level. CETP- and ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 expression also increased with TBA level, while scavenger receptor class B type-I expression showed the opposite response. However, apoA-I expression was similar to the control level at any TBA level. In the incomplete AGS parents, TBA and lipoprotein parameters showed little fluctuation. In summary, cholestasis is closely related to dyslipidemia and hepatic nuclear receptor expression in AGS patients.
Gallstone disease is a hepatobiliary disorder due to biochemical imbalances in the gallbladder bile. In this report, we show that activation of nuclear receptor liver X receptor (LXR) sensitized mice to lithogenic diet-induced gallbladder cholesterol crystallization, which was associated with dysregulation of several hepatic transporters that efflux cholesterol, phospholipids, and bile salts. The combined effect of increased biliary concentrations of cholesterol and phospholipids and decreased biliary concentrations of bile salts in LXR-activated mice led to an increased cholesterol saturation index and the formation of cholesterol crystals. Interestingly, the lithogenic effect of LXR was completely abolished in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr) null background or when the mice were treated with Ezetimibe, a cholesterol-lowering drug that blocks intestinal dietary cholesterol absorption. These results suggest that LDLR-mediated hepatic cholesterol uptake and intestinal cholesterol absorption play an essential role in LXR-promoted lithogenesis.
The current study has revealed a novel lithogenic role of LXR as well as a functional interplay between LXR and LDLR in gallbladder cholesterol crystallization and possibly cholesterol gallstone disease (CGD). We propose that LXR is a lithogenic factor and that the LXR transgenic mice may offer a convenient CGD model to develop therapeutic interventions for this disease.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) alpha and ss belong to a family of nuclear receptors which form heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor and, upon ligand binding, stimulate the expression of target genes. LXRs were initially described as orphan receptors and oxidized cholesterol derivatives (oxysterols) were later identified as their natural ligands. In addition, several synthetic LXR agonists such as T0901317 and GW3965 were synthesized. Oxysterols are formed in amounts proportional to cholesterol content in the cell and therefore the LXRs operate as cholesterol sensors which protect from cholesterol overload by: 1) inhibiting intestinal cholesterol absorption, 2) stimulating cholesterol efflux from cells to high-density lipoproteins through the ATP-binding cassette transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1, 3) activating the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids in the liver, and (4) activating biliary cholesterol and bile acid excretion. In addition, LXR agonists activate de novo fatty acid synthesis by stimulating the expression of a lipogenic transcription factor, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), leading to the elevation of plasma triglycerides and liver steatosis. Here we describe the structure and function of the LXRs, their endo- and exogenous agonists and antagonists, the regulation of LXR expression and activity, and their role in the regulation of cholesterol and lipid metabolism. In the accompanying article we characterize other effects of LXRs, alterations in LXR expression, and changes in the level of their endogenous agonists in pathological conditions as well as therapeutic implications.
Type I human hepatic 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (AKR1C4) plays a significant role in bile acid biosynthesis, steroid hormone metabolism, and xenobiotic metabolism. Utilization of a hidden Markov model for predictive modeling of nuclear hormone receptor response elements coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation/microarray technology revealed a putative binding site in the AKR1C4 promoter for the nuclear hormone receptor known as liver X receptor alpha, (LXRalpha [NR1H3]), which is the physiological receptor for oxidized cholesterol metabolites. The putative LXRalpha response element (LXRE), identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation, was approximately 1.5 kilobase pairs upstream of the transcription start site. LXRalpha was shown to bind specifically to this LXRE and mediate transcriptional activation of the AKR1C4 gene, leading to increased AKR1C4 protein expression. These data suggest that LXRalpha may modulate the bile acid biosynthetic pathway at a unique site downstream of CYP7A1 and may also modulate the metabolism of steroid hormones and certain xenobiotics.
Cholesterol supersaturation of bile is one prerequisite for gallstone formation. In the present study of Chinese patients with gallstones, we investigated whether this phenomenon was correlated with the hepatic expression of genes participating in the metabolism of cholesterol and bile acids. Twenty-two nonobese, normolipidemic patients (female-male, 11:11) with gallstones were investigated with 13 age- and body mass index-matched gallstone-free controls (female-male, 10:3). The bile from the gallstone patients had higher cholesterol saturation than that from the controls. The mRNA levels of ABCG5, ABCG8, and liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha) in the gallstone patients were increased by 51, 59, and 102%, respectively, and significantly correlated with the molar percentage of biliary cholesterol and cholesterol saturation index (CSI). The mRNA and protein levels of the hepatic scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) were increased, and a significant correlation was found between the protein levels and the CSI. No differences were recorded between the two groups concerning the hepatic synthesis of cholesterol, bile acids, and esterification of cholesterol. Our results suggest that the upregulation of ABCG5/ABCG8 in gallstone patients, possibly mediated by increased LXRalpha, may contribute to the cholesterol supersaturation of bile. Our data are consistent with the possibility that increased amounts of biliary cholesterol may originate from plasma HDL cholesterol by enhanced transfer via SR-BI.
Although the LXXLL motif of nuclear receptor (NR) coactivators is essential for interaction with NRs, its role has not been assessed in unbiased animal models. The nuclear receptor coactivator 6 (NCoA6; also AIB3, PRIP, ASC-2, TRBP, RAP250, or NRC) is a coactivator containing an N-terminal LXXLL-1 (L1) and a C-terminal L2. L1 interacts with many NRs, while L2 interacts with the liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha) and the estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha). We generated mice in which L2 was mutated into AXXAL (L2m) to disrupt its interaction with LXRalpha and ERalpha. NCoA6(L2m/L2m) mice exhibited normal reproduction, mammary gland morphogenesis, and ERalpha target gene expression. In contrast, when treated with an LXRalpha agonist, lipogenesis and the LXRalpha target gene expression were significantly reduced in NCoA6(L2m/L2m) mice. The induction of Cyp7A1 expression by a high-cholesterol diet was impaired in NCoA6(L2m/L2m) mice, which reduced bile acid synthesis in the liver and excretion in the feces and resulted in cholesterol accumulation in the liver and blood. These results demonstrate that L2 plays a tissue- and NR-specific role: it is required for NCoA6 to mediate LXRalpha-regulated lipogenesis and cholesterol/bile acid homeostasis in the liver but not required for ERalpha function in the mammary gland.
In this study we analyzed functions of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters involved in sterol transport from Caco-2 cells. Treatment with a synthetic liver x receptor ligand elevated both mRNA and protein levels of ABCG5, G8, and ABCA1. The ligand stimulated cholesterol efflux, suggesting that ABC transporters are involved in it. To identify the acceptors of cholesterol, potential molecules such as apolipoprotein A-I, glycocholic acid, phosphatidylcholine, and bile acid micelles were added to the medium. Apo A-I, a known acceptor of cholesterol transported by ABCA1, elevated cholesterol efflux on the basal side, whereas the others raised cholesterol efflux on the apical side. Moreover, bile acid micelles preferentially augmented plant sterol efflux rather than cholesterol. Finally, in HEK293 cells stably expressing ABCG5/G8, bile acid micelle-mediated sterol efflux was significantly accelerated. These results indicate that ABCG5/G8, unlike ABCA1, together with bile acids should participate in sterol efflux on the apical surface of Caco-2 cells.
To explore the effects of the simultaneous activation of liver X receptor (LXR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) on bile acid biosynthesis in rats.
Totally 36 male SD rats were divided into three groups with 12 rats in each group: control group, high cholesterol (HC) group, and high cholesterol + fenofibrate (HC + FENO) group. Total bile acids (serum bile acids plus fecal bile acids) level was assayed. The levels of mRNA for peroxisomal palmitoyl-CoA oxidase (Acox1), LXR, cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), D-bifunctional protein (DBP), trihydroxycoprostanoyl-CoA oxidase (Acox2), sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase (CYP8B1), and sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) in liver were detected by RT-PCR.
Total bile acid level was significantly higher in HC + FENO group than in HC group (P &lt; 0.01), and both were significantly higher than that in control group (P &lt; 0.01). Compared with HC group, the mRNA expression of Acox1 and DBP was significantly higher in HC + FENO group (P &lt; 0.01), but no statistical differences was found between HC group and control group. The mRNA levels of LXR and CYP7A1 in HC + FENO group and HC group were not significantly different but were both significantly higher than that in control group (P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.05). No changes were observed in Acox2, CYPSB1, and CYP27A1 mRNA levels among these three groups.
Simultaneous activation of LXR and PPARalpha can increase of CYP7A1 and DBP mRNA exDression and thus accelerates the biosynthesis of bile acid.
The liver is central to the maintenance of glucose and lipid homeostasis, and liver X receptors (LXRs) are key regulators of expression of the genes involved. So far, effects of activation of LXR in human hepatocytes have not been well characterized. Here we show that treatment of primary human hepatocytes with the synthetic LXR ligand 3-[3-[N-(2-chloro-3-trifluoromethylbenzyl)-(2,2-diphenylethyl)amino]propyloxy]phenylacetic acid hydrochloride (GW3965) results in reduced output of bile acids and very low density lipoprotein triglycerides and induced expression of adipose differentiation-related protein accompanied by increased lipid storage. Genome wide-expression profiling identified novel human LXR target genes in the glycolytic and lipogenic pathways and indicated that LXR activation reduced hepatic insulin sensitivity. Comparative experiments showed significant differences in the response to GW3965 between human and rat hepatocytes, raising the question as to how well rodent models reflect the human situation. In summary, the risk of hepatic steatosis upon pharmaceutical targeting of LXR may be a particularly serious consequence in humans.
Aberrant cholesterol metabolism has been implicated in Alzheimer disease (AD) and other neurological disorders. Oxysterols and other cholesterol oxidation products are effective ligands of liver X activated receptor (LXR) nuclear receptors, major regulators of genes subserving cholesterol homeostasis. LXR receptors act as molecular sensors of cellular cholesterol concentrations and effectors of tissue cholesterol reduction. Following their interaction with oxysterols, activation of LXRs induces the expression of ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A member 1, a pivotal modulator of cholesterol efflux. The relative solubility of oxysterols facilitates lipid flux among brain compartments and egress across the blood-brain barrier. Oxysterol-mediated LXR activation induces local apoE biosynthesis (predominantly in astrocytes) further enhancing cholesterol re-distribution and removal. Activated LXRs invoke additional neuroprotective mechanisms, including induction of genes governing bile acid synthesis (sterol elimination pathway), apolipoprotein elaboration, and amyloid precursor protein processing. The latter translates into attenuated beta-amyloid production that may ameliorate amyloidogenic neurotoxicity in AD brain. Stress-induced up-regulation of the heme-degrading enzyme, heme oxygenase-1 in AD-affected astroglia may impact central lipid homeostasis by promoting the oxidation of cholesterol to a host of oxysterol intermediates. Synthetic oxysterol-mimetic drugs that activate LXR receptors within the CNS may provide novel therapeutics for management of AD and other neurological afflictions characterized by deranged tissue cholesterol homeostasis.
ABC transporter A1 (ABCA1) mediates and rate-limits biogenesis of high density lipoprotein (HDL), and hepatic ABCA1 plays a major role in regulating plasma HDL levels. HDL generation is also responsible for release of cellular cholesterol. In peripheral cells ABCA1 is up-regulated by the liver X receptor (LXR) system when cell cholesterol increases. However, cholesterol feeding has failed to show a significant increase in hepatic ABCA1 gene expression, and its expression is up-regulated by statins (3-hydroy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors), suggesting distinct regulation. In this study we investigated the mechanism of regulation of the rat hepatic ABCA1 gene and identified two major ABCA1 transcripts and two corresponding promoter regions. Compactin activated the novel liver-type promoter in rat hepatoma McARH7777 cells by binding the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2). In contrast, compactin repressed the previously identified peripheral-type promoter in an LXR-responsive element-dependent but not E-box-dependent manner. Thus, compactin increased the liver-type transcript and decreased the peripheral-type transcript. The same two transcripts were also dominant in human and mouse livers, whereas the intestine contains only the peripheral-type transcript. Treatment of rats with pravastatin and a bile acid binding resin (colestimide), which is known to activate SREBP-2 in the liver, caused a reduction in the hepatic cholesterol level and the same differential responses in vivo, leading to increases in hepatic ABCA1 mRNA and protein and plasma HDL levels. We conclude that the dual promoter system driven by SREBP-2 and LXR regulates hepatic ABCA1 expression and may mediate the unique response of hepatic ABCA1 gene expression to cellular cholesterol status.
Chlordecone (CD) is one of many banned organochlorine (OC) insecticides that are widespread persistent organic pollutants. OC insecticides alter lipid homeostasis in rodents at doses that are not neurotoxic or carcinogenic. Pretreatment of mice or rats with CD altered tissue distribution of a subsequent dose of [(14)C]CD or [(14)C]cholesterol (CH). Nuclear receptors regulate expression of genes important in the homeostasis of CH and other lipids. In this study, we report that CD suppresses in vitro reporter systems for human liver X receptors (LXRs) and activates those for human farnesoid X receptor (FXR), pregnane X receptor (PXR) and estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) in a concentration-dependent manner (0-50 muM). Consistent with human PXR activation in vitro, three days after a single dose of CD (15 mg/kg) hepatic microsomal CYP3A11 protein increases in C57BL/6 mice. CD decreases hepatic CH ester content without altering total CH concentration. Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) contents of hepatic lipoprotein-rich and microsomal fractions of CD-treated mice are higher than controls. There is a significant reduction in non-high density lipoprotein CH but not apolipoprotein B-48/100 (apoB-48/100) in plasma from CD-treated mice after a 4 h fast. At 14 days after 15 mg CD/kg apoA-I and apoB-100 proteins but not CYP3A11 protein in hepatic microsomes are similar to controls. This work indicates that altered CH homeostasis is a mode of OC insecticide action of relevance after a single dose. This at least partially explains altered CH tissue distribution in CD-pretreated mice.
LXR, PXR, and PPARalpha are members of a nuclear receptor family which regulate the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism. Here, we show the administration of T0901317 stimulates PPARalpha gene expression in the small intestine but not in the liver of both normal and FXR-null mice. The administration of LXR specific ligand GW3965, or PXR specific ligand PCN has the same effect, indicating that ligand-dependent activation of LXR and PXR, but not FXR, is responsible for the increased gene expression of PPARalpha in the mouse small intestine.
Nuclear hormone receptors, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), liver X receptors (LXRs), and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), are transcription factors involved in the regulation of essential metabolic functions, including glucose and lipid metabolism, reverse cholesterol transport, and the regulation of bile acids. This review summarizes new developments in the use of PPAR, LXR and FXR agonists for the treatment of obesity and cardiovascular diseases, including dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. Currently available drugs and future areas of research for new therapies are also discussed.
Despite the success of existing therapies, new therapies targeted toward dyslipidemia are still needed. Liver X receptor (LXR) and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) represent 2 very different attractive targets for new therapeutic development. LXR is a nuclear receptor that primarily acts to rid cells and the body of excess cholesterol. LXR agonists have been shown to reduce atherosclerosis in animals and are therefore of great interest as a therapeutic approach. Despite some increases in hepatic fat and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in preclinical models, LXR remains an important new target. FXR is a nuclear receptor that primarily acts to protect hepatocytes against the effects of elevated bile acids. FXR agonists also have triglyceride-lowering properties and could be useful in treating certain types of dyslipidemia. FXR modulators or antagonists could potentially lower LDL cholesterol levels and even modulate high-density lipoprotein metabolism. FXR is a complicated but fascinating target for the development of new therapeutic approaches.
Recently identified organic solute transporter (Ost) alpha and beta are located on the basolateral membrane of enterocytes and may be responsible for the intestinal absorption of many substrates including bile acids. In the present study, the mechanism governing the transcriptional regulation of their expression was investigated.
To clarify the transcriptional regulation of Osts, reporter gene assays were performed using mouse Ostalpha/beta promoter-luciferase reporter constructs. Co-transfection of the constructs with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRalpha) or liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha) and RXRalpha into Caco-2 cells induced the transcriptional activities of both Ost alpha and beta and further increases were observed following treatment with each agonist. Sequence analyses indicated the presence of IR-1 regions in Ostalpha and Ostbeta promoters, which was confirmed by the finding that the deletion of IR-1 sequences abolished the response to FXR and LXRalpha. Furthermore, mutations in IR-1 reduced the FXR- and LXRalpha-dependent transactivation of Ostalpha/beta. Together with the detection of direct binding of FXR/RXRalpha and LXRalpha/RXRalpha to the IR-1 elements, the presence of functional FXRE/LXRE was revealed in the promoter region of both Ostalpha and Ostbeta. In addition, the stimulatory effect of FXR/RXRalpha and LXRalpha/RXRalpha on Ostalpha, but not on Ostbeta, was further enhanced by HNF-4alpha.
It was concluded that LXRalpha/RXRalpha transcriptionally regulate mouse Ostalpha/beta via IR-1 elements shared with FXR/RXRalpha. Exposure to FXR/LXRalpha modulators may affect the disposition of Ostalpha/beta substrates.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) are nuclear receptors that function as intracellular sensors for sterols and bile acids, respectively. In response to their ligands, these receptors induce transcriptional responses that maintain a balanced, finely tuned regulation of cholesterol and bile acid metabolism. LXRs also permit the efficient storage of carbohydrate- and fat-derived energy, whereas FXR activation results in an overall decrease in triglyceride levels and modulation of glucose metabolism. The elegant, dual interplay between these two receptor systems suggests that they coevolved to constitute a highly sensitive and efficient system for the maintenance of total body fat and cholesterol homeostasis. Emerging evidence suggests that the tissue-specific action of these receptors is also crucial for the proper function of the cardiovascular, immune, reproductive, endocrine pancreas, renal, and central nervous systems. Together, LXRs and FXR represent potential therapeutic targets for the treatment and prevention of numerous metabolic and lipid-related diseases.
Oxysterols are intermediates in the synthesis of bile acids and steroid hormones from cholesterol and function as ligands for liver X receptor (LXR). Bile salt export pump (BSEP) is responsible for canalicular secretion of bile acids and is tightly regulated by its substrates bile acids through nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR). In a microarray study using human hepatocytes, BSEP was markedly induced not only by chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) but also by oxysterol 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol [22(R)-OHC]. We hypothesized that the expression of BSEP was induced by oxysterols through activation of LXR. To test the hypothesis, human primary hepatocytes or hepatoma cells were treated with 22(R)-OHC, and expression of BSEP was determined. The level of BSEP mRNA was increased as much as 5-fold upon oxysterol induction. In contrast to our hypothesis, the oxysterol-induced up-regulation of BSEP is mediated through FXR but not LXR. BSEP promoter activity was markedly induced by 22(R)-OHC in the presence of FXR but not LXRs. Mutation of the FXR element IR1 in the BSEP promoter significantly reduced its ability to respond to oxysterol induction. To determine whether 22(R)-OHC and CDCA bind to similar structural features of FXR, site-directed mutagenesis was performed in the FXR ligand binding domain. Mutation of residues R331 and I352 abolished activation mediated by CDCA and 22(R)-OHC. In contrast, substitution of residues L340 and R351 differentiated CDCA- and 22(R)-OHC-mediated activation. In conclusion, oxysterol 22(R)-OHC functions as an FXR ligand to induce BSEP expression and differs in the binding with FXR from CDCA.
As previously reported by us, mice with targeted disruption of the CYP8B1 gene (CYP8B1-/-) fail to produce cholic acid (CA), upregulate their bile acid synthesis, reduce the absorption of dietary cholesterol and, after cholesterol feeding, accumulate less liver cholesterol than wild-type (CYP8B1+/+) mice. In the present study, cholesterol-enriched diet (0.5%) or administration of a synthetic liver X receptor (LXR) agonist strongly upregulated CYP7A1 expression in CYP8B1-/- mice, compared to CYP8B1+/+ mice. Cholesterol-fed CYP8B1-/- mice also showed a significant rise in HDL cholesterol and increased levels of liver ABCA1 mRNA. A combined CA (0.25%)/cholesterol (0.5%) diet enhanced absorption of intestinal cholesterol in both groups of mice, increased their liver cholesterol content, and reduced their expression of CYP7A1 mRNA. The ABCG5/G8 liver mRNA was increased in both groups of mice, but cholesterol crystals were only observed in bile from the CYP8B1+/+ mice. The results demonstrate the cholesterol-sparing effects of CA: enhanced absorption and reduced conversion into bile acids. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-mediated suppression of CYP7A1 in mice seems to be a predominant mechanism for regulation of bile acid synthesis under normal conditions and, as confirmed, able to override LXR-mediated mechanisms. Interaction between FXR- and LXR-mediated stimuli might also regulate expression of liver ABCG5/G8.
The last ten years much attention has been focused on the finding of non-steroidal ligands for steroidal nuclear receptors for reasons such as diminishing cross-reactivity to eliminate side effect profiles, changing physicochemical properties which might cause different tissue distribution profiles and altering binding modes which influence the binding of cofactors. Compounds with a selective functionality profile are referred to as selective nuclear receptor modulators (e.g., SARMs or SPRMs). In the following paragraphs non-steroidal ligands which have full or partial agonistic activity will be described for the following receptors: PR, GR, AR, LXR and FXR.
Affymetrix microarray data and Northern blot assays demonstrated that phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) was induced 6-fold when either murine or human macrophages were incubated in the presence of ligands for the liver X receptor (LXR) and the retinoid X receptor. Two functional LXR response elements (LXREs) were identified and characterized in the proximal promoter of the human PLTP gene. One LXRE corresponds to a traditional direct repeat separated by 4 bp. However, the second LXRE is novel in that it corresponds to an inverted repeat separated by 1 bp, and is identical to the farnesoid X receptor response element. These studies demonstrate that PLTP is a direct target for activated LXR and farnesoid X receptor (FXR). In addition, apolipoprotein E (apoE), a known LXR target gene in macrophages, was shown to be activated in liver cells by FXR ligands. Taken together, the current data suggest that a small number of genes that currently include PLTP, apoE, and apoC-II, are induced in macrophages by activated LXR and in liver by activated FXR.
The orphan nuclear receptors FXR and LXRalpha have become challenging targets for the discovery of new therapeutic agents. Bile acids and hydroxysterol intermediates are the respective natural ligands of these two structurally and functionally closely related receptors. Both FXR and LXRalpha; are thought to play a major role in the control of cholesterol catabolism by regulating the expression of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase, the rate limiting enzyme of bile acid synthesis. Reverse cholesterol transport might also be affected by FXR and LXR since they control the expression of PLTP and CETP, two proteins involved in the transfer of phospholipid, cholesterol and cholesteryl esters among plasma lipoproteins. A new class of potent synthetic activators of FXR, the 1,1-bisphosphonate esters, has been discovered which up regulate the Intestinal Bile Acid Binding Protein gene (I-BABP) as demonstrated for chenodeoxycholic acid, however there are no known synthetic activators yet identified for LXRalpha. The evaluation of FXR as a potential target for the development of drugs affecting plasma cholesterol can take advantage of the fact that the activators of FXR (farnesol, bile acids and the 1,1-bisphosphonate esters) have been studied in various in vitro and in vivo models. Administration of chenodeoxycholic acid to animals and man did not result in the increase in plasma cholesterol expected from a decrease in cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase expression. Like farnesol, the 1,1-bisphosphonate esters increase the rate of degradation of HMGCoA reductase and have the unexpected property of inducing hypocholesterolemia in normal animals. The natural and synthetic FXR agonists trigger differentiation, inhibit cell proliferation and are potent inducers of apoptosis. The 1,1-bisphosphonate ester SR-45023A (Apomine) is presently being developed as an antineoplastic drug.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are nuclear receptors that regulate the metabolism of cholesterol and bile acids. Despite information on the specificity of their natural ligands, oxysterols, relatively little is known about the ligand binding site in LXRs. The helix 3 region in the ligand binding domain (LBD) of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) has been implicated in ligand entry. Sequence alignment of LXRs, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and PPARs identified the corresponding helix 3 region in the LXRbeta LBD. Residues F268 and T272, which are conserved in all the aligned sequences and only in LXRs and FXR, respectively, were replaced with alanine. The effects of these mutations on ligand binding and receptor activation were examined using an in vitro ligand binding assay and a cell based reporter assay, respectively. The LXRbeta mutant F268A did not bind ligand. In contrast, conversion of T272 to alanine has no effect on ligand binding. By transiently expressing a chimeric receptor containing Escherichia coli tetracycline repressor (TetR) and LXRbeta LBD and a reporter with a TetR binding site, we show that mutant F268A lost the ability to activate transcription of the reporter, whereas mutant T272A still has an activity similar to that of the wild-type LXRbeta. These data, consistent with the findings in the in vitro ligand binding assay and our 3D modeling, are the first study that identifies a residue critical for ligand binding in LXRbeta.
Several nuclear hormone receptors involved in lipid metabolism form obligate heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and are activated by RXR agonists such as rexinoids. Animals treated with rexinoids exhibited marked changes in cholesterol balance, including inhibition of cholesterol absorption and repressed bile acid synthesis. Studies with receptor-selective agonists revealed that oxysterol receptors (LXRs) and the bile acid receptor (FXR) are the RXR heterodimeric partners that mediate these effects by regulating expression of the reverse cholesterol transporter, ABC1, and the rate-limiting enzyme of bile acid synthesis, CYP7A1, respectively. Thus, these RXR heterodimers serve as key regulators of cholesterol homeostasis by governing reverse cholesterol transport from peripheral tissues, bile acid synthesis in liver, and cholesterol absorption in intestine.
Generation of protein immunogens is often a rate-limiting step in the production of monoclonal antibodies (Mabs). Expressing domains of proteins as fusions to the baculovirus surface glycoprotein gp64 displays foreign proteins on the surface of the virion. Antigen is produced by inserting a gene fragment in-frame between the signal sequence and the mature protein domain of the gp64 nucleotide sequence. This method allows immunization with whole virus, eliminating the need for purification of target antigens. Affinity-matured Mabs to the human nuclear receptors LXRbeta and FXR have been produced using baculovirus particles displaying gp64/nuclear receptor fusion proteins as the immunizing agent. Immunizations were performed directly with pelleted virus using the Repetitive Immunization Multiple Sites (RIMMS) immunization strategy for rapid Mab production. All Mabs were identified using insect cells infected with the immunizing virus. Characterization of these antibodies shows them to be class-switched and specific for LXRbeta or FXR. Additionally, high affinity antibodies that recognize gp64 and neutralize baculovirus infection of insect cells were isolated. Use of the recombinant baculovirus gp64 display system makes possible the production of Mabs once a partial DNA sequence is known. This allows the generation of antibodies prior to the isolation of purified protein, in turn providing antibodies to facilitate purification, characterization and immunolocalization of proteins.
The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is activated by bile acids, natural agonists for this nuclear receptor. FXR-target genes play important roles in cholesterol and lipid metabolism. We have found that a series of 5beta-cholanic acid derivatives, even though without a hydroxyl group or any other substituent on the steroidal rings, can activate FXR more potently than hydroxylated bile acids in a reporter gene assay. The most potent compound among these derivatives, N-methyl-5beta-glycocholanic acid (NMGCA), induces the formation of receptor/coactivator complex in a gel-shift assay and also increases the expression of FXR target genes in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. Furthermore, in rats, NMGCA causes hypolipidemic effects as well as induction of the FXR target genes in liver. Our results suggest that NMGCA and its derivatives are important FXR activators in the study of the physiological functions of FXR and are potentially useful as pharmaceutical agents for treatment of cholesterol and lipid-related diseases.
This review describes the role of nuclear receptors in the regulation of genes involved in cholesterol transport and synthetic modulators of these receptors. Increasing the efflux of cholesterol from peripheral cells, such as lipid-laden macrophages, through a process called reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) requires HDL. Increasing the circulating levels of HDL, as well as the efficiency of the RCT process, could result in a reduction in the development of coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis. Nuclear receptors of the RXR heterodimer family have recently been shown to regulate key genes involved in HDL metabolism and reverse cholesterol transport. These include the PPARs (peroxisome proliferator activated receptors), the LXR (liver X receptor) and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR). The synthesis of specific and potent ligands for these receptors has aided in ascertaining the physiological role of these receptors as lipid sensors and the potential therapeutic utility of modulators of these receptors in dyslipidemias and cardiovascular disease.
The nuclear receptors liver X receptor (LXR) alpha and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) are positive and negative regulators of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) transcription, respectively. To clarify their roles in the regulation of CYP7A1 in mice, we investigated mRNA expression of their target genes in the livers of C57BL/6 mice fed the following five diets for 2 weeks: a standard diet, cholic acid, cholesterol, cholesterol+high fat, or an atherogenic diet (cholic acid+cholesterol+high fat). The mRNA level of ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC) A1 gene, one of LXRalpha target genes, significantly increased on the diets containing cholic acid and/or cholesterol+high fat, but not on the diet containing cholesterol alone. On the other hand, the mRNA levels of the FXR target genes ABCB11, ABCC2, and short heterodimer partner increased only on the diet containing cholic acid with or without cholesterol+high fat. Surprisingly, cholesterol alone or cholesterol+high fat did not affect CYP7A1 mRNA level, whereas cholic acid with or without cholesterol+high fat greatly reduced the level. Thus, in the atherogenic diet-fed mice, cholic acid component is needed for the FXR activation, and FXR dominantly regulates CYP7A1 transcription.
TBP-free TAF II-containing-type HAT complex subclasses, which contain hGCN5 HAT and TRRAP, appear to act as common coactivator complexes for nuclear receptors. However, their physiological significance with respect to each nuclear receptor remains to be established. To address this issue, we used hepatic cell lines (HepG2) with reduced endogenous TRRAP expression through antisense RNA expression or with overexpressed TRRAP or other major coactivators. The ligand-induced transactivation function of liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha) and farnesoid X receptor/bile acid receptor reflected TRRAP expression levels, while that of PPARgamma did not. A GST pull-down assay indicated that TRRAP contains two potential LXRalpha-interacting domains in the C-terminal and central domains. Expression of antisense TRRAP RNA in HepG2 cells abolished the ligand-induced expression of LXRalpha target genes. These results suggested that TRRAP plays an important role as a coactivator, presumably part of a complex, in lipid metabolism through regulation of the LXRalpha-mediated gene cascade in hepatic cells.
Cholesterol is essential for all mammalian cells. Cellular cholesterol requirements are met through de novo synthesis and uptake of plasma lipoproteins, homeostatic responses that are transcriptionally regulated by the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). To prevent cytotoxicity attributable to accumulation of excess cholesterol, liver X receptors (LXRs) and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), together with other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, promote the storage, transport, and catabolism of sterols and their metabolites. Members of this metabolic nuclear receptor family include receptors for oxysterols (LXRs), bile acids (CAR, FXR, and PXR), and fatty acids (PPARs). Through coordinated regulation of transcriptional programs, these nuclear receptors regulate key aspects of cellular and whole-body sterol homeostasis, including cholesterol absorption, lipoprotein synthesis and remodeling, lipoprotein uptake by peripheral tissues, reverse cholesterol transport, and bile acid synthesis and absorption. This review focuses on the nuclear receptors that are central to the lipid metabolic signaling cascades, communication between lipid metabolites and their receptors, and the role of nuclear receptors in orchestrating the complex transcriptional programs that govern cholesterol and bile acid metabolism.
Bile acids have been implicated in the development of colorectal cancers. We investigated the expression of the transcription factor regulated by bile acids, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), as well as other components of this pathway in human colorectal tumors and cell lines. The most significant changes were a decrease in FXR mRNA levels in adenomas (5-fold average) and carcinomas (10 fold average) and an increase in peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma (2-fold average). FXR was not expressed in undifferentiated colon adenocarcinoma SW480 cells and metastasis derived SW620 cells. In Caco-2 and HT-29 cells, the level of FXR expression increased with the degree of differentiation. Intestinal bile acid binding protein was activated by chenodeoxycholic acid and the synthetic FXR agonist GW4064 in Caco-2 and HT-29 but not in SW cells unless FXR was transfected. The down-regulation of the nuclear receptor FXR in colon cancer might be of clinical and pharmacological importance.
In recent years discussion of nuclear hormone receptors, transporters, and drug-metabolizing enzymes has begun to take place as our knowledge of the overlapping ligand specificity of each of these proteins has deepened. This ligand specificity is potentially valuable information for influencing future drug design, as it is important to avoid certain enzymes or transporters in order to circumvent potential drug-drug interactions. Similarly, it is critical that the induction of these same proteins via nuclear hormone receptors is avoided, as this can result in further toxicities. Using a ligand-based approach in this review we describe new and previously published computational models for PXR, CAR, FXR, LXRalpha, and LXRbeta that may help in understanding the complexity of interactions between transporters and enzymes. The value of these types of models is that they may enable us to design molecules to selectively modulate pathways for therapeutic effect and in addition predict the potential for drug interactions more reliably. Simultaneously, we might learn which came first: the transporter, the enzyme, or the nuclear hormone receptor?
Although non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is currently the most common form of chronic liver disease there is no pharmacological agent approved for its treatment. Since peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are closely associated with hepatic lipid metabolism, they seem to play important roles in NAFLD. However, the effects of PPAR agonists on steatosis that is a common pathology associated with NAFLD, remain largely controversial. In this study, the effects of various PPAR agonists, i.e. fenofibrate, bezafibrate, troglitazone, rosiglitazone, muraglitazar and tesaglitazar on oleic acid-induced steatotic HepaRG cells were investigated after a single 24-hour or 2-week repeat treatment. Lipid vesicles stained by Oil-Red O and triglycerides accumulation caused by oleic acid overload, were decreased, by up to 50%, while fatty acid oxidation was induced after 2-week co-treatment with PPAR agonists. The greatest effects on reduction of steatosis were obtained with the dual PPARα/γ agonist muraglitazar. Such improvement of steatosis was associated with up-regulation of genes related to fatty acid oxidation activity and down-regulation of many genes involved in lipogenesis. Moreover, modulation of expression of some nuclear receptor genes, such as FXR, LXRα and CAR, which are potent actors in the control of lipogenesis, was observed and might explain repression of de novo lipogenesis.
Altogether, our in vitro data on steatotic HepaRG cells treated with PPAR agonists correlated well with clinical investigations, bringing a proof of concept that drug-induced reversal of steatosis in human can be evaluated in in vitro before conducting long-term and costly in vivo studies in animals and patients.
Excessive inorganic phosphate (Pi) intake and hyperphosphatemia have both been speculated to be risk factors for cardiovascular disease and hypercholesterolemia, and dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism can lead to atherosclerosis. However, the relationship between Pi and cholesterol metabolism has not been investigated in detail. Our recent study showed that triiodothyronine can induce both hyperphosphatemia and hypocholesterolemia in mice. We therefore hypothesized a possible linkage between Pi and cholesterol metabolism. In this study, we investigated the effects of dietary Pi intake on cholesterol metabolism in mice. Mice were divided into 4 groups, which were fed diets containing 1.2% or 0.1% Pi and with or without 2% cholesterol (Pi-sufficient, Pi-restricted, Pi-sufficient + Chol, and Pi-restricted + Chol), for 12 days. Inorganic phosphate-restricted mice exhibited significantly higher liver weights than did Pi-sufficient mice. Interestingly, dietary Pi restriction significantly increased high-cholesterol diet-induced hepatic lipid accumulation. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that dietary Pi restriction decreased expression of hepatic genes involved in cholesterol metabolism and fatty acid biosynthesis. In addition, hepatic messenger RNA levels of several transcription factors including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and liver X receptor were markedly decreased by Pi restriction. Furthermore, plasma lipid and lipoprotein profile analysis showed that dietary Pi restriction reduced susceptibility to high-cholesterol diet-induced hyperlipidemia. Importantly, we found that there was a significant negative correlation between plasma levels of Pi and total cholesterol. These results suggest that dietary Pi plays an important role in the development of fatty liver disease and hyperlipidemia induced by a high-cholesterol diet through regulation of lipid metabolism-related gene expression in the liver. 
Walnuts contain bioactive molecules that may contribute to their beneficial effects, including alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and phytosterols. In these studies, extracts of walnut, purified compounds, or postprandial serum were examined for effects on breast cancer cell proliferation and gene expression. Extracts derived from walnut oil decreased proliferation of MCF-7 cells, as did ALA and β-sitosterol. The gene expression response of ALA in the mouse breast cancer cell line TM2H indicates this molecule has multiple cellular targets with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) target genes, liver X receptor (LXR), and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) target genes being affected. In transactivation assays, walnut oil extracts increased activity of FXR to a greater extent than the other tested nuclear receptors. When examined separately, walnut components ALA and β-sitosterol were the most efficacious activators of FXR. When serum from individuals fed walnut components were applied to MCF-7 cells, there was a correlation between body mass index and breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro. Taken together, these data support an effect of walnut and its bioactive constituents on mammary epithelial cells and that multiple molecular targets may be involved.
Adipocytes from mesenteric white adipose tissue amplify the inflammatory response and participate in inflammation-driven immune dysfunction in Crohn's disease by releasing proinflammatory mediators. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR)-α and -γ, pregnane x receptor (PXR), farnesoid x receptor (FXR) and liver x-receptor (LXR) are ligand-activated nuclear receptor that provide counter-regulatory signals to dysregulated immunity and modulates adipose tissue.
To investigate the expression and function of nuclear receptors in intestinal and adipose tissues in a rodent model of colitis and mesenteric fat from Crohn's patients and to investigate their modulation by probiotics.
Colitis was induced by TNBS administration. Mice were administered vehicle or VSL#3, daily for 10 days. Abdominal fat explants obtained at surgery from five Crohn's disease patients and five patients with colon cancer were cultured with VSL#3 medium.
Probiotic administration attenuated development of signs and symptoms of colitis, reduced colonic expression of TNFα, IL-6 and IFNγ and reserved colonic downregulation of PPARγ, PXR and FXR caused by TNBS. Mesenteric fat depots isolated from TNBS-treated animals had increased expression of inflammatory mediators along with PPARγ, FXR, leptin and adiponectin. These changes were prevented by VSL#3. Creeping fat and mesenteric adipose tissue from Crohn's patients showed a differential expression of PPARγ and FXR with both tissue expressing high levels of leptin. Exposure of these tissues to VSL#3 medium abrogates leptin release.
Mesenteric adipose tissue from rodent colitis and Crohn's disease is metabolically active and shows inflammation-driven regulation of PPARγ, FXR and leptin. Probiotics correct the inflammation-driven metabolic dysfunction.
In the previous experiment, we found that there was a different response between E3 rats and DA.1U rats to high-fat-diet-induced metabolic syndrome (HFD-MetS). The aim of this study was to explore the cause and molecular mechanism of the genetic difference in susceptibility to metabolic syndrome in E3 rats as compared with DA.1U rats. Firstly, a 12-week HFD-MetS model in E3 and DA.1U rats was carried out and assessed. Then, the expression of key insulin signaling molecules, metabolic nuclear receptors, metabolic key enzymes and histone deacetylases (Hdacs) was determined by different methods. Finally, the effects of overexpression and disruption of Hdac3 on metabolic nuclear receptors were analyzed in CBRH-7919 cells and primarily-hepatic cells from DA.1U and E3 rats. We found that E3 rats were susceptible, while DA.1U rats were resisted to HFD-MetS. The expression of liver X receptor α,β (LXR-α,β), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) and cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) increased markedly in DA.1U rat liver, whereas they decreased significantly in E3 rats. The expression of Hdac3 increased by HFD treatment in both E3 and DA.1U rat livers, but the constitutive Hdac3 expression was lower in DA.IU rat liver than in E3 rat liver. Importantly, overexpression of Hdac3 could downregulate the expression of LXR-α, PPAR-γ and CYP7A1 in both CBRH-7919 cells and primarily cultured hepatic cells from DA.IU rats. On the contrary, disruption of Hdac3 by shRNA upregulated the expression of LXR-α, PPAR-γ and CYP7A1 in both CBRH-7919 cells and primarily cultured hepatic cells from E3 rats. The results suggested that a high constitutive expression of Hdac3 inhibiting the expression of PPAR-γ, LXR-α and CYP7A1 in liver contributes to HFD-MetS in E3 rats.
Vascular calcification is recognized as an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality, particularly in subjects with chronic kidney disease. However, the pathways by which dysregulation of lipid and mineral metabolism simultaneously occur in this particular population remain unclear. We have shown that activation of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) blocks mineralization of bovine calcifying vascular cells (CVCs) and in ApoE knock-out mice with 5/6 nephrectomy. In contrast to FXR, this study showed that liver X receptor (LXR) activation by LXR agonists and adenovirus-mediated LXR overexpression by VP16-LXRα and VP16-LXRβ accelerated mineralization of CVCs. Conversely, LXR inhibition by dominant negative (DN) forms of LXRα and LXRβ reduced calcium content in CVCs. The regulation of mineralization by FXR and LXR agonists was highly correlated with changes in lipid accumulation, fatty acid synthesis, and the expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1). The rate of lipogenesis in CVCs through the SREBP-1c dependent pathway was reduced by FXR activation, but increased by LXR activation. SREBP-1c overexpression augmented mineralization in CVCs, whereas SREBP-1c DN inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization induced by LXR agonists. LXR and SREBP-1c activations increased, whereas FXR activation decreased, saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids derived from lipogenesis. In addition, we found that stearate markedly promoted mineralization of CVCs as compared with other fatty acids. Furthermore, inhibition of either acetyl-CoA carboxylase or acyl-CoA synthetase reduced mineralization of CVCs, whereas inhibition of stearoyl-CoA desaturase induced mineralization. Therefore, a stearate metabolite derived from lipogenesis might be a risk factor for the development of vascular calcification.
The large and increasing number of chemicals released into the environment demands more efficient and cost-effective approaches for assessing environmental chemical toxicity. The U.S. Tox21 program has responded to this challenge by proposing alternative strategies for toxicity testing, among which the quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) paradigm has been adopted as the primary tool for generating data from screening large chemical libraries using a wide spectrum of assays.
The goal of this study was to develop methods to evaluate the data generated from these assays to guide future assay selection and prioritization for the Tox21 program.
We examined the data from the Tox21 pilot-phase collection of approximately 3,000 environmental chemicals profiled in qHTS format against a panel of 10 human nuclear receptors (AR, ERα, FXR, GR, LXRβ, PPARγ, PPARδ, RXRα, TRβ, and VDR) for reproducibility, concordance of biological activity profiles with sequence homology of the receptor ligand binding domains, and structure-activity relationships.
We determined the assays to be appropriate in terms of biological relevance. We found better concordance for replicate compounds for the agonist-mode than for the antagonist-mode assays, likely due to interference of cytotoxicity in the latter assays. This exercise also enabled us to formulate data-driven strategies for discriminating true signals from artifacts, and to prioritize assays based on data quality.
The results demonstrate the feasibility of qHTS to identify the potential for environmentally relevant chemicals to interact with key toxicity pathways related to human disease induction.
The liver X receptors (LXRs) and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) have been identified in human platelets. Ligands of these receptors have been shown to have nongenomic inhibitory effects on platelet activation by platelet agonists. This, however, seems contradictory with the platelet hyper-reactivity that is associated with several pathological conditions that are associated with increased circulating levels of molecules that are LXR and FXR ligands, such as hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity.
We, therefore, investigated whether ligands for the LXR and FXR receptors were capable of priming platelets to the activated state without stimulation by platelet agonists. Treatment of platelets with ligands for LXR and FXR converted platelets to the procoagulant state, with increases in phosphatidylserine exposure, platelet swelling, reduced membrane integrity, depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane, and microparticle release observed. Additionally, platelets also displayed features associated with coated platelets such as P-selectin exposure, fibrinogen binding, fibrin generation that is supported by increased serine protease activity, and inhibition of integrin αIIbβ3. LXR and FXR ligand-induced formation of coated platelets was found to be dependent on both reactive oxygen species and intracellular calcium mobilization, and for FXR ligands, this process was found to be dependent on cyclophilin D.
We conclude that treatment with LXR and FXR ligands initiates coated platelet formation, which is thought to support coagulation but results in desensitization to platelet stimuli through inhibition of αIIbβ3 consistent with their ability to inhibit platelet function and stable thrombus formation in vivo.
Aquaporin-2 (AQP2) is a vasopressin-regulated water channel responsible for regulating water reabsorption through the apical plasma membrane of the principal cells of renal collecting ducts. It has been found that dysregulation and dysfunction of AQP2 cause many disorders related to water balance in people and animals, including polyuria and dilutional hyponatremia. Classically, AQP2 mRNA and protein expression and its membrane translocation are regulated by systemic vasopressin involving short-term regulation of AQP2 trafficking to and from the apical plasma membrane and long-term regulation of the total amount of the AQP2 protein in the cell. Recently, increasing evidence has demonstrated that collecting duct AQP2 expression and membrane translocation are also under the control of many other local factors, especially nuclear receptors. Here, we briefly review the progress of studies in this area and discuss the role of nuclear receptors in the regulation of water reabsorption via affecting AQP2 expression and function. 
Numerous studies have suggested that hyperlipidemia is closely linked to cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible antihyperlipidemia mechanism of HU (high sulfate content of ulvan) in high-cholesterol fed rats. Wistar rats were made hyperlipidemic by feeding with a high-cholesterol diet. HU was administered to these hyperlipidemia rats for 30 days. Lipid levels and the mRNA expressions of FXR, LXR and PPARγ in liver were measured after 30 days of treatment. In the HU-treated groups, the middle dosage group of male rats (total cholesterol (TC): p &lt; 0.01) and the low-dosage group of female rats (TC, LDL-C: p &lt; 0.01) showed stronger activity with respect to antihyperlipidemia. Moreover, some HU groups could upregulate the mRNA expression of FXR and PPARγ and downregulate the expression of LXR. For the male rats, compared with the hyperlipidemia group, the middle dosage HU had the most pronounced effect on increasing the mRNA levels of FXR (p &lt; 0.01); low- and high-dosage HU showed a significant inhibition of the mRNA levels of LXR (p &lt; 0.01). All HU female groups could upregulate the mRNA expression of PPARγ in a concentration-dependent manner. In summary, HU could improve lipid profiles through upregulation of FXR and PPARγ and downregulation of LXR. 
More than 1·4 billion individuals are overweight or obese worldwide. While complications often require therapeutic intervention, data regarding the impact of obesity on drug disposition are scarce. As the influence of diet-induced obesity on drug transport and metabolic pathways is currently unclear, the objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of high fat feeding for 13 weeks in female Sprague-Dawley rats on the hepatic expression of the nuclear receptors pregnane X receptor (PXR), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), liver X receptor (LXR) and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and several of their target genes. We hypothesised that high fat feeding would alter the gene expression of major hepatic transporters through a dysregulation of the expression of the nuclear receptors. The results demonstrated that, along with a significant increase in body fat and weight, a high-fat diet (HFD) induced a significant 2-fold increase in the expression of PXR as well as a 2-, 5- and 2·5-fold increase in the hepatic expression of the PXR target genes Abcc2, Abcb1a and Cyp3a2, respectively (P&lt; 0·05). The expression levels of FXR were significantly increased in rats fed a HFD in addition to the increase in the expression levels of FXR target genes Abcb11 and Abcb4. The expression levels of both LXRα and LXRβ were slightly but significantly increased in rats fed a HFD, and the expression levels of their target genes Abca1 and Abcg5, but not Abcg8, were significantly increased. The expression of the nuclear receptor CAR was not significantly altered between the groups. This suggests that a HFD may induce changes in the hepatobiliary transport and metabolism of endogenous and exogenous compounds. 
Increased fructose consumption causes dyslipidemia and fatty liver in postmenopausal women, both independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease. This study explored the potential mechanisms by which amla (Emblica officinalis) reduced hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia and prevented fatty liver in a fructose-fed, ovariectomized rat model of menopause.
Sham-operated and ovariectomized rats were put on a chow or high fructose diet. They were further divided into groups with or without amla. After 18 weeks of treatment, livers were harvested and subjected to Western blot and histological analyses.
In all groups, amla increased the protein expression of liver farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and liver X receptor (LXR), key proteins involved in lipid metabolism. Fructose-fed rats developed fatty liver and amla prevented this. Here amla produced an exceptional rise in LXR and insulin-induced gene-2 (Insig-2) which prevented the maturation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 and steroyl CoA desaturase-1, responsible for triglyceride synthesis. Amla also increased the protein expression of ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), involved in high density lipoprotein (HDL) synthesis as well as low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) responsible for uptake of LDL cholesterol. Besides this, amla increased the protein expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα) involved in β oxidation of fatty acids.
Amla increased the protein expression of liver FXR, LXRα, PPARα and their downstream proteins Insig-2, ABCA1 and LDLR. This property of amla to modulate some of the key proteins involved in lipid metabolism promises its usefulness as a preventive agent for dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis.
1,2-unsaturated pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PA) are plant metabolites predominantly occurring in the plant families Asteraceae and Boraginaceae. Acute and chronic PA poisoning causes severe hepatotoxicity. So far, the molecular mechanisms of PA toxicity are not well understood. To analyze its mode of action, primary human hepatocytes were exposed to a non-cytotoxic dose of 100 μM of four structurally different PA: echimidine, heliotrine, senecionine, senkirkine. Changes in mRNA expression were analyzed by a whole genome microarray. Employing cut-off values with a |fold change| of 2 and a q-value of 0.01, data analysis revealed numerous changes in gene expression. In total, 4556, 1806, 3406 and 8623 genes were regulated by echimidine, heliotrine, senecione and senkirkine, respectively. 1304 genes were identified as commonly regulated. PA affected pathways related to cell cycle regulation, cell death and cancer development. The transcription factors TP53, MYC, NFκB and NUPR1 were predicted to be activated upon PA treatment. Furthermore, gene expression data showed a considerable interference with lipid metabolism and bile acid flow. The associated transcription factors FXR, LXR, SREBF1/2, and PPARα/γ/δ were predicted to be inhibited. In conclusion, though structurally different, all four PA significantly regulated a great number of genes in common. This proposes similar molecular mechanisms, although the extent seems to differ between the analyzed PA as reflected by the potential hepatotoxicity and individual PA structure.
Dietary factors are likely an important determinant of gallstone development, and difficulty in adapting to lithogenic diets may predispose individuals to gallstone formation. Identification of the critical early diet-dependent metabolic markers of adaptability is urgently needed to prevent gallstone development. We focus on the interaction between diet and genes, and the resulting potential to influence gallstone risk by dietary modification.
Expression levels of hepatic protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms were determined in lithogenic diet-fed mice, and the relationship of hepatic cholesterol content and PKCβ expression and the effect of hepatic PKCβ overexpression on intracellular signaling pathways were analyzed.
Lithogenic diet feeding resulted in a striking induction of hepatic PKCβ and PKCδ mRNA and protein levels, which preceded the appearance of biliary cholesterol crystals. Unlike PKCβ deficiency, global PKCδ deficiency did not influence lithogenic diet-induced gallstone formation. Interestingly, a deficiency of apolipoprotein E abrogated the diet-induced hepatic PKCβ expression, whereas a deficiency of liver X receptor-α further potentiated the induction, suggesting a potential link between the degree of hepatic PKCβ induction and the intracellular cholesterol content. Furthermore, our results suggest that PKCβ is a physiologic repressor of ileum basal fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15) expression and activity of hepatic proto-oncogene serine/threonine-protein kinase Raf-1/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (Raf-1/MEK/ERK1/2) cascade proteins, and the complex interactions between these pathways may determine the degree of hepatic ERK1/2 activation, a potent suppressor of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase and sterol 12α-hydroxylase expression. We found that PKCβ regulated Raf-1 activity by modulating the inhibitory Raf-1Ser259 phosphorylation.
Our results demonstrate a novel interaction between the hepatic PKCβ/Raf-1 regulatory axis and ileum PKCβ/FGF15/ERK axis, which could modulate the bile lithogenecity of dietary lipids. The data presented are consistent with a two-pronged mechanism by which intestine and liver PKCβ signaling converges on the liver ERK1/2 pathway to control the hepatic adaptive response to a lithogenic diet. Elucidating the impact and the underlying mechanism(s) of PKCβ action could help us understand how different types of dietary fat modify the risk of gallstone formation, information that could help to identify novel targets for therapeutic approaches to combat this disease.
Preeclampsia is one of the leading causes of fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Preterm babies of mothers with early onset preeclampsia (EOPE) are at higher risks for various diseases later on in life, including cardiovascular diseases. We hypothesized that genome-wide epigenetic alterations occur in cord blood DNAs in association with EOPE and conducted a case control study to compare the genome-scale methylome differences in cord blood DNAs between 12 EOPE-associated and 8 normal births.
Bioinformatics analysis of methylation data from the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip shows a genome-scale hypomethylation pattern in EOPE, with 51,486 hypomethylated CpG sites and 12,563 hypermethylated sites (adjusted P &lt;0.05). A similar trend also exists in the proximal promoters (TSS200) associated with protein-coding genes. Using summary statistics on the CpG sites in TSS200 regions, promoters of 643 and 389 genes are hypomethylated and hypermethylated, respectively. Promoter-based differential methylation (DM) analysis reveals that genes in the farnesoid X receptor and liver X receptor (FXR/LXR) pathway are enriched, indicating dysfunction of lipid metabolism in cord blood cells. Additional biological functional alterations involve inflammation, cell growth, and hematological system development. A two-way ANOVA analysis among coupled cord blood and amniotic membrane samples shows that a group of genes involved in inflammation, lipid metabolism, and proliferation are persistently differentially methylated in both tissues, including IL12B, FAS, PIK31, and IGF1.
These findings provide, for the first time, evidence of prominent genome-scale DNA methylation modifications in cord blood DNAs associated with EOPE. They may suggest a connection between inflammation and lipid dysregulation in EOPE-associated newborns and a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases later in adulthood.
Resistance to chemotherapy is a major limitation of cancer treatments with several molecular mechanisms involved, in particular altered local drug metabolism and detoxification process. The role of drug metabolism and clearance system has not been satisfactorily investigated in Multiple Myeloma (MM), a malignant plasma cell cancer for which a majority of patients escapes treatment. The expression of 350 genes encoding for uptake carriers, xenobiotic receptors, phase I and II Drug Metabolizing Enzymes (DMEs) and efflux transporters was interrogated in MM cells (MMCs) of newly-diagnosed patients in relation to their event free survival. MMCs of patients with a favourable outcome have an increased expression of genes coding for xenobiotic receptors (RXRα, LXR, CAR and FXR) and accordingly of their gene targets, influx transporters and phase I/II DMEs. On the contrary, MMCs of patients with unfavourable outcome displayed a global down regulation of genes coding for xenobiotic receptors and the downstream detoxification genes but had a high expression of genes coding for ARNT and Nrf2 pathways and ABC transporters. Altogether, these data suggests ARNT and Nrf2 pathways could be involved in MM primary resistance and that targeting RXRα, PXR, LXR and FXR through agonists could open new perspectives to alleviate or reverse MM drug resistance. 
Orally delivered small-molecule therapeutics are metabolized in the liver and intestine by phase I and phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs), and transport proteins coordinate drug influx (phase 0) and drug/drug-metabolite efflux (phase III). Genes involved in drug metabolism and disposition are induced by xenobiotic-activated nuclear receptors (NRs), i.e. PXR (pregnane X receptor) and CAR (constitutive androstane receptor), and by the 1α, 25-dihydroxy vitamin D3-activated vitamin D receptor (VDR), due to transactivation of xenobiotic-response elements (XREs) present in phase 0-III genes. Additional NRs, like HNF4-α, FXR, LXR-α play important roles in drug metabolism in certain settings, such as in relation to cholesterol and bile acid metabolism. The phase I enzymes CYP3A4/A5, CYP2D6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2A6, CYP2J2, and CYP2E1 metabolize &gt;90% of all prescription drugs, and phase II conjugation of hydrophilic functional groups (with/without phase I modification) facilitates drug clearance. The conjugation step is mediated by broad-specificity transferases like UGTs, SULTs, GSTs. This review delves into our current understanding of PXR/CAR/VDR-mediated regulation of DME and transporter expression, as well as effects of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and epigenome (specified by promoter methylation, histone modification, microRNAs, long non coding RNAs) on the expression of PXR/CAR/VDR and phase 0-III mediators, and their impacts on variable drug response. Therapeutic agents that target epigenetic regulation and the molecular basis and consequences (overdosing, underdosing, or beneficial outcome) of drug-drug/drug-food/drug-herb interactions are also discussed. Precision medicine requires understanding of a drug's impact on DME and transporter activity and their NR-regulated expression in order to achieve optimal drug efficacy without adverse drug reactions. In future drug screening, new tools such as humanized mouse models and microfluidic organs-on-chips, which mimic the physiology of a multicellular environment, will likely replace the current cell-based workflow.
Nuclear receptors (NRs) are major pharmacological targets that allow an access to the mechanisms controlling gene regulation. As such, some NRs were identified as biological targets of active compounds contained in herbal remedies found in traditional medicines. We aim here to review this expanding literature by focusing on the informative articles regarding the mechanisms of action of traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). We exemplified well-characterized TCM action mediated by NR such as steroid receptors (ER, GR, AR), metabolic receptors (PPAR, LXR, FXR, PXR, CAR) and RXR. We also provided, when possible, examples from other traditional medicines. From these, we draw a parallel between TCMs and phytoestrogens or endocrine disrupting chemicals also acting via NR. We define common principle of action and highlight the potential and limits of those compounds. TCMs, by finely tuning physiological reactions in positive and negative manners, could act, in a subtle but efficient way, on NR sensors and their transcriptional network. 
Our goal in this study aims to explain the polypharmacological mechanism at the molecular level responsible for the effectiveness of a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescription FTZ to treat hyperlipidemia and related disease.
By MDL(®) ISIS_Base 2.5, we constructed a compound database based on the FTZ constituents, which were detected in the rat serum after oral administration of the TCM through ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadruple-time-of-flight mass-spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS) method. After validation of the virtual docking system, we used molecular screening by LigandFit which is a computational method for the shape-directed rapid docking of ligands to target protein active sites, to investigate the interactions between the components in database and lipid-modulating targets in the liver.
In the prescription FTZ ingredients, there were sixteen constituents including jatrorrhizine, etc. showed potential effects towards the hyperlipidemia-related targets: HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR), squalene synthase (SQS), oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC), cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), liver X receptor (LXR), farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARα and PPARγ). Among the eight herbs in prescription FTZ, Rhizoma Coptidis (RC) plays the most important role in whole effect from FTZ on hyperlipidemia related disease.
Our research demonstrated that Chinese medicine formula FTZ has multi-target synergistic effect on hyperlipidemia and suggests the pharmacodynamic material basis could be jatrorrhizine, berberrubine, berberine and salidroside.
In addition to their role in growth, cellular differentiation and homeostasis Retinoid X Receptors (RXR) regulate multiple physiological and metabolic pathways in various organs that have beneficial glucose and lipid (cholesterol) lowering, insulin sensitizing and anti-obesity effects. Rexinoids, compounds that specifically binds and activate RXR, are therefore considered as potential therapeutics for treating metabolic syndrome. Apparently many of the rexinoids developed in the past increased triglycerides, caused hepatomegaly and also suppressed the thyroid hormone axis. The aim of this study is to evaluate CNX-013-B2, a potent and highly selective rexinoid, for its potential to treat multiple risk factors of the metabolic syndrome.
CNX-013-B2 was selected in a screening system designed to identify compounds that selectively activated only a chosen sub-set of heterodimer partners of RXR of importance to treat insulin resistance. Male C57BL/6j mice (n = 10) on high fat diet (HFD) and 16 week old ob/ob mice (n = 8) were treated orally with CNX-013-B2 (10 mg/kg twice daily) or vehicle for 10 weeks and 4 weeks respectively. Measurement of plasma glucose, triglyceride, cholesterol including LDL-C, glycerol, free fatty acids, feed intake, body weight, oral glucose tolerance and non-shivering thermogenesis were performed at selected time points. After study termination such measurements as organ weight, triglyceride content, mRNA levels, protein phosphorylation along with histological analysis were performed.
CNX-013-B2 selectively activates PPARs- α, β/δ and γ and modulates activity of LXR, THR and FXR. In ob/ob mice a significant reduction of 25% in fed glucose (p &lt; 0.001 ), a 14% (p &lt; 0.05) reduction in serum total cholesterol and 18% decrease (p &lt; 0.01) in LDL-C and in DIO mice a reduction of 12% (p &lt; 0.01 ) in fasting glucose, 20% in fed triglyceride (p &lt; 0.01) and total cholesterol (p &lt; 0.001) levels, coupled with enhanced insulin sensitivity, cold induced thermogenesis and 7% reduction in body weight were observed.
CNX-013-B2 is an orally bio available selective rexinoid that can be used as a novel therapeutic agent for management of multiple risk factors of the metabolic syndrome without the risk of side effects reported to be associated with rexinoids.
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is the most prevalent metabolic disease, and many people are suffering from its complications driven by hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia. Nuclear receptors (NRs) are ligand-inducible transcription factors that mediate changes to metabolic pathways within the body. As metabolic regulators, the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and the liver X receptor (LXR) play key roles in the pathogenesis of T2D, which remains to be clarified in detail. Here we review the recent progress concerning the physiological and pathophysiological roles of FXRs and LXRs in the regulation of bile acid, lipid and glucose metabolism and the implications in T2D, taking into account that these two nuclear receptors are potential pharmaceutical targets for the treatment of T2D and its complications. 
Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent environmental toxicants, present in 100% of U.S. adults and dose-dependently associated with obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). PCBs are predicted to interact with receptors previously implicated in xenobiotic/energy metabolism and NAFLD. These receptors include the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), pregnane xenobiotic receptor (PXR), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), liver-X-receptor (LXRα), and farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR). This study evaluates Aroclor 1260, a PCB mixture with congener composition mimicking that of human adipose tissue, and selected congeners, as potential ligands for these receptors utilizing human hepatoma-derived (HepG2) and primate-derived (COS-1) cell lines, and primary human hepatocytes. Aroclor 1260 (20 μg/ml) activated AhR, and PCB 126, a minor component, was a potent inducer. Aroclor 1260 activated PXR in a simple concentration-dependent manner at concentrations ≥10 μg/ml. Among the congeners tested, PCBs 138, 149, 151, 174, 183, 187, and 196 activated PXR. Aroclor 1260 activated CAR2 and CAR3 variants at lower concentrations and antagonize CAR2 activation by the CAR agonist, CITCO, at higher concentrations (≥20 μg/ml). Additionally, Aroclor 1260 induced CYP2B6 in primary hepatocytes. At subtoxic doses, Aroclor 1260 did not activate LXR or FXR and had no effect on LXR- or FXR-dependent induction by the agonists T0901317 or GW4064, respectively. Aroclor 1260 (20 μg/ml) suppressed PPARα activation by the agonist nafenopin, although none of the congeners tested demonstrated significant inhibition. The results suggest that Aroclor 1260 is a human AhR, PXR and CAR3 agonist, a mixed agonist/antagonist for CAR2, and an antagonist for human PPARα. 
Several nuclear receptors regulate diverse metabolic functions that impact on critical biological processes, such as development, differentiation, cellular regeneration, and neoplastic conversion. In the liver, some members of the nuclear receptor family, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), liver X receptor (LXR), pregnane X receptor (PXR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and others, regulate energy homeostasis, the formation and excretion of bile acids, and detoxification of xenobiotics. Excess energy burning resulting from increases in fatty acid oxidation systems in liver generates reactive oxygen species, and the resulting oxidative damage influences liver regeneration and liver tumor development. These nuclear receptors are important sensors of exogenous activators as well as receptor-specific endogenous ligands. In this regard, gene knockout mouse models revealed that some lipid-metabolizing enzymes generate PPARα-activating ligands, while others such as ACOX1 (fatty acyl-CoA oxidase1) inactivate these endogenous PPARα activators. In the absence of ACOX1, the unmetabolized ACOX1 substrates cause sustained activation of PPARα, and the resulting increase in energy burning leads to hepatocarcinogenesis. Ligand-activated nuclear receptors recruit the multisubunit Mediator complex for RNA polymerase II-dependent gene transcription. Evidence indicates that the Med1 subunit of the Mediator is essential for PPARα, PPARγ, CAR, and GR signaling in liver. Med1 null hepatocytes fail to respond to PPARα activators in that these cells do not show induction of peroxisome proliferation and increases in fatty acid oxidation enzymes. Med1-deficient hepatocytes show no increase in cell proliferation and do not give rise to liver tumors. Identification of nuclear receptor-specific coactivators and Mediator subunits should further our understanding of the complexities of metabolic diseases associated with increased energy combustion in liver. 
Cytosolic sulfotransferases (SULTs) catalyze the sulfate conjugation of a myriad of endogenous and xenobiotic substrates. Among the 13 human SULTs, little is known regarding regulation of the SULT1C subfamily. We evaluated the effects of a panel of transcription factor activators on levels of SULT1C mRNA (1C2 and 1C3) and protein (1C2) in LS180 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells. Treatment with 3-[3-[N-(2-chloro-3-trifluoromethylbenzyl)-(2,2-diphenylethyl)amino]propyloxy]phenylacetic acid hydrochloride [GW3965, liver X receptor (LXR) activator], 3-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-4-(3'-carboxy-2-chlorostilben-4-yl)oxymethyl-5-isopropylisoxazole [GW4064, farnesoid X receptor (FXR)], or rifampicin [pregnane X receptor (PXR)] moderately (≤2-fold) increased both SULT1C2 and SULT1C3 mRNA levels. 1α,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3, vitamin D receptor (VDR)] selectively upregulated SULT1C2, whereas ciprofibrate [peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα)], rosiglitazone (PPARγ), and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin [aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)] selectively increased SULT1C3 mRNA levels. SULT1C2 protein content was strongly increased by 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment and moderately increased by GW3965, GW4064, and rifampicin. To evaluate SULT1C2 transcriptional regulation, treatment effects were determined on reporter activity from transfected constructs containing ∼10 kb of the SULT1C2 gene. Treatment with GW3965, GW4064, or 1,25(OH)2D3 increased reporter activity ∼2-, 5-, and 5.5-fold, respectively, from a construct containing mostly intron 1 of the SULT1C2 gene. Expression of AhR, LXRα, LXRβ, PPARα, PPARγ, PXR, and VDR was confirmed in LS180 cells using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction; however, FXR expression was negligible, suggesting that GW4064 increased SULT1C expression through an FXR-independent mechanism. Collectively, our findings are the first to characterize the regulation of human SULT1C2 and SULT1C3 expression by several transcription factor activators. Further, we determined that responsive regions for LXR and VDR are likely contained within intron 1 of the SULT1C2 gene. 
The structure-activity relationships of T0901317 analogs were explored as RORc inverse agonists using the principles of property- and structure-based drug design. An X-ray co-crystal structure of T0901317 and RORc was obtained and provided molecular insight into why T0901317 functioned as an inverse agonist of RORc; whereas, the same ligand functioned as an agonist of FXR, LXR, and PXR. The structural data was also used to design inhibitors with improved RORc biochemical and cellular activities. The improved inhibitors possessed enhanced selectivity profiles (rationalized using the X-ray crystallographic data) against other nuclear receptors. 
Morphogenetic signaling by small terpenoid hormones is a common feature of both vertebrate and invertebrate development. Most attention on insect developmental signaling by small terpenoids has focused on signaling by juvenile hormone through bHLH-PAS proteins (e.g., the MET protein), especially as that signaling axis intersects with ecdysteroid action through the receptor EcR. However, a series of endocrine and pharmacological studies on pupariation in cyclorrhaphous Diptera have remained persistently refractory to explanation with the above two-axis model. Recently, the terpenoid compound methyl farnesoate has been physicochemically demonstrated to exist in circulation at physiological concentrations, in several mecopterid orders, including Diptera. In addition, it has also been recently demonstrated that the receptor to which methyl farnesoate binds with nanomolar affinity (ultraspiracle, an ortholog of retinoid X receptor) requires a functioning ligand binding pocket to sustain the morphogenetic transition to puparium formation. This review evaluates endocrine and pharmacological evidence for developmental pathways reached by methyl farnesoate action, and assesses the participation of the retinoid X receptor ligand pocket in signal transduction to those developmental endpoints.
Parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease (PNALD) is a serious complication of PN in infants who do not tolerate enteral feedings, especially those with acquired or congenital intestinal diseases. Yet, the mechanisms underlying PNALD are poorly understood. It has been suggested that a component of soy oil (SO) lipid emulsions in PN solutions, such as plant sterols (phytosterols), may be responsible for PNALD, and that use of fish oil (FO)-based lipid emulsions may be protective. We used a mouse model of PNALD combining PN infusion with intestinal injury to demonstrate that SO-based PN solution causes liver damage and hepatic macrophage activation and that PN solutions that are FO-based or devoid of all lipids prevent these processes. We have furthermore demonstrated that a factor in the SO lipid emulsions, stigmasterol, promotes cholestasis, liver injury, and liver macrophage activation in this model and that this effect may be mediated through suppression of canalicular bile transporter expression (Abcb11/BSEP, Abcc2/MRP2) via antagonism of the nuclear receptors Fxr and Lxr, and failure of up-regulation of the hepatic sterol exporters (Abcg5/g8/ABCG5/8). This study provides experimental evidence that plant sterols in lipid emulsions are a major factor responsible for PNALD and that the absence or reduction of plant sterols is one of the mechanisms for hepatic protection in infants receiving FO-based PN or lipid minimization PN treatment. Modification of lipid constituents in PN solutions is thus a promising strategy to reduce incidence and severity of PNALD. 
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in critical patients. Proteomic analysis of plasma from individuals with ARDS could elucidate new biomarkers for diagnosis and pathophysiology and identify potential ARDS treatment targets. In this study, we recruited 26 patients (15 controls, 11 ARDS). The ARDS group was subdivided into two groups depending on the type of injury: (1) direct lung injury (AD) and (2) indirect lung injury (AI). Using iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation) analysis, we identified 2429 peptides representing 132 plasma proteins. Among these, 16 were differentially expressed in ARDS patients, including 11 overlapping proteins between the AI and AD group and 5 AI-specific proteins. Protein annotation revealed that lipid transport and complement activation were significantly enriched in the biological process category, and lipid transporter, transporter, and serine-type peptidase activities were significantly enriched in the molecular function category. IPA (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis) signaling pathways revealed that the overlapping proteins were involved in a variety of signaling pathways, including those underlying acute phase response; liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor (LXR/RXR) and farnesoid X (FXR)/RXR activation; clathrin-mediated endocytosis; atherosclerosis; interleukin (IL)-12; complement system; and cytokine, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen species production in macrophages. We present the first proteomic analysis of ARDS plasma using the iTRAQ approach. Our data provide new biomarker candidates and shed light on potential pathological mechanisms underlying ARDS. 
Pathological accumulation of 27-carbon intermediates or end-products of cholesterol metabolism, named oxysterols, may contribute to the onset and especially to the development of major chronic diseases in which inflammation, but also oxidative damage and to a certain extent cell death, are hallmarks and primary mechanisms of progression. Indeed, certain oxysterols exercise strong pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory effects at concentrations detectable in the lesions typical of atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases, age-related macular degeneration, and other pathological conditions characterized by altered cholesterol uptake and/or metabolism. 
The eyes and skin are obvious retinoid target organs. Vitamin A deficiency causes night blindness and retinoids are widely used to treat acne and psoriasis. However, more than 90% of total body retinol is stored in liver stellate cells. In addition, hepatocytes produce the largest amount of retinol binding protein and cellular retinoic acid binding protein to mobilize retinol from the hepatic storage pool and deliver retinol to its receptors, respectively. Furthermore, hepatocytes express the highest amount of retinoid x receptor alpha (RXRα) among all the cell types. Surprisingly, the function of endogenous retinoids in the liver has received very little attention.
Based on the data generated from chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing, the global DNA binding of transcription factors including retinoid x receptor α (RXRα) along with its partners i.e. retinoic acid receptor α (RARα), pregnane x receptor (PXR), liver x receptor (LXR), farnesoid x receptor (FXR), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) has been established. Based on the binding, functional annotation illustrated the role of those receptors in regulating hepatic lipid homeostasis. To correlate the DNA binding data with gene expression data, the expression patterns of 576 genes that regulate lipid homeostasis were studied in wild type and liver RXRα-null mice treated with and without RA. The data showed that RA treatment and RXRα-deficiency had opposite effects in regulating lipid homeostasis. A subset of genes (114), which could clearly differentiate the effect of ligand treatment and receptor deficiency, were selected for further functional analysis. The expression data suggested that RA treatment could produce unsaturated fatty acids and induce triglyceride breakdown, bile acid secretion, lipolysis, and retinoids elimination. In contrast, RXRα deficiency might induce the synthesis of saturated fatty acids, triglyceride, cholesterol, bile acids, and retinoids. In addition, DNA binding data indicated extensive cross-talk among RARα, PXR, LXR, FXR, and PPARα in regulating those RA/RXRα-dependent gene expression levels. Moreover, RA reduced serum cholesterol, triglyceride, and bile acid levels in mice.
We have characterized the role of hepatic RA for the first time. Hepatic RA mediated through RXRα and its partners regulates lipid homeostasis.
15-Deoxy-Δ(12,14)-PGJ2 (15d-PGJ2) is one of the major metabolites from prostaglandin D2 in arachidonic acid (AA) metabolic pathway. It was determined as a ligand of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) functioning potently in adipocyte development. However, the fact that 15d-PGJ2 exerts also PPARγ-independent biological actions has highly addressed its multi-target behavior. Here, we identified that 15d-PGJ2 was an antagonist of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), as investigated by surface plasmon resonance, fluorescence quenching and homo time-resolved fluorescence based analyses, and the coactivator-recruitment and luciferase-reporter related investigation. Assay of 15d-PGJ2 regulation on hFXRα target genes revealed that treatment of HepG2 cells with 15d-PGJ2 resulted in the stimulation of mRNA expressions of bile-salt export pump (BSEP), and the decrease of cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase (CYP7a1). In addition, functional assays indicated that 15d-PGJ2 promoted the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids in HepG2 cells. Moreover, molecular docking combined with molecular dynamics simulation was applied to develop the possible model of 15d-PGJ2 binding to hFXRα ligand binding domain (LBD) at atomic level, and the responsible residues for 15d-PGJ2/hFXRα-LBD interaction were thereby determined, which were further confirmed by SPR assays against hFXRα-LBD site-directed mutations. Given that hFXRα functions potently in the regulation of hepatic bile acid metabolism and lipid/glucose homeostasis, our current work is expected to help better understand the multi-target features of this PGD2 metabolite in biological pathways, and 15d-PGJ2 as a new discovered FXR antagonist might find its potential application in further anti-hypercholesterol research. 
Lake Mjøsa is the largest freshwater repository in Norway, receiving runoff from a wide surrounding region of urban country. As a result of industrial activity, large quantities of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have been discharged into Lake Mjøsa during the last century. The levels of PCBs, DDTs and PBDEs in burbot from Lake Mjøsa (study population) exceed the corresponding levels in burbot from Lake Losna (reference) by a factor of 3, 6 and 113, respectively. We used shotgun and suppression subtraction hybridization (SSH) cDNA libraries followed by 454 FLX sequencing (957 303 reads sequenced in total) and RT-qPCR to study the effects of POPs in burbot from Lake Mjøsa. The gene list of putatively higher or lower expressed genes in liver of burbot from Lake Mjøsa compared to liver of burbot from Lake Losna, generated from the SSH cDNA libraries, suggest that mechanisms associated with drug metabolism and oxidative stress are enriched in burbot from Lake Mjøsa (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) top networks). According to the IPA analyses, the top toxicity list ranking was "LXR/RXR activation", "Negative/Positive acute phase response proteins", "LPS/IL-1-mediated inhibition of RXR function" and "FXR/RXR activation". Functional analyses further identified PPAR, HNF4A, dexamethasone and β-estradiol as potential upstream key regulator factors. Overall, the study shows that SSH cDNA libraries coupled to next-generation sequencing (RNA-Seq) may be a valuable supplement or alternative to microarray technology in toxicogenomic discovery of environmental samples.
The liver consists of different cell types that together synchronize crucial roles in liver homeostasis. Since nuclear receptors constitute an important class of drug targets that are involved in a wide variety of physiological processes, we have composed the hepatic cell type-specific expression profile of nuclear receptors to uncover the pharmacological potential of liver-enriched nuclear receptors. Parenchymal liver cells (hepatocytes) and liver endothelial and Kupffer cells were isolated from virgin female C57BL/6 wild-type mice using collagenase perfusion and counterflow centrifugal elutriation. The hepatic expression pattern of 49 nuclear receptors was generated by real-time quantitative PCR using the NUclear Receptor Signaling Atlas (NURSA) program resources. Thirty-six nuclear receptors were expressed in total liver. FXR-α, EAR2, LXR-α, HNF4-α, and CAR were the most abundantly expressed nuclear receptors in liver parenchymal cells. In contrast, NUR77, COUP-TFII, LXR-α/β, FXR-α, and EAR2 were the most highly expressed nuclear receptors in endothelial and Kupffer cells. Interestingly, members of orphan receptor COUP-TF family showed a distinct expression pattern. EAR2 was highly and exclusively expressed in parenchymal cells, while COUP-TFII was moderately and exclusively expressed in endothelial and Kupffer cells. Of interest, the orphan receptor TR4 showed a similar expression pattern as the established lipid sensor PPAR-γ. In conclusion, our study provides the most complete quantitative assessment of the nuclear receptor distribution in liver reported to date. Our gene expression catalog suggests that orphan nuclear receptors such as COUP-TFII, EAR2, and TR4 may be of significant importance as novel targets for pharmaceutical interventions in liver.
Persistent residual immune activation and lipid dysmetabolism are characteristics of HIV positive patients receiving an highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Nuclear Receptors are transcription factors involved in the regulation of immune and metabolic functions through the modulation of gene transcription. The objective of the present study was to investigate for the relative abundance of members of the nuclear receptor family in monocytic cells isolated from HIV positive patients treated or not treated with HAART.
Monocytes isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were used for analysis of the relative mRNA expressions of FXR, PXR, LXR, VDR, RARα, RXR, PPARα, PPARβ, PPARγ and GR by Real-Time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The expression of a selected subset of inflammatory and metabolic genes MCP-1, ICAM-1, CD36 and ABCA1 was also measured.
Monocytes isolated from HIV infected patients expressed an altered pattern of nuclear receptors characterized by a profound reduction in the expressions of FXR, PXR, PPARα, GR, RARα and RXR. Of interest, the deregulated expression of nuclear receptors was not restored under HAART and was linked to an altered expression of genes which supports both an immune activation and altered lipid metabolism in monocytes.
Altered expression of genes mediating reciprocal regulation of lipid metabolism and immune function in monocytes occurs in HIV. The present findings provide a mechanistic explanation for immune activation and lipid dysmetabolism occurring in HIV infected patients and could lead to the identification of novel potential therapeutic targets.
Retinoid X receptors (subtypes RXRα or NR2B1, RXRβ or NR2B2 and RXRγ or NR2B3, which originate from three distinct genes) are promiscuous partners with heterodimeric associations to other members of the Nuclear Receptor (NR) superfamily. Some of the heterodimers are "permissive" and transcriptionally active in the presence of either an RXR ligand ("rexinoid") or a NR partner ligand, whereas others are "non-permissive" and unresponsive to rexinoids alone. In rodent models, rexinoids and partner agonists (mainly PPARγ, LXR, FXR) produce beneficial effects on insulin sensitization, diabetes and obesity, but secondary effects have also been noted, such as a raise in tryglyceride levels, supression of the thyroid hormone axis and induction of hepatomegaly.
The authors review recent advances in rexinoid design, including further optimization of known scaffolds, and the discovery of novel RXR modulators by virtual ligand screening or from bioactive natural products. The understanding of rexinoid functions in permissive and non-permissive heterodimers is firmly based on structural knowledge. By strenghtening or disrupting the interaction surface with coregulators rexinoids exert agonist or (partial) antagonist activities. The activity state of the heterodimer can also be fine-tuned by the cellular context and the nature of coregulators.
The synthetic chemistry toolbox has provided a panel of agonists, partial (ant)agonists and/or heterodimer-selective rexinoids starting from existing, naturally occurring or serendipitously discovered scaffolds. These compounds have an unexplored therapeutic potential that might overcome some of the current limitations of rexinoids in therapy, such as hypertriglyceridemia.
During pregnancy, proper hepatobiliary transport and bile acid synthesis protect the liver from cholestatic injury and regulate the maternal and fetal exposure to bile acids, drugs, and environmental chemicals. The objective of this study was to determine the temporal messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein profiles of uptake and efflux transporters as well as bile acid synthetic and conjugating enzymes in livers from virgin and pregnant mice on gestational days (GD) 7, 11, 14, and 17 and postnatal days (PND) 1, 15, and 30. Compared with virgins, the mRNAs of most transporters were reduced approximately 50% in pregnant dams between GD11 and 17. Western blot and immunofluorescence staining confirmed the downregulation of Mrp3, 6, Bsep, and Ntcp proteins. One day after parturition, the mRNAs of many uptake and efflux hepatobiliary transporters remained low in pregnant mice. By PND30, the mRNAs of all transporters returned to virgin levels. mRNAs of the bile acid synthetic enzymes in the classic pathway, Cyp7a1 and 8b1, increased in pregnant mice, whereas mRNA and protein expression of enzymes in the alternative pathway of bile acid synthesis (Cyp27a1 and 39a1) and conjugating enzymes (Bal and Baat) decreased. Profiles of transporter and bile acid metabolism genes likely result from coordinated downregulation of transcription factor mRNA (CAR, LXR, PXR, PPARα, FXR) in pregnant mice on GD14 and 17. In conclusion, pregnancy caused a global downregulation of most hepatic transporters, which began as early as GD7 for some genes and was maximal by GD14 and 17, and was inversely related to increasing concentrations of circulating 17β-estradiol and progesterone as pregnancy progressed.
Endogenous small molecule metabolites that regulate animal longevity are emerging as a novel means to influence health and life span. In C. elegans, bile acid-like steroids called the dafachronic acids (DAs) regulate developmental timing and longevity through the conserved nuclear hormone receptor DAF-12, a homolog of mammalian sterol-regulated receptors LXR and FXR. Using metabolic genetics, mass spectrometry, and biochemical approaches, we identify new activities in DA biosynthesis and characterize an evolutionarily conserved short chain dehydrogenase, DHS-16, as a novel 3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Through regulation of DA production, DHS-16 controls DAF-12 activity governing longevity in response to signals from the gonad. Our elucidation of C. elegans bile acid biosynthetic pathways reveals the possibility of novel ligands as well as striking biochemical conservation to other animals, which could illuminate new targets for manipulating longevity in metazoans.
To investigate the effect of maternal dietary protein on hepatic cholesterol metabolism in offspring pigs and to detect underlying epigenetic mechanisms, 14 primiparous purebred Meishan sows were fed standard-protein (SP, n=7) or low-protein (LP, 50% of SP, n=7) diets during pregnancy and lactation, respectively. LP piglets showed significantly lower body weight and liver weight at weaning, associated with decreased liver and serum cholesterol content. Hepatic SREBP2, HMGCR and CYP7α1 mRNA expressions were all up-regulated in LP piglets, as well as SREBP2 protein content and HMGCR enzyme activity, compared to SP piglets, while the mRNA expression of LDLR, FXR, LXR and CYP27α1 was not altered. Hepatic activation of HMGCR gene transcription in LP piglets was associated with promoter hypomethylation, together with decreased histone H3, H3 lysine 9 monomethylation (H3K9me1) and H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and increased H3 acetylation. No CpG islands were predicted in the CYP7α1 promoter, and the augmented CYP7α1 transcription in LP piglets was associated with decreased H3, H3K9me1 and H3K27me3. No alterations were detected for hepatic expression of microRNAs predicted to target 3'-UTR of HMGCR or CYP7α1 gene. These results indicate that maternal low-protein diet during gestation and lactation affects hepatic cholesterol metabolism in weaning piglets by modifying the epigenetic regulation of HMGCR and CYP7α1 genes, which implicates possible long-term consequences in cholesterol homeostasis later in adult life.
Ligand-activated nuclear receptors, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), pregnane X receptor, and constitutive androstane receptor, were first identified as key regulators of the responses against chemical toxicants. However, numerous studies using mouse disease models and human samples have revealed critical roles for these receptors and others, such as PPARβ/δ, PPARγ, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and liver X receptor (LXR), in maintaining nutrient/energy homeostasis in part through modulation of the gut-liver-adipose axis. Recently, disorders associated with disrupted nutrient/energy homeostasis, e.g., obesity, metabolic syndrome, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), are increasing worldwide. Notably, in NAFLD, a progressive subtype exists, designated as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that is characterized by typical histological features resembling alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH), and NASH/ASH are recognized as major causes of hepatitis virus-unrelated liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Since hepatic steatosis is basically caused by an imbalance between fat/energy influx and utilization, abnormal signaling of these nuclear receptors contribute to the pathogenesis of fatty liver disease. Standard therapeutic interventions have not been fully established for fatty liver disease, but some new agents that activate or inhibit nuclear receptor signaling have shown promise as possible therapeutic targets. In this review, we summarize recent findings on the roles of nuclear receptors in fatty liver disease and discuss future perspectives to develop promising pharmacological strategies targeting nuclear receptors for NAFLD/NASH.
Pregnane X receptor (PXR) is a key regulator of the induction of drug metabolizing enzymes. PXR has been studied for its importance in drug-drug or herb-drug interactions, and it is also a molecular target for the treatment of inflammatory and metabolic diseases.
This study aims to determine new natural PXR-ligands from traditional plant medicines.
The PXR activation activity was measured by a mammalian one hybrid assay of PXR. Identification of the active compound from Alisma rhizome (the rhizomes of Alisma orientale) was carried out by bioassay-guided fractionation method. The transcriptional activity of the liver-enriched nuclear receptors was measured by the luciferase reporter assay. The interaction between the SRC-1 and PXR was measured by a mammalian 2-hybrid assay. The expression of endogenous CYP3A4 mRNA in both cultured hPXR-overexpressing hepatoma cells and human primary hepatocytes were measured by quantitative RT-PCR method.
The extract of Alisma rhizome showed the most potent activation activity by screening of a library of medicinal plant extracts. Alisol B 23-acetate (ABA) was identified to be the active compound of Alisma rhizome. ABA caused a concentration-dependent increase on the PXR-dependent transactivation of a luciferase reporter gene, but did not affect the ligand binding activity of the liver-enriched nuclear receptors, such as CAR, LXR, FXR, PPARα, PPARδ and PPARγ, emphasizing that ABA is a potent and specific agonist of PXR. With ABA treatment, the direct interaction between the ligand-binding domain of PXR and the receptor interaction domain of SRC1 was observed. ABA also induced the expression of endogenous CYP3A4 mRNA in both cultured hPXR-overexpressing hepatoma cells and human primary hepatocytes.
Since the rhizomes of Alisma orientale are used for a wide range of ailments in traditional Chinese medicine and Japanese Kampo medicine, this study could possibly extend into the clinical usage of these medicines via the mechanism of PXR activation.
Environmental heat stress and metabolic stress during transition from late gestation to lactation are main factors limiting production in dairy cattle, and there is a complex interaction between them. Many proteins expressed in adipose tissue are involved in metabolic responses to stress. We aimed to investigate the effects of seasonal heat stress on adipose proteome in late-pregnant cows, and to identify biomarkers of heat stress. Late pregnant cows during summer heat stress (S, n=18), or during the winter season (W, n=12) were used. Subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies sampled 14days prepartum from S (n=10) and W (n=8) were analyzed by intensity-based, label-free, quantitative shotgun proteomics (nano-LC-MS/MS). Plasma concentrations of malondialdehyde and cortisol were higher in S than in W cows. Proteomic analysis revealed that 107/1495 proteins were differentially abundant in S compared to W (P&lt;0.05 and fold change of at least ±1.5). Top canonical pathways in S vs. W adipose were Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response, acute-phase response, and FXR/RXR and LXR/RXR activation. Novel biomarkers of heat stress in adipose tissue were found. These findings indicate that seasonal heat stress has a unique effect on adipose tissue in late-pregnant cows.
This work shows that seasonal heat stress increases plasma concentrations of the oxidative stress marker malondialdehyde and cortisol in transition dairy cows. As many proteins expressed in the adipose tissue are involved in metabolic responses to stress, we investigated the effects of heat stress on the proteome of adipose tissue from late-pregnant cows during summer or winter seasons. We demonstrated that heat stress enriches several stress-related pathways, such as the Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response and the acute-phase response in adipose tissues. Thus, environmental heat stress has a unique effect on adipose tissue in late-pregnant cows, as part of the regulatory adaptations to chronic heat load during the summer season. In addition, this study presents the widest available dataset of adipose tissue proteome in dairy cows, and revealed several novel biomarkers of heat stress in adipose tissue of dairy cows, the use of which awaits further validation.
Although liver disease is a major complication of parenteral nutrition (PN) for intestinal failure (IF), its pathogenesis remains unclear. We investigated potential molecular mechanisms of liver injury in pediatric onset IF.
Liver expression of canalicular phospholipid (ABCB4), bile acid (ABCB11), and sterol (ABCG5/8) transporters, their upstream regulators LXR and FXR as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were investigated among patients with IF [age median 3.8 (IQR 1.2 to 11)] in relation to biochemical and histologic liver injury, PN, serum plant sterols, fibroblast growth factor 19, and α-tocopherol.
Patients receiving PN currently (n = 18) showed more advanced liver injury than patients after weaning off PN (n = 30). Histologic portal inflammation strongly segregated PN-dependent (44%) from weaned off patients (3%, P = 0.001) and coupled with progression of cholestasis and liver fibrosis. Patients with portal inflammation demonstrated markedly induced liver RNA expression of IL6 and TNF, repression of FXR and its canalicular bile transporter target gene RNA expression, including ABCB4 and ABCB11 as well as decreased protein expression of ABCB11 and ABCB4. Furthermore, upregulation of LXR and ABCG5/8 RNA expression was suppressed in patients with portal inflammation. Current PN, increased serum levels of plant sterols stigmasterol, avenasterol, and sitosterol along with serum citrulline, a marker of enterocyte mass, predicted portal inflammation.
In pediatric onset IF, current PN delivery synergistically with intestinal compromise promote liver inflammation, which associates with progression of biochemical and histologic liver injury, while reducing expression of canalicular bile transporters.
Nuclear receptors (NRs) are ligand-activated transcription factors regulating a large variety of processes involved in reproduction, development, and metabolism. NRs are ideal drug targets because they are activated by lipophilic ligands that easily pass cell membranes. Immortalized cell lines recapitulate NR biology poorly and generating primary cultures is laborious and requires a constant need for donor material. There is a clear need for development of novel preclinical model systems that better resemble human physiology. Uncertainty due to technical limitations early in drug development is often the cause of preclinical drugs not reaching the clinic. Here, we studied whether organoids, mini-organs derived from the respective mouse tissue's stem cells, can serve as a novel model system to study NR biology and targetability. We characterized mRNA expression profiles of the NR superfamily in mouse liver, ileum, and colon organoids. Tissue-specific expression patterns were largely maintained in the organoids, indicating their suitability for NR research. Metabolic NRs Fxrα, Lxrα, Lxrβ, Pparα, and Pparγ induced expression of and binding to endogenous target genes. Transcriptome analyses of wildtype colon organoids stimulated with Rosiglitazone showed that lipid metabolism was the highest significant changed function, greatly mimicking the PPARs and Rosiglitazone function in vivo. Finally, using organoids we identify Trpm6, Slc26a3, Ang1, and Rnase4, as novel Fxr target genes. Our results demonstrate that organoids represent a framework to study NR biology that can be further expanded to human organoids to improve preclinical testing of novel drugs that target this pharmacologically important class of ligand activated transcription factors.
Fetal exposure to a maternal low protein diet during rat pregnancy is associated with hypertension, renal dysfunction and metabolic disturbance in adult life. These effects are present when dietary manipulations target only the first half of pregnancy. It was hypothesised that early gestation protein restriction would impact upon placental gene expression and that this may give clues to the mechanism which links maternal diet to later consequences.
Pregnant rats were fed control or a low protein diet from conception to day 13 gestation. Placentas were collected and RNA sequencing performed using the Illumina platform.
Protein restriction down-regulated 67 genes and up-regulated 24 genes in the placenta. Ingenuity pathway analysis showed significant enrichment in pathways related to cholesterol and lipoprotein transport and metabolism, including atherosclerosis signalling, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, LXR/RXR and FXR/RXR activation. Genes at the centre of these processes included the apolipoproteins ApoB, ApoA2 and ApoC2, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (Mttp), the clathrin-endocytosis receptor cubilin, the transcription factor retinol binding protein 4 (Rbp4) and transerythrin (Ttr; a retinol and thyroid hormone transporter). Real-time PCR measurements largely confirmed the findings of RNASeq and indicated that the impact of protein restriction was often striking (cubilin up-regulated 32-fold, apoC2 up-regulated 17.6-fold). The findings show that gene expression in specific pathways is modulated by maternal protein restriction in the day-13 rat placenta.
Changes in cholesterol transport may contribute to altered tissue development in the fetus and hence programme risk of disease in later life.
Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are a heterogeneous population, which contain several cell phenotypes: mesenchymal stem cells, progenitor cells, fibroblasts and other type of cells. Previously, we identified unique stem cells that we named multilineage-differentiating stress enduring (Muse) cells as one to several percent of MSCs of the bone marrow, adipose tissue and dermis. Among different cell populations in MSCs, Muse cells, positive for pluripotent surface marker SSEA-3, may represent cells responsible for pluripotent-like property of MSCs, since they express pluripotency genes, able to differentiated into triploblastic cells from a single cells and are self-renewable. MSCs release biologically active factors that have profound effects on local cellular dynamics. A thorough examination of MSC secretome seems essential for understanding the physiological functions exerted by these cells in our organism and also for rational cellular therapy design. In this setting, studies on secretome of Muse cells may shed light on pathways that are associated with their specific features. Our findings evidenced that secretomes of MSCs and Muse cells contain factors that regulate extracellular matrix remodeling, ox-redox activities and immune system. Muse cells appear to secrete factors that may preserve their stem cell features, allow survival under stress conditions and may contribute to their immunomodulation capacity. In detail, the proteins belonging to protein kinase A signaling, FXR/RXR activation and LXR/RXR activation pathways may play a role in regulation of Muse stem cell features. These last 2 pathways together with proteins associated with antigen presentation pathway and coagulation system may play a role in immunomodulation.
Retinoid X receptors (RXRs) are promiscuous partners of heterodimeric associations with other members of the Nuclear Receptor (NR) superfamily. Through these liaisons RXR ligands ("rexinoids") either transcriptionally activate on their own the "permissive" subclass of heterodimers (PPAR/RXR, LXR/RXR, FXR/RXR) or synergize with partner ligands in the "non-permissive" subclass of heterodimers (RAR/RXR, VDR/RXR and TR/RXR). The nature and extent of the interaction of the ligand-receptor complexes with co-regulators, which is cell and context-dependent, results ultimately in transcriptional modulation of cognate gene networks. RXR modulators hold therapeutical potential for the treatment of cancer and other diseases related to nutrient acquisition and disposal, among them metabolic diseases. A rexinoid (bexarotene) has indeed reached the clinic for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The modulation of RXR function by rexinoids acting as agonists, parcial agonists, inverse agonists or antagonists is encoded in the structure of the ligandreceptor complexes. A very large number of rexinoids with a wide structural diversity has been published. In addition to natural products and other ligands discovered by HTS or mere serendipity, most rexinoids have been rationally designed based on the structures of existing complexes with RXR determined by X-Ray or based on Molecular Modeling. Although the structural rationale for the modulation of the ligand-receptor complexes is reasonably well understood, it has not yet been possible to predict the correlation between ligand structure and physiological response, particularly in the case of heterodimer-selective rexinoids.
Since the isolation and identification of the retinoid X receptor (RXR) as a member of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily in 1990, its analysis has ushered in a new understanding of physiological regulation by nuclear receptors, and novel methods to identify other unknown and orphan receptors. Expression of one or more of the three isoforms of RXR-α, β, and γ-can be found in every human cell type. Biologically, RXR plays a critical role through its ability to partner with other nuclear receptors. RXR is able to regulate nutrient metabolism by forming "permissive" heterodimers with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), liver-X-receptor (LXR), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), pregnane X receptor (PXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), which function when ligands are bound to one or both of the heterodimer partners. Conversely, RXR is able to form "nonpermissive" heterodimers with vitamin D receptor (VDR), thyroid receptor (TR) and retinoic acid receptor (RAR), which function only in the presence of vitamin D, T3 and retinoic acid, respectively. Furthermore, RXR can form homodimers in the presence of a selective agonist, or rexinoid, to regulate gene expression and to either inhibit proliferation or induce apoptosis in human cancers. Thus, over the last 25 years there have been several reports on the design and synthesis of small molecule rexinoids. This review summarizes the synthetic methods for several of the most potent rexinoids thus far reported.
The aim of our study was to characterize the human salivary proteome and determine the changes in protein expression in two different stages of diabetic retinopathy with type-2 diabetes mellitus: (1) with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and (2) with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Type-2 diabetes mellitus without diabetic retinopathy (XDR) was designated as control.
In this study, 45 saliva samples were collected (15 samples from XDR control group, 15 samples from NPDR disease group and 15 samples from PDR disease group). Salivary proteins were extracted, reduced, alkylated, trypsin digested and labeled with an isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) before being analyzed by an Orbitrap fusion tribrid mass spectrometer. Protein annotation, fold change calculation and statistical analysis were interrogated by Proteome Discoverer. Biological pathway analysis was performed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifiers PXD003723-PX003725.
A total of 315 proteins were identified from the salivary proteome and 119 proteins were found to be differentially expressed. The differentially expressed proteins from the NPDR disease group and the PDR disease group were assigned to respective canonical pathways indicating increased Liver X receptor/Retinoid X receptor (LXR/RXR) activation, Farnesoid X receptor/Retinoid X receptor (FXR/RXR) activation, acute phase response signaling, sucrose degradation V and regulation of actin-based motility by Rho in the PDR disease group compared to the NPDR disease group.
Progression from non-proliferative to proliferative retinopathy in type-2 diabetic patients is a complex multi-mechanism and systemic process. Furthermore, saliva was shown to be a feasible alternative sample source for diabetic retinopathy biomarkers.
The prevalence of obesity-related glomerulopathy is increasing in parallel with the worldwide obesity epidemic. Glomerular hypertrophy and adaptive focal segmental glomerulosclerosis define the condition pathologically. The glomerulus enlarges in response to obesity-induced increases in glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, filtration fraction and tubular sodium reabsorption. Normal insulin/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and mTOR signalling are critical for podocyte hypertrophy and adaptation. Adipokines and ectopic lipid accumulation in the kidney promote insulin resistance of podocytes and maladaptive responses to cope with the mechanical forces of renal hyperfiltration. Although most patients have stable or slowly progressive proteinuria, up to one-third develop progressive renal failure and end-stage renal disease. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone blockade is effective in the short-term but weight loss by hypocaloric diet or bariatric surgery has induced more consistent and dramatic antiproteinuric effects and reversal of hyperfiltration. Altered fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism are increasingly recognized as key mediators of renal lipid accumulation, inflammation, oxidative stress and fibrosis. Newer therapies directed to lipid metabolism, including SREBP antagonists, PPARα agonists, FXR and TGR5 agonists, and LXR agonists, hold therapeutic promise.
Nephrotoxicity is a rare complication caused by anti-tuberculosis therapy-induced oxidative stress. The Cyanobacterium Spirulina fusiformis Voronikhin belonging to Oscillatoriaceae family is used traditionally as a source of antioxidants against oxidative stress. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of S. fusiformis in modifying isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RIF)-induced changes in Wistar rat kidneys. Animals were divided into six groups: normal control rats; toxic control (INH &amp; RIF-50 mg/kg b.w./d each; p.o.); INH &amp; RIF + S. fusiformis (400 mg/kg b.w./d); INH &amp; RIF + S. fusiformis (800 mg/kg b.w./d); S. fusiformis (800 mg/kg b.w./d) alone-treated rats; INH &amp; RIF + silymarin (25 mg/kg b.w./d). Study duration was 28 d after which blood and kidneys were analyzed. We also studied the binding and interactions of the transcription factors Liver X Receptor (LXR) and Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) with INH, RIF, and representative active compounds of S. fusiformis by in silico methods. INH &amp; RIF treatment caused significant (p&lt; 0.05) decrease in antioxidant levels and significant (p&lt; 0.05) increase in the levels of creatinine, urea, and uric acid showing impaired kidney function. Spirulina fusiformis ameliorated these effects in a dose dependent manner. Histological examination of kidneys supported these findings. Results of the in silico analyses showed that selected active components of S. fusiformis interact with LXR and FXR and could be a possible mechanism of action. S. fusiformis rendered protection against anti-tuberculosis drugs-induced oxidative stress in kidney tissues of rats. 
Pulmonary complications due to infection and idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS), a noninfectious lung injury in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients, are frequent causes of transplantation-related mortality and morbidity. Our objective was to characterize the global bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) protein expression of IPS to identify proteins and pathways that differentiate IPS from infectious lung injury after HSCT. We studied 30 BALF samples from patients who developed lung injury within 180 days of HSCT or cellular therapy transfusion (natural killer cell transfusion). Adult subjects were classified as having IPS or infectious lung injury by the criteria outlined in the 2011 American Thoracic Society statement. BALF was depleted of hemoglobin and 14 high-abundance proteins, treated with trypsin, and labeled with isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) 8-plex reagent for two-dimensional capillary liquid chromatography (LC) and data dependent peptide tandem mass spectrometry (MS) on an Orbitrap Velos system in higher-energy collision-induced dissociation activation mode. Protein identification employed a target-decoy strategy using ProteinPilot within Galaxy P. The relative protein abundance was determined with reference to a global internal standard consisting of pooled BALF from patients with respiratory failure and no history of HSCT. A variance weighted t-test controlling for a false discovery rate of ≤5% was used to identify proteins that showed differential expression between IPS and infectious lung injury. The biological relevance of these proteins was determined by using gene ontology enrichment analysis and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. We characterized 12 IPS and 18 infectious lung injury BALF samples. In the 5 iTRAQ LC-MS/MS experiments 845, 735, 532, 615, and 594 proteins were identified for a total of 1125 unique proteins and 368 common proteins across all 5 LC-MS/MS experiments. When comparing IPS to infectious lung injury, 96 proteins were differentially expressed. Gene ontology enrichment analysis showed that these proteins participate in biological processes involved in the development of lung injury after HSCT. These include acute phase response signaling, complement system, coagulation system, liver X receptor (LXR)/retinoid X receptor (RXR), and farsenoid X receptor (FXR)/RXR modulation. We identified 2 canonical pathways modulated by TNF-α, FXR/RXR activation, and IL2 signaling in macrophages. The proteins also mapped to blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, and wound healing-processes that participate in organ repair. Cell movement was identified as significantly over-represented by proteins with differential expression between IPS and infection. In conclusion, the BALF protein expression in IPS differed significantly from infectious lung injury in HSCT recipients. These differences provide insights into mechanisms that are activated in lung injury in HSCT recipients and suggest potential therapeutic targets to augment lung repair.
The metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) phenotype is an important obesity subtype in which obesity is not accompanied by any metabolic comorbidity. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, a shotgun proteomics approach to identify circulating biomolecules and pathways associated with MHO was used.
The subjects were 20 African-American women: 10 MHO cases and 10 metabolically abnormal individuals with obesity (MAO) controls. Serum proteins were detected and quantified using label-free proteomics. Differential expression of proteins between the two groups was analyzed, and the list of differentially expressed proteins was analyzed to determine enriched biological pathways.
Twenty proteins were differentially expressed between MHO and controls. These proteins included: hemoglobin subunits (HBA1, P = 6.00 × 10(-18) ), haptoglobin-related protein (HPR, P = 1.2 × 10(-15) ), apolipoproteins (APOB-100, P = 1.50 × 10(-40) ; APOA4, P = 1.1 × 10(-14) ), retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4, P = 7.1 × 10(-08) ), and CRP (P = 2.0 × 10(-04) ). MHO was associated with lower levels of proinflammatory and higher levels of anti-inflammatory biomarkers when compared with MAO. Pathway analysis showed enrichment of lipids and inflammatory pathways, including LXR/RXR and FXR/RXR activation, and acute phase response signaling.
These findings suggested that protection from dysregulated inflammatory and lipid processes were primary molecular hallmarks of MHO. The candidate biomarkers (AHSG, RBP4, and APOA4) identified in this study are potential prognostic markers for MHO.
Cancer cells are characterized by their high capability to proliferate. This imposes an accelerated biosynthesis of membrane compounds to respond to the need for increasing the membrane surface of dividing cells and remodeling the structure of lipid microdomains. Recently, attention has been paid to the upregulation of O-GlcNAcylation processes observed in cancer cells. Although O-GlcNAcylation of lipogenic transcriptional regulators is described in the literature (e.g., FXR, LXR, ChREBP), little is known about the regulation of the enzymes that drive lipogenesis: acetyl co-enzyme A carboxylase and fatty acid synthase (FAS). The expression and catalytic activity of both FAS and O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) are high in cancer cells but the reciprocal regulation of the two enzymes remains unexplored. In this perspective, we collected data linking FAS and OGT and, in so doing, pave the way for the exploration of the intricate functions of these two actors that play a central role in tumor growth. 
The enteropathogen Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) is the most commonly non-typhoideal serotype isolated in pig worldwide. Currently, one of the main sources of human infection is by consumption of pork meat. Therefore, prevention and control of salmonellosis in pigs is crucial for minimizing risks to public health. The aim of the present study was to use isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) to explore differences in the response to Salmonella in two segment of the porcine gut (ileum and colon) along a time course of 1, 2, and 6 days post infection (dpi) with S. Typhimurium. A total of 298 proteins were identified in the infected ileum samples of which, 112 displayed significant expression differences due to Salmonella infection. In colon, 184 proteins were detected in the infected samples of which 46 resulted differentially expressed with respect to the controls. The higher number of changes in protein expression was quantified in ileum at 2 dpi. Further biological interpretation of proteomics data using bioinformatics tools demonstrated that the expression changes in colon were found in proteins involved in cell death and survival, tissue morphology or molecular transport at the early stages and tissue regeneration at 6 dpi. In ileum, however, changes in protein expression were mainly related to immunological and infection diseases, inflammatory response or connective tissue disorders at 1 and 2 dpi. iTRAQ has proved to be a proteomic robust approach allowing us to identify ileum as the earliest response focus upon S. Typhimurium in the porcine gut. In addition, new functions involved in the response to bacteria such as eIF2 signaling, free radical scavengers or antimicrobial peptides (AMP) expression have been identified. Finally, the impairment at of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids and lipid metabolism by means the under regulation of FABP6 protein and FXR/RXR and LXR/RXR signaling pathway in ileum has been established for the first time in pigs. Taken together, our results provide a better understanding of the porcine response to Salmonella infection and the molecular mechanisms underlying Salmonella-host interactions.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disorder. This study aims to consider effects of resveratrol, exercise and their combination on Farnesoid X receptor (Fxr), the liver X receptor (Lxr) and Sirtuin 1 (Sirt 1) genes expression in the liver of elderly rats with NAFLD.
Rats with NAFLD were randomly divided into seven groups including patient, saline, resveratrol (RSV), interval exercise, continuous exercise, interval exercise + RSV and continuous exercise + RSV. Levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in the liver tissue were measured using specific ELISA kits. A TUNEL assay kit was used for the assessment of hepatic cells apoptosis. Lipid profiles were considered by measuring the serum triglyceride, cholesterol, LDL, and HDL. Expression of Sirt1, Lxr and Fxr genes was considered using RT-PCR.
Resveratrol administration alone or combined with exercise training significantly improved the expression of Sirt1, Lxr and Fxr genes (p &lt; 0.05) in the hepatic tissue of rats with NAFLD, while levels of AST, ALT, ALP enzymes, as well as apoptotic cells were significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.05).
Although resveratrol alone improves the expression of Sirt1, Lxr and Fxr, as well as liver function, combined therapy with exercise training is more effective to improve NAFLD.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in the western countries. The histological spectrum of NAFLD includes simple steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma. Nuclear receptors are a large group of ligand-dependent transcription factors that sense the environmental and endogenous changes and regulate numerous physiological and pathological processes. Accumulating evidence has suggested that a dysregulation of nuclear receptors in NAFLD may effect on the metabolism of endogenous and exogenous chemicals in the liver. The current study was designed to systematically characterize the time-dependent modulation of nuclear receptors including the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), the pregnane X receptor (PXR), the liver X receptor (LXR), and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in the progression of NAFLD. Male C57BL/6 mice fed by a high fat diet were used to induce NAFLD. Hepatic steatosis, lobular inflammation, progressive fibrosis, increased hepatocyte DNA synthesis, and liver tumor formation were observed at various time points in our mouse model. During the development of hepatic steatosis (8-16 weeks), PPARα was activated as indicated by its target genes as well as the elevated peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase activity. The mRNA level of Pparγ was also upregulated while Pparδ gene expression was significantly reduced during the development of hepatic steatosis. PXR target gene Cyp3a11 was consistently increased 3-4-fold in addition to the increased microsomal Cyp3a enzymatic activity at all stages of NAFLD. In contrast, CAR mediated Cyp2b10 gene expression was found increased only by week 12. LXRα target genes Abcg5 and Abcg8 were significantly elevated during the whole course of NAFLD. The mRNA of Fxr was downregulated at 24 and 32 weeks in high fat diet fed mice, which might correlate with the development of progressive fibrosis at the stage of steatohepatitis. The results of our study provided a systematic evaluation of the changes of nuclear receptors and their downstream chemicalmetabolism and transport enzymes in the progression of NAFLD.
Adipose stem cells (ASCs) are considered a great alternative source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and have shown great promise on tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications, including bone repair. However, the underlying mechanisms regulating the osteogenic differentiation of ASCs remain poorly known. Gene expression profiles of GSE63754 and GSE37329 were downloaded from gene expression omnibus database. R software and Bioconductor packages were used to compare and identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) before and after ASC osteogenic differentiation. The common significant DEGs between GSE63754 and GSE37329 were then subjected to gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA), and protein-protein interactions (PPIs) networks analysis. One of the central node genes FOXO1 was selected for further investigation. A total of 142 up- and 69 downregulated genes were aberrantly expressed in both GSE63754 and GSE37329. GO analysis revealed that these DEGs were associated with extracellular matrix organization, proteinaceous extracellular matrix, and Wnt-protein binding. IPA analysis showed that canonical pathways, such as FXR/RXR activation, adipogenesis pathway, and LXR/RXR activation, were involved in regulating osteogenic differentiation of ASCs. A total of three subnetworks and 39 nodes were identified with PPI network and MCODE plugin. Moreover, suppression of one central node gene FOXO1 inhibited the osteogenic differentiation of ASCs. Our study provides a registry of genes and pathways that play important roles in regulating osteogenic differentiation of ASCs, which might have potential therapeutic applications in bone regeneration and bone tissue engineering.
The widespread use of organotin compounds (OTs) as biocides in antifouling paints and agricultural applications poses a serious threat to the ecosystem and humans. Butyltin compounds (BTs), especially tributyltin (TBT), are considered to be endocrine disrupting chemicals in marine organisms. The underlying mechanism of disrupting effects on mammals, however, has not been sufficiently investigated. To determine the effect and action of these biocides, the present study evaluated the effects of BTs on human adrenocortical carcinoma cells (H295R) with a focus on endocrine disrupting effect. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and subsequent mass finger printing were used to identify proteins expression profiles from the cells after exposure to 0.1μM BTs for 48h. In total, 89 protein spots showed altered expression in at least two treatment groups and 69 of these proteins were subsequently identified. Bioinformatic analysis of the proteins indicated that BTs involved in the regulation of hormone homeostasis, lipid metabolism, cell death, and energy production. IPA analysis revealed LXR/RXR (liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor) activation, FXR/RXR (farnesoid X receptor/retinoid X receptor) activation and fatty acid metabolism were the top three categories on which BTs acted and these systems play vital roles in sterol, glucose and lipid metabolism. The expression of LXR and FXR mRNA in H295R cells was stimulated by TBT, confirming the ability of TBT to activate this nuclear receptor. In summary, the differentially expressed proteins discovered in this study may participate in the toxic actions of BTs, and nuclear receptor activation and lipid metabolism may play important roles in such actions of BTs.
Chronic renal disease (CRD) associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and/or type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a significant problem in Aboriginal Australians. Whole exome sequencing data (N = 72) showed enrichment for ClinVar pathogenic variants in gene sets/pathways linking lipoprotein, lipid and glucose metabolism. The top Ingenuity Pathway Analysis canonical pathways were Farsenoid X Receptor and Retinoid Receptor (FXR/RXR; (P = 1.86 × 10-7), Liver X Receptor and Retinoid Receptor (LXR/RXR; P = 2.88 × 10-6), and atherosclerosis signalling (P = 3.80 × 10-6). Top pathways/processes identified using Enrichr included: Reactome 2016 chylomicron-mediated lipid transport (P = 3.55 × 10-7); Wiki 2016 statin (P = 8.29 × 10-8); GO Biological Processes 2017 chylomicron remodelling (P = 1.92 × 10-8). ClinVar arylsulfatase A pseudodeficiency (ARSA-PD) pathogenic variants were common, including the missense variant c.511 G &gt; A (p.Asp171Asn; rs74315466; frequency 0.44) only reported in Polynesians. This variant is in cis with known ARSA-PD 3' regulatory c.*96 A &gt; G (rs6151429; frequency 0.47) and missense c.1055 A &gt; G (p.Asn352Ser; rs2071421; frequency 0.47) variants. These latter two variants are associated with T2D (risk haplotype GG; odds ratio 2.67; 95% CI 2.32-3.08; P = 2.43 × 10-4) in genome-wide association data (N = 402), but are more strongly associated with quantitative traits (DBP, SBP, ACR, eGFR) for hypertension and renal function in non-diabetic than diabetic subgroups. Traits associated with CVD, CRD and T2D in Aboriginal Australians provide novel insight into function of ARSA-PD variants.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by hepatic steatosis, impaired insulin sensitivity, and chronic low-grade inflammation. Our previous studies indicated that zinc alpha2 glycoprotein (ZAG) alleviates palmitate (PA)-induced intracellular lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. This study is to further characterize the roles of ZAG on the development of hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance (IR), and inflammation.
ZAG protein levels in the livers of NAFLD patients, high-fat diet (HFD)-induced or genetically (ob/ob) induced obese mice, and in PA-treated hepatocytes were determined by western blotting. C57BL/6J mice injected with an adenovirus expressing ZAG were fed HFD for indicated time to induce hepatic steatosis, IR, and inflammation, and then biomedical, histological, and metabolic analyses were conducted to identify pathologic alterations in these mice. The molecular mechanisms underlying ZAG-regulated hepatic steatosis were further explored and verified in mice and hepatocytes.
ZAG expression was decreased in NAFLD patient liver biopsy samples, obese mice livers, and PA-treated hepatocytes. Simultaneously, ZAG overexpression alleviated intracellular lipid accumulation via upregulating adiponectin and lipolytic genes (FXR, PPARα, etc.) while downregulating lipogenic genes (SREBP-1c, LXR, etc.) in obese mice as well as in cultured hepatocytes. ZAG improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance via activation of IRS/AKT signaling. Moreover, ZAG significantly inhibited NF-ĸB/JNK signaling and thus resulting in suppression of obesity-associated inflammatory response in hepatocytes.
Our results revealed that ZAG could protect against NAFLD by ameliorating hepatic steatosis, IR, and inflammation.
There are varieties of murine models of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with different pathophysiologic characteristics. For preclinical assessment, a standardized model would allow comparisons of various pharmacotherapeutic candidates in efficacy, pharmacokinetics, pharmaco-metabolism, and adverse effects under a same system. The present study aims to characterize murine NASH models by comparing end-points of major abnormalities. NASH was induced by feeding high fructose/glucose in drinking water (HF/G), high-fat/calorie diet (HFCD), and in combination (HFCD-HF/G) in mice for 8 or 16 weeks. HF/G feeding caused a minimal fat accumulation and increase in free fatty acids (FFA). In contrast, HFCD-HF/G feeding resulted in a remarkable increase in body weight, subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue, macrosteatosis with a nearly seven-fold increase in triglyceride and FFA content, accompanied with marked hepatocellular injury, inflammatory responses, fibrosis, and insulin resistance, and represented as typical NASH in histopathology, metabolic, and adipokine profiles in a progressive manner. Meanwhile, mice fed HFCD displayed significant steatosis, necroptosis, fibrosis, insulin resistance, metabolic, and adipokine profiles, and the extent is less than those fed HFCD-HF/G. Significant MCP-1, CCR-2, and NLRP-1/3 activation were found in mice fed HFCD and HFCD-HF/G for 16 weeks, whereas gene expression of CPT-1 and ACOX-1 was down-regulated in these two groups in comparison to the controls. Nuclear receptors, such as SREBP-1c, FXR, LXR-α, PPAR-α, and PPAR-γ, were strikingly elevated in the HFCD-HF/G group. In conclusion, feeding HFCD-HF/G resulted in a reliable NASH model in mice with remarkable necroptosis, steatosis, fibrosis, and insulin resistance as well as a disordered profile of lipid metabolism and adipokine, and HFCD caused significant NASH features in histopathology and metabolic profiles only at a late stage. Whereas HF/G feeding barely led to minimal fat accumulation, some changes at molecular levels and metabolic disturbance in mice.
Diabetes, with an increased prevalence and various progressive complications, has become a significant global health challenge. The concrete mechanisms responsible for the development of diabetes still remain incompletely unknown, although substantial researches have been conducted to search for the effective therapeutic targets. This review aims to reveal the novel roles of Xenobiotic Nuclear Receptors (XNRs), including the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor (PPAR), the Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR), the Liver X Receptor (LXR), the Pregnane X Receptor (PXR) and the Constitutive Androstane Receptor (CAR), in the development of diabetes and provide potential strategies for research and treatment of metabolic diseases.
We retrieved a large number of original data about these five XNRs and organized to focus on their recently discovered functions in diabetes and its complications.
Increasing evidences have suggested that PPAR, FXR, LXR ,PXR and CAR are involved in the development of diabetes and its complications through different mechanisms, including the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism, insulin and inflammation response and related others.
PPAR, FXR, LXR, PXR, and CAR, as the receptors for numerous natural or synthetic compounds, may be the most effective therapeutic targets in the treatment of metabolic diseases.
Whole-grain highland hull-less barley (WHLB) contains high amounts of bioactive compounds that potentially exhibit cholesterol-lowering effects. This study investigated the hypocholesterolaemic effect of WHLB. A total of seventy-two male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups and were fed with the normal control diet, high-fat diet (HFD) and HFD containing low or high dose (10 or 48·95 %) of WHLB. High dose of WHLB significantly decreased the organ indexes of liver and abdominal fat and lipid levels of plasma and liver in HFD rats. The lipid regulation effect of WHLB, which was reconfirmed through hepatocyte morphologic observation, was accompanied by a large excretion of bile acids in the small intestinal contents and the faeces. Real-time PCR analyses, which were further reconfirmed through Western blot analyses, revealed that a high dose of WHLB significantly enhanced the hepatic expressions of AMP-activated protein kinase α, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, LDL receptor, liver X receptor, and PPARα and decreased the expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. It also enhanced the ileal expression of farnesoid X receptor and resulted in the decrease of expression of apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter. WHLB exhibited hypocholesterolaemic effects mainly by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis, cholesterol accumulation in peripheral tissue, and bile acid reabsorption and by stimulating bile acid synthesis.
The liver is to date the best example of a sexually dimorphic non-reproductive organ. Over 1,000 genes are differentially expressed between sexes indicating that female and male livers are two metabolically distinct organs. The spectrum of liver diseases is broad and is usually prevalent in one or the other sex, with different contributing genetic and environmental factors. It is thus difficult to predict individual's disease outcomes and treatment options. Systems approaches including mathematical modeling can aid importantly in understanding the multifactorial liver disease etiology leading toward tailored diagnostics, prognostics and therapy. The currently established computational models of hepatic metabolism that have proven to be essential for understanding of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are limited to the description of gender-independent response or reflect solely the response of the males. Herein we present LiverSex, the first sex-based multi-tissue and multi-level liver metabolic computational model. The model was constructed based on in silico liver model SteatoNet and the object-oriented modeling. The crucial factor in adaptation of liver metabolism to the sex is the inclusion of estrogen and androgen receptor responses to respective hormones and the link to sex-differences in growth hormone release. The model was extensively validated on literature data and experimental data obtained from wild type C57BL/6 mice fed with regular chow and western diet. These experimental results show extensive sex-dependent changes and could not be reproduced in silico with the uniform model SteatoNet. LiverSex represents the first large-scale liver metabolic model, which allows a detailed insight into the sex-dependent complex liver pathologies, and how the genetic and environmental factors interact with the sex in disease appearance and progression. We used the model to identify the most important sex-dependent metabolic pathways, which are involved in accumulation of triglycerides representing initial steps of NAFLD. We identified PGC1A, PPARα, FXR, and LXR as regulatory factors that could become important in sex-dependent personalized treatment of NAFLD.
Over 1.4 million people are diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC) each year, making it the third most common cancer in the world. Increased screening and therapeutic modalities including improved combination treatments have reduced CRC mortality, although incidence and mortality rates are still increasing in some areas. Serum-based biomarkers are mainly used for follow-up of cancer, and are ideal due to the ease and minimally invasive nature of sample collection. Unfortunately, CEA and other serum markers have too low sensitivity for screening and preoperative diagnostic purposes. Increasing interest is focused on the possible use of biomarkers for predicting treatment response and prognosis in cancer. In this study, we have performed mass spectrometry analysis (UPLC-UDMSE) of serum samples from 19 CRC patients. Increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), which occur during local inflammation and the presence of a systemic inflammatory response, have been linked to poor prognosis in CRC patients. We chose to analyze samples according to CRP values by dividing them into the categories CRP &lt;30 and &gt;30, and, separately, according to short and long 5-year survival. The aim was to discover differentially expressed proteins associated with poor prognosis and shorter survival. We quantified 256 proteins and performed detailed statistical analyses and pathway analysis. We discovered multiple proteins that are up- or downregulated in patients with CRP &gt;30 as compared to CRP &lt;30 and in patients with short as compared to long 5-year survival. Pathways that were enriched include LXR/RXR activation, FXR/RXR activation, complement and coagulation cascades and acute phase signaling response, with some of the proteins we identified having roles in these pathways. In this study, we have identified multiple proteins, of which a few have been previously identified as potential biomarkers, and others that have been identified as potential biomarkers for CRC for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. While these proteins still need to be validated in larger patient series, this pilot study will pave the way for future studies aiming to provide better biomarkers for patients with CRC.
Nuclear receptors (NRs) represent attractive targets for the treatment of metabolic syndrome-related diseases. In addition, natural products are an interesting pool of potential ligands since they have been refined under evolutionary pressure to interact with proteins or other biological targets. This review aims to briefly summarize current basic knowledge regarding the liver X (LXR) and farnesoid X receptors (FXR) that form permissive heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXR). Natural product-based ligands for these receptors are summarized and the potential of LXR, FXR and RXR as targets in precision medicine is discussed.
SDS-PAGE combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and 2-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight/time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF/TOF) were applied to characterize the turkey seminal plasma proteome. LC-MS/MS led to the identification of 175 proteins, which were classified according to their function and to corresponding biochemical pathways. Using 2DE and MALDI TOF/TOF, 34 different turkey seminal plasma proteins could be identified, of which 20 were found in more than one spot, indicating different proteoforms of these proteins. For validation, antibodies against turkey albumin and ovoinhibitor as well as sperm acrosin were used in 2DE Western blots experiments. The bioinformatic analysis of the results indicates that turkey seminal plasma proteins may be involved in regulation of lipid metabolism [liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor (LXR/RXR) activation and farnesoid X receptor/retinoid X receptor (FXR/RXR) activation pathways)], endocytic entry of proteins and lipids at the plasma membrane (clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway), and defense against pathogens (acute phase response signaling pathway) and energy production (glycolysis and gluconeogenesis). Moreover, a comparative meta-analysis of seminal plasma proteomes from other species indicated the presence of proteins specific for avian reproduction, but distinct differences between turkey and chicken seminal plasma proteomes were detected. The results of our study provide basic knowledge of the protein composition of turkey seminal plasma highlighting important physiological pathways which may play crucial roles in the sperm environment after ejaculation. This knowledge can be the basis to further develop procedures improving the reproduction of farmed turkeys.
Phytosterols are implicated in the development of parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease. A newly proposed mechanism for phytosterol-mediated parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease is through phytosterol-facilitated hepatic proinflammatory cytokine release following exposure to intestinally derived bacteria. Whether the proinflammatory effects are liver cell specific is not known.
To determine if phytosterols cause inflammation in hepatocytes or Kupffer cells independently or require costimulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
In an in vivo study, neonatal piglets on parenteral nutrition for 11 days received an 8-hour infusion of LPS. In the in vitro studies, neonatal piglet Kupffer cells and hepatocytes were treated with media, media + 1% soy oil, or media + 1% soy oil + 100µM phytosterols. After 24-hour incubation, cells were treated with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist obeticholic acid or liver X receptor (LXR) agonist GW3965 and challenged with LPS or interleukin 1β.
LPS administration in piglets led to transient increases in proinflammatory cytokines and suppression of the transporters bile salt export pump and ATP-binding cassette transporter G5. In hepatocytes, phytosterols did not activate inflammation. Phytosterol treatment alone did not activate inflammation in Kupffer cells but, combined with LPS, synergistically increased interleukin 1β production. FXR and LXR agonists increased transporter expression in hepatocytes. GW3965 suppressed proinflammatory cytokine production in Kupffer cells, but obeticholic acid did not.
LPS suppresses transporters that control bile acid and phytosterol clearance. Phytosterols alone do not cause inflammatory response. However, with costimulation by LPS, phytosterols synergistically maximize the inflammatory response in Kupffer cells.
In silico docking of a chemical library with the ligand-binding domain of thyroid hormone nuclear receptor-beta (TRbeta) suggested that farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), a key intermediate in cholesterol synthesis and protein farnesylation, might function as an agonist. Surprisingly, addition of FPP to cells activated TR as well as the classical steroid hormone receptors but not peroxisome proliferative-activating receptors, farnesoid X receptor, liver X receptor, or several orphan nuclear receptors the ligands of which are unknown. FPP enhanced receptor-coactivator binding in vitro and in vivo, and elevation of FPP levels in cells by squalene synthetase or farnesyl transferase inhibitors leads to activation. The FPP effect was blocked by selective receptor antagonists, and in silico docking with 143 nuclear receptor ligand-binding domain structures revealed that FPP only docked with the agonist conformation of those receptors activated by FPP. Our results suggest that certain nuclear receptors maintain a common structural feature that may reflect an action of FPP on an ancient nuclear receptor or that FPP could function as a ligand for one of the many orphan nuclear receptors the ligands of which have not yet been identified. This finding also has potential interesting implications that may, in part, explain the pleotropic effects of statins as well as certain actions of farnesylation inhibitors in cells.
The nuclear receptors of the NR1H and NR1I subgroups include the constitutive androstane receptor, pregnane X receptor, farnesoid X receptors, liver X receptors, and vitamin D receptor. The newly emerging functions of these related receptors are under the control of metabolic pathways, including metabolism of xenobiotics, bile acids, cholesterol, and calcium. This review summarizes results of structural, pharmacologic, and genetic studies of these receptors.
Angiopoietin-like protein 3 (angptl3), a member of the vascular endothelial growth factor family, was shown to play an important role in regulating lipid metabolism. To elucidate the mechanism by which PPARbeta represses angptl3 promoter activity, reporter constructs were prepared and transfection analysis carried out. PPARbeta repressed angptl3-Luc promoter activity and activation of PPARbeta by L-165041, a PPARbeta-specific ligand, increased the extent of repression. The repression by L-165041 was lost in angptl3-Luc plasmids having a deleted or mutated LXRalpha binding site (DR4). PPARbetaL405R, deficient in RXRalpha binding, had no effect on angptl3-Luc promoter activity. PPARbeta did not repress the activity of GAL4-LXRalpha which activates of GAL4DBD TK-Luc independent of RXR. Addition of RXRalpha completely abolished the repression of angptl3-Luc activity by PPARbeta. Mammalian two-hybrid analysis revealed that PPARbeta ligand binding enhanced the dissociation of the LXRalpha-RXRalpha heterodimer. Gel shift assays also indicated that PPARbeta ligand binding increased dissociation of LXRalpha/RXRalpha binding to a DR4 oligonucleotide probe; addition of RXRalpha restored the binding lost by addition of PPARbeta. Collectively, these results suggest that the binding of PPARbeta-specific ligand enhances the affinity between RXRalpha and activated PPARbeta and thus may regulate angptl3 gene expression through a DR4 element by competing with LXRalpha for RXRalpha.
Inflammation is a central component of several chronic human diseases, including atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes. Several nuclear receptors repress inflammatory responses, but their molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. The nuclear receptor superfamily is composed of transcription factors that have emerged as key regulators of inflammation and lipid homeostasis. These include the glucocorticoid receptor, which inhibits inflammatory programs of gene expression in response to natural corticosteroids and synthetic anti-inflammatory ligands such as dexamethasone. In addition, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and liverXreceptors, in response to endogenous eicosanoids and oxysterols, respectively, modulate transcriptional pathways involved in inflammatory responses and lipid homeostasis.
Drugs that target the nuclear hormone receptor family constitute one of the largest and most potent groups of pharmaceuticals currently in use. However, although many of these human nuclear receptors have been clearly demonstrated to be key sensors and regulators of lipid metabolism, the full pharmacological potential of this drug target class has not been fully explored. There are two main reasons for this. First, a rationale approach is needed to identify pharmacologically selective drug candidates to nuclear receptors that have a large therapeutic window between the beneficial effects and the unwanted side effects. This appears to apply to all ligand-regulated nuclear receptors, including those nuclear receptors more recently proposed as novel targets for diseases related to lipid metabolism such as the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, liver X receptors and farnesoid X-activated receptor. The second reason is that any sub-group of nuclear receptors important for the regulation of lipid metabolism might be pharmacologically inaccessible by conventional low molecular weight compounds, owing to the lack of a classical ligand-binding-pocket, as recently revealed by X-ray crystallography. Accordingly, targeting of classical nuclear receptor family members with better characterized endocrinology and roles in lipid metabolism, such as the thyroid and steroid hormone receptors, could become of renewed pharmacological interest, as these targets provide well-characterized alternatives to the more recently discovered nuclear receptors.
Nuclear receptors belong to a superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors, which are involved in regulating gene expression in development, cell differentiation, physiological and metabolic processes. In this review we summarize the studies of nuclear receptor and present the progresses in the researches on nuclear receptor and lipid physiology, nuclear receptor and tumor, and nuclear receptor and co-regulators.
Cholesterol, fatty acids, fat-soluble vitamins, and other lipids present in our diets are not only nutritionally important but serve as precursors for ligands that bind to receptors in the nucleus. To become biologically active, these lipids must first be absorbed by the intestine and transformed by metabolic enzymes before they are delivered to their sites of action in the body. Ultimately, the lipids must be eliminated to maintain a normal physiological state. The need to coordinate this entire lipid-based metabolic signaling cascade raises important questions regarding the mechanisms that govern these pathways. Specifically, what is the nature of communication between these bioactive lipids and their receptors, binding proteins, transporters, and metabolizing enzymes that links them physiologically and speaks to a higher level of metabolic control? Some general principles that govern the actions of this class of bioactive lipids and their nuclear receptors are considered here, and the scheme that emerges reveals a complex molecular script at work.
Intracellular and extracellular cholesterol levels are tightly maintained within a narrow concentration range by an intricate transcriptional control mechanism. Excess cholesterol can be converted into oxysterols, signaling molecules, which modulate the activity of a number of transcription factors, as to limit accumulation of excess of cholesterol. Two key regulatory pathways are affected by oxysterols. The first pathway involves the uptake and de novo synthesis of cholesterol and is controlled by the family of sterol response element binding proteins, whose activity is regulated by a sterol-dependent feedback mechanism. The second pathway, which only recently has become a topic of interest, involves the activation by a feedforward mechanism of cholesterol utilization for either bile acid or steroid hormone synthesis by oxysterol-activated nuclear receptors, such as liver X receptor and steroidogenic factor-1. Furthermore, biosynthesis and enterohepatic reabsorption of bile acids are regulated by the farnesol X receptor, a receptor activated by bile acids. Both the feedback inhibition of cholesterol uptake and production and the stimulation of cholesterol utilization will ultimately result in a lowering of the intracellular cholesterol concentration and allow for a fine-tuned regulation of the cholesterol concentration.
Clinicians may soon be able to mount a multipronged attack against cholesterol, the artery-clogging lipid whose buildup in the body is a major contributor to heart attacks and other cardiovascular diseases. In work reported on page 1524, a team has pinpointed a biological master switch in mice that controls three pathways that work together to both rid the body of excess cholesterol and prevent its absorption from the intestine. The work suggests a new mechanism for reducing cholesterol, for example, with drugs that turn up the activity of the master switch, a protein known as the retinoid X receptor.
Steroid and thyroid hormones and vitamin A metabolites (retinoids) regulate the expression of complex gene programs by binding to members of the nuclear receptor family of ligand-activated transcription factors. The nuclear receptor family also includes many "orphan" members that currently lack known ligands but that represent candidate receptors for new hormones. Recently, natural and synthetic ligands have been identified for several orphan receptors and used to dissect their biological roles. This "reverse endocrinology" strategy has resulted in the discovery of unanticipated nuclear signaling pathways for retinoids, fatty acids, eicosanoids, and steroids with important physiological and pharmacological ramifications.
Vertebrate xenobiotic receptors are ligand-activated nuclear receptors (NRs) that bind exogenous biologically active chemicals before activating the transcription of genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism and excretion. Typically, xenobiotic receptors have ligand binding domains (LBDs) that can accommodate a structurally diverse array of molecules and in addition display high levels of inter-taxa sequence diversity suggestive of positive selection. Pursuing the idea that xenobiotic receptors may adaptively evolve to bind toxic chemicals commonly present in an organism's environment/diet, we examined ligand binding by a xenobiotic receptor orthologue of a marine filter-feeding organism. The solitary tunicate Ciona intestinalis (Phylum Chordata) genome encodes an orthologue of the vertebrate pregnane X receptor (PXR) and vitamin D receptor (VDR), here denoted CiVDR/PXRα. In a luciferase reporter assay the CiVDR/PXRα was activated, at nanomolar concentrations, by two of four natural marine microalgal biotoxins tested (okadaic acid, EC50 = 18.2 ± 0.9 nM and pectenotoxin-2, EC50 = 37.0 ± 3.5 nM) along with 1 of 11 synthetic toxicants (esfenvalerate: EC50 = 0.59 ± 0.7 μM). Two related C. intestinalis NRs, orthologous to vertebrate farnesoid X receptor and liver X receptors, respectively, along with the PXR of a freshwater fish (zebrafish, Danio rerio), were not activated by any of the 15 chemicals tested. In contrast, human PXR was activated by okadaic acid at similar concentrations to CiVDR/PXRα (EC50 = 7.2 ± 1.1 nM) but not by pectenotoxin-2. A common features pharmacophore developed for the CiVDR/PXRα ligand consisted of an off-center hydrogen bond acceptor flanked by two hydrophobic regions. The results of this study are consistent with the original hypothesis that natural toxins, present in the diet of filter-feeding marine invertebrates, may have acted as selective agents in the molecular evolution of tunicate xenobiotic receptors. Bioassays based on tunicate xenobiotic receptor activation may find application in marine environmental monitoring and bioprospecting.
Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a cluster of different diseases, namely central obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia, together with a pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory state. These metabolic abnormalities are often associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer. Dietary and lifestyle modifications are currently believed more effective than pharmacological therapies in the management of MS patients. Nevertheless, the relatively low grade of compliance of patients to these recommendations, as well as the failure of current therapies, highlights the need for the discovery of new pharmacological and nutraceutic approaches. A deeper knowledge of the patho-physiological events that initiate and support the MS is mandatory. Lipid-sensing nuclear receptors (NRs) are the master transcriptional regulators of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and inflammatory responses, thus standing as suitable targets. This review focuses on the physiological relevance of the NRs (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, liver X receptors, and farnesoid X receptor) in the control of whole-body homeostasis, with a special emphasis on lipid and glucose metabolism, and on the relationships between metabolic unbalances, systemic inflammation, and the onset of CVD. Future perspectives and possible clinical applications are also presented.
Introduction of an alkylcarboxylic acid unit, which is a partial structure of endogenous peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) ligands, into a phenethylphenylphthalimide skeleton, which possesses liver X receptor (LXR) antagonistic activity, afforded novel PPAR ligands. The results of structure-activity relationship analysis and docking studies led us to the potent PPAR agonists 13c-e. The absolute configuration of 13c-e affects the PPAR subtype selectivity.
Diabetes is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease in developed countries. In spite of glucose and blood pressure control, for example by use of angiotensin II receptor blockers, diabetic nephropathy still develops and progresses in affected patients and the development of additional protective therapeutic interventions is, therefore, required. Nuclear hormone receptors are transcription factors that regulate carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, the immune response, and inflammation. These receptors also modulate the development of fibrosis. As a result of their diverse biological effects, nuclear hormone receptors have become major pharmaceutical targets for the treatment of a host of diseases. The increasing prevalence of diabetic nephropathy has led intense investigation into the role that nuclear hormone receptors may have in slowing or preventing the progression of renal disease. This role of nuclear hormone receptors would be associated with improvements in metabolism, the immune response, and inflammation. Eight nuclear receptors have shown a renoprotective effect in the context of diabetic nephropathy. This Review discusses the evidence regarding the beneficial effects of the activation of these receptors in preventing the progression of diabetic nephropathy and describes how the discovery and development of compounds that modulate the activity of nuclear hormone receptors may provide potential additional therapeutic approaches in the management of diabetic nephropathy.
Chemerin is associated with insulin resistance and is expressed in the liver. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is related to impaired insulin sensitivity, but studies evaluating hepatic and serum chemerin in NAFLD resulted in discordant data.
Chemerin mRNA was determined in the liver tissue obtained from 33 controls and 76 NAFLD patients. Chemerin serum levels were measured in a different cohort of patients with ultrasound-diagnosed NAFLD and the respective controls. Hepatic stellate cells and hepatocytes were exposed to selected metabolites and nuclear receptor agonists to study the regulation of chemerin. Effect of recombinant chemerin on hepatocyte released proteins was analysed.
Hepatic chemerin expression was not related to BMI, gender, type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Chemerin mRNA did not correlate with steatosis and was negatively associated with inflammation, fibrosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) score. Patients with NASH had lower chemerin mRNA compared to those with borderline NASH and controls. Factors with a role in NASH mostly did not regulate chemerin in the liver cells. Of note, liver X receptor agonist reduced chemerin protein. Serum chemerin was not changed in NAFLD. Levels positively correlated with age, waist-to-hip ratio, systolic blood pressure, serum FGF21 and lipocalin 2, and negatively with transferrin saturation. Chemerin induced FGF21 in supernatants of primary human hepatocytes. Hepcidin, a major regulator of iron homoeostasis and lipocalin 2, were not regulated by chemerin.
Chemerin mRNA is reduced in the liver of NASH patients, and liver X receptor seems to have a role herein.
We report the design, synthesis, and physicochemical/biological evaluation of novel silanol derivative 6 (sila-T) as a silanol analog of multi-target nuclear receptor modulator T0901317 (5). Compound 6 showed intermediate hydrophobicity between the corresponding alcohol 13 and perfluoroalcohol 5. While 5 exhibited potent activities toward liver X receptor α and β, farnesoid X receptor, pregnane X receptor (PXR) and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor (ROR)γ, silanol 6 exhibited activity only toward PXR and RORs. Incorporation of silanol instead of perfluoroalcohol is a promising option for developing novel target-selective, biologically active compounds. 
We aimed to measure simultaneously the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes (DME) and transcription factors (TF) with high importance in cardiovascular physiopathology in lymphocytes from healthy subjects. RNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 20 subjects from the Stanislas Cohort. We used a microarray approach to measure 16 DME and 13 TF. Cytochromes P450 (P450s), including CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2J2, CYP2D6, CYP1A1, CYP4F2, CYP4A11, CYP2E1, CYP11B2, CYP2C18, and CYP2A6, were expressed in all the subjects. CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 were not expressed. Glutathione S-transferases (GST) were expressed, but GSTM1 was seen only in some subjects. Pregnane X receptor (PXR), myocyte enhancer factor 2, vitamin D receptor, liver X receptor (LXR)-alpha, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), T-cell factor 7, constitutive androstane receptor, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) were expressed in the majority of the subjects. Glucocorticoid receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma, and LXRbeta were expressed only in some individuals. PPARalpha mRNA was found in one subject only, and farnesoid X-activated receptor was not expressed. In addition, we found significant correlations between the expression of AHR, ARNT, and CYP1A1 and between PXR and P450 involved in leukotriene metabolism (CYP2C, CYP4F2, CYP4A11, CYP2J2, and CYP11B2). We describe here for the first time the presence of the majority of TF and DME in PBMC of healthy subjects without previous induction. The expression of these genes in lymphocytes could be a useful tool for further studying the physiological and pathological variations of DME and TF related to environment, to drug intake, and to cardiovascular metabolic cycles.
Retinoid X receptor (RXR) forms heterodimers with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs, with subtypes of alpha, delta and gamma), and the heterodimers can be activated by either an RXR or a PPAR subtype-specific ligand. Based on the chemical structure of the RXR natural ligand, 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA), we designed and synthesized a retinoid-like compound, CS018. In vitro characterizations by cell-based reporter gene assays indicated that CS018 activated RXR homodimers and the heterodimers of RXR with PPARs, but not with farnesoid X-activated receptor (FXR) and liver X-activated receptor (LXR). Furthermore, RT-PCR results showed that CS018 induced the expression of the PPARgamma target genes, CD36 and lipoprotein lipase (LPL). In vivo studies on the diabetic db/db mice demonstrated that CS018 dramatically lowered the animal blood glucose levels. CS018 thus may represent a new retinoid-like compound that activates RXR/PPARs and has potential therapeutic applications in type 2 diabetes and other metabolic diseases.
Ileal bile acid-binding protein (I-BABP) is a 14 kDa cytosolic protein which binds bile acids with a high affinity. It is thought to be implicated in the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids and, hence, in cholesterol homeostasis. Using a combination of in vivo and in vitro experiments, we have recently shown that I-BABP gene expression can be indirectly up-regulated by cholesterol through the activation of sterol-responsive element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) by liver X-receptor (LXR). We report here that I-BABP can be also a direct target for LXR. I-BABP regulation by LXR is maintained when the SREBP binding site is deleted in the I-BABP promoter and occurs, in the absence of conventional LXRE sequences, through an IR1 sequence previously identified as a farnesoid X-receptor-responsive element (FXRE). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that the LXR/RXR heterodimer specifically recognizes the FXRE. Collectively, these data strongly suggest that LXR can regulate the I-BABP gene by both direct and indirect mechanisms.
The coordinated effect of lipid activated nuclear hormone receptors; liver X receptor (LXR), bound by oxysterol ligands and farnesoid X receptor (FXR), bound by bile acid ligands, act as genetic transcription factors to cause feed-forward cholesterol catabolism to bile acids and feedback repression of bile acid synthesis, respectively. It is the coordinated action of LXR and FXR, each dimerized to retinoid X receptor, that signal nuclear DNA response elements to encode proteins that prevent excessive cholesterol accumulation and bile salt toxicity, respectively. LXR helps prevent hypercholesterolemia by enhancing transporters for cholesterol efflux that enhance reverse cholesterol transport, while FXR enhances intestinal reabsorption and preservation of bile salts by increasing the ileal bile acid binding protein. FXR also targets sodium taurocholate cotransport peptide and bile salt export pump (protein) genes to limit bile salt uptake and enhance export, respectively, which prevents bile salt toxicity. Other nuclear hormone receptors such as pregnan X receptor, which share the obligate partner, retinoid X receptor, and vitamin D receptor also function as bile acid sensors to signal detoxification by hydroxylation of toxic bile acids. Pharmacologically targeted receptor agonists (or antagonists) may be developed that alter cholesterol and bile salt concentrations by modulating nuclear hormone receptors and/or their coactivators or corepressors to positively affect cholesterol homeostasis and bile salt metabolism. It is the coordinated transcription factor action of LXR, which responds to ligand binding of circulating oxysterols in both liver and peripheral tissues, and FXR responding to bile salts within the enterohepatic circulation that make possible the regulation of cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis.
To determine the feasibility of using dominant negative nuclear receptors to dissect the regulation of inducible gene expression in primary cultured hepatocytes, a series of dominant negative nuclear receptor expression plasmids were designed with truncated AF-2 subdomains.
Plasmids expressing dominant negative or wild-type constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), pregnane X receptor (PXR), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), liver X receptor (LXR), or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) were transiently cotransfected into primary cultured rat hepatocytes, together with an appropriate reporter plasmid.
Treatment with prototypic inducers, 10(-4) M phenobarbital (CAR activator), 10(-5) M pregnenolone 16alpha-carbonitrile (PXR activator), 3x10(-5) M chenodeoxycholate (FXR activator), or 10(-4) M ciprofibrate (PPARalpha activator), significantly activated expression from the corresponding reporter plasmid. Treatment with 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (LXR activator) only weakly activated the LXR-responsive reporter, while pregnenolone 16alpha-carbonitrile treatment significantly activated this reporter. Cotransfection with wild-type LXRalpha strongly enhanced 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol-inducible expression from the LXR-responsive reporter. Cotransfection of hepatocyte cultures with each of the dominant negative nuclear receptor plasmids significantly inhibited inducible expression of the corresponding reporter while, with one exception (LXRalpha), cotransfection with the wild-type receptor moderately enhanced or had little effect on reporter expression. When each dominant negative nuclear receptor was cross-examined against all inducer-reporter pairs, effects on multiple inducer-reporter pairs were frequently observed. However, in general, only cotransfection with the appropriate dominant negative inhibited inducible reporter expression to a greater extent than did cotransfection with the corresponding wild-type receptor.
We suggest that the application of dominant negative nuclear receptors has utility in transient transfection studies aimed at discerning the regulatory role of individual nuclear receptor transcription factors in inducible hepatic gene expression, provided that appropriate controls are employed.
OATP8 (gene symbol: SLC21A8) is a multispecific uptake system for organic anions, xenobiotics, and peptides expressed at the basolateral (sinusoidal) membrane of human hepatocytes. We investigated whether OATP8 gene expression is regulated by the nuclear receptors farnesoid X receptor/bile acid receptor (FXR/BAR; NR1H4), pregnane X receptor (PXR), or liver X receptor (LXR).
OATP8 promoter function was studied in reporter assays. OATP8 expression in cells was quantitated by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
The bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), a ligand of FXR/BAR, but not clotrimazole or 25-hydroxycholesterol, ligands of PXR or LXR, respectively, induced OATP8 promoter activity. An inverted hexanucleotide repeat motif (IR-1 element) in the promoter sequence was shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays to bind the FXR (9-cis-retinoic acid receptor [RXRalpha]) heterodimer. Targeted mutagenesis of the IR-1 element abolished inducibility of the OATP8 promoter by CDCA, confirming its role as a bile acid response element. CDCA treatment increased OATP8 messenger RNA levels in human hepatoma cells, suggesting a physiologic role for FXR-mediated OATP8 gene regulation.
OATP8 gene expression is regulated by bile acids via FXR/BAR. Induction of OATP8 could serve to maintain hepatic extraction of xenobiotics and peptides in conditions of increased intracellular bile acids.
The major metabolic pathway for elimination of cholesterol is via conversion to bile acids. In addition to this metabolic function, bile acids also act as signaling molecules that negatively regulate their own biosynthesis. However, the precise nature of this signaling pathway has been elusive. We have isolated an endogenous biliary component (chenodeoxycholic acid) that selectively activates the orphan nuclear receptor, FXR. Structure-activity analysis defined a subset of related bile acid ligands that activate FXR and promote coactivator recruitment. Finally, we show that ligand-occupied FXR inhibits transactivation from the oxysterol receptor LXR alpha, a positive regulator of cholesterol degradation. We suggest that FXR (BAR) is the endogenous bile acid sensor and thus an important regulator of cholesterol homeostasis.
Epigenetic mechanisms play an important role in the early stages of carcinogenesis. Moringa isothiocyanate (MIC-1) is a major bioactive component derived from Moringa oleifera that has considerable antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. However, how MIC-1 influences epigenomic alterations in TPA-mediated JB6 cell carcinogenic transformation has not been evaluated. In this study, DNA and RNA isolated from TPA-induced JB6 cells in the presence or absence of MIC-1 were subjected to DNA Methyl-seq and RNA-seq to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs), respectively. When JB6 cells were challenged with TPA alone, there was a significant alteration of DEGs and DMRs; importantly, MIC-1 treatment reversed the patterns of some of the DEGs and DMRs. Transcriptome and CpG methylome profiling was performed in Ingenuity® Pathway Analysis (IPA) software to analyze the altered signaling pathways. Several anti-inflammatory responses, antioxidative stress-related pathways, and anticancer-related pathways were identified to be affected by MIC-1. These pathways included NF-kB, IL-1, LPS/IL-1-mediated inhibition of RXR function, Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response, p53, and PTEN signaling pathways. Examination of correlations between transcriptomic and CpG methylome profiles yielded a small subset of genes, including the cancer-related genes Tmpt, Tubb3, and Muc2; the GTPases Gchfr and Igtp; and the cell cycle-related gene Cdc7. Taken together, our results show the potential contributions of epigenomic changes in DNA CpG methylation to gene expression to molecular pathways active in TPA-induced JB6 cells and demonstrate that MIC-1 can reverse these changes, supporting the potential preventive/treatment effects of MIC-1 against skin carcinogenesis.
Retinoid X receptors (RXRs) control a wide variety of functions by virtue of their dimerization with other nuclear hormone receptors (NRs), contributing thereby to activities of different signaling pathways. We review known RXR ligands as transcriptional modulators of specific RXR-dimers and the associated biological processes. We also discuss the physiological relevance of such ligands, which remains frequently a matter of debate and which at present is best met by member(s) of a novel family of retinoids, postulated as Vitamin A5. Through comparison with other natural, but also with synthetic ligands, we discuss high diversity in the modes of ligand binding to RXRs resulting in agonistic or antagonistic profiles and selectivity towards specific subtypes of permissive heterodimers. Despite such diversity, direct ligand binding to the ligand binding pocket resulting in agonistic activity was preferentially preserved in the course of animal evolution pointing to its functional relevance, and potential for existence of other, species-specific endogenous RXR ligands sharing the same mode of function.
The frequency of transcription initiation at specific RNA polymerase II promoters is, in many cases, related to the ability of the promoter to recruit the transcription machinery to a specific site. However, there may also be functional differences in the properties of assembled transcription complexes that are promoter-specific or regulator-dependent and affect their activity. Transcription complexes formed on variants of the adenovirus major late (AdML) promoter were found to differ in several ways. Mutations in the initiator element increased the sarkosyl sensitivity of the rate of elongation and decreased the rate of early steps in initiation as revealed by a sarkosyl challenge assay that exploited the resistance of RNA synthesis to high concentrations of sarkosyl after formation of one or two phospho-diester bonds. Similar, but clearly distinct, effects were also observed after deletion of the binding site for upstream stimulatory factor from the AdML promoter. In contrast, deletion of binding sites for nuclear factor 1 and Oct-1, as well as mutations in the recognition sequence for initiation site binding protein, were without apparent effect on transcription complexes on templates containing the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter.
Recent studies have shown that mutations in four transcription factors, hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 alpha (HNF-4 alpha), hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha (HNF-1 alpha), hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 beta (HNF-1 beta), and insulin promoter factor-1 (IPF-1), are responsible for maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) which is characterised by an early age of onset and autosomal dominant inheritance. MODY is not an uncommon disorder and in fact could account for about 2 to 5% of all cases of type 2 diabetes. Moreover, mutations in HNF-1 beta, which functions as a homodimer or a heterodimer with HNF-1 alpha, have been identified in a few families with MODY and severe kidney disease. Mutations in the coding regions or in the promotors of these nuclear factors are responsible for severe insulin secretory defects and for major hyperglycaemia associated with microvascular complications. The role of transcription factors in the development of the more common late-onset type 2 diabetes is still under investigation. Some mutations in HNF-1 alpha were identified in subjects with atypical forms of insulin-dependent diabetes, and a mutation in HNF-4 alpha and several mutations in IPF-1 were found in type 2 diabetic families with typical late-onset NIDDM. Altogether, these data suggest that non-MODY monofactorial forms of late-onset NIDDM, due to islet transcription factor defects, exist.
Recently, hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha(HNF-1alpha, which is encoded by the TCF1 gene) mutations were reported in a subset of patients with maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY3). We studied the contribution of TCF1 to genetic susceptibility to common non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type 2) in Japanese subjects by investigating allelic association with type 2 diabetes use of three markers. We also studied the frequency of the G191D mutation, the only mutation of TCF1 reported so far in late-onset type 2 diabetes. A total of 356 subjects were studied. There were no significant differences in allele frequency of the three markers between patients with type 2 diabetes and control subjects. A G191D mutation was not found in the subjects studied, giving a frequency of less than 0.4% in common type 2 diabetes. The lack of association of type 2 diabetes with three markers in and near TCF1 suggests that mutations in TCF1 derived from a limited number of founders are not a major cause of common type 2 diabetes even in the genetically homogeneous Japanese population. The data also indicate that the G191D mutation in TCF1 plays little, if any, role in susceptibility to common type 2 diabetes in the Japanese.
Activating transcription factor 1 (ATF1) and cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB) activate transcription through CREs located in the promoters of cellular and viral genes. We previously described a monoclonal antibody (mAb41.4) that prevents ATF1 binding to DNA and reduces CRE-driven promoter activity in vitro (Orten, D. J., Strawhecker, J. M., Sanderson, S. D., Huang, D., Prytowsky, M. B. , and Hinrichs, S. H. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 32254-32263). A single chain Fv (scFv) fragment from the mAb41.4-expressing hybridoma was generated to provide a means to investigate transcription factor function via intracellular expression of the scFv fragment. The affinity of scFv4 (subgroup: VL kappa-III, VH miscellaneous) for ATF1 was similar to that of the parental mAb and the Fab fragment, but it demonstrated greater inhibitory activity and reacted with CREB. scFv4 disrupted the binding of both ATF1 and CREB in electrophoretic mobility shift assays and reduced expression of CRE-driven expression in vitro. Transient expression of scFv had no effect on the non-CRE-containing adenovirus major late promoter. The proliferating cell nuclear antigen promoter, containing two CREs, was significantly more sensitive to inhibition by scFv than the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter, containing five CREs. Cotransfection of either ATF1 or CREB in the presence of scFv restored basal levels of expression. The intracellular expression of scFv provides a unique means to investigate the roles of the transcription factors ATF1 and CREB.
Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous subtype of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) characterised by early onset, autosomal dominant inheritance and a primary defect in insulin secretion. To date, three MODY genes have been identified on chromosomes 20q (MODY1/hepatic nuclear factor (HNF)-4alpha), 7p (MODY2/glucokinase) and 12q (MODY3/HNF-1alpha). Mutations in MODY2/glucokinase result in mild chronic hyperglycaemia as a result of reduced pancreatic beta-cell responsiveness to glucose, and decreased net accumulation of hepatic glycogen and increased hepatic gluconeogenesis after meals. In contrast, MODY1 and MODY3 are characterised by severe insulin secretory defects, and by major hyperglycaemia associated with microvascular complications. The role of the three known MODY genes in susceptibility to the more common late-onset NIDDM remain uncertain. Genetic studies seem to exclude a role as major susceptibility genes, but leave unresolved whether they may have a minor role in a polygenic context or an important role in particular populations.
Non-insulin dependent diabetes (NIDDM) is a polygenic heterogeneous disorder of glucose homeostasis. Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a monogenic subtype of NIDDM characterised by early-onset (&lt; 25 years) and autosomal dominant inheritance. Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF-1 alpha) gene have recently been shown to cause MODY. The incidence of mutations in this gene in MODY and late-onset NIDDM is not known. We have developed a rapid specific polymerase chain reaction test for HNF-1 alpha mutations; this test involves the use of fluorescently labelled forward primers and modified reverse primers to detect length polymorphisms resulting from frameshift mutations. With this method, we have screened 102 MODY probands, viz. 60 defined according to strict diagnostic criteria (autosomal dominant inheritance and at least one member diagnosed age &lt; 25 years) and 95 late-onset NIDDM probands (diagnosed 35-70 years with &gt; or = 1 affected relative), for the presence of 9 known HNF-1 alpha frameshift mutations, including 6 that occur at two sites for recurring mutation (residues 291/292 and 379). Mutations were detected in 11 of the strictly defined MODY probands and one mutation was also found in a single subject with early-onset NIDDM but no family history of the disease. The HNF-1 alpha frameshift mutations were not detected in any late-onset NIDDM subjects, suggesting these mutations do not have a major role in the pathogenesis of NIDDM. Our results indicate that the prevalence of the nine frameshift mutations in strictly defined UK MODY is 18%, with the P291fsinsC mutation alone having a frequency of 13%.
Oxidative stress (tert-butylhydroquinone) rapidly induced metallothionein-I gene expression in mouse Hepa cells, and this effect was mediated predominantly through metal response promoter elements in transient transfection assays. In vivo genomic footprinting of the mouse metallothionein-I promoter after treatment of Hepa cells with hydrogen peroxide, tert-butylhydroquinone, or zinc suggested a rapid increase in occupancy of the metal response elements. More subtle changes also occurred in the constitutive genomic footprint at the composite major late transcription factor/antioxidant response element. This element may, in part, mediate induction by hydrogen peroxide. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated a rapid (30 min) increase in the DNA binding activity of metal-responsive transcription factor-1 in Hepa cells treated with any of these inducers. In control cells, upstream stimulatory factor binding with the major late transcription factor site, and a nuclear protein complex distinct from AP-1, but specific for the antioxidant response element, were detected. The amounts of these complexes were not altered after these treatments. These studies indicate that metal-responsive transcription factor-1 plays a role in activating mouse metallothionein-I gene transcription in response to reactive oxygen species.
Ku is a ubiquitous and abundant DNA binding protein. Recently, it has been shown that Ku plays a crucial role in double stranded-DNA (dsDNA) break repair such as occurs during the V(D)J recombination of Ig genes. Ku has also been found to provide DNA binding activity to the catalytic domain of DNA-PK which is known to phosphorylate several transcription factors, suggesting that Ku is a multifunctional protein that participates as a component of several functional DNA-protein complexes. Here, we examined the interaction of Ku with several DNA binding proteins. Firstly, the DNA binding interaction between Ku and well-characterized transcription factors (OTF-1, Sp-1, AP-1) was analysed by EMSA. Although sequence non-specific, Ku was strongly competitive with these sequence specific transcription factors on compatible DNA elements, displacing them because of its high affinity association with DNA ends. Secondly, to determine whether this competitive effect was functionally relevant, we tested Ku in an in vitro transcription system with the adenovirus major late promoter. We found that Ku inhibited transcription from linear, but not from circular template DNA. These results suggest that Ku inhibits transcription when it is able to bind to template DNA and that the inhibition is the result of Ku displacing specific transcription factors from DNA.
IL-2 stimulates the proliferative response of various lymphoid cells. Previous studies showed an increase in intracellular levels of cAMP concomitant with an increase in phosphorylation of discrete proteins by protein kinase A at late G1 phase in mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes. Thus, experiments were undertaken to study nuclear proteins that bind to the cAMP-responsive enhancer (CRE) in cloned T lymphocytes stimulated with IL-2. With the use of a 32P-labeled CRE consensus sequence in a DNA binding gel mobility shift assay, we showed that IL-2 stimulation resulted in the induction of two major DNA-protein complexes at late G1/S during the cell cycle. This binding was competed in a dose-dependent manner by a nonlabeled CRE oligonucleotide but was not competed by a nonlabeled AP-1 oligonucleotide. Rapamycin, a potent immunosuppressant, which arrests IL-2-stimulated T lymphocytes at G1/S, inhibited the IL-2-induced CRE binding activities concomitantly with inhibition of DNA synthesis. By using specific Abs in a gel mobility shift assay, we identified two known CREB/ATF transcription factors in the IL-2-induced CRE complexes: the CRE binding factor (CREB), and ATF1. The induction of CREB binding by IL-2 was not associated with an increase in its abundance but was associated with a major increase in CREB phosphorylation that was particularly prominent at late G1/S. However, we found that G1/S progression induced by IL-2 was not associated with an increase in the intracellular levels of cAMP. These results suggest that 1) the transcription factors CREB and ATF1 and possibly other CRE binding proteins may have an important role in the modulation of specific gene expression at G1/S during cell cycle progression induced by IL-2. 2) The involvement of these CRE binding transcription factors in IL-2-stimulated cells is regulated via a mechanism that is not cAMP dependent.
During liver development, the tandem alpha 1-fetoprotein (AFP)/albumin locus is triggered at the AFP end and then asymmetrically enhanced; this is followed by autonomous repression of the AFP-encoding gene. To understand this regulation better, we characterized the two early developmental stage-specific DNase I-hypersensitive (DH) sites so far identified in rat liver AFP/albumin chromatin: an intergenic DH-enhancer site and the AFP DH-promoter site. Mutation-transfection analyses circumscribed the DH-enhancer domain to a 200-bp DNA segment stringently conserved among species. Targeted mutations, DNA-protein-binding assays, and coexpression experiments pinpointed C/EBP as the major activatory component of the intergenic enhancer. Structure-function relationships at the AFP DH-promoter site defined a discrete glucocorticoid-regulated domain activated cooperatively by HNF1 and a highly specific AFP transcription factor, FTF, which binds to a steroid receptor recognition motif. The HNF1/FTF/DNA complex is deactivated by glucocorticoid receptors or by the ubiquitous factor NF1, which eliminates HNF1 by competition at an overlapping, high-affinity binding site. We propose that the HNF1-NF1 site might serve as a developmental switch to direct autonomous AFP gene repression in late liver development. We also conclude that the intergenic enhancer is driven by C/EBP alpha primarily to fulfill albumin gene activation functions at early developmental stages. Factor FTF seems to be the key regulator of AFP gene-specific functions in carcinoembryonic states.
Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous subtype of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) characterised by early onset, autosomal dominant inheritance and a primary defect in insulin secretion. To date, three MODY genes have been identified on chromosomes 20q [hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF-4 alpha)/MODY1], 7p (glucokinase/MODY2) and 12q (HNF-1 alpha/MODY3). Mutations in glucokinase/MODY2 result in mild chronic hyperglycaemia due to reduced pancreatic beta-cell responsiveness to glucose as well as decreased net accumulation of hepatic glycogen and increased hepatic gluconeogenesis following meals. In contrast, MODY1 and MODY3 are characterised by severe insulin secretory defects and major hyperglycaemia associated with microvascular complications. The role of the three known MODY genes in susceptibility to the more common late-onset from of NIDDM remains uncertain. Genetic studies seem to exclude any function as major susceptibility genes, although they may play a minor role in a polygenic context or a major role in particular populations.
Previous analysis of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) DNA polymerase (UL54) early gene promoter demonstrated that transcriptional activation of this gene is dependent upon the interaction of cellular transcription factors with viral transactivators (J. A. Kerry, M. A. Priddy, T. Y. Jervey, C. P. Kohler, T. L. Staley, C. D. Vanson, T. R. Jones, A. C. Iskenderian, D. G. Anders, and R. M. Stenberg, J. Virol. 70:373-382, 1996). A sequence element, IR1, was shown to be the primary regulatory element of this promoter in transient assays. However, assessment of this element in the context of the viral genome revealed IR1-independent activation at late times after infection. To extend these studies, we aim to identify additional sequence elements involved in the activation of the UL54 promoter. Our present studies demonstrate that the level of binding of proteins to the ATF site in the UL54 promoter is enhanced by viral infection. Furthermore this increase is sensitive to treatment with phosphonoacetic acid (PAA), a DNA synthesis inhibitor. These data suggest that the increase in the level of ATF binding activity is regulated, either directly or indirectly, by HCMV late gene expression. By using specific antibodies, we determined that ATF-1 was a major component of the proteins binding to the UL54 ATF site at late times. In addition, we have demonstrated direct binding of recombinant ATF-1 to the UL54 ATF site. To assess the biological significance of these events, a recombinant virus construct was generated that contained the UL54 promoter with a mutation in the ATF site regulating expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene inserted between open reading frames US9 and US10. Analysis of this virus (RVATFmCAT) revealed that mutation of the ATF site does not alter the kinetics of UL54 promoter activation. However, levels of CAT mRNA and activity were reduced by 5- to 10-fold compared to those of the wild-type promoter at all stages of infection. These findings indicate that ATF-1 can regulate the levels of UL54 promoter activity at both early and late times. Furthermore, these results imply that HCMV can regulate the activity of cellular factors involved in early gene regulation.
Conventional cardiovascular imaging is invaluable for the assessment of late sequelae of atherosclerosis, such as diminished perfusion reserve and luminal stenosis. Molecular imaging provides complementary information about plaque composition and ongoing biologic processes in the vessel wall, allowing the early diagnosis and risk stratification of patients. Detection of enhanced glucose uptake, using (18)F-FDG PET, has been proposed as a noninvasive approach to track macrophage activation as a critical event in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. In this study, we determined the impact of macrophage polarization on glucose metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation.
Murine peritoneal macrophages were incubated in the presence of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) plus tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or interleukin-4 (IL-4) to induce classic (M1 and M(LPS)) or alternative (M2) polarization, respectively. Glucose uptake was measured using (3)H-deoxyglucose. Oxidative phosphorylation was evaluated using an extracellular flux analyzer. Mitochondrial DNA copy numbers were quantified by polymerase chain reaction. The expression of glucose transporter-1 (Glut-1), hexokinase-1 and -2 (Hk-1 and Hk-2, respectively), mitochondrial transcription factor-1 (Tfam), and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (Cox-1) was determined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.
Stimulation of macrophages by LPS, but not polarization with either IFN-γ plus TNF-α (M1) or IL-4 (M2), resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in (3)H-deoxyglucose uptake. Enhanced glucose uptake by M(LPS) macrophages paralleled the overexpression of rate-limiting proteins involved in transmembrane transport and intracellular trapping of glucose--that is, Glut-1, Hk-1, and Hk-2. Alternatively polarized M2 macrophages developed a markedly higher spare respiratory capacity than both nonpolarized and classically polarized M1 macrophages. M2 polarization was associated with a 4.6-fold increase in mitochondrial content of the cells, compared with nonpolarized macrophages. The expression of Tfam, a major regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, and Cox-1, a critical component of respiratory chain, was significantly increased in M2 polarized macrophages.
Polarization of macrophages induces distinct metabolic profiles with respect to glycolysis versus oxidative phosphorylation, with alternatively polarized macrophages shifting to mitochondria as their main source of adenosine triphosphate. Only M(LPS), but not M1 or M2 polarized macrophages, showed increased glucose uptake, suggesting that glucose metabolism is regulated independent of the polarization state and macrophage polarization may not be detectable by (18)F-FDG PET.
RNA silencing is used in plants as a major defence mechanism against invasive nucleic acids, such as viruses. Accordingly, plant viruses have evolved to produce counter defensive RNA-silencing suppressors (RSSs). These factors interfere in various ways with the RNA silencing machinery in cells, and thereby disturb the microRNA (miRNA) mediated endogene regulation and induce developmental and morphological changes in plants. In this study we have explored these effects using previously characterized transgenic tobacco plants which constitutively express (under CaMV 35S promoter) the helper component-proteinase (HC-Pro) derived from a potyviral genome. The transcript levels of leaves and flowers of these plants were analysed using microarray techniques (Tobacco 4 × 44 k, Agilent).
Over expression of HC-Pro RSS induced clear phenotypic changes both in growth rate and in leaf and flower morphology of the tobacco plants. The expression of 748 and 332 genes was significantly changed in the leaves and flowers, respectively, in the HC-Pro expressing transgenic plants. Interestingly, these transcriptome alterations in the HC-Pro expressing tobacco plants were similar as those previously detected in plants infected with ssRNA-viruses. Particularly, many defense-related and hormone-responsive genes (e.g. ethylene responsive transcription factor 1, ERF1) were differentially regulated in these plants. Also the expression of several stress-related genes, and genes related to cell wall modifications, protein processing, transcriptional regulation and photosynthesis were strongly altered. Moreover, genes regulating circadian cycle and flowering time were significantly altered, which may have induced a late flowering phenotype in HC-Pro expressing plants. The results also suggest that photosynthetic oxygen evolution, sugar metabolism and energy levels were significantly changed in these transgenic plants. Transcript levels of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) were also decreased in these plants, apparently leading to decreased transmethylation capacity. The proteome analysis using 2D-PAGE indicated significantly altered proteome profile, which may have been both due to altered transcript levels, decreased translation, and increased proteosomal/protease activity.
Expression of the HC-Pro RSS mimics transcriptional changes previously shown to occur in plants infected with intact viruses (e.g. Tobacco etch virus, TEV). The results indicate that the HC-Pro RSS contributes a significant part of virus-plant interactions by changing the levels of multiple cellular RNAs and proteins.
Alveolar fluid clearance is impaired by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)/nitric oxide (NO)-dependent mechanisms in acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The activation of the stress protein response (SPR) in alveolar macrophages on iNOS-dependent NO production in response to interferon gamma (IFNgamma), a major cytokine present in the airspace of patients with ALI, was investigated.
The SPR was activated in murine and primary human alveolar macrophages prior to analysis of signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 1 (STAT1) activation, iNOS mRNA and protein synthesis, and NO production.
SPR activation resulted in inhibition of IFNgamma-mediated NO production (p=0.001) with &gt;95% detergent insolubilisation of the STAT1 protein. Its subsequent proteasomal degradation was partially reversed with pretreatment of cells with the chemical chaperone glycerol. This early effect of the SPR was caused by the complete disruption of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90)-STAT1 binding, as shown by immunoprecipitation. Recovery of STAT1 activation and recovery of iNOS synthesis occurred within 12 h after SPR activation (p=0.02). NO production (as compared with non-SPR controls) did not occur until 48 h later (p=0.02). SPR-induced Hsp70 (Hsp70i) expression caused a late inhibition of NO production (p=0.02). Inhibiting &gt;50% Hsp70i expression recovered NO production to control levels whereas overexpressing Hsp70i in the absence of the SPR inhibited NO production (p=0.02).
Early inhibition of STAT1 following its dissociation from Hsp90, and later inhibition of iNOS activity by Hsp70i, represent novel mechanisms by which SPR activation modulates the IFNgamma signalling in alveolar macrophages. These results highlight a potential clinical application for Hsp90 inhibitors in modulating NO signalling during the early phase of acute lung injury.
The aims of this study were to estimate the prevalence of major maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) subtypes in Spanish MODY families and to analyze genotype-phenotype correlations. Twenty-two unrelated pediatric MODY patients and 97 relatives were screened for mutations in the coding region of the glucokinase (GCK), hepatic nuclear factor- HNF-1alpha and HNF4alpha genes using PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism and/or direct sequencing. In families carrying GCK mutations, the influence of genetic defects on fetal growth was investigated by comparing the birth weights of 32 offspring discordant for the mutations. Mutations in MODY genes were identified in 64% of the families. GCK/MODY2 mutations were the most frequently found, in 41%: seven novel (R369P, S411F, M298K, C252Y, Y108C, A188E, and S383L) and 2 already described mutations. Four pedigrees (18%) harbored mutations in the HNF-1alpha/MODY3 gene, including a previously unreported change (R271G). One family (4%) carried a novel mutation in the HNF-4alpha gene (IVS5-2delA), representing the first report of a MODY1 pedigree in the Spanish population. The age at diagnosis was prepubertal in MODY2 index patients and pubertal in MODY3 patients. Overt diabetes was rare in MODY2 and was invariably present in MODY3 index patients. Chronic complications of diabetes were absent in the MODY2 population and were present in more than 40% of all relatives of MODY3. Birth weight was lower in the presence of a GCK fetal mutation when the mutation was of paternal origin. The MODY1 patient was diagnosed at 15 yr of age. She developed intermittent microalbuminuria despite good metabolic control, and severe late-onset complications were common within her family. Mutations in the GCK/MODY2 gene are the most common cause of MODY in our population as recruited from pediatric and adolescent index patients. The inheritance of GCK defects by the fetus results in a reduction of birth weight. Clinical expression of MODY3 and MODY1 mutations, the second and third groups of defects found, was more severe, including the frequent development of chronic complications.
We have used differential display PCR to study altered gene expression in immortalized chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) that have been established in our laboratory. This technique resulted in the cloning of a novel counterpart of the previously cloned chicken dimerization cofactor of hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1 (cDcoH), which was identified as cDcoHalpha. The steady-state mRNA levels of cDcoHalpha were up-regulated in all immortal CEFs tested compared with primary CEF cells. cDcoH and cDcoHalpha showed opposite patterns of mRNA expression due to differential regulation of transcription rates, but not mRNA half-lives, in primary and immortal CEFs. Expression of cDcoHalpha increased in the late G1 and early S phases of the cell cycle, while cDcoH mRNA increased in the late S and G2/M phases. In contrast with consistent expression of both genes in primary quiescent cells, cDcoH mRNA, but not cDcoHalpha mRNA, was dramatically decreased in primary senescent cells. The highest levels of cDcoHalpha mRNA were found in the kidney, liver, heart and ovarian follicles, while the major tissues expressing cDcoH were hypothalamus, kidney and liver. cDcoH and cDcoHalpha probes did not cross-hybridize to human hepatocyte mRNA. When transfected into human HepG2 cells, both cDcoH and cDcoHalpha showed similar functional activity as measured by increased expression of a reporter gene, as well as alpha-fetoprotein and albumin genes that both contain HNF-1 binding elements in their promoters. Our results suggest that the novel chicken DcoHalpha might function as a transcriptional cofactor for HNF-1 in specific cellular-environmental states.
To determine the role of the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha and HNF-4alpha genes in the etiology of late-onset type 2 diabetes in Finnish and Chinese subjects.
The whole coding regions of the genes encoding for HNF-1alpha and HNF-4alpha, including approximately 800 bp of the HNF-1alpha promoter, were investigated in 40 Finnish subjects (fasting C-peptide 50-570 pmol/l) and 47 Chinese subjects with type 2 diabetes by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Frequencies of the variants of these genes were analyzed by restriction fragment-length polymorphism analysis in additional samples of 100 Finnish diabetic patients and 82 Finnish control subjects and in 58 Chinese diabetic patients and 51 Chinese control subjects.
No previously reported gene defects were detected, but one novel functionally silent GCC--&gt;GCG variant (nucleotide 73, exon 10) was observed in the HNF-4alpha gene in a Chinese diabetic patient. Interestingly, the Ala98Val substitution of the HNF-1alpha gene occurred at a significantly higher frequency in 140 Finnish diabetic patients compared with 82 control subjects (P = 0.014). The Ala98Val variant was not, however, associated with abnormalities in insulin secretion evaluated by oral and intravenous glucose tolerance tests in subjects with normal (n = 295) or impaired (n = 38) glucose tolerance.
Variants in the HNF-1alpha and HNF-4alpha genes are unlikely to play a major role in the pathogenesis of late-onset type 2 diabetes in Finnish and Chinese subjects. However, the association of the Ala98Val variant of the HNF-1alpha gene with type 2 diabetes in Finnish subjects may indicate a diabetogenic locus close to the HNF-1alpha gene.
The sex identity of fish can be easily manipulated by exogenous hormones. Treatment with 17-methyltestosterone (MT) has been widely used to induce a male fate, but the molecular and cellular processes underlying sex changes induced by MT treatments and the withdrawal of MT are not well studied. In this study, we systematically investigated gonadal histology, gene expression profiles, sex steroid hormone levels, and cellular changes during sex changes induced by MT-feeding and MT-feeding withdrawal in the protogynous orange-spotted grouper, Epinephelus coioides. Based on gonadal histology, we demonstrated that MT-feeding-induced sex reversal can be divided into early and late phases: in the early phase, male and female germ cells coexist, and MT-feeding withdrawal leads to a female fate; in the late phase, only male germ cells are observed, and MT-feeding withdrawal does not reverse the process, leading to a male fate. In both the early and late phases, cytochrome P450 family19 subfamily A member 1 (cyp19a1a) gene expression increased in response to MT-feeding withdrawal. Finally, by tracing doublesex- and Mab-3-related transcription factor 1 (dmrt1)-expressing cells, we found that gonia-like cells in the germinal epithelium might be the major germ cell sources for developing testes during sex reversal. Collectively, our findings provide insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying sex changes induced by exogenous hormones.
Lung alveolar type II cells uniquely synthesize surfactant, a developmentally regulated lipoprotein that is essential for breathing. Expression of the gene (SFTPA) encoding the major surfactant protein, SP-A, in midgestation human fetal lung (HFL) is dramatically induced by cyclic AMP (cAMP). cAMP induction of SP-A expression is repressed by transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and by hypoxia. In this study, we found that expression of the microRNA 29 (miR-29) family was significantly upregulated in epithelial cells isolated from mouse fetal lung during late gestation and in epithelial cells isolated from HFL explants during type II cell differentiation in culture. miR-29 expression in cultured HFL epithelial cells was increased by cAMP and inhibited by hypoxia, whereas the miR-29 target, TGF-β2, was coordinately decreased. Knockdown of the miR-29 family in cultured HFL type II cells blocked cAMP-induced SP-A expression and accumulation of surfactant-containing lamellar bodies, suggesting their physiological relevance. This occurred through derepression of TGF-β signaling. Notably, cAMP increased binding of endogenous thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1/Nkx2.1) to the miR-29ab1 promoter in HFL type II cells, and TTF-1 increased miR-29ab1 promoter-driven luciferase activity in cotransfection assays. Together, these findings identify miR-29 family members as TTF-1-driven mediators of SP-A expression and type II cell differentiation through repression of TGF-β signaling.
The brainstem contains diverse neuronal populations that regulate a wide range of processes vital to the organism. Proper cell-fate specification decisions are critical to achieve neuronal diversity in the CNS, but the mechanisms regulating cell-fate specification in the developing brainstem are poorly understood. Previously, it has been shown that basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Ptf1a is required for the differentiation and survival of neurons of the inferior olivary and cochlear brainstem nuclei, which contribute to motor coordination and sound processing, respectively. In this study, we show that the loss of Ptf1a compromises the development of the nucleus of the solitary tract, which processes viscerosensory information, and the spinal and principal trigeminal nuclei, which integrate somatosensory information of the face. Combining genetic fate-mapping, birth-dating, and gene expression studies, we found that at least a subset of brainstem abnormalities in Ptf1a(-/-) mice are mediated by a dramatic cell-fate misspecification in rhombomeres 2-7, which results in the production of supernumerary viscerosensory and somatosensory neurons of the Lmx1b lineage at the expense of Pax2(+) GABAergic viscerosensory and somatosensory neurons, and inferior olivary neurons. Our data identify Ptf1a as a major regulator of cell-fate specification decisions in the developing brainstem, and as a previously unrecognized developmental regulator of both viscerosensory and somatosensory brainstem nuclei.
Cell-fate specification decisions are critical for normal CNS development. Although extensively studied in the cerebellum and spinal cord, the mechanisms mediating cell-fate decisions in the brainstem, which regulates a wide range of processes vital to the organism, remain largely unknown. Here we identified mouse Ptf1a as a novel regulator of cell-fate decisions during both early and late brainstem neurogenesis, which are critical for proper development of several major classes of brainstem cells, including neurons of the somatosensory and viscerosensory nuclei. Since loss-of-function PTF1A mutations were described in human patients, we suggest Ptf1a-dependent cell-fate misspecification as a novel mechanism of human brainstem pathology.
The herpes simplex virus 1 virion protein 16 (VP16) tegument protein forms a transactivation complex with the cellular proteins host cell factor 1 (HCF-1) and octamer-binding transcription factor 1 (Oct-1) upon entry into the host cell. VP16 has also been shown to interact with a number of virion tegument proteins and viral glycoprotein H to promote viral assembly, but no comprehensive study of the VP16 proteome has been performed at early times postinfection. We therefore performed a proteomic analysis of VP16-interacting proteins at 3 h postinfection. We confirmed the interaction of VP16 with HCF-1 and a large number of cellular Mediator complex proteins, but most surprisingly, we found that the major viral protein associating with VP16 is the infected cell protein 4 (ICP4) immediate-early (IE) transactivator protein. These results raise the potential for a new function for VP16 in associating with the IE ICP4 and playing a role in transactivation of early and late gene expression, in addition to its well-documented function in transactivation of IE gene expression. 
Nucleolar assembly begins at the early G1 phase of the cell cycle and is a hub of ribosomal DNA transcription and rRNA biosynthesis. The newly-formed rRNAs together with ribosomal proteins (RPs) constitute the building block of the ribosomal machinery. Although RPs play a major role in protein biosynthesis, their own regulation and expression is rather poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the regulation of RP genes RPS27a, RPS24, RPS6, RPL9 and RPL4 in synchronized mammalian cell culture. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated their expression during the mid to late G1 phase, whereas the rRNA genes were expressed during the early G1 phase of the cell cycle. The promoter reporter analysis of the RPS27a gene revealed that it could be synergistically stimulated by the transcription factors specificity protein 1 (Sp1) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). However, E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) appeared to negatively regulate gene expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies confirmed the promoter occupancy of Sp1, CREB and E2F1. Although Sp1 and CREB binding enhanced the promoter occupancy of histone acetyltransferases PCAF, p300 and CREB binding protein, E2F1 facilitated the recruitment of histone deacetylases. Both acetylation (histone H4 pan-acetyl, histone H3 acetyl Lys 14) and methylation (histone H3 trimethyl Lys 9) marks were observed in the RPS27a promoter region, suggesting their important regulatory role in gene expression. Because the promoter regions of most RP genes are well conserved, we propose that their orchestrated regulation and synthesis during the cell cycle facilitates ribosome biogenesis. 
In sporadic breast cancers, BRCA-1 expression is down-regulated in the absence of mutations in the BRCA-1 gene. This suggests that disruption of BRCA-1 expression may contribute to the onset of mammary tumors. Environmental contaminants found in industrial pollution, tobacco smoke, and cooked foods include benzo(a)pyrene [B(a)P] and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), which have been shown to act as endocrine disruptors and tumor promoters. In previous studies, we documented that estrogen (E2) induced BRCA-1 transcription through the recruitment of an activator protein-1/estrogen receptor-alpha (ER alpha) complex to the proximal BRCA-1 promoter. Here, we report that activation of BRCA-1 transcription by E2 requires occupancy of the BRCA-1 promoter by the unliganded aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). The stimulatory effects of E2 on BRCA-1 transcription are counteracted by (a) cotreatment with the AhR antagonist 3'-methoxy-4'-nitroflavone; (b) transient expression in ER alpha-negative HeLa cells of ER alpha lacking the protein-binding domain for the AhR; and (c) mutation of two consensus xenobiotic-responsive elements (XRE, 5'-GCGTG-3') located upstream of the ER alpha-binding region. These results suggest that the physical interaction between the unliganded AhR and the liganded ER alpha plays a positive role in E2-dependent activation of BRCA-1 transcription. Conversely, we show that the AhR ligands B(a)P and TCDD abrogate E2-induced BRCA-1 promoter activity. The repressive effects of TCDD are paralleled by increased recruitment of the liganded AhR and HDAC1, reduced occupancy by p300, SRC-1, and diminished acetylation of H4 at the BRCA-1 promoter region flanking the XREs. We propose that the ligand status of the AhR modulates activation of the BRCA-1 promoter by estrogen.
We have previously shown that polymorphisms in the promoter of the human platelet-derived growth factor alpha-receptor (PDGFRA) gene can be grouped into five distinct haplotypes, designated H1, H 2 alpha, H 2 beta, H 2 gamma and H 2 delta, and that specific combinations of these promoter haplotypes predispose to neural tube defects (NTDs). These promoter haplotypes differ strongly in their ability to drive reporter gene expression in various human cell lines, with highest activity for H 2 alpha and H 2 beta. Here, we show that the haplotype-linked PDGFRA promoter region extends to 3.6 kb upstream from the transcription start site, and contains a total of ten polymorphic sites. For two of these polymorphic sites, i.e. -909 C/A and +68 GAins/del, we observed differential binding of nuclear proteins from human osteosarcoma (HOS) cells. The protein complex binding specifically to -909 C, which is present in all haplotypes except the low activity haplotype H 2 gamma, contained members of the upstream stimulatory factor (USF) family of transcription factors. Furthermore, we identified a protein complex of 125 kDa which bound specifically to the low activity haplotype H1 at position +68 GAdel and may represent an H1-specific PDGFRA transcriptional repressor. The current identification of cis-acting elements in the PDGFRA promoter and the transcription factors that bind them, provides a new strategy for the identification of genes that are potentially involved in neural tube defects.
The apolipoprotein AV gene (APOA5) is a key determinant of plasma triglyceride levels, a major risk factor for coronary artery disease and a biomarker for the metabolic syndrome. Since thyroid hormones influence very low density lipoprotein triglyceride metabolism and clinical studies have demonstrated an inverse correlation between thyroid status and plasma triglyceride levels, we examined whether APOA5 is regulated by thyroid hormone. Here we report that 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) and a synthetic thyroid receptor beta (TRbeta) ligand increase APOA5 mRNA and protein levels in hepatocytes. Our data revealed that T3-activated TR directly regulates APOA5 promoter through a functional direct repeat separated by four nucleotides (DR4). Interestingly, we show that upstream stimulatory factor 1, a transcription factor associated with familial combined hyperlipidemia and elevated triglyceride levels in humans, and upstream stimulatory factor 2 cooperate with TR, resulting in a synergistic activation of APOA5 promoter in a ligand-dependent manner via an adjacent E-box motif. In rats, we observed that apoAV levels declines with thyroid hormone depletion but returned to normal levels upon T3 administration. In addition, treatments with a TRbeta-selective agonist increased apoAV and diminished triglyceride levels. The identification of APOA5 as a T3 target gene provides a new potential mechanism whereby thyroid hormones can influence triglyceride homeostasis. Additionally, these data suggest that TRbeta may be a potential pharmacological target for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia.
Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) ligand (RANKL), a critical activator of osteoclast differentiation, plays a pivotal role in tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) gene expression. Previously, we showed that upstream stimulatory factors (USF) 1 and 2 are implicated in the RANKL-induced TRAP transcriptional activation via a 12-bp USF binding site in the TRAP promoter. In that study, we also demonstrated that a RANKL-induced nuclear protein binds to a 50-bp oligonucleotide (Oligo IV) corresponding to a distinct TRAP promoter region. Here we report the identification and functional characterization of the nuclear protein binding to Oligo IV. We identified a 21-bp sequence CTGTTTATGATGGCGAGGGGG in Oligo IV that specifically binds the RANKL-induced nuclear protein from RAW264.7 cells by performing a series of competition assays. Computer analysis of the 21-bp sequence revealed that the sequence contains a putative Yin Yang 1 (YY1) binding site overlapped with a putative activator protein-2 (AP-2) binding site. Competition and supershift assays indicated that the nuclear protein binding to the 21-bp sequence is YY1, not AP-2. Functionally, mutation of the YY1-binding site resulted in a reduction in the RANKL-induced TRAP transcription in RAW264.7 cells, demonstrating that YY1 positively regulates RANKL-induced TRAP transcriptional activation. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that YY1 plays a functional role in RANKL-mediated TRAP gene expression during osteoclast differentiation.
CYP1B1 activates polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon carcinogens in cAMP-regulated tissues such as the adrenal, ovary, and testis. A 27-fold cAMP stimulation of the CYP1B1-luciferase reporter in Y-1 adrenal cells depends entirely on a far upstream enhancer region (FUER; -5298 to -5110). Cooperative participation of multiple steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) elements with the downstream cAMP response element (CRE) in FUER is essential for both basal and cAMP-stimulated activities of FUER. Basal and induced activities were similarly lowered by DAX-1, an SF-1 suppressor, and raised by steroid receptor coactivator 1, an SF-1 coactivator. cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) that interacts preferentially with the phosphorylated-CREB increased the cAMP-induced FUER. 10T1/2 cells and human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells do not express SF-1. Introduction of exogenous SF-1 generated cAMP stimulation of the FUER in 10T1/2 fibroblasts. The same transfection only increased basal activity of FUER in HEK293 cells, despite presence of active CREB in cells. HEK293 cells therefore remain deficient in additional factor(s) critical to the cAMP stimulation of CYP1B1. Mutations of the protein kinase A (PKA) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation sites (Ser-430 and Ser-203) on SF-1 had no effect on the SF-1-dependent FUER stimulation in Y-1 and 10T1/2 cells. This contrasts with loss of activity with mutation of CREB at PKA phosphorylation site (Ser-133). SF-1 phosphorylation at these sites is therefore not essential for the cAMP stimulation and the cooperation with CREB. cAMP-enhanced activation protein 1 (AP-1) and stimulatory protein 1 (Sp1) complexes in the proximal promoter region contributed substantially to both basal and cAMP-stimulated FUER activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation from primary rat adrenal cells demonstrated cAMP stimulation of histone acetylation proximal to, respectively, the FUER and AP-1 sites of CYP1B1.
The exact molecular mechanisms regulating estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) expression in breast tumors are unclear, but studies suggest that they are partly at the level of transcription. We have focused on the transcription factors that regulate the ERalpha minimal promoter, which we have previously shown to reside within the first 245 bp of the 5'-flanking region of the gene. Within this region are several elements essential for full ERalpha promoter transcriptional activity, including a GC box and an imperfect E box. In earlier studies we demonstrated an essential function for the Sp1 family of transcription factors in the regulation of ERalpha expression. We have now identified both USF-1 and ERalpha itself as components of a multi-protein complex of transcription factors that interacts at the ERalpha minimal promoter and is essential for its full transcriptional activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that Sp1 and USF-1, but not ERalpha, bind directly to the ERalpha minimal promoter. We showed by GST pull-down assays that ERalpha is able to interact in vitro with USF-1, suggesting, in addition to a possible interaction between ERalpha and Sp1, a mechanism whereby ERalpha is able to interact with the protein complex. Combined exogenous expression of the components of the complex in MCF-7 breast cancer cells resulted in a synergistic effect on transactivation of the ERalpha minimal promoter, suggesting that the importance of the protein complex is in the interactions among the components. Based upon these findings, we propose a possible model for transcription from the ERalpha minimal promoter.
Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) plays an important role in bone resorption. TRAP expression in osteoclasts is regulated by receptor activator of NF-kappaB (RANKL), a potent activator of osteoclast differentiation. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the RANKL-induced TRAP expression remains unknown. Here we show that two regions in the mouse TRAP promoter (one at -1858 to -1239 and the other at -1239 to -1039, relative to the translation start site) are implicated in RANKL-induced TRAP transcription in RAW264.7 cells. A detailed characterization of the region at -1239 to -1039 identifies a 12-bp sequence, AGCCACGTGGTG, that specifically binds nuclear proteins from RAW264.7 cells and primary bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Moreover, the binding is significantly enhanced in EMSA with nuclear extracts from RANKL-treated RAW264.7 cells and BMMs, suggesting that the 12-bp sequence may be involved in RANKL-induced TRAP transcription. Various assays reveal that nuclear proteins binding to the 12-bp sequence are upstream stimulatory factors (USF) 1 and 2. Importantly, mutation of the USF-binding site partially blocks RANKL-induced TRAP transcription in RAW264.7 cells, confirming that USF1 and USF2 are functionally involved in RANKL-induced TRAP transcription. In summary, our data show that USF1 and USF2 play a functional role in RANKL-dependent TRAP expression during osteoclast differentiation.
Our laboratory has been studying the transcriptional regulation of the nuclear gene (ATPA) that encodes the alpha-subunit of the mammalian mitochondrial F1F0 ATP synthase complex. We have previously determined that the regulatory factor, upstream stimulatory factor 2 (USF2), can stimulate transcription of the ATPA gene through the cis-acting regulatory element 1 in the upstream promoter of this gene. In this study, we used the yeast one-hybrid screening method to identify another factor, COUP-TFII/ARP-1, which also binds to the ATPA cis-acting regulatory element 1. Binding of the orphan nuclear receptor, COUP-TFII/ARP-1, to the ATPA regulatory element 1 was confirmed using electrophoretic mobility shift experiments, and COUP-TFII/ARP-1-containing complexes were detected in HeLa cell nuclear extracts. A mutational analysis indicated that the binding site for COUP-TFII/ARP-1 in the ATPA regulatory element 1 is an imperfect direct repeat of a nuclear receptor response element (A/GGGTCA) with a spacer of three nucleotides. Functional assays in HeLa cells showed that COUP-TFII/ARP-1 represses the ATPA promoter activity in a dose- and sequence-dependent manner. Furthermore, cotransfection assays demonstrated that COUP-TFII/ARP-1 inhibits the USF2-mediated activation of the wild-type ATPA gene promoter but not a mutant promoter that is defective in COUP-TFII/ARP-1-binding. Overexpression of USF2 reversed the COUP-TFII/ARP-1-mediated repression of the ATPA promoter. Mobility shift assays revealed that COUP-TFII/ARP-1 and USF2 compete for binding to the ATPA regulatory element 1. Thus, the ATPA gene is regulated by a multifunctional binding site through which the transcription factors, COUP-TFII/ARP-1 and USF2, bind and exert their antagonistic effects.
Transcriptional regulation of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1beta (CPT-1beta) is coordinated with contractile gene expression through cardiac-enriched transcription factors, GATA4 and SRF. Metabolic modulation of CPT-1beta promoter activity has been described with the stimulation of gene expression by oleate that is mediated through the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) pathway. The coactivator, peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator (PGC-1), enhances gene expression through interactions with nuclear hormone receptors and the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) family. PGC-1 and MEF2A synergistically activate CPT-1beta promoter activity. This stimulation is enhanced by mutation of the E-box sequences that flank the MEF2A binding site. These elements bind the upstream stimulatory factors (USF1 and USF2), which activate transcription in CV-1 fibroblasts. However, overexpression of the USF proteins in myocytes depresses CPT-1beta activity and significantly reduces MEF2A and PGC-1 synergy. Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate that PGC-1 and USF2 proteins can physically interact. Our studies demonstrate that PGC-1 stimulates CPT-1beta gene expression through MEF2A. USF proteins have a novel role in repressing the expression of the CPT-1beta gene and modulating the induction by the coactivator, PGC-1.
Carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I (CPT-I) catalyzes the rate-controlling step of fatty acid oxidation. CPT-I converts long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs to acylcarnitines for translocation across the mitochondrial membrane. The mRNA levels and enzyme activity of the liver isoform, CPT-Ialpha, are greatly increased in the liver of hyperthyroid animals. Thyroid hormone (T3) stimulates CPT-Ialpha transcription far more robustly in the liver than in non-hepatic tissues. We have shown that the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) binds to a thyroid hormone response element (TRE) located in the CPT-Ialpha promoter. In addition, elements in the first intron participate in the T3 induction of CPT-Ialpha gene expression, but the CPT-Ialpha intron alone cannot confer a T3 response. We found that deletion of sequences in the first intron between +653 and +744 decreased the T3 induction of CPT-Ialpha. Upstream stimulatory factor (USF) and CCAAT enhancer binding proteins (C/EBPs) bind to elements within this region, and these factors are required for the T3 response. The binding of TR and C/EBP to the CPT-Ialpha gene in vivo was shown by the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. We determined that TR can physically interact with USF-1, USF-2, and C/EBPalpha. Transgenic mice were created that carry CPT-Ialpha-luciferase transgenes with or without the first intron of the CPT-Ialpha gene. In these mouse lines, the first intron is required for T3 induction as well as high levels of hepatic expression. Our data indicate that the T3 stimulates CPT-Ialpha gene expression in the liver through a T3 response unit consisting of the TRE in the promoter and additional factors, C/EBP and USF, bound in the first intron.
SHP-1, a protein-tyrosine phosphatase with two src-homology 2 domains, is expressed predominantly in hematopoietic and epithelial cells and has been implicated in numerous signaling pathways as a negative regulator. Two promoters direct the expression of human and murine SHP-1, and two types of transcripts (I) and (II) SHP-1, are initiated from each of these promoters. The cDNA sequences of (I)SHP-1 and (II)SHP-1 are identical except in the 5' untranslated region and in the first few coding nucleotides. In this report, we show that promoter usage is similar in mouse and human hematopoietic cells, but different in epithelial cells. In human epithelial cells, only (I)SHP-1 transcripts were expressed. In addition, 4beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate up-regulates human (I)SHP-1 transcript expression in SKOV3 cells (an ovarian cancer cell line). Indirect evidence suggests that nuclear factor-kappaB might play a role in this induction. We also show that a 12-bp repeat in the distal SHP-1 promoter, which directs (I)SHP-1 expression, is of functional relevance as deletion of one copy of this E-box-containing 12-bp repeat resulted in a significant decrease in promoter activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and supershift experiments showed that the upstream stimulatory factors USF1 and USF2 hetero-dimerize and interact with this 12 bp repeat. Our results suggest that USFs which have antiproliferative functions might regulate the expression of SHP-1, which itself is predominantly a negative growth regulator.
The FSH receptor (FSHR) is selectively expressed in the granulosa and Sertoli cells in a development-dependent manner. Little is known regarding how the regulatory factors balance expression of this gene in ovarian cycles or spermatogenic stages. We have used the ovine FSHR promoter as a model system and identified a third regulatory element (RE-3) located at -197 to -171 of the strongest promoter. Gel mobility shift and antibody supershift assays demonstrated that nuclear factors c-Fos/c-Jun, steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), upstream stimulatory factor-1/2 (USF-1/2), and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor-1/2 (COUP-TFI/II) potentially bound to RE-3. We have also extended our previous observations by showing that a sequence containing an E-box was not only bound by USF proteins but also recognized by COUP-TF orphan receptors. Functional studies demonstrated that USF-1/2, c-Fos/c-Jun, and SF-1 were activators, whereas COUP-TFs were repressors. Our studies indicated that RE-3 mediated SF-1 activation as well as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation, whereas COUP-TFs inhibited AP-1, USFs, and SF-1 activation. We also demonstrated that both COUP-TF-binding sites in the core promoter were required for the bipartite elements to oppose their competitor binding. These data suggest a mechanism by which positive and negative regulators compete for the common regulatory elements, providing antagonistic pathways that might govern the expression of FSHR in gonadal cells.
The bile salt-stimulated carboxyl ester lipase (CEL) is important for the digestion and absorption of dietary lipids, and is expressed at high levels by the exocrine pancreas and the lactating mammary gland. However, the presence of CEL in human plasma suggests that the role of CEL in lipid metabolism may stretch beyond its function in the intestinal lumen, and possibly include interactions with cholesterol and oxidized lipoproteins to modulate the progression of atherosclerosis. We have used the CEL-expressing human monocytic cell line THP-1 to investigate the transcriptional regulation of the human CEL in monocytes. Analyses of the promoter region revealed that an E-box located at -47/-52 is necessary for CEL expression. Point mutations in the E-box almost completely abolish the transcriptional activity. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assay analyses reveal that the E-box binds the upstream stimulatory factors 1 and 2, and the binding of an upstream stimulatory factor-containing complex in THP-1 cells also requires the presence of a putative nuclear receptor-binding site at -60/-66. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the E-box is also necessary for CEL expression in the pancreas and the mammary gland, although there are tissue-specific requirements for additional activating elements.
CYP3A2 and CYP3A23 are two cytochrome P450 genes in rat that are differentially regulated in both their constitutive activities and their responsiveness to glucocorticoids, the prototypic CYP3A inducers. CYP3A2 displays 20-25% of the response to glucocorticoids as CYP3A23 despite extensive sequence homology in their 5'-regulatory regions. Promoter deletion analyses revealed that the CYP3A2 -57 to -168 region, homologous to the CYP3A23 dexamethasone-responsive region, mediated its low level activation. When this region was analyzed by DNase I footprinting, three binding sites were shown to correspond to the functional elements described for CYP3A23: DexRE-1, DexRE-2, and Site A (J. M. Huss and C. B. Kasper (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273: 16155-16162). The CYP3A2 DexRE-2 and Site A elements bear two mismatches each from the CYP3A23 elements but displayed similar binding patterns in footprinting and gel-shift analyses as their CYP3A23 counterparts. The region containing 3A2DexRE-1 has six mismatches and displayed unique footprinting and gel-shift patterns compared to 3A23DexRE-1. Functional assays revealed that four mismatches within the DexRE-1 and DexRE-2 elements accounted for the differential inducibility of the two isoforms. We propose that the reduced responsiveness of CYP3A2 is the result of preferential binding of COUP-TF at the CYP3A2 DexRE-1 site. In contrast, CYP3A23 DexRE-1 associates with an accessory factor(s) that acts in concert with downstream sites to mediate the strong glucocorticoid induction response observed for CYP3A23. Site A mismatches did not influence induction magnitude but were responsible for basal activity differences. Higher CYP3A23 basal activity appears to be due to an E-box in 3A23SiteA that interacts with USF1, a ubiquitous bHLH/leucine zipper transcription factor. This site is disrupted in the corresponding 3A2SiteA. Hence, 4 nucleotide mismatches within two elements account for the difference in glucocorticoid induction, and a single mismatch is responsible for the fivefold difference in the basal activities of CYP3A2 and CYP3A23.
Coactivators previously implicated in ligand-dependent activation functions by thyroid hormone receptor (TR) include p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP), the steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1)-related family of proteins, and the multicomponent TR-associated protein (TRAP) complex. Here we show that two positive cofactors (PC2 and PC4) derived from the upstream stimulatory activity (USA) cofactor fraction act synergistically to mediate thyroid hormone (T3)-dependent activation either by TR or by a TR-TRAP complex in an in vitro system reconstituted with purified factors and DNA templates. Significantly, the TRAP-mediated enhancement of activation by TR does not require the TATA box-binding protein-associated factors of TFIID. Furthermore, neither the pleiotropic coactivators CBP and p300 nor members of the SRC-1 family were detected in either the TR-TRAP complex or the other components of the in vitro assay system. These results show that activation by TR at the level of naked DNA templates is enhanced by cooperative functions of the TRAP coactivators and the general coactivators PC2 and PC4, and they further indicate a potential functional redundancy between TRAPs and TATA box-binding protein-associated factors in TFIID. In conjunction with earlier studies on other nuclear receptor-interacting cofactors, the present study also suggests a multistep pathway, involving distinct sets of cofactors, for activation of hormone responsive genes.
Overexpression of cathepsin D (CD), a ubiquitous lysosomal protease, is closely associated with a poor clinical outcome for patients with breast cancer. Estrogen greatly induces transcription of the CD gene in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cells. In this report, we transiently introduced a human CD promoter/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene into human MCF-7 breast cancer cells to study the mechanisms by which the ER activates the promoter. Using an in vivo Exonuclease III footprinting assay, we found that estrogen stimulation of MCF-7 cells induced loading of a transcription factor(s) to a portion of the promoter (-124 to -104) that is homologous to the adenovirus major late promoter element. Subsequent gel mobility shift assays with a 21-bp CD -124/-104 probe and nuclear extracts prepared from naive and estrogen-stimulated cells detected a single sequence-specific protein-DNA complex. Southwestern and UV cross-linking experiments detected two proteins of 44 kDa and 43 kDa that were specifically bound to the 21-bp fragment of the promoter. Gel super-shift assays with upstream stimulatory factor 1 (USF-1) and USF-2 antibodies demonstrated that USF-1 and USF-2 bound to the E box probe. Sequence specific binding was abolished by a 2-bp change shown previously to prevent the binding of USF to the E box. Incorporation of a mutant E box into the wild-type CD promoter/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene abolished USF binding and reduced the levels of both basal and estrogen-stimulated transcription. These results suggest that the ER targeting of USF-1 and USF-2 is a critical step in hormone activation of CD gene transcription in human breast cancer cells.
In this study, an endogenous factor(s) involved in the suppression of the induction of CYP1A1 was studied. Analyzing the sequences, we found that the sequence of xenobiotic responsive element (XRE) in the upstream region of the human CYP1A1 gene was overlapped with that of the upstream stimulatory factor 1 (USF1)-binding site in mouse metallothionein I promoter. In fact, a gel shift assay using a specific competitor or mutant probes showed that the core sequence of human XRE was specifically recognized by USF1. The amount of USF1 in the nuclear extracts from HepG2 cells was smaller than that from rat and rabbit livers as assayed by the binding to XRE. To determine whether or not USF1 could inhibit the interaction of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)/AhR nuclear translocator (Arnt) complex with XRE, we transfected USF1-SR alpha expression vector into HepG2 cells. The results showed that no interaction of AhR/Arnt complex with XRE occurred even when the cells were treated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran (TCDF). Furthermore, the S1 nuclease protection assay showed that the induction of CYP1A1 mRNA by 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) was depressed by the transfection of USF1-SR alpha into HepG2 cells. Thus, it is highly possible that USF1 negatively regulates the induction of CYP1A1 in humans.
Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) induce a variety of biological effects on different cell types. They activate a number of genes, including immediate-early genes, such as the transcription factors Fos and Jun, which are also common targets for other tyrosine kinase receptor-activating growth factors. Here we describe a secondary far-upstream enhancer on the syndecan-1 gene that is activated only by members of the FGF family in NIH 3T3 cells, not by other receptor tyrosine kinase-activating growth factors (e.g., epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, or serum). This FGF-inducible response element (FiRE) consists of a 170-bp array of five DNA motifs which bind two FGF-inducible Fos-Jun heterodimers, one inducible AP-2-related protein, a constitutively expressed upstream stimulatory factor, and one constitutive 46-kDa transcription factor. Mutational analysis showed that both AP-1 binding motifs are required, but not sufficient, for FiRE activation. Moreover, agents such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, okadaic acid, or forskolin, which are known to activate AP-1 complexes and AP-1-driven promoters, fail to activate FiRE. However, FiRE can be activated by the tyrosine kinase phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate. Taken together, this data implies a differential activation of growth factor-initiated signaling on AP-1-driven regulatory elements.
Regulation of human thyrotropin beta subunit gene (TSHB) expression by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) was examined in a clonal rat pituitary-cell line (GH3). Transient expression studies were done with various 5'-flanking DNA sequences of TSHB coupled to reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. Deletion analysis defined two discrete regions (-128 to -92 base pairs and -28 to +8 base pairs) that each mediated an approximately 2-fold TRH induction. The upstream site contains a DNA sequence with close homology to the DNA-binding site for a pituitary-specific transcriptional factor Pit-1/GHF-1. DNase I footprinting analysis of mouse thyrotropic tumor extract as well as DNA-transfection studies using an expression vector containing an N-terminal deletion of Pit-1/GHF-1 cDNA suggest that Pit-1/GHF-1 or a closely related protein in the thyrotroph mediates TRH responsiveness of this gene. In addition, the downstream site overlaps with the recently characterized thyroid hormone-inhibitory element of TSHB. In fact, deletion of DNA sequences important in thyroid hormone-receptor binding (c-erbAB/c-ERBA2) from +3 to +8 base pairs, significantly reduced (30%) TRH responsiveness. The location of a TRH-stimulatory element near a thyroid hormone-inhibitory element may allow for fine control of TSHB expression in vivo.
The murine homeobox-containing gene Hox-2.3 contains a basal promoter in a 210-bp region upstream of the transcription start site. In vitro studies of DNA-protein interactions in this region, and in a 1.3-kb upstream region which is known to play a role in tissue specific expression in vivo, led to the identification of DNA elements interacting with nuclear proteins from embryocarcinoma cells. Among the factors binding to the basal promoter is the upstream stimulating factor (USF), also known as major late transcription factor (MLTF). A single point mutation in its binding site abolishes binding in vitro and leads to 50% reduction of the transcriptional activity as measured in receptor gene experiments, showing that it is an activator of Hox-2.3 expression.
Steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) is an essential factor in endocrine proliferation and gene expression. Despite the fact that SF-1 expression is restricted to specialized cells within the endocrine system, the only identified regulatory factors of SF-1 are the ubiquitously expressed E-box proteins (upstream stimulatory factors 1 and 2). Sequence examination of the SF-1 proximal promoter revealed a conserved site of AACAAAG (Sox-BS1), which matches exactly the defined consensus Sox protein binding element. Among the approximately 20 known members of the Sox gene family, we focused on Sox3, Sox8, and Sox9, based on their coexpression with SF-1 in the embryonic testis. Indeed, all three of these Sox proteins were capable of binding the proximal Sox-BS1 within the SF-1 promoter (-110 to -104), albeit with differing affinities. Of the three Sox proteins, Sox9 exhibited high-affinity binding to the Sox-BS1 element and consistently activated SF-1 promoter-reporter constructs. Mutating the Sox-BS1 attenuated SF-1 promoter activity in both embryonic and postnatal Sertoli cells, as well as in the adrenocortical cell line, Y1. Our findings, taken together with the overlapping expression profiles of Sox9 and SF-1, and the similar intersex phenotypes associated with both SOX9 and SF-1 human mutations, suggest that Sox9 up-regulates SF-1 and accounts partially for the sexually dimorphic expression pattern of SF-1 observed during male gonadal differentiation.
Complement receptor 2 (CR2) is regulated at the transcriptional level, but the promoter elements and the transcription factors that bind to them and contribute to its regulation are unknown. After documenting that PMA and cAMP induced the activity of the CR2 promoter by 10-fold, we conducted promoter truncation and mutagenesis experiments, in conjunction with shift assays, to determine the functionally important regions of the promoter and the proteins that bind to them. We identified two regions, separated by approximately 900 nucleotides, which together were responsible for inducible promoter activity. Mutagenesis of single promoter elements demonstrated a functional upstream stimulatory factor/E box in the TATA box-proximal region and three equally important, closely spaced, CREB/AP-1 half-sites in the upstream promoter region. The cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)/AP-1 half-sites bound in vitro Jun and CREB that are induced by protein kinases A and/or C. The 900-nucleotide segment stretching between the above two regions had no functional impact on the induced transcription, and its deletion increased the promoter activity. Finally, a region upstream of the distal site had a repressor activity on CR2 transcription. Moreover, IL-4 induced binding of CREB and AP-1 to the upstream promoter elements and resulted in increased CR2 surface protein expression. These studies have characterized regions of the CR2 promoter and the transcription factors that bind to them and are crucial to induced CR2 expression. Our studies may provide insights to novel approaches to modulate B cell function by regulating CR2 gene transcription.
The receptor for the pituitary glycoprotein hormone FSH (FSHR) and the nuclear hormone receptor steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) play important roles in control of the hypothalamic-pituitary- gonadal axis. FSHR is essential for integrating the pituitary FSH signal to gonadal response, while SF-1 is an important transcriptional regulator of many genes that function within this axis and is essential for the development of gonads and adrenal glands. Given the critical role of SF-1 in regulation of the gonads and the coexpression of FSHR and SF-1 in Sertoli and granulosa cells, we examined the ability of SF-1 to regulate transcription of the FSHR gene. We found that SF-1 stimulated rat FSHR promoter activity in a dose-dependent and promoter-specific manner. Examination of various promoter deletion mutants indicated that SF-1 acts through the proximal promoter region and upstream promoter sequences. An E box element within the proximal promoter is essential for activation of the FSHR promoter by SF-1. This element binds the transcriptional regulators USF1 and USF2 (upstream stimulatory factors 1 and 2) but not SF-1, as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In addition, functional studies identified a requirement for the USF proteins in SF-1 activation of FSHR and mapped an important regulatory domain within exons 4 and 5 of USF2. Cotransfection studies revealed that activation of protein kinase A leads to inhibition of SF-1-stimulated transcription of FSHR, while it synergized with SF-1 to activate the equine LH beta-promoter (ebeta). Thus, stimulation of the cAMP pathway differentially regulates SF-1 activation of the FSHR and ebeta-promoters.
Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a pleotropic polypeptide that can function as a morphogen, motogen, mitogen, angiogen, carcinogen, and tumor suppressor, depending on the target cell and tissue. Previous studies from our laboratory using transgenic mice have shown that HGF gene expression is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level and that the upstream regulatory elements are crucial for the control of HGF gene transcription. In the present study, we have identified and characterized one of these elements as a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma)-responsive element. This regulatory element was localized at -246 to -233 base pairs upstream from the transcription start site of the HGF gene promoter having the sequence GGGCCAGGTGACCT. Gel mobility shift and supershift assays demonstrated that this cis-acting element strongly binds to the PPARgamma isoforms as well as to chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor, a member of the orphan nuclear receptor subfamily. Mutational analysis and gel mobility band shift assays indicated that the binding site is an inverted repeat of the AGGTCA motif with two spacers (inverted repeat 2 configuration) and that the two spacers are important for PPARgamma binding. This binding site overlaps with functional binding sites for activating protein-2, nuclear factor 1, and upstream stimulatory factor, and together, they constitute a multifunctional composite binding site through which these different transcription factors exert their regulatory effects on HGF promoter activity. Functional assays revealed that PPARgamma, with its ligand, 15-deoxy-prostaglandin J2, strongly stimulates HGF promoter activity. On the other hand, nuclear factor 1, activating protein-2, and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor transcription factors repress the stimulatory action of PPARgamma by competing with PPARgamma for their overlapping binding sites. Furthermore, for the first time, our studies demonstrate that the PPARgamma ligand, 15-deoxy-prostaglandin J2, induces endogenous HGF mRNA and protein expression in fibroblasts in culture.
Heme-hemopexin (2-10 microM) is used as a model for intravenous heme released in trauma, stroke, and ischemia-reperfusion. A transient increase in cellular protein oxidation occurs during receptor-mediated heme transport from hemopexin which is inhibited by the nonpermeable Cu(I) chelator, bathocuproinedisulfonate. Thus, participation of surface redox process involving Cu(I) generation are proposed to be linked to the induction of the protective proteins heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and metallothionein-1 (MT-1) by heme-hemopexin. The region (-153 to -42) in the proximal promoter of the mouse MT-1 gene responds to heme- and CoPP-hemopexin in transient transfection assays and contains metal-responsive elements for MTF-1 and an antioxidant-responsive element (ARE) overlapping a GC-rich E-box to which USF-1 and -2 bind. No decreases in DNA binding of the diamide-oxidation sensitive USF-1 and -2 occur upon exposure of cells to heme-hemopexin. MTF-1 and the ARE-binding proteins are relatively resistant to diamide oxidation and are induced approximately eight- and two-fold, respectively, by heme-hemopexin. BCDS prevents the nuclear translocation of MTF-1 by both heme- and CoPP-hemopexin complexes as well as MT-1 mRNA induction by CoPP-hemopexin. Thus, copper is needed for the surface oxidation events and yet the nuclear translocation of MTF-1 in response to hemopexin occurs via copper, probably Cu(I),-dependent signaling cascades from the hemopexin receptor rather than the oxidation per se.
Expression and activation of follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) in the granulosa and Sertoli cells are required for normal development of the ovarian follicles and germ cells. However, little is known regarding the mechanisms by which FSHR expression is regulated. We fused an ovine FSHR promoter to a luciferase gene to understand the promoter regulation in two gonadal cell lines. Deletion studies revealed that the strongest promoter was at -200 to +163 relative to the transcription start site. One of cis-elements protected from DNase I digestion was mapped to between +32 and +54 of the 174-base pair (bp) minimal promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay with a 26-bp probe (+32 to +57) and nuclear extracts from Sertoli (15P1) and granulosa (JC-410) cell lines demonstrated a sequence-specific DNA-protein complex. Southwestern analysis detected a 43-kDa protein bound to the 26-bp probe. Gel supershift with upstream stimulatory factor 1 and 2 (USF-1/2) antibodies revealed that the DNA-protein complex contained these two transcription factors. Mutation within the E-box of the promoter abolished the sequence-specific binding and the minimal promoter activity but also greatly reduced the transcription of the proximal promoters by 49%-70%. These data suggest that the USF-1/2 binding to the promoter is required for the expression of the ovine FSHR in the gonadal cells.
The classic sterol regulatory cis element (sre-1) in the LDL receptor promoter mediates sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-binding and the effects of insulin and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF). To elucidate whether SREBP-1a and SREBP-2 play a direct role in insulin and PDGF action, stable cell lines of HepG2 deficient in either SREBP-1 or SREBP-2 were used. Transfection of these cells with the wild-type promoter fragment of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene showed that the effects of insulin and PDGF were significantly reduced in both, SREBP-1- as well as SREBP-2-deficient cells. Insulin and PDGF action could be reconstituted again in these deficient cell lines by reintroducing SREBP-1a or SREBP-2. Preincubation of cells with either the phosphatidylinositol (PI)-3 kinase inhibitor wortmannin or the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade inhibitor PD 98059 showed that the latter abolished the stimulatory effects of insulin and PDGF on LDL receptor promoter activity completely, whereas wortmannin had no effect. Overexpression of upstream activators of the MAP kinases, like MEKK1 or MEK1, stimulated LDL receptor promoter activity several fold in an sre-1 related manner. These effects could be enhanced by coexpression of the transcriptional active N-terminal domains of SREBP-1a and SREBP-2. Using the heterologous Gal-4 system, we could show that intracellular activation of the MAP kinase cascade by ectopic expression of MEKK1 or MEK1 has a direct stimulatory effect on the transcriptional activity of SREBP-1a and SREBP-2. Experimental evidence for a direct link between MAP kinases and SREBPs was obtained due to the MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylating recombinant GST-fusion proteins of SREBP-1a and SREBP-2, in vitro. We conclude that SREBP-1a and SREBP-2 mediate different regulatory effects converging at sre-1 and that they appear to be linked to the MAP kinase cascade, possibly being direct substrates of ERK1 and ERK2.
FSH acts through the FSH receptor (FSHR) to modulate cell processes that are required to support developing spermatozoa. Within the testis, only Sertoli cells possess receptors for FSH and are the major targets for this regulator of spermatogenesis. FSH stimulation of Sertoli cells for 24-48 h is known to induce Fshr mRNA expression through an E-box motif (CACGTG) located 25 bp upstream of the transcription start site. In contrast, FSH stimulation for 8 h inhibits Fshr transcription. DNA-protein binding studies performed using nuclear extracts from Sertoli cells show that protein binding to the Fshr promoter E-box was reduced 68% after 6 h of FSH stimulation but increased 191% over basal levels after 48 h of stimulation. The proteins binding to the Fshr E-box were identified as upstream stimulatory factor (USF)-1 and -2. FSH stimulation transiently decreased USF1 levels and increased the expression of the inhibitor of DNA binding/differentiation (ID)-2 repressor protein with the same kinetics as the decreased USF/E-box interactions. Overexpression of ID2 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in USF-driven Fshr promoter activity in the MSC-1 Sertoli cell line, and ID2 inhibited USF binding to the Fshr E-box. Together, these studies suggest that stimulation of Sertoli cells with FSH transiently decreases expression of the USF1 activator and induces accumulation of the ID2 repressor, to block USF binding to the Fshr promoter and delay activation of Fshr transcription. This FSH-regulated mechanism may explain the cyclical changes in Fshr expression that occurs in Sertoli cells in vivo.
We have previously shown that metoprolol decreases carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1) activity, a mechanism which may partly explain its beneficial effects in heart failure. It is possible that this effect occurs as a result of repression of cardiac CPT-1B expression. CPT-1B is induced by the transcription factors peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) and PPAR-gamma-coactivator 1alpha (PGC1alpha) and repressed by upstream stimulatory factor-2 (USF-2). We therefore hypothesized that metoprolol represses CPT-1B by increasing USF-2-mediated repression of PGC1alpha. Male Wistar Rats were divided into 4 groups: control, control treated with metoprolol for 5 weeks, diabetic and diabetic treated with metoprolol for 5 weeks. After termination, the expression of CPT-1 isoforms, PPAR-alpha, PGC1alpha USF-1 and USF-2, as well as downstream targets were measured. Binding of PPAR-alpha, PGC1alpha and USF-2 to PGC1alpha was measured using coimmunoprecipitation. The occupation of PPAR-alpha and MEF-2A consensus sites in the CPT-1B promoter was measured using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Chronic metoprolol treatment decreased the expression of CPT-1B in diabetic hearts. The expression of USF-2 was increased by metoprolol in both control and diabetic hearts, but the association of USF-2 with PGC1alpha was increased by metoprolol only in diabetic hearts. Metoprolol prevented the increase in PGC1alpha occupation of the CPT-1B promoter region observed in the diabetic heart without affecting PPAR-alpha occupation. Metoprolol decreases CPT-1B expression by decreasing PGC1alpha-mediated coactivation of PPAR-alpha and MEF-2A. This is associated with increased PGC1alpha/ USF-2 binding, suggesting that USF-2 mediates the metoprolol-induced repression of PGC1alpha.
Selenoprotein P (SeP), the major selenoprotein in plasma, is produced mainly by the liver, although SeP expression is detected in many organs. Recently, we reported stimulation of SeP promoter activity by the forkhead box transcription factor FoxO1a in hepatoma cells and its attenuation by insulin. Here, we demonstrate that this translates into fine-tuning of SeP production and secretion by insulin. Overexpression of peroxisomal proliferator activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha) enhanced the stimulatory effect of FoxO1a on SeP promoter activity. We identified a novel functional binding site for hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4alpha, termed hepatocyte nuclear factor binding element 1, in the human SeP promoter directly upstream of the FoxO-responsive element daf16-binding element 2 (DBE2). Point mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factor binding element 1 alone or together with DBE2 decreased basal activity and responsiveness of the SeP promoter to PGC-1alpha. Moreover, the PGC-1alpha-inducing glucocorticoid dexamethasone strongly enhanced SeP messenger RNA levels and protein secretion in cultured rat hepatocytes, whereas insulin suppressed the stimulation of both PGC-1alpha and SeP caused by dexamethasone treatment. In a brain-derived neuroblastoma cell line with low basal SeP expression, SeP transcription was stimulated by PGC-1alpha together with FoxO1a, and overexpression of HNF-4alpha potentiated this effect.
High-level expression of SeP in liver is ensured by concerted action of the coactivator PGC-1alpha and the transcription factors FoxO1a and HNF-4alpha. Hence, the production of SeP is regulated similarly to that of the gluconeogenic enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase. As hepatic SeP production is crucial for selenium distribution throughout the body, the present study establishes PGC-1alpha as a key regulator of selenium homeostasis.
Expression of the human surfactant protein-A2 (hSP-A2) gene is lung specific, occurs in type II and Clara cells, and is developmentally and hormonally regulated in fetal lung. Using transfected human fetal type II cells, we previously observed that approximately 300 bp of 5'-flanking DNA mediated cAMP and interleukin-1 (IL-1) stimulation and dexamethasone (Dex) inhibition of hSP-A2 promoter activity. This region contains response elements for estrogen-related receptor alpha element (ERRE, -241 bp), thyroid transcription factor (TTF)-1/Nkx2.1 (TTF-binding protein, -171 bp), upstream stimulatory factor 1/2 (E-box, -80 bp), and stimulatory protein (Sp) 1 (G/T-box, -62 bp), which are essential for basal and cAMP induction of hSP-A2 expression. To define genomic regions necessary for developmental, hormonal, and tissue-specific regulation of hSP-A2 expression in vivo, we analyzed transgenic mice carrying hGH reporter genes comprised of 313 bp of hSP-A2 gene 5'-flanking DNA +/- mutation in the TBE or 175 bp of 5'-flanking DNA, containing TBE, E-box and G/T-box, but lacking ERRE. Transgenes containing 313 or 175 bp of hSP-A2 5'-flanking DNA were expressed in a lung cell-specific manner and developmentally regulated in concert with the endogenous mouse SP-A gene. In cultured lung explants from hSP-A(-313):hGH transgenic fetal mice, cAMP and IL-1 induced and Dex inhibited transgene expression. However, the 175-bp hSP-A2 genomic region was insufficient to mediate hormonal regulation of hSP-A2 promoter activity. The finding that expression of the hSP-A(-313TBEmut):hGH transgene was essentially undetectable in fetal lung and was not hormonally regulated in transgenic fetal lung explants underscores the critical importance of the TBE in lung cell-specific, developmental, and hormonal regulation of hSP-A2 gene expression.
Vascular endothelial growth factor D has recently been linked to the control of lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis. The molecular determinants regulating vegf-D gene transcription, however, have not yet been identified. After isolation of 2 kb of 5'-flanking DNA of the human vegf-D gene, we identified a novel, atypical direct repeat (DR) element consisting of a consensus half-site (AGGTCA) at -125/-119 and a degenerated DR half-site (ATGTTA) at -99/-94 as sufficient and necessary for vegf-D transcription. The vegf-D DR element is bound and activated by the orphan receptors hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF-4 alpha) and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF)-1/COUP-TF2. Additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays identified transcriptional coactivators cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein-binding protein and glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein 1 at the vegf-D DR element and functional assays confirmed their stimulatory effect on the vegf-D promoter. Histone deacetylase inhibition by trichostatin A led to accumulation of acetylated histones H3/H4 at the vegf-D promoter, up-regulation of vegf-D mRNA levels, and transactivation of vegf-D promoter reporter gene constructs in cancer cell lines. This study for the first time describes the molecular determinants in cis and trans controlling vegf-D gene transcription and identifies interaction of HNF-4 alpha and COUP-TF1/COUP-TF2 with a proximal, atypical DR element as indispensable for vegf-D transcription. Moreover, our findings suggest that epigenetic control of histone acetylation represents an important determinant of vegf-D gene expression in cancer cells. These results provide novel insights into the molecular machinery controlling vegf-D gene expression and may add to a better understanding of the regulation of lymphangiogenesis in vascular development and cancer.
Local estrogen biosynthesis is a major factor in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Aberrant expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and aromatase in endometriotic tissue leads to an up-regulation of estrogen production. The transcription factor steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) activates the promoters of both StAR and aromatase in endometriotic tissue. We investigated differences in SF-1 expression in endometriotic tissue and normally located endometrium to elucidate the mechanism underlying increased StAR and aromatase activities in endometriosis. Serial deletion and site-directed mutants of the SF-1 promoter showed that an E-box sequence was critical for its activity in endometriotic stromal cells. EMSAs showed that the upstream stimulatory factor (USF) 1 and 2 in nuclear extracts from endometrial and endometriotic stromal cells bound to the E-box. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation-PCR assay, however, demonstrated in intact cells that binding activity of USF2 to the SF-1 promoter was strikingly higher than that of USF1 in endometriotic stromal cells and that USF1 or USF2 binding activity was hardly detectable in endometrial stromal cells. Moreover, knockdown of USF2 but not USF1 resulted in robust and consistent down-regulation of SF-1 and its target genes StAR and aromatase in endometriotic stromal cells. USF2 but not USF1 mRNA and protein levels were significantly higher in endometriotic vs. endometrial stromal cells. In vivo, USF2 mRNA and immunoreactive USF2 levels in endometriotic tissues were strikingly higher than those in endometrium. Taken together, the elevated levels of USF2 in endometriosis account for, in part, the aberrant expression of SF-1 and its target gene StAR and aromatase.
In addition to reproductive tissue, sex hormones induce transcriptional events in many connective tissue cells, including osteoblasts. Some sex hormone receptor modulators with bone sparing effects selectively target estrogen or androgen receptors, whereas others appear more promiscuous, in part through enzymatic metabolism. Rat osteoblasts express significant oxidative 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity, which can convert precursor substrates to potent androgen receptor agonists. Here we show that they also express 3-ketosteroid reductase activity, exemplified by 7-methyl-17-ethynyl-19-norandrostan-5 (10)en-3-one (tibolone) conversion to potent estrogen receptor alpha agonists. Conversion was rapid and quantitative, with 3alpha-hydroxytibolone as the primary metabolite. Consistently, tibolone induced estrogen receptor alpha-dependent gene promoter activity through cis-acting estrogen response elements, increased the stimulatory effect of TGF-beta on Smad-dependent gene promoter activity, and enhanced prostaglandin E2-induced activity of transcription factor Runx2. Rat osteoblasts express the 3-ketosteroid reductase AKR1C9, an aldo-keto reductase gene family member. Exposure to prostaglandin E2 increased AKR1C9 gene promoter activity and mRNA expression. AKR1C9 promoter activity was also enhanced by overexpression of protein kinase A catalytic subunit or transcription factor C/EBPdelta, and the effect of PGE2 was reduced by dominant negative C/EBPdelta competition or C/EBPdelta antisense expression. Moreover, prostaglandin E2 increased the amount of functional endogenous nuclear C/EBPdelta that could bind specifically to a distinct domain approximately 1.8-kb upstream from the start site of AKR1C9 transcription. In summary, in addition to 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, rat osteoblasts express significant and regulatable 3-ketosteroid reductase activity. Through these enzymes, they may selectively metabolize precursor compounds into potent steroid receptor agonists locally within bone.
The aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) belongs to the basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors and regulates several genes as heterodimers with other bHLH proteins. ARNT is also able to homodimerize, but no mammalian target genes for the homodimer have been shown. We identified a palindromic E-box element in the 5' regulatory region of the murine cytochrome P450 (Cyp) 2a5 gene that was found to be important for Cyp2a5 transcription in primary hepatocytes, and was found by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to interact with ARNT. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assay experiments with in vitro translated ARNT showed binding without heterodimerization partner, indicating binding as a homodimer. Transfection studies in wild-type and ARNT-deficient Hepa-1 cells revealed that ARNT expression is necessary for full activity of the Cyp2a5 promoter. In the liver-specific Arnt-null mouse line, the level of hepatic CYP2A5 mRNA was decreased significantly. Co-transfection studies with an ARNT expression vector lacking the transactivation domain (TAD) demonstrated that the ARNT TAD is needed for Cyp2a5 activation, which suggests that ARNT transactivates Cyp2a5 as a homodimer. In primary hepatocytes, the mRNA levels of both CYP2A5 and ARNT splice variant 1 were increased during cultivation. Upstream stimulatory factors 1 and 2a were also able to bind to the same E-box as ARNT, indicating that there may be competition for DNA binding between these factors. Indeed, the upstream stimulatory factors activated the Cyp2a5 promoter through the E-box only in the presence of hepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha, while ARNT transactivation was independent of hepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha. In conclusion, these results indicate that ARNT controls Cyp2a5 transcription and thus, for the first time, suggest active involvement of the ARNT homodimer in mammalian gene regulation.
Apelin, a peptide widely expressed in the body, is the endogenous ligand for the APJ receptor. To investigate how the apelin gene is regulated transcriptionally, we cloned and characterized approximately 3000 and approximately 4000 bp 5'-upstream fragments of the rat and human apelin genes. Putative CAAT-like box, but not TATA-box sites were identified. The rat (-207/-1 bp) and human (-100/+74 bp) core promoter sequences contain putative binding sites for upstream stimulatory factor (USF)-1/-2. Mutagenesis and overexpression assays showed that USF up-regulates basal and inducible apelin transcription. EMSA and supershift experiments indicated binding of USF-1/-2 to the rat (-114/-109 bp) and human (-84/-79 bp) apelin promoters. ChIP experiments show that USF is recruited to the putative USF binding site in the human apelin promoter in cultured breast cells. In concert with increased breast apelin expression during pregnancy and lactation in rats, EMSAs demonstrate an elevated binding of pregnant and lactating rat breast nuclear proteins to a consensus USF oligonucleotide. In vivo ChIP assays verified increased USF binding to the apelin promoter in breast of lactating rats. Together, our findings show that USF exerts a stimulatory role in regulation of breast apelin expression during pregnancy and lactation.
The hypothalamic neuropeptide, gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), is a primary regulatory factor in the neuroendocrine control of reproduction. The GnRH decapeptide is released in an episodic manner from hypothalamic GnRH neurons, which are known to express GnRH receptors. Here we examined the signaling pathways by which autocrine GnRH stimulation generates cell survival and proliferative signals in hypothalamic GT1-7 cells. Both GnRH and epidermal growth factor (EGF) caused rapid phosphorylation of cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) and BAD. The selective epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) antagonist, AG1478, attenuates the phosphorylation of these proteins by GnRH and EGF. Inhibition of PKC and Src abolished the stimulatory effects of GnRH, but not that of EGF, consistent with a critical role of these signaling molecules upstream of the EGF-R. All of these effects of GnRH were mimicked by phorbol 12 myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Consistent with the prosurvival and mitogenic effects of phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt (P13-K/Akt) downstream of the EGF-R, inhibition of P13-K diminished the activation of these proteins following stimulation with GnRH, EGF, and PMA. Overexpression of dominant negative Akt attenuated agonist-induced phosphorylation of BAD, but not that of ERK1/2 and CREB. Moreover, overexpression of wild-type RSK-1 resulted in enhanced basal as well as agonist-induced phosphorylation of CREB and BAD, indicating a critical role of RSK-1 in activating cytosolic as well as nuclear proteins. These data reveal novel signaling mechanisms of GnRH-induced phosphorylation of CREB and BAD in GT1-7 neurons through transactivation of the EGF-R.
Steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1, encoded by NR5A1) and estrogen receptor beta (ERβ, encoded by ESR2), which are highly expressed in endometriotic stromal cells (ESCs), contribute to the pathogenesis of endometriosis, but the regulation mechanism remains largely unknown. Transcription factor 21 (TCF21) belongs to the helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family characterized by regulating gene expression via binding to E-box element. Here, we attempted to determine the molecular mechanism of TCF21 on SF-1 and ERβ expression in endometriosis. We found that TCF21 expression in ESCs was higher than that in endometrial stromal cells (EMs), and positively correlated with SF-1 and ERβ expression in ESCs. Since the importance of E-box element for NR5A1 promoter activity has been previously reported, we performed site-mutation and luciferase assay, revealing that the E-box sequence in the ESR2 promoter is also a critical element modulating ERβ expression. Upstream stimulatory factor 2 (USF2) is another bHLH factor implicated in transcriptional regulation. Further analyses elucidated that it is not TCF21, but USF2 exhibited higher binding affinities in ESCs to NR5A1 and ESR2 promoters than in EMs. Additionally, TCF21 knockdown significantly decreased the binding activities of USF2 to NR5A1 and ESR2 promoters via disruption of the TCF21-USF2 complex. Meanwhile, manipulating TCF21 expression significantly affected MMP9 and cyclinD1 expression, as wells as proliferation and invasion of ESCs. Moreover, TCF21 depletion in endometriotic xenografts reduced SF-1 and ERβ expression, abrogating ectopic lesion growth in mice. Cumulatively, a critical role of TCF21 in the pathogenesis of endometriosis is demonstrated, suggesting a potential druggable target for future therapy.
Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) is an endocrine-disrupting chemical. Sertoli cells (SCs) provide physical and nutritional support for developing germ cells. Dysfunction in SCs has adverse effects on spermatogenesis. Previously, we found that the lactational exposure of PCBs (1, 2, and 5 mg/kg birth weight/day, orally from postnatal days 1 to 20) decreased the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) and androgen receptor (AR) expression in SCs of F1 progeny. Transcription factors initiate and regulate the transcription of genes. DNA methylation plays an important role in epigenetic gene regulation. Hence, this study was aimed to identify the level of transcription factors regulating FSHR, AR gene expression, and DNA methylation in the promoter of these genes in SCs of both F1 prepuberal and puberal offspring. DNA methylation in the promoter of FSHR and AR genes was examined by sodium bisulfite conversion technique. The protein levels of transcription factors (steroidogenic factor 1 [SF1], upstream stimulatory factors 1 and 2, c-fos, c-jun, and CREB-binding protein) and enzymes DNA methyltransferases (Dnmt1, Dnmt3ab, Dnmt3l, and histone deacetylase 1 [HDAC1]) were analyzed by Western blotting. The transcription factors that regulate the FSHR and AR gene in SCs were decreased in both the PCB-exposed F1 progeny. Methylation was observed in the promoter of FSHR, AR, and SF1. The protein levels of Dnmt1, Dnmt3ab, Dnmt3l, and HDAC1 were increased in the PCBs-treated groups. Subsequently, it leads to transcriptional repression of the genes in SCs. Our finding suggests that PCBs caused epigenetic change in SCs, thereby it impaired SCs function in F1 progeny.
Hypoxia inducible factor 2 (HIF-2) is a transcriptional activator implicated in the cellular response to hypoxia. Regulation of its inducible subunit, HIF-2α (also known as EPAS1), involves post-translational modifications. Here, we demonstrate that casein kinase 1δ (CK1δ; also known as CSNK1D) phosphorylates HIF-2α at Ser383 and Thr528 in vitro We found that disruption of these phosphorylation sites, and silencing or chemical inhibition of CK1δ, reduced the expression of HIF-2 target genes and the secretion of erythropoietin (EPO) in two hepatic cancer cell lines, Huh7 and HepG2, without affecting the levels of HIF-2α protein expression. Furthermore, when CK1δ-dependent phosphorylation of HIF-2α was inhibited, we observed substantial cytoplasmic mislocalization of HIF-2α, which was reversed upon the addition of the nuclear protein export inhibitor leptomycin B. Taken together, these data suggest that CK1δ enhances EPO secretion from liver cancer cells under hypoxia by modifying HIF-2α and promoting its nuclear accumulation. This modification represents a new mechanism of HIF-2 regulation that might allow HIF isoforms to undertake differing functions.
Endometriosis, pro-inflammatory and invasive benign disease estrogen dependent, abnormally express in endometria the enzyme P450Arom, positively regulated by steroid factor-1 (SF-1). Our objective was to study the nuclear protein contents of upstream stimulating factor 2 (USF2a and USF2b), a positive regulator of SF-1, throughout the menstrual cycle in eutopic endometria from women with and without (control) endometriosis and the involvement of nuclear estrogen receptors (ER) and G-coupled protein estrogen receptor (GPER)-1.
Upstream stimulating factor 2 protein contents were higher in mid (USF2b) and late (USF2a and USF2b) secretory phase in eutopic endometria from endometriosis than control (p &lt; 0.05). In isolated control epithelial cells incubated with E2 and PGE2, to resemble the endometriosis condition, the data showed: (a) significant increase of USF2a and USF2b nuclear protein contents when treated with E2, PPT (specific agonist for ERα) or G1 (specific agonist for GPER1); (b) no increase in USF2 binding to SF-1 E-Box/DNA consensus sequence in E2-treated cells; (c) USF2 variants protein contents were not modified by PGE2; (d) SF-1 nuclear protein content was significantly higher than basal when treated with PGE2, E2 or G1, stimulation unaffected by ICI (nuclear ER antagonist); and (e) increased (p &lt; 0.05) cytosolic protein contents of P450Arom when treated with PGE2, E2, PPT or G1 compared to basal, effect that was additive with E2 + PGE2 together. Nevertheless, in endometriosis cells, the high USF2, SF-1 and P450Arom protein contents in basal condition were unmodified.
These data strongly suggest that USF2 variants and P450Arom are regulated by E2 through ERα and GPER1, whereas SF-1 through GPER1, visualized by the response of the cells obtained from control endometria, being unaffected the endogenously stimulated cells from endometriosis origin. The lack of E2 stimulation on USF2/SF-1 E-Box/DNA-sequence binding and the absence of PGE2 effect on USF2 variants opposite to the strong induction that they exert on SF1 and P450 proteins suggest different mechanisms and indirect regulations. The sustained USF2 variants protein expression during the secretory phase in eutopic endometria from women with endometriosis may participate in the pathophysiology of this disease strongly associated with infertility and its characteristic endometrial invasion to ectopic sites in the pelvic cavity.
Wnt signaling regulates key aspects of diabetic vascular disease.
We generated SM22-Cre;LRP6(fl/fl);LDLR(-/-) mice to determine contributions of Wnt coreceptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) in the vascular smooth muscle lineage of male low-density lipoprotein receptor-null mice, a background susceptible to diet (high-fat diet)-induced diabetic arteriosclerosis.
As compared with LRP6(fl/fl);LDLR(-/-) controls, SM22-Cre;LRP6(fl/fl);LDLR(-/-) (LRP6-VKO) siblings exhibited increased aortic calcification on high-fat diet without changes in fasting glucose, lipids, or body composition. Pulse wave velocity (index of arterial stiffness) was also increased. Vascular calcification paralleled enhanced aortic osteochondrogenic programs and circulating osteopontin (OPN), a matricellular regulator of arteriosclerosis. Survey of ligands and Frizzled (Fzd) receptor profiles in LRP6-VKO revealed upregulation of canonical and noncanonical Wnts alongside Fzd10. Fzd10 stimulated noncanonical signaling and OPN promoter activity via an upstream stimulatory factor (USF)-activated cognate inhibited by LRP6. RNA interference revealed that USF1 but not USF2 supports OPN expression in LRP6-VKO vascular smooth muscle lineage, and immunoprecipitation confirmed increased USF1 association with OPN chromatin. ML141, an antagonist of cdc42/Rac1 noncanonical signaling, inhibited USF1 activation, osteochondrogenic programs, alkaline phosphatase, and vascular smooth muscle lineage calcification. Mass spectrometry identified LRP6 binding to protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT)-1, and nuclear asymmetrical dimethylarginine modification was increased with LRP6-VKO. RNA interference demonstrated that PRMT1 inhibits OPN and TNAP, whereas PRMT4 supports expression. USF1 complexes containing the histone H3 asymmetrically dimethylated on Arg-17 signature of PRMT4 are increased with LRP6-VKO. Jmjd6, a demethylase downregulated with LRP6 deficiency, inhibits OPN and TNAP expression, USF1: histone H3 asymmetrically dimethylated on Arg-17 complex formation, and transactivation.
LRP6 restrains vascular smooth muscle lineage noncanonical signals that promote osteochondrogenic differentiation, mediated in part via USF1- and arginine methylation-dependent relays.
Previous in vivo study demonstrated that chronic hypoxia during gestation was associated with estrogen receptor-α (ER-α) gene repression in ovine uterine arteries. Yet, it remains undetermined whether hypoxia had a direct effect and if DNA methylation played a causal role in hypoxia-mediated ER-α gene repression. Thus, this study tested the hypothesis that prolonged hypoxia has a direct effect and increases promoter methylation resulting in ER-α gene repression and inhibition of estrogen-mediated adaptation of uterine vascular tone. Uterine arteries isolated from nonpregnant and pregnant sheep were treated ex vivo with 21.0% O2 and 10.5% O2 for 48 hours. Hypoxia significantly increased ER-α promoter methylation at both specificity protein-1 and upstream stimulatory factor binding sites, decreased specificity protein-1 and upstream stimulatory factor binding to the promoter, and suppressed ER-α expression in uterine arteries of pregnant animals. Of importance, the effects of hypoxia were blocked by a methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. In addition, hypoxia abrogated steroid hormone-mediated increase in ER-α expression and inhibited the hormone-induced increase in large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel activity and decrease in myogenic tone in uterine arteries of nonpregnant animals, which were reversed by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. The results provide novel evidence of a direct effect of hypoxia on heightened promoter methylation that plays a causal role in ER-α gene repression and ablation of steroid hormone-mediated adaptation of uterine arterial large conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel activity and myogenic tone in pregnancy. 
Chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor 2 (COUP-TFII), an orphan nuclear receptor belonging to the steroid-thyroid hormone receptor superfamily, plays an important role in cell fate determination of various tissues. However, the specific role of COUP-TFII in tooth development has not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we aimed to explore the role of COUP-TFII in dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) expression and matrix mineralization in odontoblast-lineage cells. In primary human dental pulp cells (HDPCs) and murine dental papilla-derived cells (MDPC-23) cultured in a mineralizing medium, the expression of COUP-TFII was induced along with the increased odontoblast-specific dentin matrix protein-1 (DMP-1) and DSPP expression. Endogenous expression of COUP-TFII in maxillary second molar germs of rats showed an increasing tendency as development of the tooth progressed. Also, COUP-TFII protein was detected in greater quantity in the odontoblastic layer of second molar germs than in that of third molar germs of rats. Overexpression of COUP-TFII using an adenoviral system upregulated the expression of odontoblast-specific genes with increased alkaline phosphatase activity and matrix mineralization in odontoblast-lineage cells. In contrast, knockdown of COUP-TFII using small interfering RNA decreased the expression of odontoblast-specific genes, which reduced matrix mineralization. Mechanistic studies revealed that COUP-TFII increased DSPP transcription by direct binding on the DSPP promoter. In addition, COUP-TFII physically interacted with the homeodomain transcription factor Msx2 and antagonistically regulated the Msx2 effect on DSPP promoter activity. Taken together, these results suggest that COUP-TFII has a stimulatory role in DSPP expression and matrix mineralization in odontoblast-lineage cells. 
Polyadenylation is the RNA processing step that completes the maturation of nearly all eukaryotic mRNAs. It is a two-step nuclear process that involves an endonucleolytic cleavage of the pre-mRNA at the 3'-end and the polymerization of a polyadenosine (polyA) tail, which is fundamental for mRNA stability, nuclear export and efficient translation during development. The core molecular machinery responsible for the definition of a polyA site includes several recognition, cleavage and polyadenylation factors that identify and act on a given polyA signal present in a pre-mRNA, usually an AAUAAA hexamer or similar sequence. This mechanism is tightly regulated by other cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors, and its misregulation can cause inefficient gene expression and may ultimately lead to disease. The majority of genes generate multiple mRNAs as a result of alternative polyadenylation in the 3'-untranslated region. The variable lengths of the 3' untranslated regions created by alternative polyadenylation are a recognizable target for differential regulation and clearly affect the fate of the transcript, ultimately modulating the expression of the gene. Over the past few years, several studies have highlighted the importance of polyadenylation and alternative polyadenylation in gene expression and their impact in a variety of physiological conditions, as well as in several illnesses. Abnormalities in the 3'-end processing mechanisms thus represent a common feature among many oncological, immunological, neurological and hematological disorders, but slight imbalances can lead to the natural establishment of a specific cellular state. This review addresses the key steps of polyadenylation and alternative polyadenylation in different cellular conditions and diseases focusing on the molecular effectors that ensure a faultless pre-mRNA 3' end formation. 
While the functions of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α)/aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) and HIF2α/ARNT (HIF2) proteins in activating hypoxia-inducible genes are well established, the role of other transcription factors in the hypoxic transcriptional response is less clear. We report here for the first time that the basic helix-loop-helix-leucine-zip transcription factor upstream stimulatory factor 2 (USF2) is required for the hypoxic transcriptional response, specifically, for hypoxic activation of HIF2 target genes. We show that inhibiting USF2 activity greatly reduces hypoxic induction of HIF2 target genes in cell lines that have USF2 activity, while inducing USF2 activity in cells lacking USF2 activity restores hypoxic induction of HIF2 target genes. Mechanistically, USF2 activates HIF2 target genes by binding to HIF2 target gene promoters, interacting with HIF2α protein, and recruiting coactivators CBP and p300 to form enhanceosome complexes that contain HIF2α, USF2, CBP, p300, and RNA polymerase II on HIF2 target gene promoters. Functionally, the effect of USF2 knockdown on proliferation, motility, and clonogenic survival of HIF2-dependent tumor cells in vitro is phenocopied by HIF2α knockdown, indicating that USF2 works with HIF2 to activate HIF2 target genes and to drive HIF2-depedent tumorigenesis.
Within the testis, each Sertoli cell can support a finite number of developing germ cells. During development, the cessation of Sertoli cell proliferation and the onset of differentiation establish the final number of Sertoli cells and, thus, the total number of sperm that can be produced. The upstream stimulatory factors 1 and 2 (USF1 and USF2, respectively) differentially regulate numerous Sertoli cell genes during differentiation. To identify genes that are activated by USF proteins during differentiation, studies were conducted in Sertoli cells isolated from 5- and 11-day-old rats, representing proliferating and differentiating cells, respectively. Usf1 mRNA and USF1 protein levels were increased between 5 and 11 days after birth. In vitro studies revealed that USF1 and USF2 DNA-binding activity also increased at 11 days for the promoters of four potential target genes, Fshr, Gata4, Nr5a1, and Shbg. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that USF recruitment increased in vivo between 5 and 11 days after birth at the Fshr, Gata4, and Nr5a1 promoters. Expression of Nr5a1 and Shbg, but not of Fshr or Gata4, mRNAs was elevated in 11-day-old Sertoli cells compared with 5-day-old Sertoli cells. Transient transfection of USF1 and USF2 expression vectors up-regulated Nr5a1 and Shbg promoter activity. RNA interference assays demonstrated that USF1 and USF2 contribute to Nr5a1 and Shbg expression in differentiating cells. Together, these data indicate that increased USF levels induce the expression of Nr5a1 and Shbg during the differentiation of Sertoli cells, whereas Fshr and Gata4 expression is not altered by USF proteins during differentiation.
Serotonin transporter (SERT) regulates extracellular availability of serotonin and is a potential pharmacological target for gastrointestinal disorders. A decrease in SERT has been implicated in intestinal inflammatory and diarrheal disorders. However, little is known regarding regulation of SERT in the intestine. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is known to influence intestinal electrolyte and nutrient transport processes and has protective effects on intestinal mucosa. Whether EGF regulates SERT in the human intestine is not known. The present studies examined the regulation of SERT by EGF, utilizing Caco-2 cells grown on Transwell inserts as an in vitro model. Treatment with EGF from the basolateral side (10 ng/ml, 24 h) significantly stimulated SERT activity (∼2-fold, P &lt; 0.01) and mRNA levels compared with control. EGF increased the activities of the two alternate promoter constructs for human SERT gene: SERT promoter 1 (hSERTp1, upstream of exon 1a) and SERT promoter 2 (hSERTp2, upstream of exon 2). Inhibition of EGF receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase activity by PD168393 (1 nM) blocked the stimulatory effects of EGF on SERT promoters. Progressive deletions of the SERT promoter indicated that the putative EGF-responsive elements are present in the -672/-472 region of the hSERTp1 and regions spanning -1195/-738 and -152/+123 of hSERTp2. EGF markedly increased the binding of Caco-2 nuclear proteins to the potential AP-1 cis-elements present in EGF-responsive regions of hSERTp1 and p2. Overexpression of c-jun but not c-fos specifically transactivated hSERTp2, with no effects on hSERTp1. Our findings define novel mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of SERT by EGF via EGFR at the promoter level that may contribute to the beneficial effects of EGF in gut disorders.
Isobutanol, a C4 branched-chain higher alcohol, is regarded as an attractive next-generation transport fuel. Metabolic engineering for efficient isobutanol production has been achieved in many studies. BmoR, an alcohol-regulated transcription factor, mediates a σ54-dependent promoter Pbmo of alkane monooxygenase in n-alkane metabolism of Thauera butanivorans and displays high sensitivity to C4-C6 linear alcohols and C3-C5 branched-chain alcohols. In this study, to achieve the high-level production of isobutanol, we established a screening system which relied on the combination of BmoR-based biosensor and isobutanol biosynthetic pathway and then employed it to screen isobutanol overproduction strains from an ARTP mutagenesis library.
Firstly, we constructed and verified a GFP-based BmoR-Pbmo device responding to the isobutanol produced by the host. Then, this screening system was employed to select three mutants which exhibited higher GFP/OD600 values than that of wild type. Significantly, GFP/OD600 of mutant 10 was 190.7 ± 4.8, a 1.4-fold higher value than that of wild type. Correspondingly, the isobutanol titer of that strain was 1597.6 ± 129.6 mg/L, 2.0-fold higher than the wild type. With the overexpression of upstream pathway genes, the isobutanol production from mutant 10 reached 14.0 ± 1.0 g/L after medium optimization in shake flask. The isobutanol titer reached 56.5 ± 1.8 g/L in a fed-batch production experiment.
This work screened out isobutanol overproduction strains from a mutagenesis library by using a screening system which depended on the combination of BmoR-based biosensor and isobutanol biosynthetic pathway. Optimizing fermentation condition and reinforcing upstream pathway could realize the increase of isobutanol production from the overproducer. Lastly, fed-batch fermentation of the mutant enhanced the isobutanol production to 56.5 ± 1.8 g/L.
Functional validation of candidate genes involved in adaptation and speciation remains challenging. Here, we exemplify the utility of a method quantifying individual mRNA transcripts in revealing the molecular basis of divergence in feather pigment synthesis during early-stage speciation in crows. Using a padlock probe assay combined with rolling circle amplification, we quantified cell-type-specific gene expression in the histological context of growing feather follicles. Expression of Tyrosinase Related Protein 1 (TYRP1), Solute Carrier Family 45 member 2 (SLC45A2) and Hematopoietic Prostaglandin D Synthase (HPGDS) was melanocyte-limited and significantly reduced in follicles from hooded crow, explaining the substantially lower eumelanin content in grey versus black feathers. The central upstream Melanocyte Inducing Transcription Factor (MITF) only showed differential expression specific to melanocytes - a feature not captured by bulk RNA-seq. Overall, this study provides insight into the molecular basis of an evolutionary young transition in pigment synthesis, and demonstrates the power of histologically explicit, statistically substantiated single-cell gene expression quantification for functional genetic inference in natural populations.
The human SLC25A13 gene encodes the liver type aspartate/glutamate carrier isoform 2 (AGC2, commonly named as citrin), which plays a key role in the main NADH-shuttle of human hepatocyte. Biallelic SLC25A13 mutations result in Citrin deficiency (CD). In order to identify the important regulatory region of SLC25A13 gene and elucidate the way how potential promoter mutations affect the citrin expression, we performed promoter deletion analysis and established the reporter constructs of luciferase gene-carrying SLC25A13 promoter containing several mutations located in putative transcription factor-binding sites. The luciferase activities of all promoter constructs were measured using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System. Bioinformatic analysis showed that the promoter of SLC25A13 gene lacks TATA box and obviously typical initiator element, but contains a CCAAT box and two GC box. Promoter deletion analysis confirmed the region from -221 to -1 upstream ATG was essential for SLC25A13 to maintain the promoter activity. We utilized dual-luciferase reporter system as function analytical model to tentatively assess the effect of artificially constructed promoter mutations on citrin expression, and our analysis revealed that mutated putative CCAAT box and GC box could significantly affect the citrin expression. Our study confirmed the important SLC25A13 promoter regions that influenced citrin expression in HL7702 cells, and constructed a function analytical model. This work may be useful to further identify the pathogenic mutations leading to CD in the promoter region.
Synthetic promoters are an attractive alternative for use in mammalian hosts such as CHO cells as they can be designed de novo with user-defined functionalities. In this study, we describe and validate a method for bioprocess-directed design of synthetic promoters utilizing CHO genomic sequence information. We designed promoters with two objective features, (i) constitutive high-level recombinant gene transcription, and (ii) upregulated transcription under mild hypothermia or late-stage culture. CHO genes varying in transcriptional activity were selected based on a comparative analysis of RNA-Seq transcript levels in normal and biphasic cultures in combination with estimates of mRNA half-life from published genome scale datasets. Discrete transcription factor regulatory elements (TFREs) upstream of these genes were informatically identified and functionally screened in vitro to identify a subset of TFREs with the potential to support high activity recombinant gene transcription during biphasic cell culture processes. Two libraries of heterotypic synthetic promoters with varying TFRE combinations were then designed in silico that exhibited a maximal 2.5-fold increase in transcriptional strength over the CMV-IE promoter after transient transfection into host CHO-K1 cells. A subset of synthetic promoters was then used to create stable transfectant pools using CHO-K1 cells under glutamine synthetase selection. Whilst not achieving the maximal 2.5-fold increase in productivity over stable pools harboring the CMV promoter, all stably transfected cells utilizing synthetic promoters exhibited increased reporter production - up to 1.6-fold that of cells employing CMV, both in the presence or absence of intron A immediately downstream of the promoter. The increased productivity of stably transfected cells harboring synthetic promoters was maintained during fed-batch culture, with or without a transition to mild hypothermia at the onset of stationary phase. Our data exemplify that it is important to consider both host cell and intended bioprocess contexts as design criteria in the de novo construction of synthetic genetic parts for mammalian cell engineering.
Skin denervation that develops in patients with diabetes mellitus as a neuropathic manifestation is known as diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Skin denervation is parallel to neuronal injuries that alter intracellular signaling. To date, the correlation between nerve injury and the activation of intracellular responses to neuropathic manifestations has not been elucidated; specifically, whether activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is responsible for neuronal injury and a critical molecule that modulates the activation of intracellular protein kinase C epsilon (p-PKCε) and pain development in DPN is a crucial question.
To address, ATF3 knockout (atf3-/- group, C57/B6 genetic background) and wild-type mice (atf3+/+ group) received a single dose of streptozotocin (200 mg/kg) to generate a mouse model of DPN.
Both atf3+/+ and atf3-/- mice exhibited hyperglycemia and the same pathology of skin denervation at posttreatment month 2, but only atf3+/+ mice developed thermal hyperalgesia (P&lt;0.001) and mechanical allodynia (P=0.002). The atf3+/+ group, but not the atf3-/- group, had preferential ATF3 upregulation on p-PKCε(+) neurons with a ratio of 37.7%±6.1% in p-PKCε(+):ATF3(+) neurons (P&lt;0.001). In addition, B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-XL), an antiapoptotic Bcl2 family protein, exhibited parallel patterns to p-PKCε (ie, Bcl-XL upregulation was reversed in atf3-/- mice). These two molecules were colocalized and increased by approximately two-fold in the atf3+/+ group compared with the atf3-/- group (30.0%±3.4% vs 13.7% ± 6.2%, P=0.003). Furthermore, linear analysis results showed that the densities of p-PKCε and Bcl-XL had a reverse linear relationship with the degrees of thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia.
Collectively, this report suggested that ATF3 is a critical upstream molecule that modulates p-PKCε and Bcl-XL expression, which consequently mediated the development of neuropathic manifestation in DPN.
Three-dimensional cell cultures, such as multicellular spheroids (MCS), reflect the in vivo architecture of solid tumours and multicellular drug resistance. We previously identified interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) to be responsible for the up-regulation of a subset of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs) in MCS of colon carcinoma cells. This set of ISGs closely resembled a previously identified IFN-related DNA-damage resistance signature (IRDS) that was correlated to resistance to chemo- and radiotherapy. In this study we found that transcription factor STAT3 is activated upstream of IRF9 and binds to the IRF9 promoter in MCS of HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells. Transferring conditioned media (CM) from high cell density conditions to non-confluent cells resulted in STAT3 activation and increased expression of IRF9 and a panel of IRDS genes, also observed in MCS, suggesting the involvement of a soluble factor. Furthermore, we identified gp130/JAK signalling to be responsible for STAT3 activation, IRF9, and IRDS gene expression in MCS and by CM. Our data suggests a novel mechanism where STAT3 is activated in high cell density conditions resulting in increased expression of IRF9 and, in turn, IRDS genes, underlining a mechanism by which drug resistance is regulated.
20-Hydroxy-3-oxolupan-28-oic acid (HOA), a lupane-type triterpene, was obtained from the leaves of Mahonia bealei, which is described in the Chinese Pharmacopeia as a remedy for inflammation and related diseases. The anti-inflammatory mechanisms of HOA, however, have not yet been fully elucidated. Therefore, the objective of this study was to characterize the molecular mechanisms of HOA in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. HOA suppressed the release of nitric oxide (NO), pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages without affecting cell viability. Quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis indicated that HOA also suppressed the gene expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), TNF-α, and IL-6. Further analyses demonstrated that HOA inhibited the phosphorylation of upstream signaling molecules, including p85, PDK1, Akt, IκBα, ERK, and JNK, as well as the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) p65. Interestingly, HOA had no effect on the LPS-induced nuclear translocation of activator protein 1 (AP-1). Taken together, these results suggest that HOA inhibits the production of cytokine by downregulating iNOS, TNF-α, and IL-6 gene expression via the downregulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and the inhibition of NF-κB activation. Our findings indicate that HOA could potentially be used as an anti-inflammatory agent for medical use.
Obesity, a major risk factor for the development of osteoarthritis (OA), is associated with increased circulating levels of free fatty acids (FFA). However, the role of these FFAs in OA pathophysiology is not clearly understood. In the present study, we found that palmitate treatment of human primary articular chondrocytes increased the expression of ER stress markers [activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP)] and apoptosis markers [cytochrome c and cleaved caspase-3 (CC3)]. Palmitate treatment also increased the expression of Nuclear protein 1 (Nupr1) and tribbles related protein 3 (TRB3), which are known negative regulators of cell survival pathways. Knockdown of Nupr1 or CHOP expression inhibited palmitate mediated increased expression of TRB3 and CC3, indicating that Nupr1 and CHOP cooperate to regulate cell survival and apoptotic pathways in human chondrocytes. Nupr1 knockdown had no effect on CHOP expression whereas CHOP knockdown abolished the palmitate-mediated Nupr1 expression, indicating that CHOP is functional upstream to Nupr1 in this pathway. Moreover, overexpression of Nupr1 markedly increased the basal expression of pro-apoptotic molecules, including cytochrome c and CC3. Taken together, our study demonstrates that Nupr1 plays a crucial role in palmitate-induced apoptosis in human chondrocytes and Nupr1 as a potential novel drug target for the treatment of OA.
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) transcribed across gene promoters have been detected. These regulate transcription by mechanisms that have not been fully elucidated. We herein show that the chromatin configuration is altered into an accessible state within 290 bp downstream from the initiation site of metabolic-stress-induced lncRNAs (mlonRNAs) in the promoter of the fission yeast fbp1 gene, whose transcription is massively induced upon glucose starvation. Chromatin upstream from fbp1 is progressively altered into an open configuration, as a cascade of transcription of three overlapping mlonRNA species (-a, -b and -c in order) occurs with transcriptional initiation sites progressing 5' to 3' upstream of the fbp1 promoter. Initiation of the shortest mlonRNA (mlonRNA-c) induces chromatin remodeling around a transcription factor-binding site and subsequent massive induction of fbp1. We identify the cis-element required for mlonRNA-c initiation, and by changing the distance between mlonRNA-initiation site and the transcription factor-binding site, we show that mlonRNA-initiation effectively induces chromatin remodeling in a limited distance within 290 bp. These results indicate that mlonRNAs are transcribed across the fbp1 promoter as a short-range inducer for local chromatin alterations, and suggest that strict chromatin modulation is archived via stepwise mlonRNA-initiations.
Synaptic pathology may be one of the cellular substrates underlying autism spectrum disorder (ASD). ZNF804A is a transcription factor that can affect or regulate the expression of many candidate genes involved in ASD. It also localizes at synapses and regulates neuronal and synaptic morphology. So far, few reports have addressed possible associations between ZNF804A polymorphisms and ASD. This study aimed to investigate whether ZNF804A genetic variants contribute to ASD susceptibility and its possible pathological role in the disorder. We analyzed the relationship of two polymorphisms (rs10497655 and rs34714481) in ZNF804A promoter region with ASD in 854 cases versus 926 controls. The functional analyses of rs10497655 were then performed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation and dual-luciferase assays. The variant rs10497655 was significantly associated with ASD (P = 0.007851), which had a significant effect on ZNF804A expression, with the T risk allele homozygotes related with reduced ZNF804A expression in human fetal brains. HSF2 acted as a suppressor by down-regulating ZNF804A expression and had a stronger binding affinity for the T allele of rs10497655 than for the C allele. This was the first experiment to elucidate the process in which a disease-associated SNP affects the level of ZNF804A expression by binding with the upstream regulation factor HSF2. This result indicates that the rs10497655 allelic expression difference of ZNF804A during the critical period of brain development may have an effect on postnatal phenotypes of ASD. It reveals new roles of ZNF804A polymorphisms in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders.
Copper metabolism MURR1 domain-containing 1 (COMMD1) is a protein that participates in multiple cellular processes, including copper homeostasis and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) signaling. The COMMD1 upstream regulators X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) and p300 and downstream targets such as NF-κB and HIF-1α are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. However, whether COMMD1 regulates cell proliferation and the cell cycle remains unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated that both overexpression and knockdown of COMMD1 affected the proliferation of HEK293 cells, and the cell cycle assay revealed that ectopic expression of COMMD1 arrested the cell cycle at the G1 phase. Furthermore, western blot analysis showed that COMMD1 affected p21 Cip1 levels. Taken together, these results suggest that COMMD1 regulates cell proliferation and cell cycle progression by modulating p21 Cip1 levels. Abbreviations COMMD1: Copper metabolism MURR1 domain containing 1; XIAP: X chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein; FCS: Fetal calf serum; WCE: Whole cell extracts; RT-PCR: Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; HEK293: Human embryonic kidney 293; ShRNA: Short hairpin RNA; NF-κB: Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; ARF: Alternate reading frame protein product of the CDKN2A locus.
Tissue factor (TF) expressed in cancer cells has been linked to tumor-associated thrombosis, a major cause of mortality in malignancy. Hypoxia is a common feature of solid tumors and can upregulate TF. In this study, the effect of YC-1, a putative inhibitor of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), on hypoxia-induced TF expression was investigated in human lung cancer A549 cells. YC-1 selectively prevented hypoxia-induced TF expression and procoagulant activity without affecting the basal TF levels. Surprisingly, knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of HIF-1α failed to mimic YC-1's effect on TF expression, suggesting other mechanisms are involved. NF-κB, a transcription factor for TF, and its upstream regulator p38, were activated by hypoxia exposure. Treatment of hypoxic A549 cells with YC-1 prevented the activation of both NF-κB and p38. Inhibition of p38 suppressed hypoxia-activated NF-κB, and inhibited TF expression and activity to similar levels as treatment with an NF-κB inhibitor. Furthermore, stimulation of p38 by anisomycin reversed the effects of YC-1. Taken together, our results suggest that YC-1 prevents hypoxia-induced TF in cancer cells by inhibiting the p38/NF-κB pathway, this is distinct from the conventional anticoagulants that systemically inhibit blood coagulation and may shed new light on approaches to treat tumor-associated thrombosis.
Caudal-related homeobox transcription factor 2 (CDX2), an intestine-specific nuclear transcription factor, has been strongly implicated in the tumourigenesis of various human cancers. However, the functional role of CDX2 in the development and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) is not well known. In this study, CDX2 knockdown in colon cancer cells promoted cell proliferation in vitro, accelerated tumor formation in vivo, and induced a cell cycle transition from G0/G1 to S phase, whereas CDX2 overexpression inhibited cell proliferation. TOP/FOP-Flash reporter assay showed that CDX2 knockdown or CDX2 overexpression significantly increased or decreased Wnt signaling activity. Western blot assay showed that downstream targets of Wnt signaling, including β-catenin, cyclin D1 and c-myc, were up-regulated or down-regulated in CDX2-knockdown or CDX2-overexpressing colon cancer cells. In addition, suppression of Wnt signaling by XAV-939 led to a marked suppression of the cell proliferation enhanced by CDX2 knockdown, whereas activation of this signaling by CHIR-99021 significantly enhanced the cell proliferation inhibited by CDX2 overexpression. Dual-luciferase reporter and quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (qChIP) assays further confirmed that CDX2 transcriptionally activates glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and axis inhibition protein 2 (Axin2) expression by directly binding to the promoter of GSK-3β and the upstream enhancer of Axin2. In conclusion, these results indicated that CDX2 inhibits the proliferation and tumor formation of colon cancer cells by suppressing Wnt/β-catenin signaling.
Gonad-specific transcription factor spermatogenesis- and oogenesis-specific helix-loop-helix transcription factor 1 (SOHLH1) plays a key role in the transcriptional regulation of the expression of differentiating spermatogonial genes. However, its role in spermatocytes (meiotic male germ cells) remains largely unknown. In this study, Sohlh1 knockout (KO) male mice displayed meiotic defects at the zygotene stage during spermatogenesis. Microarray analyses identified 66 upregulated genes and 139 downregulated genes in Sohlh1 KO testes compared with those in wild-type testes at postnatal Day 7.5. Among many of the downregulated genes, Sycp1 and Sycp3, which encode synaptonemal complex proteins 1 and 3 (SYCP1 and SYCP3), respectively, were significantly reduced in Sohlh1 knockout mice. Transmission electron microscopy revealed no formation of the synaptonemal complex in Sohlh1 KO spermatocytes. Luciferase reporter and chromatin-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that SOHLH1 enhanced the expression of the Sycp1 and Sycp3 genes by binding the -1276, -708, and -94 basepairs (bp) E-boxes upstream of the Sycp1 promoter and the -64 and -43 bp E-boxes upstream of the Sycp3 promoter. Our data suggest that SOHLH1 transcriptionally regulates the expression of many target genes critical for the meiotic phase of spermatogenesis.
Ribosome is the most abundant RNA-protein complex in a cell, and many copies of the ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) have to be maintained. However, arrays of tandemly repeated rDNA genes can lose the copies by intra-repeat recombination. Loss of the rDNA copies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is counteracted by gene amplification whereby the number of rDNA repeats stabilizes around 150 copies, suggesting the presence of a monitoring mechanism that counts and adjusts the number. Here, we report that, in response to rDNA copy loss, the upstream activating factor (UAF) for RNA polymerase I that transcribes the rDNA is released and directly binds to a RNA polymerase II-transcribed gene, SIR2, whose gene products silence rDNA recombination, to repress. We show that the amount of UAF determines the rDNA copy number that is stably maintained. UAF ensures rDNA production not only by rDNA transcription activation but also by its copy-number maintenance.
The legume-rhizobium symbiosis results in nitrogen-fixing root nodules, and their formation involves both intracellular infection initiated in the epidermis and nodule organogenesis initiated in inner root cell layers. NODULE INCEPTION (NIN) is a nodule-specific transcription factor essential for both processes. These NIN-regulated processes occur at different times and locations in the root, demonstrating a complex pattern of spatiotemporal regulation. We show that regulatory sequences sufficient for the epidermal infection process are located within a 5 kb region directly upstream of the NIN start codon in Medicago truncatula Furthermore, we identify a remote upstream cis-regulatory region required for the expression of NIN in the pericycle, and we show that this region is essential for nodule organogenesis. This region contains putative cytokinin response elements and is conserved in eight more legume species. Both the cytokinin receptor 1, which is essential for nodule primordium formation, and the B-type response regulator RR1 are expressed in the pericycle in the susceptible zone of the uninoculated root. This, together with the identification of the cytokinin-responsive elements in the NIN promoter, strongly suggests that NIN expression is initially triggered by cytokinin signaling in the pericycle to initiate nodule primordium formation.
Branch number is one of the main factors affecting the yield of soybean (Glycine max (L.)). In this study, we conducted a genome-wide association study combined with linkage analysis for the identification of a candidate gene controlling soybean branching. Five quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) were associated with branch numbers in a soybean core collection. Among these QTNs, a linkage disequilibrium (LD) block qtnBR6-1 spanning 20 genes was found to overlap a previously identified major quantitative trait locus qBR6-1. To validate and narrow down qtnBR6-1, we developed a set of near-isogenic lines (NILs) harboring high-branching (HB) and low-branching (LB) alleles of qBR6-1, with 99.96% isogenicity and different branch numbers. A cluster of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) segregating between NIL-HB and NIL-LB was located within the qtnBR6-1 LD block. Among the five genes showing differential expression between NIL-HB and NIL-LB, BRANCHED1 (BRC1; Glyma.06G210600) was down-regulated in the shoot apex of NIL-HB, and one missense mutation and two SNPs upstream of BRC1 were associated with branch numbers in 59 additional soybean accessions. BRC1 encodes TEOSINTE-BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDEA/PROLIFERATING CELL FACTORS 1 and 2 transcription factor and functions as a regulatory repressor of branching. On the basis of these results, we propose BRC1 as a candidate gene for branching in soybean.
Macrophages not only play an important role in the innate immune response but also participate in many inflammatory and infectious diseases including asthma, diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and cancers. Bisphenol A (BPA) is the most commonly used component for plastic products. However, BPA is an endocrine disruptor for mammals and participates in several inflammatory and infectious diseases. Up until now, there are no researches demonstrated the potential role of BPA in macrophage activation and its relative mechanism. BPA promoted the generation of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα in a concentration-dependent manner (P &lt; 0.05). BPA was identified to increase the expression of proinflammatory mediators NO and PGE2, and its upstream factors iNOS, COX2, and cPLA2 in a concentration-dependent manner (P &lt; 0.05). Phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 were significantly induced by BPA via IκB degradation (P &lt; 0.05). In addition, phosphorylation of ERK significantly induced by BPA at a concentration which was less than that for phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNK (P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, phosphorylation of STAT3 significantly induced by BPA at a concentration lower than that for phosphorylation of STAT1 (P &lt; 0.05). Phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK2 was also significantly induced by BPA in a concentration-dependent manner (P &lt; 0.05).
PICOT is a ubiquitous protein that has no functional redundant ortholog and is critical for mouse embryonic development. It is involved in the regulation of signal transduction in T lymphocytes and cardiac muscle, and in cellular iron metabolism and biogenesis of Fe/S proteins. However, very little is known about the physiological role of PICOT and its mechanism of action, and on its upstream regulators or downstream target molecules. In attempt to identify new PICOT interaction partners, we adopted the yeast two-hybrid system and screened a Jurkat T cell cDNA library using the full-length human PICOT cDNA as a bait. We found that PICOT interacts with embryonic ectoderm development (EED), a Polycomb Group (PcG) protein that serves as a core component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and contributes to the regulation of chromatin remodeling and cell differentiation. Using bead immobilized GST-PICOT and GST-EED fusion proteins in a pull-down assay and reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation studies we demonstrated that the interaction between PICOT and EED also occurs in human Jurkat T cells. In addition, immunofluorescence staining of Jurkat T cells revealed partial colocalization of PICOT and EED, predominantly in the cell nuclei. A pull-down assay using the GST-EED fusion protein and lysates of cells expressing different Myc-tagged truncation products of PICOT revealed that binding of EED is mediated by each of the two C-terminal PICOT homology domains and suggests that simultaneous interaction via both domains increases the binding affinity. Furthermore, PICOT knock-down in Jurkat T cells resulted in a reduced histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) at the PRC2 target gene, myelin transcription factor 1 (MYT1), suggesting that PICOT binding to EED alters PRC2-regulated transcriptional repression, and potentially contributes to the epigenetic regulation of chromatin silencing and remodeling.
The evolutionarily conserved transcription factor, Tbx18, is expressed in a dynamic pattern throughout embryonic and early postnatal life and plays crucial roles in the development of multiple organ systems. Previous studies have indicated that this dynamic function is controlled by an expansive regulatory structure, extending far upstream and downstream of the gene. With the goal of identifying elements that interact with the Tbx18 promoter in developing prostate, we coupled chromatin conformation capture (4C) and ATAC-seq from embryonic day 18.5 (E18.5) mouse urogenital sinus (UGS), where Tbx18 is highly expressed. The data revealed dozens of active chromatin elements distributed throughout a 1.5 million base pair topologically associating domain (TAD). To identify cell types contributing to this chromatin signal, we used lineage tracing methods with a Tbx18 Cre "knock-in" allele; these data show clearly that Tbx18-expressing precursors differentiate into wide array of cell types in multiple tissue compartments, most of which have not been previously reported. We also used a 209 kb Cre-expressing Tbx18 transgene, to partition enhancers for specific precursor types into two rough spatial domains. Within this central 209 kb compartment, we identified ECR1, previously described to regulate Tbx18 expression in ureter, as an active regulator of UGS expression. Together these data define the diverse fates of Tbx18+ precursors in prostate-associated tissues for the first time, and identify a highly active TAD controlling the gene's essential function in this tissue.
The Hippo pathway plays an important role in determining organ size through regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. Hippo inactivation and consequent activation of YAP (Yes-associated protein), a transcription cofactor, have been proposed as a strategy to promote myocardial regeneration after myocardial infarction. However, the long-term effects of Hippo deficiency on cardiac function under stress remain unknown.
We investigated the long-term effect of Hippo deficiency on cardiac function in the presence of pressure overload (PO).
We used mice with cardiac-specific homozygous knockout of WW45 (WW45cKO), in which activation of Mst1 (Mammalian sterile 20-like 1) and Lats2 (large tumor suppressor kinase 2), the upstream kinases of the Hippo pathway, is effectively suppressed because of the absence of the scaffolding protein. We used male mice at 3 to 4 month of age in all animal experiments. We subjected WW45cKO mice to transverse aortic constriction for up to 12 weeks. WW45cKO mice exhibited higher levels of nuclear YAP in cardiomyocytes during PO. Unexpectedly, the progression of cardiac dysfunction induced by PO was exacerbated in WW45cKO mice, despite decreased apoptosis and activated cardiomyocyte cell cycle reentry. WW45cKO mice exhibited cardiomyocyte sarcomere disarray and upregulation of TEAD1 (transcriptional enhancer factor) target genes involved in cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation during PO. Genetic and pharmacological inactivation of the YAP-TEAD1 pathway reduced the PO-induced cardiac dysfunction in WW45cKO mice and attenuated cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation. Furthermore, the YAP-TEAD1 pathway upregulated OSM (oncostatin M) and OSM receptors, which played an essential role in mediating cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation. OSM also upregulated YAP and TEAD1 and promoted cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation, indicating the existence of a positive feedback mechanism consisting of YAP, TEAD1, and OSM.
Although activation of YAP promotes cardiomyocyte regeneration after cardiac injury, it induces cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation and heart failure in the long-term in the presence of PO through activation of the YAP-TEAD1-OSM positive feedback mechanism.
Cervical cancer (CC) is known as one of the most common gynecological tumors. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a group of regulators that have been widely reported in human malignant tumors including CC. On the basis of the data of The Cancer Genome Atlas, lncRNA DDN and PRKAG1 antisense RNA 1 ( DDN-AS1) that is overexpressed in CC tissues predicted poor prognosis for patients with CC. Moreover, quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis further identified the upregulation of DDN-AS1 in CC tissues and cell lines. Loss-of-function assays revealed that knockdown of DDN-AS1 suppressed CC progression by efficiently inhibiting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Mechanism investigations revealed that DDN-AS1 was upregulated by its upstream transcription activator transcription factor 3 ( TCF3). Moreover, DDN-AS1 increased the expression of  TCF3 by competitively binding miR-15a and miR-16. In conclusion, DDN-AS1-miR-15a/16-TCF3 feedback loop contributes to cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in CC.
Abscisic acid-insensitive 5 (ABI5) is an essential and conserved plant basic leucine zipper transcription factor whose level controls seed germination and postgerminative development. It has been demonstrated that activity of ABI5 is transcriptionally and post-translationally regulated. However, transcriptional regulation of ABI5 is not fully understood. Here, we identified SAB1 (Sensitive to ABA 1) as a novel negative regulator of ABI5 that simultaneously regulates its stability, promoter binding activity and histone methylation-mediated gene silencing of ABI5. SAB1 encodes a Regulator of Chromatin Condensation 1 (RCC1) family protein and is expressed in an opposite pattern to that of ABI5 during early seedling growth in response to abscisic acid (ABA). SAB1 mutation results in enhanced ABA sensitivity and acts upstream of ABI5. SAB1 physically interacts with ABI5 at phosphoamino acid Ser-145, and reduces the phosphorylation of ABI5 and the protein stability. SAB1 reduces ABI5 binding activity to its own promoter, leading to reduced transcriptional level of ABI5. SAB1 inactivates ABI5 transcription by increasing the level of histone H3K27me2 in the ABI5 promoter. Our findings have identified SAB1 as a crucial new component of ABA signaling which modulates early development of plant by precisely controlling ABI5 activity through multiple mechanisms.
Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) engage Piwi proteins to suppress transposons and nonself nucleic acids and maintain genome integrity and are essential for fertility in a variety of organisms. In Caenorhabditis elegans, most piRNA precursors are transcribed from two genomic clusters that contain thousands of individual piRNA transcription units. While a few genes have been shown to be required for piRNA biogenesis, the mechanism of piRNA transcription remains elusive. Here we used functional proteomics approaches to identify an upstream sequence transcription complex (USTC) that is essential for piRNA biogenesis. The USTC contains piRNA silencing-defective 1 (PRDE-1), SNPC-4, twenty-one-U fouled-up 4 (TOFU-4), and TOFU-5. The USTC forms unique piRNA foci in germline nuclei and coats the piRNA cluster genomic loci. USTC factors associate with the Ruby motif just upstream of type I piRNA genes. USTC factors are also mutually dependent for binding to the piRNA clusters and forming the piRNA foci. Interestingly, USTC components bind differentially to piRNAs in the clusters and other noncoding RNA genes. These results reveal the USTC as a striking example of the repurposing of a general transcription factor complex to aid in genome defense against transposons.
Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (CIRI) leads to injury in distant organs, most commonly the lungs, although limited studies have examined self-protective mechanisms during CIRI-induced lung injury. Here, we investigated self-protective mechanisms that attenuate stress-related injury and promote the angiogenetic repair of epithelial function during CIRI-induced lung injury by measuring nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) levels. A CIRI model was established in male Sprague-Dawley rats by blocking the middle cerebral artery. Rats were divided into five subgroups based on the reperfusion time (6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hr). Lung injury was assessed using a semiquantitative score and a thiobarbituric acid-based method of determining malonaldehyde production. Lung tissue angiogenesis was detected by CD34 and CD31 immunolabeling. Changes in Nrf2, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), HIF-1α, vascular-endothelial growth factor (VEGF), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), extracellular-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2), and phospho-ERK1/2 ( p-ERK1/2) protein- and mRNA-expression levels were measured by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions, respectively. Oxidative stress induced by cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (CI/R) caused lung injury. Expression of the Nrf2/HO-1 antioxidative stress pathway in lung tissues increased following CI/R, peaking after 24 hr. PI3K, ERK, and p-ERK1/2, which act upstream of Nrf2/HO-1, were expressed at higher levels in the CI/R-model group, consistent with the general trends observed for Nrf2/HO-1. Within 72 hr post-CI/R, HIF-1α, and VEGF expression significantly increased versus the sham group. Thus, during CIRI-induced lung injury, the body may upregulate antioxidative stress activities and promote angiogenesis to repair the endothelial barrier through the Nrf2/HO-1 and HIF-1α/VEGF signaling pathways, enabling self-protection.
Adequate zinc nutriture is necessary for normal bone growth and development, though the precise mechanisms for zinc-mediated bone growth remain poorly defined. A key transcription factor activated by zinc is metal response element-binding transcription factor 1 (MTF-1), which binds to the metal regulatory element (MRE). We hypothesize that MREs will be found upstream of miRNA genes as well as miRNA target genes in the following bone growth and development signaling pathways: TGF-β, MAPK, and Wnt. A Bioconductor-based workflow in R was designed to identify interactions between MREs, miRNAs, and target genes. MRE sequences were found upstream from 64 mature miRNAs that interact with 213 genes which have MRE sequences in their own promoter regions. MAPK1 exhibited the most miRNA-target interactions (MTIs) in the TGF-β and MAPK signaling pathways; CCND2 exhibited the most interactions in the Wnt signaling pathway. Hsa-miR-124-3p exhibited the most MTIs in the TGF-β and MAPK signaling pathways; hsa-miR-20b-5p exhibited the most MTIs in the Wnt signaling pathway. MYC and hsa-miR-34a-5p were shared between all three signaling pathways, also forming an MTI unit. JUN exhibited the most protein-protein interactions, followed by MAPK8. These in silico data support the hypothesis that intracellular zinc status plays a role in osteogenesis through the transcriptional regulation of miRNA genes via the zinc/MTF-1/MRE complex.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the most common malignancies. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), with abnormal expression and constitutive activation, has been reported to promote proliferation, metastasis, survival and angiogenesis of HCC cells. Rheum palmatum (RP), a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, exhibited tumor-suppressing effects in multiple human cancers, but its potential functions in HCC remain unexplored.
This study aimed to examine the involvement of STAT3 signaling in the anti-HCC effects of RP extract.
SMMC-7721 and HepG2 HCC cell lines were treated with RP extract for 24 h, and then viability, migration, and invasion of HCC cells and angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were analyzed using MTS, wound-healing, Transwell invasion and tube formation assays, respectively. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to examine the activation of key molecules in STAT3 signaling, including STAT3, JAK2, and Src. Additionally, we explored the in vivo antitumor effects of RP extract in a xenograft tumor nude mouse model of HCC.
The result showed that RP extract reduced viability, migration, and invasion of SMMC-7721 and HepG2 cells and angiogenesis of HUVECs. It suppressed the phosphorylation of STAT3 and its upstream kinases including JAK2 and Src. In addition, RP extract treatment downregulated STAT3 target genes, including survivin, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, Bcl-2, MMP-2, MMP-9, Cyclin D1, CDK4, c-Myc, and VEGF-C. Furthermore, RP extract suppressed the xenograft tumor growth and activation of STAT3 in xenograft tumor mice.
Collectively, the results showed that RP extract prevented HCC progression by inhibiting STAT3, and might be useful for the treatment of HCC.
A variety of cellular stresses lead to global translation attenuation due to phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), which decreases the availability of the eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAi ternary complex. However, a subset of mRNAs continues to be translated by non-canonical mechanisms under these conditions. In fact, although translation initiation of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) is normally repressed by an upstream open reading frame (uORF), a decreased availability of ternary complex leads to increased translation of the main ATF4-coding ORF. We show here that siRNA-mediated depletion of eIF5B-which can substitute for eIF2 in delivering Met-tRNAi-leads to increased levels of ATF4 protein in mammalian cells. This de-repression is not due to phosphorylation of eIF2α under conditions of eIF5B depletion. Although eIF5B depletion leads to a modest increase in the steady-state levels of ATF4 mRNA, we show by polysome profiling that the depletion of eIF5B enhances ATF4 expression primarily at the level of translation. Moreover, eIF5B silencing increases the expression of an ATF4-luciferase translational reporter by a mechanism requiring the repressive uORF2. Further experiments suggest that eIF5B cooperates with eIF1A and eIF5, but not eIF2A, to facilitate the uORF2-mediated repression of ATF4 translation.
Perinatal neurodevelopment involves extensive formation of neural connections and onset of activity-dependent gene expression for synaptic function and plasticity. Exposure to psychostimulants at this stage imposes significant risks for developing cognitive and affective disorders later in life. However, how developmental exposure to psychostimulants may induce long-lasting molecular changes relevant to neural circuit function remains incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated the impacts of psychostimulant amphetamine on the activity-dependent induction of synaptic adaptor molecule Arc in the frontal cortex of neonatal mice. We found that transient exposure to amphetamine not only amplifies activity-dependent Arc mRNA expression immediately, but also potentiates subsequent induction of Arc mRNA in the absence of amphetamine. This priming effect is associated with a rapid and persistent increase in histone mono-methylation (H3K4me1), a marker for transcriptionally permissive chromatin, at the Arc locus, but not any long-lasting change in the phosphorylation of upstream transcription factor CREB. Furthermore, the increase in H3K4me1 at the Arc locus requires dopamine receptor signaling, and the priming of Arc expression correlates with the dopaminergic innervation pattern in the frontal cortex. Together, our results demonstrate that developmental exposure to psychostimulant amphetamine induces long-lasting chromatin changes and primes activity-dependent Arc gene induction. These findings reveal the molecular targets of psychostimulant during perinatal development that may contribute to long-term psychiatric risks.
The focus of studies on high-density lipoproteins (HDL) has shifted from HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) to HDL function. We recently demonstrated that low USF1 expression in mice and humans associates with high plasma HDL-C and low triglyceride levels, as well as protection against obesity, insulin resistance, and atherosclerosis. Here, we studied the impact of USF1 deficiency on HDL functional capacity and macrophage atherogenic functions, including inflammation, cholesterol efflux, and cholesterol accumulation.
We used a congenic Usf1 deficient mice in C57Bl/6JRccHsd background and blood samples were collected to isolate HDL for structural and functional studies. Lentiviral preparations containing the USF1 silencing shRNA expression vector were used to silence USF1 in human THP-1 and Huh-7 cells. Cholesterol efflux from acetyl-LDL loaded THP-1 macrophages was measured using HDL and plasma as acceptors. Gene expression analysis from USF1 silenced peritoneal macrophages was carried out using Affymetrix protocols.
We show that Usf1 deficiency not only increases HDL-C levels in vivo, consistent with elevated ABCA1 protein expression in hepatic cell lines, but also improves the functional capacity of HDL particles. HDL particles derived from Usf1 deficient mice remove cholesterol more efficiently from macrophages, attributed to their higher contents of phospholipids. Furthermore, silencing of USF1 in macrophages enhanced the cholesterol efflux capacity of these cells. These findings are consistent with reduced inflammatory burden of USF1 deficient macrophages, manifested by reduced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines MCP-1 and IL-1β and protection against inflammation-induced macrophage cholesterol accumulation in a cell-autonomous manner.
Our findings identify USF1 as a novel factor regulating HDL functionality, showing that USF1 inactivation boosts cholesterol efflux, reduces macrophage inflammation and attenuates macrophage cholesterol accumulation, linking improved macrophage cholesterol metabolism and inflammatory pathways to the antiatherogenic function of USF1 deficiency.
Resistance to fludioxonil in Botrytis cinerea and B. fragariae was previously found to be linked to either overexpression of the drug efflux pump atrB activated by mutations in transcription factor mrr1 or to mutations in the osmoregulation gene os1. In the present study, isolates of B. cinerea, Botrytis group S, or B. fragariae collected from strawberry fields in the United States were resistant to fludioxonil with half-maximal effective concentration values ranging from 0.04 to 0.43 µg/ml for B. cinerea, 0.03 to 1.03 µg/ml for Botrytis group S, and 0.28 to 3.48 µg/ml for B. fragariae. Analyses of mrr1 sequences revealed various mutations linked to fludioxonil resistance in B. cinerea and Botrytis group S isolates. However, no mutations in mrr1 correlated with atrB overexpression-mediated resistance in B. fragariae isolates. Neither nucleotide variations in the 1,370-bp upstream region of atrB nor increased atrB copy numbers could explain the atrB overexpression in these B. fragariae isolates. Mutations in os1 conferred resistance to iprodione in B. cinerea and Botrytis group S isolates; none correlated with resistance to fludioxonil in B. fragariae. In contrast to European isolates, U.S. B. fragariae isolates contained a 3-bp insertion in the coding region of os1. These isolates were more sensitive to osmotic stress but it is unclear whether the insertion is responsible for this phenotype. Our findings suggest that atrB overexpression-associated fludioxonil resistance is an across-species mechanism of resistance to fludioxonil that can be induced by mutations in mrr1 and other, still-unknown mechanisms.
Cervical cancer is the third-most common cause of female cancer-related mortality worldwide. In cervical cancer, aberrant activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling is widely reported. However, the transcriptional regulation of NF-κB signaling remains unclear. The present study aimed to explore the underlying mechanism in which NF-κB signaling was activated in cervical cancer cells. Initially, the expression of p65 was demonstrated to be markedly enhanced in grade II, III or IV cervical cancer tissues compared with that of normal cervical tissues, indicating that p65 expression was correlated with tumor grade. In HeLa and CaSki cells, overexpression of p65 markedly enhanced cervical cancer cell invasion and migration. Further experiments demonstrated that p65 overexpression significantly increased the phosphorylation levels of protein kinase B (AKT) and p38. Dual luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that USF1 was able to bind the promoter region of p65, thereby enhancing the transcriptional activation of p65. Notably, when p65 was silenced, the phosphorylation levels of AKT and p38 were suppressed even in cells transfected with adenovirus vectors expressing upstream transcription factor 1 (USF1). These data indicated that USF1 prompted cervical cancer progression primarily by transcriptionally activating p65. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that USF1 was able to activate the transcription of p65, thereby enhancing the malignancy of cervical cancer cells.
Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (FLI1), an ETS transcription factor family member, acts as an oncogenic driver in hematological malignancies and promotes tumor growth in solid tumors. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the activation of this proto-oncogene in tumors.
Immunohistochemical staining showed that FLI1 is aberrantly overexpressed in advanced stage and metastatic breast cancers. Using a CRISPR Cas9-guided immunoprecipitation assay, we identify a circular RNA in the FLI1 promoter chromatin complex, consisting of FLI1 exons 4-2-3, referred to as FECR1.Overexpression of FECR1 enhances invasiveness of MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells. Notably, FECR1 utilizes a positive feedback mechanism to activate FLI1 by inducing DNA hypomethylation in CpG islands of the promoter. FECR1 binds to the FLI1 promoter in cis and recruits TET1, a demethylase that is actively involved in DNA demethylation. FECR1 also binds to and downregulates in trans DNMT1, a methyltransferase that is essential for the maintenance of DNA methylation.
These data suggest that FECR1 circular RNA acts as an upstream regulator to control breast cancer tumor growth by coordinating the regulation of DNA methylating and demethylating enzymes. Thus, FLI1 drives tumor metastasis not only through the canonical oncoprotein pathway, but also by using epigenetic mechanisms mediated by its exonic circular RNA.
The neural transcription factor SOX11 is usually highly expressed in typical mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), but it is absent in the more indolent form of MCL. Despite being an important diagnostic marker for this hard-to-treat malignancy, the mechanisms of aberrant SOX11 expression are largely unknown. Herein, we describe 2 modes of SOX11 regulation by the cell-cycle regulator cyclin D1 (CCND1) and the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). We found that ectopic expression of CCND1 in multiple human MCL cell lines resulted in increased SOX11 transcription, which correlated with increased acetylated histones H3K9 and H3K14 (H3K9/14Ac). Increased H3K9/14Ac and SOX11 expression was also observed after histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) or HDAC2 was depleted by RNA interference or inhibited by the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat. Mechanistically, we showed that CCND1 interacted with and sequestered HDAC1 and HDAC2 from the SOX11 locus, leading to SOX11 upregulation. Interestingly, our data revealed a potential inverse relationship between phosphorylated Y705 STAT3 and SOX11 expression in MCL cell lines, primary tumors, and patient-derived xenografts. Functionally, inactivation of STAT3 by inhibiting the upstream Janus kinase (JAK) 1 or JAK2 or by STAT3 knockdown was found to increase SOX11 expression, whereas interleukin-21 (IL-21)-induced STAT3 activation or overexpression of the constitutively active form of STAT3 decreased SOX11 expression. In addition, targeting SOX11 directly by RNA interference or indirectly by IL-21 treatment induced toxicity in SOX11+ MCL cells. Collectively, we demonstrate the involvement of CCND1 and STAT3 in the regulation of SOX11 expression, providing new insights and therapeutic implications in MCL.
Acute and chronic exposure to particulate matter (PM) 2.5 is associated with adverse health effect upon the cardiovascular (CV) system. However, the molecular mechanism by which PM2.5 evokes CV injuries has not been fully clarified. In our recent report, we demonstrate that exposure to PM2.5 leads to elevation of circulating angiotensin II (ANGII) levels and local expressions of angiotensinogen (AGT, the precursor of ANGII), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ANGII type 1 receptor (AT1R) in the vascular endothelial cells, which subsequently instigates the oxidative stress and proinflammatory response in the vascular endothelium. In the present study, we disclosed that PM2.5 exposure induced the activation of the transcriptional factor AP-1 and its components, c-Jun and ATF2, in the human vascular endothelial cells. Although the DNA-binding sites for AP-1 were identified within the promoter regions of AGT, ACE and AT1R genes, RT-PCR and immunoblot assays indicated that AP-1 transactivation was only involved in AT1R upregulation, but did not affect the induction of AGT and ACE expression under the same conditions. Furthermore, ERKs and p38K functioned as the upstream protein kinases involving in AP-1 transactivation and AT1R upregulation under PM2.5 stimulation. In addition, the oxidative stress and proinflammatory responses in the PM2.5-treated vascular endothelial cells were significantly reduced when MAPKs and AP-1 activation were inhibited. Therefore, we conclude that PM2.5 exposure induces MAPK/AP-1 cascade activation, which contributes to AT1R upregulation and vascular endothelial dysfunction. Identifying novel therapeutic targets to alleviate AP-1 transactivation and restore AT1R expression may be helpful for the management of PM2.5-induced CV burden.
In our previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) on the piglet splay leg (PSL) syndrome, the homer scaffolding protein 1 (HOMER1) was detected as a candidate gene. The aim of this work was to further verify the candidate gene by sequencing the gene and find the significantly associated mutation. Then we preliminarily analyzed the effect of the significant SNP on intronic promoter activity. This research provided a reference for further investigation of the pathogenesis of PSL.
We investigated the 19 SNPs on HOMER1 and found 12 SNPs significant associated with PSL, including 8 SNPs resided in the potential intronic promoter region in intron 4. The - 663~ - 276 bp upstream the exon 5 had promoter activity and it could be an intronic promoter that regulated the transcription of HOMER1-205 transcript. The promoter activity of the - 663~ - 276 bp containing the rs339135425 and rs325197091 mutant alleles was significantly higher than of the wild type (P &lt; 0.05). The G allele of rs325197091 (A &gt; G) may create a new binding site of transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) and could enhance HOMER1 intronic promoter activity.
HOMER1 gene was associated with the PSL, and the rs325197091 could influence HOMER1 intronic promoter activity in vitro.
Recently, the Swiss breeding association reported an increasing number of white-spotted cattle in the Brown Swiss breed, which is normally solid brown coloured. A total of 60 Brown Swiss cattle with variably sized white abdominal spots, facial markings and depigmented claws were collected for this study. A genome-wide association study using 40k SNP genotypes of 20 cases and 1619 controls enabled us to identify an associated genome region on chromosome 22 containing the MITF gene, encoding the melanogenesis associated transcription factor. Variants at the MITF locus have been reported before to be associated with white or white-spotted phenotypes in other species such as horses, dogs and mice. Whole-genome sequencing of a single white-spotted cow and subsequent genotyping of 172 Brown Swiss cattle revealed two significantly associated completely linked single nucleotide variants (rs722765315 and rs719139527). Both variants are located in the 5'-regulatory region of the bovine MITF gene, and comparative sequence analysis showed that the variant rs722765315, located 139 kb upstream of the transcription start site of the bovine melanocyte-specific MITF transcript, is situated in a multi-species conserved sequence element which is supposed to be regulatory important. Therefore, we hypothesize that rs722765315 represents the most likely causative variant for the white-spotting phenotype observed in Brown Swiss cattle. Presence of the mutant allele in a heterozygous or homozygous state supports a dominant mode of inheritance with incomplete penetrance and results in a variable extent of coat colour depigmentation.
Staphylococcal nuclease domain-containing protein 1 (SND1) has been reported as an oncoprotein in a variety of cancers involving multiple processes, including proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. However, the mechanisms underlying metastasis remain largely unknown. Herein, by using the ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3, which has high metastasis ability, we showed that loss-of-function of SND1 dramatically suppressed the invasion and migration of SKOV3 cells. We then performed gene expression profiles and further verified (by use of quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis) that loss-of-function of SND1 resulted in up-regulation of epithelial markers, such as epithelial cadherin and claudin 1, and down-regulation of mesenchymal markers, including neural cadherin and vimentin. Moreover, we illustrated that SLUG, a key transcription factor implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis, acts as an essential effector of the SND1-promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition process via regulating N-CAD and VIM expression (or E-CAD and CLDN1). The underlying molecular mechanisms illustrated that SND1 regulates the gene transcriptional activation of SLUG by increasing chromatin accessibility through the recruitment of the acetyltransferases GCN5 and CBP/p300 to the SLUG promoter proximal region. Overall, SND1 was identified as a novel upstream regulator of SLUG, which plays important roles in regulating the E-CAD/N-CAD expression switch.-Xin, L., Zhao, R., Lei, J., Song, J., Yu, L., Gao, R., Ha, C., Ren, Y., Liu, X., Liu, Y., Yao, Z., Yang, J. SND1 acts upstream of SLUG to regulate the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in SKOV3 cells.
Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) is a well-known master regulator of hematopoietic lineages but its mechanisms of action are still not fully understood. Here, we found that RUNX1 localizes on active chromatin together with Far Upstream Binding Protein 1 (FUBP1) in human B-cell precursor lymphoblasts, and that both factors interact in the same transcriptional regulatory complex. RUNX1 and FUBP1 chromatin localization identified c-KIT as a common target gene. We characterized two regulatory regions, at +700 bp and +30 kb within the first intron of c-KIT, bound by both RUNX1 and FUBP1, and that present active histone marks. Based on these regions, we proposed a novel FUBP1 FUSE-like DNA-binding sequence on the +30 kb enhancer. We demonstrated that FUBP1 and RUNX1 cooperate for the regulation of the expression of the oncogene c-KIT. Notably, upregulation of c-KIT expression by FUBP1 and RUNX1 promotes cell proliferation and renders cells more resistant to the c-KIT inhibitor imatinib mesylate, a common therapeutic drug. These results reveal a new mechanism of action of RUNX1 that implicates FUBP1, as a facilitator, to trigger transcriptional regulation of c-KIT and to regulate cell proliferation. Deregulation of this regulatory mechanism may explain some oncogenic function of RUNX1 and FUBP1.
Caenorhabditis elegans that hatch in the absence of food stop their postembryonic development in a process called L1 arrest. Intriguingly, we find that the postembryonic Q neuroblasts divide and migrate during L1 arrest in mutants that have lost the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) or the insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) negative regulator DAF-18/PTEN. We report that DBL-1/BMP works upstream of IIS to promote agonistic insulin-like peptides during L1 arrest. However, the abnormal Q cell divisions that occur during L1 arrest use a novel branch of the IIS pathway that is independent of the terminal transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO. Using genetic epistasis and drug interactions we show that AMPK functions downstream of, or in parallel with DAF-18/PTEN and IIS to inhibit PP2A function. Further, we show that PP2A regulates the abnormal Q cell divisions by activating the MPK-1/ERK signaling pathway via LIN-45/RAF, independently of LET-60/RAS. PP2A acts as a tumor suppressor in many oncogenic signaling cascades. Our work demonstrates a new role for PP2A that is needed to induce neuroblast divisions during starvation and is regulated by both insulin and AMPK.
Neuroblastoma derived from primitive sympathetic neural precursors is a common type of solid tumor in infants. MYCN proto‑oncogene bHLH transcription factor (MYCN) amplification and 1p36 deletion are important factors associated with the poor prognosis of neuroblastoma. Expression levels of MYCN and c‑MYB proto‑oncogene transcription factor (c‑myb) decline during the differentiation of neuroblastoma cells; E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) activates the MYCN promoter. However, the underlying mechanism of MYCN overexpression and amplification requires further investigation. In the present study, potential c‑Myb target genes, and the effect of c‑myb RNA interference (RNAi) on MYCN expression and amplification were investigated in MYCN‑amplified neuroblastoma cell lines. The mRNA expression levels and MYCN gene copy number in five neuroblastoma cell lines were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In addition, variations in potential target gene expression and MYCN gene copy number between pre‑ and post‑c‑myb RNAi treatment groups in MYCN‑amplified Kelly, IMR32, SIMA and MHH‑NB‑11 cell lines, normalized to those of non‑MYCN‑amplified SH‑SY5Y, were examined. To determine the associations between gene expression levels and chromosomal aberrations, MYCN amplification and 1p36 alterations in interphases/metaphases were analyzed using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Statistical analyses revealed correlations between 1p36 alterations and the expression of c‑myb, MYB proto‑oncogene like 2 (B‑myb) and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (p21). Additionally, the results of the present study also demonstrated that c‑myb may be associated with E2F1 and L3MBTL1 histone methyl‑lysine binding protein (L3MBTL1) expression, and that E2F1 may contribute to MYCN, B‑myb, p21 and chromatin licensing and DNA replication factor 1 (hCdt1) expression, but to the repression of geminin (GMNN). On c‑myb RNAi treatment, L3MBTL1 expression was silenced, while GMNN was upregulated, indicating G2/M arrest. In addition, MYCN gene copy number increased following treatment with c‑myb RNAi. Notably, the present study also reported a 43.545% sequence identity between upstream of MYCN and Drosophila melanogaster amplification control element 3, suggesting that expression and/or amplification mechanisms of developmentally‑regulated genes may be evolutionarily conserved. In conclusion, c‑myb may be associated with regulating MYCN expression and amplification. c‑myb, B‑myb and p21 may also serve a role against chromosome 1p aberrations. Together, it was concluded that MYCN gene is amplified during S phase, potentially via a replication‑based mechanism.
The aberrant activation of hedgehog (HH) signaling is a leading cause of the development of medulloblastoma, a pediatric tumor of the cerebellum. The FDA‑approved HH inhibitor, Vismodegib, which targets the transmembrane transducer SMO, has shown limited efficacy in patients with medulloblastoma, due to compensatory mechanisms that maintain an active HH‑GLI signaling status. Thus, the identification of novel actionable mechanisms, directly affecting the activity of the HH‑regulated GLI transcription factors is an important goal for these malignancies. In this study, using gene expression and reporter assays, combined with biochemical and cellular analyses, we demonstrate that mitogen‑activated kinase kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1), the most upstream kinase of the mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation modules, suppresses HH signaling by associating and phosphorylating GLI1, the most potent HH‑regulated transcription factor. Phosphorylation occurred at multiple residues in the C‑terminal region of GLI1 and was followed by an increased association with the cytoplasmic proteins 14‑3‑3. Of note, the enforced expression of MEKK1 or the exposure of medulloblastoma cells to the MEKK1 activator, Nocodazole, resulted in a marked inhibitory effect on GLI1 activity and tumor cell proliferation and viability. Taken together, the results of this study shed light on a novel regulatory mechanism of HH signaling, with potentially relevant implications in cancer therapy.
Radiation therapy is used in ~50% of cancer patients to reduce the risk of recurrence and in some cases improve survival. Despite these benefits, doses can be limited by toxicity in multiple organs, including the heart. The underlying causes and biomarkers of radiation-induced cardiotoxicity are currently unknown, prompting the need for experimental models with inherent differences in sensitivity and resistance to the development of radiation-induced cardiotoxicity. We have identified the parental SS (Dahl salt sensitive/Mcwi) rat strain to be a highly-sensitized model of radiation-induced cardiotoxicity. In comparison, substitution of rat chromosome 3 from the resistant BN (Brown Norway) rat strain onto the SS background (SS-3BNconsomic) significantly attenuated radiation-induced cardiotoxicity. SS-3BNrats had less radiation-induced cardiotoxicity than SS rats, as measured by survival, pleural and pericardial effusions, echocardiogram parameters, and histologic damage. Mast cells, previously shown to have predominantly protective roles in radiation-induced cardiotoxicity, were increased in the more resistant SS-3BNhearts post-radiation. RNA sequencing from SS and SS-3BNhearts at 1 week post-radiation revealed 5,098 differentially expressed candidate genes across the transcriptome and 350 differentially expressed genes on rat chromosome 3, which coincided with enrichment of multiple pathways, including mitochondrial dysfunction, sirtuin signaling, and ubiquitination. Upstream regulators of enriched pathways included the oxidative stress modulating transcription factor, Nrf2, which is located on rat chromosome 3. Nrf2 target genes were also differentially expressed in the SS versus SS-3BNconsomic hearts post-radiation. Collectively, these data confirm the existence of heritable modifiers in radiation-induced cardiotoxicity and provide multiple biomarkers, pathways, and candidate genes for future analyses.
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical process implicated in the initial stage of cancer metastasis, which is the major cause of tumor recurrence and mortality. Although key transcription factors that regulate EMT, such as snail family transcriptional repressor 2 (SNAI2), are well characterized, the upstream signaling pathways controlling these transcriptional mediators are largely unknown, which limits therapeutic strategies. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lipid mediator, generated by sphingosine kinases (SPHK1 and SPHK2), that mainly exerts its effects by binding to the following 5 GPCRs: S1P1 to S1P5. S1P signaling has been reported to regulate different aspects of cancer progression including cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration; nevertheless, its role in cancer metastasis, specifically via EMT, is not established. Here we show that SPHK1 expression correlates significantly with EMT score in breast cancer cell lines, and with SNAI2 in patient-derived breast tumors. Cell-based assays demonstrate that S1P can rapidly up-regulate the expression of SNAI2 in breast cancer cells via the activation of cognate receptors S1P2 and S1P3. Knockdown studies suggest that S1P2 and S1P3 mediate this effect by activating myocardin-related transcription factor A (MRTF-A) and yes-associated protein (YAP), respectively. Michigan Cancer Foundation 7 cells stably overexpressing S1P2 or S1P3 exhibit a more invasive phenotype, when compared to control cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that S1P produced by SPHK1 induces SNAI2 expression via S1P2-YAP and S1P3-MRTF-A pathways, leading to enhanced cell invasion. Cumulatively, this study reveals a novel mechanism by which S1P activates parallel pathways that regulate the expression of SNAI2, a master regulator of EMT, and provides new insights into druggable therapeutic targets that may limit cancer metastasis. Wang, W., Hind, T., Lam, B. W. S., Herr, D. R. Sphingosine 1-phosphate signaling induces SNAI2 expression to promote cell invasion in breast cancer cells.
Mitotic bookmarking constitutes a mechanism for transmitting transcriptional patterns through cell division. Bookmarking factors, comprising a subset of transcription factors (TFs), and multiple histone modifications retained in mitotic chromatin facilitate reactivation of transcription in the early G1 phase. However, the specific TFs that act as bookmarking factors remain largely unknown. Previously, we identified the "early G1 genes" and screened TFs that were predicted to bind to the upstream region of these genes, then identified GA-binding protein transcription factor alpha subunit (GABPA) and Sp1 transcription factor (SP1) as candidate bookmarking factors. Here we show that GABPA and multiple histone acetylation marks such as H3K9/14AC, H3K27AC, and H4K5AC are maintained at specific genomic sites in mitosis. During the M/G1 transition, the levels of these histone acetylations at the upstream regions of genes bound by GABPA in mitosis are decreased. Upon depletion of GABPA, levels of histone acetylation, especially H4K5AC, at several gene regions are increased, along with transcriptional induction at 1 h after release. Therefore, we proposed that GABPA cooperates with the states of histone acetylation to act as a novel bookmarking factor which, may negatively regulate transcription during the early G1 phase.
Ketone bodies including β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) have been shown to protect against ischemic tissue injury when present at low concentrations. We evaluated the impact of β-OHB on renal ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). Mice were treated with a continuous infusion of β-OHB using an osmotic mini-pump before and after IRI. We also tested the effects of increasing endogenous serum β-OHB levels by fasting. Renal IRI was attenuated by β-OHB treatment compared to saline control, with similar results in the fasting condition. β-OHB treatment reduced the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells and increased expression of forkhead transcription factor O3 (FOXO3), an upstream regulator of pyroptosis. Although β-OHB treatment did not impact markers of apoptosis, it decreased the expression of caspase-1 and proinflammatory cytokines, indicating that β-OHB blocked pyroptosis. In a human proximal tubular cell line exposed to hypoxia and reoxygenation, β-OHB reduced cell death in a FOXO3-dependent fashion. Histone acetylation was decreased in kidneys exposed to IRI and in proximal tubular cells exposed to hypoxia and reoxygenation, and this effect was ameliorated by β-OHB through the inactivation of histone deacetylases. In vitro, β-OHB treatment restored histone acetylation at the FOXO3 promoter. Consistent with epigenetic molecular effects, the renoprotective effects of β-OHB were still observed when the continuous infusion was stopped at the time of IRI. Thus, β-OHB attenuates renal IRI through anti-pyroptotic effects, likely mediated by an epigenetic effect on FOXO3 expression.
We studied the molecular mechanism of neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1) signaling pathway for tolerance to Ca2+ stress in Neurospora crassa. Increasing concentration of Ca2+ increased the expression of ncs-1; however, the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 severely reduced ncs-1 mRNA transcript levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies revealed that the transcription factor calcineurin responsive zinc finger-1 (CRZ-1) binds to the ncs-1 promoter, and CRZ-1 binding upregulated ncs-1 expression under high Ca2+ concentrations. These results suggested the regulation of NCS-1 function through calcineurin- CRZ-1 signaling pathway. Furthermore, the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) revealed that the CRZ-1 binds specifically to an 8 bp sequence 5'-CCTTCACA-3' in the ncs-1 promoter 216 bp upstream of the ATG start codon. We also showed that NCS-1 binds to the Ca2+ permeable channel MID-1 for tolerance to Ca2+ stress. Therefore, CRZ-1 binds to a unique sequence in the ncs-1 promoter, causing upregulation of NCS-1 that binds to MID-1 for tolerance to Ca2+ stress.
Simvastatin is a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor with multiple targets and effects. It protects neurons in the brain but its protective effects on photoreceptors are unclear. In this study, we evaluated the neuroprotective effect of simvastatin on photoreceptors exposed to stress induced by all-trans-retinal (atRAL).
AlamarBlue and lactate dehydrogenase assays were used to evaluate the viability and metabolic activity of Y79 cells (a retinoblastoma cell line) exposed to atRAL-induced stress with or without simvastatin pre-treatment. Changes in cellular reactive oxygen species were evaluated using flow cytometry and mitochondrial stress markers JC-1 and HSP60. Changes in levels of the photoreceptor-specific markers cone-rod homeobox protein (CRX) and Interphotoreceptor Retinoid Binding Protein (IRBP) were evaluated with Western blotting. The results were validated in ex vivo human retinal explants and a mouse model of photoreceptor degeneration.
Simvastatin improved mitochondrial function, alleviated oxidative stress and upregulated the photoreceptor specific markers IRBP and its upstream regulator CRX in Y79 cells and ex vivo human retinal explants under atRAL-induced stress. Simvastatin attenuated photoreceptor degeneration in association with upregulation of IRBP and CRX expression after knockdown of IRBP in a murine model.
Our findings suggest that simvastatin has a novel role in protecting photoreceptors from atRAL-induced stress. Simvastatin treatment resulted in upregulation of IRBP and its upstream transcription factor CRX in Y79 cells, ex vivo human retinal explants and murine retinas in vivo. Further studies of simvastatin to treat photoreceptor degeneration are warranted.
p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is an attracting pharmacological target in inflammatory diseases and cancer. Searching for new and more efficient p38-MAPK inhibitors, two recently developed pyrazolobenzothiazine-based (COXP4M12 and COXH11) compounds were investigated in this study using a cellular model of p38 activation. This consisted of HT29 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells exposed to H2O2 or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Immunoblot data confirmed the inhibitory effect of COXP4M12 and COXH11 on p38 substrate phosphorylation (MAPK-APK2 and ATF2 transcription factor). Compound cytotoxicity was very low and apparent efficacy of these inhibitors was comparable with that of SB203580, a commercially available type I inhibitor of p38. All these compounds also inhibit upstream kinases that promote p38-MAPK phosphorylation and co-activate the stress-activated protein kinase JNK, while ERK1/2 MAPK phosphorylation was unaffected. Compound-target kinase interaction was investigated by means of co-crystallization experiments that provided further structural and molecular insight on the inhibitory mechanism and optimization strategy of this new class of p38-MAPK inhibitors.
T cells expressing invariant γδ antigen receptors (γδ T cells) bridge innate and adaptive immunity and facilitate barrier responses to pathogens. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an upstream mediator of host defense that up-regulates the expression of pattern recognition receptors and sustains inflammatory responses by inhibiting activation-induced apoptosis in monocytes and macrophages. Surprisingly, Mif-/- γδ T cells, when compared with wild type, were observed to produce &gt;10-fold higher levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-17 after stimulation with gram-positive exotoxins. High-IL-17 expression was associated with the characteristic features of IL-17-producing γδ T (γδ17) cells, including expression of IL-23R, IL-1R1, and the transcription factors RORγt and Sox13. In the gram-positive model of shock mediated by toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST-1), Mif-/- mice succumbed to death more quickly with increased pulmonary neutrophil accumulation and higher production of cytokines, including IL-1β and IL-23. Mif-/- γδ T cells also produced high levels of IL-17 in response to Mycobacterium lipomannan, and depletion of γδ T cells improved survival from acutely lethal Mycobacterium infection or TSST-1 administration. These data indicate that MIF deficiency is associated with a compensatory amplification of γδ17 cell responses, with implications for innate immunity and IL-17-mediated pathology in situations such as gram-positive toxic shock or Mycobacterium infection.-Kim, H. K., Garcia, A. B., Siu, E., Tilstam, P., Das, R., Roberts, S., Leng, L., Bucala, R. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor regulates innate γδ T-cell responses via IL-17 expression.
Endometriosis is recognized as a steroid-dependent disorder; however, the precise roles of nuclear receptors (NRs) in steroid responsiveness and other signaling pathways are not well understood.
Over the past several years, a number of paradigm-shifting breakthroughs have occurred in the area of NRs in endometriosis. We review and clarify new information regarding the mechanisms responsible for: (i) excessive estrogen biosynthesis, (ii) estrogen-dependent inflammation, (iii) defective differentiation due to progesterone resistance and (iv) enhanced survival due to deficient retinoid production and action in endometriosis. We emphasize the roles of the relevant NRs critical for these pathological processes in endometriosis.
We conducted a comprehensive search using PubMed for human, animal and cellular studies published until 2018 in the following areas: endometriosis; the steroid and orphan NRs, estrogen receptors alpha (ESR1) and beta (ESR2), progesterone receptor (PGR), steroidogenic factor-1 (NR5A1) and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II (NR2F2); and retinoids.
Four distinct abnormalities in the intracavitary endometrium and extra-uterine endometriotic tissue underlie endometriosis progression: dysregulated differentiation of endometrial mesenchymal cells, abnormal epigenetic marks, inflammation activated by excess estrogen and the development of progesterone resistance. Endometriotic stromal cells compose the bulk of the lesions and demonstrate widespread epigenetic abnormalities. Endometriotic stromal cells also display a wide range of abnormal NR expression. The orphan NRs NR5A1 and NR2F2 compete to regulate steroid-synthesizing genes in endometriotic stromal cells; NR5A1 dominance gives rise to excessive estrogen formation. Endometriotic stromal cells show an abnormally low ESR1:ESR2 ratio due to excessive levels of ESR2, which mediates an estrogen-driven inflammatory process and prostaglandin formation. These cells are also deficient in PGR, leading to progesterone resistance and defective retinoid synthesis. The pattern of NR expression, involving low ESR1 and PGR and high ESR2, is reminiscent of uterine leiomyoma stem cells. This led us to speculate that endometriotic stromal cells may display stem cell characteristics found in other uterine tissues. The biologic consequences of these abnormalities in endometriotic tissue include intense inflammation, defective differentiation and enhanced survival.
Steroid- and other NR-related abnormalities exert genome-wide biologic effects via interaction with defective epigenetic programming and enhance inflammation in endometriotic stromal cells. New synthetic ligands, targeting PGR, retinoic acid receptors and ESR2, may offer novel treatment options.
After spinal cord injury (SCI), regeneration of adult motor axons such as axons in the corticospinal tract (CST) is severely limited. Alongside the inhibitory lesion environment, most neuronal subtypes in the mature central nervous system (CNS) are intrinsically unrepairable. With age, expression of growth-promoting proteins in neurons, such as integrins, declines. Integrin receptors allow communication between the extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell cytoskeleton and their expression in axons facilitates growth and guidance throughout the ECM. The α9β1 integrin heterodimer binds to tenascin-C (TN-C), an ECM glycoprotein expressed during development and after injury. In the mature CST however, expression of the α9 integrin subunit is downregulated, adding to the intrinsic inability of axons to regenerate. Our previous work has shown the α9 integrin subunit is not trafficked within axons of mature CST or rubrospinal tracts (RSTs). Thus, here we have utilized human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to increase expression of α9 integrinwithin the developing rat CST. We demonstrate that human NPCs (hNPCs) express endogenous levels of both α9 and β1 integrin subunits as well as cortical neuron markers such as chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF) interacting protein 2 (Ctip2) and T-box brain 1 (Tbr1). In addition, lentivirus-mediated α9 integrin overexpression in hNPCs resulted in increased neurite outgrowth in the presence of TN-C in vitro. Following transplantation into the sensorimotor cortex of newborn rats, both wild type (WT) and α9-expressing hNPCs extend along the endogenous CST and retain expression of α9 throughout the length of the axonal compartment for up to 8 weeks following transplantation. These data highlight the growth potential of transplanted human iPSCs which may be a future target for regenerative therapies after nervous system injury.
Human FIX (hFIX) gene transfer into hepatocytes has provided a novel approach for treatment of hemophilia B. To obtain an improved expression of hFIX, the functional hFIX-expressing plasmids with appropriate intron-derived fragments which facilitate transcription and promote an efficient 3'-end formation of mRNAs are required.
We aim to evaluate the functions of the heterologous intron-derived fragments intra and extra hFIX-cDNA coding region with respect to the hFIX expression in the hepatocytes and kidney cells.
HepG2 cells as differentiated hepatocytes and Hek-293T cells as embryonic kidney cells were transfected with the different hFIX-expressing plasmids containing various combinations of the two human beta-globin (hBG) introns within the hFIX-cDNA and Kozak sequence. In the next stage, as a hepatocyte-specific sequence, the rat aldolase B intronic enhancer sequence (rABE), was isolated from the first intron of the rat aldoase B gene and inserted within the upstream CMV promoter (CMVp) and efficacies of the engineered vectors were investigated in the stably-transfected HepG2 cells.
Our data indicate that the intron-less construct and hBG intron-I containing construct are more effective with regard to hFIX expression compared to other constructs in Hek-293 cells. In HepG2 cells, the rABE in combination with CMVp in context of intron-less plasmid induced an increase in total expression of hFIX protein dramatically; ranging from 2.3 to 40 folds increase compared to other constructs. The rABE in combination with CMVp in the hBG intron-I, hBG intron-II, and hBG intron-I,II containing plasmids induced 3.7, 2, and 1.6-fold increase in the total expression of hFIX protein, respectively. The presence of both hBG intronic sequences within the hFIX-cDNA induced a higher secretion level of hFIX than either intron-I or II alone and provided correctly spliced hFIX transcripts in HepG2 and kidney cell lines. The intron-less construct with or without rABE induced the highest hFIX mRNA levels in HepG2 and Hek-293T cells respectively compared to other constructs.
The embryonic kidney cells in addition to the differentiated hepatic cell lines could be successfully targeted by plasmid vectors. The intron-less and hBG intron-I containing plasmids represent a particular interest in producing recombinant hFIX in Hek-293T cells. The synergistic function on the hFIX expression that was achieved by combining the CMVp with the liver-specific rABE would be a useful approach for future designing of the expression cassettes for hepatocyte-mediated gene expression in hemophilia B.
The expression of immune checkpoint proteins such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) has been shown to correlate with patient prognosis in many malignant cancers. The expression of PD-L1 is controlled by c-Myc; however, further upstream regulation of PD-L1 expression is largely unknown. We have previously shown that atypical protein kinase C lambda/iota (aPKCλ) phosphorylates the Forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) transcription factor at Ser218 to suppress its DNA-binding ability, thereby regulating c-Myc expression and controlling physiologic and pathologic endothelial proliferation. The presence of phosphorylation of FoxO1 at Ser218 (pSer218 FoxO1) in cutaneous angiosarcoma (CAS) strongly correlates with poor patient prognosis. Here, we reported that patients with PD-L1+ cells in CAS lesions showed significantly worse prognosis compared to those that were PD-L1- . Expression of PD-L1 correlated with that of aPKCλ or the presence of pSer218FoxO1. Moreover, suppression of aPKCλ expression or inhibition of its activity in HUVECs or AS-M, an established human angiosarcoma cell line, resulted in decreased PD-L1 expression. Our results suggest that combined treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors and aPKCλ inhibitors could be a novel treatment strategy for CAS patients.
Bacteriophage λN protein, a model anti-termination factor, binds nascent RNA and host Nus factors, rendering RNA polymerase resistant to all pause and termination signals. A 3.7-Å-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure and structure-informed functional analyses reveal a multi-pronged strategy by which the intrinsically unstructured λN directly modifies RNA polymerase interactions with the nucleic acids and subverts essential functions of NusA, NusE, and NusG to reprogram the transcriptional apparatus. λN repositions NusA and remodels the β subunit flap tip, which likely precludes folding of pause or termination RNA hairpins in the exit tunnel and disrupts termination-supporting interactions of the α subunit C-terminal domains. λN invades and traverses the RNA polymerase hybrid cavity, likely stabilizing the hybrid and impeding pause- or termination-related conformational changes of polymerase. λN also lines upstream DNA, seemingly reinforcing anti-backtracking and anti-swiveling by NusG. Moreover, λN-repositioned NusA and NusE sequester the NusG C-terminal domain, counteracting ρ-dependent termination. Other anti-terminators likely utilize similar mechanisms to enable processive transcription.
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an embryonic program that is reactivated in cancer and regulates the invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. Zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) induces EMT by upregulating matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), yet MMP genes lack ZEB2 binding motif in their promoters. Recently, expression of MMPs was associated to the activation of ETS1 transcription factor; however, a link between ZEB2 and ETS proto-oncogene 1, transcription factor (ETS1) remains to be elucidated. Hence, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of ETS1 by ZEB2 after our initial observation that ZEB2 and ETS1 are coexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HCCs). Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays clearly showed that ZEB2 binds to E-box sequences on the promoter of ETS1. Elevated expression of ETS1 was found in DLD-ZEB2 and A431-ZEB2 inducible systems, and knockdown of ZEB2 caused an explicit downregulation of ETS1 in shZEB2-SNU398 and shZEB2-SK-HEP-1 cells. Repression of ETS1 expression in ZEB2-induced conditions substantially impaired the migration and invasive capacities of DLD1 cells. Mechanistically, knockdown of ETS1 in ZEB2-expressing cells resulted in the downregulation of established ZEB2 targets TWIST and MMP9. Correlation analyses in HCC lines, cancer complementary DNA arrays, and The Cancer Genome Atlas RNA-sequencing data set revealed that ZEB2 and ETS1 are coexpressed, and their expressions in human tumors show a highly significant positive correlation. Our results demonstrated that ZEB2 acts as an upstream regulator of ETS1 and, in turn, ETS1 maintains ZEB2-induced EMT. These findings add another level of complexity to the understanding of ZEB2 in the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells, and put ZEB2/ETS1 axis as a novel therapeutic target in human malignancies.
High metabolic activity, reflected in increased glucose uptake, is one of the hallmarks of many cancers including breast cancer. However, not all cancers avidly take up glucose, suggesting heterogeneity in their metabolic demand. Thus, we aim to generate a genomic signature of glucose hypermetabolism in breast cancer and examine its clinical relevance. To identify genes significantly associated with glucose uptake, gene expression data were analyzed together with the standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of 18F-fluorodeoxy-glucose on positron emission tomography (PET) for 11 breast cancers. The resulting PET signature was evaluated for prognostic significance in four large independent patient cohorts (n = 5417). Potential upstream regulators accountable for the high glucose uptake were identified by gene network analysis. A PET signature of 242 genes was significantly correlated with SUVmax in breast cancer. In all four cohorts, high PET signature was significantly associated with poorer prognosis. The prognostic value of this PET signature was further supported by Cox regression analyses (hazard ratio 1.7, confidential interval 1.48-2.02; P &lt; 0.001). The PET signature was also strongly correlated with previously established prognostic genomic signatures such as PAM50, Oncotype DX, and NKI. Gene network analyses suggested that MYC and TBX2 were the most significant upstream transcription factors in the breast cancers with high glucose uptake. A PET signature reflecting high glucose uptake is a novel independent prognostic factor in breast cancer. MYC and TBX2 are potential regulators of glucose uptake.
Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of a large cohort of subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have successfully identified multiple risk genes, including fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF7). However, the underlying molecular mechanism influencing function of FGF7 and risk of COPD remains further study.
In this study, we replicated the genetic association of variants near the FGF7 gene in 258 Chinese Han patients with COPD and 311 healthy controls. Additionally, we functionally evaluated a candidate causal variant upstream of the FGF7 gene.
The most significant association was observed at rs12905203 (P = 5.9 × 10- 3, odd ratio, OR = 1.516) that explains associations of previously reported variants at the FGF7 locus. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (ChIP-qPCR) assays showed that the risk allele of the variant was bound to activator protein 1 transcription factors (c-Fos and c-Jun) with a significantly reduced affinity and associated with decreased mRNA expression of FGF7 in fibroblast cells at both resting and PMA/Ionomycin-stimulated conditions. Overexpression of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins or stimulation with PMA/Ionomycin significantly increases mRNA expression of FGF7 in fibroblast cells. Bioinformatic analysis showed that the variant overlaps with multiple genetic regulatory marks, suggesting the regulatory DNA element might function as an enhancer for the FGF7 gene. Luciferase enhancer activity assays demonstrated that the DNA sequences carrying the variant produce enhancer activity while the risk allele of the variant reduces its activity.
In this study, we demonstrated a consistent association of the FGF7 gene with COPD and mechanistically characterized a candidate functional variant upstream of the FGF7 gene. These data highlighted the important role of the risk variant and the FGF7 gene in influencing risk for COPD.
This study aims to investigate the responsiveness of transcription factor TEA domain family member 1 (TEAD1) to mechanical force and its impact on osteoclastogenesis as well as expression of Osteoprotegerin (OPG), an inhibitor for osteoclastogenesis playing crucial roles in mechanical stress-induced bone remodeling and orthodontic tooth movement (OTM).
We first analyzed the correlation between several transcription factors and OPG expression in human periodontal ligament cells (PDLCs). Then dynamic expression changes of TEAD1 with force application were analyzed due to its high correlation with OPG. Loss-of-function experiments were performed to demonstrate the role of TEAD1 in regulation of RANKL/OPG, as well as osteoclastogenesis by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. Combination of bioinformatics analyzes and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was utilized to investigate occupancy of TEAD1 on the enhancer elements of OPG and the dynamic change in response to force stimuli. Involvement of Hippo signaling in regulation of OPG was further demonstrated by pharmacologic inhibitors of several components.
Expression of TEAD1 highly correlates with that of OPG and decreases in response to mechanical force in human PDLCs. Knockdown of TEAD1 downregulates expression of OPG and promotes osteoclast differentiation. Mechanical force induced decreased binding of TEAD1 on an enhancer element ˜22 kilobases upstream of OPG promoter. OPG was also affected by pharmaceutical disruption of Hippo signaling pathway.
TEAD1 is a novel mechano-responsive gene and plays an important role in force-induced osteoclastogenesis, which is dependent, as least partially, on transcriptional regulation of OPG.
Plant growth requires optimal levels of iron (Fe). Fe is used for energy production, numerous enzymatic processes, and is indispensable for cellular metabolism. Recent studies have established the mechanism involved in Fe uptake and transport. However, our knowledge of Fe sensing and signaling is limited. Dissecting Fe signaling may be useful for crop improvement by Fe fortification. Here, we report two small-molecules, R3 and R6 [where R denotes repressor of IRON-REGULATED TRANSPORTER 1 (IRT1)], identified through a chemical screening, whose use blocked activation of the Fe-deficiency response in Arabidopsis thaliana. Physiological analysis of plants treated with R3 and R6 showed that these small molecules drastically attenuated the plant response to Fe starvation. Small-molecule treatment caused severe chlorosis and strongly reduced chlorophyll levels in plants. Fe content in shoots was decreased considerably by small-molecule treatments especially in Fe deficiency. Small-molecule treatments attenuated the Fe-deficiency-induced expression of the Fe uptake gene IRT1. Analysis of FER-LIKE IRON-DEFICIENCY-INDUCED TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR (FIT) and subgroup Ib basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) gene (bHLH38/39/100/101) expression showed that R3 affects the FIT-network, whereas R6 affects both the FIT and Ib bHLH networks. An assessment of the effects of the structural analogs of R3 and R6 on the induction of Fe-dependent chlorosis revealed the functional motif of the investigated chemicals. Our findings suggest that small-molecules selectively modulate the distinct signaling routes that operate in response to Fe-deficiency. R3 and R6 likely interrupt the activity of key upstream signaling regulators whose activities are required for the activation of the Fe-starvation transcriptional cascade in Arabidopsis roots.
A prerequisite for lifelong sperm production is that spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) balance self-renewal and differentiation, yet factors required for this balance remain largely undefined. Using mouse genetics, we now demonstrate that the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor upstream stimulatory factor (USF)1 is critical for the maintenance of SSCs. We show that USF1 is not only detected in Sertoli cells as previously reported, but also in SSCs. Usf1-deficient mice display progressive spermatogenic decline as a result of age-dependent loss of SSCs. According to our data, the germ cell defect in Usf1-/- mice cannot be attributed to impairment of Sertoli cell development, maturation, or function, but instead is likely due to an inability of SSCs to maintain a quiescent state. SSCs of Usf1-/- mice undergo continuous proliferation, which provides an explanation for their age-dependent depletion. The proliferation-coupled exhaustion of SSCs in turn results in progressive degeneration of the seminiferous epithelium, gradual decrease in sperm production, and testicular atrophy. We conclude that the general transcription factor USF1 is indispensable for the proper maintenance of mammalian spermatogenesis.
The anti-angiogenic treatment of malignant glioma cells is an effective method to treat high-grade gliomas. However, due to the presence of vasculogenic mimicry (VM), the anti-angiogenic treatment of gliomas is not significantly effective in improving overall patient median survival. Therefore, this study investigated the mechanism of mimic formation of angiogenesis in gliomas. The results of this experiment indicate that the expression of upstream transcription factor 1 (USF1) is upregulated in glioma tissues and cells. USF1 knockdown inhibits the proliferation, migration, invasion, VM, and expression of VM-associated proteins in glioma cells by stimulating SNHG16 and linc00667. These two long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate ALHD1A1 through the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) mechanism influencing the VM of glioma. This study is the first to demonstrate that the USF1/SNHG16/miR-212-3p/ALDH1A1 (aldehyde dehydrogenase-1) and USF1/linc00667/miR-429/ALDH1A1 axis regulates the VM of glioma cells, and these findings might provide a novel strategy for glioma treatment.
Gene regulatory networks control the complex programs that drive development. Deciphering the connections between transcription factors (TFs) and target genes is challenging, in part because TFs bind to thousands of places in the genome but control expression through a subset of these binding events. We hypothesize that we can combine natural variation of expression levels and predictions of TF binding sites to identify TF targets. We gather RNA-seq data from 71 genetically distinct F1 Drosophila melanogaster embryos and calculate the correlations between TF and potential target genes' expression levels, which we call "regulatory strength." To separate direct and indirect TF targets, we hypothesize that direct TF targets will have a preponderance of binding sites in their upstream regions. Using 14 TFs active during embryogenesis, we find that 12 TFs showed a significant correlation between their binding strength and regulatory strength on downstream targets, and 10 TFs showed a significant correlation between the number of binding sites and the regulatory effect on target genes. The general roles, e.g. bicoid's role as an activator, and the particular interactions we observed between our TFs, e.g. twist's role as a repressor of sloppy paired and odd paired, generally coincide with the literature.
Three proteasome inhibitors have garnered regulatory approvals in various multiple myeloma settings; but drug resistance is an emerging challenge, prompting interest in blocking upstream components of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. One such attractive target is the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme (UAE); we therefore evaluated the activity of TAK-243, a novel and specific UAE inhibitor. TAK-243 potently suppressed myeloma cell line growth, induced apoptosis, and activated caspases while decreasing the abundance of ubiquitin-protein conjugates. This was accompanied by stabilization of many short-lived proteins, including p53, myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1), and c-MYC, and activation of the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF-6), inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE-1), and protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) kinase (PERK) arms of the ER stress response pathway, as well as oxidative stress. UAE inhibition showed comparable activity against otherwise isogenic cell lines with wild-type (WT) or deleted p53 despite induction of TP53 signaling in WT cells. Notably, TAK-243 overcame resistance to conventional drugs and novel agents in cell-line models, including bortezomib and carfilzomib resistance, and showed activity against primary cells from relapsed/refractory myeloma patients. In addition, TAK-243 showed strong synergy with a number of antimyeloma agents, including doxorubicin, melphalan, and panobinostat as measured by low combination indices. Finally, TAK-243 was active against a number of in vivo myeloma models in association with activation of ER stress. Taken together, the data support the conclusion that UAE inhibition could be an attractive strategy to move forward to the clinic for patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma.
IL-22 is a cytokine that plays a pivotal role in regulating tissue homeostasis at barrier surfaces and is produced by activated CD4+ Th cells. Currently, the molecular mechanisms regulating Il22 gene expression are still unclear. In this study, we have identified a crucial cis-regulatory element located 32 kb upstream of the mouse Il22 promoter, termed conserved noncoding sequence (CNS)-32. We demonstrated that CNS-32 acts as an enhancer in reporter assays and contains binding motifs for Runt-related transcription factor (Runx)1 and retinoic acid-related orphan receptor γt (RORγt). Mutation of these motifs significantly abrogated the reporter activity, suggesting a role for both factors in the control of enhancer-mediated Il22 expression. Runx1 and RORγt occupancy and elevated histone H4 acetylation at CNS-32 were evident, as naive T cells differentiated into IL-22-producing Th22 cells. Overexpression of Runx1 promoted IL-22 production by inducing RORγt and IL-23 receptor, all critical to Th22 cell induction. Although Runx1 alone enhanced IL-22 production in Th22 cells, it was further enhanced in the presence of RORγt. Conversely, short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of core-binding factor β, a cofactor essential for Runx1 activity, was effective in limiting IL-22 production. Collectively, our results suggest that IL-22 production is controlled by a regulatory circuit in which Runx1 induces RORγt and then partners with RORγt to direct Il22 expression through their targeting of the Il22 enhancer.
Osteoporosis results from the imbalance between osteogenesis and bone resorption mediated by osteoblasts and osteoclasts. During the disease process of osteoporosis, the alteration of gene expression occurs, which lead to the disease progression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been previously demonstrated to be modulators for bone metabolism via regulation of osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation. In the present study, we detected the expression levels of five osteoporosis-related miRNAs in bone and serum samples of patient with or without osteoporosis. The downstream molecular mechanism of miR-363-3p was analyzed and detected by using bioinformatics analysis and mechanism experiment. The upstream transcription factor of miR-363-3p was analyzed by applying bioinformatics analysis and ChIP assay and luciferase reporter assay. The role of this pathway in osteoclastogenesis was demonstrated by functional assays. MiR-363-3p was significantly highly expressed in osteoporotic samples. Mechanistically, miR-363-3p promotes osteoclastogenesis and inhibits osteogenic differentiation by targeting PTEN and therefore activating PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. MiR-363-3p was activated by its upstream transcription activator MYB. This study revealed that MYB-induced upregulation of miR-363-3p regulates osteoporosis pathogenesis via PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
TEAD1 (TEA domain transcription factor 1), a transcription factor known for the functional output of Hippo signaling, is important for tumorigenesis. However, the role of TEAD1 in the development of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) is unknown. To investigate cell-specific role of Tead1, we generated cardiomyocyte (CMC) and VSMC-specific Tead1 knockout mice. We found CMC/VSMC-specific deletion of Tead1 led to embryonic lethality by E14.5 in mice due to hypoplastic cardiac and vascular walls, as a result of impaired CMC and VSMC proliferation. Whole transcriptome analysis revealed that deletion of Tead1 in CMCs/VSMCs downregulated expression of muscle contractile genes and key transcription factors including Pitx2c and myocardin. In vitro studies demonstrated that PITX2c and myocardin rescued TEAD1-dependent defects in VSMC differentiation. We further identified Pitx2c as a novel transcriptional target of TEAD1, and PITX2c exhibited functional synergy with myocardin by directly interacting with myocardin, leading to augment the differentiation of VSMC. In summary, our study reveals a critical role of Tead1 in cardiovascular development in mice, but also identifies a novel regulatory mechanism, whereby Tead1 functions upstream of the genetic regulatory hierarchy for establishing smooth muscle contractile phenotype.
Primordial follicles, consisting of granulosa cell (GC)-enveloped oocytes are maintained in a state of developmental arrest until activated to grow. The mechanism that operates to maintain this arrested state in GCs is currently unknown. Here, we show the TGFβ-activated transcription factor SMAD3 is expressed in primordial GC nuclei alongside the cell cycle proteins, cyclin D2 (CCND2) and P27. Using neonatal C57/Bl6 mouse ovaries densely populated with primordial follicles, CCND2 protein co-localised and was detected in complex with P27 by immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation, respectively. In the same tissue, SMAD3 co-precipitated with DNA sequences upstream of Ccnd2 and Myc transcription start sites implicating both as direct SMAD3 targets. In older ovaries follicle growth was associated with nuclear exclusion of SMAD3 and reduced P27 and CCND2 in GCs, alongside elevated Myc expression. Brief (2 H) exposure of neonatal ovaries to TGFβ1 (10 ng/ml) in vitro led to immediate dissociation of SMAD3 from the Ccnd2 and Myc promoters. This coincided with elevated Myc and phospho-S6, an indicator of mTOR signalling, followed by a small increase in mean primordial GC number after 48 H. These findings highlight a concentration-dependent role for TGFβ signalling in the maintenance and activation of primordial follicles, through SMAD-dependent and independent signalling pathways, respectively.
A switch from autophagy to apoptosis is implicated in chondrocytes during the osteoarthritis (OA) progression with currently unknown mechanism(s). In this study we utilized a flow fluid shear stress (FFSS) model in cultured chondrocytes and a unilateral anterior crossbite (UAC) animal model. We found that both FFSS and UAC actively induced endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) in the temporomandibular joints (TMJ) chondrocytes, as demonstrated by dramatic increases in expression of HSPA5, p-EIF2AK3, p-ERN1 and ATF6. Interestingly, both FFSS and UAC activated not only pro-death p-EIF2AK3-mediated ERS-apoptosis programs but also pro-survival p-ERN1-mediated autophagic flux in chondrocytes. Data from FFSS demonstrated that MTORC1, a downstream of p-ERN1, suppressed autophagy but promoted p-EIF2AK3 mediated ERS-apoptosis. Data from UAC model demonstrated that at early stage both the p-ERN1 and p-EIF2AK3 were activated and MTORC1 was inhibited in TMJ chondrocytes. At late stage, MTORC1-p-EIF2AK3-mediated ERS apoptosis were predominant, while p-ERN1 and autophagic flux were inhibited. Inhibition of MTORC1 by TMJ local injection of rapamycin in rats or inducible ablation of MTORC1 expression selectively in chondrocytes in mice promoted chondrocyte autophagy and suppressed apoptosis, and reduced TMJ cartilage loss induced by UAC. In contrast, MTORC1 activation by TMJ local administration of MHY1485 or genetic deletion of Tsc1, an upstream MTORC1 suppressor, resulted in opposite effects. Collectively, our results establish that aberrant mechanical loading causes cartilage degeneration by activating, at least in part, the MTORC1 signaling which modulates the autophagy and apoptosis programs in TMJ chondrocytes. Thus, inhibition of MTORC1 provides a novel therapeutic strategy for prevention and treatment of OA.

Earlier, we reported that chronic cadmium (Cd)-exposure to prostate epithelial (RWPE-1) cells causes defective autophagy, which leads to the transformation of a malignant phenotype in both in vitro and in vivo models. However, the upstream events responsible for defective autophagy are yet to be delineated. The present study suggests that chronic Cd exposure induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that triggers the phosphorylation of stress transducers [protein kinase R-like ER Kinase- (PERK), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha- (eIF2-α) and Activating Transcription Factor 4 -(ATF-4)], resulting in defective autophagy that protects Cd-exposed RWPE-1 cells. On the other hand, inhibition of the ATF4 stress inducer by siRNA blocked the Cd-induced defective autophagy in transforming cells. While dissecting the upstream activators of ER stress, we found that increased expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is responsible for ER stress in Cd-exposed RWPE-1 cells. Overexpression of antioxidants (SOD1/SOD2) mitigates Cd-induced ROS that results in inhibition of ER stress and autophagy in prostate epithelial cells. These results suggest that the induction of ROS and subsequent ER stress are responsible for defective autophagy in Cd-induced transformation in prostate epithelial cells.
Mounting evidence suggests the vital roles of long noncoding RNA (lncRNAs) in the glioma. However, the role of LINC00511 in gliomagenesis is still uncovered. Here, in this study, we aim to investigate the effects of LINC00511 on the glioma cancer phenotype and its deepgoing mechanism. Results indicated that LINC00511 was up-regulated in glioma tissues and cell lines, moreover its overexpression positively correlated with the poor prognosis and advanced pathological stages. For the upstream regulation, LINC00511 was epigenetically up-regulated by transcription factor specificity protein 1 (SP1). Gain and loss of functional experiments demonstrated that LINC00511 promoted the proliferation and invasion of glioma cells in vitro. The knockdown of LINC00511 repressed the tumour growth in vivo. Mechanistically, LINC00511 positively regulated the CCND2 expression via competitively sponging with miR-124-3p. Overall, our finding illuminates that LINC00511 is induced by SP1 and accelerates the glioma progression through targeting miR-124-3p/CCND2 axis, constructing the SP1/LINC00511/miR-124-3p/CCND2 axis.
The roles of histone demethylation in the regulation of plant flowering, disease resistance, rhythmical response, and seed germination have been elucidated recently; however, how histone demethylation affects leaf senescence remains largely unclear. In this study, we exploited yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) to screen for the upstream regulators of NONYELLOWING1 (NYE1), and identified RELATIVE OF EARLY FLOWERING6 (REF6), a histone H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3) demethylase, as a putative binding protein of NYE1 promoter. By in vivo and in vitro analyses, we demonstrated that REF6 directly binds to the motif CTCGYTY in NYE1/2 promoters through its zinc finger domain and positively regulates their expression. Loss-of-function of REF6 delayed chlorophyll (Chl) degradation, whereas overexpression of REF6 accelerated Chl degradation. Subsequently, we revealed that REF6 positively regulates the general senescence process by directly up-regulating ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 2 (EIN2), ORESARA1 (ORE1), NAC-LIKE, ACTIVATED BY AP3/PI (NAP), PYRUVATE ORTHOPHOSPHATE DIKINASE (PPDK), PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT 4 (PAD4), LIPOXYGENASE 1 (LOX1), NAC DOMAIN CONTAINING PROTEIN 3 (AtNAC3), and NAC TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR-LIKE 9 (NTL9), the key regulatory and functional genes predominantly involved in the regulation of developmental leaf senescence. Importantly, loss-of-function of REF6 increased H3K27me3 levels at all the target Senescence associated genes (SAGs). We therefore conclusively demonstrate that H3K27me3 methylation represents an epigenetic mechanism prohibiting the premature transcriptional activation of key developmentally up-regulated senescence regulatory as well as functional genes in Arabidopsis.
Increasing evidence suggests that cancer cells highjack developmental programs for disease initiation and progression. Melanoma arises from melanocytes that originate during development from neural crest stem cells (NCSCs). Here, we identified the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (Yy1) as an NCSCs regulator. Conditional deletion of Yy1 in NCSCs resulted in stage-dependent hypoplasia of all major neural crest derivatives due to decreased proliferation and increased cell death. Moreover, conditional ablation of one Yy1 allele in a melanoma mouse model prevented tumorigenesis, indicating a particular susceptibility of melanoma cells to reduced Yy1 levels. Combined RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq, and untargeted metabolomics demonstrated that YY1 governs multiple metabolic pathways and protein synthesis in both NCSCs and melanoma. In addition to directly regulating a metabolic gene set, YY1 can act upstream of MITF/c-MYC as part of a gene regulatory network controlling metabolism. Thus, both NCSC development and melanoma formation depend on an intricate YY1-controlled metabolic program.
Mechanical strain plays a crucial role in bone formation and remodeling. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and TWIST are upstream of master regulators of osteogenesis, including runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). This study investigated the effect of the HIF-1α-TWIST pathway on cyclic mechanical stretch-induced osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and the underlying mechanism.
BMSCs were isolated from bone marrow derived from the femurs and humeri of Sprague-Dawley rats. Osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs was induced by applying cyclic mechanical stretch using the Flexcell Tension System. HIF-1α and TWIST were knocked down using recombinant lentiviral vectors. Osteogenic differentiation was evaluated by real-time qPCR, western blotting, and the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assay.
Cyclic mechanical stretch increased ALP activity and expression of HIF-1α and TWIST in BMSCs. Knockdown of HIF-1α decreased TWIST expression in stretched BMSCs. Moreover, knockdown of HIF-1α or TWIST enhanced cyclic mechanical stretch-induced osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. In addition, knockdown of TWIST increased expression of RUNX2 and BMP2 in stretched BMSCs.
The HIF-1α-TWIST signaling pathway inhibits cyclic mechanical stretch-induced osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. This finding may facilitate cell and tissue engineering for clinical applications.
In previous studies, we demonstrated that some sites in the first intron likely regulate gene expression. In the present work, we sought to further confirm the functional relevance of first intron sites by estimating the quantity of rare alleles in the first intron. A basic hypothesis posited herein is that genomic regions carrying more functionally important sites will have a higher proportion of rare alleles. We estimated the proportions of rare single nucleotide polymorphisms with a minor allele frequency &lt; 0.01 located in several histone marks in the first introns of various genes, and compared them with those in other introns and those in 2-kb upstream regions. As expected, rare alleles were found to be significantly enriched in most of the regulatory sites located in the first introns. Meanwhile, transcription factor binding sites were significantly more enriched in the 2-kb upstream regions (i.e., the regions of putative promoters of genes) than in the first introns. These results strongly support our proposal that the first intron sites of genes may have important regulatory functions in gene expression independent of promoters.
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is thought to activate autophagy via unfolded protein response (UPR)-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of autophagy machinery components, and modulation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3). The upstream UPR constituents pancreatic EIF2-α kinase (PERK) and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) have been reported to mediate these effects, suggesting that UPR may stimulate autophagy via PERK and IRE1. However, how the UPR and its components affect autophagic activity has not been thoroughly examined. By analyzing the flux of LC3 through the autophagic pathway, as well as the sequestration and degradation of autophagic cargo, we here conclusively show that the classical ER stressor tunicamycin (TM) enhances autophagic activity in mammalian cells. PERK and its downstream factor, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), were crucial for this induction, but surprisingly, IRE1 constitutively suppressed autophagic activity. TM-induced autophagy required autophagy related 13 (ATG13), Unc-51-like autophagy-activating kinases 1/2 (ULK1/ULK2), and GABA type A receptor-associated proteins (GABARAPs), but interestingly, LC3 proteins appeared to be redundant. Strikingly, ATF4 was activated independently of PERK in both LNCaP and HeLa cells, and our further examination revealed that ATF4 and PERK regulated autophagy through separate mechanisms. Specifically, whereas ATF4 controlled transcription and was essential for autophagosome formation, PERK acted in a transcription-independent manner and was required at a post-sequestration step in the autophagic pathway. In conclusion, our results indicate that TM-induced UPR activates functional autophagy, and whereas IRE1 is a negative regulator, PERK and ATF4 are required at distinct steps in the autophagic pathway.

                     Hepatic fibrosis results from chronic liver injury and inflammatory responses. Sestrin 2 (Sesn2), an evolutionarily conserved antioxidant enzyme, reduces the severities of acute hepatitis and metabolic liver diseases. However, the role of Sesn2 in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis remains obscure. Here, we used cultured hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and chronic carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and bile duct ligation (BDL) murine models to investigate the effects of Sesn2 on fibrogenesis. 
                        Results:
                     Sesn2 protein and mRNA levels were upregulated in activated primary HSCs, and by increasing transcription, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) also increased Sesn2 expression in HSCs. Furthermore, Smad activation was primarily initiated by TGF-β signaling, and Smad3 activation increased Sesn2 luciferase activity. In silico analysis of the 5' upstream region of the Sesn2 gene revealed a putative Smad-binding element (SBE), and its deletion demonstrated that the SBE between -964 and -956 bp within human Sesn2 promoter was critically required for TGF-β-mediated response. Moreover, ectopic expression of Sesn2 reduced gene expressions associated with HSC activation, and this was accompanied by marked decreases in SBE luciferase activity and Smad phosphorylation. Infection of recombinant adenovirus Sesn2 reduced hepatic injury severity, as evidenced by reductions in CCl4- or BDL-induced alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, and inhibited collagen accumulation. Furthermore, HSC-specific lentiviral delivery of Sesn2 prevented CCl4-induced liver fibrosis. Finally, Sesn2 expression was downregulated in the livers of patients with liver cirrhosis and in mouse models of hepatic fibrosis. 
                        Innovation and Conclusion:
                     Our findings suggest that Sesn2 has the potential to inhibit HSC activation and hepatic fibrosis. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 00, 000-000.
During infection, transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) is essential for the control of host defense. Here we show that the microtubule-associated guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)-H1, is required for the phosphorylation of IRF5 by microbial muramyl-dipeptides (MDP), the minimal structural motif of peptidoglycan of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Specifically, GEF-H1 functions in a microtubule based recognition system for microbial peptidoglycans that mediates the activation of IKKε which we identify as a new upstream IKKα/β and IRF5 kinase. The deletion of GEF-H1 or dominant-negative variants of GEF-H1 prevent activation of IKKε and phosphorylation of IRF5. The GEF-H1-IKKε-IRF5 signaling axis functions independent of NOD-like receptors and is critically required for the recognition of intracellular peptidoglycans and host defenses against Listeria monocytogenes.
Compartmentation of photosynthetic reactions between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells is a key feature of C4 photosynthesis and depends on the cell-specific accumulation of major C4 enzymes, such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 1. The ZmPEPC1 upstream region, which drives light-inducible and mesophyll-specific gene expression in maize, has been shown to keep the same properties when introduced into rice (C3 plant), indicating that rice has the transcription factors needed to confer C4 -like gene expression. Using a yeast one-hybrid approach, we identified OsbHLH112, a rice basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) transcription factor that interacts with the maize ZmPEPC1 upstream region. Moreover, we found that maize OsbHLH112 homologues, ZmbHLH80 and ZmbHLH90, also interact with the ZmPEPC1 upstream region, suggesting that these C4 regulators were co-opted from C3 plants. A transactivation assay in maize mesophyll protoplasts revealed that ZmbHLH80 represses, whereas ZmbHLH90 activates, ZmPEPC1 expression. In addition, ZmbHLH80 was shown to impair the ZmPEPC1 promoter activation caused by ZmbHLH90. We showed that ZmbHLH80 and ZmbHLH90 bind to the same cis-element within the ZmPEPC1 upstream region either as homodimers or heterodimers. The formation of homo and heterodimers with higher oligomeric forms promoted by ZmbHLH80 may explain its negative effect on gene transcription. Gene expression analysis revealed that ZmbHLH80 is preferentially expressed in bundle sheath cells, whereas ZmbHLH90 does not show a clear cell-specific expression pattern. Altogether, our results led us to propose a model in which ZmbHLH80 contributes to mesophyll-specific ZmPEPC1 gene expression by impairing ZmbHLH90-mediated ZmPEPC1 activation in the bundle sheath cells.

Background: As a T-cell mediated disease, multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis might be associated with the immune system and its involved genes. TBX21, which encodes T-bet transcription factor, is a critical regulator of the commitment to the Th1 lineage and Interferon gamma (IFNγ) production. Investigation of the association of -1514T &gt; C polymorphism located upstream of TBX21 gene with MS susceptibility is reasonable due to its demonstrated significant association with some other immune-mediated diseases. Methods: We analyzed the genotype frequencies of -1514T &gt; C polymorphism between 248 Iranian patients with MS and 163 matched healthy controls. By applying polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP)- technique, the single-strand conformation patterns of the amplicons were compared and sequenced. Results: Strong association between the wild -1514T allele and MS susceptibility was found with the allelic frequency of 99.6% in patients vs. 95.1% in controls (P = 0.002), and the CC genotype frequency of the TBX21 polymorphism (-1514T &gt; C) reported potential protective effect against the disease (P = 0.014). Conclusion: The TBX21-1514T &gt; C polymorphism confers possible protective effect on MS in Iranian population. Further comprehensive studies in different settings are required to clarify the exact role of TBX21 gene in MS disease.
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most malignant form of brain tumor posing a major threat to cancer amelioration. Temozolomide (TMZ) resistance is one of the major hurdles towards GBM prognosis. Oxidative stress and ECM remodeling are the two important processes involved in gaining chemo-resistance. Here, we established NFE2L2, an important member of oxidative stress regulation elevated in resistant cells, to be playing a transcriptional regulatory role on MMP-2, an ECM remodeling marker. This link led us to further explore targeted molecules to inhibit NFE2L2, thus affecting MMP-2, an important member promoting chemo-resistance. Thus, diosgenin was proposed as a novel NFE2L2 inhibitor acting as an alternative strategy to prevent the high dose administration of TMZ. Combinatorial therapy of diosgenin and TMZ significantly reduced the dosage regimen of TMZ and also showed affectivity in hitherto TMZ resistant GBM cells. GBM cells underwent apoptosis and early cell cycle arrest with significant reduction in MMP-2 levels. Thus preclinical validation of molecular interaction between diosgenin and NFE2L2 down-regulating MMP-2, EMT markers and promoting apoptosis, offers rationale for new therapeutic horizons in the field of glioblastoma management.
Methylmercury is an environmental pollutant that causes specific and serious damage to the central nervous system. We have previously shown that C-C motif chemokine ligand 4 (CCL4) protects cultured neural cells from methylmercury toxicity and expression of CCL4 is specifically induced in mouse brain by methylmercury. In this study, we examined the transcriptional regulatory mechanism that induces CCL4 expression by methylmercury using C17.2 mouse neural stem cells. The promoter region of the CCL4 gene was analyzed by a reporter assay, revealing that the region up to 50 bp upstream from the transcription start site was necessary for inducing expression of CCL4 by methylmercury. Nine transcription factors that might bind to this upstream region and be involved in the induction of CCL4 expression by methylmercury were selected, and the induction of CCL4 expression by methylmercury was suppressed by the knockdown of serum response factor (SRF). In addition, the nuclear level of SRF was elevated by methylmercury, and an increase in the amount bound to the CCL4 gene promoter was also observed. Furthermore, we examined the upstream signaling pathway involved in the induction of CCL4 expression by SRF, and confirmed that activation of p38 and ERK, which are part of the MAPK pathway, are involved. These results suggest that methylmercury induces the expression of CCL4 by activating SRF via the p38 and ERK signaling pathway. Our findings are important for elucidating the mechanism involved in the brain-specific induction of CCL4 expression by methylmercury.
The phosphodiesterase 3A (PDE3A) gene encodes a PDE that regulates cardiac myocyte cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels and myocardial contractile function. PDE3 inhibitors (PDE3i) are used for short-term treatment of refractory heart failure (HF), but do not produce uniform long-term benefit.
The authors tested the hypothesis that drug target genetic variation could explain clinical response heterogeneity to PDE3i in HF.
PDE3A promoter studies were performed in a cloned luciferase construct. In human left ventricular (LV) preparations, mRNA expression was measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and PDE3 enzyme activity by cAMP-hydrolysis.
The authors identified a 29-nucleotide (nt) insertion (INS)/deletion (DEL) polymorphism in the human PDE3A gene promoter beginning 2,214 nt upstream from the PDE3A1 translation start site. Transcription factor ATF3 binds to the INS and represses cAMP-dependent promoter activity. In explanted failing LVs that were homozygous for PDE3A DEL and had been treated with PDE3i pre-cardiac transplantation, PDE3A1 mRNA abundance and microsomal PDE3 enzyme activity were increased by 1.7-fold to 1.8-fold (p &lt; 0.05) compared with DEL homozygotes not receiving PDE3i. The basis for the selective up-regulation in PDE3A gene expression in DEL homozygotes treated with PDE3i was a cAMP response element enhancer 61 nt downstream from the INS, which was repressed by INS. The DEL homozygous genotype frequency was also enriched in patients with HF.
A 29-nt INS/DEL polymorphism in the PDE3A promoter regulates cAMP-induced PDE3A gene expression in patients treated with PDE3i. This molecular mechanism may explain response heterogeneity to this drug class, and may inform a pharmacogenetic strategy for a more effective use of PDE3i in HF.
Promoter motifs in Entamoeba histolytica were earlier analysed using microarray data with lower dynamic range of gene expression. Additionally, previous transcriptomic studies did not provide information on the nature of highly transcribed genes, and downstream promoter motifs important for gene expression. To address these issues we generated RNA-Seq data and identified the high and low expressing genes, especially with respect to virulence potential. We analysed sequences both upstream and downstream of start site for important motifs.
We used RNA-Seq data to classify genes according to expression levels, which ranged six orders of magnitude. Data were validated by reporter gene expression. Virulence-related genes (except AIG1) were amongst the highly expressed, while some kinases and BspA family genes were poorly expressed. We looked for conserved motifs in sequences upstream and downstream of the initiation codon. Following enrichment by AME we found seven motifs significantly enriched in high expression- and three in low expression-classes. Two of these motifs (M4 and M6) were located downstream of AUG, were exclusively enriched in high expression class, and were mostly found in ribosomal protein, and translation-related genes. Motif deletion resulted in drastic down regulation of reporter gene expression, showing functional relevance. Distribution of core promoter motifs (TATA, GAAC, and Inr) in all genes revealed that genes with downstream motifs were not preferentially associated with TATA-less promoters. We looked at gene expression changes in cells subjected to growth stress by serum starvation, and experimentally validated the data. Genes showing maximum up regulation belonged to the low or medium expression class, and included genes in signalling pathways, lipid metabolism, DNA repair, Myb transcription factors, BspA, and heat shock. Genes showing maximum down regulation belonged to the high or medium expression class. They included genes for signalling factors, actin, Ariel family, and ribosome biogenesis factors.
Our analysis has added important new information about the E. histolytica transcriptome. We report for the first time two downstream motifs required for gene expression, which could be used for over expression of E. histolytica genes. Most of the virulence-related genes in this parasite are highly expressed in culture.
Fatty acids are essential to cell functionality, and may exert diverging vascular effects including migration, proliferation, oxidative stress and inflammation. This study examined the effect of palmitate on human coronary artery smooth muscle cell (HCASMC) function. An in vitro wound-healing assay indicated that palmitate decreased HCASMC migration in dose- and time-dependent manners. Furthermore, BrdU incorporation assays indicated that palmitate decreased HCASMC proliferation in a dose-response manner. Palmitate also increased ROS formation, MDA content and intracellular lipid droplets accompained with an increased of FABP4 expression. Moreover, palmitate induced gene expression (MCP1, MMP2, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α) and intracellular protein content (PAI-1 and uPA) of inflammatory mediators. Finally, we showed that palmitate activates the transcription factor Nrf2 and the upstream kinases ERK1/2 and Akt in HCASMCs. The inhibitor of Nrf2, trigonellin, significantly attenuated palmitate-induced HCASMC expression of the Nrf2 target gene NQO1. These findings indicate that palmitate might be critically related to HCASMC function by slowing cell migration and proliferation and inducing lipid-laden cells, oxidative stress and inflammation in part by activation of the Nrf2 transcription factor. Palmitate's activation of pro-inflammatory Nrf2 signaling may represent a novel mechanism mediating the proatherogenic actions of saturated fatty acids.
N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), a generic form of sialic acid, is enzymatically synthesized by cytidine-5'-monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH). Although expression of pig CMAH gene pcmah encoding CMAH has been reported to be regulated by pathogenic infection and developmental processes, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the regulation of pcmah gene expression. The objective of this study was to determine mechanism(s) involved in intestine specific regulation of pcmah gene by identifying several cis-acting elements and nuclear transcription factors that could directly interact with these cis-acting elements. We identified intestine specific promoter region (Pi) of pcmah gene located at upstream regions of the 5'flanking region of exon 1a and found that the promoter region is responsible for the transcriptional regulation of 5'pcmah-1. Based on reporter assays using serially constructed luciferase genes with each deleted promoter, we demonstrated that the Pi promoter activity was more active in intestinal IPI-2I cells than that in kidney PK15 cells, corresponding to both mRNA expression patterns in the two cell lines. In addition, we found that Sp1 transcription factor was necessary for basal activity of Pi promoter and that Ets-1 contributed to intestine-specific activity of Pi promoter. This study helps us understand transcriptional regulation of pcmah in the intestine of pig tissues. It also allows us to consider potential roles of Neu5Gc in interaction with environmental factors present in the intestinal tissue during pathogenic infection and developmental process.
The expression of secretory component (SC), the epithelial receptor for poly-immunoglobulins, is regulated in a highly tissue-specific manner. In several tissues, e.g. lacrimal gland and prostate, SC synthesis is enhanced by androgens at the transcriptional level. In this study, we describe the presence of an androgen response unit, located 3.3 kb upstream of the sc transcription initiation site and containing several 5'-TGTTCT-3'-like motifs. Although each of these elements is implicated in the enhancer function, one element, the ARE1.2 motif, is found to be the main interaction site for the androgen receptor as demonstrated in in vitro binding assays as well as in transient transfection assays. A high-affinity binding site for nuclear factor I, adjacent to this ARE, is also involved in the correct functioning of the sc upstream enhancer. The ARE1.2 motif consists of an imperfect direct repeat of two core binding elements with a three-nucleotide spacer and therefore constitutes a nonconventional ARE. We demonstrate that this element displays selectivity for the androgen receptor as opposed to glucocorticoid receptor both in in vitro binding assays and in transfection experiments. Mutational analysis suggests that the direct nature of the half-site repeat is responsible for this selectivity. We have thus determined a complex and androgen-specific response unit in the far upstream region of the human SC gene, which we believe to be involved in its androgen responsiveness in epithelial cells of different organs such as prostate and lacrimal gland. We were also able to demonstrate that the primary sequence of a single nonconventional ARE motif within the enhancer is responsible for its androgen specificity.
MHR3, a homolog of the retinoid orphan receptor (ROR), is a transcription factor in the nuclear hormone receptor family that is induced by 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) in the epidermis of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. Its 2.7-kb 5' flanking region was found to contain four putative ecdysone receptor response elements (EcREs) and a monomeric (GGGTCA) nuclear receptor binding site. Activation of this promoter fused to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter by 2 micrograms of 20E per ml in Manduca GV1 cells was similar to that of endogenous MHR3, with detectable CAT by 3 h. When the ecdysone receptor B1 (EcR-B1) and Ultraspiracle 1 (USP-1) were expressed at high levels under the control of a constitutive promoter, CAT levels after a 3-h exposure to 20E increased two- to sixfold. In contrast, high expression of EcR-B1 and USP-2 caused little increase in CAT levels in response to 20E. Moreover, expression of USP-2 prevented activation by EcR-B1-USP-1. Deletion experiments showed that the upstream region, including the three most proximal putative EcREs, was responsible for most of the 20E activation, with the EcRE3 at -671 and the adjacent GGGTCA being most critical. The EcRE1 at -342 was necessary but not sufficient for the activational response but was the only one of the three putative EcREs to bind the EcR-B1-USP-1 complex in gel mobility shift assays and was responsible for the silencing action of EcR-B1-USP-1 in the absence of hormone. EcRE2 and EcRE3 each specifically bound other protein(s) in the cell extract, but not EcR and USP, and so are not EcREs in this cellular context. When cell extracts were used, the EcR-B1-USP-2 heterodimer showed no binding to EcRE1, and the presence of excess USP-2 prevented the binding of EcR-B1-USP-1 to this element. In contrast, in vitro-transcribed-translated USP-1 and USP-2 both formed heterodimeric complexes with EcR-B1 that bound ponasterone A with the same Kd (7 x 10(-10) M) and bound to both EcRE1 and heat shock protein 27 EcRE. Thus, factors present in the cell extract appear to modulate the differential actions of the two USP isoforms.
Transcription of the late genes of simian virus 40 (SV40) is repressed during the early phase of the lytic cycle of infection of binding of cellular factors, called IBP-s, to the SV40 late promoter; repression is relieved after the onset of viral DNA replication by titration of these repressors. Preliminary data indicated that one of the major components of IBP-s was human estrogen-related receptor 1 (hERR1). We show here that several members of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily, including testis receptor 2, thyroid receptor alpha 1 in combination with retinoid X receptor alpha, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factors 1 and 2 (COUP-TF1 and COUP-TF2), as well as hERR1, possess the properties of IBP-s. These receptors bind specifically to hormone receptor binding sites present in the SV40 major late promoter. Recombinant COUP-TF1 specifically represses transcription from the SV40 major late promoter in a cell-free transcription system. Expression of COUP-TF1, COUP-TF2, or hERR1 in monkey cells results in repression of the SV40 late promoter, but not the early promoter, in the absence of the virally encoded large tumor antigen. Overexpression of COUP-TF1 leads to a delay in the early-to-late switch in SV40 gene expression during the lytic cycle of infection. Thus, members of this superfamily can play major direct roles in regulating expression of SV40. Possibly, natural or synthetic ligands to these receptors can serve as antiviral drugs. Our findings also provide the basis for the development of assays to screen for the ligands to testis receptor 2 and hERR1.
The 5'-flanking region of the human gene encoding beta-alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH2) was shown by DNase I footprinting to contain three tandem binding sites for purified glucocorticoid receptor. The three binding sites lie very close together between nucleotide (nt) positions -245 and -171 with respect to the transcription start point. DNase I footprinting using a rat liver nuclear extract indicated a lack of protection of the glucocorticoid receptor binding sites, but protection of a sequence between nt -209 and -191 which partially overlaps the glucocorticoid receptor binding sites I and II. This site has homology with the known binding site for hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1). ADH2 promoter DNA fragments containing various lengths of 5'-flanking sequences were fused upstream from the gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) and transfected into the HepG2 human hepatoma cell line. The resulting cat expression was subject to induction by dexamethasone in constructions containing ADH2 DNA between nt -272 and -171. This indicates that the glucocorticoid receptor binding sites identified by footprint analysis function as a glucocorticoid response element (GRE) in a liver cell line. Heterologous ADH-cat fusions, in which the ADH2-GRE was fused to the adenovirus major late promoter, exhibited glucocorticoid induction of cat expression in CV-1B cells when cotransfected with a glucocorticoid receptor expression vector. Glucocorticoid regulation in CV-1B was observed when either all three glucocorticoid receptor binding sites (sites 0, I, II) or the two distal sites (sites 0, I) were present. Overall, these results indicate that the ADH2 gene possesses a functional GRE which can potentially regulate expression transcriptionally.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Many genes of the cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) subfamily, including several human and rat isoforms, are inducible by glucocorticoids. In the rat CYP3A23 gene, a 110-base pair segment of the proximal 5'-flanking region mediates dexamethasone activation. Three binding sites (DexRE-1, DexRE-2, and Site A), identified by DNase I footprinting analysis, were characterized for their relative contribution to both basal activity and dexamethasone inducibility. Site-directed mutagenesis of DexRE-1 (-144 to -169) and DexRE-2 (-118 to -136) demonstrated that each contained a core imperfect AGGTCA direct repeat, which comprised a consensus nuclear receptor binding site, and was essential for dexamethasone responsiveness but was not required for basal activity. Competition gel shift and supershift analyses revealed that both sites can bind the orphan nuclear receptor chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor. Site A (-85 to -110) was shown to be important for both basal activity and dexamethasone responsiveness. Point mutants displayed a reduced (2-3-fold) induction response, compared with 15-fold for wild-type, which was accompanied by a 40-60% drop in basal activity. Site A was shown to bind the liver-enriched nuclear receptor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4. Our studies demonstrate that the mechanism mediating glucocorticoid-inducible transcriptional activity of CYP3A23 involves multiple binding sites for members of the nuclear receptor superfamily.
The orphan nuclear receptor steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) plays a key role in regulating the expression of the rat P450c17 gene in testicular Leydig and in adrenocortical cells. Other DNA sequences, not bound by SF-1, are also involved in transcriptional regulation of the rat P450c17 gene in both cell types. The region from -447/-399 or from -447/-419 increased both basal and cAMP-induced transcription, and the region from -418/-399 increased basal transcription to a greater extent than the intact -447/-399 DNA. The -447/-399 DNA sequence contains three imperfect copies of the orphan nuclear receptor-binding motif, AGGTCA, and at least three known orphan nuclear receptors, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF), SF-1, and an early response gene induced by nerve growth factor (NGFI-B), bind to -447/-399 DNA. The AGGTCA triad is bound by one set of nuclear proteins when these three elements are colinear and is bound by a different set of proteins when these elements are separated. When the elements are separated, COUP-TF no longer binds, and the region -418/-399 is bound by a protein that greatly stimulates basal transcription. The region -447/-419 is bound by two different proteins that mediate both basal and cAMP-stimulated transcription. We call the protein binding to -418/-399 steroidogenic factor inducer of transcription-1 (StF-IT-1), and one of the proteins binding to -447/-419, StF-IT-2. SF-1 binds to a second AGGTCA element in the -447/-419 region. StF-IT-1 and StF-IT-2 are both found in Leydig and adrenal cells, and transcriptional regulation is similar in both cell types. SF-1 and NGF-IB may increase transcription by displacing COUP-TF (a transcriptional repressor) because these proteins share DNA-binding domains. However, neither SF-1 nor NGF-IB alone, binding as monomers, increases transcription. Rather, these proteins must interact with another DNA-binding protein, e.g. StF-IT-2, to increase transcription. StF-IT-2 also requires interaction with SF-1 (or NGF-IB) bound to DNA and cannot increase transcription by itself. This mechanism of action is different from the mechanism by which SF-1 regulates transcription from the -84/-55 region of the rat P450c17 gene. Thus, we have defined a novel mechanism of action for orphan nuclear receptors that bind to DNA as monomers.
CSDE1 (cold shock domain containing E1) gene is located upstream of the N-RAS locus, and codes for an RNA-binding protein named Upstream of N-Ras (UNR). In cancer, CSDE1 has been shown to regulate c-Fos, c-Myc, Pten, Rac1, or Vimentin. UNR/CSDE1 has been studied in breast, melanoma, pancreatic and prostate cancer. Then, the aim of this study is to evaluate the role of CSDE1/UNR in colorectal cancer progression and maintenance of aggressive phenotype. We firstly evaluated UNR/CSDE1 expression in human colon cancer derived cell lines and patient samples. Subsequently, we performed functional experiments by UNR/CSDE1 downregulation. We also evaluated UNR/CSDE1 prognostic relevance in two independent sets of patients. Not only was UNR/CSDE1 expression higher in tumor samples compared to untransformed samples, but also in colonospheres and metastatic origin cell lines than their parental and primary cell lines, respectively. Downregulation of UNR/CSDE1 reduced cell viability and migration throughout a restrain of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and increases sensitivity to apoptosis. Interestingly, high UNR/CSDE1 expression was associated with poor prognosis and correlated positively with c-MYC expression in colorectal cancer samples and cell lines. Here, we show for the first time compelling data reporting the oncogenic role of UNR/CSDE1 in human colorectal cancer.
TNFα is a cytokine whose levels are increased in inflammatory pathologies that are associated with cholestasis. Endocytic internalization of Abcc2 (multidrug resistance-associated protein 2), a canalicular transporter of organic anions that is implicated in the clearance of clinically important drugs, is a phenomenon that occurs in inflammatory liver diseases, and it has been established that cytokines act as mediators. However, the intracellular mechanism involved in this effect remains unknown. The aim of the present work was to characterize the internalization of Abcc2 induced by TNFα and to study the role of ERK1/2 and reactive oxygen species as signaling mediators of transporter internalization. Using rat hepatocyte couplets, we found that TNFα (6.25 pg/ml) induced a decrease in Abcc2 activity estimated by the accumulation of the Abcc2 substrate glutathione methylfluorescein in the canalicular vacuole that was accompanied by internalization of Abcc2 from the canalicular membrane. Inhibition of MEK1/2 (upstream of ERK1/2) partially prevented TNFα effects on Abcc2 internalization and activity impairment. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers such as vitamin C and mannitol partially prevented both TNFα-induced decrease in Abcc2 activity and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Apocynin, a NADPH oxidase inhibitor, prevented the increase in ROS and the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 produced by TNFα. Taken together, these results indicate that TNFα activates a pathway involving NADPH oxidase, ROS and MEK1/2-ERK1/2 that is partially responsible for the internalization of Abcc2. This internalization leads to an altered transport activity of Abcc2 that could impair drug disposal, enhancing drug toxicity in patients suffering from inflammatory liver diseases.
Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), a progressive myopathy that afflicts individuals of all ages, provides a powerful model of the complex interplay between genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of chromatin regulation. FSHD is caused by dysregulation of a macrosatellite repeat, either by contraction of the repeat or by mutations in silencing proteins. Both cases lead to chromatin relaxation and, in the context of a permissive allele, aberrant expression of the DUX4 gene in skeletal muscle. DUX4 is a pioneer transcription factor that activates a program of gene expression during early human development, after which its expression is silenced in most somatic cells. When misexpressed in FSHD skeletal muscle, the DUX4 program leads to accumulated muscle pathology. Epigenetic regulators of the disease locus represent particularly attractive therapeutic targets for FSHD, as many are not global modifiers of the genome, and altering their expression or activity should allow correction of the underlying defect. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics Volume 22 is August 30, 2019\.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the cholesterol extraction process in ice cream mixes (ICMs) by using β-cyclodextrin (βCD) and to analyze the effect of this extraction on the ICM rheological, stability, and sensory characteristics. The effects of fat and whey protein (WP) additions on ICM stability were also evaluated. The maximum percentage obtained for cholesterol extraction was 93.6%. The flow curves indicated that ICM showed a thixotropic behavior before and after cholesterol extraction, which was enhanced when the fat content and/or percentage of βCD increased. The stability of ICM with cholesterol-reduced content (RCho-ICM) was influenced by the fat content and/or the presence of WP. The RCho-ICM with the highest fat and/or WP addition showed less tendency to melt and had the smallest amount of accumulated molten liquid. These latter ICMs presented the slowest melting rates. Also, RCho-ICMs proved to be more stable than ICMs. RCho-ICM samples obtained with a ratio of βCD/fat content of 1% w/w were evaluated by a trained sensory panel. In addition, an acceptability test of the sample with better sensory attributes was conducted. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The effects of a cholesterol extraction process and fat and whey protein additions on the rheological and stability characteristics of ice cream mixes were evaluated. The extraction of cholesterol from an ice cream mix is interesting from a nutritional point of view and the extraction process of cholesterol itself may also help to improve the mix stability by controlling the fat and/or whey protein contents. These findings may prove useful as a starting point for the rational design of new functional ice cream mixes.
The myeloid zinc finger gene 1 (MZF1) encodes a C(2)H(2) zinc finger transcription factor that regulates granulopoiesis and may have a regulatory role in cellular proliferation and oncogenesis. The MZF1 gene has been previously reported to be 3kb and without introns. However, at least three transcripts of approximately 3, 7.5, and 9kb are detected by MZF1-specific probes in northern blot analysis and the identity of the transcripts has not been addressed. We screened a K562 cDNA library and identified novel transcripts, MZF1B and MZF1C. The 2.9kb MZF1B cDNA encodes a putative 734 aa protein and MZF1C maintains an identical open reading frame with 320 nucleotides deleted in the 5'-untranslated region. The MZF1B/1C protein contains all but the first eight amino acids of MZF1. Thus, MZF protein isoforms share 100 aa, as well as the bipartite 13 zinc finger DNA binding domain. In addition, MZF1B/1C encodes a unique 257 aa MZF1B/C amino terminus containing a SCAN box, or leucine-rich domain, which has recently been demonstrated to facilitate protein interactions. Sequence analysis reveals that the MZF gene contains six exons and spans 11kb and may be the most telomeric gene on chromosome 19q13. Exons 1-6 produce MZF1B/C cDNA, whereas MZF1 cDNA initiates within intron 5 and continues through exon 6. The 7.5 and 9kb transcripts are incompletely processed and contain intron sequences. These studies are the first description of the complete human MZF gene and of the composition of the multiple transcripts that are detected by northern blot analysis.
The SCAN box or leucine-rich (LeR) domain is a conserved motif found within a subfamily of C(2)H(2) zinc finger proteins. The function of a SCAN box is unknown, but it is predicted to form alpha-helices that may be involved in protein-protein interactions. Myeloid zinc finger gene-1B (MZF1B) is an alternatively spliced human cDNA isoform of the zinc finger transcription factor, MZF1. MZF1 and MZF1B contain 13 C(2)H(2) zinc finger motifs, but only MZF1B contains an amino-terminal SCAN box. A bone marrow cDNA library was screened for proteins interacting with the MZF1B SCAN box domain and RAZ1 (SCAN-related protein associated with MZF1B) was identified. RAZ1 is a novel cDNA that encodes a SCAN-related domain and arginine-rich region but no zinc finger motifs. Co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that the SCAN box domain of MZF1B is necessary for association with RAZ1. By yeast two-hybrid analysis, the carboxyl terminus of RAZ1 is sufficient for interaction with the MZF1B SCAN box. Furthermore, MZF1B and RAZ1 each self-associate in vitro via a SCAN box-dependent mechanism. These data provide evidence that the SCAN box is a protein interaction domain that mediates both hetero- and homoprotein associations.
The SCAN box (SRE-ZBP; CT-fin51; AW-1; Number 18) is a highly-conserved 80-amino-acid domain identified in a subset of C(2)H(2) zinc finger proteins. We and others have recently demonstrated that the SCAN box is a protein association domain that mediates hetero- and homo-protein associations with SCAN box containing proteins. RAZ1 (SCAN-related protein associated with MZF1B) is a novel gene identified in a yeast two hybrid genetic screen for binding to the MZF1B SCAN box. RAZ1 maps to chromosome 20q11 at a region frequently disrupted in various leukemias. We characterized the RAZ1 gene by analysing cDNA transcripts, mRNA expression, and cellular localization of the expressed protein. RAZ1 mRNA expression was detected in various human tissues and cell lines by Northern blot analysis and multiple tissue expression arrays. Highest levels of expression are in prostate, testis, thyroid, liver, and kidney. The RAZ1 gene produces two transcripts with variant 5'-untranslated regions containing identical open reading frames that express a 28 kDa protein in vitro. RAZ1 transcription start sites were mapped by primer extension and confirmed by identification of the RAZ1 promoter in the 5' flanking genomic DNA. RAZ1 protein fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) localizes to the nucleus in a diffuse pattern and the carboxyl terminus containing the SCAN-related domain is sufficient for nuclear localization. These data suggest that RAZ1 is a widely expressed nuclear protein that may function as a key regulator of zinc finger transcription factor function.
Antagonizing transcriptional activity of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in the intestine has been reported as an effective means for the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, type 2 diabetes and obesity. We describe herein that the building blocks necessary to maintain the antagonism of our chemotype were investigated in order to modulate in vivo pharmacokinetic behavior and the tissue distribution without blunting the activity against FXR. A comprehensive understanding of the structure-activity relationship led to analog 30, which is superior to 12 in terms of its pharmacokinetic profiles by oral administration and its tissue distribution toward target tissues (liver and ileum) in rats while preserving the in vitro activity of 12 against FXR. Thus, 30 should be a candidate compound to investigate the effects of inhibiting FXR activity while simultaneously improving the outcome of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, type 2 diabetes and obesity.
Esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs) tend to have multiple primary lesions, and it is believed that they arise from background mucosae with accumulation of genetic/epigenetic alterations. In this study, the objective was to elucidate the effects of smoking and drinking on the accumulation of epigenetic alterations in background mucosae.
Genes that are silenced in human ESCCs were searched for by treating 3 ESCC cell lines with the demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and performing oligonucleotide microarrays. Methylation levels were analyzed by quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction analysis of 60 ESCCs and their corresponding background mucosae.
Forty-seven genes were identified as methylation-silenced in at least 1 of the 3 ESCC cell lines, and 14 of those genes (claudin 6 [CLDN6]; G protein-coupled receptor 158 [GPR158]; homeobox A9 [HOXA9]; metallothionein 1M [MT1M]; neurofilament, heavy polypeptide 200 kDa [NEFH]; plakophilin 1 [PKP1]; protein phosphatase 1, regulatory [inhibitor] subunit 14A [PPP1R14A]; pyrin domain and caspase recruitment domain containing [PYCARD]; R-spondin family, member 4 [RSPO4]; testis-specific protein, Y-encoded-like 5 [TSPYL5]; ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1 [UCHL1]; zinc-finger protein 42 homolog [ZFP42]; zinc-finger protein interacting with K protein 1 homolog [ZIK1]; and zinc-finger and SCAN domain containing 18 [ZSCAN18]) were used as markers. In the background mucosae, methylation levels of 5 genes (HOXA9, MT1M, NEFH, RSPO4, and UCHL1) had significant correlations with smoking duration (rho=.268; P=.044; rho=.405; P=.002; rho=.285; P=.032; rho=.300; P=.024; and rho=.437; P=.001, respectively). In contrast, an inverse correlation between PYCARD methylation levels and alcohol intake was observed (rho=-.334, P=.025) among individuals with the inactive aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) genotype.
The current results suggested that ESCCs developed from an epigenetic field for cancerization, which was induced by exposure to carcinogenic factors, such as tobacco smoking. The epigenetic field defect will be a novel target for risk diagnosis and prevention of ESCCs.
The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (pVHL) is a component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase and targets hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) for ubiquitylation and degradation under normoxic conditions. pVHL also directly inhibits HIF-1alpha transactivation by recruiting histone deacetylases. Here, we report a novel pVHL-interacting protein that functions as a negative regulator of HIF-1alpha transactivation. This protein, generated from the ZnF197 locus by alternative splicing, contains a Kruppel-associated box (KRAB)-A domain and a SCAN domain, but lacks the 22 C2H2-type zinc fingers present in ZnF197. Therefore, we named this protein pVHL-associated KRAB-A domain-containing protein (VHLaK). We demonstrate that the KRAB-A domain in VHLaK mediates pVHL binding and functions as a transcriptional repression module. The SCAN domain mediates VHLaK homo-oligomerization, which enhances VHLaK repressive activity. pVHL can recruit VHLaK to repress HIF-1alpha transcriptional activity and HIF-1alpha-induced VEGF expression. Finally, we demonstrate that pVHL, VHLaK and KAP1/TIF-1beta can be recruited into a single complex, indicating that KAP1/TIF-1beta may participate in pVHL-mediated transcriptional repression of HIF-1alpha. Our findings provide a novel mechanism for the modulation of HIF-1alpha transactivation by pVHL.
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major comorbidity among HIV-infected individuals. Common carotid artery intima-media thickness (cCIMT) is a valid and reliable subclinical measure of atherosclerosis and is known to predict CVD. We performed genome-wide association (GWA) and admixture analysis among 682 HIV-positive and 288 HIV-negative Black, non-Hispanic women from the Women's Interagency HIV study (WIHS) cohort using a combined and stratified analysis approach. We found some suggestive associations but none of the SNPs reached genome-wide statistical significance in our GWAS analysis. The top GWAS SNPs were rs2280828 in the region intergenic to mediator complex subunit 30 and exostosin glycosyltransferase 1 (MED30 | EXT1) among all women, rs2907092 in the catenin delta 2 (CTNND2) gene among HIV-positive women, and rs7529733 in the region intergenic to family with sequence similarity 5, member C and regulator of G-protein signaling 18 (FAM5C | RGS18) genes among HIV-negative women. The most significant local European ancestry associations were in the region intergenic to the zinc finger and SCAN domain containing 5D gene and NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex assembly factor 1 (ZSCAN5D | NDUF1) pseudogene on chromosome 19 among all women, in the region intergenic to vomeronasal 1 receptor 6 pseudogene and zinc finger protein 845 (VN1R6P | ZNF845) gene on chromosome 19 among HIV-positive women, and in the region intergenic to the SEC23-interacting protein and phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2 domain containing 1A (SEC23IP | PPAPDC1A) genes located on chromosome 10 among HIV-negative women. A number of previously identified SNP associations with cCIMT were also observed and included rs2572204 in the ryanodine receptor 3 (RYR3) and an admixture region in the secretion-regulating guanine nucleotide exchange factor (SERGEF) gene. We report several SNPs and gene regions in the GWAS and admixture analysis, some of which are common across HIV-positive and HIV-negative women as demonstrated using meta-analysis, and also across the two analytic approaches (i.e., GWA and admixture). These findings suggest that local European ancestry plays an important role in genetic associations of cCIMT among black women from WIHS along with other environmental factors that are related to CVD and may also be triggered by HIV. These findings warrant confirmation in independent samples.
In acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) with t(8;21), the transcription factor AML1 is juxtaposed to the zinc finger nuclear protein ETO (Eight-Twenty-One), resulting in transcriptional repression of AML1 target genes. ETO has been shown to interact with corepressors, such as N-CoR and mSin3A to form complexes containing histone deacetylases. To define regions of ETO required for maximal repressor activity, we analyzed amino-terminal deletions in a transcriptional repression assay. We found that ETO mutants lacking the first 236 amino acids were not affected in their repressor activity, whereas a further deletion of 85 amino acids drastically reduced repressor function and high molecular weight complex formation. This latter mutant can still homodimerize and bind to N-CoR but shows only weak binding to mSin3A. Furthermore, we could show that a "core repressor domain" comprising nervy homology region 2 and its amino- and carboxyl-terminal flanking sequences recruits mSin3A and induces transcriptional repression. These results suggest that mSin3A and N-CoR bind to ETO independently and that both binding sites cooperate to maximize ETO-mediated transcriptional repression. Thus, ETO has a modular structure, and the interaction between the individual elements is essential for the formation of a stable repressor complex and efficient transcriptional repression.
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is important in embryonic development and tumorigenesis. Smad-interacting protein 1 (SIP1) can induce EMT by repressing the transcription of E-cadherin through recruitment of the corepressor C-terminal-binding protein (CtBP). How the activity of SIP1 is regulated still remains unclear. Here we show in vivo and in vitro that SIP1 is covalently modified by sumoylation at two conserved sites, Lys391 and Lys866. The polycomb protein Pc2, but not the PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) family proteins, acts as a Small ubiquitin-like modifier E3 ligase for SIP1. Sumoylation of SIP1 does not affect its subcellular localization, but regulates its transcriptional activity. Compared with the wild-type, a SIP1 sumoylation null mutant shows more potent repression on E-cadherin transcription but similar repression on two transforming growth factor-beta-responsive reporter genes and comparable activation on vitamin D3 receptor transcription. Coexpression of SIP1 with Pc2 can partially relieve E-cadherin repression by SIP1. We further show that SIP1 sumoylation disrupts the recruitment of CtBP. Thus SIP1 sumoylation regulates its transcriptional activity in a promoter context-dependent manner and may represent an important intervention target to modulate EMT in tumorigenesis.
Many transcription factors function by repressing gene transcription. For a variety of these transcription factors the ability to physically recruit auxiliary proteins, denoted corepressors, is crucial for the ability to silence gene expression. We and others have previously implicated the SMRT corepressor in the actions of the PLZF transcription factor and in the function of its oncogenic derivative, PLZF-retinoic acid receptor (RARalpha), in promyelocytic leukemia. We report here that PLZF, and a structurally similar transcriptional repressor, BCL-6, can interact with a variety of corepressor proteins in addition to SMRT, including the mSin3A protein and (for PLZF) histone deacetylase-1. Unexpectedly, these additional interactions with corepressor components are nonequivalent for these otherwise similar oncoproteins, suggesting that transcriptional repression by BCL-6 and by PLZF may differ in mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the oncogenic PLZF-RARalpha chimera lacks several important corepressor interaction sites that are present in the native PLZF protein. Thus the t(11;17) translocation that creates the PLZF-RARalpha chimera generates an oncoprotein with potentially novel regulatory properties distinct from those of either parental protein. Our results demonstrate that otherwise similar transcription factors can differ notably in their interactions with the corepressor machinery.
We have recently cloned the cDNA of p42IP4, a membrane-associated and cytosolic inositol (1,3,4,5)tetrakisphosphate receptor protein [Stricker, R., Hülser, E., Fischer, J., Jarchau, T., Walter, U., Lottspeich, F. &amp; Reiser, G. (1997) FEBS Lett. 405, 229-236.] p42IP4 is a protein of 374 amino acids with Mr of 42 kDa. The p42IP4 protein has a zinc finger motif at its N-terminus, followed by two pleckstrin homology domains. To characterize further the biochemical and functional properties of p42IP4, it was expressed as a glutathione-S-transferase fusion protein in Sf9 cells using a recombinant baculovirus vector. The protein was affinity adsorbed on glutathione beads, cleaved from glutathione-S-transferase with the protease factor-Xa and purified on heparin agarose. The recombinant purified protein is active because it shows binding affinities similar to those of the native p42IP4, purified from pig cerebellum or rat brain (Ki for inositol(1,3,4,5)P4 of 4.1 nm and 2.2 nm, respectively). Moreover the ligand specificity of the recombinant protein for various inositol polyphosphates is similar to that of the native protein purified from brain. Importantly, we show here that p42IP4 binds phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5)P3 specifically, as the recombinant protein can associate with lipid membranes (vesicles) containing phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5)P3; this binding occurs in a concentration-dependent manner and is blocked by inositol(1,3,4,5)P4. This specific association and the possibility that endogenous p42IP4 can be converted from a membrane-associated state to a soluble state support the hypothesis that p42IP4 might be redistributed between cellular compartments upon hormonal stimulation.
Snail1 and ZEB1 are transcriptional repressors that drive tumor initiation and metastasis in animal models. Snail1 and ZEB1 are frequently coexpressed in tumor cell lines, suggesting that these factors may cooperate to promote tumor progression. However, coexpression of these transcriptional repressors in primary human cancer specimens has not been investigated. Previous studies assessed expression in primary breast cancers of Snail1 messenger RNA, which does not reflect Snail1 activity because Snail1 is subject to posttranslational modifications that inhibit its nuclear localization/activity. In the current study, using breast tumor cell lines of known Snail1 and ZEB1 expression status, we developed immunohistochemistry protocols for detecting nuclear Snail1 and nuclear ZEB1 proteins. Using these protocols, we assessed nuclear Snail1 and nuclear ZEB1 expressions in primary human breast cancers of varying subtypes (n = 78). Nuclear Snail1 and estrogen receptor α expressions were inversely associated in primary breast cancers, and nuclear Snail1 was expressed in approximately 80% of triple-negative breast cancers (lacking estrogen receptor α, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 overexpression). In contrast, nuclear ZEB1 was expressed at a significantly lower frequency in these breast cancers. Notably, nuclear Snail1 protein was detected in 45% of ductal carcinoma in situ specimens (n = 29), raising the important possibility that nuclear Snail1 expression in early stage breast lesions may predict future development of invasive breast cancer. Collectively, our studies demonstrate frequent expression of nuclear Snail1, but not nuclear ZEB1, in invasive, triple-negative breast cancers as well as in intraductal carcinomas.
Rex1 (Zfp42), first identified as a gene that is transcriptionally repressed by retinoic acid (RA), encodes a zinc finger transcription factor expressed at high levels in F9 teratocarcinoma stem cells, embryonic stem cells, and other stem cells. Loss of both alleles of Rex1 by homologous recombination alters the RA-induced differentiation of F9 cells, a model of pluripotent embryonic stem cells. We identified Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling-3 (SOCS-3) as a gene that exhibits greatly increased transcriptional activation in RA, cAMP, and theophylline (RACT)-treated F9 Rex1(-/-) cells (approximately 25-fold) as compared to wild-type (WT) cells ( approximately 2.5-fold). By promoter deletion, mutation, and transient transfection analyses, we have shown that this transcriptional increase is mediated by the STAT3 DNA-binding elements located between -99 to -60 in the SOCS-3 promoter. Overexpression of STAT3 dominant-negative mutants greatly diminishes this SOCS-3 transcriptional increase in F9 Rex1(-/-) cells. This increase in SOCS-3 transcription is associated with a four- to fivefold higher level of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 in the RACT-treated F9 Rex1(-/-) cells as compared to WT. Dominant-negative Src tyrosine kinase, Jak2, and protein kinase A partially reduce the transcriptional activation of the SOCS 3 gene in RACT-treated F9 Rex1 null cells. In contrast, parathyroid hormone peptide enhances the effect of RA in F9 Rex1(-/-) cells, but not in F9 WT. Thus, Rex1, which is highly expressed in stem cells, inhibits signaling via the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, thereby modulating the differentiation of F9 cells.
To characterise the genetics of splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL), we performed whole exome sequencing of 16 cases and identified novel recurrent inactivating mutations in Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2), a gene whose deficiency was previously shown to cause splenic marginal zone hyperplasia in mice. KLF2 mutation was found in 40 (42%) of 96 SMZLs, but rarely in other B-cell lymphomas. The majority of KLF2 mutations were frameshift indels or nonsense changes, with missense mutations clustered in the C-terminal zinc finger domains. Functional assays showed that these mutations inactivated the ability of KLF2 to suppress NF-κB activation by TLR, BCR, BAFFR and TNFR signalling. Further extensive investigations revealed common and distinct genetic changes between SMZL with and without KLF2 mutation. IGHV1-2 rearrangement and 7q deletion were primarily seen in SMZL with KLF2 mutation, while MYD88 and TP53 mutations were nearly exclusively found in those without KLF2 mutation. NOTCH2, TRAF3, TNFAIP3 and CARD11 mutations were observed in SMZL both with and without KLF2 mutation. Taken together, KLF2 mutation is the most common genetic change in SMZL and identifies a subset with a distinct genotype characterised by multi-genetic changes. These different genetic changes may deregulate various signalling pathways and generate cooperative oncogenic properties, thereby contributing to lymphomagenesis. 
Gliomas are highly malignant brain tumors that are highly invasive and resistant to conventional therapy. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as PDGFRα (platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α), which show frequent aberrant activation in gliomas, are associated with a process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a cellular alteration that confers a more invasive and drug-resistant phenotype. Although this phenomenon is well documented in human cancers, the processes by which RTKs including PDGFRα mediate EMT are largely unknown. Here, we report that SHP-2 (encoded by PTPN11) upregulates an EMT inducer, ZEB1, to mediate PDGFRα-driven glioma EMT, invasion and growth in glioma cell lines and patient-derived glioma stem cells (GSCs) using cell culture and orthotopic xenograft models. ZEB1 and activated PDGFRα were coexpressed in invasive regions of mouse glioma xenografts and clinical glioma specimens. Glioma patients with high levels of both phospho-PDGFRα (p-PDGFRα) and ZEB1 had significantly shorter overall survival compared with those with low expression of p-PDGFRα and ZEB1. Knockdown of ZEB1 inhibited PDGFA/PDGFRα-stimulated glioma EMT, tumor growth and invasion in glioma cell lines and patient-derived GSCs. PDGFRα mutant deficient of SHP2 binding (PDGFRα-F720) or phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) binding (PDGFRα-F731/42), knockdown of SHP2 or treatments of pharmacological inhibitor for PDGFRα-signaling effectors attenuated PDGFA/PDGFRα-stimulated ZEB1 expression, cell migration and GSC proliferation. Importantly, SHP-2 acts together with PI3K/AKT to regulate a ZEB1-miR-200 feedback loop in PDGFRα-driven gliomas. Taken together, our findings uncover a new pathway in which ZEB1 functions as a key regulator for PDGFRα-driven glioma EMT, invasiveness and growth, suggesting that ZEB1 is a promising therapeutic target for treating gliomas with high PDGFRα activation.
Various fluorescent probes have been developed to reveal the biological functions of intracellular labile Zn2+. Here, we present Green Zinc Probe (GZnP), a novel genetically encoded Zn2+ sensor design based on a single fluorescent protein (single-FP). The GZnP sensor is generated by attaching two zinc fingers (ZF) of the transcription factor Zap1 (ZF1 and ZF2) to the two ends of a circularly permuted green fluorescent protein (cpGFP). Formation of ZF folds induces interaction between the two ZFs, which induces a change in the cpGFP conformation, leading to an increase in fluorescence. A small sensor library is created to include mutations in the ZFs, cpGFP and linkers between ZF and cpGFP to improve signal stability, sensor brightness and dynamic range based on rational protein engineering, and computational design by Rosetta. Using a cell-based library screen, we identify sensor GZnP1, which demonstrates a stable maximum signal, decent brightness (QY = 0.42 at apo state), as well as specific and sensitive response to Zn2+ in HeLa cells (Fmax/Fmin = 2.6, Kd = 58 pM, pH 7.4). The subcellular localizing sensors mito-GZnP1 (in mitochondria matrix) and Lck-GZnP1 (on plasma membrane) display sensitivity to Zn2+ (Fmax/Fmin = 2.2). This sensor design provides freedom to be used in combination with other optical indicators and optogenetic tools for simultaneous imaging and advancing our understanding of cellular Zn2+ function.
The therapeutic use of interferon (IFN) is known to cause depression that frequently interrupts treatment. To identify genetic variants associated with IFN-induced depression, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 224 Japanese chronic hepatitis C patients receiving IFN-based therapy in a multicenter prospective study and stratified them into two groups according to the Beck Depression Inventory, Second Edition (BDI-II) score. In the GWAS stage, we selected 42 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to perform replication analysis in an independent set of 160 subjects. The SNP rs1863918 in strong linkage disequilibrium with SNPs located around the Zinc finger 354C (ZNF354C) gene on chromosome 5 showed a significant association when the results of GWAS and replication were combined (odds ratio = 2.55, P = 7.89×10-8 in the allele frequency model), suggesting that the rs1863918 T allele was associated with IFN-induced depression. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis showed that rs1863918 T allele, a history of depression, and younger age were independent predictive factors for IFN-induced depression. Interestingly, western blotting and immunofluorescence showed that ZNF354C was highly expressed in the hippocampus in mice, a region implicated in the pathology of psychiatric symptoms. In conclusion, we identified rs1863918 as significantly associated with IFN-induced depression, and revealed that the candidate gene ZNF354C is highly expressed in the hippocampus of mice. Our data might be useful for elucidating the pathogenic mechanisms of depression induced by drugs including IFN.
Over-expression of Gli1 is very common in lung cancer. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, using mass spectrum, we have identified WW45 as a binding partner of Gli1. WW45 interacted with Gli1, promoted its ubiquitination and inhibited the expression of its target genes. In the functional studies, WW45 inhibited the growth and migration of lung cancer cells. Knocking down the expression of WW45 promoted the growth and migration of lung cancer cells, which was rescued by down-regulation of Gli1. Moreover, over-expression of WW45 inhibited the tumorigenesis in a de novo lung cancer tumorigenesis mouse model (LKB-Ras) as well as the expression of Gli1. Also over-expression of WW45 improved the survival of these mice. In addition, the expression of WW45 was down-regulated in the clinical lung cancer samples, which was inversely correlated with the expression of Gli1. Taken together, this study demonstrated the suppressive roles of WW45 in lung cancer by inhibiting the Hedgehog/Gli1 signaling.
Glioma associated oncogene-1 (Gli-1) is considered as a strong positive activator of downstream target genes of hedgehog signal pathway in mammalians. However, its diagnostic and prognostic value in gastric cancer remains unclear and controversial. Therefore, a quantitative meta-analysis was conducted to determine the clinical value of Gli-1 in gastric cancer patients. Twelve eligible articles with 886 gastric cancer patients were included in this meta-analysis. The relationship between Gli-1 expression in gastric cancer patients and clinicopathological features and 5-year overall survival (OS) was evaluated using pooled odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The meta-analysis showed that the upregulated Gli-1 was associated with sample type (gastric cancer tissues) (OR 10.31, 95%CI 7.14-14.88; P = 0.000), differentiation type (OR 3.76, 95%CI 2.55-5.53; P = 0.000), depth of invasion (OR 8.17, 95%CI 3.60-18.55; P = 0.000), lymph node metastasis (OR 3.97, 95%CI 2.73-5.78; P = 0.000) and high TNM stage (OR 3.65, 95%CI 1.89-7.04; P = 0.000). Three studies including 316 patients were assessed for the correlation between Gli-1 and 5-year OS, which indicated that positive Gli-1 expression was associated with poor prognosis in gastric cancer patients (HR 2.14, 95%CI 1.35-3.40; P = 0.001). Little publication bias was identified by funnel plots and Egger's tests. The sensitivity analysis indicated that no study substantially influenced pooled OR/HR. Taken together, Gli-1 is a credible indicator for highly aggressive tumor with poor prognosis in gastric cancer patients.
It has been found that abnormal activation of the hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is involved in the occurrence, invasion and metastasis of malignant tumors. In addition, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) also performs an important function in the invasion and metastasis of malignant tumors. However, the significance of the Hh signaling pathway and EMT in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. In the present study, the expression of Gli family zinc finger 1 (Gli-1) and Gli family zinc finger 2 (Gli-2), which are key transcriptional factors in the Hh signaling pathway, and Twist and E-cadherin, which are two factors involved in EMT, was examined in 42 patients with HCC and 20 cases of non-tumorous liver (NTL) tissue by immunohistochemistry. Clinicopathological information was collected in order to analyze the correlation of the Hh signaling pathway with EMT. The present study aimed to examine the difference in the expression of Gli-1, Gli-2, E-cadherin and Twist in HCC and NTL to assess the diagnostic value of these factors in HCC. Additionally, the present study aimed to elucidate the correlation between those proteins and other clinicopathological parameters. Whether abnormal activation of the Hh signaling pathway is closely associated with EMT was also evaluated. Gli-1 and Twist expression was found to be significantly increased and E-cadherin expression was found to be decreased in HCC in contrast to NTL (Gli-1, P=0.019; Twist, P=0.003; E-cadherin, P&lt;0.001). Increased Twist expression was associated with the tumor size (P=0.043), and loss of or decreased E-cadherin expression was associated with the histological type of HCC (P=0.021). There was an inverse association between the expression of Twist and E-cadherin (P=0.006). These results showed that Twist overexpression by induction of EMT changes is involved in the occurrence and progression of HCC. However, the role of Hh signaling pathway-associated proteins in HCC may require elucidation by additional studies using additional materials in the future.
The Korean endemic land snail Koreanohadra kurodana (Gastropoda: Bradybaenidae) found in humid areas of broadleaf forests and shrubs have been considered vulnerable as the number of individuals are declining in recent years. The species is poorly characterized at the genomic level that limits the understanding of functions at the molecular and genetics level. In the present study, we performed de novo transcriptome sequencing to produce a comprehensive transcript dataset of visceral mass tissue of K. kurodana by the Illumina paired-end sequencing technology. Over 234 million quality reads were assembled to a total of 315,924 contigs and 191,071 unigenes, with an average and N50 length of 585.6 and 715 bp and 678 and 927 bp, respectively. Overall, 36.32 % of the unigenes found matches to known protein/nucleotide sequences in the public databases. The direction of the unigenes to functional categories was determined using COG, GO, KEGG, and InterProScan protein domain search. The GO analysis search resulted in 22,967 unigenes (12.02 %) being categorized into 40 functional groups. The KEGG annotation revealed that metabolism pathway genes were enriched. The most prominent protein motifs include the zinc finger, ribonuclease H, reverse transcriptase, and ankyrin repeat domains. The simple sequence repeats (SSRs) identified from &gt;1 kb length of unigenes show a dominancy of dinucleotide repeat motifs followed with tri- and tetranucleotide motifs. A number of unigenes were putatively assessed to belong to adaptation and defense mechanisms including heat shock proteins 70, Toll-like receptor 4, AMP-activated protein kinase, aquaporin-2, etc. Our data provide a rich source for the identification and functional characterization of new genes and candidate polymorphic SSR markers in K. kurodana. The availability of transcriptome information ( http://bioinfo.sch.ac.kr/submission/ ) would promote the utilization of the resources for phylogenetics study and genetic diversity assessment. 
Growth hormone (GH) has been used to treat children with GH deficiency (GHD) since 1966.
Using a combined retrospective and cross-sectional approach, we explored the long-term outcomes of patients with GHD, analysed factors influencing therapeutic response, determined persistence into adulthood, investigated pituitary morphology, and screened for mutations in causative genes.
The files of 96 GH-deficient children were reviewed. In a subset of 50 patients, re-assessment in adulthood was performed, including GHRH-arginine testing, pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and mutational screening for the growth hormone-1 gene (GH1) and the GHRH receptor gene (GHRHR) in isolated GHD (IGHD), and HESX1, PROP1, POU1F1, LHX3, LHX4, and GLI2 in multiple pituitary hormone deficiency (MPHD) patients.
GH was started at a height SDS of -3.2 ± 1.4 in IGHD patients and of -4.1 ± 2.1 in MPHD patients. Relative height gain was 0.3 SDS/year, absolute gain 1.6 SDS, and 1.2/2.6 SDS in IGHD/MPHD, respectively. Mid-parental target height was reached in 77%. Initial height SDS, bone age retardation and duration of GH replacement were correlated with height SDS gain. GHD persisted into adulthood in 19 and 89% of subjects with IGHD and MPHD, respectively. In 1/42 IGHD patients a GH1 mutation was detected; PROP1 mutations were found in 3/7 MPHD subjects. Anterior pituitary hypoplasia, combined with posterior pituitary ectopy and pituitary stalk invisibility on MRI, was an exclusive finding in MPHD patients.
GH replacement successfully corrects the growth deficit in children with GHD. While the genetic aetiology remains undefined in most cases of IGHD, PROP1 mutations constitute a major cause for MPHD. Persistence of GHD into adulthood is related to abnormal pituitary morphology.
To investigate the associations of previously reported Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia genomic variants with common neuropathologies.
This is a postmortem study including 1,017 autopsied participants from 2 clinicopathologic cohorts. Analyses focused on 22 genomic variants associated with AD dementia in large-scale case-control genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analyses. The neuropathologic traits of interest were a pathologic diagnosis of AD according to NIA-Reagan criteria, macroscopic and microscopic infarcts, Lewy bodies (LB), and hippocampal sclerosis. For each variant, multiple logistic regression was used to investigate its association with neuropathologic traits, adjusting for age, sex, and subpopulation structure. We also conducted power analyses to estimate the sample sizes required to detect genome-wide significance (p &lt; 5 × 10(-8)) for pathologic AD for all variants.
APOE ε4 allele was associated with greater odds of pathologic AD (odds ratio [OR] 3.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.67-5.46, p = 1.9 × 10(-13)), while ε2 allele was associated with lower odds of pathologic AD (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.30-0.61, p = 3.1 × 10(-6)). Four additional genomic variants including rs6656401 (CR1), rs1476679 (ZCWPW1), rs35349669 (INPP5D), and rs17125944 (FERMT2) had p values less than 0.05. Remarkably, half of the previously reported AD dementia variants are not likely to be detected for association with pathologic AD with a sample size in excess of the largest GWAS meta-analyses of AD dementia.
Many recently discovered genomic variants for AD dementia are not associated with the pathology of AD. Some genomic variants for AD dementia appear to be associated with other common neuropathologies.
With the technological development of several engineered endonucleases (EENs), such as zinc-finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and CRISPR/Cas9, gene targeting by homologous recombination has been efficiently improved to generate site-specifically genetically modified livestock. However, few studies have been done to investigate the health and fertility of these animals. The purpose of the present study is to investigate if gene targeting events and a recloning procedure would affect the production traits of EEN-mediated gene targeted bucks. TALEN-mediated β-lactoglobulin (BLG) gene mono-allelic knockout (BLG (+/-)) goats and bi-allelic knockout (BLG (-/-)) buck produced by using sequential gene targeting combined with recloning in fibroblasts from BLG (+/-) buck were used to evaluate their health and fertility. Birth weight and postnatal growth of BLG (+/-) bucks were similar to the wild-type goats. None of the parameters for both fresh and frozen-thawed semen quality were significantly different in BLG (+/-) or BLG (-/-) bucks compared to their corresponding comparators. In vitro fertilization (IVF) test revealed that the proportion of IVF oocytes developing to the blastocyst stage was identical among BLG (+/-), BLG (-/-) and wild-type bucks. Conception rates of artificial insemination were respectively 42.3, 38.0 and 42.6 % for frozen-thawed semen from the BLG (+/-), BLG (-/-) and wild-type bucks. In addition, germline transmission of the targeted BLG modification was in accordance with Mendelian rules. These results demonstrated that the analyzed growth and reproductive traits were not impacted by targeting BLG gene and recloning, implicating the potential for dairy goat breeding of BLG (+/-) and BLG (-/-) bucks.
Whole genome analyses were performed to test the hypothesis that temporal cortical gene expression differs between epilepsy patients rendered seizure-free versus non-seizure-free following anterior temporal lobectomy with amygdalohippocampectomy (ATL/AH). Twenty four patients underwent ATL/AH to treat medically intractable seizures of temporal lobe origin (mean age 35.5 years, mean follow-up 42.2 months); they were then dichotomized into seizure-free and non-seizure-free groups. Tissue RNA was isolated from the lateral temporal cortex and gene expression analysis was performed. Whole genome data were analyzed for prognostic value for seizure-free outcome following ATL/AH by logistic regression. Genes that could distinguish seizure outcome groups were identified based on providing an accuracy of &gt;0.90 judging by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC, with a P value of the slope coefficient of &lt;0.05. Four genes and seven RNA probes were with prognostic value for post-operative seizure-free outcome. Gene expression associated with seizure-free outcome included relative down-regulation of zinc finger protein 852 (ZNF852), CUB domain-containing protein 2 (CDCP2), proline-rich transmembrane protein 1 (PRRT1), hypothetical LOC440200 (FLJ41170), RNA probe 8047763, RNA probe 8126238, RNA probe 8113489, RNA probe 8092883, RNA probe 7935228, RNA probe 806293, and RNA probe 8104131. This study describes the predictive value of temporal cortical gene expression for seizure-free outcome after ATL/AH. Four genes and seven RNA probes were found to predict post-operative seizure-free outcome. Future prospective investigation of these genes and probes in human brain tissue and blood could establish new biomarkers predictive of seizure outcome following ATL/AH.
DNA methylation has been hypothesized as a mechanism for explaining the association between smoking and adverse prostate cancer (PCa) outcomes. This study was aimed at assessing whether smoking is associated with prostate tumor DNA methylation and whether these alterations may explain in part the association of smoking with PCa recurrence and mortality.
A total of 523 men had radical prostatectomy as their primary treatment, detailed smoking history data, long-term follow-up for PCa outcomes, and tumor tissue profiled for DNA methylation. Ninety percent of the men also had matched tumor gene expression data. A methylome-wide analysis was conducted to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) by smoking status. To select potential functionally relevant DMRs, their correlation with the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of corresponding genes was evaluated. Finally, a smoking-related methylation score based on the top-ranked DMRs was created to assess its association with PCa outcomes.
Forty DMRs were associated with smoking status, and 10 of these were strongly correlated with mRNA expression (aldehyde oxidase 1 [AOX1], claudin 5 [CLDN5], early B-cell factor 1 [EBF1], homeobox A7 [HOXA7], lectin galactoside-binding soluble 3 [LGALS3], microtubule-associated protein τ [MAPT], protocadherin γ A [PCDHGA]/protocadherin γ B [PCDHGB], paraoxonase 3 [PON3], synaptonemal complex protein 2 like [SYCP2L], and zinc finger and SCAN domain containing 12 [ZSCAN12]). Men who were in the highest tertile for the smoking-methylation score derived from these DMRs had a higher risk of recurrence (odds ratio [OR], 2.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.42-3.72) and lethal disease (OR, 4.21; 95% CI, 1.65-11.78) in comparison with men in the lower 2 tertiles.
This integrative molecular epidemiology study supports the hypothesis that smoking-associated tumor DNA methylation changes may explain at least part of the association between smoking and adverse PCa outcomes. Future studies are warranted to confirm these findings and understand the implications for improving patient outcomes. Cancer 2016;122:2168-77. © 2016 American Cancer Society.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. Dysregulation of miRNA has been implicated in the development and progression of prostate cancer. Through next generation miRNA sequencing, we recently identified a panel of five miRNAs associated with prostate cancer recurrence and metastasis. Of the five miRNAs, miR-301a had the strongest association with prostate cancer recurrence. Overexpression of miR-301a in prostate cancer cells, PC3, and LNCaP resulted in increased growth both in vitro and in xenografted tumors. We therefore sought to examine its role in prostate carcinogenesis in greater detail.
We examined the effect of miR-301a expression on biochemical recurrence and metastasis among 585 men treated with radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. We examined the mechanism of growth deregulation by miR-301a in prostate cancer cells using analysis of the miRome of prostate cancer cell lines, quantitative PCR, and Western blotting.
High levels of miR-301a (above the median) were associated with an increased risk of biochemical recurrence (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06-1.90, P = 0.002) but not of metastasis (aHR 0.84, 95%CI 0.41-1.70, P = 0.6) after adjustment for known prognostic factors. RNA transcriptome sequencing analysis of miR-301a overexpressing prostate cancer cell lines identified the tumor suppressor p63 as a potential direct miR-301a target. Transcriptome sequencing, qPCR and Western blotting showed that miR-301a induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in prostate cancer cells through a pathway initiated by p63 inhibition. Luciferase assay verified p63 as a direct target of miR-301a. Loss of p63 resulted in miR-205 downregulation, releasing Zeb1 and Zeb2 from inhibition, culminating in Zeb1/Zeb2 suppression of E-cadherin. This pathway of growth alteration mediated by miR-301a upregulation was shown to be valid in prostate cancer cell lines and patient-derived tumors.
These data indicate that miR-301a functions as an oncogene in prostate cancer by directly targeting the p63 tumor suppressor leading to loss of E-cadherin and EMT. Hence, miR-301a may serve as a novel biomarker in prostate cancer as well as a therapeutic target for prostate cancer management. Prostate 76:869-884, 2016. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
Vespa mandarinia found in the forests of East Asia, including Korea, occupies the highest rank in the arthropod food web within its geographical range. It serves as a source of nutrition in the form of Vespa amino acid mixture and is listed as a threatened species, although no conservation measures have been implemented. Here, we performed de novo assembly of the V. mandarinia transcriptome by Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencing. Over 60 million raw reads and 59,184,811 clean reads were obtained. After assembly, a total of 66,837 unigenes were clustered, 40,887, 44,455, and 22,390 of which showed homologous matches against the PANM, Unigene, and KOG databases, respectively. A total of 15,675 unigenes were assigned to Gene Ontology terms, and 5,132 unigenes were mapped to 115 KEGG pathways. The zinc finger domain (C2H2-like), serine/threonine/dual specificity protein kinase domain, and RNA recognition motif domain were among the top InterProScan domains predicted for V. mandarinia sequences. Among the unigenes, we identified 534,922 cDNA simple sequence repeats as potential markers. This is the first transcriptomic analysis of the wasp V. mandarinia using Illumina HiSeq 4000. The obtained datasets should promote the search for new genes to understand the physiological attributes of this wasp. 
TGFβ is a known driver of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) which is associated with tumor aggressiveness and metastasis. However, EMT has not been fully explored in clinical specimens of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) metastases. To assess EMT in CRPC, gene expression analysis was performed on 149 visceral and bone metastases from 62 CRPC patients and immunohistochemical analysis was performed on 185 CRPC bone and visceral metastases from 42 CRPC patients. In addition, to assess the potential of metastases to seed further metastases the mitochondrial genome was sequenced at different metastatic sites in one patient. TGFβ was increased in bone versus visceral metastases. While primarily cytoplasmic; nuclear and cytoplasmic Twist were significantly higher in bone than in visceral metastases. Slug and Zeb1 were unchanged, with the exception of nuclear Zeb1 being significantly higher in visceral metastases. Importantly, nuclear Twist, Slug, and Zeb1 were only present in a subset of epithelial cells that had an EMT-like phenotype. Underscoring the relevance of EMT-like cells, mitochondrial sequencing revealed that metastases could seed additional metastases in the same patient. In conclusion, while TGFβ expression and EMT-associated protein expression is present in a considerable number of CRPC visceral and bone metastases, nuclear Twist, Slug, and Zeb1 localization and an EMT-like phenotype (elongated nuclei and cytoplasmic compartment) was only present in a small subset of CRPC bone metastases. Mitochondrial sequencing from different metastases in a CRPC patient provided evidence for the seeding of metastases from previously established metastases, highlighting the biological relevance of EMT-like behavior in CRPC metastases.
Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) is a zinc-finger transcription factor that regulates many essential processes, including development and cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Along with these roles in normal cells and tissues, KLF4 has important tumor suppressive and oncogenic functions in some malignancies. However, the roles of KLF4 in oral squamous cell carcinoma remain unclear. This study investigated the epigenetic alterations and possible roles of KLF4 in oral cancer carcinogenesis. Notably, KLF4 expression was significantly decreased in human oral cancer tissues compared with healthy controls, and KLF4 promoter hypermethylation contributed to the suppression of KLF4 expression. KLF4 expression was associated with tumor grade. Its expression was much lower in poorly differentiated oral cancers than in well-differentiated cancer cells. KLF4 exerted its antitumor activity in vitro and/or in vivo by inhibiting cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, cell colony formation and by inducing apoptosis. In addition, KLF4 over-expression promoted oral cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro. Knockdown of KLF4 promoted oral cancer cells growth and colony formation, and simultaneously inhibited cell migration and invasion. Mechanistic studies revealed that MMP-9 might contribute to KLF4-mediated cell migration and invasion. These results provide evidence that KLF4 might play Janus-faced roles in oral cancer carcinogenesis, acting both as a tumor suppressor and as an oncogene. 
PRDM1 (PRDI-BF1-RIZ1 homologous domain containing 1) appears to be a pleiotropic regulatory factor in various processes. It contains a PR (PRDI-BF1-RIZ1 homologous) domain protein and five zinc fingers. In the present study, a gene coding the homolog of prdm1 and the 5' regulatory region of prdm1 was identified from the Paralichthys olivaceus (denoted Po-prdm1). Results of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction amplification (RT-qPCR) and in situ hybridization (ISH) in embryos revealed that Po-prdm1 was highly expressed between the early gastrula and tail bud stages, with its expression peaking in the mid-gastrula stage, whereas the results of RT-qPCR and ISH in tissues demonstrated that Po-prdm1 transcripts were ubiquitously detected in all tissues, which indicates its pleiotropic function in multiple processes. ISH of gonadal tissues revealed that the transcripts were located in the nucleus and cytoplasm of the oocytes in the ovaries but only in the spermatogonia and not in the spermatocytes in the testes. The Po-prdm1 transcription factor binding sites and their conserved binding region among vertebrates were analyzed in this study. The combined results suggest that Po-PRDM1 has a conserved function in teleosts and mammals. 
The post-traumatic hypertrophic scar (HS) is a fibrotic disease with excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) production by fibroblasts in response to tissue injury. Although dysregulation of miRNAs is known to be involved in a variety of pathophysiologic processes, the role of miRNA in hypertrophic scar formation is unclear. Abnormal expression of miRNA in fibrosis has been investigated in several studies. The transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) promotes fibroblasts proliferation, the synthesis of collagen and other extracellular matrix, and ultimately leads to the formation of the HS by inducing excessive deposition of ECM. We identified two miRNAs whose expression was correlated with fibrotic diseases: miR-21 and miR-200b. This study further confirmed that after stimulation with TGF-β1, the expression of miR-21 was increased, whereas the mRNA level of SMAD7 was decreased in fibroblasts. TGF-β1 reduced the expression of miR-200b, while it augmented that of Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1(Zeb1). Our experiments demonstrated that the expression of miR-21 and miR-200b are related to a disorder, and the TGF-β/miR-21/Smad7 and TGF-β/miR200b/Zeb1 pathways might participate in the pathogenesis of HS. Thus, a novel, beyond the traditional methods, approach for HS treatment via miRNA therapeutics could have been provided. 
No longer regarded as simply a storage depot, fat is a dynamic organ acting locally and systemically to modulate energy homeostasis, glucose sensitivity, insulin resistance, and inflammatory pathways. Here, mass spectrometry was used to survey the proteome of patient matched subcutaneous fat and visceral fat in 20 diabetic vs 22 nondiabetic patients with morbid obesity. A similar number of proteins (~600) were identified in each tissue type. When stratified by diabetic status, 19 and 41 proteins were found to be differentially abundant in subcutaneous fat and omentum, respectively. These proteins represent pathways known to be involved in metabolism. Five of these proteins were differentially abundant in both fat depots: moesin, 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein, protein cordon-bleu, zinc finger protein 611, and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 6B1. Three proteins, decorin, cytochrome c oxidase subunit 6B1, and 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein, were further tested for validation by western blot analysis. Investigation of the proteins reported here is expected to expand on the current knowledge of adipose tissue driven biochemistry in diabetes and obesity, with the ultimate goal of identifying clinical targets for the development of novel therapeutic interventions in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. To our knowledge, this study is the first to survey the global proteome derived from each subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue obtained from the same patient in the clinical setting of morbid obesity, with and without diabetes. It is also the largest study of diabetic vs nondiabetic patients with 42 patients surveyed.
The DNA-binding one zinc finger (Dof) family is a classic plant-specific zinc-finger transcription factor family, which is involved in many important processes, including seed maturation and germination, plant growth and development, and light responses. Investigation of the Medicago truncatula genome revealed 42 putative Dof genes, each of which holds one Dof domain. These genes were classified into four groups based on phylogenetic analysis, which are similar to the groups reported for Arabidopsis and rice. Based on genome duplication analysis, it was found that the MtDof genes were distributed on all chromosomes and had expanded through tandem gene duplication and segmental duplication events. Two main duplication regions were identified, one from tandem duplication and another from segmental duplication. By analyzing high-throughput sequencing data from M. truncatula, we found that most of the MtDof genes showed specific expression patterns in different tissues. According to cis-regulatory element analysis, these MtDof genes are regulated by different cis-acting motifs, which are important for the functional divergence of the MtDof genes in different processes. Thus, using genome-wide identification, evolution, and expression pattern analysis of the Dof genes in M. truncatula, our study provides valuable information for understanding the potential function of the Dof genes in regulating the growth and development of M. truncatula. 
The molecular mechanism underlying the lethal phenomenon of urothelial carcinoma (UC) tumor recurrence remains unresolved. Here, by methylation microarray, we identified promoter methylation of the zinc-finger protein gene, ZNF671 in bladder UC tumor tissue samples, a finding that was independently validated by bisulphite pyrosequencing in cell lines and tissue samples. Subsequent assays including treatment with epigenetic depressive agents and in vitro methylation showed ZNF671 methylation to result in its transcriptional repression. ZNF671 re-expression in UC cell lines, via ectopic expression, inhibited tumor growth and invasion, in possible conjunction with downregulation of cancer stem cell markers (c-KIT, NANOG, OCT4). Clinically, high ZNF671 methylation in UC tumor tissues (n=96; 63 bladder, 33 upper urinary tract) associated with tumor grade and poor locoregional disease-free survival. Quantitative MSP analysis in a training (n=97) and test (n=61) sets of voided urine samples from bladder UC patients revealed a sensitivity and specificity of 42%-48% and 89%-92.8%, respectively, for UC cancer detection. Moreover, combining DNA methylation of ZNF671 and 2 other genes (IRF8 and sFRP1) further increased the sensitivity to 96.2%, suggesting a possible three-gene UC biomarker. In summary, ZNF671, an epigenetically silenced novel tumor suppressor, represents a potential predictor for UC relapse and non-invasive biomarker that could assist in UC clinical decision-making. 
The phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and the zinc finger homeobox 3 (ZFHX3)/AT-motif binding factor 1 (ATBF1) genes have been established as tumor suppressor genes in prostate cancer by their frequent deletions and mutations in human prostate cancer and by the formation of mouse prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN) or tumor by their deletions in mouse prostates. However, whether ZFHX3/ATBF1 deletion together with PTEN deletion facilitates prostatic tumorigenesis is unknown. In this study, we simultaneously deleted both genes in mouse prostatic epithelia and performed histological and molecular analyses. While deletion of one Pten allele alone caused low-grade (LG) mPIN as previously reported, concurrent deletion of Zfhx3/Atbf1 promoted the progression to high-grade (HG) mPIN or early carcinoma. Zfhx3/Atbf1 and Pten deletions together increased cell proliferation, disrupted the smooth muscle layer between epithelium and stroma, and increased the number of apoptotic cells. Deletion of both genes also accelerated the activation of Akt and Erk1/2 oncoproteins. These results suggest an additive effect of ZFHX3/ATBF1 and PTEN deletions on the development and progression of prostate neoplasia. 
The herpesviral terminase complex is part of the intricate machinery that delivers a single viral genome into empty preformed capsids (encapsidation). The varicella-zoster virus (VZV) terminase components (pORF25, pORF30, and pORF45/42) have not been studied as extensively as those of herpes simplex virus 1 and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). In this study, VZV bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) were generated with small (Δ30S), medium (Δ30M), and large (Δ30L) ORF30 internal deletions. In addition, we isolated recombinant viruses with specific alanine substitutions in the putative zinc finger motif (30-ZF3A) or in a conserved region (region IX) with predicted structural similarity to the human topoisomerase I core subdomains I and II (30-IXAla, 30-620A, and 30-622A). Recombinant viruses replicated in an ORF30-complementing cell line (ARPE30) but failed to replicate in noncomplementing ARPE19 and MeWo cells. Transmission electron microscopy of 30-IXAla-, 30-620A-, and 30-622A-infected ARPE19 cells revealed only empty VZV capsids. Southern analysis showed that cells infected with parental VZV (VZVLUC) or a repaired virus (30R) contained DNA termini, whereas cells infected with Δ30L, 30-IXAla, 30-620A, or 30-622A contained little or no processed viral DNA. These results demonstrated that pORF30, specifically amino acids 619 to 624 (region IX), was required for DNA encapsidation. A luciferase-based assay was employed to assess potential intermolecular complementation between the zinc finger domain and conserved region IX. Complementation between 30-ZF3A and 30-IXAla provided evidence that distinct pORF30 domains can function independently. The results suggest that pORF30 may exist as a multimer or participate in higher-order assemblies during viral DNA encapsidation.
Antivirals with novel mechanisms of action are sought as additional therapeutic options to treat human herpesvirus infections. Proteins involved in the viral DNA encapsidation process have become promising antiviral targets. For example, letermovir is a small-molecule drug targeting HCMV terminase that is currently in phase III clinical trials. It is important to define the structural and functional characteristics of proteins that make up viral terminase complexes to identify or design additional terminase-specific compounds. The VZV ORF30 mutants described in this study represent the first VZV terminase mutants reported to date. Targeted mutations confirmed the importance of a conserved zinc finger domain found in all herpesvirus ORF30 terminase homologs but also identified a novel, highly conserved region (region IX) essential for terminase function. Homology modeling suggested that the structure of region IX is present in all human herpesviruses and thus represents a potential structurally conserved antiviral target.
Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process in which epithelial cells lose polarity and cell-to-cell contacts and acquire the migratory and invasive abilities of mesenchymal cells. These abilities are thought to be prerequisites for the establishment of endometriotic lesions. A hallmark of EMT is the functional loss of E-cadherin (CDH1) expression in epithelial cells. TWIST1, a transcription factor that represses E-cadherin transcription, is among the EMT inducers. SNAIL, a zinc-finger transcription factor, and its close relative SLUG have similar properties to TWIST1 and are thus also EMT inducers. MYC, which is upregulated by estrogens in the uterus by an estrogen response cis-acting element (ERE) in its promoter, is associated with proliferation in endometriosis. The role of EMT and proliferation in the pathogenesis of endometriosis was evaluated by analyzing TWIST1, CDH1 and MYC expression.
CDH1, TWIST1, SNAIL and SLUG mRNA expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR from 47 controls and 74 patients with endometriosis. Approximately 42 ectopic and 62 eutopic endometrial tissues, of which 30 were matched samples, were collected during the same surgical procedure. We evaluated TWIST1 and MYC protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the epithelial and stromal tissue of 69 eutopic and 90 ectopic endometrium samples, of which 49 matched samples were analyzed from the same patient. Concordant expression of TWIST1/SNAIL/SLUG and CDH1 but also of TWIST1 and MYC was analyzed.
We found that TWIST1, SNAIL and SLUG are overexpressed (p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.016 and p &lt; 0.001) in endometriosis, while CDH1 expression was concordantly reduced in these samples (p &lt; 0.001). Similar to TWIST1, the epithelial expression of MYC was also significantly enhanced in ectopic endometrium compared to eutopic tissues (p = 0.008). We found exclusive expression of either TWIST1 or MYC in the same samples (p = 0.003).
Epithelial TWIST1 is overexpressed in endometriosis and may contribute to the formation of endometriotic lesions by inducing epithelial to mesenchymal transition, as CDH1 was reduced in ectopic lesions. We found exclusive expression of either TWIST1 or MYC in the same samples, indicating that EMT and proliferation contribute independently of each other to the formation of endometriotic lesions.
The peroxisomal biogenesis disorders are autosomal recessive diseases morphologically characterised by lacking peroxisomes, biochemically by generalised deficiency of peroxisomal constituent and clinically manifested by serious health problems. Genes involved in the peroxisomal biogenesis are defined as the PEX genes encoding proteins called the peroxins. These peroxins are required for function in assembly of the peroxisomal membrane or in import of the enzymes into the peroxisomes. In this study we present a full overview of the clinical presentation, biochemical and molecular data of patient with Zellweger syndrome from Slovakia. We investigated biochemical metabolites using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The presence of causal ins/del mutations we identified by a Sanger sequencing and RFLP. We reported that the patient was a compound heterozygote for mutations in the gene PEX12: a 2-bp insertion (c.767_768dupAT) and a 2-bp deletion (c.887_888delTC). The first one mentioned is a novel mutation, which has not been reported before. Both mutations create a frameshift of the open reading frame which result a premature STOP codon and generate a complete loss of the C-terminal RING finger domain that is crucial for the correct import of proteins into peroxisomes. We found causal mutations responsible for a severe phenotype, and moreover we noted a novel mutation c.767_768dupAT that has not been reported before. The presence of mutations was studied in all family members, and the resulting data were successfully utilized for prenatal diagnosis. 
The autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene is crucial for establishing central immunological tolerance and preventing autoimmunity. Mutations in AIRE cause a rare autosomal-recessive disease, autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS-1), distinguished by multi-organ autoimmunity. We have identified multiple cases and families with mono-allelic mutations in the first plant homeodomain (PHD1) zinc finger of AIRE that followed dominant inheritance, typically characterized by later onset, milder phenotypes, and reduced penetrance compared to classical APS-1. These missense PHD1 mutations suppressed gene expression driven by wild-type AIRE in a dominant-negative manner, unlike CARD or truncated AIRE mutants that lacked such dominant capacity. Exome array analysis revealed that the PHD1 dominant mutants were found with relatively high frequency (&gt;0.0008) in mixed populations. Our results provide insight into the molecular action of AIRE and demonstrate that disease-causing mutations in the AIRE locus are more common than previously appreciated and cause more variable autoimmune phenotypes.
The goal of the present study was to quantify and correlate the contribution of the cytosolic p67(phox) subunit of NADPH oxidase 2 to mitochondrial oxidative stress in the kidneys of the Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) hypertensive rat. Whole kidney redox states were uniquely assessed using a custom-designed optical fluorescence three-dimensional cryoimager to acquire multichannel signals of the intrinsic fluorophores NADH and FAD. SS rats were compared with SS rats in which the cytosolic subunit p67(phox) was rendered functionally inactive by zinc finger nuclease mutation of the gene (SS(p67phox)-null rats). Kidneys of SS rats fed a 0.4% NaCl diet exhibited significantly (P = 0.023) lower tissue redox ratio (NADH/FAD; 1.42 ± 0.06, n = 5) than SS(p67phox)-null rats (1.64 ± 0.07, n = 5), indicating reduced levels of mitochondrial electron transport chain metabolic activity and enhanced oxidative stress in SS rats. When fed a 4.0% salt diet for 21 days, both strains exhibited significantly lower tissue redox ratios (P &lt; 0.001; SS rats: 1.03 ± 0.05, n = 9, vs. SS(p67phox)-null rats: 1.46 ± 0.04, n = 7) than when fed a 0.4% salt, but the ratio was still significantly higher in SS(p67phox) rats at the same salt level as SS rats. These results are consistent with results from previous studies that found elevated medullary interstitial fluid concentrations of superoxide and H2O2 in the medulla of SS rats. We conclude that the p67(phox) subunit of NADPH oxidase 2 plays an important role in the excess production of ROS from mitochondria in the renal medulla of the SS rat. 
GLI2 is a zinc-finger transcription factor involved in the Sonic Hedgehog pathway. Gli2 mutant mice have hypoplastic anterior and absent posterior pituitary glands. We reviewed the literature for patients with hypopituitarism and alterations in GLI2. Twenty-five patients (16 families) had heterozygous truncating mutations, and the phenotype frequently included GH deficiency, a small anterior pituitary lobe and an ectopic/undescended posterior pituitary lobe on magnetic resonance imaging and postaxial polydactyly. The inheritance pattern was autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. The mutation was frequently inherited from an asymptomatic parent. Eleven patients had heterozygous non-synonymous GLI2 variants that were classified as variants of unknown significance, because they were either absent from or had a frequency lower than 0.001 in the databases. In these patients, the posterior pituitary was also ectopic, but none had polydactyly. A third group of variants found in patients with hypopituitarism were considered benign because their frequency was ≥ 0.001 in the databases. GLI2 is a large and polymorphic gene, and sequencing may identify variants whose interpretation may be difficult. Incomplete penetrance implies in the participation of other genetic and/or environmental factors. An interaction between Gli2 mutations and prenatal ethanol exposure has been demonstrated in mice dysmorphology. In conclusion, a relatively high frequency of GLI2 mutations and variants were identified in patients with congenital GH deficiency without other brain defects, and most of these patients presented with combined pituitary hormone deficiency and an ectopic posterior pituitary lobe. Future studies may clarify the relative role and frequency of GLI2 alterations in the aetiology of hypopituitarism.
The mechanisms underlying human natural killer (NK) cell phenotypic and functional heterogeneity are unknown. Here, we describe the emergence of diverse subsets of human NK cells selectively lacking expression of signaling proteins after human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. The absence of B and myeloid cell-related signaling protein expression in these NK cell subsets correlated with promoter DNA hypermethylation. Genome-wide DNA methylation patterns were strikingly similar between HCMV-associated adaptive NK cells and cytotoxic effector T cells but differed from those of canonical NK cells. Functional interrogation demonstrated altered cytokine responsiveness in adaptive NK cells that was linked to reduced expression of the transcription factor PLZF. Furthermore, subsets of adaptive NK cells demonstrated significantly reduced functional responses to activated autologous T cells. The present results uncover a spectrum of epigenetically unique adaptive NK cell subsets that diversify in response to viral infection and have distinct functional capabilities compared to canonical NK cell subsets.
Both transgenic as well as traditional breeding approaches have not been completely successful in inducting resistance against geminiviruses in crop plants. This demands the utilization of non-viral, non-plant compounds possessing antiviral characteristics as an alternate and effective strategy for developing durable resistance against geminiviruses. In recent years, several antiviral molecules have been developed for the treatment of plant virus infections. These molecular antiviral compounds target various geminiviral-DNA and -protein via interacting with them or by cleaving viral RNA fragments. Applications of these proteins such as GroEL, g5g and VirE2 have also provided a convincing evidence of resistance against geminiviruses. Taking advantage of this information, we can generate robust resistance against geminiviruses in diverse crop plants. In this context, the present review provides epigrammatic information on these antiviral compounds and their mode of action in modulating virus infection. 
The initiation and maintenance of a malignant phenotype requires complex and synergistic interactions of multiple oncogenic signals. The Hedgehog (HH)/GLI pathway has been implicated in a variety of cancer entities and targeted pathway inhibition is of therapeutic relevance. Signal cross-talk with other cancer pathways including PI3K/AKT modulates HH/GLI signal strength and its oncogenicity. In this study, we addressed the role of HH/GLI and its putative interaction with the PI3K/AKT cascade in the initiation and maintenance of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Using transgenic mouse models, we show that B-cell-specific constitutive activation of HH/GLI signaling either at the level of the HH effector and drug target Smoothened or at the level of the GLI transcription factors does not suffice to initiate a CLL-like phenotype characterized by the accumulation of CD5(+) B cells in the lymphatic system and peripheral blood. Furthermore, Hh/Gli activation in Pten-deficient B cells with activated Pi3K/Akt signaling failed to enhance the expansion of leukemic CD5(+) B cells, suggesting that genetic or epigenetic alterations leading to aberrant HH/GLI signaling in B cells do not suffice to elicit a CLL-like phenotype in mice. By contrast, we identify a critical role of GLI and PI3K signaling for the survival of human primary CLL cells. We show that combined targeting of GLI and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling can have a synergistic therapeutic effect in cells from a subgroup of CLL patients, thereby providing a basis for the evaluation of future combination therapies targeting HH/GLI and PI3K signaling in this common hematopoietic malignancy. 
Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) is a key signaling adaptor molecule for tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily and Toll-like receptor/interleukin-1 receptor family members. It signals the upstream receptors and is involved in a wide range of biological functions, such as immunity and bone metabolism. In this report, the TRAF6 gene from the pearl oyster Pinctada martensii (designated as PmTRAF6) was identified and characterized. The obtained full-length PmTRAF6 cDNA was 2273 bp, containing a 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of 297 bp, a 3'-UTR of 128 bp with a 42-bp poly (A) tail, and an open reading frame of 1848 bp that encoded 616-amino acid residues. The deduced protein sequence of PmTRAF6 contained a conserved TRAF family motif including a RING-type zinc finger, two TRAF-type zinc fingers, and a coiled-coil region followed by one meprin and TRAF homology domain. Multiple-sequence alignment indicated that TRAF6 was highly conserved among species, and PmTRAF6 showed 53% sequence identity to Azumapecten farreri and Mizuhopecten yessoensis. Furthermore, an amino acid sequence containing a low-complexity region was inserted in the TRAF6s from mollusk. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that PmTRAF6 was constitutively expressed in all tissues studied, with the most abundant mRNA expression in hepatopancreas and gill in P. martensii. After lipopolysaccharide stimulation, the expression of PmTRAF6 mRNA was dramatically upregulated. These results suggested that the obtained PmTRAF6 was a member of the TRAF6 family and perhaps involved in the innate immune response of pearl oyster.
Pleomorphic carcinoma (PC) of the lung is a rare epithelial tumor. The clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic factors of PC are controversial. The information on the ZEB1 gene, which crucially impacts survival of patients with other malignant tumors, is limited for PC.
Clinicopathological characteristics of 62 patients with PC were investigated in this study. Associations between immunohistochemical expression of ZEB1 and clinical factors, including patient prognosis, were examined. The patient population consisted of 51 (82.2%) men and 11 (17.8%) women, with a mean age of 65.5 years (range, 31-81 years).
The overall survival rate of the 42 patients, for whom follow-up was available, was 68.3% at 5 years. Using TNM criteria, 7 (11.3%), 11 (17.7%), 3 (4.8%), 21 (33.8%), 15 (24.2%), 2 (3.2%), and 3 (4.8%) patients were classified under pathological stage IA, IB, IIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIB and IV carcinomas, respectively. Fifteen (24.1%) patients had tumors consisting entirely of spindle and giant cells (PC component). The other 47 (75.8%) cancers contained additional carcinoma components (i.e., adenocarcinoma (34/62, 54.8%), squamous cell carcinoma (7/62, 11.3%), adenosquamous carcinoma (4/62, 6.5%) and large cell carcinoma (2/62, 3.2%)). Four of 7 (57.1%) stage IA (&lt;20mm) tumors consisted only of spindle and giant cells. ZEB1 expression was observed only in the PC component. Diffuse expression of ZEB1, was defined as positive nuclear staining in ≥75% of cancer cells, and was found in the PC component in 12 patients. Multivariate analysis revealed that lymph node metastasis, pleural invasion, and diffuse ZEB1 expression in the PC component predicted poorer disease-specific survival (p=0.007, 0.022, and 0.016, respectively).
This is the first report to indicate that ZEB1 may be used as an immunohistochemical prognosticator of PC, which may be useful for histological assessment of PC in biopsy and surgical specimens.
Cancer cachexia is a progressive metabolic disorder that results in depletion of adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. A growing body of literature suggests that maintaining adipose tissue mass in cachexia may improve quality-of-life and survival outcomes. Studies of lipid metabolism in cachexia, however, have generally focused on later stages of the disorder when severe loss of adipose tissue has already occurred. Here, we investigated lipid metabolism in adipose, liver and muscle tissues during early stage cachexia - before severe fat loss - in the colon-26 murine model of cachexia. White adipose tissue mass in cachectic mice was moderately reduced (34-42%) and weight loss was less than 10% of initial body weight in this study of early cachexia. In white adipose depots of cachectic mice, we found evidence of enhanced protein kinase A - activated lipolysis which coincided with elevated total energy expenditure and increased expression of markers of brown (but not white) adipose tissue thermogenesis and the acute phase response. Total lipids in liver and muscle were unchanged in early cachexia while markers of fatty oxidation were increased. Many of these initial metabolic responses contrast with reports of lipid metabolism in later stages of cachexia. Our observations suggest intervention studies to preserve fat mass in cachexia should be tailored to the stage of cachexia. Our observations also highlight a need for studies that delineate the contribution of cachexia stage and animal model to altered lipid metabolism in cancer cachexia and identify those that most closely mimic the human condition. 
Tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) is a crucial docking molecule for TNFR superfamily and Interleukin-1 receptor/Toll-like receptor (IL-1R/TLR) superfamily. As an adaptor protein in pathogen-induced signaling cascades, TRAF6 modulates both adaptive- and innate-immunity. In order to understand the immune responses of teleost TRAF6, Oplegnathus fasciatus TRAF6-like gene (OfTRAF6) was identified and characterized. Genomic length of OfTRAF6 (4 kb), obtained by means of a genomic BAC library, spanned seven exons which represented a putative coding sequence of 1716 bp and encoded 571 amino acids (aa) with an estimated molecular weight of 64 kDa. This putative protein demonstrated the classical tetra-domain architecture composed of a zinc finger RING-type profile, two zinc finger TRAF-type profiles, a coiled-coil region and a MATH domain. While the sequence similarity with human TRAF6 was 66.5%, OfTRAF6 shared a higher overall similarity with teleost homologs (∼75-92%). Phylogeny of TRAF-family was examined and TRAF6-subfamily appeared to be the precursor of other subfamilies. In addition, the clustering pattern confirmed that OfTRAF6 is a novel member of TRAF6subfamily. Based on comparative genomic analysis, we found that vertebrate TRAF6 exhibits two distinct structures in teleost and tetrapod lineages. An intron-loss event has probably occurred in TRAF6 gene during the evolution of tetrapods from teleosts. Inspection of putative OfTRAF6 promoter revealed the presence of several immune responsive transcription factor binding sites. Real-time qPCR assay detected OfTRAF6 transcripts in eleven juvenile fish tissues with higher levels in peripheral blood cells followed by liver. Putative role of OfTRAF6 in response to flagellin, LPS, poly I:C, pathogenic bacteria (Edwardsiella tarda and Streptococcus iniae) and rock bream iridovirus (RBIV) was profiled in different tissues and OfTRAF6 revealed up-regulated transcript levels. Altogether, these findings implicate that OfTRAF6 is not only involved in flagellin-induced signaling cascade, but also contributes to the antibacterial- and antiviral-responses. 
The ZFX (zinc finger protein, X-linked) gene located on the human X chromosome controls the self-renewal of embryonic and hematopoietic stem cells as a transcriptional regulator. Recently, studies have affirmed that ZFX is associated with several human cancers, including lymphoma, laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, and liver cancer, which suggests ZFX as a potential therapeutic target in cancer. However, the functional role of ZFX in human renal cancer remains unclear. Herein, we detected the expression of ZFX in 42 patients with renal cancer and found the expression of ZFX was specifically upregulated in cancer tissues at the mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, we employed lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to knock down ZFX expression in two human renal cell carcinoma cell lines, 786-0 and ACHN. Functional analysis indicated that ZFX silencing significantly inhibited renal cell carcinoma cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, probably because of suppression of CDK4 and cyclin D1, and induced apoptosis via activation of Bax, Caspase 3, and PUMA in a p53-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that knockdown of ZFX by shRNA may be a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of renal cancer. 
Reprogramming of somatic cells has great potential to provide therapeutic treatments for a number of diseases as well as provide insight into mechanisms underlying early embryonic development. Improvement of induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) generation through mRNA-based methods is currently an area of intense research. This approach provides a number of advantages over previously used methods such as DNA integration and insertional mutagenesis. Using transfection of specifically synthesized mRNAs of various pluripotency factors, we generated iPSCs from mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells. The genetic, epigenetic and functional properties of the iPSCs were evaluated at different times during the reprogramming process. We successfully introduced synthesized mRNAs, which localized correctly inside the cells and exhibited efficient and stable translation into proteins. Our work demonstrated a robust up-regulation and a gradual promoter de-methylation of the pluripotency markers, including non-transfected factors such as Nanog, SSEA-1 (stage-specific embryonic antigen 1) and Rex-1 (ZFP-42, zinc finger protein 42). Using embryonic stem cells (ESCs) conditions to culture the iPS cells resulted in formation of ES-like colonies after approximately 12 days with only five daily repeated transfections. The colonies were positive for alkaline phosphatase and pluripotency-specific markers associated with ESCs. This study revealed the ability of pluripotency induction and generation of mouse mRNA induced pluripotent stem cells (mRNA iPSCs) using transfection of specifically synthesized mRNAs of various pluripotency factors into mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells. These generated iPSCs exhibited molecular and functional properties similar to ESCs, which indicate that this method is an efficient and viable alternative to ESCs and can be used for further biological, developmental and therapeutic investigations. 
FAAP20 is an integral component of the Fanconi anemia core complex that mediates the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks. The ubiquitin-binding capacity of the FAAP20 UBZ is required for recruitment of the Fanconi anemia complex to interstrand DNA crosslink sites and for interaction with the translesion synthesis machinery. Although the UBZ-ubiquitin interaction is thought to be exclusively encapsulated within the ββα module of UBZ, we show that the FAAP20-ubiquitin interaction extends beyond such a canonical zinc-finger motif. Instead, ubiquitin binding by FAAP20 is accompanied by transforming a disordered tail C-terminal to the UBZ of FAAP20 into a rigid, extended β-loop that latches onto the complex interface of the FAAP20 UBZ and ubiquitin, with the invariant C-terminal tryptophan emanating toward I44(Ub) for enhanced binding specificity and affinity. Substitution of the C-terminal tryptophan with alanine in FAAP20 not only abolishes FAAP20-ubiquitin binding in vitro, but also causes profound cellular hypersensitivity to DNA interstrand crosslink lesions in vivo, highlighting the indispensable role of the C-terminal tail of FAAP20, beyond the compact zinc finger module, toward ubiquitin recognition and Fanconi anemia complex-mediated DNA interstrand crosslink repair. 
The capability to conditionally inactivate gene function is essential for understanding the molecular basis of development. In gene and mRNA targeting approaches, protein products can perdure, complicating genetic analysis. Current methods for selective protein degradation require drug treatment or take hours for protein removal, limiting their utility in studying rapid developmental processes in vivo. Here, we repurpose an endogenous protein degradation system to rapidly remove targeted C. elegans proteins. We show that upon expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase substrate-recognition subunit ZIF-1, proteins tagged with the ZF1 zinc-finger domain can be quickly degraded in all somatic cell types examined with temporal and spatial control. We demonstrate that genes can be engineered to become conditional loss-of-function alleles by introducing sequences encoding the ZF1 tag into endogenous loci. Finally, we use ZF1 tagging to establish the site of cdc-42 gene function during a cell invasion event. ZF1 tagging provides a powerful new tool for the analysis of dynamic developmental events.
Insulators functionally separate active chromatin domains from inactive ones. The insulator factor, CTCF, has been found to bind to boundaries and to mediate insulator function. CTCF binding sites are depleted for the histone modification H3K27me3 and are enriched for the histone variant H3.3. In order to determine whether demethylation of H3K27me3 and H3.3 incorporation are a requirement for CTCF binding at domain boundaries or whether CTCF causes these changes, we made use of the LacI DNA binding domain to control CTCF binding by the Lac inducer IPTG. Here we show that, in contrast to the related factor CTCFL, the N-terminus plus zinc finger domain of CTCF is sufficient to open compact chromatin rapidly. This is preceded by incorporation of the histone variant H3.3, which thereby removes the H3K27me3 mark. This demonstrates the causal role for CTCF in generating the chromatin features found at insulators. Thereby, spreading of a histone modification from one domain through the insulator into the neighbouring domain is inhibited. 
Oncolytic virotherapy is a growing treatment modality that uses replicating viruses as selective antineoplastic agents. Safety and efficacy considerations dictate that an ideal oncolytic agent would discriminate between normal and cancer cells on the basis of common genetic abnormalities in human cancers. Here, we identify a naturally occurring alphavirus (M1) as a novel selective killer targeting zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP)-deficient cancer cells. In vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo studies showed potent oncolytic efficacy and high tumor tropism of M1. We showed that the selectivity depends on ZAP deficiency by systematic identification. A large-scale multicenter pathology study using tissue microarrays reveals that ZAP is commonly deficient in human cancers, suggesting extensive application prospects for M1. Additionally, M1 killed cancer cells by inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis. Our report provides novel insights into potentially personalized cancer therapy using oncolytic viruses. 
ZNF509 is unique among POK family proteins in that four isoforms are generated by alternative splicing. Short ZNF509 (ZNF509S1, -S2 and -S3) isoforms contain one or two out of the seven zinc-fingers contained in long ZNF509 (ZNF509L). Here, we investigated the functions of ZNF509 isoforms in response to DNA damage, showing isoforms to be induced by p53. Intriguingly, to inhibit proliferation of HCT116 and HEK293 cells, we found that ZNF509L activates p21/CDKN1A transcription, while ZNF509S1 induces RB. ZNF509L binds to the p21/CDKN1A promoter either alone or by interacting with MIZ-1 to recruit the co-activator p300 to activate p21/CDKN1A transcription. In contrast, ZNF509S1 binds to the distal RB promoter to interact and interfere with the MIZF repressor, resulting in derepression and transcription of RB. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that ZNF509 is highly expressed in normal epithelial cells, but was completely repressed in tumor tissues of the colon, lung and skin, indicating a possible role as a tumor suppressor. 
ZAT12 a C2H2-zinc-finger protein is an abiotic stress-responsive transcription factor in plants having less information about their structure. Transcription analysis proved that ZAT12 transcripts over-expressed during drought, heat and salt stress conditions which led to an interest in 3-D structural studies of ZAT12in Brassica carinata. Over-expression of BcZAT12 in transformed tomato plants under abiotic stresses, suggest role of ZAT12 in conferring stress-tolerance in tomato. Sequence analysis of ZAT12 protein (Accession No. ABB55254.1) from B. carinata revealed it as a 161 amino acid long protein with short conserved motif (140)LDLXL(144) in C-terminal, a leucine rich L-Box with-(14)EXXAXCLXXL(23) motif in N-terminal region and presence of two conserved Zinc-Finger motifs "CXXCXXXXXXXQALGGHXXXH" between positions 42-62 and 85-105. The two zinc finger motifs have presence of two conserved glutamic acid (Glu) and phenylalanine (Phe) residues. Two methionine (Met) residues at position 94 and 102 present in ZF-motif-2 were absent in ZF-motif-1. The (94)Met and (97)Ala in ZF-motif-2 were found to be replaced by serine (Ser) in ZF-motif-1. Homology and ab initio structural modeling of ZAT12 encoded BcZAT12 protein of B. carinata resulted in robust 3-D models and were evaluated for structural motifs, associated GO terms and protein-DNA interactions. The BcZAT12 protein model, was of good quality, reliable, stable and is deposited in PMDB database (PMDB ID: PM0078213). BcZAT12 is annotated as an intracellular protein having molecular function in Zn-binding which in turn regulates signal transduction/translation processes in response to abiotic stresses in plants. Results suggest BcZAT12 protein to interact directly with one strand of dsDNA via electrostatic and H-bonds. 
The c-MYC (MYC afterward) oncogene is well known for driving numerous oncogenic programs. However, MYC can also induce apoptosis and this function of MYC warrants further clarification. We report here that a clinically relevant proteasome inhibitor significantly increases MYC protein levels and that endogenous MYC is necessary for the induction of apoptosis. This kind of MYC-induced cell death is mediated by enhanced expression of the pro-apoptotic BCL2 family members NOXA and BIM. Quantitative promoter-scanning chromatin immunoprecipitations (qChIP) further revealed binding of MYC to the promoters of NOXA and BIM upon proteasome inhibition, correlating with increased transcription. Both promoters are further characterized by the presence of tri-methylated lysine 4 of histone H3, marking active chromatin. We provide evidence that in our apoptosis models cell death occurs independently of p53 or ARF. Furthermore, we demonstrate that recruitment of MYC to the NOXA as well as to the BIM gene promoters depends on MYC's interaction with the zinc finger transcription factor EGR1 and an EGR1-binding site in both promoters. Our study uncovers a novel molecular mechanism by showing that the functional cooperation of MYC with EGR1 is required for bortezomib-induced cell death. This observation may be important for novel therapeutic strategies engaging the inherent pro-death function of MYC. 
Artificial transcription factors (ATFs) and genomic nucleases based on a DNA binding platform consisting of multiple zinc finger domains are currently being developed for clinical applications. However, no genome-wide investigations into their binding specificity have been performed. We have created six-finger ATFs to target two different 18 nt regions of the human SOX2 promoter; each ATF is constructed such that it contains or lacks a super KRAB domain (SKD) that interacts with a complex containing repressive histone methyltransferases. ChIP-seq analysis of the effector-free ATFs in MCF7 breast cancer cells identified thousands of binding sites, mostly in promoter regions; the addition of an SKD domain increased the number of binding sites ∼ 5-fold, with a majority of the new sites located outside of promoters. De novo motif analyses suggest that the lack of binding specificity is due to subsets of the finger domains being used for genomic interactions. Although the ATFs display widespread binding, few genes showed expression differences; genes repressed by the ATF-SKD have stronger binding sites and are more enriched for a 12 nt motif. Interestingly, epigenetic analyses indicate that the transcriptional repression caused by the ATF-SKD is not due to changes in active histone modifications.
Patulin is a mycotoxin that is found mainly in apple products and causes symptoms such as bleeding from the digestive tract and diarrhea. Efforts to elucidate the mechanism of its toxicity have focused on protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), which regulate the function of tight junctions (TJs) in colon epithelial cells. Patulin reacts with the conserved cysteine residues in the catalytic domains of PTP isoforms. Treatment of Caco-2 human colon cancer cells, used as a colon epithelial model, with 50 µM patulin decreased the level of density-enhanced phosphatase-1 (DEP-1) protein to 30% of the control level after 6 h. The level of DEP-1 mRNA was also decreased during 24 h after treatment with patulin. Moreover, knockdown of DEP-1 increased the level of phosphorylated claudin-4. Destruction of TJs by patulin treatment was observed by immunostaining with an antibody against zonula occludens (ZO)-1. To better understand the mechanistic basis of the decrease in DEP-1 mRNA levels, we searched for a cis-element upstream of the DEP-1 gene and found an element responsive to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) protein. Using a PPARγ-specific antibody, we showed a decrease in PPARγ abundance to 42% of the control level within 6 h after treatment with patulin. PPARγ has four cysteine residues that are involved in zinc finger formation. Our data suggest that DEP-1 affects TJ function and that PPARγ might control DEP-1 expression. Therefore, the toxicity of patulin to cellular functions might be attributable to its ability to down-regulate the expression of DEP-1 and PPARγ. 
The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 3 family of protein is critical for the EBV-induced primary B-cell growth transformation process. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen we identified 22 novel cellular partners of the EBNA3s. Most importantly, among the newly identified partners, five are known to play direct and important roles in transcriptional regulation. Of these, the Myc-interacting zinc finger protein-1 (MIZ-1) is a transcription factor initially characterized as a binding partner of MYC. MIZ-1 activates the transcription of a number of target genes including the cell cycle inhibitor CDKN2B. Focusing on the EBNA3A/MIZ-1 interaction we demonstrate that binding occurs in EBV-infected cells expressing both proteins at endogenous physiological levels and that in the presence of EBNA3A, a significant fraction of MIZ-1 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Moreover, we show that a trimeric complex composed of a MIZ-1 recognition DNA element, MIZ-1 and EBNA3A can be formed, and that interaction of MIZ-1 with nucleophosmin (NPM), one of its coactivator, is prevented by EBNA3A. Finally, we show that, in the presence of EBNA3A, expression of the MIZ-1 target gene, CDKN2B, is downregulated and repressive H3K27 marks are established on its promoter region suggesting that EBNA3A directly counteracts the growth inhibitory action of MIZ-1. 
PRDM9 contributes to hybrid sterility and species evolution. However, its role is to be confirmed in cattle, a major domesticated livestock species. We previously found an association near PRDM9 with cattle recombination features, but the causative variants are still unknown. Using millions of genotyped cattle with pedigree information, we characterized five PRDM9 alleles and generated allele-specific recombination maps. By examining allele-specific recombination patterns, we observed the impact of PRDM9 on global distribution of recombination, especially in the two ends of chromosomes. We also showed strong associations between recombination hotspot regions and functional mutations within PRDM9 zinc finger domain. More importantly, we found one allele of PRDM9 to be very different from others in both protein composition and recombination landscape, indicating the causative role of this allele on the association between PRDM9 and cattle recombination. When comparing recombination maps from sperm and pedigree data, we observed similar genome-wide recombination patterns, validating the quality of pedigree-based results. Collectively, these evidence supported PRDM9 alleles as causal variants for the reported association with cattle recombination. Our study comprehensively surveyed the bovine PRDM9 alleles, generated allele-specific recombination maps, and expanded our understanding of the role of PRDM9 on genome distribution of recombination.
Zinc finger-like protein that regulates apoptosis (Zfra) is a naturally occurring 31-amino-acid protein. Synthetic peptides Zfra1-31 and Zfra4-10 are known to effectively block the growth of many types of cancer cells.
Ten-month-old triple-transgenic (3×Tg) mice for Alzheimer's disease (AD) received synthetic Zfra peptides via tail vein injections, followed by examining restoration of memory deficits.
Zfra significantly downregulated TRAPPC6AΔ, SH3GLB2, tau, and amyloid β (Αβ) aggregates in the brains of 3×Tg mice and effectively restored their memory capabilities. Zfra inhibited melanoma-induced neuronal death in the hippocampus and plaque formation in the cortex. Mechanistically, Zfra blocked the aggregation of amyloid β 42 and many serine-containing peptides in vitro, suppressed tumor necrosis factor-mediated NF-κB activation, and bound cytosolic proteins for accelerating their degradation in ubiquitin/proteasome-independent manner.
Zfra peptides exhibit a strong efficacy in blocking tau aggregation and amyloid Αβ formation and restore memory deficits in 3×Tg mice, suggesting its potential for treatment of AD.
Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays important roles in the migration, invasion, and metastasis of cancer cells. However, the role of Src in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced EMT and migration in gastric cancer cells remains to be clarified. In the current study, the effect of Src on EGF-stimulated EMT and migration was explored in gastric cancer cells. EGF induced EMT in gastric cancer cells and increased their migratory ability, which was accompanied by the phosphorylation of Src. PP2, the Src inhibitor, markedly suppressed EGF-mediated EMT and migration in gastric cancer cells. Additionally, EGF-stimulated upregulation of zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) and zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) was significantly repressed by PP2. Further analysis showed that EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of protein kinase B (AKT) was almost completely abolished by PP2, whereas that of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was only mildly suppressed. Moreover, LY294002, the AKT inhibitor, significantly inhibited EGF-induced upregulation of ZEB1 and ZEB2 as well as EMT and migration stimulated by EGF in gastric cancer cells. However, neither ERK inhibitor nor STAT3 inhibitor repressed EGF-induced EMT-related changes. Taken together, these results suggest that Src promotes EGF-stimulated EMT and migration by upregulation of ZEB1 and ZEB2 through AKT signaling pathway in gastric cancer cells.
To explore the mechanism of Ezhu-containing serum in inhibiting the expression of sonic hedgehog(Shh) and glioma-associated oncogene homolog-1(Gli1) in hepatic stellate cells(HSCs) induced by leptin. Twenty sprague-dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into 2 groups (n=10), and given Ezhu-decoction and physiological saline by gavage for 10 days to prepare drug-containing serums. The HSCs during the exponential growth phase were divided into 7 groups： blank control group, model group, hedgehog pathway inhibitor(cyclopamine) group, Ezhu group, Ezhu and cyclopamine group, hedgehog pathway agonost(pumorphamine) group, Ezhu and purmorphamine group. HSCs were cultured in vitro and induced with 100 μg•L ⁻¹ leptin(except for the blank control group), then treated separately with the corresponding drugs for 24 hours. After the cells were collected, HSCs proliferation was detected using MTT colorimetric assay; the expressions of Shh and Gli1 were determined by PT-PCR, Western blot and immunofluorescence, respectively. The expressions of Shh and Gli1 were significantly increased after the HSCs of rats were induced by leptin (compared with the blank control group, P&lt;0.01). After being interfered with Hh pathway inhibitor (cyclopamine) and Ezhu-containing serum, the expressions of Shh and Gli1 were decreased significantly(compared with the model group, P&lt;0.01). After Ezhu-containing serum was used to interfere the Hh pathway inhibitor group, the mRNA and protein expressions of Shh and Gli1 were decreased significantly(compared with the model group, P&lt;0.01). After Ezhu-containing serum was used to interfere the purmorphamine group, the mRNA and protein expressions of Shh and Gli1 decreased significantly(compared with the purmorphamine group, P&lt;0.01). Ezhu-containing serum plays an important role in inhibiting HSCs activation by taking part in hedgehog signaling pathway, so as to regulate the expression of Shh and Gli1 in leptin-induced HSCs and then inhibit liver fibrosis.
The bromodomain adjacent to zinc finger domain protein 2A (BAZ2A) is implicated in aggressive prostate cancer. The BAZ2A bromodomain is a challenging target because of the shallow pocket of its natural ligand, the acetylated side chain of lysine. Here, we report the successful screening of a library of nearly 1500 small molecules by high-throughput docking and force field-based binding-energy evaluation. For seven of the 20 molecules selected in silico, evidence of binding to the BAZ2A bromodomain is provided by ligand-observed NMR spectroscopy. Two of these compounds show a favorable ligand efficiency of 0.42 kcal/mol per non-hydrogen atom in a competition-binding assay. The crystal structures of the BAZ2A bromodomain in complex with four fragment hits validate the predicted binding modes. The binding modes of compounds 1 and 3 are compatible with ligand growing for optimization of affinity for BAZ2A and selectivity against the close homologue BAZ2B.
Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are known to home to sites of tumor microenvironments where they participate in the formation of the tumor microenvironment and to interplay with tumor cells. However, the potential functional effects of MSCs on tumor cell growth are controversial. Here, we, from the view of bone marrow MSC-derived exosomes, study the molecular mechanism of MSCs on the growth of human osteosarcoma and human gastric cancer cells.
MSCs derived from human bone marrow (hBMSCs) were isolated and cultured in complete DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% exosome-depleted fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin, cell culture supernatants containing exosomes were harvested and exosome purification was performed by ultracentrifugation. Osteosarcoma (MG63) and gastric cancer (SGC7901) cells, respectively, were treated with hBMSC-derived exosomes in the presence or absence of a small molecule inhibitor of Hedgehog pathway. Cell viability was measured by transwell invasion assay, scratch migration assay and CCK-8 test. The expression of the signaling molecules Smoothened, Patched-1, Gli1 and the ligand Shh were tested by western blot and RT-PCR.
In this study, we found that hBMSC-derived exosomes promoted MG63 and SGC7901 cell growth through the activation of Hedgehog signaling pathway. Inhibition of Hedgehog signaling pathway significantly suppressed the process of hBMSC-derived exosomes on tumor growth.
Our findings demonstrated the new roles of hedgehog signaling pathway in the hBMSCs-derived exosomes induced tumor progression.
Background/Amis: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a novel class of transcripts, have been shown to play critical roles in diverse cellular biological processes, including tumorigenesis. Small nucleolar RNA host gene 6 (SNHG6) regulates various biological processes in cancer cells. However, the biological role of SNHG6 in gastric cancer still remains to be explored. The aim of this study is to investigate the characteristic of the SNHG6 in gastric cancer.
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to measure the expression of SNHG6 in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines. MTT assays, colony formation assays were used to determine the impact of SNHG6 on tumorigenesis . Flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle and apoptosis was performed to measure the effect of SNHG6 on cell cycle and apoptosis rate. Transwell assay was performed to measure the effect of SNHG6 on cell migration. Western blotting and immunofuorescence were utilized to examine the effect of SNHG6 on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of GC cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), RNA-pulldown and luciferase reporter assays were employed to dissect molecular mechanisms.
In this study, we revealed that SNHG6 was overexpressed in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines. High expression levels of SNHG6 wereassociated with invasion depth, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis and tumor/node/metastasis (TNM) stage, and predicted poor prognosis. Loss-of-function assays revealed that silenced SNHG6 obviously inhibited gastric cancer cell growth, weakened cell migration capacity and suppressed the EMT processes of gastric cancer cells. Additionally, ChIP, RIP, RNA-pulldown and luciferase reporter assays evidenced that SNHG6 could epigenetically silenced p27 and could competitively sponging miR-101-3p thereby regulating zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1).
In summary, our findings demonstrated that SNHG6 acted as an oncogene in gastric cancer cells through regulating miR-101-3p/ZEB1 at a post-transcriptional level and silencing expression at a transcriptional level by recruiting enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) to the promoter of p27. SNHG6 might serve as a candidate prognostic biomarker and a target for novel therapies of gastric cancer patients.
By analyzing The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets, we discovered that the zinc finger protein 692 (ZNF692) were over-expressed in Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues (P &lt; 0.0001). In this study, we investigated the function of ZNF692 in the progression of LUAD. We found that ZNF692 knockdown inhibited LUAD cells proliferation, migration, and invasion both in vitro and in vivo. And LUAD cell apoptosis was induced following the down-regulation of ZNF692. Our results show that ZNF692 is over-expressed in LUAD tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues, and hyper-expression of ZNF692 in LUAD is an independent risk factor for worse overall survival in LUAD patients (HR: 8.800, 95%CI: 1.082-71.560, P = 0.042) by Tissue Microarray stain assay (TMA). GO analysis indicated that most genes were enriched in metabolic process which were associated highly with ZNF692 levels. Collectively, our results suggested that ZNF692 may serve as a potential oncogene and biomarker in LUAD by influencing cell metabolism.
Multidrug resistance (MDR) is largely responsible for the failure of chemotherapy. The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript (MALAT1) has been reported to be closely related to tumor biology. In the present study, whether MALAT1 contributes to the resistance of glioblastoma cell lines to temozolomide (TMZ) was investigated.
The glioblastoma cell lines U251 and U87 were exposed to increasing concentrations of TMZ to generate TMZ-resistant colonies (the U251/TMZ and U87/TMZ cell lines). The expression levels of MALAT1 and proteins related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were detected by real-time PCR and western blot, respectively. After the transfection of si-MALAT1 or pcDNA-MALAT1, cell viability, mRNA expression of MDR-associated proteins (MDR1, MRP5 and LRP1), and protein expression of EMT related proteins (ZEB1, Snail and SLUG) were evaluated.
The expression of MALAT1 was upregulated in the U251/TMZ and U87/TMZ cell lines compared to that in U251 and U87 cell lines, respectively. The treatment of si-MALAT1 decreased MDR1, MRP5, and LRP1 expression, enhanced cell sensitivity to TMZ, and downregulated ZEB1 protein expression, whereas pcDNA-MALAT1 had the opposite effects. However, the effects of si-MALAT1 on MDR -associated protein expression, cell viability, and EMT status were reversed by the transfection of pcDNA-ZEB1, and the effects of pcDNA-MALAT1 were reversed by the transfection of si-ZEB1. In vivo, MALAT1 overexpression enhanced tumors' TMZ resistance and upregulated ZEB1 expression.
MALAT1 decreased the sensitivity of resistant glioma cell lines to TMZ by regulating ZEB1.
Common polymorphic variants upstream of Zinc finger protein gene 469 (ZNF469) have been associated with central corneal thickness. Rare ZNF469 variants have been shown in keratoconus patients. The aim of the current study was to investigate the frequency of ZNF 469 gene variants in rapidly progressive advance keratoconus patients who underwent corneal transplant surgery by the age of 30, compared to their frequency in the normal Turkish population.
A search in a patient database was performed to identify patients with a rapidly progressive keratoconus requiring corneal transplant surgery by the age of 30 in at least one eye. Twenty-six advance keratoconus patients (study group) and 109 health subjects (control group) were included in the study. Blood samples were donated, and genomic DNA was extracted. The entire coding sequence of the ZNF469 gene including the 84 bp of the putative intron was amplified using PCR primers and analyzed using next generation sequencing (NGS).
Fifteen single nucleotide polymorphisms previously reported and registered to the dbSNP database were detected in the study group. The allele frequencies of these polymorphisms were higher in the keratoconus group compared to the control group and to the ExAC genome database. Three new missense heterozygote variants and one new synonym variant were detected in keratoconus group. According to prediction software, the P873T and Q2188H variants were shown to be non-tolerated, whereas G3424S could be tolerated. The synonymous variant R1060R is not predicted to lead to abnormal splicing by Human Splicing Finder in silico analysis.
New detected ZNF 469 P873T and Q2188H heterozygote coding variants in isolated advance keratoconus patients may be associated with the disease pathogenesis.
Stroke, a major cause of disability and mortality, affects someone in the United States every 40s. Stroke biomarkers, including those that could be used as a blood test for diagnosis of stroke, have been particularly elusive. We performed a double blind study to identify human plasma biomarkers for the diagnosis of stroke, including acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We utilized a three-track approach based on the total metal profile, the metal cofactor levels among metalloproteins, and the identification of stroke-related metalloproteins. The study included 14 case-control pairs of AIS and 23 case-control pairs of ICH. Controls were matched to cases based on gender, ethnicity, and age (±5 years). AIS cases were statistically higher from their respective controls for protein bound co-factors Se and Cd, while unique correlations of metal cofactor concentrations among metalloproteins were identified between Pb-W, Sr-W, Pb-V, and Cu-V. ICH cases were statistically higher from their respective controls for Se and Co cofactors, whereas Cd and Pb were statistically lower. Unique correlations between metal cofactors for ICH cases were identified between Pb-W, Sr-W, Pb-V, and Cu-V. Stroke-related metalloproteins were identified, including calpain-15, protein-activated inward rectifier potassium channel 1, tau-tubulin kinase 1, and voltage-dependent L-type calcium channel subunit beta-3. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was able to classify patients between stroke cases or controls with 93% accuracy as well as classify patients with one of the four stroke groups with 85% accuracy. Additionally, this study found utmost importance in vanadium (V) and tungsten (W) correlations for both bound and total metal concentrations, suggestive of binding to transferrin or inhibition of oxidoreductases. Future work in stroke patients will seek to quantify varying selenoproteins, including selenoprotein P and glutathione peroxidase and identified zinc finger tissue leakage proteins, and further explore the role of trace metal fluctuations with transferrin.
The purpose of this study was to determine the expression and potential clinical role of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related factors in malignant ovarian germ cell tumors (MOGCT). Protein expression of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, P-cadherin, Zeb1, HMGA2, and vimentin by immunohistochemistry was analyzed in 42 MOGCT from patients treated in Norway during the period 1981-2001. Expression was analyzed for association with clinicopathologic parameters. E-cadherin (p = 0.016) and HMGA2 (p = 0.002) expression was significantly higher in immature teratomas and yolk sac tumors compared with dysgerminomas. Vimentin (p &lt; 0.001) and Zeb1 (p = 0.029) staining was significantly higher in immature teratomas compared with yolk sac tumors and dysgerminomas, whereas no significant differences were observed for N-cadherin and P-cadherin. EMT-associated markers were not significantly related to clinicopathologic parameters including age, tumor diameter, and FIGO stage. In conclusion, based on this limited series, EMT-associated markers are not associated with clinical parameters in MOGCT, in contrast to ovarian carcinoma. EMT-related proteins are differentially expressed among various MOGCT subtypes, suggesting differences in biological characteristics associated with invasion and metastasis.
In this work, the consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae MNII/cocδBEC3 was transformed by an artificial zinc finger protein (AZFP) library to improve its thermal tolerance, and the strain MNII-AZFP with superior growth at 42°C was selected. Improved degradation of acid swollen cellulose by 45.9% led to an increase in ethanol production, when compared to the control strain. Moreover, the fermentation of Jerusalem artichoke stalk (JAS) by MNII-AZFP was shortened by 12h at 42°C with a concomitant improvement in ethanol production. Comparative transcriptomics analysis suggested that the AZFP in the mutant exerted beneficial effect by modulating the expression of multiple functional genes. These results provide a feasible strategy for efficient ethanol production from JAS and other cellulosic biomass through CBP based-fermentation at elevated temperatures.
International consensus recognises four medulloblastoma molecular subgroups: WNT (MBWNT), SHH (MBSHH), group 3 (MBGrp3), and group 4 (MBGrp4), each defined by their characteristic genome-wide transcriptomic and DNA methylomic profiles. These subgroups have distinct clinicopathological and molecular features, and underpin current disease subclassification and initial subgroup-directed therapies that are underway in clinical trials. However, substantial biological heterogeneity and differences in survival are apparent within each subgroup, which remain to be resolved. We aimed to investigate whether additional molecular subgroups exist within childhood medulloblastoma and whether these could be used to improve disease subclassification and prognosis predictions.
In this retrospective cohort study, we assessed 428 primary medulloblastoma samples collected from UK Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG) treatment centres (UK), collaborating European institutions, and the UKCCSG-SIOP-PNET3 European clinical trial. An independent validation cohort (n=276) of archival tumour samples was also analysed. We analysed samples from patients with childhood medulloblastoma who were aged 0-16 years at diagnosis, and had central review of pathology and comprehensive clinical data. We did comprehensive molecular profiling, including DNA methylation microarray analysis, and did unsupervised class discovery of test and validation cohorts to identify consensus primary molecular subgroups and characterise their clinical and biological significance. We modelled survival of patients aged 3-16 years in patients (n=215) who had craniospinal irradiation and had been treated with a curative intent.
Seven robust and reproducible primary molecular subgroups of childhood medulloblastoma were identified. MBWNT remained unchanged and each remaining consensus subgroup was split in two. MBSHH was split into age-dependent subgroups corresponding to infant (&lt;4·3 years; MBSHH-Infant; n=65) and childhood patients (≥4·3 years; MBSHH-Child; n=38). MBGrp3 and MBGrp4 were each split into high-risk (MBGrp3-HR [n=65] and MBGrp4-HR [n=85]) and low-risk (MBGrp3-LR [n=50] and MBGrp4-LR [n=73]) subgroups. These biological subgroups were validated in the independent cohort. We identified features of the seven subgroups that were predictive of outcome. Cross-validated subgroup-dependent survival models, incorporating these novel subgroups along with secondary clinicopathological and molecular features and established disease risk-factors, outperformed existing disease risk-stratification schemes. These subgroup-dependent models stratified patients into four clinical risk groups for 5-year progression-free survival: favourable risk (54 [25%] of 215 patients; 91% survival [95% CI 82-100]); standard risk (50 [23%] patients; 81% survival [70-94]); high-risk (82 [38%] patients; 42% survival [31-56]); and very high-risk (29 [13%] patients; 28% survival [14-56]).
The discovery of seven novel, clinically significant subgroups improves disease risk-stratification and could inform treatment decisions. These data provide a new foundation for future research and clinical investigations.

This study was specifically designed to confirm the hypothesis that microRNA-200c (miR-200c) affects the development of cisplatin (DDP) resistance in human gastric cancer cells by targeting zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2). A total of 50 gastric cancer tissues and their corresponding normal adjacent tissue samples were collected. Then, the expression levels of miR-200c and ZEB2 in both gastric cancer specimens and cells were detected using the quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemical methods. A dual‑luciferase reporter gene assay was conducted to evaluate the effect of miR-200c on the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) luciferase activity of ZEB2. SGC7901/DDP cells were transfected with miR-200c mimics and ZEB2 siRNA, respectively. Subsequently, changes in cellular proliferation and apoptosis were detected through the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay and flow cytometric analysis, respectively. We also carried out a western blot analysis assay in order to detect the expression of apoptosis-related genes and ZEB2. miR-200c was significantly downregulated and ZEB2 was significantly upregulated in both gastric cancer tissues and SGC7901/DDP cells when compared with those in normal tissues and SGC7901 cells (P&lt;0.01). The dual luciferase reporter gene assay showed that miR-200c could specifically bind with the 3'UTR of ZEB2 and significantly suppress the luciferase activity by 42% (P&lt;0.01). Upregulation of miR-200c or downregulation of ZEB2 enhanced the sensitivity of SGC7901/DDP cells to DDP. miR‑200c was significantly downregulated in both gastric cancer tissues and cells, while the expression of ZEB2 exhibited the opposite trend. Our study further demonstrated that miR-200c could enhance the sensitivity of SGC7901/DDP cells to DDP through targeted regulation of ZEB2 expression in gastric cancer tissues.
There is increasing recognition of the importance of early-life environmental exposures in health disorders at later-life stages. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether early-life exposure to benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) could induce neurodegenerative syndromes at later-life stages in zebrafish. Embryos were exposed to BaP at doses of 0, 0.05, 0.5, 5, and 50 nM from early embryogenesis to 96 h post-fertilization (hpf), then transferred to clean water and maintained for 365 days. We found that BaP decreased locomotor and cognitive ability, neurotransmitter levels of dopamine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and norepinephrine; and induced loss of dopaminergic neurons and resulted in neurodegeneration. Additionally, BaP increased amyloid β protein and cell apoptosis in the adult zebrafish brain. Further, DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and DNMT3a were up-regulated in 96 hpf larvae and the adult brain. MeDIP-sequencing data of the 96 hpf larvae identified 235 differentially methylated genes in promoter, with the fold change &gt; 1.5. Guanylate cyclase 2F (gucy2f) and dopamine receptor D4 related sequence (drd4-rs) were hypermethylation promoters, whereas zinc finger C4H2 domain (zc4h2) was a hypomethylation promoter in 96 hpf larvae and the adult brain. The mRNA levels of gucy2f and drd4-rs were down-regulated, and zc4h2 was up-regulated. Our findings suggested that the lasting modifications of DNA methylation were associated with neurodegenerative syndromes in adult zebrafish as a result of early-life BaP exposure.
Activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) plays a pivotal role at the center of the fibrogenic progression in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, it is poorly understood that how various molecules interact within HSCs during the progression of NASH to fibrosis. The aim of the present study is to delineate how inflammasome molecules, hedgehog signaling and autophagy provoke HSC activation using palmitic acid (PA) as a major insult.
Inflammasome activation, hedgehog signaling activity and autophagy in PA-exposed HSCs were determined to investigate their role in activation of human and rodent HSC lines or primary HSCs.
PA treatment elicited HSC activation reflected by increased mRNA levels of transforming growth factor-β1, connective tissue growth factor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 and procollagen type I (α1). In addition, expression levels of NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) and hedgehog signaling transcription factor Gli-1 were increased in PA-exposed HSCs. It's evident that PA treatment resulted in increased production of light chain 3-II and autophagosomes, as well as enhanced autophagy flux reflected by transduction of an adeno-associated viral vector. Whereas, reduced autophagy, which is often seen in the late stage of NASH, provoked inflammasome activation. Moreover, suppressing the Hh signaling pathway by LDE225 blocked production of light chain 3-II and autophagy flux.
Saturated fatty acids, such as PA, stimulate HSC activation through inflammasomes and hedgehog signaling. Meanwhile, compromised autophagy may facilitate HSC activation, implicating valuable candidates for pharmacologic intervention against the progression of fibrogenesis in NASH.
MicroRNA 144 (miR-144), a small non-coding RNA, is frequently dysregulated in human several tumour progression, but its role and the underlying mechanisms in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is poorly investigated. In the present study, the expression of miR-144 was firstly analysed in datasets derived from GSE21362 and TCGA, and then detected in HCC tissues and cell lines by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. MiR-144 was shown to be significantly down-regulated in HCC tissues and cell lines. Subsequently, overexpression of miR-144 was transfected into HCC cell lines so as to investigate its biological function, including MTT, colony formation, and transwell assays. Gain of function assay revealed miR-144 remarkably inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion. In addition, bioinformatical analysis and luciferase reporter assay identified ZFX as a novel target of miR-144 in HCC cells, as confirmed by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Furthermore, ZFX was found to be significantly up-regulated using Oncomine database analysis. Loss of function assay further indicated knockdown of ZFX had similar effects of miR-144-mediated HCC cell proliferation and invasion. Therefore, miR-144 has been demonstrated to act as a tumour suppressor in HCC cell growth and motility by directly targeting ZFX, which implicates its potential applications in the development of HCC treatment.
RNA editing generates protein diversity by altering RNA sequences in coding regions without changing the overall DNA sequence. Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing events have recently been reported in some types of cancer, but they are rare in human colorectal cancer (CRC). Therefore, this study was conducted to identify diverse RNA editing in CRC.
We compared transcriptome data of 39 CRC samples and paired adjacent tissues from The Cancer Genome Atlas database to identify RNA editing patterns in CRC, focusing on canonical A-to-I RNA edits in coding sequence regions. We investigated nonsynonymous RNA editing patterns by comparing tumor and normal tissue transcriptome data.
The number of RNA edits varied from 12 to 42 per sample. We also observed that hypoand hyper-RNA editing patterns were distinguishable within the samples. We found 10 recurrent nonsynonymous RNA editing candidates in nine genes (PDLIM, NEIL1, SRP9, GLI1, APMAP, IGFBP7, ZNF358, COPA, and ZNF587B) and validated some by Sanger sequencing and the inosine chemical erasing assay. We further showed that editing at these positions was performed by the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 enzyme. Most of these genes are hypoedited in CRC, but editing of GLI1 was increased in cancer tissues compared with normal tissues.
Our results show that nonsynonymous RNA editing patterns can be used to identify CRC patients and could serve as novel biomarkers for CRC.
