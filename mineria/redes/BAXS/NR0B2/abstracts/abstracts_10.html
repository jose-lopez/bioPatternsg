<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>	<meta charset="utf-8">	<title>generación de archivo html</title></head><body>Oxysterols are cholesterol metabolites derived through either autoxidation or enzymatic processes. They consist of a large family of bioactive lipids that have been associated with the progression of multiple pathologies. In order to unravel (patho-)physiological mechanisms involving oxysterols, it is crucial to elucidate the underlying formation and degradation of oxysterols. A role of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (11β-HSDs) in oxysterol metabolism by catalyzing the interconversion of 7-ketocholesterol (7kC) and 7β-hydroxycholesterol (7βOHC) has already been reported. The present study addresses a function of 11β-HSD1 in the enzymatic generation of 7β,25-dihydroxycholesterol (7β25OHC) from 7-keto,25-hydroxycholesterol (7k25OHC) and tested whether 11β-HSD2 is able to catalyze the reverse reaction. For the first time, using recombinant enzymes, the formation of 7k25OHC from 7kC by cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) and further stereospecific oxoreduction to 7β25OHC by human and mouse 11β-HSD1 could be demonstrated. Additionally, experiments using human 11β-HSD2 showed the oxidation of 7β25OHC to 7k25OHC. Molecular modeling provided an explanation for the stereospecific interconversion of 7β25OHC and 7k25OHC. Production of the Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 2 (EBI2) ligand 7β25OHC from 7k25OHC in challenged tissue by 11β-HSD1 may be important in inflammation. In conclusion, these results demonstrate a novel glucocorticoid-independent pre-receptor regulation mediated by 11β-HSDs.
Elimination of brain cholesterol occurs in the form of 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-HCh) that may modulate physiological processes outside the brain. Here, using microelectrode recording of postsynaptic responses (end-plate potentials, EPPs) and fluorescent marker (FM1-43) for endo-exocytosis we studied the effects of prolonged application of 24S-HCh (2.5 h, 0.4 μM) on the neurotransmission in the mice diaphragm. 24S-HCh enhanced the depression of EPP amplitude (indicator of neurotransmitter release) and suppressed the FM1-43 dye unloading from nerve terminals (indicator of exocytosis) during electrical nerve stimulation at 20 Hz, without affecting miniature EPP amplitude and frequency. Comparison of the rates of neurotransmitter and FM1-43 releases suggested an increase in time required for the synaptic vesicle reuse. Additionally, 24S-HCh potentiated an increase in DAF-FM fluorescence (a NO-sensitive marker) in response to 20 Hz stimulation. All effects of 24S-HCh were completely prevented by liver X receptor antagonist. Either inhibitors of NO synthases (TRIM, cavtratin) or protein synthesis blocker counteracted the 24S-HCh-mediated enhancement in DAF-FM fluorescence, while inhibition of NO production with l-NAME or cavtratin and extracellular NO chelation suppressed the effect of 24S-HCh on FM1-43 dye loss during 20 Hz activity. Pretreatment for 5 days with inhibitor of 24S-HCh synthesis (voriconazole) had opposite effects on the FM1-43 unloading and NO synthesis. These data suggest that prolonged exposure to 24S-HCh attenuates recruitment of synaptic vesicle to exocytosis during 20 Hz stimulation acting via liver Х receptor/NO-dependent signaling.
Oxysterol-binding proteins (OSBPs) comprise a family of sterol-binding proteins. In this study, we focused on AoOSBP1, one of the five OSBP proteins identified from the industrial fungus Aspergillus oryzae. The temporal expression pattern analysis showed that the expression of AoOSBP1, in both gene and protein levels, was stably expressed throughout the developmental stages, while was upregulated during the accelerated growth stage. The immunofluorescence observation revealed that AoOSBP1 protein was mainly distributed in the conidiophore, indicating its underlying role in spore formation. The ligand-binding domain of AoOSBP1, namely OSBP-related domain (ORD), was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The binding assay carried out using microscale thermophoresis showed that the recombinant AoORD protein exhibited binding affinity for ergosterol, and exhibited much higher affinity to oxysterols (25-hydroxycholesterol and 7-ketocholesterol) and phytosterols (β-sitosterol and stigmasterol). By contrast, MBP tag as the negative control showed no binding affinity for sterols. The present work demonstrates that AoORD domain in AoOSBP1 is capable of binding sterols, plays an underlying role in sterols transportation, and may participate in spore formation.
A present review is devoted to the analysis of literature data and results of own research. Skeletal muscle neuromuscular junction is specialized to trigger the striated muscle fiber contraction in response to motor neuron activity. The safety factor at the neuromuscular junction strongly depends on a variety of pre- and postsynaptic factors. The review focuses on the crucial role of membrane cholesterol to maintain a high efficiency of neuromuscular transmission. Cholesterol metabolism in the neuromuscular junction, its role in the synaptic vesicle cycle and neurotransmitter release, endplate electrogenesis, as well as contribution of cholesterol to the synaptogenesis, synaptic integrity, and motor disorders are discussed.
Gallstone disease is caused by multiple pathogenic factors and is common worldwide. Most studies have focused on the significance of the biliary microbiome in gallstone pathogenesis. Areas covered: In this study, the epidemiology of gallstone diseases and the existence, composition, origin, and mechanisms of the biliary microbiota were reviewed. Mechanisms involved in promoting the formation of different types of gallstones were also emphasized. The antibiotic susceptibility of the biliary microbiota is briefly discussed because it may guide clinical strategies. Expert commentary: The biliary microbiome facilitates the formation of brown pigment stones. Although glycoprotein (mucin) may be pivotal for many promoting substances to coagulate and integrate relevant components, new mechanisms involving prostaglandins, oxysterols, oxygen free radicals, and lipopolysaccharides have been discovered. Furthermore, specific bacterial species such as Helicobacter and Salmonella are involved in the pathogenesis of cholesterol gallstones. Recently, metabolomics of the biliary microbiome has been used to determine the detailed mechanisms that promote gallstone formation. Previously, the bacterial effects involved in the pathogenesis of brown pigment stones have not been analyzed in detail. Whether the administration of antibiotics is related to prophylaxis for gallstone formation and gallstone-associated infections remains unclear.
Glaucoma is one of the most frequent causes of visual impairment worldwide and involves selective damage to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) resulting in degeneration of neural pathways connecting retina to visual cortex. It is of interest that similarities in pathological changes have been described in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of progressive memory loss and dementia in older people. Accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and hyperphosphorylated tau is thought to contribute to apoptotic neuronal death in Alzheimer's disease, and similar changes have been linked to apoptotic RGC death in glaucoma. Both glaucoma and Alzheimer's disease also suffer from a lack of effective treatments prompting a search for novel therapeutic interventions. Neurosteroids (NSs) (including oxysterols) are endogenous molecules synthesized in the nervous system from cholesterol that can modulate glutamate and GABA receptors, the primary mediators of fast excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain, respectively. Because changes in the glutamate and GABA neurotransmitter systems contribute to the pathogenesis of AD and glaucoma, NSs are possible therapeutic targets for these disorders. In this review, we present recent evidence supporting pathological links between Alzheimer's disease and glaucoma, and focus on the possible role of NSs in these diseases and how NSs might be developed for therapeutic purposes.
Our objective was to investigate the effect of cholesterol [hypercholesterolemia and 7-ketocholesterol (7K)] on endoglin (Eng) expression and regulation with respect to endothelial or vascular dysfunction in vivo and in vitro. In vivo experiments were performed in 2-mo-old atherosclerosis-prone apolipoprotein E-deficient/LDL receptor-deficient (ApoE-/-/LDLR-/-) female mice and their wild-type C57BL/6J littermates. In in vitro experiments, human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were treated with 7K. ApoE-/-/LDLR-/- mice developed hypercholesterolemia accompanied by increased circulating levels of P-selectin and Eng and a disruption of NO metabolism. Functional analysis of the aorta demonstrated impaired vascular reactivity, and Western blot analysis revealed down-regulation of membrane Eng/Smad2/3/eNOS signaling in ApoE-/-/LDLR-/- mice. 7K increased Eng expression via Krüppel-like factor 6 (KLF6), liver X nuclear receptor, and NF-κB in HAECs. 7K-induced Eng expression was prevented by the treatment with 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin; 8-{[5-chloro-2-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl) pyridine-4-carbonyl] amino}-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-4, 5-dihydrobenzo[g]indazole-3-carboxamide; or by KLF6 silencing. 7K induced increased adhesion and transmigration of monocytic human leukemia promonocytic cell line cells and was prevented by Eng silencing. We concluded that hypercholesterolemia altered Eng expression and signaling, followed by endothelial or vascular dysfunction before formation of atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE-/-/LDLR-/- mice. By contrast, 7K increased Eng expression and induced inflammation in HAECs, which was followed by an increased adhesion and transmigration of monocytes via endothelium, which was prevented by Eng inhibition. Thus, we propose a relevant role for Eng in endothelial or vascular dysfunction or inflammation when exposed to cholesterol.-Vicen, M., Vitverova, B., Havelek, R., Blazickova, K., Machacek, M., Rathouska, J., Najmanová, I., Dolezelova, E., Prasnicka, A., Sternak, M., Bernabeu, C., Nachtigal, P. Regulation and role of endoglin in cholesterol-induced endothelial and vascular dysfunction in vivo and in vitro.
The gene encoding for Epstein-Barr virus-induced G-protein-coupled receptor 2 (EBI2) is a risk gene for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Together with its oxysterol ligand 7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol, EBI2 mediates migration and differentiation of immune cells. However, the role of EBI2 in the colonic immune system remains insufficiently studied. We found increased mRNA expression of EBI2 and oxysterol-synthesizing enzymes (CH25H, CYP7B1) in the inflamed colon of patients with ulcerative colitis and mice with acute or chronic dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis. Accordingly, we detected elevated levels of 25-hydroxylated oxysterols, including 7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol in mice with acute colonic inflammation. Knockout of EBI2 or CH25H did not affect severity of DSS colitis; however, inflammation was decreased in male EBI2-/- mice in the IL-10 colitis model. The colonic immune system comprises mucosal lymphoid structures, which accumulate upon chronic inflammation in IL-10-deficient mice and in chronic DSS colitis. However, EBI2-/- mice formed significantly less colonic lymphoid structures at baseline and showed defects in inflammation-induced accumulation of lymphoid structures. In summary, we report induction of the EBI2-7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol axis in colitis and a role of EBI2 for the accumulation of lymphoid tissue during homeostasis and inflammation. These data implicate the EBI2-7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol axis in IBD pathogenesis.
Osteoarthritis-the most common form of age-related degenerative whole-joint disease1-is primarily characterized by cartilage destruction, as well as by synovial inflammation, osteophyte formation and subchondral bone remodelling2,3. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis are largely unknown. Although osteoarthritis is currently considered to be associated with metabolic disorders, direct evidence for this is lacking, and the role of cholesterol metabolism in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis has not been fully investigated4-6. Various types of cholesterol hydroxylases contribute to cholesterol metabolism in extrahepatic tissues by converting cellular cholesterol to circulating oxysterols, which regulate diverse biological processes7,8. Here we show that the CH25H-CYP7B1-RORα axis of cholesterol metabolism in chondrocytes is a crucial catabolic regulator of the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritic chondrocytes had increased levels of cholesterol because of enhanced uptake, upregulation of cholesterol hydroxylases (CH25H and CYP7B1) and increased production of oxysterol metabolites. Adenoviral overexpression of CH25H or CYP7B1 in mouse joint tissues caused experimental osteoarthritis, whereas knockout or knockdown of these hydroxylases abrogated the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis. Moreover, retinoic acid-related orphan receptor alpha (RORα) was found to mediate the induction of osteoarthritis by alterations in cholesterol metabolism. These results indicate that osteoarthritis is a disease associated with metabolic disorders and suggest that targeting the CH25H-CYP7B1-RORα axis of cholesterol metabolism may provide a therapeutic avenue for treating osteoarthritis.
The term hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) embraces a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs. There currently exist no specific therapies for HSP, and treatment is exclusively symptomatic, aimed at reducing muscle spasticity, and improving strength and gait. The authors set out to perform a comprehensive systematic review of the available scientific literature on the treatment of HSP, applying Cochrane Collaboration methods. The Google Scholar, PubMed and Scopus electronic databases were searched to find relevant randomized control trials (RCTs) and open-label interventional studies, prospective, and retrospective observational studies of supplements, medications, and physical therapy, as well as case reports and case series. Two authors independently analyzed 27 articles selected on the basis of a series of inclusion criteria. Applying a best-evidence synthesis approach, they evaluated these articles for methodological quality. A standardized scoring system was used to obtain interrater assessments. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. The 27 articles focused on pharmacological treatment (n = 17 articles), physical therapy (n = 5), surgical treatment (n = 5). The drugs used in the 17 articles on pharmacological therapy were: gabapentin, progabide, dalfampridine, botulinum toxin, L-Dopa, cholesterol-lowering drugs, betaine, and folinic acid. Gabapentin, progabide, dalfampridine, and botulinum toxin were used as antispastic agents; the study evaluating gabapentin efficacy was well-designed, but failed to demonstrate any significant improvement. L-Dopa, cholesterol-lowering drugs, betaine, and folinic acid were only used in specific HSP subtypes. Two of the three studies evaluating cholesterol-lowering drugs (in SPG5 patients) were well-designed and showed a significant reduction of specific serum biomarkers (oxysterols), but clinical outcomes were not evaluated. The articles focusing on physical treatment and surgical therapy were found to be of low/medium quality and, accordingly, failed to clarify the role of these approaches in HSP. Despite recent advances in understanding of the pathogenesis of HSP and the possibility, in several centers, of obtaining more precise and rapid molecular diagnoses, there is still no adequate evidence base for recommending the various published therapies. Well-designed RCTs are needed to evaluate the efficacy of both symptomatic and pathogenetic treatments.
Oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP)-related proteins (ORPs) constitute a family of intracellular lipid-binding/transport proteins (LTPs) in eukaryotes. They typically have a modular structure comprising a lipid-binding domain and membrane targeting determinants, being thus suited for function at membrane contact sites. Among the mammalian ORPs, ORP2/OSBPL2 is the only member that only exists as a 'short' variant lacking a membrane-targeting pleckstrin homology domain. ORP2 is expressed ubiquitously and has been assigned a multitude of functions. Its OSBP-related domain binds cholesterol, oxysterols, and phosphoinositides, and its overexpression enhances cellular cholesterol efflux. Consistently, the latest observations suggest a function of ORP2 in cholesterol transport to the plasma membrane (PM) in exchange for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P2), with significant impacts on the concentrations of PM cholesterol and PI4,5P2. On the other hand, ORP2 localizes at the surface of cytoplasmic lipid droplets (LDs) and at endoplasmic-reticulum-LD contact sites, and its depletion modifies cellular triglyceride (TG) metabolism. Study in an adrenocortical cell line further suggested a function of ORP2 in the synthesis of steroid hormones. Our recent knock-out of ORP2 in human hepatoma cells revealed its function in hepatocellular PI3K/Akt signaling, glucose and triglyceride metabolism, as well as in actin cytoskeletal regulation, cell adhesion, migration and proliferation. ORP2 was shown to interact physically with F-actin regulators such as DIAPH1, ARHGAP12, SEPT9 and MLC12, as well as with IQGAP1 and the Cdc37-Hsp90 chaperone complex controlling the activity of Akt. Interestingly, mutations in OSBPL2 encoding ORP2 are associated with autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss, and the protein was found to localize in cochlear hair cell stereocilia. The functions assigned to ORP2 suggest that this protein, in concert with other LTPs, controls the subcellular distribution of cholesterol in various cell types and steroid hormone synthesis in adrenocortical cells. However, it also impacts cellular TG and carbohydrate metabolism and F-actin-dependent functions, revealing a bewildering spectrum of activities.
Under pathological conditions, cholesterol oxidation products (oxysterols) appear in enhanced concentration in blood and cerebrospinal fluid, which leads to cytotoxic effect, especially in central nervous system. However, the mode of action of oxysterols on the membrane level has not been fully resolved. In this paper we have investigated the interaction between 7α- hydroxycholesterol, 7α-OH (one of the most abundant oxysterol in human body) and two major membrane lipids: sphingomyelin, SM (basic component of lipid rafts and nerve membrane) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine, POPC (main phospholipid of mammalian cell membranes). 7α-OH/SM mixtures may mimic pathologically changed lipid raft (ordered phase, LO) while the SM/POPC system can model its surrounding (liquid-disordered phase, Lα). For our study, the Langmuir monolayer technique (based on registration of the surface pressure/area, π/A isotherms), complemented with surface visualization technique (Brewster angle microscopy, BAM) and theoretical calculations, have been employed. The observed affinity of 7α-OH to SM, which appears to be stronger than in cholesterol/SM system, indicates that cholesterol might be partially replaced in lipid rafts by its oxidized derivative. Its incorporation significantly increases rigidity of the system in relation to normal (cholesterol-containing) raft, which can disturb its proper functioning. On the other hand, the poor effect of this oxysterol on the raft's environment was observed.
Circulating levels of cholesterol are derived from either endogenous production or intestinal absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol. Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) is a transmembrane protein that plays a key role in the intestinal absorption of cholesterol by facilitating its uptake through vesicular endocytosis. NPC1L1 is the molecular target of ezetimibe which binds its extracellular loop and inhibits sterol absorption without affecting the absorption of other molecules. Ezetimibe significantly reduces plasma levels of total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) as monotherapy or when added to statins, the association with a low dose of statin is of particular interest for patients experiencing statin-related side effects. The recent results of the IMPROVE-IT study, which evaluated the cardiovascular effect of ezetimibe added to simvastatin therapy in subjects who had had an acute coronary syndrome and with LDL-C levels within the recommended range, showed that a further LDL-C lowering reduced the incidence of cardiovascular events. To date, ezetimibe represents the only inhibitor of NPC1L1 available for clinical use, however, novel aminoß- lactam ezetimibe derivatives have been synthesized and their efficacy to inhibit NPC1L1 protein and decrease plasma cholesterol levels is under evaluation. 
Interest in food matrices supplemented with mushrooms as hypocholesterolemic functional foods is increasing. This study was to (i) investigate the hypocholesterolemic activity of lard functionalized with mushroom extracts (LF) including fungal β-glucans, water-soluble polysaccharides, or ergosterol and (ii) examine the LF influence on transcriptional mechanisms involved in cholesterol metabolism. mRNA levels of 17 cholesterol-related genes were evaluated in jejunum, cecum, and liver of high cholesterol-fed mice. The four tested LFs decreased plasma cholesterol by 22-42%, HDLc by 18-40%, and LDLc by 27-51%, and two of them increased mRNA levels of jejunal Npc1l1 and Abcg5 and hepatic Npc1l1. mRNA levels of other cholesterol-related genes were unchanged. These findings suggest that LF may have potential as a dietary supplement for counteracting diet-induced hypercholesterolemia and could be a source for the development of novel cholesterol-lowering functional foods. However, the cholesterol-lowering effect was unrelated to transcriptional changes, suggesting that post-transcriptional mechanisms could be involved. 
'Genetic proxies' are increasingly being used to predict the effects of drugs. We present an up-to-date overview of the use of human genetics to predict effects and adverse effects of lipid-targeting drugs.
LDL cholesterol lowering variants in HMG-Coenzyme A reductase and Niemann-Pick C1-like protein 1, the targets for statins and ezetimibe, protect against ischemic heart disease (IHD). However, HMG-Coenzyme A reductase and Niemann-Pick C1-Like Protein 1-variants also increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and gallstone disease, respectively. Mutations in proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9), apolipoprotein B, and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein cause low LDL cholesterol and protect against IHD. In addition, mutations in apolipoprotein B and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein cause hepatic steatosis, in concordance with drugs that inhibit these targets. Both mutations in PCSK9 and PCSK9-inhibition seem without adverse effects. Mutations in APOC3 cause low triglycerides and protect against IHD, and recent pharmacological APOC3-inhibition reported major reductions in plasma triglycerides. Human genetics support that low lipoprotein(a) protects against IHD, without adverse effects, and the first trial of lipoprotein(a) inhibition reduced lipoprotein(a) up to 78%.
Recent genetic studies have confirmed the efficacy of statins and ezetimibe in protecting against IHD. Results from human genetics support that several lipid-lowering drugs currently under development are likely to prove efficacious in protecting against IHD, without major adverse effects.
Emerging evidence suggested phytosterol esters (PE) exhibited an advantage over naturally occurring phytosterols in reducing atherosclerosis risk factors due to improved fat solubility and compatibility. However, the effects of dietary patterns of PE on lipid-lowering activity were limited and inconsistent. This study aimed to explore the effects of dose and frequency of α-linolenic acid rich phytosterol esters (ALA-PE) on cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism markers focused on intestinal cholesterol absorption and bioconversion of ALA in liver.
Dose-dependency study Male Syrian golden hamsters were fed high-fat diets (HFD) containing low, medium and high dose of ALA-PE (0.72 %, 2.13 % and 6.39 %) for 6 weeks. The high fat diet contained 89.5 % chow diet, 0.2 % cholesterol, 10 % lard and 0.3 % bile salt. Dose-frequency study Male Syrian golden hamsters were provided: (I) 0.4 mL/100 g peanut oil by gavage once a day; (II) 0.4 mL/100 g ALA-PE by gavage once a day; (III) 0.2 mL/100 g ALA-PE by gavage twice a day; (IV) 0.133 mL/100 g ALA-PE by gavage three times a day; (V) 0.1 mL/100 g ALA-PE by gavage four times a day for 6 weeks with a high-fat diet simultaneously.
ALA-PE dose-dependently lowered plasma total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations with a maximal decrease of 42 %, 59 % and 73 %, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). Compared to HFD, TC, LDL-C and TG concentrations were significantly lower (p &lt; 0.01) in hamsters consumed HFD plus ALA-PE for 1-4 times per day but there were not remarkable differences among different consumption frequencies. No significant changes in plasma antioxidant capacity and lipid peroxidation levels were observed among HFD and HFD plus different doses of ALA-PE groups. The contents of hepatic α-linolenic (ALA), docosapentaenoic (DPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids were dose-dependently increased in different ALA-PE groups compared to those in HFD group. The abundance of mRNA for intestinal sterol transporters Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters ABCG5 and ABCG8 indicated no significant differences among all groups.
ALA-PE dose-dependently improved lipid profile in hamsters fed HFD independent of intestinal ABCG5, ABCG8 and NPC1L1, accompanying by increased conversion of ALA to DPA and DHA in liver. ALA-PE manifested "once a day" lipid-lowering efficacy, highlighting a promising preventive strategy for metabolic syndrome.
Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (Lpcat3) is involved in phosphatidylcholine remodeling in the small intestine and liver. We investigated lipid metabolism in inducible intestine-specific and liver-specificLpcat3gene knock-out mice. We producedLpcat3-Flox/villin-Cre-ER(T2)mice, which were treated with tamoxifen (at days 1, 3, 5, and 7), to deleteLpcat3specifically in the small intestine. At day 9 after the treatment, we found that Lpcat3 deficiency in enterocytes significantly reduced polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholines in the enterocyte plasma membrane and reduced Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), CD36, ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1), and ABCG8 levels on the membrane, thus significantly reducing lipid absorption, cholesterol secretion through apoB-dependent and apoB-independent pathways, and plasma triglyceride, cholesterol, and phospholipid levels, as well as body weight. Moreover, Lpcat3 deficiency does not cause significant lipid accumulation in the small intestine. We also utilized adenovirus-associated virus-Cre to depleteLpcat3in the liver. We found that liver deficiency only reduces plasma triglyceride levels but not other lipid levels. Furthermore, there is no significant lipid accumulation in the liver. Importantly, small intestine Lpcat3 deficiency has a much bigger effect on plasma lipid levels than that of liver deficiency. Thus, inhibition of small intestine Lpcat3 might constitute a novel approach for treating hyperlipidemia. 
Niemann Pick Type C1 Like 1 (NPC1L1) protein plays a key role in intestinal and hepatic cholesterol metabolism in humans. Genetic variation in NPC1L1 has been widely studied in recent years. We analyzed NPC1L1 single nucleotide polymorphisms in Chinese gallstone disease patients to investigate their association with gallstone disease. NPC1L1 mRNA expression was also measured in liver biopsies from patients with cholesterol gallstone disease and compared between genotypes. The G allele of the g1679C&gt;G (rs2072183) polymorphism was significantly more prevalent in patients with gallstones compared with gallstone-free subjects. Moreover, patients carrying the G allele had lower hepatic NPC1L1 mRNA expression and higher biliary cholesterol (molar percentages) and cholesterol saturation index. Our study suggests that the G allele of the NPC1L1 polymorphism g1679C&gt;G may be a positive marker of gallstone formation risk. 
Certain lipid-lowering drugs increase bile lithogenicity. Here we investigated whether long-term administration of ezetimibe, a new class of hypocholesterolemic agents designed to inhibit intestinal cholesterol absorption by inhibiting Niemann-Pick C1-like 1, alters bile lithogenicity in patients with hepatobiliary diseases.
Eleven dyslipidemic patients with gallstones and/or fatty liver diseases were treated with ezetimibe (10 mg/day) for 12 months. Bile samples were collected by nasal endoscopy before and after 3 and 12 months of treatment. Serum and bile lipids and serum metabolic parameters were analyzed.
Serum levels of campesterol, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly decreased after 3 and 12 months of treatment. In contrast, serum lathosterol levels increased gradually. The lithogenic index of bile was unsaturated and unchanged in patients who were previously and concomitantly receiving ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). In patients who were not receiving UDCA, bile was initially supersaturated, but eventually was unsaturated. However, ezetimibe tended to elevate bile lithogenicity in cholecystectomy patients.
Long-term treatment with ezetimibe improves lipid metabolism without significantly altering the bile lithogenicity. Therefore, inhibiting intestinal cholesterol absorption in dyslipidemic patients with hepatobiliary diseases is a safe therapeutic strategy without worsening biliary physiology.
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has definitely clinical effect in treating hyperlipidemia, but the action mechanism still need to be explored. Based on consulting Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2010), all the lipid-lowering Chinese patent medicines were analyzed by associated rules data mining method to explore high frequency herb pairs. The top three couplet medicines with high support degree were Puerariae Lobatae Radix-Crataegi Fructus, Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma-Crataegi Fructus, and Polygoni Multiflori Radix-Crataegi Fructus. The 20 main ingredients were selected from the herb pairs and docked with 3 key hyperlipidemia targets, namely 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-α (PPAR-α ) and niemann-pick C1 like 1 (NPC1L1) to further discuss the molecular mechanism of the high frequency herb pairs, by using the docking program, LibDock. To construct evaluation rules for the ingredients of herb pairs, the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) value between computed and initial complexes was first calculated to validate the fitness of LibDock models. Then, the key residues were also confirmed by analyzing the interactions of those 3 proteins and corresponding marketed drugs. The docking results showed that hyperin, puerarin, salvianolic acid A and polydatin can interact with two targets, and the other five compounds may be potent for at least one of the three targets. In this study, the multi-target effect of high frequency herb pairs for lipid-lowering was discussed on the molecular level, which can help further researching new multi-target anti-hyperlipidemia drug.
The involvement of lipid transporters, the scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI) and Niemann-Pick type C1 Like 1 protein (NPC1L1) in carotenoid absorption is demonstrated in intestinal cells and animal models. Dietary ω-3 fatty acids are known to possess antilipidemic properties, which could be mediated by activation of PPAR family transcription factors. The present study was conducted to determine the effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), on intestinal β-carotene absorption. β-carotene uptake in Caco-2/TC7 cells was inhibited by EPA (p &lt; 0.01) and PPARα agonist (P &lt; 0.01), but not by DHA, PPARγ or PPARδ agonists. Despite unaltered β-carotene uptake, both DHA and PPARδ agonists inhibited the NPC1L1 expression. Further, EPA also induced the expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A (CPT1A) expression, a PPARα target gene. Interestingly, EPA induced inhibition of β-carotene uptake and SR B1 expression were abrogated by specific PPARα antagonist, but not by PPARδ antagonist. EPA and PPARα agonist also inhibited the basolateral secretion of β-carotene from Caco-2 cells grown on permeable supports. These results suggest that EPA inhibits intestinal β-carotene absorption by down regulation of SR B1 expression via PPARα dependent mechanism and provide an evidence for dietary modulation of intestinal β-carotene absorption. 
Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1i) protein is the key transporter responsible for dietary cholesterol absorption. Recent studies indicated that several functional polymorphisms of NPC1L1 were associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) and response to ezetimibe therapy. The aim of the present study was to analyze the allele frequency and haplotype distribution of NPC1L1 polymorphisms in Chinese Hans and to compare them with those of other ethnic populations reported before. Blood samples were collected from 424 unrelated Chinese Hans (246 males and 178 females). Ten NPC1L1 polymorphisms (-762T &gt; C, -133A &gt; G, -18C &gt; A, 1721C &gt; T, 1735C &gt; G, 1764T &gt; C, 1767G &gt; A, 27677T &gt; C, 25342A &gt; C and 28650A &gt; G) were genotyped by direct sequencing or polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay. Among the variants, the minor allele frequency of -762T &gt; C and 1735C &gt; G were 35.0% and 37.0%, respectively. Furthermore, these two polymorphisms were highly linked with a D' value of 0.80. The observed frequencies of two major haplotypes were 59.1% for T-762/C1735 and 30.1% for C-762/G1735, respectively. The frequencies of the rest variants were extremely low (1.8% for - 133G, 1.5% for -18A, 0.9% for 1721T and only 0.2% for 27677C allele, respectively) or even not detected (1764T &gt; C, 1767G &gt; A, 25342A &gt; C and 28650A &gt; G) in our study population. Comparison with other ethnic populations revealed a remarkable genetic variability in the incidences of NPC1L1 polymorphisms. The frequencies of NPC1L1 polymorphisms in Chinese Hans are comparable to Japanese population but totally different from Caucasians, African-Americans and Hispanic individuals. This is the first study to report the ethnic difference in the frequencies of NPC1L1 functional polymorphisms in detail. -762T &gt; C and 1735C &gt; G are two prevalent NPC1L1 variants which need further studies to explore their clinical impact on CHD prevalence and response to ezetimibe therapy in Chinese Hans.
With the goal of decreasing low-density cholesterol (LDL-C) to mitigate risk of both primary and secondary cardiovascular outcomes, statins have been the cornerstone of therapy, significantly reducing the incidence of coronary atherosclerotic vascular disease. Previous studies suggest that adding other non-statin LDL-lowering agents may further lower LDL-C without negative side effects. Recent guidelines support the hypothesis that driving the LDL-C level below previously recommended targets may have a beneficial effect. Ezetimibe, a cholesterol absorption blocker that inhibits the Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) receptor, has been the focus of recent trials that support its use in cardiovascular risk reduction. For patients not at goal on statin therapy alone, ezetimibe has proven to be a safe, well-tolerated medication that may be used as an adjunct to statin therapy to further reduce LDL-C, resulting in a significant mortality benefit. 
The impact of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels on cardiovascular risk has been extensively studied. Statins have been demonstrated to significantly reduce LDL cholesterol levels, contributing to cardiovascular risk reduction particularly in patients with high cardiovascular risk. However, low adherence to statin therapy, often due to adverse effects, has raised the need for new pharmacological approaches to combine with statin therapy in order to reach the target levels of LDL cholesterol. Ezetimibe is a selective inhibitor of Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) protein that regulates the cholesterol uptake from the small intestine into the enterocytes. Ezetimibe has been demonstrated to significantly reduce LDL cholesterol levels in combination with statins and recent trials support its role in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events. 
Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) is involved in dietary cholesterol absorption and is the direct molecular target of the LDL-lowering drug ezetimibe. Recently, genetic variants in NPC1L1 have been associated with the incidence of cardiovascular events, but it remains unclear if the impact of NPC1L1 on cardiovascular risk is dependent on its role in cholesterol absorption. Furthermore, no direct association of genetic variants in NPC1L1 with coronary atherosclerosis has been established.
To further address these issues, we determined the impact of 34 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the NPC1L1 gene locus on the presence of coronary atherosclerosis and prospectively on future cardiovascular events in a cohort of 984 angiographied Caucasian patients.
Out of investigated SNPs, 24 variants were significantly associated with future cardiovascular events. The highest impact was observed for rs55837134 (sex-and age adjusted additive HR = 1.67 [1.28-2.18]; p = 1.3 e-4). Regression analysis conditioned on rs55837134 showed that significant associations between remaining SNPs at the NPC1L1 locus and vascular events did not persist suggesting their dependence on rs55837134. Its significant association remained almost unchanged after further adjustment for total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and other cardiovascular risk factors (additive HR = 1.67 [1.28-2.18]; p = 1.7 e-4). In addition, no significant association of investigated NPC1L1 variants with coronary atherosclerosis could be observed, at least after false discovery rate correction.
Genetic variants of NPC1L1, particularly rs55837134, show a predictive impact on cardiovascular events. Further studies to determine the molecular consequences of common genetic variants in NPC1L1 are needed.
Phosphatidylcholines (PCs) are structural and functional constituents of cell membranes. The activity of acyltransferase (lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase [LPCAT]) is required for addition of polyunsaturated fatty acids to the sn-2 position of PCs and is therefore required to maintain cell membrane structure and function. LPCAT3 is the most abundant isoform of LPCAT in the small intestine and liver, which are important sites of plasma lipoprotein metabolism. We investigated the effects of Lpcat3 disruption on lipid metabolism in mice.
We disrupted the gene Lpcat3 in C57BL/6J mice to create LPCAT3 knockout (KO) mice. Livers and small intestinal tissues were collected from LPCAT3 KO and C57BL/6J parental strain (controls), and levels of LPCAT messenger RNAs and protein were measured. Levels of lipids and lipoproteins were measured in plasma samples. We isolated enterocytes from mice and measured levels of RNAs and proteins involved in lipid uptake by real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot assays, respectively. We assessed lipid absorption and PC subspecies in the enterocyte plasma membrane using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectometry.
LPCAT3 KO mice survived only 3 weeks after birth. Oil Red O staining showed that the control but not LPCAT3 KO mice accumulated lipids in the small intestine; levels of Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) and fatty acid transporter protein 4 (FATP4), which regulate lipid uptake, were greatly reduced in the small intestines of LPCAT3 KO mice. Oral administration of PC and olive oil allowed the LPCAT3 KO mice to survive with the same body weights as controls, but the KO mice had shorter and wider small-intestinal villi and longer and bigger small intestines. Plasma membranes of enterocytes from LPCAT3 KO mice also had significant reductions in the composition of polyunsaturated PCs and reduced levels of NPC1L1, CD36, and FATP4 proteins. These reductions were associated with reduced intestinal uptake of lipid by the small intestine and reduced plasma levels of cholesterol, phospholipid, and triglyceride.
LPCAT3 KO mice have longer and larger small intestines than control mice, with shorter wide villi, reduced lipid absorption, and lower levels NPC1L1, CD36, and FATP4 proteins. Inhibition of LPCAT3 in the small intestine could be developed as an approach to treat hyperlipidemia.
Oral supplements are important to prevent and treat vitamin D deficiency. Despite the growing number of prescriptions, vitamin D's absorptive mechanisms are not clearly elucidated. By evaluating the effect of ezetimibe on vitamin D absorption, we aim to determine if the cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 transporter contributes to it. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.govNCT02234544) was developed in a South Brazilian University Hospital. Fifty-one medical students were randomized to ezetimibe 10mg/day or placebo for 5 days. On the fifth and 19th days, blood samples for 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25OHD), parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, and albumin were collected. After the first blood sample collection, all participants received a single oral 50,000 IU cholecalciferol dose during a 15 g-fat meal. Serum 25OHD levels were measured by the immunoassay Diasorin Liaison®. Measurements were compared in a general linear model adjusted for multiple comparisons by the Bonferroni test. Before cholecalciferol administration, 25OHD was &lt;30 ng/mL and &lt;20 ng/mL, respectively, in all and in 82.3% of the participants. Fourteen days after a single 50,000 IU oral dose of cholecalciferol, mean (SD) changes in serum 25OHD were similar in both groups, after adjustment to BMI and 25OHD levels before cholecalciferol administration (p=0.26): 8.7 (3.7) ng/mL in the ezetimibe group, versus 10.0 (3.8) ng/mL in the placebo group. Mean serum 25OHD, PTH, calcium and albumin levels remained similar in both groups. We conclude that ezetimibe had no effect on the mean change in serum 25OHD after a single oral dose of cholecalciferol, in these healthy and young adults.
The known mechanism by which orlistat decreases the absorption of dietary cholesterol is by inhibition of intestinal lipases. The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of orlistat to limit cholesterol absorption by inhibition of the cholesterol transport protein Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) as another mechanism of action. In situ rat intestinal perfusion studies were conducted to study the effect of orlistat on jejunal cholesterol absorption. Inhibition kinetic parameters were calculated from in vitro inhibition studies using Caco2 and NPC1L1 transfected cell lines. The in situ studies demonstrated that intestinal perfusion of orlistat (100µM) was able to reduce cholesterol absorption by three-fold when compared to control (i.e. in the absence of orlistat, P&lt;0.01). In vitro studies using Caco2 cells demonstrated orlistat to reduce the cellular uptake of cholesterol by 30%. Additionally, orlistat reduced the cellular uptake of cholesterol in dose dependent manner in NPC1L1 transfected cell line with an IC50=1.2µM. Lineweaver-Burk plot indicated a noncompetitive inhibition of NPC1L1 by orlistat. Beside the already established mechanism by which orlistat reduces the absorption of cholesterol, we demonstrated for the first time that orlistat limits cholesterol absorption by the inhibition of NPC1L1 transport protein. 
We have previously observed that knockout of Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), a cholesterol transporter essential for intestinal cholesterol absorption, reduces the output of dry stool in mice. As the food intake remains unaltered in NPC1L1-knockout (L1-KO) mice, we hypothesized that NPC1L1 deficiency may alter the gut microbiome to reduce stool output. Consistently, here we demonstrate that the phyla of fecal microbiota differ substantially between L1-KO mice and their wild-type controls. Germ-free (GF) mice have reduced stool output. Inhibition of NPC1L1 by its inhibitor ezetimibe reduces stool output in specific pathogen-free (SPF), but not GF mice. In addition, we show that GF versus SPF mice have reduced intestinal absorption and increased fecal excretion of cholesterol, particularly after treatment with ezetimibe. This negative balance of cholesterol in GF mice is associated with reduced plasma and hepatic cholesterol, and likely caused by reduced expression of NPC1L1 and increased expression of ABCG5 and ABCG8 in small intestine. Expression levels of other genes in intestine and liver largely reflect a state of cholesterol depletion and a decrease in intestinal sensing of bile acids. Altogether, our findings reveal a broad role of microbiota in regulating whole-body cholesterol homeostasis and its response to a cholesterol-lowering drug, ezetimibe. 
SREBP cleavage-activating protein (Scap) is an endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein required for cleavage and activation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), which activate the transcription of genes in sterol and fatty acid biosynthesis. Liver-specific loss of Scap is well tolerated; hepatic synthesis of sterols and fatty acids is reduced, but mice are otherwise healthy. To determine whether Scap loss is tolerated in the intestine, we generated a mouse model (Vil-Scap(-)) in which tamoxifen-inducible Cre-ER(T2), a fusion protein of Cre recombinase with a mutated ligand binding domain of the human estrogen receptor, ablates Scap in intestinal mucosa. After 4 days of tamoxifen, Vil-Scap(-) mice succumb with a severe enteropathy and near-complete collapse of intestinal mucosa. Organoids grown ex vivo from intestinal crypts of Vil-Scap(-) mice are readily killed when Scap is deleted by 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Death is prevented when culture medium is supplemented with cholesterol and oleate. These data show that, unlike the liver, the intestine requires Scap to sustain tissue integrity by maintaining the high levels of lipid synthesis necessary for proliferation of intestinal crypts. 
To summarize recent findings from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), whole-exome sequencing of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and 'exome chip' studies pointing to novel genes in LDL metabolism.
The genetic loci for ATP-binding cassette transporters G5 and G8, Niemann-Pick C1-Like protein 1, sortilin-1, ABO blood-group glycosyltransferases, myosin regulatory light chain-interacting protein and cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase have all consistently been associated with LDL cholesterol levels and/or coronary artery disease in GWAS. Whole-exome sequencing and 'exome chip' studies have additionally suggested several novel genes in LDL metabolism including insulin-induced gene 2, signal transducing adaptor family member 1, lysosomal acid lipase A, patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 5 and transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2. Most of these findings still require independent replications and/or functional studies to confirm the exact role in LDL metabolism and the clinical implications for human health.
GWAS, exome sequencing studies, and recently 'exome chip' studies have suggested several novel genes with effects on LDL cholesterol. Novel genes in LDL metabolism will improve our understanding of mechanisms in LDL metabolism, and may lead to the identification of new drug targets to reduce LDL cholesterol levels.
Ezetimibe reduces plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by inhibiting Niemann-Pick C1-Like protein 1 (NPC1L1), the transporter responsible for cholesterol uptake from the intestine into enterocytes and from the bile into hepatocytes. We tested the hypothesis that genetic variation in NPC1L1, mimicking the effect of ezetimibe, was associated with reduced risk of ischaemic vascular disease (IVD) and with increased risk of symptomatic gallstone disease.
We included 67 385 individuals from the general population. Of these, 5255 and 3886 individuals developed IVD or symptomatic gallstone disease, respectively, during follow-up from 1977 to 2013. We genotyped four common NPC1L1 variants, previously associated with reduced LDL cholesterol levels, thus mimicking the effect of ezetimibe, and calculated a weighted genotype score. With increasing genotype score, LDL cholesterol decreased stepwise up to 3.5% (0.12 mmol/L) and total cholesterol up to 1.9% (0.11 mmol/L) (P-trend: 2 × 10(-12) and 2 × 10(-9)). The cumulative incidence by age of IVD decreased, while that of symptomatic gallstone disease increased as a function of increasing genotype score (P-trend: 0.005 and 0.01). Hazard ratios for genotype scores ≥ 5.0 vs. &lt;2.0 were 0.82 (95% confidence interval: 0.70-0.95) for IVD and 1.22 (0.99-1.49) for gallstone disease (P-trend across genotype scores: 0.004 and 0.01).
Genetic variation in NPC1L1 is associated with a reduction in risk of IVD, with a corresponding reduction in LDL cholesterol, but with a concomitant increased risk of gallstone disease. These data support the hypothesis that treatment with ezetimibe protects against IVD but raise the question whether long-term treatment increases the risk of gallstone disease.
Recent studies have associated endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) exposure with the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in humans, but the underlying mechanisms responsible for these associations remain elusive. Many EDCs have been implicated in activation of the nuclear receptor pregnane X receptor (PXR), which acts as a xenobiotic sensor to regulate xenobiotic metabolism in the liver and intestine. Here we report an important role of intestinal PXR in linking xenobiotic exposure and hyperlipidemia. We identified tributyl citrate (TBC), one of a large group of Food and Drug Administration-approved plasticizers for pharmaceutical or food applications, as a potent and selective PXR agonist. TBC efficiently activated PXR and induced PXR target gene expression in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, TBC activated intestinal PXR but did not affect hepatic PXR activity. Exposure to TBC increased plasma total cholesterol and atherogenic low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in wild-type mice, but not in PXR-deficient mice. TBC-mediated PXR activation stimulated the expression of an essential cholesterol transporter, Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), in the intestine. Promoter analysis revealed a DR-4 type of PXR response element in the human NPC1L1 promoter, and TBC promoted PXR recruitment onto the NPC1L1 promoter. Consistently, TBC treatment significantly increased lipid uptake by human and murine intestinal cells and deficiency of PXR inhibited TBC-elicited lipid uptake. These findings provide critical mechanistic insight for understanding the impact of EDC-mediated PXR activation on lipid homeostasis and demonstrate a potential role of PXR in mediating the adverse effects of EDCs on cardiovascular disease risk in humans. 
Considerable uncertainty exists as to whether lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by inhibiting the Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) receptor with ezetimibe, either alone or in combination with a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) inhibitor (statin), will reduce the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD).
This study evaluated the effect of naturally random allocation to lower LDL-C mediated by polymorphisms in the NPC1L1 gene (target of ezetimibe), the HMGCR gene (target of statins), or both (target of combination therapy) on the risk of CHD.
We constructed NPC1L1 and HMGCR genetic LDL-C scores to naturally randomize participants into 4 groups: reference, lower LDL-C mediated by NPC1L1 polymorphisms, lower LDL-C mediated by HMGCR polymorphisms, or lower LDL-C mediated by polymorphisms in both NPC1L1 and HMGCR. We compared the risk of CHD (fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction) among each group using a 2 × 2 factorial mendelian randomization study design.
A total of 108,376 persons (10,464 CHD events) from 14 studies were included. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics among the 4 groups, thus confirming that allocation was random. Compared to the reference group, the NPC1L1 group had 2.4 mg/dl lower LDL-C and 4.8% lower risk of CHD (odds ratio [OR]: 0.952, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.920 to 0.985); whereas the HMGCR group had 2.9 mg/dl lower LDL-C and a similar 5.3% lower risk of CHD (OR: 0.947, 95% CI: 0.909 to 0.986). The group with lower LDL-C mediated by both NPC1L1 and HMGCR polymorphisms had 5.8 mg/dl additively lower LDL-C and a 10.8% log-linearly additive lower risk of CHD (OR: 0.892, 95% CI: 0.854 to 0.932).
The effect of lower LDL-C on the risk of CHD mediated by polymorphisms in NPC1L1, HMGCR, or both is approximately the same per unit lower LDL-C and log-linearly proportional to the absolute exposure to lower LDL-C.
Ezetimibe is known as a Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) inhibitor and has been used as an agent for hypercholesterolemia. In our previous study, ezetimibe administration improved glycemic control and increased glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1), an incretin hormone with anti-diabetic properties. However, the mechanisms by which ezetimibe stimulates GLP-1 secretion are not fully understood. Thus, the specific aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism(s) by which ezetimibe stimulates GLP-1 secretion.
Male KK/H1J mice were divided into following groups: AIN-93G (NC), NC with ezetimibe (10 mg/kg/day), 45% high fat (HF) diet, and HF diet with ezetimibe. To investigate the role of ezetimibe in glucose homeostasis and GLP-1 secretion, an insulin tolerance test was performed and serum and intestinal GLP-1 levels and intestinal mRNA expression involved in GLP-1 synthesis were measured after 6 weeks of ezetimibe treatment. In vivo and in vitro dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibition assays were employed to demonstrate the association between ezetimibe-induced GLP-1 change and DPP-4. The molecular mechanism by which ezetimibe affects GLP-1 secretion was evaluated by using human enteroendocrine NCI-H716 cells.
Ezetimibe supplementation significantly ameliorated HF-increased glucose and insulin resistance in the type 2 diabetic KK/H1J mouse model. Serum and intestinal active GLP-1 levels were significantly increased by ezetimibe in HF-fed animals. However, mRNA expression of genes involved in intestinal GLP-1 synthesis was not altered. Furthermore, ezetimibe did not inhibit the activity of either in vivo or in vitro dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4). The direct effects of ezetimibe on GLP-1 secretion and L cell secretory mechanisms were examined in human NCI-H716 intestinal cells. Ezetimibe significantly stimulated active GLP-1 secretion, which was accompanied by the activation of mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Ezetimibe-increased GLP-1 secretion was abrogated by inhibiting the MEK/ERK pathway with PD98059.
These findings suggest a possible novel biological role of ezetimibe in glycemic control to stimulate intestinal GLP-1 secretion via the MEK/ERK signaling pathway.
Vitamin K (VK) is a micronutrient that facilitates blood coagulation. VK antagonists, such as warfarin, are used in the clinic to prevent thromboembolism. Because VK is not synthesized in the body, its intestinal absorption is crucial for maintaining whole-body VK levels. However, the molecular mechanism of this absorption is unclear. We demonstrate that Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) protein, a cholesterol transporter, plays a central role in intestinal VK uptake and modulates the anticoagulant effect of warfarin. In vitro studies using NPC1L1-overexpressing intestinal cells and in vivo studies with Npc1l1-knockout mice revealed that intestinal VK absorption is NPC1L1-dependent and inhibited by ezetimibe, an NPC1L1-selective inhibitor clinically used for dyslipidemia. In addition, in vivo pharmacological studies demonstrated that the coadministration of ezetimibe and warfarin caused a reduction in hepatic VK levels and enhanced the pharmacological effect of warfarin. Adverse events caused by the coadministration of ezetimibe and warfarin were rescued by oral VK supplementation, suggesting that the drug-drug interaction effects observed were the consequence of ezetimibe-mediated VK malabsorption. This mechanism was supported by a retrospective evaluation of clinical data showing that, in more than 85% of warfarin-treated patients, the anticoagulant activity was enhanced by cotreatment with ezetimibe. Our findings provide insight into the molecular mechanism of VK absorption. This new drug-drug interaction mechanism between ezetimibe (a cholesterol transport inhibitor) and warfarin (a VK antagonist and anticoagulant) could inform clinical care of patients on these medications, such as by altering the kinetics of essential, fat-soluble vitamins. 
Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) plays a major role in the regulation of lipoprotein metabolism, mostly through control of low-density lipoprotein receptor degradation. Depletion of cellular cholesterol causes a compensatory increase in plasma PCSK9 levels, which can diminish the cholesterol-lowering power of statins and may lead to the overproduction of intestinal lipoproteins, mainly thorough the up regulation of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein and the Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 protein, the target of ezetimibe. Thus, ezetimibe therapy may counter this unwanted effect of statins, providing an additional theoretical rationale for combining the effect of ezetimibe on intestinal cholesterol absorption and that of statins on cholesterol synthesis. 
Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1 (NPC1L1) is a multi-transmembrane transport protein highly expressed in the small intestine. It mediates sterol transfer throughout the brush border membrane of enterocytes, becoming essential for intestinal cholesterol absorption and ensuing whole-body cholesterol homeostasis. This protein is targeted by ezetimibe, a potent cholesterol absorption inhibitor. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NPC1L1 have been associated to variation in both plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and lipid-lowering medication with ezetimibe. However, there are no data evaluating the impact of NPC1L1 variants on Chilean subjects medicated with ezetimibe monotherapy. Therefore, we assessed the contribution of two unexplored NPC1L1 variants on plasma lipids and response to ezetimibe in Chilean hypercholesterolemic individuals.
Using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), we analyzed the SNP distribution of two common variants; -133A&gt;G (rs17655652) and 1679C&gt;G (rs2072183), and their relation with plasma lipids and lipid-lowering response to ezetimibe in 60 hypercholesterolemic Chilean subjects.
Genotype distribution for the rs17655652 variant was AA 57 %, 40 % AG and 3 % GG, whereas for the rs2072183 SNP was 57 % CC, 35 % CG and 8 % GG. Minor allele frequencies (MAFs) were 0.23 and 0.26, respectively. No association was observed between NPC1L1 SNPs and baseline cholesterol. After therapy, none of the polymorphisms affected ezetimibe response in the studied cohort (P &gt; 0.05).
Data obtained indicates that polymorphisms rs17655652 and rs2072183 were not related to cholesterol variability. Also, lipid-lowering response to ezetimibe is not impacted by the NPC1L1 polymorphisms studied in Chilean hypercholesterolemic subjects.
Prolonged ingestion of a cholesterol- or saturated fatty acid-enriched diet induces chronic, often systemic, auto-inflammatory responses resulting in significant health problems worldwide. In vivo information regarding the local and direct inflammatory effect of these dietary components in the intestine and, in particular, on the intestinal epithelium is lacking. Here we report that both mice and zebrafish exposed to high-fat (HFDs) or high-cholesterol (HCDs) diets develop acute innate inflammatory responses within hours, reflected in the localized interleukin-1β-dependent accumulation of myeloid cells in the intestine. Acute HCD-induced intestinal inflammation is dependent on cholesterol uptake via Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 and inflammasome activation involving apoptosis-associated Speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain, which leads to Caspase-1 activity in intestinal epithelial cells. Extended exposure to HCD results in localized, inflammation-dependent, functional dysregulation as well as systemic pathologies. Our model suggests that dietary cholesterol initiates intestinal inflammation in epithelial cells. 
The correlation between intestinal cholesterol absorption values and plasma low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels remains controversial. Niemann-Pick-C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) is essential for intestinal cholesterol absorption, and is the target of ezetimibe, a cholesterol absorption inhibitor. However, studies with NPC1L1 knockout mice or ezetimibe cannot definitively clarify this correlation because NPC1L1 expression is not restricted to intestine in humans and mice. In this study we sought to genetically address this issue.
We developed a mouse model that lacks endogenous (NPC1L1) and LDL receptor (LDLR) (DKO), but transgenically expresses human NPC1L1 in gastrointestinal tract only (DKO/L1(IntOnly) mice). Our novel model eliminated potential effects of non-intestinal NPC1L1 on cholesterol homeostasis. We found that human NPC1L1 was localized at the intestinal brush border membrane of DKO/L1(IntOnly) mice. Cholesterol feeding induced formation of NPC1L1-positive vesicles beneath this membrane in an ezetimibe-sensitive manner. Compared to DKO mice, DKO/L1(IntOnly) mice showed significant increases in cholesterol absorption and blood/hepatic/biliary cholesterol. Increased blood cholesterol was restricted to very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL fractions, which was associated with increased secretion and plasma levels of apolipoproteins B100 and B48. Additionally, DKO/L1(IntOnly) mice displayed decreased fecal cholesterol excretion and hepatic/intestinal expression of cholesterologenic genes. Ezetimibe treatment virtually reversed all of the transgene-related phenotypes in DKO/L1(IntOnly) mice.
Our findings from DKO/L1(IntOnly) mice clearly demonstrate that NPC1L1-mediated cholesterol absorption is a major determinant of blood levels of apolipoprotein B-containing atherogenic lipoproteins, at least in mice.
Ezetimibe lowers plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by inhibiting the activity of the Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) protein. However, whether such inhibition reduces the risk of coronary heart disease is not known. Human mutations that inactivate a gene encoding a drug target can mimic the action of an inhibitory drug and thus can be used to infer potential effects of that drug.
We sequenced the exons of NPC1L1 in 7364 patients with coronary heart disease and in 14,728 controls without such disease who were of European, African, or South Asian ancestry. We identified carriers of inactivating mutations (nonsense, splice-site, or frameshift mutations). In addition, we genotyped a specific inactivating mutation (p.Arg406X) in 22,590 patients with coronary heart disease and in 68,412 controls. We tested the association between the presence of an inactivating mutation and both plasma lipid levels and the risk of coronary heart disease.
With sequencing, we identified 15 distinct NPC1L1 inactivating mutations; approximately 1 in every 650 persons was a heterozygous carrier for 1 of these mutations. Heterozygous carriers of NPC1L1 inactivating mutations had a mean LDL cholesterol level that was 12 mg per deciliter (0.31 mmol per liter) lower than that in noncarriers (P=0.04). Carrier status was associated with a relative reduction of 53% in the risk of coronary heart disease (odds ratio for carriers, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 0.87; P=0.008). In total, only 11 of 29,954 patients with coronary heart disease had an inactivating mutation (carrier frequency, 0.04%) in contrast to 71 of 83,140 controls (carrier frequency, 0.09%).
Naturally occurring mutations that disrupt NPC1L1 function were found to be associated with reduced plasma LDL cholesterol levels and a reduced risk of coronary heart disease. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others.).
The uptake of circulating low density lipoproteins (LDL) is mediated by LDL receptor (LDLR) through clathrin-dependent endocytosis. At the early stage of this process, adaptor proteins ARH and Dab2 specifically bind the endocytic signal motif in LDLR and recruit clathrin/AP2 to initiate internalization. On the other hand, intestinal cholesterol is absorbed by Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) through clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Another adaptor protein, Numb recognizes the endocytic motif in NPC1L1 C terminus and couples NPC1L1 to endocytic machinery. The ARH, Dab2, and Numb proteins contain a homogeneous phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain that directly binds endocytic motifs. Because ARH, Dab2, and Numb are all PTB domain family members, the emerging mystery is whether these adaptors act complementally in LDLR and NPC1L1 endocytosis. Here, we found that ARH and Dab2 did not bind NPC1L1 and were not required for NPC1L1 internalization. Similarly, Numb lacked the ability to interact with the LDLR C terminus and was dispensable for LDL uptake. Only the Numb isoforms with shorter PTB domain could facilitate NPC1L1 endocytosis. Besides the reported function in intestinal cholesterol absorption, Numb also mediated cholesterol reabsorption from bile in liver. We further identified a Numb variant with G595D substitution in humans of low blood LDL-cholesterol. The G595D substitution impaired NPC1L1 internalization and cholesterol reabsorption, due to attenuating affinity of Numb to clathrin/AP2. These results demonstrate that Numb specifically regulates NPC1L1-mediated cholesterol absorption both in human intestine and liver, distinct from ARH and Dab2, which selectively participate in LDLR-mediated LDL uptake. 
The present study investigated the cholesterol-lowering activity of gingerol- and shogaol-enriched ginger extract (GSE). Thirty hamsters were divided into three groups and fed the control diet or one of the two experimental diets containing 0.5 and 1.0% GSE. Plasma total cholesterol, liver cholesterol, and aorta atherosclerotic plaque were dose-dependently decreased with increasing amounts of GSE added into diets. The fecal sterol analysis showed dietary GSE increased the excretion of both neutral and acidic sterols in a dose-dependent manner. GSE down-regulated the mRNA levels of intestinal Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 protein (NPC1L1), acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 2 (ACAT2), microsomal triacylglycerol transport protein (MTP), and ATP binding cassette transporter 5 (ABCG5), whereas it up-regulated hepatic cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). It was concluded that beneficial modification of the lipoprotein profile by dietary GSE was mediated by enhancing excretion of fecal cholesterol and bile acids via up-regulation of hepatic CYP7A1 and down-regulation of mRNA of intestinal NPC1L1, ACAT2, and MTP. 
Ezetimibe inhibits cholesterol absorption by blocking Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 proteins (NPC1L1) expressed in the small intestine. Because NPC1L1 is also expressed in human liver, ezetimibe conceivably alters biliary lipid compositions. Here, we performed a clinical trial investigating the effect of ezetimibe on biliary lipids using transnasal endoscopy for bile collection.
Eight patients with dyslipidemia enrolled in this study completed blood and bile sampling before and at 3 months after ezetimibe treatment (10 mg/day), and the samples are analyzed.
Endoscopic bile sampling was performed safely and painlessly. Serum sterol-based biomarkers declared decreased cholesterol absorption and increased synthesis. On analysis of biliary lipids, four of the eight patients showed relative decrease of cholesterol and increase of bile acids with improved lithogenicity while the remainder exhibited the symmetrical changes.
Our data suggests that biliary lithogenicity is not worsened by ezetimibe. The regulation of biliary cholesterol is presumably multifactorial such as body cholesterol pool size and biliary cholesterol reabsorption by NPC1L1 in the liver.
Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 protein (NPC1L1) plays a critical role in intestinal cholesterol absorption. Previous studies found that the NPC1L1 c.-133A &gt; G SNP, but not other NPC1L1 SNPs, was associated with response to statin treatment and statin-ezetimibe combinations. To date effect of NPC1L1 c.-133A &gt; G SNP on ezetimibe monotherapy has not been studied. Our objective was to examine whether SNP c.-133A &gt; G at the NPC1L1 gene has effects on lipid levels and on the efficacy of 3, 6 and 12 months of 10 mg daily ezetimibe monotherapy in hyperlipidemic patients with statin induced adverse effects. One hundred and one type IIa and IIb hyperlipidemic patients (72 females, 29 males; age: 61.23 +/- 9.87 ys; BMI: 28.18 +/- 4.29 kg/m2) were enrolled. The genotype frequencies were conformed to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. We could not find significant differences in initial lipid levels between AA and AG + GG patients. While plasma levels of apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) did not significantly decrease after ezetimibe treatment (1.96; 3.39 and 2.74%) in AA patients, a significant elevation in ApoA1 levels has been found after treatment in AG + GG patients (9.15; 8.54 and 13.58%). The effect of NPC1L1 c.-133A &gt; G on the ApoA1 levels was found significant (p &lt; 0.05). Efficacy of treatment with ezetimibe on other plasma lipid parameters after 3, 6 or 12 months did not differ significantly. NPC1L1-133A &gt; G SNP influences the ApoA1 response to ezetimibe monotherapy, therefore, may alter the effect of ezetimibe on the structure and function of the high-density lipoprotein particles.
Intestinal NPC1L1 transporter is essential for cholesterol absorption and the maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis in the body. NPC1L1 is differentially expressed along the gastrointestinal tract with very low levels in the colon as compared with the small intestine. This study was undertaken to examine whether DNA methylation was responsible for segment-specific expression of NPC1L1. Treatment of mice with 5-azacytidine (i.p.) resulted in a significant dose-dependent increase in NPC1L1 mRNA expression in the colon. The lack of expression of NPC1L1 in the normal colon was associated with high levels of methylation in the area flanking the 3-kb fragment upstream of the initiation site of the mouse NPC1L1 gene in mouse colon as analyzed by EpiTYPER® MassARRAY®. The high level of methylation in the colon was observed in specific CpG dinucleotides and was significantly decreased in response to 5-azacytidine. Similar to mouse NPC1L1, 5-azacytidine treatment also increased the level of human NPC1L1 mRNA expression in the intestinal HuTu-80 cell line in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Silencing the expression of DNA methyltransferase DNMT1, -2, -3A, and -3B alone by siRNA did not affect NPC1L1 expression in HuTu-80 cells. However, the simultaneous attenuation of DNMT1 and -3B expression caused a significant increase in NPC1L1 mRNA expression as compared with control. Also, in vitro methylation of the human NPC1L1 promoter significantly decreased NPC1L1 promoter activity in human intestinal Caco2 cells. In conclusion, our data demonstrated for the first time that DNA methylation in the promoter region of the NPC1L1 gene appears to be a major mechanism underlying differential expression of NPC1L1 along the length of the gastrointestinal tract. 
Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) plays a pivotal role in intestinal cholesterol absorption. Ezetimibe is known as an inhibitor for NPC1L1 and decreases concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in blood. Responses of the decrease of serum LDL-C levels to ezetimibe have been reported to be different among NPC1L1 variants. However, there are still limited data concerning the genetic variation in the NPC1L1 gene, specifically, in Japanese patients with dyslipidemia. The purpose of this study is to elucidate genotype and allele frequencies of the NPC1L1 gene in Japanese patients with dyslipidemia.
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. All patients were administered ezetimibe at the dose of 10 mg for once a day either alone or coadministered with statins. Patient's data were retrospectively obtained from their medical records. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood samples and analysed three NPC1L1 SNPs (rs2072183, rs217428 and rs217434) by the direct sequencing method.
We found that there is a significant difference of genotype frequencies between healthy Japanese and dyslipidemic subjects in rs2072183. No significant differences were observed in rs217428 and rs217434; however, comparison of our data with literature reports suggests that there are significant differences in the frequencies of rs217428 and rs217434 between Canadian and Japanese dyslipidemic patients.
Our study is the first report concerning the genotype and allele frequencies of the gene coding for NPC1L1 in Japanese patients with dyslipidemia. The most notable result was to demonstrate that there exists a significant difference in rs2072183 variant between healthy Japanese and dyslipidemic subjects and also found that there exists genetic variation of rs2072183 between Japanese and Canadian patients with dyslipidemia. Our results are expected to facilitate research in the proper use of ezetimibe-based mono- or combination therapies. Further studies will be required to evaluate the effects of rs2072183 on the efficacy of LDL cholesterol reduction by ezetimibe.
Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) mediates cholesterol absorption, and ezetimibe is a potent NPC1L1 inhibitor applicable for medication of hypercholesterolemia. Epidemiological studies demonstrated that consumption of polyphenols correlates with a decreased risk for atherosclerosis due to their antioxidant effect. This activity can hardly be attributable to the antioxidant activity only, and we hypothesized that polyphenols inhibit intestinal transport of cholesterol. We elucidated the kinetic parameters of intestinal cholesterol absorption, screened several polyphenols for their ability to specifically inhibit intestinal cholesterol absorption, and determined the inhibitory effects of selected flavonoids in vitro and in vivo. The concentration-dependent uptake of cholesterol by Caco-2 cells obeyed a monophasic saturation process. This indicates the involvement of an active-passive transport, i.e., NPC1L1. Parameters of cholesterol uptake by Caco-2 cells were as follows: Jmax, Kt, and Kd were 6.89±2.96 19.03±11.58 µM, and 0.11±0.02 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively. Luteolin and quercetin inhibited cholesterol absorption by Caco-2 cells and human embryonic kidney 293T cells expressing NPC1L1. When preincubated Caco-2 cells with luteolin and quercetin before the assay, cholesterol uptake significantly decreased. The inhibitory effects of these flavonoids were maintained for up to 120 min. The level of inhibition and irreversible effects were similar to that of ezetimibe. Serum cholesterol levels significantly decreased more in rats fed both cholesterol and luteolin (or quercetin), than in those observed in the cholesterol feeding group. As quercetin induced a significant decrease in the levels of NPC1L1 mRNA in Caco-2 cells, the in vivo inhibitory effect may be due to the expression of NPC1L1. These results suggest that luteolin and quercetin reduce high blood cholesterol levels by specifically inhibiting intestinal cholesterol absorption mediated by NPC1L1. 
Cholesterol, derived from two different sources of endogenous synthesis and diet, is essential for the growth and maintenance of mammalian cells. However, elevated level of serum cholesterol is among the associated risk factors for the coronary heart disease. Statins can reduce endogenous sterol synthesis by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, whereas cholesterol absorption inhibitors, such as ezetimibe, can block cholesterol uptake from dietary sources by blocking Niemann- Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1).
The present review focuses on the main research progress of cholesterol absorption inhibitors, the structure of NPC1L1 and discovery of novel chemical entities by virtual screening.
Studies on the structure-activity relationship reveal that azetidinone is important to maintain activity in azetidinone derivatives and the novel heterocyclic compounds with replacement of β-lactam scaffold by oxazolidinone also show similar activity as ezetimibe. Moreover, virtual screening is a computer-aided molecular design tool to propose novel cholesterol absorption inhibitors.
Some compounds in the garlic inhibit cholesterol synthesis, resulting in lowering of serum cholesterol and triglycerides and increase in HDL level. However, the mechanism of this specific effect is not fully understood. In the small intestine, ATP-binding cassette transporters G5, G8 and A1 (ABCG5, ABCG8 and ABCA1), as well as Niemann-Pick C1 like 1 (NPC1L1) protein have important roles in cholesterol metabolism. In this study, we evaluated the beneficial effect of aqueous extract of garlic on lipid profile and also expression of npc1l1, abca1, abcg5 and abcg8 genes in the intestine of N-Marry mice fed a high cholesterol diet as a possible mechanism of garlic effect. Twenty-four mice were randomly divided into three groups: Group 1: hypercholesterolmic (received chow + 2% cholesterol + 0.5% cholic acid); Group 2: garlic (received chow + 4% (w/w) garlic extract + 2% cholesterol + 0.5% cholic acid); and Group 3: received chow only. After one month, mice were anesthetized and blood was collected from their heart. The jejunum was removed, washed with PBS and entrocytes were scraped and used for the experiments. Serum lipids were measured enzymatically and expression of mRNA levels for the above-mentioned proteins was determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Garlic extract significantly reduced serum lipids (p &lt; 0.05), compared with the hypercholesterolemic group. Expression of the intestinal npc1l1 was significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.01) in the garlic group, compared with the chow group, while abcg5 (p &lt; 0.01), abcg8 (p &lt; 0.01) and abca1 (p &lt; 0.05) expressions were significantly increased. In conclusion, this study reveals a possible mechanism for the beneficial effects of the garlic in lowering serum lipids by decreasing the intestinal lipid absorption and increasing excretion of cholesterol back into the intestinal lumen.
Excessive absorption of intestinal cholesterol is a risk factor for atherosclerosis. This report examines the effect of cholecystokinin (CCK) on plasma cholesterol level and intestinal cholesterol absorption using the in vivo models of C57BL/6 wild-type and low density lipoprotein receptor knock-out (LDLR(-/-)) mice. These data were supported by in vitro studies involving mouse primary intestinal epithelial cells and human Caco-2 cells; both express CCK receptor 1 and 2 (CCK1R and CCK2R). We found that intravenous injection of [Thr(28),Nle(31)]CCK increased plasma cholesterol levels and intestinal cholesterol absorption in both wild-type and LDLR(-/-) mice. Treatment of mouse primary intestinal epithelial cells with [Thr(28),Nle(31)]CCK increased cholesterol absorption, whereas selective inhibition of CCK1R and CCK2R with antagonists attenuated CCK-induced cholesterol absorption. In Caco-2 cells, CCK enhanced CCK1R/CCK2R heterodimerization. Knockdown of both CCK1R and CCK2 or either one of them diminished CCK-induced cholesterol absorption to the same extent. CCK also increased cell surface-associated NPC1L1 (Niemann-Pick C1-like 1) transporters but did not alter their total protein expression. Inhibition or knockdown of NPC1L1 attenuated CCK-induced cholesterol absorption. CCK enhanced phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt phosphorylation and augmented the interaction between NPC1L1 and Rab11a (Rab-GTPase-11a), whereas knockdown of CCK receptors or inhibition of G protein βγ dimer (Gβγ) diminished CCK-induced PI3K and Akt phosphorylation. Inhibition of PI3K and Akt or knockdown of PI3K diminished CCK-induced NPC1L1-Rab11a interaction and cholesterol absorption. Knockdown of Rab11a suppressed CCK-induced NPC1L1 translocation and cholesterol absorption. These data imply that CCK enhances cholesterol absorption by activation of a pathway involving CCK1R/CCK2R, Gβγ, PI3K, Akt, Rab11a, and NPC1L. 
We previously showed that dietary sphingomyelin (SM) inhibited cholesterol absorption in animals. The key enzyme hydrolyzing SM in the gut is alkaline sphingomyelinase (alk-SMase, nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 7). Here using the fecal dual-isotope ratio method we compared cholesterol absorption in the wild-type (WT) and alk-SMase knockout (KO) mice. The animals were fed an emulsion containing [(14)C]cholesterol and [(3)H]sitosterol. The radioactivities in the lipids of the fecal samples collected 4, 8, and 24 h thereafter were determined, and the ratio of (14)C/(3)H was calculated. We found that the fecal [(14)C]cholesterol recovery in the KO mice was significantly higher than in the WT mice. A maximal 92% increase occurred 8 h after feeding. Recovery of [(3)H]sitosterol did not differ between the two groups. Accordingly, the (14)C-to-(3)H ratio of fecal lipids was 133% higher at 8 h and 75% higher at 24 h in the KO than in the WT mice. Decreased [(14)C]cholesterol was also found in the serum of the KO mice 4 h after feeding. Supplement of SM in the emulsion reduced the differences in fecal [(14)C]cholesterol recovery between the WT and KO mice because of a greater increase of [(14)C]cholesterol recovery in the WT mice. Without treatment, the KO mice had significantly higher SM levels in the intestinal content and feces, but not in the intestinal mucosa or serum. The expression of Niemann-Pick C1 like 1 protein in the small intestine was not changed. In conclusion, alk-SMase is a physiological factor promoting cholesterol absorption by reducing SM levels in the intestinal lumen.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection induces steatosis and is accompanied by multiple metabolic alterations including hyperuricemia, reversible hypocholesterolemia and insulin resistance. Total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and triglyceride levels are increased by peginterferon and ribavirin combination therapy when a sustained virologic response (SVR) is achieved in patients with HCV. Steatosis is significantly more common in patients with HCV genotype 3 but interferon-free regimens are not always effective for treating HCV genotype 3 infections. HCV infection increases fatty acid synthase levels, resulting in the accumulation of fatty acids in hepatocytes. Of note, low-density lipoprotein receptor, scavenger receptor class B type I and Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 proteins are candidate receptors that may be involved in HCV. They are also required for the uptake of cholesterol from the external environment of hepatocytes. Among HCV-infected patients with or without human immunodeficiency virus infection, changes in serum lipid profiles are observed during interferon-free treatment and after the achievement of an SVR. It is evident that HCV affects cholesterol metabolism during interferon-free regimens. Although higher SVR rates were achieved with interferon-free treatment of HCV, special attention must also be paid to unexpected adverse events based on host metabolic changes including hyperlipidemia.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) is a well-known therapeutic target for treating hyperlipidemia. K-877 is a novel selective PPARα modulator (SPPARMα) that enhances PPARα transcriptional activity with high selectivity and potency, resulting in reduced plasma lipid levels. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of K-877 on hyperlipidemia in low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout (Ldlr-/-) mice, a mouse model of atherosclerosis. We revealed that K-877 administration significantly decreased plasma triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) levels and increased plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels in Ldlr-/- mice. K-877 administration to Ldlr-/- mice efficiently increased the gene expression of PPARα and its target genes related to fatty acid oxidation in the liver and small intestine. The same treatment significantly increased ATP-binding cassette a1 gene expression in the liver and small intestine and reduced Niemann Pick C1-like 1 gene expression in the small intestine, suggesting that K-877 administration induced HDL-C production in the liver and small intestine and reduced cholesterol absorption in the small intestine. In conclusion, K-877 administration had pronounced effects on the liver and small intestine in Ldlr-/- mice. K-877 is an attractive PPARα-modulating drug for treating hyperlipidemia that works equally well in both the liver and small intestine.
Humans cannot synthesize fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamin E and vitamin K. For this reason, they must be obtained from the diet via intestinal absorption. As the deficiency or excess of these vitamins has been reported to cause several types of diseases and disorders in humans, the intestinal absorption of these nutrients must be properly regulated to ensure good health. However, the mechanism of their intestinal absorption remains poorly understood. Recent studies on cholesterol using genome-edited mice, genome-wide association approaches, gene mutation analyses, and the development of cholesterol absorption inhibitors have revealed that several membrane proteins play crucial roles in the intestinal absorption of cholesterol. Surprisingly, detailed analyses of these cholesterol transporters have revealed that they can also transport vitamin E and vitamin K, providing clues to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying the intestinal absorption of these fat-soluble vitamins. In this review, we focus on the membrane proteins (Niemann-Pick C1 like 1, scavenger receptor class B type I, cluster of differentiation 36, and ATP-binding cassette transporter A1) that are (potentially) involved in the intestinal absorption of cholesterol, vitamin E, and vitamin K and discuss their physiological and pharmacological importance. We also discuss the related uncertainties that need to be explored in future studies.
Inhibition of CD36, a fatty acid transporter, has been reported to prevent glucotoxicity and ameliorate high glucose induced beta cell dysfunction. Ezetimibe is a selective cholesterol absorption inhibitor that blocks Niemann Pick C1-like 1 protein, but may exert its effect through suppression of CD36. We attempted to clarify the beneficial effect of ezetimibe on insulin secreting cells and to determine whether this effect is related to change of CD36 expression. mRNA expression of insulin and CD36, intracellular peroxide level and glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) under normal (5.6 mM) or high glucose (30 mM) condition in INS-1 cells and primary rat islet cells were compared. Changes of the aforementioned factors with treatment with ezetimibe (20 μM) under normal or high glucose condition were also assessed. mRNA expression of insulin was decreased with high glucose, which was reversed by ezetimibe in both INS-1 cells and primary rat islets. CD36 mRNA expression was increased with high glucose, but decreased by ezetimibe in INS-1 cells and primary rat islets. Three-day treatment with high glucose resulted in an increase in intracellular peroxide level; however, it was decreased by treatment with ezetimibe. Decrease in GSIS by three-day treatment with high glucose was reversed by ezetimibe. Palmitate uptake following exposure to high glucose conditions for three days was significantly elevated, which was reversed by ezetimibe in INS-1 cells. Ezetimibe may prevent glucotoxicity in pancreatic β-cells through a decrease in fatty acid influx via inhibition of CD36. 
Dietary and biliary cholesterol absorption contributes to the maintenance of tight control of cholesterol homeostasis. Cholesterol is present as mixed micelles formed by bile salts and phospholipids in the intestinal lumen. Recently, Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) transporter was identified as being critical for cholesterol absorption. However, the uptake mechanism of an enveloped substrate of NPC1L1 in whole lipid emulsion particles remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the uptake mechanism of a substrate of NPC1L1 in lipid emulsion particles. We also investigated whether these particles containing cholesterol can improve the intestinal absorption of other lipophilic components via NPC1L1. The uptake of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)-4,4-difluoro-5-(4-phenyl-1,3-butadienyl)-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-propionic acid saccinimidyl ester (BODIPY), a fluorescently labeled phospholipid, in lipid emulsion particles containing cholesterol (1 µM) was significantly increased compared to that without cholesterol in Caco-2 cells. On the other hand, its increased uptake was significantly inhibited by ezetimibe, a selective inhibitor of NPC1L1. These results suggested that not only cholesterol but also some components in lipid emulsion particles are taken up into enterocytes via NPC1L1. We also examined an approach to improve intestinal absorption of a poorly absorbed water-insoluble component, coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), by this mechanism. The uptake of CoQ10 in lipid emulsion particles containing cholesterol was significantly increased compared to that without cholesterol. Its increased uptake was significantly inhibited by ezetimibe. Though it is still not clear whether CoQ10 is a substrate of NPC1L1, there is a potential for improvement of the absorption of poorly absorbed components by lipid emulsion particles containing cholesterol. 
Research investigating the associations between stress-related negative emotions and alcohol consumption often assumes a linear dose-response relationship. Based on the current theories of emotions, we questioned this assumption and hypothesized that both very low and very high levels of negative emotional response (NER) to stressful life events are related to increased alcohol consumption.
We used data from Phases 1 (1985-88) and 2 (1989-90) of the British Whitehall II study. At both phases, participants reported on their alcohol consumption, recent stressful events and the NER to the events. Two thousand and sixteen participants without recent stressful events at baseline were selected. Logistic regression was used to model the association between emotional response at baseline and increased frequency of alcohol consumption between the two phases.
The likelihood of increased alcohol consumption increased with the number of recent stressful events. Among participants with at least one event, 17% increased alcohol consumption, compared with 14% of those who reported no events. Participants with average NER were at lowest risk (14%) of increasing alcohol consumption after major life events. Those with highest NER were significantly more likely to increase alcohol consumption (20%) than those with average NER, but the difference between those with highest NER and those with lowest NER (17%) was not statistically significant.
Increases in alcohol consumption following stressful events are least likely if people experience moderate levels of NER to events. Negative emotions in moderate doses should not be regarded as a risk factor for unhealthy behaviours, but rather a potentially protective factor.
Disease named entity recognition (NER) plays an important role in biomedical research. There are a significant number of challenging issues to be addressed; among these, the identification of rare diseases and complex disease names and the problem of tagging inconsistency (i.e., if an entity is tagged differently in a document) are attracting substantial research attention.
We propose a new neural network method named Dic-Att-BiLSTM-CRF (DABLC) for disease NER. DABLC applies an efficient exact string matching method to match disease entities with a disease dictionary; here, the dictionary is constructed based on the Disease Ontology. Furthermore, DABLC constructs a dictionary attention layer by incorporating a disease dictionary matching method and document-level attention mechanism. Finally, a bidirectional long short-term memory network and conditional random field (BiLSTM-CRF) with a dictionary attention layer is proposed to combine the disease dictionary to develop disease NER.
Extensive experiments are conducted on two widely-used corpora: the NCBI disease corpus and the BioCreative V CDR corpus. We apply each test on 10 executions of each model, with a 95% confidence interval. DABLC achieves the highest F1 scores (NCBI: Precision = 0.883, Recall = 0.89, F1 = 0.886; BioCreative V CDR: Precision = 0.891, Recall = 0.875, F1 = 0.883), outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.
DABLC combines the advantages of both external dictionary resources and deep attention neural networks. This aids the identification of rare diseases and complex disease names; moreover, it reduces the impact of tagging inconsistency. Special disease NER and deep learning models addressing long sentences are noteworthy areas for future examination.
We aimed to evaluate the utility of dynamic contrast-enhanced T1-weighted perfusion MR imaging (DCE-pMRI) to predict certain immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarkers of glioblastoma (GB) in this pilot study.
We retrospectively reviewed thirty-six patients (M/F: 25/11, mean age: 53, age range: 29-85 years) who had pretreatment DCE-pMRI with IHC analysis of their excised GBs. ROIs of the enhancing tumor (ER) and non-enhancing peritumoral region (NER) were used to calculate DCE-pMRI parameters of Ktrans, Kep, Ve, iAUC, and MaxSlope. IHC biomarkers including Ki-67 labeling index, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), oligodendrocyte transcription factor-2 (OLIG2), isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1), and p53 mutation status were determined. The imaging metrics of GB with IHC markers were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test and Spearman correlation analysis.
Among 30 patients with available IDH1 status, 14 (46.6%) patients had IDH1 mutation. EGFR amplification was present in 24/36 (66.6%) patients. Mean Ki-67 labeling index was 29% (range:1.5-80%). p53 mutation was present in 20/36 (55%), while OLIG2 expression was positive in 29/36 (80.5%) of GBs. Various DCE-pMRI parameters gathered from the ER and NER were significantly correlated with IDH1 mutation, EGFR amplification, and OLIG2 expression (p &lt; 0.05). Ki-67 labeling index revealed a strong positive correlation with iAUC (r = 0.619, p &lt; 0.001).
DCE-pMRI could determine surrogate IHC biomarkers in GB via tumoral and peritumoral approach, potential targets for individualized treatment protocols.
DNA repair has been hypothesized to be a longevity determinant, but the evidence for it is based largely on accelerated aging phenotypes of DNA repair mutants. Here, using a panel of 18 rodent species with diverse lifespans, we show that more robust DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, but not nucleotide excision repair (NER), coevolves with longevity. Evolution of NER, unlike DSB, is shaped primarily by sunlight exposure. We further show that the capacity of the SIRT6 protein to promote DSB repair accounts for a major part of the variation in DSB repair efficacy between short- and long-lived species. We dissected the molecular differences between a weak (mouse) and a strong (beaver) SIRT6 protein and identified five amino acid residues that are fully responsible for their differential activities. Our findings demonstrate that DSB repair and SIRT6 have been optimized during the evolution of longevity, which provides new targets for anti-aging interventions.
The impact of the dimensional parameters of the pharyngeal bony frame by its length, width and the position of the hyoid upon the severity of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) has not been investigated in depth. Interactions of those parameters with body mass index (BMI) and their overall reciprocal effect on OSAS severity have also not been established.
This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on 108 male OSAS patients followed in OSAS outpatient clinics between November 2014 and October 2015. They all underwent a polysomnography test, and an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was calculated. They also underwent an upper airway computerized tomographic scan in which three craniofacial parameters were evaluated: inter-pterygoid distance (IPD), hard palate-to-hyoid (HP-H) distance, and gnathion plane-to-hyoid (GP-H) distance.
A longer pharynx and an inferiorly placed hyoid bone correlated with the AHI (r = 0.33, p = 0.001 and r = 0.226, p = 0.03, respectively). GP-H correlated with body mass index (BMI) (r = 0.3243, p &lt; 0.001), while HP-H and IPD did not. We found an interaction between BMI and HP-H, but none between GP-H and BMI. IPD did not correlate with OSAS severity, but it correlates with the age of the OSAS patients (r = 0.235, p = 0.015).
Pharynx length and hyoid position have significant effects upon OSAS severity, and they interact differently with BMI in terms of those effects. Hard palate width increases with age but has no correlation with OSAS severity.
Spermatozoa bind a variety of proteins as they pass through the proximal regions of the epididymis, where they acquire forward motility and fertilizing ability. Recent evidence indicates that certain epididymis-specific secretory proteins that bind sperm have antibacterial activity and may function as part of the innate immune system. We reported earlier that ESC42, now designated human beta-defensin 118 (DEFB118), is a sperm-binding protein. In this study, we demonstrate that DEFB118 has potent antibacterial activity that is dose, time, and structure dependent. Incubation of Escherichia coli for 60 min with 10 microg/ml DEFB118 reduced bacterial survival to 20% of the control, and 25 microg/ml reduced survival to 5% of the control. DEFB118 concentrations of 50 and 100 microg/ml further reduced survival to less than 2 and 1%, respectively. A biphasic effect of salt concentration on the antibacterial activity of DEFB118 was observed. Reduction of disulfide bonds and alkylation of cysteines resulted in the complete loss of antibacterial activity. DEFB118 caused rapid permeabilization of both outer and inner membranes of E. coli and striking morphological alterations in the bacterial surfaces visible by scanning electron microscopy consistent with a membrane-disruptive mechanism of bacterial killing. In contrast, eukaryotic cell membranes were not permeabilized by DEFB118, as indicated by the rat erythrocyte hemolytic assay. Studies on DEFB118 inhibition of macromolecular synthesis and membrane permeability in E. coli were consistent with a primary effect at the cell membrane level. DEFB118 may contribute to epididymal innate immunity and protect the sperm against attack by microorganisms in the male and female reproductive tracts.
During passage through the epididymis, sperm interact with secreted epididymal proteins that promote maturation, including the acquisition of motility and fertilization competence. Viewed previously as distinct from sperm maturation, host defence capabilities are now recognized functions of the human epididymis 2 (HE2) family of sperm-binding proteins. We analysed the potent dose and time-dependent bactericidal activity of recombinant HE2alpha, HE2beta1 and HE2beta2 and found that the full-length proteins (10 microg/ml or approximately 1 microM) caused more than a 50% decrease in Escherichia coli colony forming units within 15 min. By contrast, human beta-defensin-1, at a similar concentration, required more than 90 min to exhibit similar antibacterial activity. The epididymis-specific lipocalin, LCN6, failed to kill bacteria. Higher concentrations (25-100 microg/ml) of HE2 proteins and a longer duration of treatment resulted in near total inhibition of bacterial growth. The C-terminal peptides of HE2alpha, HEbeta1 and HEbeta2 proteins exhibited antibacterial activity similar to their full-length counterparts, indicating that the antibacterial activity of HE2 proteins resides in these C-terminal regions. Antibacterial activities of HE2 proteins and peptides were slightly inhibited by NaCl concentrations of up to 150 mM, while human beta-defensin-1 activity was nearly eliminated. Reduction and alkylation of disulphide bonds in HE2 proteins and their C-terminal peptides abolished their antibacterial activity. Consistent with the ability to kill bacteria, full-length HE2 proteins and C-terminal peptides caused rapid dose-dependent permeabilization of outer and cytoplasmic E. coli membranes. A much longer exposure time was required for human beta-defensin-1-mediated permeabilization of membranes, suggesting a possible difference in mode of action compared with the HE2 antibacterial peptides.
Human Epididymis-specific protein 6 [HE6 (GPR64)] is a highly conserved, tissue-specific seven-transmembrane receptor of the human epididymis. The rodent counterparts were cloned and 5'-inverse PCR employed to confirm that the cDNA sequences were full length. Downstream from the highly conserved signal peptide-coding sequence, the 5'-regions contained at least six mini-exons of less than 50 nucleotides. Multiple splice variants involving these mini-exons were cloned in the human, the majority of which was also found in rodents. Northern blot analysis showed that the tissue distribution of the mRNA was very similar in human and rodents. The human HE6 gene was assigned to the X chromosome in a region, which is syntenic to the mouse. The HE6 sequence predicted a two-subunit receptor of the LNB-TM7 subfamily. A membrane preparation and protein solubilization method was adopted to identify the endogenous epididymal proteins. Two sets of peptides were chosen for antibody production, assuming that protein scission had occurred within the conserved GPS-motif. Western blot analysis revealed abundant two-subunit proteins in human and rodents, comprising an approximately 180 kDa hydrophilic ectosubunit and a &lt;40 kDa hydrophobic endosubunit. Deglycosylation experiments showed that the large ectosubunits were highly glycosylated, the carbohydrate side chains dramatically increasing the apparent molecular mass. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that both subunits were associated with apical membranes of efferent ductule and proximal epididymal duct epithelia.
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are involved in cell recognition and signaling and their function has been experimentally determined by ligand activation and site-directed mutagenesis. Structurally, GPCRs consist of an extracellular N-terminus and an intracellular C-terminus separated by seven helical transmembrane domains (TM7). The extracellular region is highly glycosylated. The intracellular region binds to G proteins. An epididymal GPCR, designated HE6 (for human epididymis-specific protein 6), is present in the stereocilia projecting from the apical domain of principal cells into the epididymal lumen. In conceptual terms, HE6 wears two hats: an unusually long extracellular region characteristic of cell adhesion proteins, and an intracellular region with binding affinity to G protein. The binding partner to the long extracellular region has not been identified. HE6 has another remarkable feature comparable to the GPCR calcium-independent receptor of alpha-latrotoxin, designated CIRL. Both HE6 and CIRL are endogenously cleaved into two pieces at the GPCR proteolytic site (GPS) located adjacent to TM1, the first of the seven transmembrane helices. One fragment of the heterodimer wears the cell adhesion hat; the other retains the typical characteristics of GPCRs. This proteolytic processing may be regarded as a mechanism of molecular compartmentalization of cell adhesion and G protein activation functions. The latter may engage a beta-arrestin-driven endocytic trafficking mechanism independent from the adhesive properties of the mucin extracellular domain. It is also conceivable that events taking place in the epididymal lumen can be surveyed by the long adhesive rod and subsequently coupled inside principal cells to a signaling cascade.
In primates, expression of the EP2 gene is androgen-dependent and epididymis-specific. EP2 mRNA expression was investigated in caput, corpus, and cauda regions of rat epididymis and in 15 other rat tissues. Polymerase chain reaction and Northern analyses showed that rat EP2 is expressed predominantly in the proximal caput epididymidis. EP2 mRNA expression was determined in proximal epididymides from castrated, sham-operated, and efferent duct-ligated rats. In castrated rats, EP2 mRNA decreased to &lt;10% of that in sham-operated rats between Days 3 and 4 postcastration, demonstrating the androgen dependence of EP2 expression. In epididymides ligated unilaterally at the efferent ducts, EP2 mRNA levels were approximately equal to those in the unligated contralateral epididymides or in sham-operated rats, indicating that EP2 expression does not depend on testicular factors. In bilaterally castrated rats, immediate and delayed testosterone replacement showed the dependence of EP2 expression on circulating androgens. Injection of testosterone propionate (TP) on Days 0, 1, 2, and 3 postcastration maintained EP2 mRNA levels approximately equal to those in sham-operated rats. Starting at Day 4 postcastration, daily injection of TP for 7 days restored EP2 mRNA to approximately normal levels. These data indicate for the rat that EP2 is expressed specifically in the proximal caput epididymidis and that its expression depends on circulating androgens but not on testicular factors.
The EP2 gene codes for a family of androgen-dependent, epididymis-specific secretory proteins. Using probes derived from human HE2 cDNA, a chimpanzee epididymal cDNA library was screened. Five variants of chimpanzee EP2 cDNA were identified. Variant 1 (EP2A) is the chimpanzee ortholog of HE2. Variant 2 (EP2B) has an alternative 5' end. Variant 3 (EP2C) has an alternative 3' end. Two additional variants were identified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis. Variant 4 (EP2D) and variant 5 (EP2E) appear to lack an exon, resulting in a shift in the open reading frame. Presumably, the 5 variants originate from the same gene and result from alternative promoters and alternative splicing. Each of the putative proteins encoded by these variant messages has a leader sequence characteristic for a secretory protein. After removal of the leader sequence, each of these proteins is predicted to consist of 1 or 2 out of 4 possible peptide modules. Two of these modules have no recognizable homology to known proteins. The other 2 modules have a distribution of cysteine residues characteristic for beta-defensins, a family of proteins with antimicrobial activity.
We report the isolation and characterisation of cDNAs encoding three different, human members of the cysteine-rich secretory protein (CRISP) family. The novel CRISP-1 exists in five cDNA subtypes differing by the presence or absence of a stretch coding for a C-terminal cysteine-rich domain so far found in all members of the family, and by the length of their 3'-untranslated region. CRISP-2 cDNA corresponds to the previously described TPX1 form, with so far unreported 5'-untranslated sequence heterogeneities while CRISP-3 cDNA codes for a new, unique protein. Northern blot analysis of various human organs indicates that CRISP-1 transcripts are epididymis-specific whereas CRISP-2/TPX1 transcripts are detected mainly in the testis and also in the epididymis. CRISP-3 transcripts are more widely distributed and found predominantly in the salivary gland, pancreas and prostate, and in less abundance in the epididymis, ovary, thymus and colon. A protein reacting with an anti-mouse CRISP-1 antibody was isolated from human epididymal extracts and N-terminal sequencing revealed that it corresponded to the CRISP-1 cDNA we have isolated. In contrast to findings on its rat counterpart epididymal protein DE/acidic epididymal glycoprotein (AEG), no significant association of CRISP-1 with human spermatozoa was observed.
CA6 antibody was selected out of a monoclonal antibody library raised against human sperm proteins primarily for its ability to recognize an epididymal antigen and to modify sperm adhesion to zona-free hamster oocytes. In the present study, CA6 was shown to decrease sperm binding to zona-free hamster and human oocytes by 40-92% and 38-48%, respectively. The corresponding protein, which was referred to as FLB1, was found to be secreted by the epididymis and to bind specifically to a human, macaque, and rodent subacrosomal sperm region. Western blotting revealed a molecular mass of 94 kDa in human epididymal extracts and of 100 kDa in human, macaque, mouse, rat, and hamster sperm, suggesting further modifications after its binding to sperm. An equivalent protein was not observed in human liver, ovary, testis, plasma, or epidermis. Two-dimensional electrophoresis showed that FLB1 is formed of two subunits with the same 47-kDa molecular mass and slightly different pI (5.8, 5.9). Microsequencing of the protein revealed a partial homology with human cytokeratins 1 and 10. These results suggest that FLB1 is an epididymis-specific cytokeratin-like protein that is involved in the sperm-oocyte recognition process.
Differential screening of a human epididymal cDNA library led to the isolation and characterization of a major epididymis-specific cDNA clone family, referred to as HE3. More detailed sequence and PCR analysis identified two different but homologous gene transcripts, HE3 alpha and HE3 beta. The former represents an mRNA of ca. 1 kb, encoding a putative small secretory polypeptide of 14903 MW. The HE3 beta transcript was only found as incomplete 3' fragments. Analysis of human genomic DNA by Southern blotting suggested the presence in the human genome of at least three independent HE3-related genes. Isolation of genomic clones for the HE3 alpha gene showed this to contain a single intron of 1.4 kb in the 5' noncoding region. Although genomic clones corresponding to HE3 beta could not be found, a third highly homologous gene, HE3 gamma, was identified as a potential pseudogene. Neither nucleotide nor encoded amino acid sequences of the HE3 gene family are related to any other known sequence in the central databases, and thus represents a novel human gene family, with at least three nonallelic members. Northern hybridization analysis showed that HE3 gene products are specifically expressed in the human epididymis, and not in any other tissue examined. Furthermore, except for the pig, no other nonprimate species has been identified to express homologous sequences in the epididymis. RNase protection assays showed that both the HE3 alpha and HE3 beta, but not the HE3 gamma genes, are expressed in the human epididymis.
cDNA probes derived from genes expressed specifically in the human epididymis were used to examine gene expression in the epididymides of boar, bull and stallion by Northern hybridization. Two probes for the HE1 and HE4 gene products were found to recognize tissue-specific transcripts in all three species, with a regionally differential distribution within the epididymis. Additionally, antibodies recognizing the HE4 protein were shown to react specifically in the epididymis of the boar and bull. An extensive study of the boar showed that, whereas mRNA for the HE1-homologue was up-regulated markedly only at puberty, the HE4-homologue was already present at moderate levels prepubertally. The distribution of the HE1-homologue changed at sexual maturity from a maximum in the cauda epididymis in the 3-4-week-old pig, to a maximum in the corpus/caput region in the adult, while the shift was in the opposite direction for the HE4-homologue. Evidently, gene expression is not fixed regionally through epididymal development in this species. The abdominal epididymis of a hemicryptorchid pig also showed a differential change in expression for the two gene products by comparison with the scrotal testis from the same animal. The results suggest that the HE1 and HE4 gene homologues may be sensitive markers for physiological changes within the mammalian epididymis, and that the boar could prove a useful model to examine the regulation of these human epididymal transcripts.
A differential library screening procedure was used to clone a novel abundant and tissue-specific cDNA from the dog epididymis. It was tentatively named CE7 for dog epididymal gene product 7. By sequence similarity to homologous counterparts expressed in mice, rats, pigs, and macaque monkeys, it appears that the 1.5 kb dog epididymal mRNA encodes the secretory glutathione peroxidase-like protein, GPX5. This protein is very similar to the family of glutathione peroxidase enzymes, but does not contain selenocysteine. Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses revealed that the mRNA encoding CE7/GPX5, like its species homologues, was restricted to the epididymis and transcribed by the epithelial cells in the proximal parts of the organ. While the CE7 cDNA probe cross-hybridized to epididymal mRNAs in most species included in this study, it failed to identify a human GPX5 counterpart. Northern blot analyses of epididymal RNA extracts from hemi-cryptorchid dogs suggested that testicular secretions, including androgen hormones, temperature effects, or both, were involved in the region-dependent modulation of mRNA encoding CE7 in the dog epididymis. The effect was most obvious in the caput region of the abdominal organ where the mRNA encoding CE7 was almost completely downregulated.
We have shown in earlier studies, using a mouse model, that the expression of the glutathione peroxidase 5 protein (GPX5) is restricted to the epididymis and that the accumulation of its corresponding mRNA is hormonally, spatially and temporally regulated throughout postnatal development. We report here, using run-on assays, transient expression experiments as well as gel-shift and footprinting analyses on the findings that at least part of the androgenic control of the GPX5 expression is exerted at the transcriptional level via an androgen response element localized in the distal promoter region of the GPX5 gene. The gpx5 androgen response element (ARE) is found to be consistent with the consensus palindromic steroid-receptor target sequence 5'-AGWACWnnnTGTYCT-3' but exhibits a quite weak conservation in the left half site. The data presented here further expand the diversity of sequence able to confer androgen responsiveness.
A novel gene product, HE6, showing homology to the seven transmembrane-domain (Tm7) receptor superfamily, has been cloned by differential screening from a human epididymal cDNA library. The cDNA clone represented an abundant approximately 5-kb mRNA, comprising 0.01% of the cDNA library. Northern blot analysis including various human tissues revealed an epididymis-specific expression. In situ transcript hybridization localized the mRNA within the epithelial cells lining the epididymal duct. Southern blot analysis, employing a fragment encoding part of the amino-terminal extracellular domain as a probe, identified an autosomal single-copy gene in the human genome. Homologous cDNA products showing 90% sequence identity were observed in the epididymides of all mammalian species investigated. A cloning and sequencing strategy, combining approximately 3.7-kb cDNA fragments obtained by conventional cDNA library construction with overlapping 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) fragments, yielded total sequence information of 4.7 kb for the human mRNA. This sequence comprises a long open reading frame of 3.1 kb. A homology search for related sequences revealed highest similarity (25% amino acid identity) with the secretin/vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors. The predicted extracellular amino-terminal extension, however, was much longer than in the other members, and showed similarity to highly glycosylated mucin-like cell-surface molecules.
The objective of the present study was to investigate in healthy young women the fluctuations in serum concentration of human epididymal secretory protein human epididymis-specific protein 4 (HE4) and CA125 during the phases of the menstrual cycle and the correlation between HE4 and CA125 values and age. Forty women with regular menstrual cycles were included in the study. Pelvic and transvaginal ultrasound were performed in order to exclude ovarian pathologies. Blood samples were collected at follicular (FP), ovulatory (OP), and luteal (LP) phases of the hormonal cycle. The values of HE4 (expressed as picomoles per liter) observed were (mean ± SEM) 39.1 ± 1.1 (FP), 45.3 ± 1.19 (OP), and 42.0 ± 1.3 (LP). The difference between FP and OP was statistically significant (p = 0.0002). By contrast, serum CA125 levels (expressed as units per milliliter) were 14.35 ± 0.66 (FP), 13.15 ± 0.54 (OP), and 13.70 ± 0.54 (LP), respectively. The levels of HE4 observed in serum samples of women below 35 years were 37.5 ± 1.28 in the FP, 46.6 ± 1.4 in the OP, and 42.8 ± 1.49 in the LP. In this group, a statistically significant difference was observed in the FP compared with the OP (p &lt; 0.0001), whereas no statistically significant difference was observed during the different hormonal phases in the group of women over 35. In conclusion, the correct interpretation of laboratory data is essential to define a threshold of normality, and for what concerns HE4 levels, the menstrual cycle phase-dependent variability appears indicated in the interpretation of the results.
BIN1b was reported as an epididymis-specific beta-defensin antimicrobial peptide. In this paper, the recombinant BIN1b was expressed and purified by fusing with GB1-His tag. The size-exclusion gel filtration experiment indicated that the fusion protein GB1-BIN1b formed multimers at pH 7.4, and existed as monomer at pH 4.5. The oligomerization of GB1-BIN1b was only related to pH value, neither to NaCl concentration nor protein concentration. Far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra also showed the fusion protein had more ordered secondary structures at pH 4.5 than at pH 7.4, as a negative peak appeared around 218 nm indicative of typical beta-sheet. The 2D (15)N-(1)H heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra suggested that the fusion protein adopted a compact three-dimensional structure at pH 4.5. Colony forming unit (CFU) inhibition assay demonstrated that 25 microM fusion protein at pH 7.4 had an antimicrobial activity of 40% against E. coli K(12)D(31), which might imply the fusion protein functions as multimeric states. In conclusion, the GB1 fusion partner helps BIN1b form a stable homogenous conformation to facilitate subsequent structural determination without a significant effect on the antimicrobial activity.
The sperm from the testis acquires complete fertilizing ability and forward progressive motility following its transit through the epididymis. Acquisition of these characteristics results from the modification of the sperm proteome following interactions with epididymal secretions. In our attempts to identify epididymis-specific sperm plasma membrane proteins, a partial 2.83-kb clone was identified by immunoscreening a monkey epididymal cDNA library with an agglutinating monoclonal antibody raised against washed human spermatozoa. The sequence of the 2.83-kb clone exhibited homology to the region between 1 and 1097 bp of the homeobox gene, Hoxb2. This sequence was found to be species conserved, as revealed by RT-PCR analysis. To obtain a full-length clone of the sequence, 5' RACE-PCR (rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR) was carried out using rat epididymal RNA as the template. It resulted in a full-length 1.657-kb cDNA encoding a 32.9-kDa putative protein. The protein designated HOXBES2 exhibited homology to the conserved 61-amino acid homeodomain region of the HOXB2 homeoprotein. However, characteristic differences were noted in its amino and carboxyl termini compared with HOXB2. A putative 30-kDa protein was detected in the tissue extracts from adult rat epididymis and caudal spermatozoa, and a 37-kDa protein was detected in the rat embryo when probed with a polyclonal antibody against HOXB2 protein. Multiple tissue Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis further indicated its expression in the cytoplasm of the principal and basal epithelial cells, with maximal expression in the distal epididymal segments. Northern blot analysis detected a single approximately 2.5-kb transcript from the adult epididymis. Indirect immunofluorescence localized the protein to the acrosome, midpiece, and equatorial segments of rat caudal and ejaculated human and monkey spermatozoa, respectively. In conclusion, we have identified and characterized a novel epididymal homeoprotein different from HOXB2 protein and hereafter referred to as HOXBES2, (HOXB2 homeodomain containing epididymis-specific sperm protein) with a probable role in fertilization.
The importance of early diagnosis to reduce the morbidity and mortality from cancer has led to a search for new sensitive and specific tumour markers. Molecular techniques developed over the past few years allow simultaneous screening of thousands of genes, and have been applied to different cancers to identify many genes that are modulated in various cancers. Of these, attention has focused on genes coding for a family of proteins with whey-acidic-protein (WAP) motifs. Most notably, the genes coding for elafin, antileukoproteinase 1 (previously called secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor, SLPI), WAP four disulphide core domain protein 1 (previously called prostate stromal protein 20 kDa, PS20), and WAP four disulphide core domain protein 2 (previously called major human epididymis-specific protein E4, HE4), have been identified as candidate molecular markers for several cancers. In this review, we assess data for an association between cancer and human WAP proteins, and discuss their potential role in tumour progression. We also propose a new mechanism by which WAP proteins might have a role in carcinogenesis.
To provide materials for the study of the function of ESC42 protein specifically expressed in the human epididymis.
The ESC42 gene was amplified from the human epididymis cDNA library by PCR and then cloned into prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-4T-1, expressed and purified by recombinant DNA techniques. The specificity of ESC42 protein was identified by Western blot and MALDI-TOF-MS. The database was searched by Ms-Fit.
The recombinant plasmid expressed a Mr 38 x 10(3) fusion protein in E. coli at a level of 30% of the total protein, and the purity was as high as 99%. The ESC42 protein was identified by ESC42 monoclonal antibody and its molecular weight was 11 978.12, tested by MALDI-TOF-MS. The peptide mass fingerprint analysis showed that the coverage rate of the sequence reached 48% with 100% matching. The motif scan in Prosite database reveal that ESC42 belonged to the beta-defensin family and had antibacterial activity.
Obtaining high purity of rhESC42 protein may lay a foundation for the study of its functions.
Human lipocalin 6 (hLCN6) is an epididymis-specific secretory protein. It binds to sperm and plays important role in sperm maturation. To explore the feasibility for isolating spermatozoa from mixed cells using anti-hLCN6 monoclonal antibody-conjugated immunomagnetic beads (anti-hLCN6 IMBs) and establish a new method for the separation of sperms from mixed stains, 2 sets of 30 cases of cell mixture suspensions and stains containing different proportions of sperm and epithelial cells were prepared. Biotin-labeled anti-hLCN6 monoclonal antibody (mAb) was incubated with the cell mixtures, and the spermatozoa were then isolated with avidin-coated IMBs. Sperm DNA was extracted and analyzed by PCR-STR typing. Differential lysis was also conducted to compare the effect of the two different isolation methods. The dissociation constant (Kd) of anti-hLCN6 mAb was 3.47×10⁻⁹ mol/L measured by ELISA. Western blotting and immunofluorescence assays showed that hLCN6 was detectable on sperm cells and mainly located on the post-acrosomal region of the sperm head, but not in epithelial cells. Anti-hLCN6 IMBs could capture and separate the sperm cells successfully. Microscopic observation showed that the IMBs could bind to the head of sperm specifically. The success rate of STR typing (more than 13 STR loci, RFU&gt;200) was 90% when the number of sperm cells was 10³/mL and 100% when the sperm cells number was equal to or more than 10⁴/mL. When the number of sperm cells was 10³/mL, 10⁴/mL and 10⁵/mL in mixed stain samples, the success rate of STR typing were 40%, 90% and 100%, respectively. Taken together, the anti-hLCN6 immunomagnetic beads (IMB) method described here could be effective for the isolation of sperm from mixed cells, and the success rate was higher than that of the traditional differential lysis strategy. IMB sorting is a simple and efficient method for the separation of sperms from sperm and epithelial cell mixture, and can be utilized as a supplementary method for forensic mixture samples analysis in sexual assault cases.
hLCN6 (Human lipocalin 6) 是附睾特异性分泌蛋白，它能与精子结合，对精子的成熟发挥着重要作用。为了探究应用抗hLCN6 单克隆抗体偶联免疫磁珠技术分离混合细胞中精子的可行性，建立混合斑中精子细胞分离的新方法，制备了不同比例的精子-上皮细胞混合悬液及混合斑样本，以生物素标记的hLCN6 单克隆抗体孵育样品，再用亲和素包被的免疫磁珠捕获分离精子细胞，提取精子DNA 进行PCR-STR (Short tandem repeat) 分型，同时以差异裂解法提取精子，比较两者的差异。经ELISA 检测，hLCN6 单克隆抗体与抗原的亲和力解离常数 (Kd)为3.47×10⁻⁹ mol/L。免疫印迹和免疫荧光结果显示，hLCN6 在精子中可检测到，主要定位于精子头部的顶体后区域，但不能在上皮细胞中检测到。hLCN6 抗体偶联的免疫磁珠复合物能够实现精子细胞的捕获和分离，显微镜观察显示免疫磁珠能够与精子头部特异性结合。对精子个数为10³/mL 的混合悬液，STR 分型成功率 (正确分型13 个以上，RFU&gt;200) 为90%。当精子数量≥10⁴/mL 时，分型成功率达100%；对精子数分别为10³/mL、10⁴/mL、10⁵/mL 的混合斑STR 分型成功率分别为40%、90%和100%。综上，hLCN6 抗体偶联免疫磁珠法可以有效分离混合细胞中的精子，分型成功率高于传统的差异裂解法。该方法简单高效，可作为性侵案件中法医混合斑检验的有效补充手段。.
Human epididymal secretory protein 4 (HE4) is originally described as an epididymis-specific protein but more recently suggested to be a putative serum tumor marker for some tumors, including breast carcinomas. In this study, we aimed to investigate the interactions between HE4 expression and molecular subtypes of breast carcinomas.
HE4 expressions were studied in 242 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast carcinoma specimens and their association with different pathological and clinical parameters was evaluated.
Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for HE4 was negative in 3 (1.2%) cases, weakly positive (1+) in 7 (2.9%) cases, moderately positive (2+) in 58 (24.0%) cases, and strongly positive (3+) in 174 (71.9%) cases. A correlation between IHC HE4 staining grade and molecular groups was detected (P = 0.005). Furthermore, it was found that HE4 expression was strongly associated with histological tumor grade, c-erbB2 expression, and positive fluorescence in situ hybridization test results that detect human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu amplification (P = 0.022, P = 0.014, and P = 0.011).
This study showed that HE4 expression is associated with HER2/neu amplification in breast cancers. These results may be commented as HE4 expression rises in patients with HER2/neu amplification. As is known, HER2/neu amplification is a poor diagnostic factor in breast cancer and HE4 expression is possibly associated with poor prognosis.
Deficiency in pleomorphic adenoma gene 1 (PLAG1) leads to reduced fertility in male mice, but the mechanism by which PLAG1 contributes to reproduction is unknown. To investigate the involvement of PLAG1 in testicular function, we determined (i) the spatial distribution of PLAG1 in the testis using X-gal staining; (ii) transcriptomic consequences of PLAG1 deficiency in knock-out and heterozygous mice compared to wild-type mice using RNA-seq; and (iii) morphological and functional consequences of PLAG1 deficiency by determining testicular histology, daily sperm production and sperm motility in knock-out and wild-type mice. PLAG1 was sparsely expressed in germ cells and in Sertoli cells. Genes known to be involved in spermatogenesis were downregulated in the testes of knock-out mice, as well as Hsd17b3, which encodes a key enzyme in androgen biosynthesis. In the absence of Plag1, a number of genes involved in immune processes and epididymis-specific genes were upregulated in the testes. Finally, loss of PLAG1 resulted in significantly lowered daily sperm production, in reduced sperm motility, and in several animals, in sloughing of the germinal epithelium. Our results demonstrate that the subfertility seen in male PLAG1-deficient mice is, at least in part, the result of significantly reduced sperm output and sperm motility.
TEX101 is a cell membrane protein exclusively expressed by testicular germ cells and shed into seminal plasma. We previously verified human TEX101 as a biomarker for the differential diagnosis of azoospermia, and developed a first-of-its-kind TEX101 ELISA. To demonstrate the clinical utility of TEX101, in this work we aimed at evaluating ELISA performance in a large population of fertile, subfertile, and infertile men.
Mass spectrometry, size-exclusion chromatography, ultracentrifugation, and immunohistochemistry were used to characterize TEX101 protein as an analyte in seminal plasma. Using the optimized protocol for seminal plasma pretreatment, TEX101 was measured by ELISA in 805 seminal plasma samples.
We demonstrated that TEX101 was present in seminal plasma mostly in a free soluble form and that its small fraction was associated with seminal microvesicles. TEX101 median values were estimated in healthy, fertile pre-vasectomy men (5436 ng/mL, N = 64) and in patients with unexplained infertility (4967 ng/mL, N = 277), oligospermia (450 ng/mL, N = 270), and azoospermia (0.5 ng/mL, N = 137). Fertile post-vasectomy men (N = 57) and patients with Sertoli cell-only syndrome (N = 13) and obstructive azoospermia (N = 36) had undetectable levels of TEX101 (≤0.5 ng/mL). A cut-off value of 0.9 ng/mL provided 100% sensitivity at 100% specificity for distinguishing pre- and post-vasectomy men. The combination of a concentration of TEX101 &gt; 0.9 ng/mL and epididymis-specific protein ECM1 &gt; 2.3 μg/mL provided 81% sensitivity at 100% specificity for differentiating between non-obstructive and obstructive azoospermia, thus eliminating the majority of diagnostic testicular biopsies. In addition, a cut-off value of ≥0.6 ng/mL provided 73% sensitivity at 64% specificity for predicting sperm or spermatid retrieval in patients with non-obstructive azoospermia.
We demonstrated the clinical utility of TEX101 ELISA as a test to evaluate vasectomy success, to stratify azoospermia forms, and to better select patients for sperm retrieval.
To evaluate the validity and compare the performance of cancer antigen-125 (CA-125), human epididymis protein 4 (HE4), the risk of malignancy index (RMI), and the risk of ovarian malignancy algorithm (ROMA) in the diagnosis of ovarian cancer in patients with ovarian lesions discovered during their preoperative work-up investigations.
This prospective, cross-sectional study looked at patients who attended the gynecology department at the Royal Hospital, Muscat, from 1 March 2014 to 30 April 2015, for the evaluation of an ovarian lesion. The inclusion criteria included women who underwent surgical intervention and who had a preoperative pelvic ultrasound with laboratory investigation for CA-125 and HE4. The study validated the diagnostic performance of CA-125, RMI, HE4, and ROMA using histopathological diagnosis as the gold standard.
The study population had a total of 213 cases of various types of benign (77%) and malignant (23%) ovarian tumors. CA-125 showed the highest sensitivity (79%) when looking at the total patient population. When divided by age, the sensitivity was 67% in premenopausal women. In postmenopausal women, CA-125 had lower sensitivity (89%) compared to RMI, HE4, and ROMA (93% each). A high specificity of 90% was found for HE4 in the total patient population, 93% in premenopausal women and 75% in postmenopausal women. CA-125 had the highest specificity (79%) in postmenopausal women. Both CA-125 and RMI were frequently elevated in benign gynecological conditions particularly in endometriosis when compared to HE4 and ROMA. We also studied modifications of the optimal cut-offs for the four parameters. Both CA-125 and RMI showed a significant increase in their specificity if the cut-off was increased to ≥ 60 U/mL for CA-125 and to ≥ 250 for RMI. For HE4, we noted an improvement in its specificity in postmenopausal women when its cut-off was increased to140 pmol/L.
HE4 and ROMA showed a very high specificity, but were less sensitive than CA-125 and RMI in premenopausal women. However, they were of comparable sensitivity in postmenopausal women and were valuable in distinguishing benign ovarian tumors or endometriosis from ovarian cancer. Modifying the cut-off values of the different markers resulted in a higher accuracy compared to the standard cut-offs, but at the expense of reduced sensitivity.
A novel electrochemical immunoassay system for the detection of human epididymis-specific protein 4 (HE4) was developed. A chitosan-titanium carbide (TiC) nanocomposition film was first electrodeposited onto a tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) electrode at a constant potential. Gold (Au) nanoparticles were then electrodeposited on the surface of the chitosan-TiC film by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The capture antibody (anti-HE4) was adsorbed onto the Au and TiC nanoparticles. After a specific sandwich immunoreaction among the capture antibody, HE4, and biotinylated secondary antibody, biotinylated primer DNA was immobilized on the secondary antibody by biotin-streptavidin system. Appropriate amounts of circular template DNA and biotinylated primer DNA were used for rolling circle amplification (RCA) under optimal conditions. The RCA products provided a large number of sites to link DNA detection probes. Doxorubicin hydrochloride intercalated the CG-GC steps between the RCA products and the DNA detection probes, which was monitored by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) based on the current signal of doxorubicin hydrochloride. With the above-mentioned amplification factors, the current responded to HE4 linearly in the concentration range of 3-300 pM under optimal detection conditions, with a detection limit of 0.06 pM. Stepwise changes in the microscopic features of the surfaces and electrochemical properties upon the formation of each layer were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). This system was successfully employed for the detection of HE4 with good accuracy and renewable ability.
Niemann-Pick diseases are hereditary neurovisceral lysosomal lipid storage disorders, of which the rare type C2 almost uniformly presents with respiratory distress in early infancy. In the patient presented here, the NPC2 exon 4 frameshift mutation c.408_409delAA caused reduced NPC2 protein levels in serum and lung lavage fluid and the synthesis of an aberrant, larger sized protein of around 28 kDa. Protein expression was strongly reduced also in alveolar macrophages. The infant developed failure to thrive and tachypnea. Lung lavage, computer tomography, and histology showed typical signs of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis with an abnormal intraalveolar accumulation of surfactant as well as macrophages. An NPC2-hypomorph animal model also showed pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and accumulation of macrophages in the lung, liver, and spleen long before the mice died. Due to the elevation of cholesterol, the surfactant had an abnormal composition and function. Despite the removal of large amounts of surfactant from the lungs by therapeutic lung lavages, this treatment was only temporarily successful and the infant died of respiratory failure. Our data indicate that respiratory distress in NPC2 disease is associated with a loss of normal NPC2 protein expression in alveolar macrophages and the accumulation of functionally inactive surfactant rich in cholesterol.
A handoff model has been proposed to explain the egress from lysosomes of cholesterol derived from receptor-mediated endocytosis of LDL. Cholesterol is first bound by soluble Niemann-Pick C2 (NPC2) protein, which hands off the cholesterol to the N-terminal domain of membrane-bound NPC1. Cells lacking NPC1 or NPC2 accumulate LDL-derived cholesterol in lysosomes and fail to deliver LDL cholesterol to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for esterification by acyl-CoA acyltransferase (ACAT) and for inhibition of sterol regulatory element-binding protein cleavage. Here, we support this model by showing that the cholesterol transport defect in NPC1 mutant cells is restricted to lysosomal export. Other cholesterol transport pathways appear normal, including the movement of cholesterol from the plasma membrane to the ER after treatment of cells with 25-hydroxycholesterol or sphingomyelinase. The NPC1 or NPC2 block in cholesterol delivery to the ER can be overcome by 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin, which leads to a marked increase in ACAT-mediated cholesterol esterification. The buildup of cholesteryl esters in the cytosol is expected to be much less toxic than the buildup of free cholesterol in the lysosomes of patients with mutations in NPC1 or NPC2.
The constitutive degradation of membrane components takes place in the acidic compartments of a cell, the endosomes and lysosomes. Sites of lipid degradation are intralysosomal membranes that are formed in endosomes, where the lipid composition is adjusted for degradation. Cholesterol is sorted out of the inner membranes, their content in bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate increases, and, most likely, sphingomyelin is degraded to ceramide. Together with endosomal and lysosomal lipid-binding proteins, the Niemann-Pick disease, type C2-protein, the GM2-activator, and the saposins sap-A, -B, -C, and -D, a suitable membrane lipid composition is required for degradation of complex lipids by hydrolytic enzymes.
Niemann-Pick disease type C1 (NPC1) and type C2 (NPC2) display the same pattern of neurovisceral storage due to deficiencies within lysosomes. NPC2 is a much rarer condition, and as reports on the pathological changes are scarce, the morphological findings in the lungs and brain in two siblings who died at an early age from pulmonary involvement are described. The diagnosis of NPC2 was confirmed at postmortem mutational analysis.
Both siblings presented with postnatal conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. They subsequently developed progressive respiratory insufficiency with opacification of the lungs on X-ray examination and died at the ages of 8 and 13 months. The lungs contained intra-alveolar accumulation of periodic acid-Schiff positive material, foamy macrophages, and hyperplasia of the alveolar cells, consistent with pulmonary alveolar lipoproteinosis. On neuropathological examination, storage material in swollen perikarya in the deep cerebellar nuclei, thalamus, medulla oblongata, and in the paravertebral ganglion cells was found. Meganeurites were present in the cerebral cortex. A few axonal spheroids were also observed. There seemed to be a reduced number of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum.
Evidence that NPC2 is associated with severe pulmonary alveolar lipoproteinosis is supported. There were extensive neuropathological changes with storage material in swollen perikarya and a few axonal spheroids.
NPC2 is a small lysosomal glycoprotein that binds cholesterol with submicromolar affinity. Deficiency in NPC2 is the cause of Niemann-Pick type C2 disease, a fatal neurovisceral disorder characterized by accumulation of cholesterol in lysosomes. Here we report the crystal structure of bovine NPC2 bound to cholesterol-3-O-sulfate, an analog that binds with greater apparent affinity than cholesterol. Structures of both apo-bound and sterol-bound NPC2 were observed within the same crystal lattice, with an asymmetric unit containing one molecule of apoNPC2 and two molecules of sterol-bound NPC2. As predicted from a previously determined structure of apoNPC2, the sterol binds in a deep hydrophobic pocket sandwiched between the two beta-sheets of NPC2, with only the sulfate substituent of the ligand exposed to solvent. In the two available structures of apoNPC2, the incipient ligand-binding pocket, which ranges from a loosely packed hydrophobic core to a small tunnel, is too small to accommodate cholesterol. In the presence of sterol, the pocket expands, facilitated by a slight separation of the beta-strands and substantial reorientation of some side chains, resulting in a perfect molding of the pocket around the hydrocarbon portion of cholesterol. A notable feature is the repositioning of two aromatic residues at the tunnel entrance that are essential for NPC2 function. The NPC2 structures provide evidence of a malleable binding site, consistent with the previously documented broad range of sterol ligand specificity.
Niemann-Pick type C disease is an inherited fatal disorder characterized by the accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and other lipids in the endosomal/lysosomal compartment. Two independent genes responsible for this neurodegenerative disorder have been identified, but the precise functions of the encoded Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) and C2 (NPC2) proteins are not yet known. We developed a cell-free assay for measuring intermembrane lipid transport and examined the ability of bovine NPC2 (bNPC2) for intermembrane cholesterol transfer. NPC2 specifically extracts cholesterol from phospholipid bilayers and catalyzes intermembrane transfer to acceptor vesicles in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This transfer activity is dependent on temperature, pH, ionic strength, lipid composition of the model membranes, and the ratio of donor to acceptor vesicles. In model membranes, the presence of the lysosomal anionic phospholipids bis(monooleoylglycero)phosphate and phosphatidyl inositol significantly stimulated cholesterol transfer by NPC2, whereas bis(monomyristoylglycero)phosphate, phosphatidyl serine, and phosphatidic acid had no effect. Moreover, ceramide stimulated cholesterol transfer slightly, whereas sphingomyelin reduced cholesterol transfer rates. With our assay system we identified for the first time the ability of other lysosomal proteins, most notably the GM2-activator protein, to mediate intermembrane cholesterol transfer. This assay system promises to be a valuable tool for further quantitative and mechanistic studies of protein-mediated lipid transfer.
Niemann-Pick type C2 (NPC2) protein has been characterized as a cholesterol-binding protein. Its loss leads to NPC2 disease, an inherited neurodegenerative disorder. When analyzing gene expression profile, we noticed high expression of both NPC2 and its receptor, mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR), in murine hematopoietic stem cells. NPC2 protein, in the presence of thrombopoietin (TPO), causes an increase in CFU-GEMM (colony-forming unit-granulocyte-erythroid-macrophage-megakaryocyte) and a decrease in CFU-GM (colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage) colony number in colony-forming cell (CFC) assays. This effect is independent of cholesterol binding but does require the presence of MPR. With M07e cells, a TPO-dependent hematopoietic leukemia cell line, NPC2 can inhibit TPO-induced differentiation and enhance TPO-mediated anti-apoptosis effects. Strikingly, these results are not observed under the standard 20% O(2) level of the standard incubator, but rather at 7% O(2), the physiological oxygen level of bone marrow. Furthermore, NPC2 protein upregulates hypoxia inducible factor 1-alpha protein level at 7% O(2), but not at 20% O(2). Our results demonstrate that NPC2 protein plays a role in hematopoiesis at the physiologic bone marrow level of O(2).
Niemann-Pick type C2 (NPC2) disease is a fatal autosomal recessive neurovisceral degenerative disorder characterized by late endosomal-lysosomal sequestration of low-density lipoprotein derived cholesterol. The breach in intracellular cholesterol homeostasis is caused by deficiency of functional NPC2, a soluble sterol binding protein targeted to the lysosomes by binding the mannose-6-phosphate receptor. As currently there is no effective treatment for the disorder, we have investigated the efficacy of NPC2 replacement therapy in a murine gene-trap model of NPC2-disease generated on the 129P2/OlaHsd genetic background. NPC2 was purified from bovine milk and its functional competence assured in NPC2-deficient fibroblasts using the specific cholesterol fluorescent probe filipin. For evaluation of phenotype correction in vivo, three-week-old NPC2(-/-) mice received two weekly intravenous injections of 5 mg/kg NPC2 until trial termination 66 days later. Whereas the saline treated NPC2(-/-) mice exhibited massive visceral cholesterol storage as compared to their wild-type littermates, administration of NPC2 caused a marked reduction in cholesterol build up. The histological findings, indicating an amelioration of the disease pathology in liver, spleen, and lungs, corroborated the biochemical results. Little or no difference in the overall cholesterol levels was observed in the kidneys, blood, cerebral cortex and hippocampus when comparing NPC2(-/-) and wild type mice. However, cerebellum cholesterol was increased about two fold in NPC2(-/-) mice compared with wild-type littermates. Weight gain performance was slightly improved as a result of the NPC2 treatment but significant motor coordination deficits were still observed. Accordingly, ultrastructural cerebellar abnormalities were detected in both saline treated and NPC2 treated NPC2(-/-) animals 87 days post partum. Our data indicate that protein replacement may be a beneficial therapeutic approach in the treatment of the visceral manifestations in NPC2 disease and further suggest that neurodegeneration is not secondary to visceral dysfunction.
Niemann-Pick Type C (NPC) disease is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and other lipids in the endolysosomal system. NPC disease results from a defect in either of two distinct cholesterol-binding proteins: a transmembrane protein, NPC1, and a small soluble protein, NPC2. NPC1 and NPC2 are thought to function closely in the export of lysosomal cholesterol with both proteins binding cholesterol in vitro but they may have unrelated lysosomal roles. To investigate this possibility, we compared biochemical consequences of the loss of either protein. Analyses of lysosome-enriched subcellular fractions from brain and liver revealed similar decreases in buoyant densities of lysosomes from NPC1 or NPC2 deficient mice compared to controls. The subcellular distribution of both proteins was similar and paralleled a lysosomal marker. In liver, absence of either NPC1 or NPC2 resulted in similar alterations in the carbohydrate processing of the lysosomal protease, tripeptidyl peptidase I. These results highlight biochemical alterations in the lysosomal system of the NPC-mutant mice that appear secondary to lipid storage. In addition, the similarity in biochemical phenotypes resulting from either NPC1 or NPC2 deficiency supports models in which the function of these two proteins within lysosomes are linked closely.
Anatomically, the human epididymis is unusual when compared with the  excurrent duct of other eutherian mammals. Furthermore, clinical observations  suggest that it may not be as important for sperm maturation as is the case  for laboratory animals. In contrast, hierarchical clustering of microarray  data of epididymides from normal men revealed 2274 modulated qualifiers  between the epididymal segments, 1184, 713, and 269 of them being highly  expressed in the caput, corpus, and cauda, respectively. The organization of  qualifiers according to their similarities by gene ontology indicated that  caput transcripts are dedicated to cell-cell adhesion, whereas the corpus is  characterized by genes involved in response to other organisms (ie, defense  mechanisms) and the cauda transcriptome is specialized in muscle contraction  and establishment of localization. A region-specific gene expression pattern  thus characterizes the human epididymis as in animal models. In humans,  vasectomies have consequences on the epididymal transcriptome. Cluster  analysis revealed that 1363 genes are expressed in both normal and  vasectomized epididymides, whereas 911 and 660 of them are specifically  expressed in normal and vasectomized epididymides, respectively. Three of the  affected genes are particularly interesting because of their involvement in  sperm biochemical remodeling during epididymal transit:  dicarbonyl/l-xylulose reductase, Niemann-Pick disease, type C2, and  cysteine-rich secretory protein 1. In some vasovasostomized men, these  modifications in gene expression induced by vasectomy are irreversible, thus  affecting the biochemical parameters, and potentially, the function of their  ejaculated sperm. This may explain the discrepancies between a surgically  successful vasovasostomy and fertility recovery.
A growing body of evidence points toward activated fibroblasts, also known as myofibroblasts, as one of the leading mediators in several major human pathologies including proliferative fibrotic disorders, invasive tumor growth, rheumatoid arthritis, and atherosclerosis. Niemann-Pick Type C2 (NPC2) protein has been recently identified as a product of the second gene in NPC disease. It encodes ubiquitous, highly conserved, secretory protein with the poorly defined function. Here we show that NPC2 deficiency in human fibroblasts confers their activation. The activation phenomenon was not limited to fibroblasts as it was also observed in aortic smooth muscle cells upon silencing NPC2 gene by siRNA. More importantly, activated synovial fibroblasts isolated from patients with rheumatoid arthritis were also identified as NPC2-deficient at both the NPC2 mRNA and protein levels. The molecular mechanism responsible for activation of NPC2-null cells was shown to be a sustained phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which fulfills both the sufficient and necessary fibroblast activation criteria. All of these findings highlight a novel mechanism where NPC2 by negatively regulating ERK 1/2 MAPK phosphorylation may efficiently suppress development of maladaptive tissue remodeling and inflammation.
The epididymis plays a major role in the acquisition of sperm fertility. In order to shed light on specific features of epididymal function in mammalian species, we characterized the luminal proteins (luminal proteome) and secreted proteins (secretome) in the bovine epididymis. We identified 172 different luminal proteins in 9 distinct epididymal regions. The concentration and secretory activity of luminal proteins were quantified throughout the epididymis. Among the most abundant secreted proteins, we found lipocalin 5, (LCN5), NADP(+)dependent prostaglandin dehydrogenase (PTGDS), Niemann-Pick disease type C2 protein (NPC2), glutathione peroxidase type 5 (GPX 5), clusterin (CLU), hexosaminidase B (HEXB) and galactosidase (GLB1), each of which is released in distinct epididymal regions. Gelsolin, (GSN) previously not described in mammalian epididymal fluid, appeared to be a major protein secreted exclusively in the distal region of the bovine epididymis, where fully mature spermatozoa are stored. Although the major epididymal proteins are conserved between mammalian species, this study highlights the specificity and mechanisms of protein processing of epididymal secretion in the bull. In addition, this study provides a major insight into the sequential changes occurring in the sperm environment while gaining fertilizing capacity and could provide new information for the future identification of potential fertility markers.
Niemann-Pick disease type C2 (NPC2) is caused by the inherited deficiency of a lysosomal cholesterol transport protein, NPC2 protein. Many cases of NPC2 present in early infancy with inflammatory lung disease, with subsequent severe neurological disease and death in early childhood. This disease is theoretically correctable by bone marrow transplantation (BMT), as the NPC2 protein is small and soluble and secreted and recaptured by the mannose-6-phosphate pathway. In this report we describe the first successful allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for this condition in a 16-month-old boy homozygous for the NPC2 p.E20X mutation, which has hitherto been reported to cause disease with a severe phenotype. During BMT there was an initial improvement of the established respiratory illness, with the immune suppression associated with transplant conditioning, but there was subsequent marked deterioration at the time of immune reconstitution and donor cell engraftment. This 'graft versus substrate' reaction was managed with intensive immune suppressant therapy, and it gradually resolved as the substrate was cleared by the engrafted donor macrophages. All immune suppression was withdrawn 18 months after transplantation, and his respiratory illness has resolved. He walked independently at 24 months and is continuing to reach development milestones after receiving his transplant. We conclude that the successful treatment of Niemann-Pick C2 therefore seems likely to be associated with a severe post-transplantation 'graft versus substrate' reaction that requires intense immune suppression before eventual resolution.
The rare neurodegenerative disease Niemann-Pick Type C (NPC) results from mutations in either NPC1 or NPC2, which are membrane-bound and soluble lysosomal proteins, respectively. Previous studies have shown that mutations in either protein result in biochemically indistinguishable phenotypes, most notably the hyper-accumulation of cholesterol and other cargo in lysosomes. We comparatively evaluated the kinetics of [(3)H]dextran release from lysosomes of wild type, NPC1, NPC2, and NPC1/NPC2 pseudo-double mutant cells and found significant differences between all cell types examined. Specifically, NPC1 or NPC2 mutant fibroblasts treated with NPC1 or NPC2 siRNA (to create NPC1/NPC2 pseudo-double mutants) secreted dextran less efficiently than did either NPC1 or NPC2 single mutant cell lines, suggesting that the two proteins may work independently of one another in the egress of membrane-impermeable lysosomal cargo. To investigate the basis for these differences, we examined the role of NPC1 and NPC2 in the retrograde fusion of lysosomes with late endosomes to create so-called hybrid organelles, which is believed to be the initial step in the egress of cargo from lysosomes. We show here that cells with mutated NPC1 have significantly reduced rates of late endosome/lysosome fusion relative to wild type cells, whereas cells with mutations in NPC2 have rates that are similar to those observed in wild type cells. Instead of being involved in hybrid organelle formation, we show that NPC2 is required for efficient membrane fission events from nascent hybrid organelles, which is thought to be required for the reformation of lysosomes and the release of lysosomal cargo-containing membrane vesicles. Collectively, these results suggest that NPC1 and NPC2 can function independently of one another in the egress of certain membrane-impermeable lysosomal cargo.
Microarray profiling is a powerful approach to establish gene expression patterns for different histopathological stages of a malignancy, and at the same time, to identify individual genes that may have important functions in the early and/or advanced stages of a neoplasm. To identify genes that hitherto have not been shown to be expressed or play a role in advanced-stage melanomas, we conducted microarray analyses with RNAs from primary melanoma and melanoma-positive lymph node specimens. Using RT-PCR, quantitative, real-time RT-PCR, and fluorochrome oligonucleotide-based optical imaging, we established the level and pattern of expression of five of the identified known genes [Suppression of Tumorigenicity 13 (ST13), Cystatin 8 (CST-8), Dyskeratosis Congentia 1 (DKC1), Neuroendocrine Secretory Protein 55 (NESP55), Niemann-Pick Disease, type C2 (NP-C2)], and a gene with unknown function (16.7 kD Hypothetical Protein) in benign and atypical nevocytic lesions, advanced-stage melanomas, and melanoma-positive lymph nodes.
Niemann-Pick disease type C2 (NP-C2) is a fatal hereditary disease characterized by accumulation of low-density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol in lysosomes. Here we report the 1.7-A resolution crystal structure of the cholesterol-binding protein deficient in this disease, NPC2, and the characterization of its ligand binding properties. Human NPC2 binds the cholesterol analog dehydroergosterol with submicromolar affinity at both acidic and neutral pH. NPC2 has an Ig-like fold stabilized by three disulfide bonds. The structure of the bovine protein reveals a loosely packed region penetrating from the surface into the hydrophobic core that forms adjacent small cavities with a total volume of approximately 160 A(3). We propose that this region represents the incipient cholesterol-binding site that dilates to accommodate an approximately 740-A(3) cholesterol molecule.
The neurodegenerative disease Niemann-Pick Type C2 (NPC2) results from mutations in the NPC2 (HE1) gene that cause abnormally high cholesterol accumulation in cells. We find that purified NPC2, a secreted soluble protein, binds cholesterol specifically with a much higher affinity (K(d) = 30-50 nM) than previously reported. Genetic and biochemical studies identified single amino acid changes that prevent both cholesterol binding and the restoration of normal cholesterol levels in mutant cells. The amino acids that affect cholesterol binding surround a hydrophobic pocket in the NPC2 protein structure, identifying a candidate sterol-binding location. On the basis of evolutionary analysis and mutagenesis, three other regions of the NPC2 protein emerged as important, including one required for efficient secretion.
To maintain proper cellular function, the amount and distribution of cholesterol residing within cellular membranes must be regulated. The principal disorder affecting transport of cholesterol through the late endosomal/lysosomal system and intracellular cholesterol homeostasis is Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease. The genes responsible for NPC disease have been identified, and the encoded Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) and Niemann-Pick C2 (HE1/NPC2) proteins are currently the subject of intense investigation. This review provides a detailed examination of NPC1 and HE1/NPC2 in regulating the transport of cholesterol through the late endosomal/lysosomal system to other cellular compartments responsible for maintaining intracellular cholesterol homeostasis, and how defective function of these proteins may be responsible for the pathophysiology associated with NPC disease.
Niemann-Pick type C2 disease (NP-C2) is a fatal hereditary disorder of unknown etiology characterized by defective egress of cholesterol from lysosomes. Here we show that the disease is caused by a deficiency in HE1, a ubiquitously expressed lysosomal protein identified previously as a cholesterol-binding protein. HE1 was undetectable in fibroblasts from NP-C2 patients but present in fibroblasts from unaffected controls and NP-C1 patients. Mutations in the HE1 gene, which maps to chromosome 14q24.3, were found in NP-C2 patients but not in controls. Treatment of NP-C2 fibroblasts with exogenous recombinant HE1 protein ameliorated lysosomal accumulation of low density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol.
Previous studies employing rabbit polyclonal anti-human liver ferritin have shown an absence of L ferritin immunoreactivity in liver and spleen tissue from patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C1 (NPC1). The great majority of NPC cases is caused by defects of the NPC1 gene, and a minority by those of another (NPC2). In this study using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies we show the deficiency of H and L ferritin isoforms in various NPC tissues, including fetal NPC1, not previously described. In particular, evidence is provided for deficiency in H and L ferritins in tissues, except lung, from a patient with Niemann-Pick disease type C2 (NPC2). The present findings indicate that H and L ferritins are deficient in both NPC types characterized by accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and additional metabolites in the endosomal/lysosomal system. We hypothesize that the lesions in NPC1 and NPC2 block the intracellular utilization not only of cholesterol, but also that of iron for the synthesis of cytosolic ferritin.
Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC), caused by mutations in the NPC1 gene or the NPC2 gene, is characterized by the accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and other lipids in endo/lysosomal compartments. NPC2 is a small, soluble, lysosomal protein that is targeted to this compartment via a mannose 6-phosphate-inhibitable pathway. To obtain insight into the roles of mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) in NPC2 targeting, we here examine the trafficking and function of NPC2 in fibroblast lines deficient in one or both of the two MPRs, MPR46 and MPR300. We demonstrate that either MPR alone is sufficient to transport NPC2 to the endo/lysosomal compartment, although MPR300 seems to be more efficient than MPR46. In the absence of both MPRs, NPC2 is secreted into the culture medium, and only a small amount of intracellular NPC2 can be detected, mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum. This leads to massive accumulation of unesterified cholesterol in the endo/lysosomal compartment of the MPR46/300-deficient fibroblasts, a phenotype similar to that of the NPC patient fibroblasts. In addition, we observed an upregulation of NPC1 protein and mRNA in the MPR-double-deficient cells. Taken together, our results suggest that the lysosomal targeting of NPC2 is strictly dependent on MPRs in fibroblasts.
Progressive lung infiltration is a major cause of death in Niemann-Pick disease type A and B (NPA, NPB) and in the recently defined type C2. In type C1 (NPC1), the main manifestations are neurological. We report a patient with a classic, neurological, late infantile form of NPC1 disease, carrying the mutation P474L and the variant I642M in the NPC1 gene, who suffered recurrent respiratory manifestations. Bronchoalveolar lavage of a lung segment due to deteriorating respiratory condition revealed many foamy macrophages and was followed by an improvement in symptoms. Pneumopathy may therefore be considered a feature of NPC1 disease for which a partial bronchoalveolar lavage could be a useful treatment.
We report the fifth case of neonatal form of type C2 (NP-C2) Niemann-Pick disease with early and fatal respiratory distress. Eleven families presenting such cases are known to date in the world. Since December 2000, isolation of the underlying gene HE1/NPC2 and its mutations has allowed major advances in diagnosis.
Elisa was born in May 2000. NP-C2 disease was associated with severe respiratory distress leading to death at the age of four months. On the next pregnancy in September 2000, prenatal diagnosis was performed by means of biological tests that required four weeks response time. In December 2000, isolation of the HE1/NPC2 gene located to 14q24.3 and of some of its mutations allowed to characterize the patient as being homozygote for the nonsense mutation E20X. On the the two next pregnancies, prenatal diagnosis was performed at 12 SA, in 48 hours, by the means of mutation analysis. The last fetus was heterozygote for the mutation E20X, allowing the birth at term of a healthy male newborn baby.
Niemann-Pick type C disease is a rare lysosomal lipid storage disease with severe prognosis. It is characterized by abnormalities of intracellular transport of endocytosed cholesterol. Diagnosis relies on biological tests that require cultured cells. Genetic heterogeneity defines two different genetic complementation groups C1 and C2. Severe and early respiratory distress is more likely to be associated with the rare type C2. Since December 2000, after identification of the disease-causing mutations in the proband, mutation analysis of gene HE1/NPC2 on direct chorionic villus samples allows early and fast (48 hours) prenatal diagnosis.
Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C) is an inherited disorder that is characterized biochemically by cellular cholesterol and glycolipid storage, and clinically by progressive neurodegeneration. Most cases of NP-C are caused by inactivating mutations of the npc1 gene, but about 5% are linked to npc2, which encodes a soluble cholesterol binding protein, previously identified as epididymal secretory glycoprotein 1 (HE1). The present study was carried out to investigate the immunocytochemical localization of HE1/NPC2 protein in the mouse brain. Using an antibody against recombinant HE1/NPC2, we found HE1/NPC2 to be localized predominantly in neurons in the brain. Immunoreactivity for HE1/NPC2 was observed in pyramidal or projection neurons in the cerebral cortex and amygdala, and Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum. Neurons in the thalamus, hypothalamus, and globus pallidus were lightly labeled, or unlabeled. This regional pattern of expression of HE1/NPC2 is similar to our previous findings with NPC1, with a low level of expression of both NPC1 and HE1/NPC2 proteins in regions derived from the diencephalon, such as the thalamus and hypothalamus. In contrast to NPC1, however, which is predominantly in astrocytes, HE1/NPC2 was observed mainly in neurons. Electron microscopic immunocytochemistry showed that HE1/NPC2 is present in the cytosol of dendrites and on post-synaptic densities (PSD). The occurrence of HE1/NPC2 in the PSD was confirmed by Western blots of PSD-enriched brain subcellular fractions that showed the presence of HE1/NPC2 together with the PSD-associated protein, PSD-95. These results suggest that NPC1 and HE1/NPC2 are differentially enriched in astrocytes and neurons, respectively, and that HE1/NPC2 may function in supporting the integrity of the PSD of neurons.
The receptor complex resulting from association of MD-2 and the ectodomain of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) mediates lipopolysaccharide (LPS) signal transduction across the cell membrane. We prepared a tertiary structure model of MD-2, based on the known structures of homologous lipid-binding proteins. Analysis of circular dichroic spectra of purified bacterially expressed MD-2 indicates high content of beta-type secondary structure, in agreement with the structural model. Bacterially expressed MD-2 was able to confer LPS responsiveness to cells expressing TLR4 despite lacking glycosylation. We identified several clusters of basic residues on the surface of MD-2. Mutation of each of two clusters encompassing the residues Lys(89)-Arg(90)-Lys(91) and Lys(125)-Lys(125) significantly decreased the signal transduction of the respective MD-2 mutants either upon co-expression with TLR4 or upon addition as soluble protein into the supernatant of cells overexpressing TLR4. These basic clusters lie at the edge of the beta-sheet sandwich, which in cholesterol-binding protein connected to Niemann-Pick disease C2 (NPC2), dust mite allergen Der p2, and ganglioside GM2-activator protein form a hydrophobic pocket. In contrast, mutation of another basic cluster composed of Arg(69)-Lys(72), which according to the model lies further apart from the hydrophobic pocket only weakly decreased MD-2 activity. Furthermore, addition of the peptide, comprising the surface loop between Cys(95) and Cys(105), predicted by model, particularly in oxidized form, decreased LPS-induced production of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-8 upon application to monocytic cells and fibroblasts, respectively, supporting its involvement in LPS signaling. Our structural model of MD-2 is corroborated by biochemical analysis and contributes to the unraveling of molecular interactions in LPS recognition.
Dehydrodolichyl diphosphate (DedolPP) synthase catalyzes the sequential condensation of isopentenyl diphosphate with farnesyl diphosphate to synthesize DedolPP, a biosynthetic precursor for dolichol which plays an important role as a sugar-carrier lipid in the biosynthesis of glycoprotein in eukaryotic cells. During certain pathological processes like Alzheimer's disease or some neurological disorders, dolichol has been shown to accumulate in human brain. In order to understand the regulatory mechanism of dolichol in eukaryotes, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using full length human DedolPP synthase gene [Endo et al. BBA 1625 (2003) 291] as a bait to find some proteins specifically interacting with the enzyme. We identified Niemann-Pick Type C2 protein (NPC2) to show a specific interaction with human DedolPP synthase. This interaction was further confirmed by in vitro co-immunoprecipitation experiment, indicating the possible physiological interaction between NPC2 and DedolPP synthase proteins in human.
Lipid movement between organelles is a critical component of eukaryotic membrane homeostasis. Niemann Pick type C (NP-C) disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder typified by lysosomal accumulation of cholesterol and sphingolipids. Expression of yeast NP-C-related gene 1 (NCR1), the orthologue of the human NP-C gene 1 (NPC1) defective in the disease, in Chinese hamster ovary NPC1 mutant cells suppressed lipid accumulation. Deletion of NCR1, encoding a transmembrane glycoprotein predominantly residing in the vacuole of normal yeast, gave no phenotype. However, a dominant mutation in the putative sterol-sensing domain of Ncr1p conferred temperature and polyene antibiotic sensitivity without changes in sterol metabolism. Instead, the mutant cells were resistant to inhibitors of sphingolipid biosynthesis and super sensitive to sphingosine and C2-ceramide. Moreover, plasma membrane sphingolipids accumulated and redistributed to the vacuole and other subcellular membranes of the mutant cells. We propose that the primordial function of these proteins is to recycle sphingolipids and that defects in this process in higher eukaryotes secondarily result in cholesterol accumulation.
Niemann-Pick C2 (NPC2) is a lysosomal protein involved in the egress of low-density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol from lysosomes to other intracellular compartments. NPC2 has been detected in several tissues and is also secreted from the liver into bile. We have previously shown that NPC2-deficient mice fed a lithogenic diet showed reduced biliary cholesterol secretion as well as cholesterol crystal and gallstone formation. This study aimed to investigate the consequences of NPC2 hepatic overexpression on liver cholesterol metabolism, biliary lipid secretion, gallstone formation and the effect of NPC2 on cholesterol crystallization in model bile.
We generated NPC2 transgenic mice (Npc2.Tg) and fed them either chow or lithogenic diets. We studied liver cholesterol metabolism, biliary lipid secretion, bile acid composition and gallstone formation. We performed cholesterol crystallization studies in model bile using a recombinant NPC2 protein.
No differences were observed in biliary cholesterol content or secretion between wild-type and Npc2.Tg mice fed the chow or lithogenic diets. Interestingly, Npc2.Tg mice showed an increased susceptibility to the lithogenic diet, developing more cholesterol gallstones at early times, but did not show differences in the bile acid hydrophobicity and gallbladder cholesterol saturation indices compared to wild-type mice. Finally, recombinant NPC2 decreased nucleation time in model bile.
These results suggest that NPC2 promotes cholesterol gallstone formation by decreasing the cholesterol nucleation time, indicating a pro-nucleating function of NPC2 in bile.
The cholesterol storage disorder Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is caused by defects in either of two late endosomal/lysosomal proteins, NPC1 and NPC2. NPC2 is a 16-kDa soluble protein that binds cholesterol in a 1:1 stoichiometry and can transfer cholesterol between membranes by a mechanism that involves protein-membrane interactions. To examine the structural basis of NPC2 function in cholesterol trafficking, a series of point mutations were generated across the surface of the protein. Several NPC2 mutants exhibited deficient sterol transport properties in a set of fluorescence-based assays. Notably, these mutants were also unable to promote egress of accumulated intracellular cholesterol from npc2(-/-) fibroblasts. The mutations mapped to several regions on the protein surface, suggesting that NPC2 can bind to more than one membrane simultaneously. Indeed, we have previously demonstrated that WT NPC2 promotes vesicle-vesicle interactions. These interactions were abrogated, however, by mutations causing defective sterol transfer properties. Molecular modeling shows that NPC2 is highly plastic, with several intense positively charged regions across the surface that could interact favorably with negatively charged membrane phospholipids. The point mutations generated in this study caused changes in NPC2 surface charge distribution with minimal conformational changes. The plasticity, coupled with membrane flexibility, probably allows for multiple cholesterol transfer routes. Thus, we hypothesize that, in part, NPC2 rapidly traffics cholesterol between closely appositioned membranes within the multilamellar interior of late endosomal/lysosomal proteins, ultimately effecting cholesterol egress from this compartment.
Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a fatal autosomal recessive lipid storage disease associated with impaired trafficking of unesterified cholesterol and glycolipids in lysosomes and late endosomes. This disease is commonly characterized by hepatosplenomegaly and severe progressive neurological dysfunction. There are two defective genes that cause this illness. One of these genes is NPC1 gene which is the cause of illness in 95% of the patients. The other gene is the rare type NPC2 which is the cause of illness in 5% of the patients. Patients with NPC2 usually present with respiratory distress in early infancy, which is rather unusual with NPC1. This article discusses about a patient who died at an early age from pulmonary involvement and who subsequently was found to have a novel homozygous mutation of NPC2 gene. 
Some peptides that are highly conserved between insects and mammals have anti-tumor action. Screening for inhibitors of cell growth from animal fluids may provide useful clues to anti-tumor drugs. Inducers of autophagy also have anti-tumor activity. The current authors recently studied a protein found in silkworm hemolymph, Niemann-Pick disease type C2 (NPC2). This protein, which is highly conserved among eukaryotes, was found to have anti-proliferative action on a silkworm cell line. The current study found that the silkworm NPC2 protein also inhibits the growth of FM3A murine breast cancer cells. In FM3A cells, silkworm NPC2 increased phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase and decreased phosphorylation of Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin, which are regulators of autophagy. This study also found that NPC2 increased the amount of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3)-II, an autophagosome marker, in FM3A cells. Silkworm NPC2 also induced an increase in the number of LC3-dots, a marker of pre-autophagic endosomes, in FM3A cells. When silkworm NPC2 was used to inhibit FM3A cell growth, that inhibition was attenuated by chloroquine, which inhibits autophagic activity by preventing lysosomal acidification. Murine NPC2 also inhibited growth and induced autophagy in FM3A cells. These findings suggest that NPC2 is involved in the induction and/or maintenance of autophagy and may help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying other neurodegenerative disorders such as Niemann-Pick disease.
Primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common malignancy worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer-related death. It is important to identify new targets for early diagnosis and treatment of HCC. Niemann-Pick type C2 (NPC2) plays an important role in the regulation of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis via direct binding with free cholesterol. However, little is known about the significance of NPC2 in HCC tumorigenesis. In this study, we showed that NPC2 is abundantly expressed in normal liver, but is downregulated in human HCC tissues. The patients with NPC2 downregulation expressed much higher α-fetoprotein, multiple tumor type, vascular invasion, later pathological stage and shorter survival rate. Knockdown NPC2 in liver cancer cell lines promote cell proliferation, migration and xenograft tumorigenesis. In contrast, NPC2 overexpression inhibits HuH7 promoted tumor growth. Furthermore, administration of hepatotropic adeno-associated virus 8 (AAV8) delivered NPC2 decreased the inflammatory infiltration, the expression of two early HCC markers-glypican 3 and survivin and suppressed the spontaneous HCC development in mice. To identify the NPC2-dependent mechanism, we emphasized on the status of MAPK/ERK signaling. MEK1/2 inhibitor treatment demonstrated that the expression of NPC2 affected the activation of ERK1/2 but not MEK1/2. In addition, cholesterol trafficking inhibitor treatment did not alter the cell proliferation and the activation of MEK/ERK. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that NPC2 may play an important role in negatively regulate cell proliferation and ERK1/2 activation that were independent of cholesterol accumulation. AAV-NPC2 may thus represent a new treatment strategy for liver cancer. 
The cholesterol content of the sperm membrane is regulated during both maturation in the epididymis and capacitation in the female tract, two processes required for the spermatozoa to acquire their fertilising ability. Because Niemann-Pick disease, type C2 (NPC2) protein is one of the most abundant components of the epididymal fluid and contains a functional cholesterol-binding site that can transfer cholesterol between membranes, it has been suggested for years that NPC2 could be involved in the regulation of cholesterol levels in spermatozoa during epididymal maturation. In the present study, western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses demonstrated significant levels of NPC2 in the mouse epididymal epithelium. Epididymal spermatozoa obtained from NPC2(-/-) mice were morphologically normal and had normal motility parameters, but had a reduced cholesterol content compared with that of wild-type (WT) spermatozoa, as determined by both biochemical and by flow cytometry analyses. These results suggest that NPC2 could be involved in regulating cholesterol levels in spermatozoa during epididymal maturation. To understand the relevance of epididymal NPC2 for sperm function, the ability of spermatozoa to undergo events influenced by epididymal maturation, such as capacitation and fertilisation, were compared between WT and NPC2(-/-) mice. Capacitated NPC2(-/-) spermatozoa exhibited defective tyrosine phosphorylation patterns and a reduced ability to fertilise cumulus-oocyte complexes compared with WT spermatozoa, supporting the relevance of mouse epididymal NPC2 for male fertility. 
Silkworm haemolymph induced both the cessation of growth and an increase in triglyceride (triacylglycerol) storage in BmN4 cells. We purified the growth inhibitory factor from the silkworm haemolymph and identified this protein as the Bombyx mori PP (promoting protein), an orthologue of NPC2 (Niemann-Pick disease type C2) protein. Recombinant silkworm NPC2 inhibited cellular proliferation and increased triglyceride accumulation in BmN4 cells. Injection of either the recombinant protein or antiserum of NPC2 into living silkworms increased or decreased respectively triglyceride levels in the fat body. A mutation that depletes the cholesterol-binding capacity did not abolish the activity of NPC2. We further revealed that NPC2 induced the phosphorylation of AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) and that an AMPK inhibitor suppressed NPC2-dependent triglyceride accumulation. These findings suggest that NPC2 induces triglyceride accumulation via the activation of AMPK independently of its cholesterol-binding capacity in the silkworm.
Niemann-Pick Type C (NPC) disease is caused by a deficiency of either NPC1 or NPC2. Loss of function of either protein results in the progressive accumulation of unesterified cholesterol in every tissue leading to cell death and organ damage. Most literature on NPC disease focuses on neurological and liver manifestations. Pulmonary dysfunction is less well described. The present studies investigated how Npc1 deficiency impacts the absolute weight, lipid composition and histology of the lungs of Npc1(-/-) mice (Npc1(nih)) at different stages of the disease, and also quantitated changes in the rates of cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis in the lung over this same time span (8 to 70days of age). Similar measurements were made in Npc2(-/-) mice at 70days. All mice were of the BALB/c strain and were fed a basal rodent chow diet. Well before weaning, the lung weight, cholesterol and phospholipid (PL) content, and cholesterol synthesis rate were all elevated in the Npc1(-/-) mice and remained so at 70days of age. In contrast, lung triacylglycerol content was reduced while there was no change in lung fatty acid synthesis. Despite the elevated PL content, the composition of PL in the lungs of the Npc1(-/-) mice was unchanged. H&amp;E staining revealed an age-related increase in the presence of lipid-laden macrophages in the alveoli of the lungs of the Npc1(-/-) mice starting as early as 28days. Similar metabolic and histologic changes were evident in the lungs of the Npc2(-/-) mice. Together these findings demonstrate an intrinsic lung pathology in NPC disease that is of early onset and worsens over time. 
Niemann-Pick C (NPC) disease is due to loss of NPC1 or NPC2 protein function that is required for unesterified cholesterol transport from the endosomal/lysosomal compartment. Though lung involvement is a recognized characteristic of Niemann-Pick type C disease, the pathological features are not well understood. We investigated components of the surfactant system in both NPC1 mutant mice and felines and in NPC2 mutant mice near the end of their expected life span. Histological analysis of the NPC mutant mice demonstrated thickened septae and foamy macrophages/leukocytes. At the level of electron microscopy, NPC1-mutant type II cells had uncharacteristically larger lamellar bodies (LB, mean area 2-fold larger), while NPC2-mutant cells had predominantly smaller lamellar bodies (mean area 50% of normal) than wild type. Bronchoalveolar lavage from NPC1 and NPC2 mutant mice had an approx. 4-fold and 2.5-fold enrichment in phospholipid, respectively, and an approx. 9-fold and 35-fold enrichment in cholesterol, consistent with alveolar lipidosis. Phospholipid and cholesterol also were elevated in type II cell LBs and lung tissue while phospholipid degradation was reduced. Enrichment of surfactant protein-A in the lung and surfactant of the mutant mice was found. Immunocytochemical results showed that cholesterol accumulated in the LBs of the type II cells isolated from the affected mice. Alveolar macrophages from the NPC1 and NPC2 mutant mice were enlarged compared to those from wild type mice and were enriched in phospholipid and cholesterol. Pulmonary features of NPC1 mutant felines reflected the disease described in NPC1 mutant mice. Thus, with the exception of lamellar body size, the lung phenotype seen in the NPC1 and NPC2 mutant mice were similar. The lack of NPC1 and NPC2 proteins resulted in a disruption of the type II cell surfactant system contributing to pulmonary abnormalities. 
Colorectal cancer is still a major health burden worldwide, and its diagnosis has not improved in recent years due to a lack of appropriate diagnostic serum markers. Aiming to find new diagnostic proteins, we applied the proteomic DIGE technology to analyze changes in the secretome before/after differentiation of the colon adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cell line, an accepted in vitro model to study colorectal tumorigenesis. When the secretomes from undifferentiated (tumor-like) and differentiated cells (resembling healthy enterocytes) were compared, we found 96 spots differentially expressed. After MS/MS analysis, 22 spots corresponding to 15 different proteins were identified. Principal component analysis demonstrated these 22 spots could serve as a discriminatory panel between the tumor-like and normal-like cells. Among the identified proteins, the translationally-controlled tumor protein (TCTP), the transforming growth factor-beta-induced protein ig-h3 (TGFβIp), and the Niemann-Pick disease type C2 protein (NPC2) are interesting candidates for future studies focused on their utility as serum biomarkers of colorectal cancer.
ML (MD-2 (myeloid differentiation factor-2)-related Lipid-recognition) is a conserved domain identified in MD-2, MD-1, NPC2 (Niemann-Pick disease type C2), and mite major allergen protein from animals, plants, and fungi. Vertebrate members of the ML family proteins, such as NPC2 and MD-2, play important roles in lipid metabolism and immune signaling pathway. MD-2 is an essential co-receptor in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway. Insects contain multiple ML genes, arbitrarily named md-2- or npc2-like genes. However, whether insect ML genes have functions similar to vertebrate md-2 is unknown. In Drosophila melanogaster, there are eight npc2 genes (npc2a-h), and they can be further divided into three subgroups based on the numbers of cysteine residues (6, 7 and 8 Cys) in the mature proteins. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether any Drosophila npc2 genes may have functions in immune signaling pathways. We chose npc2a, npc2e and npc2h genes representing the three subgroups for this study. We showed that recombinant NPC2a, NPC2e and NPC2h not only bound to LPS and lipid A, but also bound to peptidoglycan (PG) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a property that has not been reported previously for vertebrate NPC2 or MD-2. More importantly, we showed that over-expression of NPC2a and NPC2e activated diptericin promoter reporter in S2 cells stimulated by PG, suggesting that NPC2e and NPC2a may play a role in the immune deficiency (Imd) pathway. This is the first in vitro study about NPC2 proteins in innate immunity of D. melanogaster.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with the development of metabolic syndromes and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Cholesterol accumulation is related to NAFLD, whereas its detailed mechanism is not fully understood. Previously, we reported that glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) knockout (Gnmt(-/-)) mice develop chronic hepatitis and HCC. In this study, we showed that Gnmt(-/-) mice had hyperlipidemia and steatohepatitis. Single photon emission computed tomography images of mice injected with (131)I-labeled 6β-iodocholesterol demonstrated that Gnmt(-/-) mice had slower hepatic cholesterol uptake and excretion rates than wild-type mice. In addition, genes related to cholesterol uptake (scavenger receptor class B type 1 [SR-B1] and ATP-binding cassette A1 [ABCA1]), intracellular trafficking (Niemann-Pick type C1 protein [NPC1] and Niemann-Pick type C2 protein [NPC2]) and excretion (ATP-binding cassette G1 [ABCG1]) were downregulated in Gnmt(-/-) mice. Yeast two-hybrid screenings and coimmunoprecipitation assays elucidated that the C conserved region (81-105 amino acids) of NPC2 interacts with the carboxyl-terminal fragment (171-295 amino acids) of GNMT. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that when cells were treated with low-density lipoprotein, NPC2 was released from lysosomes and interacts with GNMT in the cytosol. Overexpression of GNMT doubled the half-lives of both NPC2 isoforms and reduced cholesterol accumulation in cells. Furthermore, GNMT was downregulated in the liver tissues from patients suffering with NAFLD as well as from mice fed a high-fat diet, high-cholesterol diet or methionine/choline-deficient diet. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that GNMT regulates the homeostasis of cholesterol metabolism, and hepatic cholesterol accumulation may result from downregulation of GNMT and instability of its interactive protein NPC2. Novel therapeutics for steatohepatitis and HCC may be developed by using this concept.
Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is caused by mutations leading to loss of function of NPC1 or NPC2 proteins, resulting in accumulation of unesterified cholesterol in late endosomes and lysosomes. We previously reported that expression of the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is impaired in human NPC1(-/-) fibroblasts, resulting in reduced HDL particle formation and providing a mechanism for the reduced plasma HDL cholesterol seen in the majority of NPC1 patients. We also found that treatment of NPC1(-/-) fibroblasts with an agonist of liver X-receptor corrects ABCA1 expression and HDL formation and reduces lysosomal cholesterol accumulation. We have confirmed that ABCA1 expression is also reduced in NPC2(-/-) cells, and found that α-HDL particle formation is impaired in these cells. To determine whether selective up-regulation of ABCA1 can correct lysosomal cholesterol accumulation in NPC disease cells and HDL particle formation, we produced and infected NPC1(-/-) and NPC2(-/-) fibroblasts with an adenovirus expressing full-length ABCA1 and enhanced green fluorescent protein (AdABCA1-EGFP). ABCA1-EGFP expression in NPC1(-/-) fibroblasts resulted in normalization of cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and α-HDL particle formation, plus a marked reduction in filipin staining of unesterified cholesterol in late endosomes/lysosomes. In contrast, AdABCA1-EGFP treatment of NPC2(-/-) fibroblasts to normalize ABCA1 expression had no effect on cholesterol efflux to apoA-I or accumulation of excess cholesterol in lysosomes, and only partially corrected α-HDL formation by these cells. These results suggest that correction of ABCA1 expression can bypass the mutation of NPC1 but not NPC2 to mobilize excess cholesterol from late endosomes and lysosomes in NPC disease cells. Expression of ABCA1-EGFP in NPC1(-/-) cells increased cholesterol available for esterification and reduced levels of HMG-CoA reductase protein, effects that were abrogated by co-incubation with apoA-I. A model can be generated in which ABCA1 is able to mobilize cholesterol, to join the intracellular regulatory pool or to be effluxed for HDL particle formation, either directly or indirectly from the lysosomal membrane, but not from the lysosomal lumen. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Advances in High Density Lipoprotein Formation and Metabolism: A Tribute to John F. Oram (1945-2010).
Early onset Niemann-Pick C diseases are extremely rare, especially Niemann-Pick C2. Perhaps unusually for autosomal recessive diseases, heterozygotes for mutations in NPC1 manifest many biological variations. NPC2 deficiency has large effects on fertility. These features of NPC1 and NPC2 are reviewed in regard to possible negative selection for heterozygotes carrying null and hypomorphic alleles.
Niemann-Pick type C2 (NPC2) disease is a rare, neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the NPC2 gene, leading to lysosomal accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and other lipids. It is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, liver dysfunction and severe neurological manifestations, resulting in early death. There is no effective therapy for NPC2 disease. Here, we evaluated the effectiveness of an adeno-associated virus (AAV), serotype rh.10 gene transfer vector expressing the mouse Npc2 gene (AAVrh.10-mNpc2-HA, HA tagged to facilitate analysis) to treat the disease in an Npc2-/- mouse model. A single intracisternal administration of the AAVrh.10-mNpc2-HA to 6 week old Npc2-/- mice mediated vector DNA, transgene mRNA and protein expression in brain and other organs. Compared to untreated Npc2-/- mice, AAV-treated Npc2-/- mice demonstrated amelioration of disease pathology in the brain, reduced lysosomal storage, reduced Purkinje cell death, decreased gliosis, and improved performance in behavioral tasks. Treatment-related reduction in serum disease markers was detected early and this effect persisted. Liver and spleen pathology were improved with significant reduction of liver cholesterol and sphingomyelin levels in treated Npc2-/- mice. Finally, administration of AAVrh.10-mNpc2-HA significantly extended life-span. Taken together, these data demonstrate the benefit of a one-time intracisternal administration of AAVrh.10-mNpc2-HA as a life-long treatment for NPC2 disease.
Niemann-Pick disease type C2 is a lipid storage disorder in which mutations in the NPC2 protein cause accumulation of lipoprotein-derived cholesterol in late endosomes and lysosomes (LE/LYSs). Whether cholesterol delivered by other means to NPC2 deficient cells also accumulates in LE/LYSs is currently unknown. We show that the close cholesterol analog dehydroergosterol (DHE), when delivered to the plasma membrane (PM) accumulates in LE/LYSs of human fibroblasts lacking functional NPC2. We measured two different time scales of sterol diffusion; while DHE rich LE/LYSs moved by slow anomalous diffusion in disease cells (D ∼ 4.6∙10-4 μm2/sec; α∼0.76), a small pool of sterol could exchange rapidly with D ∼ 3 μm2/s between LE/LYSs, as shown by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). By quantitative lipid mass spectrometry we found that esterification of 13C-labeled cholesterol but not of DHE is reduced 10-fold in disease fibroblasts compared to control cells. Internalized NPC2 rescued the sterol storage phenotype and strongly expanded the dynamic sterol pool seen in FRAP experiments. Together, our study shows that cholesterol esterification and trafficking of sterols between the PM and LE/LYSs depends on a functional NPC2 protein. NPC2 likely acts inside LE/LYSs from where it increases non-vesicular sterol exchange with other organelles.
Hepatic cholesterol deposition drives inflammation and fibrosis in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The Niemann-Pick type C2 (NPC2) protein plays an important role in regulating intracellular cholesterol trafficking and homeostasis. We hypothesized that intravenous NPC2 supplementation reduces cholesterol accumulation, hepatic inflammation and fibrogenesis in a nutritional NASH rat model.
Rats were fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol (HFHC) diet for four weeks resulting in moderately severe NASH. Animals were treated with intravenous NPC2 or placebo twice weekly for either the last two weeks or the entire four weeks. End-points were liver/body- and spleen/body weight ratios, histopathological NASH scores, fibrosis, serum liver enzymes, cholesterol, lipoproteins, cytokines, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction derived hepatic gene expression related to cholesterol metabolism, inflammation, and fibrosis.
HFHC rats developed hepatomegaly, non-fibrotic NASH histopathology, elevated liver enzymes, serum cholesterol, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Their sterol regulatory element binding factor 2 (SREBF2) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) mRNAs were down-regulated compared with rats on standard chow. NPC2 did not improve liver weight, histopathology, levels of serum liver enzymes or pro-inflammatory tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), Interleukin (IL)-6, or IL-1β in HFHC rats. Two weeks of NPC2 treatment lowered hepatic TNFα and COL1A1 mRNA expression. However, this effect was ultimately reversed following additional two weeks of treatment. Four weeks NPC2 treatment of rats raised ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) mRNAs in the liver, concurrent with a strong tendency towards higher serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Furthermore, the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-ɣ (PPARG) gene expression was reduced.
NPC2 proved inefficient at modifying robust hepatic NASH end-points in a HFHC NASH model. Nonetheless, our data suggest that hepatic ABCA1 expression and reverse cholesterol transport were upregulated by NPC2 treatment, thus presenting putative therapeutic effects in diseases associated with deregulated lipid metabolism.
Chemosensing is a primary sense in nature, however little is known about its mechanism in Chelicerata. As a model organism we used the mite Varroa destructor, a key parasite of honeybees. Here we describe a transcriptomic analysis of two physiological stages for the Varroa foreleg, the site of primary olfactory organ. The transcriptomic analysis revealed transcripts of chemosensory related genes belonging to several groups. These include Niemann-Pick disease protein, type C2 (NPC2), gustatory receptors (GRs), ionotropic receptors (IRs), sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs) and odorant binding proteins (OBP). However, no insect odorant receptors (ORs) and odorant co-receptors (ORcos) were found. In addition, we identified a homolog of the most ancient IR co-receptor, IR25a, in Varroa as well as in other members of Acari. High expression of this transcript in the mite's forelegs, while not detectable in the other pairs of legs, suggests a function for this IR25a-like in Varroa chemosensing.
The purpose of this study was to determine the association of three proteins involved in sperm function on the freezability of porcine semen: the heat shock protein 90 alpha (HSP90a), the Niemann-Pick disease type C2 protein (NPC2), and lipocalin-type prostaglandin D synthase (L-PGDS). Six adult boars (each boar was ejaculated three times, 18 in total) were classified by freezability based on the percentage of functionally competent sperm. The male semen with highest freezability (MHF) and the male semen with lowest freezability (MLF) were centrifuged immediately after collection to separate seminal plasma and spermatozoa to make four possible combinations of these two components and to incubate them for 3 h, adjusting the temperature to 17 °C, to freeze them afterwards. The quantification of proteins was performed in two stages: at zero and at 3 h after incubation of the four combinations.
The spermatozoa × incubation time (IT) interaction only had effect (P &lt; 0.01) on HSP90a levels; this protein increased in seminal plasma, after 3 h of incubation, in larger quantity (P &lt; 0.05) in combinations with MLF spermatozoa. In relation with the NPC2 protein, two isoforms of 16 and 19 kDa were identified. The 19 kDa isoform was affected (P &lt; 0.01) only by the seminal plasma × IT interaction, with superior values (P &lt; 0.01) both at zero and three hours of incubation, in the combinations with MHF seminal plasma; and 16 kDa isoform was affected (P &lt; 0.01) only by the IT with reduction after 3 h of incubation. The levels of L-PGDS was affected (P &lt; 0.01) only by the spermatozoa × IT interaction, which reduced (P &lt; 0.01) in combinations with MLF spermatozoa after 3 h of incubation.
It is possible to consider that the three proteins evaluated were associated with freezability of boar semen due, especially, to the fact that mixtures with MLF spermatozoa showed greater increase levels of the HSP90a protein and reduction of L-PGDS in plasma. In addition, the seminal plasma of MHF had higher concentration of the NPC2 of 19 kDa protein, which was reduced by incubating with MHF spermatozoa.
Neuronal growth regulator 1 (NEGR1) is a newly identified raft-associated protein, which has recently been spotlighted as a new locus related to human obesity. Niemann-Pick disease Type C2 (NPC2) protein functions as a key player in the intracellular cholesterol trafficking, and its defect is linked to a fatal human neurodegenerative disease, NPC. In this study, we identified that NEGR1 interacts with NPC2 and increases its protein stability. Ectopically expressed NEGR1 proteins relieved an abnormal cholesterol accumulation in endosomal compartments. Importantly, NEGR1-defective mouse embryonic fibroblast cells exhibit increased cholesterol levels and triglyceride contents. These findings provide the first insight into the role of NEGR1 in intracellular cholesterol homeostasis, possibly explaining the missing link between NEGR1 with human obesity.
Export of LDL-derived cholesterol from lysosomes requires the cooperation of the integral membrane protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) and a soluble protein, Niemann-Pick C2 (NPC2). Mutations in the genes encoding these proteins lead to Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC). NPC2 binds to NPC1's second (middle), lumenally oriented domain (MLD) and transfers cholesterol to NPC1's N-terminal domain (NTD). Here, we report the 2.4-Å resolution crystal structure of a complex of human NPC1-MLD and NPC2 bearing bound cholesterol-3-O-sulfate. NPC1-MLD uses two protruding loops to bind NPC2, analogous to its interaction with the primed Ebola virus glycoprotein. Docking of the NPC1-NPC2 complex onto the full-length NPC1 structure reveals a direct cholesterol transfer tunnel between NPC2 and NTD cholesterol binding pockets, supporting the "hydrophobic hand-off" cholesterol transfer model.
In chronic liver diseases, regardless of their etiology, the development of fibrosis is the first step toward the progression to cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are the main profibrogenic cells that promote the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis, and so it is important to identify the molecules that regulate HSCs activation and liver fibrosis. Niemann-Pick type C2 (NPC2) protein plays an important role in the regulation of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis by directly binding with free cholesterol. However, the roles of NPC2 in HSCs activation and liver fibrosis have not been explored in detail. Since a high-cholesterol diet exacerbates liver fibrosis progression in both rodents and humans, we propose that the expression of NPC2 affects free cholesterol metabolism and regulates HSCs activation. In this study, we found that NPC2 is decreased in both thioacetamide- and carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis tissues. In addition, NPC2 is expressed in quiescent HSCs, but its activation status is down-regulated. Knockdown of NPC2 in HSC-T6 cells resulted in marked increases in transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)-induced collagen type 1 α1 (Col1a1), α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression, and Smad2 phosphorylation. In contrast, NPC2 overexpression decreased TGF-β1-induced HSCs activation. We further demonstrated that NPC2 deficiency significantly increased the accumulation of free cholesterol in HSCs, increasing Col1a1 and α-SMA expression and activating Smad2, and leading to sensitization of HSCs to TGF-β1 activation. In contrast, overexpression of NPC2 decreased U18666A-induced free cholesterol accumulation and inhibited the subsequent HSCs activation. In conclusion, our study has demonstrated that NPC2 plays an important role in HSCs activation by regulating the accumulation of free cholesterol. NPC2 overexpression may thus represent a new treatment strategy for liver fibrosis. 
In this study, we investigated the role and mechanism of Niemann-Pick type C (NPC)2 in regulating lysosomal activity, mitophagy, and mitochondrial function in adipocytes. We found that knocking down NPC2 impaired lysosomal activity, as evidenced by the reduced mature cathepsin B, the increased accumulation of light chain 3 (LC3) and p62, and the decreased autophagic flux. In NPC2-knockdown (kd) adipocytes, the starvation-induced conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II was abolished. More interestingly, the majority of NPC2 was found in the mitochondrial fraction, and NPC2 deficiency led to impaired autophagic flux and decreased induction of LC3-II in the mitochondrial fraction during mitochondrial stress. Moreover, cellular respiration profiling revealed that NPC2-kd adipocytes had significantly decreased basal/maximal respiration and mitochondrial gene expression compared with scrambled cells, suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, we found that the mitochondrial recruitment of LC3-II induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but not TNFα, was blunted in NPC2-kd adipocytes. Most intriguingly, NPC2-kd selectively diminished LPS-induced NFκB and ERK1/2 phosphorylation and the expression of pro-inflammatory genes, indicating that toll-like receptor signaling activation is impaired in the absence of NPC2. Our results suggest that NPC2 is in a mitochondrially associated autophagosome and plays an important role in regulating mitophagy, mitochondrial quality control, and mitochondrial function.
Niemann Pick type C (NP-C) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder caused by an impairment of intracellular lipid transport. Due to the heterogeneous clinical phenotype and the lack of a reliable blood test, diagnosis and therapy are often delayed for years. In the cell, accumulating cholesterol leads to increased formation of oxysterols that can be used as a powerful screening parameter for NP-C. In a large scale study, we evaluated the oxysterol cholestane-3β,5α,6β-triol (c-triol) as potential biomarker for a rapid diagnosis of NP-C. Using GC/MS, c-triol has been analyzed in 1902 plasma samples of patients with the suspicion for NP-C. Diagnosis in patients with elevated oxysterols was confirmed by genetic analysis. 71 new NP-C patients (69 NP-C1 and two NP-C2) and 12 Niemann Pick type A/B patients were identified. 24 new mutations in NPC1, one new mutation in NPC2 and three new mutations in the SMPD1 gene were found. Cholestane-3β,5α,6β-triol was elevated in Niemann Pick type C1, type C2, type A/B and in CESD disease. No other study has ever identified so many NP-C patients, proving that c-triol is a rapid and reliable biomarker to detect patients with NP-C disease and related cholesterol transport disorders. It should replace the filipin test as the first-line diagnostic assay. 
The choline metabolite, betaine, plays a role in lipid metabolism, and may predict the development of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) and lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) require phosphatidylcholine as substrate, raising the possibility that there is an intricate relationship of these protein factors with choline metabolism. Here we determined the relationships of PLTP and LCAT activity with betaine in subjects with and without T2DM.
Plasma betaine (nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy), PLTP activity (liposome-vesicle HDL system), LCAT activity (exogenous substrate assay) and (apo)lipoproteins were measured in 65 type 2 diabetic (T2DM) and in 55 non-diabetic subjects.
PLTP and LCAT activity were elevated in T2DM (p &lt; 0.05), whereas the difference in betaine was not significant. In age-, sex- and diabetes status-controlled correlation analysis, betaine was inversely correlated with triglycerides and positively with HDL cholesterol (p &lt; 0.05 to 0.01). PLTP and LCAT activity were positively correlated with triglycerides and inversely with HDL cholesterol (p &lt; 0.05 to 0.001). PLTP (r = -0.245, p = 0.006) and LCAT activity (r = -0.195, p = 0.035) were correlated inversely with betaine. The inverse association of PLTP activity with betaine remained significant after additional adjustment for body mass index and lipoprotein variables (β = -0.179, p = 0.034), whereas its association with LCAT activity lost significance (β = -0.056, p = 0.44).
Betaine may influence lipoprotein metabolism via an effect on PLTP activity.
Obesity-related childhood hypertension is associated with disturbances of serum lipids, but less is known about distribution of lipoprotein subclasses and activities of proteins involved in reverse cholesterol transport in hypertensive obese children. Our objective was to determine low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) subclasses distribution and activities of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) in hypertensive and non-hypertensive obese children.
A total of 40 hypertensive and 25 non-hypertensive obese children were enrolled. Lipoprotein subclasses were assessed by polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis. LCAT and CETP activities were determined as a rate of formation and a rate of transfer of cholesteryl esters.
Despite of comparable values of serum lipid parameters, a shift toward smaller LDL and HDL subclasses was observed in hypertensive compared to normotensive obese children. Activities of LCAT were similar, but proatherogenic CETP activities were significantly higher in the hypertensive group (p = 0.036). LCAT/net CETP ratio inversely correlated with relative proportion of small, dense LDL particles (ρ = -0.423; p = 0.025) in the group with hypertension.
The results of our study demonstrated a tendency toward altered distribution of lipoprotein subclasses in favor of more proatherogenic particles in childhood hypertension. Also, hypertensive obese children had increased proatherogenic CETP activity.
In sickle cell disease (SCD) cholesterol metabolism appears dysfunctional as evidenced by abnormal plasma cholesterol content in a subpopulation of SCD patients. Specific activity of the high density lipoprotein (HDL)-bound lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) enzyme, which catalyzes esterification of cholesterol, and generates lysoPC (LPC) was significantly lower in sickle plasma compared to normal. Inhibitory amounts of LPC were present in sickle plasma, and the red blood cell (RBC) lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT), essential for the removal of LPC, displayed a broad range of activity. The functionality of sickle HDL appeared to be altered as evidenced by a decreased HDL-Apolipoprotein A-I exchange in sickle plasma as compared to control. Increased levels of oxidized proteins including ApoA-I were detected in sickle plasma. In vitro incubation of sickle plasma with washed erythrocytes affected the ApoA-I-exchange supporting the view that the RBC blood compartment can affect cholesterol metabolism in plasma. HDL functionality appeared to decrease during acute vaso-occlusive episodes in sickle patients and was associated with an increase of secretory PLA2, a marker for increased inflammation. Simvastatin treatment to improve the anti-inflammatory function of HDL did not ameliorate HDL-ApoA-I exchange in sickle patients. Thus, the cumulative effect of an inflammatory and highly oxidative environment in sickle blood contributes to a decrease in cholesterol esterification and HDL function, related to hypocholesterolemia in SCD.
Nephrotic syndrome results in hyperlipidemia and profound alterations in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. Serum cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein B (apoB)-containing lipoproteins (very low-density lipoprotein [VLDL], immediate-density lipoprotein [IDL], and low-density lipoprotein [LDL]), lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]), and the total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio are increased in nephrotic syndrome. This is accompanied by significant changes in the composition of various lipoproteins including their cholesterol-to-triglyceride, free cholesterol-to-cholesterol ester, and phospholipid-to-protein ratios. These abnormalities are mediated by changes in the expression and activities of the key proteins involved in the biosynthesis, transport, remodeling, and catabolism of lipids and lipoproteins including apoproteins A, B, C, and E; 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase; fatty acid synthase; LDL receptor; lecithin cholesteryl ester acyltransferase; acyl coenzyme A cholesterol acyltransferase; HDL docking receptor (scavenger receptor class B, type 1 [SR-B1]); HDL endocytic receptor; lipoprotein lipase; and hepatic lipase, among others. The disorders of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in nephrotic syndrome contribute to the development and progression of cardiovascular and kidney disease. In addition, by limiting delivery of lipid fuel to the muscles for generation of energy and to the adipose tissues for storage of energy, changes in lipid metabolism contribute to the reduction of body mass and impaired exercise capacity. This article provides an overview of the mechanisms, consequences, and treatment of lipid disorders in nephrotic syndrome.
The long-term effects on growth performance, body composition, plasma metabolites, liver and intestine glucose and lipid metabolism were assessed in gilthead sea bream juveniles fed diets without carbohydrates (CH-) or carbohydrate-enriched (20 % gelatinised starch, CH+) combined with two lipid sources (fish oil; or vegetable oil (VO)). No differences in growth performance among treatments were observed. Carbohydrate intake was associated with increased hepatic transcripts of glucokinase but not of 6-phosphofructokinase. Expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase was down-regulated by carbohydrate intake, whereas, unexpectedly, glucose 6-phosphatase was up-regulated. Lipogenic enzyme activities (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme, fatty acid synthase) and ∆6 fatty acyl desaturase (FADS2) transcripts were increased in liver of fish fed CH+ diets, supporting an enhanced potential for lipogenesis and long-chain PUFA (LC-PUFA) biosynthesis. Despite the lower hepatic cholesterol content in CH+ groups, no influence on the expression of genes related to cholesterol efflux (ATP-binding cassette G5) and biosynthesis (lanosterol 14 α-demethylase, cytochrome P450 51 cytochrome P450 51 (CYP51A1); 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase) was recorded at the hepatic level. At the intestinal level, however, induction of CYP51A1 transcripts by carbohydrate intake was recorded. Dietary VO led to decreased plasma phospholipid and cholesterol concentrations but not on the transcripts of proteins involved in phospholipid biosynthesis (glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase) and cholesterol metabolism at intestinal and hepatic levels. Hepatic and muscular fatty acid profiles reflected that of diets, despite the up-regulation of FADS2 transcripts. Overall, this study demonstrated that dietary carbohydrates mainly affected carbohydrate metabolism, lipogenesis and LC-PUFA biosynthesis, whereas effects of dietary lipid source were mostly related with tissue fatty acid composition, plasma phospholipid and cholesterol concentrations, and LC-PUFA biosynthesis regulation. Interactions between dietary macronutrients induced modifications in tissue lipid and glycogen content.
Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is the form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease posing risk to progress into serious long term complications. Human and pre-clinical models implicate cellular cholesterol dysregulation playing important role in its development. Mouse model studies suggest synergism between dietary cholesterol and fat in contributing to NASH but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Our laboratory previously reported the primary importance of hepatic endoplasmic reticulum cholesterol (ER-Chol) in regulating hepatic ER stress by comparing the responses of wild type, Ldlr-/-xLcat+/+ and Ldlr-/-xLcat-/- mice, to a 2% high cholesterol diet (HCD). Here we further investigated the roles of ER-Chol and ER stress in HFHS diet-induced NASH using the same strains. With HFHS diet feeding, both WT and Ldlr-/-xLcat+/+ accumulate ER-Chol in association with ER stress and inflammasome activation but the Ldlr-/-xLcat-/- mice are protected. By contrast, all three strains accumulate cholesterol crystal, in correlation with ER-Chol, albeit less so in Ldlr-/-xLcat-/- mice. By comparison, HCD feeding per se (i) is sufficient to promote steatosis and activate inflammasomes, and (ii) results in dramatic accumulation of cholesterol crystal which is linked to inflammasome activation in Ldlr-/-xLcat-/- mice, independent of ER-Chol. Our data suggest that both dietary fat and cholesterol each independently promote steatosis, cholesterol crystal accumulation and inflammasome activation through distinct but complementary pathways. In vitro studies using palmitate-induced hepatic steatosis in HepG2 cells confirm the key roles by cellular cholesterol in the induction of steatosis and inflammasome activations. These novel findings provide opportunities for exploring a cellular cholesterol-focused strategy for treatment of NASH. 
Humans with familial lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) deficiency (FLD) have extremely low or undetectable high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and by early adulthood develop many manifestations of the disorder, including corneal opacities, anemia, and renal disease.
To determine if infusions of recombinant human LCAT (rhLCAT) could reverse the anemia, halt progression of renal disease, and normalize HDL in FLD.
rhLCAT (ACP-501) was infused intravenously over 1 hour on 3 occasions in a dose optimization phase (0.3, 3.0, and 9.0 mg/kg), then 3.0 or 9.0 mg/kg every 1 to 2 weeks for 7 months in a maintenance phase. Plasma lipoproteins, lipids, LCAT levels, and several measures of renal function and other clinical labs were monitored.
LCAT concentration peaked at the end of each infusion and decreased to near baseline over 7 days. Renal function generally stabilized or improved and the anemia improved. After infusion, HDL-C rapidly increased, peaking near normal in 8 to 12 hours; analysis of HDL particles by various methods all revealed rapid sequential disappearance of preβ-HDL and small α-4 HDL and appearance of normal α-HDL. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased more slowly than HDL-C. Of note, triglyceride routinely decreased after meals after infusion, in contrast to the usual postprandial increase in the absence of rhLCAT infusion.
rhLCAT infusions were well tolerated in this first-in-human study in FLD; the anemia improved, as did most parameters related to renal function in spite of advanced disease. Plasma lipids transiently normalized, and there was rapid sequential conversion of small preβ-HDL particles to mature spherical α-HDL particles.
Lipoproteins play a key role in the development of CVD, but the dynamics of lipoprotein metabolism are difficult to address experimentally. This article describes a novel two-step combined in vitro and in silico approach that enables the estimation of key reactions in lipoprotein metabolism using just one blood sample. Lipoproteins were isolated by ultracentrifugation from fasting plasma stored at 4°C. Plasma incubated at 37°C is no longer in a steady state, and changes in composition may be determined. From these changes, we estimated rates for reactions like LCAT (56.3 µM/h), β-LCAT (15.62 µM/h), and cholesteryl ester (CE) transfer protein-mediated flux of CE from HDL to IDL/VLDL (21.5 µM/h) based on data from 15 healthy individuals. In a second step, we estimated LDL's HL activity (3.19 pools/day) and, for the very first time, selective CE efflux from LDL (8.39 µM/h) by relying on the previously derived reaction rates. The estimated metabolic rates were then confirmed in an independent group (n = 10). Although measurement uncertainties do not permit us to estimate parameters in individuals, the novel approach we describe here offers the unique possibility to investigate lipoprotein dynamics in various diseases like atherosclerosis or diabetes.
Plasma lipoproteins are macromolecular assemblies of proteins and lipids found in the blood. The lipid components of lipoproteins are amphipathic lipids such as phospholipids (PLs), and unesterified cholesterols (UCs) and hydrophobic lipids such as cholesteryl esters (CEs) and triglycerides (TGs). Since lipoproteins are soft matter supramolecular assemblies easily deformable by thermal fluctuations and they also exist in varying densities and protein/lipid components, a detailed understanding of their structure/function is experimentally difficult. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has emerged as a particularly promising way to explore the structure and dynamics of lipoproteins. The purpose of this review is to survey the current status of computational studies of the lipid components of the lipoproteins. Computational studies aim to explore three levels of complexity for the 3-dimensional structural dynamics of lipoproteins at various metabolic stages: (i) lipoprotein particles consist of protein with minimal lipid; (ii) lipoprotein particles consist of PL-rich discoidal bilayer-like lipid particles; (iii) mature circulating lipoprotein particles consist of CE-rich or TG-rich spheroidal lipid-droplet-like particles. Due to energy barriers involved in conversion between these species, other biomolecules also participate in lipoprotein biological assembly. For example: (i) lipid-poor apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) interacts with ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) to produce nascent discoidal high density lipoprotein (dHDL) particles; (ii) lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) mediates the conversion of UC to CE in dHDL, driving spheroidal HDL (sHDL) formation; (iii) transfer proteins, cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) and phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP), transfer both CE and TG and PL, respectively, between lipoprotein particles. Computational studies have the potential to explore different lipoprotein particles at each metabolic stage in atomistic detail. This review discusses the current status of computational methods including all-atom MD (AAMD), coarse-grain MD (CGMD), and MD-simulated annealing (MDSA) and their applications in lipoprotein structural dynamics and biological assemblies. Results from MD simulations are discussed and compared across studies in order to identify key findings, controversies, issues and future directions. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Biosimulations edited by Ilpo Vattulainen and Tomasz Róg.
Human familial lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) deficiency (FLD) is characterized by low HDL, accumulation of an abnormal cholesterol-rich multilamellar particle called lipoprotein-X (LpX) in plasma, and renal disease. The aim of our study was to determine if LpX is nephrotoxic and to gain insight into the pathogenesis of FLD renal disease. We administered a synthetic LpX, nearly identical to endogenous LpX in its physical, chemical and biologic characteristics, to wild-type and Lcat-/- mice. Our in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated an apoA-I and LCAT-dependent pathway for LpX conversion to HDL-like particles, which likely mediates normal plasma clearance of LpX. Plasma clearance of exogenous LpX was markedly delayed in Lcat-/- mice, which have low HDL, but only minimal amounts of endogenous LpX and do not spontaneously develop renal disease. Chronically administered exogenous LpX deposited in all renal glomerular cellular and matrical compartments of Lcat-/- mice, and induced proteinuria and nephrotoxic gene changes, as well as all of the hallmarks of FLD renal disease as assessed by histological, TEM, and SEM analyses. Extensive in vivo EM studies revealed LpX uptake by macropinocytosis into mouse glomerular endothelial cells, podocytes, and mesangial cells and delivery to lysosomes where it was degraded. Endocytosed LpX appeared to be degraded by both human podocyte and mesangial cell lysosomal PLA2 and induced podocyte secretion of pro-inflammatory IL-6 in vitro and renal Cxl10 expression in Lcat-/- mice. In conclusion, LpX is a nephrotoxic particle that in the absence of Lcat induces all of the histological and functional hallmarks of FLD and hence may serve as a biomarker for monitoring recombinant LCAT therapy. In addition, our studies suggest that LpX-induced loss of endothelial barrier function and release of cytokines by renal glomerular cells likely plays a role in the initiation and progression of FLD nephrosis. 
Clinical data on the role as a lipokine of de novo lipogenesis-derived palmitoleic acid (C16:1n-7cis) in serum non-esterified fatty acids (palmitoleate) are scarce. We aimed to assess whether palmitoleate relates to cardiometabolic risk.
In this cross-sectional study we included 358 individuals aged 30-65-years at high cardiovascular risk. We tested the association of palmitoleate (determined by gas chromatography) with metabolic syndrome (MS) and its components (defined by ATPIII criteria), fatty liver index (a surrogate of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD]), and subclinical atherosclerosis (determined as ultrasound-measured carotid intima-media thickness and arterial stiffness). Palmitoleate concentration was higher in women compared with men (median ± range interquartile, 1.36 ± 0.96 vs. 0.97 ± 0.77 μmol/L respectively, P &lt; 0.001). In both genders palmitoleate concentration was associated with a higher prevalence of MS: men, odds ratio [OR: 1.12 (95%CI: 1.03; 1.23, P = 0.010)]; women [OR: 1.07 (95%CI: 1.03; 1.13, P = 0.005)], and all of its components except low HDL-cholesterol and hypertriglyceridemia. Palmitoleate was also associated with increased risk of NAFLD in both men [OR: 1.12 (95%CI: 1.03; 1.29, P = 0.031)] and women [OR: 1.11 (95%CI: 1.05; 1.19, P = 0.001)]. No associations with subclinical atherosclerosis were detected.
Our observational data supports a relationship between de novo lipogenesis-derived circulating palmitoleic acid (palmitoleate) and increased cardiometabolic risk.
The interaction of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) with apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) plays a critical role in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) maturation. We previously identified a highly solvent-exposed apoA-I loop domain (Leu(159)-Leu(170)) in nascent HDL, the so-called "solar flare" (SF) region, and proposed that it serves as an LCAT docking site (Wu, Z., Wagner, M. A., Zheng, L., Parks, J. S., Shy, J. M., 3rd, Smith, J. D., Gogonea, V., and Hazen, S. L. (2007) Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 14, 861-868). The stability and role of the SF domain of apoA-I in supporting HDL binding and activation of LCAT are debated. Here we show by site-directed mutagenesis that multiple residues within the SF region (Pro(165), Tyr(166), Ser(167), and Asp(168)) of apoA-I are critical for both LCAT binding to HDL and LCAT catalytic efficiency. The critical role for possible hydrogen bond interaction at apoA-I Tyr(166) was further supported using reconstituted HDL generated from apoA-I mutants (Tyr(166) → Glu or Asn), which showed preservation in both LCAT binding affinity and catalytic efficiency. Moreover, the in vivo functional significance of NO2-Tyr(166)-apoA-I, a specific post-translational modification on apoA-I that is abundant within human atherosclerotic plaque, was further investigated by using the recombinant protein generated from E. coli containing a mutated orthogonal tRNA synthetase/tRNACUA pair enabling site-specific insertion of the unnatural amino acid into apoA-I. NO2-Tyr(166)-apoA-I, after subcutaneous injection into hLCAT(Tg/Tg), apoA-I(-/-) mice, showed impaired LCAT activation in vivo, with significant reduction in HDL cholesteryl ester formation. The present results thus identify multiple structural features within the solvent-exposed SF region of apoA-I of nascent HDL essential for optimal LCAT binding and catalytic efficiency. 
The protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii develops within a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) in mammalian cells, where it scavenges cholesterol. When cholesterol is present in excess in its environment, the parasite expulses this lipid into the PV or esterifies it for storage in lipid bodies. Here, we characterized a unique T. gondii homologue of mammalian lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), a key enzyme that produces cholesteryl esters via transfer of acyl groups from phospholipids to the 3-OH of free cholesterol, leading to the removal of excess cholesterol from tissues. TgLCAT contains a motif characteristic of serine lipases "AHSLG" and the catalytic triad consisting of serine, aspartate, and histidine (SDH) from LCAT enzymes. TgLCAT is secreted by the parasite, but unlike other LCAT enzymes it is cleaved into two proteolytic fragments that share the residues of the catalytic triad and need to be reassembled to reconstitute enzymatic activity. TgLCAT uses phosphatidylcholine as substrate to form lysophosphatidylcholine that has the potential to disrupt membranes. The released fatty acid is transferred to cholesterol, but with a lower transesterification activity than mammalian LCAT. TgLCAT is stored in a subpopulation of dense granule secretory organelles, and following secretion, it localizes to the PV and parasite plasma membrane. LCAT-null parasites have impaired growth in vitro, reduced virulence in animals, and exhibit delays in egress from host cells. Parasites overexpressing LCAT show increased virulence and faster egress. These observations demonstrate that TgLCAT influences the outcome of an infection, presumably by facilitating replication and egress depending on the developmental stage of the parasite. 
High density lipoproteins (HDL) protect against cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, increased serum amyloid-A (SAA) related inflammation may negate this property. This study investigated if SAA was related to CVD-burden.
Subjects referred to the rapid chest pain clinic (n = 240) had atherosclerotic burden assessed by cardiac computerised tomography angiography. Subjects were classified as: no-CVD (n = 106), non-obstructive-CVD, stenosis&lt;50% (n = 58) or moderate/significant-CVD, stenosis ≥50% (n = 76). HDL was subfractionated into HDL2 and HDL3 by rapid-ultracentrifugation. SAA-concentration was measured by ELISA and lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity measured by a fluorimetric assay.
We illustrated that serum-SAA and HDL3-SAA-concentration were higher and HDL3-LCAT-activity lower in the moderate/significant-CVD-group, compared to the no-CVD and non-obstructive-CVD-groups (percent differences: serum-SAA, +33% &amp; +30%: HDL3-SAA, +65% and +39%: HDL3-LCAT, -6% &amp; -3%; p &lt; 0.05 for all comparisons). We also identified a positive correlation between serum-SAA and HDL3-SAA (r = 0.698; p &lt; 0.001) and a negative correlation between HDL3-SAA and HDL3-LCAT-activity (r = -0.295; p = 0.003), while CVD-burden positively correlated with serum-SAA (r = 0.150; p &lt; 0.05) and HDL3-SAA (r = 0.252; p &lt; 0.001) and negatively correlated with HDL3-LCAT-activity (r = -0.182; p = 0.006). Additionally, multivariate regression analysis adjusted for age, gender, CRP and serum-SAA illustrated that HDL3-SAA was significantly associated with modifying CVD-risk of moderate/significant CVD-risk (p &lt; 0.05).
This study has demonstrated increased SAA-related inflammation in subjects with moderate/significant CVD-burden, which appeared to impact on the antiatherogenic potential of HDL. We suggest that SAA may be a useful biomarker to illustrate increased CVD-burden, although this requires further investigation.
Drug discovery opportunities where loss-of-function alleles of a target gene link to a disease-relevant phenotype often require an agonism approach to up-regulate or re-establish the activity of the target gene. Antibody therapy is increasingly recognized as a favored drug modality due to multiple desirable pharmacological properties. However, agonistic antibodies that enhance the activities of the target enzymes are rarely developed because the discovery of agonistic antibodies remains elusive. Here we report an innovative scheme of discovery and characterization of human antibodies capable of binding to and agonizing a circulating enzyme lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). Utilizing a modified human LCAT protein with enhanced enzymatic activity as an immunogen, we generated fully human monoclonal antibodies using the XenoMouse(TM) platform. One of the resultant agonistic antibodies, 27C3, binds to and substantially enhances the activity of LCAT from humans and cynomolgus macaques. X-ray crystallographic analysis of the 2.45 Å LCAT-27C3 complex shows that 27C3 binding does not induce notable structural changes in LCAT. A single administration of 27C3 to cynomolgus monkeys led to a rapid increase of plasma LCAT enzymatic activity and a 35% increase of the high density lipoprotein cholesterol that was observed up to 32 days after 27C3 administration. Thus, this novel scheme of immunization in conjunction with high throughput screening may represent an effective strategy for discovering agonistic antibodies against other enzyme targets. 27C3 and other agonistic human anti-human LCAT monoclonal antibodies described herein hold potential for therapeutic development for the treatment of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease. 
Dietary triglycerides (TG) are absorbed by the enterocytes of the small intestine after luminal hydrolysis into monacylglycerol and fatty acids. Before secretion on chylomicrons, these lipids are reesterified into TG, primarily through the monoacylglycerol pathway. However, targeted deletion of the primary murine monoacylglycerol acyltransferase does not quantitatively affect lipid absorption, suggesting the existence of alternative pathways. Therefore, we investigated the role of the glycerol 3-phosphate pathway in dietary lipid absorption. The expression of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT3) was examined throughout the small intestine. To evaluate the role for GPAT3 in lipid absorption, mice harboring a disrupted GPAT3 gene (Gpat3(-/-)) were subjected to an oral lipid challenge and fed a Western-type diet to characterize the role in lipid and cholesterol homeostasis. Additional mechanistic studies were performed in primary enterocytes. GPAT3 was abundantly expressed in the apical surface of enterocytes in the small intestine. After an oral lipid bolus, Gpat3(-/-) mice exhibited attenuated plasma TG excursion and accumulated lipid in the enterocytes. Electron microscopy studies revealed a lack of lipids in the lamina propria and intercellular space in Gpat3(-/-) mice. Gpat3(-/-) enterocytes displayed a compensatory increase in the synthesis of phospholipid and cholesteryl ester. When fed a Western-type diet, hepatic TG and cholesteryl ester accumulation was significantly higher in Gpat3(-/-) mice compared with the wild-type mice accompanied by elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, a marker of liver injury. Dysregulation of bile acid metabolism was also evident in Gpat3-null mice. These studies identify GPAT3 as a novel enzyme involved in intestinal lipid metabolism. 
Low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) may be caused by rate-limiting amounts of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). Raising LCAT may be beneficial for CHD, as well as for familial LCAT deficiency, a rare disorder of low HDL-C.
To determine safety and tolerability of recombinant human LCAT infusion in subjects with stable CHD and low HDL-C and its effect on plasma lipoproteins.
A phase 1b, open-label, single-dose escalation study was conducted to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of recombinant human LCAT (ACP-501). Four cohorts with stable CHD and low HDL-C were dosed (0.9, 3.0, 9.0, and 13.5 mg/kg, single 1-hour infusions) and followed up for 28 days. ACP-501 was well tolerated, and there were no serious adverse events. Plasma LCAT concentrations were dose-proportional, increased rapidly, and declined with an apparent terminal half-life of 42 hours. The 0.9-mg/kg dose did not significantly change HDL-C; however, 6 hours after doses of 3.0, 9.0, and 13.5 mg/kg, HDL-C was elevated by 6%, 36%, and 42%, respectively, and remained above baseline ≤4 days. Plasma cholesteryl esters followed a similar time course as HDL-C. ACP-501 infusion rapidly decreased small- and intermediate-sized HDL, whereas large HDL increased. Pre-β-HDL also rapidly decreased and was undetectable ≤12 hours post ACP-501 infusion.
ACP-501 has an acceptable safety profile after a single intravenous infusion. Lipid and lipoprotein changes indicate that recombinant human LCAT favorably alters HDL metabolism and support recombinant human LCAT use in future clinical trials in CHD and familial LCAT deficiency patients.

Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) is the only enzyme capable of esterifying cholesterol in plasma, thus determining the maturation of high-density lipoproteins. Because it maintains an unesterified cholesterol gradient between peripheral cells and extracellular acceptors, for a long time, LCAT has been considered as a key enzyme in reverse cholesterol transport. However, despite the fact that it has been more than 50 years since the identification of LCAT, the role of this enzyme in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is still debated. A number of studies have been conducted in different animal models, with contradictory results. Studies in humans, in particular in the general population, in subjects at high cardiovascular risk, and in carriers of genetic LCAT deficiency in an excellent model to evaluate the correlation between the reduction of LCAT activity and atherosclerosis also gave conflicting results. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the controversial findings obtained in animals and humans, strengthening the necessity of further investigation to establish how LCAT could be regulated in a promising therapeutic strategy to reduce cardiovascular risk. 
Recent studies have suggested a possible role of high levels of plasma lysophosphocholines (lysoPCs) in fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). The aim of this study was to evaluate the content of plasma phospholipases (e.g., Platelet Activating Factor Acetyl Hydrolase [PAF-AH], secretory Phospholipase A2 [sPLA2 ], Total Antioxidant Capacity [TAOC] and 2,7,8-trimethyl-2-(2-carboxyethyl)-6-hydroxy chroman [γ-CEHC]) in FMS patients and their association with clinical status and quality of life.
Thirty-six females meeting the 2011 American College of Rheumatology criteria for the classification of FMS and thirty-four healthy females were enrolled for the study. Plasma enzyme levels were quantified using commercial enzyme-linked-immunosorbent-assay (ELISA). In order to assess the disease severity and the functional status of patients, the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnarie (FIQ) was used.
Higher levels of sPLA2 and lower PAF-AH and γ-CEHC were observed in the plasma of FMS patients compared to the controls. A decrease in PAF-AH and TAOC levels were found in severe FMS (S-FMS) compared to mild/slight (MS-FMS) forms.
The results of the study indicate a possible involvement of phospholipases and γ-CEHC in fibromyalgia syndrome.
In this communication, we report a patient with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) associated with a familial dyslipidemia. Genetic analysis revealed a novel heterozygous valosin-containing protein (VCP) mutation (c.466G&gt;T (p.G156C)). The other gene analysis also disclosed a known homozygous LCAT mutation (c.101C&gt;T (p.P10L)). VCP gene mutation shown should be responsible for familial ALS because of following reasons. The patient's father also was also affected by ALS. The VCP gene mutation (p.G156C) in the patient was located in the vicinity of a site frequently associated with pathogenic VCP variants. The same amino acid transformation as that of this patient has been reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of inclusion body myopathy with Paget's disease of the bone and frontotemporal dementia. This is the first case report of rare association of ALS with VCP mutation and dyslipidemia with LCAT mutation. 
24-Hydroxycholesterol (24OH-C) is esterified by the enzyme lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We report here that the level of 24OH-C esters was lower in CSF of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis than in healthy subjects (54% vs 68% of total 24OH-C, p=0.0005; n=8). Similarly, the level of 24OH-C esters in plasma was lower in patients than in controls (62% vs 77% of total 24OH-C; p=0.0076). The enzyme amount in CSF, as measured by densitometry of the protein band revealed by immunoblotting, was about 4-fold higher in patients than in controls (p=0.0085). As differences in the concentration of the LCAT stimulator Apolipoprotein E were not found, we hypothesized that the reduced 24OH-C esterification in CSF of patients might depend on oxidative stress. We actually found that oxidative stress reduced LCAT activity in vitro, and 24OH-C effectively stimulated the enzyme secretion from astrocytoma cells in culture. Enhanced LCAT secretion from astrocytes might represent an adaptive response to the increase of non-esterified 24OH-C percentage, aimed to avoid the accumulation of this neurotoxic compound. The low degree of 24OH-C esterification in CSF or plasma might reflect reduced activity of LCAT during neurodegeneration. 
We sought to identify biochemical predictors that indicate susceptibility to in-stent restenosis (ISR) after coronary artery bare-metal stenting.
A total of 111 consecutive patients with post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in-stent restenosis of a target lesion within 12 months were matched for age, sex, vessel diameter, and diabetes with 111 controls without post-PCI ISR. Plasma or serum levels of biochemical markers were measured: matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 2, 3, 9; myeloperoxidase (MPO); asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA); lipoprotein (a) (Lp[a]); apolipoproteins E and D (ApoE and D); and lecitin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). Multivariable logistic regression association tests were performed.
Increased plasma MMP-3 (OR: 1.013; 95% CI: 1.004-1.023; P = 0.005), MMP-9 (OR: 1.014; 95% CI: 1.008-1.020; P &lt; 0.0001) or MPO (OR: 1,003; 95% CI: 1.001-1.005; P = 0.002) was significantly associated with increased risk of ISR. Increased levels of ADMA (OR: 0.212; 95% CI: 0.054-0.827; P = 0.026), ApoE (OR: 0.924; 95% CI: 0.899-0.951; P &lt; 0.0001), ApoD (OR: 0.919; 95% CI: 0.880-0.959; P = 0.0001), or LCAT (OR: 0.927; 95% CI: 0.902-0.952; P &lt; 0.0001) was associated with risk reduction. No correlation was found between plasma MMP-2 or Lp (a) and ISR risk.
Increased levels of MMP-3, MMP-9, and MPO represent predictors of ISR after bare-metal stent implantation. In contrast, increased ADMA, LCAT, and Apo E and D indicate a decreased in-stent restenosis occurrence.
Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) is a key enzyme in the esterification of cholesterol and its subsequent incorporation into the core of high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. It is also involved in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), the mechanism by which cholesterol is removed from peripheral cells and transported to the liver for excretion. These processes are involved in the development of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease (CHD) and may have therapeutic implications. This work describes the use of baculovirus as a transducing vector to express LCAT in mammalian cells, expression of the recombinant protein as a high-mannose glycoform suitable for deglycosylation by Endo H and its purification to homogeneity and characterization. The importance of producing underglycosylated forms of secreted glycoproteins to obtain high-resolution crystal structures is discussed.
Low-normal thyroid function within the euthyroid range may influence plasma lipoprotein levels. Associations between variation in thyroid function and pre-β-high density lipoproteins (pre-β-HDL), i.e. lipid-poor or lipid free HDL particles that act as initial acceptor of cell-derived cholesterol, are unknown. We determined relationships of plasma pre-β-HDL with thyroid function in euthyroid subjects with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
TSH, free T4, plasma (apo)lipoproteins, pre-β-HDL, pre-β-HDL formation (pre-β-HDL generation during incubation with lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase being inhibited) and phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) activity were measured in fasting plasma from 72 T2DM and 82 non-diabetic subjects.
TSH was similar and free T4 was slightly higher (P &lt; 0.05) in T2DM vs. non-diabetic subjects. HDL cholesterol and apoA-I were lower, whereas pre-β-HDL (expressed as % of apoA-I), triglycerides and PLTP activity were higher in T2DM (P &lt; 0.05 to P &lt; 0.001). In T2DM, pre-β-HDL formation (in apoA-I concentration and in % of apoA-I) was positively related to free T4, PLTP activity, total cholesterol and triglycerides (P &lt; 0.05 for each). Multivariable linear regression analyses, adjusted for age, sex, PLTP activity, total cholesterol and triglycerides, demonstrated that pre-β-HDL formation was positively related to free T4 (in apoA-I concentration: β = 0.278, P = 0.014; in % of apoA-I: β = 0.343, P = 0.003) in T2DM, but not in non-diabetic subjects (both P &gt; 0.30; interaction terms: both P &lt; 0.05).
Variations in thyroid function within the euthyroid range may influence the metabolism of pre-β-HDL in T2DM.
Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) deficiency is associated with hypoalphalipoproteinemia, generally a predisposing factor for premature coronary heart disease. The evidence of accelerated atherosclerosis in LCAT-deficient subjects is however controversial. In this study, the effect of LCAT deficiency on vascular tone and endothelial function was investigated in LCAT knockout mice, which reproduce the human lipoprotein phenotype. Aortas from wild-type (Lcat(wt)) and LCAT knockout (Lcat(KO)) mice exposed to noradrenaline showed reduced contractility in Lcat(KO) mice (P&lt;0.005), whereas acetylcholine exposure showed a lower NO-dependent relaxation in Lcat(KO) mice (P&lt;0.05). Quantitative PCR and Western blotting analyses suggested an adequate eNOS expression in Lcat(KO) mouse aortas. Real-time PCR analysis indicated increased expression of β2-adrenergic receptors vs wild-type mice. Aorta stimulation with noradrenaline in the presence of propranolol, to abolish the β-mediated relaxation, showed the same contractile response in the two mouse lines. Furthermore, propranolol pretreatment of mouse aortas exposed to L-NAME prevented the difference in responses between Lcat(wt) and Lcat(KO) mice. The results indicate that LCAT deficiency leads to increased β2-adrenergic relaxation and to a consequently decreased NO-mediated vasodilation that can be reversed to guarantee a correct vascular tone. The present study suggests that LCAT deficiency is not associated with an impaired vascular reactivity. 
Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with changes in HDL levels, composition and sub-fraction profile. Whether these alterations affect HDL anti-atherogenic function, specifically measured as its capacity to perform cholesterol efflux, is not yet clearly known.
To evaluate the relation between serum cholesterol efflux capacity and the changes in HDL composition and sub-fraction profile in MetS.
In 35 non-treated MetS patients and 15 healthy controls, HDL mediated cholesterol efflux was measured as the ability of apoB-depleted serum to accept cholesterol from cholesterol-loaded BHK cells expressing either ABCA1 or ABCG1. Additionally we determined: lipid profile, HDL sub-fractions (NMR) and LCAT mass (ELISA). Isolated HDL (δ:1.063-1.210 g/mL) was chemically characterized. Pre-β1-HDL was determined by 2D-electrophoresis in a sub-group of MetS and controls (n = 6 each).
Surprisingly, MetS patients presented higher ABCA1 mediated cholesterol efflux (10.4 ± 1.8 vs. 8.7 ± 0.3%; p = 0.0001), without differences in ABCG1 efflux. In MetS, HDL showed reduction in particle size and number (p &lt; 0.02) and lower large/small HDL ratio (p = 0.05), as well as triglyceride enrichment (p = 0.0001). Pre-β1-HDL was increased in MetS (p = 0.048) and correlated with ABCA1-cholesterol efflux (r = 0.64; p = 0.042). LCAT mass showed a tendency to reduction in MetS (p = 0.08), and inversely correlated with ABCA1-cholesterol efflux (r = -0.51; p = 0.001), independently of obesity and insulin-resistance (β = -0.40, p = 0.034).
This is the first description of ABCA1 mediated cholesterol efflux in MetS. Regardless the reduced HDL-cholesterol, in vitro cholesterol efflux capacity by ABCA1 was enhanced, linked to increased pre-β1-HDL and slightly reduced in LCAT mass that would probably reflect a delay in reverse cholesterol transport occurring in MetS.
We observed the variation in in vivo blood lipid and blood glucose metabolism in rats with atherosclerosis after 5-(3,4-dihydroxy-phenyl)-1-piperidin-1-yl-penta-2,4-dien-1-one (GBOT) administration. Wistar rats aged 10 weeks received a high-fat diet to establish the atherosclerosis model. Metabolic indices related to blood lipid and blood glucose were measured before modeling and at 4 and 8 weeks after modeling. Liver fat levels in rats were measured at 8 weeks to analyze the relationship between liver fat and blood lipid levels. We examined the mechanism of blood lipid reduction. The levels of serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in rats in the control group were significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.05) compared with those in the 4-week control group at 4 weeks and decreased significantly and continuously until the 8th week (P &lt; 0.05). Compared with the 8-week control group, the blood glucose level in rats in the 8-week experimental group decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.05), and the level of insulin sensitivity index decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.05). Compared with the control group, triglyceride and total cholesterol levels per unit mass in rat liver tissue in the 8-week experimental group decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.05). Western blotting indicated that GBOT significantly increased the expression of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase, low-density lipoprotein receptor, and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase proteins. GBOT can significantly decrease the levels of blood lipid and blood glucose in rat models of atherosclerosis, and its mechanism may be associated with the promotion of expression of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase, low-density lipoprotein receptor, and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase proteins. 
LCAT is intimately involved in HDL maturation and is a key component of the reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) pathway which removes excess cholesterol molecules from the peripheral tissues to the liver for excretion. Patients with loss-of-function LCAT mutations exhibit low levels of HDL cholesterol and corneal opacity. Here we report the 2.65 Å crystal structure of the human LCAT protein. Crystallization required enzymatic removal of N-linked glycans and complex formation with a Fab fragment from a tool antibody. The crystal structure reveals that LCAT has an α/β hydrolase core with two additional subdomains that play important roles in LCAT function. Subdomain 1 contains the region of LCAT shown to be required for interfacial activation, while subdomain 2 contains the lid and amino acids that shape the substrate binding pocket. Mapping the naturally occurring mutations onto the structure provides insight into how they may affect LCAT enzymatic activity. 
Meeting the complex physiological demands of mammalian life requires strict control of the metabolism of long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs because of the multiplicity of their cellular functions. Acyl-CoAs are substrates for energy production; stored within lipid droplets as triacylglycerol, cholesterol esters, and retinol esters; esterified to form membrane phospholipids; or used to activate transcriptional and signaling pathways. Indirect evidence suggests that acyl-CoAs do not wander freely within cells, but instead, are channeled into specific pathways. In this review, we will discuss the evidence for acyl-CoA compartmentalization, highlight the key modes of acyl-CoA regulation, and diagram potential mechanisms for controlling acyl-CoA partitioning. 
The serum concentration of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is one of the important heritable risk factors for cardiovascular disease and is a target for therapeutic intervention. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) gene polymorphism rs5923 on LCAT enzyme activity and serum HDL-C concentration.
The study population was selected from consecutive individuals with HDL-C ≤ 5th percentile (n = 73) and extremely high HDL-C ≥ 95th percentile (n = 57) who had participated in the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study. The rs5923 polymorphism was genotyped using direct sequencing. LCAT activity was measured by fluorometric assay kit, and lipid concentrations were measured using the enzymatic colorimetric method.
The genotype frequencies were significantly different between the high HDL-C group (CC 94.7%, CT 5.3%) and the low HDL-C group (CC 83.6%, CT 16.4%) (P = 0.048). The T-allele frequencies in subjects with low and high HDL-C were 0.082 and 0.026, respectively (P = 0.16). The association of the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs5923 with low HDL-C was not statistically significant after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI (odd ratio = 2.65, 95% confidence interval = 0.32-21.5, P = 0.36, regression logistic analysis). Also, the effects of LCAT enzyme activity did not depend on the HDL-C level (P = 0.24).
rs5923 polymorphism is not associated with low HDL-C levels in Iranian population.
The cholesterol-esterifying enzyme, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), is instrumental in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) remodelling. LCAT may also modify oxidative and inflammatory processes, as supported by an inverse relationship with HDL antioxidative functionality and a positive relationship with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). GlycA is a recently developed proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy-measured biomarker of inflammation whose signal originates from a subset of N-acetylglucosamine residues on the most abundant glycosylated acute-phase proteins. Plasma GlycA correlates positively with hsCRP and may predict cardiovascular disease even independent of hsCRP. Here, we tested the extent to which plasma GlycA is elevated in metabolic syndrome (MetS), and determined its relationship with LCAT activity.
Plasma GlycA, hsCRP, serum amyloid A (SAA), tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and LCAT activity were measured in 58 subjects with MetS (including 46 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)) and in 45 nondiabetic subjects without MetS.
Plasma GlycA was higher in MetS coinciding with higher hsCRP and LCAT activity (P &lt; 0.01 for each). In all subjects combined, GlycA was correlated positively with hsCRP, SAA and LCAT activity (P &lt; 0.001 for each), but not with TNF-α. Age- and sex-adjusted multivariable linear regression analysis revealed that GlycA was positively associated with LCAT activity (P = 0.029), independent of the presence of MetS, T2DM, hsCRP and SAA. GlycA was unrelated to diabetes status.
A pro-inflammatory glycoprotein biomarker, GlycA, is higher in MetS. Higher plasma levels of this glycoprotein biomarker relate to increased LCAT activity in the setting of MetS.
We report a novel heterozygous apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) missense mutation (c.517C&gt;A, p.Arg149Ser, designated as apoA-IBoston) in a 67-year-old woman and her 2 sons, who had mean serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, apoA-I, and apoA-I in very large α-1 HDL that were 10%, 35%, and 16% of normal, respectively (all P &lt; .05). The percentage of HDL cholesterol in the esterified form was also significantly (P &lt; .05) reduced to 52% of control values. Cholesteryl ester tranfer protein (CETP) activity was normal. The mean global, adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporter A1 and scavenger receptor B type I-mediated cellular cholesterol efflux capacity in apoB-depleted serum from affected family members were 41%, 37%, 47%, 54%, and 48% of control values, respectively (all P &lt; .05). lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity in plasma was 71% of controls, whereas in the cell-based assay, it was 73% of control values (P &lt; .05). The data indicate that this novel apoA-I missense is associated with markedly decreased levels of HDL cholesterol and very large α-1 HDL, as well as decreased serum cellular cholesterol efflux and LCAT activity, but not with premature coronary heart disease, similar to other apoA-I mutations that have been associated with decreased LCAT activity. 
A series of in vitro evaluation in our previous studies had proved that arachidonic acid (AA) modification could suppress the remodeling behaviors of lovastatin-loaded discoidal reconstituted high density lipoprotein (LT-d-rHDL) by restraining the reactivity with lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) for reducing undesired drug leakage. This study focuses on the investigation of AA-modified LT-d-rHDL (AA-LT-d-rHDL) in atherosclerotic New Zealand White (NZW) rabbit models to explore whether AA modification could enhance drug targeting delivery and improve antiatherogenic efficacies in vivo.
After pharmacokinetics of AA-LT-d-rHDL modified with different AA amount were investigated in atherosclerotic NZW rabbits, atherosclerotic lesions targeting property was assessed by ex vivo imaging of aortic tree and drug distribution. Furthermore, their antiatherogenic efficacies were elaborately evaluated and compared by typical biochemical indices.
With AA modification amount augmenting, circulation time of AA-LT-d-rHDL was prolonged, and drug accumulation in the target locus was increased, eventually the significant appreciation in antiatherogenic efficacies were further supported by lower level of bad cholesterol, decreased atherosclerotic lesions areas and mean intima-media thickness (MIT), markedly attenuated matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) protein expression and macrophage infiltration.
This proof-of-concept study demonstrated that AA-LT-d-rHDL could enhance drug accumulation in atherosclerotic lesion and impede atherosclerosis progression more effectively.
The response of cholesterol metabolism to a negative energy balance (NEB) induced by feed restriction for 3 weeks starting at 100 days in milk (DIM) compared to the physiologically occurring NEB in week 1 postpartum (p.p.) was investigated in 50 dairy cows (25 control (CON) and 25 feed-restricted (RES)). Blood samples, liver biopsies and milk samples were taken in week 1 p.p., and in weeks 0 and 3 of feed restriction. Plasma concentrations of total cholesterol (C), phospholipids (PL), triglycerides (TAG), very low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (VLDL-C) and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) increased in RES cows from week 0 to 3 during feed restriction and were higher in week 3 compared to CON cows. In contrast, during the physiologically occurring NEB in week 1 p.p., C, PL, TAG and lipoprotein concentrations were at a minimum. Plasma phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) and lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activities did not differ between week 0 and 3 for both groups, whereas during NEB in week 1 p.p. PLTP activity was increased and LCAT activity was decreased. Milk C concentration was not affected by feed restriction in both groups, whereas milk C mass was decreased in week 3 for RES cows. In comparison, C concentration and mass in milk were elevated in week 1 p.p. Hepatic mRNA abundance of sterol regulatory element-binding factor-2 (SREBF-2), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase 1 (HMGCS1), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), and ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCA1) were similar in CON and RES cows during feed restriction, but were upregulated during NEB in week 1 p.p. compared to the non-lactating stage without a NEB. In conclusion, cholesterol metabolism in dairy cows is affected by nutrient and energy deficiency depending on the stage of lactation. 
Disorders of blood lipid metabolism are the primary risk factors for many diseases. Recently, the effect of Pu-erh tea on blood lipid metabolism has received increasing attention. However, the mechanism underlying its ability to regulate blood lipid metabolism is unclear. We set out to study this through assessing the effects of Pu-erh tea aqueous extract (PTAE) on the central enzymes of blood lipid metabolism, including lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) and pancreatic lipase (PL). We find that the Lp-PLA2, HMRG and PL activities are inhibited by PTAE in a dose-dependent manner and that the LCAT activity tends to increase with increasing PTAE concentrations. Lineweaver-Burk plot analyses reveal that PTAE acts as a competitive inhibitor for HMGR and PL and as a noncompetitive inhibitor for Lp-PLA2. Moreover, we determine that its active ingredients include catechins, gallic acid, caffeine, free amino acids, and soluble sugar. However, the effect of each ingredient and whether any of them have synergistic effects are still unknown. The results suggest that Pu-erh tea has a potent ability to regulate blood lipid metabolism and knowledge of the mechanisms provides insights into its potential therapeutic application as an alternative hypolipidemic drug.
Observationally, low levels of HDL cholesterol are consistently associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Therefore, plasma HDL cholesterol increasing has been suggested as a novel therapeutic option to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. Whether levels of HDL cholesterol are causally associated with type 2 diabetes is unknown. In a prospective study of the general population (n = 47,627), we tested whether HDL cholesterol-related genetic variants were associated with low HDL cholesterol levels and, in turn, with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. HDL cholesterol-decreasing gene scores and allele numbers associated with up to -13 and -20% reductions in HDL cholesterol levels. The corresponding theoretically predicted hazard ratios for type 2 diabetes were 1.44 (95% CI 1.38-1.52) and 1.77 (1.61-1.95), whereas the genetic estimates were nonsignificant. Genetic risk ratios for type 2 diabetes for a 0.2 mmol/L reduction in HDL cholesterol were 0.91 (0.75-1.09) and 0.93 (0.78-1.11) for HDL cholesterol-decreasing gene scores and allele numbers, respectively, compared with the corresponding observational hazard ratio of 1.37 (1.32-1.42). In conclusion, genetically reduced HDL cholesterol does not associate with increased risk of type 2 diabetes, suggesting that the corresponding observational association is due to confounding and/or reverse causation. 
LCAT, a plasma enzyme that esterifies cholesterol, has been proposed to play an antiatherogenic role, but animal and epidemiologic studies have yielded conflicting results. To gain insight into LCAT and the role of free cholesterol (FC) in atherosclerosis, we examined the effect of LCAT over- and underexpression in diet-induced atherosclerosis in scavenger receptor class B member I-deficient [Scarab(-/-)] mice, which have a secondary defect in cholesterol esterification. Scarab(-/-)×LCAT-null [Lcat(-/-)] mice had a decrease in HDL-cholesterol and a high plasma ratio of FC/total cholesterol (TC) (0.88 ± 0.033) and a marked increase in VLDL-cholesterol (VLDL-C) on a high-fat diet. Scarab(-/-)×LCAT-transgenic (Tg) mice had lower levels of VLDL-C and a normal plasma FC/TC ratio (0.28 ± 0.005). Plasma from Scarab(-/-)×LCAT-Tg mice also showed an increase in cholesterol esterification during in vitro cholesterol efflux, but increased esterification did not appear to affect the overall rate of cholesterol efflux or hepatic uptake of cholesterol. Scarab(-/-)×LCAT-Tg mice also displayed a 51% decrease in aortic sinus atherosclerosis compared with Scarab(-/-) mice (P &lt; 0.05). In summary, we demonstrate that increased cholesterol esterification by LCAT is atheroprotective, most likely through its ability to increase HDL levels and decrease pro-atherogenic apoB-containing lipoprotein particles. 
We have investigated how the natural LCAT[T147I] and LCAT[P274S] mutations affect the pathway of biogenesis of HDL. Gene transfer of WT LCAT in LCAT(-/-) mice increased 11.8-fold the plasma cholesterol, whereas the LCAT[T147I] and LCAT[P274S] mutants caused a 5.2- and 2.9-fold increase, respectively. The LCAT[P274S] and the WT LCAT caused a monophasic distribution of cholesterol in the HDL region, whereas the LCAT[T147I] caused a biphasic distribution of cholesterol in the LDL and HDL region. Fractionation of plasma showed that the expression of WT LCAT increased plasma apoE and apoA-IV levels and shifted the distribution of apoA-I to lower densities. The LCAT[T147I] and LCAT[P274S] mutants restored partially apoA-I in the HDL3 fraction and LCAT[T147I] increased apoE in the VLD/IDL/LDL fractions. The in vivo functionality of LCAT was further assessed based on is its ability to correct the aberrant HDL phenotype that was caused by the apoA-I[L159R]FIN mutation. Co-infection of apoA-I(-/-) mice with this apoA-I mutant and either of the two mutant LCAT forms restored only partially the HDL biogenesis defect that was caused by the apoA-I[L159R]FIN and generated a distinct aberrant HDL phenotype. 
The cholesterol-esterifying enzyme, lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), is believed to play a key role in reverse cholesterol transport. However, recent investigations have demonstrated that higher LCAT activity levels increase the formation of triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) and atherogenesis. We hypothesized that higher LCAT activity measured as a serum cholesterol esterification rate by the endogenous substrate method might increase the formation of TRLs and thereby alter low-density lipoprotein (LDL) heterogeneity. The estimated LDL particle size [relative LDL migration (LDL-Rm)] was measured by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with the LipoPhor system (Joko, Tokyo, Japan) in 538 consecutive patients with at least risk factor for atherosclerosis. Multivariate regression analysis after adjustments for traditional risk factors identified elevated TRL-related marker (TG, remnant-like particle cholesterol, apolipoprotein C-II, and apolipoprotein C-III) levels as independent predictors of smaller-sized LDL particle size, both in the overall subject population and in the subset of patients with serum LDL cholesterol levels of &lt;100 mg/dL. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the LCAT activity (0.79; sensitivity 60 %; specificity 84.8 %) was observed for the evaluation of the indicators of an LDL-Rm value of ≥0.40, which suggests the presence of large amounts of small-dense LDL. The results lend support to the hypothesis that increased LCAT activity may be associated with increased formation of TRLs, leading to a reduction in LDL particle size. Therefore, to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, it may be of importance to pay attention not only to a quantitative change in the serum LDL-C, but also to the LCAT activity which is possibly associated with LDL heterogeneity. 
Lipid abnormalities may have an effect on clinical outcomes of patients on dialysis. Recent studies have indicated that HDL dysfunction is a hallmark of ESRD. In this study, we compared HDL composition and metrics of HDL functionality in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) with those in healthy controls. We detected a marked suppression of several metrics of HDL functionality in patients on HD or PD. Compositional analysis revealed that HDL from both dialysis groups shifted toward a more proinflammatory phenotype with profound alterations in the lipid moiety and protein composition. With regard to function, cholesterol efflux and anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic functions seemed to be more severely suppressed in patients on HD, whereas HDL-associated paraoxonase activity was lowest in patients on PD. Quantification of enzyme activities involved in HDL metabolism suggested that HDL particle maturation and remodeling are altered in patients on HD or PD. In summary, our study provides mechanistic insights into the formation of dysfunctional HDL in patients with ESRD who are on HD or PD. 
Construct interview that correctly identifies those with alcohol use disorder have limitation, especially when the subjects are motivated to minimize the magnitude of drinking behavior. Current laboratory tests to detect excessive alcohol consumption are limited by marginal sensitivity/specificity. Excessive drinking has been shown to affect several organ systems, which may be reflected in changes in quantity of plasma proteins. Our aim was to employ novel proteomic analyses to identify potential markers for excessive alcohol use.
A prospective case-control study included 49 controls and 54 excessive drinkers (discovery cohort). The serum proteomic analyses in these subjects were performed, and the results were tested in the verification cohort (40 controls and 40 excessive drinkers).
Using the appropriate cutoff and confirmation with ELISA, we identified 4 proteins which were significantly elevated in the serum of excessive drinkers: AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 4B (ARID4B), phosphatidylcholine-sterol acyltransferase (LCAT), hepatocyte growth factor-like protein (MST1), and ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARL6). The performance of the conventional markers (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase [GGT], percentage of carbohydrate-deficient transferrin [%CDT], and mean corpuscular volume [MCV]) discriminating between excessive alcohol use and controls had an area under the curve (AUC) ranging from 0.21 (ALT) to 0.67 (MCV). The AUC of these novel proteins showed the improvement in the detection of excessive drinkers compared to conventional laboratory tests, ranging from 0.73 (for ARID4B) to 0.86 (for ARL6).
We have identified 4 novel proteins that can discern subjects with excessive alcohol use. Further studies are needed to determine the clinical implications of these markers to detect excessive alcohol use and confirm abstinence.
LCAT is activated by apoA-I to form cholesteryl ester. We combined two structures, phospholipase A2 (PLA2) that hydrolyzes the ester bond at the sn-2 position of oxidized (short) acyl chains of phospholipid, and bacteriophage tubulin PhuZ, as C- and N-terminal templates, respectively, to create a novel homology model for human LCAT. The juxtaposition of multiple structural motifs matching experimental data is compelling evidence for the general correctness of many features of the model: i) The N-terminal 10 residues of the model, required for LCAT activity, extend the hydrophobic binding trough for the sn-2 chain 15-20 Å relative to PLA2. ii) The topography of the trough places the ester bond of the sn-2 chain less than 5 Å from the hydroxyl of the catalytic nucleophile, S181. iii) A β-hairpin resembling a lipase lid separates S181 from solvent. iv) S181 interacts with three functionally critical residues: E149, that regulates sn-2 chain specificity, and K128 and R147, whose mutations cause LCAT deficiency. Because the model provides a novel explanation for the complicated thermodynamic problem of the transfer of hydrophobic substrates from HDL to the catalytic triad of LCAT, it is an important step toward understanding the antiatherogenic role of HDL in reverse cholesterol transport. 
Plasma apolipoprotein (apo)D, a ubiquitously expressed protein that binds small hydrophobic ligands, is found mainly on HDL particles. According to studies of human genetics and lipid disorders, plasma apoD levels positively correlate with HDL-cholesterol and apoAI levels. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that apoD was a regulator of HDL metabolism.
We compared the plasma lipid and lipoprotein profiles of wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice with apoD-/- mice on a C57BL/6 background after receiving a high fat-high cholesterol diet for 12 weeks. ApoD-/- mice had higher HDL-cholesterol levels (61±13-apoD-/- vs. 52±10-WT-males; 37±11-apoD-/- vs. 22±2 WT-female) than WT mice with sex-specific changes in total plasma levels of cholesterol and other lipids. Compared to WT, the HDL of apoD-/- mice showed an increase in large, lipid-rich HDL particles and according to size various quantities and sizes of LDL particles. Plasma levels of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase in the control and apoD-/- mice were not different, however, plasma phospholipid transfer protein activity was modestly elevated (+10%) only in male apoD-/- mice. An in vivo HDL metabolism experiment with isolated Western-fed apoD-/- HDL particles showed that female apoD-/- mice had a 36% decrease in the fractional catabolic rate of HDL cholesteryl ester. Hepatic SR-BI and LDLR protein levels were significantly decreased; accordingly, LDL-cholesterol and apoB levels were increased in female mice.
In the context of a high fat-high cholesterol diet, apoD deficiency in female mice is associated with increases in both plasma HDL and LDL-cholesterol levels, reflecting changes in expression of SR-BI and LDL receptors, which may impact diet-induced atherosclerosis.
High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is considered to be an anti-atherogenic lipoprotein moiety. Generation of genetically modified (total body and tissue-specific knockout) mouse models has significantly contributed to our understanding of HDL function. Here we will review data from knockout mouse studies on the importance of HDL's major alipoprotein apoA-I, the ABC transporters A1 and G1, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase, phospholipid transfer protein, and scavenger receptor BI for HDL's metabolism and its protection against atherosclerosis in mice. The initial generation and maturation of HDL particles as well as the selective delivery of its cholesterol to the liver are essential parameters in the life cycle of HDL. Detrimental atherosclerosis effects observed in response to HDL deficiency in mice cannot be solely attributed to the low HDL levels per se, as the low HDL levels are in most models paralleled by changes in non-HDL-cholesterol levels. However, the cholesterol efflux function of HDL is of critical importance to overcome foam cell formation and the development of atherosclerotic lesions in mice. Although HDL is predominantly studied for its atheroprotective action, the mouse data also suggest an essential role for HDL as cholesterol donor for steroidogenic tissues, including the adrenals and ovaries. Furthermore, it appears that a relevant interaction exists between HDL-mediated cellular cholesterol efflux and the susceptibility to inflammation, which (1) provides strong support for the novel concept that inflammation and metabolism are intertwining biological processes and (2) identifies the efflux function of HDL as putative therapeutic target also in other inflammatory diseases than atherosclerosis. 
In this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Wang et al. (2018) identify a novel link between Lpcat3-mediated phospholipid remodeling (the Lands cycle) and cholesterol biosynthesis that modulates intestinal stem cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Notably, inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis dampens many of the Lpcat3-deficiency-mediated effects in the intestine.
The measurement of lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT, EC 2.3.1.43) activity is important in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism study and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment. However, current methods suffer from complex design and preparation of exogenous substrate, low reproducibility, and interference of cofactors. In this study, we developed a simple and precise high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for the measurement of LCAT activity. By using 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) and 1,2-didecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine(10:0PC) as substrates, and an LCAT activating peptide (P642) as activator and emulsifier, the substrate reagent was easily made by vortex. The substrate reagent was mixed with serum samples (50:1, v/v) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After incubation, the lipid was extracted with hexane and ethanol. With a conjugated double bond and ultraviolet absorption, 7-DHC and its esterification product could be separated and analyzed by a single HPLC run without calibration. LCAT activity was a linear function of the serum sample volume and the intra- and total assay coefficients of variation (CV) less than 2.5% were obtained under the standardized conditions. The substrate reagent was stable, and assay result accurately reflected LCAT activity. LCAT activities in 120 healthy subjects were positively correlated with triglyceride (P &lt; 0.05), fractional esterification rate of HDL cholesterol (FERHDL) (P &lt; 0.0001), and negatively correlated with apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) (P &lt; 0.05) and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) (P &lt; 0.001). These results suggest that this method is sensitive, reproducible, and not greatly influenced by serum components and added substances, and will be a useful tool in the lipid metabolism study and the risk assessment of CVD.
ApoA-I activates LCAT that converts lipoprotein cholesterol to cholesteryl ester (CE). Molecular dynamic simulations suggested earlier that helices 5 of two antiparallel apoA-I molecules on discoidal HDL form an amphipathic tunnel for migration of acyl chains and unesterified cholesterol to the active sites of LCAT. Our recent crystal structure of Δ(185-243)apoA-I showed the tunnel formed by helices 5/5, with two positively charged residues arginine 123 positioned at the edge of the hydrophobic tunnel. We hypothesized that these uniquely positioned residues Arg123 are poised for interaction with fatty acids produced by LCAT hydrolysis of the sn-2 chains of phosphatidylcholine, thus positioning the fatty acids for esterification to cholesterol. To test the importance of Arg123 for LCAT phospholipid hydrolysis and CE formation, we generated apoA-I[R123A] and apoA-I[R123E] mutants and made discoidal HDL with the mutants and WT apoA-I. Neither mutation of Arg123 changed the particle composition or size, or the protein conformation or stability. However, both mutations of Arg123 significantly reduced LCAT catalytic efficiency and the apparent Vmax for CE formation without affecting LCAT phospholipid hydrolysis. A control mutation, apoA-I[R131A], did not affect LCAT phospholipid hydrolysis or CE formation. These data suggest that Arg123 of apoA-I on discoidal HDL participates in LCAT-mediated cholesterol esterification.
Reverse cholesterol transport comprises cholesterol efflux from ABCA1-expressing macrophages to apolipoprotein (apo) AI, giving nascent high-density lipoprotein (nHDL), esterification of nHDL-free cholesterol (FC), selective hepatic extraction of HDL lipids, and hepatic conversion of HDL cholesterol to bile salts, which are excreted. We tested this model by identifying the fates of nHDL-[3H]FC, [14C] phospholipid (PL), and [125I]apo AI in serum in vitro and in vivo.
During in vitro incubation of human serum, nHDL-[3H]FC and [14C]PL rapidly transfer to HDL and low-density lipoproteins (t1/2=2-7 minutes), whereas nHDL-[125I]apo AI transfers solely to HDL (t1/2&lt;10 minutes) and to the lipid-free form (t1/2&gt;480 minutes). After injection into mice, nHDL-[3H]FC and [14C]PL rapidly transfer to liver (t1/2=≈2-3 minutes), whereas apo AI clears with t1/2=≈460 minutes. The plasma nHDL-[3H]FC esterification rate is slow (0.46%/h) compared with hepatic uptake. PL transfer protein enhances nHDL-[14C]PL but not nHDL-[3H]FC transfer to cultured Huh7 hepatocytes.
nHDL-FC, PL, and apo AI enter different pathways in vivo. Most nHDL-[3H]FC and [14C]PL are rapidly extracted by the liver via SR-B1 (scavenger receptor class B member 1) and spontaneous transfer; hepatic PL uptake is promoted by PL transfer protein. nHDL-[125I]apo AI transfers to HDL and to the lipid-free form that can be recycled to nHDL formation. Cholesterol esterification by lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase is a minor process in nHDL metabolism. These findings could guide the design of therapies that better mobilize peripheral tissue-FC to hepatic disposal.
Many intracellular pathogens subvert host membrane trafficking pathways to promote their replication. Toxoplasma multiplies in a membrane-bound parasitophorous vacuole (PV) that interacts with mammalian host organelles and intercepts Golgi Rab vesicles to acquire sphingolipids. The mechanisms of host vesicle internalization and processing within the PV remain undefined. We demonstrate that Toxoplasma sequesters a broad range of Rab vesicles into the PV. Correlative light and electron microscopy analysis of infected cells illustrates that intravacuolar Rab1A vesicles are surrounded by the PV membrane, suggesting a phagocytic-like process for vesicle engulfment. Rab11A vesicles concentrate to an intravacuolar network (IVN), but this is reduced in Δgra2 and Δgra2Δgra6 parasites, suggesting that tubules stabilized by the TgGRA2 and TgGRA6 proteins secreted by the parasite within the PV contribute to host vesicle sequestration. Overexpression of a phospholipase TgLCAT, which is localized to the IVN, results in a decrease in the number of intravacuolar GFP-Rab11A vesicles, suggesting that TgLCAT controls lipolytic degradation of Rab vesicles for cargo release.
Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) plays a key role in reverse cholesterol transport by transferring an acyl group from phosphatidylcholine to cholesterol, promoting the maturation of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) from discoidal to spherical particles. LCAT is activated through an unknown mechanism by apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and other mimetic peptides that form a belt around HDL. Here, we report the crystal structure of LCAT with an extended lid that blocks access to the active site, consistent with an inactive conformation. Residues Thr-123 and Phe-382 in the catalytic domain form a latch-like interaction with hydrophobic residues in the lid. Because these residues are mutated in genetic disease, lid displacement was hypothesized to be an important feature of apoA-I activation. Functional studies of site-directed mutants revealed that loss of latch interactions or the entire lid enhanced activity against soluble ester substrates, and hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry revealed that the LCAT lid is extremely dynamic in solution. Upon addition of a covalent inhibitor that mimics one of the reaction intermediates, there is an overall decrease in HDX in the lid and adjacent regions of the protein, consistent with ordering. These data suggest a model wherein the active site of LCAT is shielded from soluble substrates by a dynamic lid until it interacts with HDL to allow transesterification to proceed.
Low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). This study aimed to evaluate the effects of capsaicin intervention on the serum lipid profile in adults with low HDL-C. In a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial, 42 eligible subjects were randomly assigned to the capsaicin (n = 21, 4 mg of capsaicin daily) or to the control group (n = 21, 0.05 mg of capsaicin daily) and consumed two capsaicin or control capsules, which contained the powder of the skin of different peppers, twice daily for three months. Thirty-five subjects completed the trial (18 in the capsaicin group and 17 in the control group). The baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. Compared with the control group, fasting serum HDL-C levels significantly increased to 1.00 ± 0.13 mmol/L from 0.92 ± 0.13 mmol/L in the capsaicin group (p = 0.030), while levels of triglycerides and C-reactive protein and phospholipid transfer protein activity moderately decreased (all p &lt; 0.05). Other lipids, apolipoproteins, glucose, and other parameters did not significantly change. In conclusion, capsaicin improved risk factors of CHD in individuals with low HDL-C and may contribute to the prevention and treatment of CHD.
Background Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) is a plasma enzyme that esterifies cholesterol. Recombinant human LCAT (rhLCAT) is now being developed as an enzyme replacement therapy for familial LCAT deficiency and as a possible treatment for acute coronary syndrome. The current 'gold standard' assay for LCAT activity involves the use of radioisotopes, thus making it difficult for routine clinical use. Methods We have developed a novel and more convenient LCAT activity assay using fluorescence-labelled cholesterol (BODIPY-cholesterol), which is incorporated into proteoliposomes as a substrate instead of radiolabelled cholesterol. Results The apparent Km and Vmax were 31.5  µmol/L and 55.8 nmol/h/nmoL, rhLCAT, respectively, for the 3H-cholesterol method and 103.1  µmol/L and 13.4 nmol/h/nmol rhLCAT, respectively, for the BODIPY-cholesterol method. Although the two assays differed in their absolute units of LCAT activity, there was a good correlation between the two test assays ( r = 0.849, P &lt; 1.6 × 10-7, y = 0.1378x + 1.106). The BODIPY-cholesterol assay had an intra-assay CV of 13.7%, which was superior to the intra-assay CV of 20.8% for the radioisotopic assay. The proteoliposome substrate made with BODIPY-cholesterol was stable to storage for at least 10 months. The reference range ( n = 20) for the fluorescent LCAT activity assay was 4.6-24.1 U/mL/h in healthy subjects. Conclusions In summary, a novel fluorescent LCAT activity assay that utilizes BODIPY-cholesterol as a substrate is described that yields comparable results to the radioisotopic method.
Betaine has previously been demonstrated to protect the liver against alcohol‑induced fat accumulation. However, the mechanism through which betaine affects alcohol‑induced hepatic lipid metabolic disorders has not been extensively studied. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of betaine on alcoholic simple fatty liver and hepatic lipid metabolism disorders. A total of 36 rats were randomly divided into control, ethanol and ethanol + betaine groups. Liver function, morphological alterations, lipid content and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‑α levels were determined. Hepatic expression levels of diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) 1, DGAT2, sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)‑1c, SREBP‑2, fatty acid synthase (FAS), 3‑hydroxy‑3‑methyl‑glutaryl (HMG)‑CoA reductase, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor λ coactivator (PGC)‑1α, adiponectin receptor (AdipoR) 1 and AdipoR2 were quantified. Serum and adipose tissue adiponectin levels were assessed using an enzyme‑linked immunoassay. The results demonstrated that alcohol‑induced ultramicrostructural alterations in hepatocytes, including the presence of lipid droplets and swollen mitochondria, were attenuated by betaine. Hepatic triglyceride, free fatty acid, total cholesterol and cholesterol ester contents and the expression of DGAT1, DGAT2, SREBP‑1c, SREBP‑2, FAS and HMG‑CoA reductase were increased following ethanol consumption, however were maintained at control levels following betaine supplementation. Alcohol‑induced decreases in hepatic PGC‑1α mRNA levels and serum and adipose tissue adiponectin concentrations were prevented by betaine. The downregulation of hepatic AdipoR1 which resulted from alcohol exposure was partially attenuated by betaine. No significant differences in liver function, TNF‑α, phospholipid and AdipoR2 levels were observed among the control, ethanol and ethanol + betaine groups. Overall, these results indicated that betaine attenuated the alcoholic simple fatty liver by improving hepatic lipid metabolism via suppression of DGAT1, DGAT2, SREBP‑1c, FAS, SREBP‑2 and HMG‑CoA reductase and upregulation of PGC‑1α.
Thymoquinone (TQ), has been reported to possess strong antihyperlipidemic properties. However, a variety of serious side effects has been reported for TQ. The present study aimed to evaluate the potential antihyperlipidemic activity of newly synthesized TQ analogs.
first, novel TQ derivatives were studied against radiation-induced dyslipidemia in male rats. Second, the most promising sulfur derivatives (4-7), were further tested to elucidate their possible mechanism(s) of actions. Results showed that they possess Hydroxymethyl Glutaryl-Co A reductase inhibitory activity, as well as stimulatory effects on the activities of each of plasma Lecithin-Cholesterol Acyltransferase and lipoprotein lipase enzymes.
TQ derivatives (4-7), could be considered as promising agents in pathologies implicating impaired lipid metabolism, preclinical evaluation is warranted. [Formula: see text].
A key to effective treatment of cardiovascular disease is to understand the body's complex lipoprotein transport system. Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) is the process of cholesterol movement from the extrahepatic tissues back to the liver. Lipoproteins containing apoA-I [highdensity lipoprotein (HDL)] are key mediators in RCT, whereas non-high-density lipoproteins (non-HDL, lipoproteins containing apoB) are involved in the lipid delivery pathway. HDL particles are heterogeneous; they differ in proportion of proteins and lipids, size, shape, and charge. HDL heterogeneity is the result of the activity of several factors that assemble and remodel HDL particles in plasma: ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), hepatic lipase (HL), phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP), endothelial lipase (EL), and scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI). The RCT pathway consists of the following steps: 1. Cholesterol efflux from peripheral tissues to plasma, 2. LCAT-mediated esterification of cholesterol and remodeling of HDL particles, 3. direct pathway of HDL cholesterol delivery to the liver, and 4. indirect pathway of HDL cholesterol delivery to the liver via CETP-mediated transfer There are several established strategies for raising HDL cholesterol in humans, such as lifestyle changes; use of drugs including fibrates, statins, and niacin; and new therapeutic approaches. The therapeutic approaches include CETP inhibition, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists, synthetic farnesoid X receptor agonists, and gene therapy. Results of clinical trials should be awaited before further clinical management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
Pharmacological interventions to increase the concentration of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) have led to disappointing results and have contributed to the emergence of the concept of HDL functionality. The anti-atherogenic activity of HDLs can be explained by their functionality or quality. The capacity of HDLs to maintain cellular cholesterol homeostasis and to transport cholesterol from peripheral cells to the liver for elimination is one of their principal anti-atherogenic activities. However, HDLs possess several other attributes that contribute to their protective effect against cardiovascular diseases. HDL functionality is regulated by various proteins and lipids making up HDL particles. However, several studies investigated the role of paraoxonase 1 (PON1) and suggest a significant role of this protein in the regulation of the functionality of HDLs. Moreover, research on PON1 attracted much interest following several studies indicating that it is involved in cardiovascular protection. However, the mechanisms by which PON1 exerts these effects remain to be elucidated.
There is an urgent need for biomarkers for the early detection of ovarian cancer (OC). The purpose of this study was to assess whether changes in serum levels of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), glucose-regulated protein, 78 kDa (GRP78), calprotectin and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) are observed before clinical presentation and to assess the performance of these markers alone and in combination with CA125 for early detection.
This nested case-control study used samples from the United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening trial. The sample set consisted of 482 serum samples from 49 OC subjects and 31 controls, with serial samples spanning up to 7 years pre-diagnosis. The set was divided into the following: (I) a discovery set, which included all women with only two samples from each woman, the first at&lt;14 months and the second at &gt;32 months to diagnosis; and (ii) a corroboration set, which included all the serial samples from the same women spanning the 7-year period. Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase, SHBG, GRP78, calprotectin and IGFBP2 were measured using ELISA. The performance of the markers to detect cancers pre-diagnosis was assessed.
A combined threshold model IGFBP2 &gt;78.5 ng ml-1 : LCAT &lt;8.831 μg ml-1 : CA125 &gt;35 U ml-1 outperformed CA125 alone for the earlier detection of OC. The threshold model was able to identify the most aggressive Type II cancers. In addition, it increased the lead time by 5-6 months and identified 26% of Type I subjects and 13% of Type II subjects that were not identified by CA125 alone.
Combined biomarker panels (IGFBP2, LCAT and CA125) outperformed CA125 up to 3 years pre-diagnosis, identifying cancers missed by CA125, providing increased diagnostic lead times for Type I and Type II OC. The model identified more aggressive Type II cancers, with women crossing the threshold dying earlier, indicating that these markers can improve on the sensitivity of CA125 alone for the early detection of OC.
Persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have an elevated risk of atherosclerosis. High-density lipoproteins (HDL) normally protect against cardiovascular disease (CVD), but this may be attenuated by serum amyloid A (SAA). In a case-control study of young females, blood samples were compared between subjects with T2DM (n = 42) and individuals without T2DM (n = 42). SAA and apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) concentrations, paraoxonase-1 (PON-1), cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activities were measured in the serum and/or HDL2 and HDL3 subfractions. SAA concentrations were higher in T2DM compared to controls: serum (30 mg/L (17, 68) versus 15 mg/L (7, 36); p = 0.002), HDL2 (1.0 mg/L (0.6, 2.2) versus 0.4 mg/L (0.2, 0.7); p &lt; 0.001), and HDL3, (13 mg/L (8, 29) versus 6 mg/L (3, 13); p &lt; 0.001). Serum-PON-1 activity was lower in T2DM compared to that in controls (38,245 U/L (7025) versus 41,109 U/L (5690); p = 0.043). CETP activity was higher in T2DM versus controls in HDL2 (232.6 μmol/L (14.1) versus 217.1 μmol/L (25.1); p = 0.001) and HDL3 (279.5 μmol/L (17.7) versus 245.2 μmol/L (41.2); p &lt; 0.001). These results suggest that individuals with T2DM have increased SAA-related inflammation and dysfunctional HDL features. SAA may prove to be a useful biomarker in T2DM given its association with elevated CVD risk.
Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) catalyzes plasma cholesteryl ester formation and is defective in familial lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency (FLD), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by low high-density lipoprotein, anemia, and renal disease. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism by which compound A [3-(5-(ethylthio)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-ylthio)pyrazine-2-carbonitrile], a small heterocyclic amine, activates LCAT. The effect of compound A on LCAT was tested in human plasma and with recombinant LCAT. Mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance were used to determine compound A adduct formation with LCAT. Molecular modeling was performed to gain insight into the effects of compound A on LCAT structure and activity. Compound A increased LCAT activity in a subset (three of nine) of LCAT mutations to levels comparable to FLD heterozygotes. The site-directed mutation LCAT-Cys31Gly prevented activation by compound A. Substitution of Cys31 with charged residues (Glu, Arg, and Lys) decreased LCAT activity, whereas bulky hydrophobic groups (Trp, Leu, Phe, and Met) increased activity up to 3-fold (P &lt; 0.005). Mass spectrometry of a tryptic digestion of LCAT incubated with compound A revealed a +103.017 m/z adduct on Cys31, consistent with the addition of a single hydrophobic cyanopyrazine ring. Molecular modeling identified potential interactions of compound A near Cys31 and structural changes correlating with enhanced activity. Functional groups important for LCAT activation by compound A were identified by testing compound A derivatives. Finally, sulfhydryl-reactive β-lactams were developed as a new class of LCAT activators. In conclusion, compound A activates LCAT, including some FLD mutations, by forming a hydrophobic adduct with Cys31, thus providing a mechanistic rationale for the design of future LCAT activators.
People may have different responses to the same environmental changes. It has been reported that genome variations may be responsible for these differences. Also, HDL subfractions may be influenced by different genetic variations. The aim of the present study was to determine gene-diet interactions and to evaluate the influence of weight loss on HDL subfractions between two genotypes of -265 T&gt;C APOA-II polymorphism.
In the present study, 56 overweight and obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were selected from 697 genotype-specified subjects. After matching for gender, age and BMI at the beginning of the study, an equal number of patients remained on each genotype of APOA-II (TT/TC and CC group). After a 6-week calorie restriction program, 44 patients completed the study. Serum HDL subfractions, including HDL2 and HDL3 and LCAT activity, were compared between the two genotypes and, before and after the intervention, were separated in each genotype.
Serum concentration of HDL and its subfractions decreased significantly due to the weight loss. A comparison of the mean changes between the genotypes showed that HDL3 significantly decreased in the CC genotype while, in the TT/TC group, the serum concentration of HDL2 was significantly reduced. However, the increase of LCAT activity was not significant among the two genotypes.
A comparison of mean changes of variables within two genotype groups showed that C homozygote carriers lead to a general shift toward larger size HDL subfractions and T allele carriers shift toward smaller size HDL subfractions after weight loss.
Xanthohumol, a prominent prenyl flavonoid from the hop plant (Humulus lupulus L.), is suggested to be antiatherogenic since it reportedly increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. It is not clear whether xanthohumol promotes reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), the most important antiatherogenic property of HDL; therefore, we investigated the effects of xanthohumol on macrophage-to-feces RCT using a hamster model as a CETP-expressing species. In vivo RCT experiments showed that xanthohumol significantly increased fecal appearance of the tracer derived from intraperitoneally injected [3H]-cholesterol-labeled macrophages. Ex vivo experiments were then employed to investigate the detailed mechanism by which xanthohumol enhanced RCT. Cholesterol efflux capacity from macrophages was 1.5-fold higher in xanthohumol-fed hamsters compared with the control group. In addition, protein expression and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase activity in the HDL fraction were significantly higher in xanthohumol-fed hamsters compared with the control, suggesting that xanthohumol promoted HDL maturation. Hepatic transcript analysis revealed that xanthohumol increased mRNA expression of abcg8 and cyp7a1. In addition, protein expressions of liver X receptor α and bile pump export protein were increased in the liver by xanthohumol administration when compared with the control, implying that it stimulated bile acid synthesis and cholesterol excretion to feces. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that xanthohumol improves RCT in vivo through cholesterol efflux from macrophages and excretion to feces, leading to antiatherosclerosis effects. It remains to be elucidated whether enhancement of RCT by xanthohumol could prove valuable in humans.
The atherogenic impact and functional capacity of LCAT was studied and discussed over a half century. This review aims to clarify the key points that may affect the final decision on whether LCAT is an anti-atherogenic or atherogenic factor. There are three main processes involving the efflux of free cholesterol from peripheral cells, LCAT action in intravascular pool where cholesterol esterification rate is under the control of HDL, LDL and VLDL subpopulations, and finally the destination of newly produced cholesteryl esters either to the catabolism in liver or to a futile cycle with apoB lipoproteins. The functionality of LCAT substantially depends on its mass together with the composition of the phospholipid bilayer as well as the saturation and the length of fatty acyls and other effectors about which we know yet nothing. Over the years, LCAT puzzle has been significantly supplemented but yet not so satisfactory as to enable how to manipulate LCAT in order to prevent cardiometabolic events. It reminds the butterfly effect when only a moderate change in the process of transformation free cholesterol to cholesteryl esters may cause a crucial turn in the intended target. On the other hand, two biomarkers - FER(HDL) (fractional esterification rate in HDL) and AIP [log(TG/HDL-C)] can offer a benefit to identify the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). They both reflect the rate of cholesterol esterification by LCAT and the composition of lipoprotein subpopulations that controls this rate. In clinical practice, AIP can be calculated from the routine lipid profile with help of AIP calculator www.biomed.cas.cz/fgu/aip/calculator.php.
The ultimate aim of this present study was to investigate the antihyperlipidemic and antiapoptotic potential of zingerone (ZO) on alcohol induced hepatotoxicity in experimental rats. Male albino wistar rats were divided in four groups. Groups 1 and 2 rats received isocaloric glucose and dimethyl sulphoxide (2% DMSO), liver toxicity was induced in groups 3 and 4 by supplementing 30% ethanol post orally for 60 days. In addition to, groups 2 and 4 received zingerone (20 mg/kg body weight in 2% DMSO) daily during the final 30 days of the experimental period. Ethanol alone administered rats showed increased levels/activities of plasma total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), free fatty acids (FFA), phospholipids (PL), low density lipoproteins (LDL), very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), tissue TC, TG, FFA, PL, HMG-CoA reductase, phase I xenobiotic enzymes, collagen and fat accumulation, DNA damage and increased Bax, caspase-3 and caspase-9 expressions and decrease in the levels/activities of plasma high density lipoproteins (HDL), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT), phase II xenobiotic enzymes and a decreased Bcl-2 expression. Zingerone supplementation was able to counter and reverse the ethanol induced changes in all the above parameters in experimental rats. Together results portray zingerone exhibits antihyperlipidemic and antiapoptotic potential on alcohol induced hepatotoxicity.
Previous studies have demonstrated that hemoglobin-haptoglobin (Hb-Hp) complex plays a role in developing vascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The complexes bind with Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), affecting the function of Lecithin:Cholesterol Acyltransferase (LCAT), and impairing the reverse cholesterol transport mechanism (RCT). This study investigated the influence of Hp phenotypes on serum levels of ApoA1 and LCAT in patients with T2DM.
The study comprised 131 T2DM patients and 111 matching healthy controls. Fasting blood glucose, HbA1C, and lipid profile were determined by chemistry autoanalyzer, LCAT and ApoA1 by ELISA, and Hp phenotypes by gel electrophoresis.
Irrespective of Hp phenotypes, fasting blood glucose, HbA1C, and lipid profile were significantly higher in patients than in controls, while HDL-cholesterol, ApoA1, and LCAT were lower. ApoA1 correlated positively with LCAT (r=0.223, p=0.024) and HDL-cholesterol (r=0.255, 0.003) in patients only. When Hp polymorphism was taken into account, the levels of LCAT and ApoA1 were significantly lower in patients with Hp2-2 than that in patients of Hp1-1 and/or Hp2-1. Correlations between ApoA1 and each of HDL-cholesterol and LCAT (r=0.239, p=0.046, and r=0.252, p=0.040, respectively) were also observed, but only in patients with Hp2-2 phenotype.
The reduced levels of LCAT and ApoA1 observed in this study support the suggestion that T2DM patients with Hp2-2 phenotype could have altered RCT mechanism and increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease.
Preβ1-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) is an efficient acceptor of cell-derived free cholesterol, which is converted into lipid-rich HDL by lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase. Previous studies have shown that preβ1-HDL is significantly higher in individuals with hyperlipidemia. Preβ1-HDL concentrations may be altered in smokers, who are at high risk for atherosclerosis.
The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of smoking on preβ1-HDL concentrations.
We measured the preβ1-HDL concentration and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase-dependent conversion rate (CHTpreβ1) in 74 men (39 nonsmokers and 35 smokers) using an immunoassay.
The smoker and nonsmoker groups were further divided into normolipidemic and hyperlipidemic subjects. Among nonsmokers, the mean preβ1-HDL concentration was 27% higher in hyperlipidemics than in normolipidemics (25.5 ± 6.7 vs 20.3 ± 4.6 mg/L apoAI, P &lt; .01). In contrast, mean preβ1-HDL concentrations did not differ between hyperlipidemic and normolipidemic smokers (19.9 ± 3.1 vs 22.4 ± 6.9 mg/L apoAI). We found a positive correlation between preβ1-HDL concentration and CHTpreβ1 in nonsmokers, but not in smokers. Smoking a single cigarette did not change preβ1-HDL concentrations or CHTpreβ1. Compared with nonsmokers, preβ1-HDL concentrations were relatively low in hyperlipidemic smokers but not in normolipidemic smokers, and CHTpreβ1 was not a significant determinant of preβ1-HDL concentrations in smokers.
Our findings suggest that smoking may be disadvantageous to individuals with hyperlipidemia because preβ1-HDL metabolism is altered.
Hepatic scavenger receptor class B1 (SR-B1), a high-density lipoprotein (HDL) receptor, is involved in the selective uptake of HDL-associated esterified cholesterol (EC), thereby regulates cholesterol homoeostasis and improves reverse cholesterol transport. Previously, we reported in euglycaemic obese rats (WNIN/Ob strain) that feeding of vitamin A-enriched diet normalized hypercholesterolaemia, possibly through hepatic SR-B1-mediated pathway. This study was aimed to test whether it would be possible to normalize hypercholesterolaemia in glucose-intolerant obese rat model (WNIN/GR/Ob) through similar mechanism by feeding identical vitamin A-enriched diet.
In this study, 30 wk old male lean and obese rats of WNIN/GR-Ob strain were divided into two groups and received either stock diet or vitamin A-enriched diet (2.6 mg or 129 mg vitamin A/kg diet) for 14 wk. Blood and other tissues were collected for various biochemical analyses.
Chronic vitamin A-enriched diet feeding decreased hypercholesterolaemia and normalized abnormally elevated plasma HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels in obese rats as compared to stock diet-fed obese groups. Further, decreased free cholesterol (FC) and increased esterified cholesterol (EC) contents of plasma cholesterol were observed, which were reflected in higher EC to FC ratio of vitamin A-enriched diet-fed obese rats. However, neither lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity of plasma nor its expression (both gene and protein) in the liver were altered. On the contrary, hepatic cholesterol levels significantly increased in vitamin A-enriched diet fed obese rats. Hepatic SR-B1 expression (both mRNA and protein) remained unaltered among groups. Vitamin A-enriched diet fed obese rats showed a significant increase in hepatic low-density lipoprotein receptor mRNA levels, while the expression of genes involved in HDL synthesis, namely, ATP-binding cassette protein 1 (ABCA1) and apolipoprotein A-I, were downregulated. No such response was seen in vitamin A-supplemented lean rats as compared with their stock diet-fed lean counterparts.
Chronic vitamin A-enriched diet feeding decreased hypercholesterolaemia and normalized HDL-C levels, possibly by regulating pathways involved in HDL synthesis and degradation, independent of hepatic SR-B1 in this glucose-intolerant obese rat model.
Intermittent hypoxic training (IHT) is a discrete cost-effective method for improving athletic performance and high altitude acclimatization. Unfortunately, IHT protocols widely vary in terms of hypoxia severity, duration, and number of cycles affecting physiological outcomes. In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of a moderate normobaric IHT protocol (12% FiO2 for 4 h, 4 days) on acclimatization to high altitude (3250 m). Global plasma proteomics studies revealed that IHT elicited acute-phase response proteins like C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A-1 protein (SAA), and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 2 (AGP 2) as well as altered levels of several apolipoproteins. On subsequent exposure to high altitude, the IH trained volunteers exhibited significant higher arterial oxygen saturation with concomitant lower incidences of acute mountain sickness (AMS) as compared to controls. Interestingly, IH trained subjects exhibited lower levels of positive acute-phase proteins like C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A-1 protein (SAA), and fibrinogen (FGA, FGB, and FGG) both after days 4 and 7 of high altitude ascent. High altitude exposure also decreased the levels of HDL, LDL, and associated proteins as well as key enzymes for assembly and maturation of lipoprotein particles like lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), and phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP). In contrast, IHT curtailed hypoxia-induced alterations of HDL, LDL, Apo-AI, Apo-B, LCAT, CETP, and PLTP. Further validation of results also corroborated attenuation of hypoxia-induced inflammation and dyslipidemia by IHT. These results provide molecular evidences supporting the use of moderate IHT as a potential non-pharmacological strategy for high altitude acclimatization.
Objective- Aim of this study was to evaluate changes in LCAT (lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase) concentration and activity in patients with an acute coronary syndrome, to investigate if these changes are related to the compromised capacity of HDL (high-density lipoprotein) to promote endothelial nitric oxide (NO) production, and to assess if rhLCAT (recombinant human LCAT) can rescue the defective vasoprotective HDL function. Approach and Results- Thirty ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients were enrolled, and plasma was collected at hospital admission, 48 and 72 hours thereafter, at hospital discharge, and at 30-day follow-up. Plasma LCAT concentration and activity were measured and related to the capacity of HDL to promote NO production in cultured endothelial cells. In vitro studies were performed in which STEMI patients' plasma was added with rhLCAT and HDL vasoprotective activity assessed by measuring NO production in endothelial cells. The plasma concentration of the LCAT enzyme significantly decreases during STEMI with a parallel significant reduction in LCAT activity. HDL isolated from STEMI patients progressively lose the capacity to promote NO production by endothelial cells, and the reduction is related to decreased LCAT concentration. In vitro incubation of STEMI patients' plasma with rhLCAT restores HDL ability to promote endothelial NO production, possibly related to significant modification in HDL phospholipid classes. Conclusions- Impairment of cholesterol esterification may be a major factor in the HDL dysfunction observed during acute coronary syndrome. rhLCAT is able to restore HDL-mediated NO production in vitro, suggesting LCAT as potential therapeutic target for restoring HDL functionality in acute coronary syndrome.
Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (ACSL4) has a unique substrate specificity for arachidonic acid. Hepatic ACSL4 is coregulated with the phospholipid (PL)-remodeling enzyme lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) acyltransferase 3 by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ to modulate the plasma triglyceride (TG) metabolism. In this study, we investigated the acute effects of hepatic ACSL4 deficiency on lipid metabolism in adult mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Adenovirus-mediated expression of a mouse ACSL4 shRNA (Ad-shAcsl4) in the liver of HFD-fed mice led to a 43% reduction of hepatic arachidonoyl-CoA synthetase activity and a 53% decrease in ACSL4 protein levels compared with mice receiving control adenovirus (Ad-shLacZ). Attenuated ACSL4 expression resulted in a substantial decrease in circulating VLDL-TG levels without affecting plasma cholesterol. Lipidomics profiling revealed that knocking down ACSL4 altered liver PL compositions, with the greatest impact on accumulation of abundant LPC species (LPC 16:0 and LPC 18:0) and lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) species (LPE 16:0 and LPE 18:0). In addition, fasting glucose and insulin levels were higher in Ad-shAcsl4-transduced mice versus control (Ad-shLacZ). Glucose tolerance testing further indicated an insulin-resistant phenotype upon knockdown of ACSL4. These results provide the first in vivo evidence that ACSL4 plays a role in plasma TG and glucose metabolism and hepatic PL synthesis of hyperlipidemic mice.
The digestion of choline phospholipids is important for choline homeostasis, lipid signaling, postprandial lipid and energy metabolism, and interaction with intestinal bacteria. The digestion is mediated by the combined action of pancreatic and mucosal enzymes. In the proximal small intestine, hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) to 1-lyso-PC and free fatty acid (FFA) by the pancreatic phospholipase A2 IB coincides with the digestion of the dietary triacylglycerols by lipases, but part of the PC digestion is extended and must be mediated by other enzymes as the jejunoileal brush-border phospholipase B/lipase and mucosal secreted phospholipase A2 X. Absorbed 1-lyso-PC is partitioned in the mucosal cells between degradation and reacylation into chyle PC. Reutilization of choline for hepatic bile PC synthesis, and the reacylation of 1-lyso-PC into chylomicron PC by the lyso-PC-acyl-CoA-acyltransferase 3 are important features of choline recycling and postprandial lipid metabolism. The role of mucosal enzymes is emphasized by sphingomyelin (SM) being sequentially hydrolyzed by brush-border alkaline sphingomyelinase (alk-SMase) and neutral ceramidase to sphingosine and FFA, which are well absorbed. Ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate are generated and are both metabolic intermediates and important lipid messengers. Alk-SMase has anti-inflammatory effects that counteract gut inflammation and tumorigenesis. These may be mediated by multiple mechanisms including generation of sphingolipid metabolites and suppression of autotaxin induction and lyso-phosphatidic acid formation. Here we summarize current knowledge on the roles of pancreatic and mucosal enzymes in PC and SM digestion, and its implications in intestinal and liver diseases, bacterial choline metabolism in the gut, and cholesterol absorption.
To review the formation, catabolism, and the possible atherogenic properties of Lp-X.
The conversion of cholesterol to bile acids is regulated by several mechanisms including cholesterol 7 alpha hydroxylase, fibroblast growth factor 19, and farnesoid X receptors. During cholestasis these mechanisms are altered and there is an accumulation of bile acids and cholesterol in plasma. The hypercholesterolemia observed in cholestasis is due to the presence of an anomalous lipoprotein called lipoprotein-X (Lp-X). Lp-X is a lipoprotein rich in phospholipid and free cholesterol present in plasma of patients with cholestasis and, with some variations, in patients with lecithin-cholesterol-acyl-transferase deficiency (LCAT), and after lipid infusion. Lp-X is formed from a bile lipoprotein moving to the blood vessels where it incorporates small quantities of triglycerides, apo-C and esterified cholesterol and becomes a "mature" Lp-X. The activity of the phosphatidilcholine canalicular transporter Mdr2 P-glycoprotein (homologous to the human ABCB4) is essential for LpX appearance, since its suppression abolishes Lp-X formation. However, the concentration of Lp-X in plasma is determined also by the degree of the cholestasis, the residual liver function, and the LCAT deficiency. The Lp-X catabolism seems to be mediated by the reticuloendothelial system and possibly the kidney.
Lp-X might be considered a defense mechanism against the toxic effect of free cholesterol in cholestasis. The frequency of cardiovascular events in patients affected by primary biliary cholangitis, in whom the Lp-X is present in high concentration, are not increased. Further studies could now clarify the remaining open questions on the role of Lp-X in the dyslipidemia of cholestasis.
Previous studies revealed decreased level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) as important factor for development of colorectal cancer (CRC). Quantity and structure of HDL particles depend on activities of lipid transfer proteins lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), but this topic is largely unexplored in CRC. The main objective of this study was to investigate activities of LCAT and CETP in patients with CRC. Additionally, we analyzed activity of paraoxonase-1 (PON-1), as a main carrier of HDL-antioxidant function.
Ninety-nine CRC patients and 101 healthy individuals were included. LCAT and CETP activities were assessed by measuring rates of formation and transfer of cholesteryl esters. PON-1 paraoxonase and arylesterase activities were measured.
Lower levels of HDL-C (p &lt; .001) were observed in cohort of patients, alongside with decreased LCAT (p &lt; .050) and increased CETP activity (p &lt; .050). Both PON-1 activities were diminished in CRC (p &lt; .050 and p &lt; .001 respectively). Univariate logistic regression singled out HDL-C level (OR = 0.218, p &lt; .001), CETP activity (OR = 1.010, p &lt; .01) and mass (OR = 0.994, p &lt; .001) as possible markers of elevated CRC risk. CETP mass maintained its predictive significance when adjusted for traditional risk factors and level of oxidative stress (OR = 0.993, p &lt; .001; OR = 0.982, p &lt; .050, respectively).
Our results demonstrated increased CETP and decreased LCAT and PON-1 activities in CRC patients. In preliminary analysis CETP mass was identified as potential significant predictor of CRC development, suggesting that alterations in HDL-C levels, alongside with changes in HDL structure might have a role in carcinogenesis.
Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) and LCAT-activating compounds are being investigated as treatments for coronary heart disease (CHD) and familial LCAT deficiency (FLD). Herein we report the crystal structure of human LCAT in complex with a potent piperidinylpyrazolopyridine activator and an acyl intermediate-like inhibitor, revealing LCAT in an active conformation. Unlike other LCAT activators, the piperidinylpyrazolopyridine activator binds exclusively to the membrane-binding domain (MBD). Functional studies indicate that the compound does not modulate the affinity of LCAT for HDL, but instead stabilizes residues in the MBD and facilitates channeling of substrates into the active site. By demonstrating that these activators increase the activity of an FLD variant, we show that compounds targeting the MBD have therapeutic potential. Our data better define the substrate binding site of LCAT and pave the way for rational design of LCAT agonists and improved biotherapeutics for augmenting or restoring reverse cholesterol transport in CHD and FLD patients.
SND1 is a putative oncoprotein whose molecular function remains unclear. Its overexpression in hepatocellular carcinoma impairs cholesterol homeostasis due to the altered activation of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) 2, which results in the accumulation of cellular cholesteryl esters (CE). In this work, we explored whether high cholesterol synthesis and esterification originates changes in glycerolipid metabolism that might affect cell growth, given that acetyl-coenzyme A is required for cholesterogenesis and fatty acids (FA) are the substrates of acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT). SND1-overexpressing hepatoma cells show low triglyceride (TG) synthesis, but phospholipid biosynthesis or cell growth is not affected. Limited TG synthesis is not due to low acetyl-coenzyme A or NADPH availability. We demonstrate that the main factor limiting TG synthesis is the utilization of FAs for cholesterol esterification. These metabolic adaptations are linked to high Scd1 expression, needed for the de novo production of oleic acid, the main FA used by ACAT. We conclude that high cholesterogenesis due to SND1 overexpression might determine the channeling of FAs to CEs.
To present ocular findings and anterior segment-optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) imaging findings of 2 cases of fish-eye disease (FED) involving 2 novel genetic variants of the lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) gene.
A case report.
A 46-year-old woman and 63-year-old man presented with blurred vision, burning sensation, and whitening of both eyes for 2 and 3 years, respectively. Ophthalmologic examination revealed slightly decreased visual acuity, yellowish-white diffuse corneal opacities causing corneal clouding, and dry eye disease bilaterally in both patients. AS-OCT imaging demonstrated diffuse hyperreflective corneal opacities predominantly located in the anterior stroma. On systemic examination, both patients had very low plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. However, they did not have any systemic associations with familial LCAT deficiency or Tangier disease, which are differential diagnoses for corneal clouding and low plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Both patients were diagnosed with FED based on clinical findings. Furthermore, genetic analysis, in which novel variants of c.86A&gt;G (p.Asn29Ser) in the first exon and c.1052A&gt;G (p.Tyr351Cys) in the sixth exon on the LCAT gene were detected, confirmed the diagnosis.
Although it is a rare genetic disorder, FED should be considered in the differential diagnosis of corneal clouding. Corneal lipid deposits, visible on AS-OCT are suggestive of FED, and genetic analysis can be used to confirm the clinical diagnosis. Finally, there may be a relationship between dry eye disease and LCAT enzyme deficiency disorders, which should be investigated in further studies.
Phospholipids are major constituents of biological membranes. The fatty acyl chain composition of phospholipids determines the biophysical properties of membranes and thereby affects their impact on biological processes. The composition of fatty acyl chains is also actively regulated through a deacylation and reacylation pathway called Lands' cycle. Recent studies of mouse genetic models have demonstrated that lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferases (LPCATs), which catalyze the incorporation of fatty acyl chains into the sn-2 site of phosphatidylcholine, play important roles in pathophysiology. Two LPCAT family members, LPCAT1 and LPCAT3, have been particularly well studied. LPCAT1 is crucial for proper lung function due to its role in pulmonary surfactant biosynthesis. LPCAT3 maintains systemic lipid homeostasis by regulating lipid absorption in intestine, lipoprotein secretion, and de novo lipogenesis in liver. Mounting evidence also suggests that changes in LPCAT activity may be potentially involved in pathological conditions, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, atherosclerosis, viral infections, and cancer. Pharmacological manipulation of LPCAT activity and membrane phospholipid composition may provide new therapeutic options for these conditions.
Heart failure (HF) courses with chronic inflammatory process and alterations in lipid metabolism may aggravate the disease. The aim was to test whether the severity of HF, using brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) as a marker, is associated with alterations in functional aspects of HDL, such as lipid transfer, cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) concentration.
Twenty-five HF patients in NYHA class I/II and 23 in class III/IV were enrolled. Plasma lipids, apolipoproteins, CETP, LCAT, oxidized-LDL (oxLDL) and paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) activity were determined. Lipid transfer from a donor artificial nanoparticle to HDL was measured by in vitro assay.
Total cholesterol (p = 0.049), LDL-C (p = 0.023), non-HDL-C (p = 0.029) and CETP, that promotes lipid transfer among lipoproteins (p = 0.013), were lower in III/IV than in I/II group. Triglycerides, HDL-C, apo A-I, apo B, oxLDL, LCAT, enzyme that catalyzes serum cholesterol esterification, PON-1 activity, and in vitro transfers of cholesterol, triglycerides and phospholipids to HDL, important steps in HDL metabolism, were equal. IL-8 was higher in III/IV (p = 0.025), but TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6 and MCP-1 were equal. BNP was negatively correlated with CETP (r = - 0.294; p = 0.042) and positively correlated with IL-8 (r = 0.299; p = 0.039).
Our results disclosed the relationship between CETP levels and HF severity, by comparing two HF groups and by correlation analysis. Lower CETP levels may be a marker of HF aggravation and possibly of worse prognosis. Practical applications of this initial finding, as the issue whether CETP could be protective against HF aggravation, should be explored in larger experimental and clinical studies.
Membrane-bound O-acyltransferases (MBOATs) are a superfamily of integral transmembrane enzymes that are found in all kingdoms of life1. In bacteria, MBOATs modify protective cell-surface polymers. In vertebrates, some MBOAT enzymes-such as acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1-are responsible for lipid biosynthesis or phospholipid remodelling2,3. Other MBOATs, including porcupine, hedgehog acyltransferase and ghrelin acyltransferase, catalyse essential lipid modifications of secreted proteins such as Wnt, hedgehog and ghrelin, respectively4-10. Although many MBOAT proteins are important drug targets, little is known about their molecular architecture and functional mechanisms. Here we present crystal structures of DltB, an MBOAT responsible for the D-alanylation of cell-wall teichoic acid in Gram-positive bacteria11-16, both alone and in complex with the D-alanyl donor protein DltC. DltB contains a ring of 11 peripheral transmembrane helices, which shield a highly conserved extracellular structural funnel extending into the middle of the lipid bilayer. The conserved catalytic histidine residue is located at the bottom of this funnel and is connected to the intracellular DltC through a narrow tunnel. Mutation of either the catalytic histidine or the DltC-binding site of DltB abolishes the D-alanylation of lipoteichoic acid and sensitizes the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis to cell-wall stress, which suggests cross-membrane catalysis involving the tunnel. Structure-guided sequence comparison among DltB and vertebrate MBOATs reveals a conserved structural core and suggests that MBOATs from different organisms have similar catalytic mechanisms. Our structures provide a template for understanding structure-function relationships in MBOATs and for developing therapeutic MBOAT inhibitors.
Lipid droplets, which store triglycerides and cholesterol esters, are a prominent feature of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Although their presence in ccRCC is critical for sustained tumorigenesis, their contribution to lipid homeostasis and tumor cell viability is incompletely understood. Here we show that disrupting triglyceride synthesis compromises the growth of both ccRCC tumors and ccRCC cells exposed to tumor-like conditions. Functionally, hypoxia leads to increased fatty acid saturation through inhibition of the oxygen-dependent stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) enzyme. Triglycerides counter a toxic buildup of saturated lipids, primarily by releasing the unsaturated fatty acid oleate (the principal product of SCD activity) from lipid droplets into phospholipid pools. Disrupting this process derails lipid homeostasis, causing overproduction of toxic saturated ceramides and acyl-carnitines as well as activation of the NF-κB transcription factor. Our work demonstrates that triglycerides promote homeostasis by "buffering" specific fatty acids.
The significance of Lp8, that is, abnormal lipoprotein(s) detected in fraction 8 by combined high-performance liquid chromatography/gel filtration column in patients with familial lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) syndrome, in relation to the severity of LCAT deficiency has not been analyzed.
We have studied Lp8 in a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis.
Plasma lipoproteins were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography/gel filtration column in the course of treatment of a 47-year-old female patient with primary biliary cirrhosis.
Electrophoretic lipoprotein analyses showed massive accumulation of abnormal ß- and preß-lipoproteins with a minor lipoprotein fraction at a position near the cathode corresponding to Lp-X, on day A (status: hypercholesterolemia, LCAT activity undetectable). Chromatographic lipoprotein subfraction analysis revealed free cholesterol- and phospholipid-rich lipoproteins in fractions 1-6, corresponding to chylomicrons and very low-density lipoprotein, and phospholipid- and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins with increased free cholesterol, that is, Lp8, in fractions 7-9 (corresponding to low-density lipoprotein). On day B, after additional treatment for 7 months (status: almost normolipidemia, decreased LCAT activity), although the abnormal lipoprotein and the lipoproteins in fractions 1-6, were drastically decreased, the presence of Lp8 persisted.
Lp8 likely is a minor abnormal lipoprotein fraction in patients with mildly decreased secondary LCAT activity, as well as with severely reduced primary LCAT activity.
Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) plays an important role in cholesterol esterification in serum. Serum LCAT activity is elevated in patients with serum high triglyceride and low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations, both of which are related to metabolic syndrome and subsequent diabetes mellitus, referred to as lipotoxicity. We hypothesized that increased serum LCAT activity could predict future risk of diabetes mellitus in a general Japanese population.
We prospectively studied 1496 individuals aged 20-86 years without histories of diabetes mellitus at baseline. Serum lipid concentrations, glucose parameters, and LCAT activity measured as the serum cholesterol esterification rate, were evaluated.
During 11 years of follow-up, 46 newly diagnosed patients with diabetes mellitus were reported. After adjustment for plasma glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, the relative risks (RRs) for the development of diabetes mellitus were 5.45 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 2.37-12.55; P &lt;  0.001] for body-mass index, 0.22 (95% CI, 0.09-0.53; P = 0.001) for HDL-C, 4.81 (95% CI, 1.96-11.77; P = 0.001) for triglyceride, and 4.64 (95% CI, 1.89-11.41; P = 0.001) for LCAT activity. After adjustment for HbA1c, total cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL-C, phospholipid, and free fatty acid levels, the RR of LCAT activity for future risk of diabetes mellitus remained significant (RR, 4.93; 95% CI,1.32-18.41; P = 0.018). In this analysis, we found a significant association between LCAT activity and risk of diabetes mellitus in men but not in women.
Increased serum cholesterol esterification rate is a potent predictor for future diabetes mellitus.
Hepatitis C virus is known to be highly dependent of lipid metabolism to infect new cells and replicate.
To investigate lipid and apolipoprotein profile in chronic HCV patients according to treatment response.
Patients recruited from the Hepatitis Treatment Center at Niteroi (Brazil) who received interferon (IFN)-based therapies were separated into two groups, those who achieved sustained virological response (SVR) or not (non-SVR). Another group of patients treated with IFN-free direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapies was followed from before starting the treatment until one year after therapy. Triglycerides, total cholesterol and fractions were determined by colorimetric and/or electrophoresis techniques. Lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity and serum levels of apolipoproteins A1, A2, B, C2, C3 and E were assessed by enzymatic and multiplex assays, respectively.
We studied 114 patients, and SVR was reached in 28 (39.4%) patients treated with IFN-therapy and in all (100%) patients who received DAA. Non-SVR patients (n = 43) presented altered liver parameters post-treatment. Levels of total cholesterol, LDL-C, VLDL-C and triglycerides were significant higher in SVR group. In contrast, LCAT activity and HDL-C levels were elevated in non-SVR patients. Only apolipoproteins B, C2 and C3 levels were increased in SVR group. The follow-up of SVR-DAA patients (n = 43) revealed a significant and progressive increase in serum levels of total cholesterol, LDL-C, VLDL-C and triglycerides.
After a successful treatment, chronic hepatitis C patients experienced a reestablishment of lipid metabolism. Our results suggest that the monitoring of serum lipids could be a practical and routine laboratory tool to be applied during the treatment follow-up.
Most breast cancer deaths are caused by metastasis and treatment options beyond radiation and cytotoxic drugs, which have severe side effects, and hormonal treatments, which are or become ineffective for many patients, are urgently needed. This study reanalyzed existing data from three genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using a novel computational biostatistics approach (muGWAS), which had been validated in studies of 600-2000 subjects in epilepsy and autism. MuGWAS jointly analyzes several neighboring single nucleotide polymorphisms while incorporating knowledge about genetics of heritable diseases into the statistical method and about GWAS into the rules for determining adaptive genome-wide significance. Results from three independent GWAS of 1000-2000 subjects each, which were made available under the National Institute of Health's "Up For A Challenge" (U4C) project, not only confirmed cell-cycle control and receptor/AKT signaling, but, for the first time in breast cancer GWAS, also consistently identified many genes involved in endo-/exocytosis (EEC), most of which had already been observed in functional and expression studies of breast cancer. In particular, the findings include genes that translocate (ATP8A1, ATP8B1, ANO4, ABCA1) and metabolize (AGPAT3, AGPAT4, DGKQ, LPPR1) phospholipids entering the phosphatidylinositol cycle, which controls EEC. These novel findings suggest scavenging phospholipids as a novel intervention to control local spread of cancer, packaging of exosomes (which prepare distant microenvironment for organ-specific metastases), and endocytosis of β1 integrins (which are required for spread of metastatic phenotype and mesenchymal migration of tumor cells). Beta-cyclodextrins (βCD) have already been shown to be effective in in vitro and animal studies of breast cancer, but exhibits cholesterol-related ototoxicity. The smaller alpha-cyclodextrins (αCD) also scavenges phospholipids, but cannot fit cholesterol. An in-vitro study presented here confirms hydroxypropyl (HP)-αCD to be twice as effective as HPβCD against migration of human cells of both receptor negative and estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer. If the previous successful animal studies with βCDs are replicated with the safer and more effective αCDs, clinical trials of adjuvant treatment with αCDs are warranted. Ultimately, all breast cancer are expected to benefit from treatment with HPαCD, but women with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) will benefit most, because they have fewer treatment options and their cancer advances more aggressively.
It is known that a high-fat diet induces an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle. To examine the time course of decrease in mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle after discontinuing a high-fat diet feeding, C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet for 4 wk and then switched to the control diet for another 3 or 7 d. During the high-fat diet withdrawal period, the protein content of the mitochondrial respiratory chain decreased faster than the fatty acid oxidation enzymes. The mitochondrial DNA copy number remained high for at least 1 wk after withdrawing the high-fat diet. These results suggested that after switching to the control diet following a period of high-fat diet, the increased mitochondrial biogenesis levels are maintained for a few days, and the rate of decline is divergent between the different mitochondrial components.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a highly prevalent condition which contributes to atherogenic apolipoprotein B dyslipoproteinemias. Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) and phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) are both synthesized by the liver and are important in lipid metabolism. Here, we interrogated the impact of NAFLD on plasma LCAT and PLTP activities.
Plasma LCAT activity (exogenous substrate assay) and PLTP activity (phospholipid vesicles-HDL assay) were determined in 348 subjects (279 men; 81 subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2DM); 123 with metabolic syndrome (MetS)). A Fatty Liver Index (FLI) ≥60 was used as a proxy of NAFLD. Insulin resistance was determined by homoeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR).
A total of 147 participants had an FLI ≥60 coinciding with T2DM and MetS (P &lt; 0.001 for each). Plasma LCAT activity and PLTP activity were on average 12% and 5% higher, respectively, in subjects with an FLI ≥ 60 (P &lt; 0.001 for each). In age- and sex-adjusted partial linear regression analysis, LCAT activity and PLTP activity were positively related to various obesity measures and HOMA-IR (P &lt; 0.001 for each). In multivariable linear regression analyses adjusted for age and sex, LCAT activity was associated with an FLI ≥ 60 independent of T2DM and MetS, the waist/hip ratio, or HOMA-IR (β = 0.307 to 0.366, P &lt; 0001 for all models). PLTP activity was also associated with an FLI ≥ 60 independent of these variables (β = 0.151 to 0223, P = 0.013 to 0.001).
NAFLD, as inferred from an FLI≥60, confers higher plasma LCAT and to a lesser extent PLTP activity, even when taking account of T2DM, MetS, central obesity and insulin resistance.
Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9), a protein regulating the number of cell-surface LDL receptors (LDLR), circulates partially associated to plasma lipoproteins. How this interaction alters PCSK9 plasma levels is still unclear. In the present study, we took advantage of the availability of a large cohort of carriers of genetic HDL disorders to evaluate how HDL defects affect plasma PCSK9 levels and its distribution among lipoproteins. Plasma PCSK9 concentrations were determined by ELISA in carriers of mutations in LCAT, ABCA1, or APOAI genes, and lipoprotein distribution was analyzed by FPLC. Carriers of one or two mutations in the LCAT gene show plasma PCSK9 levels comparable to that of unaffected family controls (homozygotes, 159.4 ng/mL (124.9;243.3); heterozygotes, 180.3 ng/mL (127.6;251.5) and controls, 190.4 ng/mL (146.7;264.4); P for trend = 0.33). Measurement of PCSK9 in plasma of subjects carrying mutations in ABCA1 or APOAI genes confirmed normal values. When fractionated by FPLC, PCSK9 peaked in a region between LDL and HDL in control subjects. In carriers of all HDL defects, lipoprotein profile shows a strong reduction of HDL, but the distribution of PCSK9 was superimposable to that of controls. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that in genetically determined low HDL states plasma PCSK9 concentrations and lipoprotein distribution are preserved, thus suggesting that HDL may not be involved in PCSK9 transport in plasma.
Gene-gene and gene-environment interactions may be partially responsible for dyslipidemia, but studies investigating interactions in the reverse cholesterol transport system (RCT) are limited. We explored these interactions in a Xinjiang rural population by genotyping five SNPs using SNPShot technique in APOA1, ABCA1, and LCAT, which are involved in the RCT (690 patients, 743 controls). We conducted unconditional logistical regression analysis to evaluate associations and generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction to evaluate interactions. Results revealed significant differences in rs670 and rs2292318 allele frequencies between cases and controls (P&lt;0.025). rs670 G allele carriers were more likely to develop dyslipidemia than A allele carriers (OR = 1.315, OR 95% CI: 1.067-2.620; P = 0.010). rs2292318 T allele carriers were more likely to develop dyslipidemia than A allele carriers (OR = 1.264, OR 95% CI: 1.037-1.541; P = 0.020). Gene-gene interaction model APOA1rs670-ABCA1rs1800976-ABCA1rs4149313-LCATrs1109166 (P = 0.0107) and gene-environment interaction model ABCA1rs1800976-ABCA1rs4149313-LCATrs1109166-obesity-smoking were optimal dyslipidemia predictors (P = 0.0107) and can interact (4). Differences in A-C-A-C-A and G-G-G-T-G haplotype frequencies were observed (P&lt;0.05). Serum lipid profiles could be partly attributed to RCT gene polymorphisms. Thus, dyslipidemia is influenced by APOA1, ABCA1, LCAT, environmental factors, and their interactions.
Lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) plays a pivotal role in HDL metabolism but its influence on atherosclerosis remains controversial for decades both in animal and clinical studies. Because lack of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is a major difference between murine and humans in lipoprotein metabolism, we aimed to create a novel Syrian Golden hamster model deficient in LCAT activity, which expresses endogenous CETP, to explore its metabolic features and particularly the influence of LCAT on the development of atherosclerosis.
CRISPR/CAS9 gene editing system was employed to generate mutant LCAT hamsters. The characteristics of lipid metabolism and the development of atherosclerosis in the mutant hamsters were investigated using various conventional methods in comparison with wild type control animals.
Hamsters lacking LCAT activity exhibited pro-atherogenic dyslipidemia as diminished high density lipoprotein (HDL) and ApoAI, hypertriglyceridemia, Chylomicron/VLDL accumulation and significantly increased ApoB100/48. Mechanistic study for hypertriglyceridemia revealed impaired LPL-mediated lipolysis and increased very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion, with upregulation of hepatic genes involved in lipid synthesis and transport. The pro-atherogenic dyslipidemia in mutant hamsters was exacerbated after high fat diet feeding, ultimately leading to near a 3- and 5-fold increase in atherosclerotic lesions by aortic en face and sinus lesion quantitation, respectively.
Our findings demonstrate that LCAT deficiency in hamsters develops pro-atherogenic dyslipidemia and promotes atherosclerotic lesion formation.
LCAT is an enzyme responsible for the formation of cholesteryl esters from unesterified cholesterol (UC) and phospholipid (PL) molecules in HDL particles. However, it is poorly understood how LCAT interacts with lipoproteins and how apoA-I activates it. Here we have studied the interactions between LCAT and lipids through molecular simulations. In addition, we studied the binding of LCAT to apoA-I-derived peptides, and their effect on LCAT lipid association-utilizing experiments. Results show that LCAT anchors itself to lipoprotein surfaces by utilizing nonpolar amino acids located in the membrane-binding domain and the active site tunnel opening. Meanwhile, the membrane-anchoring hydrophobic amino acids attract cholesterol molecules next to them. The results also highlight the role of the lid-loop in the lipid binding and conformation of LCAT with respect to the lipid surface. The apoA-I-derived peptides from the LCAT-activating region bind to LCAT and promote its lipid surface interactions, although some of these peptides do not bind lipids individually. The transfer free-energy of PL from the lipid bilayer into the active site is consistent with the activation energy of LCAT. Furthermore, the entry of UC molecules into the active site becomes highly favorable by the acylation of SER181.
Retinoic acid (RA) enhances TGF-β-dependent differentiation of Foxp3(+) inducible regulatory T cells (iTregs) and inhibits Th17 differentiation by binding to the RA receptor (RAR)/retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimer. The major physiologic RA, all-trans-RA, binds to RAR but not to RXR at physiological concentrations. It remained unclear whether RXR-mediated stimulation affected the iTregs and Th17 differentiation. We found in this study that the RXR agonists, PA024 and tributyltin, augmented the ability of all-trans-RA or the RAR agonist Am80 to enhance CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells to acquire Foxp3 expression and suppressive function. However, they failed to enhance Foxp3 expression in the presence of the RAR antagonist LE540, suggesting that the effect depends on RAR-mediated signals. They exerted the effect largely by augmenting the ability of all-trans-RA to suppress the production of IL-4, IL-21, and IFN-γ that inhibited Foxp3 expression. Agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and liver X receptors (LXRs), permissive partners of RXR, failed to enhance Foxp3 expression. In contrast, RXR agonists and LXR agonists suppressed IL-17 expression. The RXR-mediated suppression was not canceled by blocking RAR stimulation but was likely to involve permissive activation of LXRs. All-trans-RA and an agonist of RXR or LXR additively suppressed IL-17 expression when the all-trans-RA concentration was low. RXR agonists also suppressed Ccr6 expression that is essential for Th17 cells to enter the CNS. Accordingly, tributyltin treatment of mice ameliorated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis through regulating Th17 cell activities. These results suggest that RXR stimulation modulates Foxp3(+) iTreg and Th17 differentiation with differential dependence on RAR-mediated stimulation. 
HCV relies on host lipid metabolism to complete its life cycle and HCV core is crucial to this interaction. Liver secreted ANGPTL-3 is an LXR- and HNF-1α-regulated protein, which plays a key role in lipid metabolism by increasing plasma lipids via inhibition of lipase enzymes. Here we aimed to investigate the modulation of ANGPTL-3 by HCV core and identify the molecular mechanisms involved.
qRT-PCR and ELISA were used to assess ANGPTL-3 mRNA and protein levels in HCV patients, the JFH-1 infectious system and liver cell lines. Transfections, chromatin immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence delineated parts of the molecular mechanisms implicated in the core-mediated regulation of ANGPTL-3 gene expression.
ANGPTL-3 gene expression was decreased in HCV-infected patients and the JFH-1 infectious system. mRNA and promoter activity levels were down-regulated by core. The response was lost when an HNF-1α element in ANGPTL-3 promoter was mutated, while loss of HNF-1α DNA binding to this site was recorded in the presence of HCV core. HNF-1α mRNA and protein levels were not altered by core. However, trafficking between nucleus and cytoplasm was observed and then blocked by an inhibitor of the HNF-1α-specific kinase Mirk/Dyrk1B. Transactivation of LXR/RXR signalling could not restore core-mediated down-regulation of ANGPTL-3 promoter activity.
ANGPTL-3 is negatively regulated by HCV in vivo and in vitro. HCV core represses ANGPTL-3 expression through loss of HNF-1α binding activity and blockage of LXR/RXR transactivation. The putative ensuing increase in serum lipid clearance and uptake by the liver may sustain HCV virus replication and persistence.
Nuclear receptors are ligand-activated transcription factors linking lipid signaling to the expression of the genome. There is increasing appreciation of the involvement of this receptor network in the metabolic programming of macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), essential members of the innate immune system. In this review we focus on the role of retinoid X receptor, retinoic acid receptor, peroxisome proliferator-associated receptor γ, liver X receptor, and vitamin D receptor in shaping the immune and metabolic functions of macrophages and DCs. We also provide an overview of the contribution of macrophage- and DC-expressed nuclear receptors to various immunopathologic conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, asthma, and some others. We suggest that systematic analyses of the roles of these receptors and their activating lipid ligands in immunopathologies combined with complementary and focused translational and clinical research will be crucial for the development of new therapies using the many molecules available to target nuclear receptors. 
Use of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) as a differentiation agent has been limited to acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) as non-APL leukemias are insensitive to ATRA. We recently demonstrated that the rexinoid, bexarotene, induces differentiation and therapeutic responses in patients with refractory AML. Rexinoids bind and activate retinoid X receptors (RXRs); however, rexinoids alone are incapable of activating retinoic acid receptor (RAR)/RXR complexes, suggesting that myeloid differentiation can occur independent of RAR. In this study, we demonstrate that rexinoid differentiation of AML cells is RAR independent and requires the expression of PU.1. Because of the promiscuousness of RXR with other nuclear receptors, myeloid differentiation by bexarotene with other nuclear receptor ligands was explored. Bexarotene cooperated with ATRA to enhance differentiation in some AML cell lines; however, the combination of bexarotene with the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone did not. In contrast, bexarotene combined with liver X receptor (LXR) agonists, T0901317 or GW3965, induced potent differentiation and cytotoxicity in AML cell lines and primary human AML cells, but not in normal progenitor cells. These results suggest that RXR/LXR-regulated gene expression in normal cells is deregulated in AML cells and identifies a potential role for these agonists in differentiation therapy of non-APLs. 
The liver X receptors (LXRs) have been shown to be crucially involved in maternal-fetal cholesterol transport and placentation. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression pattern and frequency of LXR under normal physiological circumstances and in spontaneous abortion and/or recurrent miscarriage. A total of 29 (12 physiologic pregnancies/10 spontaneous abortions/7 recurrent miscarriages) human pregnancies in first trimester were analysed for LXR expression. Expression changes were evaluated by immunohistochemistry for receptor and quantitative RT-PCR (TaqMan) was performed to determine the level of LXR mRNA expression. We also stained for RXR α and PPAR γ as possible heterodimers of LXR. LXR expression was downregulated in the syncytiotrophoblast of spontaneous abortion placentas compared to normal pregnancy. In recurrent miscarriage there was a trend for a downregulation. Decidua showed an even stronger downregulation in both groups. In the syncytiotrophoblast we found a positive correlation for the combination of LXR/PPAR γ in abortions and a negative correlation for LXR/RXR α . In addition, double-immunofluorescence staining showed that LXR as well as RXR α and PPAR γ are expressed by the extravillous trophoblast. Finally, RXR α and LXR showed coexpression in the same extravillous trophoblast cells. To conclude, our data show that LXR expression is decreased in miscarriage.
Nutrigenomics analyzes relations between diet and genes, and identifies mechanisms in which food and nutrition affect health and lifestyles and noncommunicable diseases (R. Chadwick, 2004). Bioactive dietary components are signal molecules that carry information from the external environment and affect in terms of quantity and quality in the process of gene expression. The biological effect of bioactive dietary components depends on various of physiological processes that can occur within a few genes. Polymorphism of genes can change their function and physiological response of the body for nutrients. Bioactive dietary components work on at least two levels of the expression of genes as factors regulating chromatin structure and as factors directly regulate the activity of nuclear receptors. The processes of synthesis and DNA repair are regulated by some of vitamins, macro-and micro-elements. They provide, among others, cofactors of enzymes that catalyze the replication of DNA methylation and its repair. DNA methylation profile may change under the influence of diet, single nucleotide polymorphisms and environmental factors. Bioactive dietary components may directly affect the process of gene expression by acting as ligands for nuclear receptors. Sensitive to dietary group of nuclear receptors are sensory receptors. This group includes, among others receptor PPAR (peroxisome proliferator activated), responsible for energy metabolism and receptors LXR (liver X receptor), FXR (farnesoid X receptor) and RXR, which is responsible for the metabolism of cholesterol.
High cholesterol turnover catalyzed by cholesterol 24-hydroxylase is essential for neural functions, especially learning. Because 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24-OHC), produced by 24-hydroxylase, induces apoptosis of neuronal cells, it is vital to eliminate it rapidly from cells. Here, using differentiated SH-SY5Y neuron-like cells as a model, we examined whether 24-OHC is actively eliminated via transporters induced by its accumulation. The expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 was induced by 24-OHC, as well as TO901317 and retinoic acid, which are ligands of the nuclear receptors liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor (LXR/RXR). When the expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 was induced, 24-OHC efflux was stimulated in the presence of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), whereas apolipoprotein A-I was not an efficient acceptor. The efflux was suppressed by the addition of siRNA against ABCA1, but not by ABCG1 siRNA. To confirm the role of each transporter, we analyzed human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably expressing human ABCA1 or ABCG1; we clearly observed 24-OHC efflux in the presence of HDL, whereas efflux in the presence of apolipoprotein A-I was marginal. Furthermore, the treatment of primary cerebral neurons with LXR/RXR ligands suppressed the toxicity of 24-OHC. These results suggest that ABCA1 actively eliminates 24-OHC in the presence of HDL as a lipid acceptor and protects neuronal cells.
ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC)-A1 is an important protein of cholesterol homoeostasis and atherosclerosis as it is the major lipid transporter responsible for the export of cholesterol from cells. Many studies have examined kinase regulation of ABCA1 expression. In contrast, very little is known about whether dephosphorylation events play a role in ABCA1 expression. In this study, we explored the involvement of phosphatases in the regulation of ABCA1 expression.
We observed that general protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors ablated ABCA1 protein and mRNA when stimulated with synthetic ligands. This effect is transcriptional, and appears to involve the nuclear receptor, retinoid X receptor (RXR).
Our data demonstrate that inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatases down-regulates ABCA1 expression, indicating a new level of regulation of a key protein in cholesterol export.
ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) facilitates cholesterol efflux and thereby inhibits lipid-laden macrophage/foam cell formation and atherosclerosis. ABCA1 expression is transcriptionally regulated by activation of liver X receptor (LXR). Both etoposide and teniposide are DNA topoisomerase II (Topo II) inhibitors and are chemotherapeutic medications used in the treatment of various cancers. Interestingly, etoposide inhibits atherosclerosis in rabbits by unclear mechanisms. Herein, we report the effects of etoposide and teniposide on macrophage ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux. Both etoposide and teniposide increased macrophage free cholesterol efflux. This increase was associated with increased ABCA1 mRNA and protein expression. Etoposide and teniposide also increased ABCA1 promoter activity in an LXR-dependent manner and formation of the LXRE-LXR/RXR complex indicating that transcriptional induction had occurred. Expression of ABCG1 and fatty acid synthase (FAS), another two LXR-targeted genes, was also induced by etoposide and teniposide. In vivo, administration of mice with either etoposide or teniposide induced macrophage ABCA1 expression and enhanced reverse cholesterol transport from macrophages to feces. Taken together, our study indicates that etoposide and teniposide increase macrophage ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux that may be attributed to the anti-atherogenic properties of etoposide. Our study also describes a new function for Topo II inhibitors in addition to their role in anti-tumorigenesis.
Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSL) play key roles in fatty acid metabolism in liver and other metabolic tissues in an isozyme-specific manner. In this study, we examined the effects of a fructose-enriched diet on expressions of ACSL isoforms in the liver of hamsters. We showed that the fructose diet markedly reduced the mRNA and protein expressions of ACSL3 in hamster liver without significant effects on other ACSLs. The decrease in ACSL3 abundance was accompanied by a reduction in ACSL-catalyzed synthesis of arachidonyl-CoA and oleoyl-CoA in liver homogenates of hamsters fed the fructose diet as opposed to normal diet. We further showed that fructose diet specifically reduced expressions of three key components of the LXR signaling pathway, namely, liver X receptor (LXR)α, LXRβ, and retinoid X receptor (RXR)β. Exogenous expression and activation of LXRα/β increased hamster ACSL3 promoter activities in a LXR-responsive element (LXRE)-dependent fashion. Finally, we showed that treating hamsters with LXR agonist GW3965 increased hepatic ACSL3 expression without affecting other ACSL isoforms. Furthermore, the ligand-induced increases of ACSL3 expression were accompanied with the reduction of hepatic triglyceride levels in GW3965-treated hamster liver. Altogether, our studies demonstrate that fructose diet has a negative impact on LXR signaling pathway in liver tissue and reduction of ACSL3 expression/activity could be a causal factor for fructose-induced hepatic steatosis.
Selective Alzheimer's disease (AD) indicator-1 (Seladin-1) gene has been identified as a gene, whose expression is down-regulated in the vulnerable region in the brain of AD patients. Thyroid hormone (TH) is important to maintain the function of central nervous system and TH receptor (TR) is known to crosstalk with liver X receptor (LXR) on the lipid metabolism-related gene promoter. Recently, we have demonstrated that TR-β up-regulates the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter at the transcriptional levels and LXR-α compensates the promoter activation only when the thyroid function is insufficient. In the current study, we have identified that TH and an LXR artificial agonist, TO901317 (TO) activated the human Seladin-1 promoter (-1024/+57 base pair (bp)) including consensus TH response element (TRE) half site (site A: -381 to -375 bp), and the site A mutation deteriorated the activation by TH and TO. Both TR-β and LXR-α heterodimerize with retinoid X receptor (RXR)-α on the site A, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay revealed that TR-β, LXR-α and RXR-α are recruited to the site A. Moreover, TR-β and LXR-α functionally compete for the promoter activation in CV1 cells. Taken together, we concluded that TR-β and LXR-α competitively up-regulate the human Seladin-1 promoter, sharing the same response element, site A.
Selective Alzheimer's disease (AD) indicator 1 (Seladin-1) has been identified as a gene down-regulated in the degenerated lesions of AD brain. Up-regulation of Seladin-1 reduces the accumulation of β-amyloid and neuronal death. Thyroid hormone (TH) exerts an important effect on the development and maintenance of central nervous systems. In the current study, we demonstrated that Seladin-1 gene and protein expression in the forebrain was increased in thyrotoxic mice compared with that of euthyroid mice. However, unexpectedly, no significant decrease in the gene and protein expression was observed in hypothyroid mice. Interestingly, an agonist of liver X receptor (LXR), TO901317 (TO) administration in vivo increased Seladin-1 gene and protein expression in the mouse forebrain only in a hypothyroid state and in the presence of mutant TR-β, suggesting that LXR-α would compensate for TR-β function to maintain Seladin-1 gene expression in hypothyroidism and resistance to TH. TH activated the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter (-1936/+21 bp) and site 2 including canonical TH response element (TRE) half-site in the region between -159 and -154 bp is responsible for the positive regulation. RXR-α/TR-β heterodimerization was identified on site 2 by gel-shift assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed the recruitment of TR-β to site 2 and the recruitment was increased upon TH administration. On the other hand, LXR-α utilizes a distinct region from site 2 (-120 to -102 bp) to activate the mouse Seladin-1 gene promoter. Taking these findings together, we concluded that TH up-regulates Seladin-1 gene expression at the transcriptional level and LXR-α maintains the gene expression.
Food deprivation in mammals results in profound changes in fuel metabolism and substrate regulation. Among these changes are decreased reliance on the counter-regulatory dynamics by insulin-glucagon due to reduced glucose utilization, and increased concentrations of lipid substrates in plasma to meet the energetic demands of peripheral tissues. As the primary storage site of lipid substrates, adipose tissue must then be a primary contributor to the regulation of metabolism in food deprived states. Through its regulation of lipolysis, adipose tissue influences the availability of carbohydrate, lipid, and protein substrates. Additionally, lipid substrates can act as ligands to various nuclear receptors (retinoid x receptor (RXR), liver x receptor (LXR), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)) and exhibit prominent regulatory capabilities over the expression of genes involved in substrate metabolism within various tissues. Therefore, through its control of lipolysis, adipose tissue also indirectly regulates the utilization of metabolic substrates within peripheral tissues. In this review, these processes are described in greater detail and the extent to which adipose tissue and lipid substrates regulate metabolism in food deprived mammals is explored with comments on future directions to better assess the contribution of adipose tissue to metabolism. 
Recent studies have underlined the role of nuclear receptors in the involvement of prostate cancer signalling pathways.
A total of 84 benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), 84 low risk prostate cancer (LPC) and 64 advanced disease (APC) cases were sampled on a tissue microarray (TMA) and stained for retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-α, retionoid X receptor (RXR)-α, liver X receptor (LXR)-α, farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and proliferate-activated receptor gamma (PPAR)-γ and the (pro)-inflammatory molecules cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and inducible Nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) immunohistochemically.
PPAR-γ expression in APC tissues was found to be significantly higher than that in LPC and BPH specimens (p&lt;0.001). In contrast, RXR-a expression was significantly lower (p&lt;0.001). COX2 staining demonstrated a trend towards overexpression in APC (p=0.025). No significant differences were found for RAR-α, iNOS and TNF-α expression. Staining of FXR and LXR was seen diffusely in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus, preventing sufficient evaluation by definition.
This study provides the basis for applying PPAR-γ ligands clinically in treatment of APC.
Retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonists are reported to exhibit blood glucose-lowering action owing to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)/RXR or liver X receptor (LXR)/RXR activation, but may also cause adverse effects such as blood triglyceride elevation. In order to examine the feasibility of separating the glucose-lowering action from the adverse effects, we examined the effects of RXR agonists (NEt-TMN), NEt-3IB, and NEt-3IP, which have different heterodimer-activating patterns, in KKA(y) type 2 diabetes model mice. We found that NEt-3IB induced lower degrees of hepatomegaly and blood triglyceride (TG) elevation than the other RXR agonists, even though all of them showed similar blood glucose-lowering action on repeated administration. These findings indicate that structural modification of RXR agonists is a potentially effective strategy to reduce adverse effects while retaining desired activities.
GLUCOCORTICOIDS are steroid hormones that strongly influence intermediary carbohydrate metabolism by increasing the transcription rate of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), a key enzyme of gluconeogenesis, and suppress the immune system through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The liver X receptors (LXRs), on the other hand, bind to cholesterol metabolites, heterodimerize with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), and regulate the cholesterol turnover, the hepatic glucose metabolism by decreasing the expression of G6Pase, and repress a set of inflammatory genes in immune cells. Since the actions of these receptors overlap with each other, we evaluated the crosstalk between the GR- and LXR-mediated signaling systems. Transient transfection-based reporter assays and gene silencing methods using siRNAs for LXRs showed that overexpression/ligand (GW3965) activation of LXRs/RXRs repressed GR-stimulated transactivation of certain glucocorticoid response element (GRE)-driven promoters in a gene-specific fashion. Activation of LXRs by GW3965 attenuated dexamethasone-stimulated elevation of circulating glucose in rats. It also suppressed dexamethasone-induced mRNA expression of hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) in rats, mice and human hepatoma HepG2 cells, whereas endogenous, unliganded LXRs were required for dexamethasone-induced mRNA expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. In microarray transcriptomic analysis of rat liver, GW3965 differentially regulated glucocorticoid-induced transcriptional activity of about 15% of endogenous glucocorticoid-responsive genes. To examine the mechanism through which activated LXRs attenuated GR transcriptional activity, we examined LXRα/RXRα binding to GREs. Endogenous LXRα/RXRα bound GREs and inhibited GR binding to these DNA sequences both in in vitro and in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, while their recombinant proteins did so on classic or G6Pase GREs in gel mobility shift assays. We propose that administration of LXR agonists may be beneficial in glucocorticoid treatment- or stress-associated dysmetabolic states by directly and gene-specifically attenuating the transcriptional activity of the GR on glucose and/or lipid metabolism.
The liver X receptor α (LXRα) is a nuclear receptor that is involved in regulation of lipid metabolism, cellular proliferation and apoptosis, and immunity. In this report, we characterize three human LXRα isoforms with variation in the ligand-binding domain (LBD). While examining the expression of LXRα3, which lacks 60 amino acids within the LBD, we identified two novel transcripts that encode LXRα-LBD variants (LXRα4 and LXRα5). LXRα4 has an insertion of 64 amino acids in helix 4/5, and LXRα5 lacks the C-terminal helices 7 to 12 due to a termination codon in an additional exon that encodes an intron in the LXRα1 mRNA. LXRα3, LXRα4, and LXRα5 were expressed at lower levels compared with LXRα1 in many human tissues and cell lines. We also observed weak expression of LXRα3 and LXRα4 in several tissues of mice. LXR ligand treatment induced differential regulation of LXRα isoform mRNA expression in a cell type-dependent manner. Whereas LXRα3 had no effect, LXRα4 has weak transactivation, retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimerization, and coactivator recruitment activities. LXRα5 interacted with a corepressor in a ligand-independent manner and inhibited LXRα1 transactivation and target gene expression when overexpressed. Combination of LXRα5 cotransfection and LXRα antagonist treatment produced additive effects on the inhibition of ligand-dependent LXRα1 activation. We constructed structural models of the LXRα4-LBD and its complexes with ligand, RXR-LBD, and coactivator peptide. The models showed that the insertion in the LBD can be predicted to disrupt RXR heterodimerization. Regulation of LXRα pre-mRNA splicing may be involved in the pathogenesis of LXRα-related diseases.
ABC transporter G1 (ABCG1) plays a pivotal role in HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux and atherogenesis. We investigated whether, and how, retinoic acid receptors (RARs) regulate ABCG1 expression in macrophages. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), an RAR ligand, increased ABCG1 protein levels and apoA-I/HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux from the macrophages. Both ATRA and other RAR agonists, TTNPB and Am580, increased major transcripts driven by promoter B upstream of exon 5, though minor transcripts driven by promoter A upstream of exon 1 were only increased by ATRA. The stimulatory effects of ATRA on ABCG1 expression were completely abolished in the presence of RAR/RXR antagonists but were only partially canceled in the presence of an LXR antagonist. Adenovirus with overexpressed oxysterol sulfotransferase abolished the LXR pathway, as previously reported, and ATRA-responsiveness in ABCA1/ABCG1 expressions were respectively attenuated by 38 and 22% compared to the control virus. Promoter assays revealed that ABCG1 levels were regulated more by promoter B than promoter A, and ATRA activated promoter B in a liver X receptor-responsive element (LXRE)-dependent manner. Further, LXRE-B in intron 7, but not LXRE-A in intron 5, enhanced ATRA responsiveness under overexpression of all RAR isoforms-RARα/β/γ. In contrast, the activation of promoter B by TTNPB depended on LXRE-B and RARα, but not on RARβ/γ. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation and gel-shift assays revealed a specific and direct repeat 4-dependent binding of RARα to LXRE-B. In conclusion, RAR ligands increase ABCA1/G1 expression and apoA-I/HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux from macrophages, and modulate ABCG1 promoter activity via LXRE-dependent mechanisms.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with impaired clearance of β-amyloid (Aβ) from the brain, a process normally facilitated by apolipoprotein E (apoE). ApoE expression is transcriptionally induced through the action of the nuclear receptors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and liver X receptors in coordination with retinoid X receptors (RXRs). Oral administration of the RXR agonist bexarotene to a mouse model of AD resulted in enhanced clearance of soluble Aβ within hours in an apoE-dependent manner. Aβ plaque area was reduced more than 50% within just 72 hours. Furthermore, bexarotene stimulated the rapid reversal of cognitive, social, and olfactory deficits and improved neural circuit function. Thus, RXR activation stimulates physiological Aβ clearance mechanisms, resulting in the rapid reversal of a broad range of Aβ-induced deficits.
An accumulation of data from in vitro to in vivo model system has established a pivotal role of three crucial ligand activated nuclear receptors RXR, LXR-alpha and VDR for their ability to regulate an array of genes involved in regulation of fundamental cellular processes to patho-physiological situations. Keeping in view RXR as a common heterodimeric partner for LXR-alpha and VDR, the present study was designed to dissect the interrelationship between these three nuclear receptors in peripheral blood mononuclear cellular model. The present study revealed that all the three nuclear receptors displayed auto regulation in response to their specific ligands; Both LXR-alpha and VDR regulated the expression of their heterodimeric partner RXR; and VDR was regulated by LXR-alpha through its ability to modulate SREBP response element present in the promoter region of VDR gene. Based on these findings, the role of these nuclear receptors could be better understood in various nuclear receptor mediated pathological processes.
We investigated the properties of honokiol, a natural rexinoid, as a regulator of retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimers with various partner nuclear receptors (NRs), in comparison with those of the synthetic rexinoid bexarotene. Honokiol alone was hardly capable of activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ/RXR, RXR/liver X receptor (LXR), and RXR/vitamin D receptor (VDR) heterodimers, whereas it effectively potentiated their activation by agonists for the partner NRs of the RXR heterodimers. These findings were further supported by increased mRNA and protein levels for the respective NR target genes. Bexarotene alone activated PPARγ/RXR and RXR/LXR heterodimers, but not RXR/VDR heterodimers, and facilitated the activation of all three RXR heterodimers by the respective PPARγ, LXR, and VDR agonists. When the potencies of honokiol and bexarotene were compared, honokiol was able to serve as a subsidiary agonist in the activation of RXR heterodimers in a similar manner to bexarotene. However, it seemed to potentiate the activation of PPARγ/RXR heterodimers by the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone more efficiently than bexarotene, and was a less potent RXR agonist than bexarotene. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that honokiol is a rexinoid that possesses distinct properties from bexarotene, and mainly has subsidiary roles in the activation of RXR heterodimers by potentiating the activation of RXR heterodimers by agonists for the partner NRs.
The dynamical behavior of the nuclear receptor LXR/RXR heterodimer was investigated with molecular dynamics simulations. The simulations reveal correlated motion between residues across the dimer interface that depends significantly on occupation of the ligand binding sites of the monomers. These results are broadly consistent with the observed experimental behavior of the dimers, where structural perturbation is thought to be a key element in signal transduction. Our results provide dynamical support for this model of allosteric control.
The liver X receptors (LXRs) are nuclear receptors that form permissive heterodimers with retinoid X receptor (RXR) and are important regulators of lipid metabolism in the liver. We have recently shown that RXR agonist-induced hypertriglyceridemia and hepatic steatosis in mice are dependent on LXRs and correlate with an LXR-dependent hepatic induction of lipogenic genes. To further investigate the roles of RXR and LXR in the regulation of hepatic gene expression, we have mapped the ligand-regulated genome-wide binding of these factors in mouse liver. We find that the RXR agonist bexarotene primarily increases the genomic binding of RXR, whereas the LXR agonist T0901317 greatly increases both LXR and RXR binding. Functional annotation of putative direct LXR target genes revealed a significant association with classical LXR-regulated pathways as well as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathways, and subsequent chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) mapping of PPARα binding demonstrated binding of PPARα to 71 to 88% of the identified LXR-RXR binding sites. The combination of sequence analysis of shared binding regions and sequential ChIP on selected sites indicate that LXR-RXR and PPARα-RXR bind to degenerate response elements in a mutually exclusive manner. Together, our findings suggest extensive and unexpected cross talk between hepatic LXR and PPARα at the level of binding to shared genomic sites.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), a key regulator of energy metabolism and lipid homeostasis in multiple highly oxidative tissues, has been implicated in the metabolic derangements of diabetes and obesity. However, relatively less is known regarding its role in neurological functions. Using shotgun lipidomics, we investigated the lipidome of mouse cerebral cortex with generalized deficiency of PGC-1α (PGC-1α(-/-)) versus wild-type (WT) mice under standard diet and chronically calorically restricted conditions. Specific deficiency in sulfatide, a myelin-specific lipid class critically involved in maintaining neurological function, was uncovered in the cortex of PGC-1α(-/-) mice compared with WT mice at all ages examined. Chronic caloric restriction (CR) for 22 months essentially restored the sulfatide reduction in PGC-1α(-/-) mice compared with WT, but sulfatide reduction was not restored in PGC-1α(-/-) with CR for a short term (i.e., 3 months). Mechanistic studies uncovered and differentiated the biochemical mechanisms underpinning the two conditions of altered sulfatide homeostasis. The former is modulated through PGC-1α-MAL pathway, whereas the latter is under the control of LXR/RXR-apoE metabolism pathway. These results suggest a novel mechanistic role of PGC-1α in sulfatide homeostasis, provide new insights into the importance of PGC-1α in neurological functions, and indicate a potential therapeutic approach for treatment of deficient PGC-1α-induced alterations in sulfatide homeostasis.
Nuclear hormone receptors are transcription factors that can be activated by nutrition-derived ligands and alter the expression of various specific target genes. Stearoyl-Coenzyme A desaturase (SCD1) converts palmitic acid (16:0) to palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7) as well as stearic acid (18:0) to oleic acid (18:1n-9). At the same time, elongase 6 (ELOVL6) elongates 16:1n-7 and 18:1n-9 to vaccenic acid (18:1n-7) and eicosenoic acid (20:1n-9). We examined how synthetic selective ligands of nuclear hormone receptors alter the gene expression of hepatic enzymes in mice. In addition, we examined how the regulation of these two enzymes influences fatty acid composition of phospholipids in liver and plasma. Mice were gavaged daily for 1 week with synthetic ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α, β/δ, γ, liver X receptor (LXR), retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid-X receptor (RXR) for 1 week. Phospholipids from liver and plasma were analysed using ESI-MS/MS and GC after saponification. Hepatic gene expression of SCD1 and ELOVL6 was measured using QRT-PCR. SCD1 and ELOVL6 expression increased after the gavage of LXR and RXR ligands. The analysis of fatty acid composition of total phospholipids in plasma and liver showed increased percentage contributions of the SCD1 and ELOVL6 products 18:1n-9, 18:1n-7 and 20:1n-9 after LXR and RXR ligand application. Analysis of total phospholipids from plasma and liver revealed a significant increase in monounsaturated fatty acids bound in phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) and lysophosphatidylcholine (PtdEtn) after LXR and RXR ligand administration. Increased hepatic gene expression of SCD1 and ELOVL6 after gavage of selective RXR or LXR ligands to mice resulted in increased concentrations of their metabolic products in phospholipids of liver and plasma.
Nuclear receptors (NRs) associate with various coactivator proteins via direct interaction with a short LXXLL motif (also called NR box) that is present among coactivators. Here we identified the critical residues within or outside NR box-2 or -3 of SRC-1, which are required for the optimal interaction with LXR/RXR heterodimers using the yeast one- plus two-hybrid screening system. The critical residues of NR box-2 were broadly located from position -4 to +5 of the NR box (where +1 is the first L of LXXLL motif), whereas those of NR box-3 were located between -1 and +5. We assessed the functional and physical interactions between the isolated NR box-2 mutants and various NRs. Among the NR box-2 mutants, H-3Q, I-1T/V and H+2P mutants evidenced different interaction profiles depending on the target NRs, thereby indicating that these residues are the specific determinants required for the selective interaction between the SRC-1 NR box-2 and a given receptor.
As the promiscuous partner of heterodimeric associations, retinoid X receptors (RXRs) play a key role within the Nuclear Receptor (NR) superfamily. Some of the heterodimers (PPAR/RXR, LXR/RXR, FXR/RXR) are "permissive" as they become transcriptionally active in the sole presence of either an RXR-selective ligand ("rexinoid") or a NR partner ligand. In contrast, "non-permissive" heterodimers (including RAR/RXR, VDR/RXR and TR/RXR) are unresponsive to rexinoids alone but these agonists superactivate transcription by synergizing with partner agonists. Despite their promiscuity in heterodimer formation and activation of multiple pathways, RXR is a target for drug discovery. Indeed, a rexinoid is used in the clinic for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. In addition to cancer RXR modulators hold therapeutical potential for the treatment of metabolic diseases. The modulation potential of the rexinoid (as agonist or antagonist ligand) is dictated by the precise conformation of the ligand-receptor complexes and the nature and extent of their interaction with co-regulators, which determine the specific physiological responses through transcription modulation of cognate gene networks. Notwithstanding the advances in this field, it is not yet possible to predict the correlation between ligand structure and physiological response. We will focus on this review on the modulation of PPARγ/RXR and LXR/RXR heterodimer activities by rexinoids. The genetic and pharmacological data from animal models of insulin resistance, diabetes and obesity demonstrate that RXR agonists and antagonists have promise as anti-obesity agents. However, the treatment with rexinoids raises triglycerides levels, suppresses the thyroid hormone axis, and induces hepatomegaly, which has complicated the development of these compounds as therapeutic agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. The discovery of PPARγ/RXR and LXR/RXR heterodimer-selective rexinoids, which act differently than PPARγ or LXR agonists, might overcome some of these limitations.
Aquaporin 3 (AQP3), a member of the aquaglyceroporin family, which transports water and glycerol, is robustly expressed in epidermis and plays an important role in stratum corneum hydration, permeability barrier function and wound healing. PPAR and LXR activation regulates the expression of many proteins in the epidermis and thereby can affect epidermal function. Here, we report that PPARgamma activators markedly stimulate AQP3 mRNA expression in both undifferentiated and differentiated cultured human keratinocytes (CHKs). The increase in AQP3 mRNA by PPARgamma activator occurs in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Increased AQP3 mRNA levels are accompanied by an increase in AQP3 protein in undifferentiated keratinocytes and a significant increase in glycerol uptake. Activation of LXR, RAR and RXR also increases AQP3 mRNA levels in undifferentiated and differentiated CHKs, but to a lesser extent. PPARdelta activation stimulates AQP3 expression in undifferentiated CHKs but decreases expression in differentiated CHKs. In contrast, PPARalpha activators do not alter AQP3 expression. AQP9 and AQP10, other members of aquaglyceroporin family, are less abundantly expressed in CHKs, and their expression levels are not significantly altered by treatment with LXR, PPAR, RAR or RXR activators. Finally, when topically applied, the PPARgamma activator, ciglitazone, induces AQP3 but not AQP9 gene expression in mouse epidermis. Our data demonstrate that PPAR and LXR activators stimulate AQP3 expression, providing an additional mechanism by which PPAR and LXR activators regulate epidermal function.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) play a critical role in regulating lipid synthesis and transport in numerous tissues. In the skin, activation of LXR induces keratinocyte differentiation and improves epidermal permeability barrier homeostasis. To elucidate the mechanism of LXR action in skin, we mapped its cistrome by identifying LXRβ-RXRα binding sites using ChIP-on-chip in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs). The cistrome was integrated with transcription data to obtain a global view of LXR action in keratinocyte biology. Here, we identify 2035 LXRβ-RXRα binding sites containing 4794 LXR response elements in NHEKs and show the presence of consensus heterodimer active regions in genes involved in keratinocyte lipid transport/synthesis and terminal differentiation. Bioinformatics analysis of the cistrome revealed an enrichment of AP1 cis-regulatory motifs in the vicinity of the LXRβ-RXRα binding sites. Importantly, we have demonstrated a direct interaction between LXR and Jun/Fos, indicating that the cooperation between LXR and AP1 may orchestrate keratinocyte differentiation. Finally, we corroborated these results by genome-wide mapping of the c-Fos and c-Jun cistromes in NHEKs, demonstrating that 77% of all the LXRβ-RXRα binding regions show the presence of AP1 motifs at adjacent locations. Our findings provide new insight into the mechanism of LXR action in keratinocyte differentiation, lipid production and barrier formation, further strengthening the validation of LXR as a potential therapeutic target for skin disorders including skin aging, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis.
Nuclear receptors (NR) are a superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors that control a range of cellular processes. Persistent stimulation of some NR is a non-genotoxic mechanism of rodent liver cancer with unclear relevance to humans. Here we report on a systematic analysis of new in vitro human NR activity data on 309 environmental chemicals in relationship to their liver cancer-related chronic outcomes in rodents.
The effects of 309 environmental chemicals on human constitutive androstane receptors (CAR/NR1I3), pregnane X receptor (PXR/NR1I2), aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR/NR1C), liver X receptors (LXR/NR1H), retinoic X receptors (RXR/NR2B) and steroid receptors (SR/NR3) were determined using in vitro data. Hepatic histopathology, observed in rodents after two years of chronic treatment for 171 of the 309 chemicals, was summarized by a cancer lesion progression grade. Chemicals that caused proliferative liver lesions in both rat and mouse were generally more active for the human receptors, relative to the compounds that only affected one rodent species, and these changes were significant for PPAR (p0.001), PXR (p0.01) and CAR (p0.05). Though most chemicals exhibited receptor promiscuity, multivariate analysis clustered them into relatively few NR activity combinations. The human NR activity pattern of chemicals weakly associated with the severity of rodent liver cancer lesion progression (p0.05).
The rodent carcinogens had higher in vitro potency for human NR relative to non-carcinogens. Structurally diverse chemicals with similar NR promiscuity patterns weakly associated with the severity of rodent liver cancer progression. While these results do not prove the role of NR activation in human liver cancer, they do have implications for nuclear receptor chemical biology and provide insights into putative toxicity pathways. More importantly, these findings suggest the utility of in vitro assays for stratifying environmental contaminants based on a combination of human bioactivity and rodent toxicity.
Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL) is a rare, genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive immune disorder that results when the critical regulatory pathways that mediate immune defense mechanisms and the natural termination of immune/inflammatory responses are disrupted or overwhelmed. To advance the understanding of FHL, we performed gene expression profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 11 children with untreated FHL. Total RNA was isolated and gene expression levels were determined using microarray analysis. Comparisons between patients with FHL and normal pediatric controls (n = 30) identified 915 down-regulated and 550 up-regulated genes with more than or equal to 2.5-fold difference in expression (P ≤ .05). The expression of genes associated with natural killer cell functions, innate and adaptive immune responses, proapoptotic proteins, and B- and T-cell differentiation were down-regulated in patients with FHL. Genes associated with the canonical pathways of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10 IL-1, IL-8, TREM1, LXR/RXR activation, and PPAR signaling and genes encoding of antiapoptotic proteins were overexpressed in patients with FHL. This first study of genome-wide expression profiling in children with FHL demonstrates the complexity of gene expression patterns, which underlie the immunobiology of FHL.
The nuclear receptor retinoid X receptor (RXR) functions potently in the regulation of homeostasis and cell development, while rexinoids as RXR agonists have proved their therapeutic potential in the treatment of metabolic diseases and cancer. Here, the natural product bigelovin was identified as a selective RXRα agonist. Interestingly, this compound could not transactivate RXRα:RXRα homodimer but could enhance the transactivation of RXRα:peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ heterodimer and repress that of RXRα:liver X receptor (LXR) α heterodimer, while it had no effects on RXRα:farnesoid X receptor heterodimer. Considering that the effective role of LXR response element involved transactivation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c mediated by RXRα:LXRα in triglyceride elevation, such LXR response element repressing by bigelovin has obviously addressed its potency for further research. Moreover, our determined crystal structure of the bigelovin-activated RXRα ligand-binding domain with the coactivator human steroid receptor coactivator-1 peptide revealed that bigelovin adopted a distinct binding mode. Compared with the known RXR ligands, bigelovin lacks the acidic moiety in structure, which indicated that the acidic moiety rendered little effects on RXR activation. Our results have thereby provided new insights into the structure-based selective rexinoids design with bigelovin as a potential lead compound.
Organotins, including tri-butyltin chloride (TBTC), are widely used in agricultural and chemical industries and cause persistent and widespread pollution. TBTC has been shown to activate nuclear receptor retinoid X receptor (RXR)/PPARγ signaling by interacting with RXR to modulate adipogenesis. However, whether TBTC affects liver X receptor (LXR)/RXR activity and subsequently the expression of cholesterol mobilizing genes is not known. In this study, we evaluated the ability of TBTC to activate LXR/RXR and ABC transporter A1 (ABCA1) expression. ABCA1 plays a critical role in HDL generation, maintaining cholesterol homeostasis, and cholesterol accumulation-induced diseases, such as atherosclerosis and pancreatic islet dysfunction. In a reporter gene assay, TBTC activated LXRα/RXR but not LXRβ/RXR. In mouse macrophage RAW264 cells, TBTC activated the ABCA1 promoter in an LXR-responsive element dependent manner and increased ABCA1 mRNA expression. TBTC augmented ABCA1 protein levels and apolipoprotein A-I-dependent cellular cholesterol efflux (HDL generation). The LXR-target fatty acid synthase and Spα mRNA levels were also increased by TBTC exposure. We conclude that TBTC has the ability to activate permissive LXRα/RXR signaling and thereby modulate cellular cholesterol efflux.
Earlier it was shown that male mice of the DD/He strain were highly susceptible to ortho-aminoasotoluene (OAT) induced hepatocarcinogenesis, and resistant to spontaneous liver tumor development as compared to the CC57BR/Mv strain. In the present work we have made a comparative investigation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), liver X-receptor (LXR) and retinoic X-receptor (RXR) mRNA levels in liver as well as concentrations of corticosterone, glucose, lipids and insulin in blood of male DD/He and CC57BR/Mv mice. Using the multiplex RT-PCR method it was found that PPAR-alpha, PPAR-gamma, RXR-alpha and RXR-beta mRNA content was essentially decreased in the liver of DD mice as compared to mice of the CC57BR strain. No significant interstrain differences of LXR-alpha and LXR-beta mRNA content were found. In DD micetere was more then the 3-fold decrease of blood content of corticosterone, which is involved in PPAR and RXR regulation. DD mice demonstrated a significant decrease in blood serum glucose and insulin concentrations as well as higher reactivity to insulin as compared with CC57BR mice. Elevated blood total cholesterol and cholesterol HDL level were found in DD mice whereas triglyceride content was basically the same in both mouse strains. It is known that glucocorticoids, PPAR and RXR play crucial role in transcription regulation of inflammation response. Therefore our data allow to suggest that decreased corticosterone level in blood, PPAR and RXR mRNA content in liver of the DD strain may lead to induction of inflammation by OAT exposure, resulting in a high incidence of tumorigenesis in this strain.
Retinoid X receptors (RXRs) are heterodimerization partners for many nuclear receptors and also act as homodimers. Heterodimers formed by RXR and a nonpermissive partner, e.g. retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and vitamin D receptor (VDR), can be activated only by the agonist of the partner receptor. In contrast, heterodimers that contain permissive partners, e.g. liver X receptor (LXR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), can be activated by agonists for either the partner receptor or RXR, raising the possibility of pleiotropic RXR signaling. However, it is not known to what extent the receptor's activation results in triggering mechanisms dependent or independent of permissive heterodimers. In this study, we systematically and quantitatively characterized all probable RXR-signaling pathways in differentiating human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs). Using pharmacological, microarray and quantitative RT-PCR techniques, we identified and characterized gene sets regulated by RXR agonists (LG100268 and 9-cis retinoic acid) and agonists for LXRs, PPARs, RARα, and VDR. Our results demonstrated that permissiveness was partially impaired in Mo-DCs, because a large number of genes regulated by PPAR or LXR agonists was not affected by RXR-specific agonists or was regulated to a lesser extent. As expected, we found that RXR agonists regulated only small portions of RARα or VDR targets. Importantly, we could identify and characterize PPAR- and LXR-independent pathways in Mo-DCs most likely mediated by RXR homodimers. These data suggested that RXR signaling in Mo-DCs was mediated via multiple permissive heterodimers and also by mechanism(s) independent of permissive heterodimers, and it was controlled in a cell-type and gene-specific manner.
Liver X receptor (LXR)/retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimers have been shown to perform critical functions in cholesterol and lipid metabolism. Here, we have conducted a comparative analysis of the contributions of LXR and RXR binding to steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1), which contains three copies of the NR box. We demonstrated that the coactivator-binding surface of LXR, but not that of RXR, is critically important for physical and functional interactions with SRC-1, thereby confirming that RXR functions as an allosteric activator of SRC-1-LXR interaction. Notably, we identified NR box-2 and -3 as the essential binding targets for the SRC-1-induced stimulation of LXR transactivity, and observed the competitive in vitro binding of NR box-2 and -3 to LXR.
Retinoid X receptors (RXRs) function as homo- or heterodimers with other nuclear receptors, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), which are targets for treatment of hyperlipidemia and type 2 diabetes, or liver X receptors (LXRs), which are involved in glucose/lipid metabolism. PPAR/RXR or LXR/RXR are known as permissive RXR-heterodimers because they are activated by RXR agonists alone. Interestingly, the pattern of RXR-heterodimer activation is different depending on the RXR agonist structure, but the structure-activity relationship has not been reported. Here we show that modification or replacement of the carboxyl group in the acidic domain of RXR agonists has little or no effect on permissive RXR-heterodimer activation. Phosphonic acid (9), tetrazole (10), and hydroxamic acid (12) analogues were synthesized from the common bromo intermediate 7. Except for 9, these compounds showed RXR full-agonistic activities in the concentration range of 1-10 microM. The order of agonistic activity toward both PPARgamma/RXRalpha and LXRalpha/RXRalpha was the same as it was for RXR, that is, 11&gt;10&gt;12. These results should be useful for the development of RXR agonists with improved bioavailability.
TG-interacting factor (Tgif1) represses gene expression by interaction with general corepressors, and can be recruited to target genes by transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) activated Smads, or by the retinoid X receptor (RXR). Here we show that Tgif1 interacts with the LXRα nuclear receptor and can repress transcription from a synthetic reporter activated by LXRα. In cultured cells reducing endogenous Tgif1 levels resulted in increased expression of LXRα target genes. To test the in vivo role of Tgif1, we analyzed LXRα-dependent gene expression in mice lacking Tgif1. In the livers of Tgif1 null mice, we observed significant derepression of the apolipoprotein genes, Apoa4 and Apoc2, suggesting that Tgif1 is an important in vivo regulator of apolipoprotein gene expression. In contrast, we observed relatively minimal effects on expression of other LXR target genes. This work suggests that Tgif1 can regulate nuclear receptor complexes, in addition to those containing retinoic acid receptors, but also indicates that there is some specificity to which NR target genes are repressed by Tgif1.
We studied the effects of cholesterol, its oxidized derivatives mevalonate, and nuclear receptor agonists LXR, RXR, and FXR on the production of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF- beta1) by macrophages. After recruiting of macrophage monocytes into the focus of inflammation, the production of TGF-beta1 increased by 3.5 times in comparison with control macrophages. Cholesterol diet stimulated the production of TGF-beta1 by 2.5 times. Cholesterol directly stimulated macrophage production of TGF-beta1 in vitro, while addition of mevalonate to the incubation medium effectively reduced this induced production. Agonists of nuclear receptor sharply reduced the production of TGF-beta1 in recruited macrophages. Under conditions of inflammation, hypercholesterolemia can be a factor of fibrogenesis due to TGF-beta1 induction in macrophages, which depends on the products of mevalonate biochemical chain.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are nuclear receptors that are central regulators of cholesterol homeostasis, and synthetic LXR agonists have shown promise as promoters of reverse cholesterol transport and anti-inflammatory agents. Here, we present three X-ray structures of three different agonists bound to the ligand binding domain of LXRalpha. These compounds are GW3965, F(3)methylAA, and a benzisoxazole urea, and we show that these diverse chemical scaffolds address common structural themes, leading to high binding affinity for LXR. Our structures show the LXRalpha ligand binding domain in its homodimeric form, an arrangement previously thought to be stereochemically difficult. A comparison with existing structures of the LXRbeta homodimer and LXRalpha:RXR (retinoid X receptor) heterodimers explains differences in dimer affinity and leads us to propose a model for allosteric activation in nuclear receptor dimers, in which an unactivated RXR partner provides an inhibitory tail wrap to the cofactor binding pocket of LXR.
To determine whether arsenic inhibits transcriptional activation of the liver X receptor (LXR)/retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimers, thereby impairing cholesterol efflux from macrophages and potentially contributing to a proatherogenic phenotype.
Arsenic is an important environmental contaminant and has been linked to an increased incidence of atherosclerosis. Previous findings showed that arsenic inhibits transcriptional activation of type 2 nuclear receptors, known to heterodimerize with RXR. Environmentally relevant arsenic doses decrease the LXR/RXR ligand-induced expression of the LXR target genes (ABCA1 and SREBP-1c). Arsenic failed to decrease cAMP-induced ABCA1 expression, suggesting a selective LXR/RXR effect. This selectivity correlated with the ability of arsenic to decrease LXR/RXR ligand-induced, but not cAMP-induced, cholesterol efflux. By using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we found that arsenic inhibits the ability of LXR/RXR ligands to induce activation markers on the ABCA1 and SREBP-1c promoters and blocks ligand-induced release of the nuclear receptor coexpressor (NCoR) from the promoter. Arsenic did not alter the ability of LXR to transrepress inflammatory gene transcription, further supporting our hypothesis that RXR is the target for arsenic inhibition.
Exposure to arsenic enhances the risk of atherosclerosis. We present data that arsenic inhibits the transcriptional activity of the liver X receptor, resulting in decreased cholesterol-induced gene expression and efflux from macrophages. Therefore, arsenic may promote an athersclerotic environment by decreasing the ability of macrophages to efflux excess cholesterol, thereby favoring increased plaque formation.
Thyroid hormone receptor (TR) and liver X-receptor (LXR) are the master regulators of lipid metabolism. Remarkably, a mouse with a targeted deletion of both LXR alpha and LXR beta is resistant to western diet-induced obesity, and exhibits ectopic liver expression of the thyroid hormone activating type 2 deiodinase (D2). We hypothesized that LXR/retinoid X-receptor (RXR) signaling inhibits hepatic D2 expression, and studied this using a luciferase reporter containing the human DIO2 (hDIO2) promoter in HepG2 cells. Given that, in contrast to mammals, the chicken liver normally expresses D2, the chicken DIO2 (cDIO2) promoter was also studied. 22(R)-OH-cholesterol negatively regulated hDIO2 in a dose-dependent manner (100 microM, approximately twofold), while it failed to affect the cDIO2 promoter. Truncations in the hDIO2 promoter identified the region -901 to -584 bp as critical for negative regulation. We also investigated if 9-cis retinoic acid (9-cis RA), the ligand for the heterodimeric partner of TR and LXR, RXR, could regulate the hDIO2 promoter. Notably, 9-cis RA repressed the hDIO2 luciferase reporter (1 microM, approximately fourfold) in a dose-dependent manner, while coexpression of an inactive mutant RXR abolished this effect. However, it is unlikely that RXR homodimers mediate the repression of hDIO2 since mutagenesis of a DR-1 at -506 bp did not interfere with 9-cis RA-mediated repression. Our data indicate that hDIO2 transcription is negatively regulated by both 22(R)-OH-cholesterol and 9-cis RA, which is consistent with LXR/RXR involvement. In vivo, the inhibition of D2-mediated tri-iodothyronine (T(3)) production by cholesterol/9-cis RA could function as a feedback loop, given that T(3) decreases hepatic cholesterol levels.
LXR is another member of the superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors that heterodimerizes with RXR and regulates the intracellular levels of cholesterol through gene induction of enzymes and proteins involved in the cholesterol metabolism and transport. LXR ligands inhibit the gene expression of proinflammatory mediators in immunostimulated macrophages; in vivo studies have shown that activation of LXR reduces the inflammatory response in a murine model of contact dermatitis and atherosclerosis. No reports have addressed a role for LXRs in pathophysiology of intestinal ischemia. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of T0901317, a potent LXR ligand, in a mouse model of SAO shock, which was induced by clamping the superior mesenteric artery and the celiac trunk, resulting in a total occlusion of these arteries for 30 min. After this period of occlusion, the clamps were removed. Mice were killed at 60 min after reperfusion. This study provides the evidence that T0901317, LXR agonist, modulates: the development of SAO shock; the infiltration of the tissue with PMNs; the expression of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta; the nitration of tyrosine residues; NF-kappaB expression; the MAPK phosphorylation (ERK, JNK, and p38); FasL; apoptosis; Bax and Bcl-2 expression; and the degree of tissue injury caused by SAO shock. Our results imply that LXR agonists may be useful in the therapy of inflammation.
ATP binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1) is a membrane half-transporter which is the member of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter super-family, it has an important role of regulating the cholesterol and phospholipids effluence. ABCG1 and ABCA1 synergize to mediate cholesterol effluence to HDL (high density lipoprotein). The expression of ABCG1 is mainly regulated by the liver X receptor/the lactochrome receptor system (LXR/RXR). Although the ABCG1 plays an important role in balancing the lipids, its role in cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the animal studies is still controversial. The issue focuses the ABCG1 on the structure, the function, the regulation and the contribution to CVD.
Bexarotene (Targretin) is a clinically used antitumoral agent which exerts its action through binding to and activation of the retinoid-X-receptor (RXR). The most frequent side-effect of bexarotene administration is an increase in plasma triglycerides, an independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease. The molecular mechanism behind this hypertriglyceridemia remains poorly understood.
Using wild-type and LXR alpha/beta-deficient mice, we show here that bexarotene induces hypertriglyceridemia and activates hepatic LXR-target genes of lipogenesis in an LXR-dependent manner, hence exerting a permissive effect on RXR/LXR heterodimers. Interestingly, RNA analysis and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation assays performed in the liver reveal that the in vivo permissive effect of bexarotene on the RXR/LXR heterodimer is restricted to lipogenic genes without modulation of genes controlling cholesterol homeostasis.
These findings demonstrate that the hypertriglyceridemic action of bexarotene occurs via the RXR/LXR heterodimer and show that RXR heterodimers can act with a selective permissivity on target genes of specific metabolic pathways in the liver.
Astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1), also known as MTDH (metadherin) or LYRIC, is an established oncogene. However, the physiological function of AEG-1 is not known. To address this question, we generated an AEG-1 knock-out mouse (AEG-1KO) and characterized it. Although AEG-1KO mice were viable and fertile, they were significantly leaner with prominently less body fat and lived significantly longer compared with wild type (WT). When fed a high fat and cholesterol diet (HFD), WT mice rapidly gained weight, whereas AEG-1KO mice did not gain weight at all. This phenotype of AEG-1KO mice is due to decreased fat absorption from the intestines, not because of decreased fat synthesis or increased fat consumption. AEG-1 interacts with retinoid X receptor (RXR) and inhibits RXR function. In enterocytes of AEG-1KO mice, we observed increased activity of RXR heterodimer partners, liver X receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α, key inhibitors of intestinal fat absorption. Inhibition of fat absorption in AEG-1KO mice was further augmented when fed an HFD providing ligands to liver X receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α. Our studies reveal a novel role of AEG-1 in regulating nuclear receptors controlling lipid metabolism. AEG-1 may significantly modulate the effects of HFD and thereby function as a unique determinant of obesity. 
The transcription of the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) gene, which plays a key anti-atherogenic role, is known to be induced by agonists of liver X receptors (LXRs). LXRs form obligate heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and interact with their recognition sequences in the regulatory regions of key genes implicated in the control of cholesterol, fatty acid and glucose homeostasis. We have previously shown a novel role for c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in the LXRs-mediated induction of macrophage gene expression. Protein kinase C (PKC) is often found to regulate the action of nuclear receptors and cross talk between this kinase family and JNK and/or PI3K has been shown in several settings. We have therefore investigated a potential role for PKC in the action of LXR/RXR agonist 22-(R)-hydroxycholesterol (22-(R)-HC)/9-cis-retinoic acid (9cRA) in THP-1 macrophages, including the induction of ABCA1 expression. The pan PKC inhibitor bisindoylmaleimide was found to attenuate the induction of ABCA1 protein expression, the activation of the JNK signaling pathway and the stimulation of activator protein-1 (AP-1) DNA binding activity in macrophages treated with 22-(R)-HC and 9cRA. The role of PKC in the action of these ligands was confirmed further by the use of more isotype-specific inhibitors. These studies therefore reveal a potentially important role for PKC in the action of 22-(R)-HC and 9cRA in human macrophages. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia characterized by synaptic dysfunction, memory loss, neuroinflammation, and neuronal cell death. Amyloid-β (Aβ), recognized as the main culprit of AD, aggregates and accumulates in the extracellular compartment as neuritic plaques, after deregulation of its production or clearance. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) plays a major role in Aβ clearance and its expression is transcriptionally regulated by the liver X receptor and retinoid X receptors (RXRs) system. Bexarotene (BEXA), an RXR agonist that increases ApoE expression and microglia phagocytosis has been proposed as a promising therapy for AD, resolving both the amyloid pathology and memory loss. Despite the first compelling report, however, multiple failures have been documented, raising concern about whether BEXA could in fact become a novel disease-modifying strategy for AD. To help clarify this, we investigated the effect of BEXA in vivo at multiple levels in TASTPM transgenic mice. Seven-day oral administration of BEXA to these mice did not achieve any significant memory improvement, plaque reduction, or enhancement of microglial cell activation. No differences were found when specifically investigating the microglial phagocytic state in vivo. In addition, a brain structural analysis with magnetic resonance did not detect any BEXA-mediated change in the volume reduction of the main affected brain areas in our mice. These results suggest that BEXA has no beneficial effects on the multi-factorial pathologic phenotype of AD mice. 
Enolase is a glycolytic enzyme known to inhibit cholesteryl ester hydrolases (CEHs). Cholesteryl ester loading of macrophages, as occurs during atherosclerosis, is accompanied by increased Enolase protein and activity. Here, we describe that J774 macrophages treated with LXR agonists exhibit reduced Enolase transcript and protein abundance. Moreover, we show that this reduction is further potentiated by activation of the LXR/RXR heterodimer with the RXR ligand 9-cis retinoic acid. Enolase levels are also reduced in vivo following activation of LXRs in the intestine, but not in the liver. This effect is lost in Lxrαβ-/- mice. In aggregate, our study identified Enolase as a new target of LXRs in vivo, which may promote cholesterol mobilization for subsequent efflux. 
We review trialkyltin and triaryltin compounds, representing a class of organometallic compounds that function as nuclear retinoid X receptors (RXR) agonists due to their capability to bind to the ligand-binding domain of RXR subtypes and function as transcriptional activators. RXRs act predominantly as heterodimers with other nuclear receptors as permissive heterodimers with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, liver X receptors, farnesoid X receptor, pregnane X receptor and constitutive androstan receptor or as non-permissive heterodimer with vitamin D receptor, and as conditional heterodimers with retinoid receptors, and thyroid hormone receptors. RXR - "partner" receptor heterodimers are considered to be ligand-activated, DNA-binding, trans-acting, transcription-modulating proteins involved in a general molecular mechanism responsible for transcriptional responses in target genes. Tributyltin at even pico- or nanomolar concentrations may cause the superimposition of male genitalia on female in several aquatic organisms, since they are DNA-targeted, mitotic, and their actions are occurring through target gene(s)-mediated pathways. They may cause molecular interactions with reproductive system in mammals, and as potent environmental obesogens, they promote adipocyte differentiation. Organotin compounds become known also for their immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity, for their effects on reproduction and/or development. We also review effects of organotins with respect to levels and activities of hepatic P450s and aromatase activity. 
Reversing the escalating rate of obesity requires increased knowledge of the molecular mechanisms controlling energy balance. Liver X receptors (LXRs) and thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) are key physiological regulators of energetic metabolism. Analysing interactions between these receptors in the periphery has led to a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in metabolic diseases. However, no data is available on such interactions in the brain. We tested the hypothesis that hypothalamic LXR/TR interactions could co-regulate signalling pathways involved in the central regulation of metabolism. Using in vivo gene transfer we show that LXR activation by its synthetic agonist GW3965 represses the transcriptional activity of two key metabolic genes, Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (Trh) and Melanocortin receptor type 4 (Mc4r) in the hypothalamus of euthyroid mice. Interestingly, this repression did not occur in hypothyroid mice but was restored in the case of Trh by thyroid hormone (TH) treatment, highlighting the role of the triiodothyronine (T3) and TRs in this dialogue. Using shLXR to knock-down LXRs in vivo in euthyroid newborn mice, not only abrogated Trh repression but actually increased Trh transcription, revealing a potential inhibitory effect of LXR on the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Thyroid axis. In vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) revealed LXR to be present on the Trh promoter region in the presence of T3 and that Retinoid X Receptor (RXR), a heterodimerization partner for both TR and LXR, was never recruited simultaneously with LXR. Interactions between the TR and LXR pathways were confirmed by qPCR experiments. T3 treatment of newborn mice induced hypothalamic expression of certain key LXR target genes implicated in metabolism and inflammation. Taken together the results indicate that the crosstalk between LXR and TR signalling in the hypothalamus centres on metabolic and inflammatory pathways. 
The retinoid X receptor (RXR) partners with numerous nuclear receptors, such as the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) family, liver X receptors (LXRs), and farnesoid X receptor (FXR). Although each heterodimer can be activated by specific ligands, a subset of these receptors, defined as permissive nuclear receptors, can also be activated by RXR agonists known as rexinoids. Many individual RXR heterodimers have beneficial effects in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Because rexinoids can potently activate multiple RXR pathways, we hypothesized that treating SMCs with rexinoids would more effectively reverse the pathophysiologic effects of angiotensin II than an individual heterodimer agonist. Cultured rat aortic SMCs were pretreated with either an RXR agonist (bexarotene or 9-cis retinoic acid) or vehicle (dimethylsulfoxide) for 24 hours before stimulation with angiotensin II. Compared with dimethylsulfoxide, bexarotene blocked angiotensin II-induced SM contractile gene induction (calponin and smooth muscle-α-actin) and protein synthesis ([(3)H]leucine incorporation). Bexarotene also decreased angiotensin II-mediated inflammation, as measured by decreased expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). Activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase but not extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) or protein kinase B (Akt) was also blunted by bexarotene. We compared bexarotene to five agonists of nuclear receptors (PPARα, PPARγ, PPARδ, LXR, and FXR). Bexarotene had a greater effect on calponin reduction, MCP-1 inhibition, and p38 MAP kinase inhibition than any individual agonist. PPARγ knockout cells demonstrated blunted responses to bexarotene, indicating that PPARγ is necessary for the effects of bexarotene. These data demonstrate that RXR is a potent modulator of angiotensin II-mediated responses in the vasculature, partially through inhibition of p38. 
The retinoid X receptor (RXR) plays a critical role in transcriptional regulation via formation of an RXR homodimer or heterodimers with partner nuclear receptors. Despite the numerous beneficial effects, only a limited number of naturally occurring RXR agonists are known. In this report, two prenylated flavanones (1 and 2) isolated from Sophora tonkinensis were identified as new rexinoids that preferentially activated RXRs, relative to the retinoic acid receptor. The activities of 1 and 2 were the most potent among naturally occurring rexinoids, yet 2 orders of magnitude lower than the synthetic rexinoid bexarotene. Compounds 1 and 2 activated particular RXR heterodimers in a manner similar to bexarotene. A microarray assay followed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses on RNAs isolated from C2C12 myotubes treated with 1 or 2 demonstrated that they significantly increased mRNA levels of lipoprotein lipase, angiopoietin-like protein 4, and heme oxygenase-1. In contrast, bexarotene preferentially potentiated transcription of genes involved in lipogenesis and lipid metabolism such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1, fatty acid synthase, and apolipoprotein D by a liver X receptor agonist. In this study, we have demonstrated that two newly identified naturally occurring rexinoids, 1 and 2, possess properties different from bexarotene. 
ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) mediates cholesterol efflux to lipid-free apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and apolipoprotein E (apoE). ABCA1 is an essential regulator of high density lipoproteins (HDL) and reverse cholesterol transport - a role that determines its importance for atherosclerosis. Over the last 10 years studies have provided convincing evidence that ABCA1, via its control of apoE lipidation, also has a role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). A series of reports have revealed a significant impact of ABCA1 on Aβ deposition and clearance in AD model mice, as well as an association of common and rare ABCA1 gene variants with the risk for AD. Since APOE is the major genetic risk factor for late onset AD, the regulation of apoE level or its functionality by ABCA1 may prove significant for AD pathogenesis. ABCA1 is transcriptionally regulated by Liver X Receptors (LXR) and Retinoic X Receptors (RXR) which provides a starting point for drug discovery and development of synthetic LXR and RXR agonists for treatment of metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders. This review summarizes the recent results of research on ABCA1, particularly relevant to atherosclerosis and AD.
Abstract Milk fat synthesis of ruminants can be inhibited by intermediates of ruminal fatty acid biohydrogenation including trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA). These biohydrogenation intermediates signal a coordinated downregulation of genes involved in mammary FA synthesis, transport, and esterification. We have previously reported decreased mammary expression of sterol response element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), SREBP1-activating proteins, and thyroid hormone-responsive spot 14 (S14) in the cow during diet-induced milk fat depression (MFD), and treatment with trans-10, cis-12 CLA. Liver x receptors (LXR) and retinoid x receptors (RXR) regulate lipogenesis and are known to bind polyunsaturated FA and LXR agonist increases lipid synthesis in mammary epithelial cell culture. The current studies investigated if biohydrogenation products of rumen origin inhibit mammary lipogenesis through LXR and/or RXR. Expression of LXRs was not different in lactating compared to nonlactating bovine mammary tissue, and expression of LXRs, RXRα, and selected LXR and RXR target genes was not changed in mammary tissue during diet-induced or CLA-induced MFD in the cow. In bovine mammary epithelial cell culture, LXR agonist stimulated lipogenesis and expression of LXRß, ATP-binding cassette 1 (ABCA1), SREBP1c, and S14, but LXR activation did not overcome CLA inhibition of lipogenesis and downregulation of LXRß, SREBP1c, and S14 expression. Lastly, expression of the LXR-regulated carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP) was higher in lactating than nonlactating tissue and was decreased during CLA-induced MFD. We conclude that changes in mammary LXR expression in dairy cows are not involved in MFD and that trans-10, cis-12 CLA inhibition of lipogenesis and diet-induced MFD appears independent of direct LXR signaling. 
Retinoid X receptors (RXRs) are nuclear receptors that act as ligand-dependent transcription factors. RXRs function as homodimers or as heterodimers with other nuclear receptors, such as retinoic acid receptors, PPARs, liver X receptors, farnesoid X receptor, vitamin D receptor or thyroid hormone receptors. RXR ligands (agonists or antagonists) show various physiological effects, depending on their partner receptors. RXR agonist bexarotene (Targretin®) is used for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in clinical practice. RXR agonists were also reported to be useful for treatment of type 2 diabetes, autoimmune disease and Alzheimer's disease. RXR antagonists were also reported to be effective in type 2 diabetes treatment.
Here patent applications (2007 - 2013) concerning RXR ligands are summarized, and the usefulness of RXR ligands as pharmaceutical agents is discussed.
RXR agonists show a wide variety of biological effects. However, they cause serious side effects, such as blood triglyceride elevation, hypothyroidism and others. Thus, for clinical application of RXR agonists, abrogation of these side effects is required. RXR heterodimer-selective agonists and RXR partial agonists exhibiting desired effects without side effects are expected to find clinical application.
MafB is a transcription factor that induces myelomonocytic differentiation. However, the precise role of MafB in the pathogenic function of macrophages has never been clarified. Here we demonstrate that MafB promotes hyperlipidemic atherosclerosis by suppressing foam-cell apoptosis. Our data show that MafB is predominantly expressed in foam cells found within atherosclerotic lesions, where MafB mediates the oxidized LDL-activated LXR/RXR-induced expression of apoptosis inhibitor of macrophages (AIM). In the absence of MafB, activated LXR/RXR fails to induce the expression of AIM, a protein that is normally responsible for protecting macrophages from apoptosis; thus, Mafb-deficient macrophages are prone to apoptosis. Haematopoietic reconstitution with Mafb-deficient fetal liver cells in recipient LDL receptor-deficient hyperlipidemic mice revealed accelerated foam-cell apoptosis, which subsequently led to the attenuation of the early atherogenic lesion. These findings represent the first evidence that the macrophage-affiliated MafB transcription factor participates in the acceleration of atherogenesis. 
Stimulation of the liver X receptor (LXR) is associated with anti-inflammatory and vascular-protective effects under hyperlipemic conditions. We examined whether LXR stimulation influences TNF-α-induced endothelial dysfunction under normolipemic conditions. Endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation of aortic rings was determined in an organ water bath. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were exposed to TNF-α (10 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of 5 μM of the LXR agonist T0901317 or GW3965 and changes in TNF-α-induced endothelial cell apoptosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, and NO metabolism were analyzed. T0901317 improved TNF-α-impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation of aortic rings in response to acetylcholine. T0901317 decreased the TNF-α-induced apoptosis and inflammation as indicated by a decrease in caspase 3/7 activity, VCAM-1 mRNA expression and subsequent mononuclear cell adhesion. Furthermore, T0901317 reduced the expression of the oxidative stress markers: AT1R, NOX4, and p22phox and normalized the TNF-α-induced NOX activity to basal levels. In line with the reduced AT1R expression, T0901317 impaired the Ang II responsiveness. T0901317 influenced NO metabolism as indicated by a decrease in TNF-α-upregulated arginase activity, a reversal of TNF-α-induced downregulation of argininosuccinate synthase mRNA expression and eNOS expression to basal levels and a raise in NO production. Furthermore, T0901317 decreased the TNF-α-induced superoxide and nitrotyrosine production, but did not upregulate the TNF-α-downregulated eNOS dimer/monomer ratio. Silencing of LXRβ, but not of LXRα, abrogated the anti-apoptotic effects of T0901317. We conclude that LXR agonism improves TNF-α-impaired endothelial function via its anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidative properties and its capacity to restore TNF-α-impaired NO bioavailability independent of its cholesterol-modulating effects. 
Cerebral hypoperfusion or aging often results into the disturbances of cholesterol and lipoprotein, which have been tightly associated with numerous neurological and psychiatric diseases, such as vascular dementia. The pathway of liver X receptor-β (LXR-β)/retinoic X receptor-α (RXR-α)/ABCA1 plays a vital role in lipoprotein metabolism. However, there were no reports about the relationship between the signal molecules of the pathway and lipoprotein homeostasis in cerebral hypoperfusion models. Therefore, we aimed to detect the expression of the pathway molecules in the aging rat models of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion and to explore its underlying mechanism. The model with cerebral hypoperfusion was established by ligating of the bilateral common carotid arteries (2VO). The temporal blood flow in the model rats was significantly decreased 14 d, 21 d and 28 d after 2VO compared with the control. The serum levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and total cholesterol (TC) were reached a peak at 14 d, then, they were gradually decreased. The changes of LXR-β, RXR-α, ABCA1 and apolipoprotein A1 (apo A1) of the pathway were consistent with the changes of HDL and TC. We conclude that LXR-β/RXR-α/ABCA1 and downstream genes apo A1 undergo dynamic changes during the process of cerebral hypoperfusion. The LXR-β/RXR-α/ABCA1 mediated apo A1 cholesterol may play a protective effect, and the effect only exists in a certain period of time. 
Apoptosis inhibitor of macrophages (AIM), a scavenger protein secreted by tissue macrophages, is transcriptionally regulated by the nuclear receptor Liver X Receptor (LXR) and Retinoid X Receptor (RXR) heterodimer. Given that LXR exerts a protective immune response against M. tuberculosis, here we analyzed whether AIM is involved in this response. In an experimental murine model of tuberculosis, AIM serum levels peaked dramatically early after infection with M. tuberculosis, providing an in vivo biological link to the disease. We therefore studied the participation of AIM in macrophage response to M. tuberculosis in vitro. For this purpose, we used the H37Rv strain to infect THP-1 macrophages transfected to stably express AIM, thereby increasing infected macrophage survival. Furthermore, the expression of this protein enlarged foam cell formation by enhancing intracellular lipid content. Phagocytosis assays with FITC-labeled M. tuberculosis bacilli indicated that this protein was not involved in bacterial uptake; however, AIM expression decreased the number of intracellular cfus by up to 70% in bacterial killing assays, suggesting that AIM enhances macrophage mycobactericidal activity. Accordingly, M. tuberculosis-infected AIM-expressing cells upregulated the production of reactive oxygen species. Moreover, real-time PCR analysis showed increased mRNA levels of the antimicrobial peptides cathelicidin and defensin 4B. These increases were concomitant with greater cellular concentrations of the autophagy-related molecules Beclin 1 and LC3II, as well as enhanced acidification of mycobacterial phagosomes and LC3 co-localization. In summary, our data support the notion that AIM contributes to key macrophage responses to M. tuberculosis. 
Cerebral hypoperfusion or aging often results in the disturbances of cholesterol and lipoprotein, which have been well depicted as a common pathological status contributing to neurodegenerative diseases such as vascular dementia (VaD) and Alzheimer's dementia (AD). The pathway of the liver X receptor-β (LXR-β)/retinoic X receptor-α (RXR-α)/ABCA1 plays a vital role in lipoprotein metabolism. Curcumin, a kind of phenolic compound, has been widely used. It has been reported that curcumin can reduce the levels of cholesterol in serum, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated the effects of curcumin on the cholesterol level in brain, vascular cognitive impairment and explored whether the mechanisms for those effects are through activating LXR-β/RXR-α and ABCA1 expression and apoA-I. With a Morris water test, we found that curcumin treatment could attenuate cognitive impairment. With HE and Nissl staining, we found that curcumin could significantly ameliorate the abnormal changes of pyramidal neurons. Meanwhile, the expression of LXR-β, RXR-α, ABCA1 and apoA-I mRNA and protein were increased in a dose-dependent manner after curcumin treatment. Interestingly, both serum HDL cholesterol and total cholesterol levels were statistically higher in the curcumin treatment group than those other groups. We conclude that curcumin has the ability to activate permissive LXR-β/RXR-α signaling and thereby modulate ABCA1 and apoA-I-mediated cholesterol transmembrane transportation, which is a new preventive and therapeutic strategy for cerevascular diseases.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by extracellular deposit of β-amyloid (Aβ) and accumulation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) is one of the major metabolites of arachidonic acid (AA), and plays essential roles in a series of key physiological processes like luteolysis and parturition. Additionally, PGF2α is also involved in the regulation of chronic and acute inflammation processes. Recent clinical studies have revealed the high content of PGF2α metabolite, 15-keto-dihydro-PGF2α in AD patients, implying the activation of in vivo PGF2α biosynthesis. However, the mechanism underlying the involvement of PGF2α in the progression of AD still remains unclear. Here we discovered that PGF2α selectively antagonized LXR (liver X receptors)/RXR (retinoid X receptor α) and RXR/RXR dimers. Cell based assays indicated that PGF2α effectively antagonized the activation of LXR agonist (t0901317) on Aβ clearance via inhibiting apolipoprotein E (apoE) expression, and cell apoptosis alleviation by accelerating inflammatory response to Aβ or Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in microglia. Therefore, our current findings have addressed the potential association of PGF2α with AD progression, and highlighted that inhibition of PGF2α biosynthesis might be a useful therapeutic strategy against AD. 
Major depressive disorder is a severe neuropsychiatric disease that negatively impacts the quality of life of a large portion of the population. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying depression are still unclear. The pathogenesis of depression involves several brain regions. However, most previous studies have focused only on one specific brain region. Plasma and brain tissues exchange numerous components through the blood‑brain barrier. Therefore, in the present study, plasma samples from control (CON) mice and mice subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) were used to investigate the molecular pathogenesis of depression, and the association between the peripheral circulation and the central nervous system. A total of 47 significant differentially expressed proteins were identified between the CUMS and CON group by an isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry approach. These 47 differentially expressed proteins were analyzed with ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) software. This revealed that the acute phase response, LXR/RXR and FXR/RXR activation, the complement system and the intrinsic prothrombin activation pathway were significantly changed. Four of the significant differentially expressed proteins (lipopolysaccharide binding protein, fibrinogen β chain, α‑1 antitrypsin, and complement factor H) were validated by western blotting. the present findings provide a novel insight into the molecular pathogenesis of depression.
The few data available on fusarenon-X (FX) do not support the derivation of health-based guidance values, although preliminary results suggest higher toxicity than other regulated trichothecenes. Using histo-morphological analysis and whole transcriptome profiling, this study was designed to obtain a global view of the intestinal alterations induced by FX. Deoxynivalenol (DON) served as a benchmark. FX induced more severe histological alterations than DON. Inflammation was the hallmark of the molecular toxicity of both mycotoxins. The benchmark doses for the up-regulation of key inflammatory genes by FX were 4- to 45-fold higher than the previously reported values for DON. The transcriptome analysis revealed that both mycotoxins down-regulated the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) and liver X receptor - retinoid X receptor (LXR-RXR) signaling pathways that control lipid metabolism. Interestingly, several pathways, including VDR/RXR activation, ephrin receptor signaling, and GNRH signaling, were specific to FX and thus discriminated the transcriptomic fingerprints of the two mycotoxins. These results demonstrate that FX induces more potent intestinal inflammation than DON. Moreover, although the mechanisms of toxicity of both mycotoxins are similar in many ways, this study emphasize specific pathways targeted by each mycotoxin, highlighting the need for specific mechanism-based risk assessments of Fusarium mycotoxins.
The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a multifaceted property of the brain vasculature that protects the brain and maintains homeostasis by tightly regulating the flux of ions, molecules, and cells across the vasculature. Blood vessels in the brain are formed by endothelial cells that acquire barrier properties, such as tight and adherens junctions, soon after the brain vasculature is formed. Endothelial WNT signaling is crucial to induce these BBB properties by regulating their expression and stabilization. Recent studies have implicated retinoic acid (RA) signaling in BBB development and shown that pharmacological concentrations of RA (≥5 µm) can induce BBB properties in cultured brain endothelial cells. However, a recent study demonstrated that RA inhibits endothelial WNT signaling during brain development, suggesting that RA does not promote BBB properties. We therefore investigated whether RA plays a physiological role in BBB development. We found that BBB function and junctional protein expression was unaffected in mouse mutants that have a reduced capacity to synthesize RA (Rdh10 mutants). Furthermore, embryos exposed to a RA-enriched diet did not enhance BBB protein expression. Together, our data indicate that RA is not capable of inducing, nor is it required for, BBB protein expression in vivo. Like other studies, we found that pharmacological concentrations of RA induce BBB genes in cultured murine brain endothelial cells, and this may involve activation of the LXR/RXR signaling pathway. Our data do not support a role for RA in BBB development, but confirm reports that pharmacological RA is a robust tool to induce BBB properties in culture.
ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) controls cholesterol and phospholipid efflux to lipid-poor apolipoprotein E (APOE) and is transcriptionally controlled by Liver X receptors (LXRs) and Retinoic X Receptors (RXRs). In APP transgenic mice, lack of Abca1 increased Aβ deposition and cognitive deficits. Abca1 haplo-deficiency in mice expressing human APOE isoforms, increased level of Aβ oligomers and worsened memory deficits, preferentially in APOE4 mice. In contrast upregulation of Abca1 by LXR/RXR agonists significantly ameliorated pathological phenotype of those mice. The goal of this study was to examine the effect of LXR agonist T0901317 (T0) on the phenotype and brain transcriptome of APP/E3 and APP/E4 Abca1 haplo-deficient (APP/E3/Abca1+/- and APP/E4/Abca1+/-) mice. Our data demonstrate that activated LXRs/RXR ameliorated APOE4-driven pathological phenotype and significantly affected brain transcriptome. We show that in mice expressing either APOE isoform, T0 treatment increased mRNA level of genes known to affect brain APOE lipidation such as Abca1 and Abcg1. In both APP/E3/Abca1+/- and APP/E4/Abca1+/- mice, the application of LXR agonist significantly increased ABCA1 protein level accompanied by an increased APOE lipidation, and was associated with restoration of APOE4 cognitive deficits, reduced levels of Aβ oligomers, but unchanged amyloid load. Finally, using Gene set enrichment analysis we show a significant APOE isoform specific response to LXR agonist treatment: Gene Ontology categories "Microtubule Based Process" and "Synapse Organization" were differentially affected in T0-treated APP/E4/Abca1+/- mice. Altogether, the results are suggesting that treatment of APP/E4/Abca1+/- mice with LXR agonist T0 ameliorates APOE4-induced AD-like pathology and therefore targeting the LXR-ABCA1-APOE regulatory axis could be effective as a potential therapeutic approach in AD patients, carriers of APOEε4.
In silico screening of DrugBank database to detect liver X receptor (LXR) agonism of marketed drugs using a self-organizing map and successive LXR-Gal4 hybrid reporter gene assay evaluation in vitro discovered alitretinoin and bexarotene as partial liver X receptor agonists. Dose-response curves demonstrated that plasma concentrations observed in clinical trials are sufficient for LXR activation and thus could account for LXR-mediated side-effects such as hypercholesterolemia and hyperlipidemia. The discovered drugs are the first reported dual LXR/RXR agonists and can serve as lead structures for LXR and dual LXR/RXR modulator development.
Retinoid X receptors (RXRs) are members of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily that mediate signaling by 9-cis retinoic acid, a vitamin A (retinol) derivative. RXRs play key roles not only as homodimers but also as heterodimeric partners-e.g., retinoic acid receptors (RARs), vitamin D receptors (VDRs), liver X receptors (LXRs), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). The NR family was recently associated with allergic diseases, but the role of RXRs in allergen-induced airway responses is not well defined. The goal of this study is to elucidate the role of RXRs in asthma pathogenesis and the potency of RXR partial agonist in the treatment of allergic airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness using a murine model of asthma.
We investigated the effect of a novel RXR partial agonist (NEt-4IB) on the development of allergic airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in a murine model of asthma. Balb/c mice were sensitized (days 0 and 14) and challenged (days 28-30) with ovalbumin (OVA), and airway inflammation and airway responses were monitored 48 h after the last OVA challenge. NEt-4IB was administered orally on days 25 to 32.
Oral administration of NEt-4IB significantly suppressed AHR and inflammatory cell accumulation in the airways and attenuated the levels of TNF-α in the lung and IL-5, IL-13 and NO levels in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and the number of periodic acid Schiff (PAS)-positive goblet cells in lung tissue. Treatment with NEt-4IB also significantly suppressed NF-κB expression.
These data suggest that RXRs may be of crucial importance in the mechanism of allergic asthma and that the novel RXR partial agonist NEt-4IB may be a promising candidate for the treatment of allergic airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness in a model of allergic asthma.
Joint homeostasis failure can result in osteoarthritis (OA). Currently, there are no treatments to alter disease progression in OA, but targeting early changes in cellular behavior has great potential. Recent data show that nuclear receptors contribute to the pathogenesis of OA and could be viable therapeutic targets, but their molecular mechanisms in cartilage are incompletely understood. This study examines global changes in gene expression after treatment with agonists for four nuclear receptor implicated in OA (LXR, PPARδ, PPARγ, and RXR). Murine articular chondrocytes were treated with agonists for LXR, PPARδ, PPARγ, or RXR and underwent microarray, qPCR, and cellular lipid analyses to evaluate changes in gene expression and lipid profile. Immunohistochemistry was conducted to compare two differentially expressed targets (Txnip, Gsta4) in control and cartilage-specific PPARδ knockout mice subjected to surgical destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM). Nuclear receptor agonists induced different gene expression profiles with many responses affecting lipid metabolism. LXR activation downregulated gene expression of proteases involved in OA, whereas RXR agonism decreased expression of ECM components and increased expression of Mmp13. Functional assays indicate increases in cell triglyceride accumulation after PPARγ, LXR, and RXR agonism but a decrease after PPARδ agonism. PPARδ and RXR downregulate the antioxidant Gsta4, and PPARδ upregulates Txnip. Wild-type, but not PPARδ-deficient mice, display increased staining for Txnip after DMM. Collectively, these data demonstrate that nuclear receptor activation in chondrocytes primarily affects lipid metabolism. In the case of PPARδ, this change might lead to increased oxidative stress, possibly contributing to OA-associated changes.
Nuclear receptors regulate metabolic genes in chondrocytes. Nuclear receptors affect triglyceride levels. PPARδ mediates regulation of oxidative stress markers. Nuclear receptors are promising therapeutic targets for osteoarthritis.
Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) may have extra-hepatic effects on cholesterol homeostasis of vascular macrophages. In this study, we aimed to investigate PCSK9 role on the anti-atherogenic process of ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (Abca1)-mediated cholesterol efflux.
Abca1-mediated cholesterol efflux was evaluated by a radioisotopic technique in mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPM) from wild-type (WT) or LDL receptor knock-out (Ldlr-/-) mice exposed to human recombinant PCSK9, in the presence of liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor (LXR/RXR) ligands or acetylated LDL (AcLDL) to stimulate Abca1 expression. Protein and gene expression was evaluated by Western blot and quantitative real time PCR, respectively.
PCSK9 inhibited Abca1-mediated cholesterol efflux induced by LXR/RXR agonists in WT MPM (-55%, p &lt; 0.05) but not in Ldlr-/- MPM. This effect was fully abrogated by the co-incubation with an anti-PCSK9 antibody. The inhibition of Abca1-dependent efflux induced by PCSK9 was associated with a reduction of Abca1 protein expression only in WT cells. Abca1 gene expression was significantly downregulated by PCSK9 in WT macrophages (-64%, p &lt; 0.001) and, to a lesser extent, in MPM lacking Ldlr (-35%, p &lt; 0.001). The inhibitory effect on Abca1-mediated efflux was also confirmed in AcLDL-treated macrophages. PCSK9 had a marginal or no effect on the expression of the lipid transporters Sr-b1 and Abcg1.
PCSK9 plays a direct role on Abca1-mediated cholesterol efflux through a downregulation of Abca1 gene and Abca1 protein expression. This extrahepatic effect may influence relevant steps in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, such as foam cell formation.
A very large number of fatty acids play wide range of physiological roles in cellular growth and function in placental as well as fetal growth. However, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in addition to its critical role in cellular membranes, is known to act as a ligand for several nuclear receptors and regulates the activity of transcription factor families like peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, liver X receptor (LXR), retinoid X receptor (RXR), and sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP). These transcription factors and DHA are known to regulate the placental and fetal growth and development.
The objective of the present study was to examine the fatty acids and transcription factors in the placenta of women delivering low birth weight (LBW) babies.
The present study examines the fatty acid and mRNA levels of various transcription factors in the placentae of women delivering normal birth weight (NBW) (n = 38) and women delivering LBW (n = 36). Placental fatty acids were analyzed using gas chromatography. Placental mRNA levels of PPARα, PPARγ, SREBP-1c, LXRα, RXRα, and RXRγ were examined using quantitative real time PCR.
Placental DHA levels and mRNA levels of placental PPARγ and LXRα were lower (P &lt; .05 for all) in women delivering LBW babies. There was a positive association of placental PPARγ mRNA levels and placental DHA levels with baby weight (P &lt; .05 for both).
Our data suggest that lower placental DHA and transcription factors may have a vital role in the etiology of LBW babies.
Hepatic lipogenesis is nutritionally regulated (i.e., downregulated during fasting and upregulated during the postprandial state) as an adaptation to the nutritional environment. While alterations in the expression level of the transcription factor SREBP-1c are known to be critical for nutritionally regulated lipogenesis, upstream mechanisms governing Srebf1 expression remain unclear. Here, we show that the fasting-induced transcription factor KLF15, a key regulator of gluconeogenesis, forms a complex with LXR/RXR, specifically on the Srebf1 promoter. This complex recruits the corepressor RIP140 instead of the coactivator SRC1, resulting in reduced Srebf1 and thus downstream lipogenic enzyme expression during the early and euglycemic period of fasting prior to hypoglycemia and PKA activation. Through this mechanism, KLF15 overexpression specifically ameliorates hypertriglyceridemia without affecting LXR-mediated cholesterol metabolism. These findings reveal a key molecular link between glucose and lipid metabolism and have therapeutic implications for the treatment of hyperlipidemia.
Expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1), a molecule facilitating cholesterol efflux to HDL, is activated by liver X receptor (LXR). In this study, we investigated if inhibition of ERK1/2 can activate macrophage ABCG1 expression and functions. MEK1/2 inhibitors, PD98059 and U0126, increased ABCG1 mRNA and protein expression, and activated the natural ABCG1 promoter but not the promoter with the LXR responsive element (LXRE) deletion. Inhibition of ABCG1 expression by ABCG1 siRNA did enhance the formation of macrophage/foam cells and it attenuated the inhibitory effect of MEK1/2 inhibitors on foam cell formation. MEK1/2 inhibitors activated macrophage cholesterol efflux to HDL in vitro, and they enhanced reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) in vivo. ApoE deficient (apoE(-/-)) mice receiving U0126 treatment had reduced sinus lesions in the aortic root which was associated with activated macrophage ABCG1 expression in the lesion areas. MEK1/2 inhibitors coordinated the RXR agonist, but not the LXR agonist, to induce ABCG1 expression. Furthermore, induction of ABCG1 expression by MEK1/2 inhibitors was associated with activation of SIRT1, a positive regulator of LXR activity, and inactivation of SULT2B1 and RIP140, two negative regulators of LXR activity. Taken together, our study suggests that MEK1/2 inhibitors activate macrophage ABCG1 expression/RCT, and inhibit foam cell formation and lesion development by multiple mechanisms, supporting the concept that ERK1/2 inhibition is anti-atherogenic.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized pathologically by the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The amyloid hypothesis contends that the abnormal accumulation of Aβ, the principal component of amyloid plaques, plays an essential role in initiating the disease. Impaired clearance of soluble Aβ from the brain, a process facilitated by apolipoprotein E (APOE), is believed to be a contributing factor in plaque formation. APOE expression is transcriptionally regulated through the action of a family of nuclear receptors including the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and liver X receptors (LXRs) in coordination with retinoid X receptors (RXRs). It has been previously reported that various agonists of this receptor family can influence brain Aβ levels in rodents. In this study we investigated the effects of LXR/RXR agonism on brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of Aβ40 in naïve rats. Treatment of rats for 3 days or 7 days with the LXR agonist, T0901317 or the RXR agonist, bexarotene did not result in significant changes in brain or CSF Aβ40 levels. 
Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is an aggressive malignancy. Although surgical resection may be curable, most patients are diagnosed at an advanced unresectable disease stage. Cholelithiasis is the major risk factor; however the pathogenesis of the disease, from gallstone cholecystitis to cancer, is still not understood. To understand the molecular genetic underpinnings of this cancer and explore novel therapeutic targets for GBC, we examined the key genes and pathways involved in GBC using RNA sequencing. We performed gene expression analysis of 32 cases of surgically-resected GBC along with normal gallbladder tissue controls. We observed that 519 genes were differentially expressed between GBC and normal GB mucosal controls. The liver X receptor (LXR)/retinoid X receptor (RXR) and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) /RXR pathways were the top canonical pathways involved in GBC. Key genes in these pathways, including SERPINB3 and KLK1, were overexpressed in GBC, especially in female GBC patients. Additionally, ApoA1 gene expression suppressed in GBC as compared with normal control tissues. LXR and FXR genes, known to be important in lipid metabolism also function as tumor suppressors and their down regulation appears to be critical for GBC pathogenesis. LXR agonists may have therapeutic value and as potential therapeutic targets. 
Nuclear receptors are transcription factors which sense changing environmental or hormonal signals and effect transcriptional changes to regulate core life functions including growth, development, and reproduction. To support this function, following ligand-activation by xenobiotics, members of subfamily 1 nuclear receptors (NR1s) may heterodimerize with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) to regulate transcription of genes involved in energy and xenobiotic metabolism and inflammation. Several of these receptors including the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), the pregnane and xenobiotic receptor (PXR), the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), the liver X receptor (LXR) and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) are key regulators of the gut:liver:adipose axis and serve to coordinate metabolic responses across organ systems between the fed and fasting states. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease and may progress to cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD is associated with inappropriate nuclear receptor function and perturbations along the gut:liver:adipose axis including obesity, increased intestinal permeability with systemic inflammation, abnormal hepatic lipid metabolism, and insulin resistance. Environmental chemicals may compound the problem by directly interacting with nuclear receptors leading to metabolic confusion and the inability to differentiate fed from fasting conditions. This review focuses on the impact of nuclear receptors in the pathogenesis and treatment of NAFLD. Clinical trials including PIVENS and FLINT demonstrate that nuclear receptor targeted therapies may lead to the paradoxical dissociation of steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and obesity. Novel strategies currently under development (including tissue-specific ligands and dual receptor agonists) may be required to separate the beneficial effects of nuclear receptor activation from unwanted metabolic side effects. The impact of nuclear receptor crosstalk in NAFLD is likely to be profound, but requires further elucidation.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common movement disorders, and currently there is no effective treatment that can slow disease progression. Preserving and enhancing DA neuron survival is increasingly regarded as the most promising therapeutic strategy for treating PD. IRX4204 is a second generation retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist that has no cross reactivity with retinoic acid receptors, farnesoid X receptor, liver X receptors or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPARγ. We found that IRX4204 promotes the survival and maintenance of nigral dopaminergic (DA) neurons in a dose-dependent manner in primary mesencephalic cultures. Brain bioavailability studies demonstrate that IRX4204 can cross the blood brain barrier and reach the brain at nM concentration. Oral administration of IRX4204 can activate nuclear receptor Nurr1 downstream signaling in the substantia nigra (SN) andattenuate neurochemical and motor deficits in a rat model of PD. Our study suggests that IRX4204 represents a novel, potent and selective pharmacological means to activate cellular RXR-Nurr1 signaling and promote SN DA neuron survival in PD prevention and/or treatment. 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the major cause of dementia worldwide. The pharmacological activation of nuclear receptors (Liver X receptors: LXRs or Retinoid X receptors: RXR) has been shown to induce overexpression of the ATP-Binding Cassette A1 (ABCA1) and Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), changes that are associated with improvement in cognition and reduction of amyloid beta pathology in amyloidogenic AD mouse models (i.e. APP, PS1: 2tg-AD). Here we investigated whether treatment with a specific LXR agonist has a measurable impact on the cognitive impairment in an amyloid and Tau AD mouse model (3xTg-AD: 12-months-old; three months treatment). The data suggests that the LXR agonist GW3965 is associated with increased expression of ApoE and ABCA1 in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex without a detectable reduction of the amyloid load. We also report that most cells overexpressing ApoE (86±12%) are neurons localized in the granular cell layer of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. In the GW3965 treated 3xTg-AD mice we also observed reduction in astrogliosis and increased number of stem and proliferating cells in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. Additionally, we show that GW3965 rescued hippocampus long term synaptic plasticity, which had been disrupted by oligomeric amyloid beta peptides. The effect of GW3965 on synaptic function was protein synthesis dependent. Our findings identify alternative functional/molecular mechanisms by which LXR agonists may exert their potential benefits as a therapeutic strategy against AD. 
There is interest among agencies and public health practitioners in the United States (USA) to estimate the future burden of climate-related health outcomes. Calculating disease burden projections can be especially daunting, given the complexities of climate modeling and the multiple pathways by which climate influences public health. Interdisciplinary coordination between public health practitioners and climate scientists is necessary for scientifically derived estimates. We describe a unique partnership of state and regional climate scientists and public health practitioners assembled by the Florida Building Resilience Against Climate Effects (BRACE) program. We provide a background on climate modeling and projections that has been developed specifically for public health practitioners, describe methodologies for combining climate and health data to project disease burden, and demonstrate three examples of this process used in Florida.
During conflict and disasters, women and girls are at increased risk of gender based violence. International humanitarian guidelines call for the distribution of individual lighting to meet women and girls' basic needs and to reduce risk of violence; however, little evidence exists to support these guidelines. This paper presents an evaluation of handheld solar light use, retention, and durability among women and girls living in two internally displaced persons camps in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Data was gathered prospectively via five household surveys from August 2013 to April 2014; a total of 754 females participated in the study. Women reported going outside at night more frequently at the end of the study than at the beginning. The handheld solar lights were the most common source of lighting at endline, whereas candle and gas lamp use declined significantly over time. Results from a Life-Table survival analysis estimated that households had an 83% probability of still owning a functioning light after seven months. Given the frequent use, acceptable durability, and retention of the lights, donors and humanitarian organizations should consider supporting light distribution to women and girls in internally displaced persons camps to help meet their basic needs.
Extreme heat (EH) is a growing concern with climate change, and protecting human health requires knowledge of vulnerability factors. We evaluated whether associations between EH (maximum temperature &gt; 97th percentile) and hospitalization for renal, heat and respiratory diseases among people ≥ 65 years differed by individual and area-level characteristics.
We used Medicare billing records, airport weather data, U.S. Census data and satellite land cover imagery in 109 US cities, May-September, 1992-2006, in a time-stratified case-crossover design. Interaction terms between EH and individual (&gt; 78 years, black race, sex) and home ZIP-code (percentages of non-green space, high school education, housing built before 1940) characteristics were incorporated in a single model. Next, we pooled city-specific effect estimates or regressed them on quartiles of air conditioning prevalence (ACP) in a multivariate random effects meta-analysis.
EH and combined renal/heat/respiratory hospitalization associations were stronger among blacks, the very old, in ZIP codes with lower educational attainment or older housing and in cities with lower ACP. For example, for EH versus non-heat days, we found a 15% (95% CI 11%-19%) increase in renal/heat/respiratory hospitalizations among individuals in ZIP codes with higher percent of older homes in contrast to a 9% (95% CI 6%-12%) increase in hospitalizations in ZIP codes with lower percent older homes.
Vulnerability to EH-associated hospitalization may be influenced by age, educational attainment, housing age and ACP.
Evidence suggests that in-utero exposure to environmental chemicals, such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs), heavy metals, and radionuclides, that might bioaccumulate in the mother may increase a newborn's risk of adverse developmental, neurological, and immunologic effects. Chemical contamination of bodies of water and strong ocean currents worldwide can drive these chemicals from lower latitudes to Arctic waters where they accumulate in common traditional subsistence foods. In response to concerns of the people from Alaska of the effects of bio-accumulated chemicals on their children, the Maternal Organics Monitoring Study(MOMS) was developed. The objective of the study was to assess the risks and benefits associated with the population's subsistence diet. Data analysis of biological samples at the CDC's NCEH laboratory and maternal questionnaires is ongoing. Results will be provided to Alaska Native communities to help support public health actions and inform future interventions and research.
Ciguatera fish poisoning (ciguatera) is a common clinical syndrome in areas where there is dependence on tropical reef fish for food. A subset of patients develops recurrent and, in some instances, chronic symptoms, which may result in substantial disability. To identify possible biomarkers for recurrent/chronic disease, and to explore correlations with immune gene expression, peripheral blood leukocyte gene expression in 10 ciguatera patients (7 recurrent and 3 acute) from the U.S. Virgin Islands, and 5 unexposed Florida controls were evaluated. Significant differences in gene expression were noted when comparing ciguatera patients and controls; however, it was not possible to differentiate between patients with acute and recurrent disease, possibly due to the small sample sizes involved.
The failure of the human body to thermoregulate can lead to severe outcomes (e.g., death) and lasting physiological damage. However, heat-related illness (HRI) is highly preventable via individual- and community-level modification. A thorough understanding of the burden is necessary for effective intervention. This paper describes the burden of severe HRI morbidity and mortality among residents of a humid subtropical climate. Work-related and non-work-related HRI emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and deaths among Florida residents during May to October (2005-2012) were examined. Sub-groups susceptible to HRI were identified. The age-adjusted rates/100,000 person-years for non-work-related HRI were 33.1 ED visits, 5.9 hospitalizations, and 0.2 deaths, while for work-related HRI/100,000 worker-years there were 8.5 ED visits, 1.1 hospitalizations, and 0.1 deaths. The rates of HRI varied by county, data source, and work-related status, with the highest rates observed in the panhandle and south central Florida. The sub-groups with the highest relative rates regardless of data source or work-relatedness were males, minorities, and rural residents. Those aged 15-35 years had the highest ED visit rates, while for non-work-related hospitalizations and deaths the rates increased with age. The results of this study can be used for targeted interventions and evaluating changes in the HRI burden over time.
Consumption of contaminated poultry, raw milk and water are significant risk factors for Campylobacter infection. Previous studies also have investigated the association between weather (temperature and precipitation) and increased risk of campylobacteriosis, but limited information exists regarding the impacts of extreme heat and precipitation events on campylobacteriosis risk, and how such risk may differentially impact coastal communities. We obtained Campylobacter case data 2002-2012; n=4804) from the Maryland Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet). We identified extreme heat and extreme precipitation events during this time (2002-2012) using location and calendar day specific thresholds (95th percentile for extreme heat and 90th percentile for extreme precipitation) that were computed based on a 30-year baseline (1960-1989). We linked these datasets using GIS and used negative binomial generalized estimating equations adjusted for demographic confounders to calculate the association between exposure to extreme events and risk of campylobacteriosis in Maryland. We observed that a one-day increase in exposure to extreme precipitation events was associated with a 3% increase in risk of campylobacteriosis in coastal areas of Maryland (Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR): 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01, 1.05), but such an association was not observed in noncoastal areas. Furthermore, the risk associated with extreme precipitation events was considerably higher during La Niña periods (IRR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.13), while there was no evidence of elevated risk during El Niño or ENSO Neutral periods. Exposure to extreme heat events was not associated with an increased risk of campylobacteriosis, except during La Niña periods (IRR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.08). Extreme precipitation events could result in flooding within coastal areas that may bring water contaminated with bacterial pathogens (originating from sources such as septic systems, municipal wastewater treatment plants and concentrated animal feeding operations) into close proximity with individuals, where frequency of contact may be higher.
Kilauea Volcano on the Island of Hawai'i has erupted continuously since 1983, releasing approximately 300-12000metrictons per day of sulfur dioxide (SO2). SO2 interacts with water vapor to produce an acidic haze known locally as "vog". The combination of wind speed and direction, inversion layer height, and local terrain lead to heterogeneous and variable distribution of vog over the island, allowing study of respiratory effects associated with chronic vog exposure.
We characterized the distribution and composition of vog over the Island of Hawai'i, and tested the hypotheses that chronic vog exposure (SO2 and acid) is associated with increased asthma prevalence, respiratory symptoms, and reduced pulmonary function in Hawai'i Island schoolchildren.
We compiled data of volcanic emissions, wind speed, and wind direction over Hawai'i Island since 1992. Community-based researchers then measured 2- to 4-week integrated concentrations of SO2 and fine particulate mass and acidity in 4 exposure zones, from 2002 to 2005, when volcanic SO2 emissions averaged 1600metrictons per day. Concurrently, community researchers recruited schoolchildren in the 4th and 5th grades of 25 schools in the 4 vog exposure zones, to assess determinants of lung health, respiratory symptoms, and asthma prevalence.
Environmental data suggested 4 different vog exposure zones with SO2, PM2.5, and particulate acid concentrations (mean±s.d.) as follows: 1) Low (0.3±0.2ppb, 2.5±1.2μg/m(3), 0.6±1.1nmolH+/m(3)), 2) Intermittent (1.6±1.8ppb, 2.8±1.5μg/m(3), 4.0±6.6nmolH+/m(3)), 3) Frequent (10.1±5.2ppb, 4.8±1.9μg/m(3), 4.3±6.7nmolH+/m(3)), and 4) Acid (1.2±0.4ppb, 7.2±2.3μg/m(3), 25.3±17.9nmolH+/m(3)). Participants (1957) in the 4 zones differed in race, prematurity, maternal smoking during pregnancy, environmental tobacco smoke exposure, presence of mold in the home, and physician-diagnosed asthma. Multivariable analysis showed an association between Acid vog exposure and cough and strongly suggested an association with FEV1/FVC &lt;0.8, but not with diagnosis of asthma, or chronic persistent wheeze or bronchitis in the last 12months.
Hawai'i Island's volcanic air pollution can be very acidic, but contains few co-contaminants originating from anthropogenic sources of air pollution. Chronic exposure to acid vog is associated with increased cough and possibly with reduced FEV1/FVC, but not with asthma or bronchitis. Further study is needed to better understand how volcanic air pollution interacts with host and environmental factors to affect respiratory symptoms, lung function, and lung growth, and to determine acute effects of episodes of increased emissions.
Between 1958 and 1982, NL Industries manufactured components of enriched (EU) and depleted uranium (DU) at a factory in Colonie NY, USA. More than 5 metric tons of DU was deposited as microscopic DU oxide particles on the plant site and surrounding residential community. A prior study involving a small number of individuals (n=23) indicated some residents were exposed to DU and former workers to both DU and EU, most probably through inhalation of aerosol particles.
Our aim was to measure total uranium [U] and the uranium isotope ratios: (234)U/(238)U; (235)U/(238)U; and (236)U/(238)U, in the urine of a cohort of former workers and nearby residents of the NLI factory, to characterize individual exposure to natural uranium (NU), DU, and EU more than 3 decades after production ceased.
We conducted a biomonitoring study in a larger cohort of 32 former workers and 99 residents, who may have been exposed during its period of operation, by measuring Total U, NU, DU, and EU in urine using Sector Field Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry (SF-ICP-MS).
Among workers, 84% were exposed to DU, 9% to EU and DU, and 6% to natural uranium (NU) only. For those exposed to DU, urinary isotopic and [U] compositions result from binary mixing of NU and the DU plant feedstock. Among residents, 8% show evidence of DU exposure, whereas none shows evidence of EU exposure. For residents, the [U] geometric mean is significantly below the value reported for NHANES. There is no significant difference in [U] between exposed and unexposed residents, suggesting that [U] alone is not a reliable indicator of exposure to DU in this group.
Ninety four percent of workers tested showed evidence of exposure to DU, EU or both, and were still excreting DU and EU decades after leaving the workforce. The study demonstrates the advantage of measuring multiple isotopic ratios (e.g., (236)U/(238)U and (235)U/(238)U) over a single ratio ((235)U/(238)U) in determining sources of uranium exposure.
Arsenic, a toxic element naturally found in groundwater, is a public health concern for households drinking from wells. Private well water is not regulated to meet the federal drinking water arsenic Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) of 10μg/L, or the more protective 5μg/L New Jersey (NJ) state MCL. In the absence of consistent private well regulation, public health efforts have relied on promoting testing in affected communities to various degrees of success. Few interventions publish results, and more often focus on the outcome of tested wells rather than who completed a test, and more importantly, who did not. Through our survey of randomly selected addresses (n=670) in 17 NJ towns we find higher rates of arsenic testing in areas with a history of testing promotion. However, we also see a stronger correlation of testing behavior with income and education in high promotion areas, suggesting that community engagement activities may be exacerbating socioeconomic status (SES) testing disparities. Well owners with a bachelor's degree had ten times greater odds of participating in our direct mail testing intervention than those with less education when tests cost $40. After all households (n=255) were offered free tests to overcome many of the usual testing barriers - awareness, convenience, and cost - only 47% participated and those who chose to return water samples were of higher income and education than those who did not. Our findings highlight that while efforts to promote and provide arsenic testing succeed in testing more wells, community testing interventions risk increasing SES disparities if those with more education and resources are more likely to take advantage of testing programs. Therefore, testing interventions can benefit by better targeting socially vulnerable populations in an effort to overcome SES-patterned self-selection when individuals are left alone with the responsibility of managing their drinking water quality.
Electronic health records (EHRs) from primary care providers can be used for chronic disease surveillance; however, EHR-based prevalence estimates may be biased toward people who seek care. This study sought to describe the characteristics of an in-care population and compare them with those of a not-in-care population to inform interpretation of EHR data.
We used data from the 2013-2014 New York City Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NYC HANES), considered the gold standard for estimating disease prevalence, and the 2013 Community Health Survey, and classified participants as in care or not in care, on the basis of their report of seeing a health care provider in the previous year. We used χ(2) tests to compare the distribution of demographic characteristics, health care coverage and access, and chronic conditions between the 2 populations.
According to the Community Health Survey, approximately 4.1 million (71.7%) adults aged 20 or older had seen a health care provider in the previous year; according to NYC HANES, approximately 4.7 million (75.1%) had. In both surveys, the in-care population was more likely to be older, female, non-Hispanic, and insured compared with the not-in-care population. The in-care population from the NYC HANES also had a higher prevalence of diabetes (16.7% vs 6.9%; P &lt; .001), hypercholesterolemia (35.7% vs 22.3%; P &lt; .001), and hypertension (35.5% vs 26.4%; P &lt; .001) than the not-in-care population.
Systematic differences between in-care and not-in-care populations warrant caution in using primary care data to generalize to the population at large. Future efforts to use primary care data for chronic disease surveillance need to consider the intended purpose of data collected in these systems as well as the characteristics of the population using primary care.
Regularly ingesting water with elevated arsenic increases adverse health risks. Since September 2002, the NJ Private Well Testing Act (PWTA) has required testing untreated well water for arsenic during real estate transactions in 12 counties. Its implementation provides an opportunity to investigate the effects of policy intervention on well testing and treatment behavior. Here we analyze results of a survey mailed to 1943 random addresses (37% response), including responses from 502 private well households who purchased their homes prior to PWTA commencement and 168 who purchased after. We find the PWTA has significantly increased arsenic testing rates in an area where 21% of wells contain arsenic above the 5μg/L NJ drinking water standard. The PWTA has allowed identification of more wells with arsenic (20% of post-PWTA vs. 4% of pre-PWTA households) and more treatment for arsenic (19% of post-PWTA vs. 3% of pre-PWTA households). Such an Act is a partial answer to significant socioeconomic disparities in testing observed among households for whom it is not required. Additionally residents purchasing homes since 2002 are younger and disproportionately more likely to have children in their household (60% vs. 32%), a priority group given their particular vulnerability to effects of arsenic. Despite more wells tested under the PWTA, post-PWTA well owners forget or misremember arsenic test results more often, are more likely to report not knowing what kind of treatment they are using, and are not reporting better maintenance or monitoring of their treatment systems than pre-PWTA households. This suggests serious challenges to reducing arsenic exposure remain even when testing is a requirement. Furthermore, only a fraction of wells have been tested under the PWTA due to the slow pace of housing turnover. We recommend more public resources be made available to support private well testing among socially and biologically vulnerable groups.
Arsenic is a naturally occurring toxic element often concentrated in groundwater at levels unsafe for human consumption. Private well water in the United States is mostly unregulated by federal and state drinking water standards. It is the responsibility of the over 13 million U.S. households regularly depending on private wells for their water to ensure it is safe for drinking. There is a consistent graded association with health outcomes at all levels of socioeconomic status (SES) in the U.S. Differential exposure to environmental risk may be contributing to this persistent SES-health gradient. Environmental justice advocates cite overwhelming evidence that income and other SES measures are consistently inversely correlated with exposure to suboptimal environmental conditions including pollutants, toxins, and their impacts. Here we use private well household surveys from two states to investigate the association between SES and risks for arsenic exposure, examining the potentially cumulative effects of residential location, testing and treatment behavior, and psychological factors influencing behavior. We find that the distribution of natural arsenic hazard in the environment is socioeconomically random. There is no evidence that higher SES households are avoiding areas with arsenic or that lower SES groups are disproportionately residing in areas with arsenic. Instead, disparities in exposure arise from differing rates of protective action, primarily testing well water for arsenic, and secondly treating or avoiding contaminated water. We observe these SES disparities in behavior as well as in the psychological factors that are most favorable to these behaviors. Assessment of risk should not be limited to the spatial occurrence of arsenic alone. It is important that social vulnerability factors are incorporated into risk modeling and identifying priority areas for intervention, which should include strategies that specifically target socioeconomically vulnerable groups as well as all the conditions which cause these disparities in testing and treatment behavior.
Several studies have investigated the association between asthma exacerbations and exposures to ambient temperature and precipitation. However, limited data exists regarding how extreme events, projected to grow in frequency, intensity, and duration in the future in response to our changing climate, will impact the risk of hospitalization for asthma. The objective of our study was to quantify the association between frequency of extreme heat and precipitation events and increased risk of hospitalization for asthma in Maryland between 2000 and 2012.
We used a time-stratified case-crossover design to examine the association between exposure to extreme heat and precipitation events and risk of hospitalization for asthma (ICD-9 code 493, n = 115,923).
Occurrence of extreme heat events in Maryland increased the risk of same day hospitalization for asthma (lag 0) by 3 % (Odds Ratio (OR): 1.03, 95 % Confidence Interval (CI): 1.00, 1.07), with a considerably higher risk observed for extreme heat events that occur during summer months (OR: 1.23, 95 % CI: 1.15, 1.33). Likewise, summertime extreme precipitation events increased the risk of hospitalization for asthma by 11 % in Maryland (OR: 1.11, 95 % CI: 1.06, 1.17). Across age groups, increase in risk for asthma hospitalization from exposure to extreme heat event during the summer months was most pronounced among youth and adults, while those related to extreme precipitation event was highest among ≤4 year olds.
Exposure to extreme heat and extreme precipitation events, particularly during summertime, is associated with increased risk of hospitalization for asthma in Maryland. Our results suggest that projected increases in frequency of extreme heat and precipitation event will have significant impact on public health.
The detonation of a radiological dispersion device or other radiological incidents could result in the dispersion of radioactive materials and intakes of radionuclides by affected individuals. Transportable radiation monitoring instruments could be used to measure photon radiation from radionuclides in the body for triaging individuals and assigning priorities to their bioassay samples for further assessments. Computer simulations and experimental measurements are required for these instruments to be used for assessing intakes of radionuclides. Count rates from calibrated sources of Co, Cs, and Am were measured on three instruments: a survey meter containing a 2.54 × 2.54-cm NaI(Tl) crystal, a thyroid probe using a 5.08 × 5.08-cm NaI(Tl) crystal, and a portal monitor incorporating two 3.81 × 7.62 × 182.9-cm polyvinyltoluene plastic scintillators. Computer models of the instruments and of the calibration sources were constructed, using engineering drawings and other data provided by the manufacturers. Count rates on the instruments were simulated using the Monte Carlo radiation transport code MCNPX. The computer simulations were within 16% of the measured count rates for all 20 measurements without using empirical radionuclide-dependent scaling factors, as reported by others. The weighted root-mean-square deviations (differences between measured and simulated count rates, added in quadrature and weighted by the variance of the difference) were 10.9% for the survey meter, 4.2% for the thyroid probe, and 0.9% for the portal monitor. These results validate earlier MCNPX models of these instruments that were used to develop calibration factors that enable these instruments to be used for assessing intakes and committed doses from several gamma-emitting radionuclides.
Extreme heat event excess mortality has been estimated statistically to assess impacts, evaluate heat emergency response, and project climate change risks. We estimated annual excess non-external-cause deaths associated with extreme heat events in New York City (NYC). Extreme heat events were defined as days meeting current National Weather Service forecast criteria for issuing heat advisories in NYC based on observed maximum daily heat index values from LaGuardia Airport. Outcomes were daily non-external-cause death counts for NYC residents from May through September from 1997 to 2013 (n = 337,162). The cumulative relative risk (CRR) of death associated with extreme heat events was estimated in a Poisson time-series model for each year using an unconstrained distributed lag for days 0-3 accommodating over dispersion, and adjusting for within-season trends and day of week. Attributable death counts were computed by year based on individual year CRRs. The pooled CRR per extreme heat event day was 1.11 (95%CI 1.08-1.14). The estimated annual excess non-external-cause deaths attributable to heat waves ranged from -14 to 358, with a median of 121. Point estimates of heat wave-attributable deaths were greater than 0 in all years but one and were correlated with the number of heat wave days (r = 0.81). Average excess non-external-cause deaths associated with extreme heat events were nearly 11-fold greater than hyperthermia deaths. Estimated extreme heat event-associated excess deaths may be a useful indicator of the impact of extreme heat events, but single-year estimates are currently too imprecise to identify short-term changes in risk.
Benthic dinoflagellates in the genus Gambierdiscus produce the ciguatoxin precursors responsible for the occurrence of ciguatera toxicity. The prevalence of ciguatera toxins in fish has been linked to the presence and distribution of toxin-producing species in coral reef ecosystems, which is largely determined by the presence of suitable benthic habitat and environmental conditions favorable for growth. Here using single factor experiments, we examined the effects of salinity, irradiance, and temperature on growth of 17 strains of Gambierdiscus representing eight species/phylotypes (G. belizeanus, G. caribaeus, G. carolinianus, G. carpenteri, G. pacificus, G. silvae, Gambierdiscus sp. type 4-5), most of which were established from either Marakei Island, Republic of Kiribati, or St. Thomas, United States Virgin Island (USVI). Comparable to prior studies, growth rates fell within the range of 0-0.48 divisions day(-1). In the salinity and temperature studies, Gambierdiscus responded in a near Gaussian, non-linear manner typical for such studies, with optimal and suboptimal growth occurring in the range of salinities of 25 and 45 and 21.0 and 32.5°C. In the irradiance experiment, no mortality was observed; however, growth rates at 55 μmol photons · m(-2) · s(-1) were lower than those at 110-400 μmol photons · m(-2) · s(-1). At the extremes of the environmental conditions tested, growth rates were highly variable, evidenced by large coefficients of variability. However, significant differences in intraspecific growth rates were typically found only at optimal or near-optimal growth conditions. Polynomial regression analyses showed that maximum growth occurred at salinity and temperature levels of 30.1-38.5 and 23.8-29.2°C, respectively. Gambierdiscus growth patterns varied among species, and within individual species: G. belizeanus, G. caribaeus, G. carpenteri, and G. pacificus generally exhibited a wider range of tolerance to environmental conditions, which may explain their broad geographic distribution. In contrast, G. silvae and Gambierdiscus sp. types 4-5 all displayed a comparatively narrow range of tolerance to temperature, salinity, and irradiance.
In this study, concentrations of bisphenol A (BPA) and seven other bisphenols (BPs) were measured in urine samples collected from people living in and around e-waste dismantling facilities, and in matched reference population from rural and urban areas in China. BPA, bisphenol S (BPS), and bisphenol F (BPF) were frequently detected (detection frequencies: &gt; 90%) in urine samples collected from individuals who live near e-waste facilities, with geometric mean (GM) concentrations of 2.99 (or 3.75), 0.361 (or 0.469), and 0.349 (or 0.435) ng/mL (or μg/g Cre), respectively; the other five BPs were rarely found in urine samples, regardless of the sampling location. The urinary concentrations of BPA and BPF, but not BPS, were significantly higher in individuals from e-waste recycling locations than did individuals from a rural reference location. Our findings indicated that e-waste dismantling activities contribute to human exposure to BPA and BPF. 8-Hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) was measured in urine as a marker of oxidative stress. In the e-waste dismantling location, urinary 8-OHdG was significantly and positively correlated (p &lt; 0.001) with urinary BPA and BPS, but not BPF; a similar correlation was also observed in reference sites. These findings suggest that BPA and BPS exposures are associated with elevated oxidative stress. 
Green eco-friendly housing includes approaches to reduce indoor air pollutant sources and to increase energy efficiency. Although sealing/tightening buildings can save energy and reduce the penetration of outdoor pollutants, an adverse outcome can be increased buildup of pollutants with indoor sources. The objective of this study was to determine the differences in the indoor air quality (IAQ) between green and non-green homes in low-income housing complexes. In one housing complex, apartments were renovated using green principles (n=28). Home visits were conducted immediately after the renovation, and subsequently at 6 months and at 12 months following the renovation. Of these homes, eight homes had pre-renovation home visits; this allowed pre- and post-renovation comparisons within the same homes. Parallel visits were conducted in non-green (control) apartments (n=14) in a nearby low-income housing complex. The IAQ assessments included PM2.5, black carbon, ultrafine particles, sulfur, total volatile organic compounds (VOCs), formaldehyde, and air exchange rate. Data were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models. None of the indoor pollutant concentrations were significantly different between green and non-green homes. However, we found differences when comparing the concentrations before and after renovation. Measured immediately after renovation, indoor black carbon concentrations were significantly lower averaging 682 ng/m(3) in post-renovation vs. 2364 ng/m(3) in pre-renovation home visits (p=0.01). In contrast, formaldehyde concentrations were significantly higher in post-renovated (0.03 ppm) than in pre-renovated homes (0.01 ppm) (p=0.004). Questionnaire data showed that opening of windows occurred less frequently in homes immediately post-renovation compared to pre-renovation; this factor likely affected the levels of indoor black carbon (from outdoor sources) and formaldehyde (from indoor sources) more than the renovation status itself. To reduce IAQ problems and potentially improve health, careful selection of indoor building materials and ensuring sufficient ventilation are important for green building designs.
Oviposition and larval preference of spotted bollworm, Earias vittella (Fabricius) was assessed on four transgenic Bt cotton hybrids, viz. MRC 6304 Bt (cry1Ac gene), JKCH 1947 Bt (modified cry1Ac gene), NCEH 6R Bt (cry1Ab/cry1Ac fused gene) and MRC 7017 BG II (cry1Ac and cry2Ab genes) in comparison to the respective isogenic cotton. The results showed that Bt toxin did not deter oviposition preference of E. vittella moths as there was no significant difference in the number of eggs laid on squares/bolls of Bt and non-Bt cotton hybrids, across different crop growth stages. There was also no behavioral change in larval preference with respect to selecting non-Bt cotton in comparison to Bt cotton. Floral bodies from Bt and the respective isogenic cotton genotypes were equally preferred by both first and third instar larvae after 24 hrs indicating that initial selection was independent of susceptibility to Bt toxin. However, E. vittella larvae showed significant difference in preference for different cotton genotypes. Studies on the relative preference indicated that third instar larvae had greater preference for bolls (7.29-7.50%) than for the squares (5.0-5.21%) and reverse was true for the first instar larvae which showed greater preference for squares (7.08-7.29%) than for the bolls (5.21-5.42%), in a multiple-choice test. It may be concluded that oviposition and larval preference of E. vittella did not differ significantly between Bt and isogenic non-Bt cotton genotypes.
Extreme heat waves elevate the population's risk for heat-related morbidity and mortality, specifically for vulnerable groups such as older adults and young children. In this context, we developed 2 Heat Vulnerability Indices (HVIs), one for the state of Wisconsin and one for the Milwaukee metropolitan area.
Through the creation of an HVI, state and local agencies will be able to use the indices as a planning tool for extreme heat events.
Data used for the HVIs were grouped into 4 categories: (1) population density; (2) health factors; (3) demographic and socioeconomic factors; and (4) natural and built environment factors. These categories were mapped at the Census block group level.
Unweighted z-score data were used to determine index scores, which were then mapped by quantiles ranging from "high" to "low" vulnerability.
Statewide, Menominee County exhibited the highest vulnerability to extreme heat. Milwaukee HVI findings indicated high vulnerability in the city's inner core versus low vulnerability along the lakeshore.
Visualization of vulnerability could help local public health agencies prepare for future extreme heat events.
Most prior research investigating the health effects of extreme cold has been limited to temperature alone. Only a few studies have assessed population vulnerability and compared various weather indicators. The study described in this article intended to evaluate the effects of cold weather on hospital admissions due to ischemic heart disease, especially acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and to examine the potential interactive effects between weather factors and demographics on AMI. The authors found that extremely low universal apparent temperature in winter was associated with increased risk of AMI, especially during lag4-lag6. Certain demographic groups such as the elderly, males, people with Medicaid insurance, people living in warmer areas, and areas with high PM2.5 concentration showed higher vulnerabilities to cold-AMI effects than other groups.
In 2010, the Louisiana Asthma Management and Prevention Program (LAMP) implemented the Asthma-Friendly Schools Initiative in high-risk Louisiana populations. The social ecological model (SEM) was used as a framework for an asthma program implemented in 70 state K-12 public schools over 2 years.
Activities included a needs assessment, identification of students with asthma, individualized asthma action plans (AAP), staff trainings, environmental quality improvement, and school system policy changes to address the asthma burden.
There were 522 new or existing asthma cases recognized. Asthma knowledge/awareness was measurably improved among school personnel. School indoor air quality was improved across all locations. School-level policies were adopted that improved AAP collection, compliance to bus-idling restrictions, and asthma medication self-carry.
The SEM framework can be used for school-based programs to address successfully and improve asthma-related issues from the individual through policy levels.
Domestic drinking water wells serve 44 million people in the US and are common globally. They are often located in areas served by onsite wastewater treatment systems, including septic systems, which can be sources of biological and chemical pollutants to groundwater. In this study we tested 20 domestic drinking water wells in a sand and gravel aquifer on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA, for 117 organic wastewater compounds (OWCs) and for inorganic markers of septic system impact. We detected 27 OWCs, including 12 pharmaceuticals, five per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), four organophosphate flame retardants, and an artificial sweetener (acesulfame). Maximum concentrations of several PFASs and pharmaceuticals were relatively high compared to public drinking water supplies in the US. The number of detected OWCs and total concentrations of pharmaceuticals and of PFASs were positively correlated with nitrate, boron, and acesulfame and negatively correlated with well depth. These wells were all located in areas served exclusively by onsite wastewater treatment systems, which are likely the main source of the OWCs in these wells, although landfill leachate may also be a source. Our results suggest that current regulations to protect domestic wells from pathogens in septic system discharges do not prevent OWCs from reaching domestic wells, and that nitrate, a commonly measured drinking water contaminant, is a useful screening tool for OWCs in domestic wells. Nitrate concentrations of 1mg/L NO3-N, which are tenfold higher than local background and tenfold lower than the US federal drinking water standard, were associated with wastewater impacts from OWCs in this study. 
Firefighters are at increased risk for exposure to toxic chemicals compared to the general population, but few studies of this occupational group have included biomonitoring. We measured selected phenolic chemicals in urine collected from 101 Southern California firefighters. The analytes included bisphenol A (BPA), triclosan, benzophenone-3 (BP-3), and parabens, which are common ingredients in a range of consumer products. BP-3, BPA, triclosan, and methyl paraben were detected in almost all study subjects (94-100%). The BP-3 geometric mean for firefighters was approximately five times higher than for a comparable National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) subgroup. Demographic and exposure data were collected from medical records and via a questionnaire, and covariates were examined to assess associations with BP-3 levels. BP-3 levels were elevated across all firefighter age groups, with the highest levels observed in the 35 to 39year old group. Body fat percentage had a significant inverse association with BP-3 concentrations. Our results indicate pervasive exposure to BP-3, BPA, triclosan, and methyl paraben in this population of firefighters, consistent with studies of other populations. Further research is needed to investigate possible explanations for the higher observed BP-3 levels, such as occupational or California-specific exposures. 
Gastrointestinal infections, a substantial public health problem worldwide, have been associated with single weather factors but the joint effect of multiple weather factors on gastrointestinal infections remains unclear.
We conducted a retrospective time-series analysis to investigate effects of weather conditions on hospitalizations for gastrointestinal infections (GIH) in New York State in July and August from 1991 to 2004. Applying generalized additive model (GAM), we evaluated the associations between daily GIH count and multiple weather factors including temperature, humidity, and precipitation (0-10 lag days), adjusting for long term trend, seasonality, and calendar effects.
Maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and maximum universal apparent temperature (UAT) showed that each °C increase in temperature was significantly associated with an increase (0.70-0.96%) in daily GIH count, with the greatest impacts observed at lag 1. Extreme heat (EH: &gt;90th percentile) (3.68% at lag 1) and precipitation (0.31% at lag 4) showed larger impacts on increases of GIH and a clear dose-response relationship for EH. Stratified analyses showed that the impacts of extreme heat on GIH tend to be greater among Hispanics, blacks, females, and those with bacterial infections.
We found that high maximum and minimum temperature, UAT, precipitation, and extreme heat in summer significantly increased the risks of GIH in NYS. Our findings also suggest that bacteria might be a significant cause for GIH in the summer, and minority, female and those with bacterial infection may be more vulnerable to heat's effects on GIH.
Previous National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) publications have addressed the issues of risk and dose limitation in radiation protection and included guidance on specific organs and the lens of the eye. NCRP decided to prepare an updated commentary intended to enhance the previous recommendations provided in earlier reports. The NCRP Scientific Committee 1-23 (SC 1-23) is charged with preparing a commentary that will evaluate recent studies on the radiation dose response for the development of cataracts and also consider the type and severity of the cataracts as well as the dose rate; provide guidance on whether existing dose limits to the lens of the eye should be changed in the United States; and suggest research needs regarding radiation effects on and dose limits to the lens of the eye. A status of the ongoing work of SC 1-23 was presented at the Annual Meeting, "Changing Regulations and Radiation Guidance: What Does the Future Hold?" The following represents a synopsis of a few main points in the current draft commentary. It is likely that several changes will be forthcoming as SC 1-23 responds to subject matter expert review and develops a final document, expected by mid 2016. 
Climate change is already taking a toll on human health, a toll that is likely to increase in coming decades. The relationship between risk perceptions and vulnerability to climate change's health threats has received little attention, even though an understanding of the dynamics of adaptation among particularly susceptible populations is becoming increasingly important. We demonstrate that some people whose health will suffer the greatest harms from climate change-due to social vulnerability, health susceptibility, and exposure to hazards-already feel they are at risk. In a 2013 survey we measured Maryland residents' climate beliefs, health risk perceptions, and household social vulnerability characteristics, including medical conditions (n = 2126). We paired survey responses with secondary data sources for residence in a floodplain and/or urban heat island to predict perceptions of personal and household climate health risk. General health risk perceptions, political ideology, and climate beliefs are the strongest predictors. Yet, people in households with the following characteristics also see themselves at higher risk: members with one or more medical conditions or disabilities; low income; racial/ethnic minorities; and residence in a floodplain. In light of these results, climate health communication among vulnerable populations should emphasize protective actions instead of risk messages. 
Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine disrupting environmental chemical. Urinary concentrations of BPA were measured in samples collected nationwide from Chinese young adults. The geometric mean urinary concentration of BPA in Chinese young adults was 2.23 ng/mL. The estimated daily exposure dose for BPA was 64.8 ng/kg bw/day. Contributions of various BPA sources to exposure in Chinese young adults were estimated. Dietary intake was the primary exposure pathway. The contribution of dietary intake, indoor dust, paper products and personal care products to BPA intake was 72.5 %, 0.74 %, 0.98 %, 0.22 % of the total exposure dose, respectively. This is the first study on the occurrence of BPA in young adults from most provinces and autonomous regions of China. The results can be used to establish a database for BPA exposure assessment for Chinese general population.
Synthetic phenolic antioxidants (SPAs), including 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxytoluene (BHT), are extensively used in food, cosmetic and plastic industries. Nevertheless, limited information is available on human exposures, other than the dietary sources, to SPAs. In this study, occurrence of 9 SPAs and their metabolites/degradation products was determined in 339 indoor dust collected from 12 countries. BHT was found in 99.5% of indoor dust samples from homes and microenvironments at concentrations that ranged from &lt; LOQ to 118 μg/g and 0.10 to 3460 μg/g, respectively. This is the first study to measure BHT metabolites in house dust (0.01-35.1 μg/g) and their concentrations accounted for 9.2-58% of the sum concentrations (∑SPAs). 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (BHT-CHO), 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-(hydroxymethyl)phenol (BHT-OH), 2,6-di-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone (BHT-Q) were the major derivatives of BHT found in dust samples. The concentrations of gallic acid esters (gallates) in dust from homes and microenvironments ranged from &lt; LOQ to 18.2 and &lt; LOQ to 684 μg/g, respectively. The concentrations and profiles of SPAs varied among countries and microenvironments. Significantly elevated concentrations of SPAs were found in dust from an e-waste workshop (1530 μg/g). The estimated daily intake (EDI) of BHT via house dust ingestion ranged from 0.40 to 222 ng/kg/d (95th percentile). 
Using current climate models, regional-scale changes for Florida over the next 100 years are predicted to include warming over terrestrial areas and very likely increases in the number of high temperature extremes. No uniform definition of a heat wave exists. Most past research on heat waves has focused on evaluating the aftermath of known heat waves, with minimal consideration of missing exposure information.
To identify and discuss methods of handling and imputing missing weather data and how those methods can affect identified periods of extreme heat in Florida.
In addition to ignoring missing data, temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal models are described and utilized to impute missing historical weather data from 1973 to 2012 from 43 Florida weather monitors. Calculated thresholds are used to define periods of extreme heat across Florida.
Modeling of missing data and imputing missing values can affect the identified periods of extreme heat, through the missing data itself or through the computed thresholds. The differences observed are related to the amount of missingness during June, July, and August, the warmest months of the warm season (April through September).
Missing data considerations are important when defining periods of extreme heat. Spatio-temporal methods are recommended for data imputation. A heat wave definition that incorporates information from all monitors is advised.
Formation of foam cells is a hallmark at the initial stages of atherosclerosis. Monocytes attracted by pro-inflammatory stimuli attach to the inflamed vascular endothelium and penetrate to the arterial intima where they differentiate to macrophages. Intimal macrophages phagocytize oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL). Several scavenger receptors (SR), including CD36, SR-A1 and lectin-like oxLDL receptor-1 (LOX-1), mediate oxLDL uptake. In late endosomes/lysosomes of macrophages, oxLDL are catabolysed. Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) hydrolyses cholesterol esters that are enriched in LDL to free cholesterol and free fatty acids. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), acyl coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase-1 (ACAT1) in turn catalyses esterification of cholesterol to store cholesterol esters as lipid droplets in the ER of macrophages. Neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolases nCEH and NCEH1 are involved in a secondary hydrolysis of cholesterol esters to liberate free cholesterol that could be then out-flowed from macrophages by cholesterol ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1 and SR-BI. In atherosclerosis, disruption of lipid homoeostasis in macrophages leads to cholesterol accumulation and formation of foam cells. 
The existing reviews and meta-analyses addressing unequal exposure of environmental hazards on certain populations have focused on several environmental pollutants or on the siting of hazardous facilities. This review updates and contributes to the environmental inequality literature by focusing on ambient criteria air pollutants (including NOx), by evaluating studies related to inequality by socioeconomic status (as opposed to race/ethnicity) and by providing a more global perspective. Overall, most North American studies have shown that areas where low-socioeconomic-status (SES) communities dwell experience higher concentrations of criteria air pollutants, while European research has been mixed. Research from Asia, Africa, and other parts of the world has shown a general trend similar to that of North America, but research in these parts of the world is limited. 
The social, emotional, and mental health benefits associated with gardening have been well documented. However, the processes underlying the relationship between garden participation and improvements in health status have not been sufficiently studied.
Using population-based survey data (n = 469 urban residents), objective street environment data, and area-level measures, this research used a path analytic framework to examine several theoretically based constructs as mediators between gardening history and self-reported health.
The results showed that garden participation influenced health status indirectly through social involvement with one's community, perceived aesthetic appeal of the neighborhood, and perceived collective efficacy. Gardeners, compared to non-gardeners, reported higher ratings of neighborhood aesthetics and more involvement in social activities, whereas aesthetics and involvement were associated with higher ratings of collective efficacy and neighborhood attachment. Collective efficacy, but not neighborhood attachment, predicted self-rated health. Gardening also directly influenced improved fruit and vegetable intake. The physical and social qualities of garden participation may therefore stimulate a range of interpersonal and social responses that are supportive of positive ratings of health.
This research suggests that community planners and health professionals should aim to strengthen the social and aesthetic relationships while designing environments and policies as a way to ignite intermediate processes that may lead to improved health status.
Benzophenone-3 (BP-3) is a widespread environmental contaminant and an estrogenic compound. Very little is known with regard to the occurrence in indoor air and the inhalation exposure of humans to BP-3. In this study, 81 indoor air samples were collected from various locations in Albany, New York, USA, in 2014 and analyzed for BP-3 by high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). BP-3 was found in all indoor air samples and the overall concentrations in bulk air (vapor plus particulate phases) were in the range of 0.19-72.0 ng/m(3) (geometric mean: 2.67 ng/m(3)). The highest concentrations (geometric mean: 10.7 ng/m(3)) were found in cars, followed by barber shops (6.57) ˃ public places (5.75)&gt;homes (3.27) ˃ offices (1.96) ˃ garages (1.04) ˃ laboratories (0.47). The estimated geometric mean daily intake (EDI) of BP-3 for infants, toddlers, children, teenagers, and adults through indoor air inhalation from homes was 1.83, 1.74, 1.18, 0.69, and 0.51 ng/kg-bw/day, respectively. Although high concentrations of BP-3 were measured in some microenvironments, the estimated contribution of indoor air to total BP-3 intake was &lt;5% of the total BP-3 intake in humans. This is the first survey on the occurrence of BP-3 in indoor air.
We sought to estimate the return on investment of a streamlined version of an evidence-based community health worker (CHW) asthma home visit program.
We used a randomized parallel group trial of home visits by CHWs to Medicaid-enrolled children with uncontrolled asthma versus usual care.
A total of 373 participants enrolled in the study (182 in the intervention group and 191 in the control group, of whom 154 and 179, respectively, completed the study). The intervention group had greater improvements in asthma symptom-free days (2.10 days more over 2 weeks; 95% CI =  1.17, 3.05; P &lt; .001) and caretakers' quality of life (0.43 units more; 95% CI = 0.20, 0.66; P &lt; .001) and a larger reduction in urgent health care utilization events (1.31 events fewer over 12 months; 95% CI = -2.10, -0.52; P = .001). The intervention arm compared with the control arm saved $1340.92 for the $707.04 additional costs invested for the average participant. The return on investment was 1.90.
A streamlined CHW asthma home visit program for children with uncontrolled asthma improved health outcomes and yielded a return on investment of 1.90.
Climate change is expected to cause increases in heat-related mortality, especially among the elderly and very young. However, additional studies are needed to clarify the effects of heat on morbidity across all age groups and across a wider range of temperatures.
We aimed to estimate the impact of current and projected future temperatures on morbidity and mortality in Rhode Island.
We used Poisson regression models to estimate the association between daily maximum temperature and rates of all-cause and heat-related emergency department (ED) admissions and all-cause mortality. We then used downscaled Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5; a standardized set of climate change model simulations) projections to estimate the excess morbidity and mortality that would be observed if this population were exposed to the temperatures projected for 2046-2053 and 2092-2099 under two representative concentration pathways (RCP): RCP 8.5 and 4.5.
Between 2005 and 2012, an increase in maximum daily temperature from 75 to 85°F was associated with 1.3% and 23.9% higher rates of all-cause and heat-related ED visits, respectively. The corresponding effect estimate for all-cause mortality from 1999 through 2011 was 4.0%. The association with all-cause ED admissions was strongest for those &lt; 18 or ≥ 65 years of age, whereas the association with heat-related ED admissions was most pronounced among 18- to 64-year-olds. If this Rhode Island population were exposed to temperatures projected under RCP 8.5 for 2092-2099, we estimate that there would be 1.2% (range, 0.6-1.6%) and 24.4% (range, 6.9-41.8%) more all-cause and heat-related ED admissions, respectively, and 1.6% (range, 0.8-2.1%) more deaths annually between April and October.
With all other factors held constant, our findings suggest that the current population of Rhode Island would experience substantially higher morbidity and mortality if maximum daily temperatures increase further as projected.

A growing number of studies have investigated the association between air pollution and the risk of birth defects, but results are inconsistent. The objective of this study was to examine whether maternal exposure to ambient PM2.5 or benzene increases the risk of selected birth defects in Florida.
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of singleton infants born in Florida from 2000 to 2009. Isolated and non-isolated birth defect cases of critical congenital heart defects, orofacial clefts, and spina bifida were identified from the Florida Birth Defects Registry. Estimates of maternal exposures to PM2.5 and benzene for all case and non-case pregnancies were derived by aggregation of ambient measurement data, obtained from the US Environmental Protection Agency Air Quality System, during etiologically relevant time windows. Multivariable Poisson regression was used to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each quartile of air pollutant exposure.
Compared to the first quartile of PM2.5 exposure, higher levels of exposure were associated with an increased risk of non-isolated truncus arteriosus (aPR4th Quartile, 8.80; 95% CI, 1.11-69.50), total anomalous pulmonary venous return (aPR2nd Quartile, 5.00; 95% CI, 1.10-22.84), coarctation of the aorta (aPR4th Quartile, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.15-2.57; aPR3rd Quartile, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.07-2.41), interrupted aortic arch (aPR4th Quartile, 5.50; 95% CI, 1.22-24.82), and isolated and non-isolated any critical congenital heart defect (aPR3rd Quartile, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.02-1.25; aPR4th Quartile, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.07-1.65). Mothers with the highest level of exposure to benzene were more likely to deliver an infant with an isolated cleft palate (aPR4th Quartile, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.13-2.04) or any orofacial cleft (aPR4th Quartile, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.08-1.56). An inverse association was observed between exposure to benzene and non-isolated pulmonary atresia (aPR4th Quartile, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.04-0.84).
Our results suggest a few associations between exposure to ambient PM2.5 or benzene and specific birth defects in Florida. However, many related comparisons showed no association. Hence, it remains unclear whether associations are clinically significant or can be causally related to air pollution exposures.
Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) and eight bisphenol analogues (BPs) including bisphenol A (BPA) were determined in 388 indoor (including homes and microenvironments) dust samples collected from 12 countries (China, Colombia, Greece, India, Japan, Kuwait, Pakistan, Romania, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, U.S., and Vietnam). The concentrations of TBBPA and sum of eight bisphenols (ƩBPs) in dust samples ranged from &lt;1 to 3600 and from 13 to 110,000 ng/g, respectively. The highest TBBPA concentrations in house dust were found in samples from Japan (median: 140 ng/g), followed by South Korea (84 ng/g) and China (23 ng/g). The highest ∑BPs concentrations were found in Greece (median: 3900 ng/g), Japan (2600 ng/g) and the U.S. (2200 ng/g). Significant variations in BPA concentrations were found in dust samples collected from various microenvironments in offices and homes. Concentrations of TBBPA in house dust were significantly correlated with BPA and ∑BPs. Among the nine target chemicals analyzed, BPA was the predominant compound in dust from all countries. The proportion of TBBPA in sum concentrations of nine phenolic compounds analyzed in this study was the highest in dust samples from China (27%) and the lowest in Greece (0.41%). The median estimated daily intake (EDI) of ∑BPs through dust ingestion was the highest in Greece (1.6-17 ng/kg bw/day), Japan (1.3-16) and the U.S. (0.89-9.6) for various age groups. Nevertheless, in comparison with the reported BPA exposure doses through diet, dust ingestion accounted for less than 10% of the total exposure doses in China and the U.S. For TBBPA, the EDI for infants and toddlers ranged from 0.01 to 3.4 ng/kg bw/day, and dust ingestion is an important pathway for exposure accounting for 3.8-35% (median) of exposure doses in China.
There are multiple treatment options for the control of legionellae in premise hot water systems. Water chemistry plays a role in the efficacy of these treatments and should be considered when selecting a treatment. This study demonstrated the efficacy of copper-silver ionization (CSI) under alkaline water conditions in 2 health care facilities.
Monitoring for copper (Cu) and silver (Ag) ions was performed, and the corresponding percentage of positive Legionella cultures was monitored. Low Legionella colony forming units (CFU), with a mean &lt;10 CFU/100 mL, and ≤30% positive culture for each sampling period, along with no recurrent disease, were considered indicative of control.
CSI treatment was shown to reduce both the number of CFU found and the percentage of samples found to be culture positive. After treatment was established, culture positivity was, for example, reduced from 70% (&gt;10(3) CFU/100 mL) to consistently &lt;30% (38 CFU/100 mL).
Control of legionellae in premise water systems may be a complex process requiring long-term assessments for adequate control. This work found that CSI could be successful in controlling Legionella under alkaline water conditions, and the evidence suggests that Ag ions are responsible for the control of Legionella pneumophila 1, L pneumophila 6, and L anisa.
Ciguatera is the most commonly reported marine food-borne illness worldwide. Because there is a biological plausibility that ciguatera may be impacted by long-term climate variability and Florida is on the northern border of the geographic distribution of ciguatera, it is important to update our understanding of its epidemiology in Florida. We performed an analysis of 291 reports in Florida from 2000 to 2011 and an e-mail survey of 5,352 recreational fishers to estimate incidence and underreporting and identify high risk demographic groups, fish types, and catch locations. Incidence was 5.6 per 100,000 adjusted for underreporting. Hispanics had the highest incidence rate (relative risk [RR] = 3.4) and were more likely to eat barracuda than non-Hispanics. The most common catch locations for ciguatera-causing fish were the Bahamas and Florida Keys. Cases caused by fish from northern Florida were infrequent. These results indicate that ciguatera incidence is higher than estimated from public health reports alone. There is little evidence that incidence or geographic range has increased because of increased seawater temperatures since earlier studies. 
Salmonella is a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide. Patterns of salmonellosis have been linked to weather events. However, there is a dearth of data regarding the association between extreme events and risk of salmonellosis, and how this risk may disproportionately impact coastal communities.
We obtained Salmonella case data from the Maryland Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (2002-2012), and weather data from the National Climatic Data Center (1960-2012). We developed exposure metrics related to extreme temperature and precipitation events using a 30 year baseline (1960-1989) and linked them with county-level salmonellosis data. Data were analyzed using negative binomial Generalized Estimating Equations.
We observed a 4.1% increase in salmonellosis risk associated with a 1 unit increase in extreme temperature events (incidence rate ratio (IRR):1.041; 95% confidence interval (CI):1.013-1.069). This increase in risk was more pronounced in coastal versus non-coastal areas (5.1% vs 1.5%). Likewise, we observed a 5.6% increase in salmonellosis risk (IRR:1.056; CI:1.035-1.078) associated with a 1 unit increase in extreme precipitation events, with the impact disproportionately felt in coastal areas (7.1% vs 3.6%).
To our knowledge, this is the first empirical evidence showing that extreme temperature/precipitation events-that are expected to be more frequent and intense in coming decades-are disproportionately impacting coastal communities with regard to salmonellosis. Adaptation strategies need to account for this differential burden, particularly in light of ever increasing coastal populations.
State-issued identification cards are a promising data source for neighborhood-level obesity estimates.
We used information from three million Oregon state-issued identification cards to compute age-adjusted estimates of average adult body mass index (BMI) for each census tract in the state. We used multivariate linear regression to identify associations between weight status and population characteristics, food access, commuting behavior, and geography.
Together, home values, education, race, ethnicity, car commuting, and rural-urban commuting area (RUCA) explained 86% of the variation in BMI among tracts. BMI was lower in areas with higher home values and greater educational attainment, and higher in areas with more workers commuting by car.
Our findings are consistent with other research on socioeconomic disparities in obesity. This demonstrates state-issued identification cards are a promising data source for BMI surveillance and may offer new insight into the association between weight status and economic and environmental factors. Public health agencies should explore options for developing their own obesity estimates from identification card data.
Extreme heat has been associated with increased mortality, particularly in temperate climates. Few epidemiologic studies have considered the Pacific Northwest region in their analyses. This study quantified the historical (May to September, 1980-2010) heat-mortality relationship in the most populous Pacific Northwest County, King County, Washington. A relative risk (RR) analysis was used to explore the relationship between heat and all-cause mortality on 99th percentile heat days, while a time series analysis, using a piece-wise linear model fit, was used to estimate the effect of heat intensity on mortality, adjusted for temporal trends. For all ages, all causes, we found a 10% (1.10 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.06, 1.14)) increase in the risk of death on a heat day versus non-heat day. When considering the intensity effect of heat on all-cause mortality, we found a 1.69% (95% CI, 0.69, 2.70) increase in the risk of death per unit of humidex above 36.0°C. Mortality stratified by cause and age produced statistically significant results using both types of analyses for: all-cause, non-traumatic, circulatory, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and diabetes causes of death. All-cause mortality was statistically significantly modified by the type of synoptic weather type. These results demonstrate that heat, expressed as humidex, is associated with increased mortality on heat days, and that risk increases with heat's intensity. While age was the only individual-level characteristic found to modify mortality risks, statistically significant increases in diabetes-related mortality for the 45-64 age group suggests that underlying health status may contribute to these risks.
Occupational exposures, including those to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), are suspected risk factors for myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN).
We investigated occupational exposures and MPN risk (54 cases and 472 controls) in a population-based case-control study in three rural Pennsylvania counties. Occupational histories, coded to SIC/SOC 1980, were linked to a previously created PAH job-exposure matrix. Odds ratios for industry (17 categories), occupation (26 categories), and PAH exposure were adjusted using logistic regression.
No industries or occupations were strongly or consistently associated with increased MPN risk. Analysis of employment duration found that being employed for 5 or more years in transportation, communications, and other public utilities was associated with MPN risk. There was no indication of an association with cumulative PAH exposure.
These few associations did not appear to have a common exposure. This exploratory study does not support the hypothesis that occupational exposure, including PAH, are strong risk factors for MPNs.
Public health climate change adaptation planning is an urgent priority requiring stakeholder feedback. The 10 Essential Public Health Services can be applied to adaptation activities.
To develop a state health department climate and health adaptation plan as informed by stakeholder feedback.
With Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funding, the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) implemented a 2010-2013 climate and health planning process, including 7 surveys on perceptions and adaptation priorities.
New York State Department of Health program managers participated in initial (n = 41, denominator unknown) and follow-up (72.2%) needs assessments. Surveillance system information was collected from 98.1% of surveillance system managers. For adaptation prioritization surveys, participants included 75.4% of NYSDOH leaders; 60.3% of local health departments (LHDs); and 53.7% of other stakeholders representing environmental, governmental, health, community, policy, academic, and business organizations. Interviews were also completed with 38.9% of other stakeholders.
In 2011 surveys, 34.1% of state health program directors believed that climate change would impact their program priorities. However, 84.6% of state health surveillance system managers provided ideas for using databases for climate and health monitoring/surveillance. In 2012 surveys, 46.5% of state health leaders agreed they had sufficient information about climate and health compared to 17.1% of LHDs (P = .0046) and 40.9% of other stakeholders (nonsignificant difference). Significantly fewer (P &lt; .0001) LHDs (22.9%) were incorporating or considering incorporating climate and health into planning compared to state health leaders (55.8%) and other stakeholders (68.2%). Stakeholder groups agreed on the 4 highest priority adaptation categories including core public health activities such as surveillance, coordination/collaboration, education, and policy development.
Feedback from diverse stakeholders was utilized by NYSDOH to develop its Climate and Health Strategic Map in 2013. The CDC Building Resilience Against Climate Effects (BRACE) framework and funding provides a collaborative model for state climate and health adaptation planning.
Algae and cyanobacteria are present in all aquatic environments. We do not have a good sense of the extent of human and animal exposures to cyanobacteria or their toxins, nor do we understand the public health impacts from acute exposures associated with recreational activities or chronic exposures associated with drinking water. We describe the Harmful Algal Bloom-related Illness Surveillance System (HABISS) and summarize the collected reports describing bloom events and associated adverse human and animal health events. For the period of 2007-2011, Departments of Health and/or Environment from 11 states funded by the National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention contributed reports for 4534 events. For 2007, states contributed 173 reports from historical data. The states participating in the HABISS program built response capacity through targeted public outreach and prevention activities, including supporting routine cyanobacteria monitoring for public recreation waters. During 2007-2010, states used monitoring data to support196 public health advisories or beach closures. The information recorded in HABISS and the application of these data to develop a wide range of public health prevention and response activities indicate that cyanobacteria and algae blooms are an environmental public health issue that needs continuing attention.
The extensive use of environmental phenols (e.g., bisphenol A) and heterocyclic aromatic compounds (e.g., benzothiazole) in consumer products as well as widespread exposure of humans to these compounds have been well documented. Biomonitoring studies have used urinary measurements to assess exposures, based on the assumption that these chemicals are metabolized and eliminated in urine. Despite the fact that some of these chemicals are moderately lipophilic, the extent of their accumulation in adipose fat tissues has not been convincingly demonstrated. In this study, human adipose fat samples (N=20) collected from New York City, USA, were analyzed for the presence of environmental phenols, including bisphenol A (BPA), benzophenone-3 (BP-3), triclosan (TCS), and parabens, as well as heterocyclic aromatic compounds, including benzotriazole (BTR), benzothiazole (BTH), and their derivatives. BPA and TCS were frequently detected in adipose tissues at concentrations (geometric mean [GM]: 3.95ng/g wet wt for BPA and 7.21ng/g wet wt for TCS) similar to or below the values reported for human urine. High concentrations of BP-3 were found in human adipose tissues (GM: 43.4; maximum: 4940ng/g wet wt) and a positive correlation between BP-3 concentrations and donor's age was observed. The metabolite of parabens, p-hydroxybenzoic acid (p-HB), also was found at elevated levels (GM: 4160; max.: 17,400ng/g wet wt) and a positive correlation between donor's age and sum concentration of parabens and p-HB were found. The GM concentrations of BTR and BTH in human adipose tissues were below 1ng/g, although the methylated forms of BTR (i.e., TTR and XTR) and the hydrated form of BTH (i.e., 2-OH-BTH) were frequently detected in adipose samples, indicating widespread exposure to these compounds. Our results suggest that adipose tissue is an important repository for BP-3 and parabens, including p-HB, in the human body.
Siloxanes are used widely in a variety of consumer products, including cosmetics, personal care products, medical and electrical devices, cookware, and building materials. Nevertheless, little is known on the occurrence of siloxanes in indoor dust. In this survey, five cyclic (D3-D7) and 11 linear (L4-L14) siloxanes were determined in 310 indoor dust samples collected from 12 countries. Dust samples collected from Greece contained the highest concentrations of total cyclic siloxanes (TCSi), ranging from 118 to 25,100ng/g (median: 1380), and total linear siloxanes (TLSi), ranging from 129 to 4990ng/g (median: 772). The median total siloxane (TSi) concentrations in dust samples from 12 countries were in the following decreasing order: Greece (2970ng/g), Kuwait (2400), South Korea (1810), Japan (1500), the USA (1220), China (1070), Romania (538), Colombia (230), Vietnam (206), Saudi Arabia (132), India (116), and Pakistan (68.3). TLSi concentrations as high as 42,800ng/g (Kuwait) and TCSi concentrations as high as 25,000ng/g (Greece) were found in indoor dust samples. Among the 16 siloxanes determined, decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5) was found at the highest concentration in dust samples from all countries, except for Japan and South Korea, with a predominance of L11; Kuwait, with L10; and Pakistan and Romania, with L12. The composition profiles of 16 siloxanes in dust samples varied by country. TCSi accounted for a major proportion of TSi concentrations in dust collected from Colombia (90%), India (80%) and Saudi Arabia (70%), whereas TLSi predominated in samples collected from Japan (89%), Kuwait (85%), and South Korea (78%). Based on the measured median TSi concentrations in indoor dust, we estimated human exposure doses through indoor dust ingestion for various age groups. The exposure doses ranged from 0.27 to 11.9ng/kg-bw/d for toddlers and 0.06 to 2.48ng/kg-bw/d for adults.
To assess gaps in emergency department (ED) asthma management at Florida hospitals.
Survey instrument with open- and closed-ended questions. Topics included availability of specific asthma management modalities, compliance with national guidelines, employment of specialized asthma care personnel, and efforts toward performance improvement.
Emergency departments at 10 large hospitals in the state of Florida.
Clinical care providers and health administrators from participating hospitals.
Compliance with national asthma care guideline standards, provision of specific recommended treatment modalities and resources, employment of specialized asthma care personnel, and engagement in performance improvement efforts.
Our results suggest inconsistency among sampled Florida hospitals' adherence to national standards for treatment of asthma in EDs. Several hospitals were refining their emergency care protocols to incorporate guideline recommendations. Despite a lack of formal ED protocols in some hospitals, adherence to national guidelines for emergency care nonetheless remained robust for patient education and medication prescribing, but it was weaker for formal care planning and medical follow-up.
Identified deficiencies in emergency asthma care present a number of opportunities for strategic mitigation of identified gaps. We conclude with suggestions to help Florida hospitals achieve success with ED asthma care reform. Team-based learning activities may offer an optimal strategy for sharing and implementing best practices.
The impact of heat on mortality is well documented but deaths tend to occur after (or lag) extreme heat events, and mortality data is generally not available for timely surveillance during extreme heat events. Recently, systems for near-real time surveillance of heat illness have been reported but have not been validated as predictors of non-external cause of deaths associated with extreme heat events. We analyzed associations between daily weather conditions, emergency medical system (EMS) calls flagged as heat-related by EMS dispatchers, emergency department (ED) visits classified as heat-related based on chief complaint text, and excess non-external cause mortality in New York City. EMS and ED data were obtained from data reported daily to the city health department for syndromic surveillance. We fit generalized linear models to assess the relationships of daily counts of heat related EMS and ED visits to non-external cause deaths after adjustment for weather conditions during the months of May-September between 1999 and 2013. Controlling for temporal trends, a 7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 2-12) and 6% (95% CI: 3-10) increase in non-external cause mortality was associated with an increase from the 50th percentile to 99th percentile of same-day and one-day lagged heat-related EMS calls and ED visits, respectively. After controlling for both temporal trends and weather, we observed a 7% (95% CI: 3-12) increase in non-external cause mortality associated with one-day lagged heat-related EMS calls and a 5% mortality increase with one-day lagged ED visits (95% CI: 2-8). Heat-related illness can be tracked during extreme heat events using EMS and ED data which are indicators of heat associated excess non-external cause mortality during the warm weather season.
Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and cholesterol homeostasis in the peripheral blood is maintained by specialized cells, such as macrophages. Macrophages express a variety of scavenger receptors (SR) that interact with lipoproteins, including SR-A1, CD36, and lectin-like oxLDL receptor-1 (LOX-1). These cells also have several cholesterol transporters, including ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCA1, ABCG1, and SR-BI, that are involved in reverse cholesterol transport. Lipids internalized by phagocytosis are transported to late endosomes/lysosomes, where lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) digests cholesteryl esters releasing free cholesterol. Free cholesterol in turn is processed by acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (ACAT1), an enzyme that transforms cholesterol to cholesteryl esters. The endoplasmic reticulum serves as a depot for maintaining newly synthesized cholesteryl esters that can be processed by neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase (NCEH), which generates free cholesterol that can exit via cholesterol transporters. In atherosclerosis, pro-inflammatory stimuli upregulate expression of scavenger receptors, especially LOX-1, and downregulate expression of cholesterol transporters. ACAT1 is also increased, while NCEH expression is reduced. This results in deposition of free and esterified cholesterol in macrophages and generation of foam cells. Moreover, other cell types, such as endothelial (ECs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), can also become foam cells. In this review, we discuss known pathways of foam cell formation in atherosclerosis.
The purpose of this study was to identify predictors of increasing incidence of Spotted Fever Group rickettsioses (SFGR) in Illinois, with a specific focus on weather variables. We analysed cases of SFGR reported to the Illinois Department of Public Health from 2004 to 2013. Surveillance definitions changed in 2008 and 2010, but those changes alone did not account for observed spikes in incidence in 2008, 2012 and 2013. A total of 590 cases of SFGR occurred, with the majority in the southernmost portion of the state. Only 3·4% of the reported cases were considered confirmed under the case definition. Increased mean winter temperature (IRR 1·32, CI 1·25-1·40) and increased precipitation (IRR 1·08, CI 1·04-1·11) were each associated with increased incidence of SFGR. Our findings show that weather appears to play a significant role in explaining the increasing annual incidence of SFGR in Illinois.
We evaluated a novel syndromic surveillance query, developed by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) Heat Syndrome Workgroup, for identifying heat-related illness cases in near real time, using emergency department and inpatient hospital data from Maricopa County, Arizona, in 2015.
The Maricopa County Department of Public Health applied 2 queries for heat-related illness to area hospital data transmitted to the National Syndromic Surveillance Program BioSense Platform: the BioSense "heat, excessive" query and the novel CSTE query. We reviewed the line lists generated by each query and used the diagnosis code and chief complaint text fields to find probable cases of heat-related illness. For each query, we calculated positive predictive values (PPVs) for heat-related illness.
The CSTE query identified 674 records, of which 591 were categorized as probable heat-related illness, demonstrating a PPV of 88% for heat-related illness. The BioSense query identified 791 patient records, of which 589 were probable heat-related illness, demonstrating a PPV of 74% for heat-related illness. The PPV was substantially higher for the CSTE novel and BioSense queries during the heat season (May 1 to September 30; 92% and 85%, respectively) than during the cooler seasons (55% and 29%, respectively).
A novel query for heat-related illness that combined diagnosis codes, chief complaint text terms, and exclusion criteria had a high PPV for heat-related illness, particularly during the heat season. Public health departments can use this query to meet local needs; however, use of this novel query to substantially improve public health heat-related illness prevention remains to be seen.
To improve heat-related illness surveillance, we evaluated and refined North Carolina's heat syndrome case definition.
We analyzed North Carolina emergency department (ED) visits during 2012-2014. We evaluated the current heat syndrome case definition (ie, keywords in chief complaint/triage notes or International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification [ ICD-9-CM] codes) and additional heat-related inclusion and exclusion keywords. We calculated the positive predictive value and sensitivity of keyword-identified ED visits and manually reviewed ED visits to identify true positives and false positives.
The current heat syndrome case definition identified 8928 ED visits; additional inclusion keywords identified another 598 ED visits. Of 4006 keyword-identified ED visits, 3216 (80.3%) were captured by 4 phrases: "heat ex" (n = 1674, 41.8%), "overheat" (n = 646, 16.1%), "too hot" (n = 594, 14.8%), and "heatstroke" (n = 302, 7.5%). Among the 267 ED visits identified by keyword only, a burn diagnosis or the following keywords resulted in a false-positive rate &gt;95%: "burn," "grease," "liquid," "oil," "radiator," "antifreeze," "hot tub," "hot spring," and "sauna." After applying the revised inclusion and exclusion criteria, we identified 9132 heat-related ED visits: 2157 by keyword only, 5493 by ICD-9-CM code only, and 1482 by both (sensitivity = 27.0%, positive predictive value = 40.7%). Cases identified by keywords were strongly correlated with cases identified by ICD-9-CM codes (rho = .94, P &lt; .001).
Revising the heat syndrome case definition through the use of additional inclusion and exclusion criteria substantially improved the accuracy of the surveillance system. Other jurisdictions may benefit from refining their heat syndrome case definition.
Electronic health record (EHR) systems provide an opportunity to use a novel data source for population health surveillance. Validation studies that compare prevalence estimates from EHRs and surveys most often use difference testing, which can, because of large sample sizes, lead to detection of significant differences that are not meaningful. We explored a novel application of the two one-sided t test (TOST) to assess the equivalence of prevalence estimates in 2 population-based surveys to inform margin selection for validating EHR-based surveillance prevalence estimates derived from large samples.
We compared prevalence estimates of health indicators in the 2013 Community Health Survey (CHS) and the 2013-2014 New York City Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NYC HANES) by using TOST, a 2-tailed t test, and other goodness-of-fit measures.
A ±5 percentage-point equivalence margin for a TOST performed well for most health indicators. For health indicators with a prevalence estimate of less than 10% (extreme obesity [CHS, 3.5%; NYC HANES, 5.1%] and serious psychological distress [CHS, 5.2%; NYC HANES, 4.8%]), a ±2.5 percentage-point margin was more consistent with other goodness-of-fit measures than the larger percentage-point margins.
A TOST with a ±5 percentage-point margin was useful in establishing equivalence, but a ±2.5 percentage-point margin may be appropriate for health indicators with a prevalence estimate of less than 10%. Equivalence testing can guide future efforts to validate EHR data.
We evaluated the effects of ozone on respiratory-related hospital admissions in three counties in Washington State from 1990 to 2006. We further examined vulnerability to ozone by key demographic factors.
Using linked hospital admission and ambient monitoring data, we estimated the age-, sex-, and health insurance-stratified associations between ozone (0 to 3 days' lag) and respiratory-related hospital admissions in King, Spokane, and Clark County, Washington.
The adjusted relative risk (RR) for a 10 ppb increase in ozone at 3 days' lag was 1.04 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02, 1.07) for Clark County, 1.03 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.05) for Spokane County, and 1.02 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.03) for King County. There was consistent evidence of effect modification by age.
Ozone at levels below federal standards contributes to respiratory morbidity among high-risk groups in Washington.
Electronic health records (EHRs) and electronic laboratory records (ELRs) are increasingly seen as a rich source of data for performing public health surveillance activities and monitoring community health status. Their potential for surveillance of chronic illness, however, may be underused. Our objectives were to (1) evaluate the use of EHRs and ELRs for diabetes surveillance in 2 California counties and (2) examine disparities in diabetes prevalence by geography, income, and race/ethnicity.
We obtained data on a clinical diagnosis of diabetes and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test results for adult members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California living in Contra Costa County or Solano County at any time during 2010-2014. We evaluated the validity of using HbA1c test results to determine diabetes prevalence, using clinical diagnoses as a gold standard. We estimated disparities in diabetes prevalence by combining HbA1c test results with US Census data on income, race, and ethnicity.
When compared with a clinical diagnosis of diabetes, data on a patient's 5-year maximum HbA1c value ≥6.5% yielded the best combination of sensitivity (87.4%) and specificity (99.2%). The prevalence of 5-year maximum HbA1c ≥6.5% decreased with increasing median family income and increased with greater proportions of residents who were either non-Hispanic black or Hispanic.
Timely diabetes surveillance data from ELRs can be used to document disparities, target interventions, and evaluate changes in population health. ELR data may be easier to access than a patient's entire EHR, but outcome metric validation with diabetes diagnoses would need to be ongoing. Future research should validate ELR and EHR data across multiple providers.
Teaming Up for Asthma Control (TUAC) is a work force development intervention to improve asthma control among children by increasing the competency of school nurses and delivering guideline-based education. We hypothesized that the knowledge and skills of participating school nurses would improve and that this change would positively affect students' asthma health and reduce health care utilization cost.
Asthma education for school nurses was provided online in a pretest/posttest format or in instructor-led groups. Students with persistent asthma were identified by using a checklist. Expert evaluators obtained student participants' preassessments/postassessments before and after the 3 asthma checkups by the school nurse, and the assessments were compared. Health care costs were assessed using Medicaid administrative claims data.
A total of 54 school nurses and 178 students in Missouri participated in the TUAC evaluation from 2011 through 2014. Among school nurses who completed the online education (n = 42, 77.8%), knowledge scores significantly increased from pretest (49.1%) to posttest (90.7%, P &lt; .001). Of school nurses who completed assessments on 3 children (n = 34), 91.2% met the ±6% equivalence for 1 or more assessments on forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) compared with the expert evaluator. At enrollment, 69.7% of students had "not well-controlled" or "very poorly controlled" asthma. Postintervention, FEV1 significantly improved (82.9% to 92.1% predicted), and self-reported impairment and tobacco smoke exposure significantly declined (P &lt; .001). For TUAC students enrolled in Medicaid, there was an average 12-month health care cost difference (-$1,431) compared with controls.
School nurses effectively assessed asthma status, students' outcomes improved, and health care utilization costs declined. This evaluation contributed to program improvements to further improve health outcomes among students with asthma.
Heat-related morbidity and mortality is a recognized public health concern. However, public health officials need to base policy decisions on local evidence, which is often lacking for smaller communities.
To evaluate the association between maximum daily heat index (HI) and morbidity and mortality in 15 New England communities (combined population: 2.7 million) in order to provide actionable evidence for local officials.
We applied overdispersed Poisson nonlinear distributed lag models to evaluate the association between HI and daily (May-September) emergency department (ED) admissions and deaths in each of 15 study sites in New Hampshire, Maine, and Rhode Island, controlling for time trends, day of week, and federal holidays. Site-specific estimates were meta-analyzed to provide regional estimates.
Associations (sometimes non-linear) were observed between HI and each health outcome. For example, a day with a HI of 95°F vs. 75°F was associated with a cumulative 7.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.5%, 8.5%) and 5.1% (95% CI: 0.2%, 10.3%) higher rate of all-cause ED visits and deaths, respectively, with some evidence of regional heterogeneity. We estimate that in the study area, days with a HI≥95°F were associated with an annual average of 784 (95% CI: 658, 908) excess ED visits and 22 (95% CI: 3, 39) excess deaths.
Our results suggest the presence of adverse health impacts associated with HI below the current local guideline criteria of HI≥100°F used to issue heat advisories. We hypothesize that lowering this threshold may lead to substantially reduced heat-related morbidity and mortality in the study area.
Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), found in many household products and classed as endocrine disrupting chemicals, can be transferred through the placenta and are associated with multiple developmental deficits in offspring. Using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), we investigated the association between intrauterine exposure to PFAS and early communication development in 432 mother-daughter dyads at 15 and 38months of age. Concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), and perfluorononanoate (PFNA) were measured in maternal serum collected during pregnancy. Early communication development was measured with the ALSPAC-adapted MacArthur Communicative Development Inventories for Infants and Toddlers. The infant questionnaire measured verbal comprehension, vocabulary comprehension and production, nonverbal communication, and social development. The toddler questionnaire measured language, intelligibility, and communicative sub-scores. Multivariable linear regression was used to examine associations between each PFAS exposure and each communication sub-scale score. The association between maternal PFAS concentrations and early communication development at 15 and 38months of age varied by maternal age at delivery. In daughters of younger mothers (&lt;25years of age), every 1ng/mL of PFOS was associated with a 3.82 point (95% confidence interval (CI): -6.18, -1.47) lower vocabulary score at 15months and a 0.80 point (95% CI: -1.74, 0.14) lower language score at 38months. Prenatal exposure to select PFAS was positively and negatively associated with communication development among girls, with inconsistent pattern of association across all measured PFAS and endpoints.
The disease burden due to heat-stress illness (HSI), which can result in significant morbidity and mortality, is expected to increase as the climate continues to warm. In the United States (U.S.) much of what is known about HSI epidemiology is from analyses of urban heat waves. There is limited research addressing whether HSI hospitalization risk varies between urban and rural areas, nor is much known about additional diagnoses of patients hospitalized for HSI.
Hospitalizations in Illinois for HSI (ICD-9-CM codes 992.x or E900) in the months of May through September from 1987 to 2014 (n = 8667) were examined. Age-adjusted mean monthly hospitalization rates were calculated for each county using U.S. Census population data. Counties were categorized into five urban-rural strata using Rural Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC) (RUCC1, most urbanized to RUCC5, thinly populated). Average maximum monthly temperature (°C) was calculated for each county using daily data. Multi-level linear regression models were used, with county as the fixed effect and temperature as random effect, to model monthly hospitalization rates, adjusting for the percent of county population below the poverty line, percent of population that is Non-Hispanic Black, and percent of the population that is Hispanic. All analyses were stratified by county RUCC. Additional diagnoses of patients hospitalized for HSI and charges for hospitalization were summarized.
Highest rates of HSI hospitalizations were seen in the most rural, thinly populated stratum (mean annual summer hospitalization rate of 1.16 hospitalizations per 100,000 population in the thinly populated strata vs. 0.45 per 100,000 in the metropolitan urban strata). A one-degree Celsius increase in maximum monthly average temperature was associated with a 0.34 increase in HSI hospitalization rate per 100,000 population in the thinly populated counties compared with 0.02 per 100,000 in highly urbanized counties. The most common additional diagnoses of patients hospitalized with HSI were dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, and acute renal disorders. Total and mean hospital charges for HSI cases were $167.7 million and $20,500 (in 2014 US dollars).
Elevated temperatures appear to have different impacts on HSI hospitalization rates as function of urbanization. The most rural and the most urbanized counties of Illinois had the largest increases in monthly hospitalization rates for HSI per unit increase in the average monthly maximum temperature. This suggests that vulnerability of communities to heat is complex and strategies to reduce HSI may need to be tailored to the degree of urbanization of a county.
The primary objective of this study was to identify patients with heat-related illness (HRI) using codes for heat-related injury diagnosis and external cause of injury in 3 administrative data sets: emergency department (ED) visit records, hospital discharge records, and death certificates.
We obtained data on ED visits, hospitalizations, and deaths for Florida residents for May 1 through October 31, 2005-2012. To identify patients with HRI, we used codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification ( ICD-9-CM) to search data on ED visits and hospitalizations and codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision ( ICD-10) to search data on deaths. We stratified the results by data source and whether the HRI was work related.
We identified 23 981 ED visits, 4816 hospitalizations, and 140 deaths in patients with non-work-related HRI and 2979 ED visits, 415 hospitalizations, and 23 deaths in patients with work-related HRI. The most common diagnosis codes among patients were for severe HRI (heat exhaustion or heatstroke). The proportion of patients with a severe HRI diagnosis increased with data source severity. If ICD-9-CM code E900.1 and ICD-10 code W92 (excessive heat of man-made origin) were used as exclusion criteria for HRI, 5.0% of patients with non-work-related deaths, 3.0% of patients with work-related ED visits, and 1.7% of patients with work-related hospitalizations would have been removed.
Using multiple data sources and all diagnosis fields may improve the sensitivity of HRI surveillance. Future studies should evaluate the impact of converting ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes on HRI surveillance of ED visits and hospitalizations.
The number of restaurants serving sushi within Minnesota is continuously increasing. The practices and protocols of serving raw fish are complex and require detailed planning to ensure that food served to patrons will not cause illness. Although the popularity of sushi is increasing, there is a lack of research on food safety issues pertaining to preparation of raw fish and sushi rice. To address this gap, the Minnesota Department of Health Environmental Health Specialists Network Food program collected descriptive data on restaurant practices and policies concerning the service of raw fish and sushi rice in 40 Minnesota restaurants. At each restaurant, a specialist interviewed a restaurant manager, conducted an observation of the sushi prep areas in the restaurant kitchen, and reviewed parasite destruction letters and invoices from fish supplier(s). Over half of the restaurants (59%) were missing one or more of the parasite destruction letters from their fish supplier(s) guaranteeing that fish had been properly frozen to the time and temperature requirements in the Minnesota Food Code. A total of 42 parasite destruction letters from suppliers were observed; 10% were considered "adequate" letters. The majority of the letters were missing details pertaining to the types of fish frozen, the length of time fish were frozen, or details on what temperatures fish were held frozen or a combination of all three. Most restaurants were using time as a public health control for their sushi rice. For those restaurants using time as a public health control, 26% had a written procedure on-site, and approximately 53% were keeping track of time. Bare hand contact during sushi prep was observed in 17% of restaurants, and in more than 40% of the restaurants, at least one fish was mislabeled on the menu. Findings from this study indicate that many Minnesota restaurants are not complying with the Food Code requirements pertaining to parasite destruction for the service of raw fish or the use of time as a public health control for sushi rice.
Few studies have examined the association between exposure to extreme heat events and risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or demonstrated which populations are most vulnerable to the effects of extreme heat. We defined extreme heat events as days when the daily maximum temperature (TMAX) exceeded the location- and calendar day-specific 95th percentile of the distribution of daily TMAX during the 30-year baseline period (1960-1989). We used a time-stratified case-crossover design to analyze the association between exposure to extreme heat events and risk of hospitalization for AMI in the summer months (June-August) with 0, 1, or 2 lag days. There were a total of 32,670 AMI hospitalizations during the summer months in Maryland between 2000 and 2012. Overall, extreme heat events on the day of hospitalization were associated with an increased risk of AMI (lag 0 OR=1.11; 95% CI: 1.05-1.17). Results considering lag periods immediately before hospitalization were comparable, but effect estimates varied among several population subgroups. As extreme weather events are expected to become more frequent and intense in response to our changing climate, community-specific adaptation strategies are needed to account for the differential susceptibility across ethnic subgroups and geographic areas.
Electronic health records (EHRs) offer potential for population health surveillance but EHR-based surveillance measures require validation prior to use. We assessed the validity of obesity, smoking, depression, and influenza vaccination indicators from a new EHR surveillance system, the New York City (NYC) Macroscope. This report is the second in a 3-part series describing the development and validation of the NYC Macroscope. The first report describes in detail the infrastructure underlying the NYC Macroscope; design decisions that were made to maximize data quality; characteristics of the population sampled; completeness of data collected; and lessons learned from doing this work. This second report, which addresses concerns related to sampling bias and data quality, describes the methods used to evaluate the validity and robustness of NYC Macroscope prevalence estimates; presents validation results for estimates of obesity, smoking, depression and influenza vaccination; and discusses the implications of our findings for NYC and for other jurisdictions embarking on similar work. The third report applies the same validation methods described in this report to metabolic outcomes, including the prevalence, treatment and control of diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
NYC Macroscope prevalence estimates, overall and stratified by sex and age group, were compared to reference survey estimates for adult New Yorkers who reported visiting a doctor in the past year. Agreement was evaluated against 5 a priori criteria. Sensitivity and specificity were assessed by examining individual EHR records in a subsample of 48 survey participants.
Among adult New Yorkers in care, the NYC Macroscope prevalence estimate for smoking (15.2%) fell between estimates from NYC HANES (17.7 %) and CHS (14.9%) and met all 5 a priori criteria. The NYC Macroscope obesity prevalence estimate (27.8%) also fell between the NYC HANES (31.3%) and CHS (24.7%) estimates, but met only 3 a priori criteria. Sensitivity and specificity exceeded 0.90 for both the smoking and obesity indicators. The NYC Macroscope estimates of depression and influenza vaccination prevalence were more than 10 percentage points lower than the estimates from either reference survey. While specificity was &gt; 0.90 for both of these indicators, sensitivity was &lt; 0.70.
Through this work we have demonstrated that EHR data from a convenience sample of providers can produce acceptable estimates of smoking and obesity prevalence among adult New Yorkers in care; gained a better understanding of the challenges involved in estimating depression prevalence from EHRs; and identified areas for additional research regarding estimation of influenza vaccination prevalence. We have also shared lessons learned about how EHR indicators should be constructed and offer methodologic suggestions for validating them.
This work adds to a rapidly emerging body of literature about how to define, collect and interpret EHR-based surveillance measures and may help guide other jurisdictions.
Electronic health records (EHRs) can potentially extend chronic disease surveillance, but few EHR-based initiatives tracking population-based metrics have been validated for accuracy. We designed a new EHR-based population health surveillance system for New York City (NYC) known as NYC Macroscope. This report is the third in a 3-part series describing the development and validation of that system. The first report describes governance and technical infrastructure underlying the NYC Macroscope. The second report describes validation methods and presents validation results for estimates of obesity, smoking, depression and influenza vaccination. In this third paper we present validation findings for metabolic indicators (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes).
We compared EHR-based estimates to those from a gold standard surveillance source - the 2013-2014 NYC Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NYC HANES) - overall and stratified by sex and age group, using the two one-sided test of equivalence and other validation criteria.
EHR-based hypertension prevalence estimates were highly concordant with NYC HANES estimates. Diabetes prevalence estimates were highly concordant when measuring diagnosed diabetes but less so when incorporating laboratory results. Hypercholesterolemia prevalence estimates were less concordant overall. Measures to assess treatment and control of the 3 metabolic conditions performed poorly.
While indicator performance was variable, findings here confirm that a carefully constructed EHR-based surveillance system can generate prevalence estimates comparable to those from gold-standard examination surveys for certain metabolic conditions such as hypertension and diabetes.
Standardized EHR metrics have potential utility for surveillance at lower annual costs than surveys, especially as representativeness of contributing clinical practices to EHR-based surveillance systems increases.
Bongkrekic acid (BA) has a unique mechanism of toxicity among the mitochondrial toxins: it inhibits adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) rather than the electron transport chain. Bongkrekic acid is produced by the bacterium Burkholderia gladioli pathovar cocovenenans (B. cocovenenans) which has been implicated in outbreaks of food-borne illness involving coconut- and corn-based products in Indonesia and China. Our objective was to summarize what is known about the epidemiology, exposure sources, toxicokinetics, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis and treatment of human BA poisoning.
We searched MEDLINE (1946 to present), EMBASE (1947 to present), SCOPUS, The Indonesia Publication Index ( http://id.portalgaruda.org/ ), ToxNet, book chapters, Google searches, Pro-MED alerts, and references from previously published journal articles. We identified a total of 109 references which were reviewed. Of those, 29 (26 %) had relevant information and were included. Bongkrekic acid is a heat-stable, highly unsaturated tricarboxylic fatty acid with a molecular weight of 486 kDa. Outbreaks have been reported from Indonesia, China, and more recently in Mozambique. Very little is known about the toxicokinetics of BA. Bongkrekic acid produces its toxic effects by inhibiting mitochondrial (ANT). ANT can also alter cellular apoptosis. Signs and symptoms in humans are similar to the clinical findings from other mitochondrial poisons, but they vary in severity and time course. Management of patients is symptomatic and supportive.
Bongkrekic acid is a mitochondrial ANT toxin and is reported primarily in outbreaks of food-borne poisoning involving coconut and corn. It should be considered in outbreaks of food-borne illness when signs and symptoms manifest involving the liver, brain, and kidneys and when coconut- or corn-based foods are implicated.
Previous studies have shown increased precipitation to be associated with higher frequency of traffic collisions. However, data regarding how extreme weather events, projected to grow in frequency, intensity, and duration in response to a changing climate, might affect the risk of motor vehicle collisions is particularly limited. We investigated the association between frequency of extreme heat and precipitation events and risk of motor vehicle collision in Maryland between 2000 and 2012.
Motor vehicle collision data was obtained from the Maryland Automated Accident Reporting System. Each observation in the data set corresponded to a unique collision event. This data was linked to extreme heat and precipitation events that were calculated using location and calendar day specific thresholds. A time-stratified case-crossover analysis was utilized to assess the association between exposure to extreme heat and precipitation events and risk of motor vehicle collision. Additional stratified analyses examined risk by road condition, season, and collisions involving only one vehicle.
Overall, there were over 1.28 million motor vehicle collisions recorded in Maryland between 2000 and 2012, of which 461,009 involved injuries or death. There was a 23% increase in risk of collision for every 1-day increase in extreme precipitation event (Odds Ratios (OR) 1.23, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.22, 1.27). This risk was considerably higher for collisions on roads with a defect or obstruction (OR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.40, 1.52) and those involving a single vehicle (OR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.39, 1.43). Change in risk associated with extreme heat events was marginal at best.
Extreme precipitation events are associated with an increased risk of motor vehicle collisions in Maryland.
It is known that extreme temperature and ambient air pollution are each independently associated with human health outcomes. However, findings from the few studies that have examined modified effects by seasons and the interaction between air pollution and temperature on health endpoints are inconsistent. This study examines the effects of short-term PM2.5 (particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5μm in aerodynamic diameter) on hospitalization for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), its modifications by season and temperature, and whether these effects are heterogeneous across different regions in New York State (NYS). We used daily average temperature and PM2.5 concentrations as exposure indicators and performed a time series analysis with a quasi-Poisson model, controlling for possible confounders, such as time-relevant variables and dew point, for CVDs in NYS, 1991-2006. Stratification parametric models were applied to evaluate the modifying effects by seasons and temperature. Across the whole year, a 10-μg/m3 increment in PM2.5 concentration accounted for a 1.37% increase in CVDs (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.90%, 1.84%) in New York City, Long Island &amp; Hudson. The PM2.5 effect was strongest in winter, with an additional 2.06% (95% CI: 1.33%, 2.80%) increase in CVDs observed per 10-μg/m3 increment in PM2.5. Temperature modified the PM2.5 effects on CVDs, and these modifications by temperature on PM2.5 effects on CVDs were found at low temperature days. These associations were heterogeneous across four PM2.5 concentration regions. PM2.5 was positively associated with CVD hospitalizations. The short-term PM2.5 effect varied with season and temperature levels, and stronger effects were observed in winter and at low temperature days.
The Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP) is a unique community-based medical record data linkage system that provides individual patient address, diagnosis and visit information for all hospitalizations, as well as emergency department, urgent care and outpatient clinic visits for asthma. Proximity to traffic is known to be associated with asthma exacerbations and severity. Our null hypothesis was that there is no association between residential proximity to traffic and asthma exacerbations over eleven years of REP data.
Spatial coordinates of the homes of 19,915 individuals diagnosed with asthma were extracted from the REP database. Three metrics of traffic exposure at residences were calculated from link-based traffic count data. We used exploratory statistics as well as logistic and Poisson regression to examine associations between three traffic metrics at the home address and asthma exacerbations.
Asthma exacerbations increased as traffic levels near the home increased. Proximity to traffic was a significant predictor of asthma exacerbations in logistic and Poisson regressions controlling for age, gender and block group poverty.
Over eleven years in a comprehensive county-wide data set of asthma patients, and after controlling for demographic effects, we found evidence that living in proximity to traffic increased the risk of asthma exacerbations.
The detonation of a radiological dispersion device or other radiological incidents could result in widespread releases of radioactive materials and intakes of radionuclides by affected individuals. Transportable radiation monitoring instruments could be used to measure radiation from gamma-emitting radionuclides in the body for triaging individuals and assigning priorities to their bioassay samples for in vitro assessments. The present study derived sets of calibration factors for four instruments: the Ludlum Model 44-2 gamma scintillator, a survey meter containing a 2.54 × 2.54-cm NaI(Tl) crystal; the Captus 3000 thyroid uptake probe, which contains a 5.08 × 5.08-cm NaI(Tl) crystal; the Transportable Portal Monitor Model TPM-903B, which contains two 3.81 × 7.62 × 182.9-cm polyvinyltoluene plastic scintillators; and a generic instrument, such as an ionization chamber, that measures exposure rates. The calibration factors enable these instruments to be used for assessing inhaled or ingested intakes of any of four radionuclides: Co, I, Cs, and Ir. The derivations used biokinetic models embodied in the DCAL computer software system developed by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Monte Carlo simulations using the MCNPX radiation transport code. The three physical instruments were represented by MCNP models that were developed previously. The affected individuals comprised children of five ages who were represented by the revised Oak Ridge National Laboratory pediatric phantoms, and adult men and adult women represented by the Adult Reference Computational Phantoms described in Publication 110 of the International Commission on Radiological Protection. These calibration factors can be used to calculate intakes; the intakes can be converted to committed doses by the use of tabulated dose coefficients. These calibration factors also constitute input data to the ICAT computer program, an interactive Microsoft Windows-based software package that estimates intakes of radionuclides and cumulative and committed effective doses, based on measurements made with these instruments. This program constitutes a convenient tool for assessing intakes and doses without consulting tabulated calibration factors and dose coefficients.
With climate change, extreme heat (EH) events are increasing, so it is important to understand who is vulnerable to heat-associated morbidity. We determined the association between EH and hospitalizations for all natural causes; cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal diseases; diabetes mellitus; and acute myocardial infarction in Michigan, USA, at different intensities and durations. We assessed confounding by ozone and how individual characteristics and health insurance payer (a proxy for income) modified these associations. We obtained Michigan Inpatient Database, National Climatic Data Center, and US Environmental Protection Agency ozone data for May-September, 2000-2009 for three Michigan counties. We employed a case-crossover design and modeled EH as an indicator for temperature above the 95th, 97th, or 99th percentile thresholds for 1, 2, 3, or 4 days. We examined effect modification by patient age, race, sex, and health insurance payer and pooled the county results. Among non-whites, the pooled odds ratio for hospitalization on EH (97th percentile threshold) vs. non-EH days for renal diseases was 1.37 (95 % CI = 1.13-1.66), which increased with increasing EH intensity, but was null among whites (OR = 1.00, 95 % CI = 0.81, 1.25). We observed a null association between EH and cardiovascular hospitalization. EH (99th percentile threshold) was associated with myocardial infarction hospitalizations. Confounding by ozone was minimal. EH was associated with hospitalizations for renal disease among non-whites. This information on vulnerability to heat-associated morbidity helps characterize the public health burden of EH and target interventions including patient education.
Exposures to environmental pollutants in utero may increase the risk of adverse health effects. We measured the concentrations of 59 potentially harmful chemicals in 77 maternal and 65 paired umbilical cord blood samples collected in San Francisco during 2010-2011, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hydroxylated PBDEs (OH-PBDEs), and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) in serum and metals in whole blood. Consistent with previous studies, we found evidence that concentrations of mercury (Hg) and lower-brominated PBDEs were often higher in umbilical cord blood or serum than in maternal samples (median cord:maternal ratio &gt; 1), while for most PFCs and lead (Pb), concentrations in cord blood or serum were generally equal to or lower than their maternal pair (median cord:maternal ratio ≤ 1). In contrast to the conclusions of a recent review, we found evidence that several PCBs and OCPs were also often higher in cord than maternal serum (median cord:maternal ratio &gt; 1) when concentrations are assessed on a lipid-adjusted basis. Our findings suggest that for many chemicals, fetuses may experience higher exposures than their mothers and highlight the need to characterize potential health risks and inform policies aimed at reducing sources of exposure.
Ciguatera fish poisoning (ciguatera) is a common clinical syndrome in areas where there is dependence on tropical reef fish for food. A subset of patients develops recurrent and, in some instances, chronic symptoms, which may result in substantial disability. To identify possible biomarkers for recurrent/chronic disease, and to explore correlations with immune gene expression, peripheral blood leukocyte gene expression in 10 ciguatera patients (7 recurrent, 3 acute) from the U.S. Virgin Islands, and 5 unexposed Florida controls were evaluated. Significant differences in gene expression were noted when comparing ciguatera patients and controls; however, it was not possible to differentiate between patients with acute and recurrent disease, possibly due to the small sample sizes involved.
Two Category 5 storms, Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria, hit the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) within 13 days of each other in September 2017. These storms caused catastrophic damage across the territory, including widespread loss of power, destruction of homes, and devastation of critical infrastructure. During large scale disasters such as Hurricanes Irma and Maria, public health surveillance is an important tool to track emerging illnesses and injuries, identify at-risk populations, and assess the effectiveness of response efforts. The USVI Department of Health (DoH) partnered with shelter staff volunteers to monitor the health of the sheltered population and help guide response efforts.
Shelter volunteers collect data on the American Red Cross Aggregate Morbidity Report form that tallies the number of client visits at a shelter's health services every 24 hours. Morbidity data were collected at all 5 shelters on St. Thomas and St. Croix between September and October 2017. This article describes the health surveillance data collected in response to Hurricanes Irma and Maria.
Following Hurricanes Irma and Maria, 1130 health-related client visits were reported, accounting for 1655 reasons for the visits (each client may have more than 1 reason for a single visit). Only 1 shelter reported data daily. Over half of visits (51.2%) were for health care management; 17.7% for acute illnesses, which include respiratory conditions, gastrointestinal symptoms, and pain; 14.6% for exacerbation of chronic disease; 9.8% for mental health; and 6.7% for injury. Shelter volunteers treated many clients within the shelters; however, reporting of the disposition (eg, referred to physician, pharmacist) was often missed (78.1%).
Shelter surveillance is an efficient means of quickly identifying and characterizing health issues and concerns in sheltered populations following disasters, allowing for the development of evidence-based strategies to address identified needs. When incorporated into broader surveillance strategies using multiple data sources, shelter data can enable disaster epidemiologists to paint a more comprehensive picture of community health, thereby planning and responding to health issues both within and outside of shelters. The findings from this report illustrated that managing chronic conditions presented a more notable resource demand than acute injuries and illnesses. Although there remains room for improvement because reporting was inconsistent throughout the response, the capacity of shelter staff to address the health needs of shelter residents and the ability to monitor the health needs in the sheltered population were critical resources for the USVI DoH overwhelmed by the disaster. (Disaster Med Public Health Preparedness. 2019;13:38-43).
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collects information on blood lead levels (BLLs) in the United States through the Childhood Blood Lead Surveillance (CBLS) system (&lt;16 years of age) and the Adult Blood Lead Epidemiology and Surveillance (ABLES) program (≥16 years of age). While both of these state-based national programs share the mutual goal of monitoring and reducing lead exposure in the US population, blood lead data for children and adults are maintained in separate data collection systems. This limits the ability to fully describe lead exposure in the US population across these 2 distinct population groups from sources such as take-home and maternal-child lead exposure. In addition, at the state level, having a unified system to collect, maintain, and analyze child and adult blood lead data provides a more efficient use of limited resources. Based on feedback from state partners, CDC is working to integrate CBLS and ABLES data collection systems at the national level. Several states have developed or are developing an integrated child and adult blood lead data collection system. We highlight efforts undertaken in Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Carolina, Iowa, and Oregon to investigate workplace and take-home lead exposure. Integrating blood lead surveillance data at the national level will enhance CDC's ability to monitor sources of lead exposure from both the home and work environments including paint, water, soil, dust, consumer products, and lead-related industries. Together, an integrated child and adult blood lead surveillance system will offer a coordinated, comprehensive, and systematic public health approach to the surveillance and monitoring of reported BLLs across the US population.
The number of pediatric cases of elevated blood lead levels (BLLs) are decreasing in North Carolina. However, one county reported an increase in the number of children with confirmed BLLs ≥5 μg/dL (CDC reference value, https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/acclpp/blood_lead_levels.htm), from 27 in 2013 to 44 in 2017. Many children with elevated BLLs in this county lived in new housing, but samples of spices, herbal remedies, and ceremonial powders from their homes contained high levels of lead. Children with chronic lead exposure might suffer developmental delays and behavioral problems (https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/). In 1978, lead was banned from house paint in the United States (1); however, children might consume spices and herbal remedies daily. To describe the problem of lead in spices, herbal remedies, and ceremonial powders, the North Carolina Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program (NCCLPPP) retrospectively examined properties where spices, herbal remedies, and ceremonial powders were sampled that were investigated during January 2011-January 2018, in response to confirmed elevated BLLs among children. NCCLPPP identified 59 properties (6.0% of all 983 properties where home lead investigations had been conducted) that were investigated in response to elevated BLLs in 61 children. More than one fourth (28.8%) of the spices, herbal remedies, and ceremonial powders sampled from these homes contained ≥1 mg/kg lead. NCCLPPP developed a survey to measure child-specific consumption of these products and record product details for reporting to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Lead contamination of spices, herbal remedies, and ceremonial powders might represent an important route of childhood lead exposure, highlighting the need to increase product safety. Setting a national maximum allowable limit for lead in spices and herbal remedies might further reduce the risk for lead exposure from these substances.
Power outages can impact health, and certain populations may be more at risk. Personal preparedness may reduce impacts, but information on power outage preparedness and risk perception among vulnerable populations is limited. We examined power outage preparedness and concern among New York City residents, including vulnerable populations defined as older adults (≥ 65 years), and respondents with household members who require assistance with daily activities or depend on electric medical devices. A random sample telephone survey was conducted during November-December 2016. Preparedness was defined as having a three-day supply of drinking water, non-perishable food, and a working flashlight. Among all respondents (n = 887), 58% were prepared and 46% expressed concern about health. Respondents with electric-dependent household members (9% of all respondents) tended to have higher preparedness (70 vs. 56% of respondents without electric-dependent household members). Among this group, only 40% reported being registered with a utility company to receive early notification of outages. While the subgroup sample was small, respondents with registered electric-dependent household members had lower preparedness than those with non-registered users (59 vs. 76%). Respondents with household members who needed assistance had comparable levels of preparedness to respondents without someone who needed assistance (59 vs. 57%). Older adults had greater preparedness than younger adults (65 vs. 56%). Health concerns were greater among all vulnerable groups than the general population. Levels of preparedness varied among vulnerable respondents, and awareness of power outage notification programs was low. Our findings highlight the need to increase awareness and preparedness among at-risk people.
More extreme cold weather and larger weather variations have raised concerns regarding their effects on public health. Although prior studies assessed the effects of cold air temperature on health, especially mortality, limited studies evaluated wind chill temperatures on morbidity, and health effects under the current cold warning threshold. This study identified the thresholds, lag periods, and best indicators of extreme cold on cardiovascular disease (CVD) by comparing effects of wind chill temperatures and cold air temperatures on CVD emergency department (ED) visits in winter and winter transition months. Information was collected on 662,625 CVD ED visits from statewide hospital discharge dataset in New York State. Meteorological factors, including air temperature, wind speed, and barometric pressure were collected from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. A case-crossover approach was used to assess the extreme cold-CVD relationship in winter (December-February) and transition months (November and March) after controlling for PM2.5. Conditional logistic regression models were employed to analyze the association between cold weather factors and CVD ED visits. We observed CVD effects occurred when wind chill temperatures were as high as -3.8 °C (25 °F), warmer than current wind chill warning standard (≤-28.8 °C or ≤-20 °F). Wind chill temperature was a more sensitive indicator of CVD ED visits during winter with temperatures ≤ -3.8 °C (25 °F) with delay effect (lag 6); however, air temperature was better during transition months for temperatures ≤ 7.2 °C (45 °F) at earlier lag days (1-3). Among all CVD subtypes, hypertension ED visit had the strongest negative association with both wind chill temperature and air temperature. This study recommends modifying the current cold warning temperature threshold given larger proportions of CVD cases are occurring at considerably higher temperatures than the current criteria. We also recommend issuing cold warnings in winter transitional months.
Few studies have assessed the effect of ambient heat during the fetal development period on congenital heart defects (CHDs), especially in transitional seasons. We examined and compared the associations between extreme heat and CHD phenotypes in summer and spring, assessed their geographical differences, and compared different heat indicators.
We identified 5848 CHD cases and 5742 controls (without major structural defects) from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study, a US multicenter, population-based case-control study. Extreme heat events (EHEs) were defined by using the 95th (EHE95) or 90th (EHE90) percentile of daily maximum temperature and its frequency and duration during postconceptional weeks 3-8. We used a two-stage Bayesian hierarchical model to examine both regional and study-wide associations. Exposure odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using multivariate logistic regression analyses, while controlling for potential confounding factors.
Overall, we observed no significant relationships between maternal EHE exposure and CHDs in most regions during summer. However, we found that 3-11 days of EHE90 during summer and spring was significantly associated with ventricular septal defects (VSDs) study-wide (ORs ranged: 2.17-3.24). EHE95 in spring was significantly associated with conotruncal defects and VSDs in the South (ORs: 1.23-1.78). Most EHE indicators in spring were significantly associated with increased septal defects (both VSDs and atrial septal defects (ASDs)) in the Northeast.
While generally null results were found, long duration of unseasonable heat was associated with the increased risks for VSDs and ASDs, mainly in South and Northeast of the US. Further research to confirm our findings is needed.
Exposure to naturally occurring arsenic in groundwater is a public health concern, particularly for households served by unregulated private wells. At present, one of the greatest barriers to exposure reduction is a lack of private well testing due to difficulties in motivating individual private well owners to take protective actions. Policy and regulations requiring testing could make a significant contribution towards universal screening of private well water and arsenic exposure reduction. New Jersey's Private Well Testing Act (PWTA) requires tests for arsenic during real estate transactions; however, the regulations do not require remedial action when maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) are exceeded. A follow-up survey sent to residents of homes where arsenic was measured above the state MCL in PWTA-required tests reveals a range of mitigation behavior among respondents (n = 486), from taking no action to reduce exposure (28%), to reporting both treatment use and appropriate maintenance and monitoring behavior (15%). Although 86% of respondents recall their well was tested during their real estate transaction, only 60% report their test showed an arsenic problem. Treatment systems are used by 63% of households, although half were installed by a previous owner. Among those treating their water (n = 308), 57% report that maintenance is being performed as recommended, although only 31% have tested the treated water within the past year. Perceived susceptibility and perceived barriers are strong predictors of mitigation action. Among those treating for arsenic, perceived severity is associated with recent monitoring, and level of commitment is associated with proper maintenance. Mention of a treatment service agreement is a strong predictor of appropriate monitoring and maintenance behavior, while treatment installed by a previous owner is less likely to be maintained. Though the PWTA requires that wells be tested, this study finds that not all current well owners are aware the test occurred or understood the implications of their arsenic results. Among those that have treatment installed to remove arsenic, poor monitoring and maintenance behaviors threaten to undermine intentions to reduce exposure. Findings suggest that additional effort, resources, and support to ensure home buyers pay attention to, understand, and act on test results at the time they are performed may help improve management of arsenic water problems over the long term and thus the PWTA's public health impact.
The New York City (NYC) Macroscope is an electronic health record (EHR) surveillance system based on a distributed network of primary care records from the Hub Population Health System. In a previous 3-part series published in eGEMS, we reported the validity of health indicators from the NYC Macroscope; however, questions remained regarding their generalizability to other EHR surveillance systems.
We abstracted primary care chart data from more than 20 EHR software systems for 142 participants of the 2013-14 NYC Health and Nutrition Examination Survey who did not contribute data to the NYC Macroscope. We then computed the sensitivity and specificity for indicators, comparing data abstracted from EHRs with survey data.
Obesity and diabetes indicators had moderate to high sensitivity (0.81-0.96) and high specificity (0.94-0.98). Smoking status and hypertension indicators had moderate sensitivity (0.78-0.90) and moderate to high specificity (0.88-0.98); sensitivity improved when the sample was restricted to records from providers who attested to Stage 1 Meaningful Use. Hyperlipidemia indicators had moderate sensitivity (≥0.72) and low specificity (≤0.59), with minimal changes when restricting to Stage 1 Meaningful Use.
Indicators for obesity and diabetes used in the NYC Macroscope can be adapted to other EHR surveillance systems with minimal validation. However, additional validation of smoking status and hypertension indicators is recommended and further development of hyperlipidemia indicators is needed.
Our findings suggest that many of the EHR-based surveillance indicators developed and validated for the NYC Macroscope are generalizable for use in other EHR surveillance systems.
Outdoor workers face elevated and prolonged heat exposures and have limited access to air-conditioned spaces. This study's overarching research aim is to increase knowledge of municipal worker heat exposure and adaptation practices. The study's sub-objectives are: (1) quantifying exposure misclassification from estimating personal heat exposure from the official weather station; (2) surveying worker's knowledge and practices to adapt to extreme heat; and (3) relating heat exposure and adaptation practices to self-reported thermal comfort.
Participants wore a personal heat exposure sensor over 7 days from June 1st to July 3rd, 2015 in Tallahassee, Florida US. Next, participants confirmed the days that they wore the sensor and reported their daily thermal comfort and heat adaptations. Finally, participants completed an extreme heat knowledge, attitudes, and practices survey.
Some participants (37%) experienced hotter and more humid conditions (heat index &gt; 2) than the weather station. The most common heat adaptations were staying hydrated (85%), wearing a hat (46%), and seeking shade (40%). During work hours, higher temperatures increased the odds (odds ratio: 1.21, 95% confidence interval: 1.03-1.41, p = 0.016) of a participant feeling too hot. Shifting work duty indoors made workers to feel more comfortable (odds ratio: 0.28, 95% confidence interval: 0.11-0.70, p = 0.005).
In hot and humid climates, everyday, heat exposures continuously challenge the health of outdoor workers.
Emerging evidence about the effects of endocrine disruptors on asthma symptoms suggests new opportunities to reduce asthma by changing personal environments. Right-to-know ethics supports returning personal results for these chemicals to participants, so they can make decisions to reduce exposures. Yet researchers and institutional review boards have been reluctant to approve results reports in low-income communities, which are disproportionately affected by asthma. Concerns include limited literacy, lack of resources to reduce exposures, co-occurring stressors, and lack of models for effective reporting. To better understand the ethical and public health implications of returning personal results in low-income communities, we investigated parents' experiences of learning their children's environmental chemical and biomonitoring results in the Green Housing Study of asthma.
The Green Housing Study measured indoor chemical exposures, allergens, and children's asthma symptoms in "green"-renovated public housing and control sites in metro-Boston and Cincinnati in 2011-2013. We developed reports for parents of children in the study, including results for their child and community. We observed community meetings where results were reported, and metro-Boston residents participated in semi-structured interviews in 2015 about their report-back experience. Interviews were systematically coded and analyzed.
Report-back was positively received, contributed to greater understanding, built trust between researchers and participants, and facilitated action to improve health. Sampling visits and community meetings also contributed to creating a positive study experience for participants. Participants were able to make changes in their homes, such as altering product use and habits that may reduce asthma symptoms, though some faced roadblocks from family members. Participants also gained access to medical resources, though some felt that clinicians were not responsive. Participants wanted larger scale change from government or industry and wanted researchers to leverage study results to achieve change.
Report-back on environmental chemical exposures in low-income communities can enhance research benefits by engaging residents with personally relevant information that informs and motivates actions to reduce exposure to asthma triggers. Ethical practices in research should support deliberative report-back in vulnerable communities.
Ciguatera fish poisoning is a seafood-toxin illness resulting from consumption of fish contaminated with ciguatoxins. Managing ciguatera fish poisoning is complex. It is made easier, however, by local fishers from endemic areas reporting regional predictability for local fish species' ciguatera fish poisoning risk, which the present study then tested. We investigated the prevalence of ciguatoxins in 4 commonly marketed and consumed species (Balistes vetula, Haemulon plumierii, Ocyurus chrysurus, and Epinephelus guttatus) across an oceanic gradient (north, south, east, and west) from the US Virgin Islands. Fish muscle extracts were analyzed for Caribbean ciguatoxins using an in vitro mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) cytotoxicity assay and confirmed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Fish collected from the north location had 0 fish with detectable ciguatoxins; this site also had the greatest wave energy. Caribbean ciguatoxins in fish ranged from 0.01 to 0.11, 0.004 to 0.10, and 0.005 to 0.18 ng Caribbean ciguatoxin-1 eq/g, from the west, east, and south respectively. Ciguatoxin-like activity was detectable by the N2a assay in 40, 41, 50, and 70% of H. plumierii, O. chrysurus, B. vetula, and E. guttatus, respectively. Of the fish collected, 4% had Caribbean ciguatoxin levels exceeding the US Food and Drug Administration guidance of 0.1 ng Caribbean ciguatoxin-1 eq/g fish. These findings concurred with spatial ciguatera fish poisoning prevalence information provided by local fishers in the US Virgin Islands and demonstrate how partnerships between researchers and fishers can aid the improvement of science-based ciguatera fish poisoning management.

Climate change is expected to result in more heat-related, but potentially fewer cold-related, emergency department visits and deaths. The net effect of projected changes in temperature on morbidity and mortality remains incompletely understood. We estimated the change in temperature-related morbidity and mortality at two sites in southern New England, United States, through the end of the 21st century.
We used distributed lag Poisson regression models to estimate the present-day associations between daily mean temperature and all-cause emergency department visits and deaths in Rhode Island and in Boston, Massachusetts. We estimated the change in temperature-related visits and deaths in 2045-2054 and 2085-2094 (relative to 2001-2010) under two greenhouse gas emissions scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) using downscaled projections from an ensemble of over 40 climate models, assuming all other factors remain constant.
We observed U-shaped relationships between temperature and morbidity and mortality in Rhode Island, with minima at 10.9°C and 22.5°C, respectively. We estimated that, if this population were exposed to the future temperatures projected under RCP8.5 for 2085-2094, there would be 5,976 (95% eCI = 1,630, 11,379) more emergency department visits but 218 (95% eCI = -551, 43) fewer deaths annually. Results were similar in Boston and similar but less pronounced in the 2050s and under RCP4.5.
We estimated that in the absence of further adaptation, if the current southern New England population were exposed to the higher temperatures projected for future decades, temperature-related emergency department visits would increase but temperature-related deaths would not.
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are synthetic chemicals used in manufacturing that resist environmental degradation, can leach into drinking water, and bioaccumulate in tissues. Some studies have shown associations with negative health outcomes. In May 2014, a New Hampshire public drinking water supply was found to be contaminated with PFAS from a former U.S. Air Force base.
We established a serum testing program to assess PFAS exposure in the affected community.
Serum samples and demographic and exposure information were collected from consenting eligible participants. Samples were tested for PFAS at three analytical laboratories. Geometric means and 95% confidence intervals were calculated and analyzed by age and exposure variables.
A total of 1578 individuals provided samples for PFAS testing; &gt;94% were found to have perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) detectable in serum. Geometric mean serum concentrations of PFOS, PFOA, and PFHxS were 8.6 μg/L (95% CI:8.3-8.9), 3.1 μg/L (95% CI: 3.0-3.2), and 4.1 μg/L (95% CI: 3.9-4.3), respectively, which were statistically higher than the general U.S.
Significant associations were observed between PFAS serum concentrations and age, time spent in the affected community, childcare attendance, and water consumption.
PFOS, PFOA, and PFHxS were found in significantly higher levels in the affected population, consistent with PFAS drinking water contamination. Given increased recognition of PFAS contamination in the U.S, a coordinated national response is needed to improve access to biomonitoring and understand health impacts.
Mallinckrodt Chemical Works was the earliest uranium processing facility in the Manhattan Project, beginning in 1942. Even then, concern existed about possible health effects resulting from exposure to radiation and pitchblende dust. This concern was well founded as the facility processed Belgian Congo pitchblende ore that was up to 60% pure uranium with high U content and up to 100 mg of radium per ton. Workers were exposed to external gamma radiation plus internal radiation from inhalation and ingestion of pitchblende dust (uranium, radium, and silica). Multiple sources of exposure were available for organ dose reconstruction to a degree unique for an epidemiologic study. Personal film badge measures available from 1945 captured external exposures. Additional external exposure included 15,518 occupational medical x-rays and 210 radiation exposure records from other facilities outside of Mallinckrodt employment. Organ dose calculations considered organ-specific coefficients that account for photon energy and job-specific orientation of workers to the radiation source during processing. Intakes of uranium and radium were based on 39,451 uranium urine bioassays and 2,341 breath radon measurements, and International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) Publication 68 biokinetic models were used to estimate organ-specific radiation absorbed dose. Estimates of exposure to airborne radon and its short-lived progeny were based on radon measurements in work areas where radium-containing materials were handled or stored, together with estimated exposure times in these areas based on job titles. Dose estimates for radon and its short-lived progeny were based on models and methods recently recommended in ICRP Publication 137. This comprehensive dosimetric approach follows methods outlined by the National Council on Radiation Protection Scientific Committee 6-9 for the Million Worker Study. Annual doses were calculated for six organs: lung, brain, heart, kidney, colon and red bone marrow. Evaluation and adjustment for individual cumulative measures of pitchblende dust inhalation were made for lung and kidney diseases.
The purpose of this paper is to present an overview of ongoing work on the Million Worker Study (MWS), highlighting some of the key methods and progress so far as exemplified by the study of workers at the Mallinckrodt Chemical Works (MCW). The MWS began nearly 25 y ago and continues in a stepwise fashion, evaluating one study cohort at a time. It includes workers from U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Manhattan Project facilities, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulated nuclear power plants, industrial radiographers, U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) nuclear weapons test participants, and physicians and technologists working with medical radiation. The purpose is to fill the major gap in radiation protection and science: What is the risk when exposure is received gradually over time rather than briefly as for the atomic bomb survivors? Studies published or planned in 2018 include leukemia (and dosimetry) among atomic veterans, leukemia among nuclear power plant workers, mortality among workers at the MCW, and a comprehensive National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) Report on dosimetry for the MWS. MCW has a singular place in history: the 40 tons (T) of uranium oxide produced at MCW were used by Enrico Fermi on 2 December 1942 to produce the first manmade sustained and controlled nuclear reaction, and the atomic age was born. Seventy-six years later, the authors followed the over 2,500 MCW workers for mortality and reconstructed dose from six sources of exposure: external gamma rays from the radioactive elements in pitchblende; medical x rays from occupationally required chest examinations; intakes of pitchblende (uranium, radium, and silica) measured by urine samples; radon breath analyses and dust surveys overseen by Robley Evans and Merril Eisenbud; occupational exposures received before and after employment at MCW; and cumulative radon concentrations and lung dose from the decay of radium in the work environment. The unique exposure reconstructions allow for multiple evaluations, including estimates of silica dust. The study results are relevant today. For example, NASA is interested that radium, deposited in the brain, releases high-LET alpha particles - the only human analogue, though limited, for high energy, high-Z particles (galactic cosmic rays) traveling through space that might affect astronauts on Mars missions. Don't discount the past; it's the prologue to the future!
Life expectancy at birth (LE) has been calculated for states and counties. LE estimates at these levels mask health disparities in local communities. There are no nationwide estimates at the sub-county level. We present a stepwise approach for calculating LE using census tracts in New York state to identify health disparities.
Our study included 2751 census tracts in New York state, but excluded New York City. We used population data from the 2010 United States Census and 2008-2010 mortality data from the state health department. Tracts were assigned to 99.97% of the deaths. We removed tracts which had a majority of people living in group quarters. Deaths in these tracts are often recorded elsewhere. Of the remaining 2679 tracts, 6.6% of the tracts had standard errors ≥ 2 years. A geographic aggregation tool was used to aggregate tracts with fewer than 60 deaths, and then aggregate areas that had standard errors of ≥ 2 years.
Aggregation resulted in a 9.9% reduction in the number of areas. Tracts with &lt; 2% of population living below the poverty level had a LE of 82.8 years, while tracts with a poverty level ≥ 25% had a LE of 75.5. We observed differences in LE in border areas, of up to 10.4 years, when excluding or including deaths of study area residents that occurred outside the study area. The range and standard deviation at the county level (77.5-82.8, SD = 1.2 years) were smaller than our final sub-county areas (64.7-92.0, SD = 3.3 years). The correlation between LE and poverty were similar and statistically significant (p &lt; 0.0001) at the county (r = - 0.58) and sub-county level (r = - 0.58). The correlations between LE and percent African-American at the county level were (r = 0.11, p = 0.43) and at the sub-county level (r = - 0.25, p &lt; 0.0001).
The proposed approach for geocoding and aggregation of mortality and population data provides a solution for health departments to produce stable empirically-derived LE estimates using data coded to the tract. Reliable estimates within sub-county areas are needed to aid public health officials in focusing preventive health programs in areas where health disparities would be masked by county level estimates.
In this study, we examined associations between serum concentrations of 35 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners, pesticides, and indicators of thyroid function in participants of the Anniston Community Health Survey (ACHS). Study subjects lived in the vicinity of a former PCB production facility and had PCB concentrations 2 to 3 times higher than similar age and race groups from the general population. We investigated associations among serum levels of thyroid hormones (thyroxin [T4], free thyroxin [fT4], triiodothyronine [T3], thyroid stimulation hormone [TSH]) and auto-antibodies (thyroglobulin antibody [TgAb] or thyroperoxidase antibody [TPOAb]) and combined indicators of thyroid function with the sum of PCBs, varying PCB groups, individual PCB congeners, and 8 pesticides. Logistic and linear regression models were adjusted for log10 transformed total lipids, age, sex, ethnicity, BMI, smoking, and family history of thyroid disease. We also performed analyses stratified by ethnicity and sex. Linear regression showed inverse associations between TT3 and thyroid-like PCBs (sum of PCBs 28, 52, 74, 101, 105, and 118; p = .0004), two pesticides (hexachlorobenzene, and pp'-DDE), and individual congeners (PCBs 74, 105). Null associations were observed between PCBs, pesticides, TSH, TT4, and fT4. Logistic regression analyses did not provide support for TT3 findings and found no association with other thyroid hormones, antibodies, or combined indicator of thyroid function. These results suggest there is little evidence that these chemicals have any major clinical effect on thyroid function in this highly PCB exposed population.
This study examined whether gardening modifies the association between age and body mass index (BMI). We used data from the Neighborhood Environments and Health Survey, which was conducted in Denver (N = 469) between 2006 and 2007. We fit two general linear mixed models. The base model had BMI in kg/m2 as the outcome, and age, an indicator variable for non-gardening status and the age-by-non-gardening status interaction as predictors. The adjusted model included as covariates the potential confounders of education, ethnicity and self-reported health. We assessed self-selection bias and confounding. BMI was 27.18 kg/m2 for non-gardeners, 25.62 kg/m2 for home gardeners, and 24.17 kg/m2 for community gardeners. In the base model, a statistically significant association was observed between age and BMI for non-gardeners but not for the combined community and home gardening group (F = 9.27, ndf = 1, ddf = 441, p = 0.0025). In the adjusted model, the association between age and BMI in non-gardeners was not statistically significant (F = 1.72, ndf = 1, ddf = 431, p = 0.1908). Gardeners differed on social and demographic factors when compared to non-gardeners. The results from the base model are consistent with the hypothesis that gardening might offset age-related weight gain. However, the cross-sectional design does not permit differentiation of true causal effects from the possible effects of bias and confounding. As a follow-up study, to remove bias and confounding, we are conducting a randomized clinical trial of community gardening in Denver.
Since 2002, the national Environmental Health Tracking Program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has provided vital support to state environmental public health efforts while simultaneously building a nationwide network of state, local, and academic partners to improve our nation’s capacity to understand and respond to environmental threats to public health. As part of program review and strategic planning, national thought leaders in environmental public health were convened to assess progress, identify gaps and challenges, and provide recommendations for enhancing the utility and impact of the Tracking Program. Several opportunities were identified. Chief among these was the need for continued and expanded CDC leadership to develop a coordinated Tracking Program agenda identifying specific scientific goals, data needs, and initiatives. Recommendations for future growth included expanded data availability and program coverage: i.e., making data available at the community scale and establishing tracking programs in all 50 states. Finally, a set of recommendations emphasizing communication to decision makers and the public was made that will be integral to the future utility and success of the Tracking Program.
Waterborne outbreaks of salmonellosis are uncommon. The Tennessee Department of Health investigated a salmonellosis outbreak of 10 cases with the only common risk factor being exposure to a single splash pad. Risks included water splashed in the face at the splash pad and no free residual chlorine in the water system. We surveyed water quality and patron behaviors at splash pads statewide. Of the 29 splash pads participating in the water quality survey, 24 (83%) used a recirculating water system. Of the 24, 5 (21%) water samples were tested by polymerase chain reaction and found to be positive for E. coli, Giardia, norovirus, or Salmonella. Among 95 patrons observed, we identified common high-risk behaviors of sitting on the fountain or spray head and putting mouth to water. Water venue regulations and improved education of patrons are important to aid prevention efforts.
Cosmetologists face a variety of occupational health and safety challenges. To gather information on respiratory issues related to work as a cosmetologist, licensed cosmetologists were invited by e-mail to participate in a short online survey. The survey collected demographic data, work history, respiratory symptoms, product usage, and health and safety training. Results revealed that while 57% of cosmetologists reported having received training on customer or consumer safety, only 10.5% had received training on worker health such as work-related asthma and/or breathing issues. Respiratory symptoms were reported by 46% of respondents. Length of employment and the use of glues or adhesives were associated with a diagnosis of asthma.
As part of our continuing effort to highlight innovative approaches to improving the health and environment of communities, the Journal is pleased to publish a bimonthly column from the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). ATSDR is a federal public health agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and shares a common office of the Director with the National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ATSDR serves the public by using the best science, taking responsive public health actions, and providing trusted health information to prevent harmful exposures and diseases related to toxic substances. The purpose of this column is to inform readers of ATSDR's activities and initiatives to better understand the relationship between exposure to hazardous substances in the environment and their impact on human health and how to protect public health. We believe that the column will provide a valuable resource to our readership by helping to make known the considerable resources and expertise that ATSDR has available to assist communities, states, and others to assure good environmental health practice for all is served. The conclusions of this column are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily represent the views of ATSDR, CDC, or HHS.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is an aging-associated neurodegenerative disease affecting millions worldwide. Misfolding, oligomerization and accumulation of the human α-synuclein protein is a key pathological hallmark of PD and is associated with the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons over the course of aging. Lifespan extension via the suppression of IGF-1/insulin-like signaling (IIS) offers a possibility to retard disease onset through induction of metabolic changes that provide neuroprotection. The nceh-1 gene of Caenorhabditis elegans encodes an ortholog of neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase 1 (NCEH-1), an IIS downstream protein that was identified in a screen as a modulator of α-synuclein accumulation in vivo. The mechanism whereby cholesterol metabolism functionally impacts neurodegeneration induced by α-synuclein is undefined. Here we report that NCEH-1 protects dopaminergic neurons from α-synuclein-dependent neurotoxicity in C. elegans via a mechanism that is independent of lifespan extension. We discovered that the presence of cholesterol, LDLR-mediated cholesterol endocytosis, and cholesterol efflux are all essential to NCEH-1-mediated neuroprotection. In protecting from α-synuclein neurotoxicity, NCEH-1 also stimulates cholesterol-derived neurosteroid formation and lowers cellular reactive oxygen species in mitochondria. Collectively, this study augments our understanding of how cholesterol metabolism can modulate a neuroprotective mechanism that attenuates α-synuclein neurotoxicity, thereby pointing toward regulation of neuronal cholesterol turnover as a potential therapeutic avenue for PD.
The Epidemic Intelligence Service officers (EISOs) at the National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH)/Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) respond to public health outbreaks, assist public health surveillance, and recommend public health actions. We summarize the breadth of work done by EISOs assigned to NCEH/ATSDR during 2006-2015. We used the Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed databases to identify articles authored by the EISOs, number and types of epidemiologic assistance field investigations (Epi-Aids), and interviewed NCEH/ATSDR programs with EISO assignees. The largest number of NCEH/ATSDR EISO publications (n = 61) and Epi-Aids (n = 110) related to toxic chemicals (23 and 37, respectively), followed by natural disasters and those caused by humans (19 and 25, respectively), extreme temperature-related illness (9), and chronic diseases (8). The investigations raised awareness, identified risk factors and public health needs, and introduced better prevention and protection measures for human health. Through field investigations and other technical assistance, NCEH/ATSDR provided leadership and staff scientists to assist in the field, as well as knowledge transfer to local, state, territorial, and international health departments.
Liver X receptor (LXR) plays an important role in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), and activation of LXR could reduce atherosclerosis. In the present study we used a cell-based screening method to identify new potential LXRβ agonists. A novel benzofuran-2-carboxylate derivative was identified with LXRβ agonist activity: E17110 showed a significant activation effect on LXRβ with an EC50 value of 0.72 μmol/L. E17110 also increased the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and G1 (ABCG1) in RAW264.7 macrophages. Moreover, E17110 significantly reduced cellular lipid accumulation and promoted cholesterol efflux in RAW264.7 macrophages. Interestingly, we found that the key amino acids in the LXRβ ligand-binding domain had distinct interactions with E17110 as compared to TO901317. These results suggest that E17110 was identified as a novel compound with LXRβ agonist activity in vitro via screening, and could be developed as a potential anti-atherosclerotic lead compound. 
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are key regulators of macrophage lipid metabolism. We compared the effects of three PPAR activators (bezafibrate, fenofibrate, and troglitazone) on the mRNA levels of genes involved in lipid metabolism in primary human macrophages and macrophage-derived foam cells. Treatment of human macrophages for 24 hours with 100 micro mol/L bezafibrate, a nonselective drug that activates the 3 PPAR subtypes (PPARalpha, PPARbeta/delta, and PPARgamma), caused an 87% (P &lt;.01) and a 230% rise in CD36 and adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (aP2) mRNA levels, respectively, whereas the expressions of PPARgamma, PPARalpha, acyl-CoA oxidase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-I), adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1), neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase, and lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) were not modified. However, treatment with selective PPARalpha (fenofibrate at 100 micro mol/L) and PPARgamma (troglitazone at 5 micro mol/L) activators had different effects. Fenofibrate increased PPARalpha (62%, P &lt;.05) and LOX-1 (180%, P &lt;.05) mRNA levels; and troglitazone upregulated CPT-I expression (75%, P &lt;.05). When the effects of these drugs were assessed in macrophage-derived foam cells, we found that troglitazone caused a 134% (P &lt;.05) and a 66% (P &lt;.01) rise in ABCA1 and CPT-I mRNA levels, respectively, whereas the 3 drugs significantly increased aP2 transcripts (about 100% induction). Given that troglitazone treatment resulted in the upregulation of genes involved in the mitochondrial beta-oxidation of fatty acids (CPT-I) and in the reverse-cholesterol-transport pathway (ABCA1), we subsequently determined whether these changes affected intracellular cholesterol ester accumulation. In macrophage-derived foam cells a significant reduction (32%, P &lt;.01) was observed in intracellular cholesterol accumulation after troglitazone, but not after bezafibrate or fenofibrate treatment. Since CPT-I inhibition promotes cholesterol incorporation into cholesteryl esters in macrophages, study is now needed on whether CPT-I induction by troglitazone may reduce the availability of fatty acids for synthesizing cholesterol esters, leading to less foam cell formation.
To address the role of cell membrane neutral sphingomyelinase (EC 3.1.4.12; SMase) in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism in the liver parenchymal cell, we examined the effect of exogenous neutral SMase on the metabolism of cholesteryl esters and the secretion of VLDL and biliary lipids in isolated rat hepatocytes. We show that treatment of hepatocytes with SMase (20 mU/mL) resulted in the intracellular buildup of cholesteryl esters, increased ACAT (EC 2.3.1.26) activity without affecting the ACAT2 mRNA level, and increased cytosolic and microsomal cholesteryl ester hydrolase (EC 3.1.1.13) activity. This was accompanied by increases in the secretion of biliary bile acid, phospholipid, and cholesterol and in increased cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.17) activity and levels of mRNA, as well as decreased levels of apoB mRNA and a decreased secretion of VLDL apoB (apoB-48, approximately 45%; apoB-100, approximately 32%) and lipids (approximately 55%). Moreover, the VLDL particles secreted had an abnormal size and lipid composition; they were larger than controls, were relatively enriched in cholesteryl ester, and depleted in TG and cholesterol. Cell-permeable ceramides did not replicate any of the reported effects. These findings demonstrate that the increased cholesteryl ester turnover, oversecretion of biliary cholesterol and bile acids, and undersecretion of VLDL cholesterol and particles are concerted responses of the primary hepatocytes to exogenous neutral SMase brought about by regulation at several levels. We suggest that plasma membrane neutral SMase may have a specific, ceramide-independent effect in the regulation of cholesterol output pathways in hepatocytes.
The identity of the enzymes responsible for lipase and cholesterol esterase activities in the small intestinal mucosa is not known. Because hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) catalyzes the hydrolysis of acylglycerols and cholesteryl esters, we sought to determine whether HSL could be involved. HSL mRNA and protein were detected in all segments of the small intestine by Northern and Western blot analyses, respectively. Immunocytochemistry experiments revealed that HSL was expressed in the differentiated enterocytes of the villi and was absent in the undifferentiated cells of the crypt. Diacylglycerol lipase and cholesterol esterase activities were found in the different segments. Analysis of gut from HSL-null mice showed that diacylglycerol lipase activity was unchanged in the duodenum and reduced in jejunum. Neutral cholesterol esterase activity was totally abolished in duodenum, jejunum, and ileum of HSL-null mice. Analysis of HSL mRNA structure showed two types of transcripts expressed in equal amounts with alternative 5'-ends transcribed from two exons. This work demonstrates that HSL is expressed in the mucosa of the small intestine. The results also reveal that the enzyme participates in acylglycerol hydrolysis in jejunal enterocytes and cholesteryl ester hydrolysis throughout the small intestine.
Studies were designed to test whether tyrosylation of high-density lipoprotein (HDL(T)) modifies its metabolic features. HDL(T) was less effective than native HDL in promoting cholesterol efflux from J774-AI macrophages. Cell association with fluorescent HDL(T)-apolipoprotein and the uptake of HDL(T)-[(3)H]cholesteryl hexadecyl ether were enhanced by 50% in comparison with native HDL. In addition, neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase (nCEH) activity in J774-AI, which controls the hydrolysis of cholesteryl ester stores to provide free cholesterol for cellular release, declined in the presence of HDL(T). In vitro displacement experiments revealed the ability of HDL(T) to compete with oxidized and acetylated LDL, known as ligands of scavenger receptor (SR) class B type I/II. Similarly, treatment with a blocking antibody to SR-BI/II reduced the cell association of HDL(T) and native HDL by 50%. The addition of polyinosinic acid, an inhibitor of SR class A, reduced the cell association of HDL(T) without affecting that of native HDL. These findings provide evidence that HDL(T) can compete with modified LDL, bind SR-BI/BII and internalize cholesterol ester. Furthermore, the impaired capacity of HDL(T) in promoting cholesterol efflux from J774-AI was accompanied by diminished nCEH and enhanced recognition by SR-AI/II, which appears to involve the transport of cholesterol into cells.
Cholesterol ester (CE)-laden foam cells are a hallmark of atherosclerosis. To determine whether stimulation of the hydrolysis of cytosolic CE can be used as a novel therapeutic modality of atherosclerosis, we overexpressed hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) in THP-1 macrophage-like cells by adenovirus-mediated gene delivery, and we examined its effects on the cellular cholesterol trafficking. We show here that the overexpression of HSL robustly increased neutral CE hydrolase activity and completely eliminated CE in the cells that had been preloaded with CE by incubation with acetylated low density lipoprotein. In these cells, cholesterol efflux was stimulated in the absence or presence of high density lipoproteins, which might be at least partially explained by the increase in the expression of ABCA1. Importantly, these effects were achieved without the addition of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitor, cAMP, or even high density lipoproteins. Furthermore, the uptake and degradation of acetylated low density lipoprotein was significantly reduced probably by decreased expression of scavenger receptor A and CD36. Notably, the cells with stimulated CE hydrolysis did not exhibit either buildup of free cholesterol or cytotoxicity. In conclusion, increased hydrolysis of CE by the overexpression of HSL leads to complete elimination of CE from THP-1 foam cells not only by increasing efflux but also by decreasing influx of cholesterol.
The oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) has been implicated as a pro-atherogenic process in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Macrophages rapidly take up oxidized LDL via scavenger-receptor-mediated pathways and thereby develop into lipid-laden foam cells. The uptake mechanism has been studied extensively and several types of scavenger receptors have been identified. In contrast, the intracellular fate of oxidized LDL lipids is less well investigated. We studied the degradation of specifically oxidized cholesteryl esters by murine macrophages using an HPLC-based assay, and found that oxidized substrates are hydrolysed preferentially from a 1:1 molar mixture of oxidized and non-oxidized cholesteryl esters. This effect was observed at both neutral and acidic pH. Similar results were obtained with lysates of human monocytes and with pure recombinant human hormone-sensitive lipase. These data suggest that the intracellular oxidation of cholesteryl esters may facilitate intracellular cholesteryl ester hydrolysis, and thus may represent an anti-atherogenic process.
The identity of the neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase (CEH) in human monocyte/macrophages is uncertain. Prior studies indicate that hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) is a major CEH in mouse macrophages, and that HSL mRNA is present in human THP-1 monocytes. In the present study, HSL mRNA expression was examined in THP-1 cells as a function of differentiation status and cholesterol enrichment. By RT-PCR with primer pairs that span exon boundaries, HSL mRNA was demonstrated in THP-1 monocytes and phorbol-ester differentiated THP-1 macrophages. cDNA identities were confirmed by sequencing. By Northern blotting, with HSL cDNA as probe, THP-1 monocytes were found to contain HSL mRNA of approximately 3 and 3.9 kb. In THP-1 macrophages, the 3 kb mRNA was greatly diminished, while the level of the 3.9 kb mRNA was maintained. mRNA of approximately 3 and 3.9 kb are those expected of the 86-kDa (adipocyte) and 117-kDa (testicular) HSL isoforms, respectively. The presence of the testicular isoform mRNA was confirmed in THP-1 cells by amplification and sequencing of an isoform-specific cDNA. Additionally, Northern-blot comparisons showed that the 3 and 3.9 kb mRNA in THP-1 comigrated with the HSL mRNA in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and rat testis, respectively. The level of the 3.9 kb mRNA did not vary greatly with cholesterol enrichment. Thus, the HSL gene is transcribed in THP-1 cells both before and after differentiation into macrophages; after differentiation, the predominant mRNA is that for the 117-kDa isoform. This isoform is a CEH, and may mediate some CE turnover in THP-1 cells.
Because the enzymic regulation of muscle triglyceride breakdown is poorly understood we studied whether neutral lipase in skeletal muscle is activated by contractions. Incubated soleus muscles from 70 g rats were electrically stimulated for 60 min. Neutral lipase activity against triacylglycerol increased after 1 and 5 min of contractions [0.36 +/- 0.02 (basal) versus 0.49 +/- 0.05 (1 min) and 0.54 +/- 0.05 (5 min) m-unit.mg of protein(-1), means +/- S.E.M., P &lt; 0.05]. After 10 min the neutral lipase activity (0.40 +/- 0.05 m-unit.mg of protein(-1)) had decreased to basal values (P &gt; 0.05). The contraction-mediated increase in lipase activity was increased by approximately 110% when muscle was stimulated in the presence of okadaic acid. Conversely, treatment of muscle homogenate with alkaline phosphatase completely reversed the contraction-mediated lipase activation. Lipase activity did not change during contractions when analysed in the presence of anti-hormone-sensitive-lipase (HSL) antibody [0.17 +/- 0.02 (basal) versus 0.21 +/- 0.02 (5 min) m-unit.mg of protein(-1), P &gt; 0.05]. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation with affinity-purified anti-HSL antibody reduced muscle-HSL protein concentration by 81+/-4% and caused similar reductions in lipase activity against triacylglycerol and in the contraction-induced increase in this activity. Neither prior sympathectomy [0.33+/- 0.02 (basal) versus 0.53 +/- 0.06 (5 min) m-unit.mg of protein(-1), P &lt; 0.05] nor propranolol impaired the lipase response to contractions. Glycogen phosphorylase activity in the absence of AMP increased after 1 min [27.3 +/- 3.1 versus 8.9 +/- 1.8% (activity without AMP/total activity with AMP), P &lt; 0.05] and returned to basal levels after 5 min. In conclusion, skeletal-muscle-immunoreactive HSL is transiently stimulated by contractions and the mechanism probably involves phosphorylation. The time course of HSL activation is similar to that of glycogen phosphorylase. Apparently, the two enzymes are regulated in parallel by contraction-induced as well as hormonal mechanisms, allowing simultaneous recruitment of all major extra- and intra-muscular energy stores.
The effects of exogenous oxidative stress due to passive smoking on cholesteryl ester (CE)-metabolizing enzymes and their regulatory kinases were examined by exposing rats to cigarette smoke (CS) for a 1-h period twice a day for 8, 12, or 20 wk. An oxidatively modified low density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) with a high lipid peroxide was identified in three CS groups after all three exposure periods. The rat aortic acid and neutral CE hydrolases (ACEH and NCEH) were activated to similar extents by both cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) in the presence of their respective cofactors. The aortic PKC activity in the three CS groups exhibited significant reductions of 72, 84, and 75% as compared with the respective controls, which coincided with the reductions in the ACEH activities (86, 71, and 80%, respectively), whereas the PKA activities increased to 121, 197, and 252% in the three CS groups, respectively. Reflecting the increase of the PKA activity, the NCEH activity exhibited increases of 112% at 8 wk and 140% until 12 wk of exposure and decreased by 50% of the control value at 20 wk of exposure, suggesting inactivation of NCEH itself. The activation of acyl-CoA:cholesterol O-acyltransferase activity was associated with an increase of free cholesterol in aorta. The vitamin E diet prevented the formation of Ox-LDL and the oxidative inactivation of most enzymes, especially PKC, until 12 wk, but was less effective by 20 wk. The oxidative inactivation of PKC, particularly its activated form that translocated to the membrane fraction, was confirmed in the in vitro exposure to active oxygen generators at an optimal concentration; this inactivation was prevented by catalase and superoxide dismutase. These results suggested that the formation of Ox-LDL and alterations in CE-metabolizing enzymes caused by passive smoking could contribute to a twofold increase in the aortic CE content, thereby contributing to one of the mechanisms for atherosclerosis associated with smoking.
We confirmed accumulation of glycogen and lipids, particularly cholesterol esters, in the liver of a patient with cholesterol ester storage disease (CESD). Hepatic cholesterol ester concentration was 100-200 times that found in normal livers. Analysis of the fatty acid composition indicated a higher proportion (41%) of cholesterol linoleate (C18-2), a slightly lower proportion (33%) of cholesterol oleate (C18-1) and normal proportions (14%) of cholesterol palmitate (C16-0) in the CESD patient compared with the control. This fatty acid composition of cholesterol esters and the fatty acid composition of other classes of lipids in the patient's liver resembled that of LDL. We also found that acid cholesterol ester hydrolase activity in the CESD liver was reduced to 5% of that in the control liver, while neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase activity remained at the control level. These results suggest that accumulated cholesterol esters were derived mainly from serum LDL and that the accumulation resulted from lack of acid cholesterol ester hydrolase.
Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is known to mediate the hydrolysis not only of triacylglycerol stored in adipose tissue but also of cholesterol esters in the adrenals, ovaries, testes, and macrophages. To elucidate its precise role in the development of obesity and steroidogenesis, we generated HSL knockout mice by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Mice homozygous for the mutant HSL allele (HSL-/-) were superficially normal except that the males were sterile because of oligospermia. HSL-/- mice did not have hypogonadism or adrenal insufficiency. Instead, the testes completely lacked neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase (NCEH) activities and contained increased amounts of cholesterol ester. Many epithelial cells in the seminiferous tubules were vacuolated. NCEH activities were completely absent from both brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT) in HSL-/- mice. Consistently, adipocytes were significantly enlarged in the BAT (5-fold) and, to a lesser extent in the WAT (2-fold), supporting the concept that the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol was, at least in part, impaired in HSL-/- mice. The BAT mass was increased by 1.65-fold, but the WAT mass remained unchanged. Discrepancy of the size differences between cell and tissue suggests the heterogeneity of adipocytes. Despite these morphological changes, HSL-/- mice were neither obese nor cold sensitive. Furthermore, WAT from HSL-/- mice retained 40% of triacylglycerol lipase activities compared with the wild-type WAT. In conclusion, HSL is required for spermatogenesis but is not the only enzyme that mediates the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol stored in adipocytes.
The Th1-derived cytokine gamma interferon, IFN-gamma, is present within the microenvironment of an atheromatous lesion and likely contributes to lesion progression through macrophage activation. While the inflammatory effects of IFN-gamma are well known, the role of this cytokine in cholesterol metabolism in macrophage derived foam cells is unclear. In the present study, the incubation of foam cells with IFN-gamma resulted in the reduction of HDL(3)-mediated cholesterol efflux. The decrease in cholesterol efflux was not observed with other macrophage-activating factors as colony-stimulating factors failed to demonstrate a similar effect. The reduction in cholesterol efflux was independent of apoE synthesis or SR-BI expression and was associated with a redistribution of intracellular cholesterol with an increase in cholesteryl ester accumulation. The increase in the esterified pool, primarily in cholesterol eicosapentadenoate, docosapentaenoate, arachidonate, and linoleate was associated with a 2-fold increase in acyl-CoA:cholesterol-O-acyltransferase, ACAT, activity and message without any change in neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity. While CD36 message was reduced in IFN-gamma-treated foam cells, the ability to reverse the decrease in efflux by the ACAT inhibitor A58035 in a dose-dependent manner suggests that the IFN-gamma effect on efflux is primarily through the modulation of ACAT expression. Therefore, in addition to its inflammatory effects, IFN-gamma can contribute to the progression of an atherosclerotic lesion by altering the pathway of intracellular cholesterol trafficking in macrophage derived foam cells.
Expression of the rat liver neutral cytosolic cholesteryl ester hydrolase (CEH) gene is regulated by glucocorticoids, thyroxine, and agents that perturb cholesterol metabolism. The present studies identify the putative hormone response elements in the CEH promoter. They also define the roles of two previously identified sterol regulatory elements (SRE-92 and SRE-160) and a putative nuclear factor-Y (NF-Y) binding site with a consensus ATTGG (inverted CCAAT) motif (Natarajan, R., S. Ghosh, and W. M. Grogan. 1998. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 243: 349;-355). CEH promoter-reporter gene constructs were transiently transfected into HepG2 cells to evaluate promoter activity. Results indicated that the CEH gene has two complex glucocorticoid response units in distal portions of the promoter corresponding to consensus glucocorticoid regulatory sequences as well as putative thyroid hormone response elements. CEH promoter-reporter constructs with the proximal 189 bp of the wild-type or mutated sequences were also transfected into HepG2 cells. Activity of the wild-type construct increased when incubated in sterol depleted media or when co-expressed with a mature sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP-2). These responses were suppressed by mutations in SRE-92, SRE-160, or NF-Y, indicating that these cis elements are sufficient for sterol-mediated regulation of the CEH promoter. Gel mobility shift assays further demonstrated that NF-Y binds to the inverted CCAAT box motif and is required for the sterol-mediated regulation. These results indicate that multiple cis-elements regulate transcription of the cholesteryl ester hydrolase (CEH) gene, consistent with the reported regulation of CEH expression.-Natarajan, R., S. Ghosh, and W. M. Grogan. Regulation of the rat neutral cytosolic cholesteryl ester hydrolase promoter by hormones and sterols: a role for nuclear factor-Y in the sterol-mediated response.
The possible involvement of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) in the metabolism of oxidized phosphatidylcholine (PC) in plasma was investigated. A variety of oxidized products are formed from PC following oxidation of low density lipoproteins (LDL). A significant increase in LDL oxidation levels in patients with familial LCAT deficiency (FLD) has been previously demonstrated by a sensitive sandwich ELISA for oxidized LDL using the monoclonal antibody DLH3 which recognizes oxidized products of PC. In the present study, we found that LCAT produces various metabolites from oxidized PC and that oxidized PC molecules in LDL particles serve as substrates. When the neutral lipid fraction was separated by TLC after the incubation of oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]linoleoyl PC with human plasma, a number of radioactive bands were formed in addition to cholesteryl ester. These products were not formed from native 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]linoleoyl PC. Plasma from FLD patients also failed to form the additional products from oxidized PC. The addition of dithio-bis(nitrobenzoate) (DTNB), an LCAT inhibitor, or the inactivation of LCAT activity by treating the plasma at 56 degrees C for 30 min abolished the generation of these products from oxidized PC. The activity was recovered in the high density lipoprotein (HDL) fraction but not in the LDL fraction separated from normal plasma. When 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C](9-oxononanoyl) PC and 1-stearoyl-2-[1-14C](5-oxovaleroyl)PC, PC oxidation products that contain short chain aldehydes, were incubated with human plasma, radioactive products in the neutral lipid fraction were observed on TLC. LDL containing oxidized PC was measured by sandwich ELISA using an anti-apolipoprotein B antibody and DLH3. The reconstituted oxidized PC-LDL particles were found to have lost their ability to bind DLH3 upon incubation with HDL, while the reactivity of the reconstituted oxidized PC-LDL remained unchanged in the presence of DTNB. These results suggest that LCAT is capable of metabolizing a variety of oxidized products of PC and preventing the accumulation of oxidized PC in circulating LDL particles.
The effect of phospholipid composition in cholesteryl ester (CE)-micellar substrates on neutral cholesterol esterase (N-CEase) activity was examined. N-CEase preparation was incubated with micelles composed of cholesteryl-[1-14C]-oleate, sodium taurocholate, and phosphatidylcholine (PC)/phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) at varying ratios (%PE:0 = PC only, 17, 33, 50, 66, 83). The activity increased dependently with the increase in PE content; the activity with the micelles containing the highest ratio of PE was 2.5-fold compared with the micelles consisting of PC only. Vmax with the micelles of 83, 66, and 50% PE was 3.1-, 2.7-, and 1.9-fold, respectively, compared with the micelles of PC only. Each micellar preparation was chromatographed through a Superose 6 column by the FPLC system. In 66 and 83% PE-containing micelles, PC, PE, CE, and part of sodium taurocholate eluted completely together in a single peak, whereas in micelles with 33 and 50% PE they eluted loosely together. The micelles with PC only or 17% PE formed PC-micelles without including CE and PE. It is concluded that PE plays a critical role in the formation of CE micelles with PC, and in the interaction with N-CEase. The CE-micelles with 66-83% PE serve as substrates for sensitive and reproducible N-CEase assay.
To understand molecular events in regulation of hepatic neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase (EC3.1.1.13; CEH), catalytic activity, protein mass, and mRNA levels were measured in rats with various perturbations of hepatic cholesterol metabolism. Cholesterol feeding decreased activity (56 +/- 2%), mass (44 +/- 2%), and mRNA (14 +/- 3%). The cholesterol precursor mevalonate also decreased activity (42 +/- 6%), mass (76 +/- 3%), and mRNA (23 +/- 16%). Inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis by lovastatin increased activity (65 +/- 12%) and mRNA (31 +/- 24%). Stimulation of cholesterol efflux by chronic biliary diversion increased activity (138 +/- 34%), mass (29 +/- 7%), and mRNA (146 +/- 28%). Chenodeoxycholate feeding decreased activity (46 +/- 6%) and mRNA (26 +/- 12%). These data suggest rational regulation of CEH in response to changes in cholesterol flux through the liver. In primary hepatocytes, steady-state mRNA markedly decreased during 72-h cultures and addition of L-thyroxine and dexamethasone synergistically maintained mRNA levels near control values. Lovastatin increased mRNA levels by 103 +/- 15%. Taurocholate and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate suppressed mRNA (61 +/- 4% and 49 +/- 13%, respectively), suggesting that protein kinase C mediated effects of bile acids on CEH mRNA levels. These data suggest regulation of CEH by hormones and signal transduction in addition to changes in cholesterol flux.
Neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase is a key enzyme in regulating hepatic free cholesterol. Using the CEH specific cDNA sequence in the 5'-untranslated region as a primer, we amplified and cloned 1.3 Kb of promoter sequence upstream of the ATG initiation codon. Analysis of the sequence revealed the presence of a consensus GC-box, which can bind the positive transcription factor Sp1, 35 bases upstream from the transcription start site. Transcriptional regulation by agents perturbing cholesterol metabolism was studied in HepG2 cells by transient transfection assays of the promoter activity in deletion constructs linked to the luciferase reporter gene. Three functional sterol response sequences were identified at positions-92, -160, and -280 of the CEH promoter. The sterol response sequence at position -92 was shown to bind SREBP-2. Therefore, the CEH gene is similar to other genes involved in regulation of cholesterol homeostasis, in that it appears to be transcriptionally regulated by sterols.
Cholesteryl esters (CE) in lipid droplets undergo a continual cycle of hydrolysis and reesterification by neutral cholesterol esterase (N-CEase) and acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), respectively. The mechanism by which HDL mobilizes CE from lipid droplets in J774 A.1 cells was investigated, focusing on N-CEase activity. We asked whether HDL enhances the activity and, if so, what signals induce the change of the activity. An incubation of cells with HDL enhanced the decline of cholesteryl-[l-14C]-oleate in foam cells and increased N-CEase activity in the supernatant of cell homogenate in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas incubation with LDL decreased the activity. In addition, N-CEase activity was fivefold higher when cells were cultured in 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) medium (2 micrograms cholesterol/mL) than when cultured in 10% fetal calf serum medium (31 micrograms cholesterol/mL), suggesting that changes in N-CEase activity are mediated by cholesterol. An addition of cholesterol (0 to 30 micrograms/mL) in LPDS medium markedly inhibited N-CEase activity with a concomitant increase in cellular cholesterol concentration. This inhibitory effect of cholesterol was also observed in mouse peritoneal macrophages. In vitro addition of cholesterol did not affect N-CEase activity. Treatment of cells with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors enhanced N-CEase activity, whereas ACAT inhibitor decreased the activity. Northern blot analysis of N-CEase mRNA showed that the expression was not altered by the presence of cholesterol in LPDS medium. These results suggest that cholesterol downregulates N-CEase activity, probably through cholesterol-dependent appearance of some factors.
The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Dex) on cholesterol esterification in cultured human smooth muscle cells (SMC). In labeled SMC, Dex stimulated the esterification of [3H]cholesterol in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was specific for glucocorticoid hormones and could be inhibited by cycloheximide (3 ng/mL), actinomycin D (10(-5) mol/L), and the specific glucocorticoid antagonist RU 486 (10(-8) mol/L). When plasma membrane was selectively labeled with trace quantities of [3H]cholesterol (0.25 microCi/mL, 1 hour, 10 degrees C), Dex (10(-8) mol/L) caused a net flux of free [3H]cholesterol into the cells. Moreover, Dex (10(-8) mol/L, 24 hours) stimulated the esterification of sterols, newly synthesized from [14C]mevalonate (10 microCi/mL, 4 hours) and lowered the amount of [14C]sterols susceptible for cholesterol oxidase. The incorporation of [14C]oleic acid into cholesteryl esters was markedly higher in Dex-pretreated SMC than in the control cells (2.1 +/- 0.07 and 1.4 +/- 0.1 pmol/h/microgram protein, respectively, P &lt; .01). At the time, cholesteryl ester hydrolysis in Dex-treated cells was reduced (72 +/- 8 pmol cholesteryl esters/h per milligram versus 130 +/- 10 in the control cells). HDL3-mediated [3H]cholesterol efflux was also inhibited in Dex-treated cells; moreover, HDL3 (40 micrograms/mL, 24 hours) had practically no effect on [3H]cholesteryl ester content in Dex-treated SMC but caused a 50% reduction of [3H]cholesteryl esters in the control cells. Thus, in human SMC glucocorticoids alter the redistribution of cholesterol between the pools of free and esterified cholesterol, paralleled by the change in acyl coenzyme A: cholesteryl acyltransferase and neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase activities, leading to the impaired HDL3-mediated cholesterol efflux.
Rat liver homogenates contain a neutral lipid ester hydrolase that requires millimolar concentrations of bile salts for maximal activity in catalyzing the hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters and retinyl esters in vitro. Previous studies have demonstrated that this hepatic hydrolase resembles rat pancreatic carboxylester lipase because it reacts with a specific pancreatic carboxylester lipase antibody and the eight N-terminal amino acids of the hepatic protein are identical to those of the pancreatic enzyme. Nonetheless, the exact molecular relationship between the hepatic and pancreatic enzymes is unclear. In the present study, a rat hepatic cDNA encoding the enzyme was cloned. Sequence analysis demonstrated that this cDNA corresponds to the full-length mature pancreatic carboxylester lipase (EC# 3.1.1.13). In individual animals the hepatic and pancreatic cDNA sequences were identical. However, among rats there were sequence variations, suggesting a polymorphic nature for this rat gene.
Human gastric lipase (HGL; triacylglycerol lipase; EC 3.1.1.3) plays an important role in the digestion of dietary triglycerides in the gastrointestinal tract, especially in patients suffering from pancreatic lipase deficiencies. The enzyme is secreted by the fundic mucosa of the stomach and hydrolyzes the ester bonds of triglycerides under acidic pH conditions, while cholesteryl esters are not attacked. The 379-amino acid protein is highly homologous to two other acidic lipases, rat lingual lipase (RLL; triacylglycerol lipase; EC 3.1.1.3) and human lysosomal acid lipase (HLAL; cholesteryl esterase; EC 3.1.1.13). To determine whether this remarkable similarity is also present at the genomic level, we have elucidated the respective gene structures by screening three bacteriophage lambda libraries and by polymerase chain reaction-based intron amplification. The genes encoding HGL, RLL, and HLAL are composed of 10 exons interrupted by nine introns and span about 14 kb, 18.7 kb, and 38.8 kb of genomic DNA, respectively. The HGL and RLL gene organizations are identical, suggesting that RLL is the rat gastric lipase expressed in the serous von Ebner glands of the tongue. The positions of the HLAL intervening sequences are also absolutely conserved, except for the location of intron 1. Our results support the concept that HLAL and HGL/RLL are members of a gene family of lipases that most likely have evolved by duplication of an ancestral gene and subsequently assumed distinct roles in neutral lipid metabolism due to sequence divergence and different expression patterns.
Acute inflammation results in a profound change in the apolipoprotein composition of high density lipoprotein (HDL). Several isoforms of the serum amyloid A (SAA) family, SAA1 and SAA2, become major components of HDL. This structural relationship has suggested that acute phase SAA plays some as yet unidentified role in HDL function, possibly related to cholesterol transport, during the course of acute inflammation. Using subcutaneous AgNO3 to induce a sterile abscess changes in plasma cholesterol and SAA were monitored over the subsequent 144 h. Total plasma cholesterol began to increase within 12 h of the induction of inflammation and reached a peak in 24 h. Thereafter its plasma levels fell returning to normal values by 96-120 h. The bulk of the increase in plasma cholesterol was found in the free cholesterol fraction of HDL. This pattern of cholesterol increase corresponds to the established temporal changes for acute phase SAA (AP-SAA). AP-SAA levels increased within 8 h of the induction of inflammation and reached a peak at 24 h. They began to decrease by 48 h with small quantites still present 120 h later. In concert, but inversely, with the changes in AP-SAA the apoA-I, apoA-II, and apo-E, content of HDL decreased during the AP-SAA increases and increased as AP-SAA levels fell. The plasma appearance of cholesterol from the periphery, and central parts of the inflammatory site was assessed by the use of radiolabelled cholesterol. The peripherally placed cholesterol rapidly reached a peak plasma concentration within 24 h of injection. Cholesterol placed in the central part of the sterile abscess, a site relatively inaccessible to the vasculature required 48 h to reach its peak and was 5-times lower than that placed peripherally. The influence of AP-SAA on neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase (nCEH) activity in mouse liver homogenates, mouse peritoneal macrophage homogenates, and a purified porcine pancreatic enzyme with nCEH activity was also assessed. Following optimization with regard to pH, bile salt concentration, protein concentration and incubation time, mouse peritoneal macrophages had a significantly higher nCEH specific activity than that found in liver (7-8 fold). Purified AP-SAA, assessed over a concentration range of 0-10 microg/ml, enhanced nCEH activity at concentrations above 2 microg/ml. The nCEH activity, regardless of its source, increased by 3-7 fold in the presence of AP-SAA. Equivalent concentrations of apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) failed to alter the activity of nCEH. The effect of AP-SAA on a purified form of nCEH suggests that AP-SAA may have a direct effect on the activity of this enzyme. The temporal correlation of circulating AP-SAA and plasma cholesterol and the significant stimulation of nCEH by AP-SAA (but not apoA-I or BSA) provides further evidence that AP-SAA plays a role in cholesterol metabolism during the course of acute inflammation.
Hyperinsulinaemia may play a role in the development of atherosclerosis; however, the direct effect of endogenous insulin on the atherosclerotic process is not well understood. To clarify this situation we performed pancreas transplantation with systemic venous drainage in Wistar Shionogi (WS) and Spontaneous Hypertensive (SHR) rats. Both rats received syngeneic pancreaticoduodenal transplants from donor rats. SHR rats were used to observe the additive effects of both hypertension and hyperinsulinaemia on the atherosclerotic process. Peak blood insulin levels after a glucose load were approximately two times higher in transplanted rats than in non-transplanted WS and SHR rats. By contrast, there was no difference in plasma glucose responses between transplanted and non-transplanted rats. Hyperinsulinaemia was not related to dyslipidaemia and hypertension in transplanted rats. Nine months after transplantation, the cholesterol ester contents of the aortas of both WS and SHR transplanted rats were significantly higher than in the control rats (WS: 1.9 +/- 1.0 vs 3.8 +/- 2.1 mg/g dry tissue, p &lt; 0.01; SHR: 1.7 +/- 1.3 vs 3.7 +/- 1.4 mg/g dry tissue, p &lt; 0.05). No differences were demonstrated in the thickness of the intima or in the histology of the aortas of transplanted and control rats. To study the mechanism for cholesterol ester accumulation in the arterial wall, we measured neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase activities in vascular medial smooth muscle cells. Insulin significantly suppressed neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase activities in medial smooth muscle cells. Our results indicate that endogenous hyperinsulinaemia contributes to the development of atherosclerosis by accelerating cholesterol ester accumulation in the arterial wall.
Foam cell formation by lipid accumulation in macrophages is a prominent finding in atherosclerotic plaques. Since macrophages cannot limit the uptake of lipids, cholesterol efflux is probably essential to inhibit progression and cause regression of atherosclerosis. Cholesterol efflux is generally attributed to HDL in the extracellular space. Slow bidirectional fluxes of cholesterol occur between plasma membrane and lipid-rich HDL subclasses. Esterification of cholesterol in HDL by lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase causes net cholesterol efflux. In contrast, some lipid-free apolipoproteins (especially apolipoprotein A-I) and lipid-poor HDL subclasses such as prebeta 1-apolipoprotein A-I containing lipoprotein mediate rapid and unidirectional cholesterol efflux from specific cholesterol domains in the plasma membrane. Extracellular presence of HDL or apolipoprotein A-I moreover facilitates the translocation of cholesterol from intracellular pools to the plasma membrane, probably via signal transduction. The activated transfer machinery appears to involve the Golgi apparatus and diverts cholesterol from the shuttle between acylcoenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase and neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase (cholesteryl ester cycle). Endogenously synthesized apolipoprotein E facilitates HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux from macrophages. Moreover, at least in human monocyte-derived macrophages, apolipoprotein E appears to be involved in the export of cholesterol independently from extracellular acceptors. Cholesterol efflux can be inhibited by some oxysterols that are found in macrophages of atherosclerotic plaques and macrophages that are loaded in vitro with oxidized LDL.
We investigated the anti-atherosclerotic action shown by Shosaikoto, a Kampo medicine, using hypercholesterolemic mice. Oral administration of Shosaikoto significantly suppressed the elevation of serum cholesterol in C57BL/6 mice fed a 1.25% cholesterol-enriched diet for four weeks and improved the T cell ratio in peripheral blood, which decreased with the increase of the serum cholesterol level. In addition, Shosaikoto reduced the accumulation of cholesteryl oleate, which alters macrophages into foam cells, after the treatment of macrophages with oxidized or acetylated low density lipoprotein (LDL). Enzymatic study revealed that the treatment of macrophages with oxidized LDL enhanced acyl-coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) activity and markedly reduced neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase (NCEase) activity. Shosaikoto treatment prevented a decrease in the NCEase activity, however due to the oxidized LDL treatment, although it slightly augmented ACAT activity. Thus, Shosaikoto, which is known to modulate the immune system, improves macrophage and lymphocyte functions diminished by hypercholesterolemia, resulting in an anti-atherosclerotic action.
Premenopausal women are at a lower risk of coronary heart disease relative to age matched men. However, the underlying mechanisms are not clearly understood. This article studies the effects of 17 beta-estradiol (17 beta-E2) at physiological concentrations on the cholesterylester metabolism in macrophages (J774 A.1 cells) with a particular focus on neutral cholesterol esterase (N-CEase). Cells were incubated with beta-VLDL, [1-14C]oleic acid and 17 beta-E2 (0.25 and 2.5 nM). 17 beta-E2 dose-dependently reduced cholesteryl-[1-14C]oleate (14C-CO) at 36 h and 48 h relative to the control. It also stimulated hydrolysis of 14C-CO in foam cells on 36 h and 48 h incubation. In addition, 17 beta-E2 markedly increased N-CEase activity at 24 h and 36 h. This increase preceded the enhanced hydrolysis of cholesterylester, 17 alpha-E2 (inactive isomer), estrone and estriol had no stimulatory action on N-CEase, whereas progesterone and testosterone inhibited it. 17 beta-E2-treatment (24 h) increased the activity of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (A-kinase). DEAE-cellulose column chromatography revealed that an isoform (type II) of A-kinase appeared in 17 beta-E2-treated cells in addition to type I of A-kinase found in the control cells. These results suggest that inhibition of cholesterylester accumulation in macrophages by 17 beta-E2 is mediated by an enhancement of N-CEase activity possibly through an increase in A-kinase.
Perilipins are a family of unique proteins intimately associated with the limiting surface of neutral lipid storage droplets in adipocytes and in steroidogenic cells. Lipid hydrolysis in these cells is initiated by cAMP, which leads to phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase in adipocytes and cholesteryl esterase in steroidogenic cells by protein kinase A. Although the concurrent phosphorylation of perilipin by this kinase suggests a role for these proteins in lipid breakdown, a role for these proteins in lipid packaging or in maintaining the lipid droplet structure cannot be excluded.
The formation of macrophage-derived foam cells is central to the development of fatty streaks within the arterial wall, and to the progression of atherosclerosis. The unregulated deposition of cholesteryl esters, as lipid droplets within the cytoplasm of these cells, is responsible for the formation of foam cells; this process is thought to be regulated by the balance between cholesterol esterification, by acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), and hydrolysis, by neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase (nCEH). This study examines the importance of the balance between these two enzymes in determining the efflux of cholesterol from human (THP-1) macrophages. The presence of modified lipoprotein, or of 25-hydroxycholesterol, markedly increased cholesterol esterification in these cells and these effects were potently inhibited by the presence of the ACAT inhibitor, 447C88. In the absence of HDL, an acceptor particle, there was little or no hydrolysis of the cholesteryl ester pool and no efflux of cholesterol to the extracellular milieu; addition of HDL led to a partial (36%) reduction in cholesteryl esters, an effect which was not enhanced by the inhibition of ACAT. This suggested that the stored cholesteryl esters in human (THP-1) macrophages, unlike those in mouse peritoneal macrophages, were relatively resistant to removal by efflux to HDL. Efflux of newly synthesised free cholesterol from these macrophages was increased by HDL in a saturable manner, suggesting that the lack of reduction of stored cholesteryl esters was due to impaired mobilisation of cholesteryl esters to free cholesterol via nCEH. Indeed, nCEH activity in these macrophages was much lower than in mouse peritoneal macrophages, and appeared to be down-regulated in the presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol or modified lipoproteins; this loss of nCEH activity was prevented by the ACAT inhibitor 447C88. The efflux of stored cholesteryl esters from THP-1 macrophages therefore appears to be limited by the activity of nCEH.
The effects of two cell-permeable cyclic AMP analogues, 8-chloro cyclic AMP (8-Cl cAMP) and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio) cyclic AMP (8-CPT cAMP), on cholesterol esterification, cholesteryl ester hydrolysis and bile acid synthesis were compared in cultured rat and hamster hepatocytes. Cholesterol esterification, as measured by the incorporation of [3H]oleate into cholesteryl ester, was increased by 58-88% by the analogues in rat hepatocytes and by 33-43% in hamster cells. The response in rat hepatocytes, however, was observed after a relatively short incubation time (28% increase after 1 hr), whereas that in hamster cells required a longer period (36% after 12 hr) to become apparent. The activity of the cytosolic neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase in rat hepatocytes was also stimulated by both cyclic AMP analogues (31-37%, but the microsomal activity was unaffected. In hamster hepatocytes, however, microsomal cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity was increased (47-80%) in the presence of 8-Cl cAMP or 8-CPT cAMP. Bile acid synthesis was increased by 8-CPT cyclic AMP in rat cells (approximately 25%) but was unchanged by both analogues in hamster hepatocytes. These results indicate significant differences in the way in which cholesterol metabolism responds to cyclic AMP in cultured rat and hamster hepatocytes.
The 1923 bp cDNA for rat hepatic cholesteryl ester hydrolase (CEH) was cloned by screening a lambda gt11 expression library with an oligonucleotide containing the consensus active site sequence for cholesteryl esterases. Expression of a fusion protein, cross-reacting with antibody to the purified liver CEH, was demonstrated by Western blot analysis. The cDNA was sequenced and found to have only 44% homology with pancreatic CEH. Although unique, the cDNA sequence exhibited much greater overall homology with liver carboxylesterases, in both coding and 5'/3' non-coding regions. In Northern blot analysis, the cDNA hybridized with a single band from liver mRNA but not with pancreatic mRNA. The 1.7 kb coding sequence, predicting a 62 kDa protein, was cloned into an Escherichia coli expression system with an inducible promoter and into COS-7 cells. Both expression systems produced a protein which comigrated with liver CEH (66 kDa) on SDS-PAGE and immunoreacted with antibodies to liver CEH on Western blots. Whereas the prokaryotic system produced an inactive protein, expression in COS-7 cells was accompanied by a 5-fold increase in CEH activity and a corresponding increase in immunoreactive protein.
The influence of dietary simvastatin, cholestyramine, and the combination of simvastatin plus cholestyramine on hepatic cholesterol metabolism has been investigated in male rats. Recovery from the effects of the drugs was also investigated by refeeding normal chow for 24 h. Both drugs, alone and in combination, increased 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase activity in vitro, but activity returned toward control values, after drug withdrawal. Acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) was significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.001) by simvastain (-75%), cholestyramine (-71%), and by the drug combination (-81%), due both to a decrease in microsomal cholesterol and to nonsubstrate-dependent modulation of enzyme activity. Refeeding control diet increased ACAT activity but not to control levels. The enhanced activity arose partly from higher microsomal cholesterol and partly from increases in total enzyme activity. Cytosolic neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase (CEH) activity was substantially elevated by simvastatin (3-fold) and by the drug combination (6-fold), whereas the effect of cholestyramine was smaller (1.5-fold). Normal chow for 24 h only partially returned cytosolic CEH activity to control values. Microsomal CEH activity was increased by simvastatin, alone and in combination with cholestyramine (1.4 to 1.7-fold), and was also enhanced, in the cholestyramine-treated animals, following drug withdrawal. Removal of simvastatin did not allow recovery of this enzyme activity, while withdrawal of the drug combination led to values 29% below controls. The results indicate that in the rat, simvastatin and cholestyramine alter both ACAT and CEH activity, as well as inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase activity.
The effects of dexamethasone on lipid accumulation by human monocyte-derived macrophages were investigated. Preincubation of macrophages with dexamethasone for a period of 16-20 h resulted in a reproducible increase (3.5-fold) in the incorporation of oleate into cholesteryl esters. The effect was specific because no alterations were observed in oleate incorporation into triglycerides or phospholipids. Measurement of cellular cholesteryl esters indicated a fourfold increase after preincubation with dexamethasone. This increase was mediated by opposite effects on synthesis and breakdown of these lipids. Dexamethasone produced a 60% increase in activity of the enzyme acyl-CoA: cholesterol O-acyltransferase (ACAT), active in synthesis of cholesteryl esters, and a 40% decrease in that of neutral cholesteryl esterase, active in cholesteryl ester breakdown. The increased ACAT activity appeared to reflect increased mRNA for the enzyme. The effects of dexamethasone on cholesteryl ester accumulation by macrophages reached statistical significance at a concentration of 100 nM. They were dose dependent, and saturation was observed at around 1 microM. The effects were significant at low concentrations of cholesterol in the medium. At high-medium cholesterol, there was a large cholesterol-induced increase in ACAT activity that obscured most of the effect of dexamethasone. In general, the data suggest that high glucocorticoid levels enhance lipid accumulation by macrophages and thus would have an atherogenic action that is independent of serum cholesterol.
Cholesterol metabolism in macrophages from atherosclerosis-prone C57BL/6J mice was compared with that in macrophages from atherosclerosis-resistant C3H/HeN mice. Plasma total cholesterol levels of both types of mice were significantly increased, but HDL cholesterol level was increased only in C3H/HeN mice when a high-cholesterol diet (1% cholesterol) was fed for 5 weeks. After incubation of macrophages from male and female mice on the high-cholesterol diet with beta-VLDL for 24 hours, cholesterol content in macrophages from C57BL/6J was approximately 1.5- to 2.0-fold higher than in those from C3H/HeN mice. [3H]Cholesterol oleate-beta-VLDL incorporation into macrophages from C57BL/6J mice on the high-cholesterol diet was greater than incorporation into those from C3H/HeN mice. The release of [3H]cholesterol from macrophages from C57BL/6J mice on the high-cholesterol diet was one seventh that from macrophages from C57BL/6J mice on the basal diet or that from macrophages from C3H/HeN mice on the basal or high-cholesterol diet. Acid cholesterol esterase activity was almost the same in macrophages from any group. Acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activity in macrophages from C57BL/6J mice on the high-cholesterol diet increased compared with that from macrophages from C57BL/6J mice on the normal diet. Neutral cholesterol esterase activity in macrophages from C57BL/6J mice was about half of that in macrophages from C3H/HeN mice independent of the type of diet. There were no sex differences in these metabolisms. Considered with our previous data, these results suggested that a high-cholesterol diet may cause metabolic changes to accumulate cholesterol ester in macrophages from C57BL/6J mice in accordance with genetic abnormalities.
When rat macrophages were converted to foam cells with acetylated low density lipoprotein (acetyl-LDL) and then reacted with high density lipoprotein (HDL) and an inhibitor of acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (58-035) (sequential incubation system), 58-035 did not enhance HDL-induced cholesterol efflux. In contrast, when macrophages were exposed to acetyl-LDL in the presence of both HDL and 58-035 (simultaneous incubation system), HDL-induced cholesterol efflux was enhanced 1.6-fold by 58-035. Cholesterol efflux with HDL alone was 2-fold greater in simultaneous incubation than in sequential incubation. These results suggest the presence of an efficient cholesterol efflux pathway in simultaneous incubation which is not available in sequential incubation. This pathway, which we refer to as the neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase-independent pathway, is characterized by the efflux of lysosome-derived cholesterol without re-esterification.
Male rats were fed for 10 days on a diet supplemented with either probucol or clofibrate, alone or in combination, and the effects of the drugs on hepatic cholesterol metabolism studied. Plasma triacylglycerols were significantly lowered (15.6%, P &lt; 0.05) by the drugs in combination but not individually whereas plasma cholesterol levels were reduced by probucol alone (22.4%, P &lt; 0.05) and the combined treatment effected a further decrease leading to a total reduction of 50.6% (P &lt; 0.001). Probucol reduced hepatic cellular triacylglycerols (20.0%, P &lt; 0.05) and cholesterol (15.3%, P &lt; 0.05) but cholesteryl esters were unaffected. In combination with clofibrate, probucol accentuated the reductions in both cellular cholesterol and cholesteryl esters produced by clofibrate alone and lowered their levels by 22.8%, P &lt; 0.01 and 38.5%, P &lt; 0.001, respectively. Although probucol, on its own, did not affect the activity of acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), its combination with clofibrate caused less inhibition (43.5%, P &lt; 0.01) of this enzyme activity than clofibrate alone (65.7%, P &lt; 0.001). Probucol had a similarly moderating effect on the clofibrate-induced reductions in microsomal cholesterol and cholesteryl esters. Neither the microsomal nor the cytosolic neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase was affected by probucol alone although both enzymes were dramatically increased (between 350% and 550%) by clofibrate and the combined treatment. The activity of the hepatic cytosolic inhibitor of cholesteryl ester hydrolase was unaffected by clofibrate or probucol individually but the two drugs in combination increased the total activity of the inhibitor by 52.1%, P &lt; 0.01. When allowance was made for this increased inhibitor activity, it was clear that probucol accentuated the stimulatory effect of clofibrate on the cytosolic nCEH.
The present studies examine the modulation of lipoprotein metabolism at subcellular sites in the liver by female sex hormones. Subcutaneous injection of ethinyl estradiol (5 mg/kg) decreased both triacylglycerol (TG) lipase activity and neutral cholesteryl ester (CE) hydrolase activity in hepatic endosomes while increasing lysosomal lipid hydrolysis. These data suggest that estrogen may induce a shift in the site of intracellular lipid catabolism similar to that found in fasting animals [1]. This work also shows that TG-lipase activity is increased in the CURL and MVB endosomal fractions of ovariectomized rats compared to that found in the equivalent endosomal compartments of age-matched intact female controls. These observations are consistent with an inhibition of endosomal lipase by female sex hormones under physiologic conditions.
The mechanism for antiatherogenic effects of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) was investigated in J774 A.1 cells incubated with beta-VLDL. E2 at physiological concentrations (0.25 and 2.5 nM) inhibited an accumulation of cellular cholesteryl esters and enhanced their hydrolysis in foam cells. These phenomena were preceded by activation of neutral cholesterol esterase through an increase in cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity. 17 alpha-estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone lacked such stimulatory effects on neutral cholesteryl esterase.
The effect of monocyte colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) on the beta-very low density lipoprotein (beta-VLDL) metabolism in THP-1 cells (human leukemia cell line) was studied. THP-1 cells treated with M-CSF decreased Latex Bead phagocytosis, but the cells incubated with 12-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) enhanced phagocytosis 2.5-fold. Binding activity of 125I-M-CSF to THP-1 cells was higher than that in THP-1 cells elicited with TPA. THP-1 cells incubated with M-CSF before TPA treatment were designated MT macrophages, and those incubated with M-CSF after TPA treatment were called TM macrophages. When these cells were incubated with beta-VLDL, the cholesterol ester content in MT macrophages was less than in TM macrophages. The uptake of [3H]cholesterol oleate-beta-VLDL in MT macrophages was the same as in TM macrophages. The released radioactivity from [3H]cholesterol oleate-beta-VLDL loaded MT macrophages was higher than that from TM macrophages. Acid cholesterol esterase activity and ACAT activity were the same in both types of macrophages. Neutral cholesterol esterase activity was higher in MT than in TM macrophages. These results suggested that beta-VLDL-induced cholesterol ester deposition in THP-1 cells-derived macrophages was suppressed by M-CSF, when M-CSF acted at the stage of monocytes (THP-1 cells), and that the reduction of cholesterol ester might be due to enhanced release of cholesterol from the cells with high neutral cholesterol esterase activity.
It is the aim of this paper to review our findings in vitro, in experimental animals and in human on arterial wall lipid metabolism. Radiolabelling of LDL indicates that experimentally induced lesions in hypercholesterolemic rabbits do show less lipid accumulation if treated with prostaglandins (PGI2, PGE1, 13,14-dihydro-PGE1) or stimulators of prostaglandin synthesis (isradipine, a calcium channel blocker of the dihydropyridine family). Endogenous blockade of cyclooxygenase by ASA-pretreatment results in a complete abolishing of this apparently PG-mediated benefit. In-vivo studies using autologous 123I-labeled LDL without therapeutic intervention exhibit a quite good reproducibility of the imaging technique. While PGE1 (at 2 different therapeutic regimens) is inducing lipid lesion regression, the comparable benefit induced by isradipine again disappears with concomitant ASA-therapy. Quantitative estimation of arterial wall lipid metabolism in patients undergoing vascular surgery demonstrates that PGI1- (and cAMP-) increase are paralleled by a several-fold increase of acid and neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase and a decrease in net arterial cholesterol ester content. This benefit again disappears with concomitant ASA-therapy. These findings are allowing to conclude that (exogenously added or endogenously stimulated) prostaglandins do significantly improve arterial wall lipid metabolism.
The metal complexes of amine-carboxyborane including copper, chromium, zinc, calcium amd cobalt were effective hypolipidemic agents lowering both serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels significantly in mice at 8 mg/kg/day, I.P. after 16 days. The agents reduced acetyl CoA synthetase, ATP-dependent citrate lyase, acyl CoA cholesterol acyl transferase, sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyl transferase activities of rat liver and small intestinal mucosa after 14 days treatment. The neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase activity was elevated by the agents in both tissues. The metal complexes altered lipid levels in the bile of rats after treatment as well as the bile acid composition after 14 days administration, orally. The agents blocked enterohepatic absorption of cholesterol from rat isolated intestinal loops.
The present studies examine the modulation of lipid metabolism at subcellular sites in the liver of control and cholestatic rats by a male sex hormone. Subcutaneous injection of testosterone enanthate (5 mg/kg body weight), increased triacylglycerol lipase (TG-lipase) and neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase (CE-hydrolase) activity in endosomes of normal rats. During induced cholestasis, TG-lipase and CE-hydrolase activity in endosomal fractions were decreased compared to those in endosomes of age-matched sham-operated female controls. Following testosterone administration to cholestatic rats, endosomal lipolytic enzyme activity increased to approximate the levels of normal controls. These observations may provide insight into the alterations in lipid metabolism which accompany cholestatic liver disease.
The regulation of neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase activity by changes in its phosphorylation state was studied in rat liver microsomes. Treatment with cAMP-dependent protein kinase resulted in increased enzyme activity, which was further enhanced by the addition of cAMP and MgATP. Consistent activations were also achieved with MgCl2 and MgATP, the magnesium effect being abolished by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and adenosine triphosphate. Cholesterol ester hydrolase was activated twofold by free calcium and Ca2+/calmodulin; this latter effect was blocked by the chelator ethylene-glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid and the calmodulin antagonist trifluoperazine. The phosphatase inhibitors pyrophosphate and glycerophosphate led to marked and dose-dependent increases in esterase activity, whereas okadaic acid elicited no effect. Furthermore, pyrophosphate and okadaic acid did not change the increases in enzyme activity promoted by Ca2+, Ca2+/calmodulin, Mg2+ and MgATP. Cholesterol ester hydrolase was inactivated in a concentration-dependent manner by nonspecific alkaline phosphatases. In cAMP-dependent protein kinase/cAMP- or Ca2+/calmodulin-activated microsomes, a time-dependent loss of activation in cholesteryl oleate hydrolysis was caused by alkaline phosphatase. These findings suggest that microsomal cholesterol ester hydrolase is activated through cAMP and Ca2+/calmodulin phosphorylation, whereas enzyme deactivation is dependent on phosphatase action.
The effect of macrophages on the uptake of beta-very low-density lipoprotein (beta-VLDL) by smooth muscle cells (SMC) expressing different morphological phenotypes was examined in culture. The SMC were grown alone and in co-culture with macrophages for four days, then incubated with different concentrations of 125I-beta-VLDL for 3 h at 4 degrees C or with 75 ug/ml beta-VLDL for 24 h at 37 degrees C. The binding of beta-VLDL to SMC at 4 degrees C was enhanced in the presence of macrophages irrespective of the phenotype expressed by SMC. This occurred through modification of the lipoprotein, since binding of re-isolated macrophage-conditioned beta-VLDL to SMC was 12.5 times that of fresh beta-VLDL. This modified form of beta-VLDL competed with fresh beta-VLDL for binding to SMC. Binding was inhibited in the presence of probucol, suggesting that an oxidative mechanism may be involved. The presence of macrophages also enhanced the accumulation of beta-VLDL-derived cholesterol in SMC. While most of this is a consequence of the enhanced binding, macrophages may also act directly on SMC to increase cholesterol accumulation, since the activity of acid cholesterol ester hydrolase and neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase in SMC was reduced in the presence of macrophages.
Hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) is an enzyme of relatively broad specificity, having the ability to hydrolyze tri-, di- and mono-acylglycerols as well as cholesterol esters and small water-soluble substrates. This broad specificity allows HSL to perform a variety of functions in several tissues. A key feature of HSL is its ability to be activated via phosphorylation by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. In addition it is phosphorylated at a second site by several kinases, notably AMP-activated protein kinase. Phosphorylation of this site apparently plays a role in rendering the enzyme hormone-insensitive, in that prior phosphorylation at site 2 prevents phosphorylation and activation at site 1 by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Investigation of the protein phosphatases responsible for dephosphorylation of these sites has indicated that phosphatase 2A plays a predominant role but also that protein phosphatase 2C is a significant phosphatase targeted against both phosphorylation sites. Evidence indicates that HSL has at least three functional domains which contain (a) the phosphorylation sites which control activity, (b) the active site responsible for the catalytic activity and (c) a lipid binding site responsible for anchoring the lipase at the water-lipid interface. Using limited proteolytic studies we have found that it is possible to cleave HSL into several fragments including a stable domain of M(r) approximately 17.6 kDa which contains the active site serine residue. Digestion under similar conditions also generates a stable domain of M(r) approximately 11.5 kDa containing both phosphorylation sites. Furthermore, under appropriate conditions it is possible to digest HSL and retain activity against water-soluble substrates but with the concomitant loss of activity against triacylglycerol, implying that a lipid binding domain is lost during this procedure. HSL is responsible for the neutral cholesterol esterase activity in macrophages and it may play a role in the accumulation of cholesterol esters which occur during the development of foam cells. HSL activity is reduced in macrophage foam cells, at least partly due to increased activity of a cytosolic HSL inhibitor protein. A finding unexplained for many years has been that, although lipolysis can be stimulated 50-100-fold in adipocytes by lipolytic hormones, HSL can apparently only be activated 2-3-fold via phosphorylation in vitro by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. One possibility to explain this discrepancy is that an additional anchoring protein is missing from the in vitro system and indirect evidence is now accumulating for such a protein.
We have in this study examined the effects of sphingosine, a possible secondary degradation product following sphingomyelin hydrolysis, on cholesterol homeostasis in cultured human fibroblasts treated with sphingomyelinase. The activation of cholesterol esterification, which resulted from the degradation of plasma membrane sphingomyelin (by sphingomyelinase), was observed to be effectively blocked by sphingosine (half-maximal dose 6-7 microM). The inhibitory action of sphingosine could not be reproduced with other amines (e.g., dodecyl amine or imipramine). The onset of inhibition of cholesteryl ester formation by sphingosine was rapid (maximal effect within 15 min). Sphingosine itself had no spontaneous effects on the distribution of cellular cholesterol. At concentrations below 10 microM, sphingosine was not cytotoxic, as determined by cellular trypan blue permeability. The inhibitory action of sphingosine on cholesteryl ester formation apparently did not result from a direct inhibition of acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), since the activity of this enzyme was unaffected by sphingosine (10 microM) in a cell-free homogenate, using [14C]oleoyl-CoA as a co-substrate. Sphingosine was also unable to prevent the formation of activated fatty acids (oleoyl-CoA), since acyl-CoA synthetase activity in a cell-free homogenate was not inhibited by sphingosine (at 5 microM). The cellular cholesteryl ester cycle (i.e., the neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase) was unaffected by sphingosine (at 5 microM). Down-regulation of PKC activity (24 h exposure of cells to 100 nM (62 ng/ml) phorbol ester) did not affect the sphingomyelinase-induced stimulation of [3H]cholesteryl ester formation. In addition, the sphingosine-induced inhibition of [3H]cholesteryl ester formation was not reversed in the presence of phorbol ester (short-term exposures), suggesting that the effect of sphingosine was not mediated via PKC. In conclusion, we have shown that sphingosine is an inhibitor of cholesteryl ester formation in fibroblasts. The inhibition is only seen with intact cells, which may suggest that a secondary metabolite of sphingosine was responsible for the observed inhibition of cholesteryl ester formation.
Diethylumbelliferyl phosphate (UBP) has been shown to inhibit the neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity responsible for hydrolysis of cellular lipid droplet cholesteryl ester (Harrison et al., 1990). The potential for (UBP) to inhibit uptake and hydrolysis of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesteryl ester was studied in Fu5AH hepatoma cells, a model for HDL cholesterol delivery. Coincubation of 3H-cholesteryl ester labeled HDL with UBP resulted in a 72% decrease in the cellular free cholesterol/cholesteryl ester (FC/CE) isotope ratio, indicating an inhibition in the conversion of cholesteryl ester to free cholesterol. Total cellular 3H-CE uptake was modestly (27%) but significantly decreased by UBP. Pulse-chase experiments (15 min. pulse and 7 min. chase) were used to study the hydrolysis of HDL 3H-CE in subcellular fractions separated by percoll gradients. The conversion of 3H-CE to 3H-FC could be demonstrated in fractions that comigrated with the plasma membrane/endosome fractions but were well separated from lysosomes. Neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity was detected in those same fractions. These results suggest that an extralysosomal pathway is operating in the metabolism of HDL cholesterol and its delivery to hepatoma cells.
Triaryl phosphates including tricresyl phosphate (TCP) and butylated triphenyl phosphate (BTP) are organophosphates used in the commercial manufacture of plastics, lubricants, and hydraulic fluids. Rat steroidogenic tissues such as adrenocortical (AC), ovarian interstitial (OI), and Leydig cells use an intracellular pathway to store cholesterol (substrate for biosynthesis of steroid hormones) as cholesteryl ester (CE). This pathway and the pathway for uptake of serum cholesterol are less used in Leydig cells of the adult male rat, resulting in a lower CE pool. BTP and TCP caused cholesteryl lipidosis in steroid hormone-synthesizing AC and OI, but not Leydig cells in the adult rat. The objectives of this study were to determine if the administration of triaryl phosphate fluids caused a defect in the cholesterol storage pathway of AC and OI cells and to determine the mechanism of action. Female rats received daily oral doses of 0 or 0.4 g/kg TCP in sesame oil vehicle or 1.7 g/kg neat BTP for 40 days. Adrenal glands from both treatment groups and ovaries from TCP-treated rats were heavier than controls. Microscopic and biochemical studies revealed cholesteryl lipidosis composed of CE in the adrenal glands and ovaries in BTP- and TCP-treated rats with the latter group affected most severely. The activity of neutral CE hydrolase (nCEH), an enzyme that converts CE to cholesterol in the uptake and storage pathways, also was inhibited most in the TCP-treated group (97% inhibition compared to that of control). The activity of acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyl transferase, an enzyme that esterifies cholesterol to make CE, was depressed 27% compared to that of control adrenal glands of the TCP group, resulting in elevated intracellular cholesterol levels in AC cells. An inhibition of nCEH in the storage and uptake pathways by triaryl phosphates most likely resulted in the striking accumulation of CE in cytoplasmic lipid droplets of AC and OI cells in F344 rats.
Terephthalic acid at 20 mg/kg/day in lowered serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels in rats. The cholesterol content was lowered in the lipoprotein fractions. The effects of the agents on de novo lipid synthesis showed that similar enzymes were affected in rat liver and small intestinal mucosa cells as when compared to in vitro tissue culture cells from rats and humans, e.g. reduction of acyl CoA cholesterol acyl transferase and elevation of neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase activities suggest that net cholesterol esters deposition in foam cells should be reduced and plaque growth should be slowed. The suppression of LDL receptor binding and degradation by the drug suggest that less apoB lipoproteins are taken up by peripheral tissues. The elevated HDL receptor binding and internalization in the liver suggest that the drug accelerates cholesterol return to the liver. Additional studies show that cholesterol and bile acid secretion in the bile is elevated. However, the bile acids secreted are not lithogenic. Acute toxicity studies show that the agent appears to be safe in rodents. Two observations of increased serum alkaline phosphatase levels and increased liver vacuolation suggest some alteration of hepatic cell morphology, which requires further investigation.
2-Furoic acid was shown to be effective in lowering both serum cholesterol and serum triglyceride levels significantly in rats with an elevation of HDL cholesterol level at 20 mg/kg/day orally. LDL receptor activity was reduced in hepatocytes, aorta foam cells, small intestinal epithelium cells and fibroblasts. HDL receptor activity was elevated in the rat hepatocytes and small intestinal cells. These activities were correlated with inhibition of acyl CoA cholesterol acyl transferase activity. Neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase activity was elevated in rat hepatocytes and human fibroblasts. Thus, 2-furoic acid appears to interfere directly with activity of intracellular enzymes rather than affecting high affinity-mediated lipoprotein membrane receptors. In vivo treatment with 2-furoic acid led to reduction in the liver and small intestine ATP dependent citrate lyase, acetyl CoA synthetase, acyl CoA cholesterol acyl transferase, sn-glycerol 3-phosphate acyl transferase, phosphatidylate phosphohydrolase and heparin induced lipoprotein lipase activities. 2-Furoic acid reduced biliary cholesterol levels but the agent increased bile salts which are lithogenic. Acute toxicity studies in mice suggest that the agent has some hepatic toxicity effects. The LD50 was relatively low at 250 mg/kg IP in mice.
We studied the effect of insulin on HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux from macrophages. The potential involvement of cholesteryl ester hydrolysis and membrane cholesterol transport was also addressed.
Human monocyte-derived THP-1 cells were developed into macrophages. Cholesterol efflux was measured by incubating macrophages, labeled with [³H]-cholesterol, with HDL for 24 h. The cells were treated with insulin (0-500 nM) for 30 min prior to the addition of HDL. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of the effect of insulin, the expressions of neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase (nCEH) and ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC) G1 were analyzed.
Insulin inhibited, in a concentration-dependent manner, HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux from macrophages. Insulin also inhibited the enzyme activity of nCEH and its mRNA and protein expression in cells. Insulin also suppressed the expressions of mRNA and protein for ABCG1.
Insulin inhibits HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux from macrophages, which may result from the suppression of nCEH and ABCG1 expressions. Our findings show part of the potential molecular mechanism of atherogenesis in type 2 diabetes with hyperinsulinemia.
Ritonavir is a protease inhibitor associated with metabolic abnormalities and cardiovascular disease. We have investigated the effects of low-dose ritonavir treatment on gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 10 healthy donors. Results using whole genome Illumina microarrays show that ritonavir modulates a number of genes implicated in lipid metabolism, inflammation and atherosclerosis. These candidate genes are dual specificity phosphatase 1 DUSP1), Kelch domain containing 3 (KLHDC3), neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase 1 (NCEH1) and acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 2 (ACSS2). Validation experiments using quantitative PCR showed that ritonavir (at 100 mg once daily and 100 mg twice daily significantly down-regulated these 4 selected candidate genes in 20 healthy individuals. Lower expression levels of these 4 candidate genes, known to play a critical role in inflammation, lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis, may explain ritonavir adverse effects in patients.
Accumulation of cholesteryl esters (CE) stored as cytoplasmic lipid droplets is the main characteristic of macrophage foam cells that are central to the development of atherosclerotic plaques. Since only unesterified or free cholesterol (FC) can be effluxed from the cells to extracellular cholesterol acceptors, hydrolysis of CE is the obligatory first step in CE mobilization from macrophages. This reaction, catalyzed by neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase (CEH), is increasingly being recognized as the rate-limiting step in FC efflux. CEH, therefore, regulates the process of reverse cholesterol transport and ultimate elimination of cholesterol from the body. In this review, we summarize the earlier controversies surrounding the identity of CEH in macrophages, discuss the characteristics of the various candidates recognized to date and examine their role in mobilizing cellular CE and thus regulating atherogenesis. In addition, physiological requirements to hydrolyze lipid droplet-associated substrate and complexities of interfacial catalysis are also discussed to emphasize the importance of evaluating the biochemical characteristics of candidate enzymes that may be targeted in the future to attenuate atherosclerosis.
Intracellular cholesterol metabolism was reported to modulate amyloid-beta (Abeta) generation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Results presented herein demonstrated that, like brain cells, cultured skin fibroblasts from AD patients contained more cholesterol esters than fibroblasts from healthy subjects. Particularly, Oil Red-O, Nile Red, and filipin staining highlighted higher levels of neutral lipids which responded to inhibitors of acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyl-transferase (ACAT-1), associated with an increase in free cholesterol. ACAT-1 mRNA levels increased significantly in AD fibroblasts, whereas those of sterol regulatory element binding protein-2, neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase, and ATP-binding cassette transporter member 1 were markedly down-regulated. Instead, mRNA levels of low-density lipoprotein receptor, hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, caveolin-1, and amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) were virtually unchanged. Notably, mRNA levels of both beta-site AbetaPP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and neprilysin were significantly down-regulated. An increase in Abeta(40) and Abeta(42) immunostaining and a decrease in BACE1 active form were also found in AD versus control fibroblasts. Altogether, these findings support the hypothesis that the derangement of cholesterol homeostasis is a systemic alteration involving central but also peripheral cells of AD patients, and point to cholesterol ester levels in AD fibroblasts as an additional metabolic hallmark useful in the laboratory and clinical practice.
Cholesterol ester (CE)-laden macrophage foam cells are the hallmark of atherosclerosis, and the hydrolysis of intracellular CE is one of the key steps in foam cell formation. Although hormone-sensitive lipase (LIPE) and cholesterol ester hydrolase (CEH), which is identical to carboxylsterase 1 (CES1, hCE1), were proposed to mediate the neutral CE hydrolase (nCEH) activity in macrophages, recent evidences have suggested the involvement of other enzymes. We have recently reported the identification of a candidate, neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase 1(Nceh1). Here we demonstrate that genetic ablation of Nceh1 promotes foam cell formation and the development of atherosclerosis in mice. We further demonstrate that Nceh1 and Lipe mediate a comparable degree of nCEH activity in macrophages and together account for most of the activity. Mice lacking both Nceh1 and Lipe aggravated atherosclerosis in an additive manner. Thus, Nceh1 is a promising target for the treatment of atherosclerosis.
Neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase (NCEH) accounts for a large part of the nCEH activity in macrophage foam cells, a hallmark of atherosclerosis, but its subcellular localization and structure-function relationship are unknown. Here, we determined subcellular localization, glycosylation, and nCEH activity of a series of NCEH mutants expressed in macrophages. NCEH is a single-membrane-spanning type II membrane protein comprising three domains: N-terminal, catalytic, and lipid-binding domains. The N-terminal domain serves as a type II signal anchor sequence to recruit NCEH to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with its catalytic domain within the lumen. All of the putative N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn(270), Asn(367), and Asn(389)) of NCEH are glycosylated. Glycosylation at Asn(270), which is located closest to the catalytic serine motif, is important for the enzymatic activity. Cholesterol loading by incubation with acetyl-LDL does not change the ER localization of NCEH. In conclusion, NCEH is targeted to the ER of macrophages, where it hydrolyzes CE to deliver cholesterol for efflux out of the cells.
Unstable lipid-rich plaques in atherosclerosis are characterized by the accumulation of macrophage foam cells loaded with cholesterol ester (CE). Although hormone-sensitive lipase and cholesteryl ester hydrolase (CEH) have been proposed to mediate the hydrolysis of CE in macrophages, circumstantial evidence suggests the presence of other enzymes with neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase (nCEH) activity. Here we show that the murine orthologue of KIAA1363, designated as neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase (NCEH), is a microsomal nCEH with high expression in murine and human macrophages. The effect of various concentrations of NaCl on its nCEH activity resembles that on endogenous nCEH activity of macrophages. RNA silencing of NCEH decreases nCEH activity at least by 50%; conversely, its overexpression inhibits the CE formation in macrophages. Immunohistochemistry reveals that NCEH is expressed in macrophage foam cells in atherosclerotic lesions. These data indicate that NCEH is responsible for a major part of nCEH activity in macrophages and may be a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of atherosclerosis.
The authors have previously shown that the growth of cultured fibroblasts obtained from primary pterygia was associated with an increase in cholesterol esterification, suggesting that alterations of cholesterol homeostasis may be involved in the development and progression of this disorder. This investigation was conducted to determine whether antiproliferative agents such as pioglitazone (PIO) and everolimus (EVE) may inhibit proteins involved in the cholesterol ester cycle and the proliferation of pterygium fibroblasts (PF).
Quiescent normal conjunctival fibroblasts and PFs were treated with or without inhibitors of cell proliferation (PIO and EVE) or with inhibitors of cholesterol esterification-progesterone (Pg) and Sandoz compound (SaH)-and then were stimulated to growth by 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Cell proliferation was assessed by counting cells. Trypan blue uptake was used to determine cell viability. mRNA and protein levels were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis, respectively.
PIO and EVE significantly abolished the increase in cholesterol esters, acyl-coenzyme A cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT1), and multidrug resistance protein (MDR1) mRNA observed in growing cells. Each inhibitor upregulated ATP-binding cassette-A1 (ABCA1), neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase (NCEH) mRNA, and caveolin-1 expression in a manner similar to that of specific inhibitors of cholesterol esterification such as Pg and SaH.
Intracellular modifications of cholesterol homeostasis may be relevant to pterygium development. Moreover, antiproliferative agents such as PIO and EVE may represent a potential topical medication in the prevention and inhibition of pterygium growth at an early stage, probably by modulation of cholesterol ester metabolism.
A number of intracellular lipase/esterase have been reported in adipose tissue either by functional assays of activity or through proteomic analysis. In the current work, we have studied the relative expression level of 12 members of the lipase/esterase family that are found in white adipose tissue. We found that the relative mRNA levels of ATGL and HSL are the most abundant, being 2-3 fold greater than TGH or ADPN; whereas other intracellular neutral lipase/esterases were expressed at substantially lower levels. High fat feeding did not alter the mRNA expression levels of most lipase/esterases, but did reduce CGI-58 and WBSCR21. Likewise, rosiglitazone treatment did not alter the mRNA expression levels of most lipase/esterases, but did increase ATGL, TGH, CGI-58 and WBSCR21, while reducing ADPN. WAT from HSL-/- mice showed no compensatory increase in any lipase/esterases, rather mRNA levels of most lipase/esterases were reduced. In contrast, BAT from HSL-/- mice showed an increase in ATGL expression, as well as a decrease in ES-1, APEH and WBSCR21. Analysis of the immunoreactive protein levels of some of the lipases confirmed the results seen with mRNA. In conclusion, these data highlight the complexity of the regulation of the expression of intracellular neutral lipase/esterases involved in lipolysis.
In cerebral amyloidoses, such as Alzheimer's disease, proteolytic processing of the precursor protein is a fundamental mechanism of the disease, since it generates the amyloid protein. However, the putative significance of proteases in extracerebral amyloidoses is less well defined. In this study, we investigated the biological significance of cathepsin (Cath) B, CathK, and CathL in the pathology and pathogenesis of extracerebral amyloidoses by using the murine model of reactive or secondary AA amyloidosis with three different cathepsin-deficient mouse strains. Extracerebral AA amyloid was induced by injecting amyloid-enhancing factor and silver nitrate into CathB(-/-), CathK(-/-), and CathL(-/-) mice. Wild-type mice served as a control. CathK(-/-) mice deposited over 90% more amyloid and CathL(-/-) mice 60% less amyloid than the control (p &lt; 0.0001). The amyloid load in CathB(-/-) mice did not differ from that in wild-type mice. In vitro degradation experiments with recombinant human and murine serum amyloid A (SAA) 1.1 and CathK and CathL showed that CathL generates a large number of differently sized SAA cleavage products. One of these fragments spans the heparin/heparan sulphate binding site and the neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase activating region of SAA. CathK showed only endoproteolytic activity and did not generate any AA amyloid-like peptides. This study provides unequivocal evidence that proteases modulate amyloid load in extracerebral amyloidosis. CathL was identified as an amyloid-promoting and CathK as an amyloid-retarding cysteine protease. CathB may only modulate the primary structure of the amyloid peptide without affecting amyloid load.
Reduction of the lipid burden of atherosclerotic lesion-associated macrophage foam cells is a logical strategy to reduce the plaque volume. Since extracellular cholesterol acceptor-mediated cholesterol efflux is the only recognized mechanism of cholesterol removal from foam cells and this process is rate limited at the level of intracellular cholesterol ester hydrolysis, a reaction catalyzed by neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase (CEH), we examined the hypothesis that CEH overexpression in the human macrophage monocyte/macrophage cell line THP1 results in increased cholesterol efflux, as well as decreased cellular cholesterol ester accumulation. We generated THP1-CEH cells with stable integration of human macrophage CEH cDNA driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. Compared with wild-type THP1 cells (THP1-WT), THP1-CEH cells showed increased CEH mRNA expression and increased CEH activity. Efflux of free or unesterified cholesterol by acetylated LDL-loaded THP1-CEH cells to ApoA-I by an ABCA1-dependent pathway or to HDL by an ABCG1-dependent pathway was significantly higher than that in THP1-WT cells. In addition, THP1-CEH cells accumulated significantly lower amount of esterified cholesterol. CEH overexpression, therefore, not only enhances cholesterol efflux but also reduces cellular accumulation of cholesteryl esters. Taken together, these data provide evidence for evaluating CEH expression in human macrophages as a potential target for attenuation of foam cell formation and regression of atherosclerotic plaques.
The functional roles of neutral lipids in the lung are poorly understood. However, blocking cholesteryl ester and triglyceride metabolism in lysosomal acid lipase gene knockout mice (lal-/-) results in severe pathogenic phenotypes in the lung, including massive neutrophil infiltration, foamy macrophage accumulation, unwanted cell growth, and emphysema. To elucidate the mechanism underlining these pathologies, we performed Affymetrix GeneChip microarray analysis of 1-, 3-, and 6-month-old mice and identified aberrant gene expression that progressed with age. Among changed genes, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-12, apoptosis inhibitor 6 (Api-6), erythroblast transformation-specific domain (Ets) transcription factor family member Spi-C, and oncogene MafB were increased 100-, 70-, 40-, and 10-fold, respectively, in lal-/- lungs versus the wild-type lungs. The pathogenic increases of these molecules occurred primarily in alveolar type II epithelial cells. Transcriptional activities of the MMP-12 and Api-6 promoters were stimulated by Spi-C or MafB in respiratory epithelial cells. Treatment with 9-hydroxyoctadecanoic acids and ciglitazone significantly rescued lal-/- pulmonary inflammation and aberrant gene expression. In addition, both compounds as well as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma inhibited MMP-12 and Api-6 promoter activities. These data suggest that inflammation-triggered cell growth and emphysema during lysosomal acid lipase deficiency are partially caused by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma inactivation.
Hydrolysis of intracellular cholesteryl esters (CEs) represents the first step in the removal of cholesterol from lipid-laden foam cells associated with atherosclerotic lesions. Neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase (CEH) catalyzes this reaction, and we recently cloned the cDNA for the human macrophage CEH and demonstrated increased mobilization of intracellular CE droplets by CEH overexpression. The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that for CE hydrolysis, CEH must become associated with the surface of the cytoplasmic lipid droplets. Our data show the redistribution of CEH from cytosol to lipid droplets upon lipid loading of human THP-1 macrophages. Depletion of triacylglycerol (TG) by incubation with the acyl-CoA synthetase inhibitor Triacsin D had no effect on CEH association with the lipid droplets, suggesting that CEH associates with mixed (CE + TG) as well as TG-depleted CE droplets. However, CEH had 2.5-fold higher activity when mixed droplets were used as substrate in an in vitro assay, consistent with the reported higher cholesterol efflux from cells containing mixed isotropic droplets. Perilipin as well as adipophilin, two lipid droplet-associated proteins, were also present on the lipid droplets in THP-1 macrophages. In conclusion, CEH associates with its intracellular substrate (lipid droplets) and hydrolyzes CE more efficiently from mixed droplets.
The effects of ageing on the metabolism of cholesterol were examined in three different organs (liver, aorta and brain) of 6-, 12- and 24-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats. Ageing was associated with a significant increase in intracellular cholesterol esters in all three organs. Steady state mRNA levels of multidrug resistance protein (MDR) and acylCoA:cholesterol acyl transferase (ACAT), enzymes involved in cholesterol import and esterification, were also increased. By contrast, expression of mRNA for neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase (nCEH) and caveolin-1, proteins involved in cholesterol ester hydrolysis and export, were significantly reduced. Dietary restriction is the only intervention shown to extend lifespan and retard age-related declines in function in mammals. To further explore the possible correlation between changes in cholesterol esterification and ageing, we analysed cholesterol metabolism in liver, aorta, and brain of aged rats exposed to two dietary restriction regimens: intermittent (alternate-day) fasting (IF) and food intake restriction (60% of ad libitum feeding). Both dietary regimens attenuated the age-related changes in cholesterol esters and in the expression of genes involved in cholesterol metabolism. These results provide evidence that distinctive age-associated changes in intracellular cholesterol metabolism occur in rats. Furthermore, these modifications can be partially reversed by dietary restriction, a condition known to affect the ageing process. Age-related changes in cholesterol metabolism may play a role in triggering and/or aggravating senescence-related disorders characterized by altered cholesterol homeostasis.
Site-directed mutagenesis of rat hepatic neutral cytosolic cholesteryl ester hydrolase (rhncCEH) was used to substitute acidic, basic or neutral amino acid residues for Ser506, required for activation by protein kinase A. The substitution of acidic Asp506 resulted in esterase activities with cholesteryl oleate, p-nitrophenylcaprylate (PNPC) and p-nitrophenylacetate (PNPA) equivalent to those of native rhncCEH with Ser506. The substitution of 2 acidic residues (Asp505/506), emulating the 2 negative charges of phosphoserine, resulted in a 10-fold greater cholesterol esterase activity than that of native rhncCEH, similar to the activity of rhncCEH treated with protein kinase A. In contrast to mutants with Ser506, protein kinase A did not increase the specific activities of mutants with Asp505/506. The substitution of basic (Lys506) or neutral (Asn506) residues abolished activity with cholesteryl oleate but not PNPC or PNPA. The substitution of neutral Gln for basic residues Lys496/Arg503 also abolished cholesterol esterase activity but not PNPC- and PNPA-esterase activities. These structure-activity relationships are modeled by homology with a recently reported crystal structure for the homologous human triacylglycerol hydrolase. The results suggest that the cholesterol esterase activity of carboxylesterases is enhanced by interactions between one or more basic residues on helix alpha16 (residues 485-503) and acidic groups at residues 505-506 in the adjacent surface loop.
Hepatic neutral cytosolic cholesteryl ester hydrolase (hncCEH) is a key enzyme in the regulation of hepatic free cholesterol (FC). In examining the effects of over-expression of this enzyme on cholesterol homeostasis, mice were infected with a recombinant adenovirus construct (AdCEH) of the rat hncCEH cDNA driven by the human cytomegalovirus promoter. Cholesteryl esterase and p-nitrophenylcaprylate (PNPC) esterase activities were measured in liver postmitochondrial supernatants at 1, 3, 7, and 11 d after infection with AdCEH or a control virus expressing beta-galactosidase (AdbetaGAL). The PNPC esterase activity of AdCEH mice peaked threefold higher than controls on day 2, declining on subsequent days. In contrast, cholesteryl esterase peaked eightfold higher than controls on day 3, indicating a shift in substrate selectivity of hncCEH. Hepatic FC peaked at 144% of controls, 7 d postinfection. The mRNAs for cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase, sterol 27-hydroxylase, and HMG-CoA reductase decreased to 47, 46, and 58% of controls, respectively, on day 7, coinciding with peak FC concentrations. Coinciding with increased cholesteryl esterase activity, hepatic esterified cholesterol dropped precipitously from day 3 onward, to 11% of controls by day 11. Hepatic TAG levels also declined, consistent with the reported TAG lipase activity of hncCEH. These results demonstrate elevation of FC and depletion of cholesteryl esters by over-expression of hncCEH, which were resistant to compensatory responses by other enzymes of cholesterol homeostasis.
The related disorders of obesity and diabetes are increasing to epidemic proportions. The role of neutral lipid storage and hydrolysis, and hence the adipocyte, is central to understanding this phenomenon. The adipocyte holds the major source of stored energy in the body in the form of triacylglycerols (TAG). It has been known for over 35 years that the breakdown of TAG and release of free (unesterified) fatty acids and glycerol from fat tissue can be regulated by a cAMP-mediated process. However, beyond the initial signaling cascade, the mechanistic details of this lipolytic reaction have remained unclear. Work in recent years has revealed that both hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), generally thought to be the rate-limiting enzyme, and perilipin, a lipid droplet surface protein, are required for optimal lipid storage and fatty acid release. There are multiple perilipin proteins encoded by mRNA splice variants of a single perilipin gene. The perilipin proteins are polyphosphorylated by protein kinase A and phosphorylation is necessary for translocation of HSL to the lipid droplet and enhanced lipolysis. Hence, the surface of the lipid storage droplet has emerged as a central site of regulation of lipolysis. This review will focus on adipocyte lipolysis with emphasis on hormone signal transduction, lipolytic enzymes, the lipid storage droplet, and fatty acid release from the adipocyte.
Hydrolysis of triglycerides is central to energy homeostasis in white adipose tissue (WAT). Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) was previously felt to mediate all lipolysis in WAT. Surprisingly, HSL-deficient mice show active HSL-independent lipolysis, suggesting that other lipase(s) also mediate triglyceride hydrolysis. To clarify this, we used functional proteomics to detect non-HSL lipase(s) in mouse WAT. After cell fractionation of intraabdominal WAT, most non-HSL neutral lipase activity is localized in the 100,000 x g infranatant and fat cake fractions. By oleic acid-linked agarose chromatography of infranatant followed by elution in a 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid gradient, we identified two peaks of esterase activity using p-nitrophenyl butyrate as a substrate. One of the peaks contained most of the lipase activity. In the corresponding fractions, gel permeation chromatography and SDS-PAGE, followed by tandem mass spectrometric analysis of excised Coomassie Blue-stained peptides, revealed carboxylesterase 3 (triacylglycerol hydrolase (TGH); EC 3.1.1.1). TGH is also the principle lipase of WAT fat cake extracts. Partially purified WAT TGH had lipase activity as well as lesser but detectable neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity. Western blotting of subcellular fractions of WAT and confocal microscopy of fibroblasts following in vitro adipocytic differentiation are consistent with a distribution of TGH to endoplasmic reticulum, cytosol, and the lipid droplet. TGH is responsible for a major part of non-HSL lipase activity in WAT in vitro and may mediate some or all HSL-independent lipolysis in adipocytes.
We previously reported decreased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in hormone-sensitive lipase-null mice (HSL(-/-)), both in vivo and in vitro. The focus of the current study was to gain further insight into the signaling role and regulation of lipolysis in islet tissue. The effect of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) on GSIS was also studied, as GLP-1 could augment GSIS via protein kinase A activation of HSL and lipolysis. Freshly isolated islets from fasted and fed male HSL(-/-) and wild-type (HSL(+/+)) mice were studied at ages 4 and 7 months. Neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity was markedly reduced in islets from both 4- and 7-month-old male HSL(-/-) mice, whereas a marked deficiency in triglyceride lipase activity became evident only in the older mice. The deficiencies in lipase activities were associated with higher islet triglyceride content and reduced lipolysis at basal glucose levels. Lipolysis was stimulated by high glucose in islets of both wild-type and HSL-null mice. Severe deficiencies in GSIS were found, but only in islets from 7-month-old, fasted, male HSL(-/-) mice. GSIS was less affected in 4-month-old fasted male HSL(-/-) mice and not reduced in female mice. Exogenous delivery of free fatty acids (FFAs) rescued GSIS, supporting the view that the lack of endogenous FFA supply for lipid-signaling processes in HSL(-/-) mice was responsible for the loss of GSIS. GLP-1 also rescued GSIS in HSL(-/-) mice, indicating that signaling via HSL is not a major pathway for its incretin effect. Thus, the secretory phenotype of HSL-null mice is gender dependent, increases with age, and is influenced by the nutritional state. Under most circumstances, the major determinant of lipolytic flux in the beta-cell involves an enzyme(s) other than HSL that is acutely activated by glucose. Our results support the view that the availability of endogenous FFA through HSL and an additional enzyme(s) is involved in providing lipid moieties for beta-cell signaling for secretion in response to glucose.
Antarctic fishes of the suborder Notothenioidei characteristically possess large stores of neutral lipids that have been shown to be important both in conferring buoyant lift and as a caloric resource for energy metabolism. Previous work has established that the aerobic energy metabolism of Antarctic fish is fueled predominantly by the catabolism of fatty acids, with the catabolic machinery displaying a preference for the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids. The composition of the fatty acids released from adipose tissue of Antarctic fish during lipolysis, however, has not previously been demonstrated. Employing a substrate competition assay, we have characterized the substrate specificity of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) from adipose tissue of the Antarctic fish Trematomus newnesi. Rates of oleic acid release from radiolabeled triolein were quantified in the presence and absence of a nonradiolabeled cosubstrate. Polyunsaturated species of triacylglycerols (TAGs) containing 18:2 or 20:4 depressed rates of oleate release by 70-75% below control values. Most of the molecular species of TAG containing monoenoic fatty acids (i.e. those containing 14:1, 16:1 or 20:1) had no significant effect on rates of oleate release. By contrast, oleate release from triolein was actually stimulated (by 2-4-fold) by both saturated species of TAG (i.e. those containing 14:0, 16:0 and 18:0) and those possessing long-chain (22:1 and 24:1) monoenes (by 1.2-1.5-fold). Thus, the rank order of substrate preference for adipose tissue HSL was: polyunsaturates &gt; monoenes &gt; saturates. Degree of fatty acid unsaturation had a more marked effect on rates of hydrolysis than did fatty acid chain length. In addition, the enzyme displayed a preference for the hydrolysis of sn-1,2 rather than sn-1,3 diacylglycerols. These data indicate that the substrate specificity of adipose tissue HSL may be an important factor in determining which fatty acids are mobilized during stimulated lipolysis and which are made available for catabolism by other tissues of Antarctic fishes. Our data further suggest that TAGs containing some saturated fatty acids may be sufficiently poor substrates for catabolism by HSL to explain their disproportionate accumulation in adipose tissue. Such a mechanism could also contribute to the ontogenetic accumulation of fats that has been reported as an underlying basis for the positive correlation of buoyancy with increasing body mass in this group.
Although described initially as an intracellular adipocyte-specific triacylglycerol lipase, it is now clear that HSL (hormone-sensitive lipase) is expressed in multiple tissues and plays a number of roles in lipid metabolism, including that of a neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase. The major isoform is a single polypeptide with a molecular mass of approx. 84 kDa and which comprises three major domains: a catalytic domain, a regulatory domain encoding several phosphorylation sites and an N-terminal domain involved in protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions. The activity of HSL is regulated acutely by several mechanisms, including reversible phosphorylation by a number of different protein kinases, translocation to different sites within the cell and interaction with a number of proteins, some of which may serve to direct the inhibitory products of HSL away from the protein. It is also apparent from work with HSL null mice that more than one enzyme species may be classified as a hormone-sensitive lipase. The possible presence of HSL in macrophages remains controversial, and the role of the protein in pancreatic beta-cells has yet to be fully elucidated. Altered expression of HSL in different cell types may be associated with a number of pathological states, including obesity, atherosclerosis and Type II diabetes.
We previously reported that intracellular free cholesterol at physiological concentrations regulates the activity of neutral cholesterol esterase (N-CEase) in macrophages. The objective of the present study is to investigate whether the regulation of N-CEase by cholesterol is generally observed in other types of cells such as adipocytes with high activity of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), the same gene product as N-CEase. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were cultured with and without cholesterol (1-30 microg/mL) or 25-hydroxycholesterol (0.1-10 microg/mL), and changes in the N-CEase activity, expression of HSL mRNA, and protein were examined. Incubation (24 h) of cells with cholesterol did not change N-CEase activity, but incubation with 25-hydroxycholesterol decreased the activity in a concentration-dependent manner by 24 (24 h) and 54% (36 h). Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR indicated that 25-hydroxycholesterol (10 microg/mL) did not influence expression of HSL mRNA. However, Western blot analysis showed that this sterol reduced HSL protein by 72 (24 h) and by 93% (36 h), respectively. It was concluded that sterol-mediated regulation of HSL/N-CEase occurs not only in macrophages but also in adipocytes, and regulation appears to occur not at a transcriptional level but by a post-transcriptional process. Sterol-mediated proteolysis may be involved in the loss of HSL protein.
Serum amyloid A 2.1 (SAA2.1) suppresses ACAT and stimulates cholesteryl ester hydrolase (CEH) activities in cholesterol-laden macrophages, and in the presence of a cholesterol transporter and an extracellular acceptor, there is a marked increase in the rate of cholesterol export in culture and in vivo. The stimulation of CEH activity by SAA2.1 is not affected by chloroquine, suggesting that it operates on neutral CEH rather than the lysosomal form. With liposomes containing individual peptides of SAA2.1, residues 1-20 inhibit ACAT activity, residues 74-103 stimulate CEH activity, and each of residues 1-20 and 74-103 promotes macrophage cholesterol efflux to HDL in culture media. In combination, these peptides exhibit a profound effect, so that 55-70% of cholesterol is exported to media HDL in 24 h. The effect is also demonstrable in vivo. [3H]cholesterol-laden macrophages injected intravenously into mice were allowed to establish themselves for 24 h. Thereafter, the mice received a single intravenous injection of liposomes containing intact SAA1.1, SAA2.1, peptides composed of SAA2.1 residues 1-20, 21-50, 51-80, 74-103, or SAA1.1 residues 1-20. Only liposomes containing intact SAA2.1 or its residues 1-20 or 74-103 promoted the efflux of cholesterol in vivo. A single injection of each of the active peptides is effective in promoting cholesterol efflux in vivo for at least 4 days.
In two long-term studies of dietary-cholesterol-induced atherosclerosis lesions in rhesus monkeys, we determined the fatty acid composition of cholesteryl esters in the arterial intima-media preparations. In the first study (2-year study) monkeys were fed an atherogenic diet for 2 years; in the second study, (5-year study), monkeys were fed the atherogenic diet for about 5.4 years. Dietary cholesterol was removed from regressed animals and the regression periods in the 2-year study were 30 and 52 weeks and in the 5-year study were 20, 30, 52, 101, and 191 weeks. In both studies in thoracic and abdominal aortic segments, the percent removal of 18:2 cholesteryl ester (CE) was small, whereas percent removal of 18:1 CE and other CEs was much higher. We postulate that 18:2 CE is not hydrolyzed to the extent comparable to 18:1 and other CEs in lesions. Perhaps 18:2 CE is not a preferred substrate for arterial neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase.
Acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1) esterifies free cholesterol to cholesteryl esters (CE), which are subsequently hydrolyzed by neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase 1 (NCEH1). The elimination of ACAT1 in vitro reduces the amounts of CE accumulated in Nceh1-deficient macrophages. The present study aimed at examining whether the loss of ACAT1 attenuates atherosclerosis which is aggravated by the loss of NCEH1 in vivo.
Low density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr)-deficient mice were transplanted with bone marrow from wild-type mice and mice lacking ACAT1, NCEH1, or both. The four types of mice were fed a high-cholesterol diet and, then, were examined for atherosclerosis.
The cross-sectional lesion size of the recipients of Nceh1-deficient bone marrow was 1.6-fold larger than that of the wild-type bone marrow. The lesions of the recipients of Nceh1-deficient bone marrow were enriched with MOMA2-positive macrophages compared with the lesions of the recipients of the wild-type bone marrow. The size and the macrophage content of the lesions of the recipients of bone marrow lacking both ACAT1 and NCEH1 were significantly smaller than the recipients of the Nceh1-deficient bone marrow, indicating that the loss of ACAT1 decreases the excess CE in the Nceh1-deficient lesions. The collagen-rich and/or mucin-rich areas and en face lesion size were enlarged in the recipients of the Acat1－/－ bone marrow compared with those of the recipients of the WT bone marrow.
The loss of ACAT1 in bone marrow-derived cells attenuates atherosclerosis, which is aggravated by the loss of NCEH1, corroborating the in vitro functions of ACAT1 (formation of CE) and NCEH1 (hydrolysis of CE).
Hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) is a neutral lipase that preferentially catalyzes the hydrolysis of diacylglycerol contributing to triacylglycerol breakdown in the adipose tissue. HSL has been implicated to play a role in tumor cachexia, a debilitating syndrome characterized by progressive loss of adipose tissue. Consequently, pharmacological inhibitors of HSL have been proposed for the treatment of cancer-associated cachexia. In the present study we used the conditional KrasG12D (KC) mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with a deficiency in HSL to determine the impact of HSL suppression on the development of PDAC.
KC;Hsl+/+ and KC;Hsl-/- mice were fed standard rodent chow for 20 weeks. At sacrifice, the incidence of PDAC was determined and inflammation in the mesenteric adipose tissue and pancreas was assessed histologically and by immunofluorescence. To determine statistical significance, ANOVA and two-tailed Student's t-tests were performed. To compare PDAC incidence, a two-sided Fisher's exact test was used.
Compared to KC;Hsl+/+ mice, KC;Hsl-/- mice gained similar weight and displayed adipose tissue and pancreatic inflammation. In addition, KC;Hsl-/- mice had reduced levels of plasma insulin and leptin. Importantly, the increased adipose tissue and pancreatic inflammation was associated with a significant increase in PDAC incidence in KC;Hsl-/- mice.
HSL deficiency is associated with adipose tissue and pancreatic inflammation and accelerates PDAC development in the KC mouse model.
The NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome plays an important role in the development of atherosclerosis. The activated NLRP3 inflammasome has been reported to promote macrophage foam cell formation, but not all studies have obtained the same result, and how NLRP3 inflammasome is involved in the formation of foam cells remains elusive. We used selective NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors and NLRP3-deficient THP-1 cells to assess the effect of NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition on macrophage foam cell formation, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) uptake, esterification, and cholesterol efflux, as well as the expression of associated proteins. Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome attenuated foam cell formation, diminished ox-LDL uptake, and promoted cholesterol efflux from THP-1 macrophages. Moreover, it downregulated CD36, acyl coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase-1 and neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase expression; upregulated ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) expression; but had no effect on the expression of scavenger receptor class A and ATP-binding cassette transporter G1. Collectively, our findings show that inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome decreases foam cell formation of THP-1 macrophages via suppression of ox-LDL uptake and enhancement of cholesterol efflux, which may be due to downregulation of CD36 expression and upregulation of ABCA1 and SR-BI expression, respectively.
Variations in the gene LDAH (C2ORF43), which encodes lipid droplet-associated hydrolase (LDAH), are among few loci associated with human prostate cancer. Homologs of LDAH have been identified as proteins of lipid droplets (LDs). LDs are cellular organelles that store neutral lipids, such as triacylglycerols and sterol esters, as precursors for membrane components and as reservoirs of metabolic energy. LDAH is reported to hydrolyze cholesterol esters and to be important in macrophage cholesterol ester metabolism. Here, we confirm that LDAH is localized to LDs in several model systems. We generated a murine model in which Ldah is disrupted but found no evidence for a major function of LDAH in cholesterol ester or triacylglycerol metabolism in vivo, nor a role in energy or glucose metabolism. Our data suggest that LDAH is not a major cholesterol ester hydrolase, and an alternative metabolic function may be responsible for its possible effect on development of prostate cancer.
Psoriasis is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease, which is associated with a high risk of developing systemic comorbidities, such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus. However, the mechanistic links between psoriatic skin inflammation and systemic comorbidities remain largely unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are recently discovered gene regulators that play important roles in psoriasis skin inflammation. In this study we aimed to explore whether the skin inflammation in psoriasis affects miRNA expression of the underlying subcutaneous adipose tissue and whether this may be a link between psoriasis and comorbidities. To this end, we compared the miRNA expression profile of subcutaneous adipose tissue underneath lesional and nonlesional psoriatic skin. We further validated the differential expression of several miRNAs and characterized their expression patterns in different cell types present in subcutaneous adipose tissue. We focused on miR-26b-5p, which was highly up-regulated in subcutaneous adipose tissue underneath lesional psoriasis skin. We showed that it targets and down-regulates neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase 1, an enzyme essential for cholesterol efflux, in monocytes/macrophages, adipocytes, vascular endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. We conclude that this miRNA may serve as a mechanistic link between psoriatic skin inflammation and its systemic comorbidities. 
The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is a ubiquitously expressed cell surface receptor that protects from intracellular cholesterol accumulation. However, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here we show that the extracellular (α) chain of LRP1 mediates TGFβ-induced enhancement of Wnt5a, which limits intracellular cholesterol accumulation by inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis and by promoting cholesterol export. Moreover, we demonstrate that the cytoplasmic (β) chain of LRP1 suffices to limit cholesterol accumulation in LRP1(-/-) cells. Through binding of Erk2 to the second of its carboxyl-terminal NPXY motifs, LRP1 β-chain positively regulates the expression of ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and of neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase (NCEH1). These results highlight the unexpected functions of LRP1 and the canonical Wnt5a pathway and new therapeutic potential in cholesterol-associated disorders including cardiovascular diseases. 
Omentin-1, a novel adipocytokine expressed in visceral fat tissue, is negatively correlated with obesity, insulin resistance, and stable coronary artery disease (CAD). However, there have been no previous reports regarding the effects of omentin-1 on atherogenesis.
This study was performed to evaluate the atheroprotective effects of omentin-1 on human monocyte-derived macrophages, human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) in vitro, and aortic lesions in Apoe(-/-) mice in vivo. The histological expression of omentin-1 in coronary artery lesions and epicardial adipose tissues and its plasma levels were compared between CAD and non-CAD patients. Omentin-1 was abundantly expressed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, macrophages, HASMCs, and human coronary artery SMCs in vitro. Omentin-1 promoted anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype during differentiation of human monocytes into macrophages. Omentin-1 suppressed oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced foam cell formation associated with down-regulation of CD36, scavenger receptor class A, and acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase-1 and up-regulation of neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase in human macrophages. Omentin-1 suppressed angiotensin II-induced migration and platelet-derived growth factor-BB-induced proliferation, and collagen-1 and -3 expression in HASMCs. Four-week infusion of omentin-1 into Apoe(-/-) mice retarded the development of aortic atherosclerotic lesions with reduced contents of monocytes/macrophages, SMCs, and collagen fibres along with peritoneal M2-activated macrophages with inflammasome down-regulation and lowered plasma total cholesterol levels. Omentin-1 levels were markedly reduced in coronary endothelium and epicardial fat but increased in plasma and atheromatous plaques (macrophages/SMCs) in CAD patients compared with non-CAD patients.
This study provided the first evidence that omentin-1 may serve as a novel therapeutic target for atherosclerosis and CAD.
Alterations in the expression and activity of the transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (ppargc1a or PGC-1α) have been reported in multiple movement disorders, yet it is unclear how a lack of PGC-1α impacts transcription and function of the cerebellum, a region with high PGC-1α expression. We show here that mice lacking PGC-1α exhibit ataxia in addition to the previously described deficits in motor coordination. Using q-RT-PCR in cerebellar homogenates from PGC-1α(-/-) mice, we measured expression of 37 microarray-identified transcripts upregulated by PGC-1α in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells with neuroanatomical overlap with PGC-1α or parvalbumin (PV), a calcium buffer highly expressed by Purkinje cells. We found significant reductions in transcripts with synaptic (complexin1, Cplx1; Pacsin2), structural (neurofilament heavy chain, Nefh), and metabolic (isocitrate dehydrogenase 3a, Idh3a; neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase 1, Nceh1; pyruvate dehydrogenase alpha 1, Pdha1; phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase, Phyh; ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase, Rieske iron-sulfur polypeptide 1, Uqcrfs1) functions. Using conditional deletion of PGC-1α in PV-positive neurons, we determined that 50% of PGC-1α expression and a reduction in a subset of these transcripts could be explained by its concentration in PV-positive neuronal populations in the cerbellum. To determine whether there were functional consequences associated with these changes, we conducted stereological counts and spike rate analysis in Purkinje cells, a cell type rich in PV, from PGC-1α(-/-) mice. We observed a significant loss of Purkinje cells by 6 weeks of age, and the remaining Purkinje cells exhibited a 50% reduction in spike rate. Together, these data highlight the complexity of PGC-1α's actions in the central nervous system and suggest that dysfunction in multiple cell types contribute to motor deficits in the context of PGC-1α deficiency. 
Accumulating evidence strongly implicates the transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) in the pathophysiology of multiple neurological disorders, but the downstream gene targets of PGC-1α in the brain have remained enigmatic. Previous data demonstrate that PGC-1α is primarily concentrated in inhibitory neurons and that PGC-1α is required for the expression of the interneuron-specific Ca(2+)-binding protein parvalbumin (PV) throughout the cortex. To identify other possible transcriptional targets of PGC-1α in neural tissue, we conducted a microarray on neuroblastoma cells overexpressing PGC-1α, mined results for genes with physiological relevance to interneurons, and measured cortical gene and protein expression of these genes in mice with underexpression and overexpression of PGC-1α. We observed bidirectional regulation of novel PGC-1α-dependent transcripts spanning synaptic [synaptotagmin 2 (Syt2) and complexin 1 (Cplx1)], structural [neurofilament heavy chain (Nefh)], and metabolic [neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase 1 (Nceh1), adenylate kinase 1 (Ak1), inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase J (Inpp5j), ATP synthase mitochondrial F1 complex O subunit (Atp5o), phytanol-CoA-2hydroxylase (Phyh), and ATP synthase mitrochondrial F1 complex α subunit 1 (Atp5a1)] functions. The neuron-specific genes Syt2, Cplx1, and Nefh were developmentally upregulated in an expression pattern consistent with that of PGC-1α and were expressed in cortical interneurons. Conditional deletion of PGC-1α in PV-positive neurons significantly decreased cortical transcript expression of these genes, promoted asynchronous GABA release, and impaired long-term memory. Collectively, these data demonstrate that PGC-1α is required for normal PV-positive interneuron function and that loss of PGC-1α in this interneuron subpopulation could contribute to cortical dysfunction in disease states.
Cholesterol cycles between free cholesterol (unesterified) found predominantly in membranes and cholesteryl esters (CEs) stored in cytoplasmic lipid droplets. Only free cholesterol is effluxed from macrophages via ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters to extracellular acceptors. Carboxylesterase 1 (CES1), proposed to hydrolyze CEs, is inactivated by oxon metabolites of organophosphorus pesticides and by the lipid electrophile 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE). We assessed the ability of these compounds to reduce cholesterol efflux from foam cells. Human THP-1 macrophages were loaded with [(3)H]-cholesterol/acetylated LDL and then allowed to equilibrate to enable [(3)H]-cholesterol to distribute into its various cellular pools. The cholesterol-engorged cells were then treated with toxicants in the absence of cholesterol acceptors for 24 h, followed by a 24 h efflux period in the presence of toxicant. A concentration-dependent reduction in [(3)H]-cholesterol efflux via ABCA1 (up to 50%) was found for paraoxon (0.1-10 μM), whereas treatment with HNE had no effect. A modest reduction in [(3)H]-cholesterol efflux via ABCG1 (25%) was found after treatment with either paraoxon or chlorpyrifos oxon (10 μM each) but not HNE. No difference in efflux rates was found after treatments with either paraoxon or HNE when the universal cholesterol acceptor 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum was used. When the re-esterification arm of the CE cycle was disabled in foam cells, paraoxon treatment increased CE levels, suggesting the neutral CE hydrolysis arm of the cycle had been inhibited by the toxicant. However, paraoxon also partially inhibited lysosomal acid lipase, which generates cholesterol for efflux, and reduced the expression of ABCA1 protein. Paradoxically, silencing CES1 expression in macrophages did not affect the percent of [(3)H]-cholesterol efflux. However, CES1 mRNA knockdown markedly reduced cholesterol uptake by macrophages, with SR-A and CD36 mRNA reduced 3- and 4-fold, respectively. Immunoblots confirmed SR-A and CD36 protein downregulation. Together, these results suggest that toxicants, e.g., oxons, may interfere with macrophage cholesterol homeostasis/metabolism. 
Cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD) results from loss-of-function mutations in LIPA, the gene that encodes lysosomal acid lipase (LAL). Hepatomegaly and deposition of esterified cholesterol (EC) in multiple organs ensue. The present studies quantitated rates of synthesis, absorption, and disposition of cholesterol, and whole body cholesterol pool size in a mouse model of CESD. In 50-day-old lal(-/-) and matching lal(+/+) mice fed a low-cholesterol diet, whole animal cholesterol content equalled 210 and 50 mg, respectively, indicating that since birth the lal(-/-) mice sequestered cholesterol at an average rate of 3.2 mg·day(-1)·animal(-1). The proportion of the body sterol pool contained in the liver of the lal(-/-) mice was 64 vs. 6.3% in their lal(+/+) controls. EC concentrations in the liver, spleen, small intestine, and lungs of the lal(-/-) mice were elevated 100-, 35-, 15-, and 6-fold, respectively. In the lal(-/-) mice, whole liver cholesterol synthesis increased 10.2-fold, resulting in a 3.2-fold greater rate of whole animal sterol synthesis compared with their lal(+/+) controls. The rate of cholesterol synthesis in the lal(-/-) mice exceeded that in the lal(+/+) controls by 3.7 mg·day(-1)·animal(-1). Fractional cholesterol absorption and fecal bile acid excretion were unchanged in the lal(-/-) mice, but their rate of neutral sterol excretion was 59% higher than in their lal(+/+) controls. Thus, in this model, the continual expansion of the body sterol pool is driven by the synthesis of excess cholesterol, primarily in the liver. Despite the severity of their disease, the median life span of the lal(-/-) mice was 355 days. 
An excess of cholesterol and/or oxysterols induces apoptosis in macrophages, contributing to the development of advanced atherosclerotic lesions. In foam cells, these sterols are stored in esterified forms, which are hydrolyzed by two enzymes: neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase 1 (Nceh1) and hormone-sensitive lipase (Lipe). A deficiency in either enzyme leads to accelerated growth of atherosclerotic lesions in mice. However, it is poorly understood how the esterification and hydrolysis of sterols are linked to apoptosis. Remarkably, Nceh1-deficient thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages (TGEMs), but not Lipe-deficient TGEMs, were more susceptible to apoptosis induced by oxysterols, particularly 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC), and incubation with 25-HC caused massive accumulation of 25-HC ester in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) due to its defective hydrolysis, thereby activating ER stress signaling such as induction of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-homologous protein (CHOP). These changes were nearly reversed by inhibition of ACAT1. In conclusion, deficiency of Nceh1 augments 25-HC-induced ER stress and subsequent apoptosis in TGEMs. In addition to reducing the cholesteryl ester content of foam cells, Nceh1 may protect against the pro-apoptotic effect of oxysterols and modulate the development of atherosclerosis. 
Hydrolysis of intracellular cholesteryl ester (CE) is the rate-limiting step in the efflux of cholesterol from macrophage foam cells. In mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPMs), this process is thought to involve several enzymes: hormone-sensitive lipase (Lipe), carboxylesterase 3 (Ces3), neutral CE hydrolase 1 (Nceh1). However, there is some disagreement over the relative contributions of these enzymes. To solve this problem, we first compared the abilities of several compounds to inhibit the hydrolysis of CE in cells overexpressing Lipe, Ces3, or Nceh1. Cells overexpressing Ces3 had negligible neutral CE hydrolase activity. We next examined the effects of these inhibitors on the hydrolysis of CE and subsequent cholesterol trafficking in MPMs. CE accumulation was increased by a selective inhibitor of Nceh1, paraoxon, and two nonselective inhibitors of Nceh1, (+)-AS115 and (-)-AS115, but not by two Lipe-selective inhibitors, orlistat and 76-0079. Paraoxon inhibited cholesterol efflux to apoA-I or HDL, while 76-0079 did not. These results suggest that Nceh1 plays a dominant role over Lipe in the hydrolysis of CE and subsequent cholesterol efflux in MPMs. 
SMP-028 is a drug candidate developed for the treatment of asthma. In a 13-week repeated dose toxicity study of SMP-028 in rats and monkeys, differences of endocrine toxicological events between rats and monkeys were observed. In rats, these toxicological events mainly consisted of pathological changes in the adrenal, testis, ovary, and the other endocrine-related organs. On the other hand, in monkeys, no toxicological events were observed. The goal of this study is to try to understand the reason why only rats, but not monkeys, showed toxicological events following treatment with SMP-028 and to eventually predict the possible toxicological effect of this compound on human endocrine organs. Our results show that SMP-028 inhibits neutral cholesterol esterase more strongly than other steroidogenic enzymes in rats. Although SMP-028 also inhibits monkeys and human neutral cholesterol esterase, this inhibition is much weaker than that of rat neutral cholesterol esterase. These results indicate (1) that the difference in endocrine toxicological events between rats and monkeys is mainly due to inhibition of steroidogenesis by SMP-028 in rats, not in monkeys, and (2) that SMP-028 may not affect steroidogenesis in humans and therefore might cause no endocrine toxicological events in clinical studies. 
We determined growth rates, cholesterol esterification and mRNA levels for caveolin-1 (Cav-1), neutral cholesterol esters hydrolase (n-CEH) and ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCA-1), in quiescent and growth-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and intimal vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from blood and primary atherosclerotic plaques, respectively. These cells were cultured in the presence or absence of the mTOR inhibitor 40-O-(2-hydroxyethyl) rapamycin (RAD).
The rate of cell proliferation was determined by 3H-thymidine incorporation into DNA and that of lipid metabolism by utilizing 14C-acetate and 14C-oleate as precursors. Lipid deposit in the vascular cells was evaluated by Oil Red O staining and lipid mass by thin layer chromatography-linked enzymatic assay.
Growth stimulation of PBMCs and VSMCs caused a rapid increase in intracellular cholesterol esterification and an accumulation of cholesterol esters (CEs) accompanied by a reduction of free cholesterol (FC) and Cav-1, ABCA-1 and n-CEH mRNAs. RAD reduced intracellular lipid accumulation in growth-stimulated cells and also increased expression of Cav-1, n-CEH and ABCA-1 genes.
Collectively, these data provide evidence that the determination of CEs in PBMCs may be an easy prescreening test to identify subjects at risk for vascular proliferative disease and that FC, CE, Cav-1, n-CEH and ABCA-1 may be suitable targets for antiproliferative therapies.
Lipolytic breakdown of endogenous lipid pools in pancreatic beta cells contributes to glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and is thought to be mediated by acute activation of neutral lipases in the amplification pathway. Recently it has been shown in other cell types that endogenous lipid can be metabolised by autophagy, and this lipophagy is catalysed by lysosomal acid lipase (LAL). This study aimed to elucidate a role for LAL and lipophagy in pancreatic beta cells.
We employed pharmacological and/or genetic inhibition of autophagy and LAL in MIN6 cells and primary islets. Insulin secretion following inhibition was measured using RIA. Lipid accumulation was assessed by MS and confocal microscopy (to visualise lipid droplets) and autophagic flux was analysed by western blot.
Insulin secretion was increased following chronic (≥ 8 h) inhibition of LAL. This was more pronounced with glucose than with non-nutrient stimuli and was accompanied by augmentation of neutral lipid species. Similarly, following inhibition of autophagy in MIN6 cells, the number of lipid droplets was increased and GSIS was potentiated. Inhibition of LAL or autophagy in primary islets also increased insulin secretion. This augmentation of GSIS following LAL or autophagy inhibition was dependent on the acute activation of neutral lipases.
Our data suggest that lysosomal lipid degradation, using LAL and potentially lipophagy, contributes to neutral lipid turnover in beta cells. It also serves as a constitutive negative regulator of GSIS by depletion of substrate for the non-lysosomal neutral lipases that are activated acutely by glucose.
p38 MAPK has been strongly implicated in the development of atherosclerosis, but its role in cholesterol ester accumulation in macrophages and formation of foam cells, an early step in the development of atherosclerosis, has not been investigated. We addressed this issue and made some brand new observations. First, elevated intracellular cholesterol level induced by the exposure to LDL-activated p38 MAPK and activation of p38 MAPK with anisomycin increased the ratio of cholesterol esters over free cholesterol, whereas inhibition of p38 MAPK with SB203580 or siRNA reduced the LDL loading-induced intracellular accumulation of free cholesterol and cholesterol esters in macrophages. Second, exposure to LDL cholesterol inhibited autophagy in macrophages, and inhibition of autophagy with 3-methyladenine increased intracellular accumulation of cholesterol (free cholesterol and cholesterol esters), whereas activation of autophagy with rapamycin decreased intracellular accumulation of free cholesterol and cholesterol esters induced by the exposure to LDL cholesterol. Third, LDL cholesterol loading-induced inhibition of autophagy was prevented by blockade of p38 MAPK with SB203580 or siRNA. Neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase was co-localized with autophagosomes. Finally, LDL cholesterol loading and p38 activation suppressed expression of the key autophagy gene, ulk1, in macrophages. Together, our results provide brand new insight about cholesterol ester accumulation in macrophages and foam cell formation.
