<b> 'The' levels of 6 'ß-,' 7 'a-,' and 11 'ß-hydroxymetabolites' of androgens and corticoids were significantly</b> increased in women with preeclampsia.    'In' 'addition,' the levels of 'oxysterols,' including 7 'a-,' 7 'ß-,' 4 'ß-,' 20 'a-,' 24 'S-,' and 27-'hydroxycholesterol,' were markedly 'higher,' while the levels of 16 'a-OH-DHEA,' 16 'a-OH-androstenedione,' and cholesterol were significantly decreased<b> in patients</b>.    1<b>) </b>, the activation of 20, 22-desmolase ( a cholesterol 'side-chain' cleavage 'enzyme)' by 'CYP11A1' ( 'P&lt;0'.   <b> 'In' 'particular,' an</b> increased<b> oxysterols ( 'induction&gt;2'</b>.   <b> 'Our' metabolic profiling</b> suggests the 'CYP-mediated' alterations in steroid metabolism and hydroxylation in 'pregnancy-induced' hypertension.    'In' this 'work,' we show that 'LRH-1'<b> transcription</b> is activated up to 30-fold in human pancreatic cancer cells compared to normal pancreatic ductal epithelium.   <b> 'This' activation correlates with markedly</b> increased 'LRH-1' protein expression in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas in vivo.    'The' inhibition is tracked in part to the attenuation of the 'receptor\'s' transcriptional targets<b> controlling cell 'growth,' 'proliferation,' and differentiation</b>.   <b> 'Herein,' we demonstrate that 'LRH-1' is</b> expressed in 'islets,' including 'β-cells,' and that transcript levels are modulated by 17 'β-estradiol' through the estrogen receptor ( 'ER)α' but not 'ERβ' signaling pathway.    'Adenoviral-mediated' overexpression of 'LRH-1' in human islets did not alter proliferation but conferred<b> protection against cytokines and 'streptozotocin-induced' apoptosis</b>.    'Expression' levels of the cell cycle<b> genes</b> cyclin 'D1' and cyclin 'E1' as well as the antiapoptotic gene 'bcl-xl' were unaltered in 'LRH-1' expressing islets.   <b> 'We'</b> postulate that this effect is mediated through increased glucocorticoid production that blunts the 'pro-inflammatory' response of islets.   <b> 'Chenodeoxycholic' acid</b> repressed 'FTF' expression resulting in a decrease in serum triglyceride in 'wild-type' mice.   <b> 'Taken' 'together,' our results identify the</b> nuclear receptor 'FTF' as a central regulator of lipid metabolism.   <b> 'Factors' such as 'PGE₂' which are secreted from breast carcinomas</b> induce<b> 'PII' expression</b>.   <b> 'A'</b> decrease in 'LRH-1,' 'PII' and total aromatase mRNA transcripts was observed in 'shLRH-1' transfected cells compared to controls under basal and treatment conditions.    'Glucocorticoids' ( 'GC)' have<b> important 'anti-inflammatory' and 'pro-apoptotic' activities</b>.   <b> 'More' 'recently,' liver receptor 'homolog-1'</b> has emerged as a key regulator of intestinal 'function,' coordinating unanticipated 'actions,' such as cell renewal and local immune function with important implications to common intestinal 'diseases,' including colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease.    'This' article is part of a 'Special' 'Issue' 'entitled:' 'Translating' nuclear<b> receptors</b> from health to disease.   <b> 'It' also</b> enhances proliferation and cell cycle progression of cancer cells.    'Remodelling' of the actin cytoskeleton and 'E-cadherin' cleavage was observed with 'LRH-1' 'over-expression,' contributing to increased<b> migratory and invasive properties</b>.   <b> 'These' findings</b> suggest a new role of 'LRH-1' in promoting migration and invasion in breast 'cancer,' independent of oestrogen sensitivity.   <b> 'Previous' studies</b> have shown that 'LRH-1' functions in estrogen biosynthesis by regulating aromatase expression.    'Previously,' we demonstrated that bone 'marrow-derived' mesenchymal stem cells ( 'MSCs)' differentiate into steroidogenic cells such as 'Leydig' and adrenocortical cells by the introduction of steroidogenic 'factor-1' ( 'SF-1)' and treatment with<b> cAMP</b>.   <b> 'PGC-1alpha'</b> binds to the 'NR5A' family['SF-1' and liver receptor 'homolog-1' ( 'LRH-1)]' of proteins and markedly enhances their transcriptional activities.    'Transactivation' of the 'NR5A' family by 'PGC-1alpha' was repressed<b> by 'Dax-1'</b>.   <b> 'Furthermore,' the inhibitory effect could be</b> mediated via suppression of 'SF-1' and 'LRH-1,' and may play a role in 'estrogen-mediated' ovarian folliculogenesis.    'By' using 'reporter-gene' 'analysis,' three of the four 'HBV' 'promoters,' namely the enhancer 'II/core' promoter ( 'ENII/Cp),' preS1 promoter ( 'Sp1)' and enhancer 'I/X' 'promoter,' were identified as targets<b> for 'Prox1-mediated' repression</b>.   <b> 'Both' 'S1P' and 'PGE2'</b> stimulate the recruitment of 'LRH-1,' cAMP response element binding protein ( 'CREB),' 'CCAAT/enhancer' binding proteins ( 'C/EBP),' and 'RNA' 'Polymerase' 'II' ( 'Pol' 'II)' to the 'LRH-1' 'promoter,' as well as increase acetylation of histone 'H3' in this region of chromatin.    'S1P' and 'PGE2' promote the direct<b> interaction</b> of 'CREB' and 'LRH-1,' which is potentiated by 'C/EBPdelta' and the coactivators 'CREB-binding' protein ( 'CBP),' and steroid receptor 'coactivator-3' ( 'SRC-3)'.   <b> 'Besides' the</b> increased inflammatory 'response,' 'LRH-1' heterozygous mice exposed to 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid show lower local corticosterone production as a result of an impaired intestinal expression of the enzymes 'CYP11A1' and 'CYP11B1,' which control the local synthesis of corticosterone in the intestine.   <b> 'Breast' 'tumors,' 'however,' secrete soluble factors that</b> stimulate aromatase expression through an alternative proximal 'promoter,' promoter 'II'.   <b> xFF1rA protein</b> expressed by a recombinant vaccinia virus system specifically binds to 'FTZ-F1' response elements ( 'FRE;' 'PyCAAGGPyCPu)'.    'The' amounts of at least four mRNAs encoding 'full-length' receptors greatly increase<b> between gastrula and early tailbud stages and decrease at later stages</b>.   <b> 'Recent' research</b> has revealed that mammalian 'LRH-1' is also expressed in the steroidogenic organs and has suggested that 'LRH-1' shares a role in steroidogenesis with steroidogenic 'factor-1' ( 'SF-1),' which is a paralog of 'LRH-1'.    'Here,' we present the 2.2 'A' resolution crystal structure of the 'hLRH-1' 'DBD' in complex with duplex 'DNA,' and elucidate the 'sequence-specific' 'DNA' contacts essential for the ability of 'LRH-1' to bind<b> to 'DNA' as a monomer</b>.   <b> 'Electron' density indicates phospholipid</b> bound within the 'ligand-binding' 'pocket,' which we confirm using mass spectrometry of 'solvent-extracted' samples.   <b> 'Dosage-sensitive' 'sex-reversal-adrenal' hypoplasia congenita critical region on the 'X' 'chromosome,' 'gene-1'</b> inhibited 'LRH-1' stimulated 'CYP11A1' 'expression,' and that was not overcome by the presence of 'PKA' agonist.   <b> 'PKA-mediated' phosphorylation</b> increases the interaction between 'GATA3' and 'LRH-1' and the requirement for 'PKA' in aromatase 'PII' promoter stimulation involves at least three specific amino acid 'residues:' 'GATA3' 'Ser308,' 'GATA4' 'Ser261,' and 'LRH-1' 'Ser469'.   <b> 'Steroidogenic' factor 1</b> ( 'SF-1)' or 'Ad4BP' is a member of the fushi tarazu factor 1 ( 'FTZ-F1)' family and an orphan nuclear receptor that plays an important role in the 'hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal' axis and the adrenal cortex.   <b> 'Although' its critical role in the differentiation of 'adrenals,' 'gonads,' and pituitary gonadotropes</b> has been well 'demonstrated,' regulatory function of 'SF-1' during sexual maturation is yet to be examined.   <b> 'Only' 'sFF1-I' mRNA was</b> found in the pituitary and other 'organs,' such as the 'ovary,' 'spleen,' 'liver,' 'brain,' and skeletal muscle.    'At' the same time 'GC' are known to have<b> numerous 'side-effects'</b>.    'Previous' studies demonstrated that 'Nr5a2' is required<b> for both ovulation and luteal steroid synthesis</b>.   <b> 'To' determine the molecular pathways that</b> mediate the distinct effects of 'T' and 'DHT,' we studied the expression of the liver receptor homolog 1 ( 'LRH-1)' 'gene,' which is differentially regulated by these steroids.   <b> 'Additionally,' 'T,' not 5 'α-dihydrotestosterone,'</b> stimulates liver receptor 'homolog-1' ( 'LRH-1)' 'expression,' whereas the expression of steroidogenic 'factor-1' ( 'SF-1)' was not affected by either steroid.    'Accordingly,' small interference 'RNA' against 'LRH-1' prevented<b> 'Cyp19' and 'P450' 'side-change' cleavage 'up-regulation' whereas 'anti-SF-1' small interference 'RNA' had no effects</b>.   <b> 'Cells' overexpressing 'HSL'</b> increased the efficacy of liver 'X' receptor ( 'LXR)' ligands on 'StAR' expression and steroid 'synthesis,' suggesting 'HSL-mediated' steroidogenesis entails enhanced oxysterol production.    'Interleukin' ( 'IL)-18' and<b> 'IL-12'</b> synergize for the production of interferon ( 'IFN)-γ,' which can downregulate 'ATP-binding' cassette transporter 'A1' ( 'ABCA1)' expression.   <b> 'Downstream,' 'T0901317'</b> inhibited activation of the small 'GTPase' 'Rac' and phosphorylation of the myosin light chain ( 'MLC)'.    'Together,' these results show that 'ceramide,' an important lipid component of 'epidermis,' 'up-regulates' 'ABCA12' expression via the 'PPARdelta-mediated' signaling 'pathway,' providing a<b> 'substrate-driven,' 'feed-forward' mechanism for regulating this key lipid transporter</b>.    'These' effects of fenofibrate are dependent on 'PPARalpha,' as 'Ppar' 'alpha-knockout' mice fail to respond<b> like 'wild-type' littermates</b>.   <b> 'Fenofibrate' affects the 'ezetimibe-sensitive' pathway and</b> retains the ability to decrease cholesterol absorption and 'NPC1L1' mRNA expression in 'chow-fed' liver 'X' receptor 'alpha/beta-double-knockout' mice and 'high-cholesterol-' or cholic 'acid-fed' 'wild-type' mice.   <b> 'Also,' an emerging role</b> has been suggested for 'G' protein coupled receptors and for the small 'Ras' and 'Rho' 'GTPases' in the regulation of the expression of endothelial 'NO' synthase ( 'eNOS)' and of tissue 'factor,' which are involved in thrombus formation and modulation of vascular tone.    'Angiotensin' 'II' ( 'Ang' 'II)' regulates the expression of some core clock 'genes;' excess<b> 'Ang' 'II'</b> leads to atherosclerosis advancement.   <b> 'Macrophage' 'Rev-erbα'</b> mediates clockwork and 'inflammation,' and plays a role in atherosclerotic lesion progression.    7 'cells,' 'NLB' significantly ameliorated cholesterol accumulation in macrophages via enhancing<b> apolipoprotein 'A-I' and 'HDL-mediated' cholesterol efflux</b>.   <b> 'Mechanistically,' 'NLB'</b> induced messenger 'RNA' and protein expression of the 'ATP-binding' cassette transporter 'A1' ( 'ABCA1)' and 'G1' ( 'ABCG1)' in 'RAW264'.    'LXR' activation inhibited<b> nitric oxide synthase 2 </b>, inducible ( 'Nos2)' expression and nitric oxide production in lipopolysaccharide ( 'LPS)-stimulated' microglia.   <b> 'Histone' acetylation and 'NF-kappaB1' p50</b> binding were mechanistically 'linked,' and histone deacetylase ( 'HDAC)' activity appeared to be important for 'LXR-dependent' transcriptional repression of 'Nos2'.   <b> 'They'</b> have been shown previously to represent 50-70 '%' of the bacterial population in the biofilm of the 'methanol-fed' denitrification reactor treating a large seawater aquarium at the 'Montreal' 'Biodome'.   <b> 'Further' verification</b> has identified nine genes ( 'AGPAT5,' 'CHD1,' 'ERLIN1,' 'GREB1,' 'HSPA8,' 'KPNA2,' 'MREG,' 'NARG1' and 'PLOD2)' which were directly targeted by 'miR-26' via their 3 '\'' 'UTR'.   <b> 'Functional' screening</b> suggested only three estrogen regulated 'miR-26' target genes ( 'CHD1,' 'GREB1' and 'KPNA2)' were involved in the regulation of estrogen promoted cell proliferation.

'Furthermore,' the 'Atraumatic' 'Restorative' 'Treatment' may be indicated as the primary treatment method in children to prevent<b> dental treatment anxiety and treatment under general anaesthesia</b>.    'The' authors therefore conclude that risk of aspiration is a relevant care problem among 'Dutch' care home residents and requires<b> further assessment</b>.   <b> 'However,' it</b> increased markedly with age among 'women,' and in the 'age-groups' above 60 'years,' the prevalence was similar between men and women ( 26.4 vs.   <b> 'Multiple' regression analyses showed that</b> 'obesity,' elevated levels of fasting blood 'sugar,' 'TG,' total 'cholesterol,' and alanine 'aminotransferase,' an aspartate 'aminotransferase/alanine' aminotransferase ratio of less than 1, serum uric acid 'levels,' and decreased 'high-density' lipoprotein levels were related to 'FLD' in 'men,' whereas age played a more prominent role in women.    'Using' oral cleaning 'materials,' performing mechanical tongue 'cleaning,' and periodical dentist consultation were 'over-represented' in 'women,' whereas men were more likely to have<b> observable biofilm and carious lesions than women</b>.    'Relatively' prevalent<b> complications</b> of 'single-' and 'multi-unit' fixed dental prostheses are porcelain and ceramic fractures.
