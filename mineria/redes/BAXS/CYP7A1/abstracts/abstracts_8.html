<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>	<meta charset="utf-8">	<title>generación de archivo html</title></head><body>More than 950 phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene variants have been identified in people with phenylketonuria (PKU). These vary in their consequences for the residual level of PAH activity, from having little or no effect to abolishing PAH activity completely. Advances in genotyping technology and the availability of locus-specific and genotype databases have greatly expanded our understanding of the correlations between individual gene variant, residual PAH activity, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4 ) responsiveness, and the clinical PKU phenotype. Most patients (∼76%) have compound heterozygous PAH gene variants and one mutated allele may markedly influence the activity of the second mutated allele, which in turn may influence either positively or negatively the activity of the biologically active heterotetrameric form of the PAH. While it is possible to predict the level of BH4 responsiveness (∼71%) and PKU severity (∼78%) from the nature of the underlying gene variants, these relationships remain complex and incompletely understood. A greater understanding of these relationships may increase the potential for individualized management of PKU in future. Inherited deficiencies in BH4 metabolism account for about 1%-2% of all hyperphenylalaninemias and are clinically more severe than PKU. Almost 90% of all patients are deficient in 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase and dihydropteridine reductase.
In the United States, and most developed nations, the newborn screening (NBS) panel covers many primary disorders of metabolism, including phenylketonuria (PKU). When an elevated phenylalanine level is identified, the infant is evaluated for PKU and should also be tested for tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency. A neonate presented with a phenylalanine level of 254 μmol/L (reference range &lt;138 μmol/L) on newborn screening. The infant's confirmatory phenylalanine was 118 μmol/L (reference range &lt;77 μmol/L). Her urine pterin profile was normal, and initially she had no measurable activity of red blood cell (RBC) dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR). Subsequent study revealed normal levels of CSF tetrahydrobiopterin and neurotransmitter metabolites, and by 18 months of age, her RBC DHPR activity was detectable at 0.5 nmol/min/mgHgb (reference range 0.8-3.9). Sequencing of the QDPR gene for DHPR revealed c.1A&gt;T nucleotide substitution in exon 3 expressed as "p.MET1?" Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene sequencing revealed compound heterozygosity for L249F and A300S. Although initial testing suggested the child was affected with DHPR deficiency, further analysis, finding increasing levels of DHPR activity and PAH compound mutant heterozygosity, indicated that the primary disorder is mild hyperphenylalaninemia with carrier status for DHPR deficiency. This is an example of newborn screening results leading to confusing findings requiring extensive biochemical studies and genotyping in order to arrive at the appropriate diagnosis. 
This study aimed to investigate the mutation spectrum of the QDPR gene, to determine the effect of mutations on dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) structure/function, to discuss the potential genotypephenotype correlation, and to evaluate the clinical outcome of Chinese patients after treatment.
Nine DHPR-deficient patients were enrolled in this study and seven of them underwent neonatal screening. QDPR gene mutations were analyzed and confirmed by routine methods. The potential pathogenicity of missense variants was analyzed using Clustal X, PolyPhen program and Swiss-PDB Viewer 4.04_OSX software, respectively. The clinical outcomes of the patients were evaluated after long-term treatment.
In 10 mutations of the 9 patients, 4 were novel mutations (G20V, V86D, G130S and A175R), 4 were reported by us previously, and 2 known mutations were identified. R221X was a hotspot mutation (27.7%) in our patients. Eight missense mutations probably had damage to protein. Six patients in this series were treated with a good control of phenylalanine level. The height and weight of the patients were normal at the age of 4 months to 7.5 years. Four patients, who underwent a neonatal screening and were treated early, showed a normal mental development. In 2 patients diagnosed late, neurological symptoms were significantly improved.
The mutation spectrum of the QDPR gene is different in the Chinese population. Most mutations are related to severe phenotype. The determination of DHPR activity should be performed in patients with hyperphenylalaninemia. DHPR-deficient patients who were treated below the age of 2 months may have a near normal mental development.
Nitric oxide (NO) is produced as part of the host immune response to bacterial infections, including urinary tract infections. The enzyme flavohemoglobin, coded by the hmp gene, is involved in protecting bacterial cells from the toxic effects of NO and represents a potentially interesting target for development of novel treatment concepts against resistant uropathogenic bacteria. The aim of the present study was to investigate if the in vitro antibacterial effects of NO can be enhanced by pharmacological modulation of the enzyme flavohemoglobin.
Four clinical isolates of multidrug-resistant extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing uropathogenic E. coli were included in the study. It was shown that the NO-donor substance DETA/NO, but not inactivated DETA/NO, caused an initial growth inhibition with regrowth noted after 8 h of exposure. An hmp-deficient strain showed a prolonged growth inhibition in response to DETA/NO compared to the wild type. The imidazole antibiotic miconazole, that has been shown to inhibit bacterial flavohemoglobin activity, prolonged the DETA/NO-evoked growth inhibition. When miconazole was combined with polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN), in order to increase the bacterial wall permeability, DETA/NO caused a prolonged bacteriostatic response that lasted for up to 24 h.
An NO-donor in combination with miconazole and PMBN showed enhanced antimicrobial effects and proved effective against multidrug-resistant ESBL-producing uropathogenic E. coli.
We have compared the brain proteome in the temporal neocortex between Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and non-AD individuals by using shotgun mass spectrometry based on a stable isotope dimethyl labeling. A total of 827 unique proteins were identified and quantitated. Of these, 227 proteins were found in at least 9 out of 10 AD/control pairs and were further subjected to statistical analysis. A total of 69 proteins showed different levels (p-value &lt; 0.05) in AD versus control brain samples. Of these proteins, 37 were increased and 32 were decreased as compared to the non-AD subjects. Twenty-three proteins comprise novel proteins that have not previously been reported as related to AD, e.g., neuronal-specific septin-3, septin-2, septin-5, dihydropteridine reductase, and clathrin heavy chain 1. The proteins with altered levels in the AD brain represent a wide variety of pathways suggested to be involved in the disease pathogenesis, including energy metabolism, glycolysis, oxidative stress, apoptosis, signal transduction, and synaptic functioning. Apart from leading to new insights into the molecular mechanisms in AD, the findings provide us with possible novel candidates for future diagnostic and prognostic disease markers. 
Defects either in phenylalanine hydroxylase (PheOH) or in the production and recycling of its cofactor (tetrahydrobiopterin [BH4]) are the causes of primary hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA). The aim of our study was to investigate the current status of different variants of HPA Kurdish patients in Kermanshah province, Iran.
From 33 cases enrolled in our study, 32 were identified as HPA patients. Reassessing of pre-treatment phenylalanine concentrations and the analysis of urinary pterins was done by high-performance liquid chromatography method.
A total of 30 patients showed PAH deficiency and two patients were diagnosed with BH4 deficiency (BH4/HPA ratio = 6.25%). Both of these two BH4-deficient patients were assigned to severe variant of dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) deficiency. More than 75% of patients with PAH deficiency classified as classic phenylketonuria (PKU) according their levels of pre-treatment phenylalanine concentrations.
Based on the performed study, we think that the frequency of milder forms of PKU is higher than those was estimated before and/or our findings here. Furthermore, the frequency of DHPR deficiency seems to be relatively high in our province. Since the clinical symptoms of DHPR deficiency are confusingly similar to that of classic PKU and its prognosis are much worse than classical PKU and cannot be solely treated with the PKU regime, our pilot study support that it is crucial to set up screening for BH4 deficiency, along with PAH deficiency, among all HPA patients diagnosed with HPA.
Diagnosis of aminoacidopathies and organic acidemias constitutes a real challenge in a developing country with high consanguinity rate and no systematic newborn screening. We report a twelve-year experience with the identification of these disorders in Lebanon, based on their clinical and biochemical profiles.
In this retrospective study, we reviewed clinical presentation and biochemical investigations of 294 patients. Traditional chromatographic methods were used for analyses. Findings were linked to the identified disorders.
Out of 2921 patients, presenting to our metabolic program with neurological, digestive, family history and/or other symptoms suggestive of aminoacidopathy or organic acidemia, 294 patients were included with confirmed amino or organic acid disorder. The overall analytical yield was 10%. Aminoacidopathies were three-fold higher than organic acidemias. Phenylketonuria and methylmalonic acidemia were the most frequent. The majority of patients (79%) were symptomatic (median age: 14months, range: 1day-44years), mainly with neurological manifestations (87%). Intellectual disability was mostly due to phenylketonuria (73%). Chronic liver failure was frequent in maple syrup urine disease (53%). Plasma amino and urine organic acid chromatography were diagnostic in 8.8% and 3.9% of analyzed cases, respectively. Change in chromatographic technique from reversed-phase to ion-exchange enhanced the detection of many aminoacidopathies.
In the absence of newborn screening, the majority of aminoacidopathy and organic acidemia cases are still diagnosed clinically. This study emphasizes the importance of clinical awareness and accurate biochemical analyses as key tools for diagnosis in countries like ours, and the necessity for a comprehensive national newborn screening program.
Objective: To analyze the variations of PTPS gene in patients with suspected 6-pyruvoyl-tetra hydropterin synthase deficiency (PTPSD) and to make prenatal diagnosis in high-risk families. Methods: Chemiluminescence was used for phenylalanine detection in blood or dried blood spots.Patients with phenylalanine concentration over 120 μmol/L were detected by urine pterin analysis, and the activity of dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) was detected. tetrahydrobiopterin loading tests were performed in suspected patients with abnormal urinary pterin profiles. PTPS gene variation analysis was performed by direct Sanger sequencing based on PCR amplification. Prenatal diagnosis in 7 high-risk families was performed by chorionic villus sampling when the genotype was identified. Results: In 656 patients with hyperphenylalanine, 22 cases were diagnosed as PTPSD clinically. 16 variations were detected in the 22 PTPSD cases. The 5 variations, p.Lys77Arg, p.Ile84Phe, c.315-2A&gt;G, c.244-2A&gt;T, c.187-1G&gt;T, were identified as novel variations. Two fetuses carried the same mutation with the proband and therefore were thought to be PTPSD fetuses. Three fetuses carried only one mutant allele and thus were thought to be PTPSD carriers. The other 2 fetuses carried no mutations and were presumed normal. Conclusions: PTPS gene variation analysis is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Prenatal diagnosis could help avoiding the defect birth in PTPSD families.
Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that enable communication between the neurons in the synaptic cleft. Inborn errors of neurotransmitter biosynthesis, breakdown and transport are a group of very rare neurometabolic diseases resulting in neurological impairment at any age from newborn to adulthood.
The International Working Group on Neurotransmitter related Disorders (iNTD) is the first international network focusing on the study of primary and secondary neurotransmitter disorders. It was founded with the aim to foster exchange and improve knowledge in the field of these rare diseases. The newly established iNTD patient registry for neurotransmitter related diseases collects longitudinal data on the natural disease course, approach to diagnosis, therapeutic strategies, and quality of life of affected patients. The registry forms the evidence base for the development of consensus guidelines for patients with neurotransmitter related disorders.
The iNTD network and registry will improve knowledge and strengthen research capacities in the field of inborn neurotransmitter disorders. The evidence-based guidelines will facilitate standardized diagnostic procedures and treatment approaches.
Dopamine (DA) is a neurotransmitter in the brain, playing a central role in several disease conditions, including tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) metabolism disorders and Parkinson's disease (PD). BH4 metabolism disorders present a variety of clinical manifestations including motor disturbance via altered DA metabolism, since BH4 is a cofactor for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a rate-limiting enzyme for DA synthesis. Genetically, BH4 metabolism disorders are, in an autosomal recessive pattern, caused by a variant in genes encoding enzymes for BH4 synthesis or recycling, including 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS) or dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR), respectively. Although BH4 metabolism disorders and its metabolisms have been studied, it is unclear how gene variants cause aberrant DA synthesis in patient neurons. Here, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from BH4 metabolism disorder patients with PTPS or DHPR variants, corrected the gene variant in the iPSCs using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and differentiated the BH4 metabolism disorder patient- and isogenic control iPSCs into midbrain DA neurons. We found that by the gene correction, the BH4 amount, TH protein level and extracellular DA level were restored in DA neuronal culture using PTPS deficiency iPSCs. Furthermore, the pharmacological correction by BH4 precursor sepiapterin treatment also improved the phenotypes of PTPS deficiency. These results suggest that patient iPSCs with BH4 metabolism disorders provide an opportunity for screening substances for treating aberrant DA synthesis-related disorders.
Nitric oxide (NO) is a toxic free radical produced by neutrophils and macrophages in response to infection. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) induces a variety of defence mechanisms in response to NO, including direct NO detoxification (Hmp, NorVW, NrfA), iron-sulphur cluster repair (YtfE), and the expression of the NO-tolerant cytochrome bd-I respiratory oxidase (CydAB). The current study quantifies the relative contribution of these systems to UPEC growth and survival during infection. Loss of the flavohemoglobin Hmp and cytochrome bd-I elicit the greatest sensitivity to NO-mediated growth inhibition, whereas all but the periplasmic nitrite reductase NrfA provide protection against neutrophil killing and promote survival within activated macrophages. Intriguingly, the cytochrome bd-I respiratory oxidase was the only system that augmented UPEC survival in a mouse model after 2 days, suggesting that maintaining aerobic respiration under conditions of nitrosative stress is a key factor for host colonisation. These findings suggest that while UPEC have acquired a host of specialized mechanisms to evade nitrosative stresses, the cytochrome bd-I respiratory oxidase is the main contributor to NO tolerance and host colonisation under microaerobic conditions. This respiratory complex is therefore of major importance for the accumulation of high bacterial loads during infection of the urinary tract.
Mutations in Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 NM_198578 (LRRK2 c.6055G &gt; A (p.G2019S), LRRK2 c.4321C &gt; G (p.R1441G)) and alpha-synuclein NM_000345 (SNCA c.209G &gt; A (p.A53T)) genes causing Parkinson's disease (PD) are common in Mediterranean populations. Variants in the Quinoid Dihydropteridine Reductase NM_000320 (QDPR c.68G &gt; A (p.G23D)), Sepiapterin Reductase NM_003124 (SPR c.596-2A &gt; G) and Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase NM_005957 (MTHFR c.677C &gt; T and c.1298A &gt; C) genes are frequent in Malta and potential candidates for PD.
178 cases and 402 control samples from Malta collected as part of the Geoparkinson project were genotyped for MTHFR polymorphisms, QDPR and SPR mutations. Only PD and parkinsonism cases were tested for SNCA and LRRK2 mutations.
LRRK2 c.4321C &gt; G and SNCA c.209G &gt; A were not detected. The LRRK2 c.6055G &gt; A mutation was found in 3.1 % of Maltese PD cases. The QDPR mutation was found in both cases and controls and did not increase risk for PD. The SPR mutation was found in controls only. The odds ratios for MTHFR polymorphisms were not elevated.
The LRRK2 c.6055G &gt; A is a cause of PD in the Maltese, whilst QDPR c.68G &gt; A, SPR c.596-2A &gt; G and MTHFR c.677C &gt; T and c.1298A &gt; C are not important determinants of PD.
Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiencies are inherited neuro-metabolic disorders leading to monoamine neurotransmitters deficiency. An individualized replacement therapy with neurotransmitters precursors is necessary to restore dopaminergic and serotoninergic homeostasis. The correction of dopaminergic tone is complicated, like in Parkinson disease, by l-dopa short half-life and adverse effects. To improve this picture, since 2009 we introduced the non-ergot dopamine agonist pramipexole as an adjunct to l-dopa therapy in the treatment of the most common causes of BH4 deficiency, 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS) deficiency and dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) deficiency. In the short-term period, this approach allowed substantial clinical advantages in affected patients, with amelioration and stabilization of the clinical picture on twice daily treatment administration and no adverse effect. Here we describe the long-term clinical follow-up (83 ± 24 months) of seven patients with BH4 deficiency treated with pramipexole. After a period of good clinical compensation (34 ± 1 months), different impulse control disorders (gambling, compulsive buying, and hypersexuality) were observed in three patients treated with high-dose pramipexole (0.030-0.033 mg/kg/day) beyond adolescence. These psychiatric adverse effects promptly disappeared after curtailing pramipexole dose by 50-60%. Low-dose pramipexole therapy has been safe and effective in the long-term period in all treated patients (59 ± 9 months). High-dose pramipexole therapy in BH4 deficiency can be complicated, like in Parkinson disease, by psychiatric adverse effects. Low-dose pramipexole therapy (∼0.010 mg/kg/day) has been safe and clinically effective on long-term follow-up, representing a helpful therapeutic option in patients with BH4 deficiency.
Hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) is a condition caused by tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiencies. It is essential that differential diagnosis be conducted to distinguish these two causes of HPA, because BH4 deficiency is a more severe disease involving progressive neurologic deterioration. Based on the biological findings, HPA is defined as a plasma phenylalanine level of &gt;2.0 mg/dl (&gt;120 μmol/l). The National Biochemistry Reference Laboratory at the Pasteur Institute of Iran initiated BH4 deficiency screening tests for the first time during the implementation of a nationwide phenylketonuria (PKU) screening program. Measurement of blood phenylalanine and urinary neopterin and biopterin was conducted by high-performance liquid chromatography in 617 patients with HPA. Dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) activity was measured in all patients by kinetic spectrophotometry. Differential diagnosis was conducted for PKU, transient HPA, and BH4 deficiencies.Our results indicated that out of 76 cases involving BH4 deficiencies, 37 had 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS) deficiency, 35 had DHPR deficiency, 1 case had pterin-4a-carbinolamine dehydratase (PCD) deficiency, and 3 cases had GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH) deficiency. In this study, 1 novel deletion mutation and 18 novel missense mutations were reported in addition to mutations that had previously been identified and registered in BIOMDB. At present, the screening program for PKU in Iran includes tests that detect different forms of BH4 deficiency presenting with HPA. Newborns that are BH4-deficient benefit from the availability of the tests because they can receive necessary care before being clinically affected.
Nitric oxide (NO) detoxification enzymes, such as NO dioxygenase (NOD) and NO reductase (NOR), are important to the virulence of numerous bacteria. Pathogens use these defense systems to ward off immune-generated NO, and they do so in environments that contain additional stressors, such as reactive oxygen species, nutrient deprivation, and acid stress. NOD and NOR both use reducing equivalents to metabolically deactivate NO, which suggests that nutrient deprivation could negatively impact their functionality. To explore the relationship between NO detoxification and nutrient deprivation, we examined the ability of Escherichia coli to detoxify NO under different levels of carbon source availability in aerobic cultures. We observed failure of NO detoxification under both carbon source limitation and starvation, and those failures could have arisen from inabilities to synthesize Hmp (NOD of E. coli) and/or supply it with sufficient NADH (preferred electron donor). We found that when limited quantities of carbon source were provided, NO detoxification failed due to insufficient NADH, whereas starvation prevented Hmp synthesis, which enabled cells to maintain their NADH levels. This maintenance of NADH levels under starvation was confirmed to be dependent on the absence of Hmp. Intriguingly, these data show that under NO stress, carbon-starved E. coli are better positioned with regard to reducing power to cope with other stresses than cells that had consumed an exhaustible amount of carbon.
Due to their functional independence, proteins that comprise standalone metabolic units, which we name single-protein metabolic modules, may be particularly prone to gene duplication (GD) and horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Flavohemoglobins (flavoHbs) are prime examples of single-protein metabolic modules, detoxifying nitric oxide (NO), a ubiquitous toxin whose antimicrobial properties many life forms exploit, to nitrate, a common source of nitrogen for organisms. FlavoHbs appear widespread in bacteria and have been identified in a handful of microbial eukaryotes, but how the distribution of this ecologically and biomedically important protein family evolved remains unknown. Reconstruction of the evolutionary history of 3,318 flavoHb protein sequences covering the family's known diversity showed evidence of recurrent HGT at multiple evolutionary scales including intrabacterial HGT, as well as HGT from bacteria to eukaryotes. One of the most striking examples of HGT is the acquisition of a flavoHb by the dandruff- and eczema-causing fungus Malassezia from Corynebacterium Actinobacteria, a transfer that growth experiments show is capable of mediating NO resistance in fungi. Other flavoHbs arose via GD; for example, many filamentous fungi possess two flavoHbs that are differentially targeted to the cytosol and mitochondria, likely conferring protection against external and internal sources of NO, respectively. Because single-protein metabolic modules such as flavoHb function independently, readily undergo GD and HGT, and are frequently involved in organismal defense and competition, we suggest that they represent "plug-and-play" proteins for ecological arms races.
Physarum polycephalum is one of few non-animal organisms capable of synthesizing tetrahydrobiopterin from GTP. Here we demonstrate developmentally regulated expression of quinoid dihydropteridine reductase (EC 1.6.99.7), an enzyme required for recycling 6,7-[8H]-dihydrobiopterin. Physarum also expresses phenylalanine-4-hydroxylase activity, an enzyme that depends on dihydropteridine reductase. The 24.4 kDa Physarum dihydropteridine reductase shares 43% amino acid identity with the human protein. A number of residues important for function of the mammalian enzyme are also conserved in the Physarum sequence. In comparison to sheep liver dihydropteridine reductase, purified recombinant Physarum dihydropteridine reductase prefers pterin substrates with a 6-(1', 2'-dihydroxypropyl) group. Our results demonstrate that Physarum synthesizes, utilizes and metabolizes tetrahydrobiopterin in a way hitherto thought to be restricted to the animal kingdom.
In mammals dietary ferric iron is reduced to ferrous iron for more efficient absorption by the intestine. Analysis of a pig duodenal membrane fraction revealed two NADH-dependent ferric reductase activities, one associated with a b-type cytochrome and the other not. Purification and characterization of the non-cytochrome ferric reductase identified a 31 kDa protein. MALDI-MS analysis and amino acid sequencing identified the ferric reductase as being related to the 26 kDa liver NADH-dependent quinoid dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR). The NADH-dependent DHPR ferric reductase activity was found to be pteridine-independent since exhaustive dialysis did not reduce activity and heat-inactivation destroyed activity. In intestinal Caco-2 cells, DHPR mRNA levels were found to be regulated by iron. Thus, DHPR appears to be a dual function enzyme, a NADH-dependent dihydopteridine reductase and an iron-regulated, NADH-dependent, pteridine-independent ferric reductase.
The cofactor product of the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, 4a-hydroxy-6(R)-tetrahydrobiopterin, requires dehydration before tetrahydrobiopterin can be regenerated by dihydropteridine reductase. Carbinolamine dehydration occurs nonenzymatically, but the reaction is also catalyzed by 4a-hydroxytetrahydropterin dehydratase. This enzyme has the identical amino acid sequence to DCoH, the dimerization cofactor of the transcription regulator, HNF-1 alpha. The catalytic activity of rat liver dehydratase was characterized using a new assay employing chemically synthesized 4a-hydroxytetrahydropterins. The enzyme shows little sensitivity to the structure or configuration of the 6-substituent of its substrate, with Km's for 6(S)-methyl, 6(R)-methyl, 6(S)-propyl, and 6(R)-L-erythro-dihydroxypropyl all between 1.5 and 6 microM. Turnover numbers at 37 degrees C are 50-90 s-1 at pH 7.4 and 2.5-3-fold lower at pH 8.4. Both 4a(R)- and 4a(S)-hydroxytetrahydropterins are good substrates. The quinoid dihydropterin products are strong inhibitors of the dehydratase with KI's about one half of their respective Km's, but no inhibition was observed with 7,8-dihydropterins or tetrahydropterins. The enzyme contains no metals and no phosphorus. Reaction mechanisms which involve either acid and/or base catalysis are discussed. 4a-Hydroxy-6(R)-tetrahydrobiopterin was determined not to be a product inhibitor of phenylalanine hydroxylase. It is concluded that the dehydratase (which was found to be 6 microM in rat liver) is essential in vivo to prevent rearrangement of 4a-hydroxy-6(R)-tetrahydrobiopterin and to maintain the supply of tetrahydrobiopterin cofactor for the hydroxylases under conditions where the nonenzymatic rate would be inadequate.
Homologues of 6-methyl-7,8-dihydropterin (6-Me-7,8-PH2) and 6-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin (6-Me-PH4), expanded in the pyrazine ring, were synthesized to determine the effect of increased strain on the chemical and enzymatic properties of the pyrimidodiazepine series. 2-Amino-4-keto-6-methyl-7,8-dihydro-3H,9H-pyrimido[4,5-b] [1,4]diazepine (6-Me-7,8-PDH2) was found to be more unstable in neutral solution than 6-Me-7,8-PH2. Its decomposition appears to proceed by hydrolytic ring opening of the 5,6-imine bond, followed by autooxidation. 6-Me-7,8-PDH2 can be reduced, either chemically or by dihydrofolate reductase (Km = 0.16 mM), to the 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro form (6-Me-PDH4). This can be oxidized with halogen to quinoid dihydropyrimidodiazepine (quinoid 6-Me-PDH2), which is a substrate for dihydropteridine reductase (Km = 33 microM). Whereas quinoid 6-methyldihydropterin was found to tautomerize to 6-Me-7,8-PH2 in 95% yield in 0.1 M tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane hydrochloride (Tris-HCl), pH 7.4, quinoid 6-Me-PDH2 gives only 53% 6-Me-7,8-PDH2, the remainder decomposing via an initial opening of the diazepine ring. Additional evidence for the extra strain in the pyrimidodiazepine system is the cyclization of quinoid 6-N-(2'-aminopropyl)divicine to quinoid 6-Me-PH2 in 57% yield in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. By comparison, no quinoid 6-Me-PDH2 is formed from the homologue quinoid 6-N-(3'-aminobutyl)divicine. A small (2%) yield of 6-Me-PDH4 is found if the unstable C4a-carbinolamine intermediate is trapped by enzymatic dehydration and reduction. Although phenylalanine hydroxylase utilizes 6-Me-PDH4 (Km = 0.15 mM), the maximum velocity of tyrosine production is 20 times slower than that with 6-Me-PH4, indicating that a ring opening reaction is not a rate-limiting step in the hydroxylase pathway. Further, the maximum velocities of 2,5,6-triamino-4(3H)-pyrimidinone, 2,6-diamino-5-(methylamino)-4(3H)-pyrimidinone, and 2,6-diamino-5-(benzylamino)-4(3H)-pyrimidinone span a 35-fold range. These cofactors would theoretically form the same oxide of quinoid divicine if oxygen activation involves a carbonyl oxide intermediate. Thus, the limiting step is also not transfer of oxygen from this hypothetical intermediate to the phenylalanine substrate.
Tryptophan (Trp), as the precursor of serotonin, has been introduced in the treatment of depression and isomnia, but its clinical effectiveness must be considered with caution. In this presentation, the different aspects concerning the transport of Trp from the intestine to the brain and its enzymatic conversion into serotonin are discussed. The study of recent literature shows that the discussion about the relative importance of free and total plasma Trp and of the competitive large neutral amino acids for the transport of Trp into the brain continues. On the other hand, mainly animal studies demonstrate numerous regulatory processes, the importance of which has been underestimated until today. These processes concern enzymes like indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase, cleaving Trp, but also quinoid-dihydropteridine reductase, producing the tetrahydrobiopterin necessary for Trp hydroxylase. It is proposed that the different steps leading from Trp to functionally active 5-HT are considered in a more systemic approach, taking into account that 5-HT synthesis depends on factors like depolarization of the nerve cell, endproduct inhibition, etc. In man, further studies are needed concerning the fate of Trp and competing compounds in the blood, after long-term treatment with Trp. In order to influence enzymatic mechanisms, clinical trials with compounds like tetrahydrobiopterin, acting directly on the enzymatic conversion of Trp into 5-HT, could lend new impulses to research on precursor therapy.
The tautomeric structure of the cofactor product of aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, quinoid dihydrobiopterin, is still unknown. Characterization of this molecule, which is also the substrate for dihydropteridine reductase (EC 1.6.99.7), has been hindered by the rapid rearrangement of quinoid dihydropterins to 7,8-dihydropterins. This tautomerization can be prevented by disubstitution at the 6-position. A procedure is presented for the synthesis of 6,6-disubstituted pterins from a vicinal diamine and 2-amino-6-chloro-4(3H)-pyrimidinone. The method is illustrated with the specific synthesis of 6,6-dimethyltetrahydropterin (6,6-Me2PH4). 6,6-Me2PH4 is a cofactor for rat liver phenylalanine hydroxylase (EC 1.14.16.1), with enzyme kinetic parameters similar to those of its positional isomer, 6,7-dimethyltetrahydropterin. The resulting quinoid 6,6-dimethyldihydropterin (q-6,6-Me2PH2) is stable; the half-life in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 27 and 37 degrees C is 4 and 1.25 h, respectively. q-6,6-Me2PH2, produced either by phenylalanine hydroxylase or by chemical oxidation of 6,6-Me2PH4, is a substrate for dihydropteridine reductase, with a Km of 0.4 mM and a maximum velocity double that of the natural isomer of quinoid dihydrobiopterin. In concentrations up to 0.4 mM q-6,6-Me2PH2 is not an inhibitor of phenylalanine hydroxylase, in contrast to 6-methyl-7,8-dihydropterin and 7,8-dihydrobiopterin which inhibit competitively, with Ki's of 0.2 mM and 0.05 mM, respectively. The stability of q-6,6-Me2PH2 has facilitated definitive determination of chemical and physical properties of a quinoid dihydropterin.
In dihydropteridine reductase assay the substrate quinonoid dihydropterine is reduced again to tetrahydropterine, concomitantly oxidizing NADH, the indicator of the enzyme assay. Because of the strong oxidizing capacity of quinonoid dihydropterine, the degree of spontaneous oxidation of NADH by the various substances used in the dihydropterine reductase assay was studied spectrally. A high degree of spontaneous oxidation of NADH by the substrate itself was found, which can be regulated by dithiotreitol, dependent on its concentration. The absorbance increase at 336 nm, due to the non-quinonoid dihydropterine formed spontaneously from its quinonoid form, strongly interferes with the absorbance decrease at 340 nm, due to the disappearance of NADH. The interference results in a shift of the absorbance maximum of NADH from 340 nm up to higher wavelengths. This phenomenon, expressing itself in various ways in blank and sample, is discussed with relevance to the validity of the current enzyme assays used in a further classification of hyperphenylalaninaemic patients.
Dihydropteridine reductase was found in extracts of Crithidia fasciculata and was demonstrated by the fact that the enzyme required both quinonoid-dihydropterin and NADH as substrates. 7,8-Dihydropterin and dihydrofolate failed to serve as substrates; tetrahydropterin was formed as the reaction product. The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be about 55 000 by Sephadex G-100 gel filtration. NADH was more effective than NADPH as substrate for the enzyme. Tetrahydropterin (1.35 nmol tetrahydrobiopterin equivalents/g cells) was also detected in C. fasciculata.
An acrylamide gel electrophoretic procedure is described which allows the separation of human quinoid-dihydropteridine reductase (QDPR), EC 1.6.5.1) from the homologous enzyme expressed in established rodent cell lines. The human enzyme marker segregates exclusively with chromosome 4 in a series of well characterized man-mouse somatic cell hybrid clones from our clone bank. This observation supports the assignment of a structural gene for QDPR to human chromosome 4.
Deficient activity of the Dihydropteridine Reductase enzyme (DHPR; EC 1.5.1.34; OMIM 261630) is due to mutations in the Quinoid Dihydropteridine Reductase gene on 4p15.3 (QDPR; RefSeq NM_000320). It results in defective recycling of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)) and homozygotes have a rare form of atypical Hyperphenylalaninaemia and Phenylketonuria (aPKU). The heterozygote frequency in the Maltese population is high at 3.3%. The more recently described and rarer type of BH(4) deficiency due to Sepiapterin Reductase enzyme deficiency (SR; EC 1.1.1.153; OMIM 182125), which presents as an atypical form of Dopa Responsive Dystonia (DRD) [L. Bonafe, B. Thony, J.M. Penzien, B. Czarnecki, N. Blau, Mutations in the sepiapterin reductase gene cause a novel tetrahydrobiopterin-dependent monoamine-neurotransmitter deficiency without hyperphenylalaninemia, Am. J. Hum. Genet. 69 (2001) 269-277; B.R.G. Neville, R. Parascandalo, S. Attard Montalto, R. Farrugia, A.E. Felice, A congenital dopa responsive motor disorder: a Maltese variant due to sepiapterin reductase deficiency, Brain 128 (Pt10) (2005) 2291-2296.] has also been identified at high frequency (4.6%) in this population. Two mutations, the c.68G&gt;A in QDPR (p.G23D), and the new SPR, IVS2-2A&gt;G mutation at the splice site consensus sequence in intron 2 of the Sepiapterin Reductase gene (SPR; RefSeq NM_003124) on 2p14-p12, were found to be the sole causative mutations in all the patients with DHPR deficiency and SR deficiency studied. All parents were heterozygotes for the corresponding mutation and showed no clinical symptoms. Three polymorphisms, c.96C&gt;T (p.A32A), c. 345G&gt;A (p.S115S) and c. 396G&gt;A (p.L132L), have also been identified in the QDPR gene, defining four wild-type frameworks, useful in molecular epidemiology studies. The c. 68G&gt;A mutation in QDPR was found only on framework I, suggesting a founder effect. In contrast no additional sequence diversity was found in the SPR gene whether in wild-type or mutant alleles which is also consistent with a founder effect.
Relatively little attention has been focused on mechanisms related to neural plasticity and drug abuse in adolescence, compared with abundant research using adult animal models. As smoking is typically initiated in adolescence, an important question to address is whether the adolescent brain responds differently to nicotine compared with the adult. To investigate this question, we examined the expression of a number of early response genes (arc, c-fos and NGFI-B) that have been implicated in synaptic plasticity and addiction, following acute nicotine in adolescent and adult rats. Baseline expression of arc and c-fos was higher in adolescent brains compared with adults. Following acute nicotine treatment (0.1, 0.4mg/kg), we found a marked induction of arc mRNA in the prefrontal cortex of nicotine-treated adolescents compared with a less pronounced increase of arc in the adult. c-fos and NGFI-B were also upregulated by nicotine, but not in an age-related manner. In contrast, nicotine induced less arc, c-fos, and NGFI-B expression in the somatosensory cortex of adolescents compared with adults. A fourth gene, quinoid dihydropteridine reductase was expressed at lower levels in white matter of the adolescent forebrain compared with the adult, but was not affected by nicotine. These results suggest that in adolescence, the activity of specific early response genes is higher in brain regions critical for emotional regulation and decision-making. Further, nicotine affects key plasticity molecules in these areas in a manner different from the adult. Thus, adolescence may represent a neurobiologically vulnerable period with regard to nicotine exposure.
Classical phenylketonuria (PKU) (McKusick 261600) is an inborn error of metabolism treated by a controlled low-phenylalanine (Phe) diet started as soon as possible in the first days of life. Such a diet can be achieved with vegetable protein and can be considered non-atherogenic because of the reduction of animal products. Thirty patients with PKU were classified into two groups according to their annual mean Phe levels. Their daily protein intake was largely replaced by PKU2 Milupa which contains a mixture of amino acids. The product has no phenylalanine or fat of any kind. Thirty-eight (38) individuals of comparable age were used as controls. Group A (n = 15) had good compliance with the special diet (Phe mean 192 +/- 115 mumol/L); group B (n = 15) did not strictly adhere to the diet (Phe mean 595 +/- 263 mumol/L). Certain haemostatic components (factors I, VII, VIII, and X, antithrombin III, protein C, and plasminogen) and lipid variables (cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, very-low-density lipoprotein) as well as Phe levels were estimated. All the haemostatic factors studied were found within the normal range with the exception of a significant reduction in protein C in both groups of PKU patients. Furthermore, a statistically significant reduction in factor VII and X concentrations was observed in patients on strict diet. Cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein concentrations were significantly lower in PKU children compared to normal controls. It is suggested that even though the special diet of PKU children, especially in group A, is rich in vegetables, the reduced fat intake might have impaired the absorption of vitamin K and its delivery to the site of synthesis of vitamin K-dependent haemostatic factors.
A genetic transformation method, using in vitro microtubers and Agrobacterium-mediated transformation has been developed for five wild Solanum species: S. verrucosum, S. hjertingii, S. papita, S. stoloniferum, S. demissum, which range in ploidy from diploid to hexaploid. A disarmed A. tumefaciens strain, C58 harbouring the co-integrate vector pGV3580::pKU2 with the genes of neomycin phosphotransferase (NPTII) and hygromycin phosphotransferase (HPTII) as selectable markers, was used. Selection of putative transformants was based on their ability to grow and produce roots on a medium containing 150 mg/l kanamycin. The transgenic nature of the putative transformants was confirmed by Polymerase Chain Reaction analysis and by NPTII dotblot assay to show the expression of the NPTII gene. Additionally, the transmission of transgenes, NPTII and HPTII in selfed-sexual progeny of some transgenic plants was also determined. 
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a phenylalanine-free amino acid-based enteral formula (AA-PKU2) in the treatment of children with phenylketonuria (PKU) aged 1-8 years.
A prospective, open, self-controlled, multi-center trial was performed, enrolling 121 PKU children (1-8 years in age) consecutively between July, 2009 and May, 2011. Enteral nutrition therapy was administered for 32 weeks. The data on blood phenylalanine (PHE) levels, metal development, weight, height, head circumference, serum nutritional biomarkers (total protein, pre-albumin, albumin, total cholesterol, total triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), and measurements from routine blood and urine examinations and from renal and hepatic function tests were collected before the therapy and at 8 weeks and 32 weeks after the therapy and were comparatively analyzed.
The mean blood PHE level at 8 and 32 weeks of AA-PKU2 treatment was 353±253 and 361±280 µmol/L respectively, significantly lower than that before the treatment (487±327 µmol/L; P&lt;0.01). The difference in intelligence quotient scores before and after AA-PKU2 treatment was not significant (P&gt;0.05) when assessed by the Gesell tests in children aged 1-4 years but significant (P&lt;0.01) when assessed by WPPSI or WISR-R tests in children over 4 years. The average height, weight and head circumference at 8 and 32 weeks after treatment were significantly increased as compared to these measurements before treatment (P&lt;0.01) with absolute levels similar to those in the control children. In contrast, the mean values of total protein, pre-albumin, albumin, total cholesterol, total triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol at both time points were not different either from those prior to the treatment or from those in the control children. Mild diarrhea was the adverse events associated with AA-PKU2 treatment, which occurred in 3 (2.5%) cases. All these 3 patients fully recovered without treatment.
The phenylalanine-free amino acid-based formula, AA-PKU2, is effective and safe in controlling blood PHE levels and improving mental development with adequate nutritional support in PKU.
Phenylketonuria (PKU) is the most frequent inherited disorder of amino acid metabolism. In our previous work, we investigated the role of NADPH oxidase (NOX) in a Pahenu2-BTBR PKU mouse model, and an in vitro cell culture model of PKU. In the current study, we evaluated various oxidative stress parameters, namely total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), glutathione (GSH) and maleic dialdehyde (MDA) in the plasma of 40 PKU children, for further investigating the oxidative molecular regulation mechanism of NOX in PKU. It was observed that T-AOC and GSH markedly decreased in PKU as compared with the control group (P&lt;0.01), and seemed to correlate negatively with Phe level. However, there was no statistical difference in MDA level among the three groups. And 8-isoprostane in the blood samples of PKU2 groups was slightly higher than control group (P&lt;0.05). Additionally, mRNA levels of subunits of NOX included p47(phox) and p67(phox) significantly increased in PKU group (P&lt;0.01). These results reflected that NOX is the important source of reactive oxygen species and is involved in the oxidative molecular regulation mechanism in PKU, which shows a new perspective toward understanding the biological underpinnings of PKU. 
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of infant hospitalization worldwide each year and there is presently no licensed vaccine to prevent severe RSV infections. Two major RSV glycoproteins, attachment (G) and fusion (F) protein, regulate viral replication and both proteins contain potential glycosylation sites which are highly variable for the G protein and conserved for the F protein among virus isolates. The RSV F sequence possesses five N-glycosylation sites located in the F2 subunit (N27 and N70), the p27 peptide (N116 and N126) and the F1 subunit (N500). The importance of RSV F N-glycosylation in virus replication and immunogenicity is not yet fully understood, and a better understanding may provide new insights for vaccine development. By using a BAC-based reverse genetics system, recombinant viruses expressing F proteins with loss of N-glycosylation sites were made. Mutant viruses with single N-glycosylation sites removed could be recovered, while this was not possible with the mutant with all N-glycosylation sites removed. Although the individual RSV F N-glycosylation sites were shown not to be essential for viral replication, they do contribute to the efficiency of in vitro and in vivo viral infection. To evaluate the role of N-glycosylation sites on RSV F antigenicity, serum antibody titers were determined after infection of BALB/c mice with RSV expressing the glycomutant F proteins. Infection with recombinant virus lacking the N-glycosylation site at position N116 (RSV F N116Q) resulted in significant higher neutralizing antibody titers compared to RSV F WT infection, which is surprising since this N-glycan is present in the p27 peptide which is assumed to be absent from the mature F protein in virions. Thus, single or combined RSV F glycomutations which affect virus replication and fusogenicity, and which may induce enhanced antibody responses upon immunization could have the potential to improve the efficacy of RSV LAV approaches.
Even in the presence of a successful combination therapy stalling the progress of AIDS, developing a cure for this disease is still an open question. One of the major steps towards a cure would be to be able to eradicate latent HIV reservoirs present in patients. During the last decade, multiple findings point to the dominant role of the viral protein Tat in the establishment of latency. Here we present a mathematical study to understand the potential role of Tat inhibitors as virus-suppressing agents. For this aim, we implemented a computational model that reproduces intracellular dynamics. Simulating an HIV-infected cell and its intracellular feedback we observed that removing Tat protein from the system via inhibitors resulted in a temporary and reversible viral suppression. In contrast, we observed that compounds that interact with Tat protein and disrupt the integrated viral genome produced a more permanent viral suppression.
Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) has been studied in depth and is widely used in the treatment of many kinds of diseases in China. However, whether it has neuroprotec-tive effects on cerebral ischemia remains unclear. An ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury animal model was established via middle cerebral artery occlusion in this study. We set several different groups in which the rats were performed in different ways to explore the effects of TMP on blood-brain-barrier (BBB) disruption and determine whether TMP relieved BBB disruption through blocking the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Our results showed that TMP could reduce the neurological functional loss, decrease the brain edema and BBB permeability, as well as increase the expression of tight junction proteins via inhibiting the activation of JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Overall, we demonstrated that TMP promoted neurological recovery after I/R injury via restoring the integrity and function of BBB.
Despite the lack of a complete understanding of the disparities involved, prostate cancer (PCa) has both higher incidence and death rates in African American Men (AAM) relative to those of Caucasian American Men (CAM). MHC class I polypeptide related sequence A (MICA) is an innate immunity protein involved in tumor immunoevasion. Due to a lack of reports of race-specific expression of MICA in PCa, we evaluated MICA expression in patients' tumors and in cell lines from a racially diverse origin. Immunohistochemistry was done on a tissue microarray (TMA) with antibodies against MICA. Tumor MICA mRNA was assessed by data mining using Oncomine and PROGeneV2. Surface MICA and release rate of soluble (s) MICA was evaluated in PCa cell lines originally derived from African American (MDA-PCa-2b) or Caucasian (LNCaP and DU-145) PCa patients. Prostate tumor tissue had a 1.7-fold higher MICA expression relative to normal tissue (p &lt; .0001). MICA immunoreactivity in PCa tissue from AAM was 24% lower (p = .002) compared to CAM. Survival analysis revealed a marginal association of low MICA with poor overall survival (OS) (p = .058). By data mining analysis, a 2.9-fold higher level of MICA mRNA was evidenced in tumor compared to normal tissue (p &lt; .0001). Tumors from AAM had 24% lower levels of MICA mRNA compared to tumors from CAM (p = .038), and poor prognosis was found for patients with lower MICA mRNA (p = .028). By flow cytometry analysis, cell fraction positive for surface MICA was of 3% in MDA-PCa-2b cells, 54% in DU-145 cells, and 67% in LNCaP cells (p &lt; .0001). sMICA was detected in DU-145 and LNCaP cells, but was not detected in MDA-PCa-2b cells. Both LNCaP and DU-145 cells were sensitive to cytolysis mediated by Natural killer (NK) cells. MDA-PCa-2b cells, however were between 1.3-fold at 10:1 Effector:Target (E:T) ratio (p &lt; .0001) and 2-fold at 50:1 E:T ratio (p &lt; .0001) more resistant to NK-mediated cytolysis relative to cells from Caucasian origin. These results suggest that MICA expression may be related to the aggressive nature of PCa. Our findings also demonstrate for the first time that there are variations in MICA expression in the context of racial differences. This study establishes a rationale for further investigation of MICA as a potential race-specific prognostic marker in PCa.
Erupted and impacted third molars have been reported to contribute to systemic inflammation. This study investigated the systemic effect of third molars on serum levels of inflammatory parameters and on inflammatory messenger peptide hormones in a general population sample.
Data of 2,151 participants from the Study of Health in Pomerania were included in this study. Erupted or impacted third molars were assessed with whole-body magnetic resonance imaging at 1.5 T and associated with biomarkers of inflammation, lipid metabolism, glucose metabolism, and peptide hormones by linear regression. Models were adjusted for age, gender, smoking status, education, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Neither erupted nor impacted third molars were associated with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, or fibrinogen as markers for systemic inflammation. Participants with erupted third molars had markedly lower serum levels of leptin (β coefficient, -2.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], -4.47 to -0.48), angiopoietin-2 (β coefficient, -135.1; 95% CI, 248.6 to -21.5), and ratio of angiopoietin-2 to tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin-like loop epidermal growth factor homology domain 2 (β coefficient, -6.57; 95% CI, -13.06 to -00.7) than participants without third molars. No such associations were observed for impacted third molars.
The present results did not substantiate a relation between third molars and an increase in systemic inflammatory markers. Therefore, dental practitioners should be careful when considering this as the only indication for removal of third molars, especially in medically compromised patients. The results of this study showed that participants with erupted third molars had lower levels of messenger peptide hormones, such as leptin and angiopoetin-2.
In animal models for fragile X syndrome where the gene for fragile X mental retardation protein is knocked out (Fmr1 KO), neurotransmission in multiple brain regions shifts excitation/inhibition balance, resulting in hyperexcitability in neural circuits. Here, using whole-cell recordings from brainstem slices, we investigated synaptic transmission at the medial nucleus of trapezoid body (MNTB, a critical nucleus in the brainstem sound localization circuit), in Fmr1 KO and wild-type (WT) mice 2-3 weeks of age in both sexes. Surprisingly, neither synaptic excitation nor inhibition in KO neurons was significantly changed. The synaptic strength, kinetics, and short-term plasticity of synaptic excitation remained largely unaltered. Subtle differences were observed in response patterns, with KO neurons displaying less all-or-none eEPSCs. Similarly, synaptic inhibition mediated by glycine and GABA remains largely unchanged, except for a slower kinetics of mixed sIPSCs. In pharmacologically isolated glycinergic and GABAergic inhibition, no significant differences in synaptic strength and kinetics were detected between the two genotypes. These results demonstrate that at the cellular level synaptic transmission at MNTB is largely unaffected in Fmr1 KO mice by 2-3 weeks after birth, suggesting the existence of compensatory mechanisms that maintain the inhibitory output of MNTB to its targets in the auditory brainstem.
The present investigation was aimed to develop a rabbit model for protecting the rabbit eye from systematically induced precorneal tear film (PTF) damage, evaluation of carboxymethyl pullulan for its protective action against PTF damage and its curative potential. For the same, pullulan was modified by carboxymethylation and structural modification was confirmed by spectral attributes. Further, the carboxymethyl pullulan (CMP) solutions (0.1-2.0%, w/v) were evaluated for their physical properties and its concentration 1.5% (w/v) was found to fit the criterion to prepare an eye solution. The safety and non-toxicity of CMP (1.5%, w/v) eye solution was confirmed by HET-CAM method and rabbit eye irritation test. Further, a systematic rabbit eye model was developed that mimic PTF damage in day to day life. Therefore, three levels of PTF damage were developed equating symptoms of damage due to high temperature (level I) or long term mobile use (level II) or heavy air pollution (level III). Thus, a representative model with benzalkonium chloride (BAC, 0.1% v/v, 0.2% v/v and 0.3% v/v), administered two drops twice a day for two days to develop level I, level II and level III eye damage. The CMP (1.5%, w/v) eye solution possessed a protective potential against level I and II PTF damage. The rabbit eyes remained unharmed and comparable with the normal control during the complete experimental period. Additionally, CMP (1.5%, w/v) eye solution has shown early fast recovery (8 days) from PTF damage induced by instillation of PTF damage agent (BAC). Carboxymethyl pullulan eye protective solution has normalized the tear film stability in rabbit eye model. It is established from the present work that, carboxymethyl pullulan has protective action against precorneal tear film damage and it potentiates the early recovery too.
Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) has been implicated in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD); the most common cause of chronic liver diseases. There is accumulating evidence that altered TLR4 and Sphingosine kinase 1(SphK1)/sphingosine1phosphate (S1P) signaling pathways are key players in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Cross talk of the sphingosine signaling pathway, toll-4 (TLR4) receptors, and angiotensin II was reported in various tissues. Therefore, the aim of this study was to define the contribution of these two pathways to the hepatoprotective effects of telmisartan and/or chlorogenic acid (CGA) in NAFLD. CGA is a strong antioxidant that was previously reported to inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme. Male Wistar rats were treated with either high-fructose, with or without telmisartan, CGA, telmisartan + CGA for 8 weeks. Untreated NAFL rats showed characteristics of NAFLD, as evidenced by significant increase in the body weight, insulin resistance, and serum hepatotoxicity markers (Alanine and Aspartate transaminases) and lipids as compared to the negative control group, in addition to characteristic histopathological alterations. Treatment with either telmisartan and/or CGA improved aforementioned parameters, in addition to upregulation of antioxidant enzymes (Superoxide dismutase and Glutathione peroxidase). Effect of inhibiting RAS on both sphingosine pathway and TLR4 was evident by the suppressing effect of telmisartan and/or CGA on high fructose-induced upregulation of hepatic SPK1 and S1P, in addition to concomitant up-regulation of Sphingosine-1-Phosphate receptor (S1PR)3 protein level and increased expression of S1PR1 and TLR4. As TLR4 and SPK/S1P signaling pathways play important roles in the progression of liver inflammation, the effect on sphingosine pathway and TLR4 was associated with decreased concentrations of inflammatory markers, enzyme kB kinase (IKK), nuclear factor-kB and tumor necrosis factor-α as compared to untreated NAFL group. In conclusion, the present data strongly suggests the cross-talk between angiotensin, the Sphingosine SPK/S1P Axis and TLR4 Receptors, and their role in the pathogenesis of fructose-induced NAFLD, and the protection afforded by drugs inhibiting RAS.
Toxoplasma gondii has evolved many successful strategies for immune evasion. However, the parasite-derived effectors involved in modulating NF-κB signalling pathway are largely unknown. T. gondii Cathepsin C1 (CPC1) is widely conserved among T. gondii strains and is important for T. gondii intracellular growth and proliferation. Our study showed that CPC1 protein could abrogate NF-κB activation after screening dense granule proteins. CPC1 suppressed NF-κB activation at or downstream of p65 and decreased the production of IL-1, IL-8, IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-α. Western blot analysis revealed that CPC1 inhibited phospho-p65 and CPC1 proteins primarily settled in cytoplasm. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that overexpression of CPC1 significantly upregulated erythropoietin (EPO), which can be induced by the hypoxia-inducible factor -1α (HIF-1α) during hypoxia. Furthermore, dual-luciferase reporter assays confirmed that CPC1 upregulated HIF-1α. Finally, both the knockdown of EPO and restriction of HIF-1α partially eliminated the suppression impact of CPC1 on the NF-κB signalling pathway. Our study identified a previously unrecognized role of CPC1 in the negative regulation of NF-κB activation through positive regulation of the HIF-1α/EPO axis. For the first time, CPC1 was shown to play an important role in immune evasion during T. gondii infection.
To elucidate the structures and dynamics of membrane proteins, highly advanced biophysical methods have been developed that often require significant resources, both for sample preparation and experimental analyses. For very complex systems, such as membrane transporters, ion channels or GPCRs, the incorporation of a single reporter at a select site can significantly simplify the observables and the measurement/analysis requirements. Here we present examples using 19F NMR spectroscopy as a powerful, yet relatively straightforward tool to study (membrane) protein structure, dynamics and ligand interactions. We summarize methods to incorporate 19F labels into proteins and discuss the type of information that can be readily obtained for membrane proteins already from relatively simple NMR spectra with a focus on GPCRs as the membrane protein family most extensively studied by this technique. In the future, these approaches may be of particular interest also for many proteins that undergo complex functional dynamics and/or contain unstructured regions and thus are not amenable to X-ray crystallography or cryo electron microscopy studies.
Meiosis is critical for sexual reproduction and the generation of new allelic variations in most eukaryotes. In this study, we report the isolation of a meiotic gene, DLC1, using a map-based cloning strategy. The dlc1 mutant is sterile in both male and female gametophytes due to an earlier defect in the leptotene chromosome and subsequent abnormalities at later stages. DLC1 is strongly expressed in the pollen mother cells (PMCs) and tapetum and encodes a nucleus-located rice type-B response regulator (RR) with transcriptional activity. Further investigations show that DLC1 interacts with all five putative rice histidine phosphotransfer proteins (HPs) in yeast and planta cells, suggesting a possible participation of the two-component signalling systems (TCS) in rice meiosis. Our results demonstrate that DLC1 is required for rice meiosis and fertility, providing useful information for the role of TCS in rice meiosis. This article is protected by copyright.

Hongkong kumquat (Fortunella hindsii) is a wild citrus species characterized by dwarf plant height and early flowering. Here, we identified the monoembryonic F. hindsii (designated as "Mini-Citrus") for the first time and constructed its selfing lines. This germplasm constitutes an ideal model for the genetic and functional genomics studies of citrus, which have been severely hindered by the long juvenility and inherent apomixes of citrus. F. hindsii showed a very short juvenile period (~8 months) and stable monoembryonic phenotype under cultivation. We report the first de novo assembled 373.6 Mb genome sequences (Contig-N50 2.2 Mb and Scaffold-N50 5.2 Mb) for F. hindsii. In total, 32,257 protein-coding genes were annotated, 96.9% of which had homologues in other eight Citrinae species. The phylogenomic analysis revealed a close relationship of F. hindsii with cultivated citrus varieties, especially with mandarin. Furthermore, the CRISPR/Cas9 system was demonstrated to be an efficient strategy to generate target mutagenesis on F. hindsii. The modifications of target genes in the CRISPR-modified F. hindsii were predominantly 1-bp insertions or small deletions. This genetic transformation system based on F. hindsii could shorten the whole process from explant to T1 mutant to about 15 months. Overall, due to its short juvenility, monoembryony, close genetic background to cultivated citrus and applicability of CRISPR, F. hindsii shows unprecedented potentials to be used as a model species for citrus research.

Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of proteins are central in any kind of cellular signaling. Modern mass spectrometry technologies enable comprehensive identification and quantification of various PTMs. Given the increased numbers and types of mapped protein modifications, a database is necessary that simultaneously integrates and compares site-specific information for different PTMs, especially in plants for which the available PTM data are poorly catalogued. Here, we present the Plant PTM Viewer (http://www.psb.ugent.be/PlantPTMViewer), an integrative PTM resource that comprises approximately 370,000 PTM sites for 19 types of protein modifications in plant proteins from five different species. The Plant PTM Viewer provides the user with a protein sequence overview in which the experimentally evidenced PTMs are highlighted together with an estimate of the confidence by which the modified peptides and, if possible, the actual modification sites were identified and with functional protein domains or active site residues. The PTM sequence search tool can query PTM combinations in specific protein sequences, whereas the PTM BLAST tool searches for modified protein sequences to detect conserved PTMs in homologous sequences. Taken together, these tools help to assume the role and potential interplay of PTMs in specific proteins or within a broader systems biology context. The Plant PTM Viewer is an open repository that allows the submission of mass spectrometry-based PTM data to remain at pace with future PTM plant studies. This article is protected by copyright.

This paper aimed to study the possible involvement of adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in the detoxification of quantum dots (QDs) in human breast carcinoma (SK-BR-3) cells. The effects of QD sizes on such interactions were also evaluated. For this purpose, we used monodispersed MPA-COOH-CdTe QDs with different diameters (emission length at 560 and 625 nm, named as QD-560 and QD-625). Such QDs tended to accumulate in cells and cause significant toxicity. Using specific inhibitors of ABC transporters, the cellular accumulation and toxicity of QDs in SK-BR-3 cells were significantly affected. Moreover, treatment of QDs caused concentration- and time-dependent induction of ABC transporters. Furthermore, the induction effects of smaller QDs were found to be greater than larger ones at equivalent concentrations, suggesting a size-dependent recognition of substrates by ABC transporters. Overall, these results provided important support for the modulation of QDs toxicity by ABC transporters.
Activation of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) combined with persistent hypoxia are often affecting the tumor microenvironment. Disruption of cadherin/catenin complexes induced by these stimulations yields aberrant extracellular matrix (ECM) production, characteristics of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), the hallmark of the response to hypoxia, play differential roles during development of diseases. Recent studies show that localization of cadherin/catenin complexes at the cell membrane might be tightly regulated by protein phosphatase activity. We aimed to investigate the role of stabilized HIF1α expression via protein phosphatase activity on dissociation of the E-cadherin/β-catenin complex and aberrant ECM expression in lung cancer cells under stimulation by TGFβ. By using lung cancer cells treated with HIF1α stabilizers or carrying doxycycline-dependent HIF1α deletion or point mutants, we investigated the role of stabilized HIF1α expression on TGFβ-induced EMT in lung cancer cells. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms were determined by inhibition of protein phosphatase activity. Persistent stimulation by TGFβ and hypoxia induced the EMT phenotypes in H358 cells in which stabilized HIF1α expression was inhibited. Stabilized HIF1α protein expression inhibited the TGFβ-stimulated appearance of EMT phenotypes across cell types and species, independent of de novo vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) expression. Inhibition of protein phosphatase A2 activity abrogated the HIF1α-induced repression of TGFβ-stimulated appearance of EMT phenotypes. This is the first study to demonstrate a direct role of stabilized HIF1α expression on inhibition of TGFβ-induced EMT phenotypes in lung cancer cells, in part via protein phosphatase activity.

Cartap hydrochloride is a mildly perilous insecticide known as "Padan" which is used largely in agricultural farms to control weevil and caterpillars. The over use of cartap causes harmful effects on human health. Since the blood may acts as a target and carrier for insecticides, the effect of these compounds on blood in mammalian toxicology is very important. Hemoglobin is a tetramer protein that play critical role in oxygen transport. The aim of this study was to analyze and compare the function and structural changes of hemoglobin in the presence of different concentrations of cartap by employing different spectroscopic techniques. The obtained results show that cartap has a high hemolytic effect which is increased with cartap concentration and reduces the thermal midpoint of hemoglobin. Fluorescence measurements reveal heme degradation at different concentrations of cartap. In consequence of theoretical and experimental results, cartap has an undesirable effect on hemoglobin structure and function.
Cryptorchidism is associated with changes in the gonads and the spermatic duct system, which may cause infertility problems. Urocortin (UCN) is a corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH)-related peptide, which affects several functions of male genital organs. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of UCN and its receptors CRHR1 and CRHR2 using immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in tissues collected from the epididymis of normal and cryptorchid dogs. The lumen of the cryptic epididymal duct was found to be relatively smaller than that of the normal one, and interstitial tissue was abundant in the cryptic epididymis. In addition, only a few spermatids were observed in the lumen of the epididymal duct. Results showed that UCN, CRHR2, and CRHR1 were expressed in tissues collected from normal and cryptic epididymal ducts. UCN- and CRHR2-immunoreactivities (IRs) were detected in the principal cells of the caput, corpus, and cauda of the normal and cryptic epididymides. CRHR1-IR was detected in vascular smooth muscles and fibromuscular cells surrounding epididymal tubules of the normal and cryptorchid dogs. Expression levels of UCN and CRHR2 mRNA were higher in cryptic epidydimal ducts than that in normal epidydimal ducts. These results suggest that UCN and its receptors might play a role in regulating the maturation and storage of spermatozoa. These findings indicated that the expression of these proteins could be modulated by the cryptorchidism condition. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
The mechanisms by which alterations in intestinal bile acid (BA) metabolism improve systemic glucose tolerance and hepatic metabolic homeostasis are incompletely understood. Here we examined metabolic adaptations in mice with conditional intestinal deletion of the abetalipoproteinemia (ABL) gene microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (Mttp-IKO), which blocks chylomicron assembly and impairs intestinal lipid transport. Mttp-IKO mice exhibit improved hepatic glucose metabolism and augmented insulin signaling, without weight loss. These adaptations included decreased BA excretion, increased pool size, altered BA composition and increased Fgf15 production. Mttp-IKO mice absorb fructose normally, but are protected against dietary fructose-induced hepatic steatosis, without weight loss or changes in energy expenditure. In addition, Mttp-IKO mice exhibit altered cecal microbial communities, both at baseline and also following fructose feeding, including increased abundance of Bacteroides and Lactobacillus genera. Transplantation of cecal microbiota from chow-fed Mttp-IKO mice into antibiotic-treated wild-type recipients conferred transmissible protection against fructose-induced hepatic steatosis in association with a bloom in Akkermansia and increased Clostridium XIVa genera, whose abundance was positively correlated with fecal coprostanol and total neutral sterol excretion in recipient mice. However, antibiotic treated Mttp-IKO mice were still protected against fructose induced hepatic steatosis, suggesting that changes in microbiota are not required for this phenotype. Nevertheless, we found increased abundance of fecal Akkermansia from two adult ABL subjects with MTTP mutations, compared to their heterozygous parents and within the range noted in six healthy control subjects. Furthermore, Akkermansia abundance across all subjects was positively correlated with fecal coprostanol excretion. CONCLUSION: The findings collectively suggest multiple adaptive pathways of metabolic regulation following blocked chylomicron assembly, including shifts in BA signaling and altered microbial composition that confer a transmissible phenotype.

Nuclear translocation of SMAD2/3, core transcription factors of TGFβ signaling, is critical for hepatic stellate cell (HSC) differentiation into metastasis-promoting myofibroblasts. SMAD2/3 have multiple coactivators, including WW domain-containing transcription regulator protein 1 (WWTR1 or TAZ) and p300 acetyltransferase. In the nucleus, TAZ binds to SMAD2/3 to prevent SMAD2/3 nuclear export. However, how TAZ and SMAD2/3 enter the nucleus remains poorly understood because neither contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS), an amino acid sequence tagging proteins for nuclear transport. P300 is a NLS-containing large scaffold protein so we hypothesized that SMAD2/3 and TAZ may undergo nuclear import through complexing with p300. Coimmunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and nuclear fractionation assays revealed that TGFβ1 promoted binding of SMAD2/3 and TAZ to p300 and that p300 inactivation disrupted TGFβ1-mediated SMAD2/3 and TAZ nuclear accumulation. Deleting the p300 NLS blocked TGFβ1-induced SMAD2/3 and TAZ nuclear transport. Consistently, p300 inactivation suppressed TGFβ1-mediated HSC activation and transcription of genes encoding tumor-promoting factors, such as CTGF, TNC, POSTN, PDGFC, and FGF2, as revealed by microarray analysis. ChIP-qPCR showed that canonical p300-mediated acetylation of histones also facilitated transcription in response to TGFβ1 stimulation. Interestingly, although both TGFβ1- and stiffness-mediated HSC activation require p300, comparison of gene expression datasets revealed that transcriptional targets of TGFβ1 were distinct from those of stiffness-p300 mechanosignaling. Lastly, in tumor/HSC coinjection and intrasplenic tumor injection models, targeting p300 of activated-HSC/myofibroblasts by C646, shRNA, or cre-mediated gene disruption reduced tumor and liver metastatic growth in mice. CONCLUSION: P300 facilitates TGFβ1-stimulated HSC activation by both non-canonical (cytoplasm-to-nucleus shuttle for SMAD2/3 and TAZ) and canonical (histone acetylation) mechanisms. P300 is an attractive target for inhibiting HSC activation and the prometastatic liver microenvironment. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
Nivolumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor that acts by preventing programmed-death ligand 1 (PD-L1) from binding to the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) receptor,1 is utilized to treat a variety of cancers including renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and metastatic melanoma. Currently, nivolumab is FDA-approved as a second-line treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after showing efficacy in patients who progressed on or were intolerant to sorafenib.

Alpha-synuclein (aSyn) is a central player in Parkinson's disease (PD) and in a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases collectively known as synucleinopathies. The protein was first associated with PD just over 20 years ago, when it was found to (i) be a major component of Lewy bodies and, (ii) to be also associated with familial forms of PD. The characterization of aSyn pathology has been achieved through postmortem studies of human brains. However, the identification of toxic mechanisms associated with aSyn was only achieved through the use of experimental models. In vitro models are highly accessible, enable relatively rapid studies, and have been extensively employed to address aSyn-associated neurodegeneration. Given the diversity of models used and the outcomes of the studies, a cumulative and comprehensive perspective emerges as indispensable to pave the way for further investigations. Here, we sub-divided in vitro models of aSyn pathology into three major types: (i) models simulating aSyn fibrillization and the formation of different aggregated structures in vitro, (ii) models based on the intracellular expression of aSyn, reporting on pathogenic conditions and cellular dysfunctions induced, and (iii) models using extracellular treatment with aSyn aggregated species, reporting on sites of interaction and their downstream consequences. In summary, we review the underlying molecular mechanisms discovered and categorize protective strategies, in order to pave the way for future studies and the identification of effective therapeutic strategies.

Plant cells sheath themselves in a complex lattice of polysaccharides, proteins, and enzymes forming an integral matrix known as the cell wall. Cellulose microfibrils, the primary component of cell walls, are synthesized at the plasma membrane by CELLULOSE SYNTHASE A (CESA) proteins throughout cellular growth and are responsible for turgor-driven anisotropic expansion. Associations between hormone signaling and cell wall biosynthesis have long been suggested, but recently direct links have been found revealing hormones play key regulatory roles in cellulose biosynthesis. The radially swollen 1 (rsw1) allele of Arabidopsis thaliana CESA1 harbors a single amino acid change that renders the protein unstable at high temperatures. We used the conditional nature of rsw1 to investigate how auxin contributes to isotropic growth. We found that exogenous auxin treatment reduces isotropic swelling in rsw1 roots at the restrictive temperature of 30oC. We also discovered decreases in auxin influx between rsw1 and wild-type roots via confocal imaging of AUX1-YFP, even at the permissive temperature of 19oC. Moreover, rsw1 displayed mis-expression of auxin-responsive and CESA genes. Additionally, we found altered auxin maxima in rsw1 mutant roots at the onset of swelling using DII-VENUS and DR5:vYFP auxin reporters. Overall, we conclude disrupted cell wall biosynthesis perturbs auxin transport leading to altered auxin homeostasis impacting both anisotropic and isotropic growth that affects overall root morphology.
Cdc50 is the non-catalytic subunit of the flippase that establishes phospholipid asymmetry in membranes and functions in vesicle-mediated trafficking in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we have identified the homologous gene CaCDC50 that encodes a protein of 396 amino acids with two conserved transmembrane domains in Candida albicans. Deletion of CaCDC50 results in C. albicans cells becoming sensitive to the antifungal drugs azoles, terbinafine and caspofungin, as well as to the membrane-perturbing agent sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). We also show that CaCDC50 is involved in both endocytosis and vacuolar function. CaCDC50 confers tolerance to high concentrations of cations, although it is not required for osmolar response. Moreover, deletion of CaCDC50 leads to severe defects in hyphal development of C. albicans cells and highly attenuated virulence in the mouse model of systemic infection. Therefore, CaCdc50 regulates cellular responses to antifungal drugs, cell membrane stress, endocytosis, filamentation and virulence in the human fungal pathogen C. albicans.
Although transcriptome changes have long been recognized as a mechanism to induce tentative substitution of expressed genes in diverse biological processes in plants, the regulation of translation-the final step of the central dogma of molecular biology-emerged as an alternative and prominent layer in defining the output of genes. Despite these demands, the genome-wide analysis of protein synthesis has posed technical challenges, resulting in the plant translatome being poorly understood. The development of ribosome profiling promises to address the hidden aspects of translation, and its application to plants is revolutionizing our knowledge of the translatome. This review outlines the array of recent findings provided by ribosome profiling and illustrates the power of the versatile technique in green organisms.
Pancreatic β-cells undergo profound hyperplasia during pregnancy to maintain maternal euglycemia. Failure to reprogram β-cells into a more replicative state has been found to underlie susceptibility to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). We recently identified a requirement for prolactin receptor (PRLR) signaling in the metabolic adaptations to pregnancy, where β-cell-specific PRLR knockout (βPRLRKO) mice exhibit a metabolic phenotype consistent with GDM. However, the underlying transcriptional program that is responsible for the PRLR-dependent metabolic adaptations during gestation remains incompletely understood. To identify PRLR signaling gene regulatory networks and target genes within β-cells during pregnancy, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of pancreatic islets isolated from either βPRLRKO mice or littermate controls in late gestation. Gene set enrichment analysis identified forkhead box protein M1 and polycomb repressor complex 2 subunits, Suz12 and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2), as novel candidate regulators of PRLR-dependent β-cell adaptation. Gene ontology term pathway enrichment revealed both established and novel PRLR signaling target genes that together promote a state of increased cellular metabolism and/or proliferation. In contrast to the requirement for β-cell PRLR signaling in maintaining euglycemia during pregnancy, PRLR target genes were not induced following high-fat diet feeding. Collectively, the current study expands our understanding of which transcriptional regulators and networks mediate gene expression required for islet adaptation during pregnancy. The current work also supports the presence of pregnancy-specific adaptive mechanisms distinct from those activated by nutritional stress.
IFT74 is a component of the core intraflagellar transport (IFT) complex, a bidirectional movement of large particles along the axoneme microtubules for cilia formation. In this study, we investigated its role in sperm flagella formation and discovered that mice deficiency in Ift74 gene in male germ cells were infertile associated with low sperm count and immotile sperm. The few developed spermatozoa displayed misshaped heads and short tails. Transmission electron microscopy revealed abnormal flagellar axoneme in the seminiferous tubules where sperm are made. Clusters of unassembled microtubules were present in the spermatids. Testicular expression levels of IFT27, IFT57, IFT81, IFT88 and IFT140 proteins were significantly reduced in the conditional Ift74 mutant mice, with the exception of IFT20 and IFT25. The levels of outer dense fiber 2 (ODF2) and sperm-associated antigen 16L (SPAG16L) proteins were also not changed. However, the processed A-Kinase anchor protein (AKAP), a major component of the fibrous sheath, a unique structure of sperm tail, was significantly reduced. Our study demonstrates that IFT74 is essential for mouse sperm formation, probably through assembly of the core axoneme and fibrous sheath, and suggests that IFT74 may be a potential genetic factor affecting male reproduction in man.
Network visualizations of complex biological datasets usually result in 'hairball' images, which do not discriminate network modules.
We present the EntOptLayout Cytoscape plug-in based on a recently developed network representation theory. The plug-in provides an efficient visualization of network modules, which represent major protein complexes in protein-protein interaction and signalling networks. Importantly, the tool gives a quality score of the network visualization by calculating the information loss between the input data and the visual representation showing a 3- to 25-fold improvement over conventional methods.
The plug-in (running on Windows, Linux, or Mac OS) and its tutorial (both in written and video forms) can be downloaded freely under the terms of the MIT license from: http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/entoptlayout.

Sulforaphane (SFN), a dietary isothiocyanate that is mainly found in cruciferous vegetables, possesses anti-oxidative and anticancer activity and modulates inflammation. However, little is known about the role of SFN in obesity-related male reproductive defects. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of SFN on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced male spermatogenic impairment and further clarify the possible underlying mechanisms. In this study, 8-week-old mice were randomly divided into four groups. Mice were fed a normal diet or an HFD with or without SFN supplementation. SFN was subcutaneously injected at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg 5 days/week for 4 weeks beginning 8 weeks after initiation of the HFD. The results demonstrated that SFN could protect against HFD-induced reproductive dysfunction in male mice. Moreover, SFN also improved reproductive ability, as demonstrated by an increased pregnancy rate and decreased embryo resorption rate in comparison to the corresponding HFD group. We also observed a decrease in apoptosis and an attenuation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress after SFN treatment. In vitro studies of mouse and human sperm samples also revealed that SFN protects against the palmitic acid-induced reduction in sperm viability and motility by inhibiting ER stress in an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent manner. AMPK-dependent ER stress attenuation by SFN was further confirmed using AMPK knockout mice. Taken together, these data show that SFN protects against HFD-induced male reproductive dysfunction by inhibiting ER stress and apoptosis. These findings may be helpful for identifying new therapeutic methods to treat male infertility.
Growth differentiation factor 8 (GDF8), also known as myostatin, is a member of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family and has been identified as a strong physiological regulator of muscle differentiation. Recently, the functional role of GDF8 in reproductive organs has received increased interest following its detection in the human placenta and uterus. To investigate the effects of GDF8 during porcine oocyte in vitro maturation (IVM), we assessed the quality of matured oocytes. Furthermore, we investigated the specific gene transcription and protein activation levels in oocytes and cumulus cells (CCs) after IVM and subsequent embryonic development after in vitro fertilization (IVF) and parthenogenetic activation (PA). Prior to these experiments, the concentration of GDF8 in porcine follicular fluid was determined. During the entire IVM period, 1.3 ng/mL GDF8 and its signaling inhibitor SB431542 (SB) at 5 μM were added as control, SB, SB + GDF8, and GDF8 groups, respectively. Our results demonstrate that supplementation with GDF8 during porcine oocyte IVM enhanced both meiotic and cytoplasmic maturation, with altered transcriptional patterns, via activation of Sma- and Mad-related protein 2/3 (SMAD2/3). Using the pharmacological inhibitor SB431542, we demonstrated that inhibition of GDF8-induced Smad2/3 signaling reduces matured oocyte quality. In conclusion, for the first time, we demonstrated paracrine factor GDF8 in porcine follicular fluid in vivo. Furthermore, we showed that GDF8 supplementation improved mature oocyte quality by regulating p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation and intracellular glutathione (GSH) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels during porcine IVM.
Riemerella anatipestifer(RA) is a gram-negative bacterium that has a high potential to infect waterfowl. Although more and more genomes of RA have been generated comparative genomic analysis of RA still remains at the level of individual species. In this study, we analyzed the pan-genome of 27 RA virulent isolates to reveal the intraspecies genomic diversity from various aspects. The multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis suggests that the geographic origin of R. anatipestifer is Guangdong province, China. Results of pan-genome analysis revealed an open pan-genome for all 27 species with the sizes of 2,967 genes. We identified 387 genes among 555 unique genes originated by horizontal gene transfer. Further studies showed 204 strain-specific HGT genes were predicted as virulent proteins. Screening the 1,113 core genes in RA through subtractive genomic approach, 70 putative vaccine targets out of 125 non-cytoplasmic proteins have been predicted. Further analysis of these non A. platyrhynchos homologous proteins predicted that 56 essential proteins as drug target with more interaction partners were involved in unique metabolic pathways of RA. In conclusion, the present study indicated the essence and the diversity of RA, and also provides useful information for identification of vaccine and drugs candidates in future.

We report the recombinant preparation from Escherichia coli cells of samples of two closely related, small, secreted cysteine-rich plant peptides: Rapid ALkalinization Factor-1 (RALF1) and Rapid ALkalinization Factor-8 (RALF8). Purified samples of the native sequence of RALF8 exhibited well-resolved NMR spectra and also biological activity through interaction with a plant receptor kinase, cytoplasmic calcium mobilization, and in vivo root growth suppression. By contrast, RALF1 could only be isolated from inclusion bodies as a construct containing an N-terminal His-tag; its poorly resolved NMR spectrum was indicative of aggregation. We prepared samples of the RALF8 peptide labeled with 15 N and 13 C for NMR analysis and obtained near complete 1 H, 13 C, and 15 N NMR assignments, determined the disulfide pairing of its four cysteine residues, and examined its solution structure. RALF8 is mostly disordered except for the two loops spanned by each of its two disulfide bridges. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
The use of bioactive proteins such as keratin has been successfully explored to improve the biological interface of scaffolds with cells during the tissue regeneration. In this work, it is optimized the fabrication of nanofibers combining wool keratin extracted by sulfitolysis, with polycaprolactone (PCL) in order to design bicomponent fibrous matrices able to exert a self-adapting pattern of signals - morphological, chemical or physical - confined at the single fiber level, to influence cell and bacteria interactions. It is demonstrated that the blending of highly polydisperse keratin with PCL (50:50) improves the stability of the electrospinning process, promoting the formation of nanofibers - 144.1 ± 43.9 nm - without the formation of defects (i.e.., beads, ribbons) typically recognized in the fabrication of keratin ones. Moreover, keratin drastically increases the fiber hydrophilicity - compared with PCL fiber alone - thus improving the hMSC adhesion and in vitro proliferation until 14 days. Moreover, the growth of bacterial strains (i.e., Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus) seems to be not specifically inhibited by the contribution of keratin, so that the integration of further selected compounds (i.e., metal ions) is suggested to more efficiently fight against bacteria resistance, to make them suitable for the regeneration of different interface and soft tissues (i.e., skin, cornea).

JBTS17 is a major gene mutated in ciliopathies such as Joubert syndrome and oral-facial-digital syndrome type VI. Most patients with loss of function mutations in JBTS17 exhibit cerebellar vermis hypoplasia and brain stem malformation. However, some patients with JBTS17 mutations show microcephaly and abnormal gyration. We examined potential roles of JBTS17 in neurogenesis to understand the pathological mechanism of JBTS17-related cortical abnormalities.
We examined subcellular localization and cell cycle-dependent expression of JBTS17 proteins using anti-JBTS17 antibodies and JBTS17 expression vectors. We also performed knockdown experiments to determined roles of JBTS17 in human cells, and demonstrated mitotic functions of JBTS17 using immunostaining and live imaging. We examined the involvement of JBTS17 in cortical neurogenesis using mouse in utero electroporation technique.
We found that JBTS17 localizes to the kinetochore and the level of JBTS17 is regulated by cell cycle-dependent proteolysis. Depletion of JBTS17 disrupts chromosome alignment and spindle pole orientation, resulting in mitotic delay. JBTS17 interacts with LIS1 and influences LIS1 localization. Depletion of Jbts17 in the developing mouse cortex interferes with the mitotic progression of neural progenitors and the migration of postmitotic neurons.
LIS1 is implicated in lissencephaly, but altered dosage of LIS1 has been also associated with microcephaly syndromes. Our results suggest that JBTS17 contributes to mitotic progression by interacting with LIS1, and abnormal mitosis is an underlying mechanism of the microcephaly phenotype in JBTS17-related ciliopathies. We propose that understanding extraciliary roles of ciliopathy proteins is important to elucidate pathological mechanisms underlying diverse ciliopathy phenotypes.

Eptifibatide (EPT) is a cyclic heptapeptide derived from a protein found in the venom of the south-eastern pygmy rattle snake used as an antiplatelet drug. In this study, a newly developed HPLC method demonstrating no interference from the different degradation products of EPT has been optimized and validated. The method was based on HPLC separation of eptifibatide from its degradation products using reversed phase C18 column at ambient temperature with mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile: 50 mM sodium dihydrogen orthophosphate dihydrate, pH was adjusted to 2.2 with orthophosphoric acid (25:75 v/v). Quantitation was achieved with UV detection at 220 nm based on peak area. The proposed method was validated according to the ICH guidelines and applied to evaluate the stability of EPT under different stress conditions including temperature, oxidation and hydrolysis over wide pH range (2-10). Moreover, kinetic study of EPT oxidation and its hydrolysis at pH 10 was demonstrated. The proposed method was successfully applied to quantify EPT in bulk powder and in pharmaceutical formulation with a runtime shorter than all the reported methods.
Regulatory RNAs, present in many bacterial genomes and particularly in pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, control the expression of genes encoding virulence factors or metabolic proteins. They are extremely diverse and include noncoding RNAs (sRNA), antisense RNAs, and some 5' or 3' untranslated regions of messenger RNAs that act as sensors for metabolites, tRNAs, or environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, pH). In this review we focus on specific examples of sRNAs of S. aureus that illustrate how numerous sRNAs and associated proteins are embedded in complex networks of regulation. In addition, we discuss the CRISPR-Cas systems defined as an RNA-interference-like mechanism, which also exist in staphylococcal strains.
The main strategies used by pathogenic bacteria to infect eukaryotic tissue include their adherence to cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM), the subsequent colonization and invasion as well as the evasion of immune defences. A variety of structurally and functionally characterized adhesins and binding proteins of gram-positive bacteria facilitate these processes by specifically recognizing and interacting with various components of the host ECM, including different collagens, fibronectin and other macromolecules. The ECM affects the cellular physiology of our body and is critical for adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation of many host cell types, but also provides the support for infiltrating pathogens, particularly under conditions of injury and trauma. Moreover, microbial binding to a variety of adhesive components in host tissue fluids leads to structural and/or functional alterations of host proteins and to the activation of cellular mechanisms that influence tissue and cell invasion of pathogens. Since the diverse interactions of gram-positive bacteria with the ECM represent important pathogenicity mechanisms, their characterization not only allows a better understanding of microbial invasion but also provides clues for the design of novel therapeutic strategies to manage infectious diseases.
Obesity is a likely risk factor for asthma. However, underlying mechanisms by which obesity affects asthma activity remain poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the role of leptin, an adipocyte-derived proinflammatory protein, as a mediator in the association between body adiposity (assessed using BMI, waist circumference, and body fat percentage) and persistent asthma.
A causal approach to mediation analysis was used to disentangle total and direct effects and the indirect effect mediated by leptin, using data from the French prospective French Epidemiological Study on the Genetics and Environment of Asthma (EGEA) (baseline: 2003-2007; follow-up: 2011-2013; mean follow-up time: 7 years). A total of 331 participants with current asthma at baseline were included.
Per 1-SD increment in BMI, waist circumference, and body fat percentage, the adjusted odds ratios of the total effect were 1.59 (95% CI: 0.95-2.97), 2.06 (1.06-4.00), and 3.25 (1.01-9.41), respectively; the odds ratios of the indirect effect mediated by leptin were 1.68 (1.09-2.46), 1.55 (0.99-2.57), and 1.99 (0.94-4.83), respectively.
Leptin partly (&gt; 60%) mediated the association between high body adiposity and persistent asthma over time. Using a newly developed analytic approach, this longitudinal study brought new insight into one mechanism by which obesity may affect asthma activity.
Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is an important regulator of fibrogenesis in many organs. This study evaluated the interrelationship among adipose tissue CTGF expression, fat mass, and insulin resistance in humans.
This study examined (1) CTGF gene expression in human subcutaneous preadipocytes before and after inducing adipogenesis; (2) relationships among abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue CTGF gene expression, body fat mass, and indices of insulin sensitivity, including the hepatic insulin sensitivity index and the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure in conjunction with stable isotope glucose tracer infusion, in 72 people who had marked differences in adiposity and insulin sensitivity; (3) localization of CTGF protein in subcutaneous adipose tissue; and (4) effect of progressive (5%, 11%, and 16%) weight loss on adipose tissue CTGF gene expression.
CTGF was highly expressed in preadipocytes, not adipocytes. Adipose tissue CTGF expression was strongly correlated with body fat mass and both skeletal muscle and liver insulin sensitivity, and CTGF-positive cells were predominantly found in areas of fibrosis. Progressive weight loss caused a stepwise decrease in adipose tissue CTGF expression.
It was concluded that increased CTGF expression is associated with adipose tissue expansion, adipose tissue fibrosis, and multi-organ insulin resistance in people with obesity.
Adropin is a liver- and brain-secreted peptide hormone with striking effects on fuel metabolism regulation in a number of tissues. Previous studies demonstrated that adropin secretion is decreased in obese mice subjected to a long-term high-fat diet (HFD), and that whole-body loss of adropin expression resulted in systemic insulin resistance. Treatment of obese mice with adropin improves glucose tolerance, which has been linked to increased glucose oxidation and inhibition of fatty acid utilization in isolated skeletal muscle homogenates. In this study, we used in vivo physiological measurements to determine how treatment of obese mice with adropin affects whole-body glucose metabolism. Treatment with adropin reduced fasting blood glucose and, as shown previously, increased glucose tolerance in HFD mice during standard glucose tolerance tests. Under hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp conditions, adropin treatment led to a nonsignificant increase in whole-body insulin sensitivity, and a significant reduction in whole-body glucose uptake. Finally, we show that adropin treatment suppressed hepatic glucose production and improved hepatic insulin sensitivity. This correlated with reduced expression of fatty acid import proteins and gluconeogenic regulatory enzymes in the liver, suggesting that adropin treatment may impact the pathways that drive vital aspects of hepatic glucose metabolism.
Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a serious hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that remains a leading cause of perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Placental ischemia/hypoxia and the secretion of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt1) into maternal circulation are involved in the pathogenesis of PE. Although low-dose aspirin (LDA) has beneficial effects on the prevention of PE, the exact mechanisms of action of LDA, particularly on placental dysfunction, and sFlt1 release, have not been well investigated. This study aimed to determine whether LDA exists the protective effects on placental trophoblast and endothelial functions and prevents PE-associated sFlt1 release. First, we observed that LDA mitigated hypoxia-induced trophoblast apoptosis, showed positive effects on trophoblast cells migration and invasion activity, and increased the tube-forming activity of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In addition, LDA decreased hypoxia-induced sFlt1 production, and the c-Jun NH2 -terminal kinase/activator protein-1 (JNK/AP-1) pathway was shown to mediate the induction of sFlt1. Moreover, the transcription factor AP-1 was confirmed to regulate the Flt1 gene expression by directly binding to the Flt1 promoter in luciferase assays. The result of chromatin immunoprecipitation assays further demonstrated that LDA could directly decrease the expression of the transcription factor AP-1, and thus decrease sFlt1 production. Finally, the effects of LDA on sFlt1 production were proved in human placental explants. Taken together, our data show the protective effects of LDA against trophoblast and endothelial cell dysfunction and reveal that the LDA-mediated inhibition of sFlt1 via the JNK/AP-1 pathway may be a potential cellular/molecular mechanism for the prevention of PE.
Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is an aggressive subtype of pulmonary carcinomas with high mortality. However, chemotherapy drug resistance and high recurrence rates hinder the curative effect of platinum-based first-line chemotherapy, which makes it urgent to develop new antitumor drugs for NSCLC. 9za, a new candidate drug synthesized by our research group, has been verified with potent antilung cancer activity in preliminary experiments. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of 9za remains largely vague. This work revealed that 9za could play important cytotoxic and proapoptotic roles in NSCLC cells. Moreover, 9za could induce autophagy and promote autophagy flux. Interestingly, the cytotoxic and proapoptotic roles were significantly dependent on 9za-induced cytoprotective autophagy. That is, the coadministration of 9za with an autophagy inhibitor such as chloroquine or 3-methyladenine exhibited increased cytotoxic and proapoptotic effects compared with 9za treatment alone. In addition, 9za exposure suppressed the phosphorylation of phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1), protein kinase B (Akt), mammalian targets of rapamycin (mTOR), p70 S6 kinase, and 4E binding protein 1 by a dose-dependent way, manifesting that the Akt/mTOR axis was implicated in 9za-induced autophagy. In addition, the overexpression of PDK1 resulted in increased phosphorylation of PDK1 and Akt and blocking of 9za-mediated autophagy. These data showed that the PDK1/Akt/mTOR pathway was involved in 9za-induced autophagy. Hence, this work provides a theoretical basis for exploiting 9za as a new antilung cancer candidate drug and hints that the combination of 9za with an autophagy inhibitor is a feasible alternative approach for the therapy of NSCLC.
Astrocyte undergoes morphology changes that are closely associated with the signaling communications at synapses. N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) is specifically expressed in astrocytes and is associated with several important astrocyte functions, but its potential role(s) relating to astrocyte morphological changes remain unknown. Here, primary astrocytes were prepared from neonatal Ndrg2+/+ and Ndrg2-/- pups, and the drug Y27632 was used to induce stellation. We then used a variety of methods to measure the levels of NDRG2, α-Actinin4, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and the activity of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 in Y27632-treated astrocytes as well as in Ndrg2+/+ , Ndrg2-/- , or Ndrg2-/-  + lentivirus (restore NDRG2 expression) astrocytes. We also conducted live-imaging and proteomics studies of the cultured astrocytes. We found that induction of astrocytes stellation (characterized by cytoplasmic retraction and process outgrowth) resulted in increased NDRG2 protein expression and Rac1 activity and in reduced α-Actinin4 protein expression and RhoA activity. Ndrg2 deletion induced astrocyte flattening, whereas the restoration of NDRG2 expression induced stellation. Ndrg2 deletion also significantly increased α-Actinin4 protein expression and RhoA activity yet reduced GFAP protein expression and Rac1 activity, and these trends were reversed by restoration of NDRG2 expression. Collectively, our results showed that Ndrg2 deletion promoted cell proliferation, interrupted stellation capability, and extensively altered the protein expression profiles of proteins that function in Rho-GTPase signaling. These findings suggest that NDRG2 functions to regulate astrocytes morphology via altering the accumulation of the Rho-GTPase signaling pathway components, thereby supporting that NDRG2 should be understood as a regulator of synaptic plasticity and thus neuronal communications.
Major neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by the formation of misfolded proteins aggregates inside or outside the neuronal cells. Previous studies suggest that aberrant proteins aggregates play a critical role in protein homeostasis imbalance and failure of protein quality control (PQC) mechanism, leading to disease conditions. However, we still do not understand the precise mechanisms of PQC failure and cellular dysfunctions associated with neurodegenerative diseases caused by the accumulation of protein aggregates. Here, we show that Myricetin, a flavonoid, can eliminate various abnormal proteins from the cellular environment via modulating endogenous levels of Hsp70 chaperone and quality control (QC)-E3 ubiquitin ligase E6-AP. We have observed that Myricetin treatment suppresses the aggregation of different aberrant proteins. Myricetin also enhances the elimination of various toxic neurodegenerative diseases associated proteins from the cells, which could be reversed by the addition of putative proteasome inhibitor (MG132). Remarkably, Myricetin can also stabilize E6-AP and reduce the misfolded proteins inclusions, which further alleviates cytotoxicity. Taken together these findings suggested that new mechanistic and therapeutic insights based on small molecules mediated regulation of disturbed protein quality control mechanism, which may result in the maintenance of the state of proteostasis.
ERECTA family (ERf) genes are found in many dicots and monocots, and play important roles in plant developmental processes and stress responses. However, there is little known on ERf genes in grape (Vitis vinifera L.).
The primary objective of this study was to identify the ERf genes in grape, and to analyze their expression profiles in different organs, during development, and in response to hormone treatments and abiotic/biotic stresses.
ERf protein sequences of dicots were aligned in the grape genome (V. vinifera cv. Pinot Noir, PN40024, 12X) with Blast server. The locus tags obtained were inputted in NCBI to retrieve corresponding nucleotide and protein accession numbers. The subcellular localization experiment was performed by the transient expression of VvERECTA-GFP and VvERL2-GFP in mesophyll protoplasts of Arabidopsis. The expression levels of ERf genes in grape leaves were detected by qRT-PCR after hormone treatments and abiotic/biotic stresses.
We first identified the ERf genes in the grape genome, including VvERECTA and VvERL2. Their cDNA full-length sequences were obtained with the accession numbers MG601756 and MG601757. The result of subcellular localization indicated that the fusion proteins of VvERECTA and VvERL2 were localized in the plasma membrane. There were four conserved domains identified in VvERECTA and VvERL2, including a LRRNT-2, a LRR, a transmembrane and a protein kinase domain. The grape ERf genes expressed highly in young aboveground organs. As grape leaves or berries becoming mature, VvERECTA expressed in a declining trend. The transcript abundance of VvERL2 decreased during leaves development, but showed no significant differences during berries development. The hormone treatments of ABA, SA, MeJA and BR could induce the expression of VvERECTA and VvERL2. The treatments of heat, drought, downy and powdery mildew significantly increased the expression levels of the grape ERf genes.
The grape ERECTA gene family might play crucial roles in response to abiotic and biotic stresses. We provide the first description of the grape ERf genes and the most comprehensive analysis of their expressions in different biological processes.
Diploidy is the typical genomic mode in all mammals. Haploid stem cells are artificial cell lines experimentally derived in vitro in the form of different types of stem cells, which combine the characteristics of haploidy with a broad developmental potential and open the possibility to uncover biological mysteries at a genomic scale. To date, a multitude of haploid stem cell types from mouse, rat, monkey and humans have been derived, as more are in development. They have been applied in high-throughput genetic screens and mammalian assisted reproduction. Here, we review the generation, unique properties and broad applications of these remarkable cells.
The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) has a dual role in the metabolism of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). In cellular models, LRP1 enhances amyloid-β (Aβ) generation via APP internalization and thus its amyloidogenic processing. However, conditional knock-out studies in mice define LRP1 as an important mediator for the clearance of extracellular Aβ from brain via cellular degradation or transcytosis across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In order to analyze the net effect of LRP1 on production and clearance of Aβ in vivo, we crossed mice with impaired LRP1 function with a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Analysis of Aβ metabolism showed that, despite reduced Aβ clearance due to LRP1 inactivation in vivo, less Aβ was found in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain interstitial fluid (ISF). Further analysis of APP metabolism revealed that impairment of LRP1 in vivo shifted APP processing from the Aβ-generating amyloidogenic cleavage by beta-secretase to the non-amyloidogenic processing by alpha-secretase as shown by a decrease in extracellular Aβ and an increase of soluble APP-α (sAPP-α). This shift in APP processing resulted in overall lower Aβ levels and a reduction in plaque burden. Here, we present for the first time clear in vivo evidence that global impairment of LRP1's endocytosis function favors non-amyloidogenic processing of APP due to its reduced internalization and subsequently, reduced amyloidogenic processing. By inactivation of LRP1, the inhibitory effect on Aβ generation overrules the simultaneous impaired Aβ clearance, resulting in less extracellular Aβ and reduced plaque deposition in a mouse model of AD.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate osteogenic differentiation of bone cells, which has applications in orthodontics. Here we evaluated the miRNA expression profile of MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts under cyclic tensile stress with chip technology and found that miR-132-3p was up-regulated by 12% cyclic tensile stress. Alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin expression in MC3T3-E1 cells were decreased under these conditions. Smad2 and Smad5 were identified as potential target genes of miR-132-3p. Native and phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad5 expression was negatively correlated with miR-132-3p levels in the cells under cyclic stretch; however, only Smad5 protein level was reduced upon miR-132-3p overexpression. The luciferase reporter assay confirmed a direct interaction between miR-132-3p and Smad5. Thus, miR-132-3p maybe regulates osteoblast differentiation via Smad5 in response to cyclic tensile stress.
In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether the encapsulation of ellagic acid (EA) into nanoliposomes would improve its potential in preventing cyclophosphamide-induced liver damage. Stability and antioxidative potential of free and encapsulated EA were determined. Experimental study conducted in vivo included ten groups of rats treated with cyclophosphamide and ellagic acid in its free and encapsulated form during 5 days. The protective effect of EA in its free and encapsulated form was determined based on serum liver function, liver tissue antioxidative capacities, and oxidative tissue damage parameters. Also, tissue morphological changes following cyclophosphamide administration were studied using standard histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses. The encapsulation of EA significantly prevented its degradation and improved its antioxidant properties in in vitro conditions. In in vivo experiments in both forms of EA were found to prevent rat liver damage induced by cyclophosphamide estimated through the changes in serum liver-damage parameters and tissue antioxidant capacities, as well as based on oxidatively modified lipids and proteins. Also, changes in morphology of liver cells and the expressions of Bcl-2, HIF-1α, and CD15 molecules in livers of animals of different experimental groups are in accordance with the obtained biochemical parameters. Thus, the encapsulation process might be effective in preventing EA from different environmental influences and could significantly increase its hepatoprotective potential. The encapsulation could prevent ellagic acid degradation and might deliver this potent compound to its target tissue in significantly larger quantities than when it is administered in its free form.
The purpose of our research is to elucidate whether oxLDL activates P2X7R in cultured human podocytes and if the activation of P2X7R leads to podocyte apoptosis. Additionally, we explore the underlying mechanism involved in podocyte apoptosis. Immortalized human podocytes were incubated with oxLDL (80 µg/ml), P2X7R antagonist A438079 (10 µM), or the compound of A438079 and oxLDL for 48 h, respectively. Cellular apoptosis and ROS were evaluated using flow cytometer. P2X7R, Bax, and Caspase-3 protein expression were detected by western blot and immunofluorescence analysis.The expression of P2X7R, ROS, Bax, and Caspase-3 in human podocytes incubated with oxLDL was significantly up-regulated and was found to have higher intracellular lipid accumulation and podocyte apoptosis compared with the NC group. However, co-administration with A438079, ROS, Bax, and Caspase-3 expression both significantly down-regulate as well as lower lipid accumulation and cellular apoptosis in the oxLDL-induced podocyte group. We revealed that P2X7R is involved in the regulation of oxLDL-treated podocytes. Additionally, we found that the anti-apoptotic effect of A438079 is correlated with ROS, Bax, and Caspase-3 expression down-regulated.
Survivin is a well-known inhibitor-of-apoptosis proteins family member and a promising molecular target for anti-cancer treatment. However, it is widely accepted that survivin is only a "semi-druggable" target and development of survivin-specific small molecule inhibitors has shown to be difficult. In this study, we demonstrated that a histidine-tagged survivin T34A-C84A mutated protein (T34A-C84A-dNSur-His) can be produced using a bacterial recombinant protein expression system [E. coli ArcticExpress (DE3) cells] and solubilized using 1% (w/v) Sarkosyl. In addition, we showed that the purified T34A-C84A-dNSur-His protein formed dimers as predicted by in silico protein structure and molecular dynamics analysis. Importantly, results of the MTT assay revealed that the purified recombinant protein was biologically active in decreasing the viability of the human MDA-MB-231 breast adenocarcinoma and MIA-PaCa pancreatic carcinoma cells in vitro. Furthermore, the purified T34A-C84A-dNSur-His protein, but not of the histidine-peptide, induced apoptosis (i.e. caspase-9 activation and DNA fragmentation) in MDA-MB-231 cells at concentrations from 50 to 400 nM. In conclusion, our study provides a protocol of producing a biologically active survivin-targeting macromolecule, T34A-C84A-dNSur-His, which can be used as a tool for studying the molecular and cellular roles of survivin in cells. T34A-C84A-dNSur-His is also a potential therapeutic agent for augmenting cancer therapy.
The extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment is increasingly implicated in the instruction of pathologically relevant cell behaviors, from aberrant transdifferentation to invasion and beyond. Indeed, pathologic ECMs possess a panoply of alterations that provide deleterious instructions to resident cells. Here we demonstrate the precise manner in which the ECM protein fibronectin (FN) undergoes the posttranslational modification citrullination in response to peptidyl-arginine deiminase (PAD), an enzyme associated with innate immune cell activity and implicated in systemic ECM-centric diseases, like cancer, fibrosis and rheumatoid arthritis. FN can be citrullinated in at least 24 locations, 5 of which reside in FN's primary cell-binding domain. Citrullination of FN alters integrin clustering and focal adhesion stability with a concomitant enhancement in force-triggered integrin signaling along the FAK-Src and ILK-Parvin pathways within fibroblasts. In vitro migration and in vivo wound healing studies demonstrate the ability of citrullinated FN to support a more migratory/invasive phenotype that enables more rapid wound closure. These findings highlight the potential of ECM, particularly FN, to "record" inflammatory insults via post-translational modification by inflammation-associated enzymes that are subsequently "read" by resident tissue fibroblasts, establishing a direct link between inflammation and tissue homeostasis and pathogenesis through the matrix.
The anticancer effects of polyphenols are ascribed to several signaling pathways including the tumor suppressor gene tumor protein 53 (p53). Expression of endogenous p53 is silent in various types of cancers. A number of polyphenols from a wide variety of dietary sources could upregulate p53 expression in several cancer cell lines through distinct mechanisms of action. The aim of this review is to focus the significance of p53 signaling pathways and to provide molecular intuitions of dietary polyphenols in chemoprevention by monitoring p53 expression that have a prominent role in tumor suppression.
High-concentration glutamic acid (Glu) induced by ischemic stroke can be inhibited by glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1), which is the main mechanism for preventing excessive extracellular glutamate accumulation in the central nervous system. Upregulation of miR-124 could reduce the infarct area and promote the recovery of neurological function after ischemic stroke. A previous study investigated whether miR-124 could regulate GLT-1 expression in normal culture conditions. However, the role of miR-124 in the regulation of GLT-1 expression and further mechanisms after ischemic stroke remain unclear. In this study, the effects of miR-124 on GLT-1 expression in astrocytes after ischemic stroke were explored using an in vitro model of ischemic stroke (oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion, OGD/reperfusion). The expression of GLT-1 was significantly decreased with lower expression of miR-124 in astrocytes injured by OGD/reperfusion. When miR-124 expression was improved, the expression of GLT-1 was notably increased in astrocytes injured by OGD/reperfusion. The results revealed that GLT-1 expression in astrocytes had a relationship with miR-124 after OGD/reperfusion. However, a direct interaction could not be confirmed with a luciferase reporter assay. Further results demonstrated that an inhibitor of Akt could decrease the increased protein expression of GLT-1 induced by miR-124 mimics, and an inhibitor of mTOR could increase the reduced protein expression of GLT-1 caused by a miR-124 inhibitor in astrocytes injured by different OGD/reperfusion conditions. These results indicated that miR-124 could regulate GLT-1 expression in astrocytes after OGD/reperfusion through the Akt and mTOR pathway.
The combined use of Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata (ALRP) and Zingiberis Rhizoma (ZR) are classic compatibilities in China for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases such as increasing myocardial contractility, anti-arrhythmia, reducing myocardial oxygen consumption, and dilating organ blood vessels, etc, thereby exerting anti-heart failure (HF) effects in traditional Chinese herbal medicine. However, comprehensive approaches for understanding the therapeutic effects and mechanisms underlying chronic heart failure (CHF) from the perspective of energy metabolism have not been pursued.
This research was aimed to investigate the effectiveness and potential mechanism of ALRP combined with ZR (1:1) on doxorubicin (DOX)-induced CHF in rats based on an integrated approach that combines network pharmacology analyses and molecular biology.
CHF model was established by the intraperitoneal injection of DOX. ALRP and ZR were intragastrically administrated for three weeks. The detection indices including hemodynamic measurements, myocardial injury marker, and myocardial pathological changes were measured. Network pharmacology analysis was used to illustrate the pathways and network of ALRP and ZR against HF. Mitochondrial energy metabolism pathway associated gene and protein levels of PPARα, PGC-1α and Sirt3 in myocardial tissue were detected by real-time PCR and western blotting, respectively.
The results indicated that ALRP-ZR herbal couple significantly improved the left ventricular function and cardiac enzyme activities in comparison with their single use. Network pharmacology analysis results showed that the pharmacological mechanisms of ALRP-ZR may be related to PPAR energy metabolism pathway. Besides, the outcomes of western-blot and real-time PCR analysis showed that ALRP-ZR significantly upregulates the protein and gene level of PPARα, PGC-1α, and Sirt3.
Network pharmacology analysis would be an effective network analyze workflow which was feasible for evaluating the pharmacological effect of a multi-drug complex system. The Chinese herbal couple ALRP-ZR had a better therapeutic effect than their single-use against DOX-induced CHF, which may be related to enhancing left ventricular function by activating the PPARα/PGC-1α/Sirt3 pathway.
Flower and flower bud of Lonicera japonica, Lonicerae Flos, have been popularly used as medicinal plant for the treatment of clearing heat and thirst, thereby improving diabetic or diabetic associated symptoms (thirst and poor eyesight).
Organic cation transporters (OCTs) and multi-drug and toxin extrusion proteins (MATEs) are known to play important roles in metformin transport in the liver and kidneys. Thus, there might be interactions between Lonicerae Flos and metformin via OCTs and MATEs. Also treatment period has been issued in transporter-mediated drug interactions. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of Lonicerae Flos ethanol extract (LJ) on metformin pharmacokinetics and its glucose lowering activity in different treatment periods.
Effect of LJ on metformin uptake was evaluated in vitro HEK-293 cells expressing human OCTs or MATEs. Treatment period-dependent impact of LJ on systemic exposure and hepatic distribution of metformin as well as its glucose tolerance activity were assessed in in vivo rats.
LJ substantially inhibited MATE1-mediated metformin uptake in vitro. In evaluating treatment period effects of LJ and metformin, 1-, 7-, and 28-day co-treatments of LJ with metformin did not change systemic exposure of metformin compared to those in metformin alone. Whereas, 28-day co-treatment of LJ with metformin increased metformin concentration in liver as a pharmacological target site of metformin. It could be due to the reduced MATE1-mediated metformin efflux from hepatocytes to bile by MATE1 inhibition in liver. Glucose tolerance activity was also enhanced by 28-day co-treatment of LJ and metformin compared to metformin alone.
In 28-day co-treatment of LJ and metformin, LJ increased metformin concentration in liver and improved glucose tolerance activity without systemic exposure change of metformin, suggesting the importance to consider treatment period effect and both systemic exposure and tissue distribution in drug interactions.
Previous studies on vaccine development against foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus reported that application of the inactivated vaccines for FMD virus is not completely effective. Novel vaccinations based on immune-dominant epitopes showed they induced immune responses. In addition, for better and safer immunization, access to of efficient adjuvants against FMD virus seems to be critical. In this study, we produced epitope recombinant vaccines from the VP1 protein of the FMD virus for serotype O of Iran that conjugated with Fc Immunoglobulin (FcIgG) and Interleukin-2 (IL-2). Multiple-epitope constructs included Polytope, Polytope-IL2-FcIgG, Polytope-IL2, Polytope-FcIgG that cloned and expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). To evaluate whether these epitope recombinant vaccines induce immune responses, BALB/c mice were injected with the epitope recombinant vaccines and their immune responses were compared with a negative control group. The humoral and cellular immune responses were measured by ELISA. The results showed there were significant differences between the negative control group and other immunized mice with recombinant epitope proteins (p &lt; 0.05). The results of total IgG, IgG1, IgG2a levels and secretion of IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-10 revealed that immune responses were enhanced when the epitope recombinant vaccine of FMD virus coupled with IL-2 and FcIgG. Observations indicated that the epitope recombinant plasmid of the VP1 protein co-expressed with IL-2 and FcIgG was effective in inducing an enhanced immune response. Therefore, IL-2 and FcIgG could be recommended as a potential adjuvant for epitope recombinant vaccine of the VP1 protein from FMD virus.
The capacity of inducing angiogenesis is a recognized hallmark of cancer cells. The cancer microenvironment, characterized by hypoxia and inflammatory signals, promotes proliferation, migration and activation of quiescent endothelial cells (EC) from surrounding vascular network. Current anti-angiogenic drugs present side effects, temporary efficacy, and issues of primary resistance, thereby calling for the identification of new therapeutic targets. MICALs are a unique family of redox enzymes that destabilize F-actin in cytoskeletal dynamics. MICAL2 mediates Semaphorin3A-NRP2 response to VEGFR1 in rat ECs. MICAL2 also enters the p130Cas interactome in response to VEGF in HUVEC. Previously, we showed that MICAL2 is overexpressed in metastatic cancer. A small-molecule inhibitor of MICAL2 exists (CCG-1423). Here we report that 1) MICAL2 is expressed in neo-angiogenic ECs in human solid tumors (kidney and breast carcinoma, glioblastoma and cardiac myxoma, n = 67, were analyzed with immunohistochemistry) and in animal models of ischemia/inflammation neo-angiogenesis, but not in normal capillary bed; 2) MICAL2 protein pharmacological inhibition (CCG-1423) or gene KD reduce EC viability and functional performance; 3) MICAL2 KD disables ECs response to VEGF in vitro. Whole-genome gene expression profiling reveals MICAL2 involvement in angiogenesis and vascular development pathways. Based on these results, we propose that MICAL2 expression in ECs participates to inflammation-induced neo-angiogenesis and that MICAL2 inhibition should be tested in cancer- and noncancer-associated neo-angiogenesis, where chronic inflammation represents a relevant pathophysiological mechanism.
Animal study.
The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of inflammasomes in the injured spinal cord of a rat spinal cord injury model.
University laboratory in Kanagawa, Japan.
A thoracic contusion spinal cord injury (SCI) was induced in female Sprague Dawley rats using an IH-impactor to create a moderate injury group (LI) and a severe injury group (HI). Using a sham group as a control, the injured spinal cords were removed at several time points after injury to evaluate the levels of inflammasome component proteins in the injured spinal cord by immunohistochemistry and Western Blot.
Western blot analyses revealed that the expression of inflammasome component proteins leucine-rich repeat protein 3 (NLRP3), apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), and Caspase-2 significantly increased in the SCI animals compared to the sham animals. Thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP), which is a protein induced by ER stress that activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, was also significantly higher in the SCI animals. Immunohistochemistry revealed significantly higher expression of NLRP3, ASC, and Caspase-2 in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) of the SCI groups compared to astrocytes of the SCI groups and OPCs of the sham group.
Inflammasome component protein expression increases after SCI in association with increased ER stress. OPCs had significantly higher levels of inflammasome proteins compared to astrocytes, which may be associated with the high rates of OPC cell death after SCI.
Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is one of the perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), and has been used in industrial and consumer products. It has already been shown that PFOS could be detected in the environmental media and biological species including humans, due to its resistance to environmental degradation. PFOS is known to induce a series of adverse impacts on human health, e.g., as a potential neurotoxic substance. Recent studies suggest that astrocytes act as the mediator in PFOS-induced neurotoxicity; however, the underlying molecular mechanism needs further investigation. Under the physiological condition, astrocytes play an important role in maintaining brain functions through releasing and up-taking of neurotransmitters between astrocytes and neurons. In the present study, astrocytes-derived d-serine was shown to be involved in PFOS-induced apoptosis and death in the rat primary hippocampal neurons. Significant alterations in d-serine were found in astrocytes, mediated by the molecules in d-serine synthesis (serine racemase), metabolism (d-amino acid oxidase) and delivery (calcium, vacuolar type H+-ATPase, alanine-serine-cysteine transporter and connexin 43 hemichannels). Meanwhile, the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunits (NR1, NR2 A and NR2B) gene and protein expressions were significantly increased in the hippocampal neurons exposed to the PFOS-activated astrocytes-conditional medium (ACM). Further, the adverse effects of PFOS could be attenuated by the fluorocitrate (an inhibitor for d-serine up-taken by the glial cells) application. Our data indicated that astrocytes-derived d-serine was involved in PFOS-induced neurotoxicity through the NMDARs in the rat primary hippocampal neurons.
The zinc metalloprotease STAM-binding protein-like 1 (STAMBPL1) has been identified as a deubiquitinase by specifically cleaving Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chains, but its cellular function remains unclear. Here we described the potential role of STAMBPL1 in suppression of the intrinsic apoptosis. We observed substantially high amounts of STAMBPL1 proteins in androgen-independent prostate cancer PC3 and DU145 cell lines. STAMBPL1 RNAi depletion triggered caspase-3/-7-dependent apoptosis in PC3 and DU145 cells. STAMBPL1 knockdown-induced apoptosis was accompanied by accumulation of cellular ROS and a decrease in endogenous caspase inhibitor XIAP protein content. Treatment cells with antioxidant NAC delayed STAMBPL1 silencing-induced apoptosis, whereas ectopic expression of XIAP almost completely abrogated apoptosis. We further elucidated that STAMBPL1 knockdown diverted XIAP protein to lysosomal degradation pathway. Taken together, these studies show that STAMBPL1 depletion induces apoptosis by promoting XIAP lysosomal degradation, and suggest that targeting deubiquitinase STAMBPL1 might offer promising therapeutic strategy for prostate cancer.
Russula griseocarnosa is a species of edible ectomycorrhizal fungi with medicinal properties that grows in southern China. Total DNA was isolated from a fresh fruiting body of R. griseocarnosa and subjected to sequencing using Illumina Hiseq with the PacBio RS sequencing platform. Here, we present the 64.81 Mb draft genome map of R. griseocarnosa based on 471 scaffolds and 16,128 coding protein genes. The gene annotation of protein coding genes was used to obtain corresponding annotations by blastp. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a close evolutionary relationship of R. griseocarnosa to Heterobasidion irregulare and Stereum hirsutum in the core Russulales clade. The R. griseocarnosa genome encodes a repertoire of enzymes engaged in carbohydrate and polysaccharide metabolism, along with cytochrome P450s and secondary metabolite biosynthesis. The genome content of R. griseocarnosa provides insights into the genetic basis of its reported medicinal properties and serves as a reference for comparative genomics of fungi.
Upper airway and vocalization control areas such as the periaqueductal gray (PAG), kölliker-fuse nucleus (KF) and nucleus retroambiguus (NRA) are prone to developing tauopathy in mice expressing the mutant human tau P301 L protein. Consequently, impaired ultrasonic vocalization (USV) previously identified in tau-P301 L mice at the terminal disease stage of 8-9 months of age, was attributed to the presence of tauopathy in these regions. Our aim was to establish whether the onset of USV disorders manifest prior to the terminal stage, and if USV disorders are predictive of the presence of tauopathy in the PAG, KF and NRA. USVs produced by tau-P301 L and wildtype mice aged 3-4, 5-6 or 8-9 months were recorded during male-female interaction. Immunohistochemistry was then performed to assess the presence or degree of tauopathy in the PAG, KF and NRA of mice displaying normal or abnormal USV patterns. Comparing various USV measurements, including the number, duration and frequency of calls, revealed no differences between tau-P301 L and wildtype mice across all age groups, and linear discriminant analysis also failed to identify separate USV populations. Finally, the presence of tauopathy in the PAG, KF and NRA in individual tau-P301 L mice did not reliably associate with USV disorders. Our findings that tauopathy in designated mammalian vocalization centres, such as the PAG, KF and NRA, did not associate with USV disturbances in tau-P301 L mice questions whether USV phenotypes in this transgenic mouse are valid for studying tauopathy-related human voice and speech disorders.
Although cancer cells use heparanase for tumor metastasis, favourable effects of heparanase have been reported in the management of Alzheimer's disease and diabetes. Indeed, we previously established a protective function for heparanase in the acutely diabetic heart, where it conferred cardiomyocyte resistance to oxidative stress and apoptosis by provoking changes in gene expression. In this study, we tested if overexpression of heparanase can protect the heart against chemically induced or ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Transcriptomic analysis of Hep-tg hearts reveal that 240 genes related to the stress response, immune response, cell death, and development were altered in a pro-survival direction encompassing genes promoting the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy, as well as those protecting against oxidative stress. The observed UPR activation was adaptive and not apoptotic, was mediated by activation of ATF6α, and when combined with mTOR inhibition, induced autophagy. Subjecting wild type (WT) mice to increasing concentrations of the ER stress inducer thapsigargin evoked a transition from adaptive to apoptotic UPR, an effect that was attenuated in Hep-tg mouse hearts. Consistent with these observations, when exposed to I/R, the infarct size and markers of apoptosis were significantly lower in the Hep-tg heart compared to WT. Finally, UPR and autophagy inhibitors reduced the protective effects of heparanase overexpression during I/R. Our data suggest that the mechanisms that underlie the role of heparanase in promoting cell survival could be uniquely beneficial to the heart by providing protection against cellular stresses, and could be useful for exploitation as a therapeutic target for the treatment of heart disease.
Studies into the interactions of serum proteins with nanoparticles are typically performed using nanoparticles that are larger than the size of proteins. Due to this size discrepancy, adsorbed proteins are commonly depicted as a globular structure surrounding a nanoparticle. Here, we asked how we should view nanoparticle-protein complexes when the nanoparticles are of similar size or smaller than the proteins with which they interact. We showed that nanoparticles can serve as a cargo on a protein rather than as a carrier of the protein in a size-dependent manner. This occurs when nanoparticles are below 10 nm. We discovered that when the nanoparticle is a cargo on the protein, the binding of the protein to the receptor target is minimally affected in contrast to the nanoparticle serving as a carrier. Our study should change how we view and describe nanoparticle-protein complexes when the nanoparticles involved are equal in size or smaller than proteins.
Activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) contributes to the development of liver fibrosis. Because of a relatively small population of HSCs in the liver and the lack of specific membrane targeting proteins, HSC-targeted therapy remains a major clinical challenge. Here we first showed that a hallmark of activated HSC (aHSC) is their increased expression of integrin αvβ3. Thus we established sterically stable liposomes that contain the cyclic peptides (cRGDyK) with a high affinity to αvβ3 to achieve aHSC-specific delivery. Our results showed that the cRGDyK-guided liposomes were preferentially internalized by activated HSCs in vitro and in vivo, and the internalization was abolished by excess free cRGDyK or knockdown of αvβ3. In contrast, quiescent HSCs, hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, sinusoidal endothelial cells, or biliary cells showed minimal uptake of the cRGDyK-guided liposomes. When loaded with the hedgehog inhibitor vismodegib, the cRGDyK-guided liposomes inhibited hedgehog pathway signaling specifically in activated HSCs. Moreover, treatment of mice with vismodegib-loaded cRGDyK-liposomes markedly inhibited the fibrogenic phenotype in bile duct ligation- or thioacetamide-treated mice. We conclude that the cRGDyK-guided liposomes can specifically target the activated HSCs, but not quiescent HSCs. This nanoparticle system showed great promise to deliver therapeutic agents to aHSC to treat liver fibrosis.
Dysferlin has been implicated in acute membrane repair processes, whereas myoferlin's activity is maximal during the myoblast fusion stage of early skeletal muscle cell development. Both proteins are similar in size and domain structure; however, despite the overall similarity, myoferlin's known physiological functions do not overlap with those of dysferlin. Here we present for the first time the X-ray crystal structure of human myoferlin C2A to 1.9 Å̊ resolution bound to two divalent cations, and compare its 3D structure and membrane binding activities to that of dysferlin C2A. We find that while dysferlin C2A binds membranes in a Ca2+-dependent manner, Ca2+-binding was the rate-limiting kinetic step for this interaction. Myoferlin C2A, on the other hand, binds two calcium ions with an affinity 3-fold lower than that of dysferlin C2A; and, surprisingly, myoferlin C2A binds only marginally to phospholipid mixtures with a high fraction of phosphatidylserine.
Lassa virus (LASV) is a notorious human pathogen in West Africa. Its class-I trimeric spike complex displays a distinct architecture, and its cell entry mechanism involves unique attributes not shared by other related viruses. We determined the crystal structure of the GP2 fusion glycoprotein from the spike complex of LASV (GP2LASV) in its post-fusion conformation. GP2LASV adopts a canonical helical bundle configuration similarly to other viruses in its family. The core packing of GP2LASV however, is more organized compared to GP2 from other viruses reducing the formation of internal hydrophobic cavities. We demonstrate a link between the formation of such unfavorable hydrophobic cavities and the efficiencies of membrane fusion and cell entry. Our study suggests that LASV has evolved a more efficient membrane fusogen compared to other viruses from its family by optimizing the post-fusion configuration of its GP2 module.
Collagen is the most abundant protein in mammalian systems; it can be found in organs such as bones, the liver, kidney, heart, teeth, and skin. Collagen provides the necessary structural framework for tissues in which it is found. However, if there are any alterations in the delicate balance of collagen types in the extracellular matrix (ECM), then problems arise. For example, increasing collagen I:III ratio would provide additional rigidity to tissue structure, whereas decreasing this ratio would provide elasticity and flexibility to the tissue. The proper function of tissues is reliant on this scale not tipping too far in either direction. Major players in the process of ECM remodeling, both normal and adverse, are the fibroblast cells via the secretion of collagen precursors and matrix metalloproteinases, with the latter responsible for ECM degradation. The collagen peptides created by the proteolytic cleavage of these collagen fibrils, while once thought to have an absence of function, have been shown over recent years to potentiate and regulate a variety of cellular processes acting through integrin receptors. Many collagen peptides have been identified from many different collagen types and have been shown to regulate processes such as cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and reduce angiogenesis. The collagen peptides of interest are those generated from the primary collagen type of tissue interstitial matrix, collagen type I, and the basement membrane, collagen type IV. Thus, this review looks to highlight some examples of unorthodox functional roles of collagen and its peptides in regulating physiological health and disease.
Growing evidence suggests that endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) play key roles in pulmonary arterial remodeling during pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), but the underlying mechanisms have yet to be fully understood. miR-27a has been shown to promote proliferation of pulmonary arterial cells during PAH, but its role in EndMT remains unexplored. This study was designed to investigate the role and underlying mechanism of miR-27a in EndMT during PAH.
Rats were exposed in hypoxia (10% O2) for 3 weeks to induce PAH, and human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs) were exposed in hypoxia (1% O2) for 48 h to induce EndMT. Immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, immunofluorescence, real-time PCR and Western blot were conducted to detect the expressions of RNAs and proteins, and luciferase assay was used to verify the putative binding site of miR-27a.
We found that hypoxia up-regulated miR-27a in the tunica intima of rat pulmonary arteries and HPAECs, and that inhibition of miR-27a suppressed hypoxia-induced EndMT. Furthermore, elevated expression of miR-27a suppressed bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling by targeting Smad5, thereby lessening Id2-mediated repression of the 2 critical mediators of EndMT (Snail and Twist).
Our data unveiled a novel role of miR-27a in EndMT during hypoxia-induced PAH. Thus, targeting of miR-27a-related pathway may be therapeutically harnessed to treat PAH.
Growth factors are necessary for proper and efficient wound closure and tissue regeneration. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is one of the key signaling molecules in stimulating epithelial cell motility, making it a required factor for re-epithelialization. Increased EGF expression is likely to be a strong prognostic and predictive feature in multiple tumor types and determination of EGF may product remarkable diagnosis benefits. Thus, identification and quantification of EGF in biomedical fields are particularly important. Affinity chromatography, immunohistochemical methods and ELISA, conventional methods for EGF detection, requiring high-cost and complicated instrumentation, take too much time and offer deficient sensitivity and selectivity, which restrict their usage in real applications. Hence, it is essential to design and build enhanced systems and platforms for the recognition and quantification of protein biomarkers. In the past few years, bio-assays have been received noticeable attention for the detection of EGF owing to their high sensitivity, selectivity, accuracy, fast response, and low cost. Since the role and importance of developing aptasensors in cancer diagnosis is undeniable. In this review, electrochemical biosensors, which have been applied by many researchers for EGF cancer biomarker detection, have been mentioned and merits and demerits of them have been explained and compared. Efforts related to design and development of aptamer-based biosensors using nanoparticles for sensitive and selective detection of EGF have been reviewed considering: Aptamer importance as recognition elements, principal, application and the recent improvements and developments of aptamer based optical and electrochemical methods. In addition, commercial biosensors and future perspectives for rapid and on-site detection of EGF have been summarized.
A novel plant peroxidase was isolated from the stem of Arabian balsam (Commiphora gileadensis) and purified using ammonium sulfate, followed by ion exchange chromatography (DEAE-Sepharose) and gel filtration (Sephacryl S-200). The newly isolated peroxidase was characterized as having a specific activity of 9503.3 unit/mg of protein after 20.3-fold purification, which yielded a recovery of 18.5%. Based on the subunit size, the purified peroxidase was a 40 kDa monomeric structure and presented high thermostability, as it was entirely stable at 55 °C for 30 min and retained approximately 13.6% of its activity at 85 °C. The optimal pH exhibited a broad value range (pH 7.0-7.5). The kinetic parameters for the purified peroxidase were obtained. To increase the enzyme durability, efficiency and reusability, the peroxidase was entrapped onto a carboxymethyl cellulose/Fe3O4 magnetic hybrid material. The immobilized enzyme was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and FT-IR spectroscopy. It was tested at different pH values, storage times and temperatures, and its kinetic behavior was assessed. The immobilized enzyme maintained its activity upon storage at 4 and 25 °C for 8 weeks, and upon recycling for up to 15 uses. Arabian balsam peroxidase appears to be candidate for industrial applications.
In specialized cell types such as neurons, microtubules maintain the integrity of axons by forming stable bundles and facilitate the transport of synaptic vesicles. The cells regulate the stability and dynamics of microtubules using a diverse array of mechanisms. One of the mechanisms involves the interaction of microtubules with its associated proteins. Microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) may have either stabilizing or destabilizing effects on the microtubules. Tau, a neuronal MAP, promotes the assembly and bundling of microtubules and suppresses microtubule dynamics. Abnormal functioning of tau is implicated in several neuronal disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), wherein tau forms insoluble aggregates and causes neurotoxicity. In this review, we focus on the effects of tau on neuronal microtubule stability and dynamics. We also discuss the factors that lead to tau aggregation and the resulting destabilization of microtubules and the implications of this phenomenon in the AD and other tauopathies.
This work studied the effects of different concentrations of gum arabic (GA) on the interfacial adsorption kinetics of whey protein (WP) at the oil-water interface, the possibility of emulsion stabilized by WP/GA mixtures, and use of such emulsions as resveratrol delivery systems. Dynamic interface pressure measurements indicated that the change of GA concentration significantly affected the diffusion, penetration and rearrangement of WP at the oil-water interface, while measurements of hydrodynamic diameter and ζ-potential indicated electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between WP and GA. The rheological measurements of the emulsions supported the above observations and indicated that different GA concentrations affected the viscoelastic properties of the emulsion. Adding resveratrol into oil influenced the adsorption of WP at the oil-water interface, thus affecting the emulsion stability and the encapsulation efficiency of resveratrol. The emulsions stabilized by WP and WP/GA mixtures have encapsulation efficiencies of &gt;50% for resveratrol, while emulsions showed the best stability at a GA concentration of 0.2%. These results indicate that GA could effectively improve the emulsifying capacity of WP, while the emulsions prepared by WP/GA mixtures have the potential to serve as carriers for bioactive components.
In this study we report the design, construction and validation of a novel transposon aimed to systematically screen for protein localization and expression patterns in prokaryotes using fluorescence microscopy. Upon random insertion in an open reading frame in the proper frame and orientation, the transposon creates an N-terminal fluorescent protein fusion to the msfGFP reporter. Moreover, in order to examine the localization of fusion proteins whose native expression might be too low or absent, the transposon was fitted with a PLtetO-1 promoter that makes the expression of the generated fluorescent protein fusions controllable by anhydrotetracycline. Importantly, upon flipping out the PLtetO-1 promoter and neighboring antibiotic resistance marker, an in-frame "sandwich" msfGFP fusion is created in which the N- and C-terminal portions of the targeted protein are again controlled by its native promoter.
Overactivity of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function has been implicated in depression and suicidal behavior. This is based on the observation of an abnormal dexamethasone (DEX) and DEX-adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) test in patients with depression and suicidal behavior. Recently, some studies have also found abnormalities of glucocorticoid receptors (GR), mineralocorticoid receptors (MR), corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), CRF receptors (CRF-R) and CRF binding protein (CRF-BP) in depressed and suicidal patients. Some investigators have also observed increased levels of CRF in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and altered levels of MR, GR and CRF in the postmortem brain of depressed and suicidal subjects. We have earlier reported decreased protein and mRNA expression of GR and GILZ, a chaperone protein, in the postmortem brain of teenage suicide subjects. We have further studied CRF and its receptors in different areas of the postmortem brain of suicide subjects, i.e., the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus (HIPPO), subiculum and amygdala (AMY) from teenage suicide subjects. The CRF and its receptors were determined in the PFC (Brodmann area 9), HIPPO, subiculum and different amygdaloid nuclei from 24 normal control subjects and 24 teenage suicide subjects. Protein expression of CRF, its receptors and CRF-BP was determined by immunolabeling using the Western blot technique and mRNA expression was determined by real-time PCR (qPCR) technique. We found that the mRNA levels of CRF were significantly increased in the PFC, in the central amygdaloid nucleus (CeAMY) and in the subiculum. mRNA levels of CRF-R1 and CRF-BP were significantly decreased in the PFC. We did not find any changes in the HIPPO of any of the CRF components we studied. When we compared the protein expression of CRF components we found that CRF was significantly increased and CRF-R1, CRF-R2 and CRF-BP significantly decreased in the PFC. On the other hand, there were no changes in the protein expression of CRF components in the HIPPO. Our results in the postmortem brain suggest that, as found by clinical studies in the CSF, there are significant alterations of CRF and its receptors in the postmortem brain of teenage suicide subjects. These alterations of CRF and its components were region-specific, as changes were not generally observed in the HIPPO.
The welding process releases potentially hazardous gases and fumes, mainly composed of metallic oxides, fluorides and silicates. Long term welding fume (WF) inhalation is a recognized health issue that carries a risk of developing chronic health problems, particularly respiratory system diseases (RSDs). Aside from general airway irritation, WF exposure may drive direct cellular responses in the respiratory system which increase risk of RSD, but these are not well understood.
We developed a quantitative framework to identify gene expression effects of WF exposure that may affect RSD development. We analyzed gene expression microarray data from WF-exposed tissues and RSD-affected tissues, including chronic bronchitis (CB), asthma (AS), pulmonary edema (PE), lung cancer (LC) datasets. We built disease-gene (diseasome) association networks and identified dysregulated signaling and ontological pathways, and protein-protein interaction sub-network using neighborhood-based benchmarking and multilayer network topology.
We observed many genes with altered expression in WF-exposed tissues were also among differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in RSD tissues; for CB, AS, PE and LC there were 34, 27, 50 and 26 genes respectively. DEG analysis, using disease association networks, pathways, ontological analysis and protein-protein interaction sub-network suggest significant links between WF exposure and the development of CB, AS, PE and LC.
Our network-based analysis and investigation of the genetic links of WFs and RSDs confirm a number of genes and gene products are plausible participants in RSD development. Our results are a significant resource to identify causal influences on the development of RSDs, particularly in the context of WF exposure.
Glyphosate (GLY) is considered the most used herbicide in the world and has been associated with several environmental contamination risks. Despite being partially degraded by soil microorganisms, its residues can negatively affect the growth of valuable non-target plants. Thus, there is a need to find new strategies that minimize its impacts and enhance crop tolerance to GLY, allowing a more advantageous and safer, use of this herbicide. Salicylic acid (SA) is a hormone-like substance, able to enhance the efficiency of the antioxidant (AOX) system in plants and their tolerance to oxidative stress. This study aimed to unveil the effects of SA (100 μM) on the oxidative status of Hordeum vulgare L. in response to GLY (30 mg kg-1). After 14 days of growth, the presence of GLY led to a significant inhibition of growth, an accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide anion (O2-), an increase in lipid peroxidation (LP), proline and non-protein thiols, a decrease of the content of reduced ascorbate (AsA) and an upregulation of AOX enzymes. The exogenous application of SA mitigated the effects of GLY on growth, amount of H2O2 and degree of PL. It has also contributed to the reduction of AsA content, production of non-protein thiols and increased AOX enzymatic activity, particularly superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and gluthatione S-transferase (GST). These results show a positive role of SA against GLY induced oxidative stress, by modulating the AOX capacity of barley plants. However, the observed phytotoxicity of GLY was so pronounced, that the ameliorating effect of SA on AOX defenses was not enough to significantly overcome the herbicide-induced oxidative damage.
Ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/R) is one of the leading causes of acute kidney injury (AKI) that typically occurs in renal surgeries. However, renal I/R still currently lacks effective therapeutic targets. In this study, we proved that inhibition of Brd4 with its selective inhibitor, JQ1, could exert a protective role in renal I/R injury in mice. Inhibiting Brd4 with either JQ1 or genetic knockdown resulted in reduction of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-associated protein and proapoptotic protein expression both in I/R-induced injury and hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) stimulation in HK-2 cells. H/R-induced apoptosis and ERS depended on oxidative stress in vitro. Moreover, FoxO4, which is involved in the generation of hydrogen peroxide, was up-regulated during H/R stimulation-mediated apoptosis and ERS, and this upregulation could be abolished by Brd4 inhibition. Consistently, FoxO4-mediated ROS generation was attenuated upon inhibition of Brd4 with JQ1 or siRNA against Brd4. Further, the transcriptional activity of FoxO4 was suppressed by PI3K and AKT phosphorylation, which are upstream signals of FoxO4 expression, and were enhanced by Brd4 both in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, our results proved that Brd4 inhibition blocked renal apoptotic and ERS protein expression by preventing FoxO4-dependent ROS generation through the PI3K/AKT pathway, indicating that Brd4 could be a potential therapeutic target for renal I/R injury.
The aim of the present study was to investigate the anti-osteoporotic activity of Baohuoside I, an active component of Herba Epimedii. Effects of Baohuoside I on the differentiation of BMSCs and the formation of adipocytes were evaluated using alkaline phosphatase staining and methylene blue staining method, respectively. Osteoporosis model was established in ovariectomized rats prior to the measurement of the serum SOD and MDA levels as well as the expression of inflammatory cytokines protein in the rats' tissues after treatment with Baohuoside I using ELISA assay kits. The estrogen-like effect of Baohuoside I was also measured on HeLa cells. The positive rates of ALP staining in Baohuoside I groups were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.01) compared with the normal group, with no obvious adipocyte formation observed in the groups that received Baohuoside I treatments. The levels of inflammatory markers (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8) in the treated groups were significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) than in the model group. Likewise, the treated groups exhibited a significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) serum levels of MDA compared with the model group, while SOD levels were markedly lower (p &lt; 0.05) in a dose-dependent fashion. Baohuoside I showed no estrogen-like effect on HeLa cells upon treatment with the drug. Collectively, these results indicated that the anti-osteoporotic activity of Baohuoside I could be related to the induction of BMSCs differentiation into osteoblasts coupled with the inhibition of adipocyte formation, regulation of immune functions, and antioxidant activity.
Overlapping genes represent an intriguing puzzle, as they encode two proteins whose ability to evolve is constrained by each other. Overlapping genes can undergo "symmetric evolution" (similar selection pressures on the two proteins) or "asymmetric evolution" (significantly different selection pressures on the two proteins). By sequence analysis of 75 pairs of homologous viral overlapping genes, I evaluated their accordance with one or the other model. Analysis of nucleotide and amino acid sequences revealed that half of overlaps undergo asymmetric evolution, as the protein from one frame shows a number of substitutions significantly higher than that of the protein from the other frame. Interestingly, the most variable protein (often known to interact with the host proteins) appeared to be encoded by the de novo frame in all cases examined. These findings suggest that overlapping genes, besides to increase the coding ability of viruses, are also a source of selective protein adaptation.
Targeted protein degradation using Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) has emerged as a novel therapeutic modality in drug discovery. PROTACs mediate the degradation of select proteins of interest (POIs) by hijacking the activity of E3 ubiquitin ligases for POI ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome. This hijacking mechanism has been used to degrade various types of disease-relevant POIs. In this review, we aim to highlight the recent advances in targeted protein degradation and describe the challenges that need to be addressed in order to efficiently develop potent PROTACs.
ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters belong to a large protein superfamily found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. In arthropods, ABC transporters are involved in defense and resistance to insecticides. The Asian citrus psyllid (ACP), Diaphorina citri, is a major vector of the Huanglongbing pathogen (Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus) worldwide. In this study, the ABC transporter genes were identified based on the transcriptome and genome database of D. citri. A total of 44 DcitABC transporters were identified and grouped into 8 subfamilies (ABCA-ABCH), including 4 DcitABCAs, 4 Bs, 5 Cs, 2 Ds, 1 E, 3 Fs, 15 Gs and 10 Hs, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of ABC transporters revealed a close relationship between D. citri and Laodelphax striatellus. qPCR analyses showed that several DcitABC transporters were highly expressed in fat body, midgut and the hindgut with Malpighian tubules. In particular, DcitABCG11 and DcitABCG14 were most highly expressed in the hindgut. The transcript abundance of 11 DcitABC genes was significantly upregulated upon exposure to an LC50 concentration of imidacloprid. The expressions of three cytochrome P450 genes and one glutathione S-transferase gene were also significantly elevated. This suggested that DcitABC genes, together with metabolic enzyme genes, are associated with imidacloprid detoxification.
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) were generated from skin fibroblasts obtained from a 58 year-old woman suffering from Alzheimer's disease and carrying a D694N mutation on Amyloid precursor protein (APP). Fibroblasts were reprogrammed into iPSC using the integration-free Sendai Virus which allows the expression of the Yamanaka factors. Verification of their pluripotency was achieved by demonstrating the expression of pluripotency markers and their differentiation potential into the three primary germ layers. The cells have the corresponding mutation and present a normal karyotype. The reported APP-D694N iPSC line may be used to model and study human AD pathology in vitro.
Mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) is a major bioactive metabolite in the widely used industrial plasticizer diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) that has been found to be toxic to the liver. The aim of this study is to determine whether MEHP exposure can change the expression of fatty acid metabolism-related genes in HepG2 cells, which might be related to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The results revealed that exposure to MEHP promoted lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. The levels of intracellular triglycerides in the hepatocytes increased after exposure to 0.8-100 μM MEHP for 24 h and 48 h. The genetic expressions of SREBP-1c, ChREBP, ACC1, FASN, and SCD significantly increased at 6 h after exposure to MEHP. At 24 h, the expression of the SREBP-1c and ChREBP genes remained increased, while the expression of the FASN and SCD genes decreased. At 48 h, the expression of SREBP-1c, ChREBP, ACC1, FASN, and SCD decreased. Furthermore, the levels of proteins including ACC1, FASN, SCD, and ChREBP (except SREBP-1c) increased at 24 h. These findings suggest that MEHP exposure can promote fatty acid synthesis in hepatocytes by regulating the expression of relevant genes and proteins, contributing to NAFLD.
The aims of this study were: to examine regional rates of change in tau-PET uptake and grey matter volume in atypical Alzheimer's disease (AD); to investigate the role of age in such changes; to describe multimodal regional relationships between tau accumulation and atrophy. Thirty atypical AD patients underwent baseline and one-year follow-up MRI, [18F]AV-1451 PET and PiB PET. Region- and voxel-level rates of tau accumulation and grey matter atrophy relative to cognitively unimpaired individuals, and the influence of age on such rates, were assessed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed between baseline measurements and rates of change, between baseline tau and atrophy, and between the two rates of change. Regional patterns of change in tau and volume differed, with highest rates of tau accumulation in frontal lobe and highest rates of atrophy in temporoparietal regions. Age had a negative effect on disease progression, predominantly on tau, with younger patients having a more rapid accumulation. Baseline tau uptake and regions of tau accumulation were disconnected, with high baseline tau uptake across the cortex correlated with high rates of tau accumulation in frontal and sensorimotor regions. In contrast, baseline volume and atrophy were locally related in the occipitoparietal regions. Higher tau uptake at baseline was locally related to higher rates of atrophy in frontal and occipital lobes. Tau accumulation rates positively correlated with rates of atrophy. In summary, our study showed that tau accumulation and atrophy presented different regional patterns in atypical AD, with tau spreading into the frontal lobes while atrophy remains in temporoparietal and occipital cortex, suggesting a temporal disconnect between protein deposition and neurodegeneration.
The development of biofilms by microorganisms is conventionally attributed to microbially induced corrosion on stainless steel surfaces and leads to severe consequences in industrial and environmental settings. Since bacterial biofilm formation is regulated by the signal mediated quorum sensing (QS) system, targeting biofilms through QS inhibitors will possibly control biologically induced corrosion on the metal surface. In this study, biofilm formation on 316L stainless steel (SS 316L) immersed in a natural pond water system was effectively inhibited in the presence of the QS inhibitor methyl eugenol, as evidenced through epifluorescence microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses. The exopolysaccharide (EPS) and protein extracted from the biofilm formed on the metal surface were found to be reduced by 64% and 60%, respectively, upon exposure to methyl eugenol. In addition, applied electrode potential (open circuit and cathodic) measurements indicated reduced oxygen reduction current at the metal surface that was exposed to methyl eugenol. This inhibitor also enhanced the polarization resistance (Rp) of the SS 316L as indicated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) study.
According to Compendium of Materia Medica, Gastrodia elata (GE) Blume as a top grade and frequently prescribed herbal medicine has been used in treating dizziness, headaches, and epilepsy, indicating a neuroprotective effect. Because GE is capable of suppressing a hyperactive liver and thus calming endogenous wind, and because Huntington's disease (HD) can be classified as a phenomenon of disturbed liver wind, it is suggested that GE might be beneficial in treating HD. However, although current studies support GE for the prevention of diverse neurodegenerations such as HD, its detailed mechanisms remain elusive.
To investigate the molecular mechanism of GE in preventing HD by focusing on mitochondrial morphology, which is highly associated with HD etiology and thus proposed as a therapeutic target of neurodegenerations.
The overexpression of the mutant huntingtin (mHTT) gene in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells was used as an in vitro cell model of HD. A filter retardation assay was applied to measure protein aggregations during HTT expression. Cotransfection with mitochondrial fusion and fission genes was used to test their relationships with HTT aggregates by monitoring with a confocal laser scanning microscope and filter retardation assay. Western blot analysis was used to estimate protein expression under different drug treatments or cotransfections with other related genes.
The overexpression of mutant but not normal HTT genes significantly resulted in protein aggregations in PC12 cells. GE dose-dependently attenuated mHTT-induced protein aggregations and free radical formations. GE significantly reversed mHTT-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and dysregulation of mitochondrial fusion and fission molecules. The overexpression of mitochondrial fusion genes attenuated mHTT-induced protein aggregations. Further, Mdivi-1, a DRP1 fission molecule inhibitor, significantly reversed mHTT-induced protein aggregations and mitochondrial fragmentation.
GE attenuated mHTT aggregations through the control of mitochondrial fusion and the fission pathway.
Emerging evidence has indicated the therapeutic potential of emodin with its multiple pharmacological effects.
To evaluate role of emodin in regulating insulin resistance (IR) and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms.
Fasting blood glucose (FBG) and lipid levels were measured before and after intragastric administration of emodin in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rats. Glucose consumption was determined in L6 cells to investigate the effect of emodin on glucose metabolism. Expression of miR-20b and SMAD7 was quantified by real-time PCR for mRNAs or western blot analysis for proteins.
Emodin ameliorated hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia in T2DM rats, and glucose metabolism in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. MiR-20b was markedly upregulated in the setting of IR and overexpression of miR-20b disrupted glucose metabolism by repressing SMAD7 in L6 cells. Knockdown of this miRNA produced the opposite effects. Emodin abolished the abnormal upregulation of miR-20b and indirectly upregulated SMAD7.
Emodin improves glucose metabolism to produce anti-IR effects, and downregulation of miR-20b thereby upregulation of SMAD7 is an underlying mechanism for the beneficial effects of emodin.
Pseudolaric acid B (PAB), a diterpene acid isolated from the root bark of Pseudolarix kaempferi, exhibits a potent anti-cancer activity in a variety of tumor cells.
The present study was designed to evaluate the anti-cancer effects of PAB on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines in vitro, and to explore the underlying mechanism.
The anti-proliferative activity of PAB on HCC cells were assessed via sulforhodamine B staining, colony formation, cell cycle analysis, respectively. Apoptosis was detected using Annexin V/propidium iodide double staining and diamidino-phenyl-indole staining, respectively. Protein expression regulated by PAB treatment was tested by western blotting.
The present results showed that PAB significantly inhibited the proliferation of HepG2, SK-Hep-1, and Huh-7 HCC cell lines in vitro with IC50 values of 1.58, 1.90, and 2.06 μM, respectively. Furthermore, PAB treatment repressed the colony formation in HepG2, SK-Hep-1, and Huh-7 HCC cell lines. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that PAB caused an obvious cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase and induced apoptosis with the induction of p21, Bax, cleaved-caspase-3, and cleaved-PARP in human HepG2 and SK-Hep-1 cells. Mechanistically, PAB treatment down-regulated the phosphorylation of STAT3, ERK1/2, and Akt. Moreover, abnormal GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling in HepG2 cells was remarkably suppressed by PAB treatment. Finally, proliferation markers including cyclin D1 and c-Myc, and anti-apoptosis proteins such as Bcl-2 and survivin were also down-regulated by PAB treatment in HepG2 cells.
Taken together, our results suggest that PAB exerts anti-cancer activity in HCC cells through inhibition of STAT3, ERK1/2, Akt, and GSK-3β/β-catenin carcinogenic signaling pathways, and may be used as a phytomedicine in the treatment of HCC.
The EZH2 protein endows the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) with histone lysine methyltransferase activity that is associated with transcriptional repression. Recent investigations have documented crucial roles for EZH2 in mediating X-inactivation, stem cell pluripotency and cancer metastasis. However, there is little evidence demonstrating the maternal effect of EZH2 on porcine preimplantation development. Here, we took parthenogenetic activation embryos to eliminate the confounding paternal influence. We showed that the dynamic expression of EZH2 during early development was accompanied by changes in H3K27me3 levels. Depletion of EZH2 in MII oocytes by small interfering RNA not only impaired embryonic development at the blastocyst stage (P &lt; 0.05), but also disrupted the equilibrium of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in the embryo. Interestingly, the expression of TET1, a member of Ten-Eleven Translocation gene family for converting 5-methylcytosine (5 mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), was decreased after EZH2 knockdown, in contrast to the increase of the other two members, TET2 and TET3 (P &lt; 0.05). These results indicate a correlation between histone methylation and DNA methylation, and between EZH2 and TET1. Along with the downregulation of TET1, the expression of the pluripotency gene NANOG was decreased (P &lt; 0.05), which is consistent with a previous finding in mouse ES cells. Meanwhile, the abundance of OCT4 and SOX2 were also down-regulated. Moreover, EZH2 knockdown reduced the capacity of cells in the blastocysts to resist apoptosis. Taken together, our data suggest that EZH2 is integral to the developmental program of porcine parthenogenetic embryos and exerts its function by regulating pluripotency, differentiation and apoptosis.
In order to study the renal function, in terms of glomerular filtration and effective renal plasma flow, in broiler chickens and pigs, an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for the simultaneous determination of iohexol, p-aminohippuric acid (PAH) and exogenously administered creatinine in plasma was developed and validated. Sample preparation consisted of a deproteinization step using methanol for porcine plasma and an Ostro™ Protein Precipitation &amp; Phospholipid Removal Plate was used for broiler chicken plasma. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a Hypersil Gold aQ column using 0.1% formic acid in water and 0.1% formic acid in methanol as mobile phases. The total run time was limited to 10 min. Matrix-matched calibration curves for iohexol and PAH were prepared and good linearity (r ≥ 0.9973; gof ≤ 6.17%) was achieved over the concentration range tested (0.25-90 μg/mL). Limits of quantification were 0.25 μg/mL for iohexol and PAH. Water was used as surrogate matrix for analysis of creatinine in plasma. This surrogate calibration curve showed good linearity over the concentration range tested (0.25-90 μg/mL) (r ≥ 0.9979; gof ≤ 5.66%). For creatinine, the relative lower limit of quantification was 201.03 ± 49.20% and 60.14 ± 7.64% for chicken and porcine plasma, respectively. The results for within-day and between-day precision and accuracy fell within the specified ranges. This straightforward, cost-effective and rapid method, determining iohexol, PAH and creatinine within one single chromatographic run, has been successfully used for the analysis in porcine and broiler chicken plasma samples in order to determine the renal function of these species.
Three-dimensional (3D) multicellular aggregates, in comparison to two-dimensional monolayer culture, can provide tissue culture models that better recapitulate the abundant cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions found in vivo. In addition, aggregates are potentially useful building blocks for tissue engineering. However, control over the interior aggregate microenvironment is challenging due to inherent barriers for diffusion of biological mediators (e.g. growth factors) throughout the multicellular aggregates. Previous studies have shown that incorporation of biomaterials into multicellular aggregates can support cell survival and control differentiation of stem cell aggregates by delivering morphogens from within the 3D construct. In this study, we developed a highly efficient microparticle-based gene delivery approach to uniformly transfect human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSC) within multicellular aggregates and cell sheets. We hypothesized that release of plasmid DNA (pDNA) lipoplexes from mineral-coated microparticles (MCMs) within 3D hMSC constructs would improve transfection in comparison to standard free pDNA lipoplex delivery in the media. Our approach increased transfection efficiency 5-fold over delivery of free pDNA lipoplexes in the media and resulted in homogenous distribution of transfected cells throughout the 3D constructs. Additionally, we found that MCMs improved hMSC transfection by specifically increasing macropinocytosis-mediated uptake of pDNA. Finally, we showed up to a three-fold increase of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) expression and enhanced calcium deposition within 3D hMSC constructs following MCM-mediated delivery of a BMP-2 encoding plasmid and culture in osteogenic medium. The technology described here provides a valuable tool for achieving efficient and homogenous transfection of 3D cell constructs and is therefore of particular value in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This original research describes a materials-based approach, whereby use of mineral-coated microparticles improves the efficiency of non-viral gene delivery in three-dimensional human mesenchymal stromal cell constructs. Specifically, it demonstrates the use of mineral-coated microparticles to enable highly efficient transfection of human mesenchymal stromal cells in large, 3D culture formats. The manuscript also identifies specific endocytosis pathways that interact with the mineral coating to afford the improved transfection efficiency, as well as demonstrates the utility of this approach toward improving differentiation of large cell constructs. We feel that this manuscript will impact the current understanding and near-term development of materials for non-viral gene delivery in broad tissue engineering and biofabrication applications, and therefore be of interest to a diverse biomaterials audience.
Electrospun yarns offer substantial opportunities for the fabrication of elastic scaffolds for flexible tissue engineering applications. Currently available yarns are predominantly made of synthetic elastic materials. Thus scaffolds made from these yarns typically lack cell signaling cues. This can result in poor integration or even rejection on implantation, which drive demands for a new generation of yarns made from natural biologically compatible materials. Here, we present a new type of cell-attractive, highly twisted protein-based yarns made from blended tropoelastin and silk fibroin. These yarns combine physical and biological benefits by being rendered elastic and bioactive through the incorporation of tropoelastin and strengthened through the presence of silk fibroin. Remarkably, the process delivered multi-meter long yarns of tropoelastin-silk mixture that were conducive to fabrication of meshes on hand-made frames. The resulting hydrated meshes are elastic and cell interactive. Furthermore, subcutaneous implantation of the meshes in mice demonstrates their tolerance and persistence over 8 weeks. This combination of mechanical properties, biocompatibility and processability into diverse shapes and patterns underscores the value of these materials and platform technology for tissue engineering applications. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Synthetic yarns are used to fabricate textile materials for various applications such as surgical meshes for hernia repair and pelvic organ prolapse. However, synthetic materials lack the attractive biological and physical cues characteristic of extracellular matrix and there is a demand for materials that can minimize postoperative complications. To address this need, we made yarns from a combination of recombinant human tropoelastin and silk fibroin using a modified electrospinning approach that blended these proteins into functional yarns. Prior to this study, no protein-based yarns using tropoelastin were available for the fabrication of functional textile materials. Multimeter-long, uniform and highly twisted yarns based on these proteins were elastic and cell interactive and demonstrated processing to yield textile fabrics. By using these yarns to weave fabrics, we demonstrate that an elastic human matrix protein blend can deliver a versatile platform technology to make textiles that can be explored for efficacy in tissue repair.
An impaired trophoblast invasion ability contributes to the development of pre-eclampsia (PE), and can be induced by the altered expression of various microRNAs (miRs). MiR-141 and CXCL12β (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12) signaling regulate trophoblast invasion and vascularization capabilities during PE pathogenesis; however, their interactions and underlying mechanisms of action remain unclear. We investigated how miR-141 modulates trophoblast invasion, with a focus on its interaction with CXCL12β signaling.
A PE model was established by using HTR-8/SVneo cells, which were first cultured with 2% O2 for 48 h, and then with 5% O2. The expression of miR-141 in human villous trophoblast HTR-8/SVneo cells was modulated with mimics or an inhibitor, and analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. CXCL12β levels were determined by ELISA. Cell apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry, and the invasion and vascularization capabilities of trophoblasts were evaluated by Transwell and tube formation assays, respectively. Binding of miR-141 with CXCL12β mRNA was verified by the dual luciferase assay. Protein levels were estimated by western blotting.
MiR-141 expression was significantly induced by hypoxia in HTR-8/SVneo cells. MiR-141 was found to promote apoptosis and inhibit the invasion and vascularization abilities of HTR-8/SVneo cells under conditions of hypoxia. MiR-141 could directly bind with the 3'UTR region of CXCL12β mRNA and inhibit its translation. In addition, we proved that miR-141 could inhibit the invasion and vascularization abilities, and promote the apoptosis of HTR-8/SVneo cells by targeting CXCL12β under hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrated that arachidonic acid could reverse the invasion and apoptosis abilities of HTR-8/SVneo cells mediated by CXCL12β during hypoxia. In terms of mechanism, MiR-141 could downregulate MMP2, p62, and LC3B expression, and upregulate ROCK1 and RhoA expression in HTR-8/SVneo cells by targeting the CXCL12β gene during hypoxia. The effects of CXCL12βon HTR-8/SVneo cells could be reversed by arachidonic acid (ARA).
Induction of miR-141 by hypoxia promotes apoptosis, and inhibits the invasion and vascularization capabilities of HTR-8/SVneo cells by suppressing the CXCL12β and CXCR2/4 signaling pathways.
We performed 16S rDNA sequencing of tilapia fecal samples to analyze changes in tilapia gut contents after cultivation of the fish in the presence of sandwich-like floating beds of Chinese medicinal herbs (5 and 10% planting-areas; 5% Polygonum cuspidatum). The interactive effects between water quality and blood and hepatic pro- and anti-inflammatory concentrations were also assessed. Our results showed that the water quality (i.e., NO3--N, NO2--N, TP removal rates) improved, and the abundance of Chloroflexi and Cyanobacteria increased. The abundance of Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, Saccharibacteria, and Actinobacteria showed both significant seasonal decreases and increases in the presence of P. cuspidatum (increases in August and decreases in July). Fish blood and hepatic IL-10 and IFN-γ levels (together with fish sampled in September) significantly increased in the P. cuspidatum group sampled in August, while those of TNF-α (10% sandwich-like, P. cuspidatum), IL-1β (P. cuspidatum), IL-8 (5% sandwich-like in September, S905S) significantly decreased. Heat shock proteins 60 and 70 levels significantly increased in the P. cuspidatum group, and complement C3 and C4 concentrations significantly increased in S905S. This study demonstrated that enhanced immunity through the regulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory proteins was sustained throughout development until harvest, particularly in fish grown with P. cuspidatum.
An 8 weeks feeding experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary supplementation with hydrolyzed yeast (HY) (Rhodotorula mucilaginosa) on growth performance, hematological parameters, immune response and antioxidant ability of juvenile Nile tilapia. Five isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets (32% protein and 4% lipid) with different levels (0%, 0.125%, 0.25%, 0.5%, 1%) of HY were formulated. Each diet was randomly assigned to quadruplicate groups of fish (initial body weight 19.1 ± 0.01 g). Results indicated that significantly higher specific growth rate (SGR) and lower feed conversion rate (FCR) were obtained in fish fed 1% HY diet than that of fish fed 0% HY diet (P &lt; 0.05). Fish fed 0.25% HY diet showed the lowest value of hepatopancreas somatic indices (HSI) and significantly lower than that of fish fed 0% HY diet (P &lt; 0.05). Meanwhile, protein and ash in the whole-body content of fish fed 1% HY diet was significantly higher than that of fish fed 0%-0.5% HY diets. Serum immunological parameters showed that the lysozyme (LZM) activity and Complement C3 content were significantly increased by dietary supplementation of 0.5%-1% HY (P &lt; 0.05). However, dietary supplementation with 0.125%-1% HY significantly decreased the activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) (P &lt; 0.05). Antioxidant status in serum and liver was significantly enhanced by dietary supplementation of 0.25%-1% HY through the remarkably improved superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity both in serum and liver, the raised total antioxidative capacity (T-AOC) of serum as well as the notably reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the liver (P &lt; 0.05). However, T-AOC in the liver was not significantly influenced among all diet treatments (P &gt; 0.05). Villi height and intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEFs) of mid-intestine were significantly higher in fish fed 0.5%-1% HY diets (P &lt; 0.05). The challenge test demonstrated the enhanced protection against Streptococcus iniae strain by the obtained higher cumulative survival rate. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of 1% HY could maintain the better growth performance, nutrient composition as well as immune response and antioxidant capacity for juvenile Nile tilapia.
Bcl-xL is a member of the Bcl-2 family of apoptotic regulators, responsible for inhibiting the permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane, and a promising anti-cancer target. Bcl-xL exists in the following conformations, each believed to play a role in the inhibition of apoptosis: (a) a soluble folded conformation, (b) a membrane-anchored (by its C-terminal α8 helix) form, which retains the same fold as in solution and (c) refolded membrane-inserted conformations, for which no structural data are available. Previous studies established that in the cell Bcl-xL exists in a dynamic equilibrium between soluble and membranous states, however, no direct evidence exists in support of either anchored or inserted conformation of the membranous state in vivo. In this in vitro study, we employed a combination of fluorescence and EPR spectroscopy to characterize structural features of the bilayer-inserted conformation of Bcl-xL and the lipid modulation of its membrane insertion transition. Our results indicate that the core hydrophobic helix α6 inserts into the bilayer without adopting a transmembrane orientation. This insertion disrupts the packing of Bcl-xL and releases the regulatory N-terminal BH4 domain (a1) from the rest of the protein structure. Our data demonstrate that both insertion and refolding of Bcl-xL are modulated by lipid composition. We hypothesize that conformational rearrangements associated with the bilayer insertion of Bcl-xL result in its switching to a so-called non-canonical mode of apoptotic inhibition. Presented results suggest that the alteration in lipid composition before and during apoptosis can serve as an additional factor regulating the permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane.
The dynamic variability of transcription factors (TFs) and their binding sites makes it challenging to conduct genome-wide transcription regulation research. The silkworm Bombyx mori, which produces silk, is one of the most valuable model insects in the order Lepidoptera. The "opening" and "closing" of chromatin in different silk yield strains is associated with changes in silk production, making this insect a good model for studying the transcriptional regulation of genes. However, few studies have examined the open chromatin regions (OCRs) of silkworms, and studying OCR synergism and their function in silk production remains challenging. Here, we performed formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) to isolate OCRs from the silk glands of fifth-instar larvae of the DaZao and D872 strains. In total, 128,908 high confidence OCRs were identified and approximately 80% of OCRs were located in non-coding regions. OCRs upregulated adjacent genes and showed signal-dependent vulnerability to single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Mid- and low-signal OCRs were more likely to have single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). Further, OCRs interacted with each other within a distance of 5 kb. We named the OCR interaction complex as the "cluster of related regions" (COREs). The functions of the CORE and its harbored OCRs showed some differences. Additionally, COREs enriched many silk protein synthesis-associated genes, some of which were upregulated. This study identified numerous high confidence regulation sites and synergistic regulatory modes of OCRs that affect adjacent genes. These results provide insight into silkworm transcriptional regulation and improve our understanding of cis-element cooperation.
The liver is the primary organ for the metabolic degradation of xenobiotics. Transmembrane transport proteins from the ABC and the SLC families mediate the uptake of endogenous compounds and xenobiotics into the hepatocyte as well as their elimination from the cells. Multiple processes are involved. The uptake of xenobiotics in hepatocytes is mediated by organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) and by organic anion and cation transporters (OATs and OCTs). The elimination of drugs and metabolites from the liver cell back to the bloodstream is accomplished mainly by multidrug resistance-associated protein 3 (MRP3) and MRP4, while the elimination towards the biliary canaliculi is mediated by several different transporters (MRP2, BCRP, MDR1 and MATE1). Since bile acids and their salts are toxic detergents for hepatocytes, they have to be eliminated efficiently. This task is accomplished by the bile salt export pump BSEP. Two further transporters, MDR3 and ATP8B1 are involved in the proper constitution of bile. All these transporters can be influenced, mainly inhibited by a number of drugs, but also by metabolites from endogenous compounds such as estrogens. Additionally, rare monogenetic diseases exist which can be explained by absence of function or dysfunction of specific hepatic transporters, such as progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 2 by genetic modifications in BSEP that lead to a loss of transporter function. Functional impairment of other transporters by genetics or by drugs also leads to liver injury, a potentially life-threatening disease that is still not fully understood. Hence, the interplay between drugs and hepatic transporters is multiple, and the knowledge of this interplay helps in understanding the etiology and molecular mechanisms behind some forms of (drug-induced) liver injury.
Convulsive status epilepticus is associated with subsequent hippocampal damage and development of mesial temporal sclerosis in a subset of individuals. The lithium pilocarpine model of status epilepticus (SE) in the rat provides a model in which to investigate the molecular and pathogenic process leading to hippocampal damage. In this study, a 2-DE-based approach was used to detect proteome changes in the hippocampus, at an early stage (2 days) after SE, when increased T2 values were detectable by magnetic resonance imaging. Gel image analysis was followed by LC-MS/MS identification of protein species that differed in abundance between pilocarpine-treated and control rats. The most significantly up-regulated species in the experimental animals was identified as heat shock 27-kDa protein, in line with findings in humans and in other experimental models of epilepsy. Additional up-regulated species included dihydropyrimidinase-related protein-2, cytoskeletal proteins (alpha-tubulin and ezrin) and dihydropteridine reductase. In summary, the hippocampus of rats subject to pilocarpine-induced SE exhibits specific changes in protein abundance, which likely relate to pathogenic, neuroprotective and neurogenic responses.
A major problem in the treatment of cancer is the specific targeting of drugs to these abnormal cells. Ideally, such a drug should act over short distances to minimize damage to healthy cells and target subcellular compartments that have the highest sensitivity to the drug. We describe the novel approach of using modular recombinant transporters to target photosensitizers to the nucleus, where their action is most pronounced, of cancer cells overexpressing ErbB1 receptors. We have produced a new generation of the transporters consisting of (a) epidermal growth factor as the internalizable ligand module to ErbB1 receptors, (b) the optimized nuclear localization sequence of SV40 large T-antigen, (c) a translocation domain of diphtheria toxin as an endosomolytic module, and (d) the Escherichia coli hemoglobin-like protein HMP as a carrier module. The modules retained their functions within the transporter chimera: they showed high-affinity interactions with ErbB1 receptors and alpha/beta-importin dimers and formed holes in lipid bilayers at endosomal pH. A photosensitizer conjugated with the transporter produced singlet oxygen and (*)OH radicals similar to the free photosensitizer. Photosensitizers-transporter conjugates have &gt;3,000 times greater efficacy than free photosensitizers for target cells and were not photocytotoxic at these concentrations for cells expressing a few ErbB1 receptors per cell, in contrast to free photosensitizers. The different modules of the transporters, which are highly expressed and easily purified to retain full activity of each of the modules, are interchangeable, meaning that they can be tailored for particular applications.
Microbial flavohaemoglobins are proteins with homology to haemoglobins from higher organisms, but clearly linked to nitric oxide (NO) metabolism by bacteria and yeast. hmp mutant strains of several bacteria are hypersensitive to NO and related compounds and hmp genes are up-regulated by the presence of NO. The regulatory mechanisms involved in hmp induction by NO and the superoxide-generating agent, methyl viologen (paraquat; PQ), are complex, but progressively being resolved. Here we show for the first time that, in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, hmp transcription is increased on exposure to PQ and demonstrate that RamA, a homologue of MarA is responsible for most of the hmp paraquat regulation. In addition we demonstrate NO-dependent elevation of Salmonella hmp transcription and Hmp accumulation. In both Escherichia coli and Salmonella modest transcriptional repression of hmp is exerted by the iron responsive transcriptional repressor Fur. Finally, in contrast to previous reports, we show that in E. coli and Salmonella, hmp induction by both paraquat and sodium nitroprusside is further elevated in a fur mutant background, indicating that additional regulators are implicated in this control process.
Staphylococcus aureus is a highly virulent human pathogen with an extensive array of strategies to subvert the innate immune response. An important aspect of innate immunity is the production of the nitrogen monoxide radical (Nitric Oxide, NO.). Here we describe an adaptive response to nitrosative stress that allows S. aureus to replicate at high concentrations of NO.. Microarray analysis revealed 84 staphylococcal genes with significantly altered expression following NO. exposure. Of these, 30 are involved with iron-homeostasis, potentially under the control of the Fur regulator. Another seven induced genes are involved in hypoxic/fermentative metabolism, including the flavohaemoprotein, Hmp. The SrrAB two-component system has been shown to regulate the expression of many of the NO.-induced metabolic genes. Indeed, inactivation of hmp, srrAB and fur resulted in heightened NO. sensitivity. Hmp was responsible for c. 90% of measurable staphylococcal NO. consumption and therefore critical for efficient NO. detoxification. While SrrAB was required for maximal hmp expression, srrAB mutants still exhibited significant NO. scavenging and NO.-dependent induction of hmp. Yet S. aureus lacking SrrAB were more sensitive to nitrosative stress than hmp mutants, indicating that the contribution of SrrAB to NO. resistance extends beyond the regulation of hmp expression. Both Hmp and SrrAB were required for full virulence in a murine sepsis model, however, only the attenuation of the hmp mutant was restored by the abrogation of host NO. production. Thus, the S. aureus Hmp protein has evolved to serve as an iNOS-dependent virulence determinant.
The interaction of the recombinant hemoglobin from Vitreoscilla sp. (VHb) with the bacterial membrane of Escherichia coli cells has been investigated by measuring the propensity of VHb to interact with monolayers formed by natural bacterial phosholipids. The measurements showed that the protein is capable of penetrating the monolayers, possibly establishing interactions with the hydrophobic acyl chains. VHb is also capable of binding reversibly phospholipids and free fatty acids in solution with a strong selectivity toward cyclopropanated acyl chain species. Lipid binding occurs within the distal heme pocket as demonstrated by a sharp UV-vis spectral change corresponding to a five-coordinate to six-coordinate transition of the heme-iron ferric derivative. Oxygen binding properties are affected by the presence of the lipid component within the active site. In particular, the oxygen affinity is decreased by more than 20-fold in the presence of cyclopropanated phospholipids. The kinetic counterpart of the decrease in oxygen affinity is manifest in a 10-fold decrease in the ligand combination kinetics. Accordingly, the CO and NO combination kinetics were also significantly affected by the presence of the bound lipid within the active site. These studies indicate that the current functional hypotheses about VHb should take into account the association of the protein within the cytoplasmic membrane as well as the presence of a phospholipid within the active site. These data suggest a possible lipid-induced regulation of oxygen affinity as the basis of VHb functioning.
As a consequence of reductive genome evolution, the obligate intracellular pathogen Mycobacterium leprae has minimized the repertoire of genes implicated in defense against reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Genes for multiple hemoglobin types coexist in mycobacterial genomes, but M. leprae has retained only glbO, encoding a group-II truncated hemoglobin. Mycobacterium tuberculosis GlbO has been involved in oxygen transfer and respiration during hypoxia, but a role in protection from nitric oxide (NO) has not been documented yet. Here, we report that the in vitro reaction of oxygenated recombinant M. leprae GlbO with NO results in an immediate stoichiometric formation of nitrate, concomitant with heme-protein oxidation. Overexpression of GlbO alleviates the growth inhibition of Escherichia colihmp (flavohemoglobin gene) mutants in the presence of NO-donors, partly complementing the defect in Hmp synthesis. A promoter element upstream of glbO was predicted in silico, and confirmed by using a glbO::lacZ transcriptional fusion in the heterologous Mycobacterium smegmatis system. The glbO::lacZ fusion was expressed through the whole growth cycle of M. smegmatis, and moderately induced by NO. We propose that M. leprae, by retaining the unique truncated hemoglobin GlbO, may have coupled O2 delivery to the terminal oxidase with a defensive mechanism to scavenge NO from respiratory enzymes. These activities would help to sustain the obligate aerobic metabolism required for intracellular survival of leprosy bacilli.
Deficiency of human dihydropteridine reductase (hDHPR) causes malignant hyperphenylalaninemia. We report the isolation of a cDNA clone for hDHPR that spans the complete coding region, and present the nucleotide sequence and the predicted amino acid sequence. The hDHPR protein does not share extensive homology with the enzymatically related protein human dihydrofolate reductase. Patients with hDHPR deficiency were analysed for the presence of hDHPR cross-reacting protein, mRNA encoding hDHPR, and chromosomal DNA rearrangements. The results show that this inherited error of metabolism can result from a variety of mutations. However, no major rearrangements were seen in 11 patients analysed by Southern blotting. Three RFLPs were found with the restriction endonucleases AvaII and MspI. These RFLPs are useful for prenatal diagnosis of hDHPR deficiency.
The crystal structure of adenosine deaminase (ADA) from bovine intestine complexed with a transition-state analogue, 6-hydroxy-1,6-dihydropurine riboside (HDPR), was solved at 2.5 A resolution by the molecular-replacement method using a homology model based on the crystal structure of mouse ADA. The final refinement converged to a crystallographic R factor of 20.7%. The C(alpha) backbone of bovine ADA is mostly superimposable on that of mouse ADA, although mouse ADA itself did not lead to a solution by molecular replacement. HDPR tightly interacts with ADA by means of six hydrogen bonds and is entirely enclosed within the active site. The lid of the envelope consists of two components: one contains two leucine residues, Leu55 and Leu59, and the other contains the backbone atoms Asp182 and Glu183. The C(delta) atoms of the two leucine residues are 3.5 A from the respective N atoms of the backbone. A weak interaction, similar to CH-pi binding, might make it possible to open the lid. Taking account of the movement and observation of this structural feature, the aim is to design novel ADA inhibitors.
Adenosine deaminase, which catalyzes the irreversible hydrolytic deamination of adenosine nucleosides to inosine nucleosides and ammonia, is a key enzyme in purine metabolism and lymphoid development. The X-ray structures of murine adenosine deaminase with bound potent inhibitors (Ki values approximately 10(-13) M) (8R)-hydroxyl-2'-deoxycoformycin (pentostatin), a transition state analogue, and (6S)-hydroxyl-1,6-dihydropurine riboside, a reaction coordinate analogue, have been determined and refined to resolutions of 2.6 and 1.95 A, respectively. Crystals of both complexes were obtained at pH 7, where the enzyme is fully active, in an identical space group with the asymmetric unit containing four molecules. In addition to the very high degree of similarity between the four independent molecules in each complex structure, there is also considerable structural similarity of the complex with the dihydropurine riboside with that of an identical complex previously determined at pH 4.2 where the enzyme is 20% active. The interactions between the enzyme and the two analogues are extremely similar. These include the coordination of the 8R- or 6S-hydroxyl group of the analogues to the Zn2+ which mainly contributes to the strong potency and very high degree of stereospecificity of inhibition by these analogues. The interactions are further indicative of the structural and chemical requirements of substrates. These structures and recent site-directed mutagenesis have further shed light on the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme.
The Protein Data Bank (PDB) has been processed to extract a screening protein library (sc-PDB) of 2148 entries. A knowledge-based detection algorithm has been applied to 18,000 PDB files to find regular expressions corresponding to either protein, ions, co-factors, solvent, or ligand atoms. The sc-PDB database comprises high-resolution X-ray structures of proteins for which (i) a well-defined active site exists, (ii) the bound-ligand is a small molecular weight molecule. The database has been screened by an inverse docking tool derived from the GOLD program to recover the known target of four unrelated ligands. Both the database and the inverse screening procedures are accurate enough to rank the true target of the four investigated ligands among the top 1% scorers, with 70-100 fold enrichment with respect to random screening. Applying the proposed screening procedure to a small-sized generic ligand was much less accurate suggesting that inverse screening shall be reserved to rather selective compounds.
We have used time-dependent saturation transferred NOE (STNOE) measurements to assign two downfield resonances in the proton spectrum of an adenosine deaminase-purine riboside mixture. Our results show that this method can be used to detect structural changes that occur upon inhibitor binding to the enzyme and to determine which protons of the bound inhibitor are strongly hydrogen bonded in the complex.
Sophoridine is a type of alkaloid extract derived from the Chinese herb Sophora flavescens Ait (kushen) and possess a variety of pharmacological effects including anti-inflammation, anti-anaphylaxis, anti-cancer, anti-arrhythmic and so on. However, the effect of sophoridine on heart failure has not been known yet. In this study, the effect of sophoridine on heart failure was investigated using Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat model of chronic heart failure. Morphological results showed that in medium and high dose group, myofilaments were arranged orderly and closely, intermyofibrillar lysis disappeared and mitochondria contained tightly packed cristae compared with heart failure group. We investigated the Ca(2+) induced Ca(2+) transients and assessed the expression of ryanodine receptor (RyR2) and L-type Ca(2+) channel (dihydropyridine receptor, DHPR). We found that the cytosolic Ca(2+) transients were markedly increased in amplitude in medium (deltaF/F(0)=43.33+/-1.92) and high dose groups (deltaF/F(0)=47.21+/-1.25) compared with heart failure group (deltaF/F(0)=16.7+/-1.29, P&lt;0.01), Moreover, we demonstrated that the expression of cardiac DHPR was significantly increased in medium- and high dose-group compared with heart failure rats. Our results suggest that sophoridine could improve heart failure by ameliorating cardiac Ca(2+) induced Ca(2+) transients, and that this amelioration is associated with upregulation of DHPR.
Nuclear Ca(2+) is important for the regulation of several nuclear processes such as gene expression. Localized Ca(2+) signals (LCSs) in skeletal muscle fibers of mice have been mainly studied as Ca(2+) release events from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Their location with regard to cell nuclei has not been investigated. Our study is based on the hypothesis that LCSs associated with nuclei are present in skeletal muscle fibers of adult mice. Therefore, we carried out experiments addressing this question and we found novel Ca(2+) signals associated with nuclei of skeletal muscle fibers (with possibly attached satellite cells). We measured localized nuclear and perinuclear Ca(2+) signals (NLCSs and PLCSs) alongside cytosolic localized Ca(2+) signals (CLCSs) during a hypertonic treatment. We also observed NLCSs under isotonic conditions. The NLCSs and PLCSs are Ca(2+) signals in the range of micrometer [FWHM (full width at half maximum): 2.75 ± 0.27 μm (NLCSs) and 2.55 ± 0.17 μm (PLCSs), S.E.M.]. Additionally, global nuclear Ca(2+) signals (NGCSs) were observed. To investigate which type of Ca(2+) channels contribute to the Ca(2+) signals associated with nuclei in skeletal muscle fibers, we performed measurements with the RyR blocker dantrolene, the DHPR blocker nifedipine or the IP3R blocker Xestospongin C. We observed Ca(2+) signals associated with nuclei in the presence of each blocker. Nifedipine and dantrolene had an inhibitory effect on the fraction of fibers with PLCSs. The situation for the fraction of fibers with NLCSs is more complex indicating that RyR is less important for the generation of NLCSs compared to the generation of PLCSs. The fraction of fibers with NLCSs and PLCSs is not reduced in the presence of Xestospongin C. The localized perinuclear and intranuclear Ca(2+) signals may be a powerful tool for the cell to regulate adaptive processes as gene expression. The intranuclear Ca(2+) signals may be particularly interesting in this respect. 
In skeletal muscle, Ca(2+) release from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) following the action potential relies on the delicate architecture of the T-Tubule/SR junction. The T-Tubule/SR junction comprises two membrane systems: the integral proteins DHPR and RyR1 and the Ca(2+)-buffering apparatus within the SR lumen. The arrangement and interactions of the components have remained elusive due to technological limitations. Here, we determined whether electron tomography is effective fort the in situ determination of the relationships between RyR1 and DHPR, the SR membrane and other involved structures. First, we visually confirmed that RyR1 and DHPR are close neighbors that are mutually staggered with each other and directly interact with one of RyR1 subunits. Second, the Ca(2+) storage network within the SR lumen is directly correlated with RyR1. These results suggest that the excitation of the T-Tubule may induce Ca(2+) release through a direct interaction among DHPR, RyR1 and the Ca(2+) buffering apparatus. These results indicate that electron tomography has potential as an efficient method for the in situ characterization of the complex architecture and arrangement of two integral-integral-membrane proteins in the context of the surrounding phospholipid-bilayer and proteins.
This study investigated the effect of taurine and β-alanine supplementation on muscle function and muscle taurine transporter (TauT) protein expression in mdx mice. Wild-type (WT) and mdx mice (5 months) were supplemented with taurine or β-alanine for 4 weeks, after which in vitro contractile properties, fatigue resistance and force recovery, and the expression of the TauT protein and proteins involved in excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling were examined in fast-twitch muscle. There was no difference in basal TauT protein expression or basal taurine content between mdx than WT muscle. Supplementation with taurine and β-alanine increased and reduced taurine content, respectively, in muscle from WT and mdx mice but had no effect of TauT protein. Taurine supplementation reduced body and muscle mass, and enhanced fatigue resistance and force recovery in mdx muscle. β-Alanine supplementation enhanced fatigue resistance in WT and mdx muscle. There was no difference in the basal expression of key E-C coupling proteins [ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1), dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR), sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 1 (SERCA1) or calsequestrin 1 (CSQ1)] between WT and mdx mice, and the expression of these proteins was not altered by taurine or β-alanine supplementation. These findings suggest that TauT protein expression is relatively insensitive to changes in muscle taurine content in WT and mdx mice, and that taurine and β-alanine supplementation may be viable therapeutic strategies to improve fatigue resistance of dystrophic skeletal muscle.
The core skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1) calcium release complex extends through three compartments of the muscle fibre, linking the extracellular environment through the cytoplasmic junctional gap to the lumen of the internal sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium store. The protein complex is essential for skeletal excitation-contraction (EC)-coupling and skeletal muscle function. Its importance is highlighted by perinatal death if any one of the EC-coupling components are missing and by myopathies associated with mutation of any of the proteins. The proteins essential for EC-coupling include the DHPR α1S subunit in the transverse tubule membrane, the DHPR β1a subunit in the cytosol and the RyR1 ion channel in the SR membrane. The other core proteins are triadin and junctin and calsequestrin, associated mainly with SR. These SR proteins are not essential for survival but exert structural and functional influences that modify the gain of EC-coupling and maintain normal muscle function. This review summarises our current knowledge of the individual protein/protein interactions within the core complex and their overall contribution to EC-coupling. We highlight significant areas that provide a continuing challenge for the field. Additional important components of the Ca2+ release complex, such as FKBP12, calmodulin, S100A1 and Stac3 are identified and reviewed elsewhere.
Skeletal muscle mass and power decrease with age, leading to impairment of mobility and metabolism in the elderly. Ca2+ signaling is crucial for myoblast differentiation as well as muscle contraction through activation of transcription factors and Ca2+-dependent kinases and phosphatases. Ca2+ channels, such as dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR), two-pore channel (TPC) and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (ITPR), function to maintain Ca2+ homeostasis in myoblasts. Here, we observed a significant decrease in expression of type 1 IP3 receptor (ITPR1), but not types 2 and 3, in aged mice skeletal muscle and isolated myoblasts, compared with those of young mice. ITPR1 knockdown using shRNA-expressing viruses in C2C12 myoblasts and tibialis anterior muscle of mice inhibited myotube formation and muscle regeneration after injury, respectively, a typical phenotype of aged muscle. This aging phenotype was associated with repression of muscle-specific genes and activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-Ras-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. ERK inhibition by U0126 not only induced recovery of myotube formation in old myoblasts but also facilitated muscle regeneration after injury in aged muscle. The conserved decline in ITPR1 expression in aged human skeletal muscle suggests utility as a potential therapeutic target for sarcopenia, which can be treated using ERK inhibition strategies.
Critical illness myopathy is an acquired skeletal muscle disorder with severe myosin loss and muscle weakness frequently seen in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. It is unknown if impaired excitation-contraction coupling contributes to the muscle weakness.
We used a unique ICU model where rats were deeply sedated, post-synaptically pharmacologically paralyzed, mechanically ventilated and closely monitored for up to ten days. Single intact fibers from the flexor digitorum brevis muscle were isolated and used to measure force and free myoplasmic [Ca(2+)] ([Ca(2+)]i) during tetanic contractions.
Fibers from ICU rats had 80 % lower tetanic [Ca(2+)]i and produced only 15 % of the force seen in fibers from sham-operated (SHAM) rats. In the presence of 5 mM caffeine, tetanic [Ca(2+)]i was similar in fibers from ICU and SHAM rats but force was 50 % lower in fibers from ICU rats than SHAM rats. Confocal imaging showed disrupted tetanic [Ca(2+)]i transients in fibers from ICU rats compared to SHAM rats. Western blots showed similar levels of Na(+) channel and dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) protein expression, whereas ryanodine receptor (RyR) and sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase 1 (SERCA1) expression was markedly lower in muscle of ICU rats than in SHAM rats. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that distribution of Na(+) channel and DHPR protein on the sarcolemma was disrupted in fibers from ICU rats compared with SHAM rats.
These results suggest that impaired SR Ca(2+) release contributes to the muscle weakness seen in patients in ICU.
Raising the intracellular [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i) was previously found to produce uncoupling between the electrical depolarization of the transverse tubules and contraction in skinned muscle fibers. Here we study the effect of elevated [Ca2+]i in voltage clamped cut fibers of frog skeletal muscle to establish how the charge movement, a measure of the activation of the dihydropyridine receptors (DHPR)-voltage sensors, and Ca2+ release, a consequence of the opening of the ryanodine receptor (RyR)-release channels, were affected. [Ca2+]i was raised by various procedures (pharmacological release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, application of high [Ca2+]i intracellular solution, permeabilization of the plasma membrane by a Ca2+ ionophore) all of which produced impairment of excitation-contraction coupling. The charge movement was reduced from 20.2 ± 1.24 to 9.9 ± 0.94 nC/μF meanwhile the Ca2+ release flux was reduced from 13.5 + 0.7 to 2.2 ± 0.3 μM/ms (n = 33). This suggests that a significant fraction of the DHPRs that remained functional, could not activate RyRs, and were therefore presumably disconnected. These results are broadly consistent with the original reports in skinned fibers. Uncoupling was prevented by the addition to the intracellular solution of the protease inhibitor leupeptin. In approximately 40 % of the uncoupled cells we observed that the [Ca2+]i transient continued to rise after the voltage clamp pulse was turned off. This loss of control by membrane voltage suggests that the uncoupled release channels might have another mechanism of activation, likely by Ca2+.
Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a pharmacogenetic disorder that has been linked to the skeletal muscle calcium release channel (RYR1) and the α1S subunit of the voltage-dependent L-type calcium channel (CACNA1S). Genomic DNA capture and next generation sequencing are becoming the preferred method to identify mutations in these genes. Bioinformatic pathogenicity prediction of identified variants may help to determine if these variants are in fact disease causing.
Eight pathogenicity prediction programmes freely available on the web were used to determine their ability to correctly predict the impact of a missense variant on RyR1 or dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) protein function. We tested MH-causative variants, variants that had been shown to alter calcium release in cells, and common sequence variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S.
None of the prediction programmes was able to identify all of the variants tested correctly as either 'damaging' (MH-causative variants, variants that had been shown to alter calcium release in cells) or as 'benign' (common sequence variants). The overall sensitivity of predictions ranged from 84% to 100% depending on the programme used, with specificity from 25% to 83%.
In this study we determined the sensitivity and specificity of bioinformatic pathogenicity prediction tools for RYR1 and CACNA1S. We suggest that the prediction results should be treated with caution, as none of the programmes tested predicted all the variants correctly and should only be used in combination with other available data (functional assays, segregation analysis).
The skeletal muscle dihydropyridine receptor α1S subunit plays a key role in skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling by sensing membrane voltage changes and then triggering intracellular calcium release. The cytoplasmic loops connecting four homologous α1S structural domains have diverse functions, but their structural arrangement is poorly understood. Here, we used a novel FRET-based method to characterize the relative proximity of these intracellular loops in α1S subunits expressed in intact cells. In dysgenic myotubes, energy transfer was observed from an N-terminal-fused YFP to a FRET acceptor, ReAsH (resorufin arsenical hairpin binder), targeted to each α1S intracellular loop, with the highest FRET efficiencies measured to the α1S II-III loop and C-terminal tail. However, in HEK-293T cells, FRET efficiencies from the α1S N terminus to the II-III and III-IV loops and the C-terminal tail were significantly lower, thus suggesting that these loop structures are influenced by the cellular microenvironment. The addition of the β1a dihydropyridine receptor subunit enhanced FRET to the II-III loop, thus indicating that β1a binding directly affects II-III loop conformation. This specific structural change required the C-terminal 36 amino acids of β1a, which are essential to support EC coupling. Direct FRET measurements between α1S and β1a confirmed that both wild type and truncated β1a bind similarly to α1S These results provide new insights into the role of muscle-specific proteins on the structural arrangement of α1S intracellular loops and point to a new conformational effect of the β1a subunit in supporting skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling.
Electrical activity regulates the expression of skeletal muscle genes by a process known as "excitation-transcription" (E-T) coupling. We have demonstrated that release of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) during depolarization activates membrane P2X/P2Y receptors, being the fundamental mediators between electrical stimulation, slow intracellular calcium transients, and gene expression. We propose that this signaling pathway would require the proper coordination between the voltage sensor (dihydropyridine receptor, DHPR), pannexin 1 channels (Panx1, ATP release conduit), nucleotide receptors, and other signaling molecules. The goal of this study was to assess protein-protein interactions within the E-T machinery and to look for novel constituents in order to characterize the signaling complex.
Newborn derived myotubes, adult fibers, or triad fractions from rat or mouse skeletal muscles were used. Co-immunoprecipitation, 2D blue native SDS/PAGE, confocal microscopy z-axis reconstruction, and proximity ligation assays were combined to assess the physical proximity of the putative complex interactors. An L6 cell line overexpressing Panx1 (L6-Panx1) was developed to study the influence of some of the complex interactors in modulation of gene expression.
Panx1, DHPR, P2Y2 receptor (P2Y2R), and dystrophin co-immunoprecipitated in the different preparations assessed. 2D blue native SDS/PAGE showed that DHPR, Panx1, P2Y2R and caveolin-3 (Cav3) belong to the same multiprotein complex. We observed co-localization and protein-protein proximity between DHPR, Panx1, P2Y2R, and Cav3 in adult fibers and in the L6-Panx1 cell line. We found a very restricted location of Panx1 and Cav3 in a putative T-tubule zone near the sarcolemma, while DHPR was highly expressed all along the transverse (T)-tubule. By Panx1 overexpression, extracellular ATP levels were increased both at rest and after electrical stimulation. Basal mRNA levels of the early gene cfos and the oxidative metabolism markers citrate synthase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1α) were significantly increased by Panx1 overexpression. Interleukin 6 expression evoked by 20-Hz electrical stimulation (270 pulses, 0.3 ms each) was also significantly upregulated in L6-Panx1 cells.
We propose the existence of a relevant multiprotein complex that coordinates events involved in E-T coupling. Unveiling the molecular actors involved in the regulation of gene expression will contribute to the understanding and treatment of skeletal muscle disorders due to wrong-expressed proteins, as well as to improve skeletal muscle performance.
Mutations in CAPN3 cause limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A (LGMD2A), a progressive muscle wasting disease. CAPN3 is a non-lysosomal, Ca-dependent, muscle-specific proteinase. Ablation of CAPN3 (calpain-3 knockout (C3KO) mice) leads to reduced ryanodine receptor (RyR1) expression and abnormal Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (Ca-CaMKII)-mediated signaling. We previously reported that Ca(2+) release measured by fura2-FF imaging in response to single action potential stimulation was reduced in old C3KO mice; however, the use of field stimulation prevented investigation of the mechanisms underlying this impairment. Furthermore, our prior studies were conducted on older animals, whose muscles showed advanced muscular dystrophy, which prevented us from establishing whether impaired Ca(2+) handling is an early feature of disease. In the current study, we sought to overcome these matters by studying single fibers isolated from young wild-type (WT) and C3KO mice using a low affinity calcium dye and high intracellular ethylene glycol-bis(2-aminoethylether)-n,n,n',n'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) to measure Ca(2+) fluxes. Muscles were subjected to both current and voltage clamp conditions.
Standard and confocal fluorescence microscopy was used to study Ca(2+) release in single fibers enzymatically isolated from hind limb muscles of wild-type and C3KO mice. Two microelectrode amplifier and experiments were performed under current or voltage clamp conditions. Calcium concentration changes were detected with an impermeant low affinity dye in the presence of high EGTA intracellular concentrations, and fluxes were calculated with a single compartment model. Standard Western blotting analysis was used to measure the concentration of RyR1 and the α subunit of the dihydropyridine (αDHPR) receptors. Data are presented as mean ± SEM and compared with the Student's test with significance set at p &lt; 0.05.
We found that the peak value of Ca(2+) fluxes elicited by single action potentials was significantly reduced by 15-20 % in C3KO fibers, but the kinetics was unaltered. Ca(2+) release elicited by tetanic stimulation was also impaired in C3KO fibers. Confocal studies confirmed that Ca(2+) release was similarly reduced in all triads of C3KO mice. Voltage clamp experiments revealed a normal voltage dependence of Ca(2+) release in C3KO mice but reduced peak Ca(2+) fluxes as with action potential stimulation. These findings concur with biochemical observations of reduced RyR1 and αDHPR levels in C3KO muscles and reduced mechanical output. Confocal studies revealed a similar decrease in Ca(2+) release at all triads consistent with a homogenous reduction of functional voltage activated Ca(2+) release sites.
Overall, these results suggest that decreased Ca(2+) release is an early defect in calpainopathy and may contribute to the observed reduction of CaMKII activation in C3KO mice.
Excitation contraction coupling, the rapid and massive Ca(2+) release under control of an action potential that triggers muscle contraction, takes places at specialized regions of the cell called triad junctions. There, a highly ordered supramolecular complex between the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) and the ryanodine receptor (RyR1) mediates the quasi-instantaneous conversion from T-tubule depolarization into Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The DHPR has several key modules required for EC coupling: the voltage sensors and II-III loop in the alpha1s subunit, and the beta subunit. To gain insight into their molecular organization, this review examines the most updated 3D structure of the DHPR as obtained by transmission electron microscopy and image reconstruction. Although structure determination of a heteromeric membrane protein such as the DHPR is challenging, novel technical advances in protein expression and 3D labeling facilitated this task. The 3D structure of the DHPR complex consists of a main body with five irregular corners around its perimeter encompassing the transmembrane alpha 1s subunit besides the intracellular beta subunit, an extended extracellular alpha 2 subunit, and a bulky intracellular II-III loop. The structural definition attained at 19 Å resolution enabled docking of the atomic coordinates of structural homologs of the alpha1s and beta subunits. These structural features, together with their relative location with respect to the RyR1, are discussed in the context of the functional data. 
In skeletal muscle, excitation-contraction (EC) coupling relies on the transmission of an intermolecular signal from the voltage-sensing regions of the L-type Ca(2+) channel (Ca(V)1.1) in the plasma membrane to the channel pore of the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) nearly 10 nm away in the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Even though the roles of Ca(V)1.1 and RyR1 as voltage sensor and SR Ca(2+) release channel, respectively, have been established for nearly 25 years, the mechanism underlying communication between these two channels remains undefined. In the course of this article, I will review current viewpoints on this topic with particular emphasis on recent studies.
Schwann cells are integral components of vertebrate neuromuscular synapses; in their absence, pre-synaptic nerve terminals withdraw from post-synaptic muscles, leading to muscle denervation and synapse loss at the developing neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Here, we report a rescue of muscle denervation and neuromuscular synapses loss in type III Neuregulin 1 mutant mice (CRD-Nrg1-/-), which lack Schwann cells. We found that muscle denervation and neuromuscular synapse loss were prevented in CRD-Nrg1-/-mice when presynaptic activity was blocked by ablating a specific gene, such as Snap25 (synaptosomal-associated 25 kDa protein) or Chat (choline acetyltransferase). Further, these effects were mediated by a pathway that requires postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), because ablating Chrna1 (acetylcholine receptor α1 subunit), which encodes muscle-specific AChRs in CRD-Nrg1-/-mice also rescued muscle denervation. Moreover, genetically ablating muscle dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) β1 subunit (Cacnb1) or ryanodine receptor 1 (Ryr1) also rescued muscle denervation and neuromuscular synapse loss in CRD-Nrg1-/-mice. Thus, these genetic manipulations follow a pathway-from presynaptic to postsynaptic, and, ultimately to muscle activity mediated by DHPRs and Ryr1. Importantly, electrophysiological analyses reveal robust synaptic activity in the rescued, Schwann-cell deficient NMJs in CRD-Nrg1-/-Cacnb1-/-or CRD-Nrg1-/-Ryr1-/-mutant mice. Thus, a blockade of synaptic activity, although sufficient, is not necessary to preserve NMJs that lack Schwann cells. Instead, a blockade of muscle activity mediated by DHRPs and Ryr1 is both necessary and sufficient for preserving NMJs that lack Schwann cells. These findings suggest that muscle activity mediated by DHPRs/Ryr1 may destabilize developing NMJs and that Schwann cells play crucial roles in counteracting such a destabilizing activity to preserve neuromuscular synapses during development.
This study investigated the in-season effect of intensified training comparing the efficacy of duration-matched intense intermittent exercise training with sprint interval training in increasing intermittent running performance, sprint ability, and muscle content of proteins related to ion handling and metabolism in football players. After the first two weeks in the season, 22 sub-elite football players completed either 10 weeks of intense intermittent training using the 10-20-30 training concept (10-20-30, n = 12) or sprint interval training (SIT, n = 10; work/rest ratio: 6-s/54-s) three times weekly, with a ~20% reduction in weekly training time. Before and after the intervention, players performed a Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test level 1 (Yo-Yo IR1) and a 30-m sprint test. Furthermore, players had a muscle biopsy taken from the vastus lateralis. Yo-Yo IR1 performance increased by 330 m (95%CI: 178-482, P ≤ 0.01) in 10-20-30, whereas no change was observed in SIT. Sprint time did not change in 10-20-30 but decreased by 0.04 second (95%CI: 0.00-0.09, P ≤ 0.05) in SIT. Muscle content of HADHA (24%, P ≤ 0.01), PDH-E1α (40%, P ≤ 0.01), complex I-V of the electron transport chain (ETC) (51%, P ≤ 0.01) and Na+ , K+ -ATPase subunits α2 (33%, P ≤ 0.05) and β1 (27%, P ≤ 0.05) increased in 10-20-30, whereas content of DHPR (27%, P ≤ 0.01) and complex I-V of the ETC (31%, P ≤ 0.05) increased in SIT. Intense intermittent training, combining short sprints and a high aerobic load, is superior to regular sprint interval training in increasing intense intermittent running performance during a Yo-Yo IR1 test and muscle content of PDH-E1α and HADHA in sub-elite football players.
Qiliqiangxin (QL) can attenuate myocardial remodeling and improve cardiac function in some cardiac diseases, including heart failure and hypertension. This study was to explore the effects and mechanism of QL on atrial structural remodeling in atrial fibrillation (AF). Twenty-one rabbits were randomly divided into a sham-operation group, pacing group (pacing with 600 beats per minute for 4 weeks), and treatment group (2.5 g/kg/day). Before pacing, the rabbits received QL-administered p.o. for 1 week. We measured atrial electrophysiological parameters in all groups to evaluate AF inducibility and the atrial effective refractory period (AERP). Echocardiography evaluated cardiac function and structure. TUNEL detection, hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, and Masson's trichrome staining were performed. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting (WB) were used to detect alterations in calcium channel L-type dihydropyridine receptor α2 subunit (DHPR) and fibrosis-related regulatory factors. AF inducibility was markedly decreased after QL treatment. Furthermore, we found that AERP and DHPR were reduced significantly in pacing rabbits compared with sham rabbits; treatment with QL increased DHPR and AERP compared to the pacing group. The QL group showed significantly decreased mast cell density and improved atrial ejection fraction values compared with the pacing group. Moreover, QL decreased interventricular septum thickness (IVSd) and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD). Compared with the sham group, the levels of TGFβ1 and P-smad2/3 were significantly upregulated in the pacing group. QL reduced TGF-β1 and P-smad2/3 levels and downstream fibrosis-related factors. Our study demonstrated that QL treatment attenuates atrial structural remodeling potentially by inhibiting TGF-β1/P-smad2/3 signaling pathway.
High 17β-Estradiol (E2) concentrations in isolated ventricular myocytes as well as a lack of ovarian hormones in cardiac muscle of ovariectomized (OVX) rodents has been shown to lead to arrhythmogenic effects by inducing post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release channel ryanodine receptor-2 (RyR2). The effects of estrogens on the phosphorylation status of the RyR1 in skeletal muscle have not been investigated before. Furthermore, while high intensity exercise has been shown to increase RyR phosphorylation, there is no data on the effects of moderate intensity continuous training (MICT). The aims of the study were to investigate the effects of a 3-day treatment with low (1 nM, moderate (5 nM) and high (10 nM, 100 nM) E2 concentrations on RyR1 mRNA and protein expression and phosphorylation status (pRyRSer2844) in cultured C2C12 myotubes and to study the effects of OVX on RyR1 expression and phosphorylation in rat skeletal muscle in combination with 3 weeks of MICT. Treatment with low, physiological E2 concentrations reduced dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) and RyR1 mRNA content in C2C12 myotubes compared to untreated control cells, whereas RyR1 protein phosphorylation (pRyRSer2844) was significantly increased after treatment with high, non-physiological E2 concentrations (p ≤ 0.05). RyR1 protein content (p ≤ 0.05) and pRyRSer2844 (p ≤ 0.05) were significantly elevated in skeletal muscle of OVX vs. sham-operated rats. Importantly, pRyRSer2844 levels were similar to sham-operated controls in OVX rats after MICT (OVX vs. OVX + MICT, p ≤ 0.05). Our results indicate, that one of the actions of estrogens is to alter skeletal muscle Ca2+ homeostasis by modulating the expression and phosphorylation of the RyR1 in skeletal muscle. Notably, regular MICT was able to counteract RyR1 phosphorylation in skeletal muscle of OVX rats.
Aconitine is the main bioactive ingredient of Aconitum plants, which are well-known botanical herbs in China. Aconitine is also notorious for its high cardiotoxicity, as it can induce life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Unfortunately, there are few effective antidotes to aconitine toxicity. This study aimed to evaluate the potent protective effects of the ingredients from V. baillonii on aconitine toxicity on H9c2 cell line. Cell viability was assessed by methylthiazoltetrazolium bromide (MTT). Intracellular Ca2+ concentration alteration and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were observed by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry, respectively. Cellular oxidative stress was analyzed by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ) was determined using JC-1 kit. RT-PCR and Hoechst staining techniques were conducted to determine the levels of autophagy/apoptosis. The mRNA levels of dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR), ryanodine receptors (RyR2) and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) were measured by RT-PCR. We screened six components from V. baillonii, among which, sweroside exhibited the strongest protective effects on aconitine-induced cardiac toxicity. Sweroside suppressed the aconitine-induced mRNA expressions of NaV1.5 (encoded by SCN5A), RyR2 and DHPR, and reversed the aconitine-induced decrease in mRNA level of SERCA, thus preventing the aconitine-induced persistent intracellular Ca2+ accumulation and avoiding intracellular Ca2+ overload. We further found that sweroside restabilized the aconitine-disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ) and reversed the aconitine-induced increase in the mRNA levels of cell autophagy-related factors (Beclin-1, Caspase-3, and LC3- II) in H9c2 cells. In the whole-animal experiments, we observed that sweroside (50 mg/kg) alleviated effectively aconitine-induced arrhythmias by analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) recording in rats. Our results demonstrate that sweroside may protect cardiomyocytes from aconitine toxicity by maintaining intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, restabilizing mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ) and avoiding cell autophagy/apoptosis.
Excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in skeletal muscles operates through a physical interaction between the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR), acting as a voltage sensor, and the ryanodine receptor (RyR1), acting as a calcium release channel. Recently, the adaptor protein SH3 and cysteine-rich containing protein 3 (STAC3) has been identified as a myopathy disease gene and as an additional essential EC coupling component. STAC3 interacts with DHPR sequences including the critical EC coupling domain and has been proposed to function in linking the DHPR and RyR1. However, we and others demonstrated that incorporation of recombinant STAC3 into skeletal muscle triads critically depends only on the DHPR but not the RyR1. On the contrary, here, we provide evidence that endogenous STAC3 incorporates into triads in the absence of the DHPR in myotubes and muscle fibers of dysgenic mice. This finding demonstrates that STAC3 interacts with additional triad proteins and is consistent with its proposed role in directly or indirectly linking the DHPR with the RyR1.
The process by which muscle fiber electrical depolarization is linked to activation of muscle contraction is known as excitation-contraction coupling (ECC). Our understanding of ECC has increased enormously since the early scientific descriptions of the phenomenon of electrical activation of muscle contraction by Galvani that date back to the end of the eighteenth century. Major advances in electrical and optical measurements, including muscle fiber voltage clamp to reveal membrane electrical properties, in conjunction with the development of electron microscopy to unveil structural details provided an elegant view of ECC in skeletal muscle during the last century. This surge of knowledge on structural and biophysical aspects of the skeletal muscle was followed by breakthroughs in biochemistry and molecular biology, which allowed for the isolation, purification, and DNA sequencing of the muscle fiber membrane calcium channel/transverse tubule (TT) membrane voltage sensor (Cav1.1) for ECC and of the muscle ryanodine receptor/sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release channel (RyR1), two essential players of ECC in skeletal muscle. In regard to the process of voltage sensing for controlling calcium release, numerous studies support the concept that the TT Cav1.1 channel is the voltage sensor for ECC, as well as also being a Ca2+ channel in the TT membrane. In this review, we present early and recent findings that support and define the role of Cav1.1 as a voltage sensor for ECC.
The misbehaving attitude of Ca2+ signaling pathways could be the probable reason in many muscular disorders such as myopathies, systemic disorders like hypoxia, sepsis, cachexia, sarcopenia, heart failure, and dystrophy. The present review throws light upon the calcium flux regulating signaling channels like ryanodine receptor complex (RyR1), SERCA (Sarco-endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase), DHPR (Dihydropyridine Receptor) or Cav1.1 and Na+/Ca2+ exchange pump in detail and how remodelling of these channels contribute towards disturbed calcium homeostasis. Understanding these pathways will further provide an insight for establishing new therapeutic approaches for the prevention and treatment of muscle atrophy under stress conditions, targeting calcium ion channels and associated regulatory proteins.
Patients suffering from type 1 hypokalaemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP1) experience attacks of muscle paralysis associated with hypokalaemia. The disease arises from missense mutations in the gene encoding the α1 subunit of the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR), a protein complex anchored in the tubular membrane of skeletal muscle fibres which controls the release of Ca2+ from sarcoplasmic reticulum and also functions as a Ca2+ channel. The vast majority of mutations consist of the replacement of one of the outer arginines in S4 segments of the α1 subunit by neutral residues. Early studies have shown that muscle fibres from HypoPP1 patients are abnormally depolarized at rest in low K+ to the point of inducing muscle inexcitability. The relationship between HypoPP1 mutations and depolarization has long remained unknown. More recent investigations conducted in the closely structurally related voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels have shown that comparable S4 arginine substitutions gave rise to elevated inward currents at negative potentials called gating pore currents. Experiments performed in muscle fibres from different models revealed such an inward resting current through HypoPP1 mutated Ca2+ channels. In mouse fibres transfected with HypoPP1 mutated channels, the elevated resting current was found to carry H+ for the R1239H arginine-to-histidine mutation in a S4 segment and Na+ for the V876E HypoPP1 mutation, which has the peculiarity of not being located in S4 segments. Muscle paralysis probably results from the presence of a gating pore current associated with hypokalaemia for both mutations, possibly aggravated by external acidosis for the R1239H mutation.
It has been shown that calpains are involved in the proteolysis of muscle proteins that occurs with eccentric contraction (ECC) and that exogenously applied nitric oxide decreases the calpain-mediated proteolysis. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of ingestion of l-arginine (ARG), a nitric oxide precursor, on ECC-related calpain activation. In the first and second experiments, male Wistar rats were given ARG in water for 7 days starting from 3 days before the ECC protocol (average ingestion, ~600 mg kg-body wt-1  day-1 ). Tibialis anterior muscles underwent 200 repeated ECCs and, subsequently, were excised 3 days later. Whole muscle analyses (the first experiment) revealed that ARG attenuated ECC-induced force deficit and autolysis of calpain-1, and increased the amounts of S-nitrosylated calpain-1. Regarding ryanodine receptor (RyR) and dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR), ECC-induced proteolysis was completely inhibited by ARG, whereas the inhibition was partial for junctophilin-1 (JP1). Skinned fiber analyses (the second experiment) showed that ARG also inhibited ECC-elicited reductions in the ratio of depolarization-induced to maximum Ca2+ -activated force. In the third experiment, homogenates of rested muscles were treated with S-nitrosylating agent, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), and/or high Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+ ]). Treatment with high [Ca2+ ] and without GSNO produced proteolysis of RyR, DHPR, and JP1. On the other hand, treatment with high [Ca2+ ] and GSNO caused complete inhibition of RyR and DHPR proteolysis and partial inhibition of JP1 proteolysis. These results indicate that ARG ingestion can attenuate ECC-induced proteolysis of Ca2+ regulatory proteins and force deficit by decreasing calpain activation via S-nitrosylation.
The type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) in skeletal muscle is a homotetrameric protein that releases Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in response to an "orthograde" signal from the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) in the plasma membrane (PM). Additionally, a "retrograde" signal from RyR1 increases the amplitude of the Ca2+ current produced by CaV1.1, the principle subunit of the DHPR. This bidirectional signaling is thought to depend on physical links, of unknown identity, between the DHPR and RyR1. Here, we investigate whether the isolated cytoplasmic domain of RyR1 can interact structurally or functionally with CaV1.1 by producing an N-terminal construct (RyR11:4300) that lacks the C-terminal membrane domain. In CaV1.1-null (dysgenic) myotubes, RyR11:4300 is diffusely distributed, but in RyR1-null (dyspedic) myotubes it localizes in puncta at SR-PM junctions containing endogenous CaV1.1. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching indicates that diffuse RyR11:4300 is mobile, whereas resistance to being washed out with a large-bore micropipette indicates that the punctate RyR11:4300 stably associates with PM-SR junctions. Strikingly, expression of RyR11:4300 in dyspedic myotubes causes an increased amplitude, and slowed activation, of Ca2+ current through CaV1.1, which is almost identical to the effects of full-length RyR1. Fast protein liquid chromatography indicates that ∼25% of RyR11:4300 in diluted cytosolic lysate of transfected tsA201 cells is present in complexes larger in size than the monomer, and intermolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer implies that RyR11:4300 is significantly oligomerized within intact tsA201 cells and dyspedic myotubes. A large fraction of these oligomers may be homotetramers because freeze-fracture electron micrographs reveal that the frequency of particles arranged like DHPR tetrads is substantially increased by transfecting RyR-null myotubes with RyR11:4300 In summary, the RyR1 cytoplasmic domain, separated from its SR membrane anchor, retains a tendency toward oligomerization/tetramerization, binds to SR-PM junctions in myotubes only if CaV1.1 is also present and is fully functional in retrograde signaling to CaV1.1.
Malignant hyperthermia (MH) susceptibility has been recently linked to a novel variant of β1a subunit of the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR), a channel essential for Ca2+ regulation in skeletal muscle. Here we evaluate the effect of the mutant variant V156A on the structure/function of DHPR β1a subunit and assess its role on Ca2+ metabolism of cultured myotubes. Using differential scanning fluorimetry, we show that mutation V156A causes a significant reduction in thermal stability of the Src homology 3/guanylate kinase core domain of β1a subunit. Expression of the variant subunit in β1-null mouse myotubes resulted in increased sensitivity to caffeine stimulation. Whole cell patch-clamp analysis of β1a-V156A-expressing myotubes revealed a -2 mV shift in voltage dependence of channel activation, but no changes in Ca2+ conductance, current kinetics, or sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ load were observed. Measurement of resting free Ca2+ and Na+ concentrations shows that both cations were significantly elevated in β1a-V156A-expressing myotubes and that these changes were linked to increased rates of plasmalemmal Ca2+ entry through Na+/Ca2+ exchanger and/or transient receptor potential canonical channels. Overall, our data show that mutant variant V156A results in instability of protein subdomains of β1a subunit leading to a phenotype of Ca2+ dysregulation that partly resembles that of other MH-linked mutations of DHPR α1S subunit. These data prove that homozygous expression of variant β1a-V156A has the potential to be a pathological variant, although it may require other gene defects to cause a full MH phenotype.
L-type voltage-gated CaV1.2 calcium channels (CaV1.2) are key regulators of neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity, and excitation-transcription coupling. Surface-exposed CaV1.2 distributes in clusters along the dendrites of hippocampal neurons. A permanent exchange between stably clustered and laterally diffusive extra-clustered channels maintains steady-state levels of CaV1.2 at dendritic signaling domains. A dynamic equilibrium between anchored and diffusive receptors is a common feature among ion channels and is crucial to modulate signaling transduction. Despite the importance of this fine regulatory system, the molecular mechanisms underlying the surface dynamics of CaV1.2 are completely unexplored. Here, we examined the dynamic states of CaV1.2 depending on phosphorylation on Ser-1700 and Ser-1928 at the channel C terminus. Phosphorylation at these sites is strongly involved in CaV1.2-mediated nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) signaling, long-term potentiation, and responsiveness to adrenergic stimulation. We engineered CaV1.2 constructs mimicking phosphorylation at Ser-1700 and Ser-1928 and analyzed their behavior at the membrane by immunolabeling protocols, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, and single particle tracking. We found that the phosphomimetic S1928E variant increases the mobility of CaV1.2 without altering the steady-state maintenance of cluster in young neurons and favors channel stabilization later in differentiation. Instead, mimicking phosphorylation at Ser-1700 promoted the diffusive state of CaV1.2 irrespective of the differentiation stage. Together, these results reveal that phosphorylation could contribute to the establishment of channel anchoring mechanisms depending on the neuronal differentiation state. Finally, our findings suggest a novel mechanism by which phosphorylation at the C terminus regulates calcium signaling by tuning the content of CaV1.2 at signaling complexes.
In this study, composite gelatin-polyaniline (PANI) nanofibers doped with camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) were fabricated by electrospinning and used as substrates to culture C2C12 myoblast cells. We observed enhanced myotube formation on composite gelatin-PANI nanofibers compared to gelatin nanofibers, concomitantly with enhanced myotube maturation. Thus, in myotubes, intracellular organization, colocalization of the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) and ryanodine receptor (RyR), expression of genes correlated to the excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling apparatus, calcium transients, and myotube contractibility were increased. Such composite material scaffolds combining topographical and electrically conductive cues may be useful to direct skeletal muscle cell organization and to improve cellular maturation, functionality, and tissue formation.
Developing cardiac myocytes undergo substantial structural and functional changes transforming the mechanism of excitation-contraction coupling from the embryonic form, based on calcium influx through sarcolemmal DHPR calcium channels, to the adult form, relying on local calcium release through RYR calcium channels of sarcoplasmic reticulum stimulated by calcium influx. We characterized day-by-day the postnatal development of the structure of sarcolemma, using techniques of confocal fluorescence microscopy, and the development of the calcium current, measured by the whole-cell patch-clamp in isolated rat ventricular myocytes. We characterized the appearance and expansion of the t-tubule system and compared it with the appearance and progress of the calcium current inactivation induced by the release of calcium ions from sarcoplasmic reticulum as structural and functional measures of direct DHPR-RYR interaction. The release-dependent inactivation of calcium current preceded the development of the t-tubular system by several days, indicating formation of the first DHPR-RYR couplons at the surface sarcolemma and their later spreading close to contractile myofibrils with the growing t-tubules. Large variability of both of the measured parameters among individual myocytes indicates uneven maturation of myocytes within the growing myocardium.
Skeletal muscle excitation-contraction (EC) coupling is initiated by sarcolemmal depolarization, which is translated into a conformational change of the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR), which in turn activates sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release to trigger muscle contraction. During EC coupling, the mammalian DHPR embraces functional duality, as voltage sensor and L-type Ca2+ channel. Although its unique role as voltage sensor for conformational EC coupling is firmly established, the conventional function as Ca2+ channel is still enigmatic. Here we show that Ca2+ influx via DHPR is not necessary for muscle performance by generating a knock-in mouse where DHPR-mediated Ca2+ influx is eliminated. Homozygous knock-in mice display SR Ca2+ release, locomotor activity, motor coordination, muscle strength and susceptibility to fatigue comparable to wild-type controls, without any compensatory regulation of multiple key proteins of the EC coupling machinery and Ca2+ homeostasis. These findings support the hypothesis that the DHPR-mediated Ca2+ influx in mammalian skeletal muscle is an evolutionary remnant.In mammalian skeletal muscle, the DHPR functions as a voltage sensor to trigger muscle contraction and as a Ca2+ channel. Here the authors show that mice where Ca2+ influx through the DHPR is eliminated display no difference in skeletal muscle function, suggesting that the Ca2+ influx through this channel is vestigial.
Contraction of skeletal muscle is initiated by excitation-contraction (EC) coupling during which membrane voltage is transduced to intracellular Ca2+ release. EC coupling requires L-type voltage gated Ca2+ channels (the dihydropyridine receptor or DHPR) located at triads, which are junctions between the transverse (T) tubule and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes, that sense membrane depolarization in the T tubule membrane. Reduced EC coupling is associated with ageing, and disruptions of EC coupling result in congenital myopathies for which there are few therapies. The precise localization of DHPRs to triads is critical for EC coupling, yet trafficking of the DHPR to triads is not well understood. Using dynamic imaging of zebrafish muscle fibers, we find that DHPR is transported along the longitudinal SR in a microtubule-independent mechanism. Furthermore, transport of DHPR in the SR membrane is differentially affected in null mutants of Stac3 or DHPRβ, two essential components of EC coupling. These findings reveal previously unappreciated features of DHPR motility within the SR prior to assembly at triads.
Compatibility of Radix Aconiti Carmichaeli and Liquorice is known to treat heart diseases such as heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias. This work answers the question that whether the active components (Aconitine, Liquiritin and Glycyrrhetinic Acid) of Radix Aconiti Carmichaeli and Liquorice could result in regulating intracellular calcium homeostasis and calcium cycling, and thereby verifies the therapeutic material basis.
The myocardial cells were divided into twelve groups randomly as control group, Aconitine group, nine different dose groups that orthogonal combined with Aconitine, Liquiritin and Glycyrrhetinic Acid, and Verapamil group. The myocardial cellular survival rate and morphology were assessed. The expression of calcium regulation protein(RyR2, NCX1, DHPR-a1) in the myocardial cell by Western-blotting.
The results exhibited that Aconitine (120 uM) significantly damaged on myocardial cell, decreased the survival rate and expression of Na+/Ca2+ exchangers (NCX1) and dihydropteridine reducta-α1 (DHPR-a1), and increased the expression of ryanodine receptor type2 (RyR2) obviously. The compatibility groups (Aconitine, Liquiritin and Glycyrrhetinic Acid) all could against the damage on the myocardial cell by Aconitine at different levels.
Aconitine with Liquiritin and Glycyrrhetinic Acid may regulate the expression of calcium-regulated proteins to protect myocardial cells from damage.
