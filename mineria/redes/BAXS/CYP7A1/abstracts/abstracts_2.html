A fluctuating temperature profile around a mean of 26°C can alter Aedes aegypti vector competence for dengue viruses as well as numerous life-history traits, however, the effect of fluctuations on mosquitoes at critical thermal limits is unknown.
We investigated the effects of large and small daily temperature fluctuations at low (16°C) and high (35-37°C) mean temperatures, after we identified these temperatures as being thresholds for immature development and/or adult reproduction under constant temperature conditions. We found that temperature effects on larval development time, larval survival and adult reproduction depend on the combination of mean temperature and magnitude of fluctuations. Importantly, observed degree-day estimates for mosquito development under fluctuating temperature profiles depart significantly (around 10-20%) from that predicted by constant temperatures of the same mean. At low mean temperatures, fluctuations reduce the thermal energy required to reach pupation relative to constant temperature, whereas at high mean temperatures additional thermal energy is required to complete development. A stage-structured model based on these empirical data predicts that fluctuations can significantly affect the intrinsic growth rate of mosquito populations.
Our results indicate that by using constant temperatures, one could under- or over-estimate values for numerous life-history traits compared to more natural field conditions dependent upon the mean temperature. This complexity may in turn reduce the accuracy of population dynamics modeling and downstream applications for mosquito surveillance and disease prevention.
Soil-exchangeable aluminum (Al) has toxic effects on living organisms in acidic soils. Earthworm presence and activity can alter soil pH, which has a significant influence on Al toxicity. However, the effects of earthworms on soil Al toxicity and fractions are still largely unknown. This laboratory study focused on the effects of three earthworm species (endogeics Pontoscolex corethrurus and Amynthas robustus, anecis Amynthas aspergillum) on soil acidification, Al fraction distribution, and base cation release. Three native earthworm species and a soil (latosolic red soil) collected from a botanical garden in South China were incubated under laboratory conditions. After 40 days of incubation, six Al fractions in soil, namely exchangeable (AlEx), weakly organically bound (AlOrw), organically bound (AlOr), amorphous (AlAmo), Al occluded in crystalline iron oxides (AlOxi), and amorphous aluminosilicate and gibbsite (AlAag) fractions, were extracted using a sequential procedure. Soil pH; organic carbon; total nitrogen; total Al (AlTotal); exchangeable K, Na, Ca, Mg contents; and CEC were determined as well. Compared to control soil, pH values increased by 0.79, 0.41, and 0.57 units in casts in the presence of P. corethrurus, A. robustus, and A. aspergillum, and 0.70, 0.32, and 0.50 units in non-ingested soil, respectively. Compared to control soil, the 61.7%, 30.7%, and 36.1% of AlEx contents in casts and 68.5%, 25.9%, and 39.0% of AlEx in non-ingested soil significantly decreased with the addition of P. corethrurus, A. robustus, and A. aspergillum, respectively. Moreover, compared to control soil, the 78.7%, 37.7%, and 40.1% of exchangeable Ca2+ and 12.3%, 24.7%, and 26.8% of exchangeable Mg2+ contents in casts significantly increased with the presence of P. corethrurus, A. robustus, and A. aspergillum, respectively. Soil treated with P. corethrurus had higher soil pH values, exchangeable Ca2+ contents, and lower AlEx than those with A. robustus and A. aspergillum. Results of principal component analyses showed that P. corethrurus, A. robustus, and A. aspergillum casts and non-ingested soil differ for soil pH, Al fractions, and exchangeable base cations release. These results indicate that earthworms, especially P. corethrurus, can reduce soil Al toxicity, increase soil pH, and affect the release of exchangeable base cations.
Cluster of differentiation (CD)1 molecules are a highly conserved family of MCH-like transmembrane glycoproteins that bind lipid and glycolipid antigens and present a diverse range of microbial and self-glycolipids to antigen-specific T cells. The current study aimed to find out the impact of CD1A and CD1D polymorphisms on pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). This case-control study encompassed 172 PTB patients and 180 healthy subjects. Genotyping of CD1A and CD1D variants was achieved using the polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism method. The results revealed that CD1A rs411089 variant significantly increased the risk of PTB in recessive model [odds ratio (OR)=2.71, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.38-5.57, CC vs. TT+TC, P=0.005]. CD1D rs859009 polymorphism significantly reduced the risk of PTB in heterozygous codominant (OR=0.50, 95% CI=0.29-0.86, P=0.011, GC vs. GG) and dominant (OR=0.53, 95% CI=0.31-0.88, P=0.019, GC+CC vs. GG) inheritance model. The CD1A rs366316, CD1D rs973742 and CD1D rs859010 were not associated with the risk/protection from PTB (P&gt;0.05). The results of the present study suggest that CD1A rs411089 and CD1D rs859009 but not CD1A rs366316, CD1D rs973742 and CD1D rs859010 polymorphisms are associated with PTB in a sample of the Iranian population. Further investigation with different ethnicities and larger sample sizes are necessary to certify the findings of the present study.
A ferroelectric-photovoltaic effect in nanowires of antimony sulfoiodide (SbSI) is presented for the first time. Sonochemically prepared SbSI nanowires have been characterized using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and optical diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS). The temperature dependences of electrical properties of the fabricated SbSI nanowires have been investigated too. The indirect forbidden energy gap EgIf = 1.862 (1) eV and Curie temperature TC = 291 (2) K of SbSI nanowires have been determined. Aligned SbSI nanowires have been deposited in an electric field between Pt electrodes on alumina substrate. The photoelectrical response of such a prepared ferroelectric-photovoltaic (FE-PV) device can be switched using a poling electric field and depends on light intensity. The photovoltage, generated under λ = 488 nm illumination of Popt = 127 mW/cm² optical power density, has reached UOC = 0.119 (2) V. The presented SbSI FE-PV device is promising for solar energy harvesting as well as for application in non-volatile memories based on the photovoltaic effect.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the radiographic periapical repair and the synthesis of inflammatory mediators after endodontic treatment in a single session, using different irrigation protocols, in teeth with apical periodontitis. Experimental apical periodontitis were induced in dog's teeth randomly assigned into 4 groups: G1 - Irrigation by Negative Apical Pressure (n= 20); G2 - Passive Ultrasonic Irrigation (n= 20), G3 - Positive Pressure Irrigation (n= 20); G4 - apical periodontitis without treatment (n= 20). After 180 days, the animals were euthanized, the tissues removed and submitted to histotechnical processing for immunohistochemical analysis of osteopontin (OPN), tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and interleukin 1-a (IL-1a). Radiographic analysis was performed using the Periapical Index (PAI), obtained prior to and 180 days following endodontic treatment. Data were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Fisher's Exact test or Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn's post-test (a = 5%). Radiographically, after endodontic treatment, apical periodontitis persisted in 35% of G1 specimens, 40% of G2 and 40% of G3 (p&gt;0.05), although a PAI reduction was observed (p&lt;0.05). By immunohistochemical evaluation, endodontic treatment resulted in lower synthesis of TNF-a and OPN in periapical region, compared to apical periodontitis without treatment (p&lt;0.05). Production of IL-1 was not modulated by endodontic treatment (p&gt;0.05). Periapical healing was observed in approximately 60% of the cases after endodontic treatment performed in a single session with lower synthesis of TNF-a and OPN in the periapical region, regardless of the irrigation protocol used.
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains a devastating consequence of prematurity. Repeated inflammatory insults worsen lung injury, but there are no predictors for BPD-related respiratory outcomes nor targeted therapies. We sought to understand inflammatory mechanisms in evolving BPD through molecular characterization of monocytes in tracheal aspirates from infants at risk for developing BPD. We performed flow cytometry targeting myeloid cell populations on prospectively collected tracheal aspirates from intubated patients born before 29 weeks' gestation and less than 30 days old. We identified CD14+CD16+(double positive, DP) and CD14+CD16-(single positive, SP) monocytes, and characterized their gene expression profiles by RNA sequencing and qPCR. We further analyzed differential gene expression between time points to evaluate changes in monocyte function over the first weeks of life. Monocytes collected at day of life (DOL) 7, DOL 14, and DOL 28 had increased expression of IL-1A, IL-1B, and IL-1RN mRNA versus samples from DOL 3. This study suggests that early changes in monocyte-specific IL-1 cytokine pathways may be associated with evolving BPD.
β-lactam antibiotics, which are used to treat infectious diseases, are currently the most widely used class of antibiotics. This study focused on the chemical reactivity of five- and six-membered ring systems attached to the β-lactam ring. The ring strain energy (RSE), force constant (FC) of amide (C-N), acylation transition states and second-order perturbation stabilization energies of 13 basic structural units of β-lactam derivatives were computed using the M06-2X and G3/B3LYP multistep method. In the ring strain calculations, an isodesmic reaction scheme was used to obtain the total energies. RSE is relatively greater in the five-(1a-2c) compared to the six-membered ring systems except for 4b, which gives a RSE that is comparable to five-membered ring lactams. These variations were also observed in the calculated inter-atomic amide bond distances (C-N), which is why the six-membered ring lactams C-N bond are more rigid than those with five-membered ring lactams. The calculated ΔG# values from the acylation reaction of the lactams (involving the S-H group of the cysteine active residue from L,D transpeptidase 2) revealed a faster rate of C-N cleavage in the five-membered ring lactams especially in the 1-2 derivatives (17.58 kcal mol-1 ). This observation is also reflected in the calculated amide bond force constant (1.26 mDyn/A) indicating a weaker bond strength, suggesting that electronic factors (electron delocalization) play more of a role on reactivity of the β-lactam ring, than ring strain.
Workplace social capital (WSC) may be beneficial for employees' health and well-being; however, most studies have analyzed WSC on the individual and not the workplace level. We test whether higher compared to lower levels of vertical WSC (WSC between employees and superiors) and horizontal WSC (WSC between employees), measured at the workplace level, is prospectively associated with higher levels of employees' well-being.
Using data from an intervention study, we analyzed associations between workplace aggregated vertical and horizontal WSC at baseline with job satisfaction, exhaustion and sleep disturbances at 24-months follow-up. The sample included 606 municipal pre-school employees (71 workplaces). We adjusted for individual and workplace characteristics, baseline scores of outcomes, intervention status, and the interaction of exposure with intervention status. We used the Genmod procedure in SAS with a repeated statement to account for correlation of individuals within workplaces. We repeated analyses using individual-level WSC measurements.
Higher levels of vertical and horizontal WSC at baseline predicted a higher level of job satisfaction (0.20, p = 0.01 and 0.24, p = 0.01, respectively) and a lower level of exhaustion (- 0.33, p = 0.04 and - 0.43, p = 0.04) at follow-up in the most adjusted model. Analyses with individual-level measures yielded similar results and further showed an association of a higher level of horizontal WSC with a lower level of sleep disturbances.
Higher levels of vertical and horizontal WSC were prospectively associated with better well-being of employees in municipal pre-schools. Workplaces may thus consider focusing on improving WSC as a means for ensuring or improving employees' well-being.
Six tetranuclear DyIII complexes [Dy4(L)2(CH3OH)3(NO3)3]·3NO3·2H2O (1a), [Dy4(L)2(CH3OH)2(SCN)4(OCH3)2]·2CH3OH·2H2O (1b), {[Dy4(L)2(CH3OH)(SCN)6(CH3CN)]·3CH3OH·4CH3CN}2 (2a), [Dy4(L)2(CH3OH)2(SCN)6]·6CH3OH·2H2O (2b), [Dy4(L)2(CH3OH)2(SCN)4(OCH3)2]·5CH3OH·2H2O (3a), and [Dy4(L)2(CH3OH)(SCN)5(H2O)2]·SCN·4CH3OH·2H2O (3b) were structurally and magnetically characterized. The Dy1/Dy2 centers in these complexes are eight-coordinate and submitted to pseudo- D4d symmetry environments. It is noteworthy that the modulation of coordination terminal around Dy1/Dy2 centers induces distinct magnetic relaxation processes, switching from single relaxation (1b) to two-step relaxation (2b). All complexes show significant zero-field single-molecule magnet (SMM) properties with the exception of 3b, which only features the slow magnetic relaxation behavior under a zero dc field. Ab initio calculations substantiate that the excellent SMM property of complex 1b should mainly profit from strong ferromagnetic interactions between the individual DyIII ions, while different single-ion magnetism results in better SMM property of complex 3a than that of 3b.
HCV virus infections are one of the major health problems in the world that can cause cirrhosis and liver cancer at a higher rate than other hepatitis data. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of mixed infections with different HCV genotypes in Turkey and also to evaluate the current HCV genotype and sub-type distributions by a multicentered assessment.
The HCV genotype data of 17,578 hepatitis C patients collected from 23 centers from different geographic regions covering all Turkey were collected. The data included information about the HCV genotypes in the last 10 years (between 2007 and 2016), demographic properties of the patients and the methods/systems used to determine the genotypes.
Two hundred twenty-eight of the patients (1.3%) had mixed genotype. The most common mixed genotype combination was 1b + 4 (0.83%) followed by 1a + 1b (0.26%). Genotype distribution varies according to geographical regions. However, genotype 1 (82.92%) was the most common genotype in all regions and all years. This was followed by genotype 3 (7.07%) and genotype 4 (5.43%). A variety of methods were used by the centers including sequencing, pyrosequencing, real-time PCR, in-house RFLP, reverse hybridization (LIPA), and hybridization.
Infection with mixed HCV genotypes in Turkey is uncommon. Genotype distribution varies according to geographic regions; the most common genotype 1 is encountered all over the country, while genotypes 3 and 4 are only in some of the centers. Since there is limited information about mixed HCV infection, further investigations are needed to determine the clinical importance of mixed HCV infection.
The is insufficient knowledge of arthropod communities occurring in specific microhabitats. In this study, we characterize the arthropod assemblages inhabiting burrows of the common hamster (Cricetus cricetus L.) and factors that determine their diversity and abundance. We tested the following hypotheses: (1) arthropod assemblages are associated with a particular dominant vegetation occurring in the vicinity of burrows; (2) a correlation exists between fine-scale geographic distances among burrows and assemblage dissimilarity; and (3) the type of trap influences the sampling success of captured arthropods. We found 73 morphospecies belonging to 16 families in 109 burrows, most of which were in the families Staphylinidae (Coleoptera) and Parasitidae (Arachnida: Acari: Mesostigmata). The most abundant families were Staphylinidae, Cryptophagidae (Coleoptera), Parasitidae, and Macrochelidae (Mesostigmata) (78.89%). Among the identified species, we found Aleochara irmgardis (Staphylinidae) and Poecilochirus sexclavatus (Parasitidae) which had not yet been reported in Poland, and several other rare species. Meat-baited traps captured 64.34% more individuals, which were more diverse and species-rich than the non-baited control traps, but the former was more selective for saprophages, necrophages, and coprophages. The burrows located in areas overgrown by triticale (a hybrid of wheat and rye) were inhabited by 69.86% of the identified arthropod species, and these also had the highest abundance (64.07%) in comparison with other habitats. However, differences in sample size biased our results toward and overestimate arthropods associated with this vegetation. This study underlines that the species composition detected in burrows was affected by the methods used and hamster preferences for a specific habitat rather than the geographic proximity of the burrows. More extensive sampling across multiple habitats will be necessary to confirm our findings.
Cancer is a multi-origin collection of diseases attributed by abnormal and uncontrolled cell growth spread from origin to other parts of body eventually leading to death. After decades of research, anti-cancer drug therapy is still very much limited to inhibiting growth and controlling spared of tumor cells. Finding novel molecular targets and drug candidates using assimilation of experimental and computational approaches is among the recent strategies adopted by researchers to speed up the anti-cancer drug discovery process. In present study, synthesis of 40 novel substituted 5-aryl-2-oxo-/thioxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[6,7]chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4,6,11(5H)-triones has been accomplished followed by molecular target identification using different in silico approaches. The target prioritization methodology involved identification and selection of targets, molecular docking followed by molecular dynamic simulation and determination of binding free energy using MM-GBSA technique. Systematic and stepwise virtual screening of biological targets lead to identification of B-cell lymphoma 6 protein (BCL6), lysine-specific histone demethylase 1A (LSD1), nuclear factor kappa- light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFkB P65) and Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) as suitable anti-cancer targets for the set of synthesized compounds.
Crossing vessels (CVs) are common in older children and adults with hydronephrosis but no gold standard exists on how to treat this condition. The final decision is made intraoperatively by the surgeon.
To assess the outcome of the laparoscopic dismembered pyeloplasty with translocation of the CVs in children and adults.
Prospectively collected data from 3 departments was reviewed. Inclusion criteria were: 1) a transperitoneal laparoscopic approach; 2) dismembered pyeloplasty; and 3) the same operating pediatric urologist (RC) or urologist (TS). In the case of CVs, pyeloplasty with vessel transposition (children) or with cephalad translocation (adults) was performed. Forty-eight children and 41 adults met these criteria. Patients were divided into 4 groups: children with (group 1A) and without (group 1B) CVs, and adults with (group 2A) and without (group 2B) CVs. Any surgical reintervention at the uretero-pelvic junction (UPJ) was deemed a failure.
The overall reintervention rate was 3/48 (6.25%) in children and 2/41 (4.9%) in adults (p &gt; 0.05), and involved the following: 4 endopyelotomies and 1 redo pyeloplasty. Crossing vessels were identified in 28/48 (58%) children and 12/41 (29%) adults. The mean operation time was 152 min in group 1A and 161 min in group 2A (p &gt; 0.5). Reintervention was needed in 2/28 patients in group 1A and in 1/12 patients in group 2A (p &gt; 0.05). There was no difference in the failure rate between group 1A and group 1B, nor between group 2A and group 2B (p &gt; 0.05).
Crossing vessels should be meticulously looked for during pyeloplasty in older children and adults. Dismembered laparoscopic pyeloplasty (LP) with dorsal transposition or cephalad translocation are comparable methods in terms of success rate for the treatment of UPJ obstruction in these patients.
WHAT IS IT?: Fetal neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FNAIT), also known as neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (NAIT) or fetomaternal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FMAIT), is a rare condition which affects a baby's platelets. This can put them at risk of problems with bleeding, particularly into the brain. One baby per week in the UK may be seriously affected and milder forms can affect one in every 1000 births. HOW IS IT CAUSED?: Platelets are blood cells that are very important in helping blood to clot. All platelets have natural proteins on their surface called human platelet antigens (HPAs). In babies, half of these antigens are inherited from the mother and half from the father. During pregnancy, some of the baby's platelets can cross into the mother's bloodstream. In most cases, this does not cause a problem. But in cases of FNAIT, the mother's immune system does not recognise the baby's HPAs that were inherited from the father and develops antibodies, which can cross the placenta and attack the baby's platelets. These antibodies are called anti-HPAs, and the commonest antibody implicated is anti-HPA-1a, but there are other rarer antibody types. If this happens, the baby's platelets may be destroyed causing their platelet count to fall dangerously low. If the platelet count is very low there is a risk to the baby of bleeding into their brain before they are born. This is very rare but if it happens it can have serious effects on the baby's health. HOW IS IT INHERITED?: A baby inherits half of their HPAs from its mother and half from its father. Consequently, a baby may have different HPAs from its mother. As the condition is very rare, and even if the baby is at risk of the condition we have no way of knowing how severely they will be affected, routine screening is not currently recommended. WHAT CAN BE DONE?: FNAIT is usually diagnosed if a previous baby has had a low platelet count. The parents are offered blood tests and the condition can be confirmed or ruled out. There are many other causes of low platelets in babies, which may also need to be tested for. As the condition is so rare, expertise is limited to specialist centres and normally a haematologist and fetal medicine doctor will perform and interpret the tests together. Fortunately, there is an effective treatment for the vast majority of cases called immunoglobulin, or IVIg. This 'blood product' is given intravenously through a drip every week to women at risk of the condition. It may be started from as early as 16 weeks in the next pregnancy, until birth, which would be offered at around 36-37 weeks. Less common treatments that may be considered depending on individual circumstances include steroid tablets or injections, or giving platelet transfusions to the baby. WHAT DOES THIS PAPER TELL YOU?: This paper considers the latest evidence in relation to treatment options in the management of pregnancies at risk of FNAIT. Specifically, we discuss the role of screening, when IVIg should be started, what dose should be used, and what evidence there is for maternal steroids. We also consider in very rare selected cases, the use of fetal blood sampling and giving platelet transfusions to the baby before birth. Finally, we consider the approaches to blood testing mothers to tell if babies are at risk, which is offered in some countries, and development of new treatments to reduce the risk of FNAIT.
(2R,3S)-N-tert-Butoxycarbonyl-3-amino-1-chloro-2-hydroxy-4-phenylbutane (1b) is key for the synthesis of the antiviral drug atazanavir. It can be obtained via the stereoselective bioreduction of (3S)-3-(N-Boc-amino)-1-chloro-4-phenyl-butanone (1a) with short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR). However, the stereoselective bioreduction of this hydrophobic and bulky substrate still remained a challenge because of the steric hindrance effect and low mass transfer rate. In this study, SDR isolated from Novosphingobium aromaticivorans (NaSDR) having low activity to 1a, which was engineered to enhance catalytic efficiency through active pocket iterative saturation mutagenesis (ISM). The obtained mutant (muSDR) (G141V/I195L) had 3.57 times higher kcat than the wild type (WT) towards 1a. Molecular docking analysis revealed considerable differences in the distance between the substrate and catalytic residues in WT and mutant SDR. Moreover, muSDR reduced 15 ketones with excellent enantioselectivity, indicating broad substrate acceptance. After optimization of expression and reaction conditions, the conversion was completed in a scale-up reaction (500 mL) using 50% toluene with 500 mM substrate without additional NADH. These results show that muSDR may be a valuable biocatalyst for future industrial applications.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune neurological disease that typically affects young adults, causing irreversible physical disability and cognitive impairment. Alemtuzumab, administered intravenously as 2 initial courses of 12 mg/day (5 consecutive days at baseline, and 3 consecutive days 12 months later), resulted in significantly greater improvements in clinical and MRI outcomes vs. subcutaneous interferon beta-1a over 2 years in patients with active relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) who were either treatment-naive (CARE-MS I; NCT00530348) or had an inadequate response to prior therapy (CARE-MS II; NCT00548405). Efficacy with alemtuzumab was maintained over 7 years in subsequent extension studies (NCT00930553; NCT02255656), in the absence of continuous treatment and with a consistent safety profile. There is an increased incidence of autoimmune events in patients treated with alemtuzumab (mainly thyroid events, but also immune thrombocytopenia and nephropathy), which imparts a need for mandatory safety monitoring for 4 years following the last treatment. The risk management strategy for alemtuzumab-treated patients includes laboratory monitoring and a comprehensive patient education and support program that enables early detection and effective management of autoimmune events, yielding optimal outcomes for MS patients. Here we provide an overview of tools and techniques that have been implemented in real-world clinical settings to reduce the burden of monitoring for both patients and healthcare providers, including customized educational materials, the use of social media, and interactive online databases for managing healthcare data. Many practices are also enhancing patient outreach efforts through coordination with specialized nursing services and ancillary caregivers. The best practice recommendations for safety monitoring described in this article, based on experiences in real-world clinical settings, may enable early detection and management of autoimmune events, and help with implementation of monitoring requirements while maximizing the benefits of alemtuzumab treatment for MS patients.
The photochemical degradation of the pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) has attracted increasing attention. In this study, a deep inspection of the photolysis mechanisms of naproxen and its photoproducts has been performed by employing experimental and theoretical methods. Contributions of different reactive oxygen species (ROS, such as OH, 1O2, and O2-) in the photolysis reaction also have been clarified. Based on the detected intermediates and DFT calculations, several photodegradation pathways of naproxen and its photoproducts have been proved. Furthermore, the deprotonated form of naproxen has been confirmed to be more reactive than the protonated one, and the lowest triplet state of naproxen is the reactive state. The decarboxylation mechanism of naproxen has been fully discussed. Meanwhile, the free energy barriers of OH-induced photolysis reactions (ΔG‡eff(1a) = 7.6 kcal mol-1, ΔG‡eff(4a) = 7.0 kcal mol-1) are much lower than the free energy barriers induced by O2- and 1O2. It proves that OH is the most favourable one among the three ROS. The similar inhabition rates and free energy barriers of reactions induced by O2- and 1O2, respectively, have demonstrated that O2- and 1O2 equally contribute to the degradation. Additionally, the computational results are coincident with the observed experimental findings. Hence, this work has verified a part of naproxen photodegradation mechanism under UV irradiation and brought about a rational way to investigate contributions of different ROS in the complex photochemical system of PPCPs.
In this paper, we investigate the temperature-dependent relaxation dynamics in the glassy and supercooled liquid state of dipolar and ionic eutectic mixtures made of two anesthetic agents (lidocaine and prilocaine) and their hydrochloride salts, respectively. In addition to eutectic phases containing 1:1 and 4:1 mol/mol of LD/PRL and LD-HCl/PRL-HCl, respectively, the relaxation properties of non-eutectic compositions and parent compounds are also studied. We found that electrostatic long-range forces determine strongly the dielectric and mechanical response of eutectic material. As a result of Coulomb interactions between ion pairs, an additional β-relaxation mode was found in the dielectric spectra of glassy LD-HCl/PRL-HCl mixtures. On the other hand, the studies of relaxation dynamics of ionic and non-ionic mixtures at T &gt; Tg revealed a continuous decrease of both fragility mP and the length scale of dynamic heterogeneity NαB(Tg), with simultaneous growth of Tg, when the electrostatics forces appear. At the same time, we found the charge transport being decoupled from structural dynamics in all studied ionic binary mixtures that is due to the fast proton hopping. However, the efficiency of proton transport is dropping down with an increase of Tg.
Culture-specific behaviour strategies provide an interesting window into individual differences research, producing a richer conceptualization of personality descriptions. Our aim is to describe the personality dimensions linked to a core socio-cultural behaviour pattern in Brazil: jeitinho. To reach this goal we conducted four studies. Our first set of studies (1a, 1b and 1c) examined the underlying structure of jeitinho as an individual difference variable and its nomological network with social values, the Big-Five, moral attitudes, and social dominance orientation. In Study 2, we confirm this structure and relate personal jeitinho to perceptions of jeitinho norms. Results demonstrated that personal jeitinho has two dimensions: Jeitinho Simpático is an individual's tendency to seek positive social interactions, avoid conflict, and find creative solutions; and Jeitinho Malandro captures behaviours such as the use of deception and trickery. These two behaviours are rooted in the same dimensions of the integrated model of values and personality.
Postoperative urinary retention (POUR) is defined as a disability in urinary excision after surgery. There are several strategies to prevent POUR, such as tamsulosin, which is a selective antagonist at alpha-1A and alpha-1B-adrenoceptors which reduces the bladder outlet resistance. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of prophylactic tamsulosin in preventing acute urinary retention and other obstructive urinary symptoms following colporrhaphy surgery.
This study was a randomized, double-blind clinical trial. A total of 130 patients who were candidates for colporrhaphy were divided into two groups: the intervention group (65 subjects received 0.4 mg tamsulosin in a single dose at the time of sleeping) and the control group (65 subjects received placebo at the same time as the intervention group). The incidence of acute urinary retention and other obstructive urethral symptoms and the mean urination volume after catheterization were recorded 24 h after operation. Patients' demographic and clinical data were analyzed using SPSS version 20 software using Chi-square and Fisher's tests.
There was a significant difference in the incidence of acute urinary retention, decrease in urine flow diameter, and the mean residual urine volume Post Void Residual (PVR) in the bladder, and the incidence of these symptoms decreased in the tamsulosin recipient group. The incidence of other symptoms of acute urinary retention was not significantly different when compared between both the groups.
It seems that the use of prophylactic tamsulosin is more effective in decreasing the incidence of acute urinary retention, decreasing the PVR in the bladder, and decreasing the diameter of the urine flow in patients after colporrhaphy.
Heterogeneity within Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) has hampered identification of biological markers (e.g., intermediate phenotypes, IPs) that might increase risk for the disorder or reflect closer links to the genes underlying the disease process. The newer characterizations of dimensions of MDD within Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domains may align well with the goal of defining IPs. We compare a sample of 25 individuals with MDD compared to 29 age and education matched controls in multimodal assessment. The multimodal RDoC assessment included the primary IP biomarker, positron emission tomography (PET) with a selective radiotracer for 5-HT1A [(11C)WAY-100635], as well as event-related functional MRI with a Go/No-go task targeting the Cognitive Control network, neuropsychological assessment of affective perception, negative memory bias and Cognitive Control domains. There was also an exploratory genetic analysis with the serotonin transporter (5-HTTLPR) and monamine oxidase A (MAO-A) genes. In regression analyses, lower 5-HT1A binding potential (BP) in the MDD group was related to diminished engagement of the Cognitive Control network, slowed resolution of interfering cognitive stimuli, one element of Cognitive Control. In contrast, higher/normative levels of 5-HT1A BP in MDD (only) was related to a substantial memory bias toward negative information, but intact resolution of interfering cognitive stimuli and greater engagement of Cognitive Control circuitry. The serotonin transporter risk allele was associated with lower 1a BP and the corresponding imaging and cognitive IPs in MDD. Lowered 5HT 1a BP was present in half of the MDD group relative to the control group. Lowered 5HT 1a BP may represent a subtype including decreased engagement of Cognitive Control network and impaired resolution of interfering cognitive stimuli. Future investigations might link lowered 1a BP to neurobiological pathways and markers, as well as probing subtype-specific treatment targets.
Background: Early adverse life stress is an important dangerous factor in the development of psychiatric disorders, particularly depression. Available clinical antidepressant agents, such as fluoxetine, [a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)], are unsatisfactory because of their side effects. SiNiSan (SNS) is a classic Chinese medicine prescription regarded to disperse stagnated liver qi to relieve qi stagnation. Therefore, this study was designed to detect the effects and molecular mechanism of SNS treatment in rats subjected to maternal separation (MS). Method: Male neonatal Wistar rats were divided into six groups including control + ddH2O, MS + ddH2O, MS + fluoxetine (5 g/kg), MS + SNS -low dose (2.5 g/kg), MS + SNS -medium dose (5 g/kg), MS + SNS -high dose (10 g/kg). The volume of drugs and ddH2O in each group are according to the weight of rats every day (10 mL/kg). Each group comprised 16 pups with 8 young and 8 adult pups. Except for the control group, all MS groups were separated from their mothers for 4 h/day from 9:00 to 13:00 during postnatal days (PNDs) 1 to 21. After MS, the six groups were intragastrically administered with ddH2O, fluoxetine, and different doses of SNS until PND 28 (for young pups) and PND 56 (for adult pups). The pups were weighed every day, and depression-like behavior was assessed by sucrose preference test, open field test, and forced swimming test. Serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptor, phosphorylated protein kinase A (p-PKA) substrate, cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), p-CREB and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus were examined by Western blot, and in situ 5-HT1A receptor expression was measured by IHC. Results: Young and adult MS rats exhibited depression-like behavior. However, the depression-like behavior was ameliorated by SNS in both age groups. The levels of 5-HT1A receptor, p-CREB, and BDNF in the hippocampus were reduced in young and adult MS rats. SNS treatment significantly up-regulated the expression of 5-HT1A receptor, p-CREB, and BDNF in the hippocampus of adult MS rats. However, few significant effects on the protein expression were observed in the young MS rats. Conclusion: MS in infancy could develop depression-like behavior in young and adult. SNS treatment may perform antidepressant effects on young and adult MS rats through the BDNF/PKA/CREB pathway.
In contrast to earlier research, the three studies reported here find that the most powerful individuals are also the most grateful, and that self-esteem plays a role in explaining this relationship. Study 1a (N = 109) reveals a strong, positive relationship between individuals' perceived power and gratitude. Study 1b (N = 194) replicates this and finds that self-esteem mediates this positive power-gratitude relationship. Study 2 (N = 212) manipulates power and shows its downstream effects on gratitude through self-esteem, again providing support for the positive relationship of power to gratitude through self-esteem. We argue that because gratitude is predicated on recognition that others value oneself, power amplifies rather than undercuts feelings of gratitude. We discuss possible boundary conditions.
Epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (C-erbB-2) is one of the most frequently mutated oncogenes in human tumors. We aimed to evaluate the knockout efficiency of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) technology using ultrasound microbubble transfection to target C-erbB-2 in human endometrial cancer (HEC)-1A cells.
Three single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting C-erbB-2 were designed and used to construct CRISPR/CRISPR-associated (Cas)9-C-erbB-2 plasmids. The constructed plasmids were transfected into HEC-1A cells using ultrasound microbubbles. C-erbB-2 knockout cloned cells were identified by green fluorescence. C-erbB-2 mRNA and protein expression was measured by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and western blotting, respectively.
RT-PCR showed that C-erbB-2 mRNA expression was significantly lower in sgRNA1-transfected cells (0.57 ± 0.06) than in blank (1.00 ± 0.09) and negative-control groups (1.02 ± 0.12). Western blotting revealed C-erbB-2 protein expression to be significantly lower in sgRNA1-transfected cells (0.269 ± 0.033) than in blank (0.495 ± 0.059) and negative-control groups (1.243 ± 0.281). However, there was no significant difference in C-erbB-2 protein and mRNA expression in sgRNA2- and sgRNA3-transfected cells compared with controls.
Ultrasound microbubbles can mediate plasmid transfer into HEC-1A cells to interfere with gene expression and knockout C-erbB-2.
Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a stroke subtype that is associated with high mortality and disability rate. Mitochondria plays a crucial role in neuronal survival after ICH. This study first showed that activation of adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) by AdipoRon could attenuate mitochondrial dysfunction after ICH. In vivo, experimental ICH model was established by autologous blood injection in mice. AdipoRon was injected intraperitoneally (50 mg/kg). Immunofluorescence staining were performed to explicit the location of AdipoR1, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1a (PGC1α). The PI staining was used to quantify neuronal survival. The expression of AdipoR1 and its downstream signaling molecules were detected by Western blotting. In vitro, 10 μM oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) was used to induce the neuronal injury in SH-SY5Y cells. Annexin V-FITC/PI staining was used to detect the neuronal apoptosis and necrosis. Mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) was measured by a JC-1 kit and mitochondrial mass was quantified by mitochondrial fluorescent probe. In vivo, PI staining showed that the administration of AdipoRon could reduce neuronal death at 72 h after ICH in mice. AdipoRon treatment enhanced ATP levels and reduced ROS levels in perihematoma tissues, and increased the protein expression of AdipoR1, P-AMPK, PGC1α, NRF1 and TFAM. In vitro, the JC-1 staining and Mito-tracker™ Green showed that AdipoRon significantly alleviated OxyHb-induced collapse of Δψm and enhanced mitochondrial mass. Moreover, flow cytometry analysis indicated that the neurons treated with AdipoRon showed low necrotic and apoptotic rate. AdipoRon alleviates mitochondrial dysfunction after intracerebral hemorrhage via the AdipoR1-AMPK-PGC1α pathway.
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are crucial regulators in the progression of various diseases. Although the role of lncRNAs in prostate cancer (PCa) has been studied in recent years, there are still numerous lncRNAs need to be elucidated. This study aims to detect the role of lncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 15 (SNHG15) in human prostate cancer. Using qRT-PCR analysis, we identified the upregulation of SNHG15 in PCa cell lines. Loss-of function assays were conducted to determine the regulatory effect of SNHG15 on PCa cell proliferation, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). According to the results of functional assays, we found that knockdown of SNHG15 impaired cell viability, suppressed cell proliferation, inhibited cell migration and invasion, reversed EMT progress. All these findings revealed the oncogenic function of SNHG15 in PCa. Mechanism investigation revealed that SNHG15 was located in the cytoplasm of PCa cells and acted as a molecular sponge of microRNA-338-3p (miR-338-3p). Moreover, FKBP prolyl isomerase 1A (FKBP1A) was a target of miR-338-3p. This investigation demonstrated that SNHG15 may serve as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to regulate miR-338-3p and FKBP1A. Finally, the involvement of miR-338-3p and FKBP1A in SNHG15-mediated biological function was demonstrated by performing rescue assays. In summary, our study revealed the function of a novel pathway in PCa.
Yersinia enterocolitica strains produce two chromosomal β‑lactamases, BlaA - a constitutively produced penicillinase, and BlaB - an inducible "AmpC-type" cephalosporinase. As in other members of Enterobacteriaceae, expression of ampC in Y. enterocolitica is regulated by the genes - ampR and ampD. The ampR encodes a transcriptional regulator which represses the expression of ampC and, ampD encodes a cytoplasmic N‑acetyl‑anhydromuramyl‑l‑alanine amidase which participates in recycling of peptidoglycan. Exposure of bacteria to antibiotics like imipenem and cefoxitin results in generation and accumulation of large quantities of muropeptides in cytoplasm which is beyond the recycling capability of AmpD. These muropeptides bind to AmpR, converting it into an activator of ampC expression (ampC de-repression). Earlier studies from our laboratory indicated that instead of BlaB, Y. enterocolitica biotype 1A strains produced a "BlaB-like" enzyme which was non-heterogeneous and showed a differential expression when induced with imipenem. The detection of "BlaB-like" cephalosporinase which was also induced differentially in Y. enterocolitica biotype 1A strains presented an opportunity to discern newer mechanisms, if any, which may underlie inducible expression of "AmpC-type" cephalosporinases. Thus, the objective of the present study was to understand the role of ampR and ampD in regulating differential expression of "BlaB-like" cephalosporinases in biotype 1A strains. Analysis of promoters and amino acid sequences of AmpR revealed that these were conserved in all strains of biotype 1A. Analysis of AmpD amino acid sequences revealed that five variants of AmpD were present which did not contribute to hyper-inducible production of "BlaB-like" enzyme. In-silico prediction of the mRNA secondary structures of ampD revealed significant differences, which might have affected the rate of translation of ampD and accumulation of un-recycled muropeptides inside the cell leading to hyper production of "BlaB-like" cephalosporinases in some Y. enterocolitica biotype 1A strains. The findings provide newer insights to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying regulation of expression of "AmpC-type" β‑lactamases.
Lemur tyrosine kinase 2 (LMTK2) belongs to both protein kinase and tyrosine kinase families. LMTK2 is less studied and little is known about its function. Here we demonstrate that LMTK2 modulates NF-κB activity and functions to promote colonic tumorigenesis. We found that LMTK2 protein was abundant in colon cancer cells and LMTK2 knockdown (LMTK2-KD) inhibited proliferation of colon cancer cells through inactivating NF-κB. In unstimulated condition, LMTK2 modulated NF-κB through inhibiting phosphorylation of p65 at Ser468. Mechanistically, LMTK2 phosphorylated protein phosphatase 1A (PP1A) to prevent PP1A from dephosphorylating p-GSK3β(Ser9). The p-GSK3β(Ser9) could not phosphorylate p65 at Ser468, which maintained the basal NF-κB activity. LMTK2 also modulated TNFα-activated NF-κB. LMTK2-KD repressed TNFα-induced IKKβ phosphorylation, IκBα degradation and NF-κB activation, implying that LMTK2 modulates TNFα-activated NF-κB via IKK. These results suggest that LMTK2 modulates basal and TNFα-induced NF-κB activities in different mechanisms. Animal studies show that LMTK2-KD suppressed colon cancer cell xenograft growth, decreased PP1A phosphorylation and increased p-p65(Ser468). Our results reveal the role and underlying mechanism of LMTK2 in colonic tumorigenesis and suggest that LMTK2 may serve as a potential target for chemotherapy of colon cancer.
Patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) treated with interferon-free direct-acting antivirals may still require ribavirin. However, ribavirin is associated with adverse events that can limit its use. This open-label, multicenter, Phase 3 study evaluated the safety and efficacy of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir+dasabuvir (OBV/PTV/r+DSV) with low-dose ribavirin for 12 weeks in genotype 1a-infected patients without cirrhosis. The primary efficacy endpoint was sustained virologic response at post-treatment Week 12 (SVR12). The primary safety endpoint was hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL during treatment and decreased from baseline. Overall, 105 patients enrolled. The SVR12 rate was 89.5% (n/N=94/105; 95% CI, 83.7-95.4). The study did not achieve non-inferiority versus the historic SVR12 rate for OBV/PTV/r+DSV plus weight-based ribavirin. Five patients experienced virologic failure, four discontinued, and two had missing SVR12 data. Excluding non-virologic failures, the SVR12 rate was 94.9% (n/N=94/99). One patient met the primary safety endpoint. OBV/PTV/r+DSV plus low-dose ribavirin offers an alternative option for patients in whom full-dose ribavirin may compromise tolerability, although non-inferiority to the weight-based ribavirin regimen was not met.

Evaluation of 20-year results after open flap debridement (OFD) and guided tissue regeneration (GTR) of infrabony defects in a randomized controlled trial.
In originally 16 periodontitis patients (baseline examination) periodontal surgery was performed in 44 infrabony defects. Polylactide acetyltributyl citrate barriers were randomly assigned to 23 out of these 44 defects (parallel). Ten of these patients (GTR) exhibited a second, contra-lateral defect (OFD) each (split-mouth). At baseline, 12, 120 and 240±12 months after surgery probing depths, attachment level, bleeding on probing as well was Plaque Index, Gingival Bleeding Index and Plaque Control Record were obtained.
Twelve patients contributing 38 defects were available at 240 months. At 12, 120 and 240±12 months both groups showed significant (p&lt;0.01) attachment gain (split-mouth: OFD: 12 months: 4.15±2.93 mm; 120 months: 3.35±2.37 mm, 240 months: 3.60±2.55 mm; GTR: 12 months: 3.50±2.47 mm; 120 months: 3.90±2.76 mm, 240 months: 3.80±2.69 mm; parallel: OFD: 12 months: 3.53±2.04 mm; 120 months: 3.59±2.54 mm, 240 months: 3.53±2.50 mm; GTR: 12 months: 4.07±2.88 mm; 120 months: 3.13±2.22 mm, 240 months: 3.13±2.22 mm). Seven teeth (3 OFD, 4 GTR) were lost. Only 1 patient out of 12 was kept in regular supportive periodontal therapy (SPT) over 20 years. The study failed to show significant attachment gain differences between both groups after 240 months.
Twenty years after OFD and GTR in infrabony defects in a population with lack of regular SPT attachment gains at 12 months after surgery were stable. 82% of the initially included teeth were still in place. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
Little data are available on anticoagulation (AC) management in patients with cardiac resynchronization (CRT) devices who undergo lead extraction procedure (TLE). We investigated the impact of AC on peri-procedural complications in CRT patients undergoing TLE, enrolled in the ESC-EHRA European Lead Extraction ConTrolled (ELECTRa) registry.
All CRT patients treated with TLE enrolled in the registry were considered. Peri-operative AC management was left to the discretion of the Center. Major and minor intra- and post-procedural complications were compared between patients without AC (Gp1) and patients with AC (Gp2). Regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of complications for Gp2. Out of 734 CRT pts, 328 (44.7%) were under AC (Gp2). Patients from Gp2 presented lower LVEF (Gp2 32.5±10.9 vs Gp1 34.5± 11.9%, p=0.03), more advanced HF disease (NYHA III/IV: Gp2 42.0 vs Gp1 31.5%, p=0.02), and renal impairment (Gp2 39.0 vs Gp1 24.3%, p&lt;0.001). Perioperative regimens included AC interruption (Gp2A: n=169, 51.5%), "bridging" (Gp2B: n=135, 41.2%), or continued AC (Gp2C: n=24, 7.3%). TLE complete success rates (98% in both groups) and major complication rates were comparable for both groups; minor bleeding events were more frequent in Gp2 (5.5%) compared to Gp1 (2.5%, p=0.051). No independent predictors were identified for Gp2, but minor complications were associated with "bridging" approach (Gp2B: 16 events vs Gp2A/C: 9 events, p=0.020).
CRT patients treated with TLE under AC were more compromised, but did not present more major complications compared to patients without AC. More minor complications were associated with "bridging" AC regimen. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
Anterior pharynx-defective 1A (APH-1A) is a seven transmembrane component of γ-secretase (GS), an aspartyl protease enzyme involved in the production of toxic amyloid-β peptides in Alzheimer's disease patients. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the enzyme complex revealed a central cavity in its APH-1A component, similar to water-containing cavities in G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). In this work, we performed molecular dynamics and umbrella sampling simulations to understand the role of the APH-1A cavity in the GS complex. Our results suggest that APH-1A is able to store water molecules in its inner cavity and transport some of them between cell spaces. Additionally, APH-1A allows the influx of extracellular cations into a central hydrophilic cavity but cannot transport them into the intracellular space. Overall, this study seeks to describe an alternative APH-1A function in GS besides its complex stabilization role and provide novel approaches to understand the functioning of the GS enzyme.
Treatment of primary idopathic achalasia, the most common of the rare oesophageal motility disorders, is currently changing. The therapeutic priciple of Heller's myotomy is increasingly accepted as standard. In 1913, the German surgeon Ernst Heller described the cardiomyotomy named after him, faciliating excellent symptom control. Meta-analyses of randomised trials (level 1A evidence) demonstrate superiority of laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM) over endoscopic pneumatic dilatation (PD). However, some surgeons still advocate the PD strategy, based on the results of the randomised European Multicenter study PD vs. LHM, suggesting that the two procedures achieve similar symptom control after 2 and 5 years. However, an initial series of PDs was excluded from "intention-to-treat" analysis, as the oesophageal perforation rate was unacceptably high (33.3%). To prevent postoperative gastroesophageal reflux (GER) after LHM, addition of a fundoplication is established as standard. The anterior 180° Dor is the wrap type of choice. This standard (LHM + Dor procedure) has now been challenged: Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) was introduced into clinical practice by Harihiro Inoue in 2010, and has now been intensively investigated in specialised centres worldwide. This allows creation of a "Heller myotomy" through the endoscopic route. Complication rates are low, symptom control is excellent and systematic reviews of published series show similar or slightly superior dysphagia control with POEM than with LHM. Advantages of POEM are the possibility to perform a long-myotomy (of the entire length of the oesophagus if necessary) and the relatively free choice of the localisation of the myotomy (anterior/posterior POEM). The disadvantage is the increased postoperative GER after POEM; however this sequel is managed with PPI in most cases, or a laparoscopic fundoplication, if necessary. Preliminary results of two prospectively randomised trials show the superiority of POEM over PD, as well as the non-inferiority to LHM, but increased postoperative GER. The author uses a tailored approach, with preference of POEM for achalasia type III and type II with chest pain and LHM + Dor for sigmoid achalasia and other associated morphological changes. The procedure in all other patients is depends on individual personal preferences.
Die Therapie der primär idiopathischen Achalasie, der häufigsten der seltenen Ösophagusmotilitätsstörungen, unterliegt derzeit einem Wandel. Zunehmend setzt sich das Prinzip der „Heller-Myotomie“ als Standard durch. Mit der von dem deutschen Chirurgen Ernst Heller im Jahr 1913 erstbeschriebenen Kardiomyotomie lässt sich meist eine sehr gute Symptomkontrolle erzielen. Metaanalysen randomisierter Studien (Level-1A-Evidenz) zeigen die Überlegenheit der laparoskopischen Heller-Myotomie (LHM) gegenüber der pneumatischen Dilatation (PD). Protagonisten der PD beziehen sich zumeist auf die Ergebnisse der europäischen Multicenterstudie, die mit häufig wiederholten PD vergleichbare Ergebnisse wie die LHM erzielt hat, mit allerdings einer (nicht Intention-to-treat inkludierten) initialen PD-Serie mit inakzeptabel hoher Perforationsrate (33%). Zur Prävention eines postoperativen gastroösophagealen Refluxes (GER) nach LHM ist die Hinzunahme einer Fundoplicatio obligat. Die Manschette der Wahl ist die anteriore 180°-Fundoplicatio nach Dor. Allerdings wird dieser Standard (LHM + Dor-Prozedur) nun bereits wieder herausgefordert. Die 2010 durch Haruhiro Inoue eingeführte und seither weltweit klinisch erprobte perorale endoskopische Myotomie (POEM) ermöglicht die Durchführung der „Heller-Myotomie“ auf rein endoskopischem Wege. Die Komplikationsraten von POEM sind gering, die Symptomkontrolle ist in systematischen Reviews der publizierten Serien zur LHM vergleichbar oder sogar diskret überlegen. Vorteile der POEM sind u. a. die Möglichkeit, eine lange Myotomie (erforderlichenfalls des gesamten Ösophagus) durchzuführen und die relativ freie Wählbarkeit der Lokalisation der Myotomie (anteriores/posteriores POEM). Nachteile von POEM sind die bewiesen höhere postoperative Refluxrate nach POEM im Vergleich zur LHM, bei allerdings meist guter Behandelbarkeit des Refluxes mit PPI, erforderlichenfalls (selten) nachträglicher laparoskopischer Dor-Fundoplicatio. (Vorläufige) Ergebnisse von 2 prospektiv randomisierten Studien zeigen die Überlegenheit der POEM gegenüber der PD und Gleichwertigkeit der POEM zu LHM + Dor-Prozedur, bei erhöhtem GER. Im eigenen Vorgehen werden POEM und LHM in einem „Tailored Approach“ (maßgeschneidert) verwendet: POEM wird bevorzugt bei Typ III und Typ II mit Brustschmerzen, LHM bei sigmoidaler Achalasie und morphologischen Begleitveränderungen (Hernie, Divertikel etc.), ansonsten liberalere Verfahrenswahl.
Esophageal neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) is rare1 and often progresses rapidly with poor prognoses2,3 .

It was presumed syntaxin-1A (STX1A) might relate to the pathophysiology of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but the results were inconsistent. The present study aims to confirm whether the STX1A gene is involved in the susceptibility of children ADHD. We genotyped three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of STX1A gene using Sequenom MassARRAY technology. A case-control study was performed among Chinese Han population including 754 cases and 772 controls from two different provinces. The Conners Parent Symptom Questionnaire and Integrated Visual and Auditory Continuous Performance Test were used to assess ADHD clinical symptoms. We found for the first time that rs3793243 GG genotype carriers had a lower risk of ADHD compared with AA genotype (OR 0.564, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.406-0.692, P = 0.001), and rs875342 was also associated with children ADHD (OR 1.806, 95% CI 1.349-2.591, P = 0.001). In addition, the two positive SNPs were also significantly associated with the clinical characteristics of ADHD. Expression quantitative trait loci analysis indicated that rs3793243 might mediate STX1A gene expression. Using a case-control study to explore the association between STX1A gene and children ADHD in Chinese Han population, our results suggest STX1A genetic variants might contribute to the susceptibility of children ADHD.
To report a case of metastatic cutaneous melanoma presenting with choroidal metastasis simulating primary uveal melanoma.
Case report.
Presentation of clinical, radiographic, histopathologic, and tumor genetic findings in a patient with cutaneous melanoma with choroidal metastasis.
A 50-year-old man with a remote history of stage 1A cutaneous melanoma presented with eye pain, peripheral vision loss, floaters, red eye, and choroidal mass that was originally diagnosed as a primary uveal melanoma at an outside institution; however, subsequent imaging and clinical evaluation demonstrated that this choroidal mass was the first manifestation of widely metastatic cutaneous melanoma (liver, pancreas, lung, bone, brain, and orbit lesions). Histopathologic analysis of the tumor after enucleation was consistent with cutaneous melanoma, and tumor genetic testing was positive for BRAF V600E mutation, confirming the choroidal lesion to be a cutaneous melanoma metastasis rather than a primary choroidal melanoma.
Metastatic cutaneous melanoma to the orbit or globe occurs rarely. Tumor genetic testing may help differentiate metastatic cutaneous melanoma from primary uveal melanoma in cases where the diagnosis is uncertain, and can also inform therapy and prognostic counseling.
To describe our early experience with gene expression profiling (GEP) assessment for juxtafoveal, subfoveal, and peripapillary indeterminate high-risk melanocytic lesions to assist in making early treatment decisions in patients who did not feel comfortable with either close observation or definitive treatment.
A prospective cohort of patients with indeterminate lesions who underwent GEP were enrolled. Nonparametric statistical analysis was utilized given the small sample size.
Fifteen patients were included in this series. Six (40%) were class 1A and 9 (60%) class 1B. Class 1A and 1B lesions had a median of three and four clinical risk factors, respectively (p = 0.27). There was no statistically significant difference for the largest basal diameter between the classes (p = 0.31); however, class 1B lesions were thicker than class 1A lesions (p = 0.03). None of the class 1A lesions showed definite growth or metastasis over a mean follow-up period of 17.1 ± 1.8 months from fine needle aspiration biopsy. All class 1B patients opted for plaque brachytherapy, and to date none of these patients have developed metastasis, with a mean follow-up of 18.7 ± 8.4 months.
There may be a role for GEP assessment in high-risk, indeterminate, posteriorly located choroidal lesions to assist in treatment planning.
Intravesical chemotherapeutical agents after transurethral resection have shown to be effective in reducing the risk of recurrence and progression during the follow up. Specifically, an early single chemotherapeutical instillation (SI) might play an important role but the efficacy of this treatment has been questioned. For these reasons, we sought to review and summarize the current evidence with a non-systematic Medline/PubMed literature search. Level 1a evidence strongly supports the utility of SI in reducing recurrence in low-intermediate risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) patients, with about 35% of relative reduction rates in patients with single, &lt;3 cm and low-intermediate stage and grade tumors. The efficacy of this procedure is particularly evident when epirubicin or mitomycin C is administered. However, no randomized controlled trials compared the effect of the different types of drugs for SI. Only few trials have analyzed the effect of timing in SI, therefore, the optimal delivery timeframe is not yet completely clear with some series suggesting that a delivery within the first 2 hours after surgery might have an impact on recurrence rates and others that show no differences with those treated within 24 hours. None of the patients included in the randomized controlled trials analyzed in this review suffered from systemic toxicity. On the other hand, other side effects were recorded, including: chemical cystitis and skin reaction. Although it is a safe procedure, rare severe complications have been reported in the literature, mostly due to extravasation of drugs in patients who underwent extended resection or bladder perforation. To avoid potential deadly complications, SI should not be administered in these patients.
The simple and caged xanthones from Clusiaceae showed significant antineoplastic activity. This study aims to identify structural diverse xanthones and search for novel antitumor natural products from this family plants.
The structures of new compounds 1a and 1b were elucidated mainly through comprehensive NMR and MS spectroscopic data, and their absolute configurations were determined by the comparison of the experimental and calculated electronic circular dichroism.
A pair of new xanthone enantiomers, (+)- and (-)-cracochinxanthone A (1a and 1b), along with thirty known analogues (2-31), were isolated from extracts of the stems and leaves of C. cochinchinense. Preliminary biological assay of some isolates against HL-60, PC-3, and MDA-MB-231 cancer cell lines.
Some isolated xanthones exhibited high sensitivity against three human malignant cell lines and the structure-activity relationship study showed that the prenyl and geranyl units may play an important role in antitumor activity.
The complete genome of a novel coronavirus was sequenced directly from the cloacal swab of a Canada goose that perished in a die-off of Canada and Snow geese in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, Canada. Comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis indicate it is a new species of Gammacoronavirus, as it falls below the threshold of 90% amino acid similarity in the protein domains used to demarcate Coronaviridae. Additional features that distinguish the genome of Canada goose coronavirus include 6 novel ORFs, a partial duplication of the 4 gene and a presumptive change in the proteolytic processing of polyproteins 1a and 1ab.
Hepatic uptake transporters (solute carriers, SLCs), including organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1, sodium-dependent taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP), organic anion (OAT2) and organic cation (OCT1) transporters, play a key role in determining the systemic and liver exposure of chemically diverse drugs. Here, we established a phenotyping approach to quantify the contribution of the six SLCs, and passive diffusion, to the overall uptake using plated human hepatocytes (PHH). First, selective inhibitor conditions were identified by screening about 20 inhibitors across the six SLCs, using single-transfected HEK293 cells. Data implied rifamycin SV (20 µM) inhibits three OATPs, while rifampicin (5µM) inhibits OATP1B1/1B3 only. Further, hepatitis B virus myristoylated-preS1 peptide (HBVpep, 0.1 µM), quinidine (100 µM) and ketoprofen (100-300 µM) are relatively selective against NTCP, OCT1 and OAT2, respectively. Second, using these inhibitory conditions, the fraction transported (ft) by the individual SLCs was characterized for 20 substrates with PHH. Generally, extended clearance classification system (ECCS) class 1A/3A (e.g., warfarin) and 1B/3B compounds (e.g., statins) showed predominant OAT2 and OATP1B1/1B3 contribution, respectively. OCT1-mediated uptake was prominent for class 2/4 compounds (e.g., metformin). Third, in vitro ft values were corrected using quantitative proteomics data to obtained 'scaled ft'. Fourth, in vitro-in vivo extrapolation of the scaled OATP1B1/1B3 ft was assessed leveraging statin clinical drug-drug interaction data with rifampicin as perpetrator. Finally, we outlined a novel step-wise strategy to implement phenotypic characterization of SLC-mediated hepatic uptake for new molecular entities and drugs in a drug discovery and development setting.
Our previous study using interleukin-1α/β-knockout (IL-1-KO) and wild-type (WT) mice demonstrated that IL-1 acts as a positive factor for constitutive gene expression of hepatic cytochrome P4507a1 (Cyp7a1). In this study, to clarify the role of IL-1 in the expression of the hepatic Cyp7a1 gene, we focused on Cyp7a1 transcriptional regulators such as α-fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF), liver X receptor α (LXRα), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) and small heterodimer partner (SHP) and examined the effects of IL-1 on their gene expression by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction using IL-1-KO and WT mice. We observed no significant differences between sex-matched IL-1-KO and WT mice with regard to gene expression levels of FTF, LXRα, and HNF4α, all of which are positive transcriptional regulators for the Cyp7a1 gene. However, interindividual differences in hepatic FTF and LXRα expression were closely dependent on the gene expression level(s) of hepatic IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), while interindividual differences in hepatic HNF4α were clearly correlated with the expression of IL-1, but not TNF-α. In contrast, the gene expression level of SHP, which is a negative transcriptional regulator of the Cyp7a1 gene through inhibition of FTF function, was higher in IL-1-KO mice than in sex-matched WT mice. These findings demonstrate that, like TNF-α, IL-1 positively controls the gene expression of Cyp7a1 transcriptional upregulators but, in contrast to the previously reported action of TNF-α, IL-1 also acts to downregulate SHP gene expression.
Small heterodimer partner (SHP) plays important roles in diverse biological processes by directly interacting with transcription factors and inhibiting their activities. SHP has been designated an orphan nuclear receptor, but whether its activity can be modulated by ligands has been a long-standing question. Recently, retinoid-related molecules, including 4-[3-(1-adamantyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl]-3-chlorocinnamic acid (3Cl-AHPC), were shown to bind to SHP and enhance apoptosis. We have examined whether 3Cl-AHPC acts as an agonist and increases SHP activity in the repression of bile acid biosynthetic CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 genes and delineated the underlying mechanisms. Contrary to this expectation, micromolar concentrations of 3Cl-AHPC increased CYP7A1 expression but indirectly via p38 kinase signaling. Nanomolar concentrations, however, repressed CYP7A1 expression and decreased bile acid levels in HepG2 cells, and little repression was observed when SHP was down-regulated by small hairpin RNA. Mechanistic studies revealed that 3Cl-AHPC bound to SHP, increased the interaction of SHP with liver receptor homologue (LRH)-1, a hepatic activator for CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 genes, and with repressive cofactors, Brahma, mammalian Sin3a, and histone deacetylase-1, and, subsequently, increased the occupancy of SHP and these cofactors at the promoters. Mutation of Leu-100, predicted to contact 3Cl-AHPC within the SHP ligand binding pocket by molecular modeling, severely impaired the increased interaction with LRH-1, and repression of LRH-1 activity mediated by 3Cl-AHPC. 3Cl-AHPC repressed SHP metabolic target genes in a gene-specific manner in human primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells. These data suggest that SHP may act as a ligand-regulated receptor in metabolic pathways. Modulation of SHP activity by synthetic ligands may be a useful therapeutic strategy.
We reported previously that mice overexpressing cytochrome P450 7a1 (Cyp7a1; Cyp7a1-tg mice) are protected against high fat diet-induced hypercholesterolemia, obesity, and insulin resistance. Here, we investigated the underlying mechanism of bile acid signaling in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis in Cyp7a1-tg mice. Cyp7a1-tg mice had two-fold higher Cyp7a1 activity and bile acid pool than did wild-type mice. Gallbladder bile acid composition changed from predominantly cholic acid (57%) in wild-type to chenodeoxycholic acid (54%) in Cyp7a1-tg mice. Cyp7a1-tg mice had higher biliary and fecal cholesterol and bile acid secretion rates than did wild-type mice. Surprisingly, hepatic de novo cholesterol synthesis was markedly induced in Cyp7a1-tg mice but intestine fractional cholesterol absorption in Cyp7a1-tg mice remained the same as wild-type mice despite the presence of increased intestine bile acids. Interestingly, hepatic but not intestinal expression of several cholesterol (adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette G5/G8 [ABCG5/G8], scavenger receptor class B, member 1) and bile acid (ABCB11) transporters were significantly induced in Cyp7a1-tg mice. Treatment of mouse or human hepatocytes with a farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist GW4064 or bile acids induced hepatic Abcg5/g8 expression. A functional FXR binding site was identified in the Abcg5 gene promoter. Study of tissue-specific Fxr knockout mice demonstrated that loss of the Fxr gene in the liver attenuated bile acid induction of hepatic Abcg5/g8 and gallbladder cholesterol content, suggesting a role of FXR in the regulation of cholesterol transport.
This study revealed a new mechanism by which increased Cyp7a1 activity expands the hydrophobic bile acid pool, stimulating hepatic cholesterol synthesis and biliary cholesterol secretion without increasing intestinal cholesterol absorption. This study demonstrated that Cyp7a1 plays a critical role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis and underscores the importance of bile acid signaling in regulating overall cholesterol homeostasis.
Small Heterodimer Partner (SHP) inhibits numerous transcription factors that are involved in diverse biological processes, including lipid and glucose metabolism. In response to increased hepatic bile acids, SHP gene expression is induced and the SHP protein is stabilized. We now show that the activity of SHP is also increased by posttranslational methylation at Arg-57 by protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5). Adenovirus-mediated hepatic depletion of PRMT5 decreased SHP methylation and reversed the suppression of metabolic genes by SHP. Mutation of Arg-57 decreased SHP interaction with its known cofactors, Brm, mSin3A, and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), but not with G9a, and decreased their recruitment to SHP target genes in mice. Hepatic overexpression of SHP inhibited metabolic target genes, decreased bile acid and hepatic triglyceride levels, and increased glucose tolerance. In contrast, mutation of Arg-57 selectively reversed the inhibition of SHP target genes and metabolic outcomes. The importance of Arg-57 methylation for the repression activity of SHP provides a molecular basis for the observation that a natural mutation of Arg-57 in humans is associated with the metabolic syndrome. Targeting posttranslational modifications of SHP may be an effective therapeutic strategy by controlling selected groups of genes to treat SHP-related human diseases, such as metabolic syndrome, cancer, and infertility.
Bile acid homeostasis is tightly regulated via a feedback loop operated by the nuclear receptors farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and small heterodimer partner (SHP). Contrary to current models, which place FXR upstream of SHP in a linear regulatory pathway, here we show that the phenotypic consequences in mice of the combined loss of both receptors are much more severe than the relatively modest impact of the loss of either Fxr or Shp alone. Fxr-/-Shp-/- mice exhibited cholestasis and liver injury as early as 3 weeks of age, and this was linked to the dysregulation of bile acid homeostatic genes, particularly cytochrome P450, family 7, subfamily a, polypeptide 1 (Cyp7a1). In addition, double-knockout mice showed misregulation of genes in the C21 steroid biosynthesis pathway, with strong induction of cytochrome P450, family 17, subfamily a, polypeptide 1 (Cyp17a1), resulting in elevated serum levels of its enzymatic product 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP). Treatment of WT mice with 17-OHP was sufficient to induce liver injury that reproduced many of the histopathological features observed in the double-knockout mice. Therefore, our data indicate a pathologic role for increased production of 17-hydroxy steroid metabolites in liver injury and suggest that Fxr-/-Shp-/- mice could provide a model for juvenile onset cholestasis.
The effects of the secondary bile acid, lithocholic acid (LCA), a VDR, FXR and PXR ligand, on the regulation of bile acid metabolism (CYP3A isozymes), synthesis (CYP7A1), and transporter proteins (MRP3, MRP2, BSEP, NTCP) as well as nuclear receptors (FXR, PXR, LXRα, HNF1α, HNF4α and SHP) were studied in rat and human precision-cut intestine and liver slices at the mRNA level. Changes due to 5 to 10 μM of LCA were compared to those of other prototype ligands for VDR, FXR, PXR and GR. LCA induced rCYP3A1 and rCYP3A9 in the rat jejunum, ileum and colon, rCYP3A2 only in the ileum, rCYP3A9 expression in the liver, and CYP3A4 in the human ileum but not in liver. LCA induced the expression of rMRP2 in the colon but not in the jejunum and ileum but did not affect rMRP3 expression along the length of the rat intestine. In human ileum slices, LCA induced hMRP3 and hMRP2 expression. In rat liver slices, LCA decreased rCYP7A1, rLXRα and rHNF4α expression, induced rSHP expression, but did not affect rBSEP or rNTCP expression; whereas in the human liver, a small but significant decrease was found for hHNF1α expression. These data suggests profound species differences in the effects of LCA on bile acid transport, synthesis and detoxification. An examination of the effects of prototype VDR, PXR, GR and FXR ligands showed that these pathways are all intact in precision cut slices and that LCA exerted VDR, PXR and FXR effects. The LCA-induced altered enzymes and transporter expressions in the intestine and liver would affect the disposition of drugs.
To examine the mRNA expression of hepatobiliary transporters in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) patients and to compare bile acid absorption, synthesis, and efflux in patients with non-end-stage and end-stage PBC, we obtained liver samples from PBC patients by percutaneous needle biopsy. End-stage PBC was defined as follows: histological stage IV; cirrhosis; serum total bilirubin, ≥4.0 mg/dl; and Child-Pugh Class C. The mRNA expression levels of sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), bile salt export pump (BSEP), and hepatic cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) were significantly higher in the PBC patients than in the controls (P &lt; 0.01). The mRNA levels of NTCP and BSEP were significantly higher in the end-stage PBC patients than in the controls (P &lt; 0.01). However, hepatic CYP7A1 mRNA expression decreased significantly (by 70%) in the patients with end-stage PBC as compared to the controls and the patients with non-end-stage PBC (P &lt; 0.01). The hepatic expression of transporters mediating bile acid influx and efflux showed sustained elevation, whereas that of the rate-limiting enzyme for bile acid biosynthesis was attenuated in the end-stage PBC patients. Thus, mechanisms may be present preventing the accumulation of toxic bile acids in the hepatocytes of end-stage PBC patients.
There is interindividual variation in lipid-lowering response to statins. The objective of this study was to investigate whether common variation in genes involved in lipid and statin metabolism modify the effect of statins on serum total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentration in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients. We studied the association between 18 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in six genes (HMGCR, CETP, APOAI, ABCB1, CYP3A4, CYP7A1) in response to atorvastatin therapy (20 mg/day) in 265 newly diagnosed CAD patients using multivariable adjusted general linear regression. Variant alleles of ABCB1 (-41A/G), HMGCR SNP29 G/T, rs5908A/G, rs12916C/T, and CYP7A1-204A/C polymorphisms were significantly associated with attenuated LDL-C reduction and variant alleles of CETP TaqI, -629C/A, and APOAI PstI polymorphisms were associated with higher increase in high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. A three-loci interaction model consisting of CYP7A1rs892871AA/APOAIPstIP1P1/HMGCR rs12916CT was a better predictor for LDL-C lowering, when compared with single polymorphisms analysis on statin response. Variant genotypes of APOAI -2500C/T, CETP 405I/V, and ABCB1 3435C/T showed higher risk of myocardial infarction events (p &lt; 0.05) in a 1-year follow-up of CAD patients. These results suggest that SNPs in lipid and statin pathway genes are associated with reduced LDL-C lowering by statins and identify individuals who may be resistant to maximal LDL-C lowering by statins.
Orphan nuclear receptor Small Heterodimer Partner (SHP; NR0B2) is a transcriptional corepressor of a wide variety of nuclear receptors (NRs). Here, we report that SHP recruits SIRT1, a class III histone deacetylase, in an NR-specific manner to inhibit transcriptional activity. SHP interacts and co-localizes specifically with SIRT1 in vivo and inhibition of SIRT1 activity leads to a recovery from the intrinsic repressive activity of SHP but not of DAX1. Furthermore, we observed that SIRT1 does not deacetylate SHP or LRH1. However, inhibition of either SIRT1 or SHP significantly diminished the repressive effect of SHP on LRH1 transactivity. LRH1-mediated activation of CYP7A1 and SHP gene transcription was significantly repressed by both SHP and SIRT1 whereas inhibition of SIRT1 activity by inhibitors or dominant negative SIRT1 or knockdown of SHP led to a significant release of this inhibitory effect. ChIP assays revealed that SHP recruits SIRT1 on LRH1 target gene promoters and SIRT1 deacetylated template-dependent histone H3 and H4 to inhibit transcription of LRH1 target genes. Finally, we demonstrated that inhibition of SIRT1 activity significantly reversed SHP-mediated inhibition of bile-acid synthesis by LRH1 overexpression, thereby suggesting a novel mechanism of SHP-mediated inhibition of LRH1-dependent bile-acid homeostasis via recruitment of SIRT1 histone deacetylase protein.
Bile acid sequestrants have been shown to lower glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. To investigate how colesevelam (CL) HCl improves hyperglycemia, studies were conducted in diet-induced obesity (F-DIO) rats, which develop insulin resistance when fed a high-energy (high fat/high sucrose) diet (HE). The rats were fed HE; HE + 2% CL; HE + 0.02% SC-435 (SC), an apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter inhibitor; and regular chow (controls). After 4 wk of treatment, both in the HE group and the SC + HE group, plasma glucose and insulin levels remained elevated compared with baseline values throughout an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). In contrast, in the CL + HE group, plasma glucose levels returned to baseline by the end of the test, and insulin peaked in 15-30 min and then returned to baseline. CL induced release of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) because the area under the curve of plasma total GLP-1 in the CL + HE group was significantly greater than in the HE group during the OGTT. Bile acid concentrations in the portal blood did not decrease in the HE group but declined significantly both in the CL + HE and SC + HE groups with reduced farnesoid X receptor activation compared with controls. We concluded that CL reduces plasma glucose levels by improving insulin resistance in this rat model. It is unlikely that the improvement is attributable to decreased bile acid flux to the liver but is likely secondary to induced GLP-1 secretion, which improves insulin release.
Cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1) and the bile acid pool size are increased 2 to 3-fold in lactating postpartum rats. We investigated the interaction of nuclear receptors with the Cyp7a1 proximal promoter and the expression of regulatory signaling pathways in postpartum rats at day 10 (PPd10) versus female controls to identify the mechanisms of increased expression of Cyp7a1, which is maximal at 16 hours. Liver X receptor (LXRalpha) and RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) recruitment to Cyp7a1 chromatin were increased 1.5- and 2.5-fold, respectively, at 16 hours on PPd10. Expression of nuclear receptors farnesoid X receptor (FXR), LXRalpha, liver receptor homolog (LRH-1), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha), and short heterodimer partner (SHP) messenger RNA (mRNA) and coactivator peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) mRNA was unchanged in PPd10 versus controls at 16 hours, whereas chicken ovalbumin upstream transcription factor II (COUP-TFII) was decreased 40% at 16 hours. Investigation of a repressive signaling pathway, the c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway in PPd10 versus controls, showed decreased mRNA expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF; decreased 60% at 16 hours) and tyrosine kinase receptor c-Met (decreased 44%-50% at 16 hours), but these were not accompanied by decreased expression of phosphorylated c-Jun. Importantly, expression of fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15) mRNA in the ileum was decreased 70% in PPd10 versus controls, whereas phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) protein expression in liver was decreased 88% at 16 hours.
The increased recruitment of LXRalpha, a Cyp7a1 stimulatory pathway, and decreased expression of FGF15 and phosphorylated Erk1/2, a Cyp7a1 repressive pathway, combined to increase Cyp7a1 expression during lactation.
The liver is currently known to be the major organ to eliminate excess cholesterol from our body. It accomplishes this function in two ways: conversion of cholesterol molecules into bile acids (BAs) and secretion of unesterified cholesterol molecules into bile. BAs are synthesized in the hepatocytes, secreted into bile and delivered to the lumen of the small intestine where they act as detergents to facilitate absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins. About 95% of BAs are recovered in the ileum during each cycle of the enterohepatic circulation. Five percent are lost and replaced by newly synthesized BAs, which amounts to approximately 500 mg/day in adult humans. In contrast to the efficiency of the BAs' enterohepatic circulation, 50% of the 1000 mg of cholesterol secreted daily into bile is lost in feces. It is known that rare human mutations in certain genes in bile acid and bile metabolic pathway influence blood cholesterol levels. With the recent success of genome-wide association studies, we are convinced that common genetic variants also play a role in the genetic architecture of plasma lipid traits. In this review, we summarized the current state of knowledge about genetic variations in bile acid and bile metabolic pathway, and assessed their impact on blood cholesterol levels and cholesterol metabolic kinetics in the population.
Bile acid homeostasis is critical in maintaining health and is primarily regulated by the nuclear receptors farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and small heterodimer partner (SHP). Bile acid-activated FXR indirectly inhibits expression of cholesterol 7alpha hydroxylase (CYP7A1), a key enzyme in conversion of cholesterol to bile acids, by induction of SHP. We recently demonstrated that SHP inhibits CYP7A1 transcription by recruiting chromatin-modifying cofactors, including Brm-Swi/Snf. Swi/Snf complexes contain either Brm or Brg-1 ATPases, and whether these subunits have distinct functions remains unclear. We have examined the role of these subunits in regulation of bile acid metabolism under physiological conditions by FXR and SHP. Brg-1 interacted with FXR and enhanced FXR-mediated transactivation of SHP, whereas Brm interacted with SHP and enhanced SHP-mediated repression of CYP7A1 and, interestingly, auto-repression of SHP. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and remodeling studies revealed that after treatment with FXR agonists, Brg-1 was recruited to the SHP promoter, resulting in transcriptionally active accessible chromatin, whereas Brm was recruited to both CYP7A1 and SHP promoters, resulting in inactive inaccessible chromatin. Our studies demonstrate that Brm and Brg-1 have distinct functions in the regulation of two key genes, CYP7A1 and SHP, within a single physiological pathway, feedback inhibition of bile acid biosynthesis, by differentially targeting SHP and FXR.
In mammals, many aspects of behavior and physiology, and in particular cellular metabolism, are coordinated by the circadian timing system. Molecular clocks are thought to rely on negative feedback loops in clock gene expression that engender oscillations in the accumulation of transcriptional regulatory proteins, such as the orphan receptor REV-ERBalpha. Circadian transcription factors then drive daily rhythms in the expression of clock-controlled output genes, for example genes encoding enzymes and regulators of cellular metabolism. To gain insight into clock output functions of REV-ERBalpha, we carried out genome-wide transcriptome profiling experiments with liver RNA from wild-type mice, Rev-erbalpha knock-out mice, or REV-ERBalpha overexpressing mice. On the basis of these genetic loss- and gain-of-function experiments, we concluded that REV-ERBalpha participates in the circadian modulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) activity, and thereby in the daily expression of SREBP target genes involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism. This control is exerted via the cyclic transcription of Insig2, encoding a trans-membrane protein that sequesters SREBP proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum membranes and thereby interferes with the proteolytic activation of SREBPs in Golgi membranes. REV-ERBalpha also participates in the cyclic expression of cholesterol-7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the rate-limiting enzyme in converting cholesterol to bile acids. Our findings suggest that this control acts via the stimulation of LXR nuclear receptors by cyclically produced oxysterols. In conclusion, our study suggests that rhythmic cholesterol and bile acid metabolism is not just driven by alternating feeding-fasting cycles, but also by REV-ERBalpha, a component of the circadian clockwork circuitry.
Common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes of lipid metabolism modestly influence plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). We evaluated a panel of LDL-C-modulating SNPs for potential association with risk of CAD in Asian Indians. Fifteen SNPs of CETP, ABCB1, APOAI, CYP7A1, and HMGCR genes were genotyped in 265 CAD patients and 150 controls of North Indian origin. A proatherogenic genotype score was formulated based on number of alleles associated with LDL-C and was evaluated for association with risk of CAD. We observed 12 SNPs from CETP, APOAI, ABCB1, CYP7A1, and HMGCR genes to be associated with baseline LDL-C and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and increased risk of CAD (p &lt; 0.05). Co-occurrence of three or more risk alleles (proartherogenic genotype score &gt;or=3) was associated with increased risk of CAD and myocardial infarction. Analysis of epistatic interactions revealed CETPTaqIB1B1/405II/APOAI-75GA to be best model of CAD risk prediction in our population. Our study highlights synergistic association of multiple SNPs of lipid pathway with LDL-C levels and risk of CAD, and indicates that co-occurrence of proatherogenic risk alleles may provide incremental information about CAD risk beyond lipid concentrations.
Intraluminal concentrations of bile acids are low in newborn infants and increase rapidly after birth, at least partly owing to increased bile acid synthesis rates. The expansion of the bile acid pool is critical since bile acids are required to stimulate bile flow and absorb lipids, a major component of newborn diets. The purpose of the present studies was to determine the mechanism responsible for the increase in bile acid synthesis rates and the subsequent enlargement of bile acid pool sizes (BAPS) during the neonatal period, and how changes in circulating hormone levels might affect BAPS. In the hamster, pool size was low just after birth and increased modestly until 10.5 days postpartum (dpp). BAPS increased more significantly ( approximately 3-fold) between 10.5 and 15.5 dpp. An increase in mRNA and protein levels of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1), the rate-limiting step in classical bile acid synthesis, immediately preceded an increase in BAPS. In contrast, levels of oxysterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (Cyp7b1), a key enzyme in bile acid synthesis by the alternative pathway, were relatively elevated by 1.5 dpp. farnesyl X receptor (FXR) and short heterodimeric partner (SHP) mRNA levels remained relatively constant at a time when Cyp7a1 levels increased. Finally, although simultaneous increases in circulating cortisol and Cyp7a1 levels occurred, precocious expression of Cyp7a1 could not be induced in neonatal hamsters with dexamethasone. Thus the significant increase in Cyp7a1 levels in neonatal hamsters is due to mechanisms independent of the FXR and SHP pathway and cortisol.
Peroxisome proliferators, such as the lipid-lowering fibrates that function as agonists for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), induce liver tumors in rodents and may produce cholestasis in humans. Considerable attention has focused on peroxisome proliferator-induced hepatocellular carcinoma, a phenomenon not noted in man, whereas limited studies examine fibrates and other therapeutic drugs that induce cholestasis, a common finding in humans. Moreover, the mechanisms by which fibrates induce hepatocyte proliferation and cholestasis are still not fully understood. We have examined the role of hepatocyte retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRalpha), an essential partner of PPARalpha, in modulating WY-14,643-induced hepatocyte proliferation and cholestasis. WY-14,643 treatment induced hepatomegaly in wild type (WT) mice that was also accompanied by induction of the expression of cyclins D1, D3, A2, and B1 and Cdc2 as well as inhibition of Wee 1. Such changes were either absent or greatly reduced in hepatocyte RXRalpha-null mice. Furthermore, neither WY-14,643 treatment nor RXRalpha deficiency affected apoptosis, indicating the importance of PPARalpha/RXRalpha in regulating Wee 1-mediated Cdc2/cyclin B1 expression for cells to enter into mitosis. WY-14,643 treatment also induced cholestasis and liver injury, which is evidenced by induction of alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and hepatic bile acid levels in WT mice. Hepatocyte RXRalpha deficiency protected the mice from WY-14,643-induced liver injury. WY-14,643-mediated induction of the small heterodimer partner, Mrp3, and Cyp3a11 levels was greater in hepatocyte RXRalpha-null than in WT mouse livers suggesting enhanced repression of bile acid synthesis and increased efflux of bile acids into blood for renal excretion as well as hydroxylation of bile acids because of hepatocyte RXRalpha deficiency. These data establish a crucial role of hepatocyte RXRalpha in regulating WY-14,643-mediated cell cycle progression as well as bile acid homeostasis.
Mouse fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15) and human ortholog FGF19 have been identified as the bile acid-induced intestinal factors that mediate bile acid feedback inhibition of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase gene (C YP7A1) transcription in mouse liver. The mechanism underlying FGF15/FGF19 inhibition of bile acid synthesis in hepatocytes remains unclear. Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-specific agonist GW4064 strongly induced FGF19 but inhibited CYP7A1 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in primary human hepatocytes. FGF19 strongly and rapidly repressed CYP7A1 but not small heterodimer partner (SHP) mRNA levels. Kinase inhibition and phosphorylation assays revealed that the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (MAPK/Erk1/2) pathway played a major role in mediating FGF19 inhibition of CYP7A1. However, small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of SHP did not affect FGF19 inhibition of CYP7A1. Interestingly, CDCA stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the FGF receptor 4 (FGFR4) in hepatocytes. FGF19 antibody and siRNA specific to FGFR4 abrogated GW4064 inhibition of CYP7A1. These results suggest that bile acid-activated FXR is able to induce FGF19 in hepatocytes to inhibit CYP7A1 by an autocrine/paracrine mechanism.
The hepatic FGF19/FGFR4/Erk1/2 pathway may inhibit CYP7A1 independent of SHP. In addition to inducing FGF19 in the intestine, bile acids in hepatocytes may activate the liver FGF19/FGFR4 signaling pathway to inhibit bile acid synthesis and prevent accumulation of toxic bile acid in human livers.
In the present study, the molecular mechanisms by which CM108, a flavone derivative, improves lipid profiles were investigated further. Hyperlipidaemia was induced by oral administration of high cholesterol and fat. After 4 weeks of treatment, the lipid levels in the serum, liver and faeces were measured and the liver genes involved in lipid metabolism were analysed to explore the molecular mechanisms of lowering lipids. CM108 modulated lipid profiles, including elevating the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C; 40%) and reducing serum levels of triglyceride (10%), total cholesterol (10%) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (26%). Levels of triglyceride and total cholesterol in the liver were reduced by 18% and 24%, respectively. Increased HDL-C level was attributed to the synergic effects of CM108 in increasing levels of ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC)A1, apolipoprotein AI and apolipoprotein AII in the liver. Intriguingly, CM108 induced genes, including fatty acid transport protein, acyl-CoA synthetase and lipoprotein lipase that are important for more efficient fatty acid beta-oxidation, thereby reducing serum and liver triglyceride levels. In addition, induction of ABCG5, ABCG8 and cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase contributed to cholesterol metabolism, leading to decreases in serum and liver cholesterol levels. Thus, the genes involved in lipid metabolism were systemically modulated by CM108, which contributed to the improvement of lipid profiles in hyperlipidaemic rats.
Despite the well-documented association between gallstones and the metabolic syndrome, the mechanistic links between these two disorders remain unknown. Here we show that mice solely with hepatic insulin resistance, created by liver-specific disruption of the insulin receptor (LIRKO mice) are markedly predisposed toward cholesterol gallstone formation due to at least two distinct mechanisms. Disinhibition of the forkhead transcription factor FoxO1, increases expression of the biliary cholesterol transporters Abcg5 and Abcg8, resulting in an increase in biliary cholesterol secretion. Hepatic insulin resistance also decreases expression of the bile acid synthetic enzymes, particularly Cyp7b1, and produces partial resistance to the farnesoid X receptor, leading to a lithogenic bile salt profile. As a result, after twelve weeks on a lithogenic diet, all of the LIRKO mice develop gallstones. Thus, hepatic insulin resistance provides a crucial link between the metabolic syndrome and increased cholesterol gallstone susceptibility.
To investigate the expressions of small heterodimer partner (SHP) and target gene cholesterol-7-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) in livers of rats with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), and to study the mechanism of ICP.
Thirty SD rats (pregnant for 15 days) were equally and randomly divided into two groups: an estradiol benzoate (EB) group and a normal saline (NS) group. Two ml blood was drawn from each rat before and on the 5th day after medicine administration to measure the levels of ALT, AST, ALP, TBA, TBIL, and DBIL. After delivery, the histopathological changes of the mother rat livers were studied. The mRNA and protein expressions of SHP and CYP7A1 in the livers were determined by RT-PCR and Western blot.
(1) In the EB group, the serum levels of ALT, AST, ALP, TBA, TBil, and DBil after EB administration increased significantly (P less than 0.01), but there were no significant changes in the NS group (P more than 0.05); (2) Intrahepatic cholestasis appeared in the EB group, but not in the NS group; (3) The mRNA expressions of SHP and CYP7A1 were significantly higher in the EB group than in the NS group [(SHPmRNA: NS 0.365+/-0.0317 vs EB 0.4865+/-0.0237, P less than 0.01), (CYP7A1 mRNA: NS 0.3570+/-0.0175 vs EB 0.4802+/-0.0217, P less than 0.01)]; (4) The protein expressions of SHP and CYP7A1 were also higher in the EB group than that in the NS group [(SHP: NS 0.3762+/-0.0284 vs EB 0.5033+/-0.0274, P less than 0.01), (CYP7A1: NS 0.3570+/-0.0175 vs EB 0.4802+/-0.0217, P less than 0.01)].
Estrogen induces ICP in rats. The mRNA and protein expressions of SHP and CYP7A1 in livers of the ICP rats were increased, which causes more bile acids to be synthesized. This may be one of the mechanisms of ICP.
Conversion into bile acids represents an important route to remove excess cholesterol from the body. Rev-erbalpha is a nuclear receptor that participates as one of the clock genes in the control of circadian rhythmicity and plays a regulatory role in lipid metabolism and adipogenesis. Here, we investigate a potential role for Rev-erbalpha in the control of bile acid metabolism via the regulation of the neutral bile acid synthesis pathway.
Bile acid synthesis and CYP7A1 gene expression were studied in vitro and in vivo in mice deficient for or over expressing Rev-erbalpha.
Rev-erbalpha-deficient mice display a lower synthesis rate and an impaired excretion of bile acids into the bile and feces. Expression of CYP7A1, the rate-limiting enzyme of the neutral pathway, is decreased in livers of Rev-erbalpha-deficient mice, whereas adenovirus-mediated hepatic Rev-erbalpha overexpression induces its expression. Moreover, bile acid feeding resulted in a more pronounced suppression of hepatic CYP7A1 expression in Rev-erbalpha-deficient mice. Hepatic expression of E4BP4 and the orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP), both negative regulators of CYP7A1 expression, is increased in Rev-erbalpha-deficient mice. Promoter analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that SHP and E4BP4 are direct Rev-erbalpha target genes. Finally, the circadian rhythms of liver CYP7A1, SHP, and E4BP4 messenger RNA levels were perturbed in Rev-erbalpha-deficient mice.
These data identify a role for Rev-erbalpha in the regulatory loop of bile acid synthesis, likely acting by regulating both hepatic SHP and E4BP4 expression.
Growth hormone (GH) function is mediated through multiple endocrine pathways. In the liver, GH also transcriptionally activates hepatocyte nuclear factor-6 (HNF-6; OC-1), a liver-enriched transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes essential to hepatic function. We hypothesize that GH modulates hepatic function in the normal and injured liver through HNF-6 and HNF-6 target genes. CD1 mice received PBS or GH for the 1-, 7-, and 28-day course of Sham operation or bile duct ligation (BDL). Proliferation-, metabolic-, and profibrotic-specific hepatic functions were assessed with a focus on candidate HNF-6 transcriptional target genes. Confirmation of HNF-6 regulation was done by analysis of target gene expression in liver infected with recombinant adenovirus AdHNF-6 expression vectors. GH administration upregulated HNF-6 expression throughout the course of liver injury. This was associated with increased expression of HNF-6 proliferative target genes cyclin D1 and metabolic gene Cyp7A1 and downregulation of profibrogenic TGFb2R. Hepatic function improved such as enhanced hepatocyte proliferation, higher cholesterol clearance throughout the course of injury, and attenuated fibrogenic response at day 28 of BDL. GH treatment also transcriptionally increased albumin expression in an HNF-6-independent manner. This was associated with enhanced serum albumin levels. In conclusion, the GH/HNF-6 axis is a potential in vivo mechanism underlying GH diverse function in the liver to modulate the liver repair response to BDL.
Hypopituitarism is associated with dyslipidemia, and feeding hypophysectomized rats cholesterol induces severe hypercholesterolemia. This study aimed to unravel further how hypophysectomy alters cholesterol and bile acid metabolism.
Intact and hypophysectomized rats were studied during challenge with dietary cholesterol and ezetimibe and upon hormonal substitution with growth hormone, cortisone, and thyroid hormone.
Five findings were established in hypophysectomized rats: (1) The intestinal absorption of cholesterol is doubled. (2) Treatment with ezetimibe abolishes the increases in serum and liver cholesterol. (3) Only thyroid hormone treatment normalizes the increased absorption of cholesterol. (4) The intestinal gene expression of cholesterol transporters NPC1L1 and ABCG5/G8 is unaltered, whereas the hepatic expression of ABCG5/G8 is diminished but strongly stimulated by thyroid hormone. The latter mechanism was supported by measurements of biliary cholesterol and of fecal neutral steroids. (5) The reduced hepatic expression of ABCG5/G8 and Cyp7a1 was normalized by cholesterol feeding, suggesting that other nonestablished mechanisms under pituitary control are important to maintain rats resistant to dietary cholesterol.
The intestinal absorption of dietary cholesterol is under pituitary control largely exerted by thyroid hormone. Hepatic secretion of cholesterol and ABCG5/G8 expression are strongly stimulated in hypophysectomized rats during treatment with thyroid hormone.
Cholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) catalyzes a rate-limiting step in bile acid synthesis in liver, and its gene transcription is under complex regulation by multiple nuclear receptors in response to bile acids, cholesterol derivatives, and hormones. The liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1), a member of the fushi tarazu factor 1 subfamily of nuclear receptors, has emerged as an essential regulator for the expression of cyp7a1. In this report, we demonstrate Prox1, a prospero-related homeobox transcription factor, identified through a yeast two-hybrid screening, can directly interact with human LRH-1 (hLRH-1) and suppresses hLRH-1-mediated transcriptional activation of human cyp7a1 gene. Biochemical analysis demonstrates that Prox1 interacts with both the ligand binding domain (LBD) and the DNA binding domain (DBD) of hLRH-1. An LRKLL motif in Prox1 is important for the interaction with the LBD but not the DBD of hLRH-1. In hLRH-1 LBD, helices 2 and 10 are essential for Prox1 recruitment. The suppression by Prox1 on the transcriptional activity of hLRH-1 can be mediated through its interaction with the LBD or the DBD of hLRH-1. Gel shift assays reveal that Prox1 impairs the binding of hLRH-1 to the promoter of human cyp7a1 gene.
Cholesterol feeding upregulates CYP7A1 in rats but downregulates CYP7A1 in rabbits. To clarify the mechanism responsible for the upregulation of CYP7A1 in cholesterol-fed rats, the effects of dietary cholesterol (Ch) and cholic acid (CA) on the activation of the nuclear receptors, liver X-receptor (LXR-alpha) and farsenoid X-receptor (FXR), which positively and negatively regulate CYP7A1, were investigated in rats. Studies were carried out in four groups (n = 12/group) of male Sprague-Dawley rats fed regular chow (control), 2% Ch, 2% Ch + 1% CA, and 1% CA alone for 1 wk. Changes in mRNA expression of short heterodimer partner (SHP) and bile salt export pump (BSEP), target genes for FXR, were determined to indicate FXR activation, whereas the expression of ABCA1 and lipoprotein lipase (LPL), target genes for LXR-alpha, reflected activation. CYP7A1 mRNA and activity increased twofold and 70%, respectively, in rats fed Ch alone when the bile acid pool size was stable but decreased 43 and 49%, respectively, after CA was added to the Ch diet, which expanded the bile acid pool 3.4-fold. SHP and BSEP mRNA levels did not change after feeding Ch but increased 88 and 37% in rats fed Ch + CA. This indicated that FXR was activated by the expanded bile acid pool. When Ch or Ch + CA were fed, hepatic concentrations of oxysterols, ligands for LXR-alpha increased to activate LXR-alpha, as evidenced by increased mRNA levels of ABCA1 and LPL. Feeding CA alone enlarged the bile acid pool threefold and increased the expression of both SHP and BSEP. These results suggest that LXR-alpha was activated in rats fed both Ch or Ch + CA, whereas CYP7A1 mRNA and activity were induced only in Ch-fed rats where the bile acid pool was not enlarged such that FXR was not activated. In rats fed Ch + CA, the bile acid pool expanded, which activated FXR to offset the stimulatory effects of LXR-alpha on CYP7A1.
Primary human hepatocytes were used to elucidate the effect of individual bile acids on bile acid formation in human liver. Hepatocytes were treated with free as well as glycine-conjugated bile acids. Bile acid formation and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of key enzymes and the nuclear receptor short heterodimer partner (SHP) were measured after 24 hours. Glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA; 100 micromol/L) significantly decreased formation of cholic acid (CA) to 44% +/- 4% of controls and glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA) decreased formation of CA to 67% +/- 11% of controls. Glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA; 100 micromol/L) had no effect. GDCA or glycocholic acid (GCA) had no significant effect on chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) synthesis. Free bile acids had a similar effect as glycine-conjugated bile acids. Addition of GCDCA, GDCA, and GCA (100 micromol/L) markedly decreased cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) mRNA levels to 2% +/- 1%, 2% +/- 1%, and 29% +/- 11% of controls, respectively, whereas GUDCA had no effect. Addition of GDCA and GCDCA (100 micromol/L) significantly decreased sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase (CYP8B1) mRNA levels to 48% +/- 5% and 61% +/- 4% of controls, respectively, whereas GCA and GUDCA had no effect. Addition of GCDCA and GDCA (100 micromol/L) significantly decreased sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) mRNA levels to 59% +/- 3% and 60% +/- 7% of controls, respectively, whereas GUDCA and GCA had no significant effect. Addition of both GCDCA and GDCA markedly increased the mRNA levels of SHP to 298% +/- 43% and 273% +/- 30% of controls, respectively. In conclusion, glycine-conjugated and free bile acids suppress bile acid synthesis and mRNA levels of CYP7A1 in the order CDCA &gt; DCA &gt; CA &gt; UDCA. mRNA levels of CYP8B1 and CYP27A1 are suppressed to a much lower degree than CYP7A1.
The aromatase knockout (ArKO) mouse cannot synthesize endogenous estrogens due to disruption of the Cyp19 gene. We have shown previously, that ArKO mice present with age-progressive obesity and hepatic steatosis, and by 1 yr of age both male and female ArKO mice develop hypercholesterolemia. In this present study 10- to 12-wk-old ArKO mice were challenged for 90 d with high cholesterol diets. Our results show a sexually dimorphic response to estrogen deficiency in terms of cholesterol homeostasis in the liver. ArKO females presented with elevated serum cholesterol; conversely, ArKO males had elevated hepatic cholesterol levels. In response to dietary cholesterol, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase transcript levels were significantly reduced in females, whereas males showed more modest changes. Neither low density lipoprotein nor sterol regulatory element-binding protein expression levels were significantly altered by diet or genotype. The expression of Cyp7a, which encodes cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, was significantly reduced in ArKO females compared with wild-type females and was increased by cholesterol feeding. Cyp7a expression was significantly elevated in the wild-type males on the high cholesterol diet, although no difference was seen between genotypes on the control diet. The ATP-binding cassette G5 and ATP-binding cassette G8 transporters do not appear to be regulated by estrogen. The expression of acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase 2 showed a sexually dimorphic response, where estrogen appeared to have a stimulatory effect in females, but not males. This study reveals a sexually dimorphic difference in mouse hepatic cholesterol homeostasis and roles for estrogen in the regulation of cholesterol uptake, biosynthesis, and catabolism in the female, but not in the male.
Hormonal status can influence diverse metabolic pathways. Small heterodimer partner (SHP) is an orphan nuclear receptor that can modulate the activity of several transcription factors. Estrogens are here shown to directly induce expression of the SHP in the mouse and rat liver and in human HepG2 cells. SHP is rapidly induced within 2 h following treatment of mice with ethynylestradiol (EE) or the estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha)-selective compound propyl pyrazole triol (PPT). SHP induction by these estrogens is completely absent in ERalphaKO mice. Mutation of the human SHP promoter defined HNF-3, HNF-4, GATA, and AP-1 sites as important for basal activity, whereas EE induction required two distinct elements located between -309 and -267. One of these elements contains an estrogen response element half-site that bound purified ERalpha, and ERalpha with a mutated DNA binding domain was unable to stimulate SHP promoter activity. This ERalpha binding site overlaps the known farnesoid X receptor (FXR) binding site in the SHP promoter, and the combination of EE plus FXR agonists did not produce an additive induction of SHP expression in mice. Surprisingly, induction of SHP by EE did not inhibit expression of the known SHP target genes cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) or sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase (CYP8B1). However, the direct regulation of SHP expression may provide a basis for some of the numerous biological effects of estrogens.
Bile acids activate a nuclear receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), that induces bile salt export pump (BSEP) but inhibits cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) gene transcription in the liver. Guggulsterone, a plant sterol that lowers serum cholesterol, has been shown to antagonize FXR activated genes. Transient transfection assay of a human BSEP/luciferase reporter in HepG2 cells transfected with FXR reveals that guggulsterone strongly antagonizes bile acid induction of the BSEP gene. On the other hand, guggulsterone has no effect on FXR inhibition of the CYP7A1 gene, but strongly inhibits the human CYP7A1 gene by activation of pregnane X receptor (PXR). These results suggest that guggulsterone inhibits bile acid secretion from hepatocytes into bile and activates PXR to inhibit bile acid synthesis in the liver. Reduced conversion of cholesterol and bile acid excretion may lead to an increase of hepatic cholesterol and decrease of intestinal cholesterol absorption, and results in lowering serum cholesterol.
Hepatic cholesterol(ester) uptake from serum coupled to intracellular processing and biliary excretion are important features in the removal of excess cholesterol from the body. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters play an important role in hepatic cholesterol transport. The liver consists of different cell types, and ABC transporters may exert different physiological functions dependent on the individual cell type. Therefore, in the current study, using real time PCR we compared the mRNA expression of ABC transporters and genes involved in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism in liver parenchymal, endothelial, and Kupffer cells. It appears that liver parenchymal cells contain high expression levels compared with endothelial and Kupffer cells of scavenger receptor class BI ( approximately 3-fold), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)alpha and PPARgamma (8-20-fold), cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase A1 (&gt;100-fold), and ABCG5/G8 ( approximately 5-fold). Liver endothelial cells show a high expression of cholesterol 27-hydroxylase, liver X receptor (LXR)beta, PPARdelta, and ABCG1, suggesting a novel specific role for these genes in endothelial cells. In Kupffer cells, the expression level of LXRalpha, ABCA1, and in particular ABCG1 is high, leading to an ABCG1 mRNA expression level that is 70-fold higher than in parenchymal cells. It can be calculated that 51% of the total liver ABCG1 expression resides in Kupffer cells and 24% in endothelial cells, suggesting an intrahepatic-specific role for ABCG1 in Kupffer and endothelial cells. Because of a specific stimulation of ABCG1 in parenchymal cells by a high cholesterol diet, the contribution of parenchymal cells to the total liver increased from 25 to 60%. Our data indicate that for studies of the role of ABC transporters and their regulation in liver, their cellular localization should be taken into account, allowing proper interpretation of metabolic changes, which are directly related to their (intra)cellular expression level.
Expression of hepatic bile salt transporters is partly regulated by bile salts via activation of nuclear farnesoid X-activated receptor (Fxr). We investigated the physiological relevance of this regulation by evaluating transporter expression in mice experiencing different transhepatic bile salt fluxes.
Bile salt flux was manipulated by dietary supplementation with taurocholate (0.5% w/w) or cholestyramine (2% w/w) or by disruption of the cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase-gene (Cyp7A(-/-) mice) leading to reduced bile salt pool size. Expression of hepatic transporters was assessed (polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry).
Biliary bile salt secretion was increased (+350%) or decreased (-50%) after taurocholate or cholestyramine feeding, respectively, but plasma bile salt concentrations and hepatic Fxr expression were not affected. The bile salt uptake system Na(+)-taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (Ntcp) and organic anion transporting polypeptide-1 (Oatp1) were down-regulated by taurocholate and not affected by cholestyramine feeding. Cyp7A(-/-) mice did not show altered Ntcp or Oatp1 expression. Canalicular bile salt export pump (Bsep) was up-regulated by 65% in taurocholate-fed mice, and slightly down-regulated in Cyp7A(-/-) mice.
Large variations in hepatic bile salt flux have minor effects on expression of murine Ntcp and Bsep in vivo, suggesting that these transporters are abundantly expressed and able to accommodate a wide range of 'physiological' bile salt fluxes.
Two ATP-binding cassette transporter proteins, ABCA1 and ABCG1, may mediate an active efflux of cellular cholesterol and phospholipids. They are ubiquitously expressed and are subject to regulation by cholesterol loading or by treatment with agents that activate the nuclear hormone receptor LXR. Earlier studies in both primates and non-primates reported that treatment with endotoxin (bacterial lipopolysaccharide, LPS) reduces plasma levels of HDL cholesterol. To determine if such HDL reduction correlates with a change in ABCA1 or ABCG1 expression, their expressions were measured in THP-1 monocytes and mice treated with LPS. LPS treatment leads to a rapid, dose-dependent increase of ABCA1 but not ABCG1 mRNA expression. Analysis of mouse livers showed that LPS treatment decreases expression of CYP7A, another target gene of LXR. When THP-1 cells were transfected with the ABCA1 promoter construct (-928 to +101 bp), promoter activity was significantly increased by treatment of 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol but not by LPS. Together, these studies show that LPS regulates ABCA1 expression through an LXR-independent mechanism. Further studies showed that treatment with Rhodobacter sphaeroiders LPS, an LPS antagonist, or PD169316, a specific p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, prevented the induction of ABCA1 by LPS. Therefore, this suggests that both transport of LPS from the plasma membrane to an intracellular site and activation of p38 MAP kinase are involved in the LPS-mediated induction of ABCA1.
Unlike macrophages, the hepatic parenchymal cells express cholesterol-7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) which regulates the conversion of cholesterol into bile acids, the major quantitative pathway maintaining cholesterol homeostasis. We examined if CYP7A1 expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages could prevent the accumulation of cholesterol when they were incubated with acetyl-LDL. A single cell clone (designated as 7 alphaRAW cells) that stably expresses rat CYP7A1 displayed similar rates of growth as non-transfected RAW cells. The CYP7A1 enzymatic activity expressed by microsomes obtained from 7 alphaRAW cells was similar to that expressed by microsomes obtained from mouse liver. Incubating non-transfected RAW with increasing amounts of acetyl-LDL caused a parallel accumulation of cholesterol, whereas 7 alphaRAW cells displayed a complete resistance to cholesterol accumulation. 7 alphaRAW cells displayed increased expression of both ABCA1 mRNA (3.1-fold, P &lt; 0.001) and ABCG1 mRNA (2.2-fold, P &lt; 0.01), whereas the expression of scavenger receptor class A mRNA was unchanged. 7 alphaRAW cells also displayed small but significant increases in the rate of efflux of [(3)H]cholesterol to both delipidated apolipoprotein A1 and to HDL.Thus, CYP7A1 expression in RAW cultured macrophages prevented the accumulation of cholesterol from acetyl-LDL via both increased metabolism and efflux of cholesterol.
The orphan nuclear hormone receptor liver receptor homologous protein-1 (LRH-1; NR5A2, also known as FTF), an unusual receptor that binds DNA as a monomer, is an essential regulator of expression of a rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid formation, cholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase. In a classic negative feedback loop that is a crucial component of the complex regulation of cholesterol metabolism, cholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase expression is decreased when bile acid levels are high. This repression is thought to be based on the bile acid-dependent induction of expression of the orphan receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP) NR0B2, which inhibits the activity of LRH-1. We have explored the molecular basis for this important regulatory effect by characterizing the mechanisms by which mouse and human SHP inhibit LRH-1-mediated transactivation. Both SHP proteins specifically interact with the AF-2 transactivation domain of LRH-1 both in vivo and in vitro. This domain is a common target for coactivator interaction, and the SHP proteins can compete with p160 coactivators for binding to LRH-1. In addition to the N-terminal receptor interaction domain, SHP includes a C-terminal domain with autonomous repression function. Neither a deletion nor a point mutation specifically affecting this domain blocked the ability to interact with LRH-1 to compete for coactivator binding or to repress LRH-1 transactivation. However, the relative ability of these mutants to inhibit LRH-1-mediated transactivation was markedly decreased. We conclude that the proposed central role of SHP in cholesterol metabolism is based on a two-step mechanism that is dependent on both coactivator competition and direct transcriptional repression.
Cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the classic pathway of hepatic bile acid biosynthesis from cholesterol. During fasting and in type I diabetes, elevated levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) induce expression of the Cyp7A1 gene and overexpression of PGC-1alpha in hepatoma cells stimulates bile acid synthesis. Using Ad-PGC-1alpha-RNA interference to induce acute disruption of PGC-1alpha in mice, here we show that PGC-1alpha is necessary for fasting-mediated induction of CYP7A1. Co-immunoprecipitation and promoter activation studies reveal that the induction of CYP7A1 is mediated by direct interaction between PGC-1alpha and the AF2 domain of liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1). In contrast, the very similar PGC-1beta could not substitute for PGC-1alpha. We also show that transactivation of PGC-1alpha and LRH-1 is repressed by the small heterodimer partner (SHP). Treatment of mice with GW4064, a synthetic agonist for farnesoid X receptor, induced SHP expression and decreased both the recruitment of PGC-1alpha to the Cyp7A1 promoter and the fasting-induced expression of CYP7A1 mRNA. These data suggest that PGC-1alpha is an important co-activator for LRH-1 and that SHP targets the interaction between LRH-1 and PGC-1alpha to inhibit CYP7A1 expression. Overall, these studies provide further evidence for the important role of PGC-1alpha in bile acid homeostasis and suggest that pharmacological targeting of farnesoid X receptor in vivo can be used to reverse the increase in CYP7A1 associated with adverse metabolic conditions.
Literature suggests that glucocorticoid (GC) exposure during early life may have long-term consequences into adult life. GCs are known to influence hepatic bile acid synthesis and their transport within the enterohepatic circulation. This study addresses effects of early postnatal exposure to GC on hepatic expression of key genes in bile acid metabolism and bile acid kinetics in adult rats. Male rats were treated with either dexamethasone (DEX) or saline at days 1-3 d after birth. Liver tissue and blood were collected from 2 d to 50 wk of age. Bile acid kinetics were determined at week 8. DEX acutely induced hepatic mRNA levels of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1), cholesterol 27-hydroxylase (Cyp27), and in particular sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase (Cyp8b1), whereas expression of the bile acid transporters bile salt export pump (Bsep) and sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (Ntcp) was moderately affected. Neonatal DEX administration led to increased bilary lipid secretion, decreased Cyp8B1 mRNA expression and a 3-fold higher Cyp7a1/Cyp8b1 mRNA ratio in rats at week 8 compared with age-matched controls without alterations in bile acid kinetics. Therefore, neonatal DEX administration causes altered gene expressions later in life that are not translated into quantitative changes in bile acid kinetics.
Maximal bile acid secretory rates and expression of bile acid transporters in liver and ileum are increased in lactation, possibly to facilitate increased enterohepatic recirculation of bile acids. We determined changes in the size and composition of the bile acid pool and key enzymes of the bile acid synthetic pathway [cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1), sterol 27-hydroxylase (Cyp27a1), and sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase (Cyp8b1)] in lactating rats relative to female virgin controls. The bile acid pool increased 1.9 to 2.5-fold [postpartum (PP) days 10, 14, and 19-23], compared with controls. A 1.5-fold increase in cholic acids and a 14 to 20% decrease in muricholic acids in lactation significantly increased the hydrophobicity index. In contrast, the hepatic concentration of bile acids and small heterodimer partner mRNA were unchanged in lactation. A 2.8-fold increase in Cyp7a1 mRNA expression at 16 h (10 h of light) demonstrated a shift in the diurnal rhythm at day 10 PP; Cyp7a1 protein expression and cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase activity were significantly increased at this time and remained elevated at day 14 PP but decreased to control levels by day 21 PP. There was an overall decrease in Cyp27a1 mRNA expression and a 20% decrease in Cyp27a1 protein expression, but there was no change in Cyp8b1 mRNA or protein expression at day 10 PP. The increase in Cyp7a1 expression PP provides a mechanism for the increase in the bile acid pool.
The metabolic conversion of cholesterol into bile acids in liver is initiated by the rate-limiting cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), whereas the bile salt export pump (BSEP) is responsible for the canalicular secretion of bile acids. Liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1) is a key transcriptional factor required for the hepatic expression of CYP7A1. We hypothesized that LRH-1 was also involved in the transcriptional regulation of BSEP. In support of our hypothesis, we found that overexpression of LRH-1 induced, whereas knockdown of LRH-1 decreased, BSEP expression. Consistent with its role in transcriptional regulation, LRH-1 dose-dependently transactivated the BSEP promoter. In addition, such transactivation by LRH-1 was required for maximal induction of BSEP expression through the bile acid/farnesoid X receptor (FXR) activation pathway. Bioinformatic and mutational analysis led to the identification of a functional liver receptor homolog 1-responsive element (LRHRE) in the BSEP promoter. Specific binding of LRH-1 to the LRHRE and recruitment of LRH-1 to the BSEP promoter were demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, respectively. In conclusion, LRH-1 transcriptionally activated the BSEP promoter and functioned as a modulator in bile acid/FXR-mediated BSEP regulation. These results suggest that LRH-1 plays a supporting role to FXR in maintaining hepatic bile acid levels by coordinately regulating CYP7A1 and BSEP for bile acid synthesis and elimination, respectively.
Androgens increase muscle mass, decrease fat mass, and reduce high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), but the relationship between body composition, lipoprotein metabolism, and androgens has not been explained. Here we treated ovariectomized cynomolgus monkeys with 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or vehicle for 14 d and measured lipoprotein and triglycerides. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis revealed that DHT dose-dependently reduced the cholesterol content of large HDL particles and decreased mean HDL particle size (P &lt; 0.01) and also tended to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol without altering other lipoprotein particles. Liver and visceral fat biopsies taken before and after DHT treatment for 1 or 14 d were analyzed by genome-wide microarrays. In liver, DHT did not alter the expression of most genes involved in cholesterol synthesis or uptake but rapidly increased small heterodimer partner (SHP) RNA, along with concomitant repression of CYP7A1, a target of SHP transcriptional repression and the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis. DHT regulation of SHP and CYP7A1 also occurs in rats, indicating a conserved mechanism. In adipose tissue, pathway analyses suggested coordinate regulation of adipogenesis, tissue remodeling, and lipid homeostasis. Genes encoding IGF-I and beta-catenin were induced, as were extracellular matrix, cell adhesion, and cytoskeletal components, whereas there was consistent down-regulation of genes involved in triacylglycerol metabolism. Interestingly, cholesterol ester transfer protein RNA was induced rapidly in monkey adipose tissue, whereas its inhibitor apolipoprotein CI was repressed. These data provide insight into the androgenic regulation of lipoprotein homeostasis and suggest that changes in adipose lipoprotein metabolism could contribute to HDL cholesterol reduction.
Paraoxonase-1 (PON1), an enzyme that metabolizes organophosphate insecticides, is secreted by the liver and transported in the blood complexed to HDL. In humans and mice, low plasma levels of PON1 have also been linked to the development of atherosclerosis. We previously reported that hepatic Pon1 expression was decreased when C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet supplemented with cholic acid (CA). In the current study, we used wild-type and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) null mice to demonstrate that this repression is dependent upon CA and FXR. PON1 mRNA levels were also repressed when HepG2 cells, derived from a human hepatoma, were incubated with natural or highly specific synthetic FXR agonists. In contrast, fibroblast growth factor-19 (FGF-19) mRNA levels were greatly induced by these same FXR agonists. Furthermore, treatment of HepG2 cells with recombinant human FGF-19 significantly decreased PON1 mRNA levels. Finally, deletion studies revealed that the proximal -230 to -96 bp region of the PON1 promoter contains regulatory element(s) necessary for promoter activity and bile acid repression. These data demonstrate that human PON1 expression is repressed by bile acids through the actions of FXR and FGF-19.
As previously reported by us, mice with targeted disruption of the CYP8B1 gene (CYP8B1-/-) fail to produce cholic acid (CA), upregulate their bile acid synthesis, reduce the absorption of dietary cholesterol and, after cholesterol feeding, accumulate less liver cholesterol than wild-type (CYP8B1+/+) mice. In the present study, cholesterol-enriched diet (0.5%) or administration of a synthetic liver X receptor (LXR) agonist strongly upregulated CYP7A1 expression in CYP8B1-/- mice, compared to CYP8B1+/+ mice. Cholesterol-fed CYP8B1-/- mice also showed a significant rise in HDL cholesterol and increased levels of liver ABCA1 mRNA. A combined CA (0.25%)/cholesterol (0.5%) diet enhanced absorption of intestinal cholesterol in both groups of mice, increased their liver cholesterol content, and reduced their expression of CYP7A1 mRNA. The ABCG5/G8 liver mRNA was increased in both groups of mice, but cholesterol crystals were only observed in bile from the CYP8B1+/+ mice. The results demonstrate the cholesterol-sparing effects of CA: enhanced absorption and reduced conversion into bile acids. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-mediated suppression of CYP7A1 in mice seems to be a predominant mechanism for regulation of bile acid synthesis under normal conditions and, as confirmed, able to override LXR-mediated mechanisms. Interaction between FXR- and LXR-mediated stimuli might also regulate expression of liver ABCG5/G8.
The gene encoding cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) is tightly regulated in order to control intrahepatic cholesterol and bile acid levels. Ligands of the xenobiotic-sensing pregnane X receptor inhibit CYP7A1 expression. To retrace the evolution of the molecular mechanisms underlying CYP7A1 inhibition, we used a chicken hepatoma cell system that retains the ability to be induced by phenobarbital and other drugs. Whereas bile acids regulate CYP7A1 via small heterodimer partner and liver receptor homolog-1, mRNA expression of these nuclear receptors is unchanged by xenobiotics. Instead, drugs repress chicken hepatic nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha) transcript levels concomitant with a reduction in CYP7A1 expression. Importantly, no reduction of HNF4alpha levels is found in mouse liver in vivo and in human primary hepatocyte cultures, respectively. Thus, besides the importance of HNF4alpha in CYP7A1 regulation in all species, birds and mammals use different signaling pathways to adjust CYP7A1 levels after exposure to xenobiotics.
Although the anti-inflammatory effect of interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) has been described, the contribution of this cytokine to cholesterol metabolism remains unclear. Our aim was to ascertain whether deficiency of IL-1Ra deteriorates cholesterol metabolism upon consumption of an atherogenic diet. IL-1Ra-deficient mice (IL-1Ra(-/-)) showed severe fatty liver and portal fibrosis containing many inflammatory cells following 20 weeks of an atherogenic diet when compared with wild type (WT) mice. Expectedly, the levels of total cholesterol in IL-1Ra(-/-) mice were significantly increased, and the start of lipid accumulation in liver was observed earlier when compared with WT mice. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that IL-1Ra(-/-) mice failed to induce mRNA expression of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis, with concurrent up-regulation of small heterodimer partner 1 mRNA expression. Indeed, IL-1Ra(-/-) mice showed markedly decreased bile acid excretion, which is elevated in WT mice to maintain cholesterol level under atherogenic diet feeding. Therefore, we conclude that the lack of IL-1Ra deteriorates cholesterol homeostasis under atherogenic diet-induced inflammation.
Previous studies show that feedback inhibition of bile acid production by bile acids is mediated by multiple mechanisms, including activation of pregnane X receptor (PXR). Consistent with these studies, the antibiotic rifampicin, a ligand for human PXR, reduces hepatic bile acid levels in cholestasis patients. To delineate the mechanisms underlying PXR-mediated suppression of bile acid biosynthesis, we examined the functional cross-talk between human PXR and HNF-4, a key hepatic activator of genes involved in bile acid biosynthesis including the cholesterol 7-alpha hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and sterol 12-alpha hydroxylase (CYP8B1) genes. Treatment with rifampicin resulted in repression of endogenous human CYP7A1 expression in HepG2 cells that was reversed by PXR small interfering RNA. The coactivator PGC-1 enhanced transcriptional activity of HNF-4, and this enhancement was suppressed by rifampicin-activated PXR. Endogenous PGC-1 from mouse liver extracts bound to PXR, and recombinant PGC-1 directly interacted with both PXR and HNF-4 in vitro. Rifampicin-dependent interaction of PXR with PGC-1 was shown in cells by coimmunoprecipitation, and intranuclear localization studies using confocal microscopy provided further evidence for this interaction. In chromatin immunoprecipitation studies, rifampicin treatment did not inhibit HNF-4 binding to the native promoters of CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 but resulted in dissociation of PGC-1 and concomitant gene repression. Most interestingly, these rifampicin effects were also observed in the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene that contains a functional HNF-4-binding site and is central to hepatic gluconeogenesis. Our study suggests that ligand-activated PXR interferes with HNF-4 signaling by targeting the common coactivator PGC-1, which underlies physiologically relevant inhibitory cross-talk between drug metabolism and cholesterol/glucose metabolism.
The orphan receptor SHP interacts with many nuclear receptors and inhibits their transcriptional activities. SHP is central to feedback repression of cholesterol 7alpha hydroxylase gene (CYP7A1) expression by bile acids, which is critical for maintaining cholesterol homeostasis. Using CYP7A1 as a model system, we studied the molecular mechanisms of SHP repression at the level of native chromatin. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies showed that mSin3A and a Swi/Snf complex containing Brm as a central ATPase were recruited to the promoter. This recruitment was associated with chromatin remodeling after bile acid treatment that was blunted by inhibition of the endogenous Swi/Snf function by dominant-negative ATPase mutants. Biochemical studies indicated that SHP was associated with the mSin3A-Swi/Snf complex by direct interaction with Brm and mSin3A through its repression domain. Expression of Brm, but not an ATPase mutant, inhibited CYP7A1 promoter activity and further enhanced SHP-mediated repression. Bile acid-induced recruitment of mSin3A/Brm, chromatin remodeling, and concomitant repression of endogenous CYP7A1 expression were impaired when SHP expression was inhibited by SHP small interfering RNA. Our results suggest that SHP mediates recruitment of mSin3A-Swi/Snf to the CYP7A1 promoter, resulting in chromatin remodeling and gene repression, which may also be a mechanism for the repression by SHP of genes activated by many nuclear receptors. Our study establishes the first link between a Swi/Snf complex and regulation of cholesterol metabolism.
Cholesterol excretion by ATP binding cassette transporters G5 and G8 (ABCG5/G8) and bile acid biosynthesis by cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) are major pathways for the removal of cholesterol into bile. To investigate the interactions between common polymorphisms in ABCG5/G8 and CYP7A1 and statin response, we examined the relationships between five non-synonymous polymorphisms in ABCG5/G8 (Q604E, D19H, Y54C, T400K, and A632V) and a promoter variant in CYP7A1 (A-204C) in 337 hypercholesterolemic patients treated with atorvastatin 10mg. The ABCG8 H19 allele was significantly associated with a greater LDL cholesterol reduction relative to the wild type D19 allele (39.6% versus 36.6%, P = 0.043). This difference was enhanced in non-carriers of the CYP7A1 promoter polymorphism (42.7% versus 38.2%, P = 0.048), and was diminished in accordance with the number of CYP7A1 variant alleles (1.8% in heterozygotes and 0.2% in homozygotes). Combination analysis of these polymorphisms explained a greater percentage of LDL cholesterol response variation (8.5% difference across subgroups) than did single polymorphism analysis (4.2% in CYP7A1 and 3.0% in ABCG8 D19H). The other ABCG5/G8 polymorphisms did not show any significant interactions with the CYP7A1 polymorphism. We conclude that the ABCG8 H19 and CYP7A1 C-204 alleles appear to interact in a dose-dependent manner on atorvastatin response.
β-Glucan, a soluble fiber with viscous property, has a documented cholesterol-lowering effect. The molecular weight (MW) of β-glucan, which contributes to viscosity, and an individual's genotype might influence the cholesterol-lowering efficacy of β-glucan.
This study was designed to determine whether the cholesterol-lowering efficacy of barley β-glucan varied as a function of MW and the daily dose consumed. Our second aim was to determine whether any gene-diet interactions are associated with the cholesterol-lowering efficacy of β-glucan.
In a randomized controlled crossover trial, 30 mildly hypercholesterolemic adults [12 men and 18 women, aged 27-78 y; body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 20-40; total cholesterol (TC): 5.0-8.0 mmol/L; LDL cholesterol: 2.7-5.0 mmol/L] were randomly assigned to receive a breakfast that contained either barley β-glucan at 3 g high MW (HMW)/d, 5 g low MW (LMW)/d, or 3 g LMW/d or a control diet, each for 5 wk. The washout period between the phases was 4 wk. Fasting blood samples were collected at the start and end of each phase for blood lipid analysis and genotyping.
Consumption of 3 g HMW β-glucan/d lowered TC by -0.12 mmol/L (95% CI: -0.24, -0.006 mmol/L) compared with the control diet (P= 0.0046), but the LMW β-glucan, at either 3 g/d or 5 g/d, did not change serum cholesterol concentrations. This effect of HMW β-glucan was associated with gene-diet interaction, whereby individuals with the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3808607-G allele (GG or GT) of the cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily A member 1 gene (CYP7A1) had greater responses to 3 g HMW β-glucan/d in lowering TC than TT carriers (P= 0.0006).
The HMW β-glucan rather than LMW β-glucan reduced circulating TC effectively in mildly hypercholesterolemic adults. The cholesterol-lowering effect of β-glucan may also be determined by the genetic characteristics of an individual. These data show that individuals carrying theCYP7A1SNP rs3808607-G allele are more responsive to the cholesterol-lowering effect of β-glucan with HMW than TT carriers. This trial was registered atclinicaltrials.govasNCT01408719.
Quercetin, a common member of the flavonoid family, is widely present in plant kingdom. Despite that quercetin is implicated in regulating cholesterol metabolism, the molecular mechanism is poorly understood. We hypothesized that quercetin regulates cholesterol homeostasis through regulating the key enzymes involved in hepatic cholesterol metabolism. To test this hypothesis, we compared the profile of key enzymes and transcription factors involved in the hepatic cholesterol metabolism in rats with or without quercetin supplementation. Twenty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into control and quercetin-supplemented groups. Serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and total bile acids in feces and bile were measured. Hepatic enzymatic activities were determined by activity assay kit and high-performance liquid chromatography-based analyses. The messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expressions were determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses, respectively. The results showed that the activity of hepatic cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, a critical enzyme in the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids, was significantly elevated by quercetin. The expression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, as well as liver X receptor α, an important transcription factor, was also increased at both mRNA and protein levels by quercetin. However, quercetin exposure had no impact on the activity of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of cholesterol. We also found that quercetin treatment significantly increased ATP binding cassette transporter G1 mRNA and protein expression in the liver, suggesting that quercetin may increase hepatic cholesterol efflux. Collectively, the results presented here indicate that quercetin regulates hepatic cholesterol metabolism mainly through the pathways that promote cholesterol-to-bile acid conversion and cholesterol efflux. 
27-Hydroxycholesterol (27OH) is a strong suppressor of cholesterol synthesis and a weak activator of LXR in vitro. The regulatory importance of 27OH in vivo is controversial. Here we utilized male mice with increased levels of 27OH either due to increased production (CYP27A1 transgenic mice) or reduced metabolism (Cyp7b1-/- mice). We also used mice lacking 27OH due to a knockout of Cyp27a1. The latter mice were treated with cholic acid to compensate for reduced bile acid synthesis. The effects of the different levels of 27OH on Srebp- and other LXR-regulated genes in the liver were investigated. In the liver of CYP27tg mice we found a modest increase of the mRNA levels corresponding to the LXR target genes Cyp7b1 and Abca1. A number of other LXR-regulated genes were not affected. The effect on Abca1 mRNA was not seen in the liver of Cyp7b1-/- mice. There were little or no effects on cholesterol synthesis. In the liver of the Cyp27-/- mice treated with 0.025% cholic acid there was no significant effect of the knockout on the LXR target genes. In a previous work triple-knockout mice deficient in the biosynthesis of 24S-hydroxycholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol and 27OH were shown to have impaired response to dietary cholesterol, suggesting side-chain oxidized oxysterols to be mediators in cholesterol-induced effects on LXR target genes at a transcriptional level (Chen W. et al., Cell Metab. 5 (2007) 73-79). The hydroxylated oxysterol responsible for the effect was not defined. We show here that treatment of wildtype mice with dietary cholesterol under the same conditions as in the above study induced the LXR target genes Lpl, Abcg8 and Srebp1c in wild type mice but failed to activate the same genes in mice lacking 27-hydroxycholesterol due to a knockout of Cyp27. We failed to demonstrate the above effects at the protein level (Abcg8) or at the activity level (Lpl). The results suggest that 27OH is not an important regulator of Srebp- or LXR regulated genes under basal conditions in mouse liver. On the other hand 27OH appears to mediate cholesterol-induced effects on some LXR target genes at a transcriptional level under some in vivo conditions.
Liver cells experience hypoxic stress when drug-metabolizing enzymes excessively consume O2 for hydroxylation. Hypoxic stress changes the transcription of several genes by activating a heterodimeric transcription factor called hypoxia-inducible factor- 1α/β (HIF-1α/β). We found that hypoxic stress (0.1% O2) decreased the expression of cytochrome P450 7A1 (CYP7A1), a rate-limiting enzyme involved in bile acid biosynthesis. Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), a major component of bile acids, represses CYP7A1 by activating a transcriptional repressor named small heterodimer partner (SHP). We observed that hypoxia decreased the levels of both CDCA and SHP, suggesting that hypoxia repressed CYP7A1 without inducing SHP. The finding that overexpression of HIF-1α increased the activity of the CYP7A1 promoter suggested that hypoxia decreased the expression of CYP7A1 in a HIF-1-independent manner. Thus, the results of this study suggested that hypoxia decreased the activity of CYP7A1 by limiting its substrate O2, and by decreasing the transcription of CYP7A1. [BMB Reports 2016; 49(3): 173-178]. 
Bile acids are primarily synthesized from cholesterol in the liver and have important roles in dietary lipid absorption and cholesterol homoeostasis. Detailed roles of the orphan nuclear receptors regulating cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis, have not yet been fully elucidated. In the present study, we report that oestrogen-related receptor γ (ERRγ) is a novel transcriptional regulator of CYP7A1 expression. Activation of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1 receptor) signalling induced ERRγ-mediated transcription of the CYP7A1 gene. Overexpression of ERRγ increased CYP7A1 expression in vitro and in vivo, whereas knockdown of ERRγ attenuated CYP7A1 expression. Deletion analysis of the CYP7A1 gene promoter and a ChIP assay revealed an ERRγ-binding site on the CYP7A1 gene promoter. Small heterodimer partner (SHP) inhibited the transcriptional activity of ERRγ and thus regulated CYP7A1 expression. Overexpression of ERRγ led to increased bile acid levels, whereas an inverse agonist of ERRγ, GSK5182, reduced CYP7A1 expression and bile acid synthesis. Finally, GSK5182 significantly reduced hepatic CB1 receptor-mediated induction of CYP7A1 expression and bile acid synthesis in alcohol-treated mice. These results provide the molecular mechanism linking ERRγ and bile acid metabolism.
We have previously observed that knockout of Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), a cholesterol transporter essential for intestinal cholesterol absorption, reduces the output of dry stool in mice. As the food intake remains unaltered in NPC1L1-knockout (L1-KO) mice, we hypothesized that NPC1L1 deficiency may alter the gut microbiome to reduce stool output. Consistently, here we demonstrate that the phyla of fecal microbiota differ substantially between L1-KO mice and their wild-type controls. Germ-free (GF) mice have reduced stool output. Inhibition of NPC1L1 by its inhibitor ezetimibe reduces stool output in specific pathogen-free (SPF), but not GF mice. In addition, we show that GF versus SPF mice have reduced intestinal absorption and increased fecal excretion of cholesterol, particularly after treatment with ezetimibe. This negative balance of cholesterol in GF mice is associated with reduced plasma and hepatic cholesterol, and likely caused by reduced expression of NPC1L1 and increased expression of ABCG5 and ABCG8 in small intestine. Expression levels of other genes in intestine and liver largely reflect a state of cholesterol depletion and a decrease in intestinal sensing of bile acids. Altogether, our findings reveal a broad role of microbiota in regulating whole-body cholesterol homeostasis and its response to a cholesterol-lowering drug, ezetimibe. 
Kaempferol is a dietary flavonol previously shown to regulate cellular lipid and glucose metabolism. However, its molecular mechanisms of action and target proteins have remained elusive, probably due to the involvement of multiple proteins. This study investigated the molecular targets of kaempferol. Ligand binding of kaempferol to liver X receptors (LXRs) was quantified by time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer and surface plasmon resonance analyses. Kaempferol directly binds to and induces the transactivation of LXRs, with stronger specificity for the β-subtype (EC50 = 0.33 μM). The oral administration of kaempferol in apolipoprotein-E-deficient mice (150 mg/day/kg body weight) significantly reduced plasma glucose and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and insulin sensitivity compared with the vehicle-fed control. Kaempferol also reduced plasma triglyceride concentrations and did not cause liver steatosis, a common side effect of potent LXR activation. In immunoblotting analysis, kaempferol reduced the nuclear accumulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1). Our results show that the suppression of SREBP-1 activity and the selectivity for LXR-β over LXR-α by kaempferol contribute to the reductions of plasma and hepatic triglyceride concentrations in mice fed kaempferol. They also suggest that kaempferol activates LXR-β and suppresses SREBP-1 to enhance symptoms in metabolic syndrome.
The histone H3-lysine-4 methyltransferase mixed-lineage leukemia 3 (MLL3) and its closest homolog, MLL4 (aka KMT2D), belong to two homologous transcriptional coactivator complexes, named MLL3 and MLL4 complexes, respectively. MLL3 plays crucial roles in multiple metabolic processes. However, the physiological roles of MLL4 in metabolism and the relationship between MLL3 and MLL4 in metabolic gene regulation are unclear. To address these issues, we analyzed the phenotypes of newly generated MLL4 mutant mice, along with MLL3 mutant and MLL3;MLL4 compound mutant mice. We also performed comparative genome-wide transcriptome analyses in livers of MLL3, MLL4, and MLL3;MLL4 mutant mice. These analyses revealed that MLL3 and MLL4 complexes are key epigenetic regulators of common metabolic processes and the hepatic circadian clock. Subsequent mechanistic analyses uncovered that MLL3/4 complexes function as pivotal coactivators of the circadian transcription factors (TFs), retinoid-related orphan receptor (ROR)-α and -γ, in the hepatic circadian clock. Consistent with disturbed hepatic clock gene expression in MLL4 mutant mice, we found that rhythmic fluctuation of hepatic and serum bile acid (BA) levels over the circadian cycle is abolished in MLL4 mutant mice. Our analyses also demonstrate that MLL4 primarily impinges on hepatic BA production among several regulatory pathways to control BA homeostasis. Together, our results provide strong in vivo support for important roles of both MLL3 and MLL4 in similar metabolic pathways.
Both MLL3 and MLL4 complexes act as major epigenetic regulators of diverse metabolic processes (including circadian control of bile acid homeostasis) and as critical transcriptional coactivators of the circadian TFs, RORs.
Statins are effective cholesterol-lowering drugs to treat CVDs. Bile acids (BAs), the end products of cholesterol metabolism in the liver, are important nutrient and energy regulators. The present study aims to investigate how statins affect BA homeostasis in the enterohepatic circulation. Male C57BL/6 mice were treated with atorvastatin (100 mg/kg/day po) for 1 week, followed by BA profiling by ultra-performance LC-MS/MS. Atorvastatin decreased BA pool size, mainly due to less BA in the intestine. Surprisingly, atorvastatin did not alter total BAs in the serum or liver. Atorvastatin increased the ratio of 12α-OH/non12α-OH BAs. Atorvastatin increased the mRNAs of the BA-synthetic enzymes cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1) (over 10-fold) and cytochrome P450 27a1, the BA uptake transporters Na⁺/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide and organic anion transporting polypeptide 1b2, and the efflux transporter multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 in the liver. Noticeably, atorvastatin suppressed the expression of BA nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) target genes, namely small heterodimer partner (liver) and fibroblast growth factor 15 (ileum). Furthermore, atorvastatin increased the mRNAs of the organic cation uptake transporter 1 and cholesterol efflux transporters Abcg5 and Abcg8 in the liver. The increased expression of BA-synthetic enzymes and BA transporters appear to be a compensatory response to maintain BA homeostasis after atorvastatin treatment. The Cyp7a1 induction by atorvastatin appears to be due to suppressed FXR signaling in both the liver and intestine.
Bile salts inhibit their own production by inducing the nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP) (encoded by NR0B2), which contributes to repression of the gene encoding cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), a key enzyme for the control of bile salt synthesis. On the other hand, bile salts stimulate hepatic synthesis of nitric oxide. We investigated the role of nitric oxide signaling in the control of CYP7A1 expression and the involvement in this process of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), which participates in intracellular propagation of nitric oxide signals.
We studied the effects of inhibitors of nitric oxide synthesis (L-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester [L-NAME]) or protein nitrosylation (via dithiothreitol) on bile salt homeostasis in male Wistar rats placed on a cholate-rich diet for 5 days and in cultured primary hepatocytes. S-nitrosylation of GAPDH was assessed using a biotin-switch assay. Interacions of SHP with other proteins and with the Cyp7a1 promoter sequence were studied using immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. We reduced the GAPDH levels in H35 cells with small interfering RNAs. GAPDH nitrosylation was assessed in normal and cholestatic rat and human livers.
Rats placed on cholate-rich diets and given L-NAME had increased intrahepatic and biliary levels of bile salts, and deficiency in repression of CYP7A1 (at the messenger RNA and protein levels) in liver tissue, despite preserved induction of SHP. In cultured hepatocytes, L-NAME or dithiothreitol blocked cholate-induced down-regulation of CYP7A1 without impairing SHP up-regulation. In hepatocytes, cholate promoted S-nitrosylation of GAPDH and its translocation to the nucleus, accompanied by S-nitrosylation of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), deacetylases that participate, respectively, in the formation of Cyp7a1 and Shp repressor complexes. Knockdown of GAPDH prevented repression of CYP7A1 by cholate, and blocking nuclear transport of nitrosylated GAPDH reduced cholate-induced nitrosylation of HDAC2 and SIRT1; this effect was accompanied by abrogation of Cyp7a1 repression. Cholate induced binding of SHP to HDAC2 and its recruitment to the Cyp7a1 promoter; these processes were inhibited by blocking nitric oxide synthesis. Levels of nitrosylated GAPDH and nitrosylated HDAC2 were increased in cholestatic human and rat livers reflecting increased concentrations of bile salts in these conditions.
In rat liver, excess levels of bile salts activate a GAPDH-mediated transnitrosylation cascade that provides feedback inhibition of bile salt synthesis.
Bile acids or its derivatives may influence non-alcoholic fatty liver disease development through multiple mechanisms. Intestinal L-cells secrete glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and can be activated by bile acids (BA) influencing insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis development and progression. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of cholic acid (CA) or ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) administration on portal and systemic levels of GLP-1 in genetically obese mice with established hepatic steatosis. Eight-week-old ob/ob mice were fed CA or UDCA during 4 weeks. Systemic and portal GLP-1 levels were measured as well as glucose tolerance test, serum and biliary parameters, hepatic triglyceride content, liver histology, and hepatic gene expression of relevant genes related to bile secretion. Eight-week-old ob/ob mice exhibited marked obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and fasting hyperglycemia. Administration of both CA and UDCA was associated to decreased hepatic triglyceride content and complete reversion of histological steatosis. BA-fed animals did not exhibit significant differences in glucose tolerance. In addition, neither CA nor UDCA administration significantly influenced portal or systemic GLP-1 levels. CA and UDCA strongly ameliorated established fatty liver in ob/ob mice independently of the GLP-1 incretin pathway. Thus, the anti-steatotic action of these bile acids is likely related to direct hepatic effects. 
Statins are suggested to preserve gallbladder function by suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines and preventing cholesterol accumulation in gallbladder epithelial cells. They also affect cross-talk among the nuclear hormone receptors that regulate cholesterol-bile acid metabolism in the nuclei of hepatocytes. However, there is controversy over whether or how statins change the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)alpha, PPARgamma, liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), ABCG5, ABCG8, and 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) which are directly involved in the cholesterol saturation index in bile.
Human Hep3B cells were cultured on dishes. MTT assays were performed to determine the appropriate concentrations of reagents to be used. The protein expression of PPARalpha and PPARgamma was measured by Western blotting analysis, and the mRNA expression of LXRalpha, FXR, ABCG5, ABCG8 and CYP7A1 was estimated by RT-PCR.
In cultured Hep3B cells, pravastatin activated PPARalpha and PPARgamma protein expression, induced stronger expression of PPARgamma than that of PPARalpha, increased LXRalpha mRNA expression, activated ABCG5 and ABCG8 mRNA expression mediated by FXR as well as LXRalpha, enhanced FXR mRNA expression, and increased CYP7A1 mRNA expression mediated by the PPARgamma and LXRalpha pathways, together or independently.
Our data suggested that pravastatin prevents cholesterol gallstone diseases via the increase of FXR, LXRalpha and CYP7A1 in human hepatocytes.
Little is known about the effects of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) on hepatic activity of human cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and cholesterol metabolism. We studied these processes in mice in vivo and mouse and human hepatocytes.
Farnesoid X receptor (Fxr)(-/-), small heterodimer partner (Shp)(-/-), and C57BL/6 (wild-type control) mice were fed normal or Western diets for 3 weeks and were then given intraperitoneal injections of vehicle (corn oil) or 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25[OH]2D3; 4 doses, 2.5 μg/kg, every other day). Plasma and tissue samples were collected and levels of Vdr, Shp, Cyp7a1, Cyp24a1, and rodent fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) 15 expression, as well as levels of cholesterol, were measured. We studied the regulation of Shp by Vdr using reporter and mobility shift assays in transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells, quantitative polymerase chain reaction with mouse tissues and mouse and human hepatocytes, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with mouse liver.
We first confirmed the presence of Vdr mRNA and protein expression in livers of mice. In mice fed normal diets and given injections of 1,25(OH)2D3, liver and plasma concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D3 increased and decreased in unison. Changes in hepatic Cyp7a1 messenger RNA (mRNA) correlated with those of Cyp24a1 (a Vdr target gene) and inversely with Shp mRNA, but not ileal Fgf15 mRNA. Similarly, incubation with 1,25(OH)2D3 increased levels of Cyp24a1/CYP24A1 and Cyp7a1/CYP7A1 mRNA in mouse and human hepatocytes, and reduced levels of Shp mRNA in mouse hepatocytes. In Fxr(-/-) and wild-type mice with hypercholesterolemia, injection of 1,25(OH)2D3 consistently reduced levels of plasma and liver cholesterol and Shp mRNA, and increased hepatic Cyp7a1 mRNA and protein; these changes were not observed in Shp(-/-) mice given 1,25(OH)2D3 and fed Western diets. Truncation of the human small heterodimer partner (SHP) promoter and deletion analyses revealed VDR-dependent inhibition of SHP, and mobility shift assays showed direct binding of VDR to enhancer regions of SHP. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of livers from mice showed that injection of 1,25(OH)2D3 increased recruitment of Vdr and rodent retinoid X receptor to the Shp promoter.
Activation of the VDR represses hepatic SHP to increase levels of mouse and human CYP7A1 and reduce cholesterol.
We aimed to elucidate the mechanism underlying the anti-dyslipidemic effect of compound-T3, a farnesoid X receptor antagonist, by investigating its effects on hepatic lipid metabolism in non-human primates. We administered lipid-lowering drugs for 7 days to cynomolgus monkeys receiving a high-fat diet, and subsequently measured the levels of lipid parameters in plasma, feces, and hepatic tissue fluids. Compound-T3 (0.3 and 3mg/kg p.o.) significantly decreased the plasma levels of non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein B in a dose-dependent manner. It also decreased the mRNA levels of hepatic small heterodimer partner-1, induced the mRNA expression of hepatic cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, reduced hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride levels, increased fecal bile acid excretion, and upregulated the expression of hepatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. Furthermore, compound-T3 significantly increased plasma HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I levels. The mRNA expression levels of hepatic apolipoprotein A-I tended to increase after compound-T3 treatment. Compound-T3 also induced accumulation of hepatic bile acids and decreased the mRNA expression levels of the hepatic bile acid export pump. The effects of cholestyramine (300mg/kg p.o.) on the plasma and hepatic lipid parameters were similar to those of compound-T3, and it increased fecal bile acid levels without causing accumulation of hepatic bile acids. These findings suggest that LDL receptor-mediated hepatic LDL incorporation due to cholesterol catabolism catalyzed by cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase decreases plasma non-HDL cholesterol levels. Upregulation of hepatic apolipoprotein A-I mRNA expression may partially contribute to the increase in HDL cholesterol levels mediated by compound-T3. 
Inflammation is a major contributor to the development of atherosclerotic plaque, yet the involvement of liver and visceral adipose tissue inflammatory status in atherosclerotic lesion development has yet to be fully elucidated. We hypothesized that an atherogenic diet would increase inflammatory response and lipid accumulation in the liver and gonadal adipose tissue (GAT) and would correlate with systemic inflammation and aortic lesion formation in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor null (LDLr-/-) mice. For 32 weeks, LDLr-/- mice (n = 10/group) were fed either an atherogenic (high saturated fat and cholesterol) or control (low fat and cholesterol) diet. Hepatic and GAT lipid content and expression of inflammatory factors were measured using standard procedures. Compared with the control diet, the atherogenic diet significantly increased hepatic triglyceride and total cholesterol (TC), primarily esterified cholesterol, and GAT triglyceride content. These changes were accompanied by increased expression of acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 5, CD36, ATP-binding cassette, subfamily A, member 1 and scavenger receptor B class 1, and they decreased the expression of cytochrome P450, family 7 and subfamily a, polypeptide 1 in GAT. Aortic TC content was positively associated with hepatic TC, triglyceride, and GAT triglyceride contents as well as plasma interleukin 6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 concentrations. Although when compared with the control diet, the atherogenic diet increased hepatic tumor necrosis factor α production, they were not associated with aortic TC content. These data suggest that the LDLr-/- mice responded to the atherogenic diet by increasing lipid accumulation in the liver and GAT, which may have increased inflammatory response. Aortic TC content was positively associated with systemic inflammation but not hepatic and GAT inflammatory status. 
Small heterodimer partner (SHP) is involved in bile, lipid, and glucose metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of SHP on the development of atherosclerosis. Apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE-/-) mice were crossed with SHP knockout (SHP-/-) mice to generate double knockout (ApoE-/-SHP-/-) mice. ApoE-/- and ApoE-/-SHP-/- male mice were fed a western diet for 20 weeks. Body weight in ApoE-/-SHP-/) mice was significantly lower than that in ApoE-/- mice (37±1 g vs. 42±1 g, p&lt;0.01). Loss of SHP in ApoE-/- mice decreased the size of adipocytes in white adipose tissue and reduced lipid accumulation in the liver. Glucose intolerance was improved in ApoE-/-SHP-/- mice as compared with ApoE-/- mice (p&lt;0.01). There was no statistical difference in non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels between ApoE-/-SHP-/- mice and ApoE-/- mice despite an increase of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase expression in the liver. The proportion of atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta was significantly lower in ApoE-/-SHP-/- mice than in ApoE-/- mice (2.8±2.0% vs. 9.1±1.9%, p&lt;0.01). In conclusion, loss of SHP function can prevent atherosclerosis, and resistance to diet-induced obesity is the primary factor contributing to this protective effect.
15-Deoxy-Δ(12,14)-PGJ2 (15d-PGJ2) is one of the major metabolites from prostaglandin D2 in arachidonic acid (AA) metabolic pathway. It was determined as a ligand of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) functioning potently in adipocyte development. However, the fact that 15d-PGJ2 exerts also PPARγ-independent biological actions has highly addressed its multi-target behavior. Here, we identified that 15d-PGJ2 was an antagonist of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), as investigated by surface plasmon resonance, fluorescence quenching and homo time-resolved fluorescence based analyses, and the coactivator-recruitment and luciferase-reporter related investigation. Assay of 15d-PGJ2 regulation on hFXRα target genes revealed that treatment of HepG2 cells with 15d-PGJ2 resulted in the stimulation of mRNA expressions of bile-salt export pump (BSEP), and the decrease of cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase (CYP7a1). In addition, functional assays indicated that 15d-PGJ2 promoted the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids in HepG2 cells. Moreover, molecular docking combined with molecular dynamics simulation was applied to develop the possible model of 15d-PGJ2 binding to hFXRα ligand binding domain (LBD) at atomic level, and the responsible residues for 15d-PGJ2/hFXRα-LBD interaction were thereby determined, which were further confirmed by SPR assays against hFXRα-LBD site-directed mutations. Given that hFXRα functions potently in the regulation of hepatic bile acid metabolism and lipid/glucose homeostasis, our current work is expected to help better understand the multi-target features of this PGD2 metabolite in biological pathways, and 15d-PGJ2 as a new discovered FXR antagonist might find its potential application in further anti-hypercholesterol research. 
An extract from red ginseng [steamed and dried roots of Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer (RGE)] has been shown to have various actions on physiological functions. The mechanisms by which RGE promotes cholesterol metabolism in the liver are unclear, but RGE decreases the plasma levels of cholesterol. We investigated whether RGE affected the mRNA expression of cholesterol metabolism-related proteins such as cytochrome P450 (CYP)7A1 and bile salt export pump (BSEP) in the liver in hypercholesterolemic rats and rat primary hepatocytes. In-vivo studies showed the upregulation of CYP7A1 mRNA in hypercholesterolemic rats treated with RGE. Treatment with RGE exhibited decreased ratios of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol compared with hypercholesterolemia without RGE. In-vitro studies also showed the upregulation of CYP7A1 mRNA and protein levels by the addition of RGE to rat primary hepatocytes. The mRNA levels of BSEP exhibited few changes. The sustained levels of the liver X receptor (LXR) in vivo and the increased levels of LXR in vitro on RGE treatment could be involved in the upregulation of CYP7A1. To clarify the effects of 11 ginsenosides including RGE on the mRNA levels of CYP7A1 and BSEP, we performed in-vitro experiments using rat primary hepatocytes. The ginsenosides Ro, Rg3, Re, Rg1, and Rg2 exhibited increased mRNA levels of CYP7A1. These results suggest that several ginsenosides including RGE promoted cholesterol metabolism due to upregulation of CYP7A1.
Licorice (LE) has been commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for over 4000 years to reconcile various drugs and for hepatic disorders. Glycyrrhizin is the main bioactive component isolated from LE herbs. In the present study we examined the effects of glycyrrhizin on pregnane X receptor (PXR)-mediated CYP3A expression and its hepatoprotective activity. Treatment of HepG2 cells with glycyrrhizin resulted in marked increase in both CYP3A4 mRNA and protein levels. The transcriptional activation of the CYP3A4 gene through glycyrrhizin is PXR-dependent, as shown in transient transfection experiments. Glycyrrhizin activates the DNA-binding capacity of the PXR for the CYP3A4 element responding to xenobiotic signals, as measured by the electrophoretic-mobility shift assay (EMSA). These results indicate that the induction of the hepatic CYP3A4 by glycyrrhizin is mediated through the activation of PXR. The next aim of the current study was to determine whether the activation of PXR and induction of CYP3A by glycyrrhizin prevents hepatotoxicity during cholestasis as a mechanism of hepatoprotection. Mice were pretreated with glycyrrhizin prior to induction of intrahepatic cholestasis using lithocholic acid (LCA). Pre-treatment with glycyrrhizin, as well as the PXR activator pregnenolone 16α-carbontrile (PCN), prevents the increase in plasma ALT and AST activity, multifocal necrosis and prevents an increase in a level of serum LCA level in mice, as compared with the results in the mice treated with LCA alone. Activation of the PXR by glycyrrhizin results in induction of CYP3A11 (CYP3A4 for human) expression and inhibition of CYP7A1 through an increase in small heterodimer partner (SHP) expression. Glycyrrhizin regulates the expression of the gene mentioned above to prevent toxic accumulation of bile acids in the liver and it also protects mouse livers from the harmful effects of LCA. In conclusion, PXR-mediated effects on CYP3A and CYP7A may contribute to the hepatoprotective property of glycyrrhizin against LCA-induced liver injury.
Rodent obesity models have been shown to display impaired bile secretory functions. We have shown that glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) attenuates hepatic lipogenesis, and in the present study we investigated whether GLP-1 also improves high fat diet-associated cholestatic injury.
Wild type (WT) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4-deficient rats (DPP4-) with chronic elevated serum levels of active GLP-1 were fed regular chow and a Western diet for 2 months. Primary hepatocytes were used to assess GLP-1 effects on mRNA expression and transcription of genes encoding bile acid synthesis enzymes and transporters.
DPP4- exhibited attenuated liver injury as expressed by lower serum AST and ALT after 2 months of a Western diet. In addition, DPP4- had better insulin sensitivity, lower serum triglycerides, cholesterol and bile acids. Hepatic expression of cyp7A1, the rate limiting enzyme in conversion of cholesterol into bile acids, was strongly attenuated in DPP4- fed with a Western diet. Moreover, hepatic expression of bile transporter, ABCB11, was increased, facilitating a higher rate of bile secretion. Mechanistically, we showed that GLP-1 directly reduced basal and LXR-induced cyp7A1 mRNA expression and suppressed cyp7A1 transcription in transient transfection assays in primary hepatocytes. However, GLP-1 and its analog exendin 4 also induced mRNA expression of bile acid transporter ABCC3 in primary rat hepatocyte cultures.
Our data suggest that GLP-1 analogs may serve as a novel therapeutic drug to alleviate obesity-induced liver injury by reducing bile acid synthesis and improving liver bile secretory function.
Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) is the initiating and rate-limiting enzyme in the neutral pathway that converts cholesterol to primary bile acids (BA). CYP7A1-deficient (Cyp7a1(-/-)) mice have a depleted BA pool, diminished intestinal cholesterol absorption, accelerated fecal sterol loss, and increased intestinal cholesterol synthesis. To determine the molecular and physiological effects of restoring the BA pool in this model, adult female Cyp7a1(-/-) mice and matching Cyp7a1(+/+) controls were fed diets containing cholic acid (CA) at modest levels [0.015, 0.030, and 0.060% (wt/wt)] for 15-18 days. A level of just 0.03% provided a CA intake of ~12 μmol (4.8 mg) per day per 100 g body wt and was sufficient in the Cyp7a1(-/-) mice to normalize BA pool size, fecal BA excretion, fractional cholesterol absorption, and fecal sterol excretion but caused a significant rise in the cholesterol concentration in the small intestine and liver, as well as a marked inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in these organs. In parallel with these metabolic changes, there were marked shifts in intestinal and hepatic expression levels for many target genes of the BA sensor farnesoid X receptor, as well as genes involved in cholesterol transport, especially ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter A1 (ABCA1) and ABCG8. In Cyp7a1(+/+) mice, this level of CA supplementation did not significantly disrupt BA or cholesterol metabolism, except for an increase in fecal BA excretion and marginal changes in mRNA expression for some BA synthetic enzymes. These findings underscore the importance of using moderate dietary BA levels in studies with animal models.
Aging is a physiological process with a progressive decline of adaptation and functional capacity of the body. Bile acids (BAs) have been recognized as signaling molecules regulating the homeostasis of glucose, lipid, and energy. The current study characterizes the age-related changes of individual BA concentrations by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) in serum and liver of male and female C57BL/6 mice from 3 to 27 months of age. Total BA concentrations in serum increased 340% from 3 to 27 months in female mice, whereas they remained relatively constant with age in male mice. During aging, male and female mice shared the following changes: (1) BA concentrations in liver remained relatively constant; (2) the proportions of beta-muricholic acid (βMCA) increased and deoxycholic acid (DCA) decreased between 3 and 27 months in serum and liver; and (3) total BAs in serum and liver became more hydrophilic between 3 and 27 months. In female mice, (1) the mRNAs of hepatic BA uptake transporters, the Na(+)/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (Ntcp) and the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1b2 (Oatp1b2), decreased after 12 months, and similar trends were observed for their proteins; (2) the mRNA of the rate-limiting enzyme for BA synthesis, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1), increased from 3 to 9 months and remained high thereafter. However, in male mice, Ntcp, Oatp1b2, and Cyp7a1 mRNAs remained relatively constant with age. In summary, the current study shows gender-divergent profiles of BA concentrations and composition in serum and liver of mice during aging, which is likely due to the gender-divergent expression of BA transporters Ntcp and Oatp1b2 as well as the synthetic enzyme Cyp7a1.
Z-Guggulsterone is a major ingredient in the Indian traditional hypolipidemic remedy guggul. A study in mice has established that its hypolipidemic effect involves the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), presumably by acting as an antagonist of this receptor. It is generally assumed that the antagonism leads to induction of cytochrome P450 7A1 (CYP7A1), the rate-limiting enzyme converting free cholesterol to bile acids. In this study, we tested whether Z-guggulsterone indeed induces human CYP7A1. In addition, the expression of cholesteryl ester hydrolase CES1 and bile salt export pump (BSEP) was monitored. Contrary to the general assumption, Z-guggulsterone did not induce CYP7A1. Instead, this phytosterol significantly induced CES1 and BSEP through transactivation. Z-Guggulsterone underwent metabolism by CYP3A4, and the metabolites greatly increased the induction potency on BSEP but not on CES1. BSEP induction favors cholesterol elimination, whereas CES1 involves both elimination and retention (probably when excessively induced). Interestingly, clinical trials reported the hypolipidemic response rates from 18% to 80% and showed that higher dosages actually increased VLDL cholesterol. Our findings predict that better hypolipidemic outcomes likely occur in individuals who have a relatively higher capacity of metabolizing Z-guggulsterone with moderate CES1 induction, a scenario possibly achieved by lowering the dosing regimens.
Recently, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) plasma levels have been proved to be associated with atherosclerosis development. Among the targets aimed to ameliorating atherosclerotic lesions, inducing bile acid synthesis to eliminate excess cholesterol in body is an effective way. Individual bile acid as endogenous ligands for the nuclear receptor has differential effects on regulating bile acid metabolism. It is unclear whether bile acid profiles are mechanistically linked to TMAO-induced development of atherosclerosis.
Male apoE-/- mice were fed with control diet containing 0.3% TMAO for 8 weeks. Aortic lesion development and serum lipid profiles were determined. Bile acid profiles in bile, liver and serum were measured by liquid chromatographic separation and mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS). Real-time PCRs were performed to analyze mRNA expression of genes related to hepatic bile acid metabolism.
The total plaque areas in the aortas strongly increased 2-fold (P &lt; 0.001) in TMAO administration mice. The levels of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) in TMAO group were also significantly increased by 25.5% (P = 0.044), 31.2% (P = 0.006), 28.3% (P = 0.032), respectively. TMAO notably changed bile acid profiles, especially in serum, the most prominent inductions were tauromuricholic acid (TMCA), deoxycholic acid (DCA) and cholic acid (CA). Mechanically, TMAO inhibited hepatic bile acid synthesis by specifically repressing the classical bile acid synthesis pathway, which might be mediated by activation of small heterodimer partner (SHP) and farnesoid X receptor (FXR).
These findings suggested that TMAO accelerated aortic lesion formation in apoE-/- mice by altering bile acid profiles, further activating nuclear receptor FXR and SHP to inhibit bile acid synthesis by reducing Cyp7a1 expression.
This study investigated the anti-obesity effects of collagen peptide derived from skate skin on lipid metabolism in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. All C57BL6/J male mice were fed a HFD with 60% kcal fat except for mice in the normal group which were fed a chow diet. The collagen-fed groups received collagen peptide (1050 Da) orally (100, 200, or 300 mg/kg body weight per day) by gavage, whereas the normal and control groups were given water (n = 9 per group). The body weight gain and visceral adipose tissue weight were lower in the collagen-fed groups than in the control group (p &lt; 0.05). Plasma and hepatic lipid levels were significantly reduced by downregulating the hepatic protein expression levels for fatty acid synthesis (sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)) and cholesterol synthesis (SREBP-2 and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR)) and upregulating those for β-oxidation (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1)) and synthesis of bile acid (cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily A member 1 (CYP7A1)) (p &lt; 0.05). In the collagen-fed groups, the hepatic protein expression level of phosphorylated 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) and plasma adiponectin levels were higher, and the leptin level was lower (p &lt; 0.05). Histological analysis revealed that collagen treatment suppressed hepatic lipid accumulation and reduced the lipid droplet size in the adipose tissue. These effects were increased in a dose-dependent manner. The findings indicated that skate collagen peptide has anti-obesity effects through suppression of fat accumulation and regulation of lipid metabolism.
Bile acid (BA) synthesis is regulated through suppression of hepatic cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase via farnesoid X receptor (FXR) activation in hepatocytes and/or enterocytes; in enterocytes, this process requires FGF19 signaling. To study these pathways, we quantified markers of BA synthesis (7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one [C4]) and cholesterol production (lathosterol), fibroblast growth factor (FGF)19, and BAs in serum from healthy male volunteers given 1 oral dose of the nonsteroidal FXR agonist Px-102 (0.15 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, 0.6 mg/kg, 1.12 mg/kg, 2.25 mg/kg, 3.38 mg/kg, or 4.5 mg/kg). After 8 hours, serum levels of C4 decreased by 80% in volunteers given 0.15 mg/kg, whereas serum levels of FGF19 were unchanged. Serum levels of FGF19 increased significantly, in a dose-dependent manner, in volunteers given &gt;0.3 mg/kg Px-102, up to as much as 1600%, whereas C4 levels remained significantly reduced (by &gt;80%). For all doses, FGF19 levels returned to normal 24 hours after administration of Px-102. Serum levels of C4 decreased before levels of FGF19 levels increased, and were still reduced by 95% 24 hours after the highest dose (4.5 mg/kg) of Px-102, even though levels of FGF19 had returned to baseline. Our findings indicate that activation of hepatic FXR is able to suppress BA synthesis, independent of FGF19.
Bile acids (BAs) are synthesized in the liver via the oxidation of cholesterol and further metabolized by microbiota in the gut, where they simultaneously impact gut function. In the present study, 10 goats were randomly divided into 2 groups; 1 group was injected with dexamethasone (Dex; 0.2 mg/kg), and the other group was injected with saline as the control (Con) for 21 d. Expression levels of key genes and proteins in the liver and gut mucosa were analyzed and compared to investigate the impact of chronic stress on BA metabolism and related functions in ruminants. The results revealed that Dex decreased plasma total BAs (TBAs) concentration (P &lt; 0.05) but increased TBA concentration in the cecal digesta (P &lt; 0.05). Total cholesterol in the liver decreased moderately in response to Dex. The protein expression of cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily A member 1 and cytochrome P450 family 27 subfamily A member 1, 2 enzymes that control BA synthesis in the liver, remained unchanged by Dex administration (P &gt; 0.05). The expression of several genes in the cecal mucosa encoding epithelial tight junction proteins, including occludin (P &lt; 0.05), tight junction protein 1 (P &lt; 0.01), and claudin 1 (P &lt; 0.05), increased significantly in response to Dex, and expression of defensin beta 1, which can strengthen the innate immune system, was also upregulated (P &lt; 0.05). In addition, BAs increased the expression of the Solute Carrier family 9 member A 2 (P &lt; 0.01) that encodes a sodium hydrogen exchanger. These results suggest that the Dex-induced disruption of BA homeostasis might be mediated through a liver-independent pathway in goats, and the Dex-induced accumulation of TBAs in the cecal digesta may improve volatile fatty acid transportation and mucosal defense.
In this study, the level of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in wheat bran was increased to be six times higher through the action of endogenous glutamate decarboxylase compared with untreated bran. The process of GABA formation in wheat bran also led to an increased level of phenolic compounds with enhanced antioxidant capacity 2 times higher than the untreated status. The interventional effect of a diet containing GABA-enriched bran on hyperinsulinemia induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) was investigated in a rat model. The results showed that, when compared with animals fed with HFD-containing untreated bran (NB group), the consumption of HFD-containing GABA-enriched bran (GB group) demonstrated a greater improvement of insulin resistance/sensitivity as revealed by the changes in the homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) and the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI). The expression of hepatic genes, cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily A member 1 (Cyp7a1) and ubiquitin C (Ubc), which are involved in the adipogenesis-associated PPAR signalling pathway, was found to be significantly down-regulated in the GB group compared with the HFD group (P = 0.0055). Meanwhile, changes in the expression of a number of genes associated with lipid metabolism and gluconeogenesis were also noted in the GB group versus the HFD group, but not in the NB group, indicating different regulatory patterns between the two brans in a high-fat diet. More importantly, the analysis of key genes related to glucose metabolism further revealed that the expression of insulin-induced gene 1/2 (Insig-1/2) was increased following GB intervention with a corresponding reduction in phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (Pepck) and glucose-6-phosphatase, catalytic subunit (G6pc) expression, suggesting that glucose homeostasis is greatly improved through the intervention of GABA-enriched bran in the context of a high-fat diet.
Previous studies showed that butyrate played benefit roles in the health and metabolism of animals. However, little information on the effects of butyrate on the metabolism of piglets at the extraintestinal level is available. The present study investigated transcriptomic and metabolomic responses in the livers of pigs to evaluate the effects of intravenous sodium butyrate (SB) on the body's metabolism at the extraintestinal level. A total of 12 Duroc×Landrace×Large White growing barrows (60 days of age) fitted with jugular vein cannula were randomly allocated to either the SB group or the control (CO) group. Pigs in the SB group were intravenously infused with 10 ml SB (200 mmol/l) for 7 days, whereas pigs in the CO group were treated with the same amount of saline. The livers of pigs were collected for gene expression and metabolome analyses. The RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis showed that the mRNA expression of Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1 (ACSL1), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A), acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 2 (ACAA2) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PCK1) were downregulated (Q&lt;0.05), whereas fatty acid binding protein 1 (FABP1) and cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily A member 1 (CYP7A1) were upregulated (P&lt;0.05) by SB treatment, indicating a decrease in fatty acid oxidation and gluconeogenesis and an increase in fatty acid transportation and cholesterol metabolism. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis showed that raffinose was enriched in the SB group compared with the CO group, indicating a decrease in metabolism of galactose. Moreover, SB treatment significantly decreased the concentration of blood cholesterol. The results suggest that a short-term intravenous infusion of SB could modulate hepatic lipid metabolism by decreasing fatty acid oxidation and increasing fatty acid transportation and cholesterol metabolism.
Gallstone disease is one of the most prevalent and costly gastrointestinal disorders worldwide. Gallstones are formed in the biliary system by cholesterol secretions in bile, which result from excess cholesterol, a deficiency in bile salts or a combination of the two. The present study examined the effects of proteasome inhibition on gallstone formation using the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib (BT) and carfilzomib (CF). C57BL/6J mice were fed a lithogenic diet to generate gallstones and injected with BT or CF for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks of the lithogenic diet, 8 out of the 10 mice in the control group had developed gallstones, whereas none of the mice who received proteasome inhibitors had developed gallstones. Notably, the expression of genes associated with cholesterol synthesis (sterol regulatory element‑binding protein‑2 and 3‑hydroxy‑3‑methylglutaryl‑CoA reductase), cholesterol secretion [ATP‑binding cassette subfamily G member 5 (ABCG5) and ABCG8] and bile acid synthesis [cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily A member 1 (Cyp7a1), Cyp7b1, Cyp27a1 and Cyp8b1] was reduced in the livers of mice injected with BT or CF. Cyp7a1 encodes cholesterol 7α‑hydroxylase, the rate‑limiting enzyme in the synthesis of bile acid from cholesterol. The present study therefore measured the expression levels of transcription factors that are known to inhibit Cyp7a1 expression, namely farnesoid X receptor (FXR), pregnane X receptor (PXR) and small heterodimer partner (SHP). Although FXR, PXR and SHP expression was predicted to increase in the presence of proteasome inhibitors, the expression levels were actually reduced; thus, it was concluded that they were not involved in the proteasome inhibition‑induced regulation of Cyp7a1. Further investigation of the mitogen‑activated protein kinase and protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathways in human hepatoma cells revealed that proteasome inhibition‑induced c‑Jun N‑terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation reduced CYP7A1 and CYP27A1 expression. In addition, reduced PKA phosphorylation as a result of proteasome inhibition regulated ABCG5 and ABCG8 expression. In conclusion, these findings suggest that proteasome inhibition regulates cholesterol and biliary metabolism via the JNK and PKA pathways, and is a promising therapeutic strategy to prevent gallstone disease.
Nuclear heme receptor reverse erythroblastosis virus (REV-ERB) α (a transcriptional repressor) is known to regulate cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and bile acid synthesis. However, the mechanism for REV-ERBα regulation of CYP7A1 remains elusive. Here, we investigate the role of LRH-1 in REV-ERBα regulation of CYP7A1 and cholesterol metabolism. We first characterized the tertiary amine N-(4-chloro-2-methylbenzyl)-N-(4-chlorobenzyl)-1-(5-nitrothiophen-2-yl)methanamine (GSK2945) as a highly specific Rev-erbα/REV-ERBα antagonist using cell-based assays and confirmed expression of Rev-erbα in mouse liver. GSK2945 treatment increased hepatic mouse cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1) level and lowered plasma cholesterol in wild-type mice. Likewise, the compound increased the expression and microsomal activity of Cyp7a1 in hypercholesterolemic mice. This coincided with reduced plasma and liver cholesterol and enhanced production of bile acids. Increased levels of Cyp7a1/CYP7A1 were also found in mouse and human primary hepatocytes after GSK2945 treatment. In these experiments, we observed parallel increases in Lrh-1/LRH-1 (a known hepatic activator of Cyp7a1/CYP7A1) mRNA and protein. Luciferase reporter, mobility shift, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that Lrh-1/LRH-1 was a direct Rev-erbα/REV-ERBα target gene. Furthermore, conditional deletion of Lrh-1 in the liver abrogated the regulatory effects of Rev-erbα on Cyp7a1 and cholesterol metabolism in mice. In conclusion, Rev-erbα regulates Cyp7a1 and cholesterol metabolism through its repression of the Lrh-1 receptor. Targeting the REV-ERBα/LRH-1 axis may represent a novel approach for management of cholesterol-related diseases.
Desynchronization between the master clock in the brain, which is entrained by (day) light, and peripheral organ clocks, which are mainly entrained by food intake, may have negative effects on energy metabolism. Bile acid metabolism follows a clear day/night rhythm. We investigated whether in rats on a normal chow diet the daily rhythm of plasma bile acids and hepatic expression of bile acid metabolic genes is controlled by the light/dark cycle or the feeding/fasting rhythm. In addition, we investigated the effects of high caloric diets and time-restricted feeding on daily rhythms of plasma bile acids and hepatic genes involved in bile acid synthesis. In experiment 1 male Wistar rats were fed according to three different feeding paradigms: food was available ad libitum for 24 h (ad lib) or time-restricted for 10 h during the dark period (dark fed) or 10 h during the light period (light fed). To allow further metabolic phenotyping, we manipulated dietary macronutrient intake by providing rats with a chow diet, a free choice high-fat-high-sugar diet or a free choice high-fat (HF) diet. In experiment 2 rats were fed a normal chow diet, but food was either available in a 6-meals-a-day (6M) scheme or ad lib. During both experiments, we measured plasma bile acid levels and hepatic mRNA expression of genes involved in bile acid metabolism at eight different time points during 24 h. Time-restricted feeding enhanced the daily rhythm in plasma bile acid concentrations. Plasma bile acid concentrations are highest during fasting and dropped during the period of food intake with all diets. An HF-containing diet changed bile acid pool composition, but not the daily rhythmicity of plasma bile acid levels. Daily rhythms of hepatic Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1 mRNA expression followed the hepatic molecular clock, whereas for Shp expression food intake was leading. Combining an HF diet with feeding in the light/inactive period annulled CYp7a1 and Cyp8b1 gene expression rhythms, whilst keeping that of Shp intact. In conclusion, plasma bile acids and key genes in bile acid biosynthesis are entrained by food intake as well as the hepatic molecular clock. Eating during the inactivity period induced changes in the plasma bile acid pool composition similar to those induced by HF feeding.
Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member D1 (AKR1D1) is a Δ4-3-oxosteroid 5β-reductase required for bile acid synthesis and steroid hormone metabolism. Both bile acids and steroid hormones, especially glucocorticoids, play important roles in regulating body metabolism and energy expenditure. Currently, our understanding on AKR1D1 regulation and its roles in metabolic diseases is limited. We found that AKR1D1 expression was markedly repressed in diabetic patients. Consistent with repressed AKR1D1 expression, hepatic bile acids were significantly reduced in diabetic patients. Mechanistic studies showed that activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) transcriptionally down-regulated AKR1D1 expression in vitro in HepG2 cells and in vivo in mice. Consistently, PPARα signaling was enhanced in diabetic patients. In summary, dysregulation of AKR1D1 disrupted bile acid and steroid hormone homeostasis, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetes. Restoring bile acid and steroid hormone homeostasis by modulating AKR1D1 expression may represent a new approach to develop therapies for diabetes.
The cysteine dioxygenase (Cdo1)-null mouse is unable to synthesize hypotaurine and taurine by the cysteine/cysteine sulfinate pathway and has very low taurine levels in all tissues. The lack of taurine is associated with a lack of taurine conjugation of bile acids, a dramatic increase in the total and unconjugated hepatic bile acid pools, and an increase in betaine and other molecules that serve as organic osmolytes. We used the Cdo1-mouse model to determine the effects of taurine deficiency on expression of proteins involved in sulfur amino acid and bile acid metabolism. We identified cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase (Csad), betaine:homocysteine methytransferase (Bhmt), cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1), and cytochrome P450 3A11 (Cyp3a11) as genes whose hepatic expression is strongly regulated in response to taurine depletion in the Cdo1-null mouse. Dietary taurine supplementation of Cdo1-null mice restored hepatic levels of these four proteins and their respective mRNAs to wild-type levels, whereas dietary taurine supplementation had no effect on abundance of these proteins or mRNAs in wild-type mice.
As a cellular bile acid sensor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR) participates in regulation of bile acid, lipid and glucose homeostasis, and liver protection. Clinical results have validated FXR as therapeutic target in hepatic and metabolic diseases. To date, potent FXR agonists share a negatively ionizable function that might compromise their pharmacokinetic distribution and behavior. Here we report the development and characterization of a high-affinity FXR modulator not comprising an acidic residue.
The interference of bile acid secretion through bile salt export pump (BSEP) inhibition is one of the mechanisms for troglitazone (TGZ)-induced hepatotoxicity. Here, we investigated the impact of single or repeated oral doses of TGZ (200 mg/kg/day, 7 days) on bile acid homoeostasis in wild-type (WT) and Bsep knockout (KO) rats. Following oral doses, plasma exposures of TGZ were not different between WT and KO rats, and were similar on day 1 and day 7. However, plasma exposures of the major metabolite, troglitazone sulfate (TS), in KO rats were 7.6- and 9.3-fold lower than in WT on day 1 and day 7, respectively, due to increased TS biliary excretion. With Bsep KO, the mRNA levels of multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp2), Mrp3, Mrp4, Mdr1, breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp), sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide, small heterodimer partner, and Sult2A1 were significantly altered in KO rats. Following seven daily TGZ treatments, Cyp7A1 was significantly increased in both WT and KO rats. In the vehicle groups, plasma exposures of individual bile acids demonstrated variable changes in KO rats as compared with WT. WT rats dosed with TGZ showed an increase of many bile acid species in plasma on day 1, suggesting the inhibition of Bsep. Conversely, these changes returned to base levels on day 7. In KO rats, alterations of most bile acids were observed after seven doses of TGZ. Collectively, bile acid homeostasis in rats was regulated through bile acid synthesis and transport in response to Bsep deficiency and TGZ inhibition. Additionally, our study is the first to demonstrate that repeated TGZ doses can upregulate Cyp7A1 in rats.
Haw pectin penta-oligogalacturonide (HPPS) has important role in improving cholesterol metabolism and promoting the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids (BA) in mice fed high-cholesterol diet (HCD). However, the mechanism is not clear. This study aims to investigate the effects of HPPS on cholesterol accumulation and the regulation of hepatic BA synthesis and transport in HCD-fed mice. Results showed that HPPS significantly decreased plasma and hepatic TC levels but increased plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) levels, compared to HCD. BA analysis showed that HPPS markedly decreased hepatic and small intestine BA levels but increased the gallbladder BA levels, and finally decreased the total BA pool size, compared to HCD. Studies of molecular mechanism revealed that HPPS promoted hepatic ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1), and scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) expression but did not affect ATB binding cassette transporter G5/G8 (ABCG5/8) expression. HPPS inactivated hepatic farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and target genes expression, which resulted in significant increase of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase 1 (CYP7A1) and sterol 12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1) expression, with up-regulations of 204.2% and 33.5% for mRNA levels, respectively, compared with HCD. In addition, HPPS markedly enhanced bile salt export pump (BSEP) expression but didn't affect the sodium/taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) expression. In conclusion, the study revealed that HPPS reduced cholesterol accumulation by promoting BA synthesis in the liver and excretion in the feces, and might promote macrophage-to-liver reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) but did not liver-to-fecal RCT.
Xanthohumol, a prominent prenyl flavonoid from the hop plant (Humulus lupulus L.), is suggested to be antiatherogenic since it reportedly increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. It is not clear whether xanthohumol promotes reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), the most important antiatherogenic property of HDL; therefore, we investigated the effects of xanthohumol on macrophage-to-feces RCT using a hamster model as a CETP-expressing species. In vivo RCT experiments showed that xanthohumol significantly increased fecal appearance of the tracer derived from intraperitoneally injected [3H]-cholesterol-labeled macrophages. Ex vivo experiments were then employed to investigate the detailed mechanism by which xanthohumol enhanced RCT. Cholesterol efflux capacity from macrophages was 1.5-fold higher in xanthohumol-fed hamsters compared with the control group. In addition, protein expression and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase activity in the HDL fraction were significantly higher in xanthohumol-fed hamsters compared with the control, suggesting that xanthohumol promoted HDL maturation. Hepatic transcript analysis revealed that xanthohumol increased mRNA expression of abcg8 and cyp7a1. In addition, protein expressions of liver X receptor α and bile pump export protein were increased in the liver by xanthohumol administration when compared with the control, implying that it stimulated bile acid synthesis and cholesterol excretion to feces. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that xanthohumol improves RCT in vivo through cholesterol efflux from macrophages and excretion to feces, leading to antiatherosclerosis effects. It remains to be elucidated whether enhancement of RCT by xanthohumol could prove valuable in humans.
Patterning of the small intestinal epithelium along its cephalocaudal axis establishes three functionally distinct regions: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Efficient nutrient assimilation and growth depend on the proper spatial patterning of specialized digestive and absorptive functions performed by duodenal, jejunal, and ileal enterocytes. When enterocyte function is disrupted by disease or injury, intestinal failure can occur. One approach to alleviate intestinal failure would be to restore lost enterocyte functions. The molecular mechanisms determining regionally defined enterocyte functions, however, are poorly delineated. We previously showed that GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4) is essential to define jejunal enterocytes. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that GATA4 is sufficient to confer jejunal identity within the intestinal epithelium.
To test this hypothesis, we generated a novel Gata4 conditional knock-in mouse line and expressed GATA4 in the ileum, where it is absent.
We found that GATA4-expressing ileum lost ileal identity. The global gene expression profile of GATA4-expressing ileal epithelium aligned more closely with jejunum and duodenum rather than ileum. Focusing on jejunal vs ileal identity, we defined sets of jejunal and ileal genes likely to be regulated directly by GATA4 to suppress ileal identity and promote jejunal identity. Furthermore, our study implicates GATA4 as a transcriptional repressor of fibroblast growth factor 15 (Fgf15), which encodes an enterokine that has been implicated in an increasing number of human diseases.
Overall, this study refines our understanding of an important GATA4-dependent molecular mechanism to pattern the intestinal epithelium along its cephalocaudal axis by elaborating on GATA4's function as a crucial dominant molecular determinant of jejunal enterocyte identity. Microarray data from this study have been deposited into NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) and are accessible through GEO series accession number GSE75870.
Cholestyramine (CHO), as a bile acid sequestering exchange resin, has been widely used to treat hypercholesterolemia. The aim of this study was to explore how CHO regulated serum cholesterol amounts and bile acid levels in animal models.
New Zealand White rabbits were randomly assigned to the control (given distilled water) and CHO-treated (given CHO solution 1 g/kg per day for 2 weeks) groups. To assess bile acid pool size, bile fistulas were constructed in five rabbits in each group. Serum cholesterol levels and biliary and fecal bile outputs were determined. Liver cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase ( CYP7A1 ), small heterodimer partner ( SHP ), bile salt export pump ( BSEP ), ileal bile acid-binding protein ( IBABP ) and LDL receptor ( LDL-R ) mRNA expressions were assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. CYP7A1 activity was also determined.
CHO treatment decreased serum cholesterol levels by 12.1%. Although CHO did not change the bile acid pool size and biliary bile acid output, it significantly increased fecal bile acid output. Interestingly, CHO also significantly increased the expression and activity of CYP7A1, as well as IBABP and LDL-R mRNA expressions, but decreased hepatic SHP and BSEP gene expressions.
CHO markedly alters bile acid and cholesterol amounts in rabbit intestinal and liver tissues, downregulating genes responsible for cholesterol homeostasis.
Hypercholesterolemia is one of the important risk factors of atherosclerosis (AS). The aim of this study is to explore the effect of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) on serum cholesterol levels and their mechanism of action. Hyperlipemia, as a model of abnormal lipid hypermetabolism, was established by using a high fat diet in C57BL/6J mice. Forty eight mice with dyslipidemia were randomly divided into 4 groups, 12 mice per group, including the control group, the 2% caprylic acid (C8:0)-treated group, 2% capric acid (C10:0)-treated group, and 2% oleic acid (C18:1)-treated group. All mice were fed with a high fat diet. After 16 weeks, the mice were anesthetized with chloral hydrate. The mouse portal vein blood, the liver and the start site of the ileum (1 cm) were collected. The body weight of the mice and blood lipid profiles were measured. Gene transcription and the expression level associated with bile acid metabolism in the liver and small intestine were determined by real-time PCR and the western blotting method. The concentrations of bile acid metabolites in bile and feces were analysed. After 16 weeks of treatment, the concentrations of TC and LDL-C in the caprylic acid group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P &lt; 0.05); the transcription and expression level of LXR, CYP7A1, CYP27A1 and ABCG8 in the caprylic acid and capric acid groups were significantly higher than those in the control group in the liver (P &lt; 0.05), however the transcription and expression level of the small heterodimer partner (SHP) were significantly lower than those in the control group (P &lt; 0.05); the transcription and expression level of LXR, ABCG5 and ABCG8 in the caprylic acid, capric acid and oleic acid groups were significantly higher than those in the control group in the small intestine (P &lt; 0.05). The concentrations of total bile acid, mainly cholic acid and cholesterol in bile and feces were significantly higher in the caprylic and capric acid groups than those of in the control group (P &lt; 0.05). Thus, MCFA increased the expression of LXR and ABCG8, enhanced CYP7A1 and CYP27A1 expression, decreased and SHP expression in the liver, thereby promoted liver bile acid synthesis and excretion. In addition MCFA increased the expression of ABCG5, ABCG8 and LXR in the small intestine, thereby inhibiting small intestinal bile acid absorption, increasing the concentrations of cholesterol and bile acid in bile and feces and reducing the level of serum cholesterol.
The transcription factor cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein H (CREBH, encoded by Creb3l3) is highly expressed in the liver and small intestine. Hepatic CREBH contributes to glucose and triglyceride metabolism by regulating fibroblast growth factor 21 (Fgf21) expression. However, the intestinal CREBH function remains unknown.
To investigate the influence of intestinal CREBH on cholesterol metabolism, we compared plasma, bile, fecal, and tissue cholesterol levels between wild-type (WT) mice and mice overexpressing active human CREBH mainly in the small intestine (CREBH Tg mice) under different dietary conditions.
Plasma cholesterol, hepatic lipid, and cholesterol crystal formation in the gallbladder were lower in CREBH Tg mice fed a lithogenic diet (LD) than in LD-fed WTs, while fecal cholesterol output was higher in the former. These results suggest that intestinal CREBH overexpression suppresses cholesterol absorption, leading to reduced plasma cholesterol, limited hepatic supply, and greater excretion. The expression of Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (Npc1l1), a rate-limiting transporter mediating intestinal cholesterol absorption, was reduced in the small intestine of CREBH Tg mice. Adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter A1 (Abca1), Abcg5/8, and scavenger receptor class B, member 1 (Srb1) expression levels were also reduced in CREBH Tg mice. Promoter assays revealed that CREBH directly regulates Npc1l1 expression. Conversely, CREBH null mice exhibited higher intestinal Npc1l1 expression, elevated plasma and hepatic cholesterol, and lower fecal output.
Intestinal CREBH regulates dietary cholesterol flow from the small intestine by controlling the expression of multiple intestinal transporters. We propose that intestinal CREBH could be a therapeutic target for hypercholesterolemia.
The sun mushroom (Agaricus brasiliensis) is considered a major source of bioactive compounds with potential health benefits. Mushrooms typically act as lipid-lowering agents; however, little is known about the mechanisms of action of A. brasiliensis in biological systems. This study aimed to determine the underlying mechanism involved in the cholesterol-lowering effect of A. brasiliensis through the assessment of fecal and serum lipid profiles in addition to gene expression analysis of specific transcription factors, enzymes, and transporters involved in cholesterol homeostasis.
Twenty-four albino Fischer rats approximately 90 days old, with an average weight of 205 g, were divided into four groups of 6 each and fed a standard AIN-93 M diet (C), hypercholesterolemic diet (H), hypercholesterolemic diet +1 % A. brasiliensis (HAb), or hypercholesterolemic diet +0.008 % simvastatin (HS) for 6 weeks. Simvastatin was used as a positive control, as it is a typical drug prescribed for lipid disorders. Subsequently, blood, liver, and feces samples were collected for lipid profile and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction gene expression analyses.
Diet supplementation with A. brasiliensis significantly improved serum lipid profiles, comparable to the effect observed for simvastatin. In addition, A. brasiliensis dietary supplementation markedly promoted fecal cholesterol excretion. Increased expression of 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), ATP-binding cassette subfamily G-transporters (ABCG5/G8), and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) was observed following A. brasiliensis administration.
Our results suggest that consumption of A. brasiliensis improves the serum lipid profile in hypercholesterolemic rats by modulating the expression of key genes involved in hepatic cholesterol metabolism.
Nonalcoholic hepatic fat accumulation has been hypothesized to be associated with alterations in gut microbiota composition, although mechanistic explanations for this link are largely insufficient. The aim of this study was to elucidate the microbiota-driven mechanisms involved in the development of nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis.
Ob/ob mice and their wild-type lean control mice were fed an AIN-93G diet for 12 weeks. Faecal microbiota composition, faecal bile acid (BA) profile and intestinal and hepatic markers of BA metabolism were analysed. Ob/ob mice had significantly less faecal taurine-conjugated BAs compared to their lean controls. The proportions of butyrate-producing bacteria were lower in ob/ob mice compared to those in lean mice. Intestinal expression of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) mRNA was significantly higher, whereas hepatic expression of cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase 1 (CYP7A1) and small heterodimer partner (SHP) were significantly lower in ob/ob mice compared to those in control mice.
Microbiota-associated BAs deconjugation may induce nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by activating intestinal FXR signalling and blocking hepatic FXR-SHP pathway, thereby accelerating fat synthesis.
We provided evidences that changes in the gut microbiota and their metabolites can alter the profile of BAs, thereby providing a mechanism by which an altered microbiota profile contributes to the development of NAFLD.
Dairy intake has been associated with varying impacts on circulating cholesterol concentrations across nutritional epidemiology and intervention studies, with findings attributed mainly to differences in the nature of dairy products consumed or study designs. The contribution of the genomic architecture to such observations has yet to be revealed.
We assessed the impact of multiple common genetic variations in cholesterol-related genes on responses of serum cholesterol to the recommended amount of dairy product intake in Canada.
In a multicenter, randomized crossover design, 101 normolipidemic adults (n = 29 men and 72 women), with a mean ± SD age of 41.7 ± 16.7 y and a body mass index (BMI, in kg/m(2)) of 25.9 ± 4.3 consumed 3 servings/d of dairy [375 mL 1% milk-fat (MF) milk, 175 g 1.5% MF yogurt, and 30 g of 34% MF cheese] or energy-matched control products (juice, cashews, and cookies) provided within a prudent background diet for 4 wk each, separated by a 4- to 8-wk washout period. Serum lipid variables were determined by standard enzymatic methods by using an autoanalyzer. Candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms were assessed by TaqMan genotyping assay.
The responsiveness of serum total cholesterol (TC) and LDL cholesterol to the dairy compared with the control diet was associated with individuals' genotypes. The cholesterol transport gene ATP-binding cassette subfamily G, member 5 (ABCG5) rs6720173-GG homozygotes had higher concentrations of TC (+0.18 mmol/L; P = 0.0118) and LDL cholesterol (+0.17 mmol/L; P = 0.0056) relative to C-allele carriers (-0.07 and -0.06 mmol/L, respectively). The bile acid synthesis gene cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) rs3808607-G-allele carriers had higher TC (+0.20 to +0.28 mmol/L; P = 0.0026) and LDL cholesterol (+0.19 mmol/L for GT genotype; P = 0.0260) relative to TT homozygotes (-0.11 and -0.03 mmol/L, respectively). In addition, the cholesterol synthesis gene 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7) rs760241-A-allele carriers had higher LDL cholesterol (+0.26 mmol/L; P = 0.0399) relative to GG homozygotes (+0.06 mmol/L).
Genetic variations in ABCG5, CYP7A1, and DHCR7 may contribute to differing responses of serum cholesterol to dairy intake among healthy adults. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01444326.
Microarray profiling is a powerful approach to establish gene expression patterns for different histopathological stages of a malignancy, and at the same time, to identify individual genes that may have important functions in the early and/or advanced stages of a neoplasm. To identify genes that hitherto have not been shown to be expressed or play a role in advanced-stage melanomas, we conducted microarray analyses with RNAs from primary melanoma and melanoma-positive lymph node specimens. Using RT-PCR, quantitative, real-time RT-PCR, and fluorochrome oligonucleotide-based optical imaging, we established the level and pattern of expression of five of the identified known genes [Suppression of Tumorigenicity 13 (ST13), Cystatin 8 (CST-8), Dyskeratosis Congentia 1 (DKC1), Neuroendocrine Secretory Protein 55 (NESP55), Niemann-Pick Disease, type C2 (NP-C2)], and a gene with unknown function (16.7 kD Hypothetical Protein) in benign and atypical nevocytic lesions, advanced-stage melanomas, and melanoma-positive lymph nodes.
Niemann-Pick type C2 disease (NP-C2) is a fatal hereditary disorder of unknown etiology characterized by defective egress of cholesterol from lysosomes. Here we show that the disease is caused by a deficiency in HE1, a ubiquitously expressed lysosomal protein identified previously as a cholesterol-binding protein. HE1 was undetectable in fibroblasts from NP-C2 patients but present in fibroblasts from unaffected controls and NP-C1 patients. Mutations in the HE1 gene, which maps to chromosome 14q24.3, were found in NP-C2 patients but not in controls. Treatment of NP-C2 fibroblasts with exogenous recombinant HE1 protein ameliorated lysosomal accumulation of low density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol.
Niemann-Pick disease type C2 (NP-C2) is a fatal hereditary disease characterized by accumulation of low-density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol in lysosomes. Here we report the 1.7-A resolution crystal structure of the cholesterol-binding protein deficient in this disease, NPC2, and the characterization of its ligand binding properties. Human NPC2 binds the cholesterol analog dehydroergosterol with submicromolar affinity at both acidic and neutral pH. NPC2 has an Ig-like fold stabilized by three disulfide bonds. The structure of the bovine protein reveals a loosely packed region penetrating from the surface into the hydrophobic core that forms adjacent small cavities with a total volume of approximately 160 A(3). We propose that this region represents the incipient cholesterol-binding site that dilates to accommodate an approximately 740-A(3) cholesterol molecule.
Niemann Pick type C (NP-C) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder caused by an impairment of intracellular lipid transport. Due to the heterogeneous clinical phenotype and the lack of a reliable blood test, diagnosis and therapy are often delayed for years. In the cell, accumulating cholesterol leads to increased formation of oxysterols that can be used as a powerful screening parameter for NP-C. In a large scale study, we evaluated the oxysterol cholestane-3β,5α,6β-triol (c-triol) as potential biomarker for a rapid diagnosis of NP-C. Using GC/MS, c-triol has been analyzed in 1902 plasma samples of patients with the suspicion for NP-C. Diagnosis in patients with elevated oxysterols was confirmed by genetic analysis. 71 new NP-C patients (69 NP-C1 and two NP-C2) and 12 Niemann Pick type A/B patients were identified. 24 new mutations in NPC1, one new mutation in NPC2 and three new mutations in the SMPD1 gene were found. Cholestane-3β,5α,6β-triol was elevated in Niemann Pick type C1, type C2, type A/B and in CESD disease. No other study has ever identified so many NP-C patients, proving that c-triol is a rapid and reliable biomarker to detect patients with NP-C disease and related cholesterol transport disorders. It should replace the filipin test as the first-line diagnostic assay. 
We report the fifth case of neonatal form of type C2 (NP-C2) Niemann-Pick disease with early and fatal respiratory distress. Eleven families presenting such cases are known to date in the world. Since December 2000, isolation of the underlying gene HE1/NPC2 and its mutations has allowed major advances in diagnosis.
Elisa was born in May 2000. NP-C2 disease was associated with severe respiratory distress leading to death at the age of four months. On the next pregnancy in September 2000, prenatal diagnosis was performed by means of biological tests that required four weeks response time. In December 2000, isolation of the HE1/NPC2 gene located to 14q24.3 and of some of its mutations allowed to characterize the patient as being homozygote for the nonsense mutation E20X. On the the two next pregnancies, prenatal diagnosis was performed at 12 SA, in 48 hours, by the means of mutation analysis. The last fetus was heterozygote for the mutation E20X, allowing the birth at term of a healthy male newborn baby.
Niemann-Pick type C disease is a rare lysosomal lipid storage disease with severe prognosis. It is characterized by abnormalities of intracellular transport of endocytosed cholesterol. Diagnosis relies on biological tests that require cultured cells. Genetic heterogeneity defines two different genetic complementation groups C1 and C2. Severe and early respiratory distress is more likely to be associated with the rare type C2. Since December 2000, after identification of the disease-causing mutations in the proband, mutation analysis of gene HE1/NPC2 on direct chorionic villus samples allows early and fast (48 hours) prenatal diagnosis.
Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C) is a neurodegenerative lysosomal lipid storage disease caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the NPC1 or NPC2 genes. The clinical presentation and evolution of NP-C and the effect of miglustat treatment are described in the largest cohort of patients with adolescent/adult-onset NP-C studied to date.
Observational study based on clinical chart data from adult patients with NP-C (&gt; 18 year old) diagnosed in France between 1990 and 2015. Retrospective data from patients at diagnosis, onset of miglustat therapy (if applicable), and last follow up were analysed.
In France, patients with an adolescent-adult neurological form constituted approximately 25% of all NP-C cases diagnosed during the study period. Forty-seven patients (46 with NP-C1 and one with NP-C2; 53% female) were included. Mean ± SD (range) ages at neurological onset and diagnosis were 23.9 ± 12.5 (8-56) years and 34 ± 13.5 (15-65) years, respectively. At presentation, patients mainly had 1) impaired gait due to cerebellar ataxia and/or dystonia, 2) and/or cognitive/behavioural manifestations, 3) and/or psychotic signs. Initially, almost half of patients had only one of the above three neuro-psychiatric manifestations. Vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, usually occurring without patient complaint, was only detected on careful clinical examination and was recorded in most patients (93%) at the time of diagnosis, several years after neurological onset. Thirty-seven patients (79%) received miglustat, among whom seventeen (46%) continued beyond 2 years (at last follow up) to a maximum of 9.8 years. Eight patients (22%) discontinued treatment early due to side effects (n = 3) or perceived lack of efficacy (n = 5).Miglustat treatment duration correlated significantly with reduced neurological worsening (p &lt; 0.001). Treatment for≥2 years was associated with improved patient survival (p = 0.029). Good responses to miglustat were associated with less severe neurological disability at the start of miglustat treatment (p = 0.02).
The proportion of adolescent/adult-onset NP-C cases diagnosed in France increased 2.5-fold since 2009 compared with the 2000-2008 period due to improved awareness. Adolescent/adult-onset NP-C frequently presented initially with a non-specific isolated neuro-psychiatric manifestation (motor, cognitive or psychotic). Patients with less severe neurological disability responded better to miglustat therapy.
RBM5 is one member of a group of structurally related genes that includes RBM6 and RBM10. RBM10 maps to Xp11.23, and one allele is inactivated as a result of X chromosome inactivation. Both RBM5 and RBM6 map to 3p21.3, a tumor suppressor region that experiences loss of heterozygosity in the majority of lung cancers. Overexpression of RBM5, which encodes an RNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of alternative splicing and retards ascites associated tumor growth in immunocompromised mice, a phenomenon that may be related to an associated ability to modulate apoptosis. As part of our quest to gain a better understanding of how the proapoptotic activity of RBM5 might contribute to tumor suppressor function, we reviewed all the literature relating to RBM5 expression, with a focus on lung cancer. On the basis of the existing data, we suggest that-to more thoroughly assess the potential involvement of RBM5 as a lung cancer regulatory protein-more research is required regarding (a) the expression of not only full-length RBM5 but all of the alternate variants associated with the locus, in relation to histologic subtype and smoking history, and (b) the mutation status of various genes within the transforming growth factor-alpha signaling pathway, which may function to either directly or indirectly regulate RBM5 activity in RBM5-retaining lung cancers.
Transcription-induced chimerism, a mechanism involving the transcription and intergenic splicing of two consecutive genes, has recently been estimated to account for approximately 5% of the human transcriptome. Despite this prevalence, the regulation and function of these fused transcripts remains largely uncharacterised.
We identified three novel transcription-induced chimeras resulting from the intergenic splicing of a single RNA transcript incorporating the two neighbouring 3p21.3 tumour suppressor locus genes, RBM6 and RBM5, which encode the RNA Binding Motif protein 6 and RNA Binding Motif protein 5, respectively. Each of the three novel chimeric transcripts lacked exons 3, 6, 20 and 21 of RBM6 and exon 1 of RBM5. Differences between the transcripts were associated with the presence or absence of exon 4, exon 5 and a 17 nucleotide (nt) sequence from intron 10 of RBM6. All three chimeric transcripts incorporated the canonical splice sites from both genes (excluding the 17 nt intron 10 insertion). Differential expression was observed in tumour tissue compared to non-tumour tissue, and amongst tumour types. In breast tumour tissue, chimeric expression was associated with elevated levels of RBM6 and RBM5 mRNA, and increased tumour size. No protein expression was detected by in vitro transcription/translation.
These results suggest that RBM6 mRNA experiences altered co-transcriptional gene regulation in certain cancers. The results also suggest that RBM6-RBM5 transcription-induced chimerism might be a process that is linked to the tumour-associated increased transcriptional activity of the RBM6 gene. It appears that none of the transcription-induced chimeras generates a protein product; however, the novel alternative splicing, which affects putative functional domains within exons 3, 6 and 11 of RBM6, does suggest that the generation of these chimeric transcripts has functional relevance. Finally, the association of chimeric expression with breast tumour size suggests that RBM6-RBM5 chimeric expression may be a potential tumour differentiation marker.
Activated tyrosine kinases have been frequently implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and are validated targets for therapeutic intervention with small-molecule kinase inhibitors. To identify novel activated tyrosine kinases in AML, we used a discovery platform consisting of immunoaffinity profiling coupled to mass spectrometry that identifies large numbers of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, including active kinases. This method revealed the presence of an activated colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) kinase in the acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) cell line MKPL-1. Further studies using siRNA and a small-molecule inhibitor showed that CSF1R is essential for the growth and survival of MKPL-1 cells. DNA sequence analysis of cDNA generated by 5'RACE from CSF1R coding sequences identified a novel fusion of the RNA binding motif 6 (RBM6) gene to CSF1R gene generated presumably by a t(3;5)(p21;q33) translocation. Expression of the RBM6-CSF1R fusion protein conferred interleukin-3 (IL-3)-independent growth in BaF3 cells, and induces a myeloid proliferative disease (MPD) with features of megakaryoblastic leukemia in a murine transplant model. These findings identify a novel potential therapeutic target in leukemogenesis, and demonstrate the utility of phosphoproteomic strategies for discovery of tyrosine kinase alleles.
The aim of this study was to examine the expression of the RBM5 tumor suppressor, in relation to RBM6 and RBM10, to obtain a better understanding of the potential role played by these RBM5-related factors in the regulation of RBM5 tumor-suppressor activity. Paired non-tumor and tumor samples were obtained from 73 breast cancer patients. RNA and protein expression were examined by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot, respectively. Data were analyzed using various statistical methods to test for correlations amongst the RBM5-related factors, and between the factors and various pathological parameters. Most notably, RBM5, RBM10v1, and HER2 protein expression levels were elevated in tumor tissue (P &lt; 0.0001). RBM5 and RBM10v1 protein expression were significantly positively correlated (P &lt; 0.001), as were RBM5 and HER2 protein expression (P &lt; 0.01), in both non-tumor and tumor tissue, whereas RBM10v1 and HER2 protein expression were only marginally correlated, in non-tumor tissue (P &lt; 0.05). Interestingly, RBM5 and RBM10v1 protein expression were both deregulated in relation to RNA expression in tumor tissue. RBM10v2 and RBM6 RNA were highly significantly positively correlated in relation to various factors relating to poor prognosis (P &lt; 0.0001). To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine RBM5 expression at both the RNA and protein level in primary breast tumor tissue, and the first to examine expression of all RBM5-related factors in a comprehensive manner. The results provide a graphic illustration that RBM5-related factors are significantly differentially expressed in breast cancer, and suggest complex inter-related regulatory networks involving alternative splicing, oncogenic expression, and tissue-specific function.
In searching for a tumor suppressor gene in the 3p21.3 region, we isolated two genes, RBM5 and RBM6. Sequence analysis indicated that these genes share similarity. RBM5 and-to a lesser extent-RBM6 also have similarity to DXS8237E at Xp11.3-11.23, which maps less than 20 kb upstream of UBE1. A homologue of UBE1, UBE1L, is located at 3p21. 3. FISH analysis showed that the distance between UBE1L and RBM5 in 3p21.3 is about 265 kb. DXS8237E and UBE1 on the X chromosome have the same orientation, whereas on chromosome 3 the orientation of RBM5 and that of RBM6 are opposite to the orientation of UBE1L. Presumably, part of the Xp11.3-11.23 region has duplicated to chromosome 3. Part of this region on chromosome 3 may subsequently have duplicated again within the same chromosomal region. Inversion at some stage of the evolution of the human genome would explain the change in orientation of the genes on chromosome 3 compared with that of the genes on the X chromosome.
