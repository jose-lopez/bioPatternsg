Lithogenic hepatic bile secretion precedes the formation of cholesterol gallstones. Constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), a member of nuclear family, plays an important role in cholesterol and bile acid metabolism. To examine whether activation of CAR can prevent cholesterol gallstone formation, we treated C57BL6/J mice maintained on a lithogenic diet with CAR agonist 1,4-bis-[2-(3, 5-dichlorpyridyloxy)] benzene and performed bile duct cannulation to study the dynamics of biliary lipids. We report that activation of CAR decreases the biliary cholesterol concentration and prevents CGD formation. The lower biliary cholesterol level was largely attributed to suppressed Abcg5 and Abcg8 expression in CAR-activated mice. CAR activation also promoted cholesterol conversion into bile acids by increasing the expression of Cyp7a1, a rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid biosynthesis. Activation of CAR enhanced bile acid re-absorption via increasing the expression of bile acid transporters Asbt and Ostβ in the ileum. The hepatic steatosis was also improved in the liver of CAR-activated mice. Furthermore, activation of CAR protected the mice against the liver X receptor α-sensitized CGD through suppressing the expression of Abcg5/8. Collectively, CAR plays an important role in maintaining the homeostasis of cholesterol, bile acids, and triglycerides levels, and it might be a promising therapeutic target for preventing or treating CGD.
Liver X receptors (LXR) are deemed as potential drug targets for atherosclerosis, whereas a role in adipose tissue expansion and its relation to insulin sensitivity remains unclear. To assess the metabolic effects of LXR activation by the dual LXRα/β agonist T0901317, C57BL/6 mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) were treated with T0901317 (30 mg/kg once daily by intraperitoneal injection) for 3 weeks. Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were used for analysing the effect of T0901317 on glucose uptake. The following results were obtained from this study. T0901317 reduced fat mass, accompanied by a massive fatty liver and lower serum adipokine levels in HFD mice. Increased adipocyte apoptosis was found in epididymal fat of T0901317-treated HFD mice. In addition, T0901317 treatment promoted basal lipolysis, but blunted the anti-lipolytic action of insulin. Furthermore, LXR activation antagonised PPARγ target genes in epididymal fat and PPARγ-PPRE-binding activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Although the glucose tolerance was comparable to that in HFD mice, the insulin response during IPGTT was significantly higher and the insulin tolerance was significantly impaired in T0901317-treated HFD mice, indicating decreased insulin sensitivity by T0901317 administration, and which was further supported by impaired insulin signalling found in epididymal fat and decreased insulin-induced glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by T0901317 administration. In conclusion, these findings reveal that LXR activation impairs adipose expansion by increasing adipocyte apoptosis, lipolysis and antagonising PPARγ-mediated transcriptional activity, which contributes to decreased insulin sensitivity in whole body. The potential of LXR activation being a therapeutic target for atherosclerosis might be limited by the possibility of exacerbating insulin resistance.
CYP2B6 plays an increasingly important role in xenobiotic metabolism and detoxification. The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and the pregnane X receptor (PXR) have been established as predominant regulators for the inductive expression of CYP2B6 gene in human liver. However, there are dramatic interindividual variabilities in CYP2B6 expression that cannot be fully explained by the CAR/PXR-based modulation alone. Here, we show that expression level of CYP2B6 was correlated with that of hepatocyte nuclear factor 3β (HNF3β) in human primary hepatocytes prepared from 35 liver donors. Utilizing recombinant virus-mediated overexpression or knockdown of HNF3β in HepG2 cells, as well as constructs containing serial deletion and site-directed mutation of HNF3β binding motifs in CYP2B6 luciferase reporter assays, we demonstrated that the presence or lack of HNF3β expression markedly correlated with CYP2B6 gene expression and its promoter activity. Novel enhancer modules of HNF3β located upstream of the CYP2B6 gene transcription start site were identified and functionally validated as key elements governing HNF3β-mediated CYP2B6 expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in human primary hepatocytes and surface plasmon resonance binding affinity experiments confirmed the essential role of these enhancers in the recruitment of HNF3β to the promoter of CYP2B6 gene. Overall, these findings indicate that HNF3β represents a new liver enriched transcription factor that is involved in the transcription of CYP2B6 gene and contributes to the large interindividual variations of CYP2B6 expression in human population. 
The increase in the number of people with obesity- and noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus has become a major public health concern. Insulin resistance is a common feature closely associated with human obesity and diabetes. Insulin regulates metabolism, at least in part, via the control of the expression of the hepatic genes involved in glucose and fatty acid metabolism. Insulin resistance is always associated with profound changes of the expression of hepatic genes for glucose and lipid metabolism. As an essential micronutrient, vitamin A (VA) is needed in a variety of physiological functions. The active metablite of VA, retinoic acid (RA), regulates the expression of genes through the activation of transcription factors bound to the RA-responsive elements in the promoters of RA-targeted genes. Recently, retinoids have been proposed to play roles in glucose and lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. This paper summarizes the recent progresses in our understanding of VA metabolism in the liver and of the potential transcription factors mediating RA responses. These transcription factors are the retinoic acid receptor, the retinoid X receptor, the hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α, the chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II, and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor β/δ. This paper also summarizes the effects of VA status and RA treatments on the glucose and lipid metabolism in vivo and the effects of retinoid treatments on the expression of insulin-regulated genes involved in the glucose and fatty acid metabolism in the primary hepatocytes. I discuss the roles of RA production in the development of insulin resistance in hepatocytes and proposes a mechanism by which RA production may contribute to hepatic insulin resistance. Given the large amount of information and progresses regarding the physiological functions of VA, this paper mainly focuses on the findings in the liver and hepatocytes and only mentions the relative findings in other tissues and cells. 
Retinoid X receptors (RXRs) are members of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily that mediate signalling by 9-cis retinoic acid, a vitamin A derivative. RXRs play key roles not only as homodimers but also as heterodimeric partners, e.g., for retinoic acid receptors, vitamin D receptors, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. The NR family may also play important roles in the development of emphysema. However, the role of RXRs in the pathogenesis of emphysema is not well defined.
We developed a novel RXR partial agonist (NEt-4IB) and investigated its effect and mechanism compared to a full agonist (bexarotene) in a murine model of emphysema. For emphysema induction, BALB/c mice received intraperitoneal cigarette smoke extract (CSE) or intratracheal porcine pancreas elastase (PPE). Treatment with RXR agonists was initiated before or after emphysema induction.
Treatment with NEt-4IB significantly suppressed the increase in static lung compliance and emphysematous changes in CSE-induced emphysema and PPE-induced established and progressive emphysema. NEt-4IB significantly suppressed PPE-induced neutrophilic airway inflammation and the levels of keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC), C-X-C motif ligand5 (CXCL5), interferon (IFN)-γ and IL-17. NEt-4IB also improved the matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)/tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) imbalance and the reduced anti-oxidant activity in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. NEt-4IB suppressed PPE-induced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in the airway. Treatment with NEt-4IB and bexarotene significantly suppressed the increase in static lung compliance and emphysematous changes. However, adverse effects of RXR agonists, including hypertriglyceridemia and hepatomegaly, were observed in bexarotene-treated mice but not in NEt-4IB-treated mice.
These data suggest that RXRs play crucial roles in emphysema and airway inflammation, and novel partial RXR agonists could be potential therapeutic strategies for the treatment of PPE- and CSE-induced emphysema.
The delta opioid receptor (DOR), a physiologically relevant prototype for G protein-coupled receptors, is retained in intracellular compartments in neuronal cells. This retention is mediated by a nerve growth factor (NGF)-regulated checkpoint that delays the export of DOR from the trans-Golgi network. How DOR is selectively retained in the Golgi, in the midst of dynamic membrane transport and cargo export, is a fundamental unanswered question. Here we address this by investigating sequence elements on DOR that regulate DOR surface delivery, focusing on the C-terminal tail of DOR that is sufficient for NGF-mediated regulation. By systematic mutational analysis, we define conserved dual bi-arginine (RXR) motifs that are required for NGF- and phosphoinositide-regulated DOR export from intracellular compartments in neuroendocrine cells. These motifs were required to bind the coatomer protein I (COPI) complex, a vesicle coat complex that mediates primarily retrograde cargo traffic in the Golgi. Our results suggest that interactions of DOR with COPI, via atypical COPI motifs on the C-terminal tail, retain DOR in the Golgi. These interactions could provide a point of regulation of DOR export and delivery by extracellular signaling pathways.
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, is an intractable disease of the gastrointestinal tract. Multiple environmental factors, including food ingredients, have been implicated in the development of these diseases. For example, animal fat-rich diets are predisposing factors for ulcerative colitis, whereas n-3 unsaturated fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) show protective effects in experimental colitis and are negatively correlated with the incidence of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Given that DHA exhibits agonistic activity on retinoid X receptor (RXR), activation of RXR could be a therapeutic strategy for IBD. However, conventional full RXR agonists are known to show considerable adverse effects. We therefore took advantage of a partial RXR agonist, CBt-PMN, to minimize the adverse effects, and evaluated its efficacy in dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis. Administration of CBt-PMN efficiently ameliorated the symptoms of colitis. This effect was attributed to the down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Tnf and Il6 in colon-infiltrating monocytes. Down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines by CBt-PMN was also evident in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Among many RXR-associated nuclear receptors, activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ) and nuclear hormone receptor 77 (Nur77) suppressed cytokine production by BMDMs. These observations suggest that the activation of PPARδ/RXR and Nur77/RXR heterodimers by CBt-PMN through the permissive mechanism is responsible for diminishing the monocyte-mediated inflammatory response in the gut. Our data highlight the importance of RXR activation in the regulation of colitis.
1-[(3,5,5,8,8-pentamethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-yl)amino]benzotriazole-5-carboxylic acid (CBt-PMN), a partial agonist of retinoid X receptor (RXR), has attracted attention due to its potential to treat type 2 diabetes and central nervous system diseases with reduced adverse effects of existing full agonists. Herein, we report the crystal structure of CBt-PMN-bound ligand-binding domain of human RXRα (hRXRα) and its biochemical characterization. Interestingly, the structure is a tetramer in nature, in which CBt-PMNs are clearly found binding in two different conformations. The dynamics of the hRXRα/CBt-PMN complex examined using molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the flexibility of the AF-2 interface depends on the conformation of the ligand. These facts reveal that the dual conformation of CBt-PMN in the complex is probably the reason behind its partial agonistic activity.
Carotenoids are C-30, C-40 or C-50 terpenoids produced by a number of bacteria, fungi, and plants. In addition to acting as vitamin A precursors such as β-carotene, their dietary intake and blood plasma/serum and tissue levels have been associated in several epidemiological studies to the reduced incidence of chronic diseases, including the reduction of type 2 diabetes and other cardiometabolic diseases, as well as some types of cancer. Lutein and zeaxanthin also appear to play a role in the amelioration of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the main cause of blindness in the elderly, and may be regarded as conditionally essential nutrients for the elderly. Furthermore, some studies have proposed that carotenoids may improve cognitive functions. Though the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated, it is perceived that direct antioxidant effects and protection from UV-light, as well as rather indirect effects, acting on transcription factors such as NF-κB, Nrf-2, and nuclear receptors such as RAR/RXR (retinoic acid receptor/retinoid X receptor), altering gene expression, all can play a role. Despite individual intervention trials suggesting negative effects of high doses of β-carotene on smokers, perhaps due to effects related to cytochrome enzyme activation, there is accumulating evidence that these colourful pigments indeed contribute to a healthy life and well-being. However, further research is warranted to better understand factors influencing variable inter-individual responses following carotenoid consumption and to establish more detailed recommendations regarding their dietary intake and toward establishing health claims.
All trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) is used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and it is a promising agent also in solid tumors. The pharmacological activity of ATRA is mediated by the ligand-activated RAR and RXR transcription factors. In the present study, we define the basal and ATRA dependent RARα interactome in a RARα-overexpressing breast cancer cellular model, identifying 28 nuclear proteins. We focus our attention on the S100A3 calcium-binding protein, which interacts with RARα constitutively. In ATRA-sensitive breast cancer cells, S100A3 binds to RARα in basal conditions and binding is reduced by the retinoid. The interaction of S100A3 with RARα is direct and in lung cancer, APL and acute-myeloid-leukemia (AML) cells. In APL, S100A3 interacts not only with RARα, but also with PML-RARα. The interaction surface maps to the RARα ligand-binding domain, where the I396 residue plays a crucial role. Binding of S100A3 to RARα/PML-RARα controls the constitutive and ATRA-dependent degradation of these receptors. S100A3 knockdown decreases the amounts of RARα in breast- and lung cancer cells, inducing resistance to ATRA-dependent anti-proliferative/differentiating effects. Conversely, S100A3 knockdown in PML-RARα+ APL and PML-RARα- AML cells reduces the amounts of RARα/PML-RARα and increases basal and ATRA-induced differentiation. In this cellular context, opposite effects on RARα/PML-RARα levels and ATRA-induced differentiation are observed upon S100A3 overexpression. Our results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms controlling RARα activity and have practical implications, as S100A3 represents a novel target for rational drug combinations aimed at potentiating the activity of ATRA.
Retinoic acid (RA) promotes differentiation in multiple neurogenic cell types by promoting gene reprogramming through retinoid receptors and also by inducing cytosolic signaling events. The nuclear RXR receptors are one of the main mediators of RA cellular effects, classically by joining the direct receptors of RA, the nuclear RAR receptors, in RAR/RXR dimers which act as transcription factors. Distinct RXR genes lead to RXRα, RXRβ and RXRγ subtypes, but their specific roles in neuronal differentiation remain unclear. We firstly investigated both RXRs and RARs expression profiles during RA-mediated neuronal differentiation of human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y, and found varying levels of retinoid receptors transcript and protein contents along the process. In order to understand the roles of the expression of distinct RXR subtypes to RA signal transduction, we performed siRNA-mediated silencing of RXRα and RXRβ during the first stages of SH-SY5Y differentiation. Our results showed that RXRα is required for RA-induced neuronal differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells, since its silencing compromised cell cycle arrest and prevented the upregulation of neuronal markers and the adoption of neuronal morphology. Besides, silencing of RXRα affected the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. By contrast, silencing of RXRβ improved neurite extension and led to increased expression of tau and synaptophysin, suggesting that RXRβ may negatively regulate neuronal parameters related to neurite outgrowth and function. Our results indicate distinct functions for RXR subtypes during RA-dependent neuronal differentiation and reveal new perspectives for studying such receptors as clinical targets in therapies aiming at restoring neuronal function.
Loss of the gene von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) is associated with loss of primary cilia and is causally linked to elevated levels of Aurora kinase A (AURKA). We developed an image-based high-throughput screening (HTS) assay using a dual-labeling image analysis strategy that identifies both the cilium and the basal body. By using this strategy, we screened small-molecule compounds for the targeted rescue of cilia defects associated with VHL deficiency with high accuracy and reproducibility. Bexarotene was identified and validated as a positive regulator of the primary cilium. Importantly, the inability of an alternative retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist to rescue ciliogenesis, in contrast to bexarotene, suggested that multiple bexarotene-driven mechanisms were responsible for the rescue. We found that bexarotene decreased AURKA expression in VHL-deficient cells, thereby restoring the ability of these cells to ciliate in the absence of VHL Finally, bexarotene treatment reduced the propensity of subcutaneous lesions to develop into tumors in a mouse xenograft model of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), with a concomitant decrease in activated AURKA, highlighting the potential of bexarotene treatment as an intervention strategy in the clinic to manage renal cystogenesis associated with VHL deficiency and elevated AURKA expression.
To assess the effects of marginal vitamin A deficiency (MVAD) on rat Meibomian gland morphology as well as retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) amounts and localization.
Eight adult female rats were randomized into MVAD and vitamin A normal (VAN) groups, and fed vitamin A-deficient and normal control diets, respectively, for 3 weeks before mating. At postnatal week 4 (P4w), eight newborn animals in both groups were euthanized, respectively. Then, serum retinol levels were analyzed. Meibomian glands from P4w animals were further assessed upon hematoxylin and eosin staining. RAR and RXR gene and protein expression amounts were detected by real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), immunofluorescence and western blotting, respectively.
Secretory cell nuclei had reduced areas, while the multilayered squamous epithelium of the ductule was overtly thinner in MVAD rats compared with VAN animals. RXR-α showed highest mRNA amounts among all RA receptors; compared with control values, RXR-α showed overtly decreased mRNA amounts in animals with MVAD. In addition, compared with normal rats, MVAD rats had starkly lower RXR-α and RXR-γ expression levels. Furthermore, only the RXR-α protein was detected in the nucleus of cells forming the multilayered squamous epithelium of the ductule in VAN rats.
RARs and RXRs may be involved in the regulation of Meibomian gland function. RXR-α and 9-cis RA signaling affects Meibomian gland function, and the mechanisms of retinoids on secretory cells and the ductule epithelium may differ.
MVAD: marginal vitamin A deficiency; RAR: retinoic acid receptor; RXR: retinoid X receptor; VAN: vitamin A normal; RA: retinoic acid; RAREs: retinoic acid responsive elements; HPLC: high performance liquid chromatography; atRA: all-trans retinoic acid; MGD: Meibomian gland dysfunction; CRABPs: cellular retinoic acid-binding proteins.
Ampullariidae are unique among gastropods in that females normally show a primordium of the copulatory apparatus (CApp). The aims of this study were (a) to quantitatively evaluate the development and growth of the female CApp with age; (b) to compare the effects of RXR and PPARγ agonists in adult females of known age and (c) to explore the effect of masculinizing RXR agonists on the expression of RXR in the CApp. It was found that the CApp grows and develops with age. A significant increase in penile sheath length (PsL) and also in a developmental index (DI) was observed in 7-8 months old females, as compared with 4-5 months old ones. A reported endogenous agonist of RXR, 9-cis retinoic acid (9cis-RA), as well as two organotin compounds, tributyltin (TBT) and triphenyltin (TPT) which have been also reported to bind to RXR, were injected and its masculinizing effects were measured. Also, the effect of a PPARγ agonist, rosiglitazone, was studied. All studied RXR agonists, but not the PPARγ agonist, were effective in increasing PsL, penile length (PL) and DI. Finally, the expression of the RXR in the CApp was studied (Western blot) in control, TBT, TPT, and 9cis-RA treated females. A significantly increased expression of RXR was only observed after 9cis-RA treatment. It is concluded that (a) development and growth of the CApp is significantly affected by female age; (b) reported RXR agonists, but not a PPARγ agonist, cause female masculinization of young females. An appraisal of previous studies of female masculinization in the Ampullariidae has also been made and it is emphasized that the masculinizing effect of aging should be considered, particularly when interpreting field data.
Retinoid X Receptors (RXRs) act as dimer partners for several nuclear receptors including itself, binding to genomic DNA response elements and regulating gene transcription with cell and gene specificity. As homodimers, RXRs bind direct repeats of the half-site (A/G)G(G/T)TCA separated by 1 nucleotide (DR1) and little variability of this consensus site is observed for natural DR1s. However, these variations are responsible of the modulation of RXR receptors function through differential binding affinity and conformational changes. To further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying RXR-DNA interactions, we examined how RXR DBDs bind to different DR1s using thermodynamics, X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We show that the half-site sequences modulate the binding cooperativity that results from the protein-protein contacts between the two DBDs. Chemical shifts perturbation NMR experiments revealed that sequence variations in half-sites induce changes that propagate from the protein-DNA interface to the dimerization interface throughout the DBD fold.
Tumorigenesis is driven by stem cell (SC) overpopulation. Because ALDH is both a marker for SCs in many tissues and a key enzyme in retinoid acid (RA) signaling, we studied RA signaling in normal and malignant colonic SCs.
RA signaling regulates growth and differentiation of ALDH+ colonic SCs; dysregulation of RA signaling contributes to SC overpopulation and colorectal cancer (CRC) development.
We analyzed normal and malignant colonic tissues and CRC cell lines to see if retinoid receptors (RXR &amp; RAR) are exclusively expressed in ALDH+ SCs, and if RA signaling changes during CRC development. We determined whether RA signaling regulates cancer SC (CSC) proliferation, differentiation, sphere formation, and population size.
RXR &amp; RAR were expressed in ALDH+ colonic SCs, but not in MCM2+ proliferative cells. Western blotting/immunostaining of CRCs revealed that RA signaling components become overexpressed in parallel with ALDH overexpression, which coincides with the known overpopulation of ALDH+ SCs that occurs during, and drives, CRC development. Treatment of SCs with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) decreased proliferation, sphere formation and ALDH+ SC population size, and induced differentiation along the neuroendocrine cell (NEC) lineage.
Retinoid signaling, by regulating ALDH+ colonic CSCs, decreases SC proliferation, sphere formation, and population size, and increases SC differentiation to NECs. Dysregulation of RA signaling in colonic SCs likely contributes to overpopulation of ALDH+ SCs and CRC growth.
That retinoid receptors RXR and RAR are selectively expressed in ALDH+ SCs indicates RA signaling mainly occurs via ALDH+ SCs, which provides a mechanism to selectively target CSCs.
The discovery of novel ligand chemotypes allows to explore uncharted regions in chemical space, thereby potentially improving synthetic accessibility, potency, and the drug-likeness of molecules. Here, we demonstrate the scaffold-hopping ability of the new Weighted Holistic Atom Localization and Entity Shape (WHALES) molecular descriptors compared to seven state-of-the-art molecular representations on 30,000 compounds and 182 biological targets. In a prospective application, we apply WHALES to the discovery of novel retinoid X receptor (RXR) modulators. WHALES descriptors identified four agonists with innovative molecular scaffolds, populating uncharted regions of the chemical space. One of the agonists, possessing a rare non-acidic chemotype, revealed high selectivity on 12 nuclear receptors and comparable efficacy as bexarotene on induction of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1, angiopoietin like protein 4 and apolipoprotein E. The outcome of this research supports WHALES as an innovative tool to explore novel regions of the chemical space and to detect novel bioactive chemotypes by straightforward similarity searching.
Sarcomas are rare and heterogeneous cancer variants of mesenchymal origin. Their genetic heterogeneity coupled with uncertain histogenesis makes them difficult to treat and results in poor prognosis. In this work, we show that structure-based drug discovery involving computational modeling can be used to identify a new retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist ligand with a bis(indolyl)methane scaffold. This agent co-self-assembles with an amphiphilic diblock copolymer resulting in nanoparticles (Nano-RXR) with excellent kinetic stability, which were evaluated for efficacy and safety in transformed sarcoma cells, 63-3 Cre and 141-10 Cre of pig origin, and in rodent xenograft models. Responses at gene and protein levels established the treatment approach as a highly effective RXR agonist across cell, rodent, and "Oncopig" models. Interestingly, Nano-RXR was not only able to modulate metabolic and transporter genes related to orphan nuclear receptors but also played a major role in modulating programmed cell death in sarcomas developed in Oncopigs.
