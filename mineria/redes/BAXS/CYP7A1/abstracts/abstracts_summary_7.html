 'Small' heterodimer partner ( 'SHP;' 'NR0B2)' is an unusual orphan nuclear<b> receptor that lacks a conventional 'DNA-binding' domain and acts as a modulator of transcriptional activities of a number of nuclear receptors</b>.   <b> 'Herein,' we</b> report that the human 'SHP' promoter ( 'hSHP)' is activated by sterol regulatory 'element-binding' 'protein-1' ( 'SREBP-1),' which regulates the expression of various genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis.    'Overexpression' of 'SREBP-1' activated<b> the human but not mouse 'SHP' 'promoter,' although 'SREBP-2' had little effect on the 'SHP' promoter in 'CV-1' cells</b>.   <b> 'DNase' 'I' 'footprinting,' gel shift 'assays,' and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that 'SREBP-1'</b> binds directly to the hSHP promoter.   <b> 'This' mutation strongly</b> decreased both basal and 'SREBP-1' dependent activities of the hSHP 'promoter,' because of the reduced binding of 'SREBP-1' to the mutated 'SRE1'.   <b> 'We'</b> propose a possible role of 'SREBP-1' in the species differential regulation of cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis via a novel mechanism of 'up-regulation' of the hSHP<b> gene expression</b>.   <b> 'Small' heterodimer partner ( 'SHP;' 'NR0B2)' is an atypical orphan</b> nuclear receptor that lacks a conventional 'DNA' binding domain ( 'DBD)' and represses the transcriptional activity of various nuclear receptors.    'We' also showed that 'C-terminal' repression domain within 'SHP' is also required<b> for 'BETA2' repression</b>.    'However,' inhibition of 'BETA2' activity was not observed by naturally occurring human 'SHP' mutants that cannot interact<b> with 'BETA2/NeuroD'</b>.   <b> 'Taken' 'together,' these results</b> suggest that 'SHP' acts as a novel corepressor for basic 'helix-loop-helix' transcription factor 'BETA2/NeuroD' by competing with coactivator p300 for binding to 'BETA2/NeuroD' and by its direct transcriptional repression function.   <b> 'The'</b> orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner ( 'SHP;' 'NR0B2)' is an unusual orphan nuclear receptor that lacks a conventional 'DNA-binding' domain and acts as a modulator of transcriptional activities of a number of nuclear receptors.   <b> 'Our' findings</b> suggest that the 'E2A' proteins differentially regulate the human and mouse 'SHP' promoters and cooperate with orphan nuclear receptor 'SF-1' for transcriptional activation of the hSHP promoter.   <b> 'A' significant locus</b> associated with gallstone score on chromosome 17, named 'Lith9' ( susceptibility allele conferred by strain 'PERA/Ei),' colocalizes with the genes 'Abcg5' and 'Abcg8' that encode the canalicular cholesterol transporter.    'Our' findings suggest a primary role of the nuclear bile salt receptor<b> 'FXR'</b> and the canalicular cholesterol transporter 'ABCG5/ABCG8' in the genetic susceptibility and pathogenesis of cholesterol cholelithiasis in these strains of inbred mice.   <b> 'In' order to 'differentiate,' 'MSCs' were</b> induced by selection of 'nestin-expressing' cells and treatment with 100 'μg/mL' 'MPE'.   <b> 'Disrupted' bile secretion</b> leads to liver damage characterized by 'inflammation,' 'fibrosis,' eventually 'cirrhosis,' and hepatocellular cancer.   <b> 'Prominent' molecular events exhibited by strong transcript peaks are</b> found for the transcriptional regulator 'Nr0b2' ( 'Shp)' and 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin 'D(3)' 24-hydroxylase ( 'Cyp24a1)' at 6 '\240\h'.   <b> 'However,' 'p53-targeted' therapies</b> have limited application in lung 'cancer,' since p53 is found to be mutated in more than half of lung cancers.    'Moreover,' we showed that 'FOXA2-dependent' promoter activation of 'BAX' and p21 genes is significantly reduced via physical interactions between the identified binding<b> partners and 'FOXA2'</b>.    'Using' transient transfections in 'MA-10' 'Leydig' 'cells,' small interfering 'RNA' 'knockdown,' and a 'MEF2-Engrailed' dominant 'negative,' we found<b> that 'MEF2' activates the 'Por,' 'Bmal1,' and 'Nr0b2' promoters and that this requires an intact 'MEF2' element</b>.    'Furthermore,' spermatogonial stem cell ( 'SSC)' 'self-renewal,' differentiation and meiosis were significantly 'impaired,' and the epigenetic regulator 'G9a-mediated' histone methylation was decreased<b> following 'DEHP' exposure</b>.    'Three' 'PCOS-derived' and one 'non-PCOS-derived' hESC lines were induced<b> into 'adipocytes,' and then total 'RNA' was extracted</b>.   <b> 'These' genes include peptidoglycan recognition protein 2 </b>, dual specific 'phosphatase-4,' tetraspanin 4, thrombospondin 1, and 'SPARC-related' modular calcium binding 'protein-2,' which were validated by qPCR analysis of 126 human liver 'specimens,' including 'steatosis,' 'fibrosis,' and 'NASH,' alcohol and hepatitis 'C' 'cirrhosis,' and in mouse models of liver inflammation and injury.   <b> 'Although' 'Esr1-/-' male rats</b> have a<b> reduced body 'weight,' they exhibit increased adipose deposition and impaired glucose tolerance</b>.   <b> 'Pathway' analyses demonstrate that the differentially</b> expressed genes include transcriptional regulators ( 'Cry1,' 'Nr1d1,' 'Nr0b2),' transporters ( 'Slc1a2),' and regulators of biosynthesis ( 'Cyp7b1,' 'Cyp8b1),' and hormone metabolism ( 'Hsd17b2,' 'Sult1e1)'.   <b> 'At' 6 'hours,' dexamethasone treatment</b> decreased levels of 'NR0B2,' 'NR4A1,' 'NR5A1,' and 'NR5A2' messenger 'RNAs' ( 'mRNAs)' and 'NR5A2' mRNA levels remained depressed at 12 hours.    'Inflammatory' reaction plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of acquired hearing loss<b> such as ototoxicity and labyrinthitis</b>.   <b> 'Nuclear-Receptors' represent ideal</b> targets for the 'design/synthesis' of pharmacological ligands.    'ERRgamma' transactivation is dependent on only one of five previously characterized 'DNA-binding' sites for 'SF-1,' and this element differs from previously reported<b> 'ERR' response elements</b>.   <b> 'It'</b> was found that podocyte cell cycle 're-entry' could be induced by adriamycin as early as the 1 st week in vivo and the 2 nd hour in 'vitro,' accompanied with '4E-BP1' activation and was followed by podocyte loss or apoptosis from the 4 th week in vivo or the 4 th hour in vitro.   <b> 'Excessive' or inappropriate inflammatory responses can</b> cause<b> serious and even fatal diseases</b>.   <b> 'MTL-CEBPA,' a small</b> activating 'RNA' targeting for upregulation of 'C/EBPα,' is currently being evaluated in a phase 1 b trial for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.    'In' 'addition,' a 'Luminex' analysis of mouse serum revealed that 'MTL-CEBPA' reduced 'pro-inflammatory' cytokines and increased<b> the 'anti-inflammatory' cytokine 'IL-10'</b>.    'Objective' 'To' observe the effect of 'low-frequency' pulsed electromagnetic 'fields(PEMFs)' on bone formation in rat 'osteoblasts(ROBs)' and explore the mechanism of action of the cyclic adenosine 'monophosphate(cAMP)/protein' kinase 'A(PKA)/cyclic' adenosine effect binding<b> 'protein(CREB)' signaling pathway</b>.   <b> 'Conclusion' 'PEMFs'</b> promote bone formation in 'ROBs' by activating the primary 'cilia-associated' 'cAMP/PKA/CREB' signaling pathway.   <b> 'Let-7-related' polymorphisms</b> have been reported to be associated with tumorigenesis and prognosis.    'Protein' structural vibrations impact biology by steering the structure to functional intermediate 'states;' enhancing<b> tunneling 'events;' and optimizing energy transfer</b>.    'North' 'Indian' subjects with cADR due to an 'AED,' and those who were 'AED-tolerant' were recruited<b> as cases and 'controls,' respectively</b>.    'The' presence of excessive oxidative stress in aged kidney may play a role since high levels of oxidation increased<b> 'ER' 'stress-induced' cell death and decreased 'IRE1' levels and 'XBP-1' splicing</b>.   <b> 'Previous' research</b> has observed that 'β-asarone' effectively attenuated symptoms in parkinsonian rats and improved their 'performance,' but the mechanism of this effect remains unclear.    'However,' our group observed that 'ER' stress and<b> autophagy</b> occurred in 6-hydroxy dopamine ( 6-'OHDA)-induced' parkinsonian 'rats,' and 'ER' stress might induce autophagy.    'Innate' immunity is a system that recognizes<b> primarily and excludes pathogenic microorganism</b>.    'Engineering' of functionalized 'RNA-binding' proteins ( 'RBPs)' could therefore have<b> many applications</b>.   <b> 'Multiple' 'metabolic,' immune and reproductive effects</b> have been reported in fish residing in 'effluent-impacted' sites.    'In' 'total,' 3463 isoforms were differentially transcribed<b> between sites</b>.   <b> evolocumab and 'alirocumab,' both</b> reported a 15 '%' reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events.   <b> 'Newer' agents</b> targeting 'PCSK9' are in clinical development with a major interest in those with a longer duration of 'action,' e.   <b> 'RESULTS' 'Phactr-1' knockdown</b> suppressed bEnd.    'These' findings indicate that the expression of the 'Phactr-1' should be studied further in the cerebral 'microvasculature,' both in vitro and in 'vivo,' regarding its potential as a diagnostic and therapeutic target<b> for cerebral microvascular disease</b>.    'To' test if we could treat 'CAP2-KO' 'mice,' we synthesized<b> and tested the 'SRF' inhibitor 'CCG-1423-8u'</b>.    'The' median survival of 'CAP2-CKO' mice was 98 'days,' while 'CCG-1423-8u-treated' 'CKO' mice survived for 116 days and also maintained<b> normal cardiac function longer</b>.    'The' 'RNA-binding' protein 'GRSF1' ( 'G-rich' 'RNA' 'sequence-binding' factor<b> 1)</b> critically maintains<b> mitochondrial homeostasis</b>.   <b> 'Thus,' 'RNA-binding' proteins</b> provide a uniquely complex regulatory code that orchestrates mitochondrial function during physiological and pathological conditions.    'These' data are consistent with a role for the 'MA' domain of retroviral 'Gag' proteins in modulating<b> nucleic acid binding and chaperone activity</b>.   <b> 'Since' 'BLV' infection</b> has serious implications for 'agriculture,' and given its similarities to human retroviruses such as 'HTLV-1,' the development of an effective treatment would have numerous benefits.   <b> 'Further,' important metabolic switches</b> triggered by this interaction with 'ECM' were indicated by decreases in the phosphorylation of 'hexokinase,' 'phosphofructokinase,' 'fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase,' 'phosphoglucomutase,' phosphoglycerate kinase in 'MTy'.   <b> 'Putative' kinases</b> involved in protein phosphorylation altered upon parasite incubation with 'ECM' were suggested by in silico analysis.    'Most' of the mRNAs discovered as being locally translated<b> have been identified from hippocampal neurons because their laminar organization facilitates 'neurite-specific' dissection and microscopy methods</b>.   <b> 'Modelling' studies</b> reveal conformational dynamics influence 'structure-function' relationships of 'AlkB' and 'FTO,' e.   <b> 'Further' validation showed that 'HSV-1' and 'HSV-2' shared the common sequence</b> binding to 'Oct-1,' but had unique sequences to bind 'v-Myb' and 'Pax-6,' or 'Hairy,' 'respectively,' by 'DNA' sequence alignment of total 11 'HSV' strains.   <b> 'Many' mRNAs and lncRNAs</b> interacted with other molecules in a competing endogenous 'RNA' 'network,' such as 'MAS1,' 'TMPRSS2,' 'NPTX1,' 'XLOC_016191,' 'XLOC_026924' and 'XLOC_005439'.    'Caveolins' ( 'CAVs)' are structural proteins of caveolae that function as signaling platforms to regulate<b> smooth muscle contraction</b>.   <b> 'Upregulating' 'SMAD3'</b> induced the expression of 'STYK1' in ovarian cancer cell lines.   <b> 'Both' viral 'E6' and 'E7'</b> decreased 'NOVA1' 'expression,' but only 'E7' increased the expression of 'RNASEH2A' in an 'E2F1-dependent' manner.   <b> 'IMPORTANCE' 'High-risk' 'HPV' infections</b> lead to development of cervical cancer.   <b> 'Neonatal' sepsis remains</b> a leading cause of infant mortality.   <b> 'Therefore,' 'C23'</b> has promising therapeutic potential in treatment of neonatal sepsis.   <b> 'DNA' hydroxymethylation</b> has gained attention as an intermediate in the process of 'DNA' demethylation.   <b> 'More' 'recently,' 5-hydroxymethylcytosine</b> has been recognized as an independent epigenetic mark that can persist over time and that exerts influence on gene regulation and other biological processes.   <b> 'Additionally,' 'IL-6'</b> stimulated the mouse double minute 2 homolog ( 'MDM2)-mediated' proteasomal degradation of p53 by reducing the availability of ribosomal protein used for 'MDM2' 'binding,' thus resulting in the downregulation of p53 protein expression.   <b> 'Accurately' identifying 'protein⁻RNA'</b> binding hot spots is critical for drug designing and protein engineering.   <b> 'Recent' advances</b> have enabled 'transcriptome-wide' maps of 'RNA' secondary 'structure,' called '\'' 'RNA' 'structuromes\''.   <b> 'Considering' solid recent evidences regarding 'PLC?' as the main sperm factor</b> involved in oocyte 'activation,' therefore 'co-localization' of 'PLC?' with 'PAWP' in perinuclear 'theca\240\may' account for the above observation and it is likely that 'PAWP' may have other functions 'and/or' it may assist 'PLC?'.   <b> 'Target' molecules</b> bound by 'CIRP' were determined using 'RNA-binding' protein immunoprecipitation and microarray analysis.   <b> 'Two' bisubstrate analogues</b> bind 'RlmJ' with 'micro-molar' 'affinity,' and could serve as starting scaffolds for inhibitor design against m6A 'RNA' 'MTases'.    'Thus,' optimization of these molecular scaffolds for m6A 'RNA' 'MTase' inhibition should aim to increase<b> 'selectivity,' as well as affinity</b>.   <b> 'YTHDF2' depletion</b> increased the expression and stability of 'MAP2K4' and 'MAP4K4' mRNAs.   <b> coli cannot grow at the supercoil density</b> maintained by wild type ( 'WT)' 'Salmonella'.   <b> 'Furthermore,' ribosomal</b> binding antibiotics alter protein quinary structure through 'protein-ribosome' and 'protein-mRNA-ribosome' interactions.   <b> 'Silencing' 'METTL3'</b> enhances autophagic flux and inhibits apoptosis in 'H/R-treated' cardiomyocytes.
