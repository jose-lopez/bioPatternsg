<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>	<meta charset="utf-8">	<title>generación de archivo html</title></head><body>Huntington disease (HD), an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by an abnormal expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeat in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene, is characterized by extensive neurodegeneration of striatum and cortex and severe diffuse atrophy at MRI. The expression of genes involved in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway and the amount of cholesterol, lanosterol, lathosterol and 24S-hydroxycholesterol were reduced in murine models of HD. In case of HD-patients, the decrease of plasma 24OHC follows disease progression proportionally to motor and neuropsychiatric dysfunction and MRI brain atrophy, together with lanosterol and lathosterol (markers of cholesterol synthesis), and 27-hydroxycholesterol. A significant reduction of total plasma cholesterol was observed only in advanced stages. It is likely that mutant HTT decreases the maturation of SREBP and the up-regulation LXR and LXR-targeted genes (SREBP, ABCG1 and ABCG4, HMGCoA reductase, ApoE) resulting into a lower synthesis and transport of cholesterol from astrocytes to neurons via ApoE. In primary oligodendrocytes, mutant HTT inhibited the regulatory effect of PGC1α on cholesterol metabolism and on the expression of MBP. HTT seems to play a regulatory role in lipid metabolism. The impairment of the cholesterol metabolism was found to be proportional to the CAG repeat length and to the load of mutant HTT. A dysregulation on PGC1α and mitochondria dysfunction may be involved in an overall reduction of acetyl-CoA and ATP synthesis, contributing to the cerebral and whole body cholesterol impairment.

Chronic ethanol consumption causes hepatic steatosis and inflammation, which are associated with liver hypoxia. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a hypoxia response factor that determines recruitment and activation of monocytes to the site of tissue injury. The level of MCP-1 is elevated in the serum and liver of patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD); however, the molecular details regarding the regulation of MCP-1 expression are not yet understood completely. Here, we show the role of liver X receptor α (LXRα) in the regulation of MCP-1 expression during the development of ethanol-induced fatty liver injury, using an antagonist, 22-S-hydroxycholesterol (22-S-HC). First, administration of 22-S-HC attenuated the signs of liver injury with decreased levels of MCP-1 and its receptor CCR2 in ethanol-fed mice. Second, hypoxic conditions or treatment with the LXRα agonist GW3965 significantly induced the expression of MCP-1, which was completely blocked by treatment with 22-S-HC or infection by shLXRα lentivirus in the primary hepatocytes. Third, over-expression of LXRα or GW3965 treatment increased MCP-1 promoter activity by increasing the binding of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α to the hypoxia response elements, together with LXRα. Finally, treatment with recombinant MCP-1 increased the level of expression of LXRα and LXRα-dependent lipid droplet accumulation in both hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. These data show that LXRα and its ligand-induced up-regulation of MCP-1 and MCP-1-induced LXRα-dependent lipogenesis play a key role in the autocrine and paracrine activation of MCP-1 in the pathogenesis of alcoholic fatty liver disease, and that this activation may provide a promising new target for ALD therapy.
Oleic (OA) and linoleic (LA) fatty acids may be important regulators of Slc2a4 gene (GLUT4 protein) in skeletal muscle, thus participating in insulin resistance. We investigated the effect of OA and LA on the Slc2a4/GLUT4 expression in L6 muscle cells; as well as potential transcriptional regulators. OA and LA (50-400 µM) decreased the Slc2a4/GLUT4 expression in a dose-dependent way (maximum of ~50%, P &lt; 0.001). OA and LA did not alter the Slc2a4-binding activity of oxysterols-receptor-LXR-alpha and peroxisome-proliferator-activated-receptor-gamma; but decreased the Slc2a4-binding activity of the sterol-regulatory-element-binding-protein-1 (SREBP1) enhancer (50%, P &lt; 0.001), and increased (~30%, P &lt; 0.001) the nuclear proteins binding into the Slc2a4-nuclear-factor-NF-kappa-B-binding site (repressor), and the phosphorylation of the inhibitors of nuclear-factor-kappa-B-kinase alpha/beta (150-300%, P &lt; 0.001). In sum, OA and LA are potent inhibitors of the Slc2a4/GLUT4 expression in muscle cells; an effect involving reduced SREBP1 and increased NFKB transcriptional activity. These regulations may participate in the fatty acid-related pathophysiology of insulin resistance. 
Vitamin E membrane transport has been shown to involve the cholesterol transporters SR-BI, ABCA1 and NPC1L1. Our aim was to investigate the possible participation of another cholesterol transporter in cellular vitamin E efflux: ABCG1. In Abcgl-deficient mice, vitamin E concentration was reduced in plasma lipoproteins whereas most tissues displayed a higher vitamin E content compared to wild-type mice. α- and γ-tocopherol efflux was increased in CHO cells overexpressing human ABCG1 compared to control cells. Conversely, α- and γ- tocopherol efflux was decreased in ABCG1-knockdown human cells (Hep3B hepatocytes and THP-1 macro- phages). Interestingly, α- and γ-tocopherol significantly downregulated ABCG1 and ABCA1 expression levels in Hep3B and THP-1, an effect confirmed in vivo in rats given vitamin E for 5 days. This was likely due to reduced LXR activation by oxysterols, as Hep3B cells and rat liver treated with vitamin E displayed a significantly reduced content in oxysterols compared to their respective controls. Overall, the present study reveals for the first time that ABCG1 is involved in cellular vitamin E efflux.
Cholesterol is a risk factor for breast cancer although the mechanisms by which this occurs are not well understood. One hypothesis is that dyslipidemia results in increased cholesterol content in cell membranes, thus impacting upon membrane fluidity and subsequent signaling. In addition, studies demonstrate that the metabolite, 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC), can function as an estrogen, increasing the proliferation of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cells. This was unexpected because 27HC and other oxysterols activate the liver X receptors (LXR), resulting in a reduction of intracellular cholesterol. Resolution of this paradox will require dissection of the molecular mechanisms by which ER and LXR converge in breast cancer cells. Regardless, the observation that 27HC influences breast cancer provides a rationale for strategies that target cholesterol metabolism. 
Despite increased survivorship among patients, breast cancer remains the most common cancer among women and is the second leading cause of cancer death in women. The magnitude of this problem provides a strong impetus for new chemopreventative strategies and/or lifestyle changes that reduce cancer incidence. It is of significance, therefore, that several studies positively correlate obesity to the development of breast cancer. Importantly, obesity is also highly associated with elevated cholesterol, and cholesterol itself is a risk factor for breast cancer. Furthermore, patients taking statins demonstrate a lower breast cancer incidence and decreased recurrence. The recent observation that 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC) is produced in a stoichiometric manner from cholesterol, together with our recent demonstration that it exerts partial agonist activity on both the estrogen and liver X receptors, suggested a potential mechanistic link between hyper-cholesterolemia and breast cancer incidence. Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we have recently shown that elevation of circulating 27HC significantly increases tumor growth and metastasis in murine models of breast cancer. Further, we have demonstrated in appropriate animal models that the impact of high-fat diet on tumor pathogenesis can be mitigated by statins or by small molecule inhibitors of CYP27A1. These findings suggest that pharmacological or dietary modifications that lower total cholesterol, and by inference 27HC, are likely to reduce the impact of obesity/metabolic syndrome on breast cancer incidence.
Recent studies have revealed critical roles that nuclear receptors like LXR-α (Liver X Receptor- alpha) plays as a class of post-transcriptional gene regulator in skin development and diseases. Keeping in view the fact that LXR-α plays crucial role in keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, it becomes imperative to dissect the pathways and role of LXR-α genomics in the pathogenesis of psoriasis with ultimate aim to explore novel preventive/therapeutic strategies as treatment options. To explore the effects of agonists and activators of LXR-α on its own gene expression and the putative targets in psoriatic keratinocytes. Identification of promoter sequences for (vitamin D receptor) VDR and Catalase were done using in silico analysis followed by β-galactosidase (β-gal) reporter plasmid assay in keratinocytes from clinically heathy subjects. Determination of relative levels of LXR-α,VDR and catalase in control versus treated cells upon activation of LXR-α with Atorvastatin + 22R hydroxycholestrol and Ascorbic acid + 22R hydroxycholestrol was done by PCR and Cell Proliferation Assay. The cells transfected with the reporter plasmid element for VDR and catalase showed more than 5 and 4 fold increase respectively in the β-gal activity compared to the control. An increase of 55% in LXR-α gene expression at RNA level was observed in Atorvastatin + 22-R hydroxycholestrol compared to 24% in Ascorbic acid + 22-ROH cholesterol. The expression of the VDR and Catalase was significantly increased in both treated keratinocytes compared to its normal counterpart.
Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is characterized histopathologically by the deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles-containing hyperphosphorylated tau protein in the brain. Parkinson's disease (PD), the most common movement disorder, is characterized by the aggregation of α-synuclein protein in Lewy body inclusions and the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Based on their pathological signatures, AD and PD can be considered as two different disease entities. However, a subpopulation of PD patients also exhibit Aβ plaques, and AD patients exhibit α-synuclein aggregates. This overlap between PD and AD suggests that common pathological pathways exist for the two diseases. Identification of factors and cellular mechanisms by which these factors can trigger pathological hallmarks for AD/PD overlap may help in designing disease-modifying therapies that can reverse or stop the progression of AD and PD. For the last decade, work in our laboratory has shown that fluctuations in the levels of cholesterol oxidation products (oxysterols) may correlate with the onset of AD and PD. In this review, we will provide results from our laboratory and data from literature that converge to strongly suggest the involvement of cholesterol and cholesterol oxidation products in the pathogenesis of AD and PD. We will specifically delineate the role of and the underlying mechanisms by which increased levels of the oxysterol 27-hydroxycholesterol contribute to the pathogenesis of AD, PD, and AD/PD overlap. 
The Liver X Receptors (LXRs) are critical transcriptional regulators of cellular metabolism that promote cholesterol efflux and lipogenesis in response to excess intracellular cholesterol. In contrast, the Sterol Response Element Binding Protein-2 (SREBP2) promotes the synthesis and uptake of cholesterol. Oxysterols are products of cholesterol oxidation that accumulate in conditions associated with increased cellular levels of reactive oxygen species, such as hypoxia and oxidative stress, activating LXR and inhibiting SREBP2. While hypoxia and oxidative stress are commonly implicated in placental injury, the impact of the transcriptional regulation of cholesterol homeostasis on placental function is not well characterized.
We measured the effects of the synthetic LXR ligand T0901317 and the endogenous oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol (25OHC) on differentiation, cytotoxicity, progesterone synthesis, lipid droplet formation, and gene expression in primary human trophoblasts.
Exposure to T0901317 promoted lipid droplet formation and inhibited differentiation, while 25OHC induced trophoblast toxicity, promoted hCG and progesterone release at lower concentrations with inhibition at higher concentrations, and had no effect on lipid droplet formation. The discrepant effect of these ligands was associated with distinct changes in expression of LXR and SREBP2 target genes, with upregulation of ABCA1 following 25OHC and T090317 exposure, exclusive activation of the lipogenic LXR targets SREBP1c, ACC1 and FAS by T0901317, and exclusive inhibition of the SREBP2 targets LDLR and HMGCR by 25OHC.
These findings implicate cholesterol oxidation as a determinant of trophoblast function and activity, and suggest that placental gene targets and functional pathways are selectively regulated by specific LXR ligands.
Preeclampsia is a serious pregnancy complication. Soluble endoglin (sEng) is released from the placenta and contributes to the maternal endothelial dysfunction seen in preeclampsia. Recently oxysterols, which activate the Liver X Receptor (LXR), have been implicated in producing sEng, by upregulating matrix metalloproteinase-14 (MMP14; cleaves endoglin to produce sEng) and down-regulating tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3; inhibitor of MMP14). The functional experiments in that study were performed on JAR cells (human choriocarcinoma cell line) and placental explants.
We characterized LXR in severe preeclamptic placentas, and assessed whether oxysterols increase release of sEng from primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), primary trophoblasts and placental explants. Given pravastatin is thought to block oxysterol production and inhibit the LXR, we examined whether pravastatin reduces sEng release.
LXRα and β were localized to the syncytiotrophoblast and villous tips and were significantly up-regulated in preeclamptic placenta. Oxysterols upregulated sEng production in HUVECs and placental explants although the increases were far more modest than that recently reported. Oxysterols did not upregulate sEng in primary trophoblasts. Furthermore, mRNA expression of MMP14 and TIMP-3 were not altered by oxysterols in any tissue. Surprisingly, pravastatin did not decrease oxysterol-induced upregulation of sEng.
LXR is up-regulated in preeclamptic placenta. Oxysterols upregulate sEng production from human tissues, but the increase is modest, suggesting this may not be the main mechanism for the very significant elevations in sEng seen in preeclampsia. Pravastatin does not decrease sEng production.
Oxysterols modestly up-regulate sEng production which is not quenched by pravastatin.
Abnormal lipid metabolism may contribute to the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) protein mediates the transport of cholesterol and phospholipids from cells to apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) to generate nascent HDL particles. Previous studies revealed that overexpression of ABCA1 or apoA-I alleviated hepatic lipid levels by modifying lipid transport. Here, we examined the effect of apoA-I and ABCA1 overexpression on genes involved in fatty acid synthesis in QSG-7701 hepatocytes and in mice. Human apoA-I and ABCA1 were overexpressed by transfection in QSG-7701 hepatocytes. Human apoA-I was also overexpressed via an adenoviral vector in C57BL/6J mice fed a methionine choline-deficient diet. Overexpression of either apoA-I or ABCA1 resulted in an increase in cholesterol efflux and a decrease in cellular cholesterol, fatty acids, and triglycerides. Overexpression of these genes also resulted in a reduction in 27-hydroxycholesterol levels and a decrease in the mRNA levels of fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1. Overexpression of apoA-I in mice reduced hepatic lipid levels, 27-hydroxycholesterol levels, and the mRNA levels of fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1. These results suggest that expression of apoA-I or ABCA1 can reduce steatosis by decreasing lipid storage and modifying lipid transport in hepatocytes and may also inhibit fatty acid synthesis by decreasing 27-hydroxycholesterol levels.
Oxysterols are involved in maintaining cellular cholesterol levels. Recently, oxysterols have been demonstrated to modulate the function of immune cells and tumor growth. These effects can be dependent on the activation of the oxysterol-binding liver X receptors (LXRs) or, as recently demonstrated for T and B cells, DCs and neutrophils, can be independent of LXR activation. LXR-dependent oxysterol effects can be ascribed to the activation of LXRα, LXRβ or LXRαβ isoforms, which induces transcriptional activation or trans-repression of target genes. The prevalent activation of one isoform seems to be cell-, tissue-, or context-specific, as shown in some pathologic processes, i.e., infectious diseases, atherosclerosis, and autoimmunity. Oxysterol-LXR signaling has recently been shown to inhibit antitumor immune responses, as well as to modulate tumor cell growth. Here, we review the mechanisms that link oxysterols to tumor growth, and discuss possible networks at the basis of LXR-dependent and -independent oxysterol effects on immune cells and tumor development. 
Cholesterosis is a disease of cholesterol metabolism characterized by the presence of excessive lipid droplets in the cytoplasm. These lipid droplets are mainly composed of cholesterol esters derived from free cholesterol. The removal of excess cholesterol from gallbladder epithelial cells (GBECs) is very important for the maintenance of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis and the preservation of gallbladder function. Several lines of evidence have indicated that the activation of either peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) or liver X receptor α (LXRα) relates to cholesterol efflux. While pioglitazone can regulate the activation of PPARγ, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol can activate LXRα and is a metabolic intermediate in the biosynthesis of steroid hormones. However, the effect of 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol in combination with pioglitazone on cholesterosis of the gallbladder is unclear. GBECs were treated with pioglitazone, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol or PPARγ siRNA followed by Western blot analysis for ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), PPARγ and LXRα. Cholesterol efflux to apoA-I was determined, and Oil Red O staining was performed to monitor variations in lipid levels in treated GBECs. Our data showed that 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol can modestly up-regulate LXRα while simultaneously increasing ABCA1 by 56%. The combination of 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and pioglitazone resulted in a 3.64-fold increase in ABCA1 expression and a high rate of cholesterol efflux. Oil Red O staining showed an obvious reduction in the lipid droplets associated with cholesterosis in GBECs. In conclusion, the present findings indicate that the anti-lipid deposition action of 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol combined with pioglitazone involves the activation of the PPARγ-LXRα-ABCA1 pathway, increased ABCA1 expression and the efflux of cholesterol from GBECs. Thus, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol synergistically combined with pioglitazone to produce a remarkable effect on lipid deposition in cholesterosis GBECs.
Cholesterol plays an indispensable role in regulating the properties of cell membranes in mammalian cells. Accumulation of cholesterol and its intermediates, such as oxysterols, lead to activation of the nuclear receptors LXRs (liver X receptors). LXR is an important regulator of cholesterol homoeostasis by controlling its transport and its neo-synthesis. Accumulating evidence indicates that the endogenous ligands of LXRs, oxysterols, play an active and important role in regulating the fate and function of immune cells. Indeed, LXRs are negative regu-lators of innate immunity by interfering with macrophage activation. Recent advances have highlighted a controversial role for LXR in cancer. In this issue of the Biochemical Journal, Wang et al. propose that LXR agonist directly controls IFN-γ (interferon-γ) expression, which limits tumour growth. This protective effect mediated by LXR appears to be dependent on IFN-γ. Thus, despite accumulation of endogenous ligand of LXR in cancer, activation of LXR seems protective. This novel evidence provides a new perspective for targeting LXR in cancer, although controversial studies can be also found in the literature. In order to avoid side effects associated with LXR agonists, molecular and cellular studies are required to decipher this unexpected action of LXRs. 
The liver X receptors (LXRs) are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily that regulate sterol metabolism and inflammation. We sought to identify previously unknown genes regulated by LXRs in macrophages and to determine their contribution to atherogenesis. Here we characterize a novel LXR target gene, the lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) gene. Surprisingly, the ability of LXRs to control LBP expression is cell-type specific, occurring in macrophages but not liver. Treatment of macrophages with oxysterols or loading with modified LDL induces LBP in an LXR-dependent manner, suggesting a potential role for LBP in the cellular response to cholesterol overload. To investigate this further, we performed bone marrow transplant studies. After 18 weeks of Western diet feeding, atherosclerotic lesion burden was assessed revealing markedly smaller lesions in the LBP(-/-) recipients. Furthermore, loss of bone marrow LBP expression increased apoptosis in atherosclerotic lesions as determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling staining. Supporting in vitro studies with isolated macrophages showed that LBP expression does not affect cholesterol efflux but promotes the survival of macrophages in the setting of cholesterol loading. The LBP gene is a macrophage-specific LXR target that promotes foam cell survival and atherogenesis.
24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24S-OHC) which is enzymatically produced in the brain plays important physiological roles in maintaining brain cholesterol homeostasis. We found that 24S-OHC at sub-lethal concentrations down-regulated amyloid precursor protein (APP) trafficking via enhancement of the complex formation of APP with up-regulated glucose-regulated protein 78, an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone. In accordance with this mechanism, 24S-OHC suppressed amyloid-β production in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, 24S-OHC at sub-lethal concentrations induced adaptive responses via transcriptional activation of the liver X receptor signaling pathway, thereby protecting neuronal cells against the forthcoming oxidative stress induced by 7-ketocholesterol. On the other hand, we found that high concentrations of 24S-OHC induced apoptosis in T-lymphoma Jurkat cells which endogenously expressed caspase-8, and induced necroptosis - a form of programmed necrosis - in neuronal SH-SY5Y cells which expressed no caspase-8. In this Article, we show the diverse functions of 24S-OHC and consider the possible importance of controlling 24S-OHC levels in the brain for preventing neurodegenerative diseases. 
The regulation of the ABCD2 gene is recognized as a possible therapeutic target for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, a rare neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene. Up-regulation of ABCD2 expression has indeed been demonstrated to compensate for ABCD1 deficiency, restoring peroxisomal β-oxidation of very-long-chain fatty acids. Besides the known inducers of the ABCD2 gene (phenylbutyrate and histone deacetylase inhibitors, fibrates, dehydroepiandrosterone, thyroid hormone and thyromimetics), this review will focus on LXR antagonists and 22S-hydroxycholesterol, recently described as inducers of ABCD2 expression. Several LXR antagonists have been identified and their possible indication for neurodegenerative disorders will be discussed. 
Intracellular lipid accumulation, inflammatory responses, and subsequent apoptosis are the major pathogenic events of metabolic disorders, including atherosclerosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases. Recently, a novel regulatory oxysterol, 5-cholesten-3b, 25-diol 3-sulfate (25HC3S), has been identified, and hydroxysterol sulfotransferase 2B1b (SULT2B1b) has been elucidated as the key enzyme for its biosynthesis from 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) via oxysterol sulfation. The product 25HC3S and the substrate 25HC have been shown to coordinately regulate lipid metabolism, inflammatory responses, and cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. 25HC3S decreases levels of the nuclear liver oxysterol receptor (LXR) and sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), inhibits SREBP processing, subsequently downregulates key enzymes in lipid biosynthesis, decreases intracellular lipid levels in hepatocytes and THP-1-derived macrophages, prevents apoptosis, and promotes cell proliferation in liver tissues. Furthermore, 25HC3S increases nuclear PPARγ and cytosolic IκBα and decreases nuclear NF-κB levels and proinflammatory cytokine expression and secretion when cells are challenged with LPS and TNFα. In contrast to 25HC3S, 25HC, a known LXR ligand, increases nuclear LXR and decreases nuclear PPARs and cytosol IκBα levels. In this review, we summarize our recent findings, including the discovery of the regulatory oxysterol sulfate, its biosynthetic pathway, and its functional mechanism. We also propose that oxysterol sulfation functions as a regulatory signaling pathway. 
The two Liver X Receptors, LXRα and LXRβ, are nuclear receptors belonging to the superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors. They share more than 78% homology in amino acid sequence, a common profile of oxysterol ligands and the same heterodimerization partner, Retinoid X Receptor. LXRs play crucial roles in several metabolic pathways: lipid metabolism, in particular in preventing cellular cholesterol accumulation; glucose homeostasis; inflammation; central nervous system functions and water transport. As with all nuclear receptors, the transcriptional activity of LXR is the result of an orchestration of numerous cellular factors including ligand bioavailability, presence of corepressors and coactivators and cellular context i.e., what other pathways are activated in the cell at the time the receptor recognizes its ligand. In this mini-review we summarize the factors regulating the transcriptional activity and the mechanisms of action of these two receptors. 
Because macrophages respond to a variety of pathological and pharmacological reagents, understanding the role of P450s in macrophages is important for therapeutic intervention. There has been a lack of research on CYP4 in macrophages, but fatty acid accumulation and lipid trafficking in macrophages have been suggested to be a main cause of atherosclerosis. All human CYP4 genes (n=12) were screened in THP1 macrophages by gene-specific reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Only CYP4V2 exhibited strong expression of both mRNA and protein. Expression levels of both CYP4V2 mRNA and protein were significantly reduced after treatment with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) antagonist GW9662. However, the expression levels of CYP4V2 were not changed by PPARα antagonist (GW6471) and liver X receptor alpha antagonist (22-S hydroxycholesterol). A metabolite of the CYP4V2 enzyme, 12-hydroxydodecanoic acid, was detected in THP1 macrophages, and this metabolite was significantly decreased after treatment with the PPARγ inhibitor GW9662 (&gt;80% decreased, p&lt;0.05). In summary, fatty acid metabolizing protein CYP4V2 was identified in human THP1 macrophages, and its expression was regulated by PPARγ. Further study is required to understand the role of CYP4V2 with regard to fat accumulation in the activated macrophage and atherosclerotic plaque development.
Several studies have suggested an etiological role for hypercholesterolemia in the pathogenesis of breast cancer and prostate cancer (PCa). However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie and mediate the hypercholesterolemia-fostered increased risk for breast cancer and PCa are yet to be determined. The discovery that the most abundant cholesterol oxidized metabolite in the plasma, 27 hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC), is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) and an agonist of Liver X receptors (LXR) partially fills the void in our understanding and knowledge of the mechanisms that may link hypercholesterolemia to development and progression of breast cancer and PCa. The wide spectrum and repertoire of SERM and LXR-dependent effects of 27-OHC in the context of all facets and aspects of breast cancer and prostate cancer biology are reviewed in this manuscript in a very comprehensive manner. This review highlights recent findings pertaining to the role of 27-OHC in breast cancer and PCa and delineates the signaling mechanisms involved in the governing of different facets of tumor biology, that include tumor cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as well as tumor cell invasion, migration, and metastasis. We also discuss the limitations of contemporary studies and lack of our comprehension of the entire gamut of effects exerted by 27-OHC that may be relevant to the pathogenesis of breast cancer and PCa. We unveil and propose potential future directions of research that may further our understanding of the role of 27-OHC in breast cancer and PCa and help design therapeutic interventions against endocrine therapy-resistant breast cancer and PCa.
Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) catalyzes the hydrolysis of triglycerides from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins such as VLDL and chylomicrons in the circulation. Mutations in LPL or its activator apolipoprotein C-II cause hypertriglyceridemia in humans and animal models. The levels of LPL in the liver are low but they can be strongly induced by a high cholesterol diet or by synthetic ligands of Liver X Receptors (LXRs). However, the mechanism by which LXRs activate the human LPL gene is unknown. In the present study we show that LXR agonists increased the mRNA and protein levels as well as the promoter activity of human LPL in HepG2 cells. A promoter deletion analysis defined the proximal -109/-28 region, which contains a functional FOXA2 element, as essential for transactivation by ligand-activated LXRα/RXRα heterodimers. Silencing of endogenous FOXA2 in HepG2 cells by siRNAs or by treatment with insulin compromised the induction of the LPL gene by LXR agonists whereas mutations in the FOXA2 site abolished the synergistic transactivation of the LPL promoter by LXRα/RXRα and FOXA2. Physical and functional interactions between LXRα and FOXA2 were established in vitro and ex vivo. In summary, the present study revealed a novel mechanism of human LPL gene induction by oxysterols in the liver with is based on physical and functional interactions between transcription factors LXRα and FOXA2. This mechanism, which may not be restricted to the LPL gene, is critically important for a better understanding of the regulation of cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism in the liver under healthy or pathological states.
Investigating differentially expressed proteins in a milieu rich in cholesterol oxidation products, we found via mass spectrometry-based proteomics that surface levels of heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) were upregulated on monocytic cells in the presence of 27-hydroxycholesterol (27OHChol). The elevated levels of cytoplasmic membrane HSP60 were verified via Western blot analysis and visualized by confocal microscopy. Treatment with 27OHChol also resulted in increased levels of cellular HSP60 without altering its transcription. Cholesterol, however, did not affect cell-surface levels and cellular amount of HSP60. GSK 2033, an LXR antagonist, inhibited expression of live X receptor α, but not of HSP60, induced by 27OHChol. Treatment with 27OHChol also resulted in increased release of HSP60 from monocytic cells, but the release was significantly reduced by inhibitors of endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi protein trafficking, brefeldin A and monensin. Results of the current study indicate that 27OHChol upregulates not only cell-surface and cellular levels of HSP60 but also its release from monocytic cells, thereby contributing to activation of the immune system.
Oxysterols are oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol formed in the human body or ingested in the diet. By modulating the activity of many proteins [e.g., liver X receptors (LXRs), oxysterol-binding proteins (OSBPs), some ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters], oxysterols can affect many cellular functions and influence various physiological processes (e.g., cholesterol metabolism, membrane fluidity regulation, intracellular signaling pathways). Therefore, the role of oxysterols is also important in pathological conditions (e.g., atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus type 2, neurodegenerative disorders). Finally, current evidence suggests that oxysterols play a role in malignancies such as breast, prostate, colon, and bile duct cancer. This review summarizes the physiological importance of oxysterols in the human body with a special emphasis on their roles in various tumors.
Impaired cholesterol/lipoprotein metabolism is linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cerebral cholesterol homeostasis is maintained by the highly efficient blood-brain barrier (BBB) and flux of the oxysterols 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol, potent liver-X-receptor (LXR) activators. HDL and their apolipoproteins are crucial for cerebral lipid transfer, and loss of ATP binding cassette transporters (ABC)G1 and G4 results in toxic accumulation of oxysterols in the brain. The HDL-associated apolipoprotein (apo)M is positively correlated with pre-β HDL formation in plasma; its presence and function in the brain was thus far unknown. Using an in vitro model of the BBB, we examined expression, regulation, and functions of ABCG1, ABCG4, and apoM in primary porcine brain capillary endothelial cells (pBCEC). RT Q-PCR analyses and immunoblotting revealed that in addition to ABCA1 and scavenger receptor, class B, type I (SR-BI), pBCEC express high levels of ABCG1, which was up-regulated by LXR activation. Immunofluorescent staining, site-specific biotinylation and immunoprecipitation revealed that ABCG1 is localized both to early and late endosomes and on apical and basolateral plasma membranes. Using siRNA interference to silence ABCG1 (by 50%) reduced HDL-mediated [3H]-cholesterol efflux (by 50%) but did not reduce [3H]-24(S)-hydroxycholesterol efflux. In addition to apoA-I, pBCEC express and secrete apoM mainly to the basolateral (brain) compartment. HDL enhanced expression and secretion of apoM by pBCEC, apoM-enriched HDL promoted cellular cholesterol efflux more efficiently than apoM-free HDL, while apoM-silencing diminished cellular cholesterol release. We suggest that ABCG1 and apoM are centrally involved in regulation of cholesterol metabolism/turnover at the BBB.
A new methodology to obtain C-25 and C-26 steroidal acids starting from pregnenolone is described. Construction of the side chain was achieved by applying the Mukaiyama aldol reaction with a non-hydrolytic work-up to isolate the trapped silyl enol ether with higher yields. Using this methodology we synthesized three new steroidal acids as potential ligands of DAF-12, Liver X and Glucocorticoid nuclear receptors and studied their activity in reporter gene assays. Our results show that replacement of the 21-CH3 by a 20-keto group in the side chains of the cholestane scaffold of DAF-12 or Liver X receptors ligands causes the loss of the activity.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily that have been shown to regulate various physiological functions such as lipid metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis. Concordant reports have elicited the possibility to target them to cure many human diseases including arteriosclerosis, cancer, arthritis, and diabetes. The high relevance of modulating LXR activities to treat numerous skin diseases, mainly those with exacerbated inflammation processes, contrasts with the lack of approved therapeutic use. This review makes an assessment to sum up the findings regarding the physiological roles of LXRs in skin and help progress towards the therapeutic and safe management of their activities. It focuses on the possible pharmacological targeting of LXRs to cure or prevent selected skin diseases.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one of the most severe motor neuron (MN) disorders in adults. Phenotype of ALS patients is highly variable and may be influenced by modulators of energy metabolism. Recent works have implicated the liver X receptors α and β (LXRs), either in the propagation process of ALS or in the maintenance of MN survival. LXRs are nuclear receptors activated by oxysterols, modulating cholesterol levels, a suspected modulator of ALS severity. In a cohort of 438 ALS patients and 330 healthy controls, the influence of LXR genes on ALS risk and phenotype was studied using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The two LXRα SNPs rs2279238 and rs7120118 were shown to be associated with age at onset in ALS patients. Consistently, homozygotes were twice more correlated than were heterozygotes to delayed onset. The onset was thus delayed by 3.9 years for rs2279238 C/T carriers and 7.8 years for T/T carriers. Similar results were obtained for rs7120118 (+2.1 years and +6.7 years for T/C and C/C genotypes, respectively). The LXRβ SNP rs2695121 was also shown to be associated with a 30% increase of ALS duration (p = 0.0055, FDR = 0.044). The tested genotypes were not associated with ALS risk. These findings add further evidence to the suspected implication of LXR genes in the disease process of ALS and might open new perspectives in ALS therapeutics.
Bile acids are extensively investigated for their potential in the treatment of human disorders. The liver X receptors (LXRs), activated by oxysterols and by a secondary bile acid named hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA), have been found essential in the regulation of lipid homeostasis in mammals. Unfortunately, LXRα activates lipogenic enzymes causing accumulation of lipid in the liver. In addition to LXRs, HDCA has been also shown to function as ligand for GPBAR1, a G protein coupled receptor for secondary bile acids whose activation represents a promising approach to liver steatosis. In the present study, we report a library of HDCA derivatives endowed with modulatory activity on the two receptors. The lead optimization of HDCA moiety was rationally driven by the structural information on the binding site of the two targets and results from pharmacological characterization allowed the identification of hyodeoxycholane derivatives with selective agonistic activity toward LXRα and GPBAR1 and notably to the identification of the first example of potent dual LXRα/GPBAR1 agonists. The new chemical entities might hold utility in the treatment of dyslipidemic disorders.
Hypercholesterolemia is associated with cognitively deteriorated states. Here, we show that excess 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OH), a cholesterol metabolite passing from the circulation into the brain, reduced in vivo brain glucose uptake, GLUT4 expression, and spatial memory. Furthermore, patients exhibiting higher 27-OH levels had reduced 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake. This interplay between 27-OH and glucose uptake revealed the engagement of the insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP). 27-OH increased the levels and activity of IRAP, countered the IRAP antagonist angiotensin IV (AngIV)-mediated glucose uptake, and enhanced the levels of the AngIV-degrading enzyme aminopeptidase N (AP-N). These effects were mediated by liver X receptors. Our results reveal a molecular link between cholesterol, brain glucose, and the brain renin-angiotensin system, all of which are affected in some neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, reducing 27-OH levels or inhibiting AP-N maybe a useful strategy in the prevention of the altered glucose metabolism and memory decline in these disorders.
25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) is enzymatically produced by cholesterol 25-hydorxylase in various organs and is involved in many processes, including lipid metabolism, inflammation and the immune response. However, the role of 25-HC in the migration and invasion of lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) cells remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that 0.1 μM 25-HC promoted ADC cell migration and invasion without affecting cell proliferation, especially after coculture with THP1-derived macrophages. Further investigation showed that 0.1 μM 25-HC significantly stimulated interleukin-1β (IL-1β) secretion in a coculture system and increased the expression of LXR and Snail. IL-1β also mimicked the effect of 25-HC. LXR knockdown notably blocked the 25-HC-induced Snail expression, migration and invasion in both the monoculture system and the coculture system, but it did not impact the effect of IL-1β, which suggested that IL-1β functioned in an LXR-independent manner. These results suggested that 25-HC promoted ADC cell migration and invasion in an LXR-dependent manner in the monoculture system but that in the coculture system, the 25-HC-induced IL-1β secretion enhanced the effect of 25-HC in an LXR-independent manner.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) have been increasingly recognized as a potential therapeutic target to treat pathological conditions ranging from vascular and metabolic diseases, neurological degeneration, to cancers that are driven by lipid metabolism. Amidst intensifying efforts to discover ligands that act through LXRs to achieve the sought-after pharmacological outcomes, several lead compounds are already being tested in clinical trials for a variety of disease interventions. While more potent and selective LXR ligands continue to emerge from screening of small molecule libraries, rational design, and empirical medicinal chemistry approaches, challenges remain in minimizing undesirable effects of LXR activation on lipid metabolism. This review provides a summary of known endogenous, naturally occurring, and synthetic ligands. The review also offers considerations from a molecular modeling perspective with which to design more specific LXRβ ligands based on the interaction energies of ligands and the important amino acid residues in the LXRβ ligand binding domain.
Nuclear receptors (NRs) regulate numerous aspects of the endocrine system. They mediate endogenous and exogenous cues, ensuring a homeostatic control of development and metabolism. Gene duplication, loss and mutation have shaped the repertoire and function of NRs in metazoans. Here, we examine the evolution of a pivotal orchestrator of cholesterol metabolism in vertebrates, the liver X receptors (LXRs). Previous studies suggested that LXRα and LXRβ genes emerged in the mammalian ancestor. However, we show through genome analysis and functional assay that bona fide LXRα and LXRβ orthologues are present in reptiles, coelacanth and chondrichthyans but not in cyclostomes. These findings show that LXR duplicated before gnathostome radiation, followed by asymmetric paralogue loss in some lineages. We suggest that a tighter control of cholesterol levels in vertebrates was achieved through the exploitation of a wider range of oxysterols, an ability contingent on ligand-binding pocket remodeling.
The endogenous oxysterol 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (22RHC, 1) is an LXR agonist which upregulates genes of critical involvement in human cholesterol- and lipid metabolism. In contrast, its synthetic epimer 22(S)-hydroxycholesterol (22SHC, 8) has shown specific antagonistic effects in recent studies, avoiding unwanted side effects provided by potent LXR agonists. In terms of LXR modulation, the aim of this study was to compare 22SHC (8), 22RHC (1) and synthesized ligands with keto- and amide functionality in the 22nd position of the cholesterol scaffold. 22SHC (8) and 22RHC (1) performed as expected while 22-ketocholesterol (22KC, 10) revealed an attractive in vitro profile for further investigation in terms of anti-atherosclerotic properties as selective upregulation of the ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCA1 was observed. A new synthesized amide derivate, Fernholtz cyclohexylamide (13) was shown to reduce lipogenesis in a dose-responsive manner and abolish the effect of the potent LXR agonist T0901317 when administered simultaneously.
When inhaled, ozone (O3) interacts with cholesterols of airway epithelial cell membranes or the lung-lining fluid, generating chemically reactive oxysterols. The mechanism by which O3-derived oxysterols affect molecular function is unknown. Our data show that in vitro exposure of human bronchial epithelial cells to O3 results in the formation of oxysterols, epoxycholesterol-α and -β and secosterol A and B (Seco A and Seco B), in cell lysates and apical washes. Similarly, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from human volunteers exposed to O3 contained elevated levels of these oxysterol species. As expected, O3-derived oxysterols have a pro-inflammatory effect and increase NF-κB activity. Interestingly, expression of the cholesterol efflux pump ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1), which is regulated by activation of the liver X receptor (LXR), was suppressed in epithelial cells exposed to O3 Additionally, exposure of LXR knock-out mice to O3 enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine production in the lung, suggesting LXR inhibits O3-induced inflammation. Using alkynyl surrogates of O3-derived oxysterols, our data demonstrate adduction of LXR with Seco A. Similarly, supplementation of epithelial cells with alkynyl-tagged cholesterol followed by O3 exposure causes observable lipid-LXR adduct formation. Experiments using Seco A and the LXR agonist T0901317 (T09) showed reduced expression of ABCA1 as compared with stimulation with T0901317 alone, indicating that Seco A-LXR protein adduct formation inhibits LXR activation by traditional agonists. Overall, these data demonstrate that O3-derived oxysterols have pro-inflammatory functions and form lipid-protein adducts with LXR, thus leading to suppressed cholesterol regulatory gene expression and providing a biochemical mechanism mediating O3-derived formation of oxidized lipids in the airways and subsequent adverse health effects.
Small-molecule inhibitors targeting growth factor receptors have failed to show efficacy for brain cancers, potentially due to their inability to achieve sufficient drug levels in the CNS. Targeting non-oncogene tumor co-dependencies provides an alternative approach, particularly if drugs with high brain penetration can be identified. Here we demonstrate that the highly lethal brain cancer glioblastoma (GBM) is remarkably dependent on cholesterol for survival, rendering these tumors sensitive to Liver X receptor (LXR) agonist-dependent cell death. We show that LXR-623, a clinically viable, highly brain-penetrant LXRα-partial/LXRβ-full agonist selectively kills GBM cells in an LXRβ- and cholesterol-dependent fashion, causing tumor regression and prolonged survival in mouse models. Thus, a metabolic co-dependency provides a pharmacological means to kill growth factor-activated cancers in the CNS.
The widespread involvement of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway in human malignancies has driven efforts to develop Hh pathway inhibitors as anti-cancer agents. The majority of these agents antagonize Smoothened (Smo), a plasma membrane-associated signal transducer molecule. However, several such Smo antagonists have failed in clinical trials to benefit patients with cancers that arise from aberrant Hh signaling (which often bypasses Smo). In this study, we report that a naturally occurring oxysterol, 20α, 22(R)-dihydroxycholesterol (Oxy16), a known metabolite in the biosynthesis of steroid hormones, strongly inhibits Hh signaling induced in C3H10T1/2 embryonic fibroblasts and NIH3T3-E1 fibroblasts through a mechanism that is independent of liver X receptor (LXR) activation. We demonstrate that Oxy16 inhibits Hh signaling in Suppressor of Fused (Sufu) null mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells, indicating that its inhibitory effect on Hh signaling is epistatic to Sufu. We further demonstrate that Oxy16 inhibits Gli1 transcriptional activity in NIH3T3-E1 cells overexpressing Gli1 and a Gli-dependent reporter construct. Altogether, data presented here suggest that Oxy16 may be a suitable starting point for the development of new drugs that inhibit Hh signaling downstream of Smo. By targeting aberrant Hh signaling, such novel Hh pathway inhibitors could significantly broaden the range of clinical applications compared to existing Smo antagonists. Furthermore, the present study adds a new facet to the spectrum of Hh pathway modulation that naturally occurring oxysterol derivatives are capable of, ranging from allosteric activation of the pathway via Smo binding to inhibition of the pathway downstream of Smo.

Liver X receptors (LXRs) are nuclear receptors that play central roles in the transcriptional control of lipid metabolism. The ability of LXRs to integrate metabolic and inflammation signalling makes them attractive targets for intervention in human metabolic diseases. Several oxidized metabolites of cholesterol (oxysterols) are endogenous LXR ligands, that modulate their transcriptional responses. While 25R-cholestenoic acid is an agonist of the LXRs, the synthetic analogue 27-norcholestenoic acid that lacks the 25-methyl is an inverse agonist. This change in the activity profile is triggered by a disruption of a key interaction between residues His435 and Trp457 that destabilizes the H11-H12 region of the receptor and favors the binding of corepressors. The introduction of fluorine atoms on the oxysterol side chain can favor both hydrophobic interactions as well as hydrogen bonds with the fluorine atoms and may thus induce changes in the receptor that may lead to changes in the activity profile. To evaluate these effects we have synthesized two fluorinated 27-nor-steroids, analogues of 27-norcholestenoic acid, the 25,25-difluoroacid and the corresponding 26-alcohol. The key step was a Reformatsky reaction on the C-24 cholenaldehyde, with ethyl bromodifluoroacetate under high intensity ultrasound (HIU) irradiation, followed by a Barton-McCombie type deoxygenation. Activity was evaluated in a luciferase reporter assay in the human HEK293T cells co-transfected with full length human LXRβ expression vector. The 25,25-difluoro-27-norcholestenoic acid was an inverse agonist and antagonist similar to its non-fluorinated analogue while its reduced derivative 25,25-difluoro-27-norcholest-5-ene-3β,26-diol was an agonist. Molecular dynamics simulation of the ligand-receptor complexes showed that the difluoroacid disrupted the His435-Trp457 interaction although the resulting conformational changes were different from those induced by the non-fluorinated analogue. In the case of the difluoroalcohol, the fluorine atoms actively participated in the interaction with several residues in the ligand binding pocket leading to a stabilization of the active receptor conformation.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a life-threatening pathogen in humans. Bacterial infection of macrophages usually triggers strong innate immune mechanisms, including IL-1 cytokine secretion. The newer member of the IL-1 family, IL-36, was recently shown to be involved in cellular defense against Mtb. To unveil the underlying mechanism of IL-36 induced antibacterial activity, we analyzed its role in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism, together with the involvement of Liver X Receptor (LXR) in this process. We report that, in Mtb-infected macrophages, IL-36 signaling modulates cholesterol biosynthesis and efflux via LXR. Moreover, IL-36 induces the expression of cholesterol-converting enzymes and the accumulation of LXR ligands, such as oxysterols. Ultimately, both IL-36 and LXR signaling play a role in the regulation of antimicrobial peptides expression and in Mtb growth restriction. These data provide novel evidence for the importance of IL-36 and cholesterol metabolism mediated by LXR in cellular host defense against Mtb.
Oxysterols are oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol formed in the human body or ingested in the diet. By modulating the activity of many proteins (for instance, liver X receptors, oxysterol-binding proteins, some ATP-binding cassette transporters), oxysterols can affect many cellular functions and influence various physiological processes (e.g., cholesterol metabolism, membrane fluidity regulation, intracellular signaling pathways). Due to their crucial role, it is important to be able to quantify them in pathological conditions. The method described here permits to measure the content of oxysterol in plasma, cell, or media using GC-MS.
Phytosterols are stucturally correlated to the endogenous ligands of Liver X Receptor (LXR), a ligand-activated nuclear receptor that has emerged as an attractive drug target due to its ability to integrate metabolic and inflammatory signaling. Natural and semi-synthetic phytosterol derivatives characterized by the presence of side-chain oxygenated functions have shown to be able to modulate LXR activity. Here, we describe the efficient synthesis of four stigmastane derivatives, endowed with a hydroxyl group at C24 position, namely (24R)- and (24S)-stigmasta-5,28-diene-3β,24-ols (also referred to as saringosterols, 10a and 10b) and (24R)- and (24S)-stigmasta-5-ene-3β,24-ols (11a and 11b), starting from the readily available stigmasterol. Thanks to X-ray crystallography the absolute configuration of the newly created chiral centers was definitively assigned for all the four compounds. The subsequent luciferase assays with GAL-4 chimeric receptors evidenced the ability of the two 24(S)-epimers, 10b and 11b, to interact with LXRs, showing the same degree of affinity as (22R)-hydroxycholesterol (1). With regard to the isoform selectivity both the derivatives 10b and 11b showed a preference for LXRβ, up to 4-fold in terms of efficacy for 11b. The gene expression profiling of (24S)-stigmasta-5,28-diene-3β,24-ol (10a) and (24S)-stigmasta-5-ene-3β,24-ol (11a) demonstrated the capability of both the compounds to induce the expression of four well-known LXR target genes, such as ABCA1, SREBP1c, FASN, and SCD1 in U937 monocytic cell line, thus supporting the hypothesis they were LXR positive modulators.
The lung has a unique relationship to cholesterol that is shaped by its singular physiology. On the one hand, the lungs receive the full cardiac output and have a predominant dependence on plasma lipoprotein uptake for their cholesterol supply. On the other hand, surfactant lipids, including cholesterol, are continually susceptible to oxidation owing to direct environmental exposure and must be cleared or recycled because of the very narrow biophysical mandates placed upon surfactant lipid composition. Interestingly, increased lipid-laden macrophage "foam cells" have been noted in a wide range of human lung pathologies. This suggests that lipid dysregulation may be a unifying and perhaps contributory event in chronic lung disease pathogenesis. Recent studies have shown that perturbations in intracellular cholesterol trafficking critically modify the immune response of macrophages and other cells. This minireview discusses literature that has begun to demonstrate the importance of regulated cholesterol traffic through the lung to pulmonary immunity, inflammation, and fibrosis. This emerging recognition of coupling between immunity and lipid homeostasis in the lung presents potentially transformative concepts for understanding lung disease and may also offer novel and exciting avenues for therapeutic development.
The nuclear receptors liver X receptor (LXR) α and LXRβ are involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism, inflammation, immunity, cellular proliferation, and apoptosis. Oxysterols are endogenous LXR ligands, and also interact with other nuclear and membrane receptors. We previously reported that a phytosterol derivative with a 1α-hydroxy group acts as a potent LXR agonist with intestine-selective action and that 25-hydroxy and 26/27-hydroxy metabolites of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) exhibit partial LXR agonism. In this study, we report that 1α-hydroxy derivatives of 7-DHC, 1α-OH-7-DHC and 1,25-(OH)2-7-DHC, act as LXR modulators. Luciferase reporter gene assays showed that 1α-OH-7-DHC activates LXRα and LXRβ and that 1,25-(OH)2-7-DHC activates both LXRs and vitamin D receptor. Examination of cofactor peptide association showed that the 1α-hydroxy derivatives, specifically 1,25-(OH)2-7-DHC, induce association of coactivator/corepressor peptide in a different manner from the agonist T0901317. Docking modeling and alanine mutational analysis of LXRα demonstrated that 1,25-(OH)2-7-DHC interacts with LXRα residues in a manner distinct from potent agonists, such as T0901317 and 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol. 1α-OH-7-DHC and 1,25-(OH)2-7-DHC induced expression of LXR target genes in a cell type- and gene-selective manner. 1,25-(OH)2-7-DHC effectively suppressed lipopolysaccharide-stimulated proinflammatory gene expression in an LXR-dependent manner. Therefore, 1α-hydroxy derivatives, such as 1,25-(OH)2-7-DHC, are unique LXR modulators with selective agonistic activity and potent transrepression function. These oxysterols have potential as LXR-targeted therapeutics for inflammatory disease.
Triclosan is an antibacterial compound commonly used in cosmetics and personal care products for everyday use. As previously shown, triclosan is found in the plasma, urine and milk from large parts of different human populations. Recent studies have revealed that triclosan is able to activate the human pregnane X receptor in vitro and thus possibly affecting metabolism of drugs in humans via the induction of CYP3A4. Besides, triclosan has been shown to affect thyroid hormonal levels in rats in vivo. In the present study, we investigated if an everyday exposure to triclosan via triclosan-containing toothpaste for 14 days in 12 adult humans caused an increase in plasma 4beta-hydroxycholesterol, indicative of CYP3A4 induction, and/or alterations in thyroid hormonal status. The plasma triclosan concentrations increased from 0.009-0.81 ng/g to 26-296 ng/g (ranges) upon exposure. Despite this, there were no significant changes in plasma levels of either plasma 4beta-hydroxycholesterol or thyroid hormones during the exposure. This indicates that the normal use of triclosan-containing toothpaste is not likely to alter metabolism of drugs via CYP3A4 induction or cause adverse events because of thyroid disturbances in humans.
Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder for which biological indicators of disease progression, or disease stage, would be especially important for therapeutic trials. 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24OHC) is a brain-generated cholesterol metabolite which has been associated with neurodegeneration, and alterations of cholesterol metabolism in murine HD models and patients' tissues have been recently identified. On these grounds, and with the aim of identifying putative biomarkers in HD, we studied cholesterol metabolism through the analysis in vivo of plasma 24OHC and cholesterol in two independent cohorts of controls and patients of Italian and British origin. We analysed a total of 62 controls, 96 HD symptomatic patients at different disease stages (stage 1-3), and 33 HD gene-positive pre-manifest subjects [pre-manifest HD (pre-HD)]. Cholesterol and 24OHC plasma levels were comparable in both the British and Italian subjects, and were not influenced by fasting or post-meal status. Cholesterol levels did not show differences between controls, pre-HD subjects and HD patients. In contrast, the plasma levels of 24OHC were significantly higher in controls than in HD patients at all disease stages (P &lt; 0.001). Interestingly, in pre-HD subjects plasma 24OHC concentrations were similar to those of controls, and thus significantly greater than those of HD patients at any disease stage (P &lt; 0.001). As expected, significant differences in caudate volumes between stage 1-2 HD patients and pre-HD subjects, and pre-HD subjects and controls were found. The pre-HD cohort of subjects was heterogeneous as to 24OHC levels, since subjects closer to predicted development of motor signs of disease had lower 24OHC levels than those far from onset. Our data indicate that the brain-generated cholesterol metabolite 24OHC measured in plasma was significantly depleted in HD patients at any disease stage, and it could discriminate pre-manifest subjects from patients with overt motor disease. However, 24OHC levels failed to mark further disease progression in patients with manifest HD. Overall, we demonstrate that 24OHC levels parallel the large decrease in caudate volumes observed in gene-positive subjects from pre-manifest to HD stage 1, thus reflecting a critical phase characterized by neuronal loss. We conclude that that 24OHC levels complement MRI morphometry as a valuable tool to follow neurodegenerative changes in the early stages of Huntington disease.
Oxidative stress induced by various oxidants in a random and destructive manner is considered to play an important role in the pathophysiology of a number of human disorders and diseases. It is important to assess the oxidative injury in vivo accurately and inclusively. We have developed an improved method for the measurement of in vivo lipid peroxidation by using a single plasma or liver sample, where total 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2alpha) (t8-iso-PGF(2alpha)), total hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (tHODEs), total hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (tHETEs), and total 7-hydroxycholesterol (t7-OHCh), as well as their parent molecules linoleic acid (t18:2) and cholesterol (tCh), are determined by LC-MS/MS (for t8-iso-PGF(2alpha), tHODE, and tHETE) and GC-MS (for t7-OHCh, t18:2, and tCh) analyses. The plasma and liver samples from human are reduced with sodium borohydride and saponified by potassium hydroxide after the addition of heavy isotopic standards. After extraction by chloroform/ethyl acetate (CHCl(3)/CH(3)COOC(2)H(5), 4:1), they are analyzed without any further sample processing. We applied this method to hepatitis C virus-infected patients (n=8, plasma and liver), hepatitis B virus-infected patients (n=2, plasma and liver), and controls (virus free, n=8, plasma and liver). It was found that in the plasma of patients and controls, the concentrations of oxidized lipids decreased in the following order: tHODE tHETE t7-OHCh &gt; t8-iso-PGF(2alpha). As expected, the virus clearly increased these concentrations. The ratio of stereoisomers of HODE [(E,E)-HODE/(E,Z)-HODE], which reflects the antioxidant capacity in vivo, can also be determined by this method. A significant decrease in the stereoisomer ratio for the liver of patients was observed, indicating liver dysfunction. t8-iso-PGF(2alpha), tHODE, tHETE, and t7-OHCh are measured satisfactorily and inclusively by the current method from biological fluids and tissues, and they can account for a large portion of oxidized lipids in vivo.
CYP3A4 converts cholesterol into 4beta-hydroxycholesterol. We have suggested that 4beta-hydroxycholesterol could be used as a clinical marker for CYP3A4 activity aiding in dose adjustments. The kinetics of 4beta-hydroxycholesterol formation is not known, however, and must be determined in order to establish under what conditions 4beta-hydroxycholesterol can be used as a CYP3A marker.
The concentration of 4beta-hydroxycholesterol increases very slowly during CYP3A4/5 induction in paediatric patients. Whereas induction of CYP3A4/5 was apparently complete within 1-2 weeks of carbamazepine treatment, plasma 4beta-hydroxycholesterol levels continued to increase until at least 8 weeks of treatment. AIMS To investigate the time course of the increase in 4beta-hydroxycholesterol and carbamazepine plasma concentrations during treatment of paediatric patients with epilepsy.
Eight paediatric patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy were studied. Blood samples were drawn before and after about 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 weeks of carbamazepine treatment. The plasma concentrations of 4beta-hydroxycholesterol were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and carbamazepine and its epoxide metabolite by high-performance liquid chromatography.
The basal plasma concentrations of 4beta-hydroxycholesterol showed a large range of observed values between 18 and 99 ng ml(-1). Carbamazepine treatment increased mean plasma 4beta-hydroxycholesterol significantly already after 1 week of treatment (from 43 to 80 ng ml(-1), P &lt; 0.001). 4beta-Hydroxycholesterol concentrations continued to increase until at least 8 weeks of treatment and the concentrations in the final samples (8-23 weeks of treatment) varied between 122 and 494 ng ml(-1). Plasma concentrations of carbamazepine and its epoxide metabolite reached steady state at 1-2 weeks after last dose change.
Carbamazepine treatment of paediatric patients with epilepsy resulted in an induction of CYP3A4/5 and a concomitant increase in plasma 4beta-hydroxycholesterol. Whereas the induction of CYP3A4/5 was apparently complete after 1-2 weeks, the increase in 4beta-hydroxycholesterol continued for several weeks. Thus CYP3A4 activity is not the only determinant of the circulating level of 4beta-hydroxycholesterol. Additional factors such as transport and storage or presence of another enzyme may thus be of importance.
Our previous study showed an increase in total cholesterol level of the hippocampus after kainate-induced injury, but whether this is further metabolized to neurosteroids is not known. The first step in neurosteroid biosynthesis is the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone by the enzyme cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage (P450scc). This study was carried out to elucidate the expression of this enzyme in the kainate-lesioned rat hippocampus. A net decrease in P450scc protein was detected in hippocampal homogenates by Western blots at 2 weeks post-kainate injection (time of peak cholesterol concentration after kainate injury). Immunohistochemistry showed decreased labeling of the enzyme in neurons, but increased expression in a small number of astrocytes. The level of pregnenolone was also analyzed using a newly developed gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method, optimized for the rat hippocampus. A non-significant tendency to a decrease in pregnenolone level was detected 2 weeks post-lesion. This is in contrast to a large increase in oxysterols in the lesioned hippocampus at this time (He et al. 2006). Together, they indicate that increased cholesterol in the kainate lesioned hippocampus is mostly metabolized to oxysterols, and not neurosteroids.
Defects in Niemann-Pick, Type C-1 protein (NPC1) cause cholesterol, sphingolipids, phospholipids, and glycolipids to accumulate in lysosomes of liver, spleen, and brain. In cultured fibroblasts, NPC1 deficiency causes lysosomal retention of lipoprotein-derived cholesterol after uptake by receptor-mediated endocytosis. NPC1 contains 1278 amino acids that form 13 membrane-spanning helices and three large loops that project into the lumen of lysosomes. We showed earlier that NPC1 binds cholesterol and oxysterols. Here we localize the binding site to luminal loop-1, a 240-amino acid domain with 18 cysteines. When produced in cultured cells, luminal loop-1 was secreted as a soluble dimer. This loop bound [(3)H]cholesterol (K(d), 130 nM) and [(3)H]25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC, K(d), 10 nM) with one sterol binding site per dimer. Binding of both sterols was competed by oxysterols (24-, 25-, and 27-HC). Unlabeled cholesterol competed strongly for binding of [(3)H]cholesterol, but weakly for [(3)H]25-HC binding. Binding of [(3)H]cholesterol but not [(3)H]25-HC was inhibited by detergents. We also studied NPC2, a soluble protein whose deficiency causes a similar disease phenotype. NPC2 bound cholesterol, but not oxysterols. Epicholesterol and cholesteryl sulfate competed for [(3)H]cholesterol binding to NPC2, but not NPC1. Glutamine 79 in luminal loop-1 of NPC-1 is important for sterol binding; a Q79A mutation abolished binding of [(3)H]cholesterol and [(3)H]25-HC to full-length NPC1. Nevertheless, the Q79A mutant restored cholesterol transport to NPC1-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells. Thus, the sterol binding site on luminal loop-1 is not essential for NPC1 function in fibroblasts, but it may function in other cells where NPC1 deficiency produces more complicated lipid abnormalities.
The mechanisms used by alveolar type I pneumocytes for maintenance of the lipid homeostasis necessary to sustain these large squamous cells are unknown. The processes may involve the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), a transport protein shown to be crucial in apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I)-mediated mobilization of cellular cholesterol and phospholipid. Immunohistochemical data demonstrated the presence of ABCA1 in lung type I and type II cells and in cultured pneumocytes. Type II cells isolated from rat lungs and cultured for 5 days in 10% serum trans-differentiated toward cells with a type I-like phenotype which reacted with the type I cell-specific monoclonal antibody VIIIB2. Upon incubation of the type I-like pneumocytes with agents that up-regulate the ABCA1 gene (9-cis-retinoic acid [9cRA] and 22-hydroxycholesterol [22-OH, 9cRA/22-OH]), ABCA1 protein levels were enhanced to maximum levels after 8 to 16 hours and remained elevated for 24 hours. In the presence of apoA-I and 9cRA/22-OH, efflux of radioactive phospholipid and cholesterol from pneumocytes was stimulated 3- to 20-fold, respectively, over controls. Lipid efflux was inhibited by Probucol. Sucrose density gradient analysis of the media from stimulated cells incubated with apoA-I identified heterogeneous lipid particles that isolated at a density between 1.063 and 1.210 g/ml, with low or high apoA-I content. Thus, pneumocytes with markers for the type I phenotype contained functional ABCA1 protein, released lipid to apoA-I protein, and were capable of producing particles resembling nascent high-density lipoprotein, indicating an important role for ABCA1 in the maintenance of lung lipid homeostasis.
We evaluated the effect of agents modifying the membrane dipole potential: phloretin, 6-ketocholestanol and RH 421 on the properties of single channels formed by lipodepsipeptide syringomycin E (SRE) in planar lipid bilayers. SRE forms two conductive states in lipid bilayers: "small" and "large." Large SRE channels are clusters of several small ones, demonstrating synchronous openings and closures. The increase in the membrane dipole potential led to (i) an increase in SRE channel conductance, (ii) an increase in the channel's lifetime, and (iii) a decrease in a number of synchronously operating small channels in the clusters. Overall, the results support the model of the small SRE channel synchronization in the cluster as voltage-dependent orientation of the lipid dipoles associated with the channel pores.
Here we use the excitation generalized polarization (GPex) of 6-lauroyl-2-(dimethylamino)naphthalene (Laurdan) fluorescence in fluid cholesterol/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-l-alpha-phosphatidylcholine large unilamellar vesicles to explore the experimental conditions that would be required in order to detect a biphasic change in membrane properties at specific sterol mole fractions (Cr) (e.g., 20.0, 22.2, 25.0, 33.3, 40.0, and 50.0 mol %) for maximal sterol superlattice formation. Laurdan's GPex changes with sterol content in an alternating manner, showing minima (termed as GPex dips) at approximately Cr. GPex dips are detectable if the vesicles are preincubated for a sufficient time period and protected from sterol oxidation. In most cases, vesicles with a higher lipid concentration take a longer time to show a GPex dip at Cr. The depth of the GPex dip increases with increasing incubation time and eventually reaches a plateau, at which the maximum area covered by superlattices is expected to be achieved. However, if the vesicles are not protected against sterol oxidation, the GPex dips are attenuated or obliterated. These effects can be attributed to the increased inter-bilayer lipid exchange and the increased vesicle-vesicle interactions present at high lipid (vesicle) concentrations as well as the decreased interactions between oxysterols and phospholipids. These possible explanations have been incorporated into a kinetic model that is able to calculate the effects of sterol oxidation and lipid concentration on the depth of the GPex dip. The depth of the GPex dip, the required incubation time for the dip formation, and the lipid concentration dependence of the GPex dip vary with Cr, suggesting different physical properties for different sterol superlattices. To detect a biphasic change in membrane properties at Cr, one should also use small sterol mole fraction increments over a wide range, keep all of the vesicles in the same sample set under the same thermal history, and consider lipid concentration, probe type, and Cr value. These results improve our mechanistic understanding of sterol superlattice formation and explain why some studies, especially those requiring high lipid concentrations, did not detect a biphasic change in membrane properties at Cr.
Cholesterol is a vital component of cellular membranes, and is the substrate for biosynthesis of steroids, oxysterols and bile acids. The mechanisms directing the intracellular trafficking of this nearly insoluble molecule have received increased attention through the discovery of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and similar proteins containing StAR-related lipid transfer (START) domains. StAR can transfer cholesterol between synthetic liposomes in vitro, an activity which appears to correspond to the trans-cytoplasmic transport of cholesterol to mitochondria. However, trans-cytoplasmic cholesterol transport in vivo appears to involve the recently-described protein StarD4, which is expressed in most cells. Steroidogenic cells must also move large amounts of cholesterol from the outer mitochondrial membrane to the first steroidogenic enzyme, which lies on the matrix side of the inner membrane; this action requires StAR. Congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia, a rare and severe disorder of human steroidogenesis, results from mutations in StAR, providing a StAR knockout of nature that has provided key insights into its activity. Cell biology experiments show that StAR moves large amounts of cholesterol from the outer to inner mitochondrial membrane, but acts exclusively on the outer membrane. Biophysical data show that only the carboxyl-terminal alpha-helix of StAR interacts with the outer membrane. Spectroscopic data and molecular dynamics simulations show that StAR's interactions with protonated phospholipid head groups on the outer mitochondrial membrane induce a conformational change (molten globule transition) needed for StAR's activity. StAR appears to act in concert with the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, but the precise itinerary of a cholesterol molecule entering the mitochondrion remains unclear.
To clarify whether lipids deposited in human atheromatous lesions induce apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) and to identify the main component in deposited lipids responsible for inducing apoptosis, we examined the effect of lipids extracted from human atheromatous lesions on apoptosis of cultured SMC and analyzed the content of cholesterol in the lipids. When lipids extracted from atheromatous lesions were added to SMC, agarose electrophoresis of DNA showed a ladder pattern, DNA fragmentation assay detected an increase of fragmented DNA, and flow cytometric analysis demonstrated an increase of apoptotic cells. When the extracted lipids were fractionated by Sep-Pak ODS column, addition of the oxysterol-rich fraction to SMC resulted in a DNA ladder pattern and positive staining of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL). The oxysterol-rich fraction also increased fragmented DNA and apoptotic cells to a greater extent than the other two fractions. HPLC analysis showed that the quantity of 7-ketocholesterol in extracted lipids was large enough to induce SMC apoptosis. These results suggest that lipids deposited in human atheromatous lesions may induce apoptosis of SMC and that oxysterols may be important factor contributing to induce apoptosis among deposited lipids.
Oxysterols form a large family of oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol that are present in circulation, and in human and animal tissues. The discovery of osteoinductive molecules that can induce the lineage-specific differentiation of cells into osteoblastic cells and therefore enhance bone formation is crucial for better management of bone fractures and osteoporosis. We previously reported that specific oxysterols have potent osteoinductive properties and induce the osteoblastic differentiation of pluripotent mesenchymal cells. In the present report we demonstrate that the induction of osteoblastic differentiation by oxysterols is mediated through a protein kinase C (PKC)- and protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent mechanism(s). Furthermore, oxysterol-induced-osteoblastic differentiation is marked by the prolonged DNA-binding activity of Runx2 in M2-10B4 bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) and C3H10T1/2 embryonic fibroblastic cells. This increased activity of Runx2 is almost completely inhibited by PKC inhibitors Bisindolylmaleimide and Rottlerin, and only minimally inhibited by PKA inihibitor H-89. PKC- and PKA-dependent mechanisms appear to also regulate other markers of osteoblastic differentiation including alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and osteocalcin mRNA expression in response to oxysterols. Finally, osteogenic oxysterols induce osteoblastic differentiation with BMP7 and BMP14 in a synergistic manner as demonstrated by the enhanced Runx2 DNA-binding activity, ALP activity, and osteocalcin mRNA expression. Since Runx2 is an indispensable factor that regulates the differentiation of osteoblastic cells and bone formation in vitro and in vivo, its increased activity in oxysterol-treated cells further validates the potential role of oxysterols in lineage-specific differentiation of pluripotent mesenchymal cells and their potential therapeutic use as bone anabolic factors.
Rifampicin (rifampin) is a potent inducer of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. It was recently identified as a substrate of the polymorphic organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) expressed on the sinusoidal membrane of human hepatocytes. The present study aimed to investigate the possible association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the SLCO1B1 gene encoding for OATP1B1 with the inducing effect of rifampicin on hepatic CYP3A4. A total of 38 healthy volunteers who had participated in drug interaction studies with rifampicin were genotyped for the g. - 11187G &gt; A and c.521T &gt; C SNPs in SLCO1B1, c.3435C &gt; T SNP in ABCB1 and g.6986A &gt; G SNP in CYP3A5. The plasma concentration of 4beta-hydroxycholesterol, an endogenous marker of CYP3A4 activity, was measured before and after administration of 600 mg rifampicin once daily for 9-11 days. Treatment with rifampicin significantly increased the mean +/- SD plasma concentration of 4beta-hydroxycholesterol from 55.2 +/- 17.9 ng/ml to 120.9 +/- 32.0 ng/ml (P &lt; 0.001). A large intersubject variability existed in the induction of CYP3A4 by rifampicin, but no associations were observed between the variability in induction and any of the polymorphisms studied. These data suggest that SLCO1B1 polymorphism does not affect the extent of induction of hepatic CYP3A4 by rifampicin, probably because other uptake transporters, such as OATP1B3, can compensate for reduced uptake of rifampicin by OATP1B1. However, the present study had sufficient power to detect only a considerably smaller rifampicin-induced increase in 4beta-hydroxycholesterol in carriers of the SLCO1B1 c.521C allele compared to subjects with the reference genotype.
Oxysterols, oxidation products of cholesterol, mediate numerous and diverse biological processes. The objective of this review is to explain some of the biochemical and cell biological properties of oxysterols based on their membrane biophysical properties and their interaction with integral and peripheral membrane proteins.
According to their biophysical properties, which can be distinct from those of cholesterol, oxysterols can promote or inhibit the formation of membrane microdomains or lipid rafts. Oxysterols that inhibit raft formation are cytotoxic. The stereo-specific binding of cholesterol to sterol-sensing domains in cholesterol homeostatic pathways is not duplicated by oxysterols, and some oxysterols are poor substrates for the pathways that detoxify cells of excess cholesterol. The cytotoxic roles of oxysterols are, at least partly, due to a direct physical effect on membranes involved in cholesterol-induced cell apoptosis and raft mediated cell signaling. Oxysterols regulate cellular functions by binding to oxysterol binding protein and oxysterol binding protein-related proteins. Oxysterol binding protein is a sterol-dependent scaffolding protein that regulates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway. According to a recently solved structure for a yeast oxysterol binding protein-related protein, Osh4, some members of this large family of proteins are likely sterol transporters.
Given the association of some oxysterols with atherosclerosis, it is important to identify the mechanisms by which their association with cell membranes and intracellular proteins controls membrane structure and properties and intracellular signaling and metabolism. Studies on oxysterol binding protein and oxysterol binding protein-related proteins should lead to new understandings about sterol-regulated signal transduction and membrane trafficking pathways in cells.
Human atherosclerotic lesions typically contain large amounts of ferritin associated with apoptotic macrophages and foam cells, although the reasons are unknown. In the present investigation, we studied the relationship between ferritin induction and occurrence of apoptosis in 7beta-hydroxycholesterol (7beta-OH)-treated monocytic cells and macrophages. We found that 7beta-OH enlarges the intracellular labile iron pool, increases formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and induces ferritin and cytosolic accumulation of lipid droplets, lysosomal destabilization, and apoptototic macrophage death. Since ferritin is a phase II-type protective protein, our findings suggest that ferritin upregulation here worked as an inefficient defense mechanism. Addition to the culture medium of both a membrane-permeable iron chelator 10-phenanthroline and the non-membrane-permeable iron chelators apoferritin and desferrioxamine afforded significant protection against the 7beta-OH-induced effects. Consequently, endocytosed iron compounds dramatically augmented 7beta-OH-induced cytotoxicity. We conclude that oxidized lipid 7beta-OH causes not only foam cell formation but also oxidative damage with abnormal metabolism of cellular iron. The findings suggest that modulation of iron metabolism in human atheroma may be a potential therapeutic strategy against atherosclerosis.
The dipole potential (Psi(d)) constitutes a large and functionally important part of the electrostatic potential of cell plasma membranes. However, its direct measurement is not possible. Herein, new 3-hydroxyflavone fluorescent probes were developed that respond strongly to Psi(d) changes by a variation of the intensity ratio of their two well-separated fluorescence bands. Using fluorescence spectroscopy with cell suspensions and confocal microscopy with adherent cells, we showed, for the first time, two-color fluorescence ratiometric measurement and visualization of Psi(d) in cell plasma membranes. Using this new tool, a heterogeneous distribution of this potential within the membrane was evidenced.
The aim of this study was to find out whether concentrations of oxysterols in pig meat are affected by dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids and vitamin E. 48 growth-finishing pigs were fed diets with either palm oil or soybean oil and vitamin E concentrations of 15, 40 or 200 mg/kg. Concentrations of oxysterols were analyzed in fresh and heat-processed (180 °C, 20 min) meat (M. longissimus dorsi) and in boiled sausage prepared from meat and back fat of the animals. Concentrations of oxysterols in fresh muscle were below 5 nmol/g dry matter; they were independent of the dietary fat type and vitamin E concentration. Heating caused a large increase of oxysterol concentration (up to 55 nmol/g dry matter). This effect was reduced by increasing dietary vitamin E concentration but was independent of the dietary fat. Sausage from pigs fed soybean oil had higher concentrations of oxysterols than sausage from pigs fed palm oil; vitamin E reduced concentrations of oxysterols in sausage from pigs fed soybean oil, but not in sausage from pigs fed palm oil.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by accumulation of the neurotoxic peptide beta-amyloid, which is produced by proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is a large membrane-bound copper-binding protein that is essential in maintaining synaptic function and may play a role in synaptogenesis. beta-Amyloid has been shown to contribute to the oxidative stress that accompanies AD. Later stages of AD are characterized by neuronal apoptosis. However, the biochemical function of APP and the mechanism of the toxicity of beta-amyloid are still unclear. In this study, we show that both beta-amyloid and APP can oxidize cholesterol to form 7beta-hydroxycholesterol, a proapoptotic oxysterol that was neurotoxic at nanomolar concentrations. 7beta-Hydroxycholesterol inhibited secretion of soluble APP from cultured rat hippocampal H19-7/IGF-IR neuronal cells and inhibited tumor necrosis factor-alpha-converting enzyme alpha-secretase activity but had no effect on beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 activity. 7beta-Hydroxycholesterol was also a potent inhibitor of alpha-protein kinase C, with a K(i) of approximately 0.2 nm. The rate of reaction between cholesterol and beta-amyloid was comparable to the rates of cholesterol-metabolizing enzymes (k(cat) = 0.211 min(-)1). The rate of production of 7beta-hydroxycholesterol by APP was approximately 200 times lower than by beta-amyloid. Oxidation of cholesterol was accompanied by stoichiometric production of hydrogen peroxide and required divalent copper. The results suggest that a function of APP may be to produce low levels of 7-hydroxycholesterol. Higher levels produced by beta-amyloid could contribute to the oxidative stress and cell loss observed in Alzheimer's disease.
A diverse range of lipid oxidation products detected in oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and atherosclerotic lesions are capable of eliciting biological responses in vascular cells. We performed DNA microarray experiments to explore novel responses of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to oxLDL and its components.
cDNA microarray analysis showed that oxLDL, lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC), 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, and oxysterols altered gene expression specifically, but some genes were commonly induced in HUVECs. Solute carrier family 3 member 2 and family 7 member 5, encoding the heavy chain of the cell surface antigen 4F2 (4F2hc) and the L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1), respectively, were induced by oxLDL and many oxidation products. LAT1 requires 4F2hc to form a heterodimeric functional complex to transport neutral amino acids into the cell. LysoPC increased membrane protein levels of LAT1 confirmed by Western blot analysis and also uptake of L-[(14)C]leucine, which was inhibited by a competitive inhibitor for LAT1. The release of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-8 was increased in LysoPC-treated cells and was attenuated by the LAT1 inhibitor.
These findings suggest that an increase in uptake of neutral amino acids induced by LysoPC results in enhancement of inflammatory responses of endothelial cells.
Much experimental evidence suggests that lipid oxidation is important in atherogenesis and in epidemiological studies dietary antioxidants appear protective against cardiovascular events. However, most large clinical trials failed to demonstrate benefit of oral antioxidant vitamin supplementation in high-risk subjects. This paradox questions whether ingestion of antioxidant vitamins significantly affects lipid oxidation within established atherosclerotic lesions.
This placebo-controlled, double blind study of 104 carotid endarterectomy patients determined the effects of short-term alpha-tocopherol supplementation (500 IU/day) on lipid oxidation in plasma and advanced atherosclerotic lesions. In the 53 patients who received alpha-tocopherol there was a significant increase in plasma alpha-tocopherol concentrations (from 32.66 +/- 13.11 at baseline to 38.31 +/- 13.87 (mean +/- SD) micromol/l, p &lt; 0.01), a 40% increase (compared with placebo patients) in circulating LDL-associated alpha-tocopherol (p &lt; 0.0001), and their LDL was less susceptible to ex vivo oxidation than that of the placebo group (lag phase 115.3 +/- 28.2 and 104.4 +/- 15.7 min respectively, p &lt; 0.02). Although the mean cholesterol-standardised alpha-tocopherol concentration within lesions did not increase, alpha-tocopherol concentrations in lesions correlated significantly with those in plasma, suggesting that plasma alpha-tocopherol levels can influence lesion levels. There was a significant inverse correlation in lesions between cholesterol-standardised levels of alpha-tocopherol and 7beta-hydroxycholesterol, a free radical oxidation product of cholesterol.
These results suggest that within plasma and lesions alpha-tocopherol can act as an antioxidant. They may also explain why studies using &lt; 500 IU alpha-tocopherol/day failed to demonstrate benefit of antioxidant therapy. Better understanding of the pharmacodynamics of oral antioxidants is required to guide future clinical trials.
Oxysterols are oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol that have been shown to influence a wide variety of cellular processes including sterol metabolism, lipid trafficking, apoptosis and more recently, cell differentiation. The oxysterol binding proteins (OSBPs) comprise a large conserved family of proteins in eukaryotes with high affinity for oxysterols, but their precise function has not been defined yet. One member of this family in humans, HLM/OSBP2 protein, has recently been reported as a potential marker for solid tumor dissemination and worse prognosis in these cases. In this study we focused on the evaluation of HLM/OSBP2 expression in malignant cell lines from different origins (blood and solid tumors) and we also evaluated its expression in chronic myeloid leukemia patients, correlating the molecular findings with clinical outcome. Our results showed that HLM/OSBP2 was expressed in 80% of the analysed CML patients, suggesting that this protein could constitute a helpful tool for disease monitoring and reinforces recent findings that HLM/OSBP2 protein could be involved in the maintenance of the undifferentiated state necessary for leukemogenesis.
This randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial investigated the effect of 3 months of treatment with calcium dobesilate on endothelium-dependent vasodilation, markers of endothelial function, blood pressure, and markers of oxidation in obese, male smokers. Vascular effects may depend on the type of vessel and we, therefore, investigated both smaller arteries, i.e. resistance arteries and small arterioles, and large conduit arteries. Vascular function was measured by acetylcholine- and sodium-nitroprusside-mediated vasodilation, and capillary recruitment, in the skin microcirculation; by forearm blood flow (FBF) responses to several agonists and to N-G-monomethyl L-arginine (L-NMMA) in the forearm vascular bed; by flow-mediated vasodilation in the brachial artery; and by determination of soluble levels of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and E-selectin. Twenty-eight individuals received dobesilate and 24 placebo. No effect of calcium dobesilate on endothelial function, blood pressure or markers of oxidation was observed compared with placebo. The difference in acetylcholine-mediated vasodilation in the microcirculation was -52.1%-point (95% confidence interval -132.8 to 28.1); in sodium-nitroprusside-mediated vasodilation in the microcirculation, 2.6%-point (-95.1 to 100.2); in capillary recruitment, 2.5%-point (-6.8 to 11.7); in acetylcholine-induced increases in FBF (n=28), 23%-point (-173 to 126); in L-NMMA-induced reduction of basal FBF, -2.8%-point (-29.3 to 23.8); in flow-mediated vasodilation of the brachial artery, 0.3%-points (-2.7 to 3.3); in 24-h systolic blood pressure, 2.1 mmHg (-1.3 to 5.5); in soluble VCAM-1, 54 ng/ml (-8 to 115); in soluble ICAM-1, 9 ng/ml (-49 to 67); in sE-selectin, -17 ng/ml (-44 to 11); in ketocholesterol 5 nM (-17 to 26); and in oxidised LDL -1.6 U/l (-6.7 to 3.5). We have shown that endothelial function, blood pressure, and markers of oxidation were not affected by 3 months of treatment with calcium dobesilate in mildly obese, smoking men. Thus, our data provide no evidence of an effect on vascular function of calcium dobesilate in humans.
In the present work, we report the possibility of modifying the electrostatic properties of the skin by treating human epidermis with compounds whose structures possess a large molecular dipole moment. Data are presented showing that such a modification can be used to enhance dermal drug delivery. Inclusion of such compounds in biological membranes affects the so-called membrane dipole potential, an electrical potential originating from molecular dipoles present on the lipid molecules. Modifications in the magnitude of this potential are known to affect the interaction of hydrophobic ions and peptides with model membranes. Using fluorescein-labeled bacitracin and confocal microscopy, we show that the penetration of the antibiotic peptide bacitracin into the epidermis is enhanced when the skin has been pretreated with liposomes loaded with 30 mol % 6-ketocholestanol, a compound known to increase the magnitude of the membrane dipole potential. Studies using the fluorescent indicators fluoresceinphosphatidylethanolamine and 1-(3-sulfonatopropyl)-4-[beta [2-(di-n-octylamino)-6-naphthyl] vinyl] pyridinium betaine show that the interaction of bacitracin with model membranes is also enhanced by the presence of 6-ketocholestanol in the bilayer and offers some indication to the mechanism of penetration enhancement.
Oxysterols compose a large class of natural substances endowed in a number of cases with marked antiproliferative and cytotoxic activities. The consequences of treatments combining 7beta-hydroxycholesterol (7beta-OHC) or XG-142 (a galactose-linked hydrosoluble derivative of 7beta-OHC) with drugs used in cancer chemotherapy or gamma radiation has been evaluated upon a variety of tumor cell lines: Hep-G2, U937, K562 cells, its adriamycin-resistant variant K562 Adr+ and RDM4. Proliferation was assessed by the Uptiblue assay and the [3H]Thymidine incorporation test. Results indicated that 7beta-OHC increased the sensitivity of tumor cells to adriamycin, VP-16, 5-FU and bleomycin to various degrees. 7beta-OHC was found to reinforce the susceptibility of K562 adriamycin-resistant cells to this drug. In RDM4 cells, an enhanced radiosensitivity by 7beta-OHC was also obtained, whereas XG-142 was less efficient in provoking such an effect.
Oxidized LDL (OxLDL) is composed of many potentially proatherogenic molecules, including oxysterols. Of the oxysterols, 7-ketocholesterol (7-KC) is found in relatively large abundance in OxLDL, as well as in atherosclerotic plaque and foam cells in vivo. Although there is evidence that 7-KC activates endothelial cells, its effect on monocytes is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that 7-KC may induce monocyte differentiation and promote foam cell formation. THP-1 cells were used as a monocyte model system and were treated with 7-KC over a range of concentrations from 0.5 to 10 microg/ml. Changes in cell adhesion properties, cell morphology, and expression of antigens characteristic of differentiated macrophages were monitored over a 7-day period. 7-KC promoted cells to firmly adhere and display morphologic features of differentiated macrophages; this effect was time and dose dependent and was markedly more potent than cholesterol treatment (45% of cells became adherent after 7 days of treatment with 7-KC at 10 microg/ml vs. less then 5% for control cells, P &lt; 0.01). Similar effects were obtained when LDL enriched with 7-KC or OxLDL were added to THP-1 cells. 7-KC-differentiated cells expressed CD11b, CD36, and CD68, phagocytized latex beads, and formed lipid-laden foam cells after exposure to acetylated LDL or OxLDL. In contrast to 7-KC, oxysterols with known cell regulatory effects such as 25-hydroxycholesterol, 7beta-hydroxycholesterol, and (22R)-hydroxycholesterol did not effectively promote THP-1 differentiation. In conclusion, these results demonstrate for the first time that 7-KC, a prominent oxysterol formed in OxLDL by peroxidation of cholesterol, may play an important role in promoting monocyte differentiation and foam cell formation. These studies also suggest that 7-KC induces monocyte differentiation through a sterol-mediated regulatory pathway that remains to be characterized.
Oxidized low-density lipoproteins (LDL) are implicated in atherosclerosis. However, large-scale intervention studies designed to test whether antioxidants, such as vitamin E, can ameliorate cardiovascular disease have generated ambivalent results. This may relate to the fact that the mechanism whereby lipid oxidation is initiated in vivo is unknown and the lack of direct evidence for a deficiency of antioxidants in atherosclerotic lesions. Further, there is little evidence to suggest that vitamin E acts as an antioxidant for lipid peroxidation in vivo. Here we tested the antioxidant effect of dietary vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) supplementation on intimal proliferation and lipid oxidation in balloon-injured, hypercholesterolemic rabbits. alpha-Tocopherol supplementation increased vascular content of alpha-tocopherol over 30-fold compared to nonsupplemented and alpha-tocopherol-deficient chows. Balloon injury resulted in oxidized lipid deposition in the aorta. Maximum levels of primary lipid oxidation products, measured as hydroperoxides of esterified lipid (LOOH) and oxidized linoleate (HODE), were 0.22 and 1.10 nmol/mg, representing 0.21 and 0.39% of the precursor molecule, respectively. Secondary lipid oxidation products, measured as oxysterols, were maximal at 5.60 nmol/mg or 1.48% of the precursor compound. Vascular HODE and oxysterols were significantly reduced by vitamin E supplementation. However, the intima/media ratio of aortic vessels increased with vitamin E supplementation, suggesting that the antioxidant promoted intimal proliferation. Thus, the study demonstrates a dissociation of aortic lipid oxidation and lesion development, and suggests that vitamin E does not prevent lesion development in this animal model.
Several studies have revealed that high-density lipoprotein (HDL) is the most reliable predictor for susceptibility to cardiovascular disease. Since apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) is the major protein of HDL, it is worthwhile evaluating the potential of this protein to reduce the lipid burden of lesions observed in the clinic. Indeed, apoA-I is used extensively in cell culture to induce cholesterol efflux. However, while there is a large body of data emanating from in-vitro and cell-culture studies with apoA-I, little animal data and scant clinical trials examining the potential of this apolipoprotein to induce cholesterol (and other lipid) efflux exists. Importantly, the effects of oxysterols, such as 7-ketocholesterol (7KC), on cholesterol and other lipid efflux by apoA-I needs to be investigated in any attempt to utilise apoA-I as an agent to stimulate efflux of lipids. Lessons may be learnt from studies with other lipid acceptors such as cyclodextrins and phospholipid vesicles (PLVs, liposomes), by combination with other effluxing agents, by remodelling the protein structure of the apolipoprotein, or by altering the composition of the lipoprotein intended for administration in-vivo. Akin to any other drug, the usage of this apolipoprotein in a therapeutic context has to follow the traditional sequence of events, namely an evaluation of the biodistribution, safety and dose-response of the protein in animal trials in advance of clinical trials. Mass production of the apolipoprotein is now a simple process due to the advent of recombinant DNA technology. This review also considers the potential of cyclodextrins and PLVs for use in inducing reverse cholesterol transport in-vivo. Finally, the potential of cyclodextrins as delivery agents for nucleic acid-based constructs such as oligonucleotides and plasmids is discussed.
We used an automated Langmuir-Pockels surface balance to characterize the air-water interfacial properties of cholesterol (CH) and its derivatives with hydrophilic OH and F substitutions at isologous sites on the sterol body or side chain. We studied 6-fluorocholesterol, 25-fluorocholesterol, 25,26,26,26,27,27,27-heptafluorocholesterol, 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol, 7beta-hydroxycholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol, alone and in mixtures with 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-3-glycero-phosphocholine (POPC). Pressure;-area isotherms of the fluorocholesterols were essentially indistinguishable from CH and all condensed POPC monomolecular layers (monolayers) to variable degrees. Both nucleus-substituted hydroxycholesterols formed expanded monolayers, with lift-offs from baseline 22-26 A(2)/molecule larger than CH, suggesting interfacial tilting; furthermore, in binary mixtures, they condensed POPC monolayers less than CH. In contrast, the side chain hydroxylated CHs were oriented horizontally in the interface at large molecular areas, and became vertical below 140 A(2)/molecule with the side chain-OH rather than 3-OH group anchored in the subphase, as evidenced by low collapse pressures and smaller molecular areas than CH. Both side chain hydroxycholesterols expanded POPC monolayers at molar ratios &lt;30%, but induced condensation with higher ratios, suggesting that OH-acyl chain (POPC) repulsion is superceded at higher mole fractions by lateral phase separation and intersteroidal H-bonding. These studies predict that fluorocholesterols should exhibit intramembrane spatial occupancy nearly identical to CH, whereas nucleus and especially side chain hydroxycholesterols will perturb membrane lipid packing notably.
Little attention has been given to the consequences of the in vivo calcium status on intracellular calcium homeostasis despite several pathological states induced by perturbations of the in vivo calcium balance. The aim of these studies was to probe the influence of an in vivo calcium deficiency on the resting cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration and the inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ pools. Studies were conducted in hepatocytes (a cell type well characterized for its cellular Ca2+ response) isolated from normal and calcium-deficient rats secondary to vitamin D depletion. Both resting cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration and Ca2+ mobilization from inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive cellular pools were significantly lowered by calcium depletion. In addition, Ca deficiency was shown to significantly reduce calreticulin messenger RNA and protein levels but calcium entry through store-operated calcium channels remained unaffected, indicating that the Ca2+ entry mechanisms are still fully operational in calcium deficiency. The effects of calcium deficiency on cellular calcium homeostasis were reversible by repletion with oral calcium feeding alone or by the administration of the calcium-regulating hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, further strengthening the tight link between extra- and intracellular calcium. These data, therefore, challenge the currently prevailing hypothesis that extracellular Ca2+ has no significant impact on cellular Ca2+ by demonstrating that despite the large Ca2+ gradient between extra- and intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, calcium deficiency in vivo significantly alters the hormone-sensitive cellular calcium homeostasis.
Cholesterol- and cholesteryl ester-rich macrophage foam cells, characteristic of atherosclerotic lesions, are often generated in vitro using oxidized low density lipoprotein (OxLDL). However, relatively little is known of the nature and extent of sterol deposition in these cells or of its relationship to the foam cells formed in atherosclerotic lesions. The purpose of this study was to examine the content and cellular processing of sterols in OxLDL-loaded macrophages, and to compare this with macrophages loaded with acetylated LDL (AcLDL; cholesteryl ester-loaded cells containing no oxidized lipids) or 7-ketocholesterol-enriched acetylated LDL (7KCAcLDL; cholesteryl ester-loaded cells selectively supplemented with 7-ketocholesterol (7KC), the major oxysterol present in OxLDL). Both cholesterol and 7KC and their esters were measured in macrophages after uptake of these modified lipoproteins. Oxysterols comprised up to 50% of total sterol content of OxLDL-loaded cells. Unesterified 7KC and cholesterol partitioned into cell membranes, with no evidence of retention of either free sterol within lysosomes. The cells also contained cytosolic, ACAT-derived, cholesteryl and 7-ketocholesteryl esters. The proportion of free cholesterol and 7KC esterified by ACAT was 10-fold less in OxLDL-loaded cells than in AcLDL or 7KCAcLDL-loaded cells. This poor esterification rate in OxLDL-loaded cells was partly caused by fatty acid limitation. OxLDL-loaded macrophages also contained large (approximately 40-50% total cell sterol content) pools of oxidized esters, containing cholesterol or 7KC esterified to oxidized fatty acids. These were insensitive to ACAT inhibition, very stable and located in lysosomes, indicating resistance to lysosomal esterases. Macrophages loaded with OxLDL do not accumulate free sterols in their lysosomal compartment, but do accumulate lysosomal deposits of OxLDL-derived cholesterol and 7-ketocholesterol esterified to oxidized fatty acids. The presence of similar deposits in lesion foam cells would represent a pool of sterols that is particularly resistant to removal.
Extraction of ECV304 endothelial cells in 1% Triton X-100 at 4 degrees C resulted in a detergent-insoluble pellet that contained 90% of the caveolin, 78% of the src family kinases and 99% of the annexin II. When detergent-treated cells were loaded beneath a 10-30% sucrose gradient the caveolin and a large proportion of the cellular cholesterol floated at a density of 1.09 g/cm3, characteristic of caveolae and glycosphingolipid-rich membranes. With extended centrifugation the src family kinases, which were initially associated with this floating material, sedimented to the bottom of the gradient. Annexin II remained on the bottom of the gradient under both centrifugation conditions. After 24-h incubation with oxidised low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) about 7.5% of the total sterol in the cells was replaced by 7-ketocholesterol, the major oxysterol found in oxLDL. The majority of this 7-ketocholesterol was found in the light membrane fraction on sucrose gradients. Under these conditions src kinase activity more than doubled in the Triton-resistant fraction, without changes in the concentration of src kinase protein. Introducing oxysterols directly into the medium bathing ECV304 cells for 1 h also modulated the activity of src family kinases in the detergent-resistant membranes. An elevation in activity was observed for 7-ketocholesterol while 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol, 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol and cholesterol epoxide all produced decreases in the background level of src kinase activity. We conclude that 7-ketocholesterol and possibly other components of oxLDL can equilibrate into glycosphingolipid-rich membranes and increase the activity of src kinases, possibly by interaction with caveolin.
Oxysterols are present in human atherosclerotic plaque and are suggested to play an active role in plaque development. Moreover, the oxysterol:cholesterol ratio in plaque is much higher than in normal tissues or plasma. Oxysterols in plaque are derived both non-enzymically, either from the diet and/or from in vivo oxidation, or (e.g. 27-hydroxycholesterol) are formed enzymically during cholesterol catabolism. While undergoing many of the same reactions as cholesterol, such as being esterified by cells and in plasma, certain oxysterols in some animal and in vitro models exhibit far more potent effects than cholesterol per se. In vitro, oxysterols perturb several aspects of cellular cholesterol homeostasis (including cholesterol biosynthesis, esterification, and efflux), impair vascular reactivity and are cytotoxic and/or induce apoptosis. Injection of relatively large doses of oxysterols into animals causes acute angiotoxicity whereas oxysterol-feeding experiments have yielded contrary results as far as their atherogenicity is concerned. There is no direct evidence yet in humans that oxysterols contribute to atherogenesis. However, oxysterol levels are elevated in human low-density lipoprotein (LDL) subfractions that are considered potentially atherogenic and two recent studies have indicated that raised plasma levels of a specific oxysterol (7beta-hydroxycholesterol) may be associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis. At the present time there are a number of significant and quite widespread problems with current literature which preclude more than a tentative suggestion that oxysterols have a causal role in atherogenesis. Further studies are necessary to definitively determine the role of oxysterols in atherosclerosis, and considering the wide-ranging tissue levels reported in the literature, special emphasis is needed on their accurate analysis, especially in view of the susceptibility of the parent cholesterol to artifactual oxidation.
Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, frequent developmental delay and early death. Tissues of affected individuals accumulate large quantities of free cholesterol in lysosomes. Because cytotoxic oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol are known to form readily when cholesterol concentrations are elevated, we searched for these compounds in liver, kidney, spleen and brain from mice with the NP-C phenotype. In order of abundance, we identified 7 alpha- and 7 beta-hydroxycholesterol, 5 alpha, 6 alpha-epoxycholestan-3 beta-ol, 4 beta-hydroxycholesterol, cholest-4-en-3 beta, 7 alpha-diol and cholest-4-en-3 beta, 6 beta-diol in most tissue samples. Cholesterol concentrations in affected mice were increased 3-fold in kidney and 7- to 8-fold in spleen and liver compared to controls (all p &lt; 0.001) but were unchanged in brain. Although oxysterol levels were markedly elevated in nonbrain tissue, the oxysterol and cholesterol concentrations increased proportionally so that oxysterols expressed as percentage of total sterols were the same for all animals (0.34 +/- 0.19% averaged over all organs in affected animals vs 0.40 +/- 0.42% in control mice). In contrast to peripheral tissue, we could not detect any increase in either absolute or relative oxysterol levels in the brains of affected and control mice (49 +/- 61 vs 53 +/- 43 micrograms/g wet weight and 0.45 +/- 0.52 vs 0.47 +/- 0.37%, respectively). Thus, brain sterols are normal in NP-C mice and it is unlikely that an accumulation of cytotoxic oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol could account for the progressive neuropathology seen in the disease.
This study reports some of the steroidogenic characteristics of the interna and externa theca cells taken from young and eCG primed calves. These cells were isolated from large healthy follicles. The were separately cultured for 3 days in absence or in presence of steroid substrates. Androstenedione (A4) and progesterone (P4) were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA). In control conditions, A4 levels, higher in interna than in externa cells (P &lt; 0.001), decreased during cultures (P &lt; 0.01). In both cell types, A4 increased in presence of 17 alpha-hydroxypregnenolone (17OHP5), pregnenolone (P5) and 22R-hydroxycholesterol (22R-chol)(*P &lt; 0.05) but not with P4 or 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP4)(P &gt; 0.05). The most efficient substrate was dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) (P &lt; 0.005). In control conditions, P4 levels increased in both cell types. They were higher in externa than in interna cells on day 1, the reverse was observed on day 3. P4 levels increased after addition of 22 R-chol and P5 (P &lt; 0.005) but not with 17OHP5, 17OHP4 and DHEA (P &gt; 0.05) from day 1 in externa cells and only on day 3 in internal cells. P4 levels measured on day 1 were lower than the quantity of P4 added as a substrate. These results, obtained with theca cells from young calf follicles, indicate: 1/A4 is synthesized by the delta5 pathway and 17 alpha-hydroxylase activity decreases in vitro, 2/externa and interna cells differ by the quantities of A4 and P4 produced, 3/both lack precursors to produce A4 and P4 but their 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity subsists, 4/P4 could be metabolized during the first 2 days in both cell cultures.
Macrophage-derived apoE has been shown to play an important role in the susceptibility of the vessel wall to atherosclerosis. Previous studies have shown that macrophage sterol content modulates apoE synthesis and secretion, associated with a large transcriptional response of the apoE gene. The current studies were undertaken to evaluate the existence of additional post-transcriptional regulatory loci for the effect of sterols on apoE synthesis and secretion. Using a macrophage cell line transfected to constitutively express an apoE cDNA to facilitate detection of a post-transcriptional regulatory locus, we demonstrated that preincubations in 25-hydroxycholesterol and cholesterol lead to increased apoE secretion in pulse/chase experiments. Examination of cell lysates in these experiments showed that apoE not secreted by control cells was degraded and not detectable, suggesting that the preincubation in sterols increased secretion by decreasing degradation of newly synthesized apoE. The measurement of total protein and apoE degradation in cell fractions revealed an intermediate density fraction that degraded significant amounts of newly synthesized total protein and newly synthesized apoE. In this fraction, degradation of total protein and apoE was unaffected by chloroquine but was substantially reduced by N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal plus N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-methioninal or by lactacystin, suggesting the involvement of proteasomes. Preincubation in sterol/oxysterol or acetylated low density lipoprotein did not modify total protein degradation by this fraction but inhibited apoE degradation. Similar results were obtained using intermediate density fractions isolated from human monocyte-derived macrophages. The results of our studies indicate that newly synthesized apoE in the macrophage can be degraded in an intermediate density nonlysosomal cellular compartment, which is sensitive to proteasomal inhibitors. Alteration of cellular lipid homeostasis by preincubation in sterol/oxysterol or acetylated low density lipoprotein inhibits apoE, but not total protein, degradation in this fraction. Inhibition of the degradation of apoE in this fraction likely contributes to the increased apoE secretion observed in sterol-enriched cells.
During the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, inflammatory cells such as the monocyte-derived macrophage accumulate in the vessel wall where they release cytokines. Initially, cytokines may assist in CE removal of lipoprotein-derived cholesterol/CE hydrolysis to clear intracellular lipid. When plasma levels of LDL become elevated, the vessel wall becomes lipid-engorged over time because it is unable to traffick the large amounts of endocytosed LDL-CE from the cell. In addition, lipoprotein entrapment by the extracellular matrix can lead to the progressive oxidation of LDL because of the action of lipoxygenases, reactive oxygen species, peroxynitrite, and/or myeloperoxidase. A range of oxidized LDL species is thus generated, ultimately resulting in their delivery to vascular cells through several families of scavenger receptors (Fig 1). These molecular Trojan horses and cellular saboteurs once formed or deposited in the cell can contribute to, and participate in, formation of macrophage- and smooth muscle-derived foam cells. A lipid-enriched fatty streak along the vessel wall can ensue. In addition to foam cell development, products of LDL peroxidation may activate endothelial cells, increase smooth muscle mitogenesis, or induce apoptosis because of the effects of oxysterols and products of lipid peroxidation (Fig 1). Because antioxidant defenses may be limited in the microenvironment of the cell or within LDL, the oxidation process continues to progress. Enzymes associated with HDL such as PAF acetylhydrolase and paraoxonase can participate in the elimination of biologically active lipids, but diminished cellular antioxidant activity coupled with low levels of HDL may allow acceleration of the clinical course of vascular disease. There is still much to be learned about how modified LDL initiate cellular signals that lead to inflammation, mitosis, or cholesterol accumulation. The present challenges include elucidation of the key signaling events that regulate lipoprotein-derived cholesterol trafficking in the vessel wall, which can impact on the pathogenesis of vascular disease.
Both glucocorticoids and oxysterols, steroids with quite different known transduction pathways, cause the death of lymphoid cells. Dual TUNEL/propidium iodide assays on sensitive human leukemic CEM-C7 clones treated with either steroid were clearly positive by 48 h, consistent with apoptosis. Both steroids evoked two distinctive types of DNA lysis: cleavage into large fragments of several different sizes and the classic "ladders", multiples of approximately 200 base pairs. Conventional gel electrophoresis showed that a small proportion of total DNA had undergone laddering 36-48 h after treatment with glucocorticoid or 24 h after oxysterol exposure. On field inversion gel electrophoresis of cellular DNA both steroids caused an increase in an array of large DNA fragments &lt;50 kb in size. A 50 kb fragment appeared 36 h after treatment with either steroid, but only oxysterol treatment caused a significant increase in a 300 kb fragment. Oxysterol treatment did not result in DNA fragmentation in the resistant M10R5 subclone, which retained sensitivity to glucocorticoids. We conclude that glucocorticoids and oxysterols kill these cells with similar, but not identical, patterns of DNA lysis which occur just before or concomitant with the onset of cell death.
A procedure for the determination of eight relevant cholesterol oxides in poultry meat has been developed. The method consists of the enrichment of cholesterol oxides by means of the combined use of solid-phase fractionation and thin-layer chromatography. Florisil and silica columns of 10 g permitted the handling of the total cholesterol oxides content included in the lipid bulk obtained after the Folch's extraction of 20 g of muscle meat. The determination of cholesterol oxides under their trimethylsilyl derivatives was performed by using capillary gas chromatography. The use of a fused-silica open tubular capillary column 30 m x 0.25 mm I.D. coated with 5% phenylmethylsilicone and with a film width of 0.25 micron permitted the separation of all the species. Two modes of injection (on-column and solvent venting) were evaluated and compared for the analysis of cholesterol oxides. On-column capillary gas chromatography (cGC) gave better absolute areas relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) values: 3% to 6% vs. 5% to 7% for solvent venting cGC. Regression analysis for each cholesterol oxide was performed for the two modes of injection. The possibility of large volume injection (10 microliters) by using the solvent venting mode was also evaluated in order to increase the sensitivity of the detection of cholesterol oxides. R.S.D. values for absolute areas ranging from 6% to 14% were obtained. The validation of the method was carried out within the range of 0.1-1 ppm. Absolute and relative recovery values ranging from 80% to 100% were obtained. Statistical analysis revealed that the method was reproducible. cGC-mass spectrometry was also used to confirm the peaks detected by cGC: the total ion chromatogram mode was used for the analysis of samples containing concentrations down to 0.1 ppm of cholesterol oxides. The analysis of fresh and cooked chicken meat revealed the presence of cholesterol oxides proceeding from the autoxidation of the cholesterol B-ring. Finally, saponification was found to be not as accurate as the described procedure for cholesterol oxides analysis.
The effects of 7-ketocholesterol on rat hepatocytes prepared by collagenase perfusion were examined. The viability of cells incubated with 100 microM 7-ketocholesterol was significantly lower than those with cholesterol, although the LDH activity in the cultured medium remained unchanged during the incubation. Hepatocytes treated with 7-ketocholesterol produced large amounts of .NO and O2- in the early stage of incubation. Treatment of the hepatocytes with Carboxy-PTIO, which selectively scavenged .NO, or with L-NMMA, an inhibitor of .NO synthase, increased the cell viability. The addition of 7-ketocholesterol to the culture medium tended to increase the ratio of total sterol to phospholipid of the hepatocytes in a time-dependent manner without changing the content of phospholipid. No lipid peroxidation or oxidation of the cellular SH groups, protein SH and glutathione, was apparent. Vitamin E added 1 h before the addition of 7-ketocholesterol prevented the hepatocytes from cell death by suppressing the incorporation of 7-ketocholesterol into the hepatocytes and by scavenging O2-.
The aim of the present study was to investigate whether impairment of cholesterol efflux previously found from mouse peritoneal macrophages loaded with oxidized low density lipoprotein (OxLDL) could be ascribed to the presence of oxysterols in these cells. 7-Ketocholesterol (7KC), the major oxysterol present in OxLDL-loaded cells, was selectively incorporated into unoxidized LDL, which was subsequently acetylated to produce a high uptake form. Mouse macrophages incubated with 7KC-enriched acetylated LDL (7kAcLDL) did not reveal cytotoxicity judged by cell protein and trypan blue exclusion. A large proportion of cellular 7KC was esterified, indicating that it is a substrate for acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase. Cholesterol efflux from mouse macrophages loaded with 7kAcLDL, using apoA-I as a sterol acceptor, was impaired in cells containing &gt;50 nmol of 7KC/mg of cell protein compared with cells loaded with oxysterol-free acetylated LDL. Thus impairment of cholesterol efflux could be reproduced in cells loaded with 7kAcLDL containing similar proportions of 7KC as OxLDL. 7KC itself was exported very poorly, even when the levels of 7KC in the cells were low. These results suggest that oxysterols present in foam cells in vitro can affect reverse sterol transport and may be potentially important in foam cell formation in vivo.
A large body of evidence suggests that oxidized LDL (oxLDL) has a role in atherogenesis. One effect is the impact on macrophage function. We have studied the effects of oxLDL and oxysterols on the binding of the transcription factors nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB and AP-1 to DNA. These transcription factors are involved in the regulation of several genes and expressed during activation of macrophages, for example by endotoxin (LPS). OxLDL did not induce binding of NF-kappaB. However, the LPS-induced response to NF-kappaB was substantially reduced after preincubation with oxLDL. Medium and highly oxidized LDL also decreased the constitutive DNA-binding of AP-1. Similar effects on AP-1-binding were seen with the oxysterols, 7beta-hydroxycholesterol, 24- hydroxy-, 25-hydroxy-, and 27-hydroxy-cholesterol. Our data therefore suggest an effect of oxLDL on the DNA-binding of AP-1, which might be mediated by the oxysterol content of oxLDL. A decreased LPS-induced TNF-alpha and IL-1beta mRNA and protein expression were found in macrophages incubated with oxLDL before LPS-exposure. These observations suggest that macrophages that internalize extensively oxidized LDL are suppressed in their response to inflammatory stimulation.
The effect of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligands: PK11195 (1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)isoquinoline-3-carboxamid e), Ro 5-4864 (4-chlorodiazepam), hemin, N-methyl protoporphyrin IX and protoporphyrin IX on liver mitochondrial 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol was studied by adding them together with [4-14C]cholesterol. N-Methyl protoporphyrin IX, PK11195 and protoporphyrin IX stimulated mitochondrial 27-hydroxylation of [4-14C] cholesterol in vitro, the first two being the most potent (2-3-fold increase). Ro 5-4864 and hemin were not active. 27-Hydroxylation of [4-14C]cholesterol was reduced to below control levels (respectively 40 and 56% decrease compared to control, P &lt; 0.01) when PK11195, N-methyl protoporphyrin IX or protoporphyrin IX were allowed to equilibrate in vitro with mitochondria for 20 min at 37 degrees C. Hepatic protoporphyria was induced using 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) (100 mg/kg, i.p.) to study the effect of in vivo accumulation of large amounts of dicarboxylic porphyrins, i.e. endogenous peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligands, on cholesterol 27-hydroxylation. DDC treatment caused an increase in total porphyrin content in liver homogenate (10-fold) and mitochondria (2-fold). Mitochondrial 27-hydroxylation of [4-14C]cholesterol was depressed after treatment (60% decrease, P &lt; 0.01). We suggest that peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligands act on liver mitochondrial 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol by a mechanism coupled to these receptors and that the time of exposure of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors to ligands is a major factor. The modulation of 27-hydroxycholesterol production may have a physiological role in liver and possibly in other tissues.
Among the different targets of the cytodamaging effects of cholesterol oxides in endothelial cells, cytoskeleton is one of the most relevant, due to the large variety of biological events controlled by this subcellular structure. The modifications of the intermediate filament network caused by three cholesterol oxides (cholestane-3beta,5alpha,6beta-triol, CH, 7-keto-cholesterol, KC, and 25-OH-cholesterol, COH) was investigated in the endothelial cell line 73/73 using immunofluorescence and laser scanner confocal microscopy. All three cholesterol oxides promoted a redistribution of vimentin filaments that took place well before cell detachment and the occurrence of any detectable sign of cell death. CH-induced alterations were characterized by the polarization of vimentin to the edges of the cell and a concomitant destruction of its interaction with the nucleus. In KC-treated cells, vimentin filaments appeared cross-linked and formed a sort of circular network ring between the nucleus and the cell periphery. COH promoted the aggregation of vimentin filaments in thick and irregular bundles that delimited apparently empty regions. All these changes occurred independently of gross modifications in microtubule organization, which was generally retained except for the appearance of immunoreactive tubulin spots throughout the cytoplasm. These results indicate that the organization of the intermediate-size filament protein vimentin is markedly affected by cholesterol oxides. The different rearrangements caused by CH, KC, and COH may derive from different pathobiochemical processes triggered by these compounds.
Oxysterols constitute a large family of natural compounds, endowed with various biological activities including cholesterol regulation, immunosuppression and antitumoral potency. In the present study, we examine and compare the cytotoxic effects of two representative members of this family: 7 beta-hydroxycholesterol (7 beta-OH) and 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OH), in two human monocytic cell lines, U-937 and HL-60. In both cell lines 7 beta-OH at 30 mu M induces cell death by apoptosis within the first hours of treatment. Under the same conditions and in contrast with results previously obtained with lymphoma cells, 25-OH is cytostatic only. It is interesting to note that the simultaneous treatment of U-937 cells by equimolar concentrations of 7 beta-OH and 25-OH leads to a considerably decreased induction of apoptosis. Such an effect is not observed with HL-60 cells. Taken together, these results indicate for the first time that: 1) oxysterols hydroxylated on the sterol nucleus are also able to induce apoptosis, 2) apoptosis can be induced by these substances in cells belonging to the myeloid lineage and 3) as far as apoptosis is concerned, a combined treatment with 7 beta-OH and 25-OH can lead to opposite effects depending on the cell type.
Obesity and the related entity metabolic syndrome are characterized by altered lipid metabolism and associated with increased morbidity risk for cardiovascular disease and cancer. Oxysterols belong to a large family of cholesterol-derived molecules known to play crucial role in many signaling pathways underlying several diseases. Little is known on the potential effect of obesity and metabolic syndrome on oxysterols in human.
In this work, we questioned whether circulating oxysterols might be significantly altered in obese patients and in patients with metabolic syndrome. We also tested the potential correlation between circulating oxysterols and fatty acids.
60 obese patients and 75 patients with metabolic syndrome were enrolled in the study along with 210 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects, used as control group. Plasma oxysterols were analyzed by isotope dilution GC/MS, and plasma fatty acids profiling was assessed by gas chromatography coupled with flame ionization detection.
We found considerable differences in oxysterols profiling in the two disease groups that were gender-related. Compared to controls, males showed significant differences only in 4α- and 4β-hydroxycholesterol levels in obese and metabolic syndrome patients. In contrast, females showed consistent differences in 7-oxocholesterol, 4α-hydroxycholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol and triol. Concerning fatty acids, we found minor differences in the levels of these variables in males of the three groups. Significant changes were observed in plasma fatty acid profile of female patients with obesity or metabolic syndrome. We found significant correlations between various oxysterols and fatty acids. In particular, 4β-hydroxycholesterol, which is reduced in obesity and metabolic syndrome, correlated with a number of saturated and mono-unsaturated fatty acids that are end-products of de novo lipogenesis.
Our data provide the first evidence that obesity and metabolic syndrome are associated with major, gender-specific, changes in circulating oxysterols and fatty acids. These findings suggest a metabolic link between oxysterols and fatty acids, and that oxysterols may contribute to the epidemic diseases associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome in female.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that has been linked to changes in cholesterol metabolism. Neuronal cholesterol content significantly influences the pro-apoptotic effect of amyloid-β peptide42 (Aβ42), which plays a key role in AD development. We previously reported that aged mice with reduced expression of the lipolysis stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR+/-), demonstrate membrane cholesterol accumulation and decreased intracellular lipid droplets in several brain regions, suggesting a potential role of LSR in brain cholesterol distribution. We questioned if these changes rendered the LSR+/- mouse more susceptible to Aβ42-induced cognitive and biochemical changes. Results revealed that intracerebroventricular injection of oligomeric Aβ42 in male 15-month old LSR+/+ and LSR+/- mice led to impairment in learning and long-term memory and decreased cortical cholesterol content of both groups; these effects were significantly amplified in the Aβ42-injected LSR+/- group. Total latency of the Morris test was significantly and negatively correlated with cortical cholesterol content of the LSR+/- mice, but not of controls. Significantly lower cortical PSD95 and SNAP-25 levels were detected in Aβ42-injected LSR+/- mice as compared to Aβ42-injected LSR+/+ mice. In addition, 24S-hydroxy cholesterol metabolite levels were significantly higher in the cortex of LSR+/- mice. Taken together, these results suggest that changes in cortex cholesterol regulation as a result of the LSR+/- genotype were linked to increased susceptibility to amyloid stress, and we would therefore propose the aged LSR+/- mouse as a new model for understanding the link between modified cholesterol regulation as a risk factor for AD. 
Cholesterol is an essential component for neuronal physiology not only during development stage but also in the adult life. Cholesterol metabolism in brain is independent from that in peripheral tissues due to blood-brain barrier. The content of cholesterol in brain must be accurately maintained in order to keep brain function well. Defects in brain cholesterol metabolism has been shown to be implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and some cognitive deficits typical of the old age. The brain contains large amount of cholesterol, but the cholesterol metabolism and its complex homeostasis regulation are currently poorly understood. This review will seek to integrate current knowledge about the brain cholesterol metabolism with molecular mechanisms. 
Due to their non-charged character, liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) measurements of oxysterols are often performed after derivatization with e.g. charged Girard reagents. However, derivatization reactions are time-consuming and may require numerous steps to remove excess reagent. In addition, extensive sample handling can be associated with cholesterol autoxidation, resulting in analyte artifacts and hence false positives. Nano scale liquid chromatography in combination with electrospray-mass spectrometry (nanoLC-ESI-MS) is a powerful tool for analyzing limited samples, due to substantially increased sensitivity compared to conventional LC-ESI-MS. The signal enhancement may compensate for the poor ionization of the oxysterols; hence we have explored the possibility to quantify oxysterols without derivatization using nanoLC-ESI-MS. Non-derivatized oxysterols and nanoLC were however not compatible, due to persistent and large carry-over. This was attributed to the extended contribution of surface to volume ratio in such miniaturized systems and interactions with the materials of the nanoLC instrumentation (e.g. adsorption to the fused silica tubing). Two contemporary MS instruments (Q-Exactive™ hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap and TSQ Quantiva™ triple quadrupole) were used. However, both the MS and MS/MS spectra of non-derivatized oxysterols were ambiguous and/or unrepeatable for both of the instruments employed. Derivatizing oxysterols is more cumbersome, but provides more selective and reliable results, and Girard derivatization+nanoLC-ESI-MS continues to be our recommended choice for measuring oxysterols in very limited samples. These investigations also indicate that extra care should be taken to remove lipids prior to nanoLC of other analytes, as adsorbed oxysterols, etc. can compromise analysis. 
Hypertension is a high-risk symptom in atherosclerotic patients, and vascular rigidity is one of the main factors leading to hypertension. β1-Subunit of BKCa channel (KCNMB1; MaxiKβ1) has been reported as a modulator of vascular flexibility. To determine the relationship between atherosclerosis and KCNMB1, we studied some atherogenic factors affecting vascular tone. Blood of atherosclerotic patients shows increased concentration of 7-ketocholesterol (7K), which has been studied as a harmful lipid to blood vessels. Our data showed that KCNMB1 was significantly down-regulated in the presence of 7K, in a dose-/time-dependent manner in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). And, the reduction of KCNMB1 was confirmed in cell images of 7K-stimulated VSMCs and in vessel tissue images of ApoE knock-out mice. To determine whether aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) was involved in the reduction of KCNMB1 by 7K-stimulation, protein level of AhR was analyzed by Western blot. Our data showed that the reduction of KCNMB1 was modulated through the AhR pathway. In conclusion, results of our study suggest that 7K induces the reduction of KCNMB1 through the AhR pathway. 
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are a large family of constitutive and inducible mono-oxygenase enzymes that play a central role in the oxidative metabolism of both xenobiotic and endogenous compounds. Several CYPs are involved in metabolism of oxysterols, which are cholesterol oxidation products whose expression may be dysregulated in inflammation-related diseases including cancer. This study focused on CYP39A1, which can metabolize 24-hydroxycholesterol (24-OH) that plays important roles in the inflammatory response and oxidative stress. We aimed to investigate the expression status of CYP39A1 and its transcription factor (RUNX2) in relation to clinical significance in cholangiocarcinoma (CCAs) and to determine whether 24-OH could induce oxidative stress in CCA cell lines. Immunohistochemistry showed that 70% and 30% of CCA patients had low and high expression of CYP39A1, respectively. Low expression of CYP39A1 demonstrated a significant correlation with metastasis. Our results also revealed that the expression of RUNX2 had a positive correlation with CYP39A1. Low expression of both CYP39A1 (70%) and RUNX2 (37%) was significantly related with poor prognosis of CCA patients. Interestingly, oxidized alpha-1 antitrypsin (ox-A1AT), an oxidative stress marker, was significantly increased in CCA tissues in which CYP39A1 and RUNX2 were down regulated. Additionally, immunocytochemistry showed that 24-OH could induce ox-A1AT in CCA cell lines. In conclusion, our study revealed putative roles of the CYP39A1 enzyme in prognostic determination of CCAs. 
Cytochromes P450 (CYP) are a large family of enzymes widely involved in hepatic drug metabolism. While most CYP are extensively expressed in the liver, some of them are also detected in the heart where they participate through arachidonic acid metabolism to a variety of eicosanoids synthesis with different cardiovascular effects. Studies performed in the last years reported that several isoenzymes of microsomal CYP (i.e. CYP 2J2, CYP 2C8, CYP 2C9, CYP 4F) can play a role in the pathogenesis of ischemia-reperfusion. Moreover, various data indicate that microsomal CYP could represent a relevant target to develop pharmacological therapies to attenuate ischemia-reperfusion injury in the heart. As mitochondria appear to play a central role during ischemia-reperfusion, mitochondrial CYP, mainly involved in steroid hormone biosynthesis, could also become potential therapeutic target for cardioprotective strategies. Indeed, CYP 11A1 and CYP 27A1 could contribute to the preservation of the mitochondrial integrity by limiting the formation and enhancing elimination of toxic oxysterols. Further studies are required to explore whether modulation of these mitochondrial CYP could really produce cardioprotection in the human heart. 
Cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and vascular calcification are a major cause of death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recently, the long-awaited results of the Study of Heart and Renal Protection trial were reported. This large randomized clinical trial found that an extensive cholesterol-lowering therapy through the combination of simvastatin and ezetimibe significantly reduced cardiovascular diseases in a wide range of patients with CKD. However, the mechanism by which this cholesterol-lowering therapy reduces CKD-dependent vascular diseases remains elusive. The objective of the present study was to determine the contribution of the oxysterol-induced pro-apoptotic transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) on the pathogenesis of CKD-dependent cardiovascular diseases through endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling.
CKD increased levels of serum oxysterols such as 7-ketocholesterol in human patients and ApoE(-/-) mice. Treatment with simvastatin plus ezetimibe strongly reduced levels of serum oxysterols and attenuated CKD-dependent atherosclerosis, vascular cell death, vascular calcification, and cardiac dysfunction. This therapy also reduced aortic endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by CKD. The short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of CHOP and activating transcription factor-4 in vascular smooth muscle cells attenuated oxysterol-induced mineralization, osteogenic differentiation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. In addition, CHOP deficiency protected ApoE(-/-) mice from CKD-dependent vascular calcification, cardiac dysfunction, and vascular cell death.
These data reveal that the cholesterol-lowering therapy of simvastatin plus ezetimibe attenuates CKD-dependent vascular diseases through a reduction of oxysterol-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress. CHOP plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of CKD-dependent vascular calcification.
Our current understanding of oxysterol metabolism during different disease states such as obesity and dyslipidemia is limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of diet-induced obesity on the tissue distribution of various oxysterols and the mRNA expression of key enzymes involved in oxysterol metabolism. To induce obesity, male C57BL/6J mice were fed a high fat-cholesterol diet for 24 weeks. Following diet-induced obesity, plasma levels of 4 β -hydroxycholesterol, 5,6 α -epoxycholesterol, 5,6 β -epoxycholesterol, 7 α -hydroxycholesterol, 7 β -hydroxycholesterol, and 27-hydroxycholesterol were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) increased. In the liver and adipose tissue of the obese mice, 4 β -hydroxycholesterol was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) increased, whereas 27-hydroxycholesterol was increased only in the adipose tissue. No significant changes in either hepatic or adipose tissue mRNA expression were observed for oxysterol synthesizing enzymes 4 β -hydroxylase, 27-hydroxylase, or 7 α -hydroxylase. Hepatic mRNA expression of SULT2B1b, a key enzyme involved in oxysterol detoxification, was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) elevated in the obese mice. Interestingly, the appearance of the large HDL1 lipoprotein was observed with increased oxysterol synthesis during obesity. In diet-induced obese mice, dietary intake and endogenous enzymatic synthesis of oxysterols could not account for the increased oxysterol levels, suggesting that nonenzymatic cholesterol oxidation pathways may be responsible for the changes in oxysterol metabolism. 
Phytosterols such as campesterol and sitosterol are susceptible to oxidation by reactive oxygen species. We hypothesize that the plant sterols (PS) campesterol and sitosterol and their 7-oxygenated metabolites (POPs) correlate within and between human plasma and aortic valve cusps tissues. Plasma and tissue concentrations of PS and POPs were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-selected ion monitoring. Prior to analysis valve cusps tissue was mechanically separated from the calcified parts. PS and POP levels per dry cusps tissue weight were significantly higher compared with the concentrations in the calcified part. Against our hypothesis we found that despite the fact that there is a high correlation between plant sterols in and between plasma and valves cusps tissue, as well as a high correlation between plant sterols and oxyphytosterols and oxyphytosterols themselves within the valve cusps tissue, there was hardly any correlation in the amount of oxyphytosterols in plasma and between plasma and valves. Because plasma samples are easily accessible for large scale population based studies, we have to understand in more detail what the analysis of POPs implies in terms of CVD risk for the future. 
Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome (SLOS) is a recessive hereditary disease caused by an enzymatic defect in the biosynthesis of cholesterol. To date, the therapeutic standard of care for this disease has been cholesterol supplementation therapy. However, the efficacy of this treatment is extremely variable and, in many if not most cases, is poor. Results of studies using animal models of SLOS have suggested that cholesterol deficiencyand/or the aberrant accumulation of the immediate precursor of cholesterol (7-dehydrocholesterol (7DHC)), per se, may not be the sole culprits in the pathobiology of this disease. Rather, cytotoxic oxysterol by-products derived specifically from 7DHC are thought to be additional, significant, causative players in the disease mechanism. Based in large measure upon such studies, a recent clinical trial, comparing the therapeutic efficacyof cholesterol supplementation alone vs. combined cholesterol-antioxidant supplementation in SLOS patients, has provided extremely encouraging results that tend to both validate the proposed role of oxysterols in the pathobiology of SLOS as well as indicate an improved treatment for this and related diseases.
The present study investigated the induction and possible role of activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) in the corpus luteum. Postpubertal cattle were treated at midcycle with prostaglandin F2α(PGF) for 0-4 hours. Luteal tissue was processed for immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and isolation of protein and RNA. Ovaries were also collected from midluteal phase and first-trimester pregnant cows. Luteal cells were prepared and sorted by centrifugal elutriation to obtain purified small (SLCs) and large luteal cells (LLCs). Real-time PCR and in situ hybridization showed that ATF3 mRNA increased within 1 hour of PGF treatment in vivo. Western blot and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that ATF3 protein was expressed in the nuclei of LLC within 1 hour and was maintained for at least 4 hours. PGF treatment in vitro increased ATF3 expression only in LLC, whereas TNF induced ATF3 in both SLCs and LLCs. PGF stimulated concentration- and time-dependent increases in ATF3 and phosphorylation of MAPKs in LLCs. Combinations of MAPK inhibitors suppressed ATF3 expression in LLCs. Adenoviral-mediated expression of ATF3 inhibited LH-stimulated cAMP response element reporter luciferase activity and progesterone production in LLCs and SLCs but did not alter cell viability or change the expression or activity of key regulators of progesterone synthesis. In conclusion, the action of PGF in LLCs is associated with the rapid activation of stress-activated protein kinases and the induction of ATF3, which may contribute to the reduction in steroid synthesis during luteal regression. ATF3 appears to affect gonadotropin-stimulated progesterone secretion at a step or steps downstream of PKA signaling and before cholesterol conversion to progesterone. 
A rapid liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the quantification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived free oxysterols and cholesterol in human plasma and atherosclerotic plaque.
In vitro autoxidation of cholesterol during sample pretreatment was avoided by applying only one protein precipitation and re-concentration step using 80 μl plasma. For preparation of 10mg atherosclerotic plaques an additional liquid-liquid extraction was included. Free 7-keto-, 7-α/ß-hydroxy-, 5,6-α-epoxy-, 5,6-β-epoxycholesterol, cholestane-3ß,5α,6ß-triol and cholesterol were separated within 7 min on a monolithic column. An API 4000 tandem mass spectrometer was applied in positive ionization mode using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization.
The detection limit was 0.1 ng/ml and the linearity ranged from 0.5 to 0.75 to 2000 ng/ml for the oxysterols and from 50 to 1000 μg/ml for cholesterol. Recovery was between 80.9 and 107.9%. Between-run imprecision ranged from 7.9 to 11.7%. Analysis of plasma samples from additional 50 middle-aged volunteers revealed a large inter-individual variability (e.g. 7-ketocholesterol 2.63-30.47 ng/ml). Oxysterol concentrations normalized to cholesterol were about 43 times higher in carotid plaque compared to plasma (n=5).
This rapid LC-MS/MS method enables reliable quantification focused on especially ROS-derived oxysterols in human plasma and atherosclerotic plaque samples under high-throughput conditions.
Human atherosclerotic plaque is composed of a large mixture of elements, predominantly lipids and oxidized lipids, lipid-loaded macrophages and smooth muscle cells, forming foam cells. Plaque contents undergo dynamic changes during the plaque's progression, being in a constant interaction with the circulating blood. During the mutual interaction between blood and plaque and the specific biochemical processes occurring in both, specific molecules can be generated in the serum which might provide information on plaque status. This information, mostly on plaque vulnerability, is highly important for making appropriate treatment decisions before neurological symptoms appear. The present review summarizes plaque contents, mostly lipids, oxidized lipids, oxidized products of cholesterol (oxysterols), and covers the recent literature on their association with biomarkers in the blood and on the possibility of using them for providing information on plaque status.
Oxysterols are present in mammalian brain at ng/g-μg/g levels while cholesterol is present at the mg/g level. This makes oxysterol analysis of brain challenging. In an effort to meet this challenge we have developed, and validated, an isolation method based on solid phase extraction and an analytical protocol involving oxidation/derivatisation (i.e., charge-tagging) followed by nano-flow liquid chromatography (nano-LC) combined with tandem mass spectrometry utilising multi-stage fragmentation (MS(n)). The oxidation/derivatisation method employed improves detection limits by two orders of magnitude, while nano-LC-MS(n) provides separation of isomers and allows oxysterol quantification. Using this method 13 different oxysterols have been identified in rat brain including 24S-hydroxycholesterol, 24S,25-epoxycholesterol and 7α,26-dihydroxycholest-4-en-3-one. The level of 24S-hydroxycholesterol in rat brain was determined to be 20.3±3.4 μg/g and quantitative estimates were made for the other oxysterols identified. The presence of a large excess of cholesterol over oxysterol in brain raises the problem of autoxidation during sterol isolation and sample preparation. Thus, in parallel to identification studies, the degree of cholesterol autoxidation occurring during sterol isolation and analysis has been evaluated with the aid of [(2)H(7)]-labelled cholesterol and cholesterol autoxidation products identified.
The retinoid acid receptor-related orphan receptors (RORs) represent important targets for the treatment of metabolic and immune disorders. Here the authors describe the application of AlphaScreen(®) technology to develop a high-throughput screening (HTS)-compatible assay to facilitate the discovery of RORα modulators. Using the ligand binding domain (LBD) of RORα and a peptide derived from the NR1 box of the nuclear receptor coactivator PGC-1α, a 384-well format assay was developed exhibiting high sensitivity, requiring only low nanomolar concentration of reagents. Recently, it was shown that oxysterols such as 7α-hydroxycholesterol (7α-OHC) function as modulators of the RORs. In this assay, 7α-OHC produced a concentration-response curve with an EC(50) of 162 nM, a Z' factor of 0.6, and a signal-to-background (S/B) ratio of 4.2, demonstrating that the assay is HTS compatible. Validation of the assay was afforded by screening against the Sigma LOPAC1280™ library in a 384-well format. In summary, the results presented here demonstrate that this assay can be used to screen large chemical libraries to discover novel modulators of RORα.
All three cholesterol oxidation products implicated thus far in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, 7β-hydroxycholesterol, 24-hydroxycholesterol, and 27-hydroxycholesterol, markedly enhance the binding of amyloid-beta (Aβ) to human differentiated neuronal cell lines (SK-N-BE and NT-2) by up-regulating net expression and synthesis of CD36 and β1-integrin receptors. However, only 24-hydroxycholesterol markedly potentiates the pro-apoptotic and pro-necrogenic effects of Aβ(1-42) peptide on these cells: 7β-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol, like unoxidized cholesterol, show no potentiating effect. This peculiar behavior of 24-hydroxycholesterol at physiologic concentrations (1 μm) depends on its strong enhancement of the intracellular generation of NADPH oxidase-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS), mainly H(2) O(2) , and the consequent impairment of neuronal cell redox equilibrium, measured in terms of the GSSG/GSH ratio. Cell incubation with antioxidants quercetin or genistein prevents 24-hydroxycholesterol's pro-oxidant effect and potentiation of Aβ-induced necrosis and apoptosis. Thus, the presence of 24-hydroxycholesterol in the close vicinity of amyloid plaques appears to enhance the adhesion of large amounts of Aβ to the plasma membrane of neurons and then to amplify the neurotoxic action of Aβ by locally increasing ROS steady-state levels. This report further supports a primary involvement of altered brain cholesterol metabolism in the complex pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
Complex polyphenols present in extravirgin olive oil are not directly absorbed, but undergo gastrointestinal biotransformation, increasing the relative amount of tyrosol (TYR) and hydroxytyrosol (HT) entering the small and large intestine. We investigated the capacity of TYR and HT to inhibit the insult of dietary lipid hydroperoxydes on the intestinal mucosa, using cultures of Caco-2, a cell line with enterocyte-like features, and studying the effect of tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBH) treatment on specific cell membrane lipid targets. The effect of homovanillic alcohol (HVA), metabolite of HT in humans and detected as metabolite of HT in Caco-2 cells, was also evaluated. Exposure to TBH induced a significant increase of the level of MDA, the formation of fatty acid hydroperoxides and 7-ketocholesterol and the loss of α-tocopherol. Pretreatment with both HT and HVA protected Caco-2 cells from oxidative damage: there was no significant detection of oxidation products and the level of α-tocopherol was preserved. Noteworthy, TYR also exerted a protective action against fatty acids degradation. In vitro trials, where the simple phenols were tested during linoleic acid and cholesterol oxidation, gave evidence of a direct scavenging of peroxyl radicals and suggested a hydrogen atom-donating activity.
Apolipoprotein M (apoM) plays an important role in the biogenesis and the metabolism of anti-atherogenic HDL particles in plasma and is expressed primarily in the liver and the kidney. We investigated the role of hormone nuclear receptors in apoM gene regulation in hepatic cells. Overexpression via adenovirus-mediated gene transfer and siRNA-mediated gene silencing established that hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF-4) is an important regulator of apoM gene transcription in hepatic cells. apoM promoter deletion analysis combined with DNA affinity precipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that HNF-4 binds to a hormone-response element (HRE) in the proximal apoM promoter (nucleotides -33 to -21). Mutagenesis of this HRE decreased basal hepatic apoM promoter activity to 10% of control and abolished the HNF4-mediated transactivation of the apoM promoter. In addition to HNF-4, homodimers of retinoid X receptor and heterodimers of retinoid X receptor with receptors for retinoic acid, thyroid hormone, fibrates (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor), and oxysterols (liver X receptor) were shown to bind with different affinities to the proximal HRE in vitro and in vivo. Ligands of these receptors strongly induced human apoM gene transcription and apoM promoter activity in HepG2 cells, whereas mutations in the proximal HRE abolished this induction. These findings provide novel insights into the role of apoM in the regulation of HDL by steroid hormones and into the development of novel HDL-based therapies for diseases such as diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and coronary artery disease that affect a large proportion of the population in Western countries.
Lifestyle factors and pharmacological compounds activate genetic mechanisms that influence the development of atherosclerotic and other diseases. This article reviews studies on natural and pharmacological gene activation that promotes health and enhances longevity.
Living habits including healthy diet and regular physical activity, and pharmacotherapy, upregulate genes encoding enzymes and apolipoprotein and ATP-binding cassette transporters, acting in metabolic processes that promote health and increase survival. Cytochrome P450-enzymes, physiological factors in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis, generate oxysterols for the elimination of surplus cholesterol. Hepatic CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase-alpha is an important regulator of plasma HDL-C level. Gene-activators produce plasma lipoprotein profile, high HDL-C, HDL2-C and HDL-C/cholesterol ratio, which is typical of low risk of atherosclerotic disease, and also of exceptional longevity together with reduced prevalence of cardiovascular, metabolic and other diseases. High HDL contributes to protection against inflammation, oxidation and thrombosis, and associates with good cognitive function in very old people. Avoiding unhealthy stress and managing it properly promotes health and increases life expectancy.
Healthy living habits and gene-activating xenobiotics upregulate mechanisms that produce lipoprotein pattern typical of very old people and enhance longevity. Lipoprotein metabolism and large HDL2 associate with the process of living a very long life. Major future goals for health promotion are the improving of commitment to both wise lifestyle choices and drug therapy, and further the developing of new and more effective and well tolerated drugs and treatments.
Fluorescence microscopy has become a powerful and standard complementary technique in the study of amphiphilic films at the air-water interface. For nearly three decades the coupling of traditional thermodynamic measurements with direct visualization has provided a better understanding of self-assembled Langmuir monolayers and their application in the study of the physical properties of membranes and interfaces. As an introduction we provide a brief overview of this established technique and demonstrate its continued utility in the recent observation of novel phase behavior in monolayers of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OH) and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC). We then focus our review on new analysis techniques which take advantage of the ability to store, process, and analyze large sets of images. We pay particular attention to efforts measuring the line tension between coexisting two dimensional fluid phases in the Langmuir monolayer. Using non-perturbative methods, we can measure fundamental mechanical properties of these two dimensional systems. Finally, we highlight the use of Model Convolution Microscopy as a new tool to provide insight on the experimental limits in these studies.
Oxysterols from steroid autooxidation have numerous harmful effects, but their biodegradation is poorly understood. Microarrays were used to study mineralization of the most common oxysterol, 7-ketocholesterol (7KC), by Rhodococcus jostii RHA1. Growth on 7KC versus growth on cholesterol resulted in 363 differentially expressed genes, including upregulation of two large gene clusters putatively encoding steroid catabolism. Despite this difference, 7KC degradation required key genes involved in cholesterol degradation, indicating a common catabolic route.
Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is a highly sensitive and specific technique. Thanks to the development of triple quadrupole analyzers, it is becoming more widely used in laboratories working in the field of inborn errors of metabolism. We review here the state of the art of this technique applied to the diagnosis of lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) and how MS/MS has changed the diagnostic rationale in recent years. This fine technology brings more sensitive, specific, and reliable methods than the previous biochemical ones for the analysis of urinary glycosaminoglycans, oligosaccharides, and sialic acid. In sphingolipidoses, the quantification of urinary sphingolipids (globotriaosylceramide, sulfatides) is possible. The measurement of new plasmatic biomarkers such as oxysterols, bile acids, and lysosphingolipids allows the screening of many sphingolipidoses and related disorders (Niemann-Pick type C), replacing tedious biochemical techniques. Applied to amniotic fluid, a more reliable prenatal diagnosis or screening of LSDs is now available for fetuses presenting with antenatal manifestations. Applied to enzyme measurements, it allows high throughput assays for the screening of large populations, even newborn screening. The advent of this new method can modify the diagnostic rationale behind LSDs.
Oxysterols are cholesterol derivatives that have been suggested to play a role in inflammatory diseases such as obesity, atherosclerosis, or neuroinflammatory diseases. However, the effect of neuroinflammation on oxysterol levels has only been partially studied so far.
We used an HPLC-MS method to quantify over ten oxysterols both in in vitro and in vivo models of neuroinflammation. In the same models, we used RT-qPCR to analyze the expression of the enzymes responsible for oxysterol metabolism. Using the BV2 microglial cell line, we explored the effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced (M1-type) and IL-4-induced (M2-type) cell activation on oxysterol levels. We also used LPS-activated co-cultures of mouse primary microglia and astrocytes. In vivo, we induced a neuroinflammation by administering LPS to mice. Finally, we used a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, namely the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, that is characterized by demyelination and neuroinflammation.
In vitro, we found that LPS activation induces profound alterations in oxysterol levels. Interestingly, we could discriminate between control and LPS-activated cells based on the changes in oxysterol levels both in BV2 cells and in the primary co-culture of glial cells. In vivo, the changes in oxysterol levels were less marked than in vitro. However, we found in both models increased levels of the GPR183 agonist 7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol. Furthermore, we studied in vitro the effect of 14 oxysterols on the mRNA expression of inflammatory markers in LPS-activated co-culture of microglia and astrocytes. We found that several oxysterols decreased the LPS-induced expression of pro-inflammatory markers.
These data demonstrate that inflammation profoundly affects oxysterol levels and that oxysterols can modulate glial cell activation. This further supports the interest of a large screening of oxysterol levels when studying the interplay between neuroinflammation and bioactive lipids.
ATP-binding cassette G1 (ABCG1) is a member of the large family of ABC transporters which are involved in the active transport of many amphiphilic and lipophilic molecules including lipids, drugs or endogenous metabolites. It is now well established that ABCG1 promotes the export of lipids, including cholesterol, phospholipids, sphingomyelin and oxysterols, and plays a key role in the maintenance of tissue lipid homeostasis. Although ABCG1 was initially proposed to mediate cholesterol efflux from macrophages and then to protect against atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases (CVD), it becomes now clear that ABCG1 exerts a larger spectrum of actions which are of major importance in cardiometabolic diseases (CMD). Beyond a role in cellular lipid homeostasis, ABCG1 equally participates to glucose and lipid metabolism by controlling the secretion and activity of insulin and lipoprotein lipase. Moreover, there is now a growing body of evidence suggesting that modulation of ABCG1 expression might contribute to the development of diabetes and obesity, which are major risk factors of CVD. In order to provide the current understanding of the action of ABCG1 in CMD, we here reviewed major findings obtained from studies in mice together with data from the genetic and epigenetic analysis of ABCG1 in the context of CMD.
Oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) and its related proteins (ORPs) constitute a large, evolutionarily conserved family of lipid-binding proteins that are associated with a wide range of cellular activities. The core function of OSBP/ORPs appears to be moving lipids between cellular membranes in a non-vesicular manner. Recent studies have unveiled a novel, counter-transport mechanism of cellular lipid transfer mediated by OSBP/ORPs at the membrane contact sites that involves phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate. Importantly, the OSBP/ORPs family has also been implicated in cell signalling pathways and cancer development. Here, we summarize recent progress in understanding the role of OSBP/ORPs in cancer development, and discuss how the lipid transfer function of OSBP/ORPs may underpin their role in tumorigenesis.
Management of degenerative spine pathologies frequently leads to the need for spinal fusion (SF), where bone growth is induced toward stabilization of the interventioned spine. Autologous bone graft (ABG) remains the gold-standard inducer, whereas new bone graft substitutes attempt to achieve effective de novo bone formation and solid fusion. Limited fusion outcomes have driven motivation for more sophisticated and multidisciplinary solutions, involving new biomaterials and/or biologics, through innovative delivery platforms. The present review will analyze the most recent body of literature that is focused on new approaches for consistent bone fusion of spinal vertebrae, including the development of new biomaterials that pursue physical and chemical aptitudes; the delivery of growth factors (GF) to accelerate new bone formation; and the use of cells to improve functional bone development. Bone graft substitutes currently in clinical practice, such as demineralized bone matrix and ceramics, are still used as a starting point for the study of new bioactive agents. Polyesters such as polycaprolactone and polylactic acid arise as platforms for the development of composites, where a mineral element and cell/GF constitute the delivery system. Exciting fusion outcomes were obtained in several small and large animal models with these. On what regards bioactive agents, mesenchymal stem cells, preferentially derived from the bone marrow or adipose tissue, were studied in this context. Autologous and allogeneic approaches, as well as osteogenically differentiated cells, have been tested. These cell sources have further been genetically engineered for specific GF expression. Nevertheless, results on fusion efficacy with cells have been inconsistent. On the other hand, the delivery of GF (most commonly bone morphogenetic protein-2 [BMP-2]) has provided favorable outcomes. Complications related to burst release and dosing are still the target of research through the development of controlled release systems or alternative GF such as Nel-like molecule-1 (NELL-1), Oxysterols, or COMP-Ang1. Promising solutions with new biomaterial and GF compositions are becoming closer to the human patient, as these evidence high-fusion performance, while offering cost and safety advantages. The use of cells has not yet proved solid benefits, whereas a further understanding of cell behavior remains a challenge.
Based on the significance of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in health and disease, this review focuses on human studies addressing oxidation of LDL, including three lines of biomarkers, (i) ex vivo LDL resistance to oxidation, a "challenge test" model, (ii) circulating oxidized LDL, indicating the "current in vivo status", and (iii) autoantibodies against oxidized LDL as fingerprints of an immune response to oxidized LDL, along with circulating oxysterols and 4-hydroxynonenal as biomarkers of lipid peroxidation. Lipid peroxidation and oxidized LDL are hallmarks in the development of various metabolic, cardiovascular and other diseases. Changes further occur across life stages from infancy to older age as well as in athletes and smokers. Given their responsiveness to targeted nutritional interventions, markers of LDL oxidation have been employed in a rapidly growing number of human studies for more than 2 decades. There is growing interest in foods, which, besides providing energy and nutrients, exert beneficial effects on human health, such as protection of DNA, proteins and lipids from oxidative damage. Any health claim, however, needs to be substantiated by supportive evidence derived from human studies, using reliable biomarkers to demonstrate such beneficial effects. A large body of evidence has accumulated, demonstrating protection of LDL from oxidation by bioactive food compounds, including vitamins, other micronutrients and secondary plant ingredients, which will facilitate the selection of oxidation biomarkers for future human intervention studies and health claim support.
Lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) is a modified low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle with an additional specific apolipoprotein (a), covalently attached to apolipoprotein B‑100 of LDL by a single thioester bond. Increased plasma Lp(a) level is a genetically determined, independent, causal risk factor for cardiovascular disease.The precise quantification of Lp(a) in plasma is still hampered by mass-sensitive assays, large particle variation, poor standardization and lack of assay comparability.The physiological functions of Lp(a) include wound healing, promoting tissue repair and vascular remodeling. Similarly to other lipoproteins, Lp(a) is also susceptible for oxidative modifications, leading to extensive formation of pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic oxidized phospholipids, oxysterols, oxidized lipid-protein adducts in Lp(a) particles, that perpetuate atherosclerotic lesion progression and intima-media thickening through induction of M1-macrophages, inflammation, autoimmunity and apoptosis. The oxidation-specific epitopes of modified lipoproteins are major targets of pre-immune, natural IgM antibodies, that may attenuate the pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic effects of Lp(a).Although the data are still insufficient, recent studies suggest a potential anti-neoplastic role of Lp(a).
Lipid peroxidation, the oxidative degradation of membrane lipids by reactive oxygen species generates a large variety of breakdown products such as alkanes, aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, furans and others. Due to their reactivity aldehydes (alkanals, 2-alkenals, 2,4-alkadienals, 4-hydroxyalkenals) received a lot of attention, in particular because they can diffuse from the site of formation and interact with proteins and nucleic acids thus acting as second toxic messengers. The major aldehydic peroxidation product of membrane lipids is 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE). Since HNE and other 4-hydroxyalkenals are strong alkylating agents they have therefore been considered to be the biologically most important peroxidation products. Although initially research focused on the toxicological potential of these compounds it is now well known that they play also a crucial role in cell signaling under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Thus, it is obvious that the biological effects will be determined by the intracellular concentrations which can trigger adaptation, DNA damage and cell death. This review will not cover all these aspects but will concentrate on the genotoxic properties of selected lipid oxidation products important in the context of pathophysiological developments together with a chapter on epigenetic modifications.
Individual variability in the endogenous CYP3A metabolite 4β-hydroxycholesterol (4βOHC) is substantial, but to which extent this is determined by genetic and nongenetic factors remains unclear. The aim of the study was to evaluate the explanatory power of candidate genetic variants and key nongenetic factors on individual variability in 4βOHC levels in a large naturalistic patient population.
We measured 4βOHC concentration in serum samples from 655 patients and used multiple linear regression analysis to estimate the quantitative effects of CYP3A4*22, CYP3A5*3, and POR*28 variant alleles, comedication with CYP3A inducers, inhibitors and substrates, sex, and age on individual 4βOHC levels.
4βOHC concentration ranged &gt;100-fold in the population, and the multiple linear regression model explained about one fourth of the variability (R 2 = 0.23). Only comedication with inducers or inhibitors, sex, and POR genotype were significantly associated with individual variability in 4βOHC level. The estimated quantitative effects on 4βOHC levels were greatest for inducer comedication (+&gt;313%, P &lt; 0.001), inhibitor comedication (-34%, P = 0.021), and female sex (+30%, P &lt; 0.001), while only a modestly elevated 4βOHC level was observed in carriers vs. noncarriers of POR*28 (+11%, P = 0.023).
These findings suggest that the CYP3A4*22, CYP3A5*3, and POR*28 variant alleles are of limited importance for overall individual variability in 4βOHC levels compared to nongenetic factors.
Hypercholesterolemia has been implicated in numerous health problems from cardiovascular disease to neurodegeneration. High serum cholesterol levels in midlife have been associated with an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) later in life which suggests that the pathways leading to AD pathology might be activated decades before the symptoms of the disease are detected. Cholesterol-fed animals, particularly cholesterol-fed rabbits, exhibit brain pathology similar to the changes found in brains of AD patients. Dietary cholesterol, which cannot pass the blood-brain barrier, is thought to influence central nervous system homeostasis by increased transport of its circulatory breakdown product, 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC), into the brain. 27-OHC is an endogenous selective estrogen receptor modulator. Estrogen-mediated non-reproductive functions require estrogen receptors (ERs) and include modulation of mitochondrial function and structure, as well as regulation of synaptogenesis in the brain. ERs are located in brain areas affected early in AD pathogenesis, including the hippocampus. Here we report that increase in serum cholesterol, induced by feeding rabbits a high-cholesterol diet, is associated with higher levels of 27-OHC in the brain as well as increased levels of neurodegeneration in the hippocampus. Furthermore, these results are accompanied by changes in expression of ERs in the hippocampus as well as a decrease in hippocampal mitochondria. These findings provide an important insight into one of the possible mechanisms involved in the development of AD, and shed light on the processes that may antedate amyloid-β and tau phosphorylation changes currently hypothesized to cause AD symptomology and pathology.
For years food consumers have been warned that a cholesterol-rich diet may result in atherosclerosis. It is also well known that consumption of large amounts of phytosterols decreases concentration of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) in blood (LDLs are regarded a key risk factor in development of cardiovascular diseases). However, no scientific evidence has unambiguously proved any direct connection between amount of consumed cholesterol and LDL level in blood. On the other hand, concentration of cholesterol oxidation products, oxysterols, seems to be indeed relevant; for example, they significantly impact appearance of atherosclerotic lesions (plaques). Phytosterols (like sitosterol or campasterol) decrease LDL level in blood, but on the other hand products of their oxidation are toxic. Therefore, it is worth to know influence of phytosterols on living organisms, processes which lead to their formation, and their levels in popular foodstuffs. This paper is an attempt to review literature data on the above aspects, as well as on impact on living organisms of oxidation products of popular sterols.
Classical non-peptide hormones, such as steroids, retinoids, thyroid hormones, vitamin D3 and their derivatives including prostaglandins, benzoates, oxysterols, and bile acids, are collectively designated as small lipophilic ligands, acting via binding to the nuclear receptors (NRs). The NRs form a large superfamily of transcription factors that participate virtually in every key biological process. They control various aspects of animal development, fertility, gametogenesis, and numerous metabolic pathways, and can be misregulated in many types of cancers. Their enormous functional plasticity, as transcription factors, relates in part to NR-mediated interactions with plethora of coregulatory proteins upon ligand binding to their ligand binding domains (LBD), or following covalent modification. Here, we review some general views of a specific group of NR coregulators, so-called nuclear receptor coactivators (NRCs) or steroid receptor coactivators (SRCs) and highlight some of their unique functions/roles, which are less extensively mentioned and discussed in other reviews. We also try to pinpoint few neglected moments in the cooperative action of SRCs, which may also indicate their variable roles in the hormone-independent signaling pathways. 
Cholesterol is an important constituent of cell membranes and plays a crucial role in the compartmentalization of the plasma membrane and signaling. Brain cholesterol accounts for a large proportion of the body's total cholesterol, existing in two pools: the plasma membranes of neurons and glial cells and the myelin membranes . Cholesterol has been recently shown to be important for synaptic transmission, and a link between cholesterol metabolism defects and neurodegenerative disorders is now recognized. Many neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by impaired cholesterol turnover in the brain. However, at which stage the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway is perturbed and how this contributes to pathogenesis remains unknown. Cognitive deficits and neurodegeneration may be associated with impaired synaptic transduction. Defects in cholesterol biosynthesis can trigger dysfunction of synaptic transmission. In this review, an overview of cholesterol turnover under physiological and pathological conditions is presented (Huntington's, Niemann-Pick type C diseases, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome). We will discuss possible mechanisms by which cholesterol content in the plasma membrane influences synaptic processes. Changes in cholesterol metabolism in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and autistic disorders are beyond the scope of this review and will be summarized in our next paper. 
Oxysterols are a family of cholesterol oxidation derivatives that contain an additional hydroxyl, epoxide or ketone group in the sterol nucleus and/or a hydroxyl group in the side chain. The majority of oxysterols in the blood are of endogenous origin, derived from cholesterol via either enzymatic or non-enzymatic mechanisms. A large number of reports demonstrate multiple physiological roles of specific oxysterols. One such role is the inhibition of viral replication. This biochemical/biological property was first characterised against a number of viruses endowed with an external lipid membrane (enveloped viruses), although antiviral activity has since been observed in relation to several non-enveloped viruses. In the present paper, we review the recent findings about the broad antiviral activity of oxysterols against enveloped and non-enveloped human viral pathogens, and provide an overview of their putative antiviral mechnism(s).
Endothelial cells respond to a large range of stimuli including circulating lipoproteins, growth factors and changes in haemodynamic mechanical forces to regulate the activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and maintain blood pressure. While many signalling pathways have been mapped, the identities of membrane domains through which these signals are transmitted are less well characterized. Here, we manipulated bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) with cholesterol and the oxysterol 7-ketocholesterol (7KC). Using a range of microscopy techniques including confocal, 2-photon, super-resolution and electron microscopy, we found that sterol enrichment had differential effects on eNOS and caveolin-1 (Cav1) colocalisation, membrane order of the plasma membrane, caveolae numbers and Cav1 clustering. We found a correlation between cholesterol-induced condensation of the plasma membrane and enhanced high density lipoprotein (HDL)-induced eNOS activity and phosphorylation suggesting that cholesterol domains, but not individual caveolae, mediate HDL stimulation of eNOS. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced and shear stress-induced eNOS activity was relatively independent of membrane order and may be predominantly controlled by the number of caveolae on the cell surface. Taken together, our data suggest that signals that activate and phosphorylate eNOS are transmitted through distinct membrane domains in endothelial cells. 
This study aimed to evaluate plasma 4β-hydroxycholesterol as an endogenous marker of CYP3A4/5 activity in early postpartum women and its impact on the plasma disposition of amlodipine. Twenty-seven early postpartum women treated with amlodipine for pregnancy-induced hypertension were enrolled. The plasma concentration of 4β-hydroxycholesterol and its ratio to cholesterol in postpartum and in non-perinatal women were evaluated. The predose plasma concentration of amlodipine was determined at steady state. The medians of the plasma 4β-hydroxycholesterol concentration at day 0-3 and 8-21 after delivery were 146 and 161 ng/mL, respectively. No significant difference was observed in the plasma concentration of 4β-hydroxycholesterol between the postpartum periods. The plasma concentration of 4β-hydroxycholesterol and its ratio to cholesterol in postpartum women were significantly higher than those in non-perinatal women. A large individual variability was observed in the dose-normalized plasma concentration of amlodipine in early postpartum women. A weak negative correlation was observed between the dose-normalized plasma concentration of amlodipine and the plasma concentration of 4β-hydroxycholesterol. In conclusion, early postpartum women possessed higher CYP3A activity based on plasma 4β-hydroxycholesterol and had a large pharmacokinetic variability in amlodipine. CYP3A activity during the early postpartum period had an effect on the plasma disposition of amlodipine. 
Endocrine therapies target the activation of the oestrogen receptor alpha (ERα) via distinct mechanisms, but it is not clear whether breast cancer cells can adapt to treatment using drug-specific mechanisms. Here we demonstrate that resistance emerges via drug-specific epigenetic reprogramming. Resistant cells display a spectrum of phenotypical changes with invasive phenotypes evolving in lines resistant to the aromatase inhibitor (AI). Orthogonal genomics analysis of reprogrammed regulatory regions identifies individual drug-induced epigenetic states involving large topologically associating domains (TADs) and the activation of super-enhancers. AI-resistant cells activate endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis (CB) through stable epigenetic activation in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, CB sparks the constitutive activation of oestrogen receptors alpha (ERα) in AI-resistant cells, partly via the biosynthesis of 27-hydroxycholesterol. By targeting CB using statins, ERα binding is reduced and cell invasion is prevented. Epigenomic-led stratification can predict resistance to AI in a subset of ERα-positive patients. 
Cytochrome P450scc (CYP 11A1) catalyzes the conversion of cholesterol (Ch) to pregnenolone, the precursor to steroid hormones. This process proceeds via three sequential monooxygenation reactions: two hydroxylations of Ch first form 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (HC) and then 20α,22(R)-dihydroxycholesterol (DHC); a lyase reaction then cleaves the C20-C22 bond to form pregnenolone. Recent cryoreduction/annealing studies that employed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)/electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy [Davydov, R., et al. (2012) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 134, 17149] showed that compound I (Cpd I) is the active intermediate in the first step, hydroxylation of Ch. Herein, we have employed EPR and ENDOR spectroscopy to characterize the intermediates in the second and third steps of the enzymatic process, as conducted by 77 K radiolytic one-electron cryoreduction and subsequent annealing of the ternary oxy-cytochrome P450scc complexes with HC and DHC. This procedure is validated by showing that the cryoreduced ternary complexes of oxy-cytochrome P450scc with HC and DHC are catalytically competent and during annealing generate DHC and pregnenolone, respectively. Cryoreduction of the oxy-P450scc-HC ternary complex trapped at 77K produces the superoxo-ferrous P450scc intermediate along with a minor fraction of ferric hydroperoxo intermediates. The superoxo-ferrous intermediate converts into a ferric-hydroperoxo species after annealing at 145 K. During subsequent annealing at 170-180 K, the ferric-hydroperoxo intermediate converts to the primary product complex with the large solvent kinetic isotope effect that indicates Cpd I is being formed, and (1)H ENDOR measurements of the primary product formed in D2O demonstrate that Cpd I is the active species. They show that the primary product contains Fe(III) coordinated to the 20-O(1)H of DHC with the (1)H derived from substrate, the signature of the Cpd I reaction. Hydroperoxo ferric intermediates are the primary species formed during cryoreduction of the oxy-P450scc-DHC ternary complex, and they decay at 185 K with a strong solvent kinetic isotope effect to form low-spin ferric P450scc. Together, these observations indicated that Cpd I also is the active intermediate in the C20,22 lyase final step. In combination with our previous results, this study thus indicates that Cpd I is the active species in each of the three sequential monooxygenation reactions by which P450scc catalytically converts Ch to pregnenolone. 
Bone surfaces attract hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells, such as osteoclasts (OCs) and osteoblasts (OBs), and are targeted by bone metastatic cancers. However, the mechanisms guiding cells toward bone surfaces are essentially unknown. Here, we show that the Gαi protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) EBI2 is expressed in mouse monocyte/OC precursors (OCPs) and its oxysterol ligand 7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol (7α,25-OHC) is secreted abundantly by OBs. Using in vitro time-lapse microscopy and intravital two-photon microscopy, we show that EBI2 enhances the development of large OCs by promoting OCP motility, thus facilitating cell-cell interactions and fusion in vitro and in vivo. EBI2 is also necessary and sufficient for guiding OCPs toward bone surfaces. Interestingly, OCPs also secrete 7α,25-OHC, which promotes autocrine EBI2 signaling and reduces OCP migration toward bone surfaces in vivo. Defective EBI2 signaling led to increased bone mass in male mice and protected female mice from age- and estrogen deficiency-induced osteoporosis. This study identifies a novel pathway involved in OCP homing to the bone surface that may have significant therapeutic potential. 
Taxanes are anti-cancer agents used to treat several types of solid tumours. They are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A, displaying a large pharmacokinetic (PK) variability. In this study, we evaluated the endogenous CYP3A4 marker 4β-hydroxycholesterol (4β-OHC) as a potential individual taxane PK predictor.
Serum 4β-OHC and cholesterol concentrations were determined in 291 paclitaxel and 151 docetaxel-treated patients, and were subsequently correlated with taxane clearance.
In the patients treated with paclitaxel, no clinically relevant correlations between the 4β-OHC or 4β-OHC : cholesterol ratio and paclitaxel clearance were found. In the patients treated with docetaxel, 4β-OHC concentration was weakly correlated with docetaxel clearance in males (r = 0.35 P = 0.01, 95% CI 0.08, 0.58). Of the 10% patients with taxane outlier clearance values, 4β-OHC did correlate with docetaxel clearance in males (r = 0.76, P = 0.03, 95% CI 0.12, 0.95).
There was no clinical correlation between paclitaxel clearance and the CYP3A4 activity markers 4β-OHC or the 4β-OHC : cholesterol ratio. A weak correlation was observed between 4β-OHC and docetaxel clearance, but only in males. This endogenous CYP3A4 marker has limited predictive value for taxane clearance in patients.
Oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) is a high-affinity receptor for a variety of oxysterols, such as 25-hydroxycholesterol, that down-regulate cholesterol synthesis and stimulate cholesterol esterification. To examine a potential role for OSBP in regulating cholesterol metabolism, we stably overexpressed this protein in Chinese-hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells. Compared with mock-transfected controls, several cell lines overexpressing wild-type OSBP (CHO-OSBP) displayed a 50% decrease in cholesteryl ester synthesis when cultured in medium with delipidated serum, 25-hydroxycholesterol or low-density lipoprotein (LDL). CHO-OSBP cells showed a 40-60% decrease in acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activity and mRNA, a 50% elevation in mRNA for three sterol-regulated genes [LDL receptor, 3-hydroxy-3-methylgluraryl (HMG)-CoA reductase and HMG-CoA synthase], and an 80% increase in [14C]acetate incorporation into cholesterol. CHO-K1 cells overexpressing two OSBP mutants with a complete or N-terminal deletion of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain had cholesterol esterification and synthesis rates that were similar to those shown by mock-transfected controls. Unlike wild-type OSBP, both PH domain mutants displayed diffuse cytoplasmic immunofluorescence staining and did not translocate to the Golgi apparatus in the presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol. CHO-K1 cells overexpressing OSBP have pronounced alterations in cholesterol esterification and synthesis, indicating a potential role for this receptor in cholesterol homoeostasis. The phenotype observed in cells overexpressing OSBP is dependent on the PH domain, which appears to be necessary for ligand-dependent localization of OSBP to the Golgi apparatus.
The aim of this study was to take a combination of animal and cell culture approaches to examine the individual responses of vascular cells to varying inflammatory factors in order to gain insights on the mechanism(s) by which poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition promotes factors of plaque stability.
Apolipoprotein (ApoE(-/-)) mice fed a high-fat diet were used as a model of atherosclerosis. Primary endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and ex-vivo generated foam cells (FCs) were used in our in vitro studies. PARP inhibition significantly decreased the markers of oxidative stress and caspase-3 activation and increased smooth muscle actin within plaques from ApoE(-/-) mice fed a high-fat diet. PARP inhibition protected against apoptosis and/or necrosis in SMCs and endothelial cells in response to H(2)O(2) or tumour necrosis factor (TNF). Remarkably, PARP inhibition in FCs resulted in significant sensitization to 7-ketocholesterol (7-KC) by increasing cellular-toxic-free cholesterol, potentially through a down-regulation of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase-1 (ACAT-1) expression. 7-KC induced necrosis exclusively in endothelial cells, which was, surprisingly, unaffected by PARP inhibition indicating that PARP inhibition does not prevent all forms of necrotic cell death. In SMCs, PARP-1 inhibition by gene deletion conferred protection against 7-KC or TNF, potentially by reducing caspase-3-like activation, preventing induction of c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase phosphorylation, and inducing extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation independently of PARP classical enzymatic activity.
These data present PARP-1 as an important player in the death of cells constituting atherosclerotic plaques contributing to plaque dynamics. PARP inhibition may be a protective, a neutral, or a sensitizing factor. Additionally, PARP-1 may be a novel factor that can alter lipid metabolism. These novel functions of PARP not only challenge the current understanding of the role of the enzyme in cell death but also provide insights on the intricate contribution of PARP in cellular responses to predominant inflammatory factors within atherosclerotic plaques, presenting additional evidence for the viability of PARP inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for atherosclerosis.
The nuclear receptor LRH-1 (NR5A2) functions to regulate expression of a number of genes associated with bile acid homeostasis and other liver functions, but mechanisms that modulate its activity remain unclear. We have found that mitogenic stimuli, including treatment with phorbol myristate (PMA), increase LRH-1 transactivation. This response maps to the hinge and ligand binding domains of LRH-1 and is blocked by the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126. LRH-1 is a phosphoprotein and hinge domain serine residues at 238 and 243 are required for effective phosphorylation, both in vitro and in cells. Preventing phosphorylation of these residues by mutating both to alanine decreases PMA-dependent LRH-1 transactivation and mimicking phosphorylation by mutation to positively charged aspartate residues increases basal transactivation. Although serine phosphorylation of the hinge of SF-1 (NR5A1), the closest relative of LRH-1, confers a similar response, the specific targets differ in the two closely related orphan receptors. These results define a novel pathway for the modulation of LRH-1 transactivation and identify specific LRH-1 residues as downstream targets of mitogenic stimuli. This pathway may contribute to recently described proliferative functions of LRH-1.
Bile acids repress the transcription of cytochrome P450 7A1 (CYP7A1), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in bile acid biosynthesis. Although bile acids activate the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), the mechanism underlying bile acid-mediated repression of CYP7A1 remained unclear. We have used a potent, nonsteroidal FXR ligand to show that FXR induces expression of small heterodimer partner 1 (SHP-1), an atypical member of the nuclear receptor family that lacks a DNA-binding domain. SHP-1 represses expression of CYP7A1 by inhibiting the activity of liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1), an orphan nuclear receptor that is known to regulate CYP7A1 expression positively. This bile acid-activated regulatory cascade provides a molecular basis for the coordinate suppression of CYP7A1 and other genes involved in bile acid biosynthesis.
Bile acid biosynthesis is subjected to feedback regulation whereby bile acids down-regulate their own synthesis. The major point of this regulation is at the level of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (7alpha-hydroxylase), which controls bile acid output from the classic pathway. This regulation is at the level of transcription of the gene. Two bile acid response elements have been localized within the 5'-flanking region of the rat gene and these elements overlap three nuclear receptor binding sites for hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF-4), liver X receptor (LXR) and alpha(1)-fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF). Recently it has been shown that bile acids are physiological ligands for the farnesyl X receptor (FXR), which suggested that FXR could function by binding to one of the three nuclear receptor sites to mediate regulation of 7alpha-hydroxylase transcription by bile acids. In this study we show that FXR is indeed a crucial factor for bile acid-mediated regulation, but that it functions without binding to DNA. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that neither the LXR nor the HNF-4 sites are involved in bile acid-mediated regulation of 7alpha-hydroxylase transcription. Most importantly, we show that the FTF site is essential for regulation of 7alpha-hydroxylase by bile acids, similar to what we have recently demonstrated for another gene of the bile acid biosynthetic pathway, the sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase gene. These studies demonstrate the crucial role of FTF in the expression and regulation of a critical gene in the bile acid biosynthetic pathways.
Bile acids are required for intestinal absorption and biliary solubilization of cholesterol and lipids. In addition, bile acids play a crucial role in cholesterol homeostasis. One of the key enzymes in the bile acid biosynthetic pathways is cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase/cytochrome P450 7alpha-hydroxylase (7alpha-hydroxylase), which is the rate-limiting and regulatory step of the "classic" pathway. Transcription of the 7alpha-hydroxylase gene is highly regulated. Two nuclear receptors, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF-4alpha) and alpha(1)-fetoprotein transcription factor, are required for both transcription and regulation by different physiological events. It has been shown that some mitogen-activated protein kinases, such as the c-Jun N-terminal kinase and the ERK, play important roles in the regulation of 7alpha-hydroxylase transcription. In this study, we show evidence that the p38 kinase pathway plays an important role in 7alpha-hydroxylase expression and hence in bile acid synthesis. Inhibition of p38 kinase activity in primary hepatocytes results in approximately 5-10-fold reduction of 7alpha-hydroxylase mRNA. This suppression is mediated, at least in part, through HNF-4alpha. Inhibition of p38 kinase activity diminishes HNF-4alpha nuclear protein levels and its phosphorylation in vivo and in vitro, and it renders a less stable protein. Induction of the p38 kinase pathway by insulin results in an increase in HNF-4alpha protein and a concomitant induction of 7alpha-hydroxylase expression that is blocked by inhibiting the p38 pathway. These studies show a functional link between the p38 signaling pathway, HNF-4alpha, and bile acid synthesis.
Bile acids (BAs) are water-soluble end products from cholesterol metabolism and are essential for efficient absorption of dietary lipids. By using targeted somatic mutagenesis of the nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1) in mouse hepatocytes, we demonstrate here that LRH-1 critically regulates the physicochemical properties of BAs. The absence of LRH-1 and subsequent deficiency of Cyp8b1 eliminate the production of cholic acid and its amino acid conjugate taurocholic acid and increase the relative amounts of less amphipathic BA species. Intriguingly, while the expression of Cyp8b1 is almost extinguished in the livers of mice that lack LRH-1, the expression of the rate-limiting enzyme of BA synthesis, i.e., Cyp7a1, remains unchanged. The profound remodeling of the BA composition significantly reduces the efficacy of intestinal absorption of lipids and reuptake of BAs and facilitates the removal of lipids from the body. Our studies unequivocally demonstrate a pivotal role for LRH-1 in determining the composition of BAs, which, in turn has major consequences on whole-body lipid homeostasis.
Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) is a nuclear receptor that controls a variety of metabolic pathways. In cultured cells, LRH-1 induces the expression of CYP7A1 and CYP8B1, key enzymes in bile salt synthesis. However, hepatic Cyp7a1 mRNA levels were not reduced upon hepatocyte-specific Lrh-1 deletion in mice. The reason for this apparent paradox has remained elusive. We describe a novel conditional whole-body Lrh-1 knockdown (LRH-1-KD) mouse model to evaluate the dependency of bile salt synthesis and composition on LRH-1. Surprisingly, Cyp7a1 expression was increased rather than decreased under chow-fed conditions in LRH-1-KD mice. This coincided with a significant reduction in expression of intestinal Fgf15, a suppressor of Cyp7a1 expression, and a 58% increase in bile salt synthesis. However, when fecal bile salt loss was stimulated by feeding the bile salt sequestrant colesevelam, Cyp7a1 expression was up-regulated in wildtype mice but not in LRH-1-KD mice (+593% in wildtype versus +9% in LRH-1-KD). This translated into an increase in bile salt synthesis of +272% in wildtype versus +21% in LRH-1-KD mice.
Our data provide mechanistic insight into a missing link in the maintenance of bile salt homeostasis during enhanced fecal loss and support the view that LRH-1 controls Cyp7a1 expression from two distinct sites, i.e., liver and ileum, in the enterohepatic circulation.
Bile acids are physiological detergents that generate bile flow and facilitate intestinal absorption and transport of lipids, nutrients, and vitamins. Bile acids also are signaling molecules and inflammatory agents that rapidly activate nuclear receptors and cell signaling pathways that regulate lipid, glucose, and energy metabolism. The enterohepatic circulation of bile acids exerts important physiological functions not only in feedback inhibition of bile acid synthesis but also in control of whole-body lipid homeostasis. In the liver, bile acids activate a nuclear receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), that induces an atypical nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner, which subsequently inhibits nuclear receptors, liver-related homolog-1, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha and results in inhibiting transcription of the critical regulatory gene in bile acid synthesis, cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). In the intestine, FXR induces an intestinal hormone, fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15; or FGF19 in human), which activates hepatic FGF receptor 4 (FGFR4) signaling to inhibit bile acid synthesis. However, the mechanism by which FXR/FGF19/FGFR4 signaling inhibits CYP7A1 remains unknown. Bile acids are able to induce FGF19 in human hepatocytes, and the FGF19 autocrine pathway may exist in the human livers. Bile acids and bile acid receptors are therapeutic targets for development of drugs for treatment of cholestatic liver diseases, fatty liver diseases, diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) presents as a spectrum ranging from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The latter is progressive, and its pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Recently, bile acid (BA) metabolism has become a therapeutic focus in NASH patients. The aim of the present study was to explore changes in bile acid metabolism in NAFLD patients in the context of disease progression.
We prospectively enrolled patients with clinically suspected NAFLD. Patients taking ursodeoxycholic acid were excluded. The intrahepatic expression levels of genes associated with BA metabolism were determined by quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry.
Seventy-eight patients (male:female = 49:29) histologically diagnosed with NAFLD were analyzed. The expression levels of farnesoid X receptor, liver receptor homolog 1, and small heterodimer partner, key proteins in BA synthesis, significantly decreased as the NAFLD activity score (NAS) increased in either males or females. The levels of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme of BA synthesis, were not changed. Notably, the expression levels of a main export transporter, bile salt export pump (BSEP), significantly decreased as the NAS and the each NAS component increased in both genders. The decreases of BSEP levels were also observed by immunohistochemistry, particularly in areas with pronounced fatty changes in cases with high NAS.
The expression levels of the BA export transporter BSEP were inversely correlated with NAS in NAFLD patients. Such down-regulation may cause excessive BA levels in hepatocytes, leading to cell injury. Our findings may afford new insights into the pathogenesis of NASH.
Bile acids play significant role in body homeostasis regulation. They are products of cholesterol catabolism and ligands for some nuclear receptors regulating crucial metabolic pathways. The main enzyme regulating bile acids biosynthesis is CYP7A1 (7alpha-cholesterol hydroxylase). Its activity is controlled mainly at the transcription level and the key transcription factor is FXR. It is activated by other nuclear receptors like SHP, HNF-4alpha or LRH-1 and bile acids themselves, and represses CYP7A1 gene. The other transcription factors that inhibit CYP7A1 activity, are PXR, VDR, PPARalpha. The main activator is LXR (in rodents), increasing CYP7A1 transcriptional activity. CYP7A1 activity increases in presence of insulin and glucocorticoids. It is also regulated by diurnal rhythm. Some of those factors influence the activities of other bile acids biosynthesis enzymes--CYP7B1, CYP27A1, CYP8B1. Because of bile acids significant function in body metabolism this article presents the newest knowledge on mechanisms of key enzymes activities control.
alpha1-Antitrypsin (alpha1-AT) is a serum protease inhibitor that is synthesized mainly in the liver, and its rate of synthesis markedly increases in response to inflammation. This increase in alpha1-AT synthesis results in an increase in peptides, like its carboxyl-terminal C-36 peptide (C-36), resulting from alpha1-AT cleavage by proteases. Atherosclerosis is a form of chronic inflammation, and one of the risk factors is elevated plasma cholesterol levels. Because of the correlation between atherosclerosis, plasma cholesterol content, inflammation, and alpha1-AT rate of synthesis, we investigated the effect of the C-36 serpin peptide on hepatic bile acid biosynthesis. We discovered that C-36 is a powerful and specific transcriptional down-regulator of bile acid synthesis in primary rat hepatocytes, through inhibition of the cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase/CYP7A1 (7alpha-hydroxylase) promoter. Mice injected with the C-36 peptide also showed a decrease in 7alpha-hydroxylase mRNA. A mutated but very similar peptide did not have any effect on 7alpha-hydroxylase mRNA or its promoter. The sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase/CYP8B1 (12alpha-hydroxylase) promoter is also down-regulated by the C-36 peptide in HepG2 cells but not by the mutated peptide. The DNA element involved in the C-36-mediated regulation of 7alpha- and 12alpha-hydroxylase promoters mapped to the alpha1-fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF) site in both promoters. The C-36 peptide prevented binding of FTF to its target DNA recognition site by direct interaction with FTF. We hypothesize that the C-36 peptide specifically interacts with FTF and induces a conformational change that results in loss of its DNA binding ability, which results in suppression of 7alpha- and 12alpha-hydroxylase transcription. These results suggest that peptides derived from specific serum proteins may alter hepatic gene expression in a highly specific manner.
Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in the classical pathway of bile acids synthesis in liver and is crucial for maintaining lipid homeostasis. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) and α1-fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF) are two major transcription factors driving CYP7A1 promoter activity in hepatocytes. Previous researches have shown that Prospero-related homeobox (Prox1) directly interacts with both HNF4α and FTF and potently co-represses CYP7A1 transcription and bile acid synthesis through unidentified mechanisms. In this work, mechanisms involved in Prox1-mediated co-repression were explored by identifying Prox1-associated proteins using immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (IP-MS) methodology. Multiple components of the epigenetically repressive lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1)/nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase (NuRD) complex, most notably LSD1 and histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), were found to be associated with Prox1 and GST pulldown assay demonstrated that Prox1 directly interacts with LSD1. Sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed that Prox1 co-localizes with HNF4α, LSD1 and HDAC2 on CYP7A1 promoter in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, by using ChIP assay on HepG2 cells with endogenous Prox1 knocked down by RNA interference, Prox1 was shown to recruit LSD1 and HDAC2 onto CYP7A1 promoter and cause increased H3K4 demethylation. Finally, bile acids treatment of HepG2 cells, which significantly repressed CYP7A1 transcription, resulted in increased Prox1 and LSD1/NuRD complex occupancy on CYP7A1 promoter with a concurrent increase in H3K4 demethylation and H3/H4 deacetylation. These results showed that Prox1 interacts with LSD1 to recruit the repressive LSD1/NuRD complex to CYP7A1 promoter and co-represses transcription through epigenetic mechanisms. In addition, such Prox1-mediated epigenetic repression is involved in the physiologically essential negative feedback inhibition of CYP7A1 transcription by bile acids.
The liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1; NR5A2) belongs to nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, and is expressed mainly in the liver, intestine, exocrine pancreas, and ovary. It binds DNA as a monomer, and is best known as a regulator of hepatic expression of the key bile acid biosynthetic enzyme cholesterol 7alpha hydroxylase (Cyp7A1). It is also expressed in embryonic stem cells and the initial stages of embryonic development, and the very early lethality of LRH-1 knockout mice highlights its essential developmental role. Recent crystal structures of LRH-1 and its closest relative steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1; NR5A1) identified phospholipids as potential ligands. This intriguing discovery raises the possibility of an unexpected new class of nuclear receptor signaling molecules, but the broader functional roles of LRH-1 and these new ligands remain to be established.
Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is a key protein involved in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway. The regulation of CETP by dietary fats is not clearly understood. Transgenic mice expressing human CETP under the control of its natural flanking region were fed low- or high-fat diets enriched in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) or saturated fatty acids in the presence or absence of cholesterol. Addition of cholesterol to the low-fat MUFA diet increased CETP activity and mRNA expression, whereas addition of cholesterol to the high-fat MUFA diet led to a decrease in CETP activity and mRNA expression. In SW 872 cells, oleic acid and cholesterol stimulated CETP gene expression when given alone. However, addition of fatty acids along with cholesterol interfered with the stimulatory effect of cholesterol on CETP gene regulation. Cholesterol-mediated stimulation of CETP involves the transcription factor liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha). High-fat MUFA diets inhibited the expression of LXRalpha, and addition of cholesterol to the high-fat MUFA diet did not rescue LXRalpha expression. Therefore, we present evidence for the first time that inhibition of LXRalpha expression by a high-fat MUFA diet leads to inhibition of CETP stimulation by cholesterol.
We previously reported that lead nitrate (LN), an inducer of hepatic tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), downregulated gene expression of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase. Herein, to clarify the role of TNF-alpha in LN-induced downregulation of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase, effects of LN on gene expression of hepatic cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1) in TNF-alpha-knockout (KO) and TNF-alpha-wild-type (WT) mice were comparatively examined. Gene expression of hepatic Cyp7a1 in both WT and KO mice decreased to less than 5% of the corresponding controls at 6-12 h after treatment with LN (100 mumol/kg body weight, iv). Levels of hepatic TNF-alpha protein in either WT or KO mice were below the detection limit, although expression levels of the TNF-alpha gene markedly increased at 6 h in WT mice by LN treatment, but not in KO mice. In contrast, in both WT and KO mice, levels of hepatic IL-1beta protein, which is known to be a suppressor of the cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase gene in hamsters, were significantly increased 3-6 h after LN treatment. Furthermore, LN-induced downregulation of the Cyp7a1 gene did not necessarily result from altered gene expression of hepatic transcription factors, including positive regulators (liver X receptor alpha, retinoid X receptor alpha, fetoprotein transcription factor, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha) and a negative regulator small heterodimer partner responsible for expression of the Cyp7a1 gene. The present findings indicated that LN-induced downregulation of the Cyp7a1 gene in mice did not necessarily occur through a TNF-alpha-dependent pathway and might occur mainly through an IL-1beta-dependent pathway.
Hepatic steatosis is commonly present during the development of insulin resistance, and it is a clear sign of lipotoxicity attributable in part to an accelerated lipogenesis. There is evidence that a soy protein diet prevents the overexpression of hepatic sterol-regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), decreasing lipid accumulation. Therefore, the aim of the present work was to study whether a soy protein diet may prevent the development of fatty liver through the regulation of transcription factors involved in lipid metabolism in hyperinsulinemic and hyperleptinemic Zucker obese fa/fa rats. Serum and hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride levels, as well as VLDL-triglyceride and LDL-cholesterol, were significantly lower in rats fed soy protein than in rats fed a casein diet for 160 days. The reduction in hepatic cholesterol was associated with a low expression of liver X receptor-alpha and its target genes, 7-alpha hydroxylase and ABCA1. Soy protein also decreased the expression of SREBP-1 and several of its target genes, FAS, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1, and delta5 and delta6 desaturases, decreasing lipogenesis even in the presence of hyperinsulinemia. Reduction in SREBP-1 was not associated with the presence of soy isoflavones. Finally, soy protein reduced SREBP-1 expression in adipocytes, preventing hypertrophy, which also helps prevent the development of hepatic lipotoxicity.
The nuclear receptors liver X receptor (LXR) alpha and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) are positive and negative regulators of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) transcription, respectively. To clarify their roles in the regulation of CYP7A1 in mice, we investigated mRNA expression of their target genes in the livers of C57BL/6 mice fed the following five diets for 2 weeks: a standard diet, cholic acid, cholesterol, cholesterol+high fat, or an atherogenic diet (cholic acid+cholesterol+high fat). The mRNA level of ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC) A1 gene, one of LXRalpha target genes, significantly increased on the diets containing cholic acid and/or cholesterol+high fat, but not on the diet containing cholesterol alone. On the other hand, the mRNA levels of the FXR target genes ABCB11, ABCC2, and short heterodimer partner increased only on the diet containing cholic acid with or without cholesterol+high fat. Surprisingly, cholesterol alone or cholesterol+high fat did not affect CYP7A1 mRNA level, whereas cholic acid with or without cholesterol+high fat greatly reduced the level. Thus, in the atherogenic diet-fed mice, cholic acid component is needed for the FXR activation, and FXR dominantly regulates CYP7A1 transcription.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) has been shown to play an important role in energy metabolism by coordinating transcriptional programs involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, adaptive thermogenesis, gluconeogenesis, and fatty acid oxidation. PGC-1alpha also plays a crucial role in cholesterol metabolism by serving as a coactivator of the liver X receptor-alpha and inducing the expression of cholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase. Here, we demonstrate that PGC-1alpha also functions as an effective coactivator of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), the bile acid receptor. Transient cotransfection assays demonstrate that PGC-1alpha enhances ligand-mediated FXR transcription when either full-length FXR or Gal4 DNA binding domain-FXR-ligand binding domain chimeras were analyzed. Mammalian two-hybrid analyses, glutathione S-transferase affinity chromatography and biochemical coactivator recruitment assays demonstrate ligand-dependent interaction between the two proteins both in vivo and in vitro. PGC-1alpha-mediated coactivation of FXR was highly ligand-dependent and absolutely required an intact activation function-2 (AF-2) domain of FXR and the LXXLL motif in PGC-1alpha. The integrity of the charge clamp was required, further illustrating the role of the ligand binding domain of FXR in PGC-1alpha recognition. Together, these results indicate that PGC-1alpha functions as a potent coactivator for FXR and further implicates its role in the regulation of genes that are involved in bile acid and lipid metabolism.
The expression of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7alpha), the rate-limiting enzyme in the catabolism of cholesterol to bile acid, is stimulated by oxysterol receptor, liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha) and negatively regulated by a bile acid receptor, farnesoid X receptor. In the current study, we demonstrated that 1,25-(OH)(2)D3 blunted the LXRalpha-mediated induction of CYP7alpha mRNA in H4IIE rat hepatoma cells. In co-transfection experiments in HepG2 cells, VDR repressed the activity of rat CYP7alpha promoter in a ligand-dependent manner through inhibition of LXRalpha signaling. We also confirmed the ability of VDR to repress LXRalpha transcriptional activation using a synthetic LXRalpha responsive reporter. Deletion analyses revealed that the ligand-binding domain of VDR was required for the suppression and the DNA-binding domain was dispensable. Given the fact that VDR can be activated by the secondary bile acid as well as 1,25-(OH)(2)D3, the crosstalk between LXRalpha and VDR signaling in regulation of bile acid metabolism provides a possible contribution of VDR to modulate bile acid and cholesterol homeostasis, and highlights a physiological function of VDR beyond calcium metabolism in the body.
Constitutive expression of a cholesterol-7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) transgene in LDL receptor-deficient mice blocked the ability of a cholesterol-enriched diet to increase plasma levels of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins. LDL receptor-deficient mice expressing the CYP7A1 transgene exhibited complete resistance to diet-induced hypercholesterolemia and to the accumulation of cholesterol in the liver. Hepatic mRNA expression of liver X receptor-inducible ABCG5 and ABCG8 was decreased in CYP7A1 transgenic, LDL receptor-deficient mice fed a cholesterol-enriched diet. Thus, increased biliary cholesterol excretion could not account for the maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis. CYP7A1 transgenic, LDL receptor-deficient mice fed the cholesterol-enriched diet exhibited decreased jejunal Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 protein (NPC1L1) mRNA expression, an important mediator of intestinal cholesterol absorption. A taurocholate-enriched diet also decreased NPC1L1 mRNA expression in a farnesoid X receptor-independent manner. Reduced expression of NPC1L1 mRNA was associated with decreased cholesterol absorption ( approximately 20%; P &lt; 0.05) exhibited by CYP7A1 transgenic LDL receptor-deficient mice fed the cholesterol-enriched diet. The combined data show that enhanced expression of CYP7A1 is an effective means to prevent the accumulation of cholesterol in the liver and of atherogenic apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins in plasma.
The orphan nuclear receptors FXR and LXRalpha have become challenging targets for the discovery of new therapeutic agents. Bile acids and hydroxysterol intermediates are the respective natural ligands of these two structurally and functionally closely related receptors. Both FXR and LXRalpha; are thought to play a major role in the control of cholesterol catabolism by regulating the expression of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase, the rate limiting enzyme of bile acid synthesis. Reverse cholesterol transport might also be affected by FXR and LXR since they control the expression of PLTP and CETP, two proteins involved in the transfer of phospholipid, cholesterol and cholesteryl esters among plasma lipoproteins. A new class of potent synthetic activators of FXR, the 1,1-bisphosphonate esters, has been discovered which up regulate the Intestinal Bile Acid Binding Protein gene (I-BABP) as demonstrated for chenodeoxycholic acid, however there are no known synthetic activators yet identified for LXRalpha. The evaluation of FXR as a potential target for the development of drugs affecting plasma cholesterol can take advantage of the fact that the activators of FXR (farnesol, bile acids and the 1,1-bisphosphonate esters) have been studied in various in vitro and in vivo models. Administration of chenodeoxycholic acid to animals and man did not result in the increase in plasma cholesterol expected from a decrease in cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase expression. Like farnesol, the 1,1-bisphosphonate esters increase the rate of degradation of HMGCoA reductase and have the unexpected property of inducing hypocholesterolemia in normal animals. The natural and synthetic FXR agonists trigger differentiation, inhibit cell proliferation and are potent inducers of apoptosis. The 1,1-bisphosphonate ester SR-45023A (Apomine) is presently being developed as an antineoplastic drug.
Thyroid hormone (T3) influences hepatic cholesterol metabolism, and previous studies have established an important role of this hormone in the regulation of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A), the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of bile acids. To evaluate the respective contribution of thyroid hormone receptors (TR) alpha1 and beta in this regulation, the responses to 2% dietary cholesterol and T3 were studied in TRalpha1 and TRbeta knockout mice under hypo- and hyperthyroid conditions. Our experiments show that the normal stimulation in CYP7A activity and mRNA level by T3 is lost in TRbeta-/- but not in TRalpha1-/-mice, identifying TRbeta as the mediator of T3 action on CYP7A and, consequently, as a major regulator of cholesterol metabolism in vivo. Somewhat unexpectedly, T3-deficient TRbeta-/- mice showed an augmented CYP7A response after challenge with dietary cholesterol, and these animals did not develop hypercholesterolemia to the extent as did wild-type (wt) controls. The latter results lend strong support to the concept that TRs may exert regulatory effects in vivo independent of T3.
Heparan sulfate-regulated transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor FGFR4 is the major FGFR isotype in mature hepatocytes. Fibroblast growth factor has been implicated in the definition of liver from foregut endoderm where FGFR4 is expressed and stimulation of hepatocyte DNA synthesis in vitro. Here we show that livers of mice lacking FGFR4 exhibited normal morphology and regenerated normally in response to partial hepatectomy. However, the FGFR4 (-/-) mice exhibited depleted gallbladders, an elevated bile acid pool and elevated excretion of bile acids. Cholesterol- and bile acid-controlled liver cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase, the limiting enzyme for bile acid synthesis, was elevated, unresponsive to dietary cholesterol, but repressed normally by dietary cholate. Expression pattern and cholate-dependent, cholesterol-induced hepatomegaly in the FGFR4 (-/-) mice suggested that activation of receptor interacting protein 140, a co-repressor of feed-forward activator liver X receptor alpha, may mediate the negative regulation of cholesterol- and bile acid-controlled liver cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase transcription by FGFR4 and cholate. The results demonstrate that transmembrane sensors interface with metabolite-controlled transcription networks and suggest that pericellular matrix-controlled liver FGFR4 in particular may ensure adequate cholesterol for cell structures and signal transduction.
Cholesterol biosynthesis is regulated by transcription factors named steroid regulatory element-binding proteins. A newly discovered transcription factor, LXR, regulates the catabolic degradation of cholesterol by activation of the gene controlling cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the formation of bile acids. Excessive dietary cholesterol leads to increased oxysterol formation. Oxysterol binds to LXR and thereby induces transcription of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, thus increasing the removal of cholesterol as bile acids.
Cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), a liver-specific enzyme, catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the degradation pathway of cholesterol to bile acids, and thus plays a key role in cholesterol homeostasis. To elucidate the mechanisms that control hepatic expression of the human CYP7A1 gene, we are studying the promoter region. Initially, we observed that up to 40% of the overall transcriptional activity of the promoter in HepG2 cells was associated with DNA sequences from -65 to -1 of the human gene. Within this region, a binding site for the liver-enriched transcription factor HNF-1 (-56 to -49) has been identified. Binding of HNF-1 to this site leads to transcriptional activation of the human promoter. The corresponding segment from the rat CYP7A1 gene does not bind HNF-1; instead, it is bound by the orphan receptors ARP-1 (COUP-TFII) and LXRalpha, that are implicated in dietary regulation.
LXRalpha and -beta are nuclear receptors that regulate the metabolism of several important lipids, including cholesterol and bile acids. Previously, we have proposed that LXRs regulate these pathways through their interaction with specific, naturally occurring oxysterols, including 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, and 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol. Using a ligand binding assay that incorporates scintillation proximity technology to circumvent many of the problems associated with assaying extremely hydrophobic ligands, we now demonstrate that these oxysterols bind directly to LXRs at concentrations that occur in vivo. To characterize further the structural determinants required for potent LXR ligands, we synthesized and tested a series of related compounds for binding to LXRs and activation of transcription. These studies revealed that position-specific monooxidation of the sterol side chain is requisite for LXR high-affinity binding and activation. Enhanced binding and activation can also be achieved through the use of 24-oxo ligands that act as hydrogen bond acceptors in the side chain. In addition, introduction of an oxygen on the sterol B-ring results in a ligand with LXRalpha-subtype selectivity. These results support the hypothesis that naturally occurring oxysterols are physiological ligands for LXRs and show that a rational, structure-based approach can be used to design potent LXR ligands for pharmacologic use.
Accumulation of cholesterol causes both repression of genes controlling cholesterol biosynthesis and cellular uptake and induction of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase, which leads to the removal of cholesterol by increased metabolism to bile acids. Here, we report that LXRalpha and LXRbeta, two orphan members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, are activated by 24(S), 25-epoxycholesterol and 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol at physiologic concentrations. In addition, we have identified an LXR response element in the promoter region of the rat cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase gene. Our data provide evidence for a new hormonal signaling pathway that activates transcription in response to oxysterols and suggest that LXRs play a critical role in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis.
We investigated how cholesterol feeding regulates cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) via the nuclear receptors farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha) in New Zealand white rabbits. After 1 day of 2% cholesterol feeding, when the bile acid pool size had not expanded, mRNA levels of the FXR target genes short-heterodimer partner (SHP) and sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase (CYP8B) were unchanged, indicating that FXR activation remained constant. In contrast, the mRNA levels of the LXRalpha target genes ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) increased 5-fold and 2.3-fold, respectively, associated with significant increases in hepatic concentrations of oxysterols. Activity and mRNA levels of CYP7A1 increased 2.4 times and 2.2 times, respectively. After 10 days of cholesterol feeding, the bile acid pool size increased nearly 2-fold. SHP mRNA levels increased 4.1-fold while CYP8B declined 64%. ABCA1 mRNA rose 8-fold and CETP mRNA remained elevated. Activity and mRNA of CYP7A1 decreased 60% and 90%, respectively. Feeding cholesterol for 1 day did not enlarge the ligand pool size or change FXR activation, while LXRalpha was activated highly secondary to increased hepatic oxysterols. As a result, CYP7A1 was up-regulated. After 10 days of cholesterol feeding, the bile acid (FXR ligand) pool size increased, which activated FXR and inhibited CYP7A1 despite continued activation of LXRalpha. Thus, in rabbits, when FXR and LXRalpha are activated simultaneously, the inhibitory effect of FXR overrides the stimulatory effect of LXRalpha to suppress CYP7A1 mRNA expression.
In rodent liver, transcription of the gene encoding cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the classic bile acid synthetic pathway, is stimulated by the liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha), a nuclear receptor for oxysterol metabolites of cholesterol. This feed-forward regulatory loop provides a mechanism for the elimination of excess cholesterol from the body. In this report, we demonstrate that in primary cultures of human hepatocytes, activation of LXRalpha has the opposite effect, repressing CYP7A1 expression. This repression is mediated, at least in part, through induction of the orphan nuclear receptor, short heterodimer partner (SHP), which is also induced by bile acids. We demonstrate that SHP is regulated directly by LXRalpha through a DNA response element that overlaps with the previously characterized bile acid response element. Our data reveal a fundamental difference in the regulation of CYP7A1 in rodent and human hepatocytes and provide evidence that different species employ distinct molecular strategies to regulate cholesterol homeostasis.
Cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (cyp7a) mediates cholesterol elimination in the liver by catalyzing the first and rate-limiting step in the conversion of cholesterol into bile acids. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha; NR1C1) and liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha; NR1H3) are two nuclear receptors that stimulate the murine Cyp7a1 gene. Here we report that co-expression of PPARalpha and LXRalpha in hepatoma cells abolishes the stimulation of Cyp7a1 gene promoter in response to their respective agonists. PPARalpha and LXRalpha form an atypical heterodimer that binds to two directly adjacent hexameric sequences localized within overlapping PPARalpha and LXRalpha response elements (termed Site I), antagonizing the interaction of PPARalpha:retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRalpha) or RXRalpha:LXRalpha with the Cyp7a1 gene promoter. Mutations within either hexameric sequences that specifically abolished LXRalpha:PPARalpha heterodimer binding to the murine Cyp7a1 Site I also relieved promoter inhibition. The LXRalpha:PPARalpha heterodimer may be important in coordinating the expression of genes that encode proteins involved in metabolism of fats and cholesterol.
The liver X receptors, LXRalpha and LXRbeta, are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Originally identified as orphans, both receptor subtypes have since been shown to be activated by naturally occurring oxysterols. LXRalpha knockout mice fail to regulate cyp7a mRNA levels upon cholesterol feeding, implicating the role of this receptor in cholesterol homeostasis. LXR activation also induces the expression of the lipid pump involved in cholesterol efflux, the gene encoding ATP binding cassette protein A1 (ABCA1). Therefore, LXR is believed to be a sensor of cholesterol levels and a potential therapeutic target for atherosclerosis. Here we describe a synthetic molecule named F(3)MethylAA [3-chloro-4-(3-(7-propyl-3-trifluoromethyl-6-(4,5)-isoxazolyl)propylthio)-phenyl acetic acid] that is more potent than 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol in LXR in vitro assays. F(3)MethylAA is capable not only of inducing ABCA1 mRNA levels, but also increasing cholesterol efflux from THP-1 macrophages. In rat hepatocytes, F(3)MethylAA induced cyp7a mRNA, confirming conclusions from the knockout mouse studies. Furthermore, in rat in vivo studies, F(3)MethylAA induced liver cyp7a mRNA and enzyme activity. A critical species difference is also reported in that neither F(3)MethylAA nor 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol induced cyp7a in human primary hepatocytes. However, other LXR target genes, ABCA1, ABCG1, and SREBP1, were regulated.
The in vivo role of the nuclear receptor SHP in feedback regulation of bile acid synthesis was examined. Loss of SHP in mice caused abnormal accumulation and increased synthesis of bile acids due to derepression of rate-limiting CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 hydroxylase enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway. Dietary bile acids induced liver damage and restored feedback regulation. A synthetic agonist of the nuclear receptor FXR was not hepatotoxic and had no regulatory effects. Reduction of the bile acid pool with cholestyramine enhanced CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 expression. We conclude that input from three negative regulatory pathways controls bile acid synthesis. One is mediated by SHP, and two are SHP independent and invoked by liver damage and changes in bile acid pool size.
Cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the classic pathway of bile acid biosynthesis. Dietary cholesterol stimulates CYP7A1 transcription via activation of oxysterol receptor, LXR alpha, whereas bile acids repress transcription through FXR-mediated induction of SHP protein. The aim of this study was to determine the quantitative role that LXR- and FXR-regulated pathways play in regulating CYP7A1 and SHP in both rat and hamster models. In rats fed a 2% cholesterol diet, both SHP and CYP7A1 mRNA levels were elevated. The inability to induce CYP7A1 mRNA levels by cholesterol feeding in hamsters led to a decline in SHP mRNA levels. Elimination of hepatic bile acid flux by cholestyramine or bile fistula resulted in a marked repression of rat SHP mRNA levels. These results suggest that under conditions of both SHP and LXR alpha activation, stimulatory effect of LXR alpha overrides the inhibitory effect of FXR and results in an induction of rat CYP7A1 mRNA levels.
The C57BL/6ByJ (B6By) mouse strain is resistant to diet-induced hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis, despite its near genetic identity with the atherosclerosis-susceptible C57BL/6J (B6J) strain. We previously identified a genetic locus, Diet1, which is responsible for the resistant phenotype in B6By mice. To investigate the function of Diet1, we compared mRNA expression profiles in the liver of B6By and B6J mice fed an atherogenic diet using a DNA microarray. These studies revealed elevated expression levels in B6By liver for key bile acid synthesis proteins, including cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase and sterol-27-hydroxylase, and the oxysterol nuclear receptor liver X receptor alpha. Expression levels for several other genes involved in bile acid metabolism were subsequently found to differ between B6By and B6J mice, including the bile acid receptor farnesoid X receptor, oxysterol 7alpha-hydroxylase, sterol-12alpha-hydroxylase, and hepatic bile acid transporters on both sinusoidal and canalicular membranes. The overall expression profile of the B6By strain suggests a higher rate of bile acid synthesis and transport in these mice. Consistent with this interpretation, fecal bile acid excretion is increased 2-fold in B6By mice, and bile acid levels in blood and urine are elevated 3- and 18-fold, respectively. Genetic analysis of serum bile acid levels revealed co-segregation with Diet1, indicating that this locus is likely responsible for both increased bile acid excretion and resistance to hypercholesterolemia in B6By mice.
Excessive inorganic phosphate (Pi) intake and hyperphosphatemia have both been speculated to be risk factors for cardiovascular disease and hypercholesterolemia, and dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism can lead to atherosclerosis. However, the relationship between Pi and cholesterol metabolism has not been investigated in detail. Our recent study showed that triiodothyronine can induce both hyperphosphatemia and hypocholesterolemia in mice. We therefore hypothesized a possible linkage between Pi and cholesterol metabolism. In this study, we investigated the effects of dietary Pi intake on cholesterol metabolism in mice. Mice were divided into 4 groups, which were fed diets containing 1.2% or 0.1% Pi and with or without 2% cholesterol (Pi-sufficient, Pi-restricted, Pi-sufficient + Chol, and Pi-restricted + Chol), for 12 days. Inorganic phosphate-restricted mice exhibited significantly higher liver weights than did Pi-sufficient mice. Interestingly, dietary Pi restriction significantly increased high-cholesterol diet-induced hepatic lipid accumulation. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that dietary Pi restriction decreased expression of hepatic genes involved in cholesterol metabolism and fatty acid biosynthesis. In addition, hepatic messenger RNA levels of several transcription factors including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and liver X receptor were markedly decreased by Pi restriction. Furthermore, plasma lipid and lipoprotein profile analysis showed that dietary Pi restriction reduced susceptibility to high-cholesterol diet-induced hyperlipidemia. Importantly, we found that there was a significant negative correlation between plasma levels of Pi and total cholesterol. These results suggest that dietary Pi plays an important role in the development of fatty liver disease and hyperlipidemia induced by a high-cholesterol diet through regulation of lipid metabolism-related gene expression in the liver. 
The major aim of this study is to elucidate the hypocholesterolemic mechanism exerted by rice protein (RP) in adult rats under cholesterol-enriched dietary condition. Compared with casein, the cholesterol levels in plasma and the liver were significantly reduced by RP, accompanying significant inhibition of cholesterol absorption. RP increased the activity and mRNA level of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, whereas acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activity and gene expression were significantly depressed with consumption of RP. Neither the activity nor gene expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase of RP differed from that of casein. The gene expression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and liver X receptor α were significantly activated by consumption of RP. RP did not modify the mRNA level of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 with respect to casein. These results suggest RP can induce a cholesterol-lowering effect through modifying cholesterol metabolism-related gene expression and enzyme activity in adult rats.
Replacing dietary fishmeal (FM) and fish oil (FO) with plant ingredients in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) diets decreases dietary cholesterol and introduces phytosterols. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of dietary sterol composition on cholesterol metabolism in Atlantic salmon. For this purpose, two dietary trials were performed, in which Atlantic salmon were fed either 100 % FM and FO (FM-FO) diet or one of the three diets with either high (80 %) or medium (40 %) plant protein (PP) and a high (70 %) or medium (35 %) vegetable oil (VO) blend (trial 1); or 70 % PP with either 100 % FO or 80 % of the FO replaced with olive, rapeseed or soyabean oil (trial 2). Replacing ≥ 70 % of FM with PP and ≥ 70 % of FO with either a VO blend or rapeseed oil increased plasma and liver TAG concentrations. These diets contained high levels of phytosterols and low levels of cholesterol. Fish fed low-cholesterol diets, but with less phytosterols, exhibited an increased expression of genes encoding proteins involved in cholesterol uptake and synthesis. The expression of these genes was, however, partially inhibited in rapeseed oil-fed fish possibly due to the high dietary and tissue phytosterol:cholesterol ratio. Atlantic salmon tissue and plasma cholesterol concentrations were maintained stable independent of the dietary sterol content. 
The present study was to evaluate the cholesterol-lowering effect of two novel plant stanol derivatives and its potential molecular mechanism in hyper-cholesterol mice induced by a high-cholesterol diet. Results showed that oral administration of plant stanyl hemisuccinate (2×, 5×) and plant stanyl sorbitol succinate (2×, 5×) effectively attenuated the serum total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, while had no effect on the serum triacylglycerol and high density lipoprotein cholesterol. And plant stanol derivatives decreased liver cholesterol concentration and increased faecal cholesterol output. Meanwhile, both plant stanyl hemisuccinate and plant stanyl sorbitol succinate could remarkably promote liver X receptor alpha (LXRα) expression, and increased cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) expression and faecal total bile acid output to varying degrees. These results suggested two novel plant stanol derivatives possessed hypocholesterolemic effect, and the cholesterol-lowering action of plant stanol derivatives may be through activating the potential LXRα-CYP7A1-bile acid excretion pathway.
Paeoniflorin is one of the active ingredients of Paeonia lactiflora Pall., a novel traditional herbal medicine exerting pharmacological effects including antihyperlipidemic, neuroprotective, and anti-hepatofibrosis effects. Liver X receptor (LXR) acts as a ligand-activated transcription factor to exhibit antihyperlipidemic and neuroprotective effects. In this study, the activity of paeoniflorin against LXR was evaluated by the mammalian one-hybrid and transient transfection reporter assays. The results showed that paeoniflorin transactivated GAL4, rat cholesterol 7 α-hydroxylase, phospholipid transfer protein, and ATP-binding cassette A1 gene promoters in dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the docking study demonstrated that paeoniflorin resided in the LXR ligand-binding pocket in the similar manner as GSK 3987, a novel LXR agonist. These results indicated that paeoniflorin might exert pharmacological effects through LXR pathway.
Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have emerged as a major public health issue because of their potentially disruptive effects on physiological hormonal actions. SXR (steroid xenobiotic receptor), also known as NR1I2, regulates CYP3A expression in response to exogenous chemicals, such as EDCs, after binding to SXRE (SXR response element). In our study, luciferase assay showed that 14 out of 55 EDCs could enhance SXR-mediated rat or human CYP3A gene transcription nearly evenly, and could also activate rat CYP7A1 gene transcription by cross-interaction of SXR and LXRE (LXRα response element). SXR diffused in the nucleus without ligand, whereas intranuclear foci of liganded SXR were produced. Furthermore, endogenous mRNA expression of CYP3A4 gene was enhanced by the 14 positive EDCs. Our results suggested a probable mechanism of EDCs disrupting the steroid or xenobiotic metabolism homeostasis via SXR.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, one of the most prevalent liver disorders in Western countries, is characterized by hepatic accumulation of triglycerides. Bile acids have long been known to affect triglyceride homeostasis through a not completely understood mechanism.
To analyse the effects of two different manipulations of bile acid circulation on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
Two animal models of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease were developed by either feeding rats with a choline deficient or with a high fat diet. After 4 weeks, rats were randomized to undergo either bile duct ligation, sham operation or cholic acid administration.
During cholestasis there was an increased CYP7A1 expression, the rate limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis, and a reduction of hepatic concentration of oxysterols, ligands of the liver X receptors. Target genes of the liver X receptors, involved in fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis, were down-regulated in association with decreased hepatic triglyceride content and improvement of fatty liver. Administration of cholic acid, ligand of farnesoid X receptor, also had a beneficial effect on fatty liver in rats on choline deficient diet.
These results indicate that pharmacological approaches increasing the expression of CYP7A1 or stimulating farnesoid X receptor pathway could represent a promising treatment for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
Resveratrol (RSV), a naturally occurring polyphenolic stilbenoid, is known to possess potent anti-atherogenic properties; however, the effect of RSV on hypercholesterolemia is not fully understood. We hypothesized that RSV decreases blood cholesterol levels through the activation of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1)-mediated bile acid synthetic pathway pathways in vitro and in vivo.
In this study, we evaluated body weight, serum lipid concentrations, hepatic lipid content and the size of the bile acid pool in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed C57BL/6 J mice that were treated with RSV. In addition, we characterized the underlying mechanism of the effects of RSV in HepG2 hepatocytes by Western blot analysis.
RSV (200 mg/kg per day) reduced body weight and liver weight gains, improved serum lipid parameters, reduced hepatic cholesterol accumulation and increased the bile acid pool size in mice fed an HFD for 8 wks. RSV significantly increased liver expression of CYP7A1 mRNA and protein and CYP7A1 enzyme activity. Furthermore, RSV treatment upregulated CYP7A1 expression and induced liver X receptor alpha (LXRα) activation in a time- and dose-dependent manner in HepG2 cells. In addition, the specific liver X receptor alpha (LXRα) inhibitor geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) inhibited the RSV-induced expression of CYP7A1 in HepG2 hepatocytes.
The beneficial effects of RSV on HFD-induced hypercholesterolemia are mediated through LXRα signaling pathways, suggesting a potential target for the prevention of dyslipidemia.
Although previous studies have shown that consumption of anthocyanin extract from plant foods reduces hypercholesterolemia and the severity of atherosclerosis in different animal models, the mechanisms of these actions remained unclear. This study investigated whether pure anthocyanin inhibit atherosclerosis development and reduce hypercholesterolemia in the apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-deficient mice through enhancement of fecal bile acid excretion, a critical pathway for eliminating circulation cholesterol from the body.
Five-week-old male ApoE-deficient mice were fed the AIN-93G diet supplemented with or without cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside (0.06% w/w) for 12 weeks. Results showed that cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside consumption inhibited the formation of aortic sinus plaque and reduced hypercholesterolemia, along with promoted fecal bile acid excretion and upregulated hepatic cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase expression (CYP7A1). In mouse primary hepatocytes, cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside treatment increased bile acid synthesis and CYP7A1 expression in a liver X receptor alpha (LXRα)-)-dependent manner. Scintillation proximity and time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays revealed that cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside functions as an agonist of LXRα.
Our results indicate that the hypocholesterolemic activity of cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside was, at least in part, mediated by activating the potential LXRα-CYP7A1-bile acid excretion pathway, thus contributing to the antiatherogenic effect of cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside. Importantly, cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside could activate LXRα in an agonist-dependent manner.
Capsaicinoids are the active compounds in chili pepper. The present study investigated the effect of capsaicinoids on plasma lipids, functionality of aorta including atherosclerotic plaque development, cholesterol absorption biomarker, fecal sterol excretion, and gene expression of major receptors, enzymes, and transporters involved in cholesterol metabolism.
Hamsters were divided into five groups and fed a high-cholesterol diet containing 0 % (CON), 0.010 % (LD), 0.015 % (MD), 0.020 % (HD), and 0.030 % (VD) capsaicinoids, respectively, for 6 weeks. Plasma lipids were measured using the enzymatic kits, and the gene expression of transporters, enzymes, and receptors involved in cholesterol absorption and metabolism was quantified using the quantitative PCR. Endothelial function was assessed by measuring the acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxations in aorta.
Capsaicinoids reduced plasma total cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triacylglycerols with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol being unaffected. All four experimental groups had a decrease in the atherosclerotic plaque compared with CON. Dietary capsaicinoids increased the fecal excretion of total acidic sterols possibly mediated by up-regulation of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase and down-regulation of liver X receptor alpha. Plasma sterol analysis demonstrated that capsaicinoids decreased the ratio of plasma campesterol/cholesterol, suggesting they decreased cholesterol absorption. Capsaicinoids could improve the endothelium-dependent relaxations and reduce the endothelium-dependent contractions by inhibiting the gene expression of COX-2. However, no dose-dependent effect of capsaicinoids on these parameters was seen.
Capsaicinoids were beneficial in improving lipoprotein profile and aortic function in hamsters fed a high-cholesterol diet.
Both inflammation and cholesterol accumulation play important roles in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. This study was undertaken to investigate whether inflammation aggravated cholesterol accumulation via disrupting hepatic cholesterol export and we explored the underlying mechanisms.
We used casein injection in C57BL/6J mice, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) stimulation in human hepatoblastoma cell line (HepG2) cells to induce inflammation. Intracellular cholesterol level was examined by Oil Red O staining and quantitative analysis. Bile acid level was quantified by colorimetric analysis. (3)[H] cholesterol assay by scintillation counting was performed to evaluate the cholesterol efflux. The mRNA and protein expression was examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot.
Inflammation increased cholesterol accumulation in livers of C57BL/6J mice and in HepG2 cells. High-fat diet in mice and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) loading in HepG2 cells increased bile acid synthesis and cholesterol efflux, enhanced the mRNA and protein expression of liver X receptor α (LXRα), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARα, γ), cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). However, inflammation reduced bile acid synthesis and cholesterol efflux even in high-fat-diet-fed mice and HepG2 cells in the presence of LDL loading. The enhanced effects of these genes and proteins expression due to high-fat diet and LDL loading were inhibited by inflammation both in vivo and in vitro.
Inflammation disrupted PPAR-LXR-CYP7A1/ABCA1-mediated bile acid synthesis and cholesterol efflux resulting in exacerbated cholesterol accumulation in livers of C57BL/6J mice and HepG2 cells.
In the previous experiment, we found that there was a different response between E3 rats and DA.1U rats to high-fat-diet-induced metabolic syndrome (HFD-MetS). The aim of this study was to explore the cause and molecular mechanism of the genetic difference in susceptibility to metabolic syndrome in E3 rats as compared with DA.1U rats. Firstly, a 12-week HFD-MetS model in E3 and DA.1U rats was carried out and assessed. Then, the expression of key insulin signaling molecules, metabolic nuclear receptors, metabolic key enzymes and histone deacetylases (Hdacs) was determined by different methods. Finally, the effects of overexpression and disruption of Hdac3 on metabolic nuclear receptors were analyzed in CBRH-7919 cells and primarily-hepatic cells from DA.1U and E3 rats. We found that E3 rats were susceptible, while DA.1U rats were resisted to HFD-MetS. The expression of liver X receptor α,β (LXR-α,β), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) and cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) increased markedly in DA.1U rat liver, whereas they decreased significantly in E3 rats. The expression of Hdac3 increased by HFD treatment in both E3 and DA.1U rat livers, but the constitutive Hdac3 expression was lower in DA.IU rat liver than in E3 rat liver. Importantly, overexpression of Hdac3 could downregulate the expression of LXR-α, PPAR-γ and CYP7A1 in both CBRH-7919 cells and primarily cultured hepatic cells from DA.IU rats. On the contrary, disruption of Hdac3 by shRNA upregulated the expression of LXR-α, PPAR-γ and CYP7A1 in both CBRH-7919 cells and primarily cultured hepatic cells from E3 rats. The results suggested that a high constitutive expression of Hdac3 inhibiting the expression of PPAR-γ, LXR-α and CYP7A1 in liver contributes to HFD-MetS in E3 rats.
Adverse events in utero, such as intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), can permanently alter epigenetic mechanisms leading to the metabolic syndrome, which encompasses a variety of symptoms including augmented cholesterol. The major site for cholesterol homeostasis occurs via the actions of hepatic cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1), which catabolizes cholesterol to bile acids. To determine whether posttranslational histone modifications influence the long-term expression of Cyp7a1 in IUGR, we used a protein restriction model in rats. This diet during pregnancy and lactation led to IUGR offspring with decreased liver to body weight ratios, followed by increased circulating and hepatic cholesterol levels in both sexes at d 21 and exclusively in the male offspring at d 130. The augmented cholesterol was associated with decreases in the expression of Cyp7a1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that this was concomitant with diminished acetylation and enhanced methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 [K9,14], markers of chromatin silencing, surrounding the promoter region of Cyp7a1. These epigenetic modifications originate in part due to dietary-induced decreases in fetal hepatic Jmjd2a expression, a histone H3 [K9] demethylase. Collectively, these findings suggest that the augmented cholesterol observed in low-protein diet-derived offspring is due to permanent repressive posttranslational histone modifications at the promoter of Cyp7a1. Moreover, this is the first study to demonstrate that maternal undernutrition leads to long-term cholesterol dysregulation in the offspring via epigenetic mechanisms.
It has been shown that calcium supplementation favorably modifies plasma lipoprotein profile in postmenopausal women. The present study investigated the interaction of dietary calcium with genes of transporters, receptors and enzymes involved in cholesterol metabolism.
Forty-eight ovariectomized hamsters were fed one of the four diets containing 0, 2, 6 and 8 g calcium per kg. Plasma total cholesterol (TC), triacylglycerols (TG), and non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol were dose-dependently decreased, whereas high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was dose-dependently increased with the increasing dietary calcium levels. Dietary calcium had no effect on protein mass of hepatic sterol regulatory element binding protein-2 (SREBP), liver X receptor-alpha (LXR), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR), LDL receptor (LDLR) and cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). However, dietary calcium up-regulated the mRNA levels of hepatic CYP7A1 and intestinal ATP binding cassette transporters (ABCG5/8) whereas it down-regulated the intestinal Niemann-Pick C1 like 1 (NPC1L1) and microsomal triacylglycerol transport protein (MTP). In addition, dietary calcium increased the activity of intestinal acyl coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase 2, while it decreased plasma cholesteryl ester transport protein (CETP).
Beneficial modification of lipoprotein profile by dietary calcium was mediated by sequestering bile acid absorption and enhancing excretion of fecal cholesterol, via up-regulation of mRNA CYP7A1 and intestinal ABCG 5/8 with down-regulation of mRNA NPC1L1 and MTP.
Interest in grape seed proanthocyanidin (GSP) as a cholesterol-lowering nutraceutical is growing. This study was to investigate the effect of GSP on blood cholesterol level and gene expression of cholesterol-regulating enzymes in Golden Syrian hamsters maintained on a 0.1% cholesterol diet. Results affirmed supplementation of 0.5% or 1.0% GSP could decrease plasma total cholesterol and triacylglycerol level. Western blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses demonstrated GSP did not affect sterol regulatory element binding protein-2 and low-density lipoprotein receptor; however, it increased mRNA 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. GSP had no effect on the protein mass of liver X receptor alpha (LXRα) but it decreased mRNA LXRα. Most importantly, GSP increased not only the protein level of cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) but also mRNA CYP7A1. It was concluded that the hypocholesterolemic activity of GSP was most likely mediated by enhancement of bile acid excretion and up-regulation of CYP7A1.
Onion has been shown to favorably modify the lipoprotein profile. However, research on its underlying mechanism is lacking. The present study investigated the interaction of dietary onion powder with the protein expression of key receptors and enzymes involved in cholesterol metabolism. Thirty-six male hamsters were randomly divided into three groups and fed a high-cholesterol control diet or the two experimental diets supplemented with 1% onion powder (OP-1) or 5% onion powder (OP-5), for a period of 8 weeks. It was found that onion dose-dependently decreased plasma total cholesterol (TC) level. The change in plasma lipoprotein profile was accompanied by a greater excretion of both fecal neutral and acidic sterols. Western blot analysis revealed that onion up-regulated sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP-2), liver X receptor alpha (LXRα) and cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) with no effect on 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) and LDL receptor (LDL-R). It was concluded that the hypocholesterolemic activity of onion powder was mediated by enhancement of fecal sterol excretion and up-regulation of LXRα and CYP7A1.
To investigate the hypocholesterolemic activity of red yeast rice (RYR) and its underlying mechanism.
Three groups of hamsters were fed either the control diet or one of the two experimental diets containing by weight 0.1% RYR (0.1RYR) or 0.3% RYR (0.3RYR). Blood (0.5 mL) was collected from the retro-orbital sinus into a heparinized capillary tube at the end of week 0, 3, and 6. Plasma lipoproteins were measured using enzymatic kits, while fecal neutral and acidic sterols were quantified using a gas-liquid chromatography.
Plasma total cholesterol was reduced by 12% in 0.1RYR group and by 18% in 0.3RYR group compared with the control value. Similarly, plasma triacylglycerol was decreased by 11% in 0.1RYR group and by 24% in 0.3RYR group. Western blotting analysis demonstrated that RYR had no effect on sterol regulatory element binding protein 2, liver X receptor, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutary-CoA reductase, LDL receptor, and cholesterol-7alpha-hydroxylase. HPLC analysis confirmed that RYR contained 0.88% monacolin K. It was recently found that RYR supplementation increased excretion of fecal acidic sterols by 3-4 folds compared with the control value.
Hypocholesterolemic activity of RYR is mediated at least partially by enhancement of acidic sterol excretion.
To investigate changes in bile acid biosynthesis in chicken (Gallus gallus) during embryonic stages, we studied the contribution of hepatic and plasma total bile acid levels, mRNA expression of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), and the expression of its regulatory genes in two embryo models (i.e., broilers and layers) differing in lipid metabolism. Total bile acid levels in plasma and liver were low during embryonic stages, as well as expression of CYP7A1. At hatch (P0), hepatic and plasma total bile acid levels and CYP7A1 mRNA expression in liver were markedly increased in both models. The hepatic mRNA expression of liver X receptor (LXR)alpha, a regulator of CYP7A1 gene expression gradually decreased with developmental stages of both broilers and layers. The hepatic mRNA expression of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a repressor of CYP7A1 gene expression, also decreased with embryonic development. The present results showed that the mRNA expression of CYP7A1 and synthesis of bile acids was low in embryonic stages, suggesting that FXR might be a key regulator of CYP7A1 gene expression in the chicken embryo.
Betaine serves as an animal and human nutrient which has been heavily investigated in glucose and lipid metabolic regulation, yet the underlying mechanisms are still elusive. In this study, feeding sows with betaine-supplemented diets during pregnancy and lactation increased cholesterol content and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) gene expression, but decreasing bile acids content and cholesterol-7a-hydroxylase (CYP7a1) expression in the liver of weaning piglets. This was associated with the significantly elevated serum betaine and methionine levels and hepatic S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) content. Concurrently, the hepatic nuclear transcription factor liver X receptor LXR was downregulated along with activated signal protein AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Moreover, a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed lower LXR binding on CYP7a1 gene promoter and more enriched activation histone marker H3K4me3 on LDLR and SR-BI promoters. These results suggest that gestational and lactational betaine supplementation modulates hepatic gene expression involved in cholesterol metabolism via an AMPK/LXR pathway and histone modification in the weaning offspring.
Statins, 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, are the first-line medications prescribed for the prevention and treatment of coronary artery diseases. The efficacy of statins has been attributed not only to their systemic cholesterol-lowering actions but also to their pleiotropic effects that are unrelated to cholesterol reduction. These pleiotropic effects have been increasingly recognized as essential in statins therapy. This study was designed to investigate the pleiotropic actions of simvastatin, one of the most commonly prescribed statins, on macrophage cholesterol homeostasis with a focus on lysosomal free cholesterol egression. With simultaneous nile red and filipin staining, analysis of confocal/multi-photon imaging demonstrated that simvastatin markedly attenuated unesterified (free) cholesterol buildup in macrophages loaded with oxidized low-density lipoprotein but had little effect in reducing the sizes of cholesteryl ester-containing lipid droplets; the reduction in free cholesterol was mainly attributed to decreases in lysosome-compartmentalized cholesterol. Functionally, the egression of free cholesterol from lysosomes attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. It was determined that the reduction of lysosomal free cholesterol buildup by simvastatin was due to the up-regulation of Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), a lysosomal residing cholesterol transporter. Moreover, the enhanced enzymatic production of 7-hydroxycholesterol by cytochrome P450 7A1 and the subsequent activation of liver X receptor α underscored the up-regulation of NPC1. These findings reveal a novel pleiotropic effect of simvastatin in affecting lysosomal cholesterol efflux in macrophages and the associated significance in the treatment of atherosclerosis.
Atherosclerosis is both a chronic inflammatory disease and a lipid metabolism disorder. C/EBPβ is well documented for its role in the development of hematopoietic cells and integration of lipid metabolism. However, C/EBPβ's role in atherosclerotic progression has not been examined. We assessed the impact of hematopoietic CEBPβ deletion in ApoE(-/-) mice on hyperlipidemia, inflammatory responses and lesion formation in the aorta.
ApoE(-/-) mice were reconstituted with bone marrow cells derived from either WT or C/EBPβ(-/-) mice and placed on low fat or high fat/high cholesterol diet for 11 weeks. Hematopoietic C/EBPβ deletion in ApoE(-/-) mice reduced blood and hepatic lipids and gene expression of hepatic stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 and fatty acid synthase while expression of ATP binding cassette transporter G1, cholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase, and liver X receptor alpha genes were significantly increased. ApoE(-/-) mice reconstituted with C/EBPβ(-/-) bone marrow cells also significantly reduced blood cytokine levels and reduced lesion area in aortic sinuses compared with ApoE(-/-) mice reconstituted with WT bone marrow cells. Silencing of C/EBPβ in RAW264.7 macrophage cells prevented oxLDL-mediated foam cell formation and inflammatory cytokine secretion in conditioned medium.
C/EBPβ in hematopoietic cells is crucial to regulate diet-induced inflammation, hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis development.
Phospholipid transfer protein is expressed in various cell types and secreted into plasma, where it transfers phospholipids between lipoproteins and modulates the composition of high-density lipoprotein particles. Phospholipid transfer protein deficiency in vivo can lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level significantly and impact the biological quality of high-density lipoprotein. Considering high-density lipoprotein was a critical determinant for reverse cholesterol transport, we investigated the role of systemic phospholipid transfer protein deficiency in macrophage reverse cholesterol transport in vivo After the littermate phospholipid transfer protein KO and WT mice were fed high-fat diet for one month, they were injected intraperitoneally with (3)H-cholesterol-labeled and acLDL-loaded macrophages. Then the appearance of (3)H-tracer in plasma, liver, bile, intestinal wall, and feces over 48 h was determined. Plasma lipid analysis indicated phospholipid transfer protein deficiency lowered total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-C and apolipoprotein A1 levels significantly but increased triglyceride level in mice. The isotope tracing experiment showed (3)H-cholesterol of plasma was decreased by 68% for male and 62% for female, and (3)H-tracer of bile was decreased by 37% for male and 21% for female in phospholipid transfer protein KO mice compared with WT mice. However, there was no difference in liver, and (3)H-tracer of intestinal wall was increased by 43% for male and 27% for female. Finally, (3)H-tracer of fecal excretion in phospholipid transfer protein KO mice was reduced significantly by 36% for male and 43% for female during 0-24 h period, but there was no significant difference during 24-48 h period. Meanwhile, Western Blot analysis showed the expressions of reverse cholesterol transport -related protein liver X receptor α (LXRα), ATP binding cassette transporter A1, and cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase A1 were upregulated in liver of phospholipid transfer protein KO mice compared with WT mice. These data reveal that systemic phospholipid transfer protein deficiency in mice impairs macrophage-specific reverse cholesterol transport in vivo.
The purpose of this study was to examine the changes of cellular cholesterol efflux from macrophages in patients with type II diabetes mellitus (DM), and to determine the expression of CYP7A1, ABCG5, and LXRβ therein. We recruited 30 patients with type II DM (including 15 patients complicated with coronary heart disease and 15 patients with DM only) and 15 normal controls for this study. Peripheral blood monocytes were isolated for macrophage culture. The mRNA and protein expression levels of CYP7A1, ABCG5, and LXRβ were determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot. The macrophage cholesterol efflux rate was determined with 10% autoserum and standard serum as receptors. We determined that the expression levels of macrophage CYP7A1 mRNA and protein in the type II DM group were significantly lower than those in the control group, but no differences were found in the ABCG5 and LXRβ expression levels between the groups. The macrophage cholesterol efflux rate in the patients with type II DM was also significantly decreased compared with that of the normal control subjects (P &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, CYP7A1 mRNA expression and macrophage cholesterol efflux rate were significantly positively correlated. In summary, this study demonstrated that the macrophage cholesterol efflux in patients with type II DM was significantly reduced, and that this reduction was associated with the down-regulation of CYP7A1 expression.
Rhus verniciflua stokes (RVS) is a popular medicinal plant in oriental medicines which is commonly used to resolve extravasated blood. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of the role of RVS extracts on the regulation of lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis, we investigated whether RVS extract protect the hyperlipidemia in western diet-induced C57BL6/J mice. Mice fed a western diet and additionally RVS extracts was administered orally at a dose of 0.1 or 1 g/kg/day for 2 weeks respectively. Group with higher dose of RVS extract showed a significantly decreased body weight compared with western diet fed mice groups. And total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol levels and fatty liver formation were also improved especially in group of mice fed western diet supplemented high dose RVS extracts. Next, synthesis of hepatic bile acids were significantly increased in RVS extract fed groups. Furthermore, RVS extracts significantly increase promoter activity of Cyp7a1 via up-regulate the transcriptional expression level of LXRα. Our data suggest that RVS extracts could be a potent therapeutic ingredient for prevent a hyperlipidemia via increase of bile acids biosynthesis. 
1. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary probiotic supplementation on liver X receptor alpha (LXRα) and cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7α1) mRNA levels, protein enzymatic activities and fat metabolism in Cherry Valley Pekin ducks. 2. A total of 750 one-day-old Cherry Valley Pekin ducks were randomly divided into 5 groups with three replicates of 50 ducks each in a completely randomised experiment. Each group was fed on a basal diet supplemented with 0, 500, 1000, 1500 or 2000 mg probiotics/kg. 3. Body rate and feed conversion ratio were highest and abdominal subcutaneous fat % was lowest at 1000 mg probiotic/kg. 4. The mRNA levels of LXRα and CYP7α1 in liver tissue was estimated by RT-PCR; serum triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) concentrations were measured by ELISA. 5. The expression levels and enzyme activity of LXRα and CYP7α1 increased in conjunction with decreases in TG and TC concentrations following probiotic supplementation to a maximum at 1000 mg probiotics/kg and decreased thereafter. 6. It is concluded that dietary probiotics can enhance LXRα and CYP7α1 enzyme activities in the liver and reduce lipid concentrations and fat deposition in ducks. 
To characterize cholesterol regulation in the liver of patients with Alagille syndrome (AGS).
Serum total cholesterol (TC) and total bile acid (TBA) levels were measured in 23 AGS patients. The expressions of genes involved in cholesterol regulation, including low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC) A1, and ABCG1/5/8, were measured in liver tissues from five of these patients. Expression of regulators for these genes, including farnesoid X receptor/small heterodimer partner (SHP), liver X receptor α (LXRα) and mature Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) was measured. The expression of mature SREBP2 protein was also examined.
Serum TC and TBA levels were correlated in the AGS patients. Liver cholesterol was also increased compared with controls, and correlated with bile acid contents. LDLR, SR-BI, HMGCR, and ABCGs mRNA expression were upregulated, while CYP7A1 mRNA expression was downregulated in AGS livers. SHP and LXRα mRNA expression was also increased, but maturation of SREBP2 was not suppressed in the patients.
The major upregulators of liver cholesterol might be increased in AGS patients, indicating an impaired negative feedback mechanism and accelerated liver cholesterol accumulation.
Our results affirmed that supplementation of 1 or 2% mung bean could decrease plasma total cholesterol and triacylglycerol level. Mung bean increased mRNA 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase. Most importantly, mung bean increased not only the protein level of cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) but also mRNA CYP7A1. It was concluded that the hypocholesterolemic activity of mung bean was most probable mediated by enhancement of bile acid excretion and up-regulation of CYP7A1.
Nuclear receptors are involved in regulating the expression of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), however, their roles in the up-regulation of CYP7A1 by cholestyramine (CSR) are still unclear. In the present study, male Wistar rats were divided into four groups and fed [high sucrose + 10% lard diet] (H), [H + 3% CSR diet] (H + CSR), [H + 0.5% cholesterol + 0.25% sodium cholate diet] (C), or [C + 3% CSR diet] (C + CSR) for 2 weeks. Cholestyramine decreased serum and liver cholesterol levels significantly in rats fed C-based diets, but had no effect on these parameters in rats fed H-based diets. Cholestyramine raised hepatic levels of CYP7A1 mRNA and activity in both groups. The gene expression of hepatic ATP-binding cassettes A1 and G5, regulated by liver X receptor (LXR), were unchanged and down-regulated by cholestyramine, respectively. The mRNA levels of the hepatic ATP-binding cassette B11 and short heterodimer partner (SHP), regulated by farnesoid X receptor (FXR), were not changed by cholestyramine. C-based diets, which contained cholesterol and cholic acid, increased SHP mRNA levels compared to H-based diets. Consequently, in rats fed the C+CSR diet, hepatic FXR was activated by dietary bile acids, but the hepatic CYP7A1 mRNA level was increased 16-fold compared to that in rats fed an H diet. These results suggest that cholestyramine up-regulates the expression of CYP7A1 independently via LXR- or FXR-mediated pathways in rats.
Cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the pathway responsible for the formation of the majority of bile acids. Transcription of the gene is regulated by the size of the bile acid pool and dietary and hormonal factors. The farnesoid X receptor and the liver X receptor (LXR) are responsible for regulation by bile acids and cholesterol, respectively. To study the effects of dietary cholesterol and fat upon expression of the human CYP7A1 gene, mice were generated by crossing transgenic mice carrying the human CYP7A1 gene with mice that were homozygous knock-outs (CYP7A1(-/-)). The mice (mCYP7A1(-/-)/hCYP7A1) expressed the human gene at much higher levels than did the transgenics bred in the wild-type background. A diet containing 1% cholic acid reduced the expression of the human gene in mCYP7A1(-/-)/hCYP7A1 mice to undetectable levels. Cholestyramine (5%) increased the level of expression of the human gene and the mouse gene. Thus, farnesoid X receptor-mediated regulation was preserved. A diet containing 2% cholesterol increased expression of the mouse gene in wild-type mice, but it did not affect expression of the human gene in mCYP7A1(-/-)/hCYP7A1 mice. None of the diets altered the serum cholesterol or triglyceride levels in these mice; 1% cholic acid caused a redistribution of cholesterol from the high density lipoprotein to the low density lipoprotein density in the humanized mice but not in wild-type mice. A diet containing 30% saturated fat and 2% cholesterol caused a decrease in CYP7A1 levels in mCYP7A1(-/-)/hCYP7A1 mice. The serum cholesterol levels rose in all mice fed this diet. The increase was greater in the mCYP7A1(-/-)/hCYP7A1 mice. Together, these data suggest that the lack of an LXR element in the region from -56 to -49 of the human CYP7A1 promoter may account for some of the differences in response to diets between humans and rodents.
The production of apolipoprotein B (apoB)-containing lipoproteins by the liver is regulated by a complex series of processes involving apoB being cotranslationally translocated across the endoplasmic reticulum and assembled into a lipoprotein particle. The translocation of apoB across the endoplasmic reticulum is facilitated by the intraluminal chaperone, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP). MTP facilitates the translocation and folding of apoB, as well as the addition of lipid to lipid-binding domains (which consist of amphipathic beta sheets and alpha helices). In the absence of MTP or sufficient lipid, apoB exhibits translocation arrest. Thus, apoB translation, translocation, and assembly with lipids to form a core-containing lipoprotein particle occur as concerted processes. Abrogation of &gt;/=1 of these processes diverts apoB into a degradation pathway that is dependent on conjugation with ubiquitin and proteolysis by the proteasome. The nascent core-containing lipoprotein particle that forms within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum can be "enlarged" to form a mature very low density lipoprotein particle. Additional studies show that the assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins are linked to the cholesterol/bile acid synthetic pathway controlled by cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase. Studies in cultured cells and transgenic mice indicate that the expression of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase indirectly regulates the expression of lipogenic enzymes through changes in the cellular content of mature sterol response element binding proteins. Oxysterols and bile acids may also act via the ligand-activated nuclear receptors LXR and FXR to link the metabolic pathways controlling energy balance and lipid metabolism to nutritional state.
The cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase gene (CYP7A1) plays an important role in regulation of bile acid biosynthesis and cholesterol homeostasis. Oxysterol receptor, LXR, stimulates, whereas the bile acid receptor, FXR, inhibits CYP7A1 transcription. The goal of this study was to investigate the role of LXRalpha on the regulation of rat, human and hamster CYP7A1 transcription in its native promoter and cellular context. Cotransfection with LXRalpha and RXRalpha expression plasmids strongly stimulated rat CYP7A1/luciferase reporter activity in HepG2 cells and oxysterol was not required. However, LXRalpha had much less effect on hamster and no significant effect on human CYP7A1 promoter activity in HepG2 cells. In Chinese hamster ovary cells, cotransfection with LXRalpha stimulated reporter activity by less than 2-fold and addition of 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol caused a small but significant stimulation of rat, human and hamster CYP7A1 promoter activity. At least two direct repeats of AGGTCA-like sequences with 4-base spacing (DR4) and five-base spacing (DR5), in previously identified bile acid response elements of the rat CYP7A1 were able to bind LXRalpha/RXRalpha and confer LXRalpha stimulation. However, LXRalpha did not bind to the corresponding sequences of the human gene and bound weakly to hamster and mouse DR4 sequences. Therefore, rats and mice have the unusual capacity to convert cholesterol to bile acids by LXRalpha-mediated stimulation of CYP7A1 transcription, whereas other species do not respond to cholesterol and develop hypercholesterolemia on a diet high in cholesterol.
To investigate the effect of maternal dietary protein on hepatic cholesterol metabolism in offspring pigs and to detect underlying epigenetic mechanisms, 14 primiparous purebred Meishan sows were fed standard-protein (SP, n=7) or low-protein (LP, 50% of SP, n=7) diets during pregnancy and lactation, respectively. LP piglets showed significantly lower body weight and liver weight at weaning, associated with decreased liver and serum cholesterol content. Hepatic SREBP2, HMGCR and CYP7α1 mRNA expressions were all up-regulated in LP piglets, as well as SREBP2 protein content and HMGCR enzyme activity, compared to SP piglets, while the mRNA expression of LDLR, FXR, LXR and CYP27α1 was not altered. Hepatic activation of HMGCR gene transcription in LP piglets was associated with promoter hypomethylation, together with decreased histone H3, H3 lysine 9 monomethylation (H3K9me1) and H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and increased H3 acetylation. No CpG islands were predicted in the CYP7α1 promoter, and the augmented CYP7α1 transcription in LP piglets was associated with decreased H3, H3K9me1 and H3K27me3. No alterations were detected for hepatic expression of microRNAs predicted to target 3'-UTR of HMGCR or CYP7α1 gene. These results indicate that maternal low-protein diet during gestation and lactation affects hepatic cholesterol metabolism in weaning piglets by modifying the epigenetic regulation of HMGCR and CYP7α1 genes, which implicates possible long-term consequences in cholesterol homeostasis later in adult life.
Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) encodes for the rate-limiting step in the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids in the liver. In response to acute cholesterol feeding, mice upregulate CYP7A1 via stimulation of the liver X receptor (LXR) α. However, the effect of a chronic high-cholesterol diet on hepatic CYP7A1 expression in mice is unknown. We demonstrate that chronic cholesterol feeding (0.2% or 1.25% w/w cholesterol for 12 weeks) in FVB/NJ mice results in a &gt;60% suppression of hepatic CYP7A1 expression associated with a &gt;2-fold increase in hepatic cholesterol content. In contrast, acute cholesterol feeding induces a &gt;3-fold upregulation of hepatic CYP7A1 expression. We show that chronic, but not acute, cholesterol feeding increases the expression of hepatic inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, and interleukin (IL)-1β, which are known to suppress hepatic CYP7A1 expression. Chronic cholesterol feeding also results in activation of the mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinases, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Furthermore, we demonstrate in vitro that suppression of CYP7A1 by TNFα and IL-1β is dependent on JNK and ERK signaling. We conclude that chronic high-cholesterol feeding suppresses CYP7A1 expression in mice. We propose that chronic cholesterol feeding induces inflammatory cytokine activation and liver damage, which leads to suppression of CYP7A1 via activation of JNK and ERK signaling pathways.
Rats and hamsters are commonly used rodents to test the efficacy of cholesterol-lowering functional foods. In general, a diet containing 1% cholesterol for rats whereas a diet containing 0.1% cholesterol for hamsters is used to induce the hypercholesterolemia. The present study was carried out to compare hamsters with rats as a hypercholesterolemia model. Golden Syrian hamsters and Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups and fed one of the four diets containing 0-0.9% cholesterol. Results demonstrated that serum total cholesterol (TC) in hamsters was raised 73-81% higher than that in rats fed the same cholesterol diets. Unlike rats in which HDL-C accounted very little for serum TC, the lipoprotein profile in hamsters was closer to that in humans. We investigated interaction of higher cholesterol diets with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutary-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) and cholesterol-7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), sterol regulatory element binding protein-2 (SREBP-2), and liver X receptor (LXR-alpha). Results showed hamsters and rats metabolized cholesterol differently. In view that hamsters synthesize and excrete cholesterol and bile acids in a manner similar to that in humans, it is concluded that hamsters but not rats shall be chosen as a model to study efficacy of cholesterol-lowering functional foods.
Regular exercise prevents and regresses atherosclerosis by improving lipid metabolism and antioxidant defenses. Exercise ameliorates the reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), an antiatherogenic system that drives cholesterol from arterial macrophages to the liver for excretion into bile and feces. In this study we analyzed the role of aerobic exercise on the in vivo RCT and expression of genes and proteins involved in lipid flux and inflammation in peritoneal macrophages, aortic arch and liver from wild type mice.
Twelve-week-old male mice were divided into sedentary and trained groups. Exercise training was performed in a treadmill (15 m/min, 30 min/day, 5 days/week). Plasma lipids were determined by enzymatic methods and lipoprotein profile by fast protein liquid chromatography. After intraperitoneal injection of J774-macrophages the RCT was assessed by measuring the recovery of (3)H-cholesterol in plasma, feces and liver. The expression of liver receptors was determined by immunoblot, macrophages and aortic mRNAs by qRT-PCR. (14)C-cholesterol efflux mediated by apo A-I and HDL2 and the uptake of (3)H-cholesteryl oleoyl ether ((3)H-COE)-acetylated-LDL were determined in macrophages isolated from sedentary and trained animals 48 h after the last exercise session.
Body weight, plasma lipids, lipoprotein profile, glucose and blood pressure were not modified by exercise training. A greater amount of (3)H-cholesterol was recovered in plasma (24 h and 48 h) and liver (48 h) from trained animals in comparison to sedentary. No difference was found in (3)H-cholesterol excreted in feces between trained and sedentary mice. The hepatic expression of scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) and LDL receptor (B-E) was enhanced by exercise. We observed 2.8 and 1.7 fold rise, respectively, in LXR and Cyp7a mRNA in the liver of trained as compared to sedentary mice. Macrophage and aortic expression of genes involved in lipid efflux was not systematically changed by physical exercise. In agreement, (14)C-cholesterol efflux and uptake of (3)H-COE-acetylated-LDL by macrophages was similar between sedentary and trained animals.
Aerobic exercise in vivo accelerates the traffic of cholesterol from macrophages to the liver contributing to prevention and regression of atherosclerosis, independently of changes in macrophage and aorta gene expression.
Bile acid synthesis is regulated by nuclear receptors including farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and small heterodimer partner (SHP), and by fibroblast growth factor 15/19 (FGF15/19). We hypothesized that hepatic cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase (CSAD) (a key enzyme in taurine synthesis) is regulated by bile acids (BA). The aim of this study was to investigate CSAD regulation by BA dependent regulatory mechanisms.
Mice were fed a control diet or a diet supplemented with either 0.5% cholate or 2% cholestyramine. To study BA dependent pathways, we utilized GW4064 (FXR agonist), FGF19 or T-0901317 (liver X receptor [LXR] agonist) and Shp-/- mice. Tissue mRNA was determined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Amino acids were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography.
Mice supplemented with dietary cholate exhibited reduced hepatic CSAD mRNA while those receiving cholestyramine exhibited increased mRNA. Activation of FXR suppressed CSAD mRNA expression whereas CSAD expression was increased in Shp-/- mice. Hepatic hypotaurine concentration (the product of CSAD) was higher in Shp-/- mice with a corresponding increase in serum taurine conjugated BA. FGF19 administration suppressed hepatic cholesterol 7-α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) mRNA but did not change CSAD mRNA expression. LXR activation induced CYP7A1 mRNA yet failed to induce CSAD mRNA expression.
BA regulate CSAD mRNA expression in a feedback fashion via mechanisms involving SHP and FXR but not FGF15/19 or LXR. These findings implicate BA as regulators of CSAD mRNA via mechanisms shared with CYP7A1.
In order to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying effects of feeding rice protein on lipid and glucose homeostasis, weanling rats were fed AIN-93G diets made with casein or rice protein isolate (RPI) for 14 d. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)alpha genes and proteins involved in fatty acid degradation were upregulated by feeding RPI (P &lt; 0.05), accompanied by increased promoter binding and nuclear expression of PPARalpha and its heterodimerization partner retinoid X receptor (P &lt; 0.05). Effects of RPI feeding on hepatic PPARgamma signaling were significant but less robust. Feeding RPI also increased hepatic genes involved in cholesterol metabolism and transport. However, feeding RPI had no effect on binding of liver X-receptor (LXR)alpha to the cytochrome P450 (CYP)7A1 promoter. The effect of RPI feeding on PPARalpha signaling appeared to be direct and was reversed when RPI diets were switched to casein. In another experiment, male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed casein diets from postnatal day (PND) 24 to PND64 or were fed high fat 'Western' diets containing 0.5% cholesterol made with either casein or RPI. Increased liver triglyceride content, hypercholesterolemia and insulin resistance in the 'Western' diet-fed rats were partially prevented by feeding RPI (P &lt; 0.05). mRNA and protein expression of hepatic enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis were suppressed by feeding 'Western diets' containing RPI (P &lt; 0.05), despite a lack of effects on nuclear concentrations of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c. These data suggest that attenuation of metabolic syndrome observed in RPI-fed rats after consumption of diets high in fat and cholesterol occur as a result of improved lipid and glucose homeostasis partly as a result of activation of PPARs.
Adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) are novel tools in toxicology and human risk assessment with broad potential. AOPs are designed to provide a clear-cut mechanistic representation of critical toxicological effects that span over different layers of biological organization. AOPs share a common structure consisting of a molecular initiating event, a series of intermediate steps and key events, and an adverse outcome. Development of AOPs ideally complies with OECD guidelines. This also holds true for AOP evaluation, which includes consideration of the Bradford Hill criteria for weight-of-evidence assessment and meeting a set of key questions defined by the OECD. Elaborate AOP frameworks have yet been proposed for chemical-induced skin sensitization, cholestasis, liver fibrosis and liver steatosis. These newly postulated AOPs can serve a number of ubiquitous purposes, including the establishment of (quantitative) structure-activity relationships, the development of novel in vitro toxicity screening tests and the elaboration of prioritization strategies. 
Dithiolethiones, a novel class of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activators, prevent insulin resistance through AMPK-dependent p70 ribosomal S6 kinase-1 (S6K1) inhibition. There is no known effect of S6K1 for liver X receptor-alpha (LXRalpha)-mediated lipogenic gene expression and steatosis, a cause of chronic liver disease. This study investigated the role of S6K1 in LXRalpha activation and the effects of oltipraz (prototype) and other dithiolethiones on LXRalpha-dependent lipogenesis in hepatocytes and high-fat diet animal model. Oltipraz prevented the ability of LXRalpha agonist (T0901317) to activate sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), inhibiting its own mRNA and protein induction. Impaired SREBP-1c activity by oltipraz caused inhibition of LXRalpha-induced transcription of the fatty acid synthase, LXRalpha, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1, and adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter A1 genes. S6K1 activation antagonized the inhibitory effect of oltipraz on SREBP-1c activation, whereas dominant negative (DN) mutant S6K1 and rapamycin inhibited the T0901317-induced SREBP-1c expression. Oltipraz impaired LXRalpha DNA binding activity and LXR agonist-induced CYP7A1-LXRE-luciferase (CYP7A1) transactivation. Moreover, in vitro S6K1 directly phosphorylated LXRalpha at serine residues for gene transactivation, which was antagonized by its DN mutant. S6K1 inhibition antagonized CYP7A1 induction promoted by AMPK inhibition, whereas AMPK activation abrogated S6K1-dependent CYP7A1 induction, supporting the opposing role of S6K1 and AMPK in LXR activity. Finally, oltipraz was found to inhibit hepatic triglyceride accumulation and lipogenic gene induction in mice fed a high-fat diet. Other dithiolethiones also inhibited SREBP-1c induction by T0901317.
Our findings showing the role of AMPK-S6K1 pathway in LXR activity and S6K1-dependent inhibition of LXRalpha-induced lipogenic gene transactivation by a novel class of dithiolethiones led to the identification of S6K1 as a particularly attractive target for intervention in hepatic steatosis.
Maintenance of normal lipid levels has implicated the involvement of genes induced by liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha) and Farnesoid X receptor (FXR). This study was designed to evaluate the hypolipidemic effects of n-butanol extract (NE3) of Panax notoginseng (Burk.) F.H. Chen root on lipid homeostasis and investigate the possible mechanisms in animal experiments. In the transactivation assays, NE3 was identified as a dual FXR/LXRalpha agonist. Subsequently, Sprague-Dawley male rats on a high-fat/high-cholesterol diet were treated orally with NE3 or vehicle alone. As expected, the concentrations of serum TC, TG and LDL-C in rats treated with various concentrations of NE3 showed significant (P&lt;0.01) and dose-dependent decrease, respectively, accompanied with a significant (P&lt;0.01) and dose-dependent decrease in the concentration of hepatic TC and TG. Express-level analysis indicated that both LXRalpha target genes including ABCA1, ABCG5, ABCG8 and FXR target genes including ApoCII and SHP were significantly induced by NE3 (P&lt;0.01). Interestingly, LDLR mRNA level was significantly higher by NE3 (P&lt;0.01), accompanied with the significantly decreased expression levels of CYP7A1, ApoCIII and SREBP1c genes (P&lt;0.01). Based on these results, it can be concluded that NE3 as a dual FXR/LXRalpha agonist largely prevented the accumulation of abnormal lipid in the hyperlipidemic rats.
The nuclear receptors liver X receptor (LXR) LXRalpha and LXRbeta are differentially expressed ligand-activated transcription factors that induce genes controlling cholesterol homeostasis and lipogenesis. Synthetic ligands for both receptor subtypes activate ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1)-mediated cholesterol metabolism, increase reverse cholesterol transport, and provide atheroprotection in mice. However, these ligands may also increase hepatic triglyceride (TG) synthesis via a sterol response element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c)-dependent mechanism through a process reportedly regulated by LXRalpha. We studied pan-LXRalpha/beta agonists in LXRalpha knockout mice to assess the contribution of LXRbeta to the regulation of selected target genes. In vitro dose-response studies with macrophages from LXRalpha-/- and beta-/- mice confirm an equivalent role for LXRalpha and LXRbeta in the regulation of ABCA1 and SREBP-1c gene expression. Cholesterol-efflux studies verify that LXRbeta can drive apoA1-dependent cholesterol mobilization from macrophages. The in vivo role of LXRbeta in liver was further evaluated by treating LXRalpha-/- mice with a pan-LXRalpha/beta agonist. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol increased without significant changes in plasma TG or very low density lipoprotein. Analysis of hepatic gene expression consistently revealed less activation of ABCA1 and SREBP-1c genes in the liver of LXRalpha null animals than in treated wild-type controls. In addition, hepatic CYP7A1 and several genes involved in fatty acid/TG biosynthesis were not induced. In peripheral tissues from these LXRalpha-null mice, LXRbeta activation increases ABCA1 and SREBP-1c gene expression in a parallel manner. However, putative elevation of SREBP-1c activity in these tissues did not cause hypertriglyceridemia. In summary, selective LXRbeta activation is expected to stimulate ABCA1 gene expression in macrophages, contribute to favorable HDL increases, but circumvent hepatic LXRalpha-dominated lipogenesis.
Liver X receptors (LXR) alpha and beta play an important role in regulating the expression of genes involved in hepatic bile and fatty acid synthesis, glucose metabolism, as well as sterol efflux. Studies with human embryonic kidney 293 cells indicate that unsaturated fatty acids interfere with oxysterols binding to LXR and antagonize oxysterol-induced LXRalpha activity. In this report, we evaluated the effects of unsaturated fatty acids on LXR-regulated hepatic gene expression. The LXR agonist, T1317, induced mRNAs encoding sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) and two SREBP-1c-regulated lipogenic genes, e.g. fatty-acid synthase and the S14 protein in primary hepatocytes. Treatment of hepatocytes with eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) suppressed these mRNAs in the absence and presence of T1317. The cis-regulatory elements targeted by T1317 were not required for fatty-acid suppression of FAS or S14 promoter activity. In contrast to SREBP-1-regulated lipogenic genes, 20:5n-3 had no effect on the T1317 induction of ABCG5 or ABCG8 in the rat hepatoma cell line, FTO-2B. These two genes require LXR but not SREBP-1c for their expression. Feeding rats a diet supplemented with fish oil suppressed hepatic SREBP-1c-regulated genes and induced PPARalpha-regulated genes but had no effect on the LXR-regulated transcripts, CYP7A1, ABCG5, or ABCG8. Transfection studies, using either full-length hLXRalpha or a chimera containing only the LXRalpha ligand binding domain, indicate that a wide array of unsaturated fatty acids had little effect on LXRalpha activity in primary hepatocytes or FTO-2B. These studies suggest that LXRalpha is not a target for unsaturated fatty acid regulation in primary rat hepatocytes or in liver. Thus, oxysterol/LXR-mediated regulation of transcripts involved in bile acid synthesis or sterol efflux appear insensitive to dietary unsaturated fatty acids. The unsaturated fatty acid suppression of SREBP-1 and its targeted lipogenic genes is independent of LXRalpha
The mechanisms involved in spironolactone (SL, 200 micromol/kg body weight, 3 days i.p.)-induced choleresis were explored in vivo by evaluating bile salt export pump (Bsep)-, multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp2)-, and anion exchanger 2 (AE2)-mediated secretory processes in rat liver. Hepatic bile salt metabolism was also analyzed. Total bile flow was significantly increased by SL, primarily due to an increase in bile salt-independent bile flow, whereas bile salt secretion was decreased. SL did not produce any choleresis in TR(-) rats. SL decreased the de novo bile salt synthesis rate in concordance with impaired microsomal cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity, thus leading to a decrease in endogenous bile salt pool size. In contrast, the maximum secretory rate of tauroursodeoxycholate as well as expression of Bsep protein detected by Western blotting were not affected. Thus, decreased bile salt availability for canalicular transport rather than transport capability itself likely explains reduced biliary secretion of bile salts. Biliary secretion of glutathione, an endogenous substrate of Mrp2, and HCO(3)(-), the AE2 substrate, were increased by SL, as a main factor explaining enhanced bile salt-independent bile flow. Western blot studies revealed increased expression of Mrp2 in response to SL whereas AE2 content remained unchanged. Enhanced activity and expression of Mrp2 was confirmed by analyzing the excretion rate of dinitrophenyl S-glutathione, an exogenous substrate of Mrp2, in isolated hepatocytes and by immunofluorescence microscopy, respectively. We conclude that SL increased bile flow mainly by increasing the biliary secretion of glutathione species and HCO(3)(-); increased expression of Mrp2 is also involved.
Deoxycholic acid (DCA) is a known hepatotoxicant, a tissue tumor promoter, and has been implicated in colorectal cancer. Male mice are more susceptible to DCA toxicity than female mice. Organic anion transporting polypeptide 1a1 (Oatp1a1), which is known to transport bile acids (BAs) in vitro, is predominantly expressed in livers of male mice. In addition, the concentrations of DCA and its taurine conjugate (TDCA) are increased in serum of Oatp1a1-null mice. To investigate whether Oatp1a1 contributes to the gender difference in DCA toxicity in mice, wild-type (WT) and Oatp1a1-null mice were fed a 0.3% DCA diet for 7 days. After feeding DCA, Oatp1a1-null mice had 30-fold higher concentrations of DCA in both serum and livers than WT mice. Feeding DCA caused more hepatotoxcity in Oatp1a1-null mice than WT mice. After feeding DCA, Oatp1a1-null mice expressed higher BA efflux-transporters (bile salt-export pump, organic solute transporter (Ost)α/β, and multidrug resistance-associated protein [Mrp]2) and lower BA-synthetic enzymes (cytochrome P450 [Cyp]7a1, 8b1, 27a1, and 7b1) in livers than WT mice. Intravenous administration of DCA and TDCA showed that lack of Oatp1a1 does not decrease the plasma elimination of DCA or TDCA. After feeding DCA, the concentrations of DCA in ileum and colon tissues are higher in Oatp1a1-null than in WT mice. In addition, Oatp1a1-null mice have enhanced intestinal permeability. Taken together, the current data suggest that Oatp1a1 does not mediate the hepatic uptake of DCA or TDCA, but lack of Oatp1a1 increases intestinal permeability and thus enhances the absorption of DCA in mice.
To investigate CYP 7A1 gene mutations in Chinese patients with 17alpha-hydroxylase deficiency.
Clinical data were retrospectively analyzed. CYP17A1 mutations were detected in two cases with 17alpha-hydroxylase deficiency. Genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples and eight primers pairs were used to amplify eight exons and exon-intron boundaries of the CYP17A1 gene. The amplified PCR products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and then directly sequenced. Sequencing results were compared to the established human CYP17A1 sequence.
Two compound mutations were identified: TAC --&gt; AA at codons 436-438 on exon 6, causing the amino acid missense mutation Y329K/418X; and deletion of the 9-bp sequence GACTCTTTC at codons 487-489 on exon 8, causing deletion of three amino acids (Asp-Ser-Phe).
D487_F489del and Y329K, 418X CYP17A1 mutations were identified in our two patients. A literature review revealed that the main CYP17A1 mutations in the Chinese population are missense and splicing defects, and exons 8 and 6 are most frequently involved.
7-Ketocholesterol is a bioactive sterol, a potent competitive inhibitor of cytochrome P450 7A1, and toxic in liver cells. Multiple origins of this compound have been identified, with cholesterol being the presumed precursor. Although routes for formation of the 7-keto compound from cholesterol have been established, we found that 7-dehydrocholesterol (the immediate precursor of cholesterol) is oxidized by P450 7A1 to 7-ketocholesterol (k(cat)/K(m) = 3 × 10(4) m(-1) s(-1)). P450 7A1 converted lathosterol (Δ(5)-dihydro-7-dehydrocholesterol) to a mixture of the 7-keto and 7α,8α-epoxide products (~1:2 ratio), with the epoxide not rearranging to the ketone. The oxidation of 7-dehydrocholesterol occured with predominant formation of 7-ketocholesterol and with the 7α,8α-epoxide as only a minor product; the synthesized epoxide was stable in the presence of P450 7A1. The mechanism of 7-dehydrocholesterol oxidation to 7-ketocholesterol is proposed to involve a Fe(III)-O-C-C(+) intermediate and a 7,8-hydride shift or an alternative closing to yield the epoxide (Liebler, D. C., and Guengerich, F. P. (1983) Biochemistry 22, 5482-5489). Accordingly, reaction of P450 7A1 with 7-[(2)H(1)]dehydrocholesterol yielded complete migration of deuterium in the product 7-ketocholesterol. The finding that 7-dehydrocholesterol is a precursor of 7-ketocholesterol has relevance to an inborn error of metabolism known as Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) caused by defective cholesterol biosynthesis. Mutations within the gene encoding 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase, the last enzyme in the pathway, lead to the accumulation of 7-dehydrocholesterol in tissues and fluids of SLOS patients. Our findings suggest that 7-ketocholesterol levels may also be elevated in SLOS tissue and fluids as a result of P450 7A1 oxidation of 7-dehydrocholesterol.
Cholestasis leads to liver cell death, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and eventually liver failure. Despite limited benefits, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the only Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for cholestatic disorders. Retinoic acid (RA) is a ligand for nuclear receptors that modulate bile salt homeostasis. RA also possesses immunomodulatory effects and is used to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia and inflammatory disorders such as psoriasis, acne, and rheumatoid arthritis. To test whether the supplementation of RA with UDCA is superior to UDCA alone for treating cholestasis, male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent common bile duct ligation (BDL) for 14 days and were treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), UDCA, all-trans retinoic acid (atRA), or UDCA and atRA by gavage. Treatment with UDCA and atRA substantially improved animal growth rates, significantly reduced liver fibrosis and bile duct proliferation, and nearly eliminated liver necrosis after BDL. Reductions in the bile salt pool size and liver hydroxyproline content were also seen with treatment with atRA or atRA and UDCA versus PBS and UDCA. Furthermore, atRA and UDCA significantly reduced liver messenger RNA and/or protein expression of transforming growth factor β1 (Tgf-β1), collagen 1a1 (Col1A1), matrix metalloproteinase 2 (Mmp2), cytokeratin 19, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), cytochrome P450 7A1 (Cyp7a1), tumor necrosis factor α, and interleukin-β1. The molecular mechanisms of this treatment were also assessed in human hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells, and LX-2 cells. atRA alone or in combination with UDCA greatly repressed CYP7A1 expression in human hepatocytes and significantly inhibited COL1A1, MMP2, and α-SMA expression and/or activity in primary human hepatic stellate cells and LX-2 cells. Furthermore, atRA reduced TGF-β1-induced Smad2 phosphorylation in LX-2 cells.
Our findings indicate that the addition of RA to UDCA reduces the bile salt pool size and liver fibrosis and might be an effective supplemental therapy with UDCA for cholestatic diseases.
In vitro production of human hepatocytes is of primary importance in basic research, pharmacotoxicology and biotherapy of liver diseases. We have developed a protocol of differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (ES) towards hepatocyte-like cells (ES-Hep). Using a set of human adult markers including CAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBPalpha), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4/7 ratio (HNF4alpha1/HNF4alpha7), cytochrome P450 7A1 (CYP7A1), CYP3A4 and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), and fetal markers including alpha-fetoprotein, CYP3A7 and glutathione S-transferase P1, we analyzed the expression of a panel of 41 genes in ES-Hep comparatively with human adult primary hepatocytes, adult and fetal liver. The data revealed that after 21 days of differentiation, ES-Hep are representative of fetal hepatocytes at less than 20 weeks of gestation. The glucocorticoid receptor pathway was functional in ES-Hep. Extending protocols of differentiation to 4 weeks did not improve cell maturation. When compared with hepatocyte-like cells derived from adult liver non parenchymal epithelial (NPE) cells (NPE-Hep), ES-Hep expressed several adult and fetal liver makers at much greater levels (at least one order of magnitude), consistent with greater expression of liver-enriched transcription factors Forkhead box A2, C/EBPalpha, HNF4alpha and HNF6. It therefore seems that ES-Hep reach a better level of differentiation than NPE-Hep and that these cells use different lineage pathways towards the hepatic phenotype. Finally we showed that lentivirus-mediated expression of xenoreceptor CAR in ES-Hep induced the expression of several detoxification genes including CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, UDP-glycosyltransferase 1A1, solute carriers 21A6, as well as biotransformation of midazolam, a CYP3A4-specific substrate.
Cytochrome P450 (P450) 7A1 is well known as the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, the first enzyme involved in bile acid synthesis from cholesterol. The human enzyme has been reported to have the highest catalytic activity of any mammalian P450. Analyses of individual steps of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylation reaction revealed several characteristics of this reaction: (i) two-step binding of cholesterol to ferric P450, with an apparent K(d) of 0.51 μM, (ii) a rapid reduction rate in the presence of cholesterol (∼10 s(-1) for the fast phase), (iii) rapid formation of a ferrous P450-cholesterol-O(2) complex (29 s(-1)), (iv) the lack of a non-competitive kinetic deuterium isotope effect, (v) the lack of a kinetic burst, and (vi) the lack of a deuterium isotope effect when the reaction was initiated with the ferrous P450-cholesterol complex. A minimum kinetic model was developed and is consistent with all of the observed phenomena and the rates of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylation and H(2)O and H(2)O(2) formation. The results indicate that the first electron transfer step, although rapid, becomes rate-limiting in the overall P450 7A1 reaction. This is a different phenomenon compared with other P450s that have much lower rates of catalysis, attributed to the much more efficient substrate oxidation steps in this reaction.
Over the past two decades, it has become increasingly clear that the intestine, in addition to the liver, plays an important role in the metabolism of xenobiotics. Previously, we developed a microfluidic-based in vitro system for the perifusion of precision-cut liver slices for metabolism studies. In the present study, the applicability of this system for the perifusion of precision-cut intestinal slices, and for the sequential perifusion of intestinal and liver slices, all from rat, was tested to mimic the in vivo first pass situation. Intestinal and liver slices, exposed to the substrates 7-ethoxycoumarin (7-EC), 7-hydroxycoumarin (7-HC) and lidocaine (Li), exhibited similar metabolic rates in the biochip and in the well plates for periods of at least 3 h. The metabolic rate remained the same when two slices were placed in adjacent microchambers and perifused sequentially. In addition, the system has been adapted to sequentially perifuse intestinal and liver tissue slices in a two-compartment co-culture perfusion system with a continuous flow of medium. It becomes possible to direct metabolites or other excreted compounds formed by an intestinal slice in the first compartment to the second compartment containing a liver slice. The intestine does not influence liver metabolism for these substrates. The interplay between these two organs was demonstrated by exposing the slices to the primary bile acid, chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). CDCA induced the expression of fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15) in the intestinal slice, which resulted in a stronger down-regulation of the enzyme, cytochrome P450 7A1 (CYP7A1), in the liver slice in the second compartment than when the liver slice was exposed to CDCA in a single-microchamber biochip. We thus demonstrate in this paper that intestinal slices, in addition to liver slices, remain functional in the biochip under flow conditions, and that the two-microchamber biochip has great potential for the study of interorgan effects. This is the first example of the incorporation of both liver and intestinal slices in a microfluidic device. Use of this microfluidic system will improve our insight into interorgan interactions and elucidate as yet unknown mechanisms involved in toxicity, gene regulation and drug-drug interactions.
Chemical derivatization is useful for improving the ionization characteristics of poorly or nonionizable analytes in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Dansyl chloride has been widely used as a derivatizing reagent for fluorescence detection and for facilitating the MS detection of phenols and amines, but not for general alcohols. A new dansylation method for improving the mass spectral sensitivity of unactivated alcohols was developed. The dansylated derivative was formed after incubation of the test compound cholesterol and excess dansyl chloride in CH(2)Cl(2) in the presence of 4-(dimethylamino)-pyridine (DMAP) plus N,N-diisopropylethylamine at 65 °C for 1 h, with an overall yield of 96%. The versatility of dansylation was investigated by utilizing representative lipid compounds (containing different numbers of hydroxy groups) for dansylation. All dansylated derivatives of the selected compounds were detected by LC-MS/MS in the electrospray ionization (ESI) positive ion mode. Validation of the method was established in terms of the sensitivity, stability, and repeatability of dansylation. The method was then applied to characterizing the P450 7A1 oxidation product (dansylated 7α-hydroxycholesterol) in human liver extracts using an LC-MS metabolomics/isotopic labeling approach (Tang, Z.; Guengerich, F. P. Anal. Chem. 2009, 81, 3071-3078). The dansylated derivative of the product was identified, with the signal increased by 10(3)-fold compared with a previous method (derivatization with succinic anhydride and ESI negative ion MS). Quantitation of testosterone in human liver extracts was also done as an example of the application of the dansylation method. Thus, dansylation is a potential method of modifying many alcohols for detection by fluorescence and LC-MS analysis.
De novo bile acid synthesis in the liver needs to be tightly regulated in order to maintain optimal bile flow and prevent cholestasis. In the liver, fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) regulates bile acid synthesis by down-regulating messenger RNA levels of cytochrome P450 7A1 (CYP7A1). FGF19 acts through fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4), and beta-Klotho has recently been recognized as a modulator of FGFR4 activity. However, its precise mechanism of action has not been thoroughly described. We show here that beta-Klotho is an endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein that affects the cellular abundance of different FGFR4 glycoforms. beta-Klotho binds and directs the core glycoform of FGFR4 to the proteasome, and it allows only a terminal glycoform to reach the plasma membrane. Only the terminal FGFR4 glycoform is phosphorylated upon FGF19 treatment of HepG2 cells, and this shows that only fully glycosylated FGFR4 is active in CYP7A1 down-regulation.
beta-Klotho enhances FGF19 signaling by binding the inactive, core-glycosylated FGFR4 and preventing it from reaching the surface. These results indicate that beta-Klotho is an indirect regulator of FGFR4, whereas glycosylation is the master switch for FGF19 activity and regulation of bile acid synthesis.
An improved ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS/MS) method was established for the simultaneous analysis of various bile acids (BA) and applied to investigate liver BA content in C57BL/6 mice fed 1% cholic acid (CA), 0.3% deoxycholic acid (DCA), 0.3% chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), 0.3% lithocholic acid (LCA), 3% ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), or 2% cholestyramine (resin). Results indicate that mice have a remarkable ability to maintain liver BA concentrations. The BA profiles in mouse livers were similar between CA and DCA feedings, as well as between CDCA and LCA feedings. The mRNA expression of Cytochrome P450 7a1 (Cyp7a1) was suppressed by all BA feedings, whereas Cyp7b1 was suppressed only by CA and UDCA feedings. Gender differences in liver BA composition were observed after feeding CA, DCA, CDCA, and LCA, but they were not prominent after feeding UDCA. Sulfation of CA and CDCA was found at the 7-OH position, and it was increased by feeding CA or CDCA more in male than female mice. In contrast, sulfation of LCA and taurolithocholic acid (TLCA) was female-predominant, and it was increased by feeding UDCA and LCA. In summary, the present systematic study on BA metabolism in mice will aid in interpreting BA-mediated gene regulation and hepatotoxicity.
Ritonavir (RTV) and other protease inhibitors (PIs) used for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are associated with elevated serum triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol in some patients. A rat strain (Sprague-Dawley or SD) commonly used in toxicology studies is not sensitive to RTV-induced hyperlipidemia, making mechanistic studies and the identification of novel, lipid-neutral PIs challenging. The objective of this study was to identify a rat strain that mirrors human PI-associated hyperlipidemia. RTV was administered at 100 mg/kg/day for 5 days to a panel of 14 rat strains estimated to cover approximately 86% of the known genetic variance in rats. Increased serum TG and cholesterol levels occurred only in two rat strains, including LEW x BN rats. Livers from LEW x BN (sensitive) and SD (resistant) rats were then evaluated using microarrays to investigate differences in the transcriptomic response to RTV. Several genes, including some involved in bile acid biosynthesis, gluconeogenesis, and carbohydrate metabolism, were differentially regulated between the two strains. In particular, cytochrome P450 7A1 (CYP7A1), a key enzyme for cholesterol metabolism, was down-regulated in the sensitive and up-regulated in resistant rats. Collectively, these results demonstrate the utility of a genetically diverse rat panel to identify strains with clinical relevance for a particular adverse effect. Furthermore, the genome-wide transcriptomic analysis suggests that RTV-induced hyperlipidemia is at least in part due to changes in hepatic lipid biosynthesis and metabolism. These findings will facilitate the discovery of novel, lipid-neutral HIV PIs and the identification of relevant biomarkers for this adverse event.
Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), a semisynthetic, nonfermentable soluble dietary fiber, is not absorbed by the body, but its presence in the intestinal lumen increases fecal fat, sterol, and bile acid excretions and decreases intestinal cholesterol absorption, all of which may indirectly affect hepatic lipid metabolism. We measured the expression of hepatic genes involved in cholesterol, bile acid, and fatty acid metabolism in hamsters fed diets containing 39% of energy as fat and 5% of weight as HPMC or microcrystalline cellulose (control) for 4 wk. HPMC-fed hamsters gained significantly less body weight than the control group but did not differ in food intake. They had significantly lower plasma triglyceride and total-, VLDL-, HDL-, and LDL-cholesterol concentrations and hepatic total lipid, total and free cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations than controls. Compared with controls, HPMC-fed hamsters had greater levels of mRNA for CYP7A1 (cytochrome P450 7A1; 8-fold of control; P &lt; 0.05), CYP51 (lanosterol 14alpha-demethylase; 5.3-fold of control; P &lt; 0.05), and HMG-CoAR (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase; 1.8-fold of control; P &lt; 0.05). The plasma total cholesterol concentrations from both the control and HPMC groups were inversely correlated with expression of hepatic CYP7A1 (r = -0.54; P &lt; 0.05), CYP51 (r = -0.79; P &lt; 0.005), and HMG-CoAR (r = -0.75; P &lt; 0.005) genes. This suggests that HPMC supplementation affected both cholesterol and bile acid synthesis. Our data confirm that altered hepatic expression of lipid metabolism-related genes, possibly due to modulation of fecal bile acid excretion and intestinal cholesterol absorption, contributes to the lipid-lowering effects of HPMC.
Two diets simulating the recommendations of the American Heart Association to increase the intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) were tested on Golden Syrian hamsters and compared to the diet simulating the current estimated consumption of fat in the United States. N-3 PUFAs were evaluated for their effects on serum and brain lipids and on the three cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs 7A1, 27A1, and 46A1) that play key roles in cholesterol elimination from different organs. Hamsters on the highest concentration of n-3 PUFAs had a statistically significant decrease in LDL and HDL cholesterol and no change in serum total cholesterol and triglycerides levels. CYP27A1 and CYP46A1 mRNA levels were increased in the liver and brain, respectively, whereas possible effects on CYP7A1 were obscured by a marked intergroup variability at mRNA, protein, and sterol product levels. Increased levels of CYP46A1 mRNA in the brain did not lead to significant changes in the levels of lathosterol, 24S-hydroxycholesterol or cholesterol in this organ. The data obtained are discussed in relation to inconsistent effects of n-3 PUFAs on serum lipids in human trials and reported positive effects of fish oil on cognitive function.
A culture system with spherical multicellular aggregates (spheroids), which are formed by the rearrangement and compaction of cell aggregates, is reported to be more useful than the traditional monolayer culture system for the culture of primary hepatocytes. By performing real-time polymerase chain reaction, we analyzed the expression of genes encoding key molecules involved in liver-specific functions, namely, cell adhesion molecules (integrin 3, cadherin 1 and connexin 32), transcription factors (hepatic nuclear factor 4alpha and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta), protein and metabolic enzymes (albumin, glucose-6-phosphatase, tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase, arginase 1 and cytochrome P450 7A1) and transporters (organic anion transporting peptide 1, multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 and bile salt export pump), in spheroids derived from rat hepatocytes. Further, we compared these expression levels with those in a hepatocyte monolayer and in liver tissue. Only the gene encoding glucose-6-phosphatase (required for sugar metabolism) was expressed at a similar level in both the monolayer culture and liver tissue for 10 days of culture; the expression of all the other genes in the monolayer culture either rapidly decreased or completely disappeared as the culture duration increased. Although the expression levels of all the genes in the spheroids tended to decrease gradually with culture time, they were consistently higher than those in the monolayer culture for at least 10 days of culture. These results suggest that hepatocyte spheroids acquire intercellular organization and largely maintain many intercellular metabolic functions. Thus, the hepatocyte spheroid culture system seems to be promising for various in vitro cell-based assays.
Hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 4alpha is a key transcription factor regulating endo/xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes and transporters. We investigated whether microRNAs are involved in the regulation of human HNF4alpha. Potential recognition elements for miR-24 (MRE24) were identified in the coding region and the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR), and those for miR-34a (MRE34a) were identified in the 3'-UTR in HNF4alpha mRNA. The HNF4alpha protein level in HepG2 cells was markedly decreased by the overexpression of miR-24 and miR-34a. The HNF4alpha mRNA level was significantly decreased by the overexpression of miR-24 but not by miR-34a. In luciferase analyses in HEK293 cells, the reporter activity of plasmid containing the 3'-UTR of HNF4alpha was significantly decreased by miR-34a. The reporter activity of plasmid containing the HNF4alpha coding region downstream of the luciferase gene was significantly decreased by miR-24. These results suggest that the MRE24 in the coding region and MRE34a in the 3'-UTR are functional in the negative regulation by mRNA degradation and translational repression, respectively. The down-regulation of HNF4alpha by these microRNAs resulted in the decrease of various target genes such as cytochrome P450 7A1 and 8B1 as well as morphological changes and the decrease of the S phase population in HepG2 cells. We also clarified that the expressions of miR-24 and miR-34a were regulated by protein kinase C/mitogen-activated protein kinase and reactive oxygen species pathways, respectively. In conclusion, we found that human HNF4alpha was down-regulated by miR-24 and miR-34a, the expression of which are regulated by cellular stress, affecting the metabolism and cellular biology.
With the advent of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, it is now feasible to generate iPSCs with a defined genotype or disease state. When coupled with direct differentiation to a defined lineage, such as hepatic endoderm (HE), iPSCs would revolutionize the way we study human liver biology and generate efficient "off the shelf" models of human liver disease. Here, we show the "proof of concept" that iPSC lines representing both male and female sexes and two ethnic origins can be differentiated to HE at efficiencies of between 70%-90%, using a method mimicking physiological relevant condition. The iPSC-derived HE exhibited hepatic morphology and expressed the hepatic markers albumin and E-cadherin, as assessed by immunohistochemistry. They also expressed alpha-fetoprotein, hepatocyte nuclear factor-4a, and a metabolic marker, cytochrome P450 7A1 (Cyp7A1), demonstrating a definitive endodermal lineage differentiation. Furthermore, iPSC-derived hepatocytes produced and secreted the plasma proteins, fibrinogen, fibronectin, transthyretin, and alpha-fetoprotein, an essential feature for functional HE. Additionally iPSC-derived HE supported both CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 metabolism, which is essential for drug and toxicology testing.
This work is first to demonstrate the efficient generation of hepatic endodermal lineage from human iPSCs that exhibits key attributes of hepatocytes, and the potential application of iPSC-derived HE in studying human liver biology. In particular, iPSCs from individuals representing highly polymorphic variants in metabolic genes and different ethnic groups will provide pharmaceutical development and toxicology studies a unique opportunity to revolutionize predictive drug toxicology assays and allow the creation of in vitro hepatic disease models.
To date, the crystal structures of at least 12 human CYPs (1A2, 2A6, 2A13, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1, 2R1, 3A4, 7A1, 8A1, and 46A1) have been determined. CYP2D6 accounts for only a small percentage of all hepatic CYPs (&lt; 2%), but it metabolizes approximately 25% of clinically used drugs with significant polymorphisms. CYP2D6 also metabolizes procarcinogens and neurotoxins, such as 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline, and indolealkylamines. Moreover, the enzyme utilizes hydroxytryptamines and neurosteroids as endogenous substrates. Typical CYP2D6 substrates are usually lipophilic bases with an aromatic ring and a nitrogen atom, which can be protonated at physiological pH. Substrate binding is generally followed by oxidation (5-7 A) from the proposed nitrogen-Asp301 interaction. A number of homology models have been constructed to explore the structural features of CYP2D6, while antibody studies also provide useful structural information. Site-directed mutagenesis studies have demonstrated that Glu216, Asp301, Phe120, Phe481, and Phe483 play important roles in determining the binding of ligands to CYP2D6. The structure of human CYP2D6 has been recently determined and shows the characteristic CYP fold observed for other members of the CYP superfamily. The lengths and orientations of the individual secondary structural elements in the CYP2D6 structure are similar to those seen in other human CYP2 members, such as CYP2C9 and 2C8. The 2D6 structure has a well-defined active-site cavity located above the heme group with a volume of approximately 540 A(3), which is larger than equivalent cavities in CYP2A6 (260 A(3)), 1A2 (375 A(3)), and 2E1 (190 A(3)), but smaller than those in CYP3A4 (1385 A(3)) and 2C8 (1438 A(3)). Further studies are required to delineate the molecular mechanisms involved in CYP2D6 ligand interactions and their implications for drug development and clinical practice.
One of the central problems in biochemistry in the postgenomic era is the elucidation of functions of proteins, including "orphan" human cytochromes P450 (P450s), when the substrates are unknown. A general strategy for identification of endogenous substrates of P450s in tissue extracts using metabolomic and isotopic labeling approaches is described, involving four main steps: (1) In vitro incubation of a P450 enzyme system with cofactor and tissue extract is done under a mixture of (18)O(2)/(16)O(2) (1:1). (2) Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) assay of an organic extract of the reaction mixture is performed. (3) The isotopic labeling products appearing as M/M + 2 doublets can be directly identified using the program DoGEX (Sanchez-Ponce, R. and Guengerich, F. P. Anal. Chem. 2007, 79, 3355-3362). (4) Characterization of potential candidates is done. Validation of the strategy was established using human P450 7A1 as an initial model to identify its known product, 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol, in liver extracts. The strategy was then applied to human P450s 1A2, 2C8, and 2C9 in untargeted substrate searches with human liver extracts. A total of seven fatty acids were identified and verified as substrates of these three hepatic P450s. The products were subsequently characterized as hydroxylation and epoxidation derivatives of fatty acids, using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis. Finally, kinetic studies were performed to confirm that the fatty acids are oxidized by P450s 1A2, 2C8, and 2C9. Thus, this strategy has been demonstrated to be useful in identifying reactions in tissue extracts with orphan human P450s.
The generation of a large number of fully functional hepatocytes from a renewable cell source can provide an unlimited resource for bioartificial liver devices and cell replacement therapies. We have established a directed differentiation system using sodium butyrate treatment to generate an enriched population of hepatocyte-like cells from embryonic stem cells. A metabolic analysis of the hepatocyte populations revealed glycolytic and mitochondrial phenotypes similar to mouse hepatoma cells, implying that these cells represent an immature hepatocyte phenotype. To mediate further differentiation, S-NitrosoAcetylPenicillamine (SNAP), a nitric oxide donor, was utilized to induce mitochondrial development in the precursor populations. A comparative analysis of the different treated populations showed that 500microM SNAP treatment resulted in the generation of an enriched population of metabolically mature hepatocyte-like cells with increased differentiated function. Specifically, 500microM SNAP treatment increased glucose consumption, lactate production rates, mitochondrial mass, and potential as compared to untreated populations. In addition, functional analysis revealed that intracellular albumin content, urea secretion rates, and cytochrome P450 7a1 promoter activity were increased in the treated population. The methodology described here to generate an enriched population of metabolically and functionally mature hepatocyte-like cells may have potential implications in drug discovery and regenerative medicine.
The bile acid receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a key regulator of hepatic defense mechanisms against bile acids. A comprehensive study addressing the role of FXR in the coordinated regulation of adaptive mechanisms including biosynthesis, metabolism, and alternative export together with their functional significance is lacking. We therefore fed FXR knockout (FXR(-/-)) mice with cholic acid (CA) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Bile acid synthesis and hydroxylation were assessed by real-time RT-PCR for cytochrome P-450 (Cyp)7a1, Cyp3a11, and Cyp2b10 and mass spectrometry-gas chromatography for determination of bile acid composition. Expression of the export systems multidrug resistance proteins (Mrp)4-6 in the liver and kidney and the recently identified basoalteral bile acid transporter, organic solute transporter (Ost-alpha/Ost-beta), in the liver, kidney, and intestine was also investigated. CA and UDCA repressed Cyp7a1 in FXR(+/+) mice and to lesser extents in FXR(-/-) mice and induced Cyp3a11 and Cyp2b10 independent of FXR. CA and UDCA were hydroxylated in both genotypes. CA induced Ost-alpha/Ost-beta in the liver, kidney, and ileum in FXR(+/+) but not FXR(-/-) mice, whereas UDCA had only minor effects. Mrp4 induction in the liver and kidney correlated with bile acid levels and was observed in UDCA-fed and CA-fed FXR(-/-) animals but not in CA-fed FXR(+/+) animals. Mrp5/6 remained unaffected by bile acid treatment. In conclusion, we identified Ost-alpha/Ost-beta as a novel FXR target. Absent Ost-alpha/Ost-beta induction in CA-fed FXR(-/-) animals may contribute to increased liver injury in these animals. The induction of bile acid hydroxylation and Mrp4 was independent of FXR but could not counteract liver toxicity sufficiently. Limited effects of UDCA on Ost-alpha/Ost-beta may jeopardize its therapeutic efficacy.
Cholesterol plays an important role in cellular function and membrane compartmentalization and is involved in the interaction with more than a dozen of different proteins. Using three cholesterol-metabolizing cytochrome P450s (P450s 7A1, 46A1, and 11A1), we have developed a rapid and simple assay for measurements of nanomolar to micromolar cholesterol affinities. In this assay, the P450 is incubated with a fixed amount of radiolabeled cholesterol and varying concentrations of cold cholesterol followed by separation of free and protein-bound cholesterol via filtration through a membrane. Free cholesterol is found in the flow-through fraction, whereas P450 binds to the membrane. The radioactivity of the membranes is then measured, and a saturation curve is generated after correction for nonspecific binding of cholesterol to the filter. The validity of the filter assay was confirmed by spectral assay, a traditional method to evaluate the interaction of the P450 enzymes with their substrates. Two types of membranes, one binding positively charged proteins and another binding negatively charged proteins, were identified. These membranes were also found to hold proteins through hydrophobic interactions. Thus, the cholesterol binding properties of a wide variety of proteins could be characterized using this filter assay.
Bile acids have long been implicated in the etiology of colorectal cancer, but epidemiologic evidence remains elusive. Cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol in the liver, and thus may be an important determinant of bile acid production. We examined the association between the CYP7A1 A-203C polymorphism and colorectal cancer. The CYP7A1 A-203C polymorphism was determined by the PCR-RFLP method in 685 incident cases of colorectal cancer and 778 controls randomly selected from a community in the Fukuoka area, Japan. The CC genotype was slightly less frequent in the case group, and the adjusted odds ratio for the CC versus AA genotype was 0.88 (95% confidence interval, 0.65-1.20). In the analysis by subsite of the colorectum, a decreased risk associated with the CYP7A1 CC genotype was observed for proximal colon cancer, but not for either distal colon or rectal cancer. The adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of proximal colon cancer for the CC genotype were 0.63 (0.36-1.10) compared with the AA genotype, and 0.59 (0.37-0.96) compared with the AA and AC genotypes combined. A decreased risk of proximal colon cancer in relation to the CC genotype of CYP7A1 A-203C, which probably renders less activity of the enzyme converting cholesterol to bile acids, is new evidence for the role of bile acids in colorectal carcinogenesis.
The conversion of cholesterol to 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol catalyzed by cytochrome P450 7A1 (CYP7A1) initiates the major pathway for cholesterol elimination in mammals. In the present work we focused on identification of determinants of the CYP7A1 substrate specificity inside the active site using a homology model with a novel P450-fold, site-directed mutagenesis, and substrate-binding and kinetic studies. Forty-one mutants, encompassing twenty-six amino acid residues, were generated and characterized, and of these, seven residues appear to determine cholesterol binding in the active site. In addition, four cholesterol derivatives were used as active site probes in the wild type and the seven mutant enzymes, and the spectral binding constants and products were analyzed. It was concluded that Asn288 in the I helix plays a key role in the P450-cholesterol contacts by hydrogen bonding to the steroid 3beta-hydroxyl, while Val280 and Ala284 are beside and the Trp283 is above the steroid nucleus orienting the cholesterol molecule. Leu360 and Ala358 between the K helix and the beta1-4 strand and Leu485 in the beta4 sheet-turn appear to define the size of the active site over the heme pyrrole ring A, thus limiting the orientation and size of the substrate at the steroid A ring. Additionally, the A358V mutant was found to form two new products, one being 7beta-hydroxycholesterol. Our data indicate that a tight fit of cholesterol in the enzyme active site is in part responsible for the high efficiency of cholesterol turnover by CYP7A1.
Hepatic differentiation from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells via the formation of embryoid bodies (EBs) has been revealed by the expression of hepatocyte-related genes such as alpha-fetoprotein and albumin. It is known, however, that the visceral endoderm differentiates in early EBs and expresses these hepatocyte-related genes. Thus, it remains unclear whether ES cells are capable of differentiating into hepatocytes derived from definitive endoderm in vitro. In the present study, yolk sac tissues isolated from the foetal mouse were found to express many hepatocyte-related genes. Among the hepatocyte-related genes examined, cytochrome P450 7A1 (Cyp7a1) was identified as a liver-specific gene that was not expressed in the yolk sac. Cyp7a1 was induced in developing EBs, and hepatic differentiation was preferentially observed in the developing EBs in attached culture as compared to those in suspension culture. Leukaemia inhibitory factor permitted the differentiation of visceral endoderm, but inhibited the expression of gastrulation-related genes and the hepatic differentiation in cultured EBs. ES cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the Cyp7a1 enhancer/promoter showed that cultured EBs contained GFP-positive epithelial-like cells. These results demonstrate that ES cells can differentiate in vitro into hepatocytes derived from definitive endoderm.
Prolonged administration of peroxisome proliferators to rodents typically leads to hepatocarcinogenesis. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha) is required to mediate alterations in PPARalpha target gene expression, repress apoptosis, enhance replicative DNA synthesis, oxidative stress to DNA and hepatocarcinogenesis induced by the relatively specific PPARalpha agonist, Wy-14,643. Interestingly, administration of the less specific PPARalpha agonist, bezafibrate, leads to a modest induction of PPARalpha target genes in the absence of PPARalpha expression. In these studies, the role of PPARalpha in modulating hepatocarcinogenesis induced by long-term feeding of 0.5% bezafibrate was examined in wild-type (+/+) and PPARalpha-null (-/-) mice. The average liver weight was significantly higher in (+/+) and (-/-) mice fed bezafibrate than controls, but this effect was considerably less in (-/-) mice as compared with similarly treated (+/+) mice. Increased levels of mRNA encoding cell cycle regulatory proteins and DNA repair enzymes were found in (+/+) mice fed bezafibrate, and this effect was not found in (-/-) mice. In mice fed bezafibrate for 1 year, preneoplastic foci, adenomas and a hepatocellular carcinoma were found in (+/+) mice, while only a single microscopic adenoma was found in one (-/-) mouse. This effect was observed in both Sv/129 and C57BL/6N strains of mice, although only preneoplastic foci were observed in the latter strain. Interestingly, hepatic cholestasis was observed in 100% of the bezafibrate-fed (-/-) mice, and this was accompanied by significantly elevated hepatic expression of mRNA encoding bile salt export pump and lower expression of mRNA encoding cytochrome P450 7A1, consistent with enhanced activation of the bile acid receptor, farnesoid X receptor. Results from these studies demonstrate that the PPARalpha is required to mediate hepatocarcinogenesis induced by bezafibrate, and that PPARalpha protects against potential cholestasis.
High plasma cholesterol is one of the risk factors of atherosclerosis. Both environmental (diet, physic activity) and genetic factors have been concerned in the development of hypercholesterolemia. Cholesterol 7 alpha hydroxylase (CYP-7A1) is a key enzyme in the bile acid synthesis and it plays an important role in cholesterol catabolism. The aim of the study was to establish the role of A-204--&gt;C polymorphism in CYP-7A1 gene in plasma lipid determination in children.
Using PCR and restriction analysis (BsaI) we have measured A-204--&gt;C polymorphism in CYP-7A1 gene in two groups of children selected from opposite ends of the cholesterol distribution curve of 2000 children. Eighty-two children in high- (HCG) and eighty-six children in low- (LCG) cholesterolemic groups participated in the study. No significant difference was found in the frequencies of the genotypes or alleles of the A-204--&gt;C polymorphism in the CYP-7A1 gene between HCG and LCG. In HCG, C/C-204 homozygotes have the highest and A/A homozygotes the lowest levels of LDL-cholesterol (4.21 +/- 0.68 mmol/l vers. 3.69 +/- 0.60 mmol/l, p &lt; 0.05). No associations between lipid parameters and genotypes within the LCG group were found.
The A-204--&gt;C polymorphism in the gene for CYP-7A1 is not the major determinant of plasma lipid levels in childhood. Its impact is expressed only on high cholesterol background.
To evaluate the influence of variation in the genes for apolipoprotein E (APOE; epsilon2, epsilon3, epsilon4) and cholesterol-7alpha hydroxylase (CYP-7A1; -204A--&gt;C) on plasma lipid level changes.
131 males for whom dietary composition markedly changed and total cholesterol decreased (from 6.21 +/- 1.31 mmol/L in 1988 - 5.43 +/- 1.06 mmol/L in 1996) over an 8 yr follow-up study. Polymorphisms were investigated using PCR.
APOE genotype influenced plasma total and LDL cholesterol, with carriers of the epsilon4 having the highest and epsilon2 carriers the lowest levels, this reached borderline significance for cholesterol in 1988 (p = 0.06) and strongly affected the 1996 levels of LDL cholesterol (p = 0.008). However, APOE did not influence the change in these measures over time. In contrast, the CYP-7A1 -204A--&gt;C polymorphism did not affect lipid measures per se but was strongly associated with a decrease in plasma total cholesterol [AA -0.38 (+/- 0.20) mmol/L, AC -0.65 +/- (0.08), CC -1.33 (+/- 0.3) mmol/L, p = 0.01] over the 8 yr time period.
Variation in the CYP-7A1 gene may play an important role in an individual's sensitivity to dietary composition.
The developmental variation of cytochrome P450 (CYP)7A1, CYP7B1, CYP27A1, and 3beta-hydroxy-Delta(5)-C(27)-steroid dehydrogenase, key enzymes in bile acid biosynthesis, were investigated in pigs of different ages. As part of these studies, peptide sequences from a purified pig liver oxysterol 7alpha-hydroxylase were analyzed. The sequences showed a high degree of identity with those of murine and human CYP7B1. Enzymatic activities and mRNA levels of CYP27A1 and 3beta-hydroxy-Delta(5)-C(27)-steroid dehydrogenase were similar in livers of newborn and 6-month-old pigs. Enzymatic activity mediated by CYP7A1 increased several-fold between infancy and adolescence. Hepatic CYP7A1 and CYP7B1 mRNA levels increased several-fold with age. Hepatic microsomal 7alpha-hydroxylation of 27-hydroxycholesterol and dehydroepiandrosterone, substrates typical for CYP7B1, increased about 5-fold between infancy and adolescence whereas the activities in kidney microsomes decreased at least 10-fold. In conclusion, the results indicate that the expression of CYP27A1 and 3beta-hydroxy-Delta(5)-C(27)-steroid dehydrogenase are similar in livers of newborn and 6-month-old pigs whereas the levels of CYP7A1 increase. The finding that the levels of CYP7B1 increase with age in the liver but decrease in the kidney suggest a tissue-specific developmental regulation of CYP7B1. The age-dependent variation in the liver and kidney suggests that hormonal factors are involved in the regulation of CYP7B1.
To study membrane topology and mechanism for substrate specificity, we truncated residues 2-24 in microsomal cytochrome P450 7A1 (P450 7A1) and introduced conservative and nonconservative substitutions at positions 214-227. Heterologous expression in Escherichia coli was followed by investigation of the subcellular distribution of the mutant P450s and determination of the kinetic and substrate binding parameters for cholesterol. The results indicate that a hydrophobic region, comprising residues 214-227, forms a secondary site of attachment to the membrane in P450 7A1 in addition to the NH(2)-terminal signal-anchor sequence. There are two groups of residues at this enzyme-membrane interface. The first are those whose mutation results in more cytosolic P450 (Val-214, His-225, and Met-226). The second group are those whose mutation leads to more membrane-bound P450 (Phe-215, Leu-218, Ile-224, and Phe-227). In addition, the V214A, V214L, V214T, F215A, F215L, F215Y, L218I, L218V, V219T, and M226A mutants showed a 5-12-fold increased K(m) for cholesterol. The k(cat) of the V214A, V214L, V219T, and M226A mutants was increased up to 1.8-fold, and that of the V214T, F215A, F215L, F215Y, L218I, and L218V mutants was decreased 3-10.5-fold. Based on analysis of these mutations we suggest that cholesterol enters P450 7A1 through the membrane, and Val-214, Phe-215, and Leu-218 are the residues located near the point of cholesterol entry. The results provide an understanding of both the P450 7A1-membrane interactions and the mechanism for substrate specificity.
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to be a leading cause of death worldwide. Elevated serum cholesterol is one of the classical risk factors for CVD, which also include age, hypertension, smoking, diabetes mellitus, obesity and family history. Several therapeutic drug classes have been developed to treat hypercholesterolemia; yet, an important percentage of patients do not reach their treatment goals. Therefore, new cholesterol-lowering medications that have sites of action different from that of drugs available at present need to be developed. This review summarizes new information about cytochrome P450 enzymes 7A1, 27A1 and 46A1. These enzymes play key roles in cholesterol elimination and have the potential to serve as targets for cholesterol-lowering.
There is a critical need for new sources of hepatocytes, both clinically to provide support for patients with liver failure and in drug discovery for toxicity, metabolic and pharmacokinetic screening of new drug entities. We have reported previously a variety of methods for differentiating murine embryonic stem (ES) cells into hepatocyte-like cells. One major challenge of our work and others in the field has been the ability to selectively purify and enrich these cells from a heterogeneous population. Traditional approaches for inserting new genes (e.g., stable transfection, knock-in, retroviral transduction) involve permanent alterations in the genome. These approaches can lead to mutations and involve the extra costs and time of developing, validating and maintaining new cell lines. We have developed a transient gene delivery system that uses fluorescent gene reporters for purification of the cells. Following a transient transfection, the cells are purified through a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS), re-plated in secondary culture and subsequent phenotypic analysis is performed. In an effort to test the ability of the reporters to work in a transient environment for our differentiation system, we engineered two non-viral plasmid reporters, the first driven by the mouse albumin enhancer/promoter and the second by the mouse cytochrome P450 7A1 (Cyp7A1) promoter. We optimized the transfection efficiency of delivering these genes into spontaneously differentiated ES cells and sorted independent fractions positive for each reporter 17 days after inducing differentiation. We found that cells sorted based on the Cyp7A1 promoter showed significant enrichment in terms of albumin secretion, urea secretion and cytochrome P450 1A2 detoxification activity as compared to enrichment garnered by the albumin promoter-based cell sort. Development of gene reporter systems that allow us to identify, purify and assess homogeneous populations of cells is important in better understanding stem cell differentiation pathways. And engineering cellular systems without making permanent gene changes will be critical for the generation of clinically acceptable cellular material in the future.
Premature ovarian failure (POF) is characterized by hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and amenorrhea before the age of 40. The condition has a heterogeneous background but genetic factors are demonstrated by the occurrence of familial cases. We identified a mother and daughter with POF both of whom carry an X;autosome translocation [t(X;11)(q24;q13)]. RNA expression studies of genes flanking the X-chromosome breakpoint revealed that both patients have reduced expression levels of the gene Progesterone Receptor Membrane Component-1 (PGRMC1). Mutation screening of 67 females with idiopathic POF identified a third patient with a missense mutation (H165R) located in the cytochrome b5 domain of PGRMC1. PGRMC1 mediates the anti-apoptotic action of progesterone in ovarian cells and it acts as a positive regulator of several cytochrome P450 (CYP)-catalyzed reactions. The CYPs are critical for intracellular sterol metabolism, including biosynthesis of steroid hormones. We show that the H165R mutation associated with POF abolishes the binding of cytochrome P450 7A1 (CYP7A1) to PGRMC1. In addition, the missense mutation attenuates PGRMC1's ability to mediate the anti-apoptotic action of progesterone in ovarian cells. These findings suggest that mutant or reduced levels of PGMRC1 may cause POF through impaired activation of the microsomal cytochrome P450 and increased apoptosis of ovarian cells.
To identify candidate genes in relation to plasma lipid levels in Caribbean Hispanics.
A total of 114 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 17 lipid-related genes were genotyped in 477 Caribbean Hispanics from the Northern Manhattan Study (NOMAS). Analyses for each SNP and haplotype were performed to evaluate the associations with four lipid traits: high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C, LDL-C), triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC).
We identified 19 SNPs at 10 genes that were significantly related to lipids (p&lt;0.01), including nine involved in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway, and one involved in bile acid synthesis. Three genes, namely the apolipoprotein A5, apolipoprotein B and cytochrome p450 polypeptide 7A1 genes, accounted for the largest proportion of variation in HDL-C/TG, TC and LDL-C respectively.
The cumulative effects of multiple genetic variants led to a substantially better prediction of inter-individual variations in lipid levels.
The intrahepatic bile duct has been suggested to be a source of hepatic progenitor cells in the severely damaged liver. In contrast, little attention has been paid to the question of whether hepatic progenitor cells exist in the extrahepatic bile duct (EHBD). In the present study, we examined the phenotypic changes of the mouse EHBD following bile duct ligation. After bile duct ligation, the number of c-Kit-positive epithelial cells increased in the EHBD. The ligated EHBD expressed mRNA for hepatic progenitor cell markers, including c-Kit and Thy-1. Hepatocyte markers such as albumin and cytochrome P450 7a1 were also transiently detected in the EHBD after a bile duct ligation. In a culture of EHBD cells, we detected hepatic progenitor cells that were positive for both staining with anti-albumin antibodies and Dolichos biflorus agglutinin, a biliary epithelial cell-specific lectin. Furthermore, hepatic progenitor cells positive for both c-Kit and albumin were found in the cultured EHBD population. Additionally EHBD-derived hepatocyte-like cells were also observed in the culture. A transplantation study revealed that EHBD cells integrate into the parenchyma and are albumin positive. These data suggest that hepatic progenitor cells emerge in the EHBD following bile duct ligation, that subsequently give rise to hepatocyte-like cells. We also observed that the gall bladder transiently expressed hepatocyte markers after bile duct ligation. Our results suggest a potential of the EHBD and gall bladder as useful transplantable sources for liver injury.
To explore whether a co-culture of cynomolgus monkey embryonic stem (cES) cells with embryonic liver cells could promote their differentiation into hepatocytes.
Mouse fetal liver-derived cells (MFLCs) were prepared as adherent cells from mouse embryos on embryonic d (ED) 14, after which undifferentiated cES cells were co-cultured with MFLCs. The induction of cES cells along a hepatic lineage was examined in MFLC-assisted differentiation, spontaneous differentiation, and growth factors (GF) and chemicals-induced differentiations (GF-induced differentiation) using retinoic acid, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), FGF2, FGF4, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), oncostatin M (OSM), and dexamethasone.
The mRNA expression of alpha-fetoprotein, albumin (ALB), alpha-1-antitrypsin, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha was observed earlier in the differentiating cES cells co-cultured with MFLCs, as compared to cES cells undergoing spontaneous differentiation and those subjected to GF-induced differentiation. The expression of cytochrome P450 7a1, a possible marker for embryonic endoderm-derived mature hepatocytes, was only observed in cES cells that had differentiated in a co-culture with MFLCs. Further, the disappearance of Oct3/4, a representative marker of an undifferentiated state, was noted in cells co-cultured with MFLCs, but not in those undergoing spontaneous or GF-induced differentiation. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed an increased ratio of ALB-immunopositive cells among cES cells co-cultured with MFLCs, while glycogen storage and urea synthesis were also demonstrated.
MFLCs showed an ability to induce cES cells to differentiate toward hepatocytes. The co-culture system with MFLCs is a useful method for induction of hepatocyte-like cells from undifferentiated cES cells.
Differences in ethanol metabolizing enzymes expressed in brain have been suggested to contribute to the significant differences in ethanol (alcohol) preference between inbred C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mouse strains.
We have utilized 2 different platforms of oligonucleotide microarray technology (CodeLink UniSet I BioArray from G.E. Healthcare and MG U74A v2.0 from Affymetrix) to simultaneously assess expression of alcohol and acetaldehyde metabolizing enzymes in the whole brain of naïve (no exposure to alcohol) C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mice.
There were no significant differences between the 2 strains of mice in gene expression intensity for alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH), catalase, and a number of the cytochrome P450 family of genes, which can be involved in ethanol catabolism. However, significantly higher expression of mRNA for aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), an isoform mainly responsible for the catabolism of acetaldehyde, was observed in whole brains of DBA/2 mice with both platforms. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 protein was also higher in DBA/2 brain. Expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1) mRNA was found to be higher in brains of DBA/2 mice, when measured with the CodeLink platform, but not when measured with Affymetrix arrays or quantitative reverse transcriptase-real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The ALDH1A1 protein, however, reflected the results obtained with the CodeLink arrays and was higher in DBA/2 brain, compared with brains of C57BL/6 mice. In contrast, the expression intensity for the aldehyde dehydrogenase 7A1 (ALDH7A1) mRNA and protein was significantly higher in C57BL/6 mice than DBA/2 mice. These expression differences are consistent with more rapid metabolism of acetaldehyde in brains of DBA/2 mice.
The use of 2 different microarray platforms provides important cross-validation of many results, and some discrepancies can be resolved with qRT-PCR and immunoblotting. The expression differences that were validated may affect alcohol/aldehyde metabolism in brain and/or alcohol preference in the 2 strains of mice.
Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have enormous potential as a source of cells for cell replacement therapies and as a model for early human development. In this study we examined the differentiating potential of hESCs into hepatocytes in two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) culture systems. Embryoid bodies (EBs) were inserted into a collagen scaffold 3D culture system or cultured on collagen-coated dishes and stimulated with exogenous growth factors to induce hepatic histogenesis. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed the expression of albumin (ALB) and cytokeratin-18 (CK-18). The differentiated cells in 2D and 3D culture system displayed several characteristics of hepatocytes, including expression of transthyretin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, cytokeratin 8, 18, 19, tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase, tyrosine aminotransferase, glucose-6-phosphatase (G6P), cytochrome P450 subunits 7a1 and secretion of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and ALB and production of urea. In 3D culture, ALB and G6P were detected earlier and higher levels of urea and AFP were produced, when compared with 2D culture. Electron microscopy of differentiated hESCs showed hepatocyte-like ultrastructure, including glycogon granules, well-developed Golgi apparatuses, rough and smooth endoplasmic reticuli and intercellular canaliculi. The differentiation of hESCs into hepatocyte-like cells within 3D collagen scaffolds containing exogenous growth factors, gives rise to cells displaying morphological features, gene expression patterns and metabolic activities characteristic of hepatocytes and may provide a source of differentiated cells for treatment of liver diseases.
By participating in pathways of cholesterol biosynthesis and elimination, different cytochrome P450 (P450 or CYP) enzymes play an important role in maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis. CYP51 is involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, whereas CYP 7A1, 27A1, 46A1, 7B1, 39A1, and 8B1 are the key enzymes in cholesterol catabolism to bile acids, the major route of cholesterol elimination in mammals. Cholesterol transformations to steroid hormones are also initiated by the P450 enzyme CYP11A1. Finally, one of the major drug-metabolizing P450s CYP3A4 seems to contribute to bile acid biosynthesis as well. The 9 P450s will be the focus of this review and assessed as drug targets for cholesterol lowering.
3alpha-6alpha-Dihydroxy-7alpha-fluoro-5beta-cholanoate (UPF-680), the 7alpha-fluorine analog of hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA), was synthesized to improve bioavailability and stability of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Acute rat biliary fistula and chronic cholestasis induced by 17alpha-ethynyl-estradiol (17EE) models were used to study and compare the effects of UPF-680 (dose range 0.6-6.0 micromol/kg min) with UDCA on bile flow, biliary bicarbonate (HCO(3)(-)), lipid output, biliary bile acid composition, hepatic enzymes and organic anion pumps. In acute infusion, UPF-680 increased bile flow in a dose-related manner, by up to 40.9%. Biliary HCO(3)(-) output was similarly increased. Changes were observed in phospholipid secretion only at the highest doses. Treatment with UDCA and UPF-680 reversed chronic cholestasis induced by 17EE; in this model, UDCA had no effect on bile flow in contrast to UPF-680, which significantly increased bile flow. With acute administration of UPF-680, the biliary bile acid pool became enriched with unconjugated and conjugated UPF-680 (71.7%) at the expense of endogenous cholic acid and muricholic isomers. With chronic administration of UPF-680 or UDCA, the main biliary bile acids were tauro conjugates, but modification of biliary bile acid pool was greater with UPF-680. UPF-680 increased the mRNA for cytochrome P450 7A1 (CYP7A1) and cytochrome P450 8B (CYP8B). Both UDCA and UPF-680 increased the mRNA for Na(+) taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NCTP). In conclusion, UPF-680 prevented 17EE-induced cholestasis and enriched the biliary bile acid pool with less detergent and cytotoxic bile acids. This novel fluorinated bile acid may have potential in the treatment of cholestatic liver disease.
By catalyzing the first steps in different pathways of cholesterol degradation, cytochromes P450 (P450s) 7A1, 27A1, 11A1, and 46A1 play key roles in cholesterol homeostasis. CYP7A1 is a microsomal liver-specific enzyme that converts cholesterol to 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol. CYP27A1 is a ubiquitously expressed mitochondrial P450 that metabolizes cholesterol to 27-hydroxycholesterol. CYP11A1 also resides in mitochondria but is expressed mainly in steroidogenic tissues, where it catalyzes the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone. Finally, CYP46A1 is a brain-selective microsomal monooxygenase producing 24S-hydroxycholesterol from cholesterol. Catalytic efficiencies of cholesterol-metabolizing P450s vary significantly and probably reflect physiological requirements of different organs for the rate of cholesterol turnover. P450s 7A1, 27A1, 11A1, and 46A1 represent a unique system for elucidation of how different enzymes have adapted to fit their specific roles in cholesterol elimination. Studies of cholesterol-metabolizing P450s suggest that their activities could be modulated post-translationally and that they should also be considered as targets for regulation of cholesterol homeostasis.
Zucker fa/fa rats easily develop dyslipidemia and obesity. Restructured pork (RP) is a suitable matrix for including functional ingredients. The effects of glucomannan- RP or glucomannan plus spirulina-enriched RP on plasma lipid/lipoprotein levels, cytochrome P450 7A1 (CYP7A1) expression, and arylesterase activity in growing fa/fa rats fed high-energy, high-fat cholesterol-enriched diets were tested. Groups of six rats each received diet containing 15% control-RP (C), 15% glucomannan-RP diet (G), 15% glucomannan + spirulina-RP diet (GS), and same diets enriched with 2.4% cholesterol and 0.49% cholic acid (cholesterol-enriched control (HC), cholesterol-enriched glucomannan (HG), and cholesterol-enriched glucomannan + spirulina (HGS) diets) over a 7-week period. C diet induced obesity, severe hyperglycemia, moderate hypercholesterolemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. Those facts were not significantly modified by G or GS diets. G diet increased CYP7A1 expression but decreased the total cholesterol/high density lipoproteins (HDL)-cholesterol ratio (p &lt; 0.05) vs. C diet. GS vs. G diet increased (p &lt; 0.05) CYP7A1 expression. HC vs. C diet reduced food intake, body weight gain, and plasma glucose (p &lt; 0.01) but increased cholesterolemia (p &lt; 0.01), lipidemia (plasma cholesterol plus triglycerides) (p &lt; 0.001), cholesterol/triglyceride ratio in very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), and HDL (p &lt; 0.05), cholesterol transported by VLDL and intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL) + low density lipoproteins (LDL), total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio and CYP7A1 expression (at least p &lt; 0.05). HG and HGS diets vs. HC noticeably reduced lipidemia (p &lt; 0.001), normalized VLDL and IDL + LDL lipid composition, and increased CYP7A1 expression (p &lt; 0.01) but did not modify the cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio. HGS vs. HG decreased triglyceridemia, the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index and increased arylesterase/HDL-cholesterol activity (p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, G- and GS-RP act as functional foods and notably blocked the dietary cholesterol effects. In addition, HGS-RP improved the glucomannan hypolipidemic effects, increased arylesterase/HDL-cholesterol activity, and decreased insulin resistance.
Cholestasis, including primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), results from an impairment or disruption of bile production and causes intracellular retention of toxic bile constituents, including bile salts. If left untreated, cholestasis leads to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, which eventually results in liver failure and the need for liver transplantation. Currently, the only therapeutic option available for these patients is ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), which slows the progression of PBC, particularly in stage I and II of the disease. However, some patients have an incomplete response to UDCA therapy, whereas other, more advanced cases often remain unresponsive. For PSC, UDCA therapy does not improve survival, and recommendations for its use remain controversial. These considerations emphasize the need for alternative therapies. Hepatic transporters, located along basolateral (sinusoidal) and apical (canalicular) membranes of hepatocytes, are integral determinants of bile formation and secretion. Nuclear receptors (NRs) are critically involved in the regulation of these hepatic transporters and are natural targets for therapy of cholestatic liver diseases. One of these NRs is peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), which plays a central role in maintaining cholesterol, lipid, and bile acid homeostasis by regulating genes responsible for bile acid synthesis and transport in humans, including cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoform 7A1 (CYP7A1), CYP27A1, CYP8B1, uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 1A6, hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase enzyme 2A1, multidrug resistance protein 3, and apical sodium-dependent bile salt transporter. Expression of many of these genes is altered in cholestatic liver diseases, but few have been extensively studied or had the mechanism of PPARα effect identified. In this review, we examine what is known about these mechanisms and consider the rationale for the use of PPARα ligand therapy, such as fenofibrate, in various cholestatic liver disorders.
A new mechanism for formation of 7-ketocholesterol was recently described involving cytochrome P-450 (CYP)7A1-catalyzed conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol into 7-ketocholesterol with cholesterol-7,8-epoxide as a side product. Some patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) and all patients with Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLO) have markedly increased levels of 7-dehydrocholesterol in plasma and tissues. In addition, the former patients have markedly upregulated CYP7A1. We hypothesized that these patients may produce 7-ketocholesterol from 7-dehydrocholesterol with formation of cholesterol-7,8-epoxide as a side product. In accord with this hypothesis, two patients with CTX were found to have increased levels of 7-ketocholesterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol, as well as a significant level of cholesterol-7,8-epoxide. The latter steroid was not detectable in plasma from healthy volunteers. Downregulation of CYP7A1 activity by treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid reduced the levels of 7-ketocholesterol in parallel with decreased levels of 7-dehydrocholesterol and cholesterol-7,8-epoxide. Three patients with SLO were found to have markedly elevated levels of 7-ketocholesterol as well as high levels of cholesterol-7,8-epoxide. The results support the hypothesis that 7-dehydrocholesterol is a precursor to 7-ketocholesterol in SLO and some patients with CTX.
The effect of high-fat squid-surimi diets enriched in glucomannan or glucomannan-spirulina on lipemia, liver glutathione status, antioxidant enzymes and inflammation biomarkers was determined in Zucker Fa/Fa rats. Groups of eight rats each received for 7weeks the squid-surimi control (C), glucomannan-enriched squid-surimi (G) and glucomannan-spirulina enriched squid-surimi (GS). Liver weight, cytochrome P450 7A1 expression and cholesterolemia were decreased in G and GS vs. C, improving glutathione red-ox index (p&lt;0.05). G also showed increased glutathione reductase (GR) levels vs. C, but reduced the endothelial (eNOS) and increased the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels (p&lt;0.05). The GS diet improved superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and GR activities and eNOS, iNOS and TNF-α levels (p&lt;0.05). The glucomannan enriched surimi-diet induced hypocholesterolemic, antioxidant and proinflammatory effects, while the addition of 3g/kg spirulina kept those hypocholesterolemic and antioxidant effects but reduced the inflammation observed. 
Altered lipid metabolism has been shown in fish fed plant protein sources. The present study aimed to gain further insights into how intestinal and hepatic lipid absorption and metabolism are modulated by plant meal (PM) and soya-saponin (SA) inclusion in salmon feed. Post-smolt Atlantic salmon were fed for 10 weeks one of four diets based on fishmeal or PM, with or without 10 g/kg SA. PM inclusion resulted in decreased growth performance, excessive lipid droplet accumulation in the pyloric caeca and liver, and reduced plasma cholesterol levels. Intestinal and hepatic gene expression profiling revealed an up-regulation of the expression of genes involved in lipid absorption and lipoprotein (LP) synthesis (apo, fatty acid transporters, microsomal TAG transfer protein, acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase, choline kinase and choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase A), cholesterol synthesis (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase) and associated transcription factors (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 and PPARγ). SA inclusion resulted in reduced body pools of cholesterol and bile salts. The hepatic gene expression of the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid biosynthesis (cytochrome P450 7A1 (cyp7a1)) as well as the transcription factor liver X receptor and the bile acid transporter abcb11 (ATP-binding cassette B11) was down-regulated by SA inclusion. A significant interaction was observed between PM inclusion and SA inclusion for plasma cholesterol levels. In conclusion, gene expression profiling suggested that the capacity for LP assembly and cholesterol synthesis was up-regulated by PM exposure, probably as a compensatory mechanism for excessive lipid droplet accumulation and reduced plasma cholesterol levels. SA inclusion had hypocholesterolaemic effects on Atlantic salmon, accompanied by decreased bile salt metabolism.
We compared the effects of three persimmon cultivars, one nonastringent-type fruit (Fuyu) and two astringent-type fruits (Hiratanenashi and Hachiya), on the lipid and glucose metabolism of high-fat diet-fed mice. Persimmon samples prepared from young fruits of the three cultivars contained around 80% dietary fiber and differed in their bile acid-binding abilities and tannin contents. C57BL/6J mice were fed a modified AIN76 high-fat diet supplemented with 2% of each persimmon sample instead of cellulose for 10 wk. All cultivars significantly accelerated fecal bile acid secretion, depending on the bile acid-binding ability of the cultivars. Hiratanenashi and Hachiya, the cultivars with a strong bile acid-binding ability, prevented any increase in fasting blood glucose and plasma nonesterified fatty acid levels. Hachiya, the cultivar with the highest tannin content, also tended to prevent an increase in plasma non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. However, Fuyu, the cultivar with the lowest bile acid-binding ability and tannin content, had no effect on lipid or glucose metabolism. These effects linked to expression of the genes related to lipid and energy metabolism, including the cytochrome P450 7A1 gene in the liver and the uncoupling protein 3 gene in the brown adipose tissue. These results indicate that the beneficial effects of these cultivars on lipid and glucose metabolism are closely related to their bile acid-binding ability and tannin content. 
An extract from red ginseng (steamed and dried roots of Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer; RGE) has been shown to promote cholesterol metabolism in the liver. We have reported that RGE induced the hepatic expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP)7A1, involved in cholesterol metabolism. Other cholesterol metabolism-related proteins, such as CYP8B1, CYP27A1, multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP)2, MRP3, and Na(+) taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), are involved in cholesterol metabolism. The purpose of this study was to clarify whether RGE affected mRNA expression of cholesterol metabolism-related CYPs and transporters in the liver of hypercholesterolemic rats and rat primary hepatocytes. In-vivo studies showed little differences in CYP8B1, CYP27A1, MRP2, MRP3, and NTCP mRNA expression levels between hypercholesterolemic rats with or without RGE treatments. However, the disruption of the membrane localization of MRP2 was suppressed by RGE treatments in hypercholesterolemic rats. In-vitro studies using rat primary hepatocytes showed upregulation of CYP8B1 and MRP2 mRNA by the addition of RGE (100 and 500 μg/mL). We further examined which ginsenosides contributed to the upregulation of CYP8B1 and MRP2 mRNA levels. Ginsenoside Re enhanced the mRNA level of CYP8B1, whereas ginsenosides Rb2 and Rg2 enhanced MRP2 mRNA levels. These results suggest that the in-vitro exposure of hepatocytes to RGE or some ginsenosides could lead to upregulation of CYP8B1 and MRP2, resulting in the alteration of biosynthesis and disposition of bile acids. 
Whether or not alkaline reduced water (ARW) has a positive effect on obesity is unclear. This study aims to prove the positive effect of ARW in high-fat (HF) diet-induced obesity (DIO) in C57BL/6 mice model. Toward this, obesity was induced by feeding the C57BL/6 male mice with high-fat diet (w/w 45% fat) for 12 weeks. Thereafter, the animals were administered with either ARW or tap water. Next, the degree of adiposity and DIO-associated parameters were assessed: clinico-pathological parameters, biochemical measurements, histopathological analysis of liver, the expression of cholesterol metabolism-related genes in the liver, and serum levels of adipokine and cytokine. We found that ARW-fed mice significantly ameliorated adiposity: controlled body weight gain, reduced the accumulation of epididymal fats and decreased liver fats as compared to control mice. Accordingly, ARW coordinated the level of adiponectin and leptin. Further, mRNA expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP)7A1 was upregulated. In summary, our data shows that ARW intake inhibits the progression of HF-DIO in mice. This is the first note on anti-obesity effect of ARW, clinically implying the safer fluid remedy for obesity control. 
Diets with low omega (ω)-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) plus docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) ratios have been shown to decrease aortic cholesterol accumulation and have been suggested to promote weight loss. The involvement of the liver and gonadal adipose tissue (GAT) in mediating these effects is not well understood. LDL receptor null mice were used to assess the effect of an atherogenic diet with different ω-6:EPA+DHA ratios on weight gain, hepatic and GAT lipid accumulation, and their relationship to atherosclerosis.
Four groups of mice were fed a high saturated fat and cholesterol diet (HSF ω-6) alone, or with ω-6 PUFA to EPA+DHA ratios up to 1:1 for 32 weeks. Liver and GAT were collected for lipid and gene expression analysis.
The fatty acid profile of liver and GAT reflected the diets. All diets resulted in similar weight gains. Compared to HSF ω-6 diet, the 1:1 ratio diet resulted in lower hepatic total cholesterol (TC) content. Aortic TC was positively correlated with hepatic and GAT TC and triglyceride. These differences were accompanied by significantly lower expression of CD36, ATP-transporter cassette A1, scavenger receptor B class 1, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha, acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 5, and stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD1) in GAT, and HMGCR, SCD1 and cytochrome P450 7A1 in liver.
Dietary ω-6:EPA+DHA ratios did not affect body weight, but lower ω-6:EPA+DHA ratio diets decreased liver lipid accumulation, which possibly contributed to the lower aortic cholesterol accumulation.
We evaluated the effect of chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) seed extract (CI) on hepatic steatosis caused by early and late stage diabetes in rats (in vivo), and induced in HepG2 cells (in vitro) by BSA-oleic acid complex (OA). Different dosages of CI (1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg/ml) were applied along with OA (1 mM) to HepG2 cells, simultaneously and non-simultaneously; and without OA to ordinary non-steatotic cells. Cellular lipid accumulation and glycerol release, and hepatic triglyceride (TG) content were measured. The expression levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) were determined. Liver samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E). Significant histological damage (steatosis-inflammation-fibrosis) to the cells and tissues and down-regulation of SREBP-1c and PPARα genes that followed steatosis induction were prevented by CI in simultaneous treatment. In non-simultaneous treatment, CI up-regulated the expression of both genes and restored the normal levels of the corresponding proteins; with a greater stimulating effect on PPARα, CI acted as a PPARα agonist. CI released glycerol from HepG2 cells, and targeted the first and the second hit phases of hepatic steatosis. A preliminary attempt to characterize CI showed caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and chicoric acid, among the constituents.
In recent years, the advantages of menstrual blood-derived stem cells (MenSCs), such as minimal ethical considerations, easy access and high proliferative ability, have inspired scientists to investigate the potential of MenSCs in cell therapy of different diseases. In order to characterize the potency of these cells for future cell therapy of liver diseases, we examined the potential of MenSCs to differentiate into hepatocytes, using different protocols. First, the immunophenotyping properties and potential of MenSCs to differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondrocytes were evaluated. Thereafter, the differentiation protocols developed by two concentrations of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and oncostatin M (OSM), in combination with other components in serum-supplemented or serum-free culture media, were also investigated. The sequential differentiation was monitored by real-time PCR, immunostaining and functional assays. Our primary data revealed that the isolated MenSCs exhibited mesenchymal stem cell markers in parallel to OCT-4 as an embryonic marker. Regardless of differentiation procedures, the developed cells expressed mature hepatocyte markers, such as albumin, tyrosine aminotransferase and cytokeratin-18 at the mRNA and protein levels. They also showed functional properties of hepatocytes, including albumin secretion, glycogen storage and cytochrome P450 7A1 expression. However, the degree of differentiation was dependent on the concentrations of HGF and OSM. Indeed, omission of serum during the differentiation process caused typical improvement in hepatocyte-specific functions. This study is a novel report demonstrating the differentiation potential of MenSCs into hepatocyte-like cells. We recommend a complementary serum-free differentiation protocol for enrichment of in vitro production of functional MenSC-derived hepatocyte-like cells that could lead to a major step toward applied stem cell therapy of chronic liver diseases.
The functionality of primary rat hepatocytes was assessed in an Integrated Dynamic Cell Cultures in Microsystem (IDCCM) device. We characterized the hepatocytes over 96 h of culture and evaluated the impact of dynamic cell culture on their viability, inducibility, and metabolic activity. Reverse Transcription quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RTqPCR) was performed on selected genes: liver transcription factors (HNF4α and CEBP), nuclear receptors sensitive to xenobiotics (AhR, PXR, CAR, and FXR), cytochromes P450 (CYPs) (1A2, 3A2, 3A23/3A1, 7A1, 2B1, 2C6, 2C, 2D1, 2D2, and 2E1), phase II metabolism enzymes (GSTA2, SULT1A1, and UGT1A6), ABC transporters (ABCB1b and ABCC2), and oxidative stress related enzymes (HMOX1 and NQO1). Microperfused-cultured hepatocytes remained viable and differentiated with in vivo-like phenotype and genotype. In contrast with postadhesion gene levels, the first 48 h of perfusion enhanced the expression of xenosensors and their target CYPs. Furthermore, CYP3A1, CYP2B1, GSTA2, SULT1A1, UGT1A1, ABCB1b, and ABCC2 were upregulated in IDCCM and reached above postextraction levels all along the duration of culture. Metabolic activities were also confirmed with the detection of metabolism rate and induced mRNAs after exposure to several inducers: 3-methylcholanthrene, caffeine, phenacetin, paracetamol,, and midazolam. Finally, this metabolic characterization confirms that IDCCM is able to maintain rat hepatocytes functions to investigate drug metabolism.
The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)α is known primarily as a regulator of fatty acid metabolism, energy balance, and inflammation, but evidence suggests a wider role in regulating the biotransformation of drugs and other lipophilic chemicals. We investigated whether PPARα directly regulates the transcription of cytochrome P450 3A4, the major human drug-metabolizing enzyme. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation in human primary hepatocytes as well as electrophoretic mobility shift and luciferase reporter-gene assays, we identified three functional PPARα-binding regions (PBR-I, -II, and -III) within ∼12 kb of the CYP3A4 upstream sequence. Furthermore, a humanized CYP3A4/3A7 mouse model showed in vivo induction of CYP3A4 mRNA and protein by [4-chloro-6-(2,3-xylidino)-2-pyrimidinylthio]acetic acid (WY14,643) in liver but not in intestine, whereas hepatic occupancy of PBRs by PPARα was ligand independent. Using lentiviral gene knock-down and treatment with WY14,643 in primary human hepatocytes, PPARα was further shown to affect the expression of a distinct set of CYPs, including 1A1, 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 3A4, and 7A1, but not 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 2E1. Interestingly, the common phospholipid 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine (16:0/18:1-PC), previously proposed to reflect nutritional status and shown to be a specific endogenous ligand of PPARα, induced CYP3A4 (up to 4-fold) and other biotransformation genes in hepatocytes with similar selectivity and potency as WY14,643. These data establish PPARα as a direct transcriptional regulator of hepatic CYP3A4. This finding warrants investigation of both known and newly developed PPARα-targeted drugs for their drug-drug interaction potential. Furthermore, our data suggest that nutritional status can influence drug biotransformation capacity via endogenous phospholipid signaling.
Obesity is associated with increased systemic and airway oxidative stress, which may result from a combination of adipokine imbalance and antioxidant defenses reduction. Obesity-mediated oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of dyslipidemia, vascular disease, and nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis. The antidyslipidemic activity of pigeon pea were evaluated by high-fat diet (HFD) hamsters model, in which the level of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), and total triglyceride (TG) were examined. We found that pigeon pea administration promoted cholesterol converting to bile acid in HFD-induced hamsters, thereby exerting hypolipidemic activity. In the statistical results, pigeon pea significantly increased hepatic carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1), LDL receptor, and cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (also known as cytochrome P450 7A1, CYP7A1) expression to attenuate dyslipidemia in HFD-fed hamsters; and markedly elevated antioxidant enzymes in the liver of HFD-induced hamsters, further alleviating lipid peroxidation. These effects may attribute to pigeon pea contained large of unsaturated fatty acids (UFA; C18:2) and phytosterol (β-sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol). Moreover, the effects of pigeon pea on dyslipidemia were greater than β-sitosterol administration (4%), suggesting that phytosterone in pigeon pea could prevent metabolic syndrome.
Cationic hydroxyethyl cellulose (cHEC) was supplemented in a high-fat diet to determine if this new soluble fiber had an effect on hypercholesterolemia and dyslipidemia associated with cardiovascular disease using Golden Syrian hamster as an animal model. Supplementation of 3-5% cHEC in a high-fat diet for 4 weeks led to significant weight gain reduction in hamsters. In addition, significant decreases in adipose and liver weights, concentrations of plasma total, VLDL, and LDL cholesterol, and hepatic lipids were shown. No significant improvements in glucose and insulin levels were observed with cHEC; however, a significant increase in plasma adiponectin and a decrease in leptin were observed. As compared with controls, 8% cHEC-fed hamsters had greater levels of mRNA for CYP7A1 (cytochrome P450 7A1; 2-fold of control; P &lt; 0.05), CYP51 (lanosterol 14α-demethylase; 6-fold of control; P &lt; 0.05), and LDLR (LDL receptor; 1.5-fold of control) in the liver. These findings suggest the possibility of the use of cHEC for cholesterol reduction and beneficial effects on the cardiovascular risk factors.
To examine how Jiang-Zhi-Ning (JZN) regulates cholesterol metabolism and compare the role of its four main components. We established a beagle model of hyperlipidemia, fed with JZN extract and collected JZN-containing serum 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 h later. Human liver cells Bel-7402 were stimulated with 10% JZN-containing serum as well as the four main components of JZN and Atorvastatin. The mRNA expression of LDL receptor (LDL-R), 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CoAR), cytochrome P450 7A1 (CYP7A1), and acetyl-Coenzyme A acetyltransferase 2 (ACAT2) was measured by real-time PCR. LDL-R surface expression and LDL-binding and internalization were examined by flow cytometry. The results showed that JZN-containing serum significantly increased the mRNA expression of LDL-R, HMG-CoAR, and CYP7A1 in Bel-7402 cells. All the four components significantly increased the mRNA and protein expression of LDL-R and HMG-CoAR and decreased the mRNA and protein expression of ACAT2 in Bel-7402 cells. Hyperinand chrysophanol also markedly increased the mRNA expression of CYP7A1. Stimulation with stilbene glycosidesignificantly increased the surface expression of LDL-R and the binding and internalization of LDL. In conclusion, JZN and its four components have close relationship with the process of cholesterol metabolism, emphasizing their promising application as new drug candidates in the treatment of hyperlipidemia.
Gallstone disease is a common complex disease that confers a substantial economic burden on society. The genetic underpinnings of gallstone disease remain incompletely understood. We aimed to identify genetic associations with gallstone disease using publicly available data from the UK Biobank and two large Danish cohorts. We extracted genetic associations with gallstone disease from the Global Biobank Engine (GBE), an online browser of genome-wide associations in UK Biobank participants (14,940 cases and 322,268 controls). Significant associations (P &lt; 5 × 10-8 ) were retested in two Copenhagen cohorts (comprising 1,522 cases and 18,266 controls). In the Copenhagen cohorts, we also tested whether a genetic risk score was associated with gallstone disease and whether individual gallstone loci were associated with plasma levels of lipids, lipoproteins, and liver enzymes. We identified 19 loci to be associated with gallstone disease in the GBE. Of these, 12 were replicated in the Copenhagen cohorts, including six previously unknown loci (in hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha [HNF4A], fucosyltransferase 2, serpin family A member 1 [SERPINA1], jumonji domain containing 1C, AC074212.3, and solute carrier family 10A member 2 [SLC10A2]) and six known loci (in adenosine triphosphate binding cassette subfamily G member 8 [ABCG8], sulfotransferase family 2A member 1, cytochrome P450 7A1, transmembrane 4 L six family member 4, ABCB4, and tetratricopeptide repeat domain 39B). Five of the gallstone associations are protein-altering variants, and three (HNF4A p.Thr139Ile, SERPINA1 p.Glu366Lys, and SLC10A2 p.Pro290Ser) conferred per-allele odds ratios for gallstone disease of 1.30-1.36. Individuals with a genetic risk score &gt;2.5 (prevalence 1%) had a 5-fold increased risk of gallstones compared to those with a score &lt;1.0 (11%). Of the 19 lithogenic loci, 11 and ten exhibited distinct patterns of association with plasma levels of lipids and liver enzymes, respectively. Conclusion: We identified six susceptibility loci for gallstone disease.
Effect of cyclosporin A (CsA) in a therapeutic concentration, on the expression of cytochrome P450 genes (CYPs), was investigated in normal human dermal fibroblast cells. The expression of 57 genes, encoding cytochrome P450 isoforms, was estimated using the microarray method. Amongst 396 normalized fluorescence signals related to cytochrome P450 activity, only 91 were strictly connected to CYPs and were analyzed using two methods: a self-organizing feature map of artificial neural networks and typical statistical analysis with significance level at p &amp;le; 0.05. Comparing the samples from fibroblasts cultured with CsA and those cultured without, up-regulated changes of CYP19A1, 1B1, 7A1, 7F1, 17A1 and down-regulated 2D6 gene expression were observed. The mRNAs with increased changes were in the same neuron of the self-organizing feature map. All distinguished CYPs encode monooxygenases, which plays an important role in steroids biosynthesis and metabolism. Based on the obtained results, we can conclude that CsA in therapeutic concentration changes the expression profile of CYPs in human dermal fibroblasts, especially affecting genes linked to steroids synthesis and/or metabolism. It shows the potential mechanism of action of CsA in human dermal fibroblast cells.
Generating hepatocytes with complete liver functions is still a challenge and developing more functional hepatocytes is needed.
To compare various differentiation factors and protocols and introducing a preferable protocol to differentiate human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs).
After 3 days of the endoderm differentiation of hiPSCs, the cells were incubated with 5 hepatocyte differentiation culture media, protocols (P), for 14 days-P1: hepatocyte growth factor and fibroblast growth factor-4 (FGF-4) for the first week and oncostatin-M and dexamethasone for the second week; P2: similar to P1 but FGF4 was used in both the first and second weeks; P3: similar to P1 but FGF-4 was not used; P4: similar to P1 but FGF-4 and dexamethasone were not used; and P5: similar to P1 but FGF-4 and oncostatin-M were not used. After 17 days, characterization was done by qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence and ELISA.
The mRNA expression levels of hepatocyte markers (albumin, cytokeratin-18, tyrosine aminotransferase, hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α, cytochrome-P450 7A1) increased significantly (p&lt;0.05) in the differentiated cells by 5 different protocols. Furthermore, significant protein expression and secretion of albumin were detected in the differentiated cells by 5 different protocols. In P3, the differentiated cells had the highest exhibit of hepatocyte characteristics and in P4 they had the lowest. Moreover, in P1 and P2 similar results were observed.
Since P3 gave us the best results among all protocols, we recommend it as an efficient protocol to differentiate the functional HLCs from hiPSCs, which can improve cell therapies.
Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is associated with changes in the intestinal microbiota. Functional consequences of alcohol-associated dysbiosis are largely unknown. The aim of this study was to identify a mechanism of how changes in the intestinal microbiota contribute to ALD. Metagenomic sequencing of intestinal contents demonstrated that chronic ethanol feeding in mice is associated with an over-representation of bacterial genomic DNA encoding choloylglycine hydrolase, which deconjugates bile acids in the intestine. Bile acid analysis confirmed an increased amount of unconjugated bile acids in the small intestine after ethanol administration. Mediated by a lower farnesoid X receptor (FXR) activity in enterocytes, lower fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-15 protein secretion was associated with increased hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme (Cyp)-7a1 protein expression and circulating bile acid levels. Depletion of the commensal microbiota with nonabsorbable antibiotics attenuated hepatic Cyp7a1 expression and reduced ALD in mice, suggesting that increased bile acid synthesis is dependent on gut bacteria. To restore intestinal FXR activity, we used a pharmacological intervention with the intestine-restricted FXR agonist fexaramine, which protected mice from ethanol-induced liver injury. Whereas bile acid metabolism was only minimally altered, fexaramine treatment stabilized the gut barrier and significantly modulated hepatic genes involved in lipid metabolism. To link the beneficial metabolic effect to FGF15, a nontumorigenic FGF19 variant-a human FGF15 ortholog-was overexpressed in mice using adeno-associated viruses. FGF19 treatment showed similarly beneficial metabolic effects and ameliorated alcoholic steatohepatitis.
Taken together, alcohol-associated metagenomic changes result in alterations of bile acid profiles. Targeted interventions improve bile acid-FXR-FGF15 signaling by modulation of hepatic Cyp7a1 and lipid metabolism, and reduce ethanol-induced liver disease in mice. (Hepatology 2018;67:2150-2166).
The etiopathogenesis of primary sclerosing cholangitis is unknown. Genetic variants of fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2) have been identified in genome-wide association studies as risk factors for primary sclerosing cholangitis. We investigated the role of Fut2 in murine liver pathophysiology by studying Fut2-/- mice. Fut2-/- mice were viable and fertile, had lower body weight than wild-type (wt) littermates and gray fur. Half of the Fut2-/- mice showed serum bile salt levels 40 times higher than wt (Fut2-/-high ), whereas the remainder were normocholanemic (Fut2-/-low ). Fut2-/- mice showed normal serum liver tests, bile flow, biliary bile salt secretion, fecal bile salt loss, and expression of major hepatocellular bile salt transporters and cytochrome P450 7a1, the key regulator of bile salt synthesis, indicating that elevated serum bile salts in Fut2-/-high mice were not explained by cholestasis. Fut2-/-high mice, but not Fut2-/-low mice, were sensitive to hydrophobic bile salt feeding (0.3% glycochenodeoxycholate); they rapidly lost weight and showed elevation of serum liver tests (alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase) and areas of liver parenchymal necrosis. Histomorphological evaluation revealed the presence of paraportal shunting vessels, increased numbers of portal vascular structures, wall thickening of some portal arteries, and periductal fibrosis in Fut2-/-high mice more than Fut2-/-low mice and not wt mice. Unconjugated bilirubin and ammonia were or tended to be elevated in Fut2-/-high mice only. Portosystemic shunting was demonstrated by portal angiography, which disclosed virtually complete portosystemic shunting in Fut2-/-high mice, discrete portosystemic shunting in Fut2-/-low mice, and no shunting in wt littermates.
Liver pathology in Fut2-/- mice is dominated by consequences of portosystemic shunting resulting in microcirculatory disturbances, mild (secondary) periductal fibrosis, and sensitivity toward human bile salt toxicity. (Hepatology 2017;66:542-554).
In this review we develop the argument that cholestatic liver diseases, particularly primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), evolve over time with anatomically an ascending course of the disease process. The first and early lesions are in "downstream" bile ducts. This eventually leads to cholestasis, and this causes bile salt (BS)-mediated toxic injury of the "upstream" liver parenchyma. BS are toxic in high concentration. These concentrations are present in the canalicular network, bile ducts, and gallbladder. Leakage of bile from this network and ducts could be an important driver of toxicity. The liver has a great capacity to adapt to cholestasis, and this may contribute to a variable symptom-poor interval that is often observed. Current trials with drugs that target BS toxicity are effective in only about 50%-60% of primary biliary cholangitis patients, with no effective therapy in PSC. This motivated us to develop and propose a new view on the pathophysiology of primary biliary cholangitis and PSC in the hope that these new drugs can be used more effectively. These views may lead to better stratification of these diseases and to recommendations on a more "tailored" use of the new therapeutic agents that are currently tested in clinical trials. Apical sodium-dependent BS transporter inhibitors that reduce intestinal BS absorption lower the BS load and are best used in cholestatic patients. The effectiveness of BS synthesis-suppressing drugs, such as farnesoid X receptor agonists, is greatest when optimal adaptation is not yet established. By the time cytochrome P450 7A1 expression is reduced these drugs may be less effective. Anti-inflammatory agents are probably most effective in early disease, while drugs that antagonize BS toxicity, such as ursodeoxycholic acid and nor-ursodeoxycholic acid, may be effective at all disease stages. Endoscopic stenting in PSC should be reserved for situations of intercurrent cholestasis and cholangitis, not for cholestasis in end-stage disease. These are arguments to consider a step-wise pathophysiology for these diseases, with therapy adjusted to disease stage. An obstacle in such an approach is that disease stage-defining biomarkers are still lacking. This review is meant to serve as a call to prioritize the development of biomarkers that help to obtain a better stratification of these diseases. (Hepatology 2017;65:722-738).
Intestinal failure (IF)-associated liver disease (IFALD), as a major complication, contributes to significant morbidity in pediatric IF patients. However, the pathogenesis of IFALD is still uncertain. We here investigate the roles of bile acid (BA) dysmetabolism in the unclear pathogenesis of IFALD. It found that the histological evidence of pediatric IF patients exhibited liver injury, which was characterized by liver bile duct proliferation, inflammatory infiltration, hepatocyte apoptosis and different stages of fibrosis. The BA compositions were altered in serum and liver of pediatric IF patients, as reflected by a primary BA dominant composition. In IF patients, the serum FGF19 levels decreased significantly, and were conversely correlated with ileal inflammation grades (r = -0.50, p &lt; 0.05). In ileum, the inflammation grades were inversely associated with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) expression (r = -0.55, p &lt; 0.05). In liver, the expression of induction of the rate-limiting enzyme in bile salt synthesis, cytochrome P450 7a1 (CYP7A1) increased evidently. In conclusion, ileum inflammation decreases FXR expression corresponding to reduce serum FGF19 concentration, along with increased hepatic bile acid synthesis, leading to liver damages in IF patients.
Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 15/19 is part of the gut-liver crosstalk accounting for bile acid (BA) metabolism regulation. Dysregulation of fibroblast growth factor 15/19 signaling is observed in different pathological conditions, for example, in gastrointestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To understand the molecular bases, we analyzed the enterohepatic regulation of Fgf15-mediated pathway in 2 different inflammatory bowel disease mouse models.
Target genes of the BA-farnesoid-X-receptor (Fxr)-Ffg15 axis were quantified by RT-PCR or western blotting in gut and liver of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated and IL10 mice. Serum Fgf15 levels were analyzed by ELISA. Biliary and fecal BA composition was differentiated by HPLC-MS/MS.
Dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice with ileum-sparing colitis showed higher Fgf15 serum levels. In contrast, IL10 mice with ileitis had a trend toward decreased Fgf15 serum levels compared with controls and increased expression of Asbt as a negative Fxr-target gene. In hepatic tissue of both models, no histological changes, but higher interleukin 6 (IL-6) mRNA expression and down-regulation of Fxr and Cytochrom P450 7a1 mRNA expression were observed. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 up-regulation was in line with higher Fgf15 serum levels in dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice. A distinct fecal BA profile was observed in both models with significantly higher levels of taurine-conjugated BA in particular tauro-β-muricholic acid in IL10 mice.
Ileum-sparing colitis is characterized by activation of Fxr-Fgf15 signaling with higher expression of Fxr-target gene Fgf15, whereas ileal inflammation showed no signs of Fxr-Fgf15 activation. Abundance of BA such as T-β-MCA may be important for intestinal Fxr activation in mice.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disorder. It is uncertain if simple steatosis, the initial and prevailing form of NAFLD, sensitizes the liver to cholestasis. Here, we compared the effects of obstructive cholestasis in rats with a normal liver versus rats with simple steatosis induced by a methionine/choline-deficient diet. We found that plasma liver enzymes were higher and hepatic neutrophil influx, inflammation, and fibrosis were more pronounced in animals with combined steatosis and cholestasis compared to cholestasis alone. Circulating bile salt levels were markedly increased and hepatic bile salt composition shifted from hydrophilic tauro-β-muricholate to hydrophobic taurocholate. This shift was cytotoxic for HepG2 hepatoma cells. Gene expression analysis revealed induction of the rate-limiting enzyme in bile salt synthesis, cytochrome P450 7a1 (CYP7A1), and modulation of the hepatic bile salt transport system. In conclusion, simple steatosis sensitizes the liver to cholestatic injury, inflammation, and fibrosis in part due to a cytotoxic shift in bile salt composition. Plasma bile salt levels were elevated, linked to dysregulation of bile salt synthesis and enhanced trafficking of bile salts from the liver to the systemic circulation.
Hepatic encephalopathy is a serious neurological complication of liver failure. Serum bile acids are elevated after liver damage and may disrupt the blood-brain barrier and enter the brain. Our aim was to assess the role of serum bile acids in the neurological complications after acute liver failure. C57Bl/6 or cytochrome p450 7A1 knockout (Cyp7A1(-/-)) mice were fed a control, cholestyramine-containing, or bile acid-containing diet before azoxymethane (AOM)-induced acute liver failure. In parallel, mice were given an intracerebroventricular infusion of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) Vivo-morpholino before AOM injection. Liver damage, neurological decline, and molecular analyses of bile acid signaling were performed. Total bile acid levels were increased in the cortex of AOM-treated mice. Reducing serum bile acids via cholestyramine feeding or using Cyp7A1(-/-) mice reduced bile acid levels and delayed AOM-induced neurological decline, whereas cholic acid or deoxycholic acid feeding worsened AOM-induced neurological decline. The expression of bile acid signaling machinery apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter, FXR, and small heterodimer partner increased in the frontal cortex, and blocking FXR signaling delayed AOM-induced neurological decline. In conclusion, circulating bile acids may play a pathological role during hepatic encephalopathy, although precisely how they dysregulate normal brain function is unknown. Strategies to minimize serum bile acid concentrations may reduce the severity of neurological complications associated with liver failure. 
Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) plays important roles in organ development, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and cancer. Here, we examined the role of SCD1 for the differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells to liver cells by using drug inhibition and biochemical experiments. hiPS cells cultured in a pro-hepatic medium were exposed to an SCD1 inhibitor at various stages throughout differentiation. Liver-specific markers, specifically α-fetoprotein, albumin and urea in conditioned medium, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) and cytochrome P450 7A1 (CYP7A1) gene expressions and triglyceride in cellular extracts were analyzed at various development stages. Measures of hepatocyte-specific function and triglyceride accumulation in later stages were strongly inhibited a minimum of -29% (P &lt; 0.05) by SCD1 inhibitor in the early stage of hepatic differentiation and effectively reversed (&gt;30%, P &lt; 0.01) by the addition of oleate. The results were also reproducible with human primary mononuclear cells (hPMN). SCD1 inhibitor had no significant effect on liver-specific markers when it was added in the hepatic maturation stage. However, it strikingly led to higher albumin (1.6-fold, P = 0.03) and urea (1.9-fold, P = 0.02) production, and HNF4α (1.9-fold, P = 0.02) and CYP7A1 (1.3-fold, P = 0.03) expression upon incubation during the lineage-commitment stage. Hepatic differentiation from cultured hiPS cells is sensitive to SCD1 inhibition and this sensitivity is affected by the stage of cellular differentiation. Notably, findings also indicate that this notion can be extended to hPMN. The requirement for SCD1 activity in functional differentiation of hepatocytes may have relevance for human liver disease and metabolic dysregulation.
Apolipoprotein M (apoM) has been suggested to play a role in reverse cholesterol transport. Here we studied the influence of liver X-receptor (LXR) agonist on the transcriptional regulation of apoM. Studies were performed in murine liver and intestinal mucosal cells in vivo and in human intestinal Caco-2 cells in vitro. The expression of apoM was analyzed by quantitative real time PCR, and compared to well-established LXR target genes. Mice fed with TO901317 for six days showed a downregulation of apoM and apoAI in the liver to 40 % and 60 % respectively and an upregulation of Cyp7A1 to 280 %. In the small intestine, however, apoM and apoAI were upregulated by 30-60 % and ABCA1 by 250-430 %. In Caco-2 cells TO901317 caused a 60 % upregulation and the natural LXR agonist 22-hydroxycholesterol a 40 % upregulation of apoM. Possible causes for the differential effects in liver and intestine are discussed.
Lipoproteins are closely associated with the atherosclerotic vascular process. Elevated levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein AI (apo AI) in plasma indicate a low probability of coronary heart disease (CHD) together with enhanced longevity, and elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and apo B indicate an increased risk of CHD and death. Studies linking gene activation and the induction of cytochrome P450 with elevated plasma levels of apo AI and HDL-C and lowered plasma levels of LDL-C presented a new potential approach to prevent and treat atherosclerotic disease.
This is a review aimed at clarifying the effects of P450-enzymes and gene activation on cholesterol homeostasis, the atherosclerotic vascular process, prevention and regression of atherosclerosis and the manifestation of atherosclerotic disease, particularly CHD, the leading cause of death in the world.
P450-enzymes maintain cellular cholesterol homeostasis. They respond to cholesterol accumulation by enhancing the generation of hydroxycholesterols (oxysterols) and activating cholesterol-eliminating mechanisms. The CYP7A1, CYP27A1, CYP46A1 and CYP3A4 enzymes generate major oxysterols that enter the circulation. The oxysterols activate-via nuclear receptors-ATP-binding cassette (ABC) A1 and other genes, leading to the elimination of excess cholesterol and protecting arteries from atherosclerosis. Several drugs and nonpharmacologic compounds are ligands for the liver X receptor, pregnane X receptor and other receptors, activate P450 and other genes involved in cholesterol elimination, prevent or regress atherosclerosis and reduce cardiovascular events.
P450-enzymes are essential in the physiological maintenance of cholesterol balance. They activate mechanisms which eliminate excess cholesterol and counteract the atherosclerotic process. Several drugs and nonpharmacologic compounds induce P450 and other genes, prevent or regress atherosclerosis and reduce the occurrence of non-fatal and fatal CHD and other atherosclerotic diseases.
To explore the effects of the simultaneous activation of liver X receptor (LXR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) on bile acid biosynthesis in rats.
Totally 36 male SD rats were divided into three groups with 12 rats in each group: control group, high cholesterol (HC) group, and high cholesterol + fenofibrate (HC + FENO) group. Total bile acids (serum bile acids plus fecal bile acids) level was assayed. The levels of mRNA for peroxisomal palmitoyl-CoA oxidase (Acox1), LXR, cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), D-bifunctional protein (DBP), trihydroxycoprostanoyl-CoA oxidase (Acox2), sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase (CYP8B1), and sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) in liver were detected by RT-PCR.
Total bile acid level was significantly higher in HC + FENO group than in HC group (P &lt; 0.01), and both were significantly higher than that in control group (P &lt; 0.01). Compared with HC group, the mRNA expression of Acox1 and DBP was significantly higher in HC + FENO group (P &lt; 0.01), but no statistical differences was found between HC group and control group. The mRNA levels of LXR and CYP7A1 in HC + FENO group and HC group were not significantly different but were both significantly higher than that in control group (P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.05). No changes were observed in Acox2, CYPSB1, and CYP27A1 mRNA levels among these three groups.
Simultaneous activation of LXR and PPARalpha can increase of CYP7A1 and DBP mRNA exDression and thus accelerates the biosynthesis of bile acid.
One of the major oxysterols in the human circulation is 4 beta-hydroxycholesterol formed from cholesterol by the drug-metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450 3A4. Deuterium-labeled 4 beta-hydroxycholesterol was injected into two healthy volunteers, and the apparent half-life was found to be 64 and 60 h, respectively. We have determined earlier the half-lives for 7 alpha-, 27-, and 24-hydroxycholesterol to be approximately 0.5, 0.75, and 14 h, respectively. Patients treated with certain antiepileptic drugs have up to 20-fold increased plasma concentrations of 4 beta-hydroxycholesterol. The apparent half-life of deuterium-labeled 4 beta-hydroxycholesterol in such a patient was found to be 52 h, suggesting that the high plasma concentration was because of increased synthesis rather than impaired clearance. 4 beta-Hydroxycholesterol was converted into acidic products at a much slower rate than 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol in primary human hepatocytes, and 4 beta-hydroxycholesterol was 7 alpha-hydroxylated at a slower rate than cholesterol by recombinant human CYP7A1. CYP7B1 and CYP39A1 had no activity toward 4 beta-hydroxycholesterol. These results suggest that the high plasma concentration of 4 beta-hydroxycholesterol is because of its exceptionally slow elimination, probably in part because of the low rate of 7 alpha-hydroxylation of the steroid. The findings are discussed in relation to a potential role of 4 beta-hydroxycholesterol as a ligand for the nuclear receptor LXR.
Liver X receptor (LXR) has been identified as a potential target for treatment of atherosclerosis and diabetes. Activation of LXR, however, is associated with increased lipogenesis and fat accumulation in the liver. The objective of the current study was to examine the effect of resveratrol on LXR activator-induced fat accumulation in liver using mice as an animal model. Three groups of C57BL/6 mice were studied. Animals in group 1 were treated with T0901317, a potent activator of LXR in mice. Animals in group 2 served as the control and were treated with carrier solution and those in group 3 were treated with T0901317/resveratrol combination. Using histochemical and biochemical methods, we demonstrate that resveratrol treatment significantly suppressed fat accumulation in the liver induced by T0901317. In addition, resveratrol completely blocked elevation of blood levels of triglyceride and cholesterol and reduced blood glucose level. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that resveratrol treatment did not change the mRNA levels of abca1, abcg1, cyp7a1, srebp-1c, chrebp, and acc genes compared to that of animals treated with T0901317 alone but reduced pepck and g6p gene expressions. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses show resveratrol treatment activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and increased phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Treatment with T0901317 on hepatocytes increased intracellular fat accumulation and this increase was suppressed by resveratrol; the suppressive effect of resveratrol was greatly repressed by Compound C which is an inhibitor of AMPK. Collectively, these data suggest that resveratrol blocks T0901317-induced lipid accumulation in the liver and can be considered for inclusion into the treatment of diseases involving activation of liver X receptor. 
The effect of activation of liver X receptor by N-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-N-[4-[2,2,2-trifluoro-1-hydroxy-1(trifluoromethyl)ethyl]phenyl] benzenesulfonamide (T0901317) on high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and insulin resistance was examined in C57BL/6 mice. When on HFD continuously for 10 weeks, C57BL/6 mice became obese with an average body weight of 42 g, insulin resistant, and glucose intolerant. Twice weekly intraperitoneal injections of T0901317 at 50 mg/kg in animals on the same diet completely blocked obesity development, obesity-associated insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that T0901317-treated animals had significantly higher mRNA levels of genes involved in energy metabolism, including Ucp-1, Pgc1a, Pgc1b, Cpt1a, Cpt1b, Acadm, Acadl, Aox, and Ehhadh. Transcription activation of Cyp7a1, Srebp-1c, Fas, Scd-1, and Acc-1 genes was also seen in T0901317-treated animals. T0901317 treatment induced reversible aggregation of lipids in the liver. These results suggest that liver X receptor could be a potential target for prevention of obesity and obesity-associated insulin resistance.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are members of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors. They play a crucial role in lipid metabolism processes such as bile acid and fatty acid synthesis, as well as minor or limited roles in the regulation of cholesterol synthesis and uptake in mammals. In avian species, however, little is known about the role of LXRs except for the fact that they are involved in the stimulation of fatty acid synthesis. In this study, we characterize the expression profile of genes related to bile acid, cholesterol, and fatty acid synthesis and VLDL secretion in chicken primary hepatocytes treated with T0901317, a synthetic agonist of LXR. The activity of chicken cholesterol 7α hydroxylase (CYP7A1), a key enzyme in bile acid synthesis, mRNA expression, and bile acid excretion, was stimulated by supplementation of the culture medium with a low concentration (0.01 μM) of T0901317. In contrast, the levels of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-1, fatty acid synthase mRNA, and VLDL-triacylglycerol in cells cultured in the presence of a high concentration (10 μM) of T0901317 were higher than those cultured in zero or low concentrations of T0901317. These results suggest that cellular responses to this LXR agonist were similar to those present in mammals. A novel finding of this study concerned changes to the regulation of cholesterol synthesis and uptake in chicken hepatocytes treated with T0901317. Levels of SREBP-2,3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) mRNA expression increased as a function of increasing T0901317 (up to 1.0 μM), but remained similar to those in cells cultured under control conditions when the concentration of T0901317 was increased to 10 μM. These results suggest that LXRs play an important role in cholesterol synthesis and uptake in chicken hepatocytes and, as such, differ to findings in mammals where the effect of LXR agonists on cholesterol synthesis plays only a minor role in the regulation of cellular sterol homeostasis.
PANcreatic-DERived factor (PANDER) is a member of a superfamily of FAM3 proteins modulating glycemic levels by metabolic regulation of the liver and pancreas. The precise PANDER-induced hepatic signaling mechanism is still being elucidated and has been very complex due to the pleiotropic nature of this novel hormone. Our PANDER transgenic (PANTG) mouse displays a selective hepatic insulin resistant (SHIR) phenotype whereby insulin signaling is blunted yet lipogenesis is increased, a phenomena observed in type 2 diabetes. To examine the complex PANDER-induced mechanism of SHIR, we utilized quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis using Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino Acids in Cell Culture (SILAC) to reveal the global hepatic proteome differences within the PANTG under the metabolic states of fasting, fed and insulin-stimulated conditions. Proteomic analysis identified lipid metabolism as one of the top cellular functions differentially altered in all metabolic states. Differentially expressed proteins within the PANTG having a lipid metabolic role included ACC, ACLY, CD36, CYP7A1, FASN and SCD1. Central to the differentially expressed proteins involved in lipid metabolism was the predicted activation of the liver X receptor (LXR) pathway. Western analysis validated the increased hepatic expression of LXRα along with LXR-directed targets such as FASN and CYP7A1 within the PANTG liver. Furthermore, recombinant PANDER was capable of inducing LXR promoter activity in-vitro as determined by luciferase reporter assays. Taken together, PANDER strongly impacts hepatic lipid metabolism across metabolic states and may induce a SHIR phenotype via the LXR pathway.
Black bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) seed coats are a rich source of natural compounds with potential beneficial effects on human health. Beans exert hypolipidaemic activity; however, this effect has not been attributed to any particular component, and the underlying mechanisms of action and protein targets remain unknown. The aim of the present study was to identify and quantify primary saponins and flavonoids extracted from black bean seed coats, and to study their effects on lipid metabolism in primary rat hepatocytes and C57BL/6 mice. The methanol extract of black bean seed coats, characterised by a HPLC system with a UV-visible detector and an evaporative light-scattering detector and HPLC-time-of-flight/MS, contained quercetin 3-O-glucoside and soyasaponin Af as the primary flavonoid and saponin, respectively. The extract significantly reduced the expression of SREBP1c, FAS and HMGCR, and stimulated the expression of the reverse cholesterol transporters ABCG5/ABCG8 and CYP7A1 in the liver. In addition, there was an increase in the expression of hepatic PPAR-α. Consequently, there was a decrease in hepatic lipid depots and a significant increase in bile acid secretion. Furthermore, the ingestion of this extract modulated the proportion of lipids that was used as a substrate for energy generation. Thus, the results suggest that the extract of black bean seed coats may decrease hepatic lipogenesis and stimulate cholesterol excretion, in part, via bile acid synthesis. 
We have generated transgenic mice expressing human CYP7A1 transgenes. Only 1.5 kilobases (kb) of 5' upstream sequence and 6.5 kb of 3' sequence were sufficient for hepatic transcription of the transgenes. However, the 5' end segment alone was not sufficient to direct liver expression, suggesting that additional hepatic regulatory elements reside in the 3' extension or within introns. The level of expression of these transgenes was low in comparison to the levels of the endogenous mouse CYP7A1 mRNA. To generate mice expressing higher levels of CYP7A1 mRNA, we injected a large human genomic PAC clone, extending up to -105 kb 5' of the structural gene and about 50 kb 3' of the gene. These transgenic mice expressed CYP7A1 mRNA at higher levels, suggesting that additional hepatic regulatory elements are found either 5' of -1520 or beyond 6.5 kb 3' of the gene.
Origins of hyperlipidemia and cholestasis that occur during pregnancy were investigated by examining expression of key elements related to plasma and hepatic cholesterol metabolism during pregnancy, lactation, and post-lactation in the rat model. Among major findings were: during pregnancy, the activities of hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase, acyl coenzyme A:diacylglycerol acyltransferase, cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase, cholesterol ester hydrolases, low density lipoprotein receptors, LRP, and mdr2 were significantly lower or similar to non-pregnant controls while SR-B1 was elevated. Once lactation began, reductase, cholesterol acyltransferase, 7alpha-hydroxylase activities, low density lipoprotein receptors, and mdr2 increased while SR-B1 decreased. In later stages of lactation most hepatic elements returned to near control levels. Plasma cholesterol levels were higher than control at birth and during lactation with increase in LDL-size particles. By 24 h post-lactation, plasma triglycerides were 3.7-fold higher while cholesterol remained unchanged. Very large lipoproteins were present while LDL-size particles were now absent. Hepatic cholesterol acyltransferase had decreased to 27% of control while diacylglycerol acyltransferase increased 3-fold and low density lipoprotein receptors doubled. Most elements were normalized 3 weeks after weaning except for LRP and low density lipoprotein receptors which were elevated. These studies provide an integrated picture of expression of key elements of hepatic and plasma cholesterol metabolism during pregnancy and lactation and advance understanding of hyperlipidemia and cholestasis during these states.
Infection, inflammation and trauma induce marked changes in the plasma levels of a wide variety of proteins (acute phase response), and these changes are mediated by cytokines. The acute phase response is thought to be beneficial to the host. The host's response to injury also results in dramatic alterations in lipid metabolism and circulating lipoprotein levels which are mediated by cytokines. A large number of cytokines including TNF, the interleukins, and the interferons increase serum triglyceride levels. This rapid increase (1-2 h) is predominantly due to an increase in hepatic VLDL secretion while the late increase may be due to a variety of factors including increased hepatic production of VLDL or delayed clearance secondary to a decrease in lipoprotein lipase activity and/or apolipoprotein E levels on VLDL. In animals other than primates, cytokines also increase serum cholesterol levels, most likely by increasing hepatic cholesterol. Cytokines increase hepatic cholesterol synthesis by stimulating HMG CoA reductase gene expression and decrease hepatic cholesterol catabolism by inhibiting cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, the key enzyme in bile acid synthesis. Injury and/or cytokines also decrease HDL cholesterol levels and induce alterations in the composition of HDL. The content of SAA and apolipoprotein J increase, apolipoprotein A1 may decrease, and the cholesterol ester content decreases while free cholesterol increases. Additionally, key proteins involved in HDL metabolism are altered by cytokines; LCAT activity, hepatic lipase activity, and CETP levels decrease. These changes in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism may be beneficial in a number of ways including: lipoproteins competing with viruses for cellular receptors, apolipoproteins neutralizing viruses, lipoproteins binding and targeting parasites for destruction, apolipoproteins lysing parasites, redistribution of nutrients to cells involved in the immune response and/or tissue repair, and lipoproteins binding toxic agents and neutralizing their harmful effects. Thus, cytokines induce marked changes in lipid metabolism that lead to hyperlipidemia which represents part of the innate immune response and may be beneficial to the host.
Phospholipid liposomes are synthetic mediators of "reverse" cholesterol transport from peripheral tissue to liver in vivo and can shrink atherosclerotic lesions in animals. Hepatic disposal of this cholesterol, however, has not been examined. We compared hepatic effects of large (approximately equal to 120-nm) and small (approximately equal to 35-nm) unilamellar vesicles (LUVs and SUVs), both of which mediate reverse cholesterol transport in vivo but were previously shown to be targeted to different cell types within the liver. On days 1, 3, and 5, rabbits were intravenously injected with 300 mg phosphatidylcholine (LUVs or SUVs) per kilogram body weight or with the equivalent volume of saline. After each injection, LUV- and SUV-injected animals showed large increases in plasma concentrations of unesterified cholesterol, indicating mobilization of tissue stores. After hepatic uptake of this cholesterol, however, SUV-treated animals developed persistently elevated plasma LDL concentrations, which by day 6 had increased to more than four times the values in saline-treated controls. In contrast, LUV-treated animals showed normal LDL levels. By RNase protection assay, SUVs suppressed hepatic LDL receptor mRNA at day 6 (to 61 +/- 4% of control, mean +/- SEM), whereas LUVs caused a statistically insignificant stimulation. Hepatic HMG-CoA reductase message was also significantly suppressed with SUV, but not LUV treatment, and hepatic 7 alpha-hydroxylase message showed a similar trend. These data on hepatic mRNA levels indicate that SUVs, but not LUVs, substantially perturbed liver cholesterol homeostasis. We conclude that LUVs and SUVs mobilize peripheral tissue cholesterol and deliver it to the liver, but to distinct metabolic pools that exert different regulatory effects. The effects of one of these artificial particles, SUVs, suggest that reverse cholesterol transport may not always be benign. In contrast, LUVs may be a suitable therapeutic agent, because they mobilize peripheral cholesterol to the liver without suppressing hepatic LDL receptor mRNA and without provoking a subsequent rise in plasma LDL levels.
The effect of dietary guar gum (GG, 7.5%) on lipid metabolism and on bile acid secretion and reabsorption was investigated in rats adapted to cholesterol-free or 0.3% cholesterol diets. Compared with controls (fiber-free/cholesterol-free), rats fed cholesterol had significantly elevated plasma and liver cholesterol and triglyceride. In these rats, GG had a potent plasma cholesterol-lowering effect and also counteracted the liver accumulation of triglyceride and cholesterol esters. Fecal excretion of sterols, the major route of cholesterol elimination, was markedly enhanced by GG, especially in rats fed the cholesterol-containing diet (P &lt; 0.001). The biliary bile acid flux into the small intestine was enhanced by dietary cholesterol (+30%) or GG (+52%) or both (P &lt; 0.001). The fecal excretion of bile acids was significantly elevated by GG alone (+74%) and by dietary cholesterol (+190%). Small intestine reabsorption of bile acids appears to be significantly enhanced by GG, which also enhanced the transfer of bile acids into the large intestine, hence a greater fecal loss of steroids, although bile acid reabsorption was very effective in the cecum. GG feeding induced liver hydroxymethyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, even in cholesterol-fed rats, as well as cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (P &lt; 0.001). The cholesterol-lowering effect of GG thus appears to be mediated by an accelerated fecal excretion of steroids and a rise in the intestinal pool and biliary production of bile acids. Although liver HMG CoA reductase and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase are induced in parallel, this is not sufficient to compensate for fecal steroid losses.
The major high density lipoprotein (HDL) apolipoprotein, apoA-I, was knocked out by gene targeting in ES cells to provide a model for the study of HDL metabolism and its relationship to plasma and tissue cholesterol metabolism. HDL and non-HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) were reduced in apoA-I-deficient mice. Feeding a high fat-high cholesterol diet raised HDL-C minimally in apoA-I knockout compared to the large increase seen in control mice, suggesting an interaction between diet and apoA-I genotype. In apoA-I-deficient mice, HDL was normal in size but altered in composition. Compared to control mice there was more triglyceride and free cholesterol and less cholesteryl ester (CE), suggesting that apoA-I-deficient HDL is a poor substrate for hepatic lipase and lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). The metabolic basis of the low HDL-C levels in the apoA-I knockout mice was decreased flux into the HDL CE pool. The absolute delivery of HDL CE to both peripheral tissues and liver was also decreased. As tissue cholesterol levels and synthesis were unchanged, the decreased flux of cholesterol into the HDL CE pool was most likely due to decreased efflux of cholesterol from the peripheral tissues and decreased functional LCAT activity. The low HDL-C state in the apoA-I-deficient mouse was associated with an absolute decrease in unidirectional transport of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver but this did not lead to cholesterol accumulation in the periphery or a cholesterol deficit in the liver; nor was there altered peripheral tissue HMG-CoA reductase activity. The only sign of decreased cholesterol flux to the liver was a 2.3-fold decrease in liver cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase mRNA, suggesting decreased bile acid synthesis. In the apoA-I knockout mouse model it appears that low HDL levels create a new steady state in which decreased cholesterol is delivered to both peripheral tissues and the liver.
Inbred strains of mice differ in susceptibility to atherogenesis when challenged with a high fat, high cholesterol diet containing 0.5% cholic acid. Studies of recombinant inbred (RI) strains derived from the susceptible strain C57BL/6J (B6) and the resistant strains C3H/HeJ (C3H) and BALB/cJ have revealed an association between fatty streak lesion size and a decrease in high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels on the diet. To better understand the genetic factors contributing to HDL metabolism and atherogenesis in response to the diet, we studied mice derived from an intercross between B6 and C3H using a complete linkage map approach. A total of 185 female progeny were typed for 134 genetic markers spanning the mouse genome, resulting in an average interval of about 10 cM between markers. A locus on distal chromosome 1 containing the apolipoprotein AII gene was linked to HDL-cholesterol levels on both the chow and the atherogenic diets, but this locus did not contribute to the decrease in HDL-cholesterol in response to the diet. At least three distinct genetic loci, on chromosomes 3, 5, and 11, exhibited evidence of linkage to a decrease in HDL-cholesterol after a dietary challenge. Since a bile acid (cholic acid) is required for the diet induced changes in HDL levels and for atherogenesis in these strains, we examined cholesterol-7-alpha hydroxylase (C7AH) expression. Whereas B6 mice exhibited a large decrease in C7AH mRNA levels in response to the diet, C3H showed an increase. Among the intercross mice, multiple loci contributed to the regulation of C7AH mRNA levels in response to the diet, the most notable of which coincided with the loci on chromosomes 3, 5, and 11 controlling HDL levels in response to the diet. None of these loci were linked to the C7AH structural gene which we mapped to proximal chromosome 4. These studies reveal coordinate regulation of C7AH expression and HDL levels, and they indicate that the genetic factors controlling HDL levels are more complex than previously suggested by studies of RI strains. Furthermore, we observed that two of the loci for C7AH expression contributed to differences in gallstone formation between these strains.
We have recently reported that coordinate down-regulation of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase and sterol 27-hydroxylase by bile acids results in suppression of bile acid synthesis in cultured rat hepatocytes [Twisk, J., De Wit, E. &amp; Princen, H. M. G. (1995) Biochem. J. 305, 505-511]. In the current study, we have assessed the effects of a large group of different bile acids, both naturally occurring and synthetic, on these two key enzymes, to elucidate structural features which render bile acids potent as regulators of bile acid synthesis. Addition of 50 microM deoxycholate or cholate, two relatively hydrophobic bile acids, to the culture medium of hepatocytes resulted in strong suppression of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (suppression of 75%) and 88%, respectively) and sterol 27-hydroxylase activity (suppression of 76% and 72%, respectively). These effects were also reflected in the mRNA levels and the transcriptional activities of the two enzymes, showing a parallel suppression of both parameters in response to cholate (suppression of 78% and 43% for cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase mRNA and transcription, respectively, and suppression of 76% and 42% for sterol 27-hydroxylase mRNA and transcription, respectively). In contrast, no effects were observed with the two hydrophilic bile acids, beta-muricholate and ursocholate. Transient expression analysis in cultured rat hepatocytes, using a promoter-reporter construct containing the proximal part of the cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase promoter, demonstrated a reduction of transcriptional activity by cholate (reduction of 72%), but not by ursocholate. Assessment of the effects of 27 different bile acids, varying in the number, position and orientation (alpha/beta) of hydroxyl groups on the steroid nucleus of the molecule, on cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase mRNA showed only a moderate correlation with the hydrophobicity index of the bile acid involved (r = 0.61; P &lt; 0.0001). Analysis of the three-dimensional structure of a number of these bile acids suggests that hydroxyl groups situated in close proximity to each other within the molecule, creating a hydrophilic environment, as in the case of cholate, may be a prerequisite for a strong inhibitory potency. Deviation from this situation leads to a markedly lesser effect on suppression of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase and sterol 27-hydroxylase.
Although dietary cholesterol raises plasma total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations, the response to a given intake of cholesterol varies enormously among different species and even among individuals of the same species. The mechanisms responsible for differing sensitivity to dietary cholesterol were examined by comparing the rat, which is able to adapt to large fluctuations in sterol intake or loss with little change in plasma LDL levels, with the hamster, where changes in sterol balance strongly influence plasma LDL concentrations. When fed the same cholesterol-free diet, hepatic 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity was 16-fold higher in the rat than in the hamster. As a consequence, rates of hepatic cholesterol synthesis were 20-fold higher in the rat than in the hamster. In both species, hepatic cholesterol synthesis was suppressed &gt; 90% in response to increasing loads of dietary cholesterol. However, the quantitative importance of this adaptive mechanism was much greater in the rat since the absolute reduction in hepatic cholesterol synthesis in the rat (2,110 nmol/h/g) was much larger than in the hamster (103 nmol/h/g). In the rat, the high basal level of 7 alpha-hydroxylase expression was further induced by substrate (cholesterol) allowing these animals to convert excess dietary cholesterol to bile acids efficiently. In contrast, the low basal level of enzyme expression in the hamster was not induced by dietary cholesterol. Thus, the low basal rates of bile acid and cholesterol synthesis coupled with a lack of 7 alpha-hydroxylase induction by cholesterol render the hamster much more sensitive than the rat to the cholesterolemic effects of dietary cholesterol.
The effect of different polysaccharides fermented in the large intestine and liable to lower plasma cholesterol was investigated in rats. Male rats were assigned to one of five treatment groups: control diet or a diet containing pectin, guar gum, gum arabic or beta-cyclodextrin. The four compounds were effectively fermented, yielding cecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) concentrations in the range of 130 to 170 mmol/L. Relative to controls, the cecal concentration of propionate was significantly higher in rats fed all fibers, especially those fed guar gum (+190%) or beta-cyclodextrin (+385%). All the fermented carbohydrates elicited a significant cholesterol-lowering effect, which was most potent in rats fed guar gum or beta-cyclodextrin, the two fibers that also significantly depressed plasma triglycerides. These two carbohydrates significantly lowered LDL and HDL1 cholesterol, triglyceride-rich lipoprotein triglycerides and apolipoprotein E levels. Apolipoprotein B was lowered only by beta-cyclodextrin. The microsomal activities of hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG) CoA reductase and of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase were markedly elevated in rats fed guar gum or beta-cyclodextrin and, to a lesser extent, in those fed pectin compared with controls. Increased bile acid excretion seems to be essential in the cholesterol-lowering effect of soluble fibers and related compounds. This effect is connected to induction of HMG CoA reductase and lowering concentrations of apolipoprotein E-containing particles.
We investigated the relationship between plasma cholestanol (5 alpha-dihydrocholesterol) concentrations and the activity and mRNA levels of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, the rate-controlling enzyme for bile acid synthesis, in three female sitosterolemic homozygotes. In this lipid storage disease, large amounts of plant sterols and cholestanol accumulate because of hyperabsorption and endogenous synthesis, respectively. Plasma cholestanol concentrations were 14 times greater in the three sitosterolemic homozygotes than the mean for five control subjects. To investigate the cholestanol biosynthetic pathway, tracer doses of two putative precursors, [1,2-3H]4-cholesten-3-one and [4-14C]7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol were injected intravenously into a homozygote, and radioactivity was sought in cholestanol, bile acids, cholesterol, and sitosterol fractions isolated from plasma and bile. Tritium was concentrated only in cholestanol; neither cholesterol, sitosterol nor bile acids were derived from [1,2-3H]4-cholesten-3-one. In contrast, bile acids were labeled exclusively with 14C from [4-14C]7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol; no 14C radioactivity was detected in cholestanol. Mathematical analysis of specific activity versus time curves for [3H]cholestanol revealed very slow decay, large exchangeable pools, and enhanced synthesis in the sitosterolemic homozygote. Measurements of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity were 39% lower in whole liver microsomes from three sitosterolemic homozygotes that contained 19% plant sterols as compared to the mean value for six control microsomal specimens that contained 0.1% plant sterols. Removal of the excess plant sterols from the microsomes, in vitro, normalized microsomal cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity in the homozygotes but did not affect enzyme activity in the controls. Equal amounts of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase mRNA were detected in the livers of both control and sitosterolemic subjects. Bile acid malabsorption after ileal bypass surgery stimulated cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity 78% in sitosterolemic whole liver microsomes and reduced plasma cholesterol, sitosterol, and cholestanol levels 61%, 55% and 91%, respectively, producing a pronounced decrease in the cholestanol/cholesterol ratio without changing the sitosterol/cholesterol ratio. These results demonstrate that increased cholestanol is synthesized from 4-cholesten-3-one and not 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol in sitosterolemia. Enhanced pools and plasma concentrations are related inversely to hepatic cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity. Competitive inhibition of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase by the large microsomal plant sterol pool diverts cholesterol into cholestanol. Alternatively, stimulating cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity after ileal bypass surgery markedly diminished plasma cholestanol levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
Cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (P450c7) is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid biosynthesis and is the product of a cytochrome P450 gene, CYP7. We have previously reported the cloning of a full-length human cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase cDNA (Karam, W. G., and J. Y. L. Chiang. 1992. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 185: 588-595). Using this clone in a polymerase chain reaction, we have generated a cDNA (H7 alpha 1.5) in which the codons for the N-terminal 24 amino acid residues were deleted. The translational product of this cDNA would be a truncated protein, P450c7(delta 2-24) with a hydrophilic NH2-terminal sequence, Met-Ala-Arg-Arg-Arg-Gln... This cDNA was cloned into the expression vector pJL and the construct pJL/H7 alpha 1.5 was transformed into E. coli strain TOPP3. We have also ligated a truncated rat cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase cDNA obtained previously (Li, Y. C., and J. Y. L. Chiang. 1991. J. Biol. Chem. 266: 19186-19191) into the pJL vector and have transformed this construct (pJL/R7 alpha 1.5) into E. coli strain MV1304. Both of these systems expressed functional cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase in E. coli. A fivefold improvement in the expression of rat enzyme over the previous expression system was obtained. About 70-80% of the truncated human P450 in the clear lysate was localized in the cytosol. The truncated human and rat P450c7(delta 2-24) were purified to homogeneity. Reconstitution of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity using purified rat or human P450c7(delta 2-24) showed a similar Km of 6 and 7 microM for cholesterol, a Vmax of 0.13 and 0.14 nmol/min, and a turnover number of 1.3 and 1.5 per min, respectively. Immunoblotting experiment revealed that a polyclonal antibody raised against rat microsomal cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase recognized both rat and human P450c7(delta 2-24). This expression system provides a method for isolation of a large quantity of purified and catalytically active cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase for the study of structure and function of this important enzyme in bile acid synthesis and cholesterol homeostasis.
Cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity was determined in parallel with the rate of cholesterogenesis from acetate and mevalonate in the liver of hamsters fed diets enriched with pectins (5%) and/or cholesterol (0.1%). Cholesterol feeding reduced the rate of incorporation of the precursors into cholesterol. Moreover, the radioactivity derived from mevalonate was found mainly in the esterified form of the newly synthesized molecules. In parallel, cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylation decreased by 50%. Pectins did not greatly affect hepatic cholesterogenesis or 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol formation. In contrast, the fibers prevented to a large extent the metabolic alterations resulting from cholesterol feeding. Cholesterogenesis from mevalonate remained active; ester formation declined and the activity of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase persisted. Pectins could maintain the activity of this enzyme through multiple mechanisms, one of them being the channeling of substrate into the specific compartment of cholesterol which is destined to form bile acids.
Large amounts of cholestanol, the 5 alpha-dihydro derivative of cholesterol are found in tissues of patients with the rare inherited sterol storage disease cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. Although small amounts of cholestanol are present in virtually every tissue of normal man, little is known about its metabolism and effect on cholesterol and bile acid formation. The purpose of this study is to investigate the absorption and metabolism of cholestanol and its early effects on hepatic morphology and on the rate-limiting enzymes of cholesterol and bile acid biosynthesis. After 2 wk on a diet supplemented with 2% cholestanol, total liver sterol content increased by 48% (3.26 vs. 2.20 mg/g), and resulted in a significant rise in hepatic cholestanol concentration to 1.4 mg/g. However, cholestanol was less efficiently absorbed from the intestine than cholesterol and interfered with cholesterol absorption. Furthermore, hepatic hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity rose 2.6-fold (from 150.3 to 397.0 pmol/mg per min) during cholestanol feeding, and was associated with a marked proliferation of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of the centrilobular areas. In addition, significant amounts of allocholic acid (16%) and allochenodeoxycholic acid (5%) were formed from cholestanol and excreted in the bile. These results show that cholestanol is absorbed from the intestine, interferes with cholesterol absorption, and is deposited in the liver. However, in contrast to cholesterol, cholestanol feeding was associated with a marked elevation of HMG-CoA reductase activity. Thus, despite structural similarity between cholesterol and its 5 alpha-saturated derivative, cholestanol does not exert feedback inhibition on hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis.
The effect of oral administration of taurine (200-300 mg daily) on the metabolism of bile acids was studied in male guinea pigs which have predominantly glycine conjugated bile acids. The results were summarized as follows: (a) oral administration of taurine for 10 days increased taurine-conjugated bile acids and the ratio of glycine- to taurine-conjugated bile acids (G:T ratio) shifted from 3.95 to 0.19; (b) in taurine fed guinea pigs, the half-life of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDC) was about 40% shorter than that in controls and the fractional turnover rate increased by 70%; (c) the synthetic rate (mg/day/500 g body weight) of bile acids increased from 4.28 to 7.27 by taurine feeding; (d) hepatic cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity was increased 2.4-fold by taurine feeding; (e) the total pool size of bile acids did not change significantly but the amount of lithocholic acid in the caecum and large intestine increased by about 40%; (f) neither free cholesterol nor cholesterol ester levels in liver and serum changed significantly. Results of this study suggest that changing the G:T ratio in the bile acid conjugation pattern may influence the rate of hepatic bile acid synthesis.
Cytochrome P-450 was purified from bovine adrenal cortex mitochondria by affinity chromatography using an octylamine-substituted Sepharose column. The resulting optically clear preparation was stable at -20 degrees for months. The specific concentration of cytochrome P-450 in the preparation was about 5 nmol of heme per mg of protein. The preparations were free of adrenodoxin, adrenodoxin reductase, phospholipids, and other heme contaminations. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified cytochrome P-450 preparation treated with sodium dodecyl sulfate and mercaptoethanol showed a single major band with a molecular weight of about 60,000. The optical absorption spectra of the preparation exhibited Soret maxima at 416, 416, and 448 nm for the Fe3+, Fe2+ and the C.Fe2+ complex, respectively. The EPR spectrum showed the characteristic features of the low spin form of ferric cytochrome P-450 with principal components 1.914, 2.241, and 2.415 of the g-tensor. The circular dichroism spectrum revealed two large negative ellipticities at 412 and 350 nm. Fluorescence spectra showed an excitation maximum at 285 nm and an emission maximum at 305 nm with a shoulder at 330 nm as the cytochrome P-450 molecule is excited at 285 nm, or an emission maximum at 335 nm when the cytochrome molecule is excited at 305 nm. After reconstitution with adrenodoxin and its reductase, this cytochrome P-450 was highly active for cholesterol desmolase with an NADPH-generating system as electron donor but was not active for steroid 11beta-hydroxylase.
The activities of liver microsomal enzymes were studied in preparations from unanesthetized rats and rats anesthetized for one hour with nitrous oxide, diethyl ether, halothane or chloroform. Most of the enzymes studied were cytochrome P-450-dependent oxygenases that hydroxylate endogenous substrates. The other microsomal enzymes, assayed for comparison, included the cytochrome P-450-dependent aminopyrine demethylase, glucose-6-phosphatase, a dehydrogenase, and NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase. No anesthetic was associated with a significant change in activity of any enzyme studied. In rats pretreated with phenobarbital no anesthetic except chloroform changed enzymic activity. All hydroxylations were inhibited markedly by chloroform, as were a microsomal dehydrogenation, hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate, and NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase activity. Administration of alpha-tocopherol did not prevent the inhibition associated with chloroform in phenobarbital-induced animals. It is concluded that cytochrome P-450-dependent hydroxylations involved in metabolic processes normally proceeding in the endoplasmic reticulum of the liver are not permanently affected by the anesthetics used in this study. The inhibitory effect of chloroform after pretreatment with phenobarbital is unspecific and affects a large number of different microsomal enzymes. Evidence that mechanisms other than lipid peroxidation may be responsible for the toxic effects of chloroform in the liver is presented.
Soluble fiber consistently lowers plasma total and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol concentrations in humans and various animal models including the hamster; however, the mechanism of this effect remains incompletely defined. We performed studies to determine the activity of dietary psyllium on hepatic 7 alpha-hydroxylase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase and LDL receptor expression in the hamster. In animals fed a cholesterol-free semisynthetic diet containing 7.5% cellulose (avicel) as a fiber source, substitution of psyllium for avicel increased hepatic 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity and mRNA levels by 3-4-fold. Comparable effects on 7 alpha-hydroxylase expression were observed with 1% cholestyramine. Psyllium also increased hepatic 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity and mRNA in animals fed a diet enriched with cholesterol and triglyceride. Activation of 7 alpha-hydroxylase was associated with an increase in hepatic cholesterol synthesis that was apparently not fully compensatory since the cholesterol content of the liver declined. Although dietary psyllium did not increase hepatic LDL receptor expression in animals fed the cholesterol-free, very-low-fat diet, it did increase (or at least restore) receptor expression that had been downregulated by dietary cholesterol and triglyceride. Thus, 7.5% dietary psyllium produced effects on hepatic 7 alpha-hydroxylase and LDL metabolism that were similar to those of 1% cholestyramine. Induction of hepatic 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity by dietary psyllium may account, in large part, for the hypocholesterolemic effect of this soluble fiber.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of dietary propionic acid and bile acid excretion on the hypocholesterolemic effect of fibers. For this purpose, rats were adapted to a diet containing 10 g inulin, 10 g beta-cyclodextrin, or 2.5 g calcium propionate per 100 g diet. Both the inulin and beta-cyclodextrin diets elicited high propionic acid fermentations in the cecum (approximately 45% of total short-chain fatty acids) with relatively low molar proportions of acetic and butyric acids. In rats fed the three experimental diets, 5-7 mumol/min of propionic acid was absorbed in the portal vein, and propionic acid was entirely metabolized by the liver. Plasma cholesterol was more effectively depressed by the beta-cyclodextrin diet than by the inulin diet; the propionic acid-supplemented diet was ineffective in this respect. The inulin diet slightly increased fecal bile acid excretion, compared with the control diet, whereas beta-cyclodextrin markedly enhanced (1.8-fold) bile acid excretion. Microsomal hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase activity was slightly depressed in rats fed the propionic acid-supplemented diet, whereas it was enhanced by the beta-cyclodextrin diet in parallel to the activity of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase. The present data suggest that absorption and further hepatic metabolism of large amounts of propionic acid are not sufficient to counteract the induction of HMG-CoA reductase resulting from bile acid fecal losses. The rise of these losses plays a major role in the hypocholesterolemic effect of beta-cyclodextrin.
The search for a precise metabolic explanation for the capacity of some individuals to resist the development of dietary-induced hypercholesterolemia, thus avoiding attendant cardiovascular atherosclerotic complications, has long been the focus of our research. From 1 New Zealand white rabbit that failed to show any cholesterolemic response, we have, over the course of 10 years, established a partially inbred strain of strongly cholesterol-resistant rabbits. This achievement has resulted in the production of a large number of cholesterol-resistant animals for study; more importantly, it has shown that a strong genetic factor operates in dietary regulation of plasma cholesterol levels. We have focused our research on the different possibilities associated with this genetic predisposition. Since the cholesterol-resistant rabbits do not accumulate cholesterol or its esters in plasma or in any tissue compartments, we investigated several biochemical pathways involved in cholesterol metabolism. We have recently concentrated on the enzyme cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase and liver bile acid metabolism. We have cloned the complete gene and partial cDNAs for cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase from both normal and cholesterol-resistant rabbits. This has allowed the discovery of changes in the transcription of this gene in the cholesterol-resistant rabbits compared with normal littermates. These cholesterol-resistant rabbits have provided a model demonstrating that there are biological means to prevent large dietary loads of cholesterol from accumulating in plasma or tissues. Our hypothesis is that cholesterol-resistant animals increase cholesterol turnover by increasing bile acid excretion, thus providing a way to reduce plasma cholesterol of either dietary or endogenous origin. The methods and observations of our research are presented chronologically in this review.
We studied the influence of glucagon on hepatic LDL receptors and plasma lipoproteins in rats. A dose-dependent (maximum, threefold) increase in LDL-receptor binding was evident already at a dose of 2 x 4 micrograms, and detectable 3 h after injection; concomitantly, cholesterol and apolipoprotein (apo) B and apoE within LDL and large HDL decreased in plasma. LDL receptor mRNA levels were however unaltered or reduced. Hepatic microsomal cholesterol was increased and the enzymatic activities of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase in hepatic microsomes were reduced. Insulin alone increased receptor binding and receptor mRNA levels twofold, but plasma cholesterol was unchanged and plasma apoE and apoB increased. Administration of insulin to glucagon-treated animals reduced the LDL-receptor binding to control levels and apoB appeared in LDL particles. Estrogen treatment increased LDL-receptor binding and mRNA levels five- and eightfold, respectively. Combined treatment with glucagon and estrogen reduced the stimulation of LDL-receptor mRNA levels by 80% although LDL-receptor binding was unchanged. Immunoblot analysis showed that glucagon increased the number of hepatic LDL receptors. We conclude that glucagon induces the number of hepatic LDL receptors by a mechanism not related to increased mRNA levels, suggesting the presence of a posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism present in the liver in vivo.
The four stereoisomers of the antifungal agent ketoconazole (1) were prepared and evaluated for their selectivity in inhibiting a number of cytochrome P-450 enzymes. Large differences in selectivity among the isomers were observed for inhibition of the cytochromes P-450 involved in steroid biosynthesis, whereas little differences was observed for inhibition of those associated with hepatic drug metabolism. The cis-(2S,4R) isomer 2 was the most effective against rat lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase, (2S,4R)-2 greater than (2R,4S)-4 much greater than (2R,4R)-3 = (2S,4S)-5, and progesterone 17 alpha,20-lyase, (2S,4R)-2 much greater than (2S,4S)-5 greater than (2R,4R)-3 = (2R,4S)-4, whereas the cis-(2R,4S) isomer 4 was more effective against cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, (2R,4S)-4 greater than (2S,4S)-5 greater than (2R,4R)-3, greater than (2S,4R)-2, and the trans-(2S,4S) isomer 5 was the most effective against aromatase, (2S,4R)-5 much greater than (2R,4R)-3 = (2R,4S)-4 greater than (2S,4R)-2. The cis-(2S,4R) and trans-(2R,4R) isomers 2 and 3 are equipotent in inhibiting corticoid 11 beta-hydroxylase and much more effective than their antipodes. Little selectivity was observed for inhibition of cholesterol side chain cleavage or xenobiotic hydroxylase. These data indicate that the affinity of azoles for cytochrome P-450 enzymes involved in steroid synthesis is highly dependent on the stereochemistry of the entire molecule, whereas binding to drug metabolizing enzymes is a less selective process.
We examined how total blockage of biliary excretion, the major pathway through which cholesterol and bile acids are removed from the body, affects liver function, cholesterol and bile acid metabolism and homoeostasis. After 4 weeks of bile-duct ligation, rats showed impaired liver function, as documented by elevations in serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase activity. Moreover, bile-duct ligation decreased by about 30% both the amount of microsomal cytochrome P-450 in the liver and the elimination of aminopyrine in vivo, a reliable index in vivo of microsomal mixed-function oxidase activity. Cholesterol and bile acid contents in livers of bile-duct-ligated rats were doubled compared with sham-operated controls. Despite the increase in the contents of cholesterol and bile acids in liver, activities of the respective rate-limiting enzymes, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, were doubled. Serum concentrations of bile acids and free cholesterol increased 25- and 4-fold respectively. The large increase in serum bile acids was associated with a 380-fold increase in the urinary excretion of bile acids. Although there is a general decrease in cytochrome P-450 content and drug metabolism involving cytochrome P-450-containing hydroxylases, the activity of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, also a cytochrome P-450-containing enzyme, is actually increased. These data show that complete obstruction of the bile duct results in the selective impairment of microsomal cytochrome P-450. Increased activity of 7 alpha-hydroxylase, bile acid synthesis and urinary excretion provides an alternative excretory pathway that helps to maintain cholesterol homoeostasis when the biliary excretory pathway is eliminated.
The effects of ketoconazole, an antimycotic agent, and metyrapone, an inhibitor of mixed function oxidases, on bile acid synthesis were compared in the rat both in vitro and in vivo. In rat liver microsomes, ketoconazole was much more potent than metyrapone in inhibiting the activity of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of bile acids. The I50 values were 0.42 microM and 0.91 mM for ketoconazole and metyrapone, respectively. Intraduodenal administration of ketoconazole caused a rapid, dose-dependent reduction of bile acid synthesis in eight-day bile diverted rats. A single dose of 50 mg/kg reduced bile acid synthesis to 5% of control value; the same dose of metyrapone caused a reduction to only 85%. Inhibition of bile acid synthesis by ketoconazole was followed by a marked overshoot. At 28 hr after injection of 50 mg/kg of the drug, formation of bile acids was stimulated maximally by 45% compared to control value and remained elevated for more than 20 hr thereafter. Synthesis of all primary bile acids was affected to the same extent. Cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity in livers of ketoconazole treated (30 mg/kg) rats with an intact enterohepatic circulation was increased by 70% at 16 hr after i.p. injection of the drug. During the very large decrease of biliary bile acid output with ketoconazole, bile flow rate was relatively increased, due to stimulation of the bile acid-independent fraction of bile flow. The latter effect can probably be explained as caused by biliary secretion of osmotically active metabolites of ketoconazole.
Hibernating mammals cease feeding during the winter and rely primarily on stored lipids to fuel alternating periods of torpor and arousal. How hibernators manage large fluxes of lipids and sterols over the annual hibernation cycle is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate lipid and cholesterol transport and storage in ground squirrels studied in spring, summer, and several hibernation states. Cholesterol levels in total plasma, HDL and LDL particles were elevated in hibernators compared with spring or summer squirrels. Hibernation increased plasma apolipoprotein A-I expression and HDL particle size. Expression of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase was 13-fold lower in hibernators than in active season squirrels. Plasma triglycerides were reduced by fasting in spring but not summer squirrels. In hibernators plasma β-hydroxybutyrate was elevated during torpor whereas triglycerides were low relative to normothermic states. We conclude that the switch to a lipid-based metabolism during winter, coupled with reduced capacity to excrete cholesterol creates a closed system in which efficient use of lipoproteins is essential for survival.
Spastic paraplegia type 5 (SPG5) is caused by mutations in CYP7B1, a gene encoding the cytochrome P-450 oxysterol 7-α-hydroxylase, CYP7B1, an enzyme implicated in the cholesterol metabolism. Mutations in CYP7B1 were found in both pure and complicated forms of the disease with a mutation frequency of 7.7% in pure recessive cases. The mutation frequency in complex forms, approximately 6.6%, is more controversial and needs to be refined. We studied in more detail the SPG5-related spectrum of complex phenotypes by screening CYPB1 for mutations in a large cohort of 105 Italian hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) index patients including 50 patients with a complicated HSP (cHSP) phenotype overlapping the SPG11- and the SPG15-related forms except for the lack of thin corpus callosum and 55 pure patients. Five CYP7B1 mutations, three of which are novel, were identified in four patients, two with a complex form of the disease and two with a pure phenotype. The CYP7B1 mutation frequencies obtained in both complicated and pure familial cases are comparable to the known ones. These results obtained extend the range of SPG5-related phenotypes and reveal variability in clinical presentation, disease course and functional profile in the SPG5-related patients while providing with some clues for molecular diagnosis in cHSP.
We aimed to characterize the primary abnormalities associated with fat accumulation and vulnerability to hepatocellular injury of obesity-related fatty liver. We performed functional analyses and comparative transcriptomics of isolated primary hepatocytes from livers of obese insulin-resistant Zucker rats (comprising mild to severe hepatic steatosis) and age-matched lean littermates, searching for novel genes linked to chronic hepatic steatosis. Of the tested genome, 1.6% was identified as steatosis linked. Overexpressed genes were mainly dedicated to primary metabolism (100%), signaling, and defense/acute phase (approximately 70%); detoxification, steroid, and sulfur metabolism (approximately 65%) as well as cell growth/proliferation and protein synthesis/transformation (approximately 70%) genes were downregulated. The overexpression of key genes involved in de novo lipogenesis, fatty acid and glycerolipid import and synthesis, as well as acetyl-CoA and cofactor provision was paralleled by enhanced hepatic lipogenesis and production of large triacylglycerol-rich VLDL. Greatest changes in gene expression were seen in those encoding the lipogenic malic enzyme (up to 7-fold increased) and cell-to-cell interacting cadherin 17 (up to 8-fold decreased). Among validated genes, fatty acid synthase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, fatty acid translocase/Cd36, malic enzyme, cholesterol-7 alpha hydroxylase, cadherin 17, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha significantly correlated with severity of hepatic steatosis. In conclusion, dysregulated expression of metabolic and survival genes accompany hepatic steatosis in obese insulin-resistant rats and may render steatotic hepatocytes more vulnerable to cell injury in progressive nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
The microsomal enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCoAR) is the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis and is highly regulated by a variety of factors. We have recently reported increased reductase activity during ageing, attributed to a higher activation state and impaired degradation of the hepatic enzyme. One of the widely recognized causes of age-related metabolic modifications is the large increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Therefore, the effect of ROS increase on the activity and the regulation of the HMGCoAR has been investigated in two different experimental models of ROS enriched tissue: liver from rats fed on diets deprived of either Vitamin E (Vit. E) or polyunsaturated fatty acids (Pufa). The results show that in these models, compared to that of old rats, full activation the HMGCoAR was detected while a different degradation rate is observed with the respect to old rats. Thus, our data show full correlation between ROS production and increased HMGCoAR activity. The possible therapeutic implications of these results are discussed.
Although the pool of cholesterol in the adult central nervous system (CNS) is large and of constant size, little is known of the process(es) involved in regulation of sterol turnover in this pool. In 7-week-old mice, net excretion of cholesterol from the brain equaled 1.4 mg/day/kg body weight, and from the whole animal was 179 mg/day/kg. Deletion of cholesterol 24-hydroxylase, an enzyme highly expressed in the CNS, did not alter brain growth or myelination, but reduced sterol excretion from the CNS 64% to 0.5 mg/day/kg. In mice with a mutation in the Niemann-Pick C gene that had ongoing neurodegeneration, sterol excretion from the CNS was increased to 2.3 mg/day/kg. Deletion of cholesterol 24-hydroxylase activity in these animals reduced net excretion only 22% to 1.8 mg/day/kg. Thus, at least two different pathways promote net sterol excretion from the CNS. One uses cholesterol 24-hydroxylase and may reflect sterol turnover in large neurons in the brain. The other probably involves the movement of cholesterol or one of its metabolites across the blood-brain barrier and may more closely mirror sterol turnover in pools such as glial cell membranes and myelin.
Bile formation and its canalicular secretion are essential functions of the mammalian liver. The sister-of-p-glycoprotein (spgp) gene was shown to encode the canalicular bile salt export protein, and mutations in spgp gene were identified as the cause of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 2. However, target inactivation of spgp gene in mice results in nonprogressive but persistent cholestasis and causes the secretion of unexpectedly large amounts of unknown tetrahydroxylated bile acid in the bile. The present study confirms the identity of this tetrahydroxylated bile acid as 3 alpha,6 beta,7 beta,12 alpha-tetrahydroxy-5 beta-cholan-24-oic acid. The data further show that in serum, liver, and urine of the spgp knockout mice, there is a significant increase in the concentration of total bile salts containing a large amount of tetrahydroxy-5 beta-cholan-24-oic acid. The increase in total bile acids was associated with up-regulation of the mRNA of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase in male mice only. It is suggested that the lower severity of the cholestasis in the spgp knockout mice may be due to the synthesis of 3 alpha,6 beta,7 beta,12 alpha-tetrahydroxy-5 beta-cholan-24-oic acid, which neutralizes in part the toxic effect of bile acids accumulated in the liver.
Ileal reclamation of bile salts is mediated in large part by an apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) located in the terminal ileum. The following studies were performed to elucidate the adaptive response of ASBT to intestinal resection. Two separate series of intestinal resections were performed: 1) limited (25%) ileal and 2) massive (70%) intestinal resection. The boundaries of the resections were varied to examine differences in compensation when variable amounts of endogenous transporter activity were resected. Previously demonstrated supraphysiologic expression of ASBT, which was seen after proximal ileal resection, led to a contraction in the bile acid pool size and a paradoxical reduction in bile acid (cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase and sterol 27-hydroxylase) and cholesterol (hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase) biosynthetic enzyme activities. Massive intestinal resection resulted in ileal hypertrophy and an apparently maladaptive specific down-regulation in ASBT protein expression. In this model bile acid pool size correlated with the amount of residual ASBT-expressing terminal ileum. Cholesterol and bile acid biosynthetic enzyme activities were inversely related to bile acid pool size. Adaptive changes in ASBT expression and alterations in bile acid and cholesterol homeostasis are dependent on the type and location of intestinal resection.
Dietary soluble fiber (SF) consistently lowers plasma LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations, however, secondary mechanisms governing this reduction are not completely defined. Moreover, these mechanisms appear to differ with gender. Male, female and ovariectomized (to mimic menopause) guinea pigs were used to assess effects of gender, hormonal status and SF on activity and expression of hepatic cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7). Diets were identical except for fiber source (control 10% cellulose, SF 5% psyllium/5% pectin). SF intake resulted in 44% lower plasma total cholesterol, 51% lower plasma LDL-C and 22% lower plasma triacylglycerol (TAG) concentrations. However, ovariectomized guinea pigs fed either the control or SF diets, had the highest plasma LDL-C and TAG levels (P&lt;0.01). SF altered hepatic cholesterol metabolism by effectively reducing hepatic free cholesterol, TAG and microsomal free cholesterol, while activity of CYP7, the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol catabolism, was up-regulated. Hepatic CYP7 mRNA abundance paralleled the increase in enzyme activity. Ovariectomized guinea pigs had lowest activity and expression of hepatic CYP7 even after intervention with SF. These results suggest that induction of hepatic CYP7 activity may account, in large part, for the hypocholesterolemic effect of SF. Gender and hormonal status influence metabolic responses to dietary SF with estrogen deprivation leading to the most detrimental lipid profile.
The gene for cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) contains a sequence at nt -149 to -118 that was found to play a large role in determining the overall transcriptional activity and regulation of the promoter. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II (COUP-TFII) synergistically activate transcription of the CYP7A1 promoter. Transactivation of CYP7A1 by HNF4 in the human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, was enhanced by cotransfection with COUP-TFII or the basal transcription element binding protein (BTEB). HNF4 prepared from rat liver nuclear extracts bound to oligomers homologous to the nt -146 to -134 sequences in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), which corresponded to a conserved region containing a direct repeat of hormone response elements spaced by one nucleotide (DR1). The sequences surrounding this DR1 were found to be essential for the HNF4 transactivation. In vitro-translated COUP-TFII was found to bind the adjacent sequences from nt -139 to -128 (DR0), but COUP-TFII interacted with this region at a much lower affinity than to the COUP-TFII-site at nt -72 to -57 (DR4). Mutations at nt -139 to -128 or nt -72 to -57 reduced the COUP-TFII and HNF4 synergy; however, these COUP-TFII-binding sequences were not absolutely required for the cooperative effect of HNF4 and COUP-TFII on transactivation. These results indicated that the observed transactivation was the result of protein/protein interactions facilitated by the juxtaposition of the binding elements.
The benefits of plant sterols (PSs) for cholesterol lowering are hampered by large heterogeneity across individuals, potentially because of genetic polymorphisms.
We investigated the impact of candidate genetic variations on cholesterol response to PSs in a trial that recruited individuals with high or low endogenous cholesterol synthesis, estimated by lathosterol to cholesterol (L:C) ratio.
Mildly hypercholesterolemic adults preselected as possessing either high endogenous cholesterol synthesis (n = 24; mean ± SEM: L:C ratio = 2.03 ± 0.39 μmol/mmol) or low endogenous cholesterol synthesis (n = 39; mean ± SEM: L:C ratio = 0.99 ± 0.28 μmol/mmol) consumed 2 g PS/d or a placebo for 28 d by using a dual-center, single-blind, randomized crossover design. Cholesterol synthesis and change in cholesterol absorption were measured with stable isotopic tracers. Candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms and apolipoprotein E (APOE) isoform were assessed by TaqMan genotyping assay.
The cholesterol fractional synthesis rate was higher (P &lt; 0.001) in participants with high endogenous cholesterol synthesis (mean ± SEM: placebo: 9.16% ± 0.47%; PSs: 9.74% ± 0.47%) than in participants with low endogenous cholesterol synthesis (mean ± SEM placebo: 5.72% ± 0.43%; PS: 7.10% ± 0.43%). Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lowering in response to PSs was associated with individuals' genotypes. Cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1-rs3808607) T/T homozygotes showed no LDL cholesterol lowering (mean ± SEM: -0.05 ± 0.07 mmol/L, P = 0.9999, n = 20), whereas the presence of the G-allele associated with LDL cholesterol response in a dose-dependent fashion (mean ± SEM G/T: -0.22 ± 0.06 mmol/L, P = 0.0006, n = 35; G/G: -0.46 ± 0.12 mmol/L, P = 0.0009, n = 8). Similarly, APOE ɛ3 carriers (mean ± SEM: -0.13 ± 0.05 mmol/L, P = 0.0370, n = 40) responded less than APOE ɛ4 carriers (mean ± SEM: -0.31 ± 0.07 mmol/L, P &lt; 0.0001, n = 23). Moreover, genoset CYP7A1-rs3808607 T/T/APOE ɛ3 was associated with nonresponsiveness (mean ± SEM: +0.09 ± 0.08 mmol/L, P = 0.9999, n = 14). rs5882 in cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) and rs4148217 in ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 8 (ABCG8) did not associate with LDL cholesterol lowering. Cholesterol absorption decreased as a result of PS consumption, but this decrease was not related to circulating LDL cholesterol concentrations, cholesterol synthesis phenotype, or genotypes.
CYP7A1-rs3808607 and APOE isoform are associated with the extent of reduction in circulating LDL cholesterol in response to PS consumption and could serve as potential predictive genetic markers to identify individuals who would derive maximum LDL cholesterol lowering with PS consumption. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01131832.
In vertebrates, bile salts are primarily synthesized in the liver and secreted into the intestine where they aid in absorption of dietary fats. Small amounts of bile salts that are not reabsorbed into enterohepatic circulation are excreted with waste. In sexually mature male sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus L.) a bile salt is released in large amounts across gill epithelia into water where it functions as a pheromone. We postulate that the release of this pheromone is associated with a dramatic increase in its biosynthesis and transport to the gills upon sexual maturation.
We show an 8000-fold increase in transcription of cyp7a1, a three-fold increase in transcription of cyp27a1, and a six-fold increase in transcription of cyp8b1 in the liver of mature male sea lamprey over immature male adults. LC-MS/MS data on tissue-specific distribution and release rates of bile salts from mature males show a high concentration of petromyzonol sulfate (PZS) in the liver and gills of mature males. 3-keto petromyzonol sulfate (3kPZS, known as a male sex pheromone) is the primary compound released from gills, suggesting a conversion of PZS to 3kPZS in the gill epithelium. The PZS to 3kPZS conversion is supported by greater expression of hsd3b7 in gill epithelium. High expression of sult2b1 and sult2a1 in gill epithelia of mature males, and tissue-specific expression of bile salt transporters such as bsep, slc10a1, and slc10a2, suggest additional sulfation and transport of bile salts that are dependent upon maturation state.
This report presents a rare example where specific genes associated with biosynthesis and release of a sexual pheromone are dramatically upregulated upon sexual maturation in a vertebrate. We provide a well characterized example of a complex mechanism of bile salt biosynthesis and excretion that has likely evolved for an additional function of bile salts as a mating pheromone.
The three major pathways of lipoprotein metabolism provide a superb paradigm to delineate systematically the familial dyslipoproteinemias. Such understanding leads to improved diagnosis and treatment of patients. In the exogenous (intestinal) pathway, defects in LPL, apoC-II, APOA-V, and GPIHBP1 disrupt the catabolism of chylomicrons and hepatic uptake of their remnants, producing very high TG. In the endogenous (hepatic) pathway, six disorders affect the activity of the LDLR and markedly increase LDL. These include FH, FDB, ARH, PCSK9 gain-of-function mutations, sitosterolemia and loss of 7 alpha hydroxylase. Hepatic overproduction of VLDL occurs in FCHL, hyperapoB, LDL subclass pattern B, FDH and syndrome X, often due to insulin resistance and resulting in high TG, elevated small LDL particles and low HDL-C. Defects in APOB-100 and loss-of-function mutations in PCSK9 are associated with low LDL-C, decreased CVD and longevity. An absence of MTP leads to marked reduction in chylomicrons and VLDL, causing abetalipoproteinemia. In the reverse cholesterol pathway, deletions or nonsense mutations in apoA-I or ABCA1 transporter disrupt the formation of the nascent HDL particle. Mutations in LCAT disrupt esterification of cholesterol in nascent HDL by LCAT and apoA-1, and formation of spherical HDL. Mutations in either CETP or SR-B1 and familial high HDL lead to increased large HDL particles, the effect of which on CVD is not resolved. The major goal is to prevent or ameliorate the major complications of many familial dyslipoproteinemias, namely, premature CVD or pancreatitis. Dietary and drug treatment specific for each inherited disorder is reviewed.
A long-standing problem in primate evolution is the discord between paleontological and molecular clock estimates for the time of crown primate origins: the earliest crown primate fossils are ~56 million y (Ma) old, whereas molecular estimates for the haplorhine-strepsirrhine split are often deep in the Late Cretaceous. One explanation for this phenomenon is that crown primates existed in the Cretaceous but that their fossil remains have not yet been found. Here we provide strong evidence that this discordance is better-explained by a convergent molecular rate slowdown in early primate evolution. We show that molecular rates in primates are strongly and inversely related to three life-history correlates: body size (BS), absolute endocranial volume (EV), and relative endocranial volume (REV). Critically, these traits can be reconstructed from fossils, allowing molecular rates to be predicted for extinct primates. To this end, we modeled the evolutionary history of BS, EV, and REV using data from both extinct and extant primates. We show that the primate last common ancestor had a very small BS, EV, and REV. There has been a subsequent convergent increase in BS, EV, and REV, indicating that there has also been a convergent molecular rate slowdown over primate evolution. We generated a unique timescale for primates by predicting molecular rates from the reconstructed phenotypic values for a large phylogeny of living and extinct primates. This analysis suggests that crown primates originated close to the K-Pg boundary and possibly in the Paleocene, largely reconciling the molecular and fossil timescales of primate evolution.
The aim of this study was to analyze the expression patterns of key genes involved in lipid metabolism in response to short term fasting in chicks (Gallus gallus). The mRNA level of the genes was analyzed after 0, 2, and 4 h of fasting in the liver and white adipose tissue. In the liver, the mRNA level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α was significantly increased after 2 h of fasting. The mRNA levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a and acyl-CoA oxidase were significantly increased after 4 h of fasting. In contrast, the mRNA levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1, acetyl-CoA carboxylase α, and fatty acid synthase were significantly decreased after 4 h of fasting. The mRNA levels of cholesterol metabolism-related genes such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase and cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase were significantly decreased after 4 h of fasting. In the white adipose tissue, the mRNA level of adipose triglyceride lipase was significantly increased after 4 h of fasting. In contrast, the mRNA levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and lipoprotein lipase were significantly decreased after 4 h of fasting. These results demonstrated that the gene expression of lipid metabolism-related genes is regulated by short term fasting in both the liver and WAT in chicks.
To study the origin of fat excess in the livers of morbidly obese (MO) individuals, we analysed lipids and lipases in both plasma and liver and genes involved in lipid transport, or related with, in that organ.
Thirty-two MO patients were grouped according to the absence (healthy: DM - DL -) or presence of comorbidities (dyslipidemic: DM - DL +; or dyslipidemic with type 2 diabetes: DM + DL +) before and one year after gastric bypass.
The livers of healthy, DL and DM patients contained more lipids (9.8, 9.5 and 13.7 times, respectively) than those of control subjects. The genes implicated in liver lipid uptake, including HL, LPL, VLDLr, and FAT/CD36, showed increased expression compared with the controls. The expression of genes involved in lipid-related processes outside of the liver, such as apoB, PPARα and PGC1α, CYP7a1 and HMGCR, was reduced in these patients compared with the controls. PAI1 and TNFα gene expression in the diabetic livers was increased compared with the other obese groups and control group. Increased steatosis and fibrosis were also noted in the MO individuals.
Hepatic lipid parameters in MO patients change based on their comorbidities. The gene expression and lipid levels after bariatric surgery were less prominent in the diabetic patients. Lipid receptor overexpression could enable the liver to capture circulating lipids, thus favouring the steatosis typically observed in diabetic and dyslipidaemic MO individuals.
The ileal lipid binding protein (ilbp) is a cytoplasmic protein that binds bile acids with high affinity. However evidence demonstrating the role of this protein in bile acid transport and homeostasis is missing. We created a mouse strain lacking ilbp (Fabp6(-/-) mice) and assessed the impact of ilbp deficiency on bile acid homeostasis and transport in vivo. Elimination of ilbp increased fecal bile acid excretion (54.2%, P&lt;0.05) in female but not male Fabp6(-/-) mice. The activity of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (cyp7a1), the rate-controlling enzyme of the classical bile acid biosynthetic pathway, was significantly increased in female (63.5%, P&lt;0.05) but not in male Fabp6(-/-) mice. The amount of [(3)H]taurocholic acid (TCA) excreted by 24 h after oral administration was 102% (P&lt;0.025) higher for female Fabp6(-/-) mice whereas it was 57.3% (P&lt;0.01) lower for male Fabp6(-/-) mice, compared to wild-type mice. The retained fraction of the [(3)H]TCA localized in the small and large intestines was increased by 22% (P&lt;0.02) and decreased by 62.7% (P&lt;0.01), respectively, in male Fabp6(-/-) mice relative wild-type mice, whereas no changes were seen in female Fabp6(-/-) mice. Mucosal to serosal bile acid transport using everted distal gut sacs was decreased by 74% (P&lt;0.03) in both sexes of Fabp6(-/-) mice as compared to wild-type mice. The results demonstrate that ilbp is involved in the apical to basolateral transport of bile acids in ileal enterocytes, and is vital for the maintenance of bile acid homeostasis in the enterohepatic circulation (EHC) in mice.
We reported previously that monkey embryonic stem cells (ESCs) were differentiated into hepatocytes by formation of embryoid bodies (EBs). However, this EB formation method is not always efficient for assays using a large number of samples simultaneously. A dispersion culture system, one of the differentiation methods without EB formation, is able to more efficiently provide a large number of feeder-free undifferentiated cells. A previous study demonstrated the effectiveness of the Rho-associated kinase inhibitor Y-27632 for feeder-free dispersion culture and induction of differentiation of monkey ESCs into neural cells. In the present study, the induction of differentiation of cynomolgus monkey ESCs (cmESCs) into hepatocytes was performed by the dispersion culture method, and the expression and drug inducibility of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in these hepatocytes were examined. The cmESCs were successfully differentiated into hepatocytes under feeder-free dispersion culture conditions supplemented with Y-27632. The hepatocytes differentiated from cmESCs expressed the mRNAs for three hepatocyte marker genes (α-fetoprotein, albumin, CYP7A1) and several CYP enzymes, as measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. In particular, the basal expression of cmCYP3A4 (3A8) in these hepatocytes was detected at mRNA and enzyme activity (testosterone 6β-hydroxylation) levels. Furthermore, the expression and activity of cmCYP3A4 (3A8) were significantly upregulated by rifampicin. These results indicated the effectiveness of Y-27632 supplementation for feeder-free dispersed culture and induction of differentiation into hepatocytes, and the expression of functional CYP enzyme(s) in cmESC-derived hepatic cells.
A recent, large genome-wide association study (GWAS) of European ancestry individuals has identified multiple genetic variants influencing serum lipids. Studies of the transferability of these associations to African Americans remain few, an important limitation given interethnic differences in serum lipids and the disproportionate burden of lipid-associated metabolic diseases among African Americans.
We attempted to evaluate the transferability of 95 lipid-associated loci recently identified in European ancestry individuals to 887 non-diabetic, unrelated African Americans from a population-based sample in the Washington, DC area. Additionally, we took advantage of the generally reduced linkage disequilibrium among African ancestry populations in comparison to European ancestry populations to fine-map replicated GWAS signals.
We successfully replicated reported associations for 10 loci (CILP2/SF4, STARD3, LPL, CYP7A1, DOCK7/ANGPTL3, APOE, SORT1, IRS1, CETP, and UBASH3B). Through trans-ethnic fine-mapping, we were able to reduce associated regions around 75% of the loci that replicated.
Between this study and previous work in African Americans, 40 of the 95 loci reported in a large GWAS of European ancestry individuals also influence lipid levels in African Americans. While there is now evidence that the lipid-influencing role of a number of genetic variants is observed in both European and African ancestry populations, the still considerable lack of concordance highlights the importance of continued ancestry-specific studies to elucidate the genetic underpinnings of these traits.
Inclusion of plant protein sources such as soyabean meal (SBM) in aquafeeds is associated with decreased lipid digestibility, reduced bile acid levels and hypocholesterolaemia. The mechanism for these metabolic abnormalities is unknown. The present study aimed at gaining further insight into how cholesterol and bile acid metabolism is modulated by SBM feeding by quantifying a number of mRNA species corresponding to key proteins involved in cholesterol and bile acid metabolism using quantitative real-time PCR. A 21 d feeding trial with sequential sampling at ten time points following initiation of 20% SBM exposure was conducted on Atlantic salmon. A histological evaluation confirmed distal intestinal enteritis after 5 d of dietary exposure to the SBM, whereas diminished glycogen/lipid deposition was the only relevant finding observed in the liver. SBM inclusion resulted in reduced body pools of cholesterol and bile acids. Hepatic gene expression profiles revealed up-regulation of genes encoding rate-limiting enzymes in cholesterol (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase; HMGCR) and bile acid (cytochrome P4507A1 (CYP7A1)) biosynthesis, as well as up-regulation of their associated transcription factors (sterol regulatory element binding proteins 1 and 2, liver X receptor, farnesoid X receptor and PPAR isoforms). Hepatic gene expressions of cholesterol (ATP binding cassette G5 (ABCG5)) and bile acid (ATP binding cassette B11 (ABCB11)) transporters were, by and large, not influenced by the SBM, but distal intestinal expression patterns of ABCG5 and apical Na-dependent bile acid transporter indicated impaired cholesterol and bile acid reabsorption. In conclusion, hepatic gene expression profiles indicated that the capacity for cholesterol and bile acid synthesis was up-regulated, whereas the indicated impaired cholesterol and bile acid reabsorption probably occurred as a direct result of distal intestinal inflammation.
Sex-differences in human liver gene expression were characterized on a genome-wide scale using a large liver sample collection, allowing for detection of small expression differences with high statistical power. 1,249 sex-biased genes were identified, 70% showing higher expression in females. Chromosomal bias was apparent, with female-biased genes enriched on chrX and male-biased genes enriched on chrY and chr19, where 11 male-biased zinc-finger KRAB-repressor domain genes are distributed in six clusters. Top biological functions and diseases significantly enriched in sex-biased genes include transcription, chromatin organization and modification, sexual reproduction, lipid metabolism and cardiovascular disease. Notably, sex-biased genes are enriched at loci associated with polygenic dyslipidemia and coronary artery disease in genome-wide association studies. Moreover, of the 8 sex-biased genes at these loci, 4 have been directly linked to monogenic disorders of lipid metabolism and show an expression profile in females (elevated expression of ABCA1, APOA5 and LDLR; reduced expression of LIPC) that is consistent with the lower female risk of coronary artery disease. Female-biased expression was also observed for CYP7A1, which is activated by drugs used to treat hypercholesterolemia. Several sex-biased drug-metabolizing enzyme genes were identified, including members of the CYP, UGT, GPX and ALDH families. Half of 879 mouse orthologs, including many genes of lipid metabolism and homeostasis, show growth hormone-regulated sex-biased expression in mouse liver, suggesting growth hormone might play a similar regulatory role in human liver. Finally, the evolutionary rate of protein coding regions for human-mouse orthologs, revealed by dN/dS ratio, is significantly higher for genes showing the same sex-bias in both species than for non-sex-biased genes. These findings establish that human hepatic sex differences are widespread and affect diverse cell metabolic processes, and may help explain sex differences in lipid profiles associated with sex differential risk of coronary artery disease.
The Toxicogenomics Project is a 5-year collaborative project by the Japanese government and pharmaceutical companies in 2002. Its aim is to construct a large-scale toxicology database of 150 compounds orally administered to rats. The test consists of a single administration test (3, 6, 9 and 24 h) and a repeated administration test (3, 7, 14 and 28 days), and the conventional toxicology data together with the gene expression data in liver as analyzed by using Affymetrix GeneChip are being accumulated. In the project, either methylcellulose or corn oil is employed as vehicle. We examined whether the vehicle itself affects the analysis of gene expression and found that corn oil alone affected the food consumption and biochemical parameters mainly related to lipid metabolism, and this accompanied typical changes in the gene expression. Most of the genes modulated by corn oil were related to cholesterol or fatty acid metabolism (e.g., CYP7A1, CYP8B1, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A reductase, squalene epoxidase, angiopoietin-like protein 4, fatty acid synthase, fatty acid binding proteins), suggesting that the response was physiologic to the oil intake. Many of the lipid-related genes showed circadian rhythm within a day, but the expression pattern of general clock genes (e.g., period 2, arylhydrocarbon nuclear receptor translocator-like, D site albumin promoter binding protein) were unaffected by corn oil, suggesting that the effects are specific for lipid metabolism. These results would be useful for usage of the database especially when drugs with different vehicle control are compared.
Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) result from complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors. The evidence supports that gene-environment interactions modulate plasma lipid concentrations and potentially CVD risk. The findings from studies examining gene-diet interactions and lipid metabolism have been promising. Several loci (eg, APOA1, APOE, LIPC) are providing proof of concept for the application of genetics in the context of personalized nutrition for CVD prevention. The spectrum of candidate genes has been expanding to incorporate those involved in intracellular lipid metabolism (eg, iPPARs, CYP7A1). However, the practical application of these findings is not ready for prime time. There is a compelling need for replication using a higher level of scientific evidence. Moreover, we need to evolve from the simple scenarios examined nowadays (ie, one single dietary component, SNP, and risk factor) to more realistic situations involving multiple interactions. In summary, there is need for both large population studies and well-standardized intervention studies.
Differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to specific functional cell types can be achieved using methods that mimic in vivo embryonic developmental programs. Current protocols for generating hepatocytes from hESCs are hampered by inefficient differentiation procedures that lead to low yields and large cellular heterogeneity. We report here a robust and highly efficient process for the generation of high-purity (70%) hepatocyte cultures from hESCs that parallels sequential hepatic development in vivo. Highly enriched populations of definitive endoderm were generated from hESCs and then induced to differentiate along the hepatic lineage by the sequential addition of inducing factors implicated in physiological hepatogenesis. The differentiation process was largely uniform, with cell cultures progressively expressing increasing numbers of hepatic lineage markers, including GATA4, HNF4alpha, alpha-fetoprotein, CD26, albumin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, Cyp7A1, and Cyp3A4. The hepatocytes exhibited functional hepatic characteristics, such as glycogen storage, indocyanine green uptake and release, and albumin secretion. In a mouse model of acute liver injury, the hESC-derived definitive endoderm differentiated into hepatocytes and repopulated the damaged liver. The methodology described here represents a significant step toward the efficient generation of hepatocytes for use in regenerative medicine and drug discovery.
We studied bile acid and cholesterol metabolism in insulin-dependent diabetes utilizing genetically modified mice unable to synthesize cholic acid (Cyp8b1-/-). Diabetes was induced in Cyp8b1-/- and wild type animals (Cyp8b1+/+) by alloxan, and the mice were fed normal or cholesterol-enriched diet for 10 weeks. The serum levels of cholesterol were strongly increased in diabetic Cyp8b1+/+ mice fed cholesterol, while diabetic Cyp8b1-/- mice did not show any aberrations regardless of the diet. Diabetic cholesterol-fed Cyp8b1+/+ mice had much higher biliary cholesterol and cholesterol saturation index than all other groups, their bile contained a large number of cholesterol crystals, and their canalicular cholesterol transporter Abcg5/g8 mRNA levels were much higher. Cyp7a1 mRNA levels were similar in all diabetic mice but higher compared to non-diabetic animals. The results indicate a critical role for cholic acid for the development of hypercholesterolemia and gallstones in our animal model.
A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 280 cases identified the hepatic cholesterol transporter ABCG8 as a locus associated with risk for gallstone disease, but findings have not been reported from any other GWAS of this phenotype. We performed a large-scale, meta-analysis of GWASs of individuals of European ancestry with available prior genotype data, to identify additional genetic risk factors for gallstone disease.
We obtained per-allele odds ratio (OR) and standard error estimates using age- and sex-adjusted logistic regression models within each of the 10 discovery studies (8720 cases and 55,152 controls). We performed an inverse variance weighted, fixed-effects meta-analysis of study-specific estimates to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms that were associated independently with gallstone disease. Associations were replicated in 6489 cases and 62,797 controls.
We observed independent associations for 2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms at the ABCG8 locus: rs11887534 (OR, 1.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.54-1.86; P = 2.44 × 10(-60)) and rs4245791 (OR, 1.27; P = 1.90 × 10(-34)). We also identified and/or replicated associations for rs9843304 in TM4SF4 (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.08-1.16; P = 6.09 × 10(-11)), rs2547231 in SULT2A1 (encodes a sulfoconjugation enzyme that acts on hydroxysteroids and cholesterol-derived sterol bile acids) (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.12-1.21; P = 2.24 × 10(-10)), rs1260326 in glucokinase regulatory protein (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.07-1.17; P = 2.55 × 10(-10)), and rs6471717 near CYP7A1 (encodes an enzyme that catalyzes conversion of cholesterol to primary bile acids) (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.08-1.15; P = 8.84 × 10(-9)). Among individuals of African American and Hispanic American ancestry, rs11887534 and rs4245791 were associated positively with gallstone disease risk, whereas the association for the rs1260326 variant was inverse.
In this large-scale GWAS of gallstone disease, we identified 4 loci in genes that have putative functions in cholesterol metabolism and transport, and sulfonylation of bile acids or hydroxysteroids.
Statins form the backbone of lipid-lowering therapy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. However, there is large interindividual variability in clinical response to statin treatment. Several gene variants that can be aligned to either the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of statin have been proposed as potentially important determinants of statin response. We aimed to study the association of known variations in SLCO1B1, CYP3A4, ABCB1, CYP3A5, ABCG5 and CYP7A1 genes with lipid levels in response to atorvastatin therapy.
Genotypes were determined using multiplex allele-specific polymerase chain reaction in 177 Indian patients, treated with 10 mg of atorvastatin for 8 weeks. Low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were recorded at baseline and after 8 weeks of atorvastatin treatment.
A total of 177 hypercholesterolaemic patients were genotyped to study genetic determinants of atorvastatin response. The genotype distribution for all polymorphisms investigated was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. In our study, patients with wild-type genotypes of CYP7A1 (rs3808607), CYP3A4 (rs2740574), SLCO1B1 (rs2306283) and variant allele-carrying genotype of ABCB1 (rs2032582, rs1045642) showed significantly greater LDL-cholesterol reductions in response to atorvastatin therapy.
The variable response to atorvastatin therapy in terms of LDL-cholesterol lowering due to genetic variations in CYP7A1, CYP3A4, SLCO1B1 and ABCB1 is a promising finding. Further validation in large Indian cohorts is required before it can be assessed for clinical utility.
Tanshinone IIA is an active component of the traditional Chinese medicine. This study aimed at investigating the mechanism of tanshinone IIA on anti-atherosclerosis, which may be because of that Tanshinone IIA can affect the HDL subfractions distribution and then regulate reverse cholesterol transport.
A model of hyperlipidaemia in rats was used. Tanshinone IIA was given daily after hyperlipidaemia. In vivo, lipid deposition and morphological changes in liver were analyzed; HDL subfractions and lipid level in serum as well as in liver were measured; the expression of genes related to cholesterol intake in liver and peritoneal macrophage cholesterol efflux were evaluated. In vitro, HepG2 cells and THP-1 cells were pretreated with tanshinone IIA and subsequently with ox-LDL to evaluate the total cholesterol and the expression of related genes.
Tanshinone IIA reduced the lipid deposition in liver. Moreover, it did not affect the serum lipid levels but reduced the levels of HDL middle subfractions and increased the levels of HDL large subfractions. Furthermore, tanshinone IIA could regulate the expressions of CYP7A1, LDL-R, SREBP2 and LCAT in the liver as well as the ABCA1 and CD36 in macrophage cells which is involving in the cholesterol intake and efflux respectively. It could reduce lipid accumulation caused by ox-LDL induction, and that also regulate the expressions of LDL-R, HMGCR and SREBP2 in HepG2 and ABCA1, CD36 in THP-1 cells.
A novel finding that tanshinone IIA was not reduce the serum lipid level but affects the HDL subfractions distribution and thereby regulating the intake and efflux of cholesterol.
As legacy toxicogenomics databases have become available, improved data mining approaches are now key to extracting and visualizing subtle relationships between toxicants and gene expression. In the present study, a novel "aggregating bundles of clusters" (ABC) procedure was applied to separate cholestatic from non-cholestatic drugs and model toxicants in the Johnson &amp; Johnson (Janssen) rat liver toxicogenomics database [3]. Drug-induced cholestasis is an important issue, particularly when a new compound enters the market with this liability, with standard preclinical models often mispredicting this toxicity. Three well-characterized cholestasis-responsive genes (Cyp7a1, Mrp3 and Bsep) were chosen from a previous in-house Janssen gene expression signature; these three genes show differing, non-redundant responses across the 90+ paradigm compounds in our database. Using the ABC procedure, extraneous contributions were minimized in comparisons of compound gene responses. All genes were assigned weights proportional to their correlations with Cyp7a1, Mrp3 and Bsep, and a resampling technique was used to derive a stable measure of compound similarity. The compounds that were known to be associated with rat cholestasis generally had small values of this measure relative to each other but also had large values of this measure relative to non-cholestatic compounds. Visualization of the data with the ABC-derived signature showed a very tight, essentially identically behaving cluster of robust human cholestatic drugs and experimental cholestatic toxicants (ethinyl estradiol, LPS, ANIT and methylene dianiline, disulfiram, naltrexone, methapyrilene, phenacetin, alpha-methyl dopa, flutamide, the NSAIDs--indomethacin, flurbiprofen, diclofenac, flufenamic acid, sulindac, and nimesulide, butylated hydroxytoluene, piperonyl butoxide, and bromobenzene), some slightly less active compounds (3'-acetamidofluorene, amsacrine, hydralazine, tannic acid), some drugs that behaved very differently, and were distinct from both non-cholestatic and cholestatic drugs (ketoconazole, dipyridamole, cyproheptadine and aniline), and many postulated human cholestatic drugs that in rat showed no evidence of cholestasis (chlorpromazine, erythromycin, niacin, captopril, dapsone, rifampicin, glibenclamide, simvastatin, furosemide, tamoxifen, and sulfamethoxazole). Most of these latter drugs were noted previously by other groups as showing cholestasis only in humans. The results of this work suggest that the ABC procedure and similar statistical approaches can be instrumental in combining data to compare toxicants across toxicogenomics databases, extract similarities among responses and reduce unexplained data varation.
The liver is a unique organ in the body as it has significant roles in both metabolism and innate immune clearance. Hepatocytes in the liver carry a nearly complete complement of drug metabolizing enzymes, including numerous cytochrome P450s. While a majority of these enzymes effectively detoxify xenobiotics, or metabolize endobiotics, a subportion of these reactions result in accumulation of metabolites that can cause either direct liver injury or indirect liver injury through activation of inflammation. The liver also contains multiple populations of innate immune cells including the resident macrophages (Kupffer cells), a relatively large number of natural killer cells, and blood-derived neutrophils. While these cells are primarily responsible for clearance of pathogens, activation of these immune cells can result in significant tissue injury during periods of inflammation. When activated chronically, these inflammatory bouts can lead to fibrosis, cirrhosis, cancer, or death. This chapter will focus on interactions between how the liver processes xenobiotic and endobiotic compounds through the cytochrome P450 system, and how these processes can result in a response from the innate immune cells of the liver. A number of different clinically relevant diseases, as well as experimental models, are currently available to study mechanisms related to the interplay of innate immunity and cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism. A major focus of the chapter will be to evaluate currently understood mechanisms in the context of these diseases, as a way of outlining mechanisms that dictate the interactions between the P450 system and innate immunity. 
Psychological stress is a risk factor for atherosclerosis, yet the pathophysiological mechanisms involved remain elusive. The transfer of cholesterol from macrophage foam cells to liver and feces (the macrophage-specific reverse cholesterol transport, m-RCT) is an important antiatherogenic pathway. Because exposure of mice to physical restraint, a model of psychological stress, increases serum levels of corticosterone, and as bile acid homeostasis is disrupted in glucocorticoid-treated animals, we investigated if chronic intermittent restraint stress would modify m-RCT by altering the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids. C57Bl/6J mice exposed to intermittent stress for 5 days exhibited increased transit through the large intestine and enhanced fecal bile acid excretion. Of the transcription factors and transporters that regulate bile acid homeostasis, the mRNA expression levels of the hepatic farnesoid X receptor (FXR), the bile salt export pump (BSEP), and the intestinal fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15) were reduced, whereas those of the ileal apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT), responsible for active bile acid absorption, remained unchanged. Neither did the hepatic expression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the key enzyme regulating bile acid synthesis, change in the stressed mice. Evaluation of the functionality of the m-RCT pathway revealed increased fecal excretion of bile acids that had been synthesized from macrophage-derived cholesterol. Overall, our study reveals that chronic intermittent stress in mice accelerates m-RCT specifically by increasing fecal excretion of bile acids. This novel mechanism of m-RCT induction could have antiatherogenic potential under conditions of chronic stress. 
To explore the intervention of Huayu Qutan Recipe (HQR) on liver SREBP-2 signal pathway of hyperlipidemia rats of Pi deficiency syndrome (PDS).
Totally 100 SPF grade SD rats were randomly divided into the blank control group, the hyperlipidemia group, the hyperlipidemia treatment group, the PDS hyperlipidemia group, and the PDS hyperlipidemia treatment group, 20 in each group. Common granular forage was fed to rats in the blank control group. High fat forage was fed to rats in the hyperlipidemia group and the hyperlipidemia treatment group. Rats in the PDS hyperlipidemia group and the PDS hyperlipidemia treatment group were treated with excessive labor and improper diet for modeling. They were administered refined lard by gastrogavage (3 mL each time, twice per day) and fed with high fat forage on the odd days, and fed with wild cabbage freely on even days. The modeling lasted for 30 days. Rats in the hyperlipidemia treatment group and PDS hyperlipidemia treatment group were administered with Huayu Qutan Recipe (20 mL/kg) by gastrogavage, once a day, for 30 successive days. Levels of serum cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and serum amylase (AMY) were detected by automatic biochemical analyzer. D-xylose excretion rate was determined using phloroglucinol method. Morphological changes of liver and the lipid deposition in liver were observed using HE stain and oil red O stain respectively, mRNA and protein expression levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase 1 (CYP7A1), LDL-R, and sterol regulatory element binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) were detected using real time RT-PCR and Western blotting.
Compared with the blank control group, serum levels of TC (1.84 ± 0.19 mmol/L, 2.23 ± 0.43 mmol/L) and LDL-C (0.99 ± 0.24 mmol/L, 1.13 ± 0.56 mmol/L) were higher in the hyperlipidemia group and the PDS hyperlipidemia group, serum levels of HDL-C (0.41 ± 0.66 mmol/L, 0.41 ± 0.11 mmol/L) and AMY activities (351 ± 45 mmol/L, 153 ± 30 mmol/L) were lower, and urinary D-xylose excretion rates were lower (26.9 ± 2.1 ng/mL, 15.0 ± 1.7 ng/mL) (all P &lt; 0.05). Lipid deposition occurred in liver cells. Much fat vacuoles occurred in the cytoplasm. Expression levels of HMGCR, CYP7A1, LDL-R, and SREBP-2 mRNA and proteins in liver significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.01). Compared with the hyperlipidemia group, serum levels of TC and LDL-C significantly increased (P &lt; 0. 05), AMY activities and urinary D-xylose excre- tion rates significantly decreased in the PDS hyperlipidemia group (P &lt; 0.01). A large amount of lipid deposition occurred in liver. The atrophy of liver cells was obviously seen. Expression levels of CYP7A1, LDL-R, and SREBP-2 mRNA and proteins in liver were significantly lower (P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.05). Serum levels of TC and LDL-C significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.05), AMY activities and urinary D-xylose excretion rates significantly increased in the hyperlipidemia treatment group (P &lt; 0.01). Expression levels of CYP7A1, LDL-R, and SREBP-2 mRNA and proteins in liver were significantly increased (P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.05). Compared with the PDS hyperlipidemia group, serum level of TC significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.05), HDL-C levels, AMY activities and urinary D-xylose excretion rates significantly increased in the PDS hyperlipidemia treatment group (P &lt; 0.01),expression levels of CYP7A1, LDL-R, and SREBP-2 mRNA and proteins in liver were significantly increased (P &lt; 0.01). Similar changes occurred in the two treatment groups.
Pi deficiency exacerbates abnormal serum TC level and the lipid deposition in liver. These might be related to regulating expression levels of LDL-R, HMGCR, and CYP7A1 genes in the SREBP-2 signal pathway. HQR could regulate this pathway to intervene abnormal metabolism of TC.
A capability for analyzing complex cellular communication among tissues is important in drug discovery and development, and in vitro technologies for doing so are required for human applications. A prominent instance is communication between the gut and the liver, whereby perturbations of one tissue can influence behavior of the other. Here, we present a study on human gut-liver tissue interactions under normal and inflammatory contexts, via an integrative multi-organ platform comprising human liver (hepatocytes and Kupffer cells), and intestinal (enterocytes, goblet cells, and dendritic cells) models. Our results demonstrated long-term (&gt;2 weeks) maintenance of intestinal (e.g., barrier integrity) and hepatic (e.g., albumin) functions in baseline interaction. Gene expression data comparing liver in interaction with gut, versus isolation, revealed modulation of bile acid metabolism. Intestinal FGF19 secretion and associated inhibition of hepatic CYP7A1 expression provided evidence of physiologically relevant gut-liver crosstalk. Moreover, significant non-linear modulation of cytokine responses was observed under inflammatory gut-liver interaction; for example, production of CXCR3 ligands (CXCL9,10,11) was synergistically enhanced. RNA-seq analysis revealed significant upregulation of IFNα/β/γ signaling during inflammatory gut-liver crosstalk, with these pathways implicated in the synergistic CXCR3 chemokine production. Exacerbated inflammatory response in gut-liver interaction also negatively affected tissue-specific functions (e.g., liver metabolism). These findings illustrate how an integrated multi-tissue platform can generate insights useful for understanding complex pathophysiological processes such as inflammatory organ crosstalk. Biotechnol.

Berberine (BBR) is a traditional antimicrobial herbal medicine. Recently, BBR has gained popularity as a supplement to lower blood lipids, cholesterol and glucose. Bile acids (BAs) are known to regulate blood levels of triglycerides, cholesterol, glucose and energy homeostasis, and gut flora play an important role in BA metabolism. However, whether BBR alters BAs metabolism or dose-response effect of BBR on gut flora is unknown.
In this study, the effects of various doses of BBR on the concentrations of BAs in liver and serum of male C57BL/6 mice were determined by UPLC-MS/MS, and the expression of BA-related genes, as well as the amount of 32 of the most abundant gut bacterial species in the terminal ileum and large intestine of male C57BL/6 mice were quantified by RT-PCR and Quantigene 2.0 Reagent System, respectively.
Unconjugated BAs and total BAs were significantly altered by BBR in serum but not in liver. Increased primary BAs (βMCA, TβMCA and TUDCA) and decreased secondary BAs (DCA, LCA and the T-conjugates) were observed in livers and serum of mice fed BBR. The expression of BA-synthetic enzymes (Cyp7a1 and 8b1) and uptake transporter (Ntcp) increased 39-400 % in liver of mice fed the higher doses of BBR, whereas nuclear receptors and efflux transporters were not markedly altered. In addition, Bacteroides were enriched in the terminal ileum and large bowel of mice treated with BBR.
The present study indicated that various doses of BBR have effects on BA metabolism and related genes as well as intestinal flora, which provides insight into many pathways of BBR effects.
A novel ratiometric and reversible chemosensor 4-((2-(Benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)phenyl)ethynyl)-N,N-diethylaniline (BT-1) based on ortho-arylethynyl benzothiazole with large Stokes shift (Δλ≈190 nm) was designed and synthesized to recognize Cu2+. Copper ion induces a remarkable fluorescence enhancement and causes formation of a BT-1-Cu complex. The clamp-on coordination mode of BT-1 to Cu2+ was demonstrated using Job's plot, mass spectrum (MS) and DFT calculations. The calculations also indicate that Cu2+ was chelated to BT-1 through N and alkyne instead of S and alkyne. The probe could quantify Cu2+ with the detection limit of 3.2 × 10-9 M. The in vitro imaging results indicated that the probe BT-1 was membrane-permeable and could be applied into the recognition of Cu2+ ions in living cells.
A new highly selective and sensitive dual-mode sensor 3TD based on the conjugate of oligothiophene and barbituric acid moiety was developed for colorimetric and turn-on fluorescent detection of CN─. The sensor 3TD exhibited high specificity towards CN─ by interrupting its own ICT producing thereupon a large blue-shift in UV-Vis spectrum and remarkable "turn-on" fluorescence emission. The detection limit was 2.26 × 10─7 M, which is quite lower than the permissible level of CN─ in drinking water according to the WHO. The fluorescent detection of CN─ was well demonstrated by filter paper strips and silica coated TLC plates. Moreover, the sensor was also used to detect CN─ in environmental water and agro-products with satisfactory results. Most importantly, in terms of these advantages of colorimetric and turn-on fluorescent dual-mode, immediate response, excellent selectivity, high sensitivity, low cytotoxicity, and good biocompatibility, the sensor 3TD was successfully applied into CN- imaging in living cells, demonstrating its excellent value in practical application.
Titanium dioxide has been widely used in modern industrial applications, especially as an effective photocatalyst. Recently, freestanding TiO2 films with a markedly reduced bandgap of ∼1.8 eV have been synthesized, indicating that the dimension has a considerable influence on the bulk band gap (&gt;∼3 eV) and enhances the adsorption range of visible light. Titanium oxide compounds have various stoichiometries and versatile properties. Therefore, it is very necessary to explore the electronic properties and functionalities of other titanium oxide films with different stoichiometries. Here, we combined structure searches with first-principle calculations to explore candidate Ti-O films with different stoichiometries. In addition to the experimentally synthesized TiO2 film, the structure searches identified three new energetically and dynamically stable Ti-O films with stoichiometries of Ti3O5, Ti3O2, and Ti2O. Calculations show that the Ti-O films undergo several interesting electronic transformations as the Ti fraction increases, namely, from a wide-gap semiconductor (TiO2, 3.2 eV) to a narrow-gap semiconductor (Ti3O5, 1.80 eV) and then to metals (Ti3O2 and Ti2O) due to the abundance of unpaired Ti_d electrons. In addition to the electronic transformations, we observed nonmagnetic (TiO2) to ferromagnetic (Ti3O5, Ti3O2, and Ti2O) transformations. Notably, the Ti3O5 film possesses both narrow-gap semiconductive and ferromagnetic properties, with a large magnetic moment of 2.0 µB per unit cell; therefore, this film has high potential for use in applications such as spintronic devices. The results highlight metal fraction-induced electronic and magnetic transformations in transition metal oxide films and provide an alternative route for the design of new, functional thin-film materials.
The energetics of the electrical double layer (EDL) is studied in a systematic way to define how different components of the chemical potential help or hinder cation adsorption at a negatively charged wall. Specifically, the steric (i.e., excluded-volume interactions), mean electrostatic, and screening (i.e., electrostatic correlations beyond the mean field) components were computed using classical density functional theory of the primitive model of ions (i.e., ions as charged, hard spheres in a background dielectric). The reduced physics of the primitive model allows for an extensive analysis over a large parameter space: cation valences +1, +2, and +3, cation diameters 0.15, 0.30, 0.60, and 0.90 nm, bulk concentrations ranging from 1 µM to 1M, and surface charges ranging from 0 to -0.50 C/m2. Our results show that all components are necessary to understand the physics of the EDL. The screening component is always significant; for small monovalent cations such as K+, it is generally much larger than the steric component, and for multivalent ions, charge inversion cannot occur without it. At moderate surface charges, the screening component makes the electrostatic potential less negative than in classical Poisson-Boltzmann theory, sometimes even positive (charge inversion). At high surface charges, this is overcome by the repulsive potential of the steric component as the first ion layer becomes extremely crowded. Large negative electrostatic potentials counteract this to draw even more cations into the first layer. Although we used an approximate model of the EDL, the physics inherent in these trends appears to be quite general.
Standard multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) calculations use a direct product basis and rely on the potential being a sum of products (SOPs). The size of the direct product MCTDH basis scales exponentially with the number of atoms. Accurate potentials may not be SOPs. We introduce an MCTDH approach that uses a pruned basis and a collocation grid. Pruning the basis significantly reduces its size. Collocation makes it possible to do calculations using a potential that is not a SOP. The collocation point set is a Smolyak grid. Strategies using pruned MCTDH bases already exist, but they work only if the potential is a SOP. Strategies for using MCTDH with collocation also exist, but they work only if the MCTDH basis is a direct product. In this paper, we combine a pruned basis with collocation. This makes it possible to mitigate the direct-product basis size problem and do calculations when the potential is not a SOP. Because collocation is used, there are no integrals and no need for quadrature. All required matrix-vector products can be evaluated sequentially. We use nested sets of collocation points and hierarchical basis functions. They permit efficient inversion of the (large) matrix whose elements are basis functions evaluated at points, which is necessary to transform values of functions at points to basis coefficients. The inversion technique could be used outside of chemical physics. We confirm the validity of this new pruned, collocation-based (PC-)MCTDH approach by calculating the first 50 vibrational eigenenergies of CH2NH.
It is shown that quantum chemical calculations of the nuclear magnetic shieldings of a group of vicinal nuclei in a large molecule can be made sublinear scaling [i.e., O(1)] with respect to the molecular size. This is achieved by making both the diamagnetic and paramagnetic terms translation invariant [following the work of Ochsenfeld et al. J. Chem. Phys. 134, 074102 (2011)] and by making use of a local representation that is independent of the molecular size. Although only Hartree-Fock results are reported here, the idea can readily be extended to correlated wave function methods as well as the relativistic domain.
We report the first fully coupled quantum six-dimensional (6D) bound-state calculations of the vibration-translation-rotation eigenstates of a flexible H2, HD, and D2 molecule confined inside the small cage of the structure II clathrate hydrate embedded in larger hydrate domains with up to 76 H2O molecules, treated as rigid. Our calculations use a pairwise-additive 6D intermolecular potential energy surface for H2 in the hydrate domain, based on an ab initio 6D H2-H2O pair potential for flexible H2 and rigid H2O. They extend to the first excited (v = 1) vibrational state of H2, along with two isotopologues, providing a direct computation of vibrational frequency shifts. We show that obtaining a converged v = 1 vibrational state of the caged molecule does not require converging the very large number of intermolecular translation-rotation states belonging to the v = 0 manifold up to the energy of the intramolecular stretch fundamental (≈4100 cm-1 for H2). Only a relatively modest-size basis for the intermolecular degrees of freedom is needed to accurately describe the vibrational averaging over the delocalized wave function of the quantum ground state of the system. For the caged H2, our computed fundamental translational excitations, rotational j = 0 → 1 transitions, and frequency shifts of the stretch fundamental are in excellent agreement with recent quantum 5D (rigid H2) results [A. Powers et al., J. Chem. Phys. 148, 144304 (2018)]. Our computed frequency shift of -43 cm-1 for H2 is only 14% away from the experimental value at 20 K.
It has been shown [H. Chaté et al., Phys. Rev. E 77, 046113 (2008) and F. Ginelli, Eur. Phys. J.: Spec. Top. 225, 2099 (2016)] that the hydrodynamic equations of dry active polar fluids (i.e., moving flocks without momentum conservation) imply giant number fluctuations. Specifically, the rms fluctuations ⟨(δN)2⟩ of the number N of active particles in a region containing a mean number of active particles ⟨N⟩ scale according to the law ⟨(δN)2⟩=K'⟨N⟩ϕ(d) with ϕ(d)=710+15d in d ≤ 4 spatial dimensions. This is much larger than the "law of large numbers" scaling ⟨(δN)2⟩=K⟨N⟩ found in most equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems. In this paper, it is demonstrated that giant number fluctuations also depend singularly on the shape of the box in which one counts the particles, vanishing in the limit of very thin and very fat boxes. These fluctuations arise not from large density fluctuations-indeed, the density fluctuations in polar ordered dry active fluids are not in general particularly large-but from long ranged spatial correlations between those fluctuations. These are shown to be closely related in two spatial dimensions to the electrostatic potential near a sharp upward pointing conducting wedge of opening angle 3π4=135° and in three dimensions to the electrostatic potential near a sharp upward pointing charged cone of opening angle 37.16°. This very precise prediction can be stringently tested by alternative box counting experiments that directly measure the direction dependence, as well as the scaling with distance, of the density-density correlation function.
We study the liquid-gas phase separation observed in a system of repulsive particles dressed with ferromagnetically aligning spins, a so-called "spin fluid." Microcanonical ensemble numerical simulations of finite-size systems reveal that magnetization sets in and induces a liquid-gas phase separation between a disordered gas and a ferromagnetic dense phase at low enough energies and large enough densities. The dynamics after a quench into the coexistence region show that the order parameter associated with the liquid-vapor phase separation follows an algebraic law with an unusual exponent, as it is forced to synchronize with the growth of the magnetization: this suggests that for finite size systems the magnetization sets in along a Curie line, which is also the gas-side spinodal line, and that the coexistence region ends at a tricritical point. This picture is confirmed at the mean-field level with different approximation schemes, namely, a Bethe lattice resolution and a virial expansion complemented by the introduction of a self-consistent Weiss-like molecular field. However, a detailed finite-size scaling analysis shows that in two dimensions the ferromagnetic phase escapes the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless scenario and that the long-range order is not destroyed by the unbinding of topological defects. The Curie line thus becomes a magnetic crossover in the thermodynamic limit. Finally, the effects of the magnetic interaction range and those of the interaction softness are characterized within a mean-field semianalytical low-density approach.
We study the structural and dynamical behavior of an A-B diblock chain in the bath of active Brownian particles (ABPs) by Brownian dynamics simulations in two dimensions. We are interested in the situation that the effective interaction between the A segments is attractive, while that between the B segments is repulsive. Therefore, in thermal (nonactive) equilibrium, the A block "folds" into a compact globule, while the B block is in the expanded coil state. Interestingly, we find that the A block could "unfold" sequentially like unknitting a sweater, driven by the surrounding ABPs when the propelling strength on them is beyond a certain value. This threshold value decreases and then levels off as the length of the B block increases. We also find a simple power-law relation between the unfolding time of the A block and the self-propelling strength and an exponential relation between the unfolding time and the length of the B block. Finally, we probe the translational and rotational diffusion of the chain and find that both of them show "super-diffusivity" in a large time window, especially when the self-propelling strength is small and the A block is in the folded state. Such super-diffusivity is due to the strong asymmetric distribution of ABPs around the chain. Our work provides new insights into the behavior of a polymer chain in the environment of active objects.
We use molecular dynamics to determine the mass accommodation coefficient (MAC) of water vapor molecules colliding with a rapidly moving liquid-vapor interface. This interface mimics those present in collapsing vapor bubbles that are characterized by large interfacial velocities. We find that at room temperature, the MAC is generally close to unity, and even with interfaces moving at 10 km/s velocity, it has a large value of 0.79. Using a simplified atomistic fluid model, we explore the consequences of vapor molecule interfacial collision rules on pressure, temperature, and density of a vapor subjected to an incoming high-velocity liquid-vapor interface.
In order to assess viability of microalgae cultivation using unsterilized dairy-derived liquid digestate (DLD) for simultaneous biofuels feedstock production and contaminant removal, four DLD concentrations (25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) were used to grow Chlorella vulgaris in batch photobioreactors (PBRs). The 25% DLD was an ideal alternative medium in that high growth rate (0.69 d-1), high lipid productivity (112.9 mg L-1 d-1) as well as high nutrient removal were attained. The high DLD concentration caused inhibition of microalgal growth, where COD was more inhibitive than ammonium. The presence of bacteria did not influence microalgae production because of limited growth. Microalgal growth reduced the richness and diversity of bacterial community. Furthermore, the species of Bacteroidetes, Candidatus Saccharibacteria, and Chlamydiae rather than Proteobacteria benefited microalgal-bacterial symbiosis. These findings contribute to better application of microalgal-bacterial system for large-scale microalgae cultivation as well as environmental sustainability.
Many urological operations require placement of a urethral Foley catheter. The catheter often needs to remain in situ for a period of time after discharge; and patients subsequently require either a further hospital admission or community nurse review for catheter removal. Parents can easily remove the catheter at home by cutting the balloon port. This disrupts the valve and hence deflates the retaining balloon, thereby facilitating spontaneous passage of the catheter. The authors introduced this practice to their institution.
The aim was to assess safety and success of parental home catheter removal.
A prospective data study was performed in a large pediatric urology center over a 12-month time period. Patients &lt;16 years after single-stage hypospadias repair or other penile surgery were included on a voluntary basis. Parents of eligible patients were instructed verbally and with an information leaflet, including date for removal. Telephone follow-up after removal was undertaken to assess the outcome.
Thirty-eight patients were included over a 12-month time period. Patient age ranged from 9 months to 12 years (median age 2.5 years). The majority (82%) of patients had required a catheter after hypospadias repair. Home catheter removal was successful in 92% cases. Three children required professional support for catheter removal. Median time until catheter passage was 3 h (range 0-24 h). Considering that cost for day case admission for catheter removal averages at 130£ per patient, home catheter removal saved the NHS 4550£ in the time period.
This is the first study to report the safety and feasibility of parental home catheter removal by cutting the balloon port valve in the pediatric population. It offers a number of distinct advantages compared with traditional methods for removal. These include, namely, (i) positive patient experience: catheter removal in a familiar environment by a relative minimizes stressful experiences for the family; (ii) minimal trauma to healing tissues through spontaneous catheter passage; and (iii) health care-related cost savings. This was an initial benchmarking study, so patient numbers were relatively small. Nevertheless, it shows that the method is safe and received positive parental feedback.
Parental home removal of a urethral catheter is a feasible and safe alternative to catheter removal by a health-care professional. It minimizes parental anxiety and inconvenience related to the catheter removal appointment and allows for significant cost savings.
Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs; e.g., parental divorce, physical or sexual abuse) are more prevalent in individuals with chronic pain compared to the general population. Both increased maternal ACEs and chronic pain have been associated with poor physical and emotional functioning in offspring. However, the mechanisms driving these associations are poorly understood. Thus, this cross-sectional study evaluated the relation between maternal ACEs, mothers' current functioning, and children's physical and emotional functioning in a sample of mothers with chronic pain and their 8-12 year-old children. Results indicated a higher prevalence of at least 1 ACE in this sample of mothers with chronic pain (84%) compared to normative data from a community sample of women. Higher maternal ACE scores corresponded with lower physical and social functioning, greater anxiety and depressive symptoms, greater fatigue and sleep disturbances, and greater pain intensity and pain interference in mothers. Higher maternal ACE scores significantly correlated with higher child self-reported depressive symptoms, but not somatic symptoms or functional impairment. A path model indicated that maternal depressive symptoms accounted for the relation between higher maternal ACE scores and children's depressive symptoms. Intervening on maternal depression among mothers with chronic pain may reduce the impact of intergenerational ACE transmission. Perspective: This article presents evidence regarding the intergenerational impact of adverse childhood experiences in a large sample of mothers with chronic pain and their school-aged children. Maternal depressive symptoms accounted for the relation between maternal ACEs and children's depressive symptoms providing evidence regarding targets for preventive interventions.
Frailty is common in adults with advanced lung disease and is associated with death before and after lung transplantation. We aimed to determine whether frailty changes from before to after the lung transplant.
In a single-center, prospective cohort study among adults undergoing lung transplantation from 2010 to 2017, we assessed frailty by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB; higher scores reflect less frailty) and Fried Frailty Phenotype (FFP; higher scores reflect greater frailty) before and repeatedly up to 36 months after transplant. We tested for changes in frailty scores over time using segmented mixed effects models, adjusting for age, sex, and diagnosis. We quantified the proportion of subjects transitioning between frailty states (frail vs not frail) from before to after the transplant.
In 246 subjects, changes in frailty occurred within the first 6 post-operative months and remained stable thereafter. The overall change in frailty was attributable to improvements among those subjects who were frail before transplant. They experienced a 5.1-point improvement in SPPB (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.6-5.7) and a 1.8-point improvement in FFP (95% CI -2.1 to -1.6) during the early period. Frailty by SPPB and FFP did not change in those who were not frail before transplant. Approximately 84% of survivors who were frail before transplant became not frail after transplant.
Pre-operative frailty resolves in many patients after lung transplantation. Because a large proportion of frailty may be attributable to advanced lung disease, frailty alone should not be an absolute contraindication to transplantation.
This study thoroughly explored the demographic and imaging characteristics, as well as the all-cause and cause-specific mortality risks of patients with a coronary artery calcium (CAC) score ≥1,000 in the largest dataset of this population to date.
CAC is commonly used to quantify cardiovascular risk. Current guidelines classify a CAC score of &gt;300 or 400 as the highest risk group, yet little is known about the potentially unique imaging characteristics and mortality risk in individuals with a CAC score ≥1,000.
A total of 66,636 asymptomatic adults were included from the CAC consortium, a large retrospective multicenter clinical cohort. Mean patient follow-up was 12.3 ± 3.9 years for patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD), coronary heart disease (CHD), cancer, and all-cause mortality. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for age, sex, and conventional risk factors were used to assess the relative mortality hazard of individuals with CAC ≥1,000 compared with, first, a CAC reference of 0, and second, with patients with a CAC score of 400 to 999.
There were 2,869 patients with CAC ≥1,000 (86.3% male, mean 66.3 ± 9.7 years of age). Most patients with CAC ≥1,000 had 4-vessel CAC (mean: 3.5 ± 0.6 vessels) and had greater total CAC area, higher mean CAC density, and more extracoronary calcium (79% with thoracic artery calcium, 46% with aortic valve calcium, and 21% with mitral valve calcium) than those with CAC scores of 400 to 999. After full adjustment, those with CAC ≥1,000 had a 5.04- (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.92 to 6.48), 6.79- (95% CI: 4.74 to 9.73), 1.55- (95% CI:1.23 to 1.95), and 2.89-fold (95% CI: 2.53 to 3.31) risk of CVD, CHD, cancer, and all-cause mortality, respectively, compared to those with CAC score of 0. The CAC ≥1,000 group had a 1.71- (95% CI: 1.41 to 2.08), 1.84- (95% CI: 1.43 to 2.36), 1.36- (95% CI:1.07 to 1.73), and 1.51-fold (95% CI: 1.33 to 1.70) increased risk of CVD, CHD, cancer, and all-cause mortality compared to those with CAC scores 400 to 999. Graphic analysis of CAC ≥1,000 patients revealed continued logarithmic increase in risk, with no clear evidence of a risk plateau.
Patients with extensive CAC (CAC ≥1,000) represent a unique very high-risk phenotype with mortality outcomes commensurate with high-risk secondary prevention patients. Future guidelines should consider CAC ≥1,000 patients to be a distinct risk group who may benefit from the most aggressive preventive therapy.
This study investigated the incidence and long-term prognostic importance of multiple myocardial scars in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in a large contemporary cohort of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).
Patients presenting with STEMI may have multiple infarctions/scars caused by multiple culprit lesions, previous myocardial infarction (MI) or procedure-related MI due to nonculprit interventions. However, the incidence, long-term prognosis, and distribution of causes of multiple myocardial scars remain unknown.
CMR was performed in 704 patients with STEMI 1 day after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and again 3 months later. Myocardial scars were assessed by late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). T2-weighted technique was used to differentiate acute from chronic infarctions. The presence of multiple scars was defined as scars located in different coronary territories. The combined endpoints of all-cause mortality and hospitalization for heart failure were assessed at 39 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 31 to 48 months).
At 3 months, 59 patients (8.4%) had multiple scars. Of these, multiple culprits in STEMI were detected in 7 patients (1%), and development of a second nonculprit scar at follow-up occurred in 10 patients (1.4%). The most frequent cause of multiple scars was a chronic scar in the nonculprit myocardium. The presence of multiple scars was independently associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and hospitalization for heart failure (hazard ratio: 2.7; 95% confidence interval: 1.1 to 6.8; p = 0.037).
Multiple scars were present in 8.4% of patients with STEMI and were independently associated with an increased risk of long-term morbidity and mortality. The presence of multiple myocardial scars on CMR may serve as a useful tool in risk stratification of patients following STEMI. (DANish Study of Optimal Acute Treatment of Patients With ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction [DANAMI-3]; NCT01435408) (Primary PCI in Patients With ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction and Multivessel Disease: Treatment of Culprit Lesion Only or Complete Revascularization [PRIMULTI]; NCT01960933).
Catheter directed thrombolysis (CDT) for peripheral arterial occlusions is a well established alternative to thrombo-embolectomy in patients with (sub)acute limb ischaemia. However, protocols are heterogeneous and need optimisation to improve results and lower bleeding risks. The objective was to review the results and outcomes of different CDT protocols for patients with peripheral arterial occlusions.
Electronic information sources (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane) and reference lists were searched to identify studies reporting results of CDT of peripheral arterial occlusions.
Two independent observers performed study selection, quality assessment and data extraction. Primary outcomes were treatment duration, success rates, and bleeding complications. Secondary outcomes were mortality and amputation rates.
One hundred and six studies were included: 19 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), 38 prospective studies, 48 retrospective studies, and one mixed cohort study. The studies comprised a total number of 10,643 cases of which 9877 received CDT for lower extremity arterial occlusion, with a mean treatment duration of 21.4 h (95% confidence interval [CI] 21.0-21.8), an angiographic patency of 75% (95% CI 74.6-75.1), and freedom from amputation rate of 91% (95% CI 90.3-90.7). Pooled results showed a thrombolysis duration with high dose protocols of 21.9 h (95% CI 21.4-22.5) and 32.7 h with low dose protocols, with bleeding rates of 16.7% (95% CI 16.3-17.1) and 13.4% (95% CI 12.8-14.0), respectively. Weighted mean results for all RCTs and prospective cohorts of &gt;100 cases analysed separately, showed comparable results to all observational cohorts pooled. Bleeding complications occurred in 18% (95% CI 17.8-18.3) of patients and remain an important risk of CDT.
CDT is an effective treatment for peripheral arterial occlusions, the main concern is bleeding complications. Although no formal meta-analysis could be performed, the pooled results suggest that lower doses of fibrinolytics lead to similar success rates at a cost of longer treatment duration but with less bleeding. There is large variation in treatment protocols and the available literature suffers from absence of reporting standards and high heterogeneity.
Exposure to a traumatic event may not only lead to a large variety of mental disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) but also respiratory symptoms and/or respiratory diseases, as asthma.
Systematic literature review of data on the impact of post-traumatic stress disorder on asthma.
Medline, on the period 1980-2018 with the following keywords: "PTSD" or "post-traumatic stress disorder" or "post-traumatic stress disorder" and "asthma", limits "title/abstract"; the selected languages were English or French. Among 141 articles, 23 abstracts have given use to a dual reading to select 14 studies.
While PTSD may develop 4 weeks after being exposed to a traumatic event during which the physical integrity of the person has been threatened, it might also develop several months or years later. PTSD has been reported to be a risk factor for asthma and also a factor that might enhance a preexisting asthma. It is also important to note that this relation has been highlighted among several populations, traumatic events and regardless the gender and/or cultural factors. Despite its impact on the development of asthma, in asthmatic patients, PTSD may be responsible for poor asthma control, increased rates of healthcare use (visit in the emergency department and/or hospitalization for asthma) and poor asthma-related quality of life. The study of the association between PTSD and asthma have to take into account some potentially confounding factors, such as smoking status and dust exposure (e.g.: asthma following the terrorist attacks of the World Trade Center). Less is known regarding the potential mechanisms involved in the association between PTSD and asthma. Several factors including the nervous system, the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, the inflammatory response and the immune system may explain the association.
PTSD is a risk factor for the development of asthma and for the worsening of preexisting asthma. In asthmatic patients, it is of primary importance to systematically screen potential PTSD that might be developed after a traumatic event or a preexisting traumatic condition. Moreover, after exposure to a traumatic event, a special attention needs to be paid to somatic reactions such as asthma. The majority of studies having been conducted on American samples, replicating studies among European samples appears of prime importance in order to add a body of knowledge on the association between somatic and psychiatric conditions.
Medical schools are often blamed for inadequately training doctors on delirium. This study assesses the knowledge of medical students regarding delirium and evaluates different teaching methods for comparing learning outcomes.
A video, a handout, and a video+handout were used as three different teaching methods. Students were randomly assigned to three groups and pre- and postintervention knowledge gains were compared. Interventions were held between 2015 and 2018 at the University of Heidelberg Medical School in Germany. Seventy-eight (video intervention 33; handout 26; video+handout 19) sixth-year medical students participated. Participants learned about delirium with the help of a video, a handout, and both a video+handout at the start of one-hour lectures dedicated to teaching about delirium. Pre- and postintervention questionnaires, comprising five multiple-choice questions and a self-estimated grade of knowledge about delirium, were used. Variables calculated were objective and subjective knowledge, recall, and accuracy of self-assessment. Microsoft Excel and analysis of covariance were used to analyze data.
Knowledge gains for all interventions were large (d&gt;0.8) irrespective of gender. Post hoc comparison showed video and video+handout methods were more effective with high recall for video (92.8%). Students rated their knowledge as satisfactory, although they scored 11.4 out of 20. Preintervention knowledge level was correctly estimated by 31% of students, and postintervention by 40.3% students.
Teaching about delirium to medical students with a video resulted in better knowledge transfer and recall. Most medical students, particularly men, overestimated their knowledge about delirium.
Few data examined the potential survival benefit of nephroureterectomy (NU) in the setting of metastatic upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (mUTUC). We hypothesized that a survival benefit might be associated with the use of NU in that setting and tested this hypothesis within a large population-based cohort.
Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2004-2014), we identified 1174 patients with mUTUC. Kaplan-Meier plots, as well as multivariable Cox regression models (MCRMs), relying on inverse probability after treatment weighting and landmark analyses, were used to test the effect of NU versus no surgical treatment on cancer-specific mortality (CSM) in patients with mUTUC.
Of 1174 patients with mUTUC, 449 (38%) underwent NU. The rate of NU decreased over time from 47.1% to 34.6% (estimated annual percentage change, -4%; P = .006]. In MCRMs, NU achieved independent predictor status for lower CSM (hazard ratio [HR], 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46-0.66; P &lt; .001). In MCRMs stratified according to chemotherapy, NU also achieved independent predictor status for lower CSM, both in patients who received (n = 597; 50.9%) (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.53-0.87; P = .002) or did not receive (n = 574; 49%) (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.33-0.58; P &lt; .001) chemotherapy. Virtually the same results were recorded after inverse probability after treatment weighting adjustment, as well as in landmark analyses.
Our analyses suggest a potential survival benefit after NU in the setting of mUTUC, regardless of chemotherapy administration.
While surgical treatment of Siewert I and III (S1,S3) Esophagogastric Junction (EGJ) cancer is codified, the efficay of transhiatal procedure with anastomosis in the lower mediastinum for Siewert II (S2) still remains a dibated topic.
This is a large multicenter retrospective study. The results of 598 consecutive patients submitted to resection with curative intent from January 2000 to January 2017 were reported. Clinical and oncological outcomes of different procedures performed in S2 tumor were analyzed to investigate the efficacy of transhiatal approach.
The 5-year overall survival rate (OS) was poor (32%) for all Siewert types. The most performed operations in S2 cancer were proximal gastrectomy + transthoracic esophagectomy (TTE or Ivor-Lewis procedure, 60%), total gastrectomy + transhiatal distal esophagectomy with anastomosis in the chest (THE, 24%) and total gastrectomy + transthoracic esophagectomy (TGTTE, 15%). Cardiovascular and pulmonary complications were higher after TTE. On the contrary, surgical complications were significantly higher after THE. Postoperative mortality was similar. The distribution of TNM stages was different in the 3 types of procedures: patients submitted to THE had an earlier stage disease. With this bias, OS after THE was higher than after TTE but the difference was not significant (49.85% vs 28.42%, p = 0.0587).
Despite a higher rate of postoperative surgical complications, OS after total gastrectomy and transhiatal distal esophagectomy was at least comparable to that of transthoracic approach in less advanced S2 tumors. Therefore, THE with anastomosis in the chest could be a treatmen option in earlier S2 tumors.
Iliopsoas impingement after total hip arthroplasty (THA) occurs in up to 4.3% of patients resulting in functional groin pain. Operative treatment historically has included open iliopsoas tenotomy or acetabulum revision. We present a large single surgeon series of patients treated with endoscopic iliopsoas tenotomy for iliopsoas impingement after THA to evaluate the effectiveness and risks.
A consecutive series of 60 patients with iliopsoas impingement after THA treated with endoscopic iliopsoas tenotomy was retrospectively evaluated. Outcomes assessed were resolution of pain, change in Hip Outcome Score (HOS), and complications. Radiographs were reviewed by a musculoskeletal radiologist to evaluate component positioning and to compare with a control cohort.
At last follow-up (mean 5.5 months), 93.3% of patients had resolution of pain. The HOS activities of daily living (ADL) subscale mean was 57.5 (range 10.9-89.3, standard deviation [SD] 18.8) preoperatively and 71.6 (range 14.1-100, SD 26.1) postoperatively (P = .005). The HOS sports subscale mean was 37.3 (range 0-83.3, SD 24.0) preoperatively and 58.1 (range 0-100, SD 33.2) postoperatively (P = .002). One complication was reported, a postoperative hematoma managed conservatively. Body mass index and increased offset were associated with iliopsoas symptoms after THA in this series.
Endoscopic iliopsoas tenotomy after THA had a 93.3% resolution of pain, clinically important improvements in HOS, and low rate of complications. Endoscopic tenotomy should be considered as a treatment option in patients with iliopsoas impingement after THA.
Drainage of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) may be managed by different techniques and with different types of drain. It is mainly performed in the pneumology department or in the emergency department. The aim of the study was to evaluate the factors that influence the success of PSP drainage. This retrospective, monocentric study performed in University Hospital of Toulouse, included patients with a first episode of PSP requiring drainage. The primary outcome was the rate of success according to the techniques of drainage. Data on the size of the drain (&gt;14F or&lt;14F), the drainage technique (small bore catheter or chest tube drainage) and the drainage department (pneumology or emergency) were collected. One hundred and twenty-four patients had a drainage between 2014 and 2016: the late recurrence free success rate was 59% (n=73). Compared with emergency, drainage in pneumology increased the success rate threefold regardless of the drainage technique (P=0.0001) The success rate was similar whatever the technique used (Seldinger or classic technique) (P=0.31). Success and complications rates were similar whether the drain was large (&gt;14F) or small (&lt;14F) (respectively P=0.99 and P=0.58). In our study, the drainage of PSP in the pneumology department, with a small caliber inserted by the Seldinger technique, was associated with a significantly higher success rate.
The aim was to assess sex-specific differences in N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) regarding concentrations, predictors of high concentrations, and prognostic role, in a large and unselected population with chronic heart failure (HF) with preserved (HFpEF), mid-range (HFmrEF), and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).
In 9847 outpatients with HFpEF, HFmrEF, and HFrEF (49 vs. 35 vs. 25% females, respectively) from the Swedish HF Registry, median NT-proBNP concentrations were 1598 ng/L in females vs. 1310 ng/L in males in HFpEF, 1764 vs. 1464 ng/L in HFmrEF, and 2543 vs. 2226 ng/L in HFrEF (p &lt; 0.05 for all). The differences persisted after multiple adjustment. The largest sex-difference in NT-proBNP levels was observed in HFpEF with sinus rhythm, where median concentrations were 1.4 folds higher in females (923 vs. 647 ng/L). Independent predictors of NT-proBNP levels (defined as above the different medians according to sex and HF phenotype) were overall consistent across sexes and EF. NT-proBNP levels were similarly associated with risk of all-cause death/HF hospitalization in both sexes regardless of EF.
Concentrations of NT-proBNP were higher in females across the EF spectrum, with larger relative differences in HFpEF with sinus rhythm. However, similar predictors of high levels were observed in both sexes. There were no sex-differences in the prognostic role of NT-proBNP. These findings support the use of NT-proBNP for prognostic purposes in chronic HF, regardless of sex.
Superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) are materials that can absorb large quantities of water. Small spherical SAPs are commonly marketed as toys for children.
We report the case of a 4-year-old female who presented to a pediatric emergency department with a small, marble-sized SAP that was placed in her ear by herself during the course of play at daycare. On examination, the object was translucent and difficult to visualize. After multiple attempts at removal, the object was partially removed using an ear curette. The patient sustained a small tympanic membrane perforation. During a follow-up operative intervention by otorhinolaryngology, the remainder of the object was removed using a suction device and the tympanic membrane was repaired. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: While large SAPs associated with intestinal obstruction have been removed from the market, smaller SAPs can present a health risk when placed in orifices such as the ear or nose. Cases of foreign body SAPs have been misdiagnosed as ear infections and treated with topical antibiotics, which can lead to enlargement of the foreign body. Irrigation techniques and topical medications should not be used. SAPs are friable and can break into multiple pieces during removal attempts. Blunt tools, such as ear curettes, may be best suited for their removal. If the item breaks up during removal or if removal fails, urgent consultation with an otorhinolaryngologist is recommended.
Evidence-based policymaking values the use of research in the process of developing, implementing and evaluating policy. However, there is limited research attempting to understand how cancer policymaking occurs and the role of evidence in this process. Our study aimed to provide a deeper understanding of levers and challenges to the development and implementation of large-scale, health service policies or programs in cancer care. Within a realist framework, we conducted a thematic analysis of interviews with 13 key informants from five countries: Australia, Canada, Scotland, Denmark and New Zealand. Results identified a complex array of program mechanisms and contextual factors influencing cancer health-service policymaking. Research evidence was important and could form a rationale for change, such as by identifying unwarranted variation in cancer outcomes across or within countries. However, other factors were equally important in driving policy change, including advocacy, leadership, stakeholder collaboration, program adaptability, clinician and consumer involvement, and the influential role of context. These findings resonate with political science theories and health service reform literature, while offering novel insight into specific factors that influence policymaking in cancer care, namely clinical engagement, consumer input and policy context. Although research evidence supports policymaking, the complex ways in which cancer policies are developed and implemented requires recognition and should be considered when designing new programs and promoting the use of evidence in policymaking.
After the publication of large clinical trials, in January 2014 The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended annual lung cancer screening with low-dose CT in a well-defined group of high-risk smokers. A significant proportion of patients with laryngeal cancer (LC) meet the introduced criteria, and we hypothesized that clinical practice would change as a result of these evidence-based guidelines.
Retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with LC and treated at Johns Hopkins Hospital who met USPSTF criteria for annual chest screening and were followed for at least 3 consecutive years in the years surrounding the introduction of screening guidelines (January 2010 to December 2017) was performed to identify those who had recommended screening CT chest.
A total of 151 patients met the inclusion criteria of the study and were followed for a total of 746 patient-years. 184/332 (55%) patient-years in the pre-guidelines period and 246/414 (59%) in the post-guidelines period included at least one recommended chest imaging (CT or PET-CT; p = 0.27). 248/332 (75%) patient-years in the pre-guidelines period and 314/414 (76%) in the post-guidelines period included any radiological chest imaging (X-ray, CT or PET-CT; p = 0.72). Screening scans were ordered by OHNS (45%), Medical Oncology (31%), Radiation Oncology (8%), and primary care (14%) with 70% of patients missing at least one year of indicated screening.
The implementation of new lung cancer screening guidelines did not change clinical practice in the management of patients with LC and many patients do not receive recommended screening. Further study concerning potential barriers to effective evidence-based screening and coordination of care is warranted.
To measure the press-on force during the polishing of composite restorations carried out by 10 dentists in a clinically simulated procedure.
Composite restorations (Tetric EvoCeram Bulk Fill) were placed in standardized Class II two-surface cavities in first upper acrylic molars. The surfaces were roughened by sandblasting (50μm, 1bar). The tooth was mounted on a tailor-made device with a 3D force sensor (Kistler, Z21134-300, 10Hz). Ten dentists (7 male, 3 female) polished one Class II restoration each using the one-step polishing system OptraPol together with a dental handpiece and water spray. The dentists were allowed to use all shapes of the polishing system (small flame, large flame, cup, lens). During polishing, the press-on forces measured for up to 2 minutes. Simultaneously, the polishing procedure was recorded with a digital camera to correlate the forces with the polishing shapes and movements.
In total, 17,999 force measurements were available for analysis. The mean forces of all operators varied between 0.77(±0.63) N and 2.23(±1.48) N; the difference was statistically significant (ANOVA, post-hoc Tukey B, p&lt;0.05). All dentists exerted maximum forces higher than 3 N (between 3.3N and 18.3N). Force values exceeded 2N during 25% of the polishing time. Female dentists polished with a statistically significant lower force than male dentists (ANOVA, p&lt;0.001). Polishing with the large flame and the cup generated significantly higher forces than polishing with the small flame and the lens (ANOVA, post hoc Tukey B, p&lt;0.01).
The press-on forces applied during polishing varied significantly between dentists and within the same dentist. In about 25% of the polishing time, forces were above the 2N limit, which is recommended by some manufacturers as the maximum polishing force. Test institutes and manufacturers should evaluate the polishing performance of polishing instruments with various press-on forces.
Step behavior, heart rate (HR), the high-frequency (HF) component of heart rate variability (HRV), the ratio of the low-frequency (LF) and HF components (LF/HF ratio) as well as rumination behavior during milking were investigated in dairy cows milked in a high-capacity rotary milking system (n = 49) to study animals' stress responses to the milking process. Cardiac parameters were analyzed for undisturbed standing (baseline) and for the stages of the morning, afternoon, and evening milking processes (i.e., driving animals from the barn to the pre-milking holding pen, pre-milking holding pen, preparation, milking, and waiting after milking in the milking stall). During driving, HR was greater than during all other stages. After driving, a gradual decrease in HR was observed. The HF decreased during driving, indicating a decrease in vagal tone compared with baseline. When animals were in the holding pen, vagal tone decreased, whereas sympathetic tone increased with lower values than recorded for baseline and driving. During preparation, HF values were still lower than those recorded for baseline. The recovery of the autonomic activity was observed following preparation as indicated by increased HF and decreased LF/HF ratio during milking and waiting stages. During milking, 53.1% of the animals ruminated. The frequency of steps was greater during preparation (3.7 ± 1.8 steps/min) than during milking (0.7 ± 0.4 steps/min) and waiting after milking (1.6 ± 1.0 steps/min). Our results suggest that being in the holding pen is stressful for cows; however, vagal predominance from the onset of milking, the low frequency of steps, and the high prevalence of rumination during milking suggest a possible welfare benefit of the investigated rotary milking system.
Although genetic testing is increasingly used in clinical nephrology, a large number of patients with congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) remain undiagnosed with current gene panels. Therefore, careful curation of novel genetic findings is key to improving diagnostic yields. We recently described a novel intellectual disability syndrome caused by de novo heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the splicing factor SON. Here, we show that many of these patients, including two previously unreported, exhibit a wide array of kidney abnormalities. Detailed phenotyping of 14 patients with SON haploinsufficiency identified kidney anomalies in 8 patients, including horseshoe kidney, unilateral renal hypoplasia, and renal cysts. Recurrent urinary tract infections, electrolyte disturbances, and hypertension were also observed in some patients. SON knockdown in kidney cell lines leads to abnormal pre-mRNA splicing, resulting in decreased expression of several established CAKUT genes. Furthermore, these molecular events were observed in patient-derived cells with SON haploinsufficiency. Taken together, our data suggest that the wide spectrum of phenotypes in patients with a pathogenic SON mutation is a consequence of impaired pre-mRNA splicing of several CAKUT genes. We propose that genetic testing panels designed to diagnose children with a kidney phenotype should include the SON gene.
Whether synaptic transmission is excitatory or inhibitory depends, to a large extent, on whether the ion channels that open upon binding the released neurotransmitter conduct cations or anions. The mechanistic basis of the opposite charge selectivities of Cys-loop receptors has only recently begun to emerge. It is now clear that ionized side chains-whether pore-facing or buried-in the first α-helical turn of the second transmembrane segments underlie this phenomenon and that the electrostatics of backbone atoms are not critically involved. Moreover, on the basis of electrophysiological observations, it has recently been suggested that not only the sign of charged side chains but also their conformation are crucial determinants of cation-anion selectivity. To challenge these ideas with the chemical and structural rigor that electrophysiological observations naturally lack, we performed molecular dynamics, Brownian dynamics, and electrostatics calculations of ion permeation. To this end, we used structural models of the open-channel conformation of the α1 glutamate-gated Cl- channel and the α1 glycine receptor. Our results provided full support to the notion that the conformation of charged sides chains matters for charge selectivity. Indeed, whereas some rotamers of the buried arginines at position 0' conferred high selectivity for anions, others supported the permeation of cations and anions at similar rates or even allowed the faster permeation of cations. Furthermore, we found that modeling glutamates at position -1' of the anion-selective α1 glycine receptor open-state structure-instead of the five native alanines-switches charge selectivity also in a conformation-dependent manner, with some glutamate rotamers being much more effective at conferring selectivity for cations than others. Regarding pore size, we found that the mere expansion of the pore has only a minimal impact on cation-anion selectivity. Overall, these results bring to light the previously unappreciated impact of side-chain conformation on charge selectivity in Cys-loop receptors.
In eukaryotes, DNA is packaged within nucleosomes. The DNA of each nucleosome is typically centered around an octameric histone protein core: one central tetramer plus two separate dimers. Studying the assembly mechanisms of histones is essential for understanding the dynamics of entire nucleosomes and higher-order DNA packaging. Here, we investigate canonical histone assembly and that of the centromere-specific histone variant, centromere protein A (CENP-A), using molecular dynamics simulations. We quantitatively characterize their thermodynamical and dynamical features, showing that two H3/H4 dimers form a structurally floppy, weakly bound complex, the latter exhibiting large instability around the central interface manifested via a swiveling motion of two halves. This finding is consistent with the recently observed DNA handedness flipping of the tetrasome. In contrast, the variant CENP-A encodes distinctive stability to its tetramer with a rigid but twisted interface compared to the crystal structure, implying diverse structural possibilities of the histone variant. Interestingly, the observed tetramer dynamics alter significantly and appear to reach a new balance when H2A/H2B dimers are present. Furthermore, we found that the preferred structure for the (CENP-A/H4)2 tetramer is incongruent with the octameric structure, explaining many of the unusual dynamical behaviors of the CENP-A nucleosome. In all, these data reveal key mechanistic insights and structural details for the assembly of canonical and variant histone tetramers and octamers, providing theoretical quantifications and physical interpretations for longstanding and recent experimental observations. Based on these findings, we propose different chaperone-assisted binding and nucleosome assembly mechanisms for the canonical and CENP-A histone oligomers.
The advent of Deep Learning (DL) is poised to dramatically change the delivery of healthcare in the near future. Not only has DL profoundly affected the healthcare industry it has also influenced global businesses. Within a span of very few years, advances such as self-driving cars, robots performing jobs that are hazardous to human, and chat bots talking with human operators have proved that DL has already made large impact on our lives. The open source nature of DL and decreasing prices of computer hardware will further propel such changes. In healthcare, the potential is immense due to the need to automate the processes and evolve error free paradigms. The sheer quantum of DL publications in healthcare has surpassed other domains growing at a very fast pace, particular in radiology. It is therefore imperative for the radiologists to learn about DL and how it differs from other approaches of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The next generation of radiology will see a significant role of DL and will likely serve as the base for augmented radiology (AR). Better clinical judgement by AR will help in improving the quality of life and help in life saving decisions, while lowering healthcare costs. A comprehensive review of DL as well as its implications upon the healthcare is presented in this review. We had analysed 150 articles of DL in healthcare domain from PubMed, Google Scholar, and IEEE EXPLORE focused in medical imagery only. We have further examined the ethic, moral and legal issues surrounding the use of DL in medical imaging.
The sensitive detection of tumor proto-oncogenes is indispensable because the early diagnosis and accurate treatment of genetic diseases is the key guarantee of patients' health. In this study, we proposed a novel palindromic molecular beacon (PMB) that it bases on the signal amplification strategy for ultrasensitive detection of Kras gene codon 12. PMB is designed to have two palindromic fragments at its two ends, one of which is locked via folding into a hairpin structure and the other promotes the formation of PMB duplex via intermolecular self-hybridization. Target DNA can hybridize to the loop portion of PMB and release the palindromic fragment at the 3' end. Within the PMB duplex, the two palindromic fragments released hybridize with each other and serve as polymerization primer responsible for the strand-displacement amplification (SDA). Namely, hybridized target DNA can be displaced and initiates the next round of reactions, making the polymerization/displacement/hybridization process go forward circularly. As a result, a large number of polymerization products are produced, dramatically enhancing optical signal. Because primer hybridization and polymerization-based displacement occur within PMB duplex, the reaction process is called intramolecular strand-displacement amplification (ISDA). Via utilizing the newly-proposed PMB-based ISDA strategy, the target K-ras gene could be detected down to 10 pM with a wide response range of 1 × 10-11-1.5 × 10-7 M, and point mutations are easily distinguished, realizing the ultrasensitive, highly selective detection of K-ras gene. This impressive sensing paradigm demonstrates a new concept of signal amplification for the detection of disease-related genes only via using a simple way to efficiently amplify optical signal.
'Functional' diversity is believed to influence ecosystem dynamics through links between organismal traits and ecosystem processes. Theory predicts that key traits and high trait redundancy - large species richness and abundance supporting the same traits - can buffer communities against environmental disturbances. While experiments and data from simple ecological systems lend support, large-scale evidence from diverse, natural systems under major disturbance is lacking. Here, using long-term data from both temperate (English Channel) and tropical (Seychelles Islands) fishes, we show that sensitivity to disturbance depends on communities' initial trait structure and initial trait redundancy. In both ecosystems, we found that increasing dominance by climatically-vulnerable traits rendered fish communities more sensitive to environmental change, while communities with higher trait redundancy were more resistant. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the influence of trait structure and redundancy on community sensitivity over large temporal and spatial scales in natural systems. Our results exemplify a consistent link between biological structure and community sensitivity that may be transferable across ecosystems and taxa and could help anticipate future disturbance impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

Epidemiological studies consistently demonstrate that lowered serum testosterone is not only common in men with established Type 2 diabetes, but also predicts future diabetic risks and increased mortality. Preclinical studies report plausible mechanisms by which low testosterone could mediate dysglycaemia. Exogenous testosterone treatment consistently reduces fat mass, increases muscle mass and improves insulin resistance in some studies, but the majority of currently available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) do not report a consistent glycaemic benefit. In men with diabetes, testosterone treatment effects on androgen deficiency-like clinical features are inconsistent, and effects on sexual dysfunction may be attenuated compared with men without diabetes. The long-term risks of testosterone treatment in older men without medical disease of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis are not known. Current RCTs are not definitive, owing to their small size, short duration and enrolment of men with mostly relatively good baseline glycaemic control not specifically selected for the presence of androgen deficiency symptoms. Although large, well-designed clinical trials are needed, given the benefit-risk ratio of testosterone treatment is not well understood, routine serum testosterone testing or testosterone treatment of asymptomatic men with Type 2 diabetes is currently not recommended. Carefully selected, symptomatic men with low testosterone who are informed of the lack of high-level evidence regarding the long-term benefits and risks of this approach may be offered a trial of testosterone treatment in combination with lifestyle measures, weight loss and optimization of comorbidities.

Bleeding into the joints represents the major morbidity of severe hemophilia and predisposes it to hemophilic arthropathy (HA). In a reproducible hemarthrosis mouse model, we found distinct changes in thrombin activity in joint tissue homogenate following exposure of the joint to blood in wide type (WT) and hemophilic B mice. Specifically, at early time points (4 h and 24 h) after hemarthrosis, thrombin activity in WT mice quickly peaked at 4 h, and returned to baseline after 1 week. In hemophilia B mice, there was no/minimal thrombin activity in joint tissues at 4 h and 24 h, whereas at 72 h and thereafter, thrombin activity kept rising, and persisted at a higher level. Nevertheless, prothrombin had not decreased in both WT and hemophilia. The pattern was also confirmed by Western blotting and immunostaining. To optimize the protection against development of HA, we tested different treatment regimens by administration of clotting factor IX into hemophilia B mouse after hemarthrosis induction, including a total of 600 IU/kg FIX within the first 24 h or the whole 2-week period. We concluded that timely (in the first 24 h) and sufficient hemostasis correction is critical for a better protection against the development of hemophilic arthropathy.
Detailed information about the excitatory and inhibitory synapses on the hypoglossal motoneurons may help understand the neural mechanism for control of the hypoglossal motoneuron excitability and hence the precise and coordinated movements of the tongue during chewing, swallowing and licking. For this, we investigated the distribution of GABA-, glycine (Gly)- and glutamate (Glut)-immunopositive (+) axon terminals on the genioglossal (GG) motoneurons by retrograde tracing, electron microscopic immunohistochemistry, and quantitative analysis. Small GG motoneurons (&lt; 400 μm2 in cross-sectional area) had fewer primary dendrites, significantly higher nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, and smaller membrane area covered by synaptic boutons than large GG motoneurons (&gt; 400 μm2). The fraction of inhibitory boutons (GABA + only, Gly + only, and mixed GABA +/Gly + boutons) of all boutons was significantly higher for small GG motoneurons than for large ones, whereas the fraction of Glut + boutons was significantly higher for large GG motoneurons than for small ones. Almost all boutons (&gt; 95%) on both small and large GG motoneurons were GABA + , Gly + or Glut + . The frequency of mixed GABA +/Gly + boutons was the highest among inhibitory boutons types for both small and large GG motoneurons. These findings may elucidate the anatomical substrate for precise regulation of the motoneuron firing required for the fine movements of the tongue, and also suggest that the excitability of small and large GG motoneurons may be regulated differently.
The problem of expressing cumulative detrimental effect of radiation exposure is revisited. All conventionally used and computationally complex lifetime or time-integrated risks are based on current population and health statistical data, with unknown future secular trends, that are projected far into the future. It is shown that application of conventionally used lifetime or time-integrated attributable risks (LAR, AR) should be limited to exposures under 1 Gy. More general quantities, such as excess lifetime risk (ELR) and, to a lesser extent, risk of exposure-induced death (REID), are free of dose constraints, but are even more computationally complex than LAR and AR and rely on the unknown total radiation effect on demographic and health statistical data. Appropriate assessment of time-integrated risk of a specific outcome following high-dose (more than 1 Gy) exposure requires consideration of competing risks for other radiation-attributed outcomes and the resulting ELR estimate has an essentially non-linear dose response. Limitations caused by basing conventionally applied time-integrated risks on current population and health statistical data are that they are: (a) not well suited for risk estimates for atypical groups of exposed persons not readily represented by the general population; and (b) not optimal for risk projections decades into the future due to large uncertainties in developments of the future secular trends in the population-specific disease rates. Alternative disease-specific quantities, baseline and attributable survival fractions, based on reduction of survival chances are considered here and are shown to be very useful in circumventing most aspects of these limitations. Another main quantity, named as radiation-attributed decrease of survival (RADS), is recommended here to represent cumulative radiation risk conditional on survival until a certain age. RADS, historically known in statistical literature as "cumulative risk", is only based on the radiation-attributed hazard and is insensitive to competing risks. Therefore, RADS is eminently suitable for risk projections in emergency situations and for estimating radiation risks for persons exposed after therapeutic or interventional medical applications of radiation or in other highly atypical groups of exposed persons, such as astronauts.
Due to maturation of joints, various changes take place, not only in the field of paediatric rheumatology but also in paediatric orthopaedics musculoskeletal ultrasound plays an important role in both the diagnosis and the follow-up of diseases in this field. To differentiate between physiological and pathological findings, the knowledge of reference values of joint structures is indispensable. The objective was to define B-mode ultrasound age- and sex-related reference values for the elbow joint in healthy children and adolescents during maturation. In a cross-sectional, multicentre ultrasound study we examined both sides of the elbow joints of 437 healthy children and adolescents (194 boys/243 girls) being between one and less than 18 years old. The children were classified into six equal age groups and divided according to their gender. We measured the distance between the outer margin of the joint capsule and the bone surface to define the bone-capsule distance (BCD), the thickness of the joint cartilage as well as the thickness of the joint capsule. The bone-capsule junction zone and the shape of the joint capsule were analysed qualitatively. The bone capsule distance and the capsule thickness increased with age. In contrast, the joint cartilage thickness decreased. In most cases the junction zone was peaked. The joint capsule showed mostly a concave shape. Intra- and interobserver reliabilities were good. We propose B-mode ultrasound age- and sex-related reference values for the elbow joint in a large number of healthy children and adolescents for the first time. By applying these standard values to the ultrasound examination of the elbow joint, it may be possible to achieve greater certainty in the diagnosis of pathological processes.
Nopp140, often called the nucleolar and Cajal body phosphoprotein (NOLC1), is an evolutionarily conserved chaperone for the transcription and processing of rRNA during ribosome subunit assembly. Metazoan Nopp140 contains an amino terminal LisH dimerization domain and a highly conserved carboxyl domain. A large central domain consists of alternating basic and acidic motifs of low sequence complexity. Orthologous versions of Nopp140 contain variable numbers of repeating basic-acidic units. While vertebrate Nopp140 genes use multiple exons to encode the central domain, the Nopp140 gene in Drosophila uses exclusively exon 2 to encode the central domain. Here, we define three overlapping repeat sequence patterns (P, P', and P″) within the central domain of D. melanogaster Nopp140. These repeat patterns are poorly conserved in other Drosophila species. We also describe a length polymorphism in exon 2 that pertains specifically to the P' pattern in D. melanogaster. The pattern displays either two or three 96 base pair repeats, respectively, referred to as Nopp140-Short and Nopp140-Long. Fly lines homozygous for one or the other allele, or heterozygous for both alleles, show no discernible phenotypes. PCR characterization of the long and short alleles shows a poorly defined, artifactual bias toward amplifying the long allele over the short allele. The significance of this polymorphism will be in discerning the largely unknown properties of Nopp140's large central domain in rDNA transcription and ribosome biogenesis.
Besides improving glucose control, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibition with dapagliflozin reduces blood pressure, body weight and urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The parameter response efficacy (PRE) score was developed to predict how short-term drug effects on cardiovascular risk markers translate into long-term changes in clinical outcomes. We applied the PRE score to clinical trials of dapagliflozin to model the effect of the drug on kidney and heart failure (HF) outcomes in patients with T2DM and impaired kidney function.
The relationships between multiple risk markers and long-term outcome were determined in a background population of patients with T2DM with a multivariable Cox model. These relationships were then applied to short-term changes in risk markers observed in a pooled database of dapagliflozin trials (n = 7) that recruited patients with albuminuria to predict the drug-induced changes to kidney and HF outcomes.
A total of 132 and 350 patients had UACR &gt;200 mg/g and &gt;30 mg/g at baseline, respectively, and were selected for analysis. The PRE score predicted a risk change for kidney events of -40.8% [95% confidence interval (CI) -51.7 to -29.4) and -40.4% (95% CI -48.4 to -31.1) with dapagliflozin 10 mg compared with placebo for the UACR &gt;200 mg/g and &gt;30 mg/g subgroups. The predicted change in risk for HF events was -27.3% (95% CI -47.7 to -5.1) and -21.2% (95% CI -35.0 to -7.8), respectively. Simulation analyses showed that even with a smaller albuminuria-lowering effect of dapagliflozin (10% instead of the observed 35% in both groups), the estimated kidney risk reduction was still 26.5 and 26.8%, respectively.
The PRE score predicted clinically meaningful reductions in kidney and HF events associated with dapagliflozin therapy in patients with diabetic kidney disease. These results support a large long-term outcome trial in this population to confirm the benefits of the drug on these endpoints.
The post-approval MELODY Registry aimed to obtain multicentre registry data after transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation (TPVI) with the Melody™ valve (Medtronic plc.) in a large-scale cohort of patients with congenital heart disease (CHD).
Retrospective analysis of multicentre registry data after TPVI with the Melody™ valve. Eight hundred and forty-five patients (mean age: 21.0 ± 11.1 years) underwent TPVI in 42 centres between December 2006 and September 2013 and were followed-up for a median of 5.9 years (range: 0-11.0 years). The composite endpoint of TPVI-related events during follow-up (i.e. death, reoperation, or reintervention &gt;48 h after TPVI) showed an incidence rate of 4.2% per person per year [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.7-4.9]. Transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation infective endocarditis (I.E.) showed an incidence rate of 2.3% per person per year (95% CI 1.9-2.8) and resulted in significant morbidity and in nine deaths. In multivariable Cox proportional hazard models, the invasively measured residual right ventricle (RV)-to-pulmonary artery (PA) pressure gradient (per 5 mmHg) was associated with the risk of the composite endpoint (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.21, 95% CI 1.12-1.30; P &lt; 0.0001) and the risk of TPVI I.E. (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.19, 95% CI 1.07-1.32; P = 0.002). Major procedural complications (death, surgical, or interventional treatment requirement) occurred in 0.5%, 1.2%, and 2.0%, respectively. Acutely, the RV-to-PA pressure gradient and the percentage of patients with pulmonary regurgitation grade &gt;2 improved significantly from 36 [interquartile range (IQR) 24-47] to 12 (IQR 7-17) mmHg and 47 to 1%, respectively (P &lt; 0.001 for each).
The post-approval MELODY Registry confirms the efficacy of TPVI with the Melody™ valve in a large-scale cohort of CHD patients. The residual invasively measured RV-to-PA pressure gradient may serve as a target for further improvement in the composite endpoint and TPVI I.E. However, TPVI I.E. remains a significant concern causing significant morbidity and mortality.
A growing number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are investigating the potential health benefits of high-dose vitamin D supplementation. However, there are limited RCT data on the safety of calcium-related adverse effects.
We investigated the incidence of kidney stone and hypercalcemia events in a large, population-based RCT of vitamin D supplementation.
The Vitamin D Assessment (ViDA) study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation in 5110 participants in Auckland, New Zealand. This trial investigated the impact of monthly 100,000 IU vitamin D3 supplementation over several years on cardiovascular events, respiratory infections, and falls/fractures. Participants provided information about recent kidney stone events in regular questionnaires sent to them with study capsules. Hospitalization data for kidney stones were collected from health authorities. Serum calcium was measured in an 8% subsample of participants who returned annually for blood tests. HRs of time to the first kidney stone event were calculated by Cox regression.
During a median follow-up of 3.3 y, 158 participants reported a kidney stone event (76 vitamin D, 82 placebo). The HR of reporting the first kidney stone event was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.66, 1.23; P = 0.51) for participants in the vitamin D arm compared with the placebo arm. There were 18 urolithiasis events in the hospitalization records: 7 in the vitamin D arm and 11 from the placebo arm. The HR to the first hospitalization urolithiasis event was 0.62 (95% CI: 0.24, 1.26; P = 0.30) in the vitamin D arm compared with the placebo arm. From the subsample annual blood test, there was no case of hypercalcemia in the vitamin D arm, compared with 1 in the placebo arm.
Over a median of 3.3 y, monthly supplementation with 100,000 IU vitamin D3 did not affect the incidence rate of kidney stone events, or hypercalcemia. This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as ACTRN12611000402943.
Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is commonly used in neurocritical care patients with acute brain injury (ABI). Practice about indications and use of ICP monitoring in patients with ABI remains, however, highly variable in high-income countries, while data on ICP monitoring in low and middle-income countries are scarce or inconsistent. The aim of the SYNAPSE-ICU study is to describe current practices of ICP monitoring using a worldwide sample and to quantify practice variations in ICP monitoring and management in neurocritical care ABI patients.
The SYNAPSE-ICU study is a large international, prospective, observational cohort study. From March 2018 to March 2019, all patients fulfilling the following inclusion criteria will be recruited: age &gt;18 years; diagnosis of ABI due to primary haemorrhagic stroke (subarachnoid haemorrhage or intracranial haemorrhage) or traumatic brain injury; Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) with no eye opening (Eyes response=1) and Motor score ≤5 (not following commands) at ICU admission, or neuro-worsening within the first 48 hours with no eye opening and a Motor score decreased to ≤5. Data related to clinical examination (GCS, pupil size and reactivity, Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale score, neuroimaging) and to ICP interventions (Therapy Intensity Levels) will be recorded on admission, and at day 1, 3 and 7. The Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) will be collected at discharge from ICU and from hospital and at 6-month follow-up. The impact of ICP monitoring and ICP-driven therapy on GOSE will be analysed at both patient and ICU level.
The study has been approved by the Ethics Committee 'Brianza' at the Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale (ASST)-Monza (approval date: 21 November 2017). Each National Coordinator will notify the relevant ethics committee, in compliance with the local legislation and rules. Data will be made available to the scientific community by means of abstracts submitted to the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine annual conference and by scientific reports and original articles submitted to peer-reviewed journals.

Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) is effective in reducing the disease burden. However, high-level evidence from randomised controlled trials on the effectiveness of CRC screening modalities is still lacking. We will conduct a large-scale multicentre randomised controlled trial in China to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different CRC screening strategies.
20 000 eligible participants aged 50-74 years are enrolled in five provinces in China. After providing signed informed consent, the participants will be randomised into one of the three screening groups: (1) one-time colonoscopy (n=4000), (2) annual faecal immunochemical test (FIT) (n=8000) and (3) annual risk-adapted screening strategy (n=8000). The risk-adapted screening strategy will use an established CRC risk scoring system, the Asia-Pacific Colorectal Screening score. Participants at high risk of CRC will be referred for colonoscopy, while participants at low risk will be referred for an FIT. Information on clinical reports, epidemiological risk factors and health economic factors will be collected and stored in a web-based data management system. We will further request the participants to donate blood, faecal and saliva samples before conducting the colonoscopy. The primary outcome will be the detection rate of advanced colorectal neoplasia and the secondary outcomes will include the rates of CRC-related mortality, incidence of CRC, participation and complications. The study will last for at least 4 years and the cohort will be followed for 10 years to adequately answer the scientific questions.
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the National Cancer Center/Cancer Hospital, the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College (18-013/1615). The results of the study will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals and will be discussed by policy and decision makers.

The interaction between positive and negative social support as well as each domain of social support and income on depressive symptom has not been much explored. We aimed to examine the associations of positive and negative social support with the risk of depressive symptoms among urban-dwelling adults in Korea, focusing on those interaction effects.
We used the first wave of a large-scale cohort study called The Health Examinees-Gem Study. Positive and negative support scores ranged between 0 and 6; the variables were then categorised into low, medium, and high groups. A two-level random intercept linear regression model was used, where the first level is individual and the second is the community. We further tested for interactions between each domain of social supports and household income.
A survey conducted at 38 health examination centres and training hospitals in major Korean cities and metropolitan areas during 2009-2010.
21 208 adult men and women aged between 40 and 69 in Korea (mean age: 52.6, SD: 8.0).
Depressive symptoms score measured by Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale, with scores ranging from 0 to 60.
Level of positive and negative social support showed a negative and positive association with depressive symptom score with statistical significance at p&lt;0.05, respectively. When the interaction terms among household income and social supports were examined, a negative association between level of positive social support and depressive symptom score was more pronounced as income was lower and level of negative social support was higher. Similarly, positive association between level of negative social support and depressive symptom score was more pronounced as income was lower and level of positive social support was lower.
Our findings suggest that strategies for encouraging positive social support and discouraging negative social support for disadvantaged individuals might be effective in reducing depression in Korea.
Intermediate care (IC) acts as a bridging service between hospital and home, for those deemed medically fit for discharge but who are delayed in hospital. The aim of this study was to measure the effect of IC and a 72-hour discharge target on days delayed.
Rate of days delayed per 1000 population aged 75 years+ in Glasgow City was compared before and after onset of IC with a 6-month phase-in period, using segmented linear regression. Inverclyde and West Dunbartonshire (IWD) was a control. Autoregressive and moving average terms were included in the model, as well as a Fourier term to adjust for seasonality.
Prior to IC, rate of days delayed increased in both Glasgow City and the rest of Scotland. There was a large reduction in rate of days delayed in Glasgow during the phase-in period, greater than the rest of Scotland but comparable with that observed in IWD, with subsequent increases thereafter. Adjusting for changes in IWD, the impact of IC and the discharge target in Glasgow City was a level change of -15.20 (95% CI -17.52 to -12.88) and a trend change of -0.29 (95% CI -0.55 to -0.02). This is equivalent to a predicted reduction due to IC of -16.04 days delayed per 1000 population per month, in June 2016, and a relative reduction of 35%.
IC and the 72-hour discharge target were associated with a reduction in days delayed. Rate of days delayed continued to increase over time, although at a slower rate than if IC had not been implemented.
Power and work at the ankle joint during gait are usually computed considering the foot as a rigid body [1-6] (Ankle Joint method, AJ). The foot is instead a deformable structure and can absorb and produce work by pronation/supination, foot arch deformation and other intrinsic movements. A different approach, named "the Distal Shank method (DS)" [7-12] considers all these aspects without increasing the complexity of the protocol, and thus it seems promising for clinical applications [12].
a) To characterize the differences in power and work computed using the two mentioned methods for a relatively large number of subjects walking at different velocities, barefoot and with different shoes; b) To assess the practical feasibility of the DS method for clinical applications.
Eighteen healthy subjects were evaluated while walking barefoot at slow, natural and fast velocity. Shod walking was analysed at natural velocity. Four subjects were also analysed while walking in high-heel shoes. The power at the ankle joint was computed with both the AJ and the DS methods. We then compared the obtained results.
The DS method showed a consistent negative peak of power absorption during the load acceptance phase, barely visible with the AJ method. The maximum power production calculated with the DS method was significantly lower. The work at the end of the stride cycle was lower with the DS method, and in most conditions even negative, thus indicating higher energy dissipation.
We confirmed on a large cohort of healthy subjects and in different walking conditions that neglecting foot deformations during gait leads to underestimate power absorption and overestimate power production. The DS method does not require a complex gait analysis protocol, nor additional time for the analysis, and can provide information of clinical interest, related to foot mechanical alterations.
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, leading to hematopoietic precursor cell apoptosis and peripheral blood cytopenias. Anemia is the most frequently experienced cytopenia and is the main cause of MDS symptoms, with fatigue and dyspnea contributing to reduced quality of life and increased morbidity. As MDS disease course and prognosis is influenced by disease factors, prognostic scoring systems have been developed for MDS to aid clinical and therapeutic decisions following diagnosis. Erythropoiesis- stimulating agents (ESAs) have been used for many years to treat anemia in patients with lower-risk MDS without chromosomal abnormalities. The use of ESAs is recommended by international clinical practice guidelines, due to the large body of evidence demonstrating their effectiveness in lower-risk MDS. In March 2017, the European Medicines Agency approved epoetin alfa for the treatment of anemia in lower-risk MDS patients, based on the results from a Phase 3 clinical trial and three European registry studies. The effectiveness of biosimilar epoetin alfa (Binocrit®, Sandoz) to correct anemia in lower-risk MDS patients has also been demonstrated in a retrospective, single-center, observational study. The recent approval of epoetin alfa by the EMA in this setting will provide clinicians with a welcome, approved treatment option for lower-risk MDS.
The endothelium is the single layer of cells lining all blood vessels, and it is a remarkable cardiovascular control centre. Each endothelial cell has only a small number (on average six) of interconnected neighbours. Yet this arrangement produces a large repertoire of behaviours, capable of controlling numerous cardiovascular functions in a flexible and dynamic way. The endothelium regulates the delivery of nutrients and removal of waste by regulating blood flow and vascular permeability. The endothelium regulates blood clotting, responses to infection and inflammation, the formation of new blood vessels, and remodelling of the blood vessel wall. To carry out these roles, the endothelium autonomously interprets a complex environment crammed with signals from hormones, neurotransmitters, pericytes, smooth muscle cells, various blood cells, viral or bacterial infection and proinflammatory cytokines. It is generally assumed that the endothelium responds to these instructions with coordinated responses in a homogeneous population of endothelial cells. Here, we highlight evidence that shows that neighbouring endothelial cells are highly heterogeneous and display different sensitivities to various activators. Cells with various sensitivities process different extracellular signals into distinct streams of information in parallel, like a vast switchboard. Communication occurs among cells and new 'emergent' signals are generated that are non-linear composites of the inputs. Emergent signals cannot be predicted or deduced from the properties of individual cells. Heterogeneity and emergent behaviour bestow capabilities on the endothelial collective that far exceed those of individual cells. The implications of heterogeneity and emergent behaviour for understanding vascular disease and drug discovery are discussed.
In this paper we discuss probe properties in terms of probe currents, probe sizes, energy spread, virtual source sizes, and brightness in a 1.2-MV cold field-emission (cold FE) transmission electron microscope (TEM) equipped with a magnetic gun lens. The probe size increased gradually in proportion to the (3/8)th power of the probe current, very unusual behavior in cold FE guns but typical behavior in thermionic guns. This is due to the magnetic gun lens, which caused large emission angles for electron beams in the probe before being limited by aberrations at the gun and acceleration tube. The brightness reached the maximum at 1.62 × 1014 A/(m2sr) and then decreased with increasing the emission current. The energy spread of the beam, including the Boersch effect, was 0.32-0.50 eV, comparable to that of conventional cold FE guns without magnetic gun lens. Experimental analysis indicated that neither noises nor aberrations caused the probe size increase under the optimized illumination condition. The virtual source size increased from 11.1 to 24.7 nm with the increase in the emission current. To describe this behavior, we conjecture that this brightness reduction is due to increase in the virtual source size caused by trajectory displacement created by stochastic Coulomb interactions near the emitter.
Early-branching anaerobic fungi are critical for hydrolyzing untreated lignocellulose in the digestive tracts of large herbivorous animals. While these fungi were discovered more than 40 years ago, they remain understudied and underexploited. Recent advances in -omics technologies, however, have enabled studies that reveal significant biosynthetic potential within anaerobic fungal genomes for diverse biotechnological applications. Applications range from enhanced second-generation bioenergy platforms to improved animal health. However, developing gut fungi for these applications will require significant advances in genome engineering technologies for these organisms. Here, we review the biotechnological abilities of anaerobic fungi and highlight challenges that must be addressed to develop them for a range of biotechnological applications.
The aim of this review was to scrutinize the current literature available on teratogenic safety of third-generation antiepileptic drugs (TGAEDs) considering their clinical implications and to highlight for further research need in the interest of the diseased population in general and women with epilepsy in particular. For evaluation of the teratogenic potential of TGAEDs, this review summarized the existing information on controlled clinical trials conducted by the pharmaceutical companies, case reports, scholarly articles (prospective and retrospective studies), and experimental tests carried out so far. Firstly, clinical reports have reviewed on each drug followed by non-clinical studies reported hitherto. The Pub-Med and Google search engine was used to explore the relevant articles with pertinent keywords like pregnancy, epilepsy, seizures, women with epilepsy, antiepileptic or anticonvulsant drugs, first-second/new and third/ newest generation antiepileptic drugs, teratogenicity, teratological potential, birth defects, congenital anomalies, epilepsy and pregnancy registries, malformation surveillance program. The search was also carried out by the individual name of 20 third-generation AEDs. This review declared that although much research has been carried out on clinical and non-clinical implications for the assessment of the teratogenic potential of FGAEDs and SGAEDs, reports on the teratogenic safety of TGAEDs are still limited. It is concluded that there is an urgent need to exaggerate a large number of clinical intervention trials/reports and experimental studies to draw a definite conclusion for the teratogenic safety of TGAEDs. This is a pioneer attempt by our laboratory to review the teratogenic potential of third-generation antiepileptic drugs.
Propolis is a resinous material extracted from bee glue with a complex chemical composition. The unique biological properties of propolis have led to its use in alternative medicine and as a nutritional supplement. Recent research shows that propolis could affect the immune system by decreasing the production of inflammatory cytokines and potentiating an effect on resident stem cells. The exact mechanism, however, is unknown. The goal of this study was to demonstrate whether green propolis extract affects any characteristic properties of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)in vitro.
The cytocompatibility of propolis extract and the proliferation of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMMSCs) in the presence of propolis was evaluated by live/dead cell staining and MTS viability assay over a period of 3 days. Also, we evaluated the effect of propolis extract on trilineage differentiation and migration capacity of undifferentiated and differentiated BMMSCs.
Relative to the control, propolis extract resulted in a significant and linear increase in the proliferation of MSCs and inhibited the osteogenic differentiation of BMMSCs, while there was a potentiation of chondrogenesis and adipogenesis. Finally, in relevance to wound healing, an in vitro scratch assay demonstrated that the migratory potential of differentiated BMMSCs was enhanced in the presence of propolis.
We have demonstrated that propolis extract was not toxic to BMMSCs (&lt;400 μg/ml), supported their proliferation, potentiated chondrogenic and adipogenic differentiation processes, and supported cell migrationin vitro. Most interestingly, there was a down-regulation of osteogenesis. These data support the use of propolis extract for enhanced cell proliferation and tissue regeneration; however, it warrants further investigation.
The large between-person differences in symptomatology suggest that major depressive disorder (MDD) is a heterogeneous psychiatric disorder. However, symptom-specific prospective studies are scarce. We hypothesized that chronicity (i.e., being depressed for 24 months during a patient's preceding 48 months at baseline) and neuroticism at baseline would predict adverse course trajectories over 9 years of follow up with differential magnitudes for individual depressive symptoms.
In total, 560 patients with a current MDD were included from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA-cohort). We used a multivariate linear mixed model with repeated measures, with a history of chronicity and neuroticism separately as main independent variables and with Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology self-report (IDS-SR) item scores as outcome variables. For each individual symptom, the model was adjusted for age, gender, and baseline depression severity.
Patients were on average 42.7 (SD = 12.1) years old and 64.7% were women. Patients with chronic depression or high levels of neuroticism showed similar absolute rates of decline over time compared to their counterparts. However, because symptoms had higher starting points for mood, cognitive, and somatic/vegetative symptoms (in that order), symptom severity remained higher over time. Chronicity and neuroticism were especially linked to persistent low self-esteem and high interpersonal sensitivity.
Neuroticism is partly state dependent and likely affected by depression severity.
Chronicity and neuroticism predict long-term persistence of diverse psychiatric symptoms, in particular low self-esteem and high interpersonal sensitivity.
Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) provides unprecedented insights into the molecular constituents of biological environments. In combination with an image processing method called subtomogram averaging (STA), detailed 3D structures of biological molecules can be obtained in large, irregular macromolecular assemblies or in situ, without the need for purification. The contextual meta-information these methods also provide, such as a protein's location within its native environment, can then be combined with functional data. This allows the derivation of a detailed view on the physiological or pathological roles of proteins from the molecular to cellular level. Despite their tremendous potential in in situ structural biology, cryo-ET and STA have been restricted by methodological limitations, such as the low obtainable resolution. Exciting progress now allows one to reach unprecedented resolutions in situ, ranging in optimal cases beyond the nanometer barrier. Here, I review current frontiers and future challenges in routinely determining high-resolution structures in in situ environments using cryo-ET and STA.
Oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding fold (OB-fold) plays a major role in the regulation of central dogma of life via binding though DNA and RNA. The OB-fold domains are diverse in nature and present in large number of proteins with verities of molecular functions. Here, we have investigated the distribution of sequence, structure and repeats of cold shock DNA-binding proteins (CSDB), a member of OB-fold, in all three kingdoms to establish functional relationships. The CSDB is consists of 30 domains with a major contribution of S1 (&gt;110,601 sequences), S12 (&gt;23,760 sequences), S17 (&gt;14,833 sequences) and S28e (&gt;1615 sequence) domains. These domains are largely found in bacteria (70-90%). The number of S1 domain repeats in eukaryota varies from 1 to 15 and are well-correlated with the protein size. The molecular function analysis suggests that a large number of repeats in the S1 domain are involved in diverse molecular functions in bacteria and eukaryotes. In-depth structure analysis of S1, S12, S17 and S28e domain-containing proteins of the OB-fold family provides a reasonable basis to understand the relationship of size and number of repeats with the corresponding molecular functions.
The accelerated elucidation of three-dimensional structures of protein complexes, both natural and designed, is providing new examples of large supramolecular assemblies with intriguing shapes. Those with high symmetry - based on the geometries of the Platonic solids - are particularly notable as their innately closed forms create interior spaces with varying degrees of enclosure. We survey known protein assemblies of this type and discuss their geometric features. The results bear on issues of protein function and evolution, while also guiding novel bioengineering applications. Recent successes using high-symmetry protein assemblies for applications in interior encapsulation and exterior display are highlighted.
Tubedown-1 (tbdn-1) is a mammalian homologue of the N-terminal acetyltransferase subunit NAT1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and copurifies with an acetyltransferase activity. Tbdn-1 expression in endothelial cells becomes downregulated during the formation of capillary-like structures in vitro and is regulated in vivo in a manner which suggests a functional role in dampening blood vessel development. Here we show that tbdn-1 is expressed highly in the vitreal vascular network (tunica vasculosa lentis and vasa hyaloidea propria) during the pruning and remodeling phases of this transient structure. The vitreal blood vessels of mice harboring a targeted inactivation of TGF-beta2 fail to remodel and abnormally accumulate, a phenomenon reminiscent of the ocular pathology resembling persistent fetal vasculature (PFV) in humans. Since suppression of normal tbdn-1 expression has been previously observed in retinal vessel proliferation, we analyzed vitreal vascular changes and tbdn-1 expression in TGF-beta2(-/-) eyes. The nuclei of vitreal vessel endothelial cells in TGF-beta2(-/-) eyes express proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and exhibit increased levels of active (P42/44)mitogen-activated protein kinase (phospho-(P42/44)MAPK), characteristics consistent with proliferative endothelial cells. In contrast to normal vitreal vessels, collagen IV expression exhibited a disorganized pattern in the TGF-beta2(-/-) vitreal vessels, suggesting vessel disorganization and possibly a breakdown of vessel basal laminae. Moreover, vitreal vessels of TGF-beta2(-/-) mice lack expression of pericyte markers (CD13, alpha smooth muscle actin) and show ultrastructural changes consistent with pericyte degeneration. The accumulating vitreal blood vessels of TGF-beta2(-/-) mice, while maintaining expression of the endothelial marker von Willebrand Factor, show a significant decrease in the expression of tbdn-1. We addressed the functional role of tbdn-1 in the regulation of vitreal blood vessels using an in vitro model of choroid-retina capillary outgrowth. Clones of the RF/6A fetal choroid-retina endothelial cell line showing suppression of tbdn-1 levels after overexpression of an antisense TBDN-1 cDNA display a significant increase in the formation of capillary-like structures in vitro compared with controls. These findings suggest that tbdn-1 inhibits capillary-like formation in vitro and may serve to dampen vitreal blood vessel formation preceding the regression of the vitreal vasculature during development. Our results also suggest that tbdn-1 may participate with TGF-beta2 in regulating normal development of the vitreal vasculature.
We have used an embryonic endothelial cell line (IEM cells) as an experimental system for identifying and characterizing new molecules which are regulated during blood vessel development. A novel gene isolated from IEM cells, tubedown-1 (tbdn-1), is expressed at high levels in unstimulated IEM cells and is downregulated during formation of capillary tube structures by the IEM cells induced by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in vitro. Tbdn-1 is also downregulated in M1 myeloid leukemia cells after differentiation in response to LIF in vitro. Tbdn-1 is homologous to the yeast NAT-1 N-terminal acetyltransferases and encodes a novel protein of approximately 69 kDa associated with an acetyltransferase activity. Levels and distribution of tbdn-1 expression are regulated in both endothelial and hematopoietic cells during development in tissues such as the yolk sac blood islands, heart, and liver blood vessels. In the adult, tbdn-1 expression is low or undetected in most organs examined with the exception of the atrial endocardium, the endothelial and myeloid compartments of bone marrow, and the remodeling vascular bed of atretic ovarian follicles. The distribution and regulation of expression of tbdn-1 suggest that this novel acetyltransferase may be involved in regulating vascular and hematopoietic development and physiologic angiogenesis.
Identification of novel proteins involved in retinal neovascularization may facilitate new and more effective molecular-based treatments for proliferative retinopathy. Tubedown-1 (Tbdn-1) is a novel protein that shows homology to the yeast acetyltransferase subunit NAT1 and copurifies with an acetyltransferase activity. Tbdn-1 is expressed in normal retinal endothelium but is specifically suppressed in retinal endothelial cells from patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The purpose of this study was to investigate the importance of Tbdn-1 expression in retinal blood vessels in vivo.
A bitransgenic mouse model that enables conditional knockdown of Tbdn-1 specifically in endothelial cells was produced and studied using molecular, histologic, and immunohistochemical techniques and morphometric analysis.
Tbdn-1-suppressed mice exhibited retinal and choroidal neovascularization with intra- and preretinal fibrovascular lesions similar to human proliferative retinopathies. Retinal lesions observed in Tbdn-1-suppressed mice increased in severity with prolonged suppression of Tbdn-1. In comparison to normal retina, the retinal lesions displayed alterations in the basement membrane of blood vessels and in the distribution of glial and myofibroblastic cells. Moreover, the pathologic consequences of Tbdn-1 knockdown in endothelium were restricted to the retina and the choroid.
These results indicate that the maintenance of Tbdn-1 expression is important for retinal blood vessel homeostasis and for controlling retinal neovascularization in adults. Restoration of Tbdn-1 protein expression and/or activity may provide a novel approach for treating proliferative retinopathies.
Identification of unique proteins involved in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) may facilitate new and more effective diagnostic tools and molecular-based treatments for ROP. Tubedown-1 (Tbdn-1), a novel homeostatic protein which copurifies with an acetyltransferase activity, is expressed in normal retinal endothelium and is specifically suppressed in retinal endothelial cells from patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Furthermore, recent in vivo knockdown studies in mice have revealed that Tbdn-1 is important for retinal blood vessel homeostasis and for preventing retinal neovascularization in adults. The purpose of the present study was to determine if the expression pattern of Tbdn-1 is altered during oxygen-induced retinal neovascularization in mice and in a specimen of stage 3 human ROP.
Specimens of oxygen-induced retinal neovascularization in mice, and a single specimen of active stage 3 ROP were studied by immunohistochemistry and digital image analysis using antibodies raised against Tbdn-1 and other blood vessel markers.
The pattern of Tbdn-1 expression during the course of oxygen-induced retinal neovascularization in mice suggests a regulating role in neonatal retinopathy. Retinal lesions from oxygen-induced retinal neovascularization in mice display suppression of retinal endothelial Tbdn-1 protein expression in conjunction with an increase in expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (a marker of proliferation) and alpha smooth muscle actin (a marker of myofibroblastic cells). Abnormal blood vessels within vitreoretinal neovascular lesions in a human specimen of active stage 3 ROP did not show Tbdn-1 protein expression.
These results suggest that the loss of retinal endothelial Tbdn-1 expression may be a contributing factor in retinal blood vessel proliferation in ROP.
In this study, we explored how sterol metabolism altered by the expression of cholesterol-7alpha-hydroxylase NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (7alpha-hydroxylase) affects the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation of translocation-arrested apoB53 in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Stable expression of two different plasmids that encode either rat or human 7alpha-hydroxylase inhibited the ubiquitin conjugation of apoB and its subsequent degradation by the proteasome. Oxysterols (25-hydroxycholesterol and 7-ketocholesterol) reversed the inhibition of apoB degradation caused by 7alpha-hydroxylase. The combined results suggest that the normally rapid proteasome degradation of translocation-arrested apoB can be regulated by a sterol-sensitive polyubiquitin conjugation step in the endoplasmic reticulum. Blocked ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation caused translocation-arrested apoB to become sequestered in segregated membrane domains. Our results described for the first time a novel mechanism through which the "quality control" proteasome endoplasmic reticulum degradative pathway of translocation-arrested apoB is linked to sterol metabolism. Sterol-sensitive blocked ubiquitin conjugation appears to selectively inhibit the proteasome degradation of apoB, but not 7alpha-hydroxylase protein, with no impairment of cell vitality or function. Our findings may help to explain why the hepatic production of lipoproteins is increased when familial hypertriglyceridemic patients are treated with drugs that activate 7alpha-hydroxylase (e.g. bile acid-binding resins).
Factors that affect serum levels of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol were studied in the rat. Serum levels of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol differed in male and female rats fed regular chow (male; 0.2 +/- 0.1 nmol/ml (mean +/- SD); n = 8; female; 0.4 +/- 0.1 nmol/ml; n = 8). When rats were fed with chow to which 3% cholestyramine had been added, the level increased significantly, particularly in female rats (male; 0.6 +/- 0.3 nmol/ml; n = 8; female; 2.4 +/- 1.5 nmol/ml; n = 8). The liver activity of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for degradation of cholesterol, did not show any sex differences, irrespective of whether the animals were fed with regular chow (male; 51 +/- 15 pmol/min per mg protein; n = 8; female; 58 +/- 21 pmol/min per mg protein; n = 8), or the cholestyramine-supplemented chow (male; 162 +/- 33 pmol/min per mg protein; n = 8; female; 172 +/- 33 pmol/min per mg protein; n = 8). In contrast, the activity of 3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-C27-steroid dehydrogenase, which acts after cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase in the catabolism of cholesterol, showed a marked difference between the sexes. In both sexes this enzyme activity was higher in cholestyramine-treated rats (male; 963 +/- 78 pmol/min per mg protein; n = 8; female; 708 +/- 106 pmol/min per mg protein, n = 8) compared to that in that rats received regular chow (male; 622 +/- 83 pmol/min per mg protein; n = 8; female; 469 +/- 41 pmol/min per mg protein; n = 8). If the serum level of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol depended solely on the enzyme activity of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, it would be difficult to explain these sex differences, since there were no sex differences in levels of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase. These results clearly indicate that, in the rat, the serum level of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol depends not only on cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity but also on 3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-C27-steroid dehydrogenase activity.
The report of a novel cytochrome P450 enzyme in mouse hippocampus (cyp7b) with close homology to cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase led us to determine the substrate specificity with respect to 27-hydroxycholesterol, known to be a potent inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis. Transfection of 293/T-cells with PcDNA3.1(+)-mcyp7b was followed by metabolism of 2.5 microM 27-hydroxycholesterol to the 7 alpha-hydroxy intermediate, cholest-5-ene,3 beta,7 alpha,27-triol, with complete loss of down-regulation of cholesterol synthesis. Addition of 5 microM and 10 microM concentrations of the triol to HepG2 and CHO cells, respectively, also did not reduce cholesterol synthesis. The contrast between the biologic effect on cholesterol synthesis by these two C27 hydroxysterols and the wide tissue distribution of both cholesterol 27-hydroxylase and hydroxysterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase implies local regulatory effects prior to their further catabolism in the liver to chenodeoxycholic and cholic acids.
Serum levels of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol have been shown to reflect the activity of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, the key enzyme of bite acid synthesis in the liver, but a comparison with direct measurements of bile acid synthesis rates has never been performed.
7 alpha-Hydroxycholesterol was measured by gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and bile acid synthesis by the fecal balance method in 35 subjects.
A significant correlation was found between 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol concentration in serum and bile acid synthesis (r = 0.863, p &lt; 0.001). Serum levels of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol in 20 patients treated with a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor did not differ from levels obtained in healthy volunteers (78 +/- 7 ng/ml versus 63 +/- 5 ng/ml; NS). Treatment with fenofibrate reduced 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol concentrations in six patients from 107 +/- 47 ng/ml to 61 +/- 12 ng/ml (p &lt; 0.05).
We conclude that the concentration of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol in serum is an indicator of bile acid synthesis and that serum levels of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol are not affected in patients treated with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors but are affected in those treated with fenofibrate.
The recognition that the 7 alpha-hydroxylation of 27-hydroxycholesterol is catalyzed by an enzyme that is different from cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase raises the question as to the number of similar enzymes that may be present in liver and subserve bile acid synthesis. Thus, both 3 beta-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid and 3 beta-hydroxy-5-cholenoic acid, further oxidation products derived from 27-hydroxycholesterol, are also 7 alpha-hydroxylated during their metabolism to chenodeoxycholic acid. Using a microsomal fraction of hamster liver and competition plot analysis, we found that the 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity for the acid substrates was approximately one-tenth that found for 27-hydroxycholesterol. Mixtures of the different substrates did not depress the total rate of 7 alpha-hydroxylation. The evidence supports the view that these substrates share the same catalytic site on a single enzyme.
Alterations of hepatic cholesterol metabolism in patients with cholesterol gallstones are still controversial. This study investigated whether hepatic cholesterol metabolism is altered in Japanese patients with cholesterol gallstones.
In this systematic study of 24 middle-aged nonobese and nondiabetic Japanese patients who had cholesterol gallstones and were undergoing elective cholecystectomy, an analysis of three regulatory enzymes in the cholesterol metabolism, as well as cytosolic total and free cholesterol levels and sterol carrier protein 2/nonspecific lipid transfer protein (SCP2/nsLTP) levels, was conducted using liver biopsy samples obtained during surgery.
The activities of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, and acyl-CoA/cholesterol acyltransferase were not significantly different between patients and controls. Nevertheless, patients with gallstones showed tendencies for elevated HMG-CoA reductase activity and protein content and decreased cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activities. As anticipated, serum levels of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol and squalene paralleled these findings. The patients with gallstones also had significantly increased cytosolic total and free cholesterol levels (P &lt; 0.001), which correlated strongly with increased cytosolic levels of SCP2/nsLTP (r = 0.80, P &lt; 0.001 and r = 0.81, P &lt; 0.001, respectively).
The results suggest that intracellular cholesterol transport is enhanced in patients with cholesterol gallstones.
Patients with cholesterol gallstones have a reduced pool of bile acids. This study was undertaken to clarify the mechanism by which bile acid biosynthesis does not increase to supranormal levels to cause a reexpansion of the pool. We investigated the first two steps of the bile acid biosynthesis pathway by assaying the activities of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway, and 3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-C27-steroid dehydrogenase/isomerase, and by measuring the concentrations of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol and 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one in liver specimens from ten patients with cholesterol gallstones and ten gallstone-free controls. In the patients with gallstones, cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity, 3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-C27-steroid dehydrogenase/isomerase activity, and hepatic 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one concentration did not significantly different from levels in controls, but hepatic 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol concentration was more than twofold that of controls (12.9 +/- 2.6 vs 5.3 +/- 1.2 nmol/g liver, P &lt; 0.01). The concentration of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol positively correlated with the ratio of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity to 3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-C27-steroid dehydrogenase/isomerase activity (r = 0.93; P &lt; 0.005) in the gallstone-free controls. In contrast, this correlation disappeared in the patients with gallstones. These results suggest a derangement of the normal 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol metabolism in the patients with gallstones. The reason for the accumulation of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol remains unclear; however, it is possible that, in patients with cholesterol gallstone, the accumulated 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol causes inappropriate suppression of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity by product inhibition.
During studies on the regulation of rat ovarian steroidogenic enzymes by interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), we observed substantial metabolism of 25-hydroxycholesterol to two unusual polar products. This unexpected effect was observed both in isolated granulosa cells and in whole ovarian dispersates and was also induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha, but not by insulin-like growth factor I or follicle-stimulating hormone. The effect was dependent on time and the dose of IL-1 beta and was blocked by and IL-1 receptor antagonist. The formation of the polar metabolites was inhibited by ketoconazole and trilostane, but not by aminoglutethimide. Subsequent purification of these novel metabolites and analysis by gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry, NMR, and high performance liquid chromatography revealed them to be related 7 alpha-hydroxylated hydroxycholesterols (cholest-4-ene-7 alpha,25-diol-3-one and cholest-5-ene-3 beta,7 alpha,25-triol). IL-1 beta-stimulated ovarian 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity (3-10 pmol/min/mg of cellular protein) was nearly 4-fold that of control levels using 25-hydroxycholesterol as substrate. Activities at or below control levels were observed when IL-1 beta-treated cell sonicates were boiled or assayed in the presence of NADH (rather than NADPH), indicating that involvement of a nonenzymatic process was unlikely. IL-1 beta-stimulated 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity was inhibited to basal levels by a 10-fold excess of unlabeled 25- or 27-hydroxycholesterol, but not by cholesterol, pregnenolone, progesterone, testosterone, or dehydroepiandrosterone, suggesting that ovarian 7 alpha-hydroxylase is specific for hydroxycholesterols. Furthermore, when IL-1 beta-treated ovarian cultures were incubated with radiolabeled cholesterol or testosterone, no 7 alpha-hydroxylated products were observed. We were also unable to detect any mRNA transcripts for liver cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase in IL-1 beta-stimulated ovarian cultures. This study describes an ovarian hydroxycholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase that differs from liver cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase and from other nonhepatic progestin/ androgen 7 alpha-hydroxylases. The novel finding of the regulation of a 7 alpha-hydroxylase by IL-1 beta (and tumor necrosis factor alpha) suggests a unique role for cytokines in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism in the ovary and possibly other tissues.
The metabolism of 27-hydroxycholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol was studied in cultures of human diploid fibroblasts. Both steroids underwent 7 alpha-hydroxylation with subsequent oxidation to 7 alpha-hydroxy-3-oxo-delta 4 steroids. A minor fraction of the 27-hydroxysteroids was oxidized to acids. Competition experiments indicated that both hydroxycholesterols were hydroxylated by the same enzyme, different from cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase. 7 alpha,25-Dihydroxycholesterol suppressed the activity of HMG-CoA reductase at least as effectively as 25-hydroxycholesterol whereas 7 alpha,25-dihydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one was a less effective suppressor. The results suggest that cholesterol might be converted to 7 alpha-hydroxylated bile acid precursors in extrahepatic tissues in vivo and that the regulation of the activity of HMG-CoA reductase by oxysterols might be modulated by 7 alpha-hydroxylation and subsequent oxidation by 3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-C27-steroid dehydrogenase/isomerase.
The importance of cholesterol and "oxysterols" in the regulation of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase is not clear. Previous in vivo studies suggest that cholesterol may up-regulate cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid biosynthesis, but these studies are open to question as they were carried out in whole animals. Therefore, we used primary rat hepatocytes, cultured in serum-free medium, to determine the effects of cholesterol on the regulation of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase. Squalestatin, a specific squalene synthase inhibitor, was used to block sterol but not isoprenoid biosynthesis in this system. Squalestatin (1 microM) decreased cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase specific activity to undetectable levels and decreased steady-state mRNA and transcriptional activity to 13% and 47% of controls, respectively. Mevalonolactone (2 mM) failed to restore cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase specific activity or steady-state mRNA levels in squalestatin-treated cells. Addition of cholesterol, delivered in beta-cyclodextrin, to squalestatin-treated cells restored cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase specific activity and steady-state mRNA to control levels in a concentration (25 microM to 200 microM) -dependent manner. In contrast, the individual addition of selected "oxysterols" (5-cholesten-3 beta, 7 alpha-diol; 5 alpha-cholestan-3 beta, 6 alpha-diol; cholestan-3 beta, 5 alpha,6 beta-triol; 5-(25R)-cholesten-3 beta,26-diol, all at 50 microM) failed to restore cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase mRNA levels in squalestatin-treated cells. These experiments provide evidence that cholesterol rather than "oxysterols" regulate cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase gene expression. Squalestatin (1 microM) treatment increased HMG-CoA reductase specific activity by 229% of controls. Addition of cholesterol (200 microM), but not mevalonolactone (2 mM), to squalestatin-treated cells decreased HMG-CoA reductase specific activity to 19% of control. The primary rat hepatocyte culture system in conjunction with a specific squalene synthetase inhibitor should be a useful model for elucidating the mechanism of regulation of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase gene expression by sterols.
The initial biosynthetic conversions of cholesterol to the bile acids involve sequential 7 alpha-hydroxylation (catalyzed by cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase) followed by C-3 oxidation and concomitant double bond migration (to a delta 4-configuration, catalyzed by 3 beta-delta 5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase) to provide 7 alpha-hydroxycholest-4-en-3-one. A straightforward, and economical, preparation (on a 0.1 g scale) of this pivotal biosynthetic intermediate has been devised. Reduction of 3 beta-(benzoyloxy)-cholest-5-en-7-one with LiB(sec-butyl)3H provided a 4:1 mixture, respectively, of the 7 alpha- and 7 beta-hydroxy diastereomers, which were separated chromatographically. Solvolytic removal of the C-3 benzoyl group gave 3 beta,7 alpha-cholest-5-ene-3,7-diol. A suspension of the 1:1 (v/v) complex (formed by mutual dissolution in MeOH, followed by evaporation of the solvent) of this diol with hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin, at a concentration of 1 mg mL-1 (in neutral phosphate buffer), was converted by Brevibacterium sp cholesterol oxidase (0.25 U mg-1 of substrate) and catalase (70 U mg-1 of substrate, to recover O2 from the H2O2 produced by the enzymatic oxidation) to a suspension of 7 alpha-hydroxycholest-4-en-3-one and the hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin. The yield for the enzymatic conversion was in excess of 90%. A much poorer and less reproducible yield (&lt; 20%) was seen in the absence of the hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin. Routine extraction of this aqueous suspension, and chromatographic purification (85:15 CHCl3/acetone v/v on silica) of the residue, gave pure 7 alpha-hydroxycholest-4-en-3-one in 68% isolated yield. This route is a significant improvement, in terms of reaction scale and convenience, over the previous procedures for the preparation of this steroid.
27-hydroxycholesterol is shown to be 7 alpha-hydroxylated by microsomal preparations of rat brain. The apparent Km was about 2 microM and Vmax about 15 pmol/min x mg protein. The reaction might modulate biological functions of 27-hydroxycholesterol, such as its suppressive effect on the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, and supports the possibility of bile acid formation in the brain.
Hepatic cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase is a rate-limiting enzyme for bile acid synthesis, and we have previously shown that the serum 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol level reflects the enzyme activity in patients with an intact liver. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the alterations in hepatic cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity and the serum 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol level after hepatectomy and the correlations between these parameters and liver mass. Hepatic cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity, the serum 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol level and the remaining liver weight were determined after 70% hepatectomy in rats. Cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity was decreased on days 1 and 2 (from 28.3 +/- 3.7 to 8.5 +/- 2.8 and 13.3 +/- 3.6 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively), returned to the preoperative level on day 3 (24.7 +/- 2.6 pmol/min/mg protein) and further elevated thereafter (71.4 +/- 10.9 on day 7 and 51.3 +/- 6.6 pmol/min/mg protein on day 14). The serum level of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol changed simultaneously with the enzyme activity, and a significant correlation between the two parameters was observed (r = 0.915, p &lt; 0.0001). The correlations between the liver weight and hepatic cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity and serum 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol level were significant (p &lt; 0.01), but the significances disappeared for the period of days 3-14 (r = 0.424, p = 0.08; r = 0.299, p = 0.228, respectively). In conclusion, hepatic cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity is suppressed by hepatectomy and then activated as the liver regenerates. The serum 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol level is a good parameter of this enzyme activity after partial hepatectomy.
Bile acid synthesis from cholesterol can occur via two pathways, one initiated by sterol 27-hydroxylase activity or one initiated by that of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase. In contrast to cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, which is found in the liver, sterol 27-hydroxylase is a widely distributed mitochondrial enzyme with high activity in vascular endothelial cells. Although both pathways lead to the production of chenodeoxycholic and cholic acids, the key step, 7 alpha-hydroxylation, is governed by two different enzymes. Both 27-hydroxycholesterol and 3 beta-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid, the metabolites of cholesterol occurring via sterol 27-hydroxylase activity, normally circulate in plasma. After their uptake by the liver they are metabolized mostly to chenodeoxycholic acid, which down-regulates the activity of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, the rate-limiting step for the production of bile acids in the liver. Because of this relationship and also in view of the accelerated atherosclerosis and cholesterol deposition in tissues that occur as a consequence of genetically determined sterol 27-hydroxylase deficiency and of the potent biologic effect of 27-hydroxycholesterol in cell culture, it is proposed that this metabolic pathway serves a regulatory function. The pathway beginning with cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylation is modulated by genetic, hormonal, and probably dietary factors, and becomes most prominent with the interruption of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids.
Bile salt uptake, synthesis and secretion by the human hepatoma-derived cell line HepG2 were studied. The cells transported and secreted bile salts largely by means of passive mechanisms. The cells synthesized and secreted the normal human primary bile salts. The ratio of cholate to chenodeoxycholate was 1.5:1. The degree of conjugation, about 35%, was lower than normal, and the glycine-to-taurine ratio was abnormal (4.5:1). This was not due to amino acid deficiency in the medium. Contrary to the report of others, little 3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha-trihydroxy-5 beta-cholestan-26-oic acid was secreted. This was confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The total rate of synthesis was about 33% that of normal liver. The specific activity of bile salts synthesized from [3H]mevalonate was about 20 times higher than that of the cellular cholesterol derived from the same precursor. The regulation of bile salt synthesis by two compounds that could alter the precursor pool of cholesterol was studied. After a 24-hr incubation in serum-free medium, the compound 25(OH)cholesterol inhibited the rate of bile salt synthesis compared with control values, possibly by depleting the intracellular free cholesterol pool. Surprisingly, however, progesterone, which inhibits cholesterol esterification and should have expanded this pool, also inhibited bile salt synthesis under those conditions. The effect of these compounds on the level of mRNA for cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase was also determined by Northern-blot analysis. The cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase mRNA was 3.7 kb, similar to that in the rat. The incubation of cells in 25(OH)cholesterol or progesterone, as above, resulted in a decreased level of mRNA. The reduction was proportional to the reduction in bile salt synthesis, suggesting that these compounds act at a pretranslational level. Taken together, these results suggest that our particular subclone of HepG2 cells will be useful for studies of the regulation of bile salt synthesis, but not of transport, by human liver-derived tissue.
Rat, pig and human liver microsomes were found to catalyze 7 alpha-hydroxylation of 25-hydroxycholesterol. In contrast to cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity, the 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity towards 25-hydroxycholesterol in rat liver was not stimulated by cholestyramine treatment. After transfection with cDNA for human cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, COS cells showed a significant activity towards cholesterol but not towards 25-hydroxycholesterol. During purification of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase from pig liver microsomes, about 99% of the 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity towards 25-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol was clearly separated from 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity for cholesterol. The small amount of 25-hydroxycholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity retained in a partially purified preparation of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase was not inhibited by addition of cholesterol, indicating that the oxysterol binding site is different from the cholesterol binding site, presumely due to the presence of two different enzymes. It is concluded that different enzymes are involved in 7 alpha-hydroxylation of cholesterol and 7 alpha hydroxylation of side-chain-oxidized cholesterol in rat, pig and human liver. Inhibition experiments with a partially purified fraction of the oxysterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase from pig liver gave results consistent with the contention that the same enzyme is responsible for 7 alpha hydroxylation of both 25-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol. It has been suggested that cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase can preferentially use oxysterols, in particular 25-hydroxycholesterol, as substrates and by this means inactivate important physiological regulators of cholesterol homeostasis. Such a mechanism would explain the unique property of the liver to resist down-regulation of the low-density-lipoprotein receptor [Dueland, S., Trawick, J.D., &amp; Davies, R.A. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 22695-22698]. The present results do not support the contention that the important coupling between cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity, the low-density-lipoprotein receptor activity and hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity in liver cells is due to inactivation of 25-hydroxycholesterol or 27-hydroxycholesterol by the action of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase.
A group of oxygenated sterols has been identified as physiological regulators of hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis. However, the regulatory effects of these oxysterols on cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid biosynthesis, is not clearly elucidated. We administered 0.1% 7-ketocholesterol (15 mg/day), a strong inhibitor of sterol synthesis, to rats orally for 6 days. Then, the levels of accumulated oxysterols in liver microsomes and microsomal 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity were determined. The results were compared to those in the groups of rats treated with either control diet or diets containing 0.1 or 1% cholesterol, 0.1% butylated hydroxytoluene, 3% cholestyramine or 1% taurocholate. 7-Ketocholesterol feeding resulted in significant increase of both 7-ketocholesterol and 7 beta-hydroxycholesterol in microsomal fraction (449.4 +/- 36.8 and 438.2 +/- 46.8 ng/mg protein, respectively; mean +/- S.E.). Hepatic microsomal 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity in the rats fed 7-ketocholesterol was significantly elevated as compared with those of control rats; 44.70 +/- 5.97 vs. 16.57 +/- 2.46 pmol/min per mg protein. Addition of BHT to 7-ketocholesterol reduced the accumulation of 7 beta-hydroxycholesterol, and the stimulatory effect of 7-ketocholesterol on 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity was suppressed. Our results demonstrate that oxysterols do not inhibit but rather stimulate hepatic microsomal 7 alpha-hydroxylase.
Transfection of COS-cells with a cDNA coding for human cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase resulted in significant production of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase enzyme and intracellular accumulation of the product, 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol. Presence of this enzyme activity was always associated with increased HMG CoA reductase activity. In five different independent transfection experiments resulting in a cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity of 0.26 +/- 0.05 pmol/min/mg in the transfected cells, the HMG CoA reductase activity increased to 158 +/- 14% of that of the control cells (p &lt; 0.01). This change was not associated with significant changes in the cholesterol content or LDL-receptor expression of the COS-cells. It is evident that the two key enzymes in cholesterol synthesis and degradation interact with each other also in extra-hepatic cells that are unable to degrade cholesterol into bile acids. Possible mechanisms for the finding is discussed.
A highly sensitive and specific method has been developed for determination of the level of 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one in plasma. This method is based on a stable isotope-dilution technique by gas chromatography-selected-ion monitoring mass spectrometry. 7 alpha-Hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one was extracted from plasma by saltingout extraction, and then purified by serial solid-phase extractions. The extract was treated with O-methylhydroxyl-amine hydrochloride and then dimethylethylsilylated. The resulting methyloxime-dimethylethylsilyl ether derivative was quantified by gas chromatography-selected-ion monitoring mass spectrometry with a high-resolution mode. The plasma levels of 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one were correlated with the cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity to a higher degree than those of any other form of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol (r = 0.84, n = 16, p &lt; 0.0001). The present method was applied to monitor the circadian rhythm of 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one levels in human plasma. It was concluded that the plasma level of 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one is a useful index for the monitoring of bile acid biosynthesis in the human liver.
Regulation of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase mRNA level in Hep-G2 cells was studied and compared with that of two other sterol-responsive genes, those for the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. In culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (complete medium) for up to 24 h, the mRNA for cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase gradually increased to 2-fold of the time 0 control. Culture of Hep-G2 cells in serum-free medium for 24 h resulted in stimulation of mRNA levels for LDL receptor (5-fold) and HMG-CoA reductase (6-fold). Surprisingly, the mRNA level for cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase also increased 5-fold at 8 h and 4-fold at 24 h compared with the time 0 control. The addition of beta-migrating very low density lipoprotein (beta-VLDL) (40 micrograms/ml) and 25-hydroxycholesterol (5 micrograms/ml) prevented the increase in mRNA level for the LDL receptor, and HMG-CoA reductase and the levels were 10-26% of the control at 8 h. The effect with beta-VLDL was sustained for 24 h. With 25-hydroxycholesterol, both LDL receptor and HMG-CoA reductase mRNA returned to base line by 24 h. In contrast, beta-VLDL increased cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase mRNA level above the serum-free control within 8 h (+32%), and this was sustained for 24 h (+47%). There was a slight induction of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase mRNA levels by 25-hydroxycholesterol at 8 h (+18%); but by 24 h, its level was below that of the control (-47%). There was no induction of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase mRNA levels by beta-VLDL or 25-hydroxycholesterol when the cells were grown in complete medium. As determined by nuclear run-on assay, the increase in the transcriptional rate of the cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase gene in cells grown in serum-free medium (3.9-fold of the rate in complete medium) and incubated with beta-VLDL (+68% above serum-free control) at 8 h, was comparable with the increase in mRNA levels (3.5-fold and +32%, respectively). When bile salts were added to serum-free medium and cells cultured for up to 24 h, chenodeoxycholate and glycochenodeoxycholate caused a marked suppression of the level of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase mRNA, while cholate and its conjugates did not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
The synthesis of bile acids by primary hamster hepatocytes in culture has been studied. Measurable rates of bile acid synthesis were obtained from cells prepared from livers of animals fed 2% w/w cholestyramine to induce the synthesis of bile acids through the rate-limiting enzyme cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase. The effects of various sources of substrate for bile acid synthesis in these cultured cells were examined over a period of 24 h and the results compared with published or parallel studies in primary rat hepatocytes or in the human hepatoma cell line, HepG2. In all the cells, bile acid synthesis was stimulated by the addition of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol, indicating the rate-limiting role of the cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase. Bile acid synthesis in the hamster hepatocytes was also stimulated by a variety of sources of cholesterol as substrate, mevalonic acid (increasing the production of newly-synthesised cholesterol in the cell), and as an exogenous source, hamster LDL. Similarly, if cholesterol was diverted from intracellular esterification using the ACAT inhibitor Dup128, a further increase in bile acid synthesis could be demonstrated. These results show that hepatocytes obtained from cholestyramine-treated hamsters are deficient in substrate cholesterol for bile acid synthesis. A similar conclusion can be drawn from the published work with rat hepatocytes and is further supported by experiments on the regulation of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity at the mRNA and the protein level, although some in vivo studies in animals and studies in man have led authors to suggest that cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase is saturated with substrate.
A quantitative HPLC method has been developed for measuring 3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase activity in rat liver microsomes. Apparent Km values of 23 and 27 microM were estimated for 5-cholestene-3 beta,7 alpha-diol and NAD+, respectively. A temperature optimum of 45 degrees C was estimated using standard assay conditions. It was observed that feeding cholesterol (2%) or cholestyramine (5%) to rats increased (twofold) specific activity. This method should prove useful in studies of the regulation of bile acid synthesis and complement the HPLC assay technique recently developed for measuring cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity.
Serum levels of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol and activities of hepatic microsomal cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase in surgical patients were analyzed by capillary gas-liquid chromatography-selected ion monitoring technique using a new internal standard, 5 alpha-cholestane-3 beta, 7 beta-diol. We found that concentrations of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol obtained after alkaline hydrolysis were higher than those without alkaline hydrolysis, indicating that a considerable amount of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol in human serum is present in esterified form. Esterified 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol could also be quantitatively hydrolyzed with cholesterol esterase, suggesting that fatty acid is bound at the 3 beta-position of the cholestenediol. The serum levels of esterified and free 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol in patients with cholelithiasis were 198.0 +/- 90.3 and 48.3 +/- 19.8 pmol/ml (mean +/- SD), respectively, and were similar to those in patients without hepatobiliary diseases. After treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid (300 mg per day) for 7 to 10 days, esterified and free 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol levels decreased to 64.9 +/- 33.6 and 20.5 +/- 11.1 pmol/ml, respectively. Activity of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase was also inhibited. Treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid (600 mg per day) for 7 to 10 days had no inhibitory effect on serum 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol levels and the enzyme activity. In all groups, high correlations were found between the activity of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase and serum levels of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol: free (r = 0.71, n = 38, P less than 0.001); esterified (r = 0.87, n = 38, P less than 0.001); total (r = 0.87, n = 38, P less than 0.001). Esterified and total 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol was more highly correlated with the enzyme activity than the free form. We conclude that a significant amount of 3 beta-acyl esters of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol is present in human serum and that serum levels of esterified and/or total 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol are likely to reflect the activity of hepatic cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase and thus the amount of primary bile acids synthesized in the liver.
Feedback regulation of bile acid synthesis by its end products was studied in cultured hepatocytes of young weaned pigs. We previously showed that conversion of exogenous [14C] cholesterol into bile acids was suppressed by addition of bile acids to the culture medium. In the present study, the effects of bile acids on bile acid mass production and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity were examined. Mass production of bile acids was strongly inhibited by addition of taurocholic acid (50 and 100 mumol/L) to the culture medium. The inhibitory action was exerted specifically on activity of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase because conversion of [14C] 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol to bile acids by pig hepatocytes was not affected. Suppression of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity after incubation of the hepatocytes with taurocholic acid was concentration- and time-dependent. Maximum suppression (-80%) was achieved after a 20 to 30 hr incubation of hepatocytes with 100 mumol/L of this bile acid. Decline of enzyme activity caused by 100 mumol/L taurocholic acid followed first-order kinetics with a half-life of 10 hr. Taurocholic acid had no direct effect on cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity in homogenates of hepatocytes as assessed by addition of the bile acid to the assay mixture. The effects of several other bile acids in a concentration of 100 mumol/L on cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity were examined in 48 hr incubations. Glycochenodeoxycholic and glycohyodeoxycholic acids, which are the major bile acids in pig bile, their unconjugated forms and also deoxycholic and cholic acid pronouncedly inhibited activity of the enzyme.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
To study the effect of steroid hormones on bile acid synthesis by cultured rat hepatocytes, cells were incubated with various amounts of these compounds during 72 h and conversion of [4-14C]cholesterol into bile acids was measured. Bile acid synthesis was stimulated in a dose-dependent way by glucocorticoids, but not by sex steroid hormones, pregnenolone or the mineralocorticoid aldosterone in concentrations up to 10 microM. Dexamethasone proved to be the most efficacious inducer, giving 3-fold and 7-fold increases in bile acid synthesis during the second and third 24 h incubation periods respectively, at a concentration of 50 nM. Mass production of bile acids as measured by g.l.c. during the second day of culture (28-52 h) was 2.2-fold enhanced by 1 microM-dexamethasone. No change in the ratio of bile acids produced was observed during this period in the presence of dexamethasone. Conversion of [4-14C]7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol, an intermediate of the bile acid pathway, to bile acids was not affected by dexamethasone. Measurement of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity in homogenates of hepatocytes, incubated with 1 microM-dexamethasone, showed 10-fold and 90-fold increases after 48 and 72 h respectively, as compared with control cells. As with bile acid synthesis from [14C]cholesterol, no change in enzyme activity was found in hepatocytes cultured in the presence of 10 microM steroid hormones other than glucocorticoids. Addition of inhibitors of protein and mRNA synthesis lowered bile acid production and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity and prevented the rise of both parameters with dexamethasone, suggesting regulation at the mRNA level. We conclude that glucocorticoids regulate bile acid synthesis in rat hepatocytes by induction of enzyme activity of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase.
A sensitive and precise method is described to assay cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity in homogenates of rat hepatocytes cultured in monolayers for up to 76 h. The assay is based on measurement of the amount of radioactive cholesterol converted into 7 alpha-[14C]-hydroxycholesterol. Since no subcellular fractionation was applied to measure enzyme activity, this method is rapid and can be performed with cell protein, corresponding to as little as 1 to 2 million hepatocytes. Optimal assay conditions were determined and the reproducibility of this cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase determination was established. Exogenous cholesterol (105 microM), solubilized in Tween 80, was added to saturate the enzyme, giving an apparent Km of 56 microM. Under these conditions, 70% of the cholesterol present in the homogenates is directly accessible to the cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase. The detection limit of the assay was found to be about 10 pmol per incubation. A time course of the cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity in cultured hepatocytes revealed that after an initial loss of approximately 60% of the activity as compared with 287 pmol/h/mg for freshly isolated cells, the enzyme activity was increased to the initial level in hepatocytes cultured for 52 h. This result and the finding that the cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity was diminished by 94% after a 24-h incubation with 5 microM cycloheximide suggest that the enzyme activity is associated with de novo protein synthesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
The possibility was investigated that the serum level of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol can be used as a marker for cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity. Six patients with gallstone disease were found to have a mean level of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol in serum of 30 +/- 4 ng/ml (mean +/- SEM) as measured by isotope dilution-mass spectrometry, using deuterated 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol as internal standard. After treatment with cholestyramine in a dose of 8 g twice daily for 2-3 weeks preoperatively, the serum level increased to 128 +/- 20 ng/ml (P less than 0.001). Eight other patients with gallstone disease had a mean level of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol in serum of 29 +/- 7 ng/ml. Treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid, 15 mg per kg body weight per day for 3-4 weeks before surgery, decreased the mean level to 20 +/- 7 ng/ml (P greater than 0.05). The activity of the cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase in liver biopsies taken during operation was found to be 38 +/- 5 pmol/min per mg of protein in the group of patients treated with cholestyramine and 1.3 +/- 0.5 pmol/min per mg in the group of patients treated with chenodeoxycholic acid. Liver biopsies from a group of untreated patients (n = 13) had a mean cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity of 7.6 +/- 1.5 pmol/min per mg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
Sandoz compound 58-035 has been shown to inhibit acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase activity in a variety of cell types. We have shown that it does not inhibit rat liver microsomal cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme of bile-acid synthesis, but it does inhibit acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase in both the microsomal fraction and in rat hepatocyte monolayers. To test the role of acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase in these cells, monolayers were incubated over 5 h in the presence and absence of 58-035 and in the presence of increasing amounts of mevalonic acid to provide a source of cholesterol. The addition of mevalonic acid increased the secretion of bile acids by the cells, and this was further increased by the addition of 58-035. The secretion of cholesteryl esters was conversely inhibited by the addition of 58-035. The results help define the role of acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase in determining the fate of intracellular cholesterol.
Sterol carrier protein2 (SCP2) is known to stimulate utilization of cholesterol in enzymic reactions in which cholesterol is the substrate. Substantial recent experimental evidence indicates that SCP2: activates enzymic conversion of intermediates between lanosterol and cholesterol; stimulates the microsomal conversion of cholesterol into cholesterol ester in rat liver; and enhances mitochondrial utilization of cholesterol for pregnenolone formation in the adrenals. The conversion of cholesterol into 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol is the rate-limiting step in bile-acid synthesis. We therefore investigated the effect of SCP2 on this physiologically critical reaction by using a gas-chromatography-mass-spectrometry procedure that measures the mass of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol formed. The results show that SCP2 enhances 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol formation by rat liver microsomes (microsomal fractions), utilizing either endogenous membrane cholesterol, cholesterol supplied exogenously in serum or in the form of cholesterol/phospholipid liposomes. Microsomes immunotitrated with anti-SCP2 antibody exhibited considerably less capacity to synthesize 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol, which was restored to control levels on addition of purified SCP2. These data are consistent with the suggestion that SCP2 may be of physiological significance in the overall metabolism of cholesterol.
In order to evaluate more definitively the observed aberrations in the synthesis of cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids in patients with advanced cirrhosis, two bile acid biosynthesis pathways were examined by determining the efficiency of conversion of [3H]7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol and [3H] 26-hydroxycholesterol to primary bile acids. Bile acid kinetics were determined by administration of [14C]cholic and [14C]chenodeoxycholic acids. Cholic acid synthesis in cirrhotic patients was markedly depressed (170 vs. 927 mumoles per day)( while chenodeoxycholic acid synthesis was reduced to a much lesser degree (227 vs. 550 mumoles per day). The administration of [3H]7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol allowed for an evaluation of the major pathway of bile acid synthesis via the 7 alpha-hydroxylation of cholesterol. This compound was efficiently incorporated into primary bile acids by the two normal subjects (88 and 100%) and two cirrhotic patients (77 and 91%). However, the recovery of the label in cholic acid was slightly less in cirrhotic patients than in normal subjects. [3H]26-hydroxycholesterol was administered to ascertain the contribution of the 26-hydroxylation pathway to bile acid synthesis. All study subjects showed poor conversion (9 to 22%) of this intermediate into bile acids. The results of this study suggest that a major block in the bile acid synthesis pathway in cirrhosis is at the level of 7 alpha-hydroxylation of cholesterol (impairment of 7 alpha-hydroxylase) and /or in the feedback triggering mechanism regulating bile acid synthesis. The data also suggest that the 26-hydroxylation pathway in normal subjects and patients with cirrhosis is a minor contributor to synthesis of the primary bile acids. Therefore, the relative sparing of chenodeoxycholic acid synthesis observed in cirrhotic patients is not due to preferential synthesis of this bile acid via the 26-hydroxylation pathway.
Formation of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol by rat liver microsomes was quantitated using a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer operated in selected ion monitoring mode. This procedure measures the mass of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol formed and does not require addition of labeled cholesterol to monitor the reaction, since endogenous microsomal cholesterol serves as substrate for the enzyme cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase. The method requires only the extraction of lipids from microsomal incubations and injection of a small fraction of this extract into the apparatus. Microsomes from normal rat livers incubated for different periods were found to yield increased 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol with time.
To determine the submicrosomal distribution of acyl-CoA-cholesterol acyltransferase and of cholesteryl esters, the microsomal fraction and the digitonin-treated microsomal preparation of rat liver were subjected to analytical centrifugation on sucrose density gradients. With untreated microsomal fractions the distribution profile and the median density of acyl-CoA-cholesterol acyltransferase were very similar to those of RNA. This is in contrast with hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase and cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase, which are confined to endoplasmic reticulum membranes with low ribosomal coating. In digitonin-treated microsomal preparations activity of acyl-CoA-cholesterol acyltransferase was not detectable. The labelling of untreated microsomal fractions with trace amounts of [(14)C]cholesterol followed by subfractionation of the labelled microsomal fraction showed that the specific radioactivity of cholesteryl esters obtained in vitro by the various subfractions was similar with all subfractions but different from the specific radioactivity of the 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol obtained in vitro by the same subfraction. These results demonstrate the existence of two pools of cholesterol confined to membranes from the endoplasmic reticulum, one acting as substrate for cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase and the other acting as substrate for acyl-CoA-cholesterol acyltransferase. The major part of cholesteryl esters present in both untreated and digitonin-treated microsomal fractions was distributed at densities similar to those of membranes from the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and at densities lower than those of smooth membranes from Golgi apparatus. The ratio of the concentrations of non-esterified to esterified cholesterol in the subfractions from both untreated and digitonin-treated microsomal fractions was highest at the maximum distribution of plasma membranes.
A method is described to determine the mass of 7alpha-hydroxy cholesterol synthetized in vitro by liver microsomes without the use of a radioactive substrate.
Rats of the Sprague-Dawley strain were infused intravenously with a fat emulsion (Intralipid, trademark of Kabi Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) containing 7-oxocholesterol. This resulted in an increased cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity in liver microsomes as compared to controls and was accompanied by increased levels of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase mRNA and microsomal cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase protein. Rats were also fed a cholestyramine-supplemented diet and infused with 7-oxocholesterol. These animals excreted about half as much bile acids in faeces as cholestyramine-fed controls. Addition of 7-oxocholesterol to liver microsomes from normal rats in amounts corresponding to those present in microsomes from 7-oxocholesterol-treated rats inhibited the cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity by about 75%. Cholesterol induced a type-I binding spectrum when added to a purified bacterial-expressed cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (P-450c7 delta 2-24). 7-Oxocholesterol competitively inhibited the cholesterol binding spectrum, while 7 beta-hydroxycholesterol did not interfere with binding of cholesterol to the enzyme. It is concluded that treatment with the competitive inhibitor 7-oxocholesterol leads to a reduced bile acid biosynthesis and, as a consequence of reduced bile acid inhibition, a compensatory increase in cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase synthesis. The high enzyme activity measured in microsomal preparations from 7-oxocholesterol-treated rats may be due to a continuous conversion of 7-oxocholesterol into less inhibitory metabolites, e.g. 7 beta-hydroxycholesterol. The latter compound was found in high concentrations in liver microsomes from rats treated with 7-oxocholesterol. The physiological importance of these results is discussed in relation to the previous findings that 7-oxocholesterol is accumulated in liver after cholesterol feeding and that 7-oxocholesterol is formed from cholesterol during lipid peroxidation.
A very sensitive and specific method for the simultaneous determination of mevalonate and 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol in human plasma is described. The assay is based on isotope dilution mass spectrometry: the extracts from plasma were treated with benzylamine followed by dimethylethylsilylimidazole, then the resulting dimethylethylsilyl ether derivatives of mevalonylbenzylamide and 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using high-resolution selected-ion monitoring. Simple regression analysis revealed significant correlations between the plasma level of mevalonate and the hepatic activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (EC 1.1.1.34) (r = 0.83, P &lt; 0.01) and between the plasma level of free 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol and the hepatic activity of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.7) (r = 0.76, P &lt; 0.05).
Sterol 27-hydroxylase, the mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the first step in oxidation of the sterol side chain in hepatic bile acid synthesis, also catalyzes the synthesis of 27-hydroxycholesterol from cholesterol. We have developed a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay for this enzyme, using either endogenous or exogenous cholesterol as substrate and cholesterol oxidase to convert 27-hydroxycholesterol to 4-cholesten-27-hydroxy-3-one. The alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone product was separated by normal phase HPLC and quantitated via absorption at 240 nm. Addition of cholesterol dissolved in 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin to the assay mixture raised the enzyme activity of rat liver mitochondria more than 10-fold. 2-Hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin itself was partially effective, apparently by making more endogenous cholesterol accessible to the enzyme. Availability of cholesterol to the enzyme limits synthesis of 27-hydroxycholesterol in rat liver. Using our assay to simultaneously determine the activities of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase and cholesterol 27-hydroxylase in rat liver homogenates, we demonstrated that the two enzymes are separately regulated.
The use of 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin as a vehicle for solubilizing cholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol has led to a study of their rates of 7 alpha-hydroxylation in microsomal preparations from hamster liver and HepG2 cells. Addition of the vehicle alone to the cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase assay always caused a several-fold increase in activity. Preloading the vehicle with cholesterol further augmented the rate of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol formation. Preloading the vehicle with 27-hydroxycholesterol or 27-hydroxycholestanol (molar ratio 1/1.2) minimally decreased cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity (-12%), compared with preloading with cholestanol (-50%), a known competitive inhibitor of the enzyme. Microsomes from hamster liver yielded rates of 7 alpha,27-dihydroxcholesterol formation of 1.5 to 3.0 nmol/min per mg protein, compared with 0.3 nmol/min per mg protein for 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol. Although cholesterol and cholestanol had minimal effects on the rate of 7 alpha-hydroxylation of 27-hydroxycholesterol, addition of an approximately equimolar amount of 27-hydroxycholestanol inhibited the rate of formation by 65%. Attempts to separate and identify the two C-27 sterol 7 alpha-hydroxylases chromatographically led to the finding that Emulgen 913 selectively inactivates 7 alpha-hydroxylation of 27-hydroxycholesterol. These results indicate that the metabolic pathway for bile acid synthesis from 27-hydroxycholesterol is not governed by cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase.
The goal of this study was to understand why the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors by the liver is poorly down-regulated by cholesterol. We examined the hypothesis that 7 alpha-hydroxylase may indirectly induce the expression of the LDL receptor by metabolizing, i.e. inactivating oxysterol repressors. Non-hepatic Chinese hamster ovary cells, transfected with a plasmid encoding 7 alpha-hydroxylase, expressed both the mRNA and functional activity of this liver-specific enzyme. In the presence of 5% serum, expression of the LDL receptor by transfected cells was &gt; 20 times that of non-transfected cells despite a 50% increased content of cholesterol ester. Both cell types displayed an almost complete repression of the LDL receptor by the oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol, suggesting that transcriptional control of the LDL receptor gene remained intact in the transfected cells. However, only cells expressing 7 alpha-hydroxylase showed a derepression of the LDL receptor with time. This transient sensitivity to 25-hydroxycholesterol repression was attributed to a 3-fold greater rate of metabolism of [3H]25-hydroxycholesterol. The paradoxical induction of LDL receptor mRNA in transfected cells having greater amounts of cholesterol esters suggests that 7 alpha-hydroxylase may preferentially use oxysterols rather than cholesterol as substrates. The combined data are consistent with the proposal that 7 alpha-hydroxylase indirectly induces the LDL receptor gene by metabolizing (inactivating) oxysterol repressors. Liver-specific expression of 7 alpha-hydroxylase can account for the relative resistance of hepatic LDL receptors to down-regulation.
Hepatic free cholesterol levels are influenced by cholesterol synthesis and ester formation, which, in turn, might regulate cholesterol secretion into bile and plasma. We manipulated the rates of hepatic cholesterol synthesis and esterification and measured biliary and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol secretion, and bile acid synthesis. Mevalonate decreased HMG CoA reductase by 80%, increased acyl coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) by 60% and increased [3H]oleate incorporation into microsomal and VLDL cholesteryl esters by 174% and 122%, respectively. Microsomal and biliary free cholesterol remained constant at the expense of increased microsomal and VLDL cholesteryl ester content. Mevalonate did not change bile acid synthesis. 25-OH cholesterol decreased HMG-CoA reductase by 39%, increased ACAT by 24%, but did not effect 7 alpha-hydroxylase. 25-OH cholesterol increased [3H]oleate in microsomal and VLDL cholesterol esters by 71% and 120%. Biliary cholesterol decreased by 40% and VLDL cholesteryl esters increased by 83%. A small and unsustained decrease in bile acid synthesis (14CO2 release) occurred after 25-OH cholesterol. After orotic acid feeding, HMG-CoA reductase increased 352%, and [3H]oleate in microsomal and VLDL cholesteryl esters decreased by 43% and 89%. Orotic acid decreased all VLDL components including free cholesterol (68%) and cholesteryl esters (55%), and increased biliary cholesterol by 160%. No change in bile acid synthesis occurred. Hepatic cholesterol synthesis and esterification appear to regulate a cholesterol pool available for both biliary and VLDL secretion. Changing cholesterol synthesis and esterification did not alter bile acid synthesis, suggesting that either this common bile/VLDL secretory pool is functionally distinct from the cholesterol pool used for bile salt synthesis, or that free cholesterol availability in this precursor pool is not a major determinant of bile acid synthesis.
Human liver microsomes were found to catalyze 7 alpha-hydroxylation of 27-hydroxycholesterol at a rate of up to about 0.2 nmol/mg protein per min. The product of the reaction, 5-cholestene-3 beta, 7 alpha, 27-triol, was identified by means of combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Liver microsomes from two patients with an upregulated cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, did not have higher 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity towards 27-hydroxycholesterol than those from untreated patients, suggesting that the 7 alpha-hydroxylase active towards 27-hydroxycholesterol is not the same as that active towards cholesterol. The mitochondrial fraction of liver from untreated patients and patients treated with cholestyramine, had negligible 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity towards 27-hydroxycholesterol less than 0.01 nmol/mg protein per min). The results are in accord with the possibility that there is a pathway to bile acids in human liver in which the first step is a 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol.
(24S)-Hydroxycholesterol is formed from cholesterol in the brain and is important for cholesterol homeostasis in this organ. Elimination of (24S)-hydroxycholesterol has been suggested to occur in the liver but little is known about the metabolism of this oxysterol. In the present investigation, we report formation of 7alpha, 24-dihydroxycholesterol in pig and human liver. 7alpha-hydroxylase activity toward both isomers of 24-hydroxycholesterol [(24S) and (24R)] was found in a partially purified and reconstituted cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A) enzyme fraction from pig liver microsomes. In contrast, a purified enzyme fraction of pig liver oxysterol 7alpha-hydroxylase with high activity toward 27-hydroxycholesterol did not show any detectable activity toward 24-hydroxycholesterol. 7alpha-Hydroxylation of 24-hydroxycholesterol was strongly inhibited by 7-oxocholesterol, a known inhibitor of CYP7A. Human CYP7A, recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli and in simian COS cells, showed 7alpha-hydroxylase activity toward both cholesterol and the two isomers of 24-hydroxycholesterol, with a preference for the (24S)-isomer. Our results show that 24-hydroxycholesterol is metabolized by CYP7A, an enzyme previously considered to be specific for cholesterol and cholestanol and not active toward oxysterols. Because CYP7A is the rate-limiting enzyme in the major pathway of bile acid biosynthesis, the possibility is discussed that at least part of the 24-hydroxycholesterol is converted into 7alpha-hydroxylated bile acids by the enzymes involved in the normal biosynthesis of bile acids.
Oxysterol 7alpha-hydroxylase has broad substrate specificity for sterol metabolites and may be involved in many metabolic processes including bile acid synthesis and neurosteroid metabolism. The cloned human oxysterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7B1) cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 506 amino acid residues that shares 40% sequence identity to human cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids in the liver. In contrast to the liver-specific expression of CYP7A1, CYP7B1 mRNA transcripts were detected in human tissues involved in steroid genesis (brain, testes, ovary, and prostate) and in bile acid synthesis (liver) and reabsorption (colon, kidney, and small intestine). The human oxysterol 7alpha-hydroxylase transiently expressed in 293/T cells was able to catalyze 7alpha-hydroxylation of 27-hydroxycholesterol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). The human CYP7A1 and CYP7B1 both contain six exons and five introns. However, CYP7B1 spans at least 65 kb of the genome and is about 6-fold longer than CYP7A1. The transcription start site (+1) was localized 204 bp upstream of the initiation codon. No TATA box-like sequence was found near the transcription start site. Transient transfection assays of CYP7B1 promoter/luciferase reporter constructs in HepG2 cells revealed that the promoter was highly active. The 5' upstream region from nt -83 to +189 is the core promoter of the gene.
Cholestyramine increases activities of hepatic cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase and serum levels of 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol. To examine if serum 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol levels parallel with enzyme activity, 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 10% of cholestyramine was administered to female golden Syrian hamsters for 28 d in the dose-dependent study, and 2% cholestyramine for 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 d in the time-dependent study. In the dose-dependent study, hepatic and serum cholesterol levels were significantly decreased dose-dependently when more than 0.5% of cholestyramine was fed for 28 d. Cholestyramine increased the cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase activity in a dose-dependent manner, while the serum 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol level was essentially unchanged. No correlation was found between the serum level and the hepatic enzyme activity. In the time-dependent study, hepatic and serum cholesterol levels markedly decreased when 2% cholestyramine was fed for longer than 3 d. The serum triglyceride level increased significantly for the first 7 d and then decreased. Cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase activity increased significantly as early as day 1, reached maximum activity level on day 7, and then kept the significantly high values until day 28. The serum 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol level significantly increased for the first 7 d and decreased to the pretreatment level thereafter. 7Alpha-hydroxycholesterol levels significantly correlated with serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels. We conclude that the serum 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol level does not always reflect the activity of hepatic cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase, when cholesterol metabolism is severely disturbed by cholestyramine.
Our purpose was to examine the in vitro modulation of liver mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase (S27OHase) and microsomal cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CH7alphaOHase) activities by certain drugs, sterols, oxysterols and bile acids, and to compare the influence of sex, age, diet and cholestyramine on these activities, in the hamster. In vitro, 7beta-hydroxycholesterol and 5alpha-cholestan-3beta-ol (cholestanol) were strong inhibitors (at 2 microM) of both enzyme activities, while 5beta-cholestan-3alpha-ol (epicoprostanol, 2 microM) and cyclosporin A (20 microM) inhibited S27OHase, but not CH7alphaOHase. These data suggest that a hydroxyl group at the 7alpha position is not required to inhibit CH7alphaOHase and that the presence of an aliphatic CH2-CH-(CH3)2 chain appears to be structurally important for S27OHase activity. Both enzyme activities remained unchanged by hyodeoxycholic acid (40 or 80 microM) while epicoprostanol inhibited only S27OHase and chenodeoxycholic acid only CH7alphaOHase. Adult (9-week old) male or female hamsters displayed similar S27OHase activity but the CH7alphaOHase activity was lower in females than in males, suggesting that the neutral bile acid pathway has a less important role in females. In male hamsters, S27OHase activity did not change with age, while CH7alphaOHase activity significantly increased (one-year vs 9-week old). A semi-purified sucrose-rich (lithogenic) diet significantly lowered both enzyme activities compared to the commercial diet. Cholestyramine induced a stimulation of both enzymes, slightly more vigorously however for the key enzyme involved in the neutral pathway. Taken together, these data indicate that the two enzymes are separately regulated and that certain drugs or steroid compounds can be useful for specifically inhibiting or stimulating the neutral or acidic bile acid pathway.
7-Ketocholesterol is a major oxidation product of cholesterol found in human atherosclerotic plaque and is more atherogenic than cholesterol in some animal studies. 7-Ketocholesterol can inhibit cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, the rate-limiting step in bile acid biosynthesis, as well as strongly inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. It has even been suggested that 7-ketocholesterol is formed enzymically as an endogenous regulator of cholesterol biosynthesis. However, when tested as a pharmacological cholesterol-lowering agent, inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase was rapidly overcome and the 7-ketocholesterol metabolised. In vitro, 7-ketocholesterol has wide-ranging and potent effects, most of which have the potential to contribute to atherosclerosis. For example, 7-ketocholesterol can be cytotoxic and can induce apoptosis in vascular cells. These effects, either individually or more likely, in combination, all implicate 7-ketocholesterol in the initiation and development of atherosclerosis, but further work is needed to establish whether or not its role is a direct causal one.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and Mycobacterium smegmatis (Msmeg) can grow on cholesterol as the sole carbon source. In Mtb the utilization of cholesterol can be initiated by CYP125A1 or CYP142A1 and in Msmeg by the orthologous CYP125A3 and CYP142A2. Double knockout of the two enzymes in Mtb prevents its growth on cholesterol, but the double knockout of Msmeg is still able to grow, albeit at a slower rate. We report here that Msmeg has a third enzyme, CYP125A4, that also oxidizes cholesterol, although it has a much higher activity for the oxidation of 7α-hydroxycholesterol. The ability of Msmeg CYP125A4 (and Mtb CYP125A1) to oxidize 7α-hydroxycholesterol is due, at least in part, to the presence of a smaller amino acid side chain facing C-7 of the sterol substrate than in CYP125A3. The ability to oxidize 7-substituted steroids broadens the range of sterol carbon sources for growth, but even more importantly in Mtb, additional biological effects are possible due to the potent immunomodulatory activity of 7α,26-dihydroxycholesterol. 
(25R)-26-Hydroxycholesterol (27-hydroxycholesterol) has been found to accumulate in breast tissue and to stimulate tumor growth via the estrogen receptor. Although most tissues express CYP27A1, the highest levels are in macrophages and most attention had been given to the production of 27-hydroxycholesterol in sub-endothelial macrophages as part of reverse cholesterol transport. In view of the newly identified biologic activity, it is important to consider the determinants of the levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol in macrophages that infiltrate breast tissue. Among these determinants are the oxysterol binding proteins expressed in macrophages, the level of expression of CYP7B1, the oxysterol 7 alpha hydroxylase that generates an inactive triol, and further oxidation of 27-hydroxycholestrol to the C27 acid by multifunctional CYP27A1. Transport of 27-hydroxycholesterol from macrophages to plasma is HDL-associated. In many tissues the ratio of 27-hydroxycholesterol to cholesterol (ng/μg) is higher than that in plasma. Tamoxifen, an effective estrogen receptor antagonist that prevents breast cancer, also has the biologic property of blocking several steps in the lanosterol to cholesterol metabolic pathway. In genetically disposed women, tamoxifen may increase the amount of 27-hydroxycholesterol in breast tissue. 
Hepatic conversion to bile acids is a major elimination route for cholesterol in mammals. CYP7A1 catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in classic bile acid biosynthesis, converting cholesterol to 7α-hydroxycholesterol. To identify the structural determinants that govern the stereospecific hydroxylation of cholesterol, we solved the crystal structure of CYP7A1 in the ligand-free state. The structure-based mutation T104L in the B' helix, corresponding to the nonpolar residue of CYP7B1, was used to obtain crystals of complexes with cholest-4-en-3-one and with cholesterol oxidation product 7-ketocholesterol (7KCh). The structures reveal a motif of residues that promote cholest-4-en-3-one binding parallel to the heme, thus positioning the C7 atom for hydroxylation. Additional regions of the binding cavity (most distant from the access channel) are involved to accommodate the elongated conformation of the aliphatic side chain. Structural complex with 7KCh shows an active site rigidity and provides an explanation for its inhibitory effect. Based on our previously published data, we proposed a model of cholesterol abstraction from the membrane by CYP7A1 for metabolism. CYP7A1 structural data provide a molecular basis for understanding of the diversity of 7α-hydroxylases, on the one hand, and cholesterol-metabolizing enzymes adapted for their specific activity, on the other hand. 
Recent epidemiological studies have shown a correlation between periodontitis and hyperlipidemia. We have found high levels of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL) in the gingival crevicular fluid of dental patients. In the present study, we tried to examine the possible role of OxLDL in periodontal inflammation in vitro.
Cells of the human gingival epithelial cell line Ca9-22 were cultured in media containing OxLDL, and the amounts of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) produced were measured using ELISAs.
Production of IL-8 by Ca9-22 cells was significantly increased when the cells were treated with OxLDL, but not with native LDL or acetylated LDL. Production of PGE(2) by Ca9-22 cells was enhanced by co-incubation with OxLDL and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). Scavenger receptor inhibitors, fucoidan and dextran sulfate, inhibited the OxLDL-induced IL-8 and PGE(2) production in the presence of IL-1 beta. The p(38) MAPK inhibitors SB203580 and SB202190 and the ERK inhibitor PD98059 inhibited the OxLDL-induced IL-8 production. Among oxidized lipids and chemically modified LDL, 7-ketocholesterol enhanced IL-8 production.
This is the first report to show that OxLDL enhances IL-8 production in epithelial cells.
Patients with a recessively inherited "pure" hereditary spastic paresis (SPG5) have mutations in the gene coding for the oxysterol 7 alpha hydroxylase (CYP7B1). One of the expected metabolic consequences of such mutations is accumulation of oxysterol substrates due to decreased enzyme activity. In accordance with this, we demonstrate here that four patients with the SPG5 disease have 6- to 9-fold increased plasma levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol. A much higher increase, 30- to 50-fold, was found in cerebrospinal fluid. The plasma levels of 25-hydroxycholesterol were increased about 100-fold. There were no measurable levels of this oxysterol in cerebrospinal fluid. The pattern of bile acids in serum was normal, suggesting a normal bile acid synthesis. The findings are discussed in relation to two transgenic mouse models with increased levels of 27-hydroxy cholesterol in the circulation but without neurological symptoms: the cyp27a1 transgenic mouse and the cyp7b1 knockout mouse. The absolute plasma levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol in the latter models are, however, only about 20% of those in the SPG5 patients. If the accumulation of 27-hydroxycholesterol is an important pathogenetic factor, a reduction of its levels may reduce or prevent the neurological symptoms. A possible strategy to achieve this is discussed.
The conversion of cholesterol into bile acids occurs via a long cascade of enzymatically regulated oxidative processes. Our aim was to examine if an up-regulation of hepatic cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) in humans by cholestyramine, a bile acid-binding resin, has an effect on the degradation of brain-specific 24S-hydroxycholesterol.
Six normocholesterolemic male volunteers received 4 g cholestyramine b.i.d. for 2 weeks in an open, prospective exploratory trial. Serum concentrations of lipoproteins and triglycerides were measured by routine enzymatic assays. Sterols and oxysterols were measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.
Total and LDL-cholesterol decreased on the average by 9.3% (p = 0.002) and 19.8% (p = 0.001) after 2 weeks of treatment, respectively. Absolute serum concentrations of 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol, a marker for bile acid production, increased 4-fold after 2 weeks, while 24S- and 27-hydroxycholesterol remained unchanged. Treatment with cholestyramine elevated serum levels of lathosterol, an indicator for the endogenous synthesis of cholesterol, by 146% (p = 0.009).
In addition to lowering serum concentrations of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, cholestyramine at a dose rate of 4 g b.i.d. causes a significant increase in the CYP7A1 catalyzed 7alpha-hydroxylation of cholesterol and an up-regulation of endogenous cholesterol synthesis, as proven indirectly by an increase in serum lathosterol levels. Total serum levels of 24S- and 27-hydroxycholesterol remained unchanged indicating that an up-regulation in CYP7A1 activity is not responsible for the subsequent oxidative degradation of these hydroxylated sterols.
7-Ketocholesterol (7kCh) is a major oxysterol found associated with vascular diseases. Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs) were cultured with different concentrations of 7kCh with and without inhibitors. Cell viabilities and caspase activities were assessed. 7kCh caused loss of cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Caspases-8, -12, and -3/7 but not caspase-9 were activated by 7kCh treatment. The 7kCh-induced caspase-8 activity was blocked partially by pre-treatment with z-VAD-fmk and z-IETD-fmk, a caspase-8 inhibitor. However, pre-treatment with z-ATAD-fmk, a caspase-12 inhibitor, followed by 7kCh exposure lead to significantly increased caspase-8 activity. This suggests that caspase-8 and caspase-12 pathways have unique inhibition patterns and that caspase-12 is likely not upstream and feeding into caspase-8 but the pathways may function in parallel to each other. Caspase-3/7 activation was inhibited partially by low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), z-VAD-fmk (pan-caspase inhibitor), and low doses (0.01 and 0.001 microM) of the cholesterol lowering drug, simvastatin. However, only LDL partially protected against 7kCh-induced loss of cell viability suggesting that caspase-independent pathways also contributed to the cell loss and that protection from oxysterol damage may require inhibition of multiple pathways. Moreover, our data suggest that oxysterols such as 7kCh can damage HMVECs cells in part via caspase-dependent apoptosis and may play a role in vascular and retinal diseases.
To determine whether caspase or cathepsin pathways are activated in human retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE-19) after exposure to 7-ketocholesterol (7kCh).
ARPE-19 cells were exposed to 7kCh with or without z-VAD-fmk, a pan-caspase inhibitor. Caspase-3, -8, and -9 activities were measured by a fluorochrome inhibitor of caspase (FLICA) assay. Caspase-12 activity was detected by Western blotting. RT-PCR was performed for 18s, mortalin-2, cathepsins B, D, and L/V2.
At 24 hours, 7kCh-treated cultures had increased caspase-8 (P &lt; 0.001) and caspase-3 (P &lt; 0.001) activities compared with vehicle-treated cultures. 7kCh-induced caspase-3 activation was blocked by z-VAD-fmk (P &lt; 0.001). Caspase-9 was not activated by 7kCh treatment (P &gt; 0.05). Procaspase-12 was cleaved into its active form after treatment with 7kCh for 24 hours. At 6 hours, the RNA level for mortalin-2, a pro-survival gene, was upregulated. ARPE-19 cells did not express RNA for cathepsins B, D, or L/V2 under any conditions.
In ARPE-19 cells, 7kCh-induced apoptosis uses the receptor-mediated caspase-8 pathway and the endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced caspase-12 pathway but not the mitochondrial caspase-9 pathway. The cathepsin pathways are not involved in 7kCh-induced cell death. These data demonstrate that 7kCh causes a loss of cell viability through caspase-dependent apoptosis and can act as an oxidative stressor leading to retinal pigment epithelial cell atrophy. Elucidating the specific apoptotic pathways involved may have therapeutic potential for AMD and other retinal diseases.
This study reports the discovery of a novel sulfonated oxysterol found at high levels in the mitochondria and nuclei of primary rat hepatocytes after overexpression of the gene encoding steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StarD1). Forty-eight hours after infection of primary rat hepatocytes with recombinant adenovirus encoding StarD1, rates of bile acid synthesis increased by 4-fold. Concurrently, [(14)C]cholesterol metabolites (oxysterols) were increased dramatically in both the mitochondria and nuclei of StarD1-overexpressing cells, but not in culture medium. A water-soluble [(14)C]oxysterol product was isolated and purified by chemical extraction and reverse-phase HPLC. Enzymatic digestion, HPLC, and tandem mass spectrometry analysis identified the water-soluble oxysterol as 5-cholesten-3beta,25-diol 3-sulfonate. Further experiments detected this cholesterol metabolite in the nuclei of normal human liver tissues. Based upon these observations, we hypothesized a new pathway by which cholesterol is metabolized in the mitochondrion.
Determination of plasma 24S-hydroxycholesterol, which is produced almost exclusively in the brain and is released only in small amounts into circulation under physiological conditions, might be a marker to monitor non-invasively the time course and the extent of the disintegration of the blood-brain barrier after cerebral ischemia. We investigated the plasma concentrations for 4 to 10 days of 24S-hydroxycholesterol, and compared the concentration with the liver-specific oxysterol 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol, the ubiquitously produced 27-hydroxycholesterol, and cholesterol itself in six patients who were admitted to the hospital within 24 h after symptoms of stroke. Quantification of oxysterols was performed by isotope dilution mass spectrometry and cholesterol by gas-liquid chromatography. Initial concentrations of cholesterol, 24S-, 7alpha-, and 27-hydroxycholesterol in stroke patients were not different from data of healthy controls given in the literature. During the following days, no changes could be observed in the concentrations of cholesterol nor in the other oxysterols. Particularly the brain specific 24S-hydroxycholesterol was very constant and showed only minimal changes. Furthermore, comparison of patients with extended or small lesions did not reveal any differences in the concentrations of oxysterols. Therefore, circulating levels of 24S-hydroxycholesterol are supposed to be only of limited value for monitoring the brain-blood barrier function in patients with acute ischemic stroke.
Oxysterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7B1) metabolizes oxysterols, potent regulators of lipid homeostasis. Very little is known about transcriptional regulation of human CYP7B1. The present results indicate that sterol response element binding protein (SREBP), a family of oxysterol-responsive transcription factors that stimulates cholesterol synthesis, may be an important regulator of CYP7B1. SREBP suppressed a human CYP7B1 luciferase reporter gene in several cell lines, most markedly in rat hepatoma McA-RH7777 cells. An SREBP-1-responsive region was mapped to a GC-rich sequence in the proximal CYP7B1 promoter, containing binding sites for the basal transcriptional activator Sp1. Mutagenesis of this sequence abolished SREBP-1-mediated suppression. Data indicated that SREBP does not bind this sequence but affects the gene indirectly, probably via interaction with Sp1. Our findings indicate that CYP7B1 transcription is controlled by SREBP and reveal a link between oxysterol-sensitive regulators and oxysterol metabolism. We propose that CYP7B1 is important for regulating cellular sterol content and protects against oxysterol-mediated toxicity.
We tested the hypothesis that breast- vs. formula-feeding differentially affects the enzymatic activity of three sterol hydroxylases critical in the initial steps of bile acid formation. Thirty baboons were either breast-fed or formula-fed for the first 14 wk of life before weaning to baboon chow. At 14 and 34 wk of age, liver biopsies were assayed for cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), 27-hydroxycholesterol-7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7B1), and cholesterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1). We also determined the kinetics of 3H-27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) turnover in vivo at both ages. At 14 wk of age, hepatic CYP7A1 activity was low but sevenfold higher among formula-fed vs. breast-fed baboons. By 34 wk, CYP7A1 activity had increased nearly 10-fold in both infant diet groups, and the sevenfold difference in CYP7A1 between previously breast- and formula-fed animals persisted. There were no differences in CYP7B1 activities between infant diet groups at either 14 or 34 wk of age although the activity increased in both groups by about 50% from 14 to 34 wk. CYP27A1 activity also increased between 14 and 34 wk of age, and, compared with CYP7A1, relatively small differences in CYP27A1 activity due to infant diet were observed at each age. Plasma 27-OHC turnover had a half-time of 2-4 min. We had previously reported that after weaning, the total bile acid synthesis rate was higher among baboons that were formula-fed than among breast-fed animals. The present results suggest that this difference is most likely due to significantly higher CYP7A1 activity among formula-fed vs. breast-fed animals.
Cholesterol homoeostasis is the result of the fine tuning between intake and disposal of this molecule. High levels of cholesterol in the blood are detrimental as they may lead to excessive accumulation in vessel walls, a condition predisposing to the development of atherosclerotic lesions. Cholesterol is removed from the vessel wall and transported to the liver through a process called reverse cholesterol transport. Nuclear receptors are among the most important transcription factors regulating genes involved in different steps of reverse cholesterol transport. Here, we discuss the role of the nuclear receptors LXR (liver X receptor) and HNF-4alpha (hepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha) in different steps of reverse cholesterol transport. LXR controls the transcription of crucial genes in cholesterol efflux from macrophages and its transport to the liver, such as ABCA1 (ATP binding cassette A1), CYP27A1 (sterol 27-hydroxylase), CLA-1 (scavenger receptor type B1) and apolipoprotein E. Some oxysterols present in oxidized low-density lipoproteins and proinflammatory cytokines modulate the activity of LXR by antagonizing the effect of activators of this receptor, thus contributing to cholesterol accumulation in macrophages. Bile acid synthesis, which represents the final step of reverse cholesterol transport, is transcriptionally regulated by several nuclear receptors at the level of the liver-specific cytochrome P450 cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the rate-limiting enzyme of this metabolic pathway. Bile acids returning to the liver through the enterohepatic circulation down-regulate CYP7A1 transcription via the bile acid sensors farnesoid X receptor and HNF-4alpha. Based on this evidence, these nuclear receptors are candidate targets of new drugs for the treatment and prevention of atherosclerotic disease.
This article aims to give an overview on the characterization, properties and regulation of enzymes, particularly the cytochrome (CYP) P450 enzymes, in the formation of bile acids from cholesterol. Bile acids are biologically active molecules that promote absorption of dietary lipids in the intestine and stimulate biliary excretion of cholesterol. Bile acids and oxysterols, formed from cholesterol, act as ligands to nuclear receptors regulating the expression of important genes in cholesterol homeostasis. Thus, the bioactivation of cholesterol into bile acids is crucial for regulation of cholesterol homeostasis. The primary human bile acids, cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, are formed from cholesterol via several pathways involving many different enzymes. Many of these enzymes are cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, introducing a hydroxyl group in the molecule. The "classic" pathway of bile acid formation starts with a 7alpha-hydroxylation of cholesterol by CYP7A1 in the liver. The "acidic" pathway starts with a hepatic or extrahepatic 27-hydroxylation by CYP27A1. There also exist some quantitatively minor pathways which may be of importance under certain conditions. Formation of cholic acid requires insertion of a 12alpha-hydroxyl group performed by CYP8B1. Oxysterols are precursors to bile acids, participate in cholesterol transport and are known to affect the expression of several genes in cholesterol homeostasis. Enzymes with capacity to form and metabolize oxysterols are present in liver and extrahepatic tissues. The enzymes, nuclear receptors and transcription factors involved in bile acid biosynthesis are potential pharmaceutical targets for the development of new drugs to control hypercholesterolemia and to prevent atherosclerosis and other diseases related to disturbed cholesterol homeostasis. The review will also discuss some inborn errors of bile acid biosynthesis and the recently acquired knowledge on the genetic defects underlying these diseases.
The toxicity of uranium has been demonstrated in different organs, including the kidneys, skeleton, central nervous system, and liver. However, few works have investigated the biological effects of uranium contamination on important metabolic function in the liver. In vivo studies were conducted to evaluate its effects on cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes involved in the metabolism of cholesterol and xenobiotics in the rat liver. The effects of depleted uranium (DU) contamination on Sprague-Dawley were measured at 1 and 3 days after exposure. Biochemical indicators characterizing liver and kidney functions were measured in the plasma. The DU affected bile acid CYP activity: 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol plasma level decreased by 52% at day 3 whereas microsomal CYP7A1 activity in the liver did not change significantly and mitochondrial CYP27A1 activity quintupled at day 1. Gene expression of the nuclear receptors related to lipid metabolism (FXR and LXR) also changed, while PPARalpha mRNA levels did not. The increased mRNA levels of the xenobiotic-metabolizing CYP3A enzyme at day 3 may be caused by feedback up-regulation due to the decreased CYP3A activity at day 1. CAR mRNA levels, which tripled on day 1, may be involved in this up-regulation, while mRNA levels of PXR did not change. These results indicate that high levels of depleted uranium, acting through modulation of the CYP enzymes and some of their nuclear receptors, affect the hepatic metabolism of bile acids and xenobiotics.
Oxysterols are bioactive lipids derived from cholesterol that are linked to inflammatory processes. Because obesity and metabolic syndrome are characterized by inflammation and altered cholesterol metabolism, we sought to investigate the variations of oxysterol levels and their metabolic pathways induced by obesity in the liver, hypothalamus, adipose tissue and plasma. To this end, we used diet-induced and genetic (ob/ob and db/db) models of obesity. Among the oxysterols measured, we found that 4β-oxysterol levels were consistently decreased in the high-fat diet study, at different time-points, and in the ob/ob model. Overall, we did not find any correlation between cytochromes mRNA expression and variations of oxysterol levels. We also measured the levels of hepatic primary bile acids, in these three models and found similar profiles between HFD and ob/ob mice. However, although they are downstream metabolites of oxysterols, the variations in bile acid levels did not reflect the variations of their precursors. Our data show that, when considering oxysterol metabolism, the high-fat diet and ob/ob models are more closely related when compared to the db/db model. However, we were able to discriminate between lean and obese phenotypes based on liver oxysterol (4β-hydroxycholesterol, 27- hydroxycholesterol, 7-hydroxycholestenone) levels and enzyme (CYP3A11, CYP27A1, CYP7A1) expression. 
The interaction of the primary autoxidation products of cholesterol, namely 25- and 20ξ-hydroperoxides, with the four principal cholesterol-metabolizing cytochrome P450 enzymes is reported. Addition of cholesterol 25-hydroperoxide to the enzymes CYP27A1 and CYP11A1 induced well-defined spectral changes while generating 25-hydroxycholesterol as the major product. The 20ξ-hydroperoxides induced spectral shifts in CYP27A1 and CYP11A1 but glycol metabolites were detected only with CYP11A1. CYP7A1 and CYP46A1 failed to give metabolites with any of the hydroperoxides. A P450 hydroperoxide-shunt reaction is proposed, where the hydroperoxides serve as both donor for reduced oxygen and substrate. CYP27A1 was shown to mediate the reduction of cholesterol 25-hydroperoxide to 25-hydroxycholesterol, a role of potential significance for cholesterol-rich tissues with high oxidative stress. CYP27A1 may participate in the removal of harmful autoxidation products in these tissues, while providing a complementary source of 25-hydroxycholesterol, a modulator of immune cell function and mediator of viral cell entry. 
11β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 (11β-HSD1) plays a key role in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation. Besides, it metabolizes some oxysterols and bile acids (BAs). The GR regulates BA homeostasis; however, the impact of impaired 11β-HSD1 activity remained unknown. We profiled plasma and liver BAs in liver-specific and global 11β-HSD1-deficient mice. 11β-HSD1-deficiency resulted in elevated circulating unconjugated BAs, an effect more pronounced in global than liver-specific knockout mice. Gene expression analyses revealed decreased expression of the BA-CoA ligase Fatp5, suggesting impaired BA amidation. Reduced organic anion-transporting polypeptide-1A1 (Oatp1a1) and enhanced organic solute-transporter-β (Ostb) mRNA expression were observed in livers from global 11β-HSD1-deficient mice. The impact of 11β-HSD1-deficiency on BA homeostasis seems to be GR-independent because intrahepatic corticosterone and GR target gene expression were not substantially decreased in livers from global knockout mice. Moreover, Fatp5 expression in livers from hepatocyte-specific GR knockout mice was unchanged. The results revealed a role for 11β-HSD1 in BA homeostasis.
