<b> 'The' 'CAR/RXR' heterodimer</b> binds to two 'DR-4' sites in a complex phenobarbital responsive unit ( 'PBRU)' in the 'CYP2B' gene.   <b> 'We'</b> have examined the role of 'SHP' in 'CAR-mediated' transactivation of the 'CYP2B' gene.   <b> 'SHP' did not block the</b> binding of either 'CAR/RXR' to the 'PBRU' or binding of 'GRIP1' to the 'CAR/RXR' complex in gel mobility shift 'assays,' but slightly increased 'CAR/RXR' binding and slightly altered the mobility of the 'CAR/RXR/GRIP1' 'complex,' suggesting an interaction of 'SHP' with these complexes.   <b> 'SMRT' and 'NCoR1'</b> inhibited 'CAR-mediated' activation independent of 'SHP,' but mSin3A and 'HDAC1' had little effect 'alone,' and were additive with 'SHP'.   <b> 'These' studies</b> demonstrate that 'SHP' does not inhibit 'CAR-mediated' 'trans-activation' by interfering with 'DNA' binding or by competition with 'GRIP1'.    'The' minimal construct that confers full promoter activity contains three functional hepatocyte nuclear factor<b> 1</b> alpha ( 'HNF1alpha)' recognition 'sites,' explaining the dependence of 'ASBT' gene expression upon 'HNF1alpha'.   <b> 'A'</b> nuclear receptor binding site arranged as a direct hexanucleotide repeat ( 'DR1' 'motif)' is localized approximately 1.6 kb upstream of the transcription initiation site.    'The' potency and hierarchy of bile acids as ligands for the 'farnesyl/bile' acid receptor ( 'FXR/BAR)' paralleled their ability to induce<b> 'BSEP' in human hepatocyte cultures</b>.   <b> 'FXR:RXR' heterodimers</b> bound to 'IR1' elements and enhanced bile acid transcriptional activation of the mouse and human 'BSEP/SPGP' promoters.   <b> 'In' 'FXR/BAR' nullizygous 'mice,' which</b> have<b> dramatically reduced 'BSEP/SPGP' 'levels,' hepatic 'CYP3A11' and 'CYP2B10' were strongly but unexpectedly induced</b>.   <b> 'Because' serum and urinary bile acids</b> increased in 'FXR/BAR'-/-'mice,' we evaluated hepatic transporters for compensatory changes that might circumvent the profound decrease in 'BSEP/SPGP'.    'We' found<b> weak 'MRP3' 'up-regulation'</b>.   <b> 'Major' transport proteins</b> involved in the enterohepatic circulation of bile salts include the hepatocellular bile salt export pump ( 'BSEP,' 'ABCB11),' the apical 'sodium-dependent' bile salt transporter ( 'ASBT,' 'SLC10A2)' in cholangiocytes and 'enterocytes,' the 'sodium-dependent' hepatocyte bile salt uptake system 'NTCP' ( 'SLC10A1),' the organic anion transporting polypeptides 'OATP-C' ( 'SLC21A6),' 'OATP8' ( 'SLC21A8)' and 'OATP-A' ( 'SLC21A3),' and the multidrug resistance protein 'MRP3' ( 'ABCC3)'.    'In' the 'CAR-null' 'mouse,' 'PB' does not only induce<b> the 'Cyp2b10' 'gene,' but also induces genes encoding various metabolizing enzymes</b>.   <b> 'However,'</b> 'PB' induction of the synthase occurs in 'CAR-null' 'mice,' suggesting that 'CAR' does not coordinate the heme synthesis for the induction of 'drug/steroid' metabolism.   <b> 'Using' 'HepG2'</b> nuclear 'extracts,' three 'protein-DNA' complexes were formed on the 'DR1' 'element,' one of which was confirmed to be dependent on the binding of 'HNF4'.    'Experiments' in 'COS-7' cells showed that 'HNF4' could activate<b> the 'CYP2D6' promoter 30-fold</b>.   <b> 'Additionally,' 'COUP-TFI' was shown to</b> inhibit 'HNF4' stimulation of the 'CYP2D6' promoter in 'COS-7' 'cells,' suggesting that 'COUP-TFI' could attenuate the effect of 'HNF4' in 'HepG2' cells.    'Therefore,' the contribution of the 'DR1' element in controlling the transcription of the 'CYP2D6' gene depends on the balance between positively and negatively acting<b> transcription factors</b>.   <b> 'Our' findings may</b> provide a potential explanation for hyperlipidemic side effects observed in some patients treated with 'high-dose' 'RA'.   <b> 'Hepatocyte'</b> nuclear factor 1 alpha ( 'HNF1alpha)' and 'HNF4alpha' are 'liver-selective' transcription factors and are essential for hepatocyte differentiation.   <b> 'Transient' transfection experiments showed that 'RA'</b> increased the promoter activity of the 'HNF1alpha' and 'HNF4alpha' genes in 'Hep3B' cells.   <b> 'Two' putative 'RXRalpha'</b> binding sites on the 'HNF1alpha' (-295 to-276) and 'HNF4alpha' (-418 to-399) genes have been characterized.   <b> 'By' transient 'transfection,' both sites positively</b> responded to 'RA,' and overexpression of 'RXRalpha' in 'Hep3B' cells increased the regulatory effect.   <b> 'Indeed,' treatment with the 'PPARalpha-PPARbeta/delta' agonist bezafibrate</b> led to the 'up-regulation' of 'I-BABP' mRNA levels in the human 'intestine-derived' 'Caco-2' cells.   <b> 'It'</b> has been reported previously that 'MDR3' expression is modulated by 'hormones,' cellular 'stress,' and xenobiotics.   <b> 'Here' we</b> show that the 'MDR3' gene is 'trans-activated' by the farnesoid 'X' receptor ( 'FXR)' via a direct binding of 'FXR/retinoid' 'X' receptor alpha heterodimers to a highly conserved inverted repeat element ( a 'FXR' response 'element)' at the distal promoter (-1970 to-1958).   <b> 'An' unexpected</b> finding was that this was substantially greater in the severely diseased liver.    'No' effect of anticytokines was seen on pregnane 'X' receptor ( 'PXR)' and constitutive androstane receptor ( 'CAR)' binding<b> activity as well as nuclear protein mass</b>.   <b> 5) </b>, while 'IL-11' had the opposite effect ( 'p&lt;0'.   <b> 'ACI(Cia25)' rats had</b> increased expression of 10 nuclear receptor ( 'NR)' 'genes,' including those known to interfere with 'NF-κB' activity and cytokine 'expression,' such as 'Lxra,' 'Pparg,' and 'Rxrg'.
